HAIG IN FLANDERS 
- CHAPTER I 
The Village of Hurslet 
As a general rule it may be said, with some degree 
of assurance, that opinions tend to differ on numer-— 
ous subjects, important and unimportant. Yet 
there was a curious and striking unanimity with 
regard to the occupants of the two most important 
houses in the little village of Hurslet, in Somerset, 
which lies just outside the boundaries of a fairly . 
large provincial town, towards which its one street 
straggles. Indeed, journeying towards that par- 
ticular town, where the inhabitants of Hurslet are 
wont to do their shopping, one is struck by the 
curious fact that the village houses seem to have 
made an effort at one time to join up with their big 
neighbour. They are bunched close together at 
the bottom of the hill, as if for mutual protection; 
they march up the steep hill with considerable 
9 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
    10 Under Haig in Flanders 
boldness, but towards the top begin to straggle, as 
if the builders had lost energy. There are gaps, 
getting bigger and bigger, till, finally, the street 
ends in a puny cottage, while the top of the hill 
itself is graced by an imposing mansion. 
‘‘And so it’s been ever since I was a boy, and 
since my father’s boyhood too,” declared Sergeant 
Higgins, a local character, who had returned to his 
native place after years of army service, and was 
the proud proprietor of the ‘Morning Sun”, an 
inn which was a credit to the neighbourhood. 
“«Time was when the Hall was the only big house 
hereabouts. That is, the only house with gentry. 
Then comes the other, the Dene, and we had two 
lots of families. Proper gentlefolk I call them.” 
Who could be a better judge, for had not the 
gallant sergeant served for many years in the army, 
and had not his special calling therein thrown 
him into contact of the closest with numbers of 
officers? 
‘«There’s officers and officers,” he would tell the 
village folk, who visited his bar of an evening and 
drank a glass of his ale. ‘‘One gets to be able to 
tell between them. Some’s fair to middling, some 
are good, and others very good. There ain’t many 
that you could call less than that. No; on the 
whole, the army attracts the best of our young 
gentlefolk.” 
“‘And you’d say as them up at the Hall and 
tothers at the Dene was equal?” asked George 
Critchet, himself a man of some importance in 
Hurslet, for he owned and ran the local store. 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  The Village of Hurslet i 
‘‘Men same as you, Sergeant, who has travelled a 
heap, and who’s instructed all and sundry in gym- 
nastics, gets to know. ‘You'll have come across 
a power of gents what was orfficers, you will?” 
The Sergeant nodded affably and smiled. He was 
a tall, well-built man some fifty-four years of age, 
yet active and lissom, though to be sure a little less 
active than of yore. For your gymnastic instructor 
in the army must needs be a man of exceptional 
power, strong as a horse, agile as a goat, a dis- 
ciplinarian, smart, intelligent, and able to control 
classes, whether of recruits or of junior officers. 
“Ha, evening, Tom!” he called cheerily to a new 
arrival, a whiskered shepherd, who pushed the door 
of the bar open and shuffled forward. ‘‘ What's 
the news?” 
“News, Sergeant. Well, they be a-calling for 
new recruits. Derby recruits they tell ’un. Seems 
there’s some new sort of arrangement for the war, 
and Lord Derby’s put his name to ’un.” 
For a while the topic of conversation was changed, 
for we open our chapter at a time when the gigantic 
war, in which we are engaged as we write, had raged 
for many a month, when the tide of German in- 
vasion of France had been rolled back across the 
Marne River, and when that long line of trenches 
had been dug from the North Sea coast, close to 
Dunkirk, to the far-away frontier of Switzerland. 
There Belgians had held the northern sector with 
tenacity—flooding the country, and so placing a 
barrier between themselves and the enemy. Far- 
ther south, along the greater portion of that four-
-P-A-G-E-14
  12 Under Haig in Flanders 
hundred-mile trench-line, the French had magnifi- 
cently held their defences, while in the neighbour- 
hood of Ypres—to be ever famous in our annals— 
down to Bethune, some twenty miles south, that 
heroic British Expeditionary Force had hung on to 
the line, though overwhelming forces of Prussians 
had been flung at them. Forget not that ‘‘Con- 
temptible Little Army”, as the Kaiser dared ar- 
rogantly to call it! It saved England. Its record 
will never be beaten. 
Months had gone by. Britain, wherever the 
flag flew, was arming. Kitchener’s hosts were 
assembling, and Derby groups of recruits were now 
to be formed. The matter, as one can imagine, 
was discussed threadbare in Hurslet. Then, as 
is wont in such places, local affairs occupied the 
attention of the people. 
“Muster Riven at t’ Hall, he’s a good ’un,” 
quoth Farmer Standish as he chatted with the Ser- 
geant. ‘‘The Doctor, down below, he’s no wuss, 
and folks swear by him. I’ve only got good things 
to say of Miss Riven, but if you wants to hear 
more, go and ask the women in the village.” 
“Aye, and the children,” another voice chimed 
in. ‘They'll tell you. She’s nuss and everything 
to’em. They bless the very ground she walks on.” 
‘‘ They do,” the Sergeant agreed readily enough. 
“It’s a treat to catch a sight of that little lady, and 
no more than seventeen years of age I should 
imagine. But when you comes to the other, to 
Mister Riven’s nephew, why——” 
“You wonders how he’s ever agreed to have 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  The Village of Hurslet 13 
him,” said the farmer. ‘‘That’s queer, for blest 
if he ain’t coming down the street and his cousin 
with him.” 
There was a move to the prettily curtained window 
of the bar, strong boots crunching the sand with 
which the floor was dusted. Necks were craned, 
and all eyes were turned upon the two figures ap- 
proaching. 
“Aye, a good ’un to look at, that Missy Riven, 
and she’s as good as she looks,” declared one old 
fellow warmly. ‘‘I mind the time when——” 
“But you’d hardly dare say that of t’other, 
Muster Riven’s nephew,” someone interrupted. 
‘*He’s tall, and by the way he’s dressed you’d say 
he ought to be in Lunnon. But he ain’t liked. 
He’s that haughty. ’Sides, there’s queer tales about 
him.” 
“‘And then -he ain’t jined up, same as every 
other young gent hereabouts. Why, there ain’t 
none left but him and Doctor’s son, and he'll go 
quick, soon as he’s eighteen. He’s the lad for you, 
and—yes—there he’s a-coming from the opposite 
direction.” 
The smallest affairs are of moment in an isolated 
village, and the passing of people along the road- 
way of the single street of Hurslet on this particular 
day drew many a gossip and many a villager to 
the window. Perhaps two dozen pair of eager eyes 
watched the coming of Miss Riven and of the tall 
and haughty youth beside her, her cousin, and, 
from the opposite direction, of Roger Norman, son 
of Dr. Norman. Nor could the watchers have , 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  14 Under Haig in Flanders 
gazed upon two more dissimilar young fellows than 
Frank Riven on the one hand, marching haughtily 
beside his little cousin, and Roger Norman, son 
of Hurslet’s doctor, himself a much -respected 
gentleman. 
‘Just you watch the two of them,” said the Ser- 
geant, leaning over the backs of his clients filling 
the bay window of the ‘‘Morning Sun”, for he was 
taller than they, and peering over their heads. 
““There’s Mister Frank Riven swaggering along 
as if he was the owner of the village, and letting 
Miss Riven carry a basket that anyone can see is 
heavy. Then there’s young Norman, Roger Nor- 
man, a-swinging along with an easy stride that’d 
tell if he was on the barrack square, with his head 
nicely held, his legs well beneath him, knit all 
together as you might say, as bonny and jolly a 
lad as you want to look on.” 
“Aye, aye, that’s it,” agreed one of those present. 
‘A proper figure, Sergeant, and no swagger. And 
folks do say as he’s the most promising pupil you’ve 
got between here and the town, and that’s saying 
somethin’.” 
It was saying a good deal, as a matter of fact, for 
gymnastic instructors who leave the army with an 
Aldershot training and an army reputation are not 
apt to languish if they wish to make themselves 
useful. Indeed, thanks to the help of his wife, the 
Sergeant was able to leave the ‘‘Morning Sun” when 
he wished to do so, and not only did he instruct 
the boys and girls of many a neighbouring school 
in gymnastics, but he held classes for youths and
-P-A-G-E-17
  
The Village of Hurslet 15 
young men, where boxing, fencing, and gymnastics 
were carried to a high pitch of excellence. 
‘*You’ve spoken the truth,” he told the last 
speaker. ‘For his height and weight Roger is a 
first-class pugilist, and he’s got the brains and the 
temper to fight. He’s one of those stocky lads who 
can take a heap of hammering and come out fresh 
in the end.” 
Anyone who cared to take a close look at Roger 
Norman as he came striding up the street just then 
would have willingly agreed with the Sergeant’s 
dictum, for here was a neat, active figure, a youth, 
neither tall nor short, broad-shouldered, narrow at 
the waist and hips, with powerful limbs, and with 
a keen, resolute, if jolly face. Roger wasn’t exactly 
a handsome lad. He was more jolly than hand- 
some, one would say. But ugly, certainly not! 
His merry features swept that impression away 
altogether. 
‘‘Good afternoon, Miss Riven,” he cried gaily, 
lifting his cap as he drew near the approaching 
couple at a point almost opposite the ‘‘ Morning 
Sun”. ‘Why, you’re heavily laden. Allow me, 
please.” : 
Those who watched saw the swaggering Frank 
Riven scowl as Roger approached, and noted— 
for country folk are swift enough to see such things, 
being above all things courteous—noted that this 
young man nodded curtly, almost threateningly, at 
Roger. 
“There ain’t no love lost between them two. 
Leastwise, this Muster Riven ain’t got no sort o’
-P-A-G-E-18
  16 Under Haig in Flanders 
liking for Roger Norman,” growled one of the 
onlookers. 
“And not likely either,” grinned another. ‘‘ You 
ain’t forgotten, Jarge, what hap’d this ten months. 
back, when Muster Riven he comes to live with 
his uncle. Ain’t you heard o’ that? Well, this 
here Roger catches that fine young cock a-bullyin’ 
of his cousin, Missy Riven. Leastwise, that’s what 
folks says, though Roger Norman ain’t never let 
on about the matter. They says as, once the little 
lady’s back was turned, this here lout of a nephew 
follers Roger and lays in to him with a stick. 
Flesh and blood don’t. . 
The Sergeant laughed, a good-natured, hearty 
laugh, and flashed a knowing look at his audience, 
who turned at the sound of his mirth to look at 
him. 
“Laid on with a stick. So he did. So that 
young cub of a Frank Riven did,” he agreed, 
smiling amiably, pride in his voice, ‘‘and you can 
believe me when I say that there never was a more 
surprised individual within two minutes.” 
“Oh! Aye! Now what?” they demanded. 
‘““Why, Roger gets busy same as I’ve taught 
him to do, and Frank Riven goes away a heap 
wiser. No, he doesn’t exactly love Roger Norman. 
Watch him if you want to make sure.” r 
The fact was too apparent to call for argument, 
for the tall youth, who had first come into the view 
of the watchers in the comfortable bay window 
which graced the parlour of the ‘‘ Morning Sun”, 
and who now stood almost directly before them, 
(0 902:)   
 
-P-A-G-E-19
The Village of Hurslet 7 
made no effort to hide his feelings. Tall and sallow, 
and rather inclined to be weedy, one would have said 
of Frank Riven, meeting him in London, that he 
was one of those aimless, and possibly brainless, 
elegants who, before Armageddon began, were to 
be found in that city. Not, it should be added, 
that elegants are necessarily brainless, for have 
not the smart youth of London set up a record in 
this war to make one wonder? But no one would 
have accused Frank Riven of being dashing, or 
keen, or bold, or of bubbling over with patriotism. 
The fact that he still lounged in Hurslet was suffi- 
cient to prove that. Some would undoubtedly have 
suspected him of being faint-hearted, evil-tempered, 
selfish, and utterly unfeeling, while all would have 
agreed as to his overbearing manner. 
‘‘The fellow’s a trouble to me,” Mr. Riven had 
declared to Dr. Norman when the latter had 
dropped in at the Hall, as was his wont every 
Sunday evening. ‘‘He comes to me practically 
a pauper, for my poor brother made a hopeless 
mess of things. But instead of having modest 
ideas of things, this youngster, I find, is inclined 
to be a spendthrift. Work frightens him. He 
won’t lift a finger to help one of the household. 
He’s selfish and quarrelsome, and—and 
‘* And, in short, he’s no good,” added the Doctor 
grimly. 
“Not a bit. I can get him to do nothing useful. 
A young man of his years should have joined the 
army months ago. He doesn’t seem to care what 
is happening in France and elsewhere. He merely 
(0.902) 2  
-P-A-G-E-20
  18 Under Haig in Flanders 
lolls about and—well, quarrels with his neighbours 
and with his surroundings.” 
The Doctor sniffed. ‘‘He needs doctoring,” he 
said, with that same grim smile. 
“ Doctoring!” exclaimed Mr. Riven. ‘‘ But——” 
“But he isn’t ill? Certainly not. Only tired 
with doing nothing, and perhaps with eating too 
many good things. He wants attention in another 
sense. You want to be firm with him.” 
“Ah, yes! To be sure,” mused Mr. Riven. 
Being firm was not, however, in his nature, and 
no one knew that better than did the Doctor. Other- 
wise, would this Frank Riven have continued to 
lounge about the village of Hurslet when all the 
young men of his age were in France, at the 
Dardanelles, in Egypt,—in any case, in the army 
at that moment? 
«© What—what would you do?” asked Mr. Riven. 
“Do!” said the Doctor, his eyes twinkling. 
“Do what Roger did. Give this young lout a 
lesson!” 
‘Ah, yes! I agree; he deserved the thrashing 
Roger gave him. But—er—how——?” 
‘“‘Cut off his pocket-money. Send him about his 
business. Invite him to earn his own living.” 
Earn his own living indeed! Frank Riven was 
the last to attempt to do that. For years a weak 
father had allowed him to do as he desired, and, 
now that he was gone, Frank was sufficiently sharp 
to discover at once that his uncle was much as his 
father had been. Almost from the first he had 
defied him.
-P-A-G-E-21
  The Village of Hurslet 19 
“Join the army!” he had guffawed, when once 
Mr. Riven had summoned up sufficient courage to 
mention the matter, ‘Bea soldier? No, thanks! 
Not while there are other fellows who like the job 
and are willing to do it. Thanks, I’ll stay on here! 
Hurslet suits me.” 
If the village suited Frank Riven, he in any 
case did not exactly command the good feeling of 
its inhabitants. That fracas with Roger had not 
added to his reputation, while the very whisper 
that he had been rough with his cousin had in- 
censed the whole of Hurslet, Finally, the villagers 
objected to a lout, dressed in foppish attire, who 
swaggered amongst them when already the best of 
their sons had joined the army. 
“He don’t half scowl, oh no!” grinned one of 
the watchers in the window. ‘‘And—and young 
Roger only just smiles at him, Seems to me that 
afore very long there’ll be another ruction yonder. 
Well, the little lady don’t object to his attentions, 
and that’s saying something.” 
More than one of the inmates of the parlour ex- 
changed glances. Gossip in a village leaves very 
little to imagination, and settles most things, small 
and sundry. Long since it had settled the affairs 
of the younger generation at the Hall and the 
Dene. 
“It’s only jest natural, ain’t it? Muster Roger, 
as fine a young chap as you can drop eyes on, ’ill 
be a-walking along with Missy Riven one of these 
fine days. Ofcourse, of course.” And many wise 
old heads had nodded. 1
-P-A-G-E-22
  20 Under Haig in Flanders 
Frank Riven, too, had somehow or other thought 
of the same thing. Or perhaps he had overheard 
local gossip. In any case, he had decided that 
Roger was an upstart, from the very moment when 
he first came to his uncle’s house and there met 
that young fellow. 
“And wants a deal of watching too,” he told 
himself sourly. ‘‘Too friendly here by a long way. 
I’ll have to deal with that chap sharply.” 
His first attempt had not been a success. Yet 
Frank Riven was not to be easily beaten: His 
first dislike of Roger had been inflamed tenfold by 
the chastisement he had received, and the flame of 
his hate was smouldering. It made him writhe to 
meet Roger. It made him grind his teeth to watch 
the pretty smile with which his cousin Elsie greeted 
him, and now, as Roger relieved that little lady ot 
the burden which Frank should have carried, it 
made the latter positively stamp with anger. Mut- 
tering, he turned away, leaving Roger to escort his 
cousin. 
“Oh, Frank,” she called after him, ‘‘do come 
too!” 
But that fuming person marched off, head in air, 
trembling with passion, while Elsie stared after 
him, her face clouded. 
“Come along, dear,” said Roger, taking her 
gently by the arm. ‘Don’t take any notice. He’s 
out of sorts. Now where can I carry this basket 
for you?” 
Twenty pair of inquisitive eyes watched the 
couple as they passed down the street to halt at/
-P-A-G-E-23
  The Village of Hurslet 21 
Widow Plunket’s, where good things were taken 
from the basket and Elsie vanished within the 
widow’s cottage on an errand of mercy. Twenty 
pair of somewhat resentful orbs followed the scowl- 
ing form of Frank Riven. 
‘He ain’t no good, that there lout,” voiced the 
general opinion. ‘‘I ain’t often seen a chap scowl 
same as he done, and then only in his cups. He 
don’t mean no good to that young Roger. And 
I'll tell yer why. He’s just jealous. He wants our 
Roger to hands off with Miss Elsie, as if Roger 
and the lady was thinking o’ marriage in these 
times, and they only yet boy and gal. But that 
there swaggerin’ feller’s got a game to play. Folks 
say as he’s nigh a pauper. Well, he don’t work, 
do he? Then what’s he arter?” 
Heads nodded with a vengeance; eyes now 
swung round to the Sergeant. 
“No good,” that individual told them with em- 
phasis. ‘‘That Frank’s a hound. No gentleman 
would have scowled and behaved as he did just 
now before a lady. I don’t like his looks. I'll 
just warn our Roger.” 
Yet would a simple warning suffice, and was 
this Frank Riven really capable of injuring Roger? 
Only the future could decide that point, and the 
future was indeed to open the eyes of Hurslet’s 
villagers widely.
-P-A-G-E-24
CHAPTER II 
A Catastrophe 
4 
PRECISELY three weeks after the meeting in Hurs- 
let’s single street, which we have just recorded, 
Roger set out for the Hall to pay a farewell visit, 
for on the morrow he was to return to school for 
his last term. 
‘‘Of course, there’s no reason why you should 
leave then,” his father, the worthy doctor, told him 
as they sat over a late supper the night before. 
“But, then, you may like to.” 
“IT certainly should, Father,” Roger replied. 
“‘T shall be eighteen years of age in the middle of 
the term, and that’s the recognized or legal age for 
enlistment. I shall join up next hols. Have you 
any objection?” 
‘‘None whatever,” his father ejaculated, though, 
to tell the truth, it was with a qualm, for the Doctor 
was a widower and Roger was his all. ‘‘ None 
whatever,” he repeated, with emphasis this time. 
“‘Of course I would have given anything could 
you have left school and pursued your studies at 
a hospital, for it has been agreed that you will 
follow in my steps, and practise one of these days 
in the village of Hurslet. But there—the thing’s 
22
-P-A-G-E-25
  
A Catastrophe 23 
impossible. In these days we must consider our 
country before everything. You will join up. God 
protect you, my dear fellow!” 
Thus it was a recognized plan that Roger should 
return to school for his last term, and it was onlv 
a matter of habit and of custom which took hit — 
away to the Hall to say farewell, for he never 
neglected that little attention. 
“Tl be back by seven o’clock,” he told his 
father as he was leaving the Dene. ‘Mr. Riven 
is always engaged with letters after that hour, so 
that I should only be in the way if I stayed longer.” 
“Ha! Going to the Hall, sir?” ejaculated tue 
gallant Sergeant when Roger peeped in at the 
“Morning Sun” to say farewell to his instructor. 
‘And this is the last term, eh, Mr. Roger.. Well, 
there’s many a worse spot than the army, and many 
a fine fellow has joined it.” 
It was perhaps only natural that he drew himself 
up at attention at that moment and coughed huskily. 
“‘T don’t regret the day that I upped sticks and 
accepted the shilling. It made a man of me, Mr. 
Roger; at least I hope so, and it’ll do no harm to 
you, though I’m not saying that you haven’t manly 
ways already. Well, you're off to the Hall. Good- 
bye and good luck, Mr. Roger!” 
“Going up to the Hall,” he repeated as he re- 
turned to the bright little parlour in which we first 
introduced him to the reader. ‘‘To say good-bye 
to the folks there. A fine young fellow.” 
‘¢There’s more than Muster Riven as’ll be sorry a” that he’s a-leavin’,” came from one of the parlour
-P-A-G-E-26
  
  24 Under Haig in Flanders 
cronies. ‘‘Mind what we've a-said afore. The 
missie’ll be cryin’ her eyes out one o’ these fine days 
when young Roger’s took to khaki.” 
“Only, then that there cousin o’ hers ‘ill be 
smilin’,”’ added another. ‘‘Unless he’s took. 
Folks do say as there’ll be conscription, when every 
fit man’ll have to go. A good day I says! My 
two lads went right at the very beginnin’, ’cos of 
them ’ere butchers o’ Germans. One’sdead. They 
killed him at Ypres, so I’ve given something. 
Why shouldn’t every man make his gift. Bring in 
conscription, I say, and the sooner the better.” 
They watched the active strides of Roger as he 
went up the street, and saw him gain the top of the 
hill. Then, as dusk was falling, they drew the 
settle closer about the fire, which was a feature of 
the parlour of this friendly village hostelry, and 
continued to gossip. Roger bounded up the hill, 
gained the Hall, and knocked loudly for admission. 
A smiling maid answered the call, smiling because 
Roger was a favourite, and at once showed him 
into the drawing-room. 
‘‘And I'd as soon he come as any others,” she 
told them in the kitchen on her return. ‘‘ Master 
Roger’s welcome every time here, and by all of us. 
Leastwise, not by that young cousin.” 
“Then it’s lucky that he’s out. Gone to the 
town,” the cook told them. ‘Yes, you can’t 
expect a stuck-up prig to like the lad that’s given 
him a beating, so it’s as well he’s out o’ the way. 
What's he a-doin’ out of the village? What's he 
go to the town for so often?”
-P-A-G-E-27
  A Catastrophe 25 
What, indeed! It was one of the many things 
which were worrying the gentle and somewhat weak 
Mr. Riven. Frank had come to his house months 
ago as a mere starveling, and had been received out 
of pure charity, and because he was a relative with- 
out friends and without means of subsistence. As 
has been stated, he had almost at once taken the 
measure of his weak and indulgent uncle, and for 
long now had done as he liked, had sulked or been 
sourly gay as suited his feelings for the moment, 
and of late had been remarkable more for his ab- 
sence than for his presence. Those who marketed 
in the adjacent town spoke of seeing him often in 
a hotel of/none too good reputation, while village 
heads wagged, and men whispered to one another 
that Frank Riven’s acquaintances were none too 
excellent. 
‘‘There’s. a down-at-heels. fellow that he’s been 
seen with. Who’s he?” people demanded. 
““Who’s he? Aye!” the knowing ones re- 
sponded. 
Little, as a matter of fact, was known, but that 
little was not to Frank’s credit. On this very 
evening, indeed, he was strutting down the darken- 
ing road which led to Hurslet, with that down-at- 
heel individual stumbling along beside him, their 
heads close together—far closer, indeed, than the 
haughty Frank would have cared for on ordinary 
occasions, but now it seemed there was need for 
secrecy, and to guard against people overhear- 
ing. 
‘A “fiver’,” the shambling man at his side whis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  26 Under Haig in Flanders 
pered hoarsely. ‘‘ Bless us, it’s cheap! and there’s 
lots wouldn’t do it for that much. A ‘fiver’ down, 
and if the thing comes off, another—eh? Dirt cheap, 
dirt cheap!” : 
“Dirt cheap!” ejaculated Frank, raising his voice 
a trifle in his indignation. 
“Hush! D’yer want to tell the neighbours? Dirt 
cheap, of course! Look here, young Mr. Riven— 
there’s some as wouldn’t call yer mister if they 
knew the game yer was up to—if yer afraid to do 
a thing like this yerself, yer’ve got to pay for it. 
Ain’t it worth it to yer? Don’t I know the reason? 
Wasn’t I there when he gave yer the drummin’? 
My eye!—that lad can use his fists! I’d be sorry 
to have to be the one to stand up to him! And 
you thought you was goin’ to give him a hiding 
yerself when you laid on to him with that stick of 
yours. Lor’! I thought you meant to break every 
bone in his blessed body, and then he ups, and, 
afore you can look round, yer seein’ stars—thou- 
sands of ’em!” 
Frank Riven gnashed his teeth and struck the 
ground savagely with his stick, almost more sav- 
agely than on the occasion when he had struck 
young Roger Norman. The grating voice at his 
ear irritated him beyond words, and the reminder 
the cunning wretch had given him increased his 
determination to revenge himself upon the one who 
had caused him so great humiliation. Never fora 
moment had Frank Riven forgotten Roger and the 
debt he owed him. Boy only though Roger was, 
though just arriving at the stage of budding man- 
| ‘  
-P-A-G-E-29
  A Catastrophe 27 
hood, yet this evil-minded youth had raised him 
to the position of a rival—a hated rival. 
Forgetting that he himself, living at the Hall, 
might, by.good conduct, by pleasant manners, in 
a hundred different ways, win the esteem and 
liking of his uncle and his fair cousin, he behaved 
like a bear there—sometimes worse—and put his 
want of popularity at the Hall, both with the 
servants and with his uncle and cousin, down 
entirely to our hero. 
It was an utterly unreasonable position he took 
up, of course, yet was not Frank Riven already 
proved to be an unreasonable and boorish indi- 
vidual? That first attempt of his, the thrashing 
he had received for the blow he had given Roger, 
the latter’s equanimity ever since, his friendly 
smile, his obvious desire to live on good terms 
with Frank, had only incensed the latter; and now 
this ruffian at his side prodded him, as it were, 
spurred him on, increased his anger and his desire 
for revenge. 
‘“My!—a fine young fighting-cock!” the rascal 
grunted. ‘Owed it all to Sergeant Higgins—no, 
not all, for I tell you he’s a good plucked ’un, and 
he’ll want a lot of beating. Dirt cheap, I tells yer. 
Down with the brass, or—or what's to prevent me 
jawin’? I might go down to Hurslet now, and 
shout that there’s a young chap, livin’ like a swell 
at the Hall, wanting to cut the throat of Roger 
Norman—to cut his throat—not in the open, believe 
me, but secret like, when he wasn’t looking.” 
Frank Riven gritted his teeth together, his eyes
-P-A-G-E-30
    28 Under Haig in Flanders 
were blazing, though the darkness hid that rather 
unpleasant feature; he kicked the ground and again 
struck it savagely. 
“Done!” he exclaimed, searching in an inner 
pocket. ‘‘Done!—done with you!” 
Handing out a note to the miscreant, he walked 
with him, feeling at the same moment that he 
would like to throttle the fellow. Then for a few 
minutes he fell to trembling, for what if this rascal 
did as he had threatened? 
Frank Riven realized now that he was practically 
in his hands. For a long time he had been think- 
ing out a scheme which would give him revenge 
over Norman; but not once had he thought that it 
would recoil upon his own head. He had diligently 
sought for this ruffian who now accompanied him, 
and thought that money alone would buy him. A 
little more knowledge of the world would have 
taught this insufferable young fellow that money 
alone will not buy even a rascal, and that the con- 
spiracy he was hatching—had now almost brought 
to fruition indeed—was as dangerous to himself 
perhaps as it was likely to be to his promised 
victim. 
“Done!” the fellow at his side exclaimed, and 
the two went on their way towards Hurslet in 
silence, till in fact the lights of the Hall were 
sighted. Then, as if they were a signal, they 
came to a standstill. \ 
“You know what to do—you wait till I am in- 
side, then ? 
“Go on! I ain’t a baby!” the man exclaimed,   
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  A Catastrophe 29 
crumpling the note at the bottom of a pocket in his 
tattered coat. ‘‘It ain’t the first job of this sort 
that I’ve worked. You go on in; but mind you, a 
‘fiver’ when the job’s done—no waitin’—a ‘fiver’ 
down—and then mum’s the word! You can trust 
me for ever!” 
Anyone who had been able to see the rascal’s 
face at that moment would have hesitated to trust 
him for one single instant, and would certainly 
never have thought of reposing confidence in him 
once he was at a distance. Close at hand in the 
broad daylight he would have been a man to be- 
ware of; in the dark, skulking along in the shadows, 
ready to work some sort of infamy, the man was 
dangerous. And when this infamy had been per- 
petrated, and perhaps Roger Norman had been 
injured, would Frank Riven be able to buy the 
silence of this rascal for a mere five pounds—for 
five golden sovereigns—of the liberal allowance 
which his uncle allowed him? Was it likely in- 
deed? Already this ruffian was gloating over the 
possible future. 
“When it is done,” he chuckled hoarsely, as he 
stumbled off into the darkness after Frank had 
bidden him farewell, ‘‘ when all the noise has died 
down, and the perlice has given the thing up as a 
job that’s beyond ’em, that’s when I come in again. 
Just about then the £5 will be gone, and I'll be 
wanting more, because money don’t grow on trees 
and hedges. Oh yes!—he’ll pay up, and pay up 
jolly well too! And if he don’t——!” 
The man’s grimy fist closed about the note 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
    30 Under Haig in Flanders 
secreted at the bottom of the pocket in his tattered 
jacket, and he grinned a grin which would have 
made Frank Riven shiver. 
Meanwhile Roger, whistling as he went, had 
made his way up the village street of Hurslet, 
past those straggling houses, and so to the Hall 
crowning the top of the hill, where he had been 
welcomed as an old friend should be welcomed; 
and now, as Frank Riven’s heavy tread was heard 
in the hall, he was saying farewell to the friends he 
had come to visit. 
‘‘Good-bye then, Roger, my boy,” said Mr. 
Riven, gripping his hand, while with his disen- 
gaged fingers he slipped an envelope into Roger’s 
pocket—for that was one of the pleasant little things 
that Mr. Riven never neglected. 
Not that Roger was mean enough to come to the 
Hall on an apparent visit, before going back to 
school, with the one object of receiving that en- 
velope. Indeed, he had protested on more than 
one occasion. But Mr. Riven had been a boy 
himself, and had not yet forgotten the days of 
his boyhood, and therefore never allowed Roger 
to return to school without a handsome addition 
to his financial resources. 
‘*Good-bye, and good luck! It’s the last term— 
eh, Roger? In three months’ time you'll be joining 
up as a soldier, and before you can look round 
you'll perhaps be in France fighting these Ger- 
mans. Good luck, lad!” : 
Elsie shook the hand of her hero—for Roger was 
that without a doubt—with a warmness which she
-P-A-G-E-33
  
A Catastrophe 31 
took no trouble to hide. Indeed, the warmth of her 
affection was shown by her flashing eyes, while this 
timid little girl was almost trembling, for she was 
thinking of the near future. 
‘‘Good-bye! See you when I come home again,” 
called Roger, as he went through the hall, past 
Frank, who stood aloof and haughty, and so out 
into the garden. Then, whistling gaily, he trudged 
on to the road and turned towards the village. 
Meanwhile, what of that ruffian who had stood 
still and let the sneaking Frank Riven move on to 
and enter the Hall? The darkness hid his features, 
hid the hideous grin which he had turned in the 
direction of his employer. If it had been broad 
daylight a man coming along the road just then 
might have recognized in this rascal the shambling, 
evil-looking fellow who haunted the market square 
of the adjacent town, and stood about corners and 
in the doorways of public-houses—a man dressed 
in tattered and torn raiment, down at heels, bleary 
of face, unshaven and unprepossessing, yet a stur- 
dily built rascal, square-shouldered, deep-chested, 
and, as one could see, when one came to peer 
into his face, a man possessed of some determina- 
tion. In short, had this fellow been educated and 
brought up amidst decent surroundings in a decent 
home he might have been quite a respectable mem- 
ber of society. But his father had died when he 
was a lad, and his mother many years before. The 
boy had been dragged up, had been subjected to 
every sort of evil influence, had lived his life in the 
gutter, one may say; and here was the result—a
-P-A-G-E-34
  32 Under Haig in Flanders 
dissolute rascal, ready for any infamy so long as it 
brought him money and the wherewithal to slake 
an almost perpetual thirst. 
“That's ’is door a-goin’!” he exclaimed, as he 
saw a beam of light sweep from the front of the 
Hall, which Frank Riven was just then entering. 
“A sweet young man that; and don’t he hate 
tother! Well, if I was asked to choose, it’s not 
Frank Riven that I’d ask for. T’other’s a lad with, 
spirit and pluck and strength. Yes, I wouldn’t 
like to have to stand up to him in broad daylight. 
But this ain’t broad daylight.” 
He put a couple of dirty finger-tips to his mouth 
and sent forth a shrill whistle, repeating it twice, 
then he walked into the middle of the road and 
waited. Presently there came shambling towards 
him another individual much like himself—an 
habitué of the market square and the public-houses 
in the adjacent town, a rascal almost’ more un- 
savoury than this first individual. 
“Ha! you’ve come, and just at the very moment 
that you’re wanted. I’ve got the money,” said the 
first. ‘‘Come on! Now you know the trick to be 
played. We’re paid to give this young chap a 
hiding; and mind, it’s got to be a good ’un! You 
won’t bother about that, eh? ’cos everyone knows 
you’ve got a grievance against him.” 
That was a cunning move on the part of this 
rascal whom Frank Riven had engaged to carry 
out nefarious work for him. He had selected as 
his assistant a man whom Roger had quite uncon- 
sciously offended. To be sure, the lad was in no

““HE STRUCK RIGHT 
THE FACE OF ONE OF THE BULLI 
 
-P-A-G-E-36

-P-A-G-E-37
  
A Catastrophe 33 
way to blame himself, for quite unwittingly he had 
detected this man in the very act of thieving, and 
information he had given had led to his arrest. 
That was two years before, but Ern, as the rascal 
was called, had never forgiven or forgotten. 
“T know,” he said. ‘Come on! I’ve just been 
waiting for this business. This is a job that suits 
me downright. You can take it stright from me 
that if I get a hold on that kid [ll trounce him. 
I'll beat him within an inch of his life, s'welp me! 
within an inch of his blessed life.” 
The door opened again, and another broad beam 
_ of light was shot across the road, while silhouetted 
against it for some few brief seconds was the active, 
sturdy, rapidly-moving figure of Roger Norman. 
A minute later he had plunged into the darkness, 
the door had banged, and he and those two rascals 
were left practically alone in the neighbourhood. 
Stealthily and rapidly they went after him, while 
he, gay and boyish and light-hearted, stepped 
along, whistling loudly, thereby drowning any 
sounds they might have made. 
It was perhaps five minutes later, when Roger 
had come to a point almost opposite the ‘‘Morning 
Sun”, through whose cosy red-curtained windows a 
comforting and inviting ray of light was shining, 
that those two behind suddenly flung themselves 
upon our hero. A stick thudded on the ground 
beside him; for Ern, eager to have revenge, was 
the first to commence the attack, and, missing his 
aim in the semi-light, lurched forward, while his 
stick, jarring against the ground, was torn from 
(c 902) 3
-P-A-G-E-38
  34 Under Haig in Flanders 
his hand. Then the other rascal bounced to the 
front, and, swinging his arm round, caught Roger 
a clout on the side of the head which sent him 
flying. 
“Now then, get in, get in, Ern!” he called. 
‘Take it out of him in the next minute, for by then 
people round will be alarmed and will be interfer- 
ing.” 
It was lucky for Roger that that comforting beam 
of light did happen to emerge from the curtained 
windows of the ‘‘Morning Sun”, for otherwise no 
doubt these two rascals would have overborne him. 
As it was, the clout sent him staggering, and then 
spurred him to action and woke him up from the 
pleasant dreams in which he had been indulging a 
moment earlier. Then, as he looked up, he saw 
two figures between himself and that light, men 
whose arms whirled and who were rushing towards 
him. Just as unconsciously as he took in every 
breath, he sprang into a position of defence, and 
hardly had the men reached him when he struck 
right and left, getting one fist home well on the 
face of one of the bullies. 
“‘He’s gone down! That wasa straight’un! Now 
for the other!” 
Unable to understand why he should be so at- 
tacked, and taking these two men for footpads, 
Roger saw one of them stagger and fall, and then 
he rushed in at the other and dealt him swinging 
blows till, turning suddenly, the fellow bolted. 
Then Roger looked up. 
“No one in sight! Not a sound! Goodness,
-P-A-G-E-39
  A Catastrophe 35 
what an éxtraordinary thing to happen! Who 
were they? Why did they want to turn upon me 
like that? And—and, that fellow hasn’t moved!— 
I can see him in the light cast from the Sergeant’s 
windows. Stunned, I suppose—let’s look. He’s— 
he’s dead—dead!” gasped Roger, as he knelt be- 
side the man and first took his grimy hand and 
then lifted his head. 
Both fell back helpless, the man stopped breath- 
ing, his limbs were flaccid. Even when Roger 
pulled his frowzy vest open and put his hand over 
his heart there was not a movement to be felt. 
“Dead!” he said, as he sat up gasping, while 
blood dripped from his face. ‘‘I—I killed him! 
I—I—and no one saw it—no one’s yet been round. 
I—what am I to do? No one would believe that 
I’d been set on by two people, and had killed one 
and driven the other off. It’s—I—good heavens! 
what an awful position!” 
He clapped one clammy hand to his cold fore- 
head and shuddered. He was trembling all over 
now, not because of the attack made upon him and 
the reaction that often follows excessive action or 
some shock, but because of the other feeling that 
now possessed him. To have killed a man was 
awful—dreadful! It scared Roger. He seized that 
hand again and pulled at the arm, as though he 
thought that would awake the individual stretched 
so helplessly on the road. He looked, and, yes, 
horror of horrors! a little pool of blood was collect- 
ing by the man’s head, pouring from one ear. 
Perspiration dropped from his forehead; he rose 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  36 Under Haig in Flanders 
to his feet, his head in a whirl, and staggered away, 
staggered along the street hardly knowing where 
he was going or for what reason. ‘Dead! I killed 
him! There will be an inquiry! It’s a frightful 
position. What am I to do? I can’t go back to 
school with a thing like that on my conscience. I 
can’t stand an inquiry, where people will point 
their fingers at me and say that I, known for my 
boxing in these parts, set on a man and killed him. 
It’s I'll go!” 
Let those who would blame Roger Norman, who 
would denounce him for not remaining ‘in Hurslet 
and ‘‘facing the music”—the inquiry which would 
follow the outcome of the attempt these two ruffians 
had made upon him—recollect that he was still only 
a boy, though on the threshold of manhood. Other 
young fellows had been scared out of their wits and 
driven to take desperate steps under less strenuous 
conditions. It was wrong, no doubt; it was cowardly, 
perhaps; it was essentially a stupid action. Yet 
Roger, with that awful figure lying dead in the 
road always before him, crept back to the Dene, 
packed a bag, hurriedly wrote a short line to his 
father, and then went off into the darkness.  
-P-A-G-E-41
CHAPTER III 
Making Friends 
RoGER Norman stopped at the threshold of his 
. father’s house for one brief moment, and, pulling 
his watch from his pocket, looked at the time. It 
was just half-past eight. 
“That settles it,” he said, as he thrust the watch 
back and picked up his bag. ‘‘A train leaves the 
town at 9.15 and goes on to London; I'll travel by 
that, and decide what to do later.” 
As was his wont, he crossed the front lawn of the 
Dene at a rapid pace, went through the gate and 
out on to the road. Then, turning sharply to the 
right, he began his tramp through the deserted 
village of Hurslet. A second later he came to a 
brief halt. 
“Couldn’t do it,” he told himself, mopping the 
perspiration from his brow. 
For of a sudden that solitary figure lying in the 
dust before the ‘‘ Morning Sun”, with the friendly 
light from the red-curtained window streaming 
gently down upon him, rose before Roger’s brain. 
“Dead!” he told himself again; ‘‘and I killed 
him—awful!” 
Like a thief in the night he crept off into a quiet 
37
-P-A-G-E-42
  38 Under Haig in Flanders 
lane which zigzagged behind the village, and, tak- 
ing to his heels, fled along as if fearful that some- 
one was chasing him. At the far end he came out 
at the top of the hill just beyond the Hall, and, 
gaining the road, tramped steadily along it. Sud- 
denly a figure hove in sight, and a lamp was 
flashed in his face. 
“‘Ah—you! Where away then, Mr. Roger?” 
Roger was taken aback by the sudden summons, 
for the policeman had been riding along the road 
without a lamp, and now the light which he turned 
upon this passenger whom he had met was froma 
covered lantern. If Roger had felt like a thief— 
like a murderer—before, as indeed he did, he now 
felt suddenly desperate. It was only with the 
greatest effort that he could answer. 
‘Why, where away, Sergeant?—Oh, I’m going 
off to the town to buy something.” 
‘“‘Buy something!” ejaculated the constable, 
‘and it’s getting on towards nine! Why, that’s 
a strange move, Mr. Roger; shops will be closed, 
won’t they?” 
‘“‘Er—not mine, Sergeant,” Roger answered. 
‘*Good-night.” 
“‘Good-night, lad.” 
‘Now, what's all that mean?” the sergeant asked 
himself, as he stood on the high road, holding 
on to his bicycle, his dark lantern still turned 
on and illuminating his immediate surroundings. 
“Looked scared he did—looked properly frightened 
—as if he’d done something he was ashamed of. 
But not he. Roger Norman ain’t that class of
-P-A-G-E-43
Making Friends 39 
young fellow. Now, if it had been that young 
Frank Riven I’d have been suspicious, and would 
think strongly of following. But no, there’s been 
an upset of some sort, some trifling thing. Roger’s 
a straight ’un!” 
If he could have got into Roger's brain and read 
his thoughts he would have been greatly puzzled. 
No doubt this honest sergeant would have taken 
the lad by the hand, have persuaded him to tell his 
story, and would then and there have given him 
most excellent advice, with the result that our hero 
would have stayed in Hurslet to ‘‘ face the music”. 
But it was too late now; for once out of sight 
and, as he hoped, out of sound, Roger took to 
his heels like a hunted hare and bolted along the 
road. 
“That alters my plans,” he told himself, sitting 
down and panting after a while. ‘‘The sergeant 
recognized me. I know my manner was strange 
when he turned that lamp on; I know my lips 
were trembling, and he’s sure to have spotted that. 
Then immediately the hue and cry is raised in 
Hurslet, he’ll remember our meeting, and will set 
off in this direction to find me. That settles it!” 
The sergeant would have been doubly surprised 
could he have seen Roger a little later, for, picking 
up his bag, our hero returned along the road, and, 
once more getting into that lane, gained his father’s 
house without meeting a single person. Then he 
took his bicycle from the yard, mounted it just 
outside the garden wall, and sped off in precisely 
the opposite direction to that which he had first
-P-A-G-E-44
  40 Under Haig in Flanders 
taken. Half an hour later he arrived at a large 
village some three miles away, and wheeling his 
bicycle into a thick patch of trees, where it was 
hardly likely to be easily discovered, he left it there 
and pushed on to the station. The train which 
entered shortly after bore him up towards the 
north of England. 
“Hallo!” said someone in the carriage which 
he had entered. ‘‘Going north? and all alone? 
So’m I—that’s good business!” 
Roger looked up sharply, suspiciously; for he 
now had fears of everyone. 
“Yes,” he said abruptly, ‘‘ going north—and 
alone!” 
He noticed that the man who had spoken was 
only a young fellow after all, perhaps only two 
years older than himself. He was a pleasant, 
sandy-haired fellow with a bright open face and 
a frank laugh which attracted Roger instantly. 
“And you?” he asked, encouraged by the appear- 
ance of his fellow-passenger. 
“Me! Oh, me!” said the youth, dragging a 
cigarette from a packet and proceeding to light it. 
‘‘Well, I was doing a job down south, don’t you 
know, and had taken on a contract. It’s up now, 
and I’m returning north to my people. Then I 
move on again. I’m going to take on with the 
‘Derby’ lot.” 
‘Become a soldier?” asked Roger eagerly. 
“Aye, become a soldier. I’d have done it 
months ago but for this contract. The war is 
going to be a long one, sonny, and so I said to
-P-A-G-E-45
  Making Friends 4u 
myself, first finish the job you’re at, and when you 
are ready there'll be heaps of room for you and for 
many who come after. What about you? You 
don’t look quite the age yet, only, of course, there’s 
many a chap younger than you that’s joined up. 
Some of the youngsters are so full of keenness you 
can’t keep ’em back, and they do tell me many of 
‘em have made good over yonder.” 
“‘Made good over yonder!” Roger’s hands were 
clenched, his finger-nails dug into his sweating 
palms. If only he could ‘‘make good”; if only 
he could quite wipe out the horrible deed perpe- 
trated but recently. He did not stop to think, and 
never had yet since the tragedy, that it was not his 
fault that he had been set upon, and that all he had 
done was to strike in self-defence. He had killed 
a man; that was the overmastering thought that 
filled his brain. He must flee from justice, and 
must wipe out the awful disgrace which had fallen 
upon him. 
“1,” he stuttered, ‘‘I—I’m going to be a soldier 
too. That's why I’m travelling north.” 
“North?” queried the other. ‘‘ But you belong 
hereabouts! You’rea gent. Anyone could see that. 
Chaps like you go to their local depots to recruit, 
or at any rate up to London. ‘You're the stamp of 
chap that’s made into an officer. Why? I don’t 
understand! What’s behind it?” 
He puffed a cloud of smoke in Roger’s direction 
and glanced inquisitively at him, though he smiled 
all the while—a friendly smile. ‘‘ Something 
funny,” he was telling himself, ‘something queer
-P-A-G-E-46
  42 Under Haig in Flanders 
behind this. Troubles at home, eh? Someone’s 
been driving him out—some sort of domestic 
worry. Nothing else, I’ll swear; for he’s a fine, 
clean-looking young fellow.” 
“T say,” he began aloud. “Of course I’m not 
the one to ask why you want to go as a soldier 
—everyone wants to be a soldier nowadays who’s 
anything of a man, and you'll be that soon, though 
I should take you now to be barely eighteen years 
of age. But why shouldn’t we go along together? 
What d’you know? What’s your trade? Oh, of 
course, you’ve not got a trade. Be honest; you 
go to a public school, don’t you?” 
“T do,” Roger answered at once and quite 
frankly. ‘‘I——” 
“Look here,” said the young fellow, sliding 
along the seat until he was almost opposite our 
hero, ‘‘why not tell me what it’s all about? Any- 
one can see from a glance that you’re all of a flurry, 
that something’s happened to upset you. Trust in 
a fellow! I won’t go back on you whatever the 
tale is, though I’m sure it can’t be bad. I’m not 
very old, I know, and so you might think twice 
before confiding in me. But I’m a square one, 
like you, I am. D?’you believe it?” 
Roger did. He looked up, and the two sat for 
a while staring into one another’s eyes as if trying 
to read the other’s character; then Roger stretched 
out a hand. 
“T trust you,” he said. ‘I'll tell you the 
story.” 
For a while he sat gripping the edge of the seat,
-P-A-G-E-47
  
Making Friends 43 
trying to control his emotion; for, to tell the truth, 
he was within an ace of breaking down. That 
awful tragedy had indeed almost unnerved him; 
the knowledge that he had killed a man had driven 
him wellnigh frantic. It would be a vast relief to 
get someone to share his story. Even if this 
young fellow were to condemn him, yet it would 
be a relief to open his lips and talk about the 
matter. 
“I_I’m bolting from home!” he blurted out. 
“Aye, bolting from home. Well, there’s many 
done it before, and many will do it in the future,” 
came the sympathetic answer, while, as if not to 
embarrass Roger too much, the young fellow leaned 
back and stared up at the roof, towards which 
he puffed energetic clouds of smoke. ‘‘ Bolting 
from home,” he went on; ‘‘ that’s not a great thing 
to worry about in these days. You'll get your 
troubles smoothed out later, and will return to the 
old folks. Every decent fellow does that. Well, 
what next? You needn’t tell me what the bother 
was about. You'll think better of the folks at home 
when a few more hours have passed, and when 
you’ve cooled down a trifle.” 
“Tt isn’t that,” Roger told him, taking him by 
the sleeve and almost shaking him. ‘T’m—I’m 
bolting because I’ve killed a man!” 
“Oh, oh!” exclaimed the fellow- passenger; 
“killed a man! That’s something!” 
Even he took a deep breath, and it was quite 
clear that he was thoroughly astonished, almost 
dismayed. He took his eyes from the roof of the
-P-A-G-E-48
  44 Under Haig in Flanders 
carriage, and fixed them askance on Roger, and 
even sidled a little farther away so as not to be 
exactly opposite him. 
“Killed a man! My word!—murdered a man, 
d’you mean? Look here, youngster, I’m Bill 
Andrews; blurt out the whole story. If you’re a 
murderer you go to the police at the first station 
we stop at. That ’ud be my duty. If you ain’t, 
and you've just killed a man in some sort of way 
that I can’t at the moment fathom, then we can 
talk the thing over. What’s the tale?” 
Roger pulled himself together with an effort, and 
gave his story in a few short trembling sentences, 
while Bill Andrews sat looking at him more directly, 
and, as the tale went on, tipped his billycock hat 
farther back on his head, ran his grubby fingers 
through his yellow locks, and then began mopping 
his forehead. At length he brought one brawny 
hand down with a thwack first upon his own knee 
and then upon Roger’s, and set to laughing. 
“IT can see the whole thing,” he said, gripping 
Roger’s knee in a most confiding and reassuring 
manner. ‘‘ You were set on to by these chaps, 
and of course they had a reason, though what it 
is neither you nor I perhaps can fathom; perhaps 
they mistook you for someone else, because young- 
sters same as you are not likely to have much — 
money. Anyway they set on you and you killed 
one of ’em. Well, serve him right!” 
“Serve him right!” gasped Roger utterly as- 
tonished. 
“Aye, serve him right! He got his deserts!
-P-A-G-E-49
Making Friends 45 
And that’s all about it. Mind, youngster, I’m not 
saying that you shouldn’t have stayed behind at 
home and seen this thing through. There'll be an 
inquiry, of course. There'll be some bigwig or 
other in your neighbourhood sitting on the bench 
asking heaps of questions, and the police and all 
sorts of other people standing round and making 
themselves more or less disagreeable. You should 
have faced all that.” 
“But—” began Roger, protesting, ‘if I 
had——” 
Bill Andrews stopped him abruptly, lifting one 
grimy hand. 
“There’s no ‘but’ about it,” he said, ‘“‘you 
ought to have stayed. You ought to go back there 
now, and face it out. Why not? But no, you can’t, 
for this train don’t stop for more than an hour, and 
by then we shall be in the Midlands.” 
Bill Andrews, the fresh-looking, honest young 
workman, who had already made such an impres- 
sion on Roger, wrinkled his brow, and pushed his 
hat still farther back on his head. Then he became 
lost for quite a little time in a species of brown 
study, staring sometimes at the floor, then at the 
ceiling, and, later, straight into the face of the 
young fellow seated before him. A little later he 
commenced to mutter. 
“Clean look about the chap—one of the public- 
schoolboy sort! I know ’em! And sometimes 
they’ve irritated me. But they’ve got grit and go, 
and they’ve made fine officers. They’ve shown 
that they can fight through difficulties, and there
-P-A-G-E-50
  46 Under Haig in Flanders 
ain’t a shadow of doubt about it. Why shouldn’t 
he fight the thing out himself?” 
‘*See here, me lad,” he suddenly exclaimed, 
speaking quite aloud this time, and once more 
bringing his hand down with a bang on Roger’s 
knee, ‘‘ you’ve made a mess of this here business.” 
Roger could do no more than nod his head in 
agreement. 
‘‘ A wretched mess,” he said sadly. 
“You've behaved just as if you’d killed this chap 
on purpose,” said Bill severely, pointing an in- 
criminating and accusing finger at him. 
“T’ve been a fool!” admitted our hero. ‘I know 
I ought to have stayed, but that fellow lying in the 
road there, so still and breathless, scared the life 
out of my body. I wasn’t afraid of him when he 
was alive, and would have fought him longer if it 
had been necessary; but the fellow dead frightened 
me out of my senses.” 
Bill nodded his head to and fro in the most 
emphatic fashion, and it was plain to see that he 
thoroughly understood Roger’s frame of mind after 
the attack which had been made upon him, and 
sympathized with the most perplexing and awk- 
ward position in which he found himself. 
“T know, I know!” he repeated. ‘‘ Decent 
brought-up chap, quite one of the toffs of the 
village, and never been in any disgraceful scrape 
before, is suddenly discovered street-brawling, and 
kills a man; then flees, afraid of his own shadow. 
Wait!” he suddenly cried. ‘‘ How d’you know he 
was dead? Ever seen a dead man before?”
-P-A-G-E-51
  Making Friends 47 
‘No; but he didn’t move.” 
“Gosh!” shouted Bill. ‘‘Didn’t move indeed! 
Let’s feel your muscles,” and stretching across the 
carriage he gripped Roger’s wrist, and then ran 
his powerful though somewhat dirty fingers up the 
sleeve of his jacket till he reached his biceps. Then 
he took a good look at his square shoulders. 
“Huh!” he laughed derisively; ‘‘you’re pretty 
well built for your age, you are; and if you and 
I was to stand up opposite one another, and you 
was to catch me a clean punch with your fist, and 
I went down, perhaps striking my head on the 
road, d’you think I’d move? I know what you’re 
going to say—blood was coming from his ear. 
That don’t say he was dead, does it? You might 
have cracked his skull, and small blame to you— 
but dead! It takes a good deal to kill a man some- 
times, you know, young fellow.” 
What a weight those words lifted from Roger’s 
mind! He snatched at them as a drowning man 
snatches at a straw, and instantly began to feel 
better. What if the rascal who had fallen upon 
him so suddenly, and whom he had left for dead 
in front of the ‘‘Morning Sun”, were indeed still 
living? What a different complexion it would put 
upon the whole affair, and how easy it would be 
then to shake off the terrible feeling of depression 
which now assailed him! ; 
“Heigh?” asked Bill, almost shouted it. ‘‘Heigh? 
Gosh! to hear a young chap like you thinking he 
knows everything, a-talking to me about dead men 
when he ain’t never yet seen one. Look ’ere, me
-P-A-G-E-52
  48 Under Haig in Flanders 
lad, that man ain’t dead until the police reports it; 
so there now, what d’you say?” 
What Roger had to say was really said with 
particular emphasis on the following morning, 
when, having got out of the train at a certain 
north-country station in the very early hours, they 
invaded the refreshment-room as soon as it was 
opened. Later, Bill opened a morning paper, in- 
tending to read it while he discussed hot coffee and 
a most appetizing breakfast. Five minutes later he 
gave vent to a shout which quite startled a young 
woman in attendance upon them, and grabbed 
Roger by the shoulder with such force that that 
young man imagined himself already arrested. 
“«See here,” said Bill hoarsely, ‘I'll read it to 
you: ‘Midnight affray in the village of Hurslet. We 
are informed by the police that after dark two men 
appear to have made an attack upon the son of a 
local gentleman, well known for his boxing prowess. 
Little information has been obtained as to what fol- 
lowed, but the attack would appear to have been 
beaten off in the most summary manner, and one 
of the ruffians who attacked the youth was left 
apparently dead on the high road. When picked 
up by the police, however, he was found to be 
alive, and is now progressing favourably. A dis- 
tressing part of the affair is that the young man 
attacked, evidently frightened by what had hap- 
pened, left the village hurriedly. His whereabouts 
are sought; the following is his description:— 
And that’s you,” whispered Bill, for it was not 
wise to let anyone else have access to their secret.
-P-A-G-E-53
  Making Friends 49 
“That’s you,” he said, pointing to the descrip- 
tion—‘‘ ‘5 feet 9 inches perhaps, brown hair, boyish 
face, square built, active and sturdy; answers to 
the name of Roger Norman.’” 
“That’s me,” admitted Roger. ‘‘What a relief it 
is to hear that that fellow is really alive!” 
“Roger Norman, look here, lad,” said Bill, 
“d’you mean now to go on with this business, to 
attest and become a soldier?” 
“‘T do,” said Roger resolutely. 
“Then you’ve got to drop the Norman part of 
your name. What’ll you be? What about Sulli- 
van—Roger Sullivan? That’ll do for a time—eh? 
And mark this, you are already cleared; but you're 
starting in with me right down on the lowest rung 
of the military ladder. D’you want to climb? D’you 
want to show those folks at home that there’s real 
good in you? Then here’s your chance; are you 
for it?” 
They went to the local recruiting depot and 
promptly attested. Then they were sent with a 
party of recruits to a camp at some considerable 
distance, where their training for the Western 
Front commenced instantly. 
Roger Sullivan—Private Roger Sullivan as he 
was now known—looked in khaki a really fine 
young fellow. Read on, and you will hear how 
he started to make good his record.

  CHAPTER IV 
In the Trenches 
‘AND now we shan’t be long,” said Bill Andrews, 
gaily enough, as he and Roger, now fast friends, 
fell in for their last inspection prior to leaving for 
the front. ‘‘We’ve had a hardish time, eh? Lots 
of work, and hard work too.” 
“But pleasant enough,” said Roger. ‘‘I’ve en- 
joyed it.” 
“ Aye, that you have, and it’s made a real man 
of you. Why, you’ve come on just wonderful. 
You’ve put three inches on round the chest, your 
shoulders have spread so that you’ve had to have 
a new issue of uniform, and blest if you ain’t got 
heavier. Not fatter, mind you,” said Bill, critically 
enough, eyeing his chum carefully and looking all 
round him; ‘not fatter, me lad, for you haven’t an 
ounce to spare. You're just muscle and brawn, 
and are in first-rate trim for fighting.” 
To look at Roger just casually one would have 
admitted at once that he was a very proper young 
soldier indeed. No weediness about this lad, no 
shallow, stooping shoulders, no nerveless frame, 
and no trace of indecision. Roger, thanks to hard 
exercise and the very strenuous training period 
50
-P-A-G-E-55
  In the Trenches 51 
through which he had passed, was now as tough as 
whipcord, thoroughly well set up, as hard as nails, 
ruddy and sunburned, or, rather, reddened and 
browned by constant exposure, and withal as jolly 
a fellow as you could well come upon. 
““A good recruit—yes,” the Adjutant at the camp 
had told his sergeant-major within three days of 
his arrival. ‘‘ Of course he’s drilled before. Know 
anything about the youngster?” 
“Nothing much, sir. But he’s tiptop. As keen 
as possible—well, even in these days, when we get 
all sorts in the ranks, he’s a cut above the majority.” 
“Ah! How?” 
“Talks like a—well, same as you do, sir. Has 
a way with him, and—and can hit hard. He’s 
been to a school where they teach youngsters to 
stand up for themselves.” 
‘‘How’s that?” came the instant question. 
‘Like this, sir. There’s been something queer 
about that there recruit. I ain’t here to ask every 
one of ’em where he’s come from, nor why he’s 
jined up. Some of ’em has this reason, and some 
that, sir. Most of ’em’s come along because of the 
tales of the Germans, and because they’re the boys 
that mean to do their bit for the Old Country, and 
don’t want fetching and don’t mean to be fetched.” 
“Quite so. Quite so, Sergeant-major. Then 
you think——” 
“Tve guessed, that’s all, sir, that this youngster, 
Private Sullivan he calls himself, come along for 
some other more particular reason than most of our 
recruits. If ever I saw a hunted, haunted young- 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    52 Under Haig in Flanders 
ster the first day here—it was him. He’d been 
recruited a week before, and transferred, you'll 
remember, and when he arrived he got mooning 
about, crept into quiet corners, shunned, as you 
might say, all the others except that Private 
‘Andrews, who’s a good ’un too, though a dif- 
ferent cut to Sullivan.” 
“Then how do you know that he’s been to a 
school and so on? What about being able to pro- 
tect himself?” 
The Sergeant-major chuckled grimly and drew 
his six-feet-two up rigidly. He was no different from 
the usual stamp of sergeant-major, and was just as 
clever and wide-awake as the majority. Indeed he 
was the backbone of this training camp, right-hand 
to the Commandant and his Adjutant, and, like the 
Quartermaster, as indispensable, more indispensable 
indeed, than thousands of those who have set their 
particular value up as an excuse to escape con- 
scription. Like his confréres, then, this sergeant- 
major knew his recruits intimately, took individual 
notice of them, studied their faults and their good 
points, and knew all that there was to know about 
the life of a soldier. He chuckled again, still stand- 
ing rigidly at attention, while his piercing eyes 
looked over the head of the Adjutant. 
“T dropped on him from the first,” he said. 
““We don’t want tears in a camp like this, and 
skulking in dark corners ain’t the thing for young 
recruits. I got after young Sullivan, and I give 
him credit for making a willing effort right away 
to alter matters. But there are always busybodies
-P-A-G-E-57
In the Trenches 53 
about a camp, and some of ’em’s bullies. That 
Private Drury, somewhere from the slums of 
London, I believe, sets to. to make Sullivan’s life 
miserable.” 
“Ah! He’s got the look and swagger of a bully. 
Or, rather, he had. I’ve noticed a change in the 
man lately,” admitted the Adjutant. 
“Then you can thank young Sullivan for it. 
Seems he stood a bit of foolin’. Then he ups, and 
they tell me he’s got as pretty a style as any boxer 
you ever set eyes on. Drury ain’t likely to inter- 
fere again, nor anyone in this camp. Yes, sir, 
Sullivan’s worth watching.” 
The day had come when Roger had gone 
proudly enough to the tailor shop to have the 
galloon of a lance-corporal stitched on the sleeve 
of his tunic, and had worn his new honour with 
becoming modesty. Another red-letter day had 
arrived when a second stripe was added to that 
first one; and now that he had finished his training, 
could pitch a bomb with the best, knew all that 
was worth knowing about the art of trenching, and 
was possessed of more than a smattering of the 
science appertaining to the use of gas, and the 
methods to be adopted for protection against that 
barbarous weapon invented by the ruthless German, 
he wore a third stripe on his arm. 
“Young for a sergeant, perhaps,” reflected the 
Commandant, as he went down the line of men 
selected for the draft about to cross to France; 
‘“but knows his work, eh?” 
“‘Thoroughly well, sir. Commands men well:
-P-A-G-E-58
ee eee ee 
54 Under Haig in Flanders 
good-tempered but firm, quiet, and has an excel- 
lent record.” 
“And you’d recommend him, eh?” asked the 
Commandant, turning also to the Sergeant-major, 
ever at his elbow. 
‘For a commission when he’s done some service 
at the front. Certainly, sir. A very likely candi- 
date. Of course, you can’t always guarantee that 
a good man here will be equally good in the 
trenches and in the face of the enemy. But Ser- 
geant Sullivan will. He’s——” 
“Call him up,” said the Commandant abruptly. 
“Sergeant Sullivan. This way. March!” bel- 
lowed the Sergeant-major, tucking his cane beneath 
his left arm and casting a critical glance down 
the line awaiting inspection. ‘‘Captain Anstell’s 
right, sir, begging pardon,” he went on, sotto voce. 
“Sergeant Sullivan’s a real good non-commis- 
sioned officer. He'll make an excellent leader one 
of these days, any time he’s appointed.” 
_ See, then, Sergeant Sullivan standing at attention 
before his Commanding Officer, erect as a pole, 
carrying his pack and equipment in splendid fashion, 
and as if he hardly felt their weight, his rifle sloping 
over his shoulder, his right hand brought smartly 
over to the butt as he arrived opposite the officers, 
his eyes bright, his face keen and intelligent. 
‘“‘Er—ah—Sergeant Sullivan,” began the Com- 
mandant, ‘‘you’ve been mentioned as a non- 
commissioned officer of promise, and have been 
recommended to me as a candidate for a com- 
mission. Er—I suppose you would be willing?”
-P-A-G-E-59
  
In the Trenches 55 
‘‘T’d like to do some service at the front, first of 
all, sir,” answered Roger directly. ‘‘I like soldier- 
ing here, but out there ie 
“Precisely! One never knows how one will get 
on. But it is wonderful how our fellows have done. 
You'll do well, too, Sergeant. Had some education, 
I believe.” 
‘* Yes, sir.” 
‘At a public school?” 
“Yes, sir,” said Roger, a cloud passing over his 
face; for since he had enlisted he had never once 
spoken of his past life save with Bill, and he was a 
chum to be relied on. 
“Ah! Where?” asked the Commandant, while 
the Adjutant coughed significantly. ‘‘ But, there,” 
said the Commandant hurriedly, realizing that he 
was trenching on difficult and delicate ground, 
“that'll do, Sergeant Sullivan. Your name will 
be put forward. You're a credit to us, and will 
continue to be so.” 
“About turn! March!” shouted the Sergeant- 
major. : 
“Blimy!” growled Bill, watching the whole 
manoeuvre. ‘‘ Picked him out for a commission, 
I'll bet. Well, it had to come; only what about 
me?” 
What about poor Bill, long since bosom chum 
of our hero? 
“Don’t think that it would make any difference,” 
said Roger, as they went aboard the steamer which 
was to take them across to France. ‘‘ Besides, I 
am not an officer yet, so why worry?”   
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  56 Under Haig in Flanders 
Why worry, indeed, when so many things might 
happen; when they might be face to face with the 
enemy within a few days, and—and anything might 
occur. Any thoughts which the faithful Bill may 
have had on the matter were banished promptly; 
for what with the interest of embarking, what with 
the crowds of reinforcements aboard the ship, what 
with aircraft about and torpedo-boats scuttling 
around them, there was interest enough to attract 
his attention elsewhere. And then they reached 
the soil of France, where there was still more to 
look on at and remark about. 
‘““We go up to a camp where regimental depots 
are situated, and there have some further training,” 
the officer in command of the draft told Roger. 
“Tt’ll be a strenuous time, and there we'll be 
taught the very latest things about trench fight- 
ing.” 
A couple of weeks later Roger and his comrades 
fell in once more and entrained, and that night 
marched into billets behind the firing-line. 
‘‘Of course one has seen lots of photographs ot 
billets and French villages before,” said Bill, when 
the draft was dismissed, and, having eaten their 
evening ration, he and Roger meandered down the 
street. ‘‘But the actual thing is different. Sup- 
pose we could be reached by shells here?” 
Roger pointed significantly to huge gaps in the 
walls and roofs. ‘‘Naturally,” he said, smiling, 
‘billets for troops meant for the trenches have to 
be within easy distance, for men have to march 
down. Rest billets, though, are farther behind,
-P-A-G-E-61
  
In the Trenches 57 
where there’s little chance of shelling. Wonder 
what it’ll feel like to be under fire?” 
They had not very long to wait, for that very 
night a ‘‘ hate” was turned by the enemy upon this 
particular locality, and shells whistled over the 
village. Yet between the shots men could be heard 
singing, while the twang of a banjo came to the 
ears of Roger and his friends. On the following 
morning, too, shells were dropping about, bursting 
on occasion and sending dirt and debris of wrecked 
houses into the air. Looking out from his billet, 
Roger could see soldiers walking, it seemed, aim- 
lessly about the street, their ‘‘tin” helmets perched 
on the back of their heads, hands in pockets. 
‘Got used to shelling,” he told himself. ‘ Well, 
I can’t say that I am yet, and every shell that comes 
over makes me stare and bob. But I’ve got to get 
used to ’em too, so here goes.” 
He jammed his steel helmet on to his head, and 
set off for a saunter with Bill. 
“A near ’un that,” declared the latter, when a 
shell plumped into a ruined barn near the far end 
of the street and blew it to fragments. ‘‘ Lor’, look 
at them chaps. One would think they liked shells 
by the way they are walking.” 
You would indeed, for the nonchalance and idle 
curiosity of the British soldier are something to 
wonder at. Here, where one might reasonably 
have supposed that they would have fled for cover, 
they actually strolled toward the barn to inspect 
the damage, and practically every man dangled 
a half-consumed cigarette between his lips, and
-P-A-G-E-62
  
  58 Under Haig in Flanders 
looked—and felt too, without a doubt—utterly at 
ease. 
“Yer see,” explained one merry fellow to Bill, 
when the latter tackled him on the subject, ‘‘ there’s 
such a heap of shells and other things flyin’ about 
that you can’t help yerself. Fust time I come out, 
same as you chaps, I was divin’ and runnin’ and 
sweatin’ whenever a shell came near, till I was that 
worn out and miserable. But divin’ don’t save yer, 
nor does runnin’, ’cos like as not you'll run into one 
of the beggars. So you gets a settled-down sort 0’ 
feelin’. You begins to feel amused with shells, and 
though some of ’em’s annoyin’, and sometimes they 
gets men, mostly you takes ’em just as you takes 
breakfast.” 
The taking of breakfast was quite an entertaining 
affair in these billets. Roger and Bill and the 
men with whom they had come to France had now 
joined the battalion they were to fight with, and 
had been appointed to a company. On returning 
to their billet they heard the bugle go for breakfast, 
and presently men told off for that fatigue went to 
the cook-house, where white-robed cooks handed 
them cooked rations for the messes they represented. 
Then frizzling bacon, not to be beaten anywhere, 
bread that might have graced the table of a Ritz 
hotel, and jam that would have been the envy of 
any housewife, were eaten in a room set apart for 
the purpose, some of the men perched on chairs, 
but the majority seated on the floor. 
“‘We go up to trenches to-night,” Roger was 
told when he went to get orders for his platoon.
-P-A-G-E-63
  In the Trenches 59 
“You'll see that each of your men has his full 
equipment and a day’s rations, the latter uncooked. 
Be careful that gas helmets are in perfect order, 
and warn each man to carry a spare pair of socks. 
Trenches we go to are notoriously wet, and the 
men’s feet require attention.” 
Just before dusk the feet of each man were 
anointed with oil, and the latter well rubbed in. 
Then loose boots were donned, packs were settled 
upon shoulders, and presently the regiment was 
marching along the road en route to the trenches. 
It was darker now, and flashes, hitherto unseen, 
punctured the gloom to right and left, behind them, 
and particularly in front. The roar of artillery-fire 
could be heard from a point at some distance, while 
somewhere in front a machine-gun was tapping out 
a staccato song, a guttural rat-a-tat-tat prolonged 
in bursts at times, then dying down, only to break 
out of a sudden with vehemence. 
They were in the front-line trenches at last, 
and the men they had relieved were struggling 
along the zigzag communication-trenches which 
Roger and his fellows had just followed. Sentries 
were told off, packs were dumped, and soon the 
battalion was sleeping. 
‘Precious funny it all do look,” said Bill, when 
breakfasts had been eaten on the following morning, 
and the two chums stood on the fire-step peering 
out toward the front through a periscope. ‘That'll 
be the German trenches just over there. Two 
hundred feet, more or less.” 
“Less,” said Roger; ‘‘and that’s their wire just 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  
  60 Under Haig in Flanders 
in front of the dirty snake-like streak which re- 
presents their trenches. Ours is twenty feet in 
front of and Ys 
The periscope he was observing the enemy 
through flew into fragments. Bill gave a startled 
cry. Roger grinned. 
“Sniper,” he said. ‘Now I wonder where that 
bullet came from.” 
‘*Get another periscope from trench stores,” an 
officer, a subaltern in comniand of the platoon, told 
him, laughing. ‘‘ You'll have ’em nearer than that, 
Sergeant Sullivan. Best put your periscope up in 
a different place, for the fellow who broke this one 
has probably been training on it for some while 
past. You and Private Andrews here had best 
keep a watch for that German. Fritz has worried 
us a heap lately with his snipers, and one of them 
in particular. No one’s been able to spot the 
fellow.” 
‘*So it’s up to us to do it, eh, Roger?” said Bill, 
becoming a little excited. ‘Now how’s it to be 
done? Only by watchin’, I suppose.” 
“TI don’t know. Let’s get the new periscope and 
then think things over. Seems to me that merely 
to put one up and peer through it is to invite that 
sniper to knock a hole through it. No doubt they 
like to show off their good shooting in that way, 
and of course it takes a good shot to hit the mirror 
of a periscope. We've got to get artful.” 
“Get artful! Should say you have,” broke in a 
fellow sergeant. ‘See here, Sullivan, I’ve been 
in trenches best part of eighteen months now, and  
-P-A-G-E-65
In the Trenches 61 
at times when periscopes weren’t dreamt of. 
Snipers was more troublesome in those days than 
now, and perhaps just as artful. But snipin’s 
become an art this many a day, and you ain’t 
a-goin’ to catch that Fritz by merely staring.” 
When the matter came to be put to the test, Roger 
and Bill and the other men engaged in the affair 
found that they had a very crafty German to deal 
with. To commence with, he splintered the new 
periscope, which Roger erected some yards to one 
side of the position the other had occupied, within 
a minute of its appearance. Then this same worthy 
contrived to send a bullet flashing past Roger’s 
head, so that it almost took the skin from his ear, 
and certainly set his ‘‘tin” hat ringing. 
“You've got to play some other game with 
that scum,” said the sergeant who had spoken 
earlier. ‘‘He’s out to kill and to bamboozle us, 
and he’s done both, let me tell you. Seems to me 
we'd better get far along the trench and take the 
sniping officer with us.” 
For three hours a little band of eager folk at- 
tempted to discover the lair of the German, who was 
hidden somewhere opposite, and not till darkness 
began to fall was any one of them in the vaguest 
way aware of the lair which the man occupied. 
‘““We’ve searched every tree and every little 
hillock of earth with our shots,” grumbled Bill, 
who was getting quite indignant at their) want of 
success. ‘‘ Seems to me that this chap don’t exist, 
else we should have discovered him.” 
“‘Phit!” A bullet licked its way past Bill’s head, 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  62 Under Haig in Flanders 
causing him to duck hastily. Then it thudded 
into the rear of the trench, bringing down a minia~- 
ture avalanche of earth, which set him muttering. 
“Look at that,” he cried, his anger rising. 
‘“‘Just as I says as he don’t exist, he puts in a 
shot that nearly does for yours truly. I ain’t 
a-goin’ to put up with this much longer.” 
“Stop! I’ve spotted the fellow, I do believe,” 
came from Roger, his eye glued to the periscope. 
“Bill, just put your helmet on your rifle and lift 
it an inch above the parapet. That'll do. Now 
wait.” 
Wait, indeed! There was no need to do that, 
for within half a minute the helmet was ringing 
like a gong and spinning round upon the muzzle 
of the rifle, while on’ inspection it was found to 
have been neatly perforated by a bullet. 
“Good shootin’ !” exclaimed the Sergeant. ‘‘That 
there Fritz has a straight eye and an uncommon 
good hiding-place. You say as you’ve spotted him, 
Sergeant Sullivan. Whereabouts?” 
“Tell me, when does a fellow like this take up 
his post?” asked Roger, ignoring the question. 
“‘Not during the day, I’m sure, or he’d be seen. 
Then just before dawn, eh?” 
“That’s so. Just before it gets light. He'll 
sneak back to his friends now and put in a sleep, 
not forgetting a feed. Then he'll be up before 
dawn, will fill his water-bottle and his ammunition- 
pouch, and will put food into his haversack. After 
that he’ll creep to his lair, and lie there waiting all 
day long. It’s a craze with them Fritzes. They
-P-A-G-E-67
In the Trenches 63 
like killing people in a dirty sort o’ way, they do. 
I’ve known some of ’em keep up the game for a 
fortnight, during which they’ll have put quite 
a number of our boys under. Yer see, even in 
trenches one forgets sometimes that it’s war, and 
gets careless. But Fritz watches all the time, 
and it’s the careless ones that pays toll to the 
sniper.” 
Roger stepped down from the fire-bench with a 
quick movement and faced them in the gathering 
gloom. Then he drew himself up at attention and 
saluted his platoon officer. 
“Beg pardon, sir,” he said, ‘but I’ve spotted 
that sniper.” 
‘Ah, spotted him, eh?” the officer looked Roger 
over critically. ‘‘Gentleman,” he thought. ‘“‘ Speaks 
like an officer. Keen, too, keen as mustard. Ah, 
spotted that plaguey fellow. I’m glad. What then? 
The fellow has killed quite a lot of our men of late, 
and we shall be well rid of him.” 
“Then I’d like to go out and bag him, sir. He’s 
hidden so that you can hardly hope to shoot him 
down from the trenches. There are the remains of 
an old barn opposite, behind which the German 
trenches run, and I feel quite sure that the sniper 
has his lair in the very corner, and is firing through 
a small aperture between the stones. They’re only 
a foot high, so our guns can hardly be trained on 
them. Then he’s banked earth in front, so as to 
disguise the real situation. But if I could go out 
very early in the morning, before he takes up his 
post, I rather fancy I might end his business.”  
-P-A-G-E-68
  64 Under Haig in Flanders 
“Good! You'll do! That’s your sort, Sergeant. 
Come along to the Adjutant. He always encour- 
ages little things of this sort. You're sure of your 
facts, of course, and can tell him?” 
Roger felt quite positive, and sketched the situa- 
tion to the Adjutant a minute later. Then, just as 
the platoon commander had done, this officer looked 
our hero over critically. 
' “Game, I'll be bound,” he thought. ‘In the 
pink, as we used to say at school. And fresh up 
in the trenches. Well, it will be a fine example to 
the rest. Very well, Sergeant Sullivan,” he said 
aloud. ‘‘Choose a couple of men to accompany 
you, for these jobs can’t be done single-handed, 
and be sure to warn the sentries before you go over. 
Take a bayonet only, or some trenching-tool, or a 
hammer, for a rifle would be in the way, and, re- 
member, you’ve got to be back in these trenches 
before it’s daylight or they'll riddle you with 
bullets.” 
“Then you can put me down for one of the two,” 
said Bill, when Roger had rejoined him; said it, 
indeed, with an insistence there was no denying. 
“And you can take it that I come too,” laughed 
the sergeant who had already interested himself in 
the matter. ‘‘You’ll want someone to cut their 
wire, and that’s me, for I’ve done it often. Well, 
I’m glad to get off on a spree again. Trench life 
tires a fellow worse than billets.” 
A spree, indeed! It was a desperate and most 
adventurous undertaking. Not that Roger or Bill 
or the Sergeant thought of it in that way. They
-P-A-G-E-69
In the Trenches ~~ 65 
ate their supper with gusto, sat chatting for a 
while, and turned in to sleep like children. Then, 
an hour before dawn, a sentry wakened them, and, 
having drunk a cup of steaming cocoa apiece, for 
comforts are not by any means non-existent in the 
trenches, the three made ready for a journey across 
No Man’s Land into the country of the enemy.

  CHAPTER V 
Raiding Snipers 
‘‘Ha.r-past three,” said Roger, bending over a 
glowing trench brazier about which hung a festoon 
of socks, for to preserve the feet in perfect condition 
in wet trenches dry socks are an essential. “ Half- 
past three, and it begins to get light at a quarter 
after four. That gives us plenty of time I should 
say.” 
‘‘Depends on the wire, and whether we have to 
cut much of it,” answered the Sergeant, setting 
down his empty mess-tin and wiping his mouth 
with the back of a powerful hand. ‘‘ Yes, that’s 
the time, Sullivan,” he continued, bending, as 
Roger had done, so that the reflection from the 
brazier illuminated his wrist watch. ‘‘ Then let’s 
see about weapons. How’s that for mine?” 
He produced a short, heavy stick, with a knobbly 
end into which a number of steel studs were driven. 
A cord threaded through the handle and passed 
over his wrist secured it to his person. Thrust into 
his belt was a huge pair of wire-cutters, for the wire 
used by the enemy is so strong and thick that it 
would almost hold up a battleship. A pair of 
heavy leather gloves completed his preparations. 
Then Bill stepped into the light and held forward 
66
-P-A-G-E-71
  Raiding Snipers 67 
his particular weapon. It was an artificer’s ham- 
mer. ‘Same as I’ve been used to,” he said, with a 
grin. ‘*Three pound, and not an ounce under. 
If there’s Germans to be hit, and I get in at ’em, 
well, there won’t be no more snipin’. How about 
you, me lad?” 
It was a matter of habit with him to address 
Roger in that way, though on formal occasions it 
was ‘‘Sergeant Sullivan,” and ‘‘Yes, Sergeant. 
Right, Sergeant.” But, then, this was not a formal 
occasion. The three were about to share the risk 
of a common enterprise, and danger levels the best 
of company. 
“That’s mine. Feel it,” said Roger, holding 
out a short, leather-covered stick, which he had 
bought from an English store in the town nearest 
their billets. ‘Weighted with lead. More deli- 
cate-looking than the things that you fellows have, 
but——” 
‘But a beauty,” declared the Sergeant, taking it 
and balancing it in one hand. ‘‘ Comes up quick 
above the shoulder. Drops heavy, and with its 
own weight. Well, if Fritz comes in the way of 
that, Sullivan, there’ll be little more to say about 
the matter. Ha! Here’s the platoon officer.” 
A stocky little man approached along the dark 
trench and halted in front of them, still buttoning 
his war-stained tunic. Rats scuttled away from his 
feet as he did so, and could be heard racing along 
the boards flooring the trench. ‘Ah, that you?” 
he asked cheerily, coming close up to them. ‘‘Then 
you’re ready. Now don’t forget instructions. Lie
-P-A-G-E-72
  
  68 Under Haig in Flanders 
flat if they send up a star light. If you happen to 
be standing, remain absolutely still, and take no 
notice of their firing. I’m posting men along the 
trench to watch for your return. Just whistle to let 
us know that it’s you, and you can rely upon our 
covering your movement. Good luck, lads!” 
‘“‘Thank you, sir,” they said. : 
“‘Then, carry on. Sergeant Sullivan, you’re in 
command of the party and will report on your 
return. Off you go. It’s a bonny morning for 
this business.” 
Himself only a youngster, this officer was, for all 
that, already a war-worn veteran, and had on many 
an occasion ventured toward the enemy trenches. 
But this expedition was on somewhat different lines; 
it was essentially a kidnapping affair, and only 
secrecy and determination could carry it to success. 
Roger stood on the fire-bank and peered over 
the front of the trench. A pall of misty darkness 
stretched before him. To right and to left it hung, 
obliterating the landscape, the trench-line seaming 
the tortured ground, the double bank of wire-en- 
tanglements between British and German trenches, 
shell-holes, shattered masonry, the relics of village 
gardens, watercourses, roads, and a thousand and 
one objects. Nota sound could be heard, and nota 
gun startled the silence. Along that four-hundred- 
mile line of trenches men were sleeping in dug- 
outs, in holes, in natural caves, in every sort of 
shelter, with arms by their side, ready for instant 
action. Over them, watching through the hours 
of darkness, more thousands, the sentries, peered
-P-A-G-E-73
  Raiding Snipers 69 
out of trenches, stood about braziers, smoked, end 
gossiped. 
Yet, were those sentries the only ones awake on 
this early morning? Roger clambered out of the 
trench, his loaded stick in hand, and was joined 
by Bill and the Sergeant. ‘Stop! A shot down 
there! Stand still!” 
A Véry light was fired by some German sentry 
toward their left front, and, soaring upward, hung 
over No Man’s Land, illuminating it so brightly 
that it seemed that no one there could escape 
detection. 
‘‘Spotted one of our working-parties yonder,” 
whispered the Sergeant. ‘I caught a glimpse of 
them as the light burst. Guess they’re standing 
still as statues, same as we are. There go some 
shots. Well, shots don’t hurt anybody.” 
The light went out, drifting into the distance, 
and that misty darkness once again covered the 
land, hiding all from view. What would it have 
uncovered, however, were it suddenly lifted and 
the broad light of day had illuminated the scene? 
It would have shown thousands and thousands of 
soldiers, other than those wakeful sentries, toiling 
to meet the needs of their comrades. Fatigue 
parties repairing trenches, digging new ones, and 
delving saps. Ghostly figures out in front of the 
trenches repairing those snake-like wire-entangle- 
ments, men trudging along the communicating 
trenches with rations and ammunition and a hun- 
dred and one trench stores for the fighting troops, 
and yet again, masses of soldiers making their way
-P-A-G-E-74
  70 Under Haig in Flanders 
to the front line to relieve those who had already 
done a turn of duty. One could carry the descrip- 
tion further and show those hundreds and hundreds 
toiling just behind the communicating trenches; 
wagons rolling along to dumps where trench 
parties received them, ambulances clearing the sick 
and wounded—a variety of workers, a nocturnal 
gang all bent on carrying on the war against the 
common enemy. 
“Forward!” whispered Roger. ‘‘ Dead ahead 
till we’re through our wire, and then to the left. 
Catch hold of my belt, Bill, and let the Sergeant 
do the same. Ah! Here we are! A little to the 
left. Here’s the gap. Look out that you don’t 
get caught on the wire.” 
They spoke only in low whispers now, and 
having crept through the gap purposely left in the 
entanglement in front of their own trench, turned 
a little to their left, and, going on hands and knees, 
made their way slowly toward their objective. 
“Tell want finding in this mist, too,” thought 
Roger. ‘Still I marked it down very carefully, 
and think I ought to be able to lead almost exactly 
on tothe spot. Bother it! There’s another alarm, 
and another Véry light.” 
As the ball of flame soared overhead they flopped 
on their faces and lay perfectly still for some few 
minutes, listening to the rattle of musketry farther 
along the line. Once a shot rang out immediately 
to their front, and all three felt rather than heard 
the bullet cut its way through the rank grass just 
overhead.
-P-A-G-E-75
  Raiding Snipers 71 
“Come on! Here’s their wire! Now, Sergeant! 
Get a grip of it with your gloved hands there, 
Sullivan. Now you, Bill, on the far side, so as 
it can’t fly out and cut us. Sides, one can cut 
it easier and quieter. There she goes! Now for 
the next strand. This here stuffs so hard one 
wants a cold chisel, a big hammer, and an anvil 
to tackle it properly. Even geared-down shears 
like these want a bit o’ handlin’ to get through it.” 
Cutting their way through the enemy wire was 
indeed no easy matter, and minutes passed as they 
struggled with the tough material. At length, 
however, thanks to the powerful cutters with which 
they were provided, and in part to the strong 
gloves with which their hands were protected, they 
managed to clear the obstacle, and were ready to 
advance upon the spot where they hoped they 
would discover the lair of the sniper. 
“Tie yer handkerchief to the edge of the gap 
here,” whispered the Sergeant, as they lay at the 
foot of the wire peering eagerly ahead of them. 
‘Tf we get rushed, and have to return in a hurry, 
a gap of this size wants a heap of findin’, and 
delay means more and more bullets. That’s the 
sort. Now, Sullivan.” 
“Dead ahead from this point, and not another 
word from either of us. I'll lead.” 
His heart was beating a merry tattoo against his 
ribs, and thudding so heavily and so loudly, it 
seemed, against his sturdy chest that Roger won- 
dered vaguely how it was that the Germans did 
not hear it. Bump! Bump! Bump! It was like
-P-A-G-E-76
| 72 Under Haig in Flanders 
the distant, dull report ofa cannon. Bump! Bump! 
“Bah!” He shook himself angrily and sat up for 
a second. 
“Too excited,” he told himself. ‘Shan’t get 
the business done if I’m so agitated. Besides, 
what’s there to be excited about! Bah! Noth- 
ing!” 
He felt better after that, and the thudding of his 
heart lessened. Behind him he could hear Bill’s 
deep breathing, and behind him again a faint clink 
as the Sergeant’s wire-cutters hit a flint lying in 
the grass. Then a sound from his immediate front 
came to his ears, and stretching out both hands 
he gave his comrades a warning touch. 
“Three men talking, and not ten yards away. 
| That’ll be the enemy trench then. Good! They’re 
moving off to the left. Now for it.” 
| He was just about to lead the way forward again 
| when for the third time an alarm was sounded. 
Some sentry away to the right, thinking he saw 
a British soldier coming toward him, blazed off his 
rifle, and at once fifty of his comrades followed 
suit, sending their bullets swishing across toward 
the opposite trenches. Then the inevitable Véry 
light soared, stabbing the misty darkness with a 
thousand flashes. 
‘‘Got it!” whispered Roger. ‘Led right on to 
the wall, and a wall it is without a doubt. That 
light was just what we wanted. There, it’s gone! 
Come along, Bill. Here you are, Sergeant.” 
They crept on seven or eight feet, and found 
their further progress obstructed by a low wall of 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  Raiding Snipers 73 
stone, whose rugged and shell-broken top was 
thickly matted with rank grass and creeper. 
Roger ran his hands along it, feeling every crevice, 
for he had now discarded his gloves and tucked 
them into his belt. 
“That’s one of the loopholes the beggar fires 
through. Now I begin to get the hang of the 
thing. The wall is the remains of a barn, of which 
only one corner is left. Long grass growing all 
about practically hides it altogether. Just the very 
spot for a sniper I should say. Wonder whether 
the bird’s at home. Stay here,” he whispered to 
the others. ‘‘I’ll go over.” 
Standing up, he felt his way along the wall till 
it ceased altogether, though at his feet he found 
tumbled and shattered masonry sunk in the grass. 
Then he passed to the other side of the wall and 
retraced his steps along it. Ah! The place was 
roofed in at the very corner. A piece of sheet-iron 
sloped upward to the top of the wall, and was sup- 
ported on what felt like iron beams. On the top 
of the sheet were sand-bags, and on their summit 
again earth and rank grass. 
“So that explains the mystery, and no wonder 
the lair has remained hidden even from the eyes 
of an airman flying low. From above, this spot 
will look like the grass all round, while from the 
front it’s almost invisible. Now what’s under the’ 
shelter?” 
Very cautiously Roger went on hands and knees 
and thrust his hands beneath the roof of this sniper’s 
dug-out. He found a deep hole with rough steps  
-P-A-G-E-78
  74 Under Haig in Flanders 
leading down into it, and, lowering himself slowly 
by that means, he discovered a trench perhaps 
seven feet in length, shored up by side timbers, 
floored with wood, and provided with a fire-step 
which no doubt allowed the sniper to reach the 
aperture in the wall in front, through which he 
meant to pick off some hapless British soldier. 
‘*Come in,” he whispered to Bill and the Ser- 
geant, clambering out of the hole and bending 
over the wall. ‘‘Step a few feet along this way 
and then come round. There’s a trench down here, 
and we'll get into it before we do more talking. 
Hurry up; I can hear men coming.” 
They were all three down in the sniper’s lait 
within a minute, and sat there for a while listening 
to some Germans near at hand as they chatted. . 
Then they evidently separated, for only one man 
was left, no doubt a sentry, whom they could hear 
humming a melancholy refrain as he trudged to 
and fro in the trench not ten feet from them. 
“Got to mark that man, eh?” said the Sergeant. 
“He might give trouble in the midst of our busi- 
ness. Now then, Sullivan, what’s the move? This 
fellow may be along any moment.” 
“There are two of them. Feel about for your- 
selves. I’ve come across two rough wooden chairs, 
and two rifles each fitted with special sights. 
Looks likely, doesn’t it?” 
“As sure as eggs,” growled the Sergeant. 
‘“‘They’ve got such a pretty perch here, and have 
had it so long, without a doubt, that they ain’t 
afraid of its ever being located. So they just put
-P-A-G-E-79
  , Raiding Snipers 975 
their tools down, as you might say, and goes home 
to bed and breakfast. What then?” 
‘What's this? A cupboard in the side of this 
hole, and—ammunition and what feels like an elec- 
tric torch,” whispered Bill, who had meanwhile 
been diligently feeling about his surroundings. 
“A torch! Look out that you don’t switch it on 
with the light upward. Just give a flash down 
here at the very bottom. That’s the sort. See the 
rifles, Sergeant, and their sights. Well, that’s for 
the sights. They’ll be useful in our trenches.” 
Very rapidly Roger detached the special appara- 
tus from these snipers’ rifles, and tucked them in 
his pocket. Then he drew his two comrades even 
closer. 
“Bill will creep off to the edge of the trench and 
mark that sentry,” he said abruptly. ‘‘ Sergeant, 
you'll lie down just here to the left and be ready to 
tackle the second man. I'll be in the bottom of the 
trench ready to deal with the first who enters. Of 
course, if more men come we shall have to raid 
?em, and our bombs would then come in useful. 
Get into position at once, for I feel sure that it is 
getting lighter.” 
They parted without a word, Bill to creep off to 
the German trench and lay himself down almost on 
the parapet; the Sergeant to a spot just outside the 
sniper’s lair; while Roger crouched in that cunning 
place itself. There they waited for ten long minutes, 
minutes which felt like hours, and there, as they 
crouched, they heard German soldiers moving here 
and there, sentries trudging their beats, messengers
-P-A-G-E-80
  76 Under Haig in Flanders 
coming and going. Someone coughed. A voice 
louder than the usual ones came to their ears. A 
party of men were undoubtedly approaching along 
the trench, a party which halted within three yards 
of the expectant Bill, while the voices became louder. 
“Ten of ’em I make out,” Bill thought, peering 
“over the parapet. ‘Some of ’em’s carrying stuff. 
Two of the blighters climbin’ out o’ the trench. 
They'll be our fellers.” 
‘Saw two heads then,” the Sergeant whispered 
to himself, and then peered down at Roger. ‘‘Look 
out!” he signalled. ‘‘ Coming!” 
Roger gripped his loaded cane, and sank back 
into a corner. The Sergeant sat up on one knee, 
and flourished his knobbly cudgel to make quite 
sure that he had it with him. Bill crept to his feet 
and fell in behind that party of Germans, all of whom 
were clambering out of the trench. Then the gut- 
tural voice of an officer was heard. 
“Halt! Put the things down here. Not there, 
you pig! Here, here!” 
There came the sound of a blow, while a man 
staggered. 
“Now, get to work with your spades. We've 
got to get this place enlarged before morning. 
Here, you——” and he shot out a hand and gripped 
the man near him. ‘ Why, what’s this? A broad 
belt, a——” 
Some sudden suspicion filled his mind, and, 
‘diving a hand into a pocket, he dragged forth a 
tiny torch lamp, and before Bill could imagine what 
was to happen turned a beam upon his face.
-P-A-G-E-81
  Raiding Snipers 77 
“English! A raid!” bellowed the officer, still 
gripping his torch, and flooding Bill’s person with 
it. But only for a few swift seconds. For Bill 
struck perhaps as he had never struck before, and 
the light and this German officer went out with the 
blow, extinguished by a three-pound hammer. 
The mélée that followed is almost indescribable. 
Men shouted, sentries in the enemy trench opened 
fire in the direction where they had seen that lamp 
flash, while the group of men who had accompanied 
the snipers toward their lair turned in one or two 
instances to make back for safety. But Bill was 
there to intervene, a lusty Bill, who beat upon their 
heads with his hammer as a smith beats upon an 
anvil. As for the snipers themselves, they had 
gained the edge of the deep hole in which Roger 
was secreted before the officer had broken silence. 
One of them was even then clambering down that 
somewhat rickety ladder, while the other stood just 
behind him, fumbling for a cigarette with which he 
proposed to while the minutes away till daylight 
came and allowed him to continue his task of shoot- 
ing unwary British soldiers. 
Roger stretched out his free left hand, felt the 
boots of the man descending, and jerked his feet 
from the ladder. Then he fell upon the astonished 
soldier, and, gripping him by the neck, bundled him 
into the corner, shaking him as a dog does a rat. 
“Hands up, quick! Move a finger after that 
and I brain you. Now follow out of the trench, 
and see that you don’t move far away.” 
The man had shrunk into the corner, and for a 
3  
-P-A-G-E-82
  78 Under Haig in Flanders 
second or so could not so much as answer. Now, 
cowering there, he lifted his trembling hands and 
besought Roger to spare him. 
“Don’t strike,” he whined, and his English was 
excellent. ‘‘I surrender. I—I’ll go gladly, for I 
like England.” 
Pah! the man had been one of that ravenous 
band of waiters which may again batten upon a 
liberal British public in hotel and restaurant. 
Crash! There was the sound of blows outside, 
and at once Roger threw the man into a corner and 
scrambled into the open. The Sergeant was there, 
dimly seen against the mist, the band of white 
which he, like his comrades, wore about his left 
arm easily visible. Men were swarming about him, 
while another figure with a white band was beating 
his way forward. 
‘‘Charge!” shouted Roger, for there was now no 
need for secrecy or silence. ‘‘Charge!” shrieked 
Bill, worked up to a pitch of excitement, his ham- 
mer falling like a flail, his sweeping blows raining 
on the enemy. 
“Just you stow that there catawaulin’ and lie 
still,” growled the Sergeant, making good use ot 
his own’ weapon, and addressing his remarks to a 
figure lying at his feet. ‘* You can choose the best 
of two things. Either come along with me, or take 
yer medicine.” 
The individual at his feet evidently decided to 
come along, for he lay there trembling, while the 
Sergeant took a hand in the mélée. 
“Now let’s get back. Come out, you!” called
-P-A-G-E-83
  
Raiding Snipers 79 
Roger, going to the edge of the sniper’s dug-out. 
‘*Make sure that you haven’t an arm, for otherwise 
you'll get into trouble. Sergeant, bring your man 
along. Bill, go dead straight ahead, and keep an 
eye open for that gap in the wire.” 
Véry lights were flashing in the sky. Perhaps a 
quarter of a mile away a machine-gun was sending 
forth a loud, revolting death-rattle. Sentries perched 
on German fire-steps blazed at nothing, while sen- 
tries opposite watched and waited. 
“That'll be the men,” cried the platoon officer 
who had seen the departure of Roger and his two 
comrades. ‘‘ They’re coming through the gap and 
bringing prisoners with them. Make ready to cover 
’em, men. Shoot hard if you get amark. Hooray, 
they’re making fine progress!” 
It was lighter now—one would have thought 
dangerously light, for near objects were visible. But 
the morning mist hid all things at ten yards dis- 
tance. Thanks then to that cover, Roger and his 
party threaded their way through the enemy wire, 
gained the parapet of their own trenches, and pre- 
sently dropped into them with their prisoners. 
“« A very fine performance,” said their Command- 
ing Officer, who had been roused by the uproar, 
and now came crawling out of his damp dug-out. 
“«Two snipers captured—eh! and you say that that 
is their lair? Ah, Sergeant Sullivan—eh? We'll 
discuss the matter later, but.a very fine perform- 
ance, I assure you.” 
Telephone bells buzzed, guns far behind the 
British line opened, while a trench-mortar came
-P-A-G-E-84
  80 Under Haig in Flanders 
into operation, aiming its shots under Roger's 
direction. Then a lucky shot, a huge burst of 
smoke, and the sniper’s lair was blown out of 
existence. 
If you had seen Bill and Roger and the Sergeant 
some fifteen minutes later, seated about a brazier 
munching their breakfast ration in most contented 
fashion, you would have thought that nothing what- 
ever could have happened during the hours of dark- 
ness. Certainly to have imagined that these three 
had undertaken a raid and had just returned from 
a hazardous expedition was next door to impossible. 
Yet they had. 
““They’ve done us a great service,”’ said the com- 
mander of Roger’s battalion. ‘‘ Sergeant-major, 
you'll march those three to the orderly-room dug- 
out after breakfast. It’s been a very fine perform- 
ance.” 
Yet it was not the only operation in which Roger 
and his friends took part in the weeks which fol- 
lowed. Long acquaintance with trench conditions, 
the crash of guns all about them, and the falling 
of high-explosive shells around their heads, soon 
made of them hardened veterans. Roger could 
tell almost by the whistle whether an oncoming 
shell were of 5 or of 8 inches diameter, and 
learned to smile at close shaves, and to laugh as 
duds (unexploded shells) floundered into the trench. 
Then with his comrades he became immersed in 
gigantic operations, for the summer of 1916 arrived, 
and with it the Somme offensive.
-P-A-G-E-85
CHAPTER VI 
The Somme Offensive 
IMAGINE a rising landscape splashed with flame 
and smoke, and woods and copses disappearing. 
Watch the rolling ground to the east of Albert as 
it is torn with shells, and see an avalanche of 
missiles rend asunder all traces of the living. For 
days and nights the British guns had thundered 
without cessation, pouring a tornado of bursting 
steel upon those elaborate and often concreted 
defences devised by the Germans, ripping up whole 
miles of wire-entanglements, demolishing trenches, 
burrowing even to the depths of deep dug-outs, and 
annihilating the defenders. 
“‘There’s never been anything like it before,” 
said that platoon officer who had long since learned 
to like and appreciate Sergeant Sullivan. ‘I don’t 
want to boast, of course, nor to yarn about myself, 
but this—this is really magnificent. Why, when 
we fellows of the original army got up against 
the enemy on the Aisne our gun-fire was, in com- 
parison, like the firing of pop-guns. Well, it’ll 
soon be over.” 
“And then we go forward, sir, I suppose?” asked 
Roger. 
(0 902) 81 6
-P-A-G-E-86
  82 Under Haig in Flanders 
“‘Of course. Orders will be published this even- 
ing, and I wouldn’t wonder if we were over the top 
to-morrow. Then we shall advance behind our 
barrage, and if we don’t get as far as our objective 
—well, things’Il be funny.” 
He was tingling with keenness, as was Roger, 
and as were thousands more British soldiers along 
that front. Not alone there in front of Albert, but 
ata point some little distance to the north, and from 
thence right down to within some four miles of 
the River Somme, British soldiers hugged their 
trenches, lay flat in their funk-holes, dozed as best 
they could, in spite of that incessant and all-pervad- 
ing gun-fire, or chatted and smoked nonchalantly, 
waiting for the order to advance, which all knew 
was coming. North and south of the River Somme 
as many gallant poilus, France’s irresistible soldiers, 
lay in their trench-line, waiting also, deafened by 
their guns, casting an expectant eye now and 
again over the smoking landscape which led on 
to Peronne. 
And then the order came. Men fell in, the 
trenches became a busy hive of activity, while 
thousands of tin helmets peeped above the parapets, 
and men stood, one foot on the firing-step, ready to 
go over. 
“There the barrage starts!” said Roger’s subal- 
tern. ‘‘Itll shift those Germans right enough. 
But, of course, there’ll be pockets of snipers and 
machine-gunners here and there. Keep a tight 
hold on the left of our platoon, Sergeant, and don’t 
forget to make good use of your bombers. Our
-P-A-G-E-87
  
The Somme Offensive 83 
chaps bowl their bombs over as if they were cricket 
balls, and the beggars over there hate ’em.” 
The beggars over there had been having an 
exceedingly warm time of it for hours now, for, 
indeed, the position as it existed at the beginning 
of the war had been amazingly reversed. As 
Roger’s own particular officer had averred, the 
firing of our guns now was an entirely different 
matter. That noble band which in 1914 had faced 
a perfectly-equipped German army, and had been 
deluged by shells cast by guns out of all proportion 
numerically to our own, were about to be avenged 
by Britain’s new armies, her bakers’ and her tailors’ 
sons, her men from behind the counter. Those 
of that first expeditionary force who survived, and 
stood awaiting the order to go over on that early 
July morning in 1916, listened with grinning faces 
and with approving glances to the roar of British 
guns behind them. Yes, it was different. 
‘ As chalk from cheese,” the officer told our hero. 
“1 don’t know for certain, but I should guess that 
we've more guns and bigger ones than the Germans 
possess, and more of ’em are coming over. As to 
the ‘stuff’ we put across, well it’s terrifying. Ha! 
there goes the mine. Off you go, boys!” 
“Time!” shouted some wag amongst the men. 
“On the ball, boys. Forward!” 
A deafening roar from the left, a nerve-shattering 
detonation, set the ground swaying, and caused 
whole lengths of the parapet to tumble into the 
trenches. Then a cheer swung along the British 
line, figures clambered from the brown earth—
-P-A-G-E-88
  84 Under Haig in Flanders 
figures hardly distinguishable from their surround- 
ings—and a moment later they were off. The huge 
Somme offensive had begun; our troops were mov- 
ing uphill toward the German lines, covered by a 
barrage of bursting shrapnel which obliterated the 
landscape. 
‘«Steady there! We’re through their wire, but 
there’s more of it ahead and uncut. Watch out for 
sneaks coming up behind us from their dug-outs. 
Sergeant Sullivan, take your bombers towards our 
centre, for I caught sight of a party of the enemy 
there.” 
“Down on your faces! A machine-gun!” 
shouted Roger, falling prostrate at that moment, 
a movement which the remainder of the platoon 
copied. ‘‘They’ve just uncovered the gun, and 
are sweeping the ground behind and under us. 
Here, Bill, keep an eye out for it.” 
Bill crept toward his chum, and for a while the 
platoon lay flat, though to their right and their left 
brown figures were still moving forward, while ever 
in front that barrage of shot and smoke moved : 
onward. Yet just here, as at many another point, 
the advance was arrested by a hidden quick-firer. 
Bullets ripped across the open ground. Rifles 
cracked in all directions, while here and there, 
tumbled in the most fantastic positions and pos- 
tures, lay brown men, khaki soldiers, the killed 
and the wounded, and about them men in field- 
grey, the uniform of the German, 
“What's that? Ain’t that the spot? Looks like 
that sniper’s hole that we spotted months ago when
-P-A-G-E-89
  
The Somme Offensive 85 
we first came out,” shouted Bill, pointing to his 
front, and repeating the words at the top of his 
voice, for ordinary tones were drowned in the 
hubbub. ‘There! That was a man moving. 
That’s the machine-gun, too.” 
“Hold on!” commanded Roger. ‘Here you, 
Tomkins, and the men on your right. Just keep 
up a steady fire at the spot to which Bill here’s 
pointing. Bill, pull my pack off, will you? 
That’s the thing. Now, I’m off to drop on those 
fellows.” 
The platoon officer, who, like his men, had thrown 
himself on the ground so as to obtain cover, now 
crept across to Roger, having seen his prepara- 
tions. 
“Capital idea,” he said, grinning delightedly, 
for this young man seemed to be happiest in the 
midst of battle. ‘‘Look here, Sergeant Sullivan, 
you rush ’em from this side, while I creep over 
yonder and come in from that. Don’t fire. Use 
your bayonet only, just as I shall. Then there 
won’t be any chance of our blazing into one an- 
other.” 
Roger slid away at once, while the officer went 
in the opposite direction. Meanwhile half a dozen 
men kept up a desultory fire upon the spot which 
had attracted Bill’s attention. ‘‘Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat- 
tat,” the gun coughed. ‘‘Tat-tat-tat,” it spluttered, 
and the brown earth in front, and even under Roger’s 
comrades, spurted jets of brown dust, while flints 
ricochetted in all directions. A shell whined its 
way toward them from the British guns and plumped
-P-A-G-E-90
  86 Under Haig in Flanders 
into the ground within a few feet of that German 
nest, where the machine-gun was in action. No, 
it had not rooted out the pest, for ‘‘ Rat-a-tat-tat- 
tat,” it still hiccoughed. ‘‘ Tat-tat-tat.” 
Roger, slinking down a hollow, gained a spot 
nearer that nest, and in time a better view of it. 
Hidden in a concreted hole, with a cupola of the 
same material over them, were half a dozen men, 
one of whom was at that moment bolting from the 
shelter. Ah! He was down. One of the men 
watching behind had caught sight of the man, and 
there he was sprawling. Then another man put 
his head up, bobbed down again, and finally came 
clambering out. 
“Getting scared,” thought Roger. ‘But they 
won’t relinquish that post till they’re driven to do 
so. There it goes again. Hang that gun, for I 
see it’s getting into those troops on the brow of the 
hill yonder. Well, here goes for it.” 
He leaped to his feet, swung his bayonet to the 
sront, and went headlong toward the machine-gun 
position. Flick! A bullet swept past his ear. 
Click! He heard the closing of the lock as one of 
the garrison of the machine-gun nest threw out the 
empty cartridge. Roger could see the muzzle of 
the rifle now, and watched it swing in his direction. 
Then he dived to one side just as the report came, 
and then dashed on without hesitation. As he did 
so a short, stocky figure came sprinting from the 
opposite direction, and he and the officer met at the 
entrance to the concreted cover. Literally throw- 
ing themselves through the opening they fell upon
-P-A-G-E-91
  
The Somme Offensive 87 
the German gunners there, and at once were en- 
gaged in a desperate conflict. 
“Ha!” grunted one of the Germans, parrying 
Roger’s thrust with a rifle and bayonet which he 
had snatched up. ‘‘ Ha!” he grunted again, mak- 
ing a sudden thrust at him. 
“Got him!” bellowed the officer, running his 
man through at that instant. 
“Same here,” shouted Roger, sweating with 
excitement. Then he went down with a huge Ger- 
man gripping him, while the officer and another 
enemy grappled together above, and finally came 
with a thud on those struggling beneath them. 
“‘Reckon that was a pretty close business, eh?” 
said Bill, dragging the lifeless form of the German 
off our hero, while others of the platoon gently 
lifted the officer to one side. ‘‘ This here chap had 
you gripped by the neck, and, seein’ how blue you 
are, I should say that a little more and he’d have 
throttled you. Sorry Lieutenant Hawkin’s put out 
o’ action. This here greasy-lookin’ German put 
his bayonet through his thigh, so he’s all right for 
Blighty.” 
To speak the truth, Roger himself felt quite as fit 
for evacuation to England as did the officer, for the 
German with whom he had grappled had proved 
a tough antagonist. He was thoroughly shaken, 
and for a while in far worse condition than was the 
officer. 
“Yes, it was a pretty bit of business,” the latter 
smiled, when Roger staggered across to where 
he was lying, for the wounded officer had been 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  88 Under Haig in Flanders 
placed in a sheltered spot, while one of the regi- 
mental stretcher-bearers had ripped a huge hole in 
his trouser leg and had applied a first field-dressing. 
“‘Machine-gunners want a deal of doing in, and 
those fellows meant business. Sergeant Sullivan, 
I shall make a report of this affair. You’ve shown 
the most commendable dash and splendid bravery. 
Now get me a cigarette, do, and come and sit here 
and talk to me. Talk as man to man, don’t you 
know. I’d like to know more about you.” 
Roger sat himself down beside the officer, as 
became an obedient sergeant, and promptly fainted. 
‘‘Hi!” shouted the gallant lieutenant. ‘Corporal 
Andrews, send over one of those stretcher-bearers 
to see to the Sergeant. Better still, there’s our 
own M.O. [medical officer] coming towards us. 
Ask him to be good enough to step this way and 
have a look at the Sergeant.” 
The platoon had meanwhile halted, having gained 
the position assigned to it, so that the men lay 
stretched on the ground where a sunken road gave 
them cover. And to this spot there now advanced 
the officer whose business it was to attend to the. 
hurts of this particular regiment, a man no longer 
young, with silver hairs showing at his temples, 
but active enough, full of vigour, and delightfully 
careless of his surroundings. Bullets were flicking 
across the ground. Brown puffs of dust told where 
they were striking. And every here and there 
shells thudded into the ground, and sent up cas- 
cades of earth, and sometimes flung a devastating 
shower of steel fragments and flints broadcast across
-P-A-G-E-93
The Somme Offensive 89 
the landscape. Yet it was this officer’s duty to 
attend to the hurts of his men wherever they might 
be at the time, whether at the front or behind the 
line in rest billets. 
“Hallo!” he cried, gaily enough, reaching the 
officer. ‘‘You too! That makes the fifth of ours 
that have got winged, and poor young Crecy has 
gone under. God bless the boy! He was amongst 
the bravest. And what’s to do?” 
“Please see to the Sergeant. He and I rushed 
that machine-gun post together, and came in for 
a tussle. I thought he’d only been shaken, but 
just now he went off into a faint, and he looks to 
me almost as if he were dying.” 
“Dying!” Bill almost blubbered, for he sat now 
by Roger's side, nursing his head on his knee, and 
holding one limp, brown hand. ‘‘ Dying, sir!” he 
gasped brokenly. ‘‘ Not that, sir. He’s—he and 
I are pals. Don’t say that he’s going.” 
“‘There, don’t let’s cry till we know what’s really 
happened,” the medical officer promptly responded, 
giving Bill an assuring pat on the shoulder. 
“Well, he’s breathing, and that’s one good sign, 
and his heart is beating quite reasonably. Fainted, 
did he? What’s this?” : 
It was a broadening patch of red soiling Roger’s 
tunic just under one arm, while the cloth in that 
neighbourhood was torn and blackened. 
“Shot at close quarters. Shouldn’t wonder if it 
happened ‘as he rushed in at the enemy. Let’s see 
what damage it’s done. Not very severe, Corporal, 
I’m certain.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  90 Under Haig in Flanders 
Bill could have blessed him on the spot. ‘I’m 
—thank you, sir,” he said gratefully. ‘‘ He and I, 
you know——” " 
“‘T do,” the doctor answered promptly. ‘‘ Good 
old friends, eh? Seen hard days and fine ones 
together. I fully understand, Corporal. Well, he’s 
not going to die just yet, not nearly. He’s been 
badly hammered, and this gun-shot wound here 
has broken a couple of his ribs rather badly. Ina 
month he’ll have forgotten nearly everything about 
it. Well, we'll patch him up. Feel better, Ser- 
geant?” he asked as Roger opened his eyes. 
“Better! I—I’m all right,” our hero maintained 
stubbornly. Yet was he? When he tried to move 
even so. small a thing as a finger he felt almost in- 
capable, for all the strength seemed to have been 
driven out of ‘his body. His huge frame—for 
months of trench warfare had broadened him won- 
derfully—was as helpless, even more so, than a 
child’s, while he was utterly incapable of lifting his 
head. 
“You'll just lie here as still as possible,” said 
the doctor, when he had given Roger a drink from 
a tin cup which an R.A.M.C. orderly carried. 
“There will be bearers along here very soon, and 
before you know what has happened you'll be in 
clover. The Corporal here will stay with you, and 
your officer will also keep you company.” 
Brushing the dust from his tunic, cast upon it by 
a distant shell-burst, he went on in search of others 
needing his assistance, while Roger and the officer 
lay under the shelter of the bank lining that sunken
-P-A-G-E-95
  The Somme Offensive gt 
road, waiting for the assistance which they knew 
would not be long in coming. And as they waited 
and peered out at the surrounding landscape, now 
no longer smoking, and looked at the red roofs of 
Albert, and at the statue of the Virgin Mary and 
Child tilted at a sharp angle to which German 
cannon had blown it, the tide of war surged on 
before them. The barrage of flame and shrapnel 
and smoke crept ever onward, halting here and there 
where some stubborn enemy post resisted, watering 
the ground with missiles, and then creeping ever 
onward, followed by the khaki host who on this day 
of days were biting their way into the ground once 
held by the enemy. After that host came another 
mob of men, a well-ordered mob, who proceeded to 
clear up the battle-ground already conquered: ord- 
nance men to pick up abandoned rifles and packs 
and helmets and what not; men to retrieve unused 
bombs and grenades which littered the ground in 
some places, and amongst them scattered parties 
of the R.A.M.C., bearing stretchers upon which 
both German and British wounded were soon re- 
clining. 
‘‘My word, you'll soon be in Blighty!” said one 
of them as he bent over Roger. ‘‘Now, mates, 
easy with it. He’s a G.S. of the ribs, and has got 
to be moved carefully. There we are, my lad. 
Why, you’re a sergeant. I didn’t think that, seeing 
that you’re not much more than a youngster. Lift! 
Now off we go.” 
They carried him shoulder-high across the shell- 
pitted ground, and so to a road where little damage
-P-A-G-E-96
  92 Under Haig in Flanders 
had been done. There the stretcher was placed on 
a two-wheeled support, which presently bore him 
to an advanced dressing-station. It was merely a 
well-constructed hole in the ground, with a smoking 
kitchen beside it. But it had comfort in plenty for 
the wounded. 
“Does one good to get a hot meal,” said the 
officer who had accompanied Roger. ‘‘ Look here, 
Sergeant, I’m going to send a chit over to the 
Adjutant, and am going to mention you for dis- 
tinguished conduct. No objection to that—eh? 
Everyone knows that you’ve been selected for a 
commission, and this report will only hasten 
matters.” 
“An officer! And what about me?” grumbled 
Bill, a little later, when he and Roger were alone, 
for the officer had been carried off to an ambulance. 
“What am I todo? Serve on alone? ’Tain’t pos- 
sible.” 
“Alone!” exclaimed Roger, well knowing how- 
ever what Bill meant. ‘‘ You’ll be with the rest of 
our comrades.” 
“And I don’t say that they ain’t right good fel- 
lows; but that ain’t the same sort of thing,” said 
Bill, quite sharply. ‘‘See here, me lad, I’m a-goin’ 
to resign my stripes, if necessary, and come along 
as your servant.” 
No amount of argument would alter his decision, 
and just three weeks later, when Roger, now be- 
coming convalescent, was sent across to England 
to take up the commission which he had already 
been given, Bill went with him. 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  The Somme Offensive 93 
«And what then?” he asked, a month later, when 
both were back in harness in one of the many big 
camps in England. ‘‘Do we return to the old 
regiment, me lad—sir, or ze 
Roger laughed at him. ‘Hard to get out of old 
ways, isn’t it, Bill?” he said. ‘‘ Look here; you’re 
to call me Roger, or me lad, just as you used to do, 
that is, when we’re alone, while I shall stick to Bill. 
What’s doin’, you asked. No, we don’t return to 
the regiment. That is to say, I don’t. Of course, 
it’s for you to choose what you'll do.” 
Bill flared up, and got quite angry. ‘‘As if——” 
he began. ‘You know well enough that you 
and me’s goin’ to stick to one another. What 
else do we do, then, if we don’t go back to our 
fellows?” 
Roger beckoned him closer. ‘‘ Bill,” he said, 
‘“‘can you keep a secret?” 
“Me keep a secret. What secret?” 
“This. They’ve started a new arm of the service, 
and I’ve been offered the command of a certain 
unit.” 
“Unit,” grumbled Bill, scratching his yellow 
head. ‘‘ What sort o’ unit?” 
‘‘Something different to any that you’ve heard 
of. Come closer, for it’s a real secret. I’ve ac- 
cepted the post of commander of a Tank.” 
“A Tank! A—what?” demanded Bill, astonished, 
wondering vaguely whether Roger’s mind were 
wandering. 
‘‘A huge armoured fort, made to grovel its way 
over the ground and across trenches. Something  
-P-A-G-E-98
04 Under Haig in Flanders 
that is still somewhat of an experiment, though 
successful already. A new weapon devised to at- 
tack the German and to force him backward, par- 
ticularly his machine-gunners. Shortly put, a Tank 
is just a sort of pet name for a huge vehicle pro- 
pelled by a petrol motor, covered with steel plates, 
and heavily armed with machine-guns and quick- 
firing cannon.” 
“And you’re to command one! But it means 
that you’ll have to go forward in advance of the 
troops. It—it means a whole heap of excitement,” 
gasped Bill. 
“I believe you,” agreed Roger gaily. ‘We 
shall see quite a lot of the fun. That is, of course, 
if you agree to join me. If not——” 
“‘Blimy!” shouted Bill, getting very much ex- 
cited and interested. ‘‘Join you, me lad, why of 
course I will! It’s a job I wouldn’t miss for any- 
thing.” 
Thus it followed that in a secret place, as became 
such a secret engine, Roger trained his gun and 
his motor crews, and learned how to take a Tank 
into action. Then he crossed the Channel once 
more, and presently his machine forgathered with 
other beasts of similar shape and apparent unwieldi- 
ness in a Tankodrome—their head-quarters. 
‘““There’s a ‘do’ on to-morrow,” he was told. 
“You'd best study these trench maps and photos. 
We're up against a strong place to which Fritz has 
been hanging like a leech, and we’ve got to push 
him out of it. Starting-off time 6 a.m. See that 
you’ve got everything in readiness.” ,
-P-A-G-E-99
  The Somme Offensive 95 
A September morn, then, saw Roger board his 
Tank and set off for the adjacent front, for a land- 
scape aflame with bursting shells as of yore, with 
a barrage blotting out the sky-line. » Yet under 
what different conditions on this occasion, for his 
was the task to advance in front of the attacking 
troops, practically to meet the enemy single-handed.
-P-A-G-E-100
CHAPTER VII 
With the Tanks 
A pamp, early-morning mist had condensed upon 
the steel cuticle of the Tank which Roger was com- 
manding, and dripped like tears from every pro- 
jecting portion of it. Peering out through the 
port which gave him a view to the front, and then 
through those which allowed him a clear vision to 
the rear and on either side, he saw a dull-brown 
sea of earth around him, splotched here and there, 
towards the front in particular, with irregular 
blotches of green, now fast being torn asunder, 
while behind him green fields and uncut crops 
gave a most inviting prospect. 
Quite near at hand were other leviathan Tanks 
similar to his, ready to go into action; while a little 
in rear were reserve battalions, kept in hand in case 
they should be wanted. 
Someone shouted. An officer came near. ‘‘Move 
on!” he commanded abruptly. ‘‘You know your 
objective? Then carry on; and good luck to you!” 
“Forward!” Roger gave the order, and at once 
the man controlling the mechanism of this enor- 
mous machine let his clutch in and engaged his 
gears, and set those two broad, long steel tapes, 
96
-P-A-G-E-101
With the Tanks 97 
which encircled the machine on either side, running, 
from its prow right back to the stern, slowly moving 
about the gear-wheels they encircled. 
The crew clung to the nearest object, for experi- 
ence had told them that, nicely padded though the 
interior was, rough ground and much shaking led 
to violent concussions and to many bruises. 
“Dead ahead!” said Roger, now peering through 
his glasses and watching the storm of shells burst- 
ing on the hill-side in front, beyond our own 
trenches. ‘‘Speed her up a bit whilst we’ve got 
level country.” 
“Speed her up? Yes, sir,” the driver responded. 
Faster went those gear-wheels, propelling those 
long steel tapes, and louder grew the noise within 
the Tank. Drops of perspiration began to show 
on the foreheads of the crew, and dripped from 
beneath their steel helmets. The sun came up 
now, and in a twinkling, it seemed, dried up those 
other drops which had condensed outside on the 
steel cuticle. A glance through the ports: showed 
the upper surface of this massive machine camou- 
flaged, painted every variety of colour, bumping 
and heaving as it went along, brilliant in the sun- 
shine. 
“Hurrah!” someone shouted. ‘‘Go on into it, 
‘Mack’!” and an answering yell came from the 
interior. 
“We'll show ’em!” muttered one of the crew. 
““There’s those there chaps along with ‘ The Tower 
of London’ what said that they’ll beat us, that 
they’ll lay out more German dug-outs than us, and 
(¢:902) 7
-P-A-G-E-102
  98 Under Haig in Flanders 
hold up more of them Germans—we’ll show ’em 
what ‘Mack’ can do! She’s just a d’isy!” 
“Aye, aye!” answered his nearest comrade, his 
eyes sparkling in the gloom which obscured the 
interior of the Tank. ‘‘Aye, Bill, she’s a d’isy!” 
And Bill Andrews, who by hook or by crook had 
contrived to accompany our hero, with the rank of 
Corporal, gripped his hand as if to thank him. 
“Daisy” indeed! Those who watched the lum- 
bering, gigantic carcass of this Tank called ‘‘Mack” 
would hardly have called her that; for the name 
daisy appertains rather to something delicate and 
unsubstantial. This monster engine of destruction 
heaved forward over the bumpy ground, nosed its 
way over the flats which had once been occupied 
by Germans, clambered across watercourses as 
though she could not deign to notice them, flopped 
over shell-holes which would have easily received 
a wagon, and coming across a patch of brambles 
growing beside a tree of no mean proportions, 
chewed the whole lot up, snapped the tree off, send- 
ing it down with a report as of a rifle, and went on 
unhindered and unhesitating. 
There was pandemonium outside. British guns, 
far in rear of ‘‘Mack”, were barking at the Ger 
mans. Shells whinnied and whined their way 
overhead, the noise they made drowned by the 
sound of the engine; but oncoming shells as they 
burst about this machine could be heard distinctly, 
and one, happening to explode not ten yards away, 
actually shook the leviathan. 
Bill grinned, his nearest mate did likewise, and
-P-A-G-E-103
  With the Tanks 99 
began to chatter. Roger turned sharply, hearing 
them, and scowled. 
«Stop talking!” he ordered; whereat Bill became 
silent and almost savage. 
“Lor’!” he gasped; “to hear him! Ever since 
he’s got this commission and been given a job, and 
a responsible one, too, he’s become different. Oh 
yes, I know, he’s just as friendly as ever, and always 
will be; but when he’s on duty don’t he snap his 
orders? Stop talking, indeed! Six months ago 
I’d have clouted his head if he’d jawed to me in 
that way.” 
Roger turned again, hearing him—or rather 
seeing him mutter. 
“Look here, Corporal Andrews,” he said, ‘‘if 
you’re going to disturb things here, you’d better 
drop out while there’s time and go back to billets! 
Stop her!” 
The man in charge of the engine pushed out his 
clutch, and slipped his gear-lever into neutral. 
“« Stop her!” he ‘repeated, as if he was driving an 
ocean liner. 
“Now,” said Roger severely, turning again on 
the culprit, whereat Bill subsided, hid his face in 
the gun-port nearest at hand, and appeared to be 
very much engaged in observing his surroundings. 
Then Roger smiled grimly, and nodded. ‘‘Go 
ahead!” he said, ‘‘and quick! For I want to make 
good whilst we’ve fairly good going. When we 
get across our own trenches into the ground we 
have been recently shelling, it will be a different 
matter altogether. Shove her ahead!”
-P-A-G-E-104
  roo = Under Haig in Flanders 
“ Aye, aye, sir!” sang out the driver. 
Lurching and rolling and grinding its path on- 
ward, the Tank slowly approached that winding 
line which cut its way across the near horizon, and 
heads could be seen behind the parapet of the 
British trenches; then, as this huge steel beast drew 
nearer, and its crew could look a little farther into 
the trenches, the bodies of men could be seen, 
while hundreds and hundreds of expectant eyes were 
turned upon them. Men cheered, the shout ran down 
the line on either side till it was lost in the distance. 
Then there was a move in one particular part as the 
Tank tossed its way towards it. 
Bump! The prow overlapped the trench, seemed 
to sniff at the other side and closely inspect it, then 
it laid its nose on the far shore of the trench, smashed 
the parapet down, crawled forward, lurched, and 
finally dragged its tail after it. Another bump, 
and a resounding bang, which threw more than 
one man from his hand-hold, and then rapid pro- 
gress downward till they reached the bottom of a 
hill which had once been a German mine, and 
which was now a mine-crater. 
‘‘Shove her up!” commanded Roger. ‘‘She’ll 
want all you can give her, for it’s a steep climb. 
Gun on the right; look out for those fellows who 
are shelling us from that direction.” 
His words were drowned a moment later by the 
sudden rattle of the machine-gun mounted over- 
head; for the gunner there had caught sight of a 
number of Germans. They were right ahead, stand- 
ing behind a bank of earth which hid them from
-P-A-G-E-105
  With the Tanks 1or 
the British in their trenches, yet visible now that 
the Tank had clambered out of the mine-crater. 
Quick as a flash, the man in command of that 
machine-gun mounted overhead put his sights on 
them, and now as Roger looked they were fleeing 
in all directions. 
“Stop her!” suddenly shouted Roger. ‘ We'll 
go off now to the left, for they’ve got their guns 
ranged on the line we are following.” 
“That was a lucky move,” he told himself a 
minute later, seeing shells plumping into the 
ground to his right, ground which he would have 
been covering had he continued the course he had 
then been following. ‘‘ Thing is to change course 
pretty often, whenever the ground allows. Ha! 
I don’t much like the look of the place we have got 
before us!” 
Somewhere on his left a machine-gun spluttered 
—an enemy machine-gun—and bullets rattled on 
the carcass of the Tank till the interior was filled 
with reverberating echoes. A shell burst behind 
her tail, and fragments swept like hail over her, 
glissading from her steel carcass. But ‘‘ Mack” 
went on, without so much as a thrill and without 
a tremble, save, indeed, for the trembling trans- 
mitted by her engines, for the rattle of those steel 
chains which were the means of her propulsion. 
She rolled this way and that; mounting what 
seemed a natural hillock, she crushed it under 
her and went on, leaving behind the debris of 
a smashed-in German dug-out. 
A hundred figures suddenly stood up in a trench 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  ro2 Under Haig in Flanders 
which the Tank now overlapped, and shouted 
“Kamerad!” But as the Tank waddled on, ignor- 
ing them entirely, they fired salvos from their rifles 
at her, while a dozen of the bolder spirits ran out 
with bombs in their hands and flung them against 
this adventurous invader. Yet ‘‘ Mack” did not 
wince, shed not so much as a particle of her steel 
coating; she only barked, and screeched like a viper 
at them, and, when the rattle of her machine-gun had 
ended, those Germans had ceased all opposition. 
Bill shouted, and as the din within the Tank 
prevented Roger from hearing him, he stretched 
over from the gun he was commanding and dragged 
him by the sleeve. 
“Coming nearer!” he said. ‘‘They’ll have the 
range of us in a jiffy! There’s one of ’em!” 
“Shells!” exclaimed Roger, turning swiftly to 
look out, and dodging, for a shell whistled just 
over the top of the Tank, while another struck the 
ground not ten feet away from ‘‘ Mack”, and, burst- 
ing with tremendous force, slung a cascade of brown 
earth up in the air, the resulting fall practically 
obliterating the machine grovelling beneath it. 
“But, bless you, this ’ere Tank don’t take no 
notice of cascades of earth,” growled Bill, holding 
on to his gun, and swinging it to another spot 
where a German machine-gun nest had come into 
view. ‘My hat! that hit ’em, plunk! And they 
won’t fire any more of their bullets. Ah! that was 
a nasty one! Give us a heave! That’s badly 
shook the old lady. You’d best be changing 
course!” he shouted, dragging at Roger’s sleeve
-P-A-G-E-107
  With the Tanks 103 
again, for Bill still, in moments of great excite- 
ment, took some liberties with his old pal, now 
his commanding officer. ‘‘Change course!” he 
yelled. ‘‘They’ve got the range of us and will 
smash us into powder!” 
Roger grinned back at him. 
“You look after your gun!” he shouted, and 
then set his machine crawling away to the right, 
away from the track he had been following, and 
which was now being shelled very heavily from 
German guns hidden in the far distance. 
He glanced upwards. Two enemy aeroplanes 
were circling high overhead, and near them a 
British ‘“‘chaser” plane was just about to engage 
them. He looked behind. The landscape, clear 
and green and beautiful, looked totally unpeopled; 
yet the roar of cannon came from that direction, 
while flashes could be observed in dark corners. 
As for the whine and whistle of shells passing over- 
head, he could not hear them, though he knew they 
were there, while those thousands of tin-helmeted 
infantry men lay hidden in their trenches. 
What a contrast that scene behind the British 
front was to this ‘‘ No Man’s Land” he was travers- 
ing! Shell-holes everywhere, some almost deep 
enough to swallow the huge machine he captained, 
others filled to the brim with rain-water, and offer- 
ing an open-air bath in which a dozen men could 
have plunged comfortably; saps and trenches 
seamed the ground, and every here and there a 
little bump, a pinnacle of earth, hid a concreted 
German machine-gun post; while goodness only
-P-A-G-E-108
  ro4 Under Haig in Flanders 
knows how many dug-outs there were deep down 
below, sheltering men awaiting the oncoming of 
the British. 
Crash! Something had gone wrong. The 
machinery within the Tank clattered and vibrated, 
while ‘‘Mack” herself began slowly to topple over. 
The crunch of masonry being splintered by the 
massive weight of this Tank, the rending of big 
timbers, came to the ears of the crew; then of a 
sudden ‘‘Mack” turned almost topsy-turvy, slid 
into a deep depression, flopped still lower, and 
lay inert, one of her front plates perforated by a 
beam of steel which had formed the roof of a 
dug-out. 
“Gurr! What a rattle there was within the 
Tank, and how her steel driving-chains grated 
and roared as they made futile efforts to grip the 
earth and stones and debris beneath them! ‘‘Mack” 
reared her nose in the air, and made a desperate 
attempt to drag her huge carcass out of this hole 
which had entrapped her. Then she fell back 
with a crash, and that same steel beam gave her 
a mortal wound, thrusting right up through the 
floor and disabling her machinery entirely. Almost 
at the same moment heads appeared from the en- 
trances of other dug-outs, a machine-gun opened 
upon the Tank, and within a minute or more, hun- 
dreds of the enemy came rushing towards her. 
Let us leave Roger and Bill and the gallant 
comrades who with them constituted the crew of 
that leviathan which had dared to creep in front
-P-A-G-E-109
  With the Tanks 105 
of our attacking troops, and return awhile to the 
sleepy, peaceful hamlet which our hero had left 
now many months ago, where the ‘Morning 
Sun”, that charming hostelry of which Sergeant 
Higgins was the proprietor, still threw its doors 
open widely and offered a welcome to the traveller; 
where the one single street straggled up the hill, 
and where still the Dene and the Hall were the 
only two residences worthy of particular mention. 
There was a loud rapping at the door of the 
“Morning Sun” that night of the tragedy we have 
recounted, just about the time when Roger entered 
the train and first made the acquaintance of Bill 
Andrews. 
“‘Hi!” someone shouted. ‘Hi, Sergeant Hig- 
gins! Come out ’ere; there’s summat for ’e to 
see.” ‘ 
The worthy Sergeant emerged, carrying a lan- 
tern, and together he and the countryman who had 
summoned him bent over the form of that indivi- 
dual whom Roger had struck. 
“‘ Dead!” the countryman whispered in awed and 
hushed voice. 
“Go on!” said the Sergeant. ‘‘He’s got a badly 
cracked pate, but he’s breathing. See here, there’s 
a cut right across his head, and here’s the bit of 
broken stone he fell against. What's this? His 
nose is swollen, and he’s bleeding from the mouth! 
He’s lost one of his front teeth. There’s been a 
row here—a fight. I’m too old a pugilist to be 
taken in, I can tell you, and I’ve seen signs like 
this too often to be mistaken. George, you go 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
  106 Under Haig in Flanders 
along and get the police; I’ll stand watch over 
this fellow.” 
Very wisely the Sergeant called to his wife to 
bring him some water and the wherewithal to clean 
the wounds of the man lying in the centre of the 
main street of Hurslet, while he made no attempt 
to carry the man within the ‘“‘ Morning Sun”. 
“‘There’s been a ruction out here,” he told his 
wife, ‘‘and there may have been foul play for all 
I know. The police will want to know exactly 
what’s happened, and as this fellow may not be 
able to talk again, though that is unlikely, and the 
chap he was fighting with isn’t anywhere near, it 
is only right to leave things as they were, so as to 
give the police every opportunity. Ah, Sergeant!” 
he sang out, seeing a figure approaching, and be- 
hind the figure George, the countryman who had 
first given the alarm; ‘‘there’s a job for you here, 
and it looks rather like a serious business. Here’s 
a lamp; take a look round. I should say that 
there was a fight just here, and that this man was 
struck full in the mouth, for he’s lost one tooth and 
was knocked over. See this stone here? It’s a 
sharp flint, and there’s blood on it. Now look at 
his head; we’ve just popped a wet towel over it te 
keep the dirt out; but there’s a cut that the Doctor 
will have to attend to. Clear, isn’t it?” 
You couldn’t expect a policeman to give his 
opinion on the spot. It was only right that this 
sergeant of the police should carefully walk round 
the spot where the injured man was lying, examin- 
ing carefully every object with the help of the lamp
-P-A-G-E-111
  With the Tanks 107 
which Sergeant Higgins had given him. Then he 
coughed in the most significant manner. 
“It’s been foul play!” he said. ‘‘There’s been 
a tussle out here; and from what I know of this 
man it will be he who attacked someone. As to 
how he was knocked out, you can see for yourself, 
Sergeant Higgins, that he was struck full in the 
mouth, and that his head came in contact with this 
flint, and that, of course, gave him the wound and 
robbed him of consciousness.” 
He told the tale just as if he himself had made 
the discovery, ignoring the fact that Sergeant 
Higgins had told him, practically in the same 
words, what had happened, some minutes earlier. 
‘Best lift him into the ‘Morning Sun’ then— 
eh?” suggested Sergeant Higgins; ‘‘then you can 
think out what you will do. Of course we shall 
want a conveyance to take the man to the Cottage 
Hospital, and someone ought to go across to warn 
Dr. Norman.” 
“Ah! Dr. Norman,” said the sergeant of police 
thoughtfully. ‘I met his youngster up the top of 
the hill only a little time ago, and he looked funny. 
It couldn’t be—eh? Sergeant Higgins. a 
“Young Roger Norman the one to have knocked 
this fellow out? Hardly likely!” exclaimed Ser- 
geant Higgins indignantly. ‘‘He’s a quiet sort 
of fellow, and that you know well enough.” 
‘‘Certainly,” admitted the sergeant of police; 
“that’s agreed, Sergeant Higgins. There never 
was a quieter nor a better lad. But I tell you I 
met him going up the hill just a little while ago,  
-P-A-G-E-112
  108 Under Haig in Flanders 
and when I turned my lamp on him it wasn’t the 
usual frank and gay Roger that I saw, but a young 
chap who was trembling, who’d been upset by 
something, and who told me a fib—said that he 
was going into the town to do a bit of shopping. 
It’s—well—it looks fishy!” 
It looked still worse when Dr. Norman was called, 
and, having arrived at the ‘‘Morning Sun” and 
attended to the injuries of the man who had been 
found in the street outside, took the sergeant of 
police and Sergeant Higgins aside and disclosed 
the note which Roger had left. 
“This is an important piece of evidence,” he 
said. ‘I leave it to you, Sergeant,” he went on, 
addressing the policeman, ‘‘to take whatever action 
you think is necessary, guided by what you have 
seen, and by the contents of this letter. Only I 
ask you to consider what you would have done at 
Roger's age. He says here that he was set upon 
suddenly by two men, that he defended himself, 
that he killed one of them, and then, fearful of 
what must happen, left home, as he says, to become 
a soldier. I will do all I can to trace him. I wish 
he hadn’t gone, for this is just the very time when 
he should have Tematned at home to ‘face the 
music’. But—— 
“But,” burst in Sergeant Higgins with unusual 
warmth, ‘‘but you might have done the same 
thing, Doctor, at his time of life, and I should 
probably have bolted in just the same manner; the 
sergeant of police here knows that he would have 
been tempted to go. It’s not a nice thing for a
-P-A-G-E-113
With the Tanks 109 
young chap in his position to suddenly find himself 
running the danger of being accused of murder. 
He wouldn’t think, and we wouldn’t think, at the 
time, with this fellow lying looking like dead in the 
street, about the attack being unsuspected, and 
about the man’s having come about his hurt 
through his own fault. We'd have been scared. 
We'd have bolted—eh, Sergeant?” 
“Hum!” The sergeant of police considered the 
matter. Then when. the ruffian who had attacked 
Roger had been taken to the hospital, he and the 
Doctor and Sergeant Higgins drove off to the 
adjacent town, where they consulted a magistrate. 
The following day an inquiry was held, and 
evidence was produced to prove conclusively that 
Roger was guiltless. 
“Then I shall make no further effort to induce 
him to come back,” said the Doctor. ‘‘ The authori- 
ties have telegraphed to all their recruiting depots 
without avail. Let Roger go into the army, as 
I know he intended to do. In time he will write to 
his father. I’m not afraid that he will fail. He’s 
one of those downright fellows who will do well as 
a soldier.” 
Roger had indeed done well. Bill Andrews was, 
with good reason, enthusiastic about him, . while 
already Lieutenant Sullivan—commander of a 
Tank—had won the approval of his superior 
officers.. More than that, Roger had long since 
been able to let his father know that he was alive 
and well and thriving, begging him at the same 
time to keep his change of name a secret. 
 
-P-A-G-E-114

But what of Frank Riven, dawdling his days 
away up at the Hall in stately magnificence? What 
of his charming cousin? And, again, what had 
happened to that rascal Ern, and the other one 
whom Roger had beaten so severely? One would 
have hoped that our hero had seen the last of them, 
yet this was not to be the case; for one at least of 
the trio of men was to dog his footsteps.
-P-A-G-E-115
CHAPTER VIII 
An Underground Duel 
‘‘SuutT all the ports,” shouted Roger as the Tank 
he commanded came to an abrupt halt and settled 
down into the depths of a dug-out into which it 
had fallen. ‘‘Let’s think for a bit; those fellows 
can go on heaving bombs and firing bullets till we 
have come to some decision.” 
“But—but—” shouted Bill, squinting through 
one of the ports left at the side for observation 
purposes, “‘ but if they can get a bomb right under 
us, that’ll do real damage. Ain’t we in a dug-out, 
sir? Couldn’t we get out and make along it, and 
tackle ’em from underneath?” 
Crash! A German, standing some little distance 
from them, threw a hand-grenade, lobbing it beauti- 
fully on the very top of this huge machine. The 
explosion which followed almost stunned those with- 
in, while it positively shook the steel leviathan. 
“‘Up there it won’t do us much harm,” thought 
Roger, as he peered out at the enemy; ‘‘ but if they 
could sling them right underneath us, which I 
rather doubt, they might, as Bill says, smash us 
up altogether. This Tank is stranded. Probably 
itll never get lifted out of this hole, for she’s 
lll

; 
wedged in firmly. Then what I’ve got to think 
about is the crew; I’ve got to save ’em if I can, 
. and at the same time hold up as many of the enemy 
| as possible. Dismount those machine-guns,” he 
| commanded suddenly, turning upon the man in 
charge of them. -‘‘ You other fellows pick up those 
boxes of ammunition and make ready to leave the 
Tank. Hurry with it, for just now seems to me 
the opportunity to get away without the enemy 
knowing what’s happened.” 
A sudden change had, in fact, come upon the 
situation of affairs since the Tank subsided into 
her inglorious condition. A minute ago, as soldiers 
peered out into the open, there seemed at least a 
hundred Germans hovering about them, while one, 
bolder than the rest, had even leapt on to the top of 
the Tank and had hammered upon it with a trench- 
ing tool till he had made the steel coat ‘‘ Mack” 
wore ring again, and the interior echo. Then for 
some reason, unperceived by those within, the 
enemy had disappeared entirely, though later they 
understood that another Tank passing within range 
had turned its machine-gun upon them, scattering 
them, and driving them down underneath the 
ground into their shelters. 
‘“‘Just the very opportunity for us,” thought 
Roger; ‘‘they’ve gone below probably for pro- 
tection, and, yes, there’s another Tank over there, 
and it must be her guns that have driven ’em 
underground. Good! Now’s our time! We are 
useless in here, and stand the chance of being blown 
up any moment. They’re bound to have some sort  
-P-A-G-E-117
  An Underground Duel 113 
of explosives in their dug-outs, and boxed in this 
Tank we shall be unable to prevent their creeping 
beneath her; but we might put up quite a good 
show if we were in a dug-out. Open that door!” 
he shouted. ‘‘ Now, out you go, and follow me. 
Bring the machine-guns, your rifles, and every 
scrap of ammunition.” 
It was no easy job to squeeze through the half- 
open door, for a mass of crushed masonry pre- 
vented its opening to the full extent, and at the 
best of times the exit from the Tank was anything 
but easy. However, Roger was able to squeeze 
his way through the narrow opening, and then 
along beside the projection which carried guns, 
and so to the prow of the Tank. There was a hole 
there, just showing beneath it, and sliding into that, 
he lowered himself into what was left of the par- 
ticular dug-out into which ‘‘ Mack” had seen fit to 
crush her ponderous weight. Behind him there 
was a tumbled mass of concrete and masonry, steel 
beams and earth, with some trenching tools, a rifle 
or so, and other impedimenta visible beneath the 
fallen debris. But in front there was a big open 
void, some underground passage, perhaps even a 
barrack-room constructed for the Germans. 
‘Better than nothing,” he thought. ‘‘We’ve got 
to wall it in, though, at the far end, or else they’ll be 
able to concentrate men here and rush us. 
‘Here, Bill,” he called, ‘‘ get your gun forward 
some twenty yards if you can, and take anything 
to build up a barricade. Send two or three of the 
men on to find sand-bags.” 
(0.902) 8
-P-A-G-E-118
  14° Under Haig in Flanders 
Bill grinned in the semi-darkness, and began to 
undertake the task with enthusiasm. 
‘Here, you,” he said, catching hold of a diminu- 
tive person—one chosen, indeed, for his size, for big 
men are not required in Tanks—‘‘here, you, get 
for’ard and forage round and bring back sand-bags. 
If you can find food and water, just shout, for it'll 
be more valuable to us here than will ammunition. 
See here, me lad,” he went on, gripping another of 
the men told off to his machine-gun, ‘‘a bag full 
of bombs—them hand-grenades the Germans love 
so much—would be the thing for us; then you get 
in at it. Now, this is the place for the gun. What’s 
this? a switch! Why, electric light! Blest if this 
ain’t a luxury!” 
Bill, like Roger and the rest of his comrades, 
knew well enough that electric light, down in the 
amazing dug-outs the Germans have prepared all 
along the Western Front, was nothing out of the 
ordinary—indeed knew that it was fitted in every 
dug-out; but to find a switch so readily, and, press- 
ing upon it, to flood the place with light, was 
indeed a surprise, and one which delighted them. 
Right overhead a bulb cast its beams on every 
side, showing a wide cavern with vertical walls 
and a timbered ceiling propped by concrete beams. 
Towards the end could be seen a broad flight of 
stairs going upward, while close at hand was a 
brazier, though in these summer months there was 
no coal within it. Directly above could be seen 
a round opening, a tube leading upward through 
thirty or forty feet of soil which was piled over-
-P-A-G-E-119
  An Underground Duel 115 
head, and then turning abruptly towards the British 
lines from which Roger and his crew had just 
made their progress. 
Roger looked at it closely, peered about him, 
and then, going to the side of the dug-out, snatched 
up an object. 
“Just as I thought,” he told Bill, who was busily 
setting up his machine-gun; ‘‘it’s a periscope 
which acts also as a ventilator, and will give us 
a good idea of what’s happening above ground. 
Here, you, my lad, fix it up and stand here, and 
tell us what’s happening. Now, boys, fill in that 
gap behind as quick as youcan. What we've got to 
do is to build ourselves in, as it were, at this end, 
so that we can’t be taken on both sides; that'll leave 
the Germans only the steps yonder down which 
they must come to fetch us, or down which alone 
they can fling their bombs,” 
There was great movement down in the dug- 
out for some fifteen minutes, during which time the 
man posted at the periscope reported that none of 
the enemy were yet to be seen. Bill rapidly got 
his machine-gun into position, while the second 
one also was placed beside him; then sand-bags, 
which had been found at the far end, and seemed 
to have been stored there for some purpose, prob- 
ably with a view to repairing damages to the 
dug-out should they occur, had been dragged back 
to the spot where the machine-guns were stationed, 
and very rapidly a wall was constructed right across 
this underground cavern. Placed some five feet 
on either side of the centre of this wall were the

machine-guns, their muzzles projecting through it, 
though the remainder of these vicious machines 
was hidden entirely from the eyes of anyone who 
happened to come down the stairs opposite. 
‘“‘Now, pile more bags on top,” shouted Roger, 
“and one of you can take a look round to see if 
there are any more ventilators; if there are, we 
shall have to fill ’em up, for one of the things we’ve 
got to fear most of all is gas. These Huns will 
poison anything these days—water or air—and if 
they can’t get at us with rifles or grenades, or 
machine-guns or shells, you may depend upon it, 
they are certain to think of some other ‘frightful- 
ness’. Turning the tube from one of their gas 
reservoirs down below here would be just the thing 
they’d think about. So, look lively!” 
“And get your gas helmets ready,” added Bill, 
who was wonderfully helpful to our hero. ‘‘What’s 
that you’ve got there, young Jimmy? Where’ve 
you been? I see you just now coming down the 
stairs, which makes it look as though you’ve been 
paying a sort of pleasant visit to the Germans.” 
Anyone would have thought the same if they’d 
looked at the grinning face of the ‘‘Tommy” who 
now approached the wall on the far side, and slung 
a number of articles over it. Sweat was pouring 
from his brow, while his face shone in the rays of 
the electric light. 
“You asked for food and drink, Corporal 
Andrews,” he said lamely; ‘well, I went to 
fetch it.” 
‘Well done!” cried Roger, delighted. ‘‘ Half
-P-A-G-E-121
An Underground Duel 117 
a dozen good-sized bottles of water—eh? and a 
couple of haversacks of rations; this, with what 
we’ve brought ourselves, will keep us going for 
two or three days at least—that’s splendid!” 
“‘Where did you get ’em from?” demanded Bill, 
hauling this diminutive soldier over the sand- 
bag wall, and holding him in front of him while he 
cross-examined the youngster. ‘‘ Really a-visiting 
the Germans?” 
The youngster beamed on him. ‘Yes, Cor- 
poral,” he answered. ‘‘ There wasn’t a soul about, 
and not a sound—at least not a sound of German 
feet, though one could hear the bang of shells and 
a machine-gun rattling. So I went up the stairs 
and found that they turn off sharp left and climb 
right to the surface, but they also turned off to the 
right, and went right down again into another 
dug-out. It was empty—that is,” he added, grin- 
ning slightly, ‘‘empty but for lots of rifles, bunks 
all along the side, blankets, and so on, and these 
’ere bottles and haversacks.” 
Roger was over the wall in an instant, and, order- 
ing his men to remain where they were, ran forward 
to the steps and crept up them cautiously. Turning 
his head at an angle, he was able to see far above 
him, where those sloping steps above gained the 
open, an oblong patch of light, and framed in that 
patch, as it were, a huge flash of smoke and flame 
overhead, where a high-explosive shrapnel shell 
was bursting. Then he turned to his right, and, 
descending a short flight of steps, found himself in 
the dug-out which the young soldier had just 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  m8 Under Haig in Flanders 
visited. It was brilliantly illuminated, and the 
electric light served to show that it was quite 
empty. Traversing it rapidly, Roger found another 
flight of steps at the far end leading at a sharp 
angle to another staircase to the open,,and once 
again into a dug-out farther along. 
“‘And so it goes on, I suppose,” he thought, 
“‘one dug-out communicating with another, and 
bolt-holes at regular intervals. Seems to me that 
we've got to watch three places or quarters from 
which we can be attacked; fellows might descend 
from above, turn that corner, and be down the steps 
and into the dug-out in a moment; others might 
come along this dug-out, being reinforced from far- 
ther along, and those, attacking with the others 
from above, would certainly be too much for us. 
Also, there is the crushed-in dug-out behind, 
through which the Germans might dig their way 
after an interval. Good! I think I know what to 
do! Tl get back and talk it over with Bill.” 
He raced back along the dug-out, up the stairs, 
down again, till he was close to the sand-bagged 
wall, through which the two machine-guns grinned 
at him, and above the top lip of which half a dozen 
heads of the crew he commanded could be seen, 
and half a dozen pairs of eyes peered at him. 
‘‘Four of you men come along with me at once,” 
he said. ‘Bill, post one man just at the top of 
these stairs, or, better still, go there yourself, and, 
if you can, climb up them and see what’s doing. 
Wait, though! I forgot the periscope. That should 
be quite sufficient without our exposing anyone to
-P-A-G-E-123
  An Underground Duel 119 
danger. Post yourself there, and have a man on 
this side of the wall whom you cari send to warn 
us. Leave one man at the back, near the Tank, so 
as to make quite sure that the Germans won’t come 
in from that direction. Now, me lads,” he said, as 
his men came swarming over the sand-bags, having 
left their rifles on the far side, ‘‘let’s get to this 
work as rapidly as possible. There are sand-bags 
in the dug-out just beyond. I want them brought 
along, and the whole gap leading from it to these 
stairs filled in.’ One of you look round for a crow- 
bar, too, for if we can break down the stairs, and 
make a mess of the place, it’ll delay them far longer 
than will sand-bags.” 
They worked with furious energy for the half- 
hour which followed; men dragging sand-bags 
along and throwing them up the stairs, where they 
were at once piled out of the way, so that once the 
last man was through, they could be piled up so as 
to fill the gap. Then with a long bar of iron which 
they had fortunately discovered, and helped by a 
beam of wood torn from the dug-out, where it had 
done service in supporting one of the double tier 
of bunks for the German soldiers, they levered up 
the woodwork of the stairs leading from the second 
dug-out and destroyed them. 
‘Now, up with the wall,” said Roger, who by 
this time was working in his shirt-sleeves. ‘‘ As 
soon as we have got one layer of bags in place we 
will put others, for we can’t have too many of them. 
Ha! That’s you, Bill. What’s the report?” 
Bill looked quite excited.  
-P-A-G-E-124
  1x0 ~=— Under Haig in Flanders 
“Things is going to move, sir,” he said. 
“There's been heavy shelling, for I think our 
observers must have seen ‘‘ Mack” come to grief 
and tumble into the dug-out; anyway they must 
have seen the Germans come out and begin to 
bomb us, so they turned every gun they’d got on 
the spot hereabouts, and have been lifting the 
ground as if there was earthquakes. But that’s 
stopped now, and the Germans are coming up from 
their dug-outs again. They are hunting around;_ 
one of ’em’s crept along towards the Tank. Looks 
to me as though we should soon be up against it!” 
Up against it indeed! They had a horde of 
furious Germans swarming round their hiding-place 
within the next ten minutes. With the help of that 
useful periscope Roger was able to observe heads 
being thrust up from burrows in the ground at quite 
a far distance, then men appeared, and presently 
came running towards the spot where others had 
already congregated. Men shouted; others, getting 
into position, fired their rifles at almost point-blank 
range at the stranded Tank; while yet again others, 
finding that no machine-gun opened on them from 
it, grew bolder, and, crawling forward, threw gren- 
ades at the camouflaged surface which had protected 
Roger and his crew a little earlier. Bill laughed, 
more than one of his comrades tittered, for it amused 
them vastly to know that the Germans were ex- 
pending so much ammunition uselessly. 
“And it don’t make no manner of difference to 
‘Mack’, do it?” asked Bill, as they listened to the 
report of grenades exploding. ‘‘But I’m sorry,

you boys. She was a nice, kind, gentle beast, and 
did as she was told on most occasions. I don’t 
deny that now and again she got a fit of the sulks, 
and wouldn’t move—at least not forward—and 
sometimes even grudged going backwards when 
you gave her an order. But she did us well on 
the whole, and them Germans has had cause to 
hate her. Bless us! Listen to that one! If that 
ain’t dented her plates, it’s because it’s bad German 
powder.” 
There came an interruption at that moment which 
caused all heads to turn towards the stairway. The 
man whom Roger had now stationed at the periscope 
gave vent to a warning shout, while a grenade, 
dropped from the surface of the land above, clat- 
tered down the steps which were out of view and 
exploded just before it reached the angle, displacing 
timbers, and filling the whole dug-out with smoke 
and dust. After that there came the rush of feet, 
a figure appeared at the angle, someone shouted, 
and then round the corner came a German officer, 
followed by a second, then by a mob of men, some 
armed with rifles and bayonets, others with grenades 
and sticks. 
No need to’ give an order or to tell the crew of 
the Tank what todo. Men put in a tight position, 
such as this was, know well that their lives depend 
on instant action; and as to the courage and resolu- 
tion of the men there was no question. One of the 
machine-guns snapped at once, a rifle was fired 
over the top of the sand-bags, and in an instant 
the dug-out was filled with the deafening roar and  
-P-A-G-E-128
  122 Under Haig in Flanders 
rattle of two machine-guns pumping bullets on the 
stairway into the midst of the attackers. 
“That’s number one!” said Roger, some two 
minutes later. ‘‘That’s stopped them with a ven- 
geance! Now I fancy they’ll go off and talk matters 
over a little, and try and think out some other way 
of getting at us. Let’s try and put ourselves in 
their position for a moment—eh, Bill?” 
“‘That’s just the way, me lad—er, sir,” Bill cor- 
rected. ‘If you get in a tight corner, and don’t 
know much what to do, the best thing after that is 
to put yourself in the position of the fellows that’s 
trying to get at you. What ’ud Ido? What ’ud 
we do if we was up there in the open a-trying to 
dig out rats down below—rats, me lad, with teeth 
all sharpened. We've talked of gas, sir, ain’t we? 
—and that’s always a possibility.” 
““Then what about the Tank behind?” ventured 
one of the men—a sharp little fellow, whose eyes 
sparkled. ‘‘Seems to me that that’s the most vul- 
nerable point there is.” 
“Vulnerable?” said Bill, and grinned as he said 
it. ‘Why, that’s a big ’un for you, Jimmy. That 
means easy to get at, don’t it? Oh yes, of course, 
and I agree. ‘Vulnerable’—eh? Did you hear 
what Jimmy said, sir? He says as how he thinks 
that the Tank behind here is the part from which we 
are now likely to catch it.” 
“Hum!” thought Roger, peering over his shoul- 
der, and then walking back to the spot where the 
prow of the stranded Tank projected into the dug- 
out.
-P-A-G-E-129
  An Underground Duel 123 
It was a queer thing to look upon. The huge, 
broad snout, blunted and covered with its hardened 
cuticles of steel, painted and streaked a variety of 
colours—camouflaged, indeed, just as huts and tents 
and wagons are in Flanders, so as to present a 
neutral tint, as it were, and escape the eagle eye 
of aeroplane observers; this blunt prow—a sorry 
object now—stared him full in the face, while just 
beneath it, as he bent down, he could see the pon- 
derous steel beam which had at one time supported 
the roof of the dug-out beyond. Now, tilted by the 
weight of the Tank as it rode overhead, this beam 
had given way, had stood on its end, and then had 
dealt poor ‘‘ Mack” a mortal wound, thrusting up 
through the base of the prow, tearing a huge rent 
in the steel as if it were composed of mere paper, 
and, as the ungainly and unwieldy leviathan gave a 
gasp—as it were a dying shudder—and came 
down finally with a thud, wrecking the interior 
machinery. 
Yes, peeping in through the rent, Roger could 
see into the interior of the Tank, though for the 
most part it was in darkness. 
‘Wait! What’s that? Look out!” 
He gripped Bill’s sleeve, and that worthy, push- 
ing his commanding officer aside unceremoniously 
—though to be sure there was no one more polite 
than Bill on ordinary occasions—peered in himself, 
and exclaimed loudly: 
““Swop me bob! The legs of them dirty Fritzes 
coming in! They must have opened the door from 
the top; and—s’welp me!—what are they doing?”
-P-A-G-E-130
  
  124 Under Haig in Flanders 
It was Jimmy who supplied the answer—little 
Jimmy, chosen for his diminutive stature, as we 
have said, but as keen, as energetic as any other 
member of the Tank’s crew. ‘‘They’re fillin’ her 
up with explosives!” he shouted, his eyes wide 
open, looking startled. ‘‘They are a-layin’ a train 
out from the door, and I suppose over the top. 
They are——” 
Roger snatched him by the collar of his coat, 
dragged Bill by the sleeve, and turned promptly 
back to the men crouching behind the wall. 
“‘There’s not a moment to lose,” he said. ‘‘Pick 
up your guns, rifles, and ammunition!—follow me!”
-P-A-G-E-131
CHAPTER IX 
Fighting to a Finish 
THERE was bustle down in the depths of that dug- 
out, once Roger and his gallant crew had discovered 
the real meaning of the pause in the conflict which 
had followed that rush of the enemy down the stairs. 
The light gleaming from the electric bulb overhead, 
illuminating but dimly the interior of this queer 
place into which he and his men had scrambled, 
showed behind them, from the spot where the prow 
of the Tank stared in at them aimlessly, shattered 
walls, splintered timbers, fallen earth, and riven 
concrete pillars. About Roger himself there stood 
his crew, sweating with their exertions, a little 
wide-eyed, for the occasion was serious, waiting 
his directions. Then came the piled-up sand-bags, 
forming a protective wall, the breeches of machine- 
guns projecting from it, and ahead, with the rays 
of light gleaming upon them, the stairs leading up- 
wards, with their sharp turn to the left to the open, 
and their turn to the right which gave admission 
to the second dug-out along this line of German 
hiding-places. 
Yes, and on the stairs it showed the bodies of the 
fallen. The leading officer sprawled on his face on 
125 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  126 Under Haig in Flanders 
the floor of the dug-out, one leg still resting on the 
stairs, the officer who had followed him half-tumbled 
over his body, and in the niche or platform, where 
the stairs turned, a pile of helpless individuals. 
“Over you come!” shouted Roger; ‘‘ bring your 
guns and ammunition, and pull these fellows out of 
the way. Sharp’s the word! Bill, as soon as we 
have broken down the wall we erected yonder, you 
will carry on into the other dug-out, and will form 
a wall there. Look lively, lads, for in a little while 
that mine of theirs will be exploding.” 
“And what about setting a watch on them beg- 
gars there in the Tank?” demanded Jimmy, the 
eager Jimmy, just as Roger swung his legs over 
the sand-bagged wall. ‘‘ They ain’t got that mine 
ready yet awhile—they was only placing it when 
we looked just now. If I was to stay along there, 
squinting inside, and particularly if I was to use 
me rifle, I could stop ’em for a bit, and that ’ud 
give us time to move on and prepare other quarters.” 
Bill thumped him on the shoulder. ‘‘Good for 
you!” he shouted, boiling over with excitement; 
“‘good for you, Jimmy! You're the smallest chap 
we've got, but you’ve wits enough to give away to 
others of this party.” 
Roger laughed, for even then, in the stress of 
this affair, he could appreciate what Bill was saying. 
‘Carry on, then, Jimmy!” he cried. ‘Keep ’em 
off their explosives as long as you can. If you can, 
drive ’em out of the Tank altogether; though I 
doubt whether you'll succeed, for they can place 
their stuff in position by means of a pole or a rope.
-P-A-G-E-133
Fighting to a Finish 127 
Still, keep ’em out and give us as long time as you 
can. Now, Bill, over you go! Come along, men!” 
If the Hun could have descended into the dug- 
out just then to see what was happening, he would 
have been amazed at the extraordinary activity of 
the little band of British soldiers whom he had 
entrapped down there, whom he confidently antici- 
pated to destroy entirely. Not that it was an easy 
matter by any means. 
‘““We shall have to be careful how we go,” a 
goggled officer was saying to his subordinate as he 
stood within a trench quite close to the dug-outs, 
and into which that stairway led. ‘‘ We've tried 
a rush down below and it didn’t succeed. Those 
machine-guns of theirs would hold up any assault 
from that direction. Bah! It was a clever idea of 
theirs to dismount their machine-guns and take 
them from the Tank. Well then, what next? 
There’s the periscope. Confound it! We don’t 
happen to have any gas apparatus near at hand, 
though the idea of smothering them has occurred 
to me, and I have already sent off for it; but it will 
be two hours before we can get it up the communi- 
cating trench to this spot, and by then other 
troops will have come along-and will reap the 
reward for making the crew down below captives. 
So there’s the Tank left. Hurry in those explosives. 
Get your train laid, and blow the thing in ribbons! 
If that doesn’t kill every man down below it’ll stun 
them, and then we shall be in almost before the 
~ shock of the explosion has finished.” 
Jimmy, on hands and knees in the far end of the  
-P-A-G-E-134
ne eee 
18 Under Haig in Flanders 
dug-out, lay in wait, his rifle projecting through 
the rent in ‘‘ Mack’s” steel prow, his eye glued on 
. the dusky interior, and upon a gleam of light which 
came through the slit-like door, through which the 
enemy undoubtedly had gained admission. He 
saw, a little later, a pair of legs dangling in that 
narrow gap—a pair of booted legs belonging to an 
officer, no doubt, or perhaps to one of the non- 
commissioned ranks of the Kaiser’s army. 
“Just a reminder like!” he told himself as he 
lifted his rifle to his shoulder. ‘One through the 
calf will make him howl, and will make others more 
careful.” 
The interior of the Tank rattled, reverberated to 
his shot, while a second later a shrill scream was 
heard even by those down in the depths of the dug- 
out. The legs were withdrawn very hastily indeed, 
and then voices were heard. 
“‘Shouldn’t wonder,” said Jimmy, cheerfully 
enough, ‘‘shouldn’t wonder if that was to stop ’em 
for a while, unless of course there’s an officer that 
’ud like to chance things and come down. If he 
does——” ane 
He did. At that very moment there was a scuf- 
fling noise, and a figure dropped through the 
narrow doorway of the Tank and rushed towards 
him, while Jimmy’s keen eye caught a view of 
another man following immediately behind this 
first one. Yet he did not wince, but, lifting his 
rifle, again sent in a shot, which caused the Ger- 
man to crash against the still hot machinery of the 
Tank, and laid the second man low also.  
-P-A-G-E-135
Fighting to a Finish 129 
Meanwhile, Roger and his friends had been 
extraordinarily energetic. Running to the stair- 
way, he himself had mounted to the angle where 
the stairs turned sharply and had peered upward. 
Then, finding that no one was observing that part, 
he posted a man at the angle to look out for the 
enemy. 
“Lie down here amongst these dead Germans,” 
he told the man, ‘‘and keep your rifle directed up- 
wards and at your shoulder. If a head comes into 
view, open fire at once, for what we want to do is to 
keep ’em from observing our movements. Now, 
Bill,” he called, peeping down into the dug-out 
again, ‘‘just heave these bodies aside, and let’s 
‘break a way through the wall here by means of 
which we cut off the farther dug-out. That’s the 
way, boys; now there’s room for one of you to get 
through. Now, Bill, it’s your job to push on and 
to see that all is clear in the other dug-out.” 
Thrusting his way through the narrow aperture 
which had been torn out, Bill was shot, like a pip 
from.an orange, into the farther dug-out, and, 
getting to his feet again, looked round cautiously. 
A man joined him, and then a second, and together 
the three pushed on in the semi-darkness. They 
found the place untenanted, and at once Bill placed 
his two men at the far end, some little way back 
from the stairs, with orders to shoot down anyone 
who entered. By then Roger was through, and was 
joined at once by others of the crew of the Tank. 
“Now, boys,” he told them, ‘‘ get to work!— 
and as hard as you can, building a wall just like 
(0 902) 9

  that other one. There are still some sand-bags 
left in here, but there won’t be enough, so that 
we shall have to pass up the ones that we have 
already used. Line up, there! Some of you get 
back into the old dug-out, and sling the bags one 
to another.” 
At the best of times sand-bags are not the easiest 
or the lightest objects to handle and sling about. 
But men whose lives depend upon their efforts, 
who know that time is short in which to make 
defensive preparations, feel the weight of sand-bags 
hardly at all; and, though short of stature, the 
sturdy fellows whom Roger commanded made 
nothing of the task. 
Bags were passed from hand to hand along the 
living chain from the dug-out they were vacating 
to this new one which their commander had selected. 
Perhaps a quarter of an hour elapsed, and by that 
time the bulk of the bags had been transferred to 
their new position. It was just then that Jimmy’s 
rifle was again heard, speaking loudly, echoing 
through the dug-out, while that young fellow was 
seen a moment later to be retreating. 
“‘Come along in through this opening, boys!” 
Roger shouted at once. ‘‘ Now, let’s build up this 
wall here through which we have broken a way 
so as to get into the other dug-out. There we are! 
Machine-gun posted nicely in the very centre, while 
the other is bagged up in the other room. Wait, 
though! just leave a little niche there for a rifle, for 
a single shot will do all we want to keep the stair- 
way clear in case they attempt to descend by it.  
-P-A-G-E-137
Fighting to a Finish 131 
There we are, boys, in clover once more. Now, 
Jimmy, tell us what happened.” 
With a broad grin on his face the diminutive 
Jimmy narrated his own action. 
‘‘They was a-gettin’ quite angry, sir,” he said. 
‘First of all I pipped one of ’em through the calf, 
and you should have heard him howl. Then two 
of the officers thought they’d show their men the 
way, and do me in in quick time. But they didn’t. 
Oh no!” and Jimmy grinned the wider. ‘‘Oh 
dear no, sir!” he said, displaying a row of ex- 
tremely uneven teeth, with a gap in the very centre 
of the upper row which gave him quite a quaint 
appearance. 
“They didn’t,” nodded Roger. ‘‘ Well?” 
“°’Cos they didn’t!” went on Jimmy. ‘Just 
one shot got ’em both; and if there’s a ‘bust’ 
yonder, I reckon they’ll be in it. There was a 
heap of jawin’ after that, sir. I could hear ’em 
up above, in their trench I should say, ’cos most 
of these dug-outs communicate with the trenches. 
Then a chap dropped a bomb into the tank, and 
I thought he’d busted me altogether. So did he!” 
grinned the incorrigible little fellow; ‘‘so did he, 
sirl? 
“But he didn’t, eh?” laughed Roger, amused 
with this man of his. 
“You can take it that he didn’t, sir, ’cos I’m 
here. But they came down in a swarm, and, though 
I fired hard, there was no keepin’’em back. They 
started to fire through the rent in ‘ Mack’s’ prow, 
and I knew it was time to get going.”
-P-A-G-E-138
nn ee eee eee 
132 Under Haig in Flanders 
‘«Then we can expect an explosion at almost any 
moment,” Roger told his followers. ‘‘One second; 
I see those crafty fellows have placed a periscope 
in every one of their dug-outs. Bill, you’ll stand 
near it, or rather lie near it, because I want every 
one of you to stretch yourselves flat on the ground. 
Not that the explosion ought to damage us in here; 
though you never know, do you? Still these con- 
creted dug-outs are very strongly built, and, seeing 
that the Tank has fallen into one of them, and has, 
as it were, opened up the place, the force of the 
explosion is more likely to go upward than to 
travel. Lie down every one of you. You can 
smoke, if you like, for I’ve no objection.” 
Ten long minutes passed, during which the crew 
of the Tank lay about the German dug-out waiting 
for the explosion which they knew must come, and 
fretting because there was no sign as yet of its 
arrival. Then, just as they began to believe that, 
after all, it would not occur, suddenly there was 
a deep rumble, and then a roar, while Bill at the 
periscope saw objects falling. The ground rocked, 
one or two of the beams in the dug-out started from 
their places, while a concrete post which supported 
the roof cracked in twain, and the upper half fell 
to the floor of the dug-out. Then silence followed 
for just a few seconds, though after that there was 
a murmur of voices and then much shouting. 
““You can see ’em from here peering into the 
hole that ‘Mack’ made,” reported Bill, ‘‘ and, 
lor’! listen to that noise!’ Oh, ain’t they angry?”
-P-A-G-E-139
CHAPTER X 
An Unpleasant Meeting 
A SEETHING mass of Germans ran shouting about 
the trench, which cut its sinuous way in front of 
that long line of dug-outs buried forty feet beneath 
the soil of Flanders. At every stairway leading 
downwards men stood well back, peering into the 
depths and shouting. Where the ponderous and 
wrecked form of the unfortunate ‘‘Mack”—that steel 
leviathan which Roger and his crew had driven so 
gallantly up to the fighting-line—lay embedded, 
trapped, as it were, in a dug-out, there was pan- 
demonium. In the smoke following that gigantic 
explosion men laboured with crowbars and pick- 
axes, while some in their frenzy made efforts to 
tear away the riven plates of ‘‘ Mack” and make 
a passage into the dug-out where Roger and his 
men had been secreted. 
“They'll be a-breaking through, sir,” said Bill, 
posted at the periscope, from which he was able 
to get quite a good view of his surroundings. 
‘Lor’! ain’t our chaps chuckin’ in stuff! Should 
say our observers have caught sight of the enemy 
a-bustlin’ round after us, or perhaps the explosion 
attracted their attention.”

“More likely that,” asserted Roger, pushing his 
old friend aside and himself taking post at the 
periscope. ‘Yes, I think that must be it, for high 
explosives from the British lines are pouring on to 
this line of trenches and earthworks. Wait! A 
barrage is creeping towards us, and that looks as 
though our troops were coming on. That’s good 
news, you men. If our chaps come along now, we 
shall best the fellows.” 
The diminutive Jimmy smacked one of his dirty 
thighs with a hand which was stained with earth, 
while across the sun-browned fingers a streak of 
dried blood meandered—for he had torn his flesh 
against the riven steel coat of ‘‘Mack”—his eyes 
opened wide, that same merry, reassuring grin 
splitting his features asunder. 
“‘Our chaps a-comin’ on, sir,” he laughed; ‘‘and 
you think as we'll best these fellows? Hurrah!” 
“Hurrah!” they all chimed in, sending a British 
cheer which reverberated along the dug-out, caused 
dust and debris to fall from the concreted and 
planked roof, and set the electric bulb, dangling 
overhead, swaying. That cheer, too, went up the 
stairway and among the Germans still farther on. 
“We've got to get in at once and take ’em—no, 
kill em,” shouted an officer who was superintend- 
ing the operations. That barrage means that the 
British are coming forward, and unless we are 
reinforced we shall never be able to hold this 
position. The trench is getting smashed to pieces. 
See here, Unter-leutnant Ersberger, take a party 
of men and lead them down the stairway that we

descended before when we attacked them; I’ll lead 
a party through here, where the Tank has fallen, 
for we’ve now broken a hole through, which will 
give us access to the dug-out. When I whistle, 
rush down.” 
Men assembled in the trench outside that stair- 
way down which forlorn men had made the similar 
attempt a little earlier, to whom Roger and his 
men had put a summary end. Others, under the 
direct supervision of the officer commanding, 
swarmed into the broken and bulging Tank till 
they filled it, and then, when the commanding 
officer’s whistle sounded shrilly, they burst into 
the dug-out just vacated by Roger—a dug-out, it 
should be added, the interior of which was now 
buried in darkness, for the thoughtful Jimmy, 
_ coming away from his post at the prow of ‘‘Mack”, 
had smashed the bulb with his bayonet. 
There were shouts and the loud report of rifles. 
Two bodies of men, the one coming down the 
stairway, the other through the shattered interior 
of ‘‘Mack”, met in the darkness of the dug-out, 
and there commenced a desperate and fierce en- 
counter. Not, indeed, till a number of the Germans 
had been killed, did the discovery dawn upon the 
commander that Germans were fighting hand to 
hand with Germans; and only by dint of shouting, 
pulling the men aside, and blowing his whistle, 
did he contrive to put an end to this disastrous 
mélée. A new bulb was then fixed to the electric- 
light pendant, and the Germans were able to logk 
about and discern one another.
-P-A-G-E-142
  136 Under Haig in Flanders 
‘Where, then,” stuttered the commander, breath- 
less with his exertions, fuming with rage, and ready 
to vent his wrath on anyone—‘‘ where, then, have 
those rascals got to? Where is Unter-leutnant 
Ersberger?” 
“There!” replied one of the soldiers, surlily, 
pointing a dirty finger at a form lying on the 
floor of the dug-out. ‘‘He fell, sir, to your bullet.” 
“Bah!” the German officer growled his anger, 
and, starting forward, turned his unfortunate com- 
rade over. ‘‘ Bah!” he growled again, ‘to think 
of his stupidity! Could he not have known, when 
he got to the centre of the dug-out, that those British 
swine were gone, and that the men he was attack- 
ing were his own comrades? He deserves what he 
has got, and so do these other idiots. Now let us 
see what else there is to be done. Where have 
these fellows got to?” 
Where, indeed? It took only a little investiga- 
tion on the part of this officer to discover that sand- 
bagged wall stretching across the opening which 
led from the little landing a few steps up the stair- 
way, and which gave access to the next dug-out. 
He shouted his anger when he noticed the muzzle 
of a machine-gun protruding from it, and backed 
away hurriedly. Then he and his men rushed up 
through the shattered remnants of the Tank, gained 
the trench outside, and, narrowly escaping annihila- 
tion by shells sent from some far-off British battery, 
raced round to the next stairway. , 
“Ah!” he shouted. ‘‘No, there is no sign of 
them here, and no sand-bagged wall. Then per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  An Unpleasant Meeting 137 
haps they have gone along the line of dug-outs— 
artful dogs that they are! Well, we will chase 
them. Hurry up, you men, for we still have time. 
Not until the British bombardment ends will their 
infantry advance; so let us make the most of the 
moment. Here, you, Sergeant, take a party along 
to the next stairway. I’ll go down here and search 
the dug-out on my right and on my left. Pass the 
word on to other parties, and tell them to be quick 
about it.” 
The clatter of footsteps, on the steep stairway at 
the far end of the dug-out in which Roger and his 
men had now taken shelter, soon attracted their 
attention, and, at a sharp order from our hero, the 
electric lamp swinging directly overhead was ‘ex- 
tracted, leaving one other bulb at the far end, 
where the stairway entered the dug-out. 
“That'll light ’em up beautifully,” Roger told 
his men, ‘‘ while we are in darkness. Bill, you’ll 
command this wall. Jimmy, here, will be at the 
smaller one which blocks the stairway behind us, 
though I hardly think the enemy will come from 
that direction, for we’ve already taught him that 
that’s a nasty position. So we’ve got to look for 
them from the front, and if we can stop ’em as 
easily as we did before, well, we shan’t have cause 
to grumble. Ah! there’s the first of them.” 
A man appeared at the corner of the stairway, 
and stood for a while on the little landing there, 
peering down into the dug-out. 
““Come down,” he shouted to the men behind 
him, for it was the commanding officer. ‘‘I think 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  138 Under Haig in Flanders 
they’ve gone right on, though there’s just a chance 
that they might be here. Some of you go straight 
ahead into this dug-out on my left, the others follow 
me to the right, so as to make quite certain!” 
More clattering of heavy boots, more deep 
breathing, and the rattle of accoutrements and 
arms. Then a mob of men crowded the landing, 
. and some pushed on down the steps directly ahead, 
and so into the dug-out to which Roger and his 
friends had not yet penetrated. The remainder, 
perhaps thirty in number, followed the officer into 
that brightly illuminated patch at the far end of the 
underground space in which our friends had taken 
shelter. 
“Give ’em one,” whispered Bill, who had a 
bomber beside him, .‘‘just one in the very middle. 
You other boys keep your heads down under the 
wall. Roger,” he shouted, forgetting their respec- 
tive positions in this moment of excitement, ‘‘down 
with your head, we’re a-goin’ to x 
The explosion of a bomb amongst the Germans 
ended the sentence abruptly, and ended also the 
search of the German commanding officer and the 
band of men who had accompanied him. Only 
groans and shrieks followed, while through the 
smoke could be seen the rapid retreat of the soldiers 
of the Kaiser, their figures covered an instant later 
by the cloud of dust which filled the dug-out and 
almost stifled those within it. : 
‘“‘What was that?”—a splutter as of fireworks 
outside, the sharp, crackling noise penetrating to 
Roger and his men. The former dashed to the  
-P-A-G-E-145
  
An Unpleasant Meeting 139 
periscope and peered through it, to discover, it 
seemed just over his head, a long continuous line 
running parallel with the trench outside, a line 
of white breaking cloud, here swelling into a broad 
sheet, in the centre of which a sudden flash pene- 
trated, there thinning down till the blue sky right 
up above became visible. Then again, a splotch 
of white, a flash of flame, a crackling roar, and 
underneath a spreading wave of bullets—shrapnel 
bullets, which peppered the ground as if a gigantic 
watering-pot were held aloft, which drove holes 
into the soil and sent spurts of dust and earth 
upward. 
‘The barrage,” he shouted, ‘‘ right on the enemy 
trenches! Make ready, you men, for our fellows 
will be along here in a jiffy!” 
Make ready, indeed! From Bill down to the 
very youngest soldier amongst the crew of the 
Tank each man’s face was glowing, each young 
fellow held his rifle firmly gripped, his eyes fixed 
upon the commanding officer, excepting only those 
in charge of the machine-guns. They sat as 
rigid as statues, the one with his eyes fixed upon 
the stairway which gave access to the dug-outs 
from the trench above, and the other watching 
over the entrance to the stairway at the far end, 
where the single electric bulb illuminated the place, 
and poured its bright rays down upon the floor of 
this underground cavern and upon the figures 
tumbled there haphazard. 
When Roger swung his periscope round and 
surveyed the ground to either side—the ground
-P-A-G-E-146
  140 Under Haig in Flanders 
beneath which that long line of dug-outs existed— 
he found those same splotches of dust where the 
shrapnel bullets were falling, but nowhere along 
the line was there a sign of the incoming of high- 
explosive shells, nowhere could he detect those 
huge upheavals of earth, those shattering detona- 
tions, those violent explosions which followed the 
fall of British shells of large diameter. But beyond, 
where No Man’s Land continued—for now it did 
not belong any more to the Germans—behind the 
sinuous trench which gave access to the line of 
dug-outs, where machine-gun posts no doubt were 
hidden, where still more dug-outs existed, and 
where, for all he knew, thousands of the enemy 
were in hiding, there could be seen at close range 
a sight which would have petrified a novice. For 
the ground there was positively being tossed about 
as if by an earthquake. Huge mounds appeared at 
one spot, only to fall in and become vast cavities 
the next moment; a flat patch of ground, brown 
, and bare, as he looked, suddenly was wiped out of 
existence by a falling shell, and the detonation and 
the flash were followed by a mighty and awe- 
inspiring upheaval. So it was to right and to left; 
so it continued on towards the enemy support 
trenches. British guns three and four and more 
miles away were registering on this long stretch 
of debated country. British shells, made by British 
women in factories which had come into life since 
this Armageddon began, were penetrating the 
ground in every direction, were seeking and 
searching inquisitively for dug-outs and cunning
-P-A-G-E-147
  An Unpleasant Meeting 141 
machine-gun positions, were feeling now for the 
hidden enemy, and were blowing, sky-high, earth 
and concreted dug-outs, timbered posts, and the 
whole defensive works so laboriously prepared by 
the Kaiser and his ambitious people. 
Turning the periscope in the other direction, 
towards the ground but lately traversed by that ex- 
traordinary barrage—by that line of bursting shells 
the range of which lifted continuously, that line 
which advanced as if it had human intelligence, 
which crept on and on, and had now reached this 
German line of trenches—Roger saw that it was 
covered with khaki dots, with men in tin helmets 
plodding onward, with bombers laden with grenades 
packed in the bags slung round their necks, with 
men toiling under the weight of Lewis guns and 
machine-guns of the heavier pattern, with sappers, 
with artillery observers, with runners, and with that 
famous line—that infantry line—which in other fields 
and in other days has moved forward to victory. 
It was the British attacking force, bent on reach- 
ing the line where Roger and his men had come 
to grief, and on ousting the German. 
No wonder then that Roger shouted! No wonder 
indeed that Bill led an answering cheer, and that 
.the shouts of these intefned soldiers reached the 
ears of the oncoming line of British soldiers! 
‘©Pull down the wall! Shoulder your machine- 
guns! Now, boys, when I give the word, let’s get 
up and join our fellows.” 
The barrage crept on like a living thing, plaster- 
ing the ground immediately over the dug-out, filling 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  1442 Under Haig in Flanders 
the air with a stifling smoke and with a constant 
crackle of exploding missiles. It stole forward, 
foot by foot, its deadly deluge searching every hole 
and corner. And walking behind it steadily, not 
charging, be it understood—for these men must 
traverse a considerable distance, and not one of 
them but was heavily laden—came that khaki line 
of heroes, wending their way round the shell-holes, 
each officer with his own particular objective, the 
whole movement all along the line co-ordinating, 
the attack carried out as if the men were on peace 
manoeuvres. 
Yet, peace indeed! 
The splutter of machine-guns from some hidden 
post on the right laid men low almost in front of 
the periscope through which Roger was peering; 
it halted the line, and men to right and left took 
cover. 
“Held up by a machine-gun! They’ll have to 
clear it out before they can go forward,” Roger 
told his men. ‘Wish our Tank was in running 
order, for we’d romp up to the place and blow it to 
dust. Still, boys, it hasn’t been a bad adventure, 
has it?” 
The grinning faces of the men gave him his 
answer better than words could have done; yet 
that they were eager for more adventure was self- 
evident. 
‘‘Chaps that ’as got used to the roaring, rattling 
inside of a Tank don’t want to be cooped up 
all day in this ’ere sort of a dug-out,” growled 
Bill. ‘‘I don’t want to ask for no change, sir.
-P-A-G-E-149
  An Unpleasant Meeting 143 
While there’s Tanks on this front, and they are still 
able to do a job, why, Tanks is what'll always at- 
tract me. But if there ain’t, when it so happens 
that our old gal gets knocked out of time, why, 
give me the open! Let me get up into the air! 
Don’t stifle me down in a rat-hole, like this, as if I 
was a German.” 
“Nor me!” came in an almost plaintive voice 
from the ever-smiling Jimmy; ‘‘nor me, sir!” 
“Nor me!” came practically from every one of 
the party. 
“Then be a little patient,” Roger told them. 
“‘That machine-gun is still holding up our fellows. 
Ah, the barrage has swept beyond it! Listen to 
the crackle and rattle of the thing! What’s that? 
I see some of our men—our bombers, I expect— 
are creeping forward. Tack! tack! tack! There 
it goes again! and, yes, they don’t seem to have 
spotted our fellows.” 
Other figures were now to be seen: the figures 
of Germans leaving the trench which gave access 
to the row of dug-outs in one of which Roger and 
his friends were hiding. They were creeping along 
the communicating trench which led eastwards 
towards the rear, slinking away, stopping now and 
again to fire their rifles at some khaki figure, yet 
moving along rapidly for all that, seeking cover in 
the distance. 
There were others also, hundreds of others, whom 
he could not see, but who cowered in that long line 
of dug-outs: men fearful to move out, men perhaps 
many of them anxious to be captured—troops of  
-P-A-G-E-150
    144 Under Haig in Flanders 
the Kaiser who had lost their superior officers, and 
who, finding themselves with no one in command, 
lay, inert, lacking decision and initiative, or de- 
sirous now, after many months of severe fighting, 
to give up the task which Germany had set them, 
and lay down their arms rather than continue the 
contest. ; 
“«Stop a bit!” shouted Roger; ‘‘a Tank!” 
“A Tank!” echoed Bill. ‘‘A-goin’ for that 
machine-gun?” 
“Yes,” Roger reassured him, ‘‘ moving towards 
it, though it looks as if the officer in command had 
not yet spotted the exact position. But he has, he 
has!” he shouted a moment later, for flames swept 
from the sides of the Tank which had just come 
into view, rumbling and rolling across the open. 
Then a spout of earth rose from the spot where 
Roger himself had perceived the snout of a 
machine-gun. There was a violent detonation 
there; flames took the place of the cloud of earth, 
and then smoke alone, and silence hung over 
that particular position. No longer was there the 
“‘Rat-a-tat-tat” of the machine-gun, for it and 
the men who had manned it had been put out of 
action. 
“Pitch that wall aside! Pull your guns out, 
boys! Make ready!” shouted Roger. ‘‘ Hurrah! 
Our men are now coming on fast, and will soon 
be into the trench and into the dug-outs. Bill, 
station yourself just along there at the stairway, and 
put your helmet on the top of your bayonet; warn 
our fellows that they’ve got friends down here, or
-P-A-G-E-151
  An Unpleasant Meeting — 45 
otherwise we shall have bombs smashing in on us. 
Hurry up, there, for our fellows are already drop- 
ping into the German trench which opens into this 
dug-out.” 
The voices of men outside could now ‘be heard, 
the shouts of our soldiers, and presently a loud 
challenge. 
‘‘Hil—you down there!” someone bellowed in 
broad Yorkshire accent, ‘‘ will ye come oot of it, 
thin, noo, dead or alive?—or will ye stay thir and 
be smothered? Ye sons of guns, come oot!” 
Bill made suitable answer. 
“Sons of guns yerself, sonny,” he shouted. 
“‘D’you think it’s always a Fritz that you'll find 
in these ’ere places? Just put a couple of men up 
there to tell the boys that you’ve got down ’ere the 
crew of the Tank that went in front of you, and if 
there’s an officer there, tell him to come down so 
that our officer can report to him.” 
The clatter of feet could be heard on the stairs 
some few seconds later; a familiar khaki figure 
turned the corner and then descended the remain- 
ing steps into the dug-out. By then Roger had 
leapt over the wall, and the two gripped hands, 
while the men set up a cheer which set the dug-out 
echoing. It was answered by the shouts and cheers 
of men who had followed the officer into this sub- 
terraneous cavern. 
“Well, and what’s it all about?” asked the officer, 
peering round, and at once noticing the sand-bag 
wall. ‘Looks as though you’ve been putting up 
quite a little show of your own here. But what’s 
(0.902) 10
-P-A-G-E-152
  146 Under Haig in Flanders 
this? Your Tank seemed to do a nose-dive farther 
along the line, a hundred yards along perhaps; how 
is it we find you here, then?” 
“Oh!—how? Well, come along and look for 
yourself,” said Roger, taking him by the sleeve; 
and the two clambered over the wall and made 
their way along the dug-out. ‘‘It’s been quite a 
pretty little affair, I can tell you. Here we are! 
We climb up these stairs, pass through this sand- 
bag wall, which my men have already made a gap 
in, down the farther flight, and——” 
““More Germans! You had a mix up with them 
here too, then. I begin to see it all,” said the 
officer. ‘And that’s the Tank—eh? Poor thing, 
she’ll never move from that position. Yes, a very 
pretty little affair! Let’s see. You are Lieutenant 
“Sullivan,” said Roger promptly. 
“‘Ah!—Sullivan,” repeated the officer, taking a 
notebook from his pocket, ‘‘ Sullivan—Lieutenant 
Sullivan. Oh! Sullivan—Tanks—I think? on 
gratulations!” 
He snapped the cover of the notebook to, replaced 
a rubber band about it, shook hands again with 
Roger, and departed promptly. Ten minutes later 
he was with a superior officer, and, notebook in 
hand, was narrating the facts which he had ob- 
served in the dug-out. 
“A splendid affair, sir!” he said. ‘‘ That officer, 
Lieutenant Sullivan, has put up a show that is 
worth noting. I—er—think that it might be just 
as well, if you can spare the time, to go down and 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  An Unpleasant Meeting 147 
inspect. A very fine little show, sir. You'd enjoy 
it!” 
And enjoy it that officer did. When he had 
descended, indeed, he was so interested in it that 
he insisted upon our hero taking him over the 
ground of his recent conflict, and explaining the 
whole affair from the moment when the Tank had 
crushed its way into one of the dug-outs. Then he 
left, while Roger and his men clambered to the 
trench above, and, joining the advancing troops, 
went on with them, 
“This way, this way, sir!” said a man in khaki, 
approaching them a little later—a man who, it 
should be explained, had suddenly caught sight 
of our hero, had peered at him in a half-frightened 
manner at first, and had then glared in his direc- 
tion. 
‘The very man,” he had muttered beneath his 
breath. ‘‘That young rascal who landed me one 
back in England! So he’s out here! Good for 
me! Now’s the time to pay off the score that I 
owe him.” 
“This way, sir!” he said. ‘Turn left now into 
this trench; the boys have gone on beyond.” 
No wonder that Roger and his crew were con- 
fused by all that they saw and found about them. 
Men were moving to and fro, German prisoners 
were passing back continuously, rifles were flashing 
in all directions, and often enough there came to 
their ears the rattle and grind of machine-guns. 
All the while, too, continuously and without a stop, 
there poured upon the ground shrapnel bullets 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
    1448 Under Haig in Flanders 
from that barrage still lining the sky and advanc- 
ing. Indeed, but for the barrage, it was almost 
impossible to say which was the enemy’s position, 
and where lay the lines of the British. 
“This way, sir! This way, sir!” called the man 
in khaki who had suddenly accosted Roger. ‘‘Now 
along here; turn to your left, down this stretch, 
now into this dug-out.” 
Hurrying along the dug-out they passed into 
another, and from that still again into others. 
Then they emerged into a trench once more, to 
find that that barrage was now behind them. 
“Stop!” cried Roger. ‘‘ Where are we? Where 
are our men? We’ve moved beyond our barrage 
and must surely be in front of our attack, and 
almost in the support lines of the enemy. Where 
are our other men, Bill? What's become of them?” 
Bill had clung closely to his old friend through- 
out, and in the hurry of their recent movements he 
had not noticed that the crew who had so gallantly 
supported Roger had been thrown off by their 
many turns and twistings. He and Roger were 
alone now with this man. Yet not alone. For of 
a sudden some fifty Germans pounced upon them, 
threw them down, and disarmed them; and when 
at length the two had recovered their breath and 
stood upright in the trench, prisoners amongst the 
Germans, there was that khaki figure still near at 
hand, a man who grinned sardonically. 
“Know me?” he asked in perfect English, 
though there was just a suspicion of a guttural 
accent about it. ‘You don’t know me, do you? 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  An Unpleasant Meeting 149 
—eh, Mr. Norman? Look again, now! You 
wouldn’t, would you? Well, just think, I’m the 
bloke you knocked out at Hurslet that day when 
me and Chawles, and a young gent what wants 
horse-whipping, made plans to give you a drubbing. 
I’m the one you left lying in the road in front of 
the pub! I’m the chap what got a month’s hard 
labour! Look at me—I ain’t forgotten old scores, 
don’t you worry! For your number’s up! Know 
what that means?” 
Roger knew well enough: the man’s face was 
sufficient to tell him. Yet he was almost too 
astonished at what he had heard, to be able yet to 
consider his position. It seemed hardly possible 
that the wretch who had lured himself and Bill into 
the enemy’s lines could be the rascal who had 
attacked him in Hurslet. He had not caught so 
much as a glimpse of his face on that dark night, 
but now recognized him as a rough who had 
haunted that town adjacent to his home where he 
had so often gone shopping. Yes, this undoubtedly 
was the man. Roger shivered when he thought 
of the future.
-P-A-G-E-156
  CHAPTER XI 
Armageddon 
Was there ever such an amazing coincidence? 
Was there ever such an extraordinary and fateful 
meeting as that which had occurred so near the 
banks of the River Somme, now to be ever famous 
in British history? Who, indeed, particularly 
amongst the humble and peaceful inhabitants of the 
village of Hurslet, where Roger’s father lived and 
where also lived Mr. Riven, would have credited 
the tale that a rough, discovered unconscious one 
dark night in front of the hospitable portals of the 
“Morning Sun”, and attended by the genial Ser- 
geant Higgins, should meet out in France, in the 
midst of the titanic conflict being waged there, the 
youth whom he had attacked in such rascally fashion 
and who had been the cause of his undoing? Yet, 
there it was! The Somme offensive, in which 
British and French troops were now fully occupied, 
had seen already magnificent fighting, a huge 
success and some failures. It had provided thou- 
sands upon thousands of episodes and incidents, 
yet we trow not one, perhaps, more curious than 
this one. 
Let us hark back for a while to England, to the 
160
-P-A-G-E-157
  Armageddon 151 
neighbourhood of Hurslet, so as to dip a little 
deeper into this affair, while we leave Roger and 
Bill prisoners in the hands of the Germans, with 
armed guards standing about them, and that grin- 
ning rascal, in khaki like themselves—a spy, plan- 
ning their further downfall. 
“Yes, it’s a queer mix up, and there are folks 
hereabouts who are rubbing their eyes and won- 
dering,” said Sergeant Higgins one evening as his 
visitors sat about the parlour fire at the ‘‘ Morning 
Sun” and discussed their evening ale; their number, 
be it noted, thinning somewhat, for the young and 
more active members of the customary party were 
conspicuous by their absence. ‘‘This country of 
ours has seen some change, I know, and has passed 
through times, in the long, almost-forgotten past, 
when stranger things happened. There have been 
days when every man in the country was called 
upon to protect his hearth and home, when flares 
lit up the hills from Land’s End to John o’ Groats, 
and men streamed out from their huts and hovels, 
from their castles and their palaces, to stem the 
tide of the invader.” 
“Aye, aye, the invader, Sergeant Higgins,” 
quoth a bearded countryman, known in the locality 
for his debating powers, ‘‘but this ain’t no invasion 
—not, at least, of England.” 
“Quite so! Agreed! An invasion first of all of 
Belgium and of Serbia, and then of France; all 
the same it’s a German invasion, and, whether the 
Huns have broken their way into other people’s 
country or whether they have reached this land,  
-P-A-G-E-158
  
  152 Under Haig in Flanders 
the danger is all the same, though not quite so 
apparent. Everyone admits now,” went on Ser- 
geant Higgins, thumping the table with his brawny 
fist, ‘everyone agrees that the Germans are out to 
capture the world, to beat everyone, to grind every 
nation under their heel, and particularly Great 
Britain. So the call has come again, and has 
brought hundreds of thousands of young fellows 
to the army and to the navy who put patriotism 
before everything else. But the war’s gone on. 
More men were wanted. We are fighting not only 
in France but in Egypt—on its Western and Eastern 
Fronts, in Mesopotamia, in Salonika, and Heaven 
knows how many other places! More men were 
wanted.” 
“And we had to have them; yes, we had to have 
them,” chimed in the ancient countryman who had 
spoken earlier. ‘It had got to a point where it 
wasn’t fair that one man should stay behind and 
enjoy peace and comfort, while his neighbour, be- 
cause he was a red-hot patriot, broke up his home, 
forsook wife and child, and went into the army.” 
“Ha! ha!” chortled another individual, pulling 
a blackened clay from between his teeth; ‘‘there’s 
them in these ’ere parts what knows all about that 
--eh? This ’ere conscription what’s supposed to 
make things fair for everyone, what treats Bill like 
Tom, and Charles like Harry, it’s caught by the tail 
more than one as we could speak of.” 
The rubicund ploughman laughed aloud again, 
and jerked a dirty sun-browned finger over his 
shoulder in the direction of the hill which led up
-P-A-G-E-159
  Armageddon I 153 
out of Hurslet, and, looking round upon his audi- 
ence, nodded his head significantly. 
“Aye, aye,” they agreed, ‘‘there’s many on’em.” 
“And there’s no need to wrap up their names 
either,” said the Sergeant. ‘‘There was that young 
fellow, Roger Norman, who showed the way to the 
village; he was pretty nigh the first of all the 
young fellows to go, and he under eighteen years 
of age at the time. There was that Mr. Riven, 
slinking about the Hall up there, cutting a dash 
in the village, doing the swell in the town near 
by, and letting others go out aad fight his battles. 
Well, conscription’s caught him too. They tell me 
he’s been to a training-camp as a cadet, and that 
now he’s an officer somewhere in France. There’s 
many a man, too, gone with him. D’you remember 
the case where young Roger was set upon out here 
in front of this public-house?” 
The debating society around him—for the habi- 
tués of the ‘‘ Morning Sun” had long since become 
a debating society, discussing threadbare every 
evening the affairs of the world in general and 
of Hurslet in particular—the folks collected there, 
nodded their heads, some most emphatically, while 
more than one chuckled. 
“Aye, aye, it’s taken the good and the bad, the 
slow and the fast, the chaps that wanted to go but 
couldn’t well break their ties at home, and the 
chaps—there wasn’t many on ’em, I’ll wager,” de- 
clared one of those present magnanimously—‘ the 
chaps that didn’t want to go. That Mr. Riven, 
well, it hooked him by the leg. And all the better! 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  154 Under Haig in Flanders 
I mind the time when Roger Norman was assaulted, 
and the chaps that were brought out by the police; 
that Charles—he didn’t seem to have a surname— 
he was hooked by the recruiting sergeant, and he’s 
been off somewhere or other this many a day.” 
‘‘ But—but there was another fellow, the one who 
was picked up in front of the public-house here. 
He’s the one I mainly referred to,” said the Ser- 
geant. ‘‘What was his name?” 
‘Aye, what was his name?” chirped one of the 
visitors present. ‘‘Furrin-sounding, wasn’t it?— 
and to be sure he was an alien. His father used 
to be a baker up in the town yonder, and an elder 
brother—a good sort he was—took on the business. 
Germans all!” 
‘““Ah! Germans!” the audience echoed. 
“German!” exclaimed the old countryman who 
had formerly spoken. ‘‘ Well, I reckon there’s been 
good Germans and bad Germans; though most of 
’em, as it’s turned out, was bad. Folks do say that 
they’ve come here to England, and, what with their 
cleverness and their cunning, have got behind our 
people, have pushed them out of many a good job, 
and have stolen their businesses. I ain’t a-sayin’ 
that this baker man stole anyone’s business, but 
he came here and set up for himself, no doubt 
because he could do better than in his own country; 
and seeing that he set up here, he must have taken 
the bread out of the mouth of some other baker, 
who, you might say, would be English. What’s 
the name?” 
‘Fritz Hillstein,” one of the audience prompted.
-P-A-G-E-161
  Armageddon 155 
“‘T remember now; it was painted up over the shop 
as large as life afore the war begun; then when 
people began to say nasty things about Germans— 
and serve ’em right I says, ’cos it’s true—the name 
got painted out, and Smith or something took its 
place. Hillstein’s the name. The chap that young 
Roger Norman floored out here was Ernest, or 
something of that sort. Floored him, Sergeant. 
Eh? That comes of young Roger’s boxing 
lessons.” 
The gallant sergeant smiled his appreciation, 
squared his shoulders, and threw his head back 
a trifle. After all, though he was getting, as he 
often expressed it, a ‘‘back number”, it was 
pleasant to remember that he had been a fine 
athlete, a good gymnast, a first-class boxing 
instructor. 
“Aye, aye,” he sang out cheerfully, ‘‘ young 
Roger Norman was a fine and promising pupil. 
As he grew bigger and stronger, the time came 
along when I had as much as I could do some 
days to look after myself and keep him off. In 
broad daylight there were few of his age who 
could stand up to him; but in the darkness any- 
thing might have happened. But I reckon he 
caught this Ernst Hillstein a crack that made him 
feel silly. It wasn’t the stone against which his 
head came that knocked that German out entirely; 
it was the crack he caught full in the mouth, 
straight from the shoulder, one of the punches I 
taught young Roger. But what about this German 
fellow?”  
-P-A-G-E-162

136 Under Haig in Flanders 
“The police sergeant’s the one who knows,” 
a man who was present told them. ‘‘He was 
yarning to me only the other day about it. Seems 
that the father of these Hillsteins was a naturalized 
Englishman; so the son what runs the baking 
business is still up in the town yonder taking 
money from the English people. T’other son, the 
one that got knocked out, was a conscript, and 
that’s all I know about it.” 
What a commotion, what a nine days’ wonder, 
would have been created in the sleepy village of 
Hurslet if only those happy genial folk seated 
about the parlour fire in the ‘‘Morning Sun”, 
yarning with Sergeant Higgins, could have known 
that Ernst Hillstein, the rascal whom Roger had 
punished, had not only been conscripted, but had 
contrived in some way to join the ranks of the 
enemy. We will pull aside the curtain to enable 
the reader to realize better what had happened. 
Some cunning enemy agency in this country had 
kept in touch with Ernst Hillstein, as perhaps it 
had done with others of similar descent and of 
equally doubtful loyalty. In some way, this rascal, 
whilst wearing the honoured uniform of a British 
soldier, was yet heart and soul with the Kaiser’s 
‘people. Bearing in mind his former history—the 
fact that he was known to the police as a vagabond 
and a rascal—it is more than probable that he was 
not actuated in this treachery by feelings of patri- 
otism for the German Empire. More than prob- 
able was it that the hope, of reward, the strong 
desire to grow rich at the expense of generous  
-P-A-G-E-163
  Armageddon 157 
people who had often befriended him, influenced 
his actions. Be the inducement what it might, 
Ernst Hillstein had become a spy for the Germans, 
had gone to France still as a spy, and there, still in 
touch perhaps with some cunning agency, had, 
while remaining a soldier in the British lines, con- 
trived to pass information to the enemy. Who 
knows? That information might have been of little 
enough importance; yet at any moment this rascal 
might have tumbled upon some valuable item of 
information, which would have macle his employ- 
ment by the Germans an excellent bargain for them. 
Who knows, too, whether his actions had led to 
suspicion? In any case he himself began to fear 
that he would be apprehended, and hence, taking 
advantage of an advance on the part of the British 
in the neighbourhood of the Somme, he had joined 
.the German army, taking with him Roger Norman 
and Bill Andrews. 
It may be as well, before returning to our hero, 
that we should say a word or two with regard to 
this gigantic British offensive, which began in the 
neighbourhood of the River Somme on rst July, 
1916. 
There is no need to describe events which had 
occurred before this date, for everyone must be 
aware of the incidents of the 1914 campaign, and 
of the desperate fighting which had taken place in 
1915. Suffice it to say that, having stemmed the 
German tide of invasion in 1914, having held it up 
still more firmly, though desperate efforts were 
made by the enemy in the earlier part of 1915, the
-P-A-G-E-164
  138 Under Haig in Flanders 
British and the French gathered their strength 
together, and in September of 1915 launched a 
gigantic attack on the enemy, which, dwarfed by 
the fighting near the River Somme in 1916, was 
yet violent enough to be some indication of what 
was to follow. 
The British in the neighbourhood of Loos, from 
Bethune down to the Ridge of Vimy, drove a wedge 
into the ranks of the Kaiser’s army, and broke their 
way through concreted and iron-bound defences 
which had been laboriously prepared by the enemy. 
That offensive came to a stop as regards the British 
in front of the Hohenzollern Redoubt before Hul- 
luch, and at the environs of Lens, the mining city 
of northern France. It captured the village of 
Loos and the coal-pits outside; and though it gave 
the British no great advantage in position, indeed 
none at all, it whetted the appetite of our troops, 
and increased their determination to carry a future 
offensive to greater success. i 
Pass down the long line of trenches holding up 
the German advance, pass south of the Ridge of 
Vimy where the French assaulted earlier in 1915 
and had been checked, down through Arras to 
Compiégne, and so past Soissons on the River 
Aisne, where the left of that glorious Expeditionary 
Force, which Britain first sent to France in 1914, 
hung on to the river, down past Reims to the 
Champagne area—a flat, uninteresting, and unin- 
viting chalk land. There, in September, 1915, the 
French flung themselves upon the Germans, as we 
flung ourselves upon the enemy in front of Loos
-P-A-G-E-165
  Armageddon 159 
and Hulluch, and wrested much ground and many 
prisoners from him. 
Armies, like individuals, must rest, must re-equip 
and re-organize after great exertions, and after those 
two offensives, in 1915, the British made ready for 
further fighting in the year that was to follow. Not 
only British soldiers, but a vast army of workers at 
home, of organizers and administrators, plunged 
whole-heartedly into the giant task of equipping 
Britain with guns and ammunition which would 
overpower those possessed by the enemy, who, in 
the earlier days, and even in 1915, still possessed 
an overwhelming quantity of batteries and missiles 
to hurl at our people. 
History, no doubt, will tell the very interesting 
tale of how munition factories grew up throughout 
England. How men, aye, and women too, by the 
hundred thousand flocked to them to prepare ma- 
terial for their soldiers fighting in Flanders and 
elsewhere; and how, when 1916 dawned, our bat- 
teries in France were becoming far more numerous; 
while of ammunition there was such a supply as 
the world had never before seen and no man had 
ever contemplated. 
In describing British operations, we pass over 
the months preceding July of this eventful year 
with the mere mention that in June the Canadian 
Corps were heavily attacked in front of Hooge and 
the Sanctuary Wood, quite close to Ypres} by an 
overwhelming force of Germans, and that with the 
spirit of those Canadians who had fought so 
valorously in the second Battle of Ypres, near
-P-A-G-E-166
160 Under Haig in Flanders 
St. Julien, those gallant fellows held up the attack, 
and, driven in at the commencement, advanced with 
élan and recaptured their positions. 
Finally, July 1st dawned to the thunder of hun- 
dreds of British guns, which for days had been 
deluging the German positions in Picardy, and 
there commenced along the front of the British 
Third and Fourth Armies, and along the front of 
the French line to their south, an attack the pro- 
portions of which were unprecedented. 
But fully to appreciate the significance and in- 
tention of this huge operation, continuing as it did 
for weeks on end, it becomes necessary to launch 
into a brief description of the general war position. 
Recollect that Britain and France were not the 
only nations allied against the central peoples of 
Europe, comprising Germany and Austria and 
Bulgaria, with the Turks trailing off into the 
Middle East. The colossus Russia formed part 
of our alliance. Italy, too, was already taking no 
inconspicuous part in the effort to crush that mili- 
tary oligarchy which had grown up these forty 
years past in Germany and Austria. Portugal, 
too, had declared war on the Kaiser and his people, 
and as the months rolled on, others were to follow. 
Fighting in those first months of the war, for 
the most part a war of defence, forced upon them 
by necessity, rather than of aggression, the Allied 
nations, perceiving the huge peril which threatened 
them—for the strength of Germany and Austria, 
and particularly of Germany, was then, and, in- 
deed, is now as we write, enormous—the nations 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
Armageddon 161 
in alliance with Great Britain called their most 
trusted people together, and conferences were held 
which settled not the policy of.one of these nations 
alone, but a general policy to be adopted by them 
all. , 
In fact, once the tide had turned, and there were 
munitions in abundance, Russia and France and 
Britain and Italy were to strike at the enemy at 
the selfsame moment. More than that, so that the 
nation unable to supply itself easily with munitions 
might not be crippled in those efforts, others, such 
as Britain, with the vast arrangements she had 
made, would send supplies to that country. 
Yet the best of plans go awry. The Germans, 
hemmed in on the Western Front, held firmly 
on the Eastern Front, where they had driven their 
way through Poland to the borders of Russia; and 
the Austrians also, held in Galicia by the Mus- 
covite armies, and on the Italian Front by the 
troops of the gallant king of that nation, made 
their plans too, and upset those formulated by 
the Entente nations. 
In February of this eventful year of 1916 the 
Crown Prince of Prussia—hated by countless thou- 
sands—launched a gigantic assault on the terrain 
round and about the city of Verdun, the apex of 
an important and very large French salient. Not 
long afterwards the Austrians, having collected 
guns and men and material in the Trentino, hurled 
their masses upon the Italians, striving to break 
in upon their lines of communication with the 
Isonzo Front, and bring about a coup which 
(0 902) 41 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  162 Under Haig in Flanders 
might easily put the Italian nation out of the 
fighting. 
But it is not our purpose to describe those huge, 
conflicts in detail; we merely remind the reader 
that fighting at Verdun, which was of the bitterest 
and the fiercest, went on for months, and still con- 
tinued in June, when our preparations for an offen- 
sive on the River Somme were completed. That 
offensive on the Trentino Front, on the part of the 
Austrians, made some progress also, and there 
were times when the Italians were hard pressed. 
Finally it became necessary for the other partners 
of the alliance, Russia and Britain, to throw the 
weight of their blows upon the enemy, to distract 
their attention and draw off their concentrations 
then levelled upon the French and the Italians 
respectively. Thus, in June, Brusiloff launched 
an impetuous attack upon the Austrian Front in 
Galicia, and captured three hundred thousand 
prisoners and much booty. Then, within a few 
days of that attack, the Franco-British offensive 
on the Somme opened—that offensive in which 
Roger took no unworthy part, and in which he 
was wounded. 
Space forbids that we should attempt even broadly 
to describe the series of operations which continued 
from ist July, 1916, to well on into the winter. 
Suffice it to say that the British fought over a front 
some fifteen miles in length—a front every foot of 
which was heavily fortified, and provided with vast 
underground and concreted dug-outs. Yet it was 
not the capture of ground that we sought, nor the
-P-A-G-E-169
  Armageddon 163 
destruction of dug-outs and defences; it was to 
drive a blow home at the heart of the enemy, to 
destroy the soldiers of the Kaiser, to break the 
strength of the German invader. 
That we went far to achieve this object there is 
no doubt; for we destroyed numbers of the enemy 
and captured thousands of prisoners and guns, and 
much booty. Yet the German line, forced back 
though it had been, still remained; and behind it 
lay Roger and Bill Andrews, prisoners, taken by 
craft and treachery, with no opportunity, it seemed, 
of rejoining their fellows.
-P-A-G-E-170
  CHAPTER XII 
Roger and Bill Andrews 
“‘CapTURED! What's it mean? Who’s the bloke 
here? What’s he grinnin’ for?” growled Bill Andrews 
as he and Roger stood in that enemy trench sur- 
rounded by Germans, with Ernst Hillstein — the 
spy—gaping and mouthing near them. ‘See, you 
here, you German—-for you ain’t a British soldier 
I’m sure; I’1I——” : 
“Steady!” Roger whispered. ‘‘Keep quiet, 
Bill; do nothing to rouse the anger of our guards. 
Who’s he, you ask; listen whilst I tell you.” 
There came a lull in the storm of shells tumbling 
about the place, and heavy firing from a German 
battery some little distance off attracted the atten- 
tion of their guards from the prisoners; even the 
wretch Ernst Hillstein stepped away some paces 
and peered over the parapet of the trench to watch 
what was happening, and in the interval Roger 
rapidly explained who this Ernst Hillstein was, 
how it happened that they were prisoners, and why 
it was that the man dressed in khaki who had lured 
them into the hands of the enemy had a grudge 
against him. 
‘‘He was nothing but a bully, and now that I see 
164
-P-A-G-E-171
  Roger and Bill Andrews 165 
him plainly (for you must remember that on the 
night when I knocked him over it was pitch-dark) 
I remember that he was a rascal well known by the 
police in the town near Hurslet. I seem to remem- 
ber, too, that his father once kept a baker’s shop 
and had once upon a time been a German.” 
_ Ha!” growled Bill, ‘once a German, always 
one—eh?” 
“Always,” admitted Roger bitterly; ‘‘still, he 
was naturalized, and this fellow, because of that, 
and because he was born in England, would be 
British.” 
“To the backbone!” ejaculated Bill with an 
impatient stamp of his heavily-booted foot—‘ to 
the backbone—eh? I know ’em! I’ve seen and 
heard of ’em! Shouting at the top of their voices, 
and waving Union Jacks, and doing all that sort of 
thing in public; but behind yer back, mind you, 
plotting, planning, ready to help the Kaiser. 
Blood’s thicker than water, Mr. Roger; the stuff 
what’s been crammed into the heads of these Ger- 
mans don’t escape so easily, and what the father 
learned. he’ll have passed on to his sons. A spy, 
is he? Well, I’m not surprised at all. Tell us 
more about it.” 
Even when Bill had heard the whole tale he was 
still gaping with amazement. For, indeed, it was a 
most extraordinary and unfortunate coincidence that 
here in the heart of the Somme battle-fields this 
wretch should have come in contact with our hero. 
But Bill was the last soldier to grumble, and just 
the very one to make the best of every circumstance.
-P-A-G-E-172
  166 Under Haig in Flanders 
“What then?” he asked. ‘What’s the next 
move?” 
Roger shrugged his shoulders—a habit he had 
learned since he had come to France. ‘* What 
next?” he answered. ‘‘That depends upon the 
Germans: I suppose we shall be hurried back 
along a communicating trench till we get to the 
rear, where we shall be herded with other prisoners. 
We shall be searched, disarmed, and sent off in 
trucks into the interior. Heaven knows when we 
shall see France again—or England.” 
“Unless,” whispered Bill, for the Germans were 
turning towards them again —‘‘ unless eh, 
mate?” 
Roger nodded his head vigorously. ‘‘Unless we 
escape. Of course that’s always something to be 
thought about,” he said. ‘‘ And if there’s a chance 
we'll try it. You’re game, aren’t you, Bill?” 
‘“‘Game!—me? And you ask it!” answered his 
companion indignantly. ‘‘Meas has fought along- 
side you these many days, me ‘game’ to escape 
from these Germans? Well, you wait; if the chance 
comes you'll learn a thing or two, you will, Mr. 
Roger!” 
“Stop! They’re turning back towards us. Re- 
member, don’t let that rascal rouse you to anger, 
and, whatever you do, don’t attempt to strike him,” 
whispered Roger. ‘‘By the way he looks at us 
he bears us nothing but ill will, and if he can only 
torment us and tantalize us sufficiently to get us to 
do something desperate and stupid—as, for instance, 
striking him—that would be doing precisely what  
-P-A-G-E-173
  
Roger and Bill Andrews 167 
he wants. Remember, too, Bill, the record these 
Germans have; such an act would cause them to 
court-martial us at once—to kill us even without a 
trial. So be on your guard; keep cool, and, above 
all, keep your temper.” 
But when it came to the test, it was hard enough 
for Roger, let alone the impulsive Bill, to remain 
cool when Ernst Hillstein came near them. Find- 
ing that grimaces and grins, meant to show his 
delight at their discomfiture, were insufficient to 
rouse them, he took a rifle from one of the German 
infantrymen and belaboured them with the butt, 
finally even piercing Roger’s coat with the point 
of a bayonet and wounding him slightly. That 
prick and the pain it caused sent the blood surging 
through Roger’s veins, while it caused Bill to 
clench both fists and prepare to launch himself 
upon this ruffian. 
It was fortunate, therefore, that just at that in- 
stant a German officer appeared upon the scene 
and gave a sharp order. 
“Take the prisoners to the rear!” he commanded. 
‘‘Go by the underground communicating trench, 
and see that you get a receipt for them when you 
hand them over. Ah! Who are you—you in 
khaki?” 
Ernst Hillstein treated him toa friendly grin and 
answered in perfect German. 
“Ah! One of our spies, then—born in Eng- 
land?” asked the officer. 
“Yes, in England—and a good place too!” 
“And have now taken sides against what are 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  18 Under Haig in Flanders 
really your own people?” demanded the officer, 
snapping out the question while he fingered the 
butt of his revolver. 
‘What else?” answered Ernst Hillstein a little 
surlily. ‘‘Isn’t it helping the cause? Aren’t you 
Germans in want of assistance?” 
“Pah!” The officer turned on his heel with an 
exclamation of disgust and went off in the opposite 
direction, leaving the spy glowering after him, 
gnashing his teeth, and then staring after the re- 
treating figures of Roger and Bill Andrews. 
‘“‘Down here, quick—they’ve started shelling 
again!” commanded the non-commissioned officer 
who was in charge of their escort. ‘Close in 
behind, you men. If one of these fellows tries to 
escape, bayonet him without hesitation. Forward!” 
It was a curious journey which they made under 
the ground on their way from that forward position, 
and in ordinary times Roger would have been 
vastly interested by his experiences. For though 
he, like thousands of other British officers and men, 
had lain out there in Picardy for many months, 
facing the positions along the Somme front which 
they had attacked on July ist and the days which 
followed, not many, we imagine, had realized for 
a moment what gigantic preparations for defence 
the enemy had made—were making, indeed—all 
the time that our troops were assembling. Here, 
then, was evidence before him of the incessant 
labour of the enemy and of the extraordinary works 
which they had carried out. 
That communicating trench into which he and

  “STAKE THE PRISONERS TO THE REAR!’ HE COMMANDED”
-P-A-G-E-176

-P-A-G-E-177
  Roger and Bill Andrews 169 
Bill were forced to descend, and along which they 
were escorted, was twenty feet beneath the ground, 
encased in wood from end to end, and lit by 
electric light just as brilliantly as had been the 
dug-outs. Down there in the cool depths of this 
boarded place the sound of guns quite close at 
hand came only as a gentle rumble, whilst shells 
might fall overhead and explode, almost without the 
inhabitants of this lair being aware of their coming. 
It pushed straight on without a curve and without 
deviation for many yards, until it entered a series of 
double-decked dug-outs capable of holding some 
hundreds of men, where, indeed, at that moment 
German reserves were massing. 
“On! on!” commanded the non-commissioned 
officer in guttural tones. ‘‘ Push on now, up those 
stairs. That’s better; we’re in the open, and only 
a stray shell can catch us.” 
Ploughing their way through the dust and debris 
of the German position, and now out of sight of 
the British—for they were descending the eastern 
slope of the hill upon which the German lines were 
constructed—Roger and his companion were hurried 
on for perhaps half an hour longer, and finally were 
thrust into a cage constructed of posts and barbed 
wire, where they discovered other British soldiers, 
who unfortunately were prisoners like themselves. 
An hour later they were searched; then, as the even- 
ing came along, they were marched to a near-by 
railway siding, were pushed into trucks, and pre- 
sently were travelling towards the north-east in the 
direction of Germany.
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 Under Haig in Flanders 
“‘That’s the sort of place one doesn’t want to go 
to,” said Bill, as he sat beside Roger in the dark 
carriage. ‘‘Seems to me, Mr. Roger, that now’s 
the time for us to plan an escape if ever we’re to do 
it; for in a little while, a few hours maybe, we shall 
be out of France and even out of Belgium, and then 
it'll be Germany! Hah! Germany! And matters 
will become different.” 
“Yes, different,” agreed Roger. ‘‘But how? 
Here we are boxed in in this truck, some twenty- 
five of us, without weapons, without even a hammer 
with which to break a way out. Looks impossible, 
doesn’t it, Bill?” 
“Aye, it does,” the latter answered somewhat 
sadly. ‘But you never know, do you? Think it 
over! You're the boy, Roger—Mr. Roger, I should 
say—you’re the boy to get hold of something to fix 
these Germans and give us our liberty.” 
“‘And supposing,” said Roger, all of a sudden— 
‘supposing we do see an opportunity, are we then 
to move off, leaving our comrades here?” 
“Ah! that’s a question. Wouldn’t be quite the 
thing—eh? Wouldn’t like that sort of thing to be 
done to me, you know—-not quite the game, eh, 
sir?” 
“Certainly not,” Roger told him; ‘‘certainly 
not, Bill. If one of these fellows suddenly had a 
chance of escape, and there was no opportunity to 
warn the others, of course he’d take it. That’s part 
of the game of war. But here, with twenty-five of

and I wouldn’t even wish todoit. Boys,” he called

out, ‘‘we’re alone here, and there’s no one to listen 
to what we are.saying, for the train’s rumbling and 
rattling so much. Supposing, you boys, there’s 
a chance of getting away—supposing we could 
make that chance—what then?” 
A sturdy Australian pushed his way forward, 
rising from the floor where he had been seated. 
‘What then, sir?” he repeated, recognizing Roger 
as an officer. ‘‘ Why, every one of us would come 
along. Show us the way, and we'll break our way 
out of the van and then take our chance of getting 
back to our fellows.” 
They were a mixed lot of British soldiers in that 
van: a Jock from the Highlands—a sturdy, bow- 
legged, mud-stained individual, whose tin helmet 
would persist in riding at a rakish angle on his 
head; a wizened individual from the West of Eng- 
land, who in better times was the life and soul of 
his battalion—a man who could sing a song and 
dance a jig with anyone, and who was seldom 
down-hearted. These soldiers came from the moun- 
tains of Wales, from the Midlands of England, 
from the south, from almost every part, and from 
quite half.a dozen regiments; and, more than that, 
they came from battalions which had seen much 
fighting and were hardened veterans. 
“Aye, show us the way, sir,” they called one 
after another; ‘‘we’re game for it. Anything’s better 
than going to a German prison.” 
“Then how?—how’s it to be done?” wondered 
Roger, first standing and peering out through the 
many cracks in the sides of the rickety van in which 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 Under Haig in Flanders 
they were travelling, and then squatting down 
again beside Bill and burying his face in his hands. 
‘How? It’s dark outside now, and if only these 
doors were opened there might be a chance. But 
look for yourself, Bill,” he suddenly called aloud; 
‘‘we’re bolted and barred in, and perhaps the next 
van is full of Germans guarding the convoy. Looks 
impossible, don’t it?” 
“So did the German line on the Somme when 
we got to business first of all,” said Bill sturdily. 
“The Germans thought their dug-outs and their 
what-nots impregnable—that’s the word, ain’t it? 
Impregnable. But we bored a way through ’em, 
and our chaps are barging their way on even at 
this moment. Things may look hard and difficult, 
but impossible—never!” 
Yet two hours rolled by—two weary hours—while 
the darkness outside increased. Meanwhile the 
train of trucks crawled onwards, halting sometimes 
for half an hour and then moving on at a sluggish 
pace, while the parallel lines bore other trucks 
making towards the German front, some filled with 
ammunition, others with troops being pushed up 
to support their comrades in their vain attempt to 
hold up the British and the French attack. 
At length they halted in a siding, and more hours 
passed, till, peering through a crevice, Roger felt 
sure that day was about to dawn. It was still quite 
dark, yet up in the eastern sky there was just a 
glimmer of light, a shred, torn as it were in the 
curtain of darkness, a shred of flimsy white which 
seemed to herald the dawn.
-P-A-G-E-181
Roger and Bill Andrews — 173 
“What was that? Hush!” he called; whereat 
the men nodding round him held up their heads of » 
a sudden and listened. ‘‘Hush! I thought I heard 
a gun somewhere near us! There it is again, and 
nearer still! What’s it mean? For by now we 
must be well behind the German guns, and our 
guns could hardly reach.” 
Bill gripped him by the wrist: ‘‘Guns!” he said 
hoarsely, ‘‘anti-aircraft! It’s some of our flying 
boys making their way over the German lines raid- 
ing their communications. Jingo, if that isn’t a 
bomb falling near us! It’ud be hard lines if one 
of our own men were to burst up this train, and 
smash us, his comrades.” 
The words had hardly left his lips when there 
came a terrifying crash and a shattering report 
quite close to the train, which set the trucks shaking 
and rocking; a blast of air struck the line of vehicles 
broadside, and almost swept them from the rails, 
while it caused more cracks to start in the rotten 
woodwork. Cries could be heard from farther along 
the train, the shouts of frightened men, and then 
loud orders. But the voice and the creaking of the 
wagons were drowned a moment later by another 
shattering detonation, followed by shrieks, while 
portions of an exploded bomb, which a British 
aeroplane had dropped from far overhead, hurtled 
through the air, shrieked past the wagons, and 
thudded into their sides. 
As if someone had been stationed outside for that 
very purpose, the doors of the truck in which Roger 
and his comrades had been incarcerated burst
-P-A-G-E-182
    174 Under Haig in Flanders 
open, while they themselves were flattened upon the 
floor, and lay there half-stunned, wholly deafened, 
almost unable to comprehend what had happened. 
Then Roger pulled himself together, and, still shak- 
ing from head to foot, for the concussion had been 
extremely violent, he dragged himself to his feet, 
staggered to the side of the car, and looked out. 
Men were running up and down the line, men 
shouting and bawling at one another. Just in front 
of the truck in which he stood was a tumbled heap 
of twisted ironwork and splintered wood, while the 
darkness hid the forms of Germans who had been 
travelling in it. There was another truck in front 
of that, also a wagon torn from its wheels and cast 
bodily to one side, and from that came the dismal 
cries of men who had been injured. 
“Stop here!” he called over his shoulder. ‘‘ Let 
no man move from the car; I’ll be back as soon as 
I have found out what has happened.” 
He dropped to the rails and walked rapidly 
forward. Yes, the truck next to that from which 
he had just emerged was destroyed almost com- 
pletely, while the one still farther in front had been 
hurled on to the other rail, and lay there like a 
crumpled-up concertina, from which came the notes 
of men whom it contained. Still farther along were 
other trucks also wrecked, for the British airman 
had aimed true enough, and had practically de- 
stroyed the convoy. Roger clambered up on to 
the ruins of that truck from which the voices came, 
and found that, just as in the case of the one which 
he had left, the doors had been burst open. A
-P-A-G-E-183
  Roger and Bill Andrews 175 
bayonet was protruding from the entrance, inside 
lay a dead German, and over his legs a second. 
Groping about, his fingers lit upon another rifle, 
then upon thé accoutrements of a German soldier 
lying amongst the bodies. 
It was war. Had it been otherwise, Roger’s 
first thought would have been to assist the poor 
wretches who had come to grief in the truck. But, 
he reflected, it was war, and their own security had 
to be considered. In a moment he slid down to 
the track again, and ran back to his comrades. 
Clambering up, he stood amongst them and issued 
his orders. 
“‘Not a man must speak,” he said sharply. ‘‘ If 
you come upon a German, pass on without attempt- 
ing to answer any question he may direct to you. 
There’s a truck along the line here which has been 
wrecked and burst open. It appears to have held 
some German soldiers. There are arms in it. I 
want half a dozen of you to come along at once 
and collect those weapons; the remainder will 
get out of the truck and lie on the track near 
it till we return. Then we'll see what’s going 
to happen.” 
In the confusion which reigned about that 
wrecked train, hardly a single German gave a 
thought to the British prisoners it had contained. 
They thought rather of their own safety. Bolting 
away from the scene, they cowered beside the track, 
fearful lest that British aeroplane should return 
and cause more damage. Thus it happened that 
Roger, and those men he took to the wrecked
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 Under Haig in Flanders 
truck, remained undisturbed, and presently re- 
turned to their comrades with a fine haul of arms 
and ammunition. A further search revealed more 
weapons, and in a very short space of time he had 
the satisfaction of knowing that there were rifles 
and bayonets, and in some cases revolvers, for 
every man of his command. 
“‘Good, then!” he said. ‘* Now, we’ll march!” 
‘‘Where, sir?” demanded Bill, his pulses beat- 
ing with excitement. 
‘““Where? Just where it seems best and most 
convenient. Straight away from the track. First 
of all, then, we'll hunt for some sort of a place 
where we can hide and look out for something 
better! March! and not a word from any one of 
you! We want to get out of this mess, don’t we, 
boys? so see that you’re careful.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
CHAPTER XIII 
Cut Off 
GROPING their way through the darkness, and 
hurrying from the railway track, since in its neigh- 
bourhood there were likely to be many German 
soldiers, Roger and the party of British troops he 
led tramped hurriedly off into the country, and, 
gaining a road, marched along it till the streak of 
gathering light in the eastern sky grew broader. 
“‘There’s a wood yonder,” said Bill, who was 
marching beside our hero, pointing to an elevation 
which could be dimly seen in the gathering light 
away on their left. ‘‘ Supposing we were to occupy 
it?” 
“Let’s!” replied Roger laconically. ‘‘ ‘Any port 
in a storm,’ Bill, and I haven’t seen any other likely 
spot which offers a chance of a refuge. Let's 
push on, for the sooner we are under cover the 
better.” 
Breaking into a run, the party soon gained the 
summit of the hill and entered a dense growth of 
trees. Plunging into it, they continued their way 
until they were far in the interior, and until they 
were quite sure that it was of large proportions—a 
forest, in fact. 
(0 902) 17 12
-P-A-G-E-186
178 Under Haig in Flanders 
“Seems to me as though it extends for miles and 
miles,” said Roger, as in their wanderings they 
came to the edge of the wood, and he was able to 
peep out. ‘‘It’s now light enough for one to see 
quite a distance, and so far as I can ascertain the 
forest extends all along this ridge. That’s all the 
better, isn’t it? For the Germans are sure to expect 
that we are here, seeing that it’s within easy dis- 
tance of the railway, and will search it. That’s one 
of the things we shall have to consider seriously ; 
the next is food.” 
“‘ Ah!—food,” echoed Bill. ‘‘ Things have been 
so exciting up to now that one hasn’t given much 
thought to it, but arms and ammunition won’t be 
much good to us unless we have got something to 
eat—something to live on.” 
Turning away from the edge of the wood, and 
now able to press on far more easily because of the 
gathering light, Roger and his men plunged deeply 
into the forest, and, finding a track, followed it for 
some two miles, and then, as it was now quite 
light, turned from it and buried themselves amongst 
the trees. An hour later they heard sounds in the 
distance, and presently came upon a clearing in 
which nestled a tiny French village, which appeared 
almost to have escaped the notice of the German 
invaders. Smoke was issuing from many of the 
chimneys, old people were emerging from their 
houses, while boys and girls were already walking 
out into the patches which French industry had 
cleared of forest, and where cattle were browsing. 
‘‘One of them beasts,” said Bill, fastening a 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  Banu m a we i Ge eee % a 
Cut Off 179 
covetous eye on a heifer not far oft—‘‘one of them 
beasts dragged in here and slaughtered and cooked 
would provide this little lot with a square meal, 
wouldn’t it, Mr. Roger? And when you look at 
the smoke coming out of those chimneys—my, 
don’t it give you an appetite! They’ll be cooking 
things in there, Mr. Roger, omelettes, perhaps— 
lor’, don’t it make a man’s mouth water! Um! I 
swear I can smell the coffee that they are preparing 
for breakfast, and—strike me, if there ain’t fowls 
trotting about! Now, just a few of them, sir, would 
keep this little lot of soldiers quiet. D’you think 
it’s possible?” 
“Depends! We must look on for a while and 
make sure that no Germans are in the neighbour- 
hood. There’s something else, too, to be con- 
sidered,” said Roger, as he thought about the 
matter. ‘‘If I, for instance, were to make my 
way into the village, supposing no Germans to 
be there, and the people were to give me food for 
this party, who’d be the first to suffer?” 
“‘Aye, who?” said Bill, scratching his head re- 
flectively. ‘‘ Everyone knows the Huns ’ud come 
down hard upon the old folks here. No, sir, it 
can’t be done in that way; these French people 
must be kept ignorant of our presence. If we must 
have food, and, of course, we must, we’ve got to 
take it without asking.” 
“And in the meanwhile,” added Roger, his brains 
working busily, ‘‘we’ve got to post look-outs, so 
that if the Germans do attempt to search this forest, 
we shall be aware of their coming.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  18 Under Haig in Flanders 
They sat ina circle under the trees and discussed 
matters; in fact, held a species of council in which 
Roger and his men exchanged views quite freely. 
Then, to make sure that those who were to be posted 
as look-outs should have no difficulty in returning 
to their comrades, special instructions were given to 
the selected men. 
““ We've got to be unusually canny,” said Roger, 
‘(and shall have to copy a Red Indian dodge, and 
one adopted by all American backwoodsmen: you 
fellows who go out must blaze your way by cutting 
a notch from the bark of the trees that you pass. 
A cut with a bayonet will do it easily, and will not 
delay you very much. Then, if you have to return, 
you will get back to the main party in double-quick 
time; also, you will have the feeling all the while 
that there is no possibility of losing your fellows.” 
Four men were quickly selected, and were at once 
sent off, two towards the edge of the forest which 
the party had recently left, and two in precisely the 
opposite direction. A fifth man was then posted 
close to the cutting which Roger and his men had 
followed a little earlier, while the remainder sat. 
down within the shadow of the trees watching the 
tiny village. 
Far away in the distance the deep guttural boom 
of guns could be heard, while more than once an 
aeroplane swished overhead bearing the iron cross 
—the mark of the Germans. Sometimes Roger 
even fancied that he could hear the distant faint 
rattle of machine-guns; but, after all, it might only 
have been fancy, for it was hours now since he and
-P-A-G-E-189
    Cut Off 181 
his men had been incarcerated in that railway truck; 
and though the convoy of trucks had travelled on 
only at a snail’s pace, yet, for all he knew, the spot 
where it was wrecked might have been miles from 
those historic battle-fields of the Somme, where 
British and French were fighting to defeat the 
Kaiser’s armies. 
What would Roger not have given to be back 
there with the British troops? And in that respect 
every one of the gallant fellows now with him held 
precisely similar views. For, like every one of the 
fine fellows whom Britain had trained and sent to 
the front, they had entered upon those Somme 
operations with a gusto there was no denying. 
This war is no ordinary war, as the least intelligent 
will admit, and one of the particular points for 
which it is notorious is the cosmopolitan character 
of the men who form the magnificent British force 
which our Empire has thrown into this battle of 
nations. 
In the ranks there are to be found men from 
every part of the world where the British flag flies, 
and, indeed, from many other quarters. They have 
come from towns and backwoods and prairies of 
Canada, from the rugged interior of Newfound- 
land, from the farms and cities of Australia, and 
from a hundred different places. There are farmers, 
mechanics, workers in every class of material, pro- 
fessional men, lawyers, architects, and a host of 
others amongst them; while, throughout the ranks, 
the order of intelligence of our fighting-men may 
be said to be on a different plane entirely from that
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 Under Haig in Flanders 
of the men, for instance, who fought in the days of 
Wellington, in the Crimean campaign, even in the 
war we waged against the Boers in South Africa 
but a few years ago—those Boers who are now 
our firm friends and who have given us such able 
assistance. 
What wonder, then, that throughout the ranks 
there is a clearer conception, in these days of better 
education, and having regard to the cosmopolitan 
character of the men themselves, than was the case 
in the former days? Individuals understand more 
readily and more thoroughly what it is they are 
fighting for, and, better still, they understand the 
nature of the operations in which they are to take 
their part. Thus, as the months of this war have 
rolled on, and first tne German advance was checked, 
and then the might of Britain increased, so that she 
in her turn was able to drive forward, a keenness 
to be up and doing passed through the ranks, and 
the commencement of that gigantic Battle of the 
Somme found our soldiers ready and eager for the 
conflict, and thoroughly aware of the fact that it 
was not ground that they were fighting for, not so 
much the capture of this village or of that, but that 
they were fighting to break the strength of the Ger- 
man army, to drive in hard blows which should 
damage his strength and his moral. 
To be torn then from the battle-line, when already 
our troops had achieved much in their efforts, was a 
huge disappointment, and one which Roger and 
his men felt keenly. As to the battle itself, it would 
be wellnigh impossible, in the space at our disposal, 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
Cut Off 183 
to do more than give a rough description of it, for 
to do more would be perhaps to confuse our readers. 
Yet such an historical combat must of necessity 
receive adequate mention. 
We have said already that the British had for 
months been preparing their blow, and that the 
conflict commenced on 1st July of this eventful 1916. 
Let us go further—let us even anticipate events a 
little—by stating that the conflict raged throughout 
the months of July, August, and September, and, 
checked by bad weather in October, proceeded once 
more in November. In effect, it was a series of 
battles all along the line, from Gommecourt, north 
and west of the River Ancre, down to Maricourt, 
just to the north of the River Somme; while from 
that point, where the French lay alongside our 
forces, the battle-line extended to some miles south 
of the Somme. Even to outline the advances made, 
to describe in the broadest detail the difficulties met 
with, the triumphs achieved, and the gallantry dis- 
played by our men, would be to pack our pages. 
Let it suffice that we mention the fact that on that 
eventful rst July, when the action opened, the 
British left, from Gommecourt down to and south 
of the River Ancre, met terrific German resistance, 
for it was just there that the enemy had anticipated 
an attack, and that they had massed guns and 
men in stupendous numbers. 
Thus it followed that from Gommecourt to La 
Boiselle little or no progress was made, and very 
severe fighting ensued. But south of La Boiselle, 
to Maricourt, there was a brilliant advance to the  
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 Under Haig in Flanders 
north and south of the Fricourt salient, which thus 
was almost surrounded, and, indeed, fell to our 
arms within a day or so; while farther south the 
French, striking with fury and that magnificent élan 
which has carried them to victory so often, found 
the Germans less prepared, and broke through 
their first-line defences. Thereafter British and 
French fought their way into the enemy’s second 
line, and gained the ridges about the Somme. 
Another effort carried them to and through the 
German third line, and so to his fourth; while 
November saw the British advance along the line 
from Gommecourt to Thiepval, following the valley 
of the Ancre, where they had been repulsed on a 
former occasion, and saw them drive deep into the 
invader’s position. One word more. Preparations 
for a renewed offensive in 1917 caused the enemy 
to consider the position seriously. For the Allies 
had been within an ace of wrecking their line and 
breaking right through in those operations of 1916. 
Fearful of such a happening, the Kaiser’s troops 
retired, in the late spring, along a great length 
of their front, yielding to the Allies hundreds of 
square miles of ravished country. It was a symbol 
and a significant sign of what was to follow. It 
was a triumph for the Allies and a bitter blow to 
our ruthless enemy. 
Having thus brought events to the year 1917, 
anticipating by some months, as we have men- 
tioned, let us again return to Roger and his men, 
captives in the enemy country; yet hardly captives 
after all, seeing that they had escaped from their
-P-A-G-E-193

es Cut Off 185 
guards and were at liberty behind the lines of the 
Germans. 
‘‘There’s men marching over toward the wood, 
sir,” one of the outposts who had been sent out to 
watch reported, some two hours later. ‘‘ Fifty-two 
of ’em, sir, and an officer with them.” 
“‘Coming this way?” asked Roger anxiously. 
“No, sir; entering the wood at the far end. I 
left my mate to keep an eye on them, and came in 
to report.” 
‘Then we'll send a couple of men along the drive, 
so as to watch their movements. Better still, I'll 
go myself. Sergeant Thomas, you'll take com- 
mand of the party while I’m absent, and will send 
along the drive if you have any further information. 
Bill, you and I'll go at once. We've got to deal 
with those fellows.” 
Leaving their men seated amongst the trees, and 
enjoining upon them the necessity to keep away 
from the observation of the villagers, Roger and 
Bill set off along the central ride, which made its 
way true and straight down the centre of the forest. 
“We'll run,” said Roger. ‘‘ The sooner we know 
the intentions of those men the better. Of course, 
if it’s possible, I shall let ’em pass through while 
we're hiding. But if they separate, and it is im- 
possible to avoid them, I shall try to teach ’em a 
lesson.” | 
Bill guffawed. ‘One of the same sort as you 
taught that there Ernst fellow. Now if he hap- 
pened to come along, mark you, me lad, Mr. Roger, 
I’d ask leave to have a word or so with him, just 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
    16 Under Haig in Flanders 
a word, sir. And you'll understand, we wouldn’t 
want to get making speeches.” 
Bill swung the butt of his German rifle over his 
head significantly, and grinned, while Roger joined 
in his merriment. 
“Stop! Isaw someone. Ah! It’s the man we 
posted up this way. Look here, Turner,” said 
Roger, beckoning to the man whose figure he had 
espied lurking at the edge of the drive, ‘‘there is 
information that the enemy are entering the wood 
up at the farend. We’re going to keep an eye on 
them. If by chance any come this way, get back 
to the party and warn them, and then send a mes- 
sage along to us. Now, Bill, trot.” 
They kept on at a steady pace for half an hour, 
and then, leaving the drive, dived in amongst the 
trees and bracken. Creeping through the wood 
now, it was not long before they heard voices, and 
presently came upon the party of Germans whose 
presence had been reported. 
“Having a feed before beginning their search,” 
whispered Roger, as he and Bi!l peered through 
the trees at the invaders. ‘‘ Got a water-cart and a 
general-service cart with ’em.” 
‘Rations,” gurgled Bill. ‘Them ruffians has 
got a fire workin’, and blest if they ain’t cooking 
their grub. Bah! Ain’t it sickening to see ’em, 
and we nigh starving.” 
‘« Sickening!” agreed Roger, sniffing the breeze, 
which wafted the smell of cooking meat from the 
enemy camp through the trees and so to his nos- 
trils.. ‘‘Sickening! Look here, Bill, It seems to
-P-A-G-E-195
Cut Off 187 
me that food and drink are just as important to us 
as is liberty. What’s the good of freedom if you 
can’t enjoy it, if you’re starving?” 
“Aye, what’s?” grunted the Corporal. ‘‘ Seems 
to me that instead of puttin’ liberty first, we’d better 
get busy and think of our stomachs. We could 
hang on without food for another day, perhaps. 
But then we’d be weakened, and wouldn’t be up 
to fightin’. So what about taking that cart and 
the grub in it, sir? Properly handled, our fellows 
would make short work of these fellows.” 
Roger thought hard as he watched the enemy, 
and then turned abruptly from the camp and led 
the way back toward the open ride, passing through 
the forest. ‘You stay here and keep an eye on 
’em,” he told Bill. ‘‘ Hide in amongst the trees, 
and if they show signs of movement, return to the 
main party. I'll get back at once and bring them 
along. I’m going to take that cart, Bill, if there 
are a hundred Germans with it.” 
He left his old chum grinning, standing just 
within the trees, his rifle slung across his shoulder, 
ready for anything that might happen. Then 
Roger went off at his best speed, first amongst the 
trees and a little later down the centre of the drive, 
where his fleeing figure was hardly likely to attract 
attention. A quarter of an hour later he rejoined 
the party, just after one of the outposts had come in. 
“Nothing to report, sir,” he said to Roger, 
saluting as if they were still with the British army. 
‘Those fifty men are all that have entered the wood 
on our side.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  18 Under Haig in Flanders 
“Then all the better for our plans. I want all 
the outposts brought in at once,” said Roger. 
“Let a man go out in each direction and follow 
the blaze marks. As soon as you get to our out- 
posts, hurry back as fast as your legs can bring 
you. Boys, those Huns have good food and drink 
with them. I’ve an idea that you’d do a lot to get 
hold of it. Then, once we’ve fed, we shall be in 
a better position and in a better temper to consider 
the difficult future.” 
Under other conditions they would have cheered 
him. Now they showed their delight by broad 
grins. Then a man went off in each direction, 
while the others sat down and waited. Half an 
hour later the united party was hurrying along 
the drive, where presently they came upon Bill 
lolling amongst the trees, coolly smoking a clay 
pipe he had had the good fortune to have with 
him. 
‘And them chaps is a-doin’ the same,” he re- 
ported. ‘I’ve been across to their camp half a 
dozen times, and the last found ’em lollin’ about, 
as if they was waitin’ for another party. They was 
still eatin’, hang ’em, and 1 felt like walking right 
in and gettin’ what’s left in the cart before they 
could finish with it. Officer been out into the 
drive once, and stood there listenin’, as if he 
expected someone to come from the opposite 
direction.” 
“Ah! From the opposite direction. Then it 
looks as if two parties had been told off to search 
the forest. One of you men strike off to the left, 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  Cut Off 189 
blazing a path as.you go. The moment you hear 
or see more Germans approaching, come back and 
let us know. It looks to me, men, as if we might 
elude the search-party by marching towards the 
point of the wood. The Germans in camp near 
here entered near it, and probably searched it as 
they came along, and will report to the other party, 
should it arrive, that all is clear behind them. Now, 
if we slipped along pretty soon, we’d leave them 
the whole forest to search, and that'll keep them 
busy, while we can make off, if necessary, into the 
open. But first we must get something to eat, 
and as to that, very much depends on what course 
the enemy follow.” 
A careful move toward the enemy camp told 
Roger quite a lot, for he found the Germans there 
stirring. They were broken up into parties of four, 
and their officer was giving them their orders. 
“Bother! Wish I could speak their lingo, for 
then I could tell what’s going to happen. But it 
looks as if they were going to form a chain right 
across the wood on this side of the centre drive, 
while it’s probable that the other party, when it 
arrives, will search the other side. The sooner we 
get beyond them the better.”” 
“There’s fifty of ’em and an officer marching 
through the trees in this direction,” Roger was 
told immediately on his return to his men, for the 
one who had been sent off had come back within 
a few minutes. ‘Seems to me, sir, as if they’d 
bivouacked some way up toward the tip of the 
forest, for I could smell a fire.”
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 += Under Haig in Flanders 
‘And they’re marching down here, on this side 
of the drive?” asked Roger. 
‘*This side, sir. Strung out in small parties so 
far as I could see; coming along slowly.” 
Roger was not the sort of officer who takes long 
to make up his mind. 
‘*The sooner we’re away from this the better,” 
he told his men. ‘‘Slip across the ride at once, 
and see that not one of you makes a sound. We've 
got to get beyond the party I’ve just been watching, 
and then we shall be safe. Look out for dead twigs 
and branches, for they snap with the sound of a 
rifle. Get into single file once we’re in the trees 
across the ride; and don’t scatter, whatever 
happens.” 
They could hear voices coming from the distance 
now; and hardly had they contrived to slip across 
the wide drive cut through the forest than a figure 
emerged, an officer, who put a whistle to his lips 
and sent out a loud signal. A minute later another 
figure appeared, farther up, toward the tip of the 
forest, and the two, having saluted, approached one 
another. 
“Come along quickly. We shall be lucky if we 
do it,” whispered Roger. Then, leading the way 
toward the outside edge of the forest, he pushed on 
through the bracken and trees till he felt sure that 
he was well beyond the camp he had been watch- 
ing. Turning then to his left, he struck boldly 
toward the tip of the wood, halting at last when 
he and his men were some hundreds of yards 
behind the enemy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-199

“That has done it splendidly,” he told them. 
“‘Lie down and rest, and no talking. Bill, you'll 
come along with me. We must watch those 
fellows.” 
It was precisely half an hour later when the two 
reappeared, Bill evidently somewhat excited. 
“They're off,” explained Roger. ‘The men 
have been divided up into small parties and are 
marching away from us through the wood, search- 
ing each side of the drive. In half an hour they’ll 
be out of hearing. Meanwhile it will interest you 
all to hear that they’ve packed their ration wagons 
in the camp which we just now slipped by, and 
have left ten men with them. Ten men won’t keep 
you fellows away from your dinners.” 
“Ten men!” grinned Bill, pulling his belt in with 
a jerk. ‘‘Not a hundred of ’em won’t keep us off. 
See here, mates, I’m that empty that I’ve got to 
hitch my belt up a hole, and even then I’m hollow. 
You ain’t goin’ to be kept away from grub that’s 
yours for the takin’, just because ten Huns is a- 
watchin’ of it?” 
Those fine fellows licked their lips and gripped 
their rifles, standing ready for Roger’s orders. 
Ten men indeed! The pangs of hunger, which the 
mere mention of food near at hand increased, would 
have made them face with eager haste the hundred 
which Bill had mentioned. 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
CHAPTER XIV 
Foiling the German 
‘“‘AnpD then, of course, we comes to the other part of 
the business, a prickly, knotty sort o’ business too, 
eh, sir?” grinned Bill as he lolled near Roger and 
sent a wisp of tobacco smoke across the clearing 
where Germans had so recently been feeding. 
“And, as you was sayin’, sir, a little while back, 
afore we’d had a feed, once we had got sommat 
tucked away under our jackets we’d be able the 
better to tackle this here future business.” 
“Precisely!” laughed Roger, amused as always 
by Bill’s cheery sayings, while the men guffawed. 
Not, let us explain, that they forgot what was due 
to their officer. Far from it; especially since Bill 
had been able, during the few hours these gallant 
fellows had been together, to impart a few facts to 
them—facts, be it understood, relating to Roger in 
particular. 
“‘Jined along o’ me asa plain private. Was put 
up to non-commissioned rank afore you could say 
Jack Robinson, and gets marked for a commission 
before we leaves the old country. Well, you’ve 
seen and heard him, and you can judge that he’s 
the one fit for such an honour. But it warn’t his 
192
-P-A-G-E-201
Foiling the German 193 
speech—what’s that of a gent—nor his smartness 
that got him the commission. No,” said Bill, 
glowering upon his audience lest one should dare 
to disagree with him. ‘He just foughi for and 
won it. Come closer, you chaps. There may be 
a Hun somewhere near, and you never know when 
they speak English. Come here, and I’ll pitch yer 
a yarn of a Tank what’ll make yer eyes water and 
yer ears twitch, a tale what’s to do with this here 
officer.” 
Thus, thanks to the introduction Bill had given 
our hero, but more to Roger’s own attractive per- 
sonality and outstanding qualities, these men he 
now commanded took to him promptly, and already 
had the greatest confidence in him. Yet the affair 
was a strange one. Discipline, under the circum- 
stances, was naturally enough relaxed; and, after 
all, Roger’s own merry, smiling face encouraged 
a smiling response from these gallant fellows. 
“Precisely!” laughed Roger when Bill had 
spoken. ‘‘I agree that we have fed well, and I 
cordially approve of the German ration which we 
have just eaten. Things have gone splendidly so 
far. Now we've got to consider how to get back ta 
our own lines. That, my friends, will want quite 
a lot of doing.” 
“Quite!” they admitted, nodding at him. 
“Quite!” agreed Bill with a shake of his tousled 
head. ‘‘ Why not?” he suddenly exclaimed, tossing 
his head up and looking round the circle of his 
comrades, while he brought one huge, sun-baked 
paw down with a sounding crack on his thigh. 
(0.902) 13  
-P-A-G-E-202
  199 Under Haig in Flanders 
‘“Why shouldn’t we?” he demanded; ‘‘eh? That’s 
what I want to know. Who’s to stop us?” 
They looked at him in some kind of amazement; 
for it should be understood that the men assembled 
there in the wood, stretched at their ease, some 
seated with their backs resting against the tree- 
trunks, others lounging full length, the majority 
smoking—for they still had sufficient tobacco to 
go round, having fortunately captured quite a 
respectable ration lately—these men had, until a 
few hours ago, been practically unknown to one 
another. One man had been captured at the point 
where a British attack had not quite reached its 
objective, but, being caught by a counter-attack, 
or coming up against severe opposition, had been 
forced to retire, leaving prisoners in the hands of 
the enemy. Such affairs are inevitable in warfare; 
they occur fairly constantly all along the line, par- 
ticularly in such gigantic operations as had been 
proceeding, and were even then still continuing 
along the historic front in Picardy. Other men 
had fallen captive in some other part, two or 
three more elsewhere, and so on. Not till they 
were herded in a prisoner cage at the back of 
the German front had these gallant fellows met, 
and not until they were ordered into that railway 
truck and went rumbling over the lines en route 
for Germany did they really come into close contact 
with one another. 
Yet there was always that password amongst 
them which brings British soldiers together: they 
were soldiers of the King, comrades in this great
-P-A-G-E-203
  
Foiling the German 195 
effort to destroy the German fiend—the Kaiser— 
and his war lords, and the military machine 
which they and the German nation between them 
had constructed with a definite purpose. That 
purpose, as all must admit, was to ravage the 
world, to stamp beneath the heel of Germany all 
opposing nations, to create a vast German Empire 
which should stretch round the globe, to oppose 
right by might, to slaughter ruthlessly all who 
objected. That was the undoubted purpose of the 
German nation. Yet, thanks to our gallant ally, 
France, thanks no less to the Russians, and— 
remember it to your dying day!—thanks to that 
gallant Expeditionary Force and to the soldiers 
who followed, the plot had been foiled, the con- 
spirators had been checked. Each and every one 
of the soldiers who had gone to face the enemy 
was a brother, linked to the rest by a chain of cir- 
cumstances which made fast friends and comrades 
of all. 
Yet, if men became friendly on the instant be- 
cause of the password we have mentioned, they 
yet may well be ignorant of the characteristics and 
the ideas and ways of their fellows. Bill was a 
good enough fellow, an excellent corporal, and a 
fine fighting-man. That is what the little company 
of soldiers had learned already. But what was 
this outburst?—the man was quite excited. 
“Hold on!” cried the Sergeant whom Roger 
had placed in charge of the little party during 
his absence; ‘‘what’s that, Corporal? I don’t get 
you!” 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
    196 Under Haig in Flanders 
‘*See here,” said Bill, nettled because he was 
not yet understood, though a moment’s reflection 
would have told him that that was impossible, 
seeing that he had not yet explained himself; ‘see 
here, Sergeant—beg pardon, Mr. Roger—but I 
suddenly thought of a wheeze. Here’s ten of these 
German fellows what we’ve just taken prisoners— 
ten soldiers in field grey—we number twenty-six 
altogether. Let’s go out and take sixteen more of 
the beggars; then what’s to prevent us dressing up 
as Germans? That won’t hurt anyone for awhile,” 
he declared, glaring round at his comrades. ‘‘Who 
says it will? I'd like to hear him.” 
Roger smiled. This was Bill all over—the irre- 
sistible and emphatic and impulsive Bill. 
‘‘Hold on, Corporal, just a moment,” he said, 
lifting a hand. ‘It’s a splendid plan, I grant you, 
but. . 
“Aye, but,” echoed the Sergeant, ‘‘ there’s some- 
thing against it, sir, I wouldn’t wonder.” 
“‘That’s for all of you to choose,” said Roger. 
“Supposing, now, we’d sufficient German uniforms, 
and were to disguise ourselves in them, what then? 
We've got to fight our way out in any case, and 
before we get back to our own lines we shall meet 
with many difficulties. Just suppose we are 
rounded up and captured, what then?” 
“Aye, what then?” sniffed the Sergeant. 
“Ah! Oh! What then?” repeated Bill, his 
mouth rather wide open, looking a little crest- 
fallen. |   
**You begin to get me, Corporal, I think. Sup
-P-A-G-E-205
  Foiling the German 197 
posing we were rounded up, every one of us would 
be put against a tree and shot out of hand. The 
Germans aren’t the people to draw fine distinctions, 
and though they would know very well that we 
had donned their uniforms merely for the purpose 
of making our escape, they’d arrest us and seize 
upon the opportunity of turning us into spies. 
Spies, I hardly need remind you, meet with little 
mercy from the enemy. Still,” he went on, ‘‘if 
you would like——” 
The Sergeant spoke up at once. 
‘‘We’re ready to do just as you tell us to, sir,” 
he said, his eyes sparkling; ‘‘and if you think that 
getting into German uniforms is the very best plan 
for us, why, we will do it, and take the risk, but——” 
and he shook his head. 
“But you'd rather fight it out in khaki—eh?” 
“T would,” the Sergeant answered bluntly. ‘“‘I’d 
far rather take my chance and be shot in clean 
fighting—in clean khaki—than be taken dead or 
alive in the Kaiser’s uniform; dead or alive, sir, I 
don’t want ever to be found wearing those colours.” 
“Then that settles it; so we can go on with 
plans for an escape. Naturally enough we shan’t 
venture out of the wood till the night falls,” said 
Roger. ‘I’ve been making a little calculation, 
and I feel quite sure that the very fact that the Ger- 
mans left their ration-carts here, and those ten men 
in charge of them, points to their intention to return 
here this evening. Then, of course, they will learn 
at once that the prisoners they are in search of are, 
or have been, in the wood, and to-morrow the place
-P-A-G-E-206
    198 Under Haig in Flanders 
will be scoured from end to end. But perhaps we 
might get over that difficulty.” 
“Ah! now we’re coming to it,” said Bill, sucking 
at his pipe; ‘‘yes, sir?” 
‘‘But supposing we were to move on ourselves. 
If we placed outposts down the wood, who will 
warn us of the return of those Germans, we can 
meanwhile move up to the very tip of the forest; 
and then, as darkness falls, just when I imagine the 
enemy will return to their camp, we can slip out 
into the open, taking the carts and the prisoners 
with us. After that——” 
‘“‘Hum! that’s where it comes in, sir,” said Bill, 
with a quaint grin; ‘‘the after part is the job. 
Still, we’ve been very lucky, so let’s leave the after 
part to take care of itself.” 
Men nodded and smiled; jovial fellows seated 
round Roger sucked at their cigarettes or pipes 
with quiet contentment. Happy-go-lucky as the 
British soldier is, these fine fellows took everything 
that came without grumbling, though to be sure, 
earlier on in the day, the need for food had made 
them feel anything but pleasant. Now, the fact 
of having tucked away a most excellent meal, 
together with the full knowledge that the captured 
carts contained more provisions, sufficient indeed 
to support them two or three days, and, better still, 
the remembrance that they had so far outwitted ‘the 
enemy, kept them in the very best of tempers. 
Yet precautions had to be taken, and Roger, as 
became a careful leader, at once posted men far 
along in the wood on either side, and at the top
-P-A-G-E-207
  Foiling the German 199 
behind them, with orders to blaze their way to their 
posts, and to fall back at once and give information 
of any hostile movements. Hours passed, during 
which the remainder of the men slumbered for the 
most part, Roger himself even indulging in a 
siesta. 
At six o’clock, when it was already getting dusk, 
steaming coffee was handed round by one of the 
men, and a ration issued; while the German pri- 
soners, over whom stood two of the men, were also 
given food and drink. Just then one of the out- 
posts returned. 
'  “Dve been right along the drive, past that French 
village, sir,” he reported, ‘‘and by chance came to 
a place where by scouring to the outskirts of the 
wood I was able to look right along it. It goes on 
for some two or three miles in that direction, and 
then there is bare ridge for another mile or so, and 
then there are other tufts of wood about which I 
saw Germans.” 
‘“‘Ah—Germans! They’ve been searching for 
us then?” asked Roger. 
“‘T think so—looks like it, sir. I could see some 
of them coming out of the woods, and there were 
parties marching away from the others. Altogether 
there were a score of little clumps of forest; but 
back here this wood ends at the top, the ridge de- 
scends, and you get lower ground leading to the 
railway, which was as clear as clear; I could even 
see the line where our train was wrecked, and the 
trucks lying smashed to pieces beside it. But I’ve 
come back, sir, to report that those two parties of 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 +~+Under Haig in Flanders 
Germans are on their way back, and when I left 
them they had halted at the French village.” 
_ Roger stood up suddenly. If he had been Bill 
he would perhaps have given vent to some expres- 
sive exclamation, or have sent his palm crashing 
against his thigh, or in other ways given evidence 
of some amount of excitement. As it was, he merely 
stood erect and called the men about him. 
‘“‘ We'll move,” he said. ‘‘ Within ten minutes 
the outposts we sent along the drive will return, for 
they too will have heard the Germans. We'll send 
out for the others at once, and as soon as all have 
joined we’ll march straight up through the trees or 
in the drive till we come to the very edge of the 
forest.” 
“Ha!” grunted Bill, glad to get a move on. 
“And then, sir?” 
‘“‘And then,” said Roger, ‘if only it’s dark 
enough, we’ll make our way into the open. Tell 
me, my lad,” he suddenly demanded, turning to the 
young soldier who had recently returned and re- 
ported; ‘‘ you saw roads—is there one which would 
help us to pass from the wood right along to those 
little clumps of forest that you have told us about?” 
The man thought for a moment, and then smiled. 
“Yes, sir; there is a road to the west that runs 
along quite close to the forest, keeping to the high 
land. I could see it running on for miles. It 
would do a treat, but—you’re thinking of those 
other clumps, sir?” 
Roger nodded. ‘‘Certainly,” he said. ‘It must 
be quite obvious to every one of you that the Ger-
-P-A-G-E-209
  Foiling the German 201 
mans have searched all of them. If they thought it 
worth their while to send two large parties into this 
forest, they would certainly have detached men to 
see whether we had entered any of those others. 
Having searched them and found no trace of us, 
they will look elsewhere. Of course that suggests 
at once that we should select one of them and hide 
up in it.” 
“‘ But—but, these here Germans,” said Bill, jerk- 
ing a dirty thumb in the direction of their prisoners, 
“what about them? Besides, are we to keep ’em 
and feed ’em on the grub that we’ve captured—and 
what'll be wanted badly?” 
Roger smiled again at that, and the men burst 
into hilarious laughter at his answer. 
“‘Oh, the men—our prisoners!” he said. ‘Well, 
of course, we don’t want them, Bill, do we? Can’t 
we lose ’em? Can’t we halt at the edge of the wood 
once it’s dark, send a party with our prisoners away 
into the country, say for half a mile, and set ’em 
loose, with orders to keep going on straight if they 
don’t want to receive unpleasant treatment. After 
that, this party can turn which way it likes. They 
haven’t overheard our plans, for I took care to have 
’em put at a safe distance. You never know when 
one of your prisoners understands your language. 
Too many Germans have lived in our country.” 
“ Aye,” agreed Bill, ‘‘too many of ’em. I ain’t 
one of the swells that goes to hotels and such like, 
but they tell me that in London, and in every big 
city, you couldn’t eat unless food was placed before 
you by a German; and they’d got all the best
-P-A-G-E-210
  202 Under Haig in Flanders 
billets too, those Germans—the clever rascals! But 
this losing the prisoners, sir, that’s the move— 
that’s the ticket! Blest if it ain’t the very wheeze 
to get over this ’ere difficulty. As to losing Ger- 
mans, well, if you was to take a regiment or so and 
lose ’em altogether, who’d miss ’em?” he growled, 
with a significant toss of his head, and with the 
nearest approach to a sneer that anyone had seen 
this gallant and emphatic corporal indulge in. 
Perhaps an hour later one of the outposts re- 
turned to say that the German parties were now 
leaving the village in the heart of the forest, and 
were moving towards their bivouac; and with him 
came his fellows. 
““Then it’s time we were moving,” said Roger. 
“It’s already quite dark in here, so we will make 
boldly for the central drive and pass along it. By 
the time we get to the outskirts of the forest it will 
be quite dark, and we shall be able to move into 
the open without difficulty. Bill, you will be in 
charge of the prisoners—you and half a dozen of 
the men. Pile their rifles on the carts, and take 
every round of ammunition they’ve got. Sergeant, 
you will take a man and go ahead at once, so as to 
make sure that our road is clear. You, Corporal 
Tims, will form a rear-guard with one of your com- 
rades, so as to make sure that we shan’t be sur- 
prised. Now let’s get a move on!” 
“*Getting a move on,” in the case of this little 
party of stranded British soldiers, consisted in the 
collection of their prisoners, a few sharp words of 
command, a flourish of Bill’s rifle, and then the
-P-A-G-E-211
  Foiling the German 203 
movement of prisoners and escort through the 
woods into the drive. They were followed by 
Roger and the main party, and behind them came 
the captured carts—two water-carts, and two con- 
taining food and ammunition. Then the rear-guard 
moved on, all in perfect order and in silence. Not 
a soul was met during their progress, and at length, 
when the dusk had grown deeper, and the men 
could not see beyond fifty yards, they reached the 
very edge of the forest, and emerged from it into 
the open. . 
“Halt!” If Bill couldn’t speak German he could 
give an order in such emphatic tones that even a 
dull obtuse Teuton could understand his meaning; 
and at that sharp order, which came like a crack 
from a pistol, the body of prisoners came to a stand- 
still. 
‘““The main body will advance with me down 
the road; the prisoners, under Corporal Andrews’ 
command, will follow. Move on! March!” com- 
manded Roger, while more than one of his men 
wondered what was his meaning. 
Some twenty minutes later he halted his party 
far down the road, at a point where another road 
intersected it, or rather crossed it at right angles. 
“‘Now you can take your party of prisoners to 
the right,” Roger told Bill, pulling him aside for 
a moment, ‘‘and—er—you will lose ’em about a mile 
off. It won’t hurt these fellows to do a double, so 
take them along as fast as you can.” 
‘‘But—but—” spluttered Bill, ‘‘that’s our way! 
—we’re going to the right; that’s what we decided.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  204 Under Haig in Flanders 
““Of course, I know that,” barked Roger, a little 
impatiently; ‘‘leave the thinking to me, and carry 
on your job without any further palaver—that is, 
if you can,” added he, smiling grimly. 
Bill drew himself up with a rueful grin. ‘ Right 
y’are, sir!” replied he, and, turning to the waiting 
gang of prisoners, relieved his ruffled feelings by a 
peremptory order in a fierce tone, which set them 
moving in double-quick time in the required 
direction. 
As the sound of their hae grew faint in the 
distance, Roger withdrew with his party into the 
wooded belt fringing the road, to await the arrival 
of the rear-guard with the carts. Flinging himself 
down well in cover at a point which commanded 
the road in either direction, he gave himself up 
to reflection. He did not underrate the serious- 
ness of the position in which he and those who 
trusted themselves to him for safety found them- 
selves, but his naturally optimistic disposition in- 
clined him to look on the bright, rather than the 
dark side of their future prospects. So far luck 
had been with them. They had eluded the search- 
parties of the enemy, and captured a provision 
convoy. Indeed, the ten Huns left in charge of 
the ration carts, believing that the woods imme- 
diately around them had been thoroughly searched 
by their friends, were utterly taken aback by the 
sudden appearance of a party of men in khaki, and 
surrendered without resistance. Moreover, after 
capture, they had been so terrified by a pantomimic 
display, on the part of Bill, of the gruesome fate
-P-A-G-E-213
  Foiling the German 205 
awaiting them should any one of them venture so 
much as to whisper or move without permission, 
that they crouched silent and still in a huddled 
group, with anxious eyes upon their guards, until 
the issue of a generous ration to them as evening 
came on cheered them somewhat, and reassured 
them as to the intentions of their captors. 
““We must just go on trusting to luck, and do 
the best we can, that’s all about it,” soliloquized 
Roger. 
“Beg pardon, sir?” said the Sergeant enquir- 
ingly. He was lying a few yards behind the 
officer, eyes and ears on the alert. 
“T think we can move again now,” said Roger, 
for twenty minutes had passed and the rear-guard 
had joined up; ‘‘we’ll go ahead along the road 
after Corporal Andrews, and when we have picked 
him up we will double. Sergeant, what’s the report 
about those water-carts?”” 
“Half-full, sir; ration carts about the same. I 
reckon that there’s about enough to keep this party 
going for about two or three days.” 
‘Not enough,” said Roger. ‘‘We shall have 
to pick up some live stock somewhere; but the 
first thing is to get under cover and to hide our 
tracks, so that there will be no fear of discovery. 
What’s that? I can hear someone along the road. 
Halt!” 
It was Bill and his men, who were trotting back 
towards them—a hilarious Bill and some gig- 
gling comrades. The trick which the escort had 
played upon their prisoners had tickled these men
-P-A-G-E-214
ee ee ee ee ee 
2066 Under Haig in Flanders 
immensely, and tickled the main party even more 
when Bill had told the story. 
“It’s too good almost to think about,” he said. 
‘“There was them prisoners, as you might say 
anxious to get quit of us, and there was us escort 
wanting to lose ’em. So we moved down the road 
double quick, and I beats one of ’em with the end 
of a bayonet just to get him going. Then we comes 
to a fork, and I sees that the side road goes down- 
hill into a sort of gully, with village lights about 
a mile off. ‘You ’alt!’ I shouts; and, believe me, 
they’d got used to my words of command, and 
come up sudden and quick, fearing perhaps that 
I'd use me bayonet. Then I says to ’em, I says: 
‘Yer blighters! d’yer see them there lights, down 
below? Then that’s yer objective—h’objective,’ I 
says, and they seemed to know all about it. 
‘You’ve got to move there double quick, and 
me after yer—me and these fellows. You're 
ready?’ I asks ’em. ‘Well, ’op it, quick! For- 
| ward! Double!’” 
} ‘“‘And what then?” asked one of the men, just 
| before Roger gave the word to march again. 
“Ho! What then?” exclaimed Bill, who had 
been eagerly awaiting the question. ‘‘ Believe me, 
they up sticks and gets off like racehorses, and 
| me and the boys after ’em till we’d done a hundred 
yards as good as you’d see at any regimental sports. 
| Then we chaps stops, and they goes on with their 
clumping boots drowning every sound, while we 
creeps back and sprints along the road here till we 
joins you. Listen! you can almost hear their boots

plodding along now. They’ll be dead-beat and 
blown before they get to the village.” 
No doubt it was an excellent joke, and certainly 
one which delighted Roger’s party; but now they 
had their own safety and security to attend to, and 
at once marched off along the road, and, clinging 
to the right, made their way along the side of the 
ridge upon the summit of which the forest grew, 
till they had passed beyond it and had gained the 
open downs. Half an hour later they entered an 
isolated clump of trees on the top of a knoll, from 
which Roger guessed that he would be able to 
survey the whole country, and, plunging into its 
depths, posted sentries and lay down to rest. 
Had they eluded the enemy? Was it likely that 
they would be left in peace there? And, even so, 
how long could they remain? Every man’s heart 
was with his comrades over the line; every man 
wished to return to the British army as soon as cir- 
cumstances would allow him.

  CHAPTER XV 
A Clever Capture 
Two days passed after Roger and his men had 
gained that solitary clump of green forest overlook- 
ing the long ridge to which they had made their 
escape, and during all that time nothing occurred 
to upset their tranquillity or to threaten their safety. 
“Of course, from a height like this,” reflected 
Roger, as he sat on the outskirts of the wood peer- 
ing into the open, with the inevitable Bill beside 
him, ‘‘one can practically see all that the enemy 
are doing; and, incidentally, if we get back to our 
people, what we have seen will be of the utmost 
use. They didn’t take my pocket-book from me, 
by the way, and I’ve been taking sketches and notes 
ever since we got to this ridge. But food’s running 
out, Bill, What we’ve got to fear is, once again, 
not so much the Germans as starvation.” 
“‘Aye—starvation!” agreed Bill. ‘‘And what 
beats me is, how on earth we are to attempt to get 
back to the British. There don’t seem a chance. 
How many miles are they away?” 
“Twenty, perhaps—that’s if we make for the 
Somme, which would be foolish. On the other 
hand, if we strike a little to the north, perhaps, 
208
-P-A-G-E-217
  A Clever Capture 209 
the line is twenty-five miles away. Yes, it’s a 
difficult job, and I haven’t an idea. How’s it to 
be managed?” 
‘‘Aye—how?” repeated Bill, scratching his head. 
*“ How? It’s a conundrum.” 
“You see,” went on Roger, ‘‘there yonder is 
what I take to be Arras, though of course I’m not 
sure; but, if so, the town which is much nearer to 
us, and a little north, is Douai, while the heavy 
smoke much farther to the north may very well be 
hanging over the roofs of the city of Lille, one of 
France’s northern manufacturing towns. If I am 
right, then Bethune lies farther to the west, cutting 
between Lille and Douai.” 
“Bethune,” said Bill, pricking up his ears, ‘‘the 
place where we were billeted months ago, on the 
La Bassée Canal, what runs through our lines and 
on into the Germans’? Hold hard, young feller! 
—Mr. Roger, I mean. What about that canal? 
Supposing we get down into them parts? Suppos- 
ing we was to take to the water?” 
Roger clapped a hand on his shoulder, some- 
what startling the Corporal. ‘‘Water! La Bassée 
Canal, or any other near! I believe it’s the only 
way in which we can do it. If we could fly aero- 
planes and capture an aerodrome we could get over 
easily enough, but that you can rule out as being 
utterly impossiblé. There’s no other way that I 
can think of. The scheme’s worth working out 
and considering. Water? Why not? Only, of 
course, it would be a terribly difficult job to get 
down to the La Bassée Canal without being dis- 
(0 902) 14
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 Under Haig in Flanders 
covered. We should have to go at night; to move 
in the daytime would of a certainty mean capture.” 
That it was an exceedingly difficult task they 
had before them was unquestionable—so difficult, 
in fact, that the more Roger thought about it the 
more portentous did this difficulty become. 
“You see,” he told Bill and the Sergeant, both 
of whom entered into his counsels, ‘‘I’m not saying 
it’s impossible to get across country the twenty-five 
miles which, we will allow, extends between this 
copse and the Vimy Ridge near Arras and between 
La Bassée and ourselves; either of these points are 
within quite reasonable distance. But the country 
is infested with the enemy; they’ve probably emptied 
the villages, and their soldiers will be billeted in 
every house, while nearer the front they will be in 
cellars or in dug-outs. One wants to be a fly to 
get through such a position.” 
“Aye, a fly!” Bill grunted. ‘‘Wish I was one, 
and the whole lot of us, then we’d take on that 
aeroplane scheme, Mr. Roger.” 
“Meanwhile,” said the Sergeant, taking up the 
ball, as it were, and giving it a throw, ‘‘ meanwhile 
we’re stranded here; we've got, you might say, the 
whole of the country within a mile or so all to our- 
selves—lots of view all about, pleasant trees, and a 
breeze that sometimes is precious cold—but there’s 
no food, as you’ve said before, and food we must 
have if we’re to continue living.” 
Yes, the food question had become intensely 
difficult, and as the hours went on, and days passed 
—for a big movement of troops in the neighbour- 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
A Clever Capture aur 
hood prevented Roger and his men from issuing 
from the wood and making an attempt to reach 
the British lines—the food position became actu- 
ally desperate. : 
‘“‘There’s no use in our going on any longer like 
this,” said Roger at a council on the third evening; 
‘we shall be famished by to-morrow evening. I’m 
going out myself to-night, and I’ll take a couple of 
men with me. Better still, we'll send a party out 
on the other side, and see what we can get from the 
railway.” 
When dusk had fallen, three men issued from 
the north side of the wood, while Roger and Bill 
and another man marched out towards the south— 
towards the booming guns which played fitfully 
along the line. 
“You fellows there will make for the railway 
and see what you can do about food,” Roger had 
told the Sergeant, who was to command the other 
party; ‘‘it may happen that you will be lucky and 
be able to break open a truck. Of course, in our 
case there won’t be any such opportunity, and 
what I’m going to do is to see whether we can’t 
pick up some food in a neighbouring village. 
Whatever happens, take care you aren’t followed, 
and of course I needn’t say that if you are cap- 
tured Ru 
“If we’re captured, sir—‘mum’s the word’,” 
said the Sergeant. 
An hour’s trudge took Roger and his two com- 
panions to the outskirts of a village which they had 
seen from their post amongst the trees, but a dog   
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 Under Haig in Flanders 
barked loudly as they approached, and forced them 
to quit the neighbourhood. Then they took to the 
road, and, marching briskly along it, approached 
another village. 
‘‘Seems to me that there’s a convoy on the road 
beneath, probably bivouacking for the night, and 
very likely the men are billeted in the cottages. 
What d’you say, Bill?” asked Roger, as they came 
to a halt on high ground looking down into this 
second village, which lay in a snug little hollow 
with the rays of a crescent moon streaming down 
upon it. 
“Convoy, right enough, sir! Next thing is to 
find out whether they’ve posted sentries. If they 
have, there won’t be much chance of doing any- 
thing,” said Bill; ‘‘if not, you never know, do you? 
We might make off with a pile of food.” 
The three of them crept gingerly along the road 
until they were at the entrance of the village, and, 
venturing still farther along, found that a long 
convoy of wagons had halted in the market-place 
and in the street leading from the east to it. Also, 
thanks to the faint rays the moon cast, they were 
able to perceive the figure of a sentry passing to 
and fro in the market square, though elsewhere 
the convoy was deserted. 
“And they’re motor-wagons,” said Roger—said 
it to himself rather than to his companions. ‘‘ Now 
a motor-wagon will get over the ground in double- 
quick time, and Stop a moment, what’s this 
wagon? Grub of some sort, I should say.” 
Bill pushed his face into the back of the tilted  
-P-A-G-E-221
    A Clever Capture 213 
wagon, cautiously entered, and could be heard 
moving about inside. A minute later he returned 
with a couple of tins in his hand, grinning, almost 
guffawing. 
“What's this you said, sir?” he laughed, stretch- 
ing his hands out. ‘‘Ain’t this grub? Ain’t this 
tinned victuals of some sort or other? Let’s try ’em 
then. It won’t take a moment.” 
‘““Wait a while. If there’s no one in there, it’s 
probable that the driver and the men in charge of 
the wagon have gone to their billet, and once we 
are under the tilt of the wagon we shan’t be ob- 
served. Now then, I’ll show a light, for I’ve got 
my electric torch with me. But, first of all, Bill, 
down the curtain at the back of the wagon, so that 
the beam can’t be seen.” 
Crouching on the floor of the wagon, and screen- 
ing the beam from the electric torch with their 
bodies, Roger caused it to shine upon the two tins 
which Bill had produced, and gave vent to a cry 
of delight. For, though he had been such a short 
time a prisoner, he had yet assisted in the capture 
of so many dug-outs and German fortified places, 
and had captured so many prisoners, that he, like 
all the soldiers fighting on the Somme front, had 
been familiarized with the sort of rations issued to 
the Kaiser’s soldiers. Here, then, before him were 
two tins of vegetables and meat, not unlike the 
Maconochie ration issued to the British troops— 
palatable, and each tin providing an ample meal, 
biscuit and coffee alone being required to make quite 
a feast.
-P-A-G-E-222
    214 Under Haig in Flanders 
‘And the chances are,” he said, as Bill’s strong 
fingers took the opening-key and ripped the cover 
of one of the tins off—‘‘ the chances are that there’ll 
be bread or biscuit, or whatever the Germans have, 
and even coffee or tea in other wagons. What 
I’m wondering about is this: I’m thinking of those 
twenty-five miles we’ve got to cover; now sup- 
posing——” 
Bill stopped in the very act of thrusting a nice 
little wedge of meat in between his strong teeth, 
and glared through the darkness at his leader. 
‘“What was that you was a-wondering about, 
Mr. Roger?” he asked hoarsely. ‘‘ You wasn’t 
thinking, surely, of taking this ’ere machine and 
of running it away towards the front. Jingo!—but 
it’s a fine scheme that! And what’s to prevent us? 
This ’ere show would take the whole twenty-five of 
us easy. You could drive it—I could drive it— 
there’s two or three more of the party that knows 
all about motor-wagons. We'd have grub on 
board—we’d——” 
“Hold on a moment!” Roger warned him. 
‘“‘Sounds rosy enough, I know, but the morning 
will come, Bill, and then what’s to happen? 
There’s twenty-five of us in the wagon, we're in 
a part where we are strangers, there are Germans 
all over the place; someone will be sure to want to 
know why the wagon’s there, what we’re doing, 
and, above all, about the drivers.” 
Bill sat back and put both his hands down on 
the boards to support his weight, for the question 
rather floored him. 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  A Clever Capture 215 
“Ah!” he said. ‘Oh! Y—yes, that’s nasty. 
It begins to look as though we’d better collar 
what stuff we can here, and make back to our 
party; only—don’t you see, Mr. Roger?—in a day 
or two’s time the same position will arise again; 
we shall have to search for food again, and there 
will always be the question of getting back to our 
people. Why shouldn’t we chance it?” 
They ate on in silence, Roger thinking all the 
time, and balancing the pros and cons of such an 
enterprise. 
“It’s bound to be awfully risky,” he told himself; 
“and when one looks at it, remembering what 
things are like behind our own lines, one is bound 
to confess that the venture seems hopeless. But 
we've got to make the attempt somehow and some 
time. This time we’ve been lucky to discover food, 
and on a future occasion we may be equally lucky; 
but the moment may come when we shall be abso- 
lutely starving, and then there may not be such 
a chance, no opportunity to snatch a motor-lorry 
such as this, and the only course left will be to 
hand ourselves over as prisoners. I’m bitten by 
the idea.” 
So was Bill and so was the young fellow who 
accompanied them. ‘‘We both of us vote for try- 
ing it on, Mr. Roger. It’s not more than eight 
o’clock now, and if we could get our boys down 
here by midnight we should still have four hours in 
which to get away; four hours at, say, six miles an 
hour would take us right into the British lines, and 
would certainly take us to close behind the German
-P-A-G-E-224
  
  216 Under Haig in Flanders 
front. You say, what are we going to do with this 
ere wagon? Well, why do we want to hold on to 
it once it’s taken us towards our destination? We 
fills our pockets with grub, Mr. Roger, and says 
good-bye to the motor-lorry.” 
“Done! We'll try it; and, what’s more, we our- 
selves will set the ball rolling,” declared Roger. 
“The first thing we’ll do is to sneak along the 
other wagons and find out what they contain. This 
one seems to have some three or four dozen boxes, 
and before we move we'll just take a look at them. 
Here we are! tins—more tins—each box contains 
two dozen; that’s more than we shall require, and 
so I propose that we fling out the boxes that are 
superfluous. Lend a hand here, and let’s get the 
job done quickly.” 
Working very quietly, but quickly for all that, 
they lifted out of the wagon as many boxes as they 
considered unnecessary, leaving within a supply 
which would provide the whole party, with a wide 
margin, for three or four days, and which at the 
same time left ample space under the tilt of the 
motor-lorry for every man under Roger’s command. 
Then Roger and Bill slunk off along the convoy, 
while the young soldier kept watch upon that single 
sentry. They entered other wagons, feeling their 
way cautiously at first—for it might be that a Ger- 
man driver was sleeping in his wagon—more boldly 
when they found the particular one they were search- 
ing quite empty. Curtains were at once drawn at 
the back, the light switched on, and the contents 
looked over. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
A Clever Capture 217 
In this way, within half an hour. they had con- 
trived to secure several boxes of biscuit, some sau- 
sages of the dried variety so loved by the Germans, 
and a few tins of coffee. With these they returned 
to the motor-lorry at the far end of the convoy, the 
one, in fact, which they had decided to secure for 
their own purposes. 
“The next job,” said Roger, as he stood just at 
the back of the wagon, ‘‘ will be to get the engine 
going without that sentry hearing us. It’s too 
much to hope that it will be so quiet as not to 
attract his attention, and of course the starting up 
of one of the cars at this time of night may very 
well make him suspicious. The question in my 
mind is whether we should creep along and pounce 
upon him.” 
“And that’s what I think,” Bill responded 
promptly. ‘‘It will be the shortest way, and if 
we're careful we shall manage to get him. Let’s 
move, sir; it’s getting late, and if we’re not quick 
we may have to put off this little party till to- 
morrow.” 
Creeping back along the convoy, and getting the 
motor-lorries between themselves and the sentry, it 
was not long before the three had gained the centre 
of the market square, where they lay down under- 
neath one of the vehicles, and for a time watched the 
sentry as he passed to and fro. Not a light was 
to be seen in any of the houses or cottages which 
formed the village, and not a sound came from any 
one of them. But presently, as they watched, a door 
almost opposite opened, and a broad beam of light 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
      218 Under Haig in Flanders 
issued. Then a muffled figure came out, followed 
by a single man who carried a rifle. There was a 
sharp command, given in a low tone of voice, and 
the two marched across to where the sentry was 
standing; then another sharp command. The two 
soldiers faced one another and shouldered rifles; 
then the relief was left to pace to and fro, while the 
man who had been relieved marched back with 
the sergeant who had just posted the new sentry. 
The door opened again, that broad beam of light 
issued, the two figures disappeared, the door 
slammed, and once more the market-place was in 
darkness, and one solitary figure marched to and 
fro as if indeed there had been no change what- 
ever. 
“Um!” ejaculated Roger. ‘‘ That’s rather awk- 
ward; for the fellow yonder will be wide awake at 
the commencement of his tour of duty.” 
“Unless, Mr. Roger,” whispered Bill, ‘‘ unless 
he’s been turned out of a warm bed, and has been 
awakened from a good deep sleep. Seems to me, 
from the early hour that these fellows have turned 
in, that they’ve had a long day, and, if that’s the 
case, that fellow yonder is just as likely to be 
drowsy now as at the end of his turn of sentry. 
What about making a noise here? You and young 
Jimmy Carter lie under the wagon, while I creep 
round behind the sentry; then you knock on the 
wheel and attract his attention, and bring him over 
here to see what’s happening. I'll stand yonder, 
by the door that’s just now shut, and when the 
sentry moves I’ll move up behind him. First 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  A Clever Capture 219 
chance I get, I'll jump on to his back and clap a 
hand over his mouth. How’s that for doing the 
business?” 
They discussed the matter for a few moments in 
low voices, then Bill slipped out, and, crawling 
round the edge of the market-place and keeping 
quite close to the houses, presently gained the door 
for which he was aiming. It was just at that 
moment that that same door was opened, and once 
again a beam of light shot across the market square, 
illuminating the figure of the sentry, and there 
stood in the doorway an officer, with his coat wide 
open, his figure outlined by the light, his head 
bare, his feet in slippers. 
“Ah!” he grumbled; ‘then that fellow’s march- 
ing to and fro as I told him. You never know in 
these days, with these young and raw soldiers; you 
have to keep an eye on them as though they were 
schoolboys. Keep a lively look-out! Because 
you’re miles behind the lines, don’t think there’s 
any the less need for watching.” 
The door banged again, the beam of light was 
cut off abruptly, and for the third time one solitary 
figure was left marching to and fro—the figure of 
a soldier who grumbled. 
“And that’s what we’ve got to expect from the 
likes of him. That’s what we privates in the army 
get, now that our N.C.O.’s are promoted to the 
rank of officer. They say we are treated more 
roughly than ever before, and that’s saying some- 
thing. Need of watching indeed! As if there were 
enemies in these parts! Still, Pll keep moving to  
-P-A-G-E-228
  220 Under Haig in Flanders 
and fro, for you never know when that old spy of 
an officer will be jumping out to watch you.” 
He cast a glance over his shoulder a few moments 
later, and, seeing a figure—the dim outline of a 
figure, it is true—standing in the direction from 
which the voice had recently issued, he went on 
his beat still faster, thinking that the officer who 
had cautioned him had slipped round from the 
back of the house, and was secretly watching his 
movements. Then, hearing sounds from an ad- 
jacent portion of the convoy of motor-lorries, and 
anxious to demonstrate to his superior how wide 
awake and watchful he was, he trudged in that 
direction; nor did he take any notice of the figure 
which followed, though he could hear the man’s 
boots on the pavement of the market square. 
‘““Who’s there?” he demanded, still hearing 
sounds from under one of the motor-lorries. ‘‘Come 
out! It’s forbidden to sleep near the convoy. Come 
out, I say, or I will fetch the sergeant of the guard 
to deal with you.” 
The steps following him came nearer, the figure 
which he imagined to be that of his own officer got 
within two paces of him, and then, just as the 
German soldier was about to turn to appeal to the 
man he thought to be his officer, the latter sprang 
upon his back, seized with one hand the lock of his 
rifle, and clapped the other hand—a broad, sun- 
browned paw—over his mouth. Almost at the 
same moment two figures issued from underneath 
the motor-lorry and fell upon the unfortunate 
fellow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  A Clever Capture 221 
“Now let’s tie him up,” said Roger. ‘Carter, 
slip into that nearest lorry, and see if you can find 
a blanket or something of the sort; a length of rope 
would be better, though we shall want a bit of 
blanket to muzzle this fellow. Now, my friend, in 
case you speak English, let me advise you to keep 
quiet, for we are not inclined to be disturbed by 
your comrades—you understand?” 
No, the man did not understand one word, but 
he could readily comprehend the seriousness of the 
situation. Indeed, far from wishing to give an 
alarm or to shout, and so let his comrades know 
of their danger, he sat on the pavé of the market 
square trembling violently, hoping that nothing 
worse was to befall him. Perhaps a minute later 
the young soldier, whom Roger had sent to search 
for a rope, returned with quite a length of it, and 
with a towel which some German soldier had left 
in the lorry, and with these the trio rapidly trussed 
their man and thrust a gag into his mouth, com- 
pletely silencing him. 
“Now we put him into this motor-wagon,” said 
Roger, ‘‘and then we'll be off. That’s the ticket! 
Lay him down on these floor-boards. Here’s a rag 
or a blanket of some sort; cover him over, so that he 
won't be seen easily. Now let the curtains at the 
back fall to. That’s all right; we'll be off to the 
other motor.” 
They ran along the convoy, and soon reached 
the lorry which they had already selected. Then 
Roger leapt into the driving-seat, while Bill went 
to the starting-handle and swung it vigorously. At 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  222 Under Haig in Flanders 
the fourth attempt the engine fired, when Bill and 
Private Carter leaped up beside our hero. Soon 
afterwards the motor-lorry was halted outside that 
copse of trees which sheltered Roger’s party, and 
perhaps half an hour after that the whole of his 
following had embarked upon the vehicle they had 
captured. 
‘“Couldn’t be better,” said Roger, as he leapt in 
again and engaged his clutch. ‘‘It’s barely ten 
o’clock, I should say, so that we’ve got six hours 
at least of darkness before us. But I must confess 
we are awfully lucky; for if it hadn’t been for the 
moon we should have had to light our lamps, and 
that would most certainly have attracted the atten- 
tion of someone or other. As it is, we can push 
right on bang in the direction of Arras.” 
‘« Bang in the direction of the British lines, sir!” 
gurgled Bill. ‘Jingo! isn’t this a picnic?”
-P-A-G-E-231
  CHAPTER XVI 
Starvation or Surrender 
THERE never was a happier nor more jubilant party 
of men than that which set off with Roger on the 
motor-lorry which he and Bill and their comrade 
had purloined from the Germans. When one con- 
siders their position one is bound to confess that it 
was quite unique—something altogether out of the 
ordinary. 
‘‘Of course there have been lots of fellows cap- 
tured,” said Roger, as the motor-lorry rattled and 
banged its way onwards, groaning as its iron-shod 
wheels fell into ruts and holes, and vibrating to 
the pull of the engine. ‘‘ Fellows have made good 
their escape and have wandered about behind the 
lines of the Germans just as we are doing; and I 
have heard it said, though I cannot vouch for the 
truth of it, that in the beginning of the war—in 
those early days when the right wing of the German 
army advanced on Ypres—quite a number of our 
soldiers were left, as it were, high and dry, and 
took shelter in the woods. There it is supposed 
that they were fed by the French and Belgian inha- 
bitants, and escaped capture for weeks together.” 
‘And isn’t there a tale, sir, of the French doing 
something similar?” asked Bill. 
293 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  
  224 Under Haig in Flanders 
“There’s a rumour. It is said that quite a con- 
siderable force of Frenchmen were cut off some- 
where near the frontier between Belgium and 
Germany, and took to some wooded heights where 
they have ever since waged war with the enemy—a 
sort of guerrilla warfare. But it’s a tall story,” 
laughed Roger, ‘‘quite a tall story. Meanwhile 
our case is different. We've got our own trans- 
port—eh?”’ 
Bill thumped his thigh with his big broad palm, 
and laughed uproariously. ‘‘We have that, sir, 
our own motor-lorry, and—s’welp me!—but there’s 
one thing we’ve forgotten: we’ve thought of food, 
but what about petrol? A motor-lorry won’t run 
for ever unless you stoke it up like an engine, and 
no doubt the Germans have got refilling posts. 
Wonder how our supply aboard this car is? Jingo! 
Hope we haven’t made an error.” 
There were long faces amongst the men—and 
Roger’s was as long as any of them—when, after 
an hour’s run, they stopped the lorry and, getting 
down, carefully inspected their petrol tank. It was 
more than half empty; a stick, thrust in through 
the filling orifice and withdrawn, showed plainly in 
the rays of the moon that the lower third was wet 
and that the depth of petrol was very little. 
“Dishes us!” growled Bill, scratching his head. 
“Puts the stopper on our game! She won’t do 
twenty-five miles to the front line.” 
‘“‘No, but our legs will,” said Roger resolutely, 
‘‘and don’t forget that we’ve already done some of 
the distance. Let’s be thankful for small mercies,
-P-A-G-E-233
  
Starvation or Surrender 225 
Bill, and don’t grumble over trivialities. The 
petrol we’ve got left will take us on for quite an 
hour, by which time we shall have covered perhaps 
twenty miles. Let’s be thankful for that, I say. 
After all, you can’t expect to drive this machine 
right through the German line and back to the 
British. It’s not going to be such a walk-over as 
that, I can tell you.” 
It was hardly likely to be anything approaching 
such an easy affair, for the farther they went—the 
nearer, in fact, they approached the actual German 
front—the more congested did they find the roads 
and villages. Troops en repos filled hamlets and 
towns and villages ten miles behind the lines, and 
sentries, armed and wakeful, challenged the car, 
but as yet passed it through without further inter- 
ference. 
“But the very next village we come to,” said 
Roger, ‘‘the sentry may stop us altogether, and 
then it’s all‘U P’. Let’s stop again for a moment 
and see how the petrol tank looks.” 
“Almost empty,” Bill declared, making the test 
as he had done formerly. ‘‘ Only a few drops left, 
about an inch covering the bottom of the tank. 
She’s done—this old gal! She won’t run much 
more than two or three miles farther.” 
“Then we'll say good-bye to her,” said Roger, 
who during the last hour had been observing his 
surroundings more acutely than before. 
The moon was higher now and gave a better 
light, so that he was able to make out, not alone 
their immediate surroundings, but the contour of 
#0 002)
-P-A-G-E-234
  226 Under Haig in Flanders 
the ground towards which they were running: the 
hills and the dales, and sometimes the villages 
lying amongst them. 
“T’ve been keeping an eye on things generally,” 
he said, ‘‘and it appears to me that up there, where 
the ground rises, there is quite an amount of forest. 
We'll take the first road in that direction, running 
this car along the main road for, say, half a mile, so 
as to throw out anyone who may want to follow us. 
Where the road turns off, all save one of us will 
dismount, shoulder the boxes of food and our rifles, 
and tramp off. Before dawn we ought to be able 
to find some sort of cover.” 
“And after that?” asked Bill, who was always 
of an inquisitive nature. 
“Oh!—After that? Well, let’s get over one 
difficulty,” laughed Roger; ‘‘we shall have plenty 
of them, I can assure you.” 
Driving the motor-lorry on at a steady pace, they 
halted a quarter of an hour later about a mile from 
a big dark splotch which seemed to block the road 
farther on, and which undoubtedly was a village 
of rather large proportions. A narrow lane left the. 
main road at this point and struck off to the right; 
and here every one of the party, save Bill, dis- 
mounted, and, slinging their rifles, shouldered the 
boxes of food and ammunition which they had 
brought with them, and trudged off along the lane. 
Bill then engaged his gears and ran on for half a 
mile, when he abandoned the car beside the road 
and doubled back to join his comrades. 
‘Now on,” said Roger, ‘‘and whatever you do,
-P-A-G-E-235
Starvation or Surrender 227 
make no sound. Don’t talk! If anyone hails us, 
don’t answer.” 
“And if they gets too inquisitive,” asked Bill, 
“what then?” 
“Wait until you get my orders,” said Roger. 
‘* But whatever happens we want to avoid the Ger- 
man, and even the French people, still remaining 
in this part of the country. Not that I imagine 
there are many French peasants left behind, for it 
is said that the Germans have been clearing the 
whole country, and have been sending French and 
Belgian people into Germany to assist in their 
munition factories—deporting them in fact.” 
‘‘Deporting them,” growled Bill. ‘‘ D’you think 
that back in England they realize what that means, 
sir? D’you think in the old country, where there 
ain’t been no invasion, where there’s few houses 
smashed about, and them only by bombs from 
Zeppelins and aeroplanes, that our people in the 
main realize what’s happening over here, and what 
it means to be in the hands of the Germans—just 
helpless prisoners—to be driven out of house and 
home; to have the family divided—the father sent 
here, the mother there, the gals and boys in every 
direction? If that ain’t brutality and outrage, call 
me another!” 
There came growls from the men who heard what 
he was saying; and indeed there was no doubt that 
not alone these soldiers who accompanied Roger, 
but every man along the line, was roused to indig- 
nation when he thought of what was happening. 
Nor could there be any doubt as to the general 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 Under Haig in Flanders 
statement that Germany was deporting the unfor- 
tunate civilians who lived in the country they were 
occupying. 
Tales had come to England, and had been trans- 
mitted over the world, showing how droves of help- 
less men, and wretched women, and boys and girls 
had been herded in trucks and railway carriages, 
and had been sent, the men perhaps into Germany 
to work in the mines or in some munition factory, 
the women to do agricultural work, and the boys 
and girls to assist them; how, in fact, there had 
been a ruthless splitting-up of families, many mem- 
bers of which would never again come together. 
“Trees, right enough,” said Roger, when the 
party had tramped on for an hour and were already 
beginning to ascend. ‘‘ We’re in wooded country, 
which makes it appear as though we should have 
a chance to hide. Now we'll halt for a while, for 
I’m sure those boxes are heavy; then, after ten 
minutes, we’ll push on again, for we can’t afford to 
delay. In perhaps an hour or a little more it will 
be getting light, and by then we most decidedly 
must be under cover.” 
‘When an hour had passed the party had ascended 
to quite a considerable height, and had gained a 
ridge not unlike that other which they had so 
recently left, except that here, though trees grew 
in abundance, there was no huge forest, as there 
had been before, but numerous clumps which 
afforded shelter. The lane itself had kept directly 
on from the main road, passing on three or four 
occasions through the crumbling remains of what 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
        Starvation or Surrender 229 
had once upon a time been tiny hamlets, but 
had been destroyed during the fighting of 1914. 
Now and again a farm could be seen, no doubt 
abandoned, like the hamlets; and, having clam- 
bered to the top of the hill, and sent offshoots 
here and there to farms and hamlets, the lane 
straggled amongst the trees, meandered on across 
a bridge of rotting timber, and finally reached a 
clump of trees wherein were the ruins of a home- 
stead. On it went again into the distance, though 
Roger and his men did not pursue it. 
“‘This is as good a place as we shall find,” said 
Roger, as the men set down their boxes and sat 
upon them for a ten minutes’ rest. ‘‘ Unless the 
Germans make use of it as an observation station, 
which I don’t think likely, for we are still some 
eight miles behind the lines, we shall probably 
have it to ourselves. Now, Bill, you get busy, and 
take one of the men with you. Search the roads 
and see if you can discover some sort of a place 
where we can take shelter. Sergeant, you look 
round and find a well—if there happens to be one, 
as is nearly sure to be the case. Timkins and 
Smith here will go on outpost duty to the far side 
of the wood. Private Campbell will take post under 
cover on the lane here, while Private Bond will 
move off to the right, farther along the lane, and 
keep a watch in that direction. Look lively, Bill, 
for the sooner we get ourselves under cover and 
know where we are to hide, the better it will be for 
all of us.” 
If the men had been depressed by the forced 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
   
   230 += Under Haig in Flanders 
abandonment of their purloined motor-lorry, they 
were now in the highest spirits. They had the 
utmost confidence in Roger, for, during the past 
few days, he had led them without a doubt most 
capably, and his cheery presence inspired them 
wonderfully. More than that, as the light grew 
and the men peered out under cover of the trees 
into the distance, they found a panorama stretched 
before them—a panorama which Roger surveyed 
with the utmost interest, and then explained to 
them. 
‘We've gone farther north than I thought,” he 
told the men. ‘‘It looks to me, indeed, as though 
we'd got on to the main Cambrai-Arras road, and 
that we are now somewhere between Arras and 
Douai. There’s Arras, right there in front. I feel 
sure of it, for you can see the German lines creep- 
ing right up close to it; while to the right, that 
ridge rising from Arras itself, where the River 
Scarpe flows towards Lens, is the famous Ridge of 
Vimy—Vimy which the French so gallantly tried 
to take, and to which the Germans have clung 
persistently. Hum!—it’s a nasty place to try to 
break through. We shall be lucky if we do it, 
though you never know, do you? One can but 
try. Even the impossible is worth attempting 
under certain conditions, and just a little stroke 
of fortune may come our way. Things up to now 
couldn’t have gone better.” 
‘‘There’s as fine a cellar under this ’ere ruin of 
a farm,” said Bill, coming back rather breathless 
after a moment, ‘‘as you could hope to find in a 
   
-P-A-G-E-239
Starvation or Surrender 231 
day’s march. When we’ve done an hour’s work in 
it—fatigue work, sir—and have cleaned it up, it will 
make a billet that you couldn’t beat anywhere in 
Flanders; and I have a notion that, once we’re 
down below, it would want a very inquisitive Ger- 
man to find us.” 
“Then down you go,” commanded Roger; ‘‘we’ll 
post three men on the surface, giving them instruc- 
tions first of all how to make their way to the cellar, 
for of course they must do that under cover, other- 
wise, in case of a surprise visit, they would lead 
the enemy to us. Now, men, up with those boxes, 
and let’s get into our dug-out. Then a meal 
wouldn’t do us any harm; for, after our long drive 
and our tramp, the majority of us must be hungry.” 
They trudged off to the ruins of the farm, carry- 
ing their boxes, and thereafter busied themselves 
in cleaning the place, in drawing water from a 
neighbouring well, over which stood the usual 
windlass and the necessary bucket, and in making 
a fire which should not attract the enemy. 
“Even a wisp of smoke would call the attention 
of one of those curious Huns,” said the Sergeant. 
“« But this won’t make any smoke, sir. Here’s char- 
coal—I found a store of it in what was evidently an 
outhouse, while here’s some sort of a pail which 
will make a splendid fire-box. If we put it just out- 
side the cellar, in a hollow I’ve noticed there, the 
fumes will go out into the open and won’t do us 
any harm, while the heat will boil the water in no 
time, and do any other cooking we’ve a fancy for.” 
It was wonderful how rapidly the party broke up 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  232 Under Haig in Flanders 
into sections; one section making it its business, 
without the order of our hero, to sweep the cellar 
clean, to draw straw from the ruins of a neighbour- 
ing barn, and with that to make a comfortable 
bivouac; while another section set to work to open 
tins of provisions, to secure a pail, somewhat rusty, 
it must be confessed, yet a pail which, scoured 
with sand, was soon sufficiently clean, and in which 
water was soon steaming. Presently the appetizing 
odour of coffee was permeating the air, while, to 
the delight of all, a dozen huge German sausages 
dangled on a stick round the fire-bucket, frizzling 
in the heat, and sending out little puffs of smoke 
which set every one of the men sniffing. 
“They ain’t the sort of thing that’s ever tickled 
my fancy before,” said Bill, as he watched them 
twirling in the heat, ‘‘ but there’s no denying that 
they smell as good as possible. Mayhap they’ll eat 
just as well, and, in any case, men placed as we are 
are not in a position to be too critical. How’s that 
coffee, Sergeant? Smells to me as though it was 
ready to dish out.. Mr. Roger, sir, brealfast’s 
ready!” 
How they enjoyed that first meal in the ruined 
farm, and how those gallant boys entered with zest 
into their new life, and delighted in the strange 
feeling which all possessed at the knowledge that 
they lay absolutely in the heart of the enemy’s 
country! 
They had only to creep out of that cellar amongst 
the trees and lie at full length, and they could watch 
the German lines stretching for miles from the city
-P-A-G-E-241
Starvation or Surrender 233 
of Lens down to considerably south of Arras, al- 
most to the point where the Battle of the Somme 
was still raging. They could hear, the livelong day, 
the hum and boom of guns in Picardy, while every 
now and again the artillery on either side broke out, 
as it were, in fresh places; guns flashed, and smoke 
and shell-bursts could be seen along the line before 
them. 
There were other things also which attracted 
their attention; there were long columns of carts 
and vehicles of every description moving over the 
roads which led to the German front line, and 
numerous columns of troops marching in the same 
direction. Now and again, too, aeroplanes swirled 
overhead, bearing black crosses upon their wings; 
while also, not once, but perhaps a score of times 
during the next three days, British aeroplanes 
swooped into view, sometimes engaging the enemy 
craft, hovering above the German lines, taking 
photographs of them, and refusing to be driven 
off even though many machines were sent up to 
attack them. 
In this way five days passed, and Roger and his 
men had found not a single opportunity of moving. 
By then their provisions had failed; they were once 
more face to face with starvation. 
“It simply comes to this,” said Roger, as they 
held a council of war, and he put the facts before 
his comrades. ‘‘ We have all of us been watching 
the country around. Up here it appears that we 
are perfectly safe from interference, but all round 
us there are enemy troops, and the farther you  
-P-A-G-E-242
Se ee ee ee ee eee 
234 Under Haig in Flanders 
look towards the enemy’s front the more you see of 
them—they are swarming there. Nowhere have I 
seen a loophole through which we could creep. At 
one time I hoped that we might make our way to 
the River Scarpe and float down it. But you can 
see for yourselves that there’s no chance even of 
getting to the river; and now we’ve come to a point 
where our provisions have run out. It seems to 
me that we've either got to surrender, which, per- 
sonally, I don’t propose to do, or we’ve got to start 
making raids upon those convoys you see marching 
hither and thither.” 
‘Raids, sir? And why not?” asked the Sergeant. 
“Those we’ve already made have been successful, 
and another might prove equally so. Only, the one 
thing to be considered is this, that though we’ve 
hoodwinked the Germans in the past, the first raid 
we make in these parts will call their attention to 
us. They’ll search the country, which means that 
as soon as we get the food we’ve got to move on 
to other quarters.” 
“Aye!” agreed Bill; ‘‘move on, that’s sure. But 
other quarters ain’t so easily found. From this 
hill you can take a wide squint all round, and I’d 
like to know whether any one of you has spotted 
another place that looks likely.” 
Heads were shaken all round the circle, for by 
now every one of the party knew the surrounding 
country almost by heart, had peered into its depths, 
had watched its roads, and knew every clump of its 
forest. There remained, therefore, the serious fact 
that to obtain a secure hiding-place they must go  
-P-A-G-E-243
  Starvation or Surrender 235 
farther afield, beyond their range of vision, and 
that was a matter almost impossible. 
“We'll just have to think it out, boys,” said 
Roger. ‘‘Food is again the greatest and most 
important consideration. Let’s get that first of 
all, and then we can bother our heads about the 
other.” 
They went supperless to bed that night, and early 
on the following morning found themselves hungry 
and getting desperate. Determined to put an end 
to their troubles, Roger made plans during the day 
to leave the homestead and make for the nearest 
village, hoping by some stroke of luck to secure 
a further supply of rations. Yet the fates willed 
it otherwise, and, indeed, put a summary end to 
all their troubles. For it appeared that some in- 
quisitive German had noticed on the previous day 
a figure standing out on the hill-side—that of one 
of Roger’s outposts. Peering through his glasses, 
this German officer had detected the colour of khaki 
clothing, and, his curiosity and suspicions aroused 
—for an order had been published amongst the 
German forces informing them of the escape of 
prisoners—he telephoned his information across 
country, and on this particular evening troops con- 
verged upon the hill where Roger and his men 
were hiding, and mounted to the top under the 
cover of darkness. It was just an hour before mid- 
night when a search-light played upon the ruined 
farm, and an officer with a stentorian voice ordered 
Roger and his men to surrender. 
“‘There’s nothing else for it,” said Roger sadly.
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 Under Haig in Flanders 
“Boys, put down your rifles and come out. Above 
all, don’t lose heart, and don’t grumble; for re- 
member that you were made prisoners many days 
ago, and that you’ve had a glorious time while we 
have been in company. There, sir,” he went on, 
as he clambered into the open and advanced towards 
the officer, ‘‘my men surrender. We have left our 
rifles down in the cellar. Do me the favour of finding 
food for my fellows, for we are almost famished.”
-P-A-G-E-245
  
CHAPTER XVII 
Within Sound of the Guns 
Capture, after so many days of freedom under 
such exciting circumstances, was indeed a bitter 
disappointment to Roger Norman and the gallant 
corporal, Bill Andrews, not to mention the other 
brave fellows in their company. It was therefore 
with long faces, yet not altogether despondent,. 
that they marched from the cellar of the ruined 
homestead, and, following Roger, advanced amongst 
the Germans. 
“So!” began the officer who had shouted to 
them tosurrender. ‘‘At last! Tell me all about it.” 
‘‘Not a bad sort, I should say,” thought Roger, 
for the search-light playing upon the group of men 
about him, upon the German soldiers standing 
with rifles at the ready, and upon their officer, 
enabled him to detect the latter’s features. - ‘‘ Per- 
haps he’s one of the good sort; though there seems 
to be precious few of them. Tell you all about it, 
sir?” he answered. 
“Yes!” came the instant demand. ‘‘ Where did 
you come from? How is it that you’ve managed 
to elude us so long? You are the fellows, are you 
287  
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 Under Haig in Flanders 
not, who were proceeding by rail to the Father- 
land?” 
In a few sentences Roger told him how aero- 
plane bombs had shattered the railway convoy, 
how he and his men had slipped away in the dark- 
ness, and then narrated their further adventures 
down to the time of their capture. 
“Hum!” reflected the officer, looking round at 
his captives and smiling upon them. ‘A very 
brilliant little performance, and you’ve my con- 
gratulations. When I was in England—and I 
spent some years there—such a thing would have 
been considered quite impossible. And so you 
managed to capture one of our motor-lorries and 
some food—a smart manceuvre! Well, well, my 
friends, it’s come to an end, and you must face the 
future. Hungry, did you say?” : 
“As hunters,” Roger told him promptly. ‘‘Aw- 
fully hungry! But for lack of food I do not think 
we should have had to surrender. We were mak- 
ing our way to your front in the hope of being able 
to slip through.” 
At that the officer laughed heartily. ‘Slip 
through, indeed!” he said. ‘‘Then indeed you are 
most optimistic individuals. For scarcely a rat 
- could find its way through our lines of defence. 
However, form your men up and we will march 
back. I can promise you a meal as soon as we 
come to our camp.” 
That night the captives spent in a barbed-wire 
cage specially erected behind the German lines for 
the accommodation of prisoners, and there, to their   
-P-A-G-E-247
Within Sound of the Guns 239 
great gratification, they were given food and drink 
in plenty, and slept under canvas. On the follow- 
ing day, bustle in the camp told them plainly 
enough that they were to move on, probably into 
Germany. 
‘We shall be broken up, I expect, and separated,” 
said Roger. ‘That is bad luck, Bill, isn’t it? For 
we've been together so long now that it would have 
been nice to have finished the campaign in com- 
pany. I shall apply for you as my servant though, 
and that may alter matters.” 
An hour later the prisoners were sorted out into 
groups, were carefully inspected, and then were 
marched off to the nearest station. Then for hours 
they travelled on trucks, just as they had done 
before, until they were in the heart of Germany. 
But here and there, where the train halted, groups 
of prisoners were set down and were marched off 
to prison. With one of these groups Roger and 
Bill Andrews went, and presently found themselves 
incarcerated in a fortress. 
‘And here, I suppose, we shall stop and rot till 
the end of the campaign,” grumbled Roger, though 
to be sure he was seldom down-hearted. ‘‘We 
shall have little else to do but to kick our heels 
all day long, and to set our brains working to 
devise a means of escape. Escape, Bill; d’you 
hear that? That's the thing we’ve got to think 
about!” ’ 
“Oh, yes—escape! ’Tain’t easy,” agreed the 
Corporal, scratching his head in the old familiar 
manner. ‘But you never know. We've been  
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 Under Haig in Flanders 
‘lucky in the past, and maybe we shall see a chance 
when it seems most unlikely.” 
Weeks passed in that wretched prison. The 
winter, with its piercing winds and frigid cold, took 
its toll of the unfortunate men incarcerated in the 
fortress. Harsh treatment—for the German is not 
given to leniency towards his prisoner—and meagre 
rations reduced the weight and the health of Roger 
and his comrades. 
“But it is no use worrying about it,” Roger 
said, over and over again; ‘‘and no use being 
idle. For it makes one think about things all the 
more. I’m sticking to the job of learning German, 
and you’d better take lessons with me, too, Bill. 
One of our guards lived in England before the 
war, and has quite a friendly feeling for the British, 
and already he’s taught me quite a lot. Come now, 
settle down to it!” 
What with lessons in German during the morn- 
ing, an hour’s exercise in the yard, and more 
lessons and more exercise after dinner, the days 
slipped by fairly rapidly; yet in spite of work, in 
spite of exercise, the weeks dragged, the months 
went by on leaden wings. But at last the winter 
passed, the weather became less inclement, and 
there was a feeling in the air of spring, which 
would change the landscape. Yet not once had 
an opportunity occurred of making their escape, 
and in spite of themselves Roger and Bill began 
to give up hope, and to wonder whether they would 
ever reach England. 
“Form up the prisoners!” shouted a rough voice
-P-A-G-E-249
    Within Sound of the Guns 241 
one day towards the beginning of March, 1917. 
“Now, let me inspect them.” 
Then a senior officer went along the line of 
prisoners, pointing to this man with his finger, 
to that with his cane, pushing this one aside 
rudely and roughly, and beckoning others to 
advance. 
“You'll do! You'll do! This one’s too weak. 
Ah! this is a good, strong, stout fellow; let him 
join the party. Now, Captain, we'll march these 
men away to the station; give them blankets, for 
they have a long journey before them.” 
“A long journey!” wondered Roger, who had 
been selected to accompany one of the parties, and 
who, thanks to his lessons, could now understand 
German quite easily, and had become a fluent 
speaker. ‘‘ Wonder what new prison we are to 
go to? and what do they want strong and stout 
men for? This is a mystery. Tell me,” he said 
a little while later, while preparations were being 
made for their departure, happening to meet the 
German who had given him lessons, “ tell me, my 
friend, what’s happening?” 
“Happening?” the man answered, looking a 
little uncomfortable, and then peering round to see 
whether he was observed. “Listen, Englishman— 
they are sending you back to the front.” 
“Back to the front!” exclaimed Roger, surprised 
at the announcement. ‘To the front!” 
‘““Yes—to the German front. It’s like this,” 
whispered the guard. ‘‘ We've been fighting now 
for more than two years, and men are getting 
(0.902) 16      
-P-A-G-E-250
  242 Under Haig in Flanders 
scarce in Germany. We want every man we've 
got to hold the front against your British army, 
which folks told us here would never be great— 
never be powerful. But we all know now that 
England adopted conscription. We have learned 
to our cost that the British army is a danger; so 
every man is being pushed up from the lines of 
communication to the front, and every prisoner— 
civil or military—is being made use of either here 
in Germany or behind our front.” 
“Behind your front!” exclaimed Roger, for he 
still did not quite understand the situation. ‘‘ How? 
In what way?” 
“Digging trenches and fortifying the lines to 
prevent the British and French armies breaking 
through, making concrete gun-chambers and dug- 
outs, working like slaves in the earth. Hush! the 
Captain’s coming.” 
The guard, a man almost past military age, for 
otherwise he would not have been employed in the 
fortress, shouldered his rifle and went along his 
beat, while Roger strolled in the opposite direc- 
tion. ‘‘Going to send us up to their front to dig 
trenches! Well, there’s nothing they won’t do, 
these Germans,” he told Bill. ‘Of course the 
thing’s strictly against international rules of war- 
fare, but then Germany has already proved to the 
world that she cares nothing for rules, whether 
international or otherwise. She ruthlessly tore up 
that scrap of paper—the treaty which she herself 
had signed, and in which she declared that Belgium 
should always be independent. - Since then she has
-P-A-G-E-251
Within Sound of the Guns 243 
trodden under her heel many another document to 
which she had set her hand, and now she is going 
still further. In a few days, Bill, we shall hear the 
guns again.” 
“And in a few days, sir,” said Bill, his eyes 
twinkling, ‘‘ we shall be within easy distance of the 
British front. Ain’t that better than being cooped 
up here in this fortress? Won’t it leta man breathe 
easily? Shan’t we see some life? For me it’s a 
change for the good, and I’m not going to be the 
one to grumble about the Germans doing it.” 
They were marched to the railway station, herded 
in some covered trucks, and thereafter travelled 
through long weary hours towards their destina- 
tion. Then they detrained, and were marched to 
a camp within easy distance of the German front, 
and, as Roger had said, within sound of the guns. 
“There’s not much going on yet awhile,” Roger 
reflected the day after their arrival. ‘You can 
hear guns here and there, of course, but until the 
spring actually comes I do not suppose there will 
be any real fighting. Meanwhile we'll keep a 
bright look-out for a chance of escape to our lines.” 
How near that chance was, neither Bill nor Roger, 
nor indeed any of their comrades, nor the Germans 
themselves, could realize, though all who cared to 
think appreciated the fact that once the spring 
came, and with it drier weather, those British forces 
massed beyond the German line, and backed, 
rumour said, by an even greater mass of guns than 
had existed in 1916, would certainly commence an 
offensive. It might be in the neighbourhood of 
 
-P-A-G-E-252

Ypres; it might be on the blood-stained battle-field 
of the Somme again in Picardy; it might even be 
at Neuve Chapelle, or at any other point along the 
line where British troops were stationed. Who 
could have guessed, however, that when the first 
few days of April had passed, that expected British 
offensive should commence directly opposite the 
point where Roger and his friends were working? 
“‘Guns—hundreds of guns!” shouted Roger one 
morning, as he and his working-party, having had 
their breakfast, marched from the dug-out; ‘‘ British 
guns firing in this direction. What's it mean?” 
They stood in the open listening for a while, and 
watching the landscape about them. Perhaps a 
mile to their front was the actual German first line; 
that row of sinuous trenches, wherein, sheltered in 
dug-outs leading from them, sat the German de- 
fenders. The line stretched from Lens to Arras, 
tracing its way through the brown earth and clam- 
bering upward to the heights of Vimy south of Lens, 
and so on to just east of the city of Arras to the 
south. To north and south, as they watched, but 
little was to be noticed; but directly in front, where 
the Ridge of Vimy thrust its way upward, and as it 
were cut off Roger and his friends from the British, 
splotches of flame could be seen upon the ridge, 
puffs of smoke burst here and there in many an 
unexpected position, while there came to their ears 
not only the distant thud of guns, but the nearer 
roar of exploding missiles. 
“Going for Vimy!” said Roger, when the bom- 
bardment had gone on for some hours, and he and
-P-A-G-E-253

his party were resting to take their midday meal. 
‘What if our fellows were to break through? Sup- 
posing in some way or other we could make our 
way forward towards them.” 
‘‘Supposing,” said Bill, as he sat down on the 
step leading into the dug-out, and buried his head 
in his hands. ‘‘And why not?” he asked a little 
later, almost fiercely. ‘‘ Why not, sir? If things 
go on like this, and the shelling gets worse, seems 
to me that the German front line will be almost cut 
off from those behind it. Look at the shells burst- 
ing now far nearer to us. Some of them are going 
over our heads too, and falling on the lines of com- 
munication. A few more of those guns and a few 
more shells will make it hard for the Germans tc 
send up rations to their front line, let alone am- 
munition. Why shouldn’t we get lost? Who's 
going to find us in the midst of such a shelling?” 
Roger clambered to the top of the adjacent hill- 
ock and surveyed the country. Shells were bursting 
on the Ridge of Vimy, sending up huge splotches 
of smoke and flame. Other steel missiles were fall- 
ing on the slope behind the German first line, 
searching for other trenches, for dug-outs, and 
machine-gun positions. _ Huge shells were roaring 
their way toward the dug-out where his party was 
then sheltering. When he turned his head and 
looked behind the hillock, it was to see columns of 
earth spouting close to the roads which led to the 
German front, to see shells bursting in hamlets and 
villages used as German billets, and to watch dull 
banks of cloud arising from almost every quarter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
246 Under Haig in Flanders 
As for the noise, it was becoming more and more 
terrifying. Shells sailed overhead with the sound 
of express trains, or rather with the rattle and roar 
of trams passing along a paved highway. As to 
Germans, hardly a soldier was visible; for the army 
of the Kaiser had taken to its underground shelters 
—its shelters prepared with such immense labour, 
and too often by the sweat of unfortunate prisoners. 
‘We'll do it,” he said, rejoining his men. ‘I 
reckon that there are now probably double as many 
guns firing in this direction as there were this morn- 
ing. The whole place is alive with bursting shells, 
and from that hill up there it was quite impossible 
to detect a single German soldier, let alone a column 
of troops—all have taken to their dug-outs. Let’s 
sit down and consider matters. But first of all 
we'll number the party.” 
“Yes, number the party,” said Bill, who always 
backed Roger. ‘‘Now then, let’s sit down in a 
circle and we’ll soon count numbers. Thirty-two 
of ’em, sir,” he declared a little later. ‘‘ Thirty-two 
of ’em, and you and me makes the number thirty- 
four. Just a nice little gang to put up a fight when 
the time comes.” 
“Thirty-four,” repeated Roger. ‘‘ Now let’s put 
ourselves as it were into the shoes of the Germans. 
What will they do with us?” 
‘“‘ With us, sir?” cried Bill. ‘‘ Let’s see now: its 
time their ration party came up to us, but will it 
move under this shell-fire? Everyone knows they’ve 
got to send up stuff to men holding their front line; 
but will they bother about prisoners?”
-P-A-G-E-255
Within Sound of the Guns 247 
“Yes,” answered Roger promptly; ‘‘not because 
they want to give us our rations, but because it is 
essential that we should be moved from the area of 
fighting. After all, thirty-four men might put up 
quite a little fight, and might prove quite ‘a thorn 
in the flesh’ if left in this forward situation. So it 
seems to me that we’ve got to move as soon as we 
can. We’ve got to get lost, as it were, in these 
German defences. My advice is that, as soon as it 
gets dark, we move out of this dug-out and towards 
the front. Then we shall have to hunt for a dug- 
out which is empty, and if we are lucky enough to 
find it, we shall then be wise if we make prepara- 
tions to sand-bag the entrances, so as to keep out 
the Germans.” 
There came vigorous nods from the men. Some 
who had looked a little downcast smiled, while the 
others were actually laughing uproariously. 
“Just give us half a chance, sir—me and the 
mates here,” cried Bill. ‘‘ Let’s find a quiet little 
sort of a spot where no Germans can come, and 
that’ll protect us from our own shells; then if we 
could get rifles, same as we did before when we 
escaped from that railway convoy! My! won’t we 
help our chaps to come and capture Vimy?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  CHAPTER XVIII 
Vimy 
Ir was dark as Roger and his men slid out of the 
dug-out in which they had been sheltering; yet 
how different was the darkness of this eventful 
night from that of those which had preceded it! 
Then, but for an occasional flare from one of the 
front-line trenches, or a rocket sent up farther along 
the line, the land seemed to have sunk into silence 
and to be deserted; but now—silence? 
Pandemonium had been let loose all along this 
wide front, which ran up the height of Vimy, on 
the far side of which the French had struggled in 
vain, in months gone by, for the capture of the crest. 
The darkness itself was punctuated in a thousand 
places by splotches of flame, by twinkling dots of 
light, by sheets of fire which tore the night, as it 
were, into shreds, and then disappeared, seeming 
to leap to some other adjacent spot. 
“‘Getting warmer,” Roger told himself as he 
led the way across the open. ‘‘Seems to me that 
for a mile behind the front line there is hardly a 
yard that isn’t being plugged with shells, and as 
we go towards it we run into pretty considerable 
danger. Bill, pass the word to the men to look 
148
-P-A-G-E-257
  Vimy 249 
out for some other shelter. Let them spread 
out.” 
‘Spread out, boys!” called Bill a moment later. 
“Hold hands, and let’s walk quietly across country 
like that. No hurrying, or the line will be broken 
by some of you falling into shell-holes, or by one 
‘of us running his head into a shell. There, what 
did I tell you? Take it easy, men, or else you'll 
be asking for annihilation.” 
It was a big word for Bill, but he managed to 
pronounce it splendidly, though by then he was 
lying flat on his face. For indeed their British 
friends over yonder, out of sight behind the Ridge 
of Vimy, had put a sudden end to their exertions. 
They had lengthened their range; and hardly had 
Roger and his party gained 200 yards from the 
shelter they had deserted, when shells came bump- 
ing all round them. 
“And none of ’em duds either,” cried Roger, 
realizing theirdanger. ‘These are big high-explo- 
sives, and if one gets into the middle of us we 
shan’t want to look for shelter afterwards. Let’s 
get back, men—this way.” 
“No, this way, sir,” shouted Bill. ‘‘ You’ve 
lost direction; these ’ere shells falling all round 
have confused you.” 
They held a hurried and somewhat agitated 
council where they stood amongst the shell-holes, 
with steel missiles from the British guns hurtling 
over their heads and plunging all round them. 
Cascades of earth rose on either side, while the 
detonation of these high-explosive shells was ter-
-P-A-G-E-258
  230 Under Haig in Flanders 
rific. What with one thing and another, it was 
not to be wondered at that both Roger and Bill, 
and indeed every one of the men with them, were 
uncertain of their actual position. They had lost 
that excellent dug-out. No one knew which way 
to turn. They were, in fact, in a most serious 
predicament. 
“Then straight on,” shouted Roger. ‘Our 
dug-out was in the third line, I believe, so that 
there’s bound to be a second line in front of us. 
Spread out, men, and walk along quietly. Bill, 
you take the far end of the line, I’ll take the centre, 
and we’ll put another man at the otherend. Steady, 
boys; hurrying won’t help us.” 
“Only one feels inclined to double up like a 
rabbit and run for ever and ever,” grunted Bill, as 
he took his place at the far end of the line. ‘‘ Them 
’ere shells are something to try the temper and the 
courage of anyone. You wouldn’t mind so much 
if they didn’t make such a howling noise, but when 
you hears a couple of dozen express trains bearing 
down on you, why, you feels precious small, eh?” 
“Yes!” his nearest neighbour agreed, readily 
enough, dropping into a shell-hole as one of the 
British guns landed a missile within a few yards of 
him. ‘’Struth! Ifyou wants to know what it’s like 
to feel in a funk, come under a British shelling.” 
No doubt the Germans, lying in their trenches 
in front, crouching in their dug-outs in the various 
lines constructed to oppose the British, and coming 
along the high roads to reinforce their fellows, 
would have agreed readily enough with the last
-P-A-G-E-259
  
Vimy 251 
speaker. For, let it be realized, the years which 
had followed.those earlier months of the war had 
brought about a great change in the circumstances 
and the fortunes of the combatants. 
In 1914 and the earlier portion of 1915, it was 
the British—‘‘ that contemptible little army”, as the 
Kaiser arrogantly called it—which lay so often 
hugging its ill-formed trenches while torrents of 
shells were poured upon it; it was the gallant old 
Regular army which had withstood so often that 
terrible ordeal, had hung on to their posts by sheer 
force of will and dogged courage, and had success- 
fully arrested the advance of the invader. But 
now, in this year 1917, why, the shelling on the 
Somme was as nothing to it. Those British guns 
which had awakened beyond Vimy Ridge, and 
had hinted, as it were, to Roger and his men that 
their friends were about to attempt an offensive, 
had been joined now by a vast number of additional 
batteries. The gun-fire was literally terrific. Heard 
there, before the muzzle of the guns, the sounds 
were nerve-shattering in their intensity. But sound 
does not hurt nor alarm after a while, when one 
becomes used to it. It was those plunging shells 
—those weird, rattling, roaring missiles which flew 
overhead, which plumped here and there and every- 
where into the ground, which penetrated into the 
depths of dug-outs, which burrowed concrete posts, 
and which burst anywhere, everywhere, where most 
and where least expected, with shattering reports, 
upheaving and obliterating the immediate surround- 
ings—that struck terror to the heart. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 Under Haig in Flanders 
, ‘“We can’t stand any more of this,” said Roger 
after a while, when already two of his men had been 
wounded by flying splinters. ‘‘We must make 
for some underground place, even if there are Ger- 
mans in it. Here’s the second line. Come into the 
trenches now. Here’s the entrance to a dug-out.” 
Far down below he could see a twinkling light, 
and half-way down the stair he halted to carry on a 
whispered conversation with Bill. 
“Certainly some soldiers down here,” he said, 
“sheltering just as we want to.” 
“‘ Ah!-sheltering same as we want to,” repeated 
Bill. ‘‘ Well, why should they have what we want 
and ain’t got? What’s to prevent us going in and 
sharing the place with ’em? Only, of course, we’re 
prisoners.” * 
“Are we? Does it look like it?” Roger flashed 
back at him. ‘‘One moment, while I pass up and 
talk to the men. Lads,” he said, ‘‘down below 
there there’s safety to a certain degree, and some 
Germans are enjoying it. Out here you stand the 
chance of being slaughtered by British guns any 
moment. Who is ready to charge down with me 
and capture the fellows down in the dug-out?” 
If it hadn’t been so dark Roger would have seen 
many a head bobbing upward, many a stern face 
seamed with a smile. 
““Who’s ready?” a hoarse voice replied. ‘‘ Me— 
every one of us, sir; only let’s get something with 
which to shock ’em!” 
“ Aye!—let’s!” Bill echoed; ‘‘and then, Mr. 
Roger, we’ll see what we can do with these fellows
-P-A-G-E-261
  Vimy 253 
what’s got the place that we want, and mean to 
have.” 
“Search along the trench in either direction,” 
Roger ordered; ‘‘there’s sure to be trench stores 
of some sort—picks and shovels and so on, and 
perhaps some rifles. Pick up anything you can 
—and quick with it!—yes, quick, for there’s a 
shell landing quite close to us.” 
Earth fell all round them, and even rattled on the 
steps of the dug-out which they had selected, as 
a huge eight-inch shell burst twenty paces away 
with extraordinary violence, shaking the whole 
terrain round, and flinging a spout of brown earth 
upwards. Others, too, were falling almost as near, 
while as Roger waited by the entrance to the dug- 
out he heard a shattering report a little farther 
along the trench line, and, following it, howls of 
terror from the inmates of some dug-out which had 
been wrecked. 
“Sort of thing one would grin at, if one were 
behind the British lines with our shells sailing 
safely overhead,” he thought grimly. ‘‘ But when 
you’re in a place like this, under the shelling of 
your own guns, with eight-inch shells and huge 
bits of metal flying all about, why, it’s a different 
situation. Ah!—there you are, Bill. Now then, 
let’s muster the men, and—one moment, search 
along the trench for another opening.” 
Without great difficulty they came upon a second 
opening, some forty yards along; for, almost invari- 
ably, these German dug-outs have at least two 
means of access, and not infrequently many shafts 
\
-P-A-G-E-262
ee ee eC re 
254 Under Haig in Flanders 
leading vertically from them, acting in normal 
times as ventilators, and in times of stress pro- 
viding a bolt-hole whereby soldiers can descend to 
the depths below, or with equal facility can gain 
the open. 
“‘There’s this ’ere second opening right along 
here,” Bill told Roger, shouting the words in his 
ear, ‘‘and there ain’t a doubt that if we search 
along the top, right over the dug-out, we shall 
find one o’ them bolt-holes. What’s the orders, 
sir? We rush from both ends, eh? and some of 
us falls down from the top and helps to upset 
?em?” 
“Just that!” Roger replied abruptly. ‘‘ Divide 
the party into three, the third group consisting 
of, say, four or five men only. You take one of 
the entrances, while I take this one. Then, when 
I shout, down you go, and we'll attack them to- 
gether.” 
Gathering together at the exits of the dug-outs, 
the two parties clambered down the stairs till they 
reached a point where they were still out of vision 
of the enemy sheltering below, though Roger, 
peeping round the corner, caught a glimpse of a 
number of bunks in which men were reclining, 
and of other figures of Germans seated about the 
place. Meanwhile, five of the men had discovered 
a bolt-hole over the very centre of the dug-out, and 
were already descending by the iron rungs secured 
to its sides. Then suddenly, with a roar, the three 
parties burst in upon the enemy; Roger wielding 
a trench shovel as he led his men, while Bill used 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
  Vimy 255 
the haft of a pick, with which he struck out in all 
directions. Someone fired a weapon, and_ the 
bullet, striking Roger’s shovel, shattered the shaft 
and left him helpless. Then an officer leapt to the 
front with a man beside him. Roger simply dived 
forward, driving hard with his fists, and a moment 
later was at grips with both of them. Over him 
and the two struggling forms his men poured with 
loud shouts, while from the other end of the dug- 
out came Bill, his voice heard above all the uproar. 
Perhaps five minutes later quiet again reigned 
down below, while certain figures were resting in 
the bunks constructed along the side of the dug- 
out. They were the figures of some of Roger’s 
men—for the Germans had vanished. 
“There was nothing else for it,” said Roger, 
when he had recovered his breath and could chat 
with Bill and some of the men. ‘If we’d kept 
them down here, those prisoners of ours would soon 
have had a chance to turn the tables on us, so there 
was nothing else for it but to turn them out and 
send them towards the rear; for to have let them 
pass along their own second line and gain another 
dug-out would have been to warn the Germans 
elsewhere, and to have had them searching for us. 
As it is, the fellows we’ve displaced will have the 
pleasure of crossing the same shell-swept ground 
that we have just left—and may they enjoy it! 
Now, men, let’s search round for food, and let’s 
make up our minds to rest here quietly till morn- 
ing. This bombardment is so hot that I feel sure 
that at dawn the British will come over.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 Under Haig in Flanders 
They spent the hours which followed in sand- 
bagging the entrances of the dug-out, taking 
special precaution to see that the anti-gas curtains 
were in position; for if, indeed, the British were 
about to attack, it was more than likely that they 
would send clouds of gas over the German line 
before advancing. 
“It’s just what Kaiser Bill’s brought on his 
blessed self,” Bill told one of the men unctuously, 
as they adjusted the curtain. ‘‘D’yousee? Neither 
me nor you nor any one of us likes to walk about 
with a gas mask on, like a horse with his nose-bag 
tied about him, and I don’t suppose these here Huns 
exactly enjoy the experience. But they asked for it 
—hey?” 
““Yus,” came the prompt answer, ‘asked for it, 
right enough, Bill. Me and one or two more of the 
boys ’ere was up in the old Second Army—when 
was it? Why, April, 1915, when Fritz first started 
the game of sending poison gas amongst us. Burr! 
Don’t I remember it just, and how it caught us! 
But we was up to the trick precious soon! Got our 
masks to protect us, and now people say that our 
gas is so strong it makes them Huns sit up,” he 
guffawed. ‘It fairly rolls ’em over!” 
‘““Which makes one feel thankful that the Ger- 
mans considered our lives of such value, when 
working behind their front, that they supplied us 
all with masks,” broke in Roger. ‘My advice 
is that every man prepares to don his; for if our 
men attack early in the morning, they are nearly 
sure to come behind a cloud of gas. As Bill says,
-P-A-G-E-265
Vimy 257 
the Kaiser and his barbarous war lords thought 
out and invented this special method of killing 
their enemies wholesale, and now that the Allies 
have learnt to retaliate, and give one better, they 
needn’t grumble. What we’ve got to do is to 
look out for that gas, supposing it comes in the 
morning.” 
“And in the meanwhile we does a doss here!”’. 
laughed Bill, who was in capital spirits. ‘‘Just 
pass a quiet sort of night—dreams of home and 
our comrades yonder.” 
Bill might describe it as having a quiet time, 
and might laughingly refer to the sleep he pro- 
posed to indulge in, but few of the Germans behind 
the Ridge of Vimy contemplated the coming hours 
with equal assurance and pleasure. Not in one 
dug-out alone, but, literally, in thousands of them, 
men cowered. Soldiers of the Kaiser burrowed in 
the farthest corners, and sat there, in the light of 
the electric lamps, shivering, as they listened to the 
detonation of shells, trembling even more violently 
than did the concreted walls of their defences, dying 
often enough with a shudder, as more British shells 
got home and blew to fragments some underground 
burrow. : 
Roger sat the livelong night smoking captured 
German tobacco and occasionally drinking German 
coffee taken in the dug-out, listening to those same 
sounds, wondering often enough whether he and 
his men would survive this dreadful ordeal, for 
ordeal indeed it was. Like his comrades, he had 
experienced a German bombardment during the 
(0902) 17 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  258 Under Haig in Flanders 
Battle of the Somme and elsewhere, and knew what 
it was to have shells tumbling about his ears. But 
this—this British bombardment in the spring of 
1917—was beyond all that had gone before. It was 
terrific—awful! So intense and so nerve-shatter- 
ing that it almost drove men to madness. Sleep! 
The thing was out of the question altogether. A 
pleasant rest! Who could contemplate it? 
Like Roger, all of those men sat listening, wait- 
ing, hoping, and yet fearful of what might happen. 
And so the hours went by, while the bombardment, 
instead of decreasing, became even worse as more 
“heavies” came into action, as more medium 
howitzers took up the refrain, and as hundreds of 
additional steel-throated cannons cast their missiles 
over the ridge. And then, when hours had passed, 
the note changed of a sudden. Those reports— 
punctuating every second, and sometimes over- 
lapping one another, yet for all that distinct, each 
one, though no one could count them—suddenly 
fused together into one mighty roar as drum-fire 
was indulged in. 
“‘They’ll come now,” Roger called to the men. 
“‘That’s our barrage. Keep down here, evéry one 
of you, while I go up and watch to see what’s 
happening.” 
“And while I come with you,” Bill said stoutly. 
“You never know what may happen once you get 
up there into the trench; for if we’re in the German 
second line, it stands to reason that our guns are 
out to crush it. So I'll come up too. Two heads 
is better than one, Mr. Roger, ain’t they?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
      Vimy 259 
They groped their way up the stairway from the 
dug-out, looking strange objects indeed, as they 
were wearing gas helmets; then, creeping into the 
trench, they peered out over the land, which was 
still almost completely hidden in darkness. Yet 
just,a faint streak of dawn was breaking the sky, 
while flashes of shells helped to illumine their 
surroundings. 
“And look at that barrage!” cried Bill, pointing 
over the parapet. ‘‘It’s creeping up over the ridge. 
See it? There, it’s on the very top! It’s splutter- 
ing over the German first line! It’s moving down 
this side! It’s Our chaps must be close on 
after it.. And what’s that? There go the German 
guns opening up their barrage!” 
“Too late to stop our men though,” Roger 
shouted, feeling so excited that he could hardly 
stand still and watch what was happening. ‘‘If 
the attack has started, as I feel sure it has, our men 
would be marching within fifty feet of our barrage. 
The German barrage has gone right over ours; it 
will be playing now on No Man’s Land behind 
the British attacking parties. What a conflagra- 
tion! What a terrific sight! What a Look 
at that! Khaki!” 
“Khaki!” yelled Bill, clambering half-way out 
of the trench in his eagerness. 
For as the moments sped by, and that terrible 
drum-fire which announced the barrage grew louder, 
so also did the light grow in intensity. They could 
see the ridge—could see those snake-like communi- 
cation trenches zigzagging their way up to the   
  
    
-P-A-G-E-268
  260 Under Haig in Flanders 
German front line; could even perceive that line, 
or rather the land through which it had cut, now 
ploughed deep with shell-holes, torn to shreds, 
turned over, flattened out and broken up in the 
most extraordinary and marvellous fashion. But 
the figures there were not those of Germans. Those 
_ hurrying forms, that long, well-spread-out line, 
coming along at a steady pace following the ridge, 
that line was composed of soldiers dressed in khaki 
—of their British comrades. No wonder that Bill 
cheered. No wonder that Roger shouted hoarsely. 
And then the smoke of the barrage came down 
of a sudden and blotted out the scene, while British 
guns, turning their attention from the first line of 
German trenches, began to search the second line 
once more, determined to obliterate it also. 
“Down you go!” said Roger; ‘‘there’s nothing 
to do until our men make good the first line and 
can advance. Perhaps that’ll be to-day, perhaps 
soon, perhaps never.” 
“‘So we’ve to keep a bright eye open—eh, Mr. 
Roger? We'll go ‘down now, as you say, and take 
shelter, but every now and again I’ll pop up to 
see what’s happening. Supposing our chaps don’t 
get much farther forward, supposing some of the 
machine-gun posts the Germans have hold ’em up, 
are we to stick here and see our folks within calling 
distance?” 
Roger could have laughed at Bill’s eagerness— 
at his indignation. ‘‘Steady on!” he said. ‘You 
can trust us to make the most of any opportunity. 
D’you think I’m going to stay down in a dug-out,
-P-A-G-E-269
  Vimy 261 
Bill, and wait, with our fellows so close? No, no! 
Common sense tells us that we should take cover 
for a while, in the hope that our fellows will come 
forward; if not, then we go to them.” 
“We do!” Bill exclaimed with emphasis. 
Yet the necessity never arose, for hardly an hour 
later the commotion and noise overhead lessened, 
and then ceased altogether; while, peeping up over 
the trench, Roger noticed that British shells were 
now falling on the third German line behind them. 
Yet of the British he could not see a sign, for what 
with smoke and mist the battle-field was obscured. 
Hardly, however, had he reached his comrades 
down below in the dug-out when other sounds 
attracted his attention: a machine-gun rattled some- 
where near at hand, and then a voice reached the 
depths of the dug-out as some soldiers stood at one 
of the bolt-holes above and hailed the occupants. 
“Hi, there!” he heard, and the voice was that 
of a Canadian soldier. ‘‘Come out of it, every one 
of you! If you don’t, I’ve got somethin’ here that’Il 
warm you!” 
The something was a bomb which he held 
all ready in his hand, while at each entrance to the 
dug-out, and at the bolt-holes, stood more Canadian 
soldiers with rifles slung, and bombs ready in hand 
to annihilate the men below should they attempt 
resistance. 
“Hold on!” Roger shouted; while Bill, going to 
one of the bolt-holes, bellowed his loudest. 
“We'll come up,” Roger called; ‘don’t shoot, 
and don’t bomb us.”

“One of them Fritzes what speaks English 
better’n you or I do,” laughed one of the men 
above. ‘‘Come out, you sons of guns, and let’s 
see yer! Ho!—it’s you what speaks our lingo—eh? 
Why, what’s this?—khaki?” 
The bayonet dropped to Roger’s chest; a huge 
Canadian stood over him. ‘‘What’s this?” he 
growled; ‘‘a Fritz in best British khaki?” 
“Stop! Wait a minute! Who are you? Why? 
No!—Yes! Really!” 
An officer pushed the soldier aside and stared 
hard at Roger. Then, coming forward, he peered 
into his face, and then clapped a hand on to his 
shoulder. 
«Sullivan, as I live!” he bellowed. ‘‘ D’you re- 
member me? D’you remember that machine-gun 
post that you and I rushed when we were serving 
together—you as a sergeant and I as a lieutenant? 
You were wounded then, Sullivan, and—— Shake 
hands, man, don’t you remember?” 
Roger did. Yet he was so overcome with this 
sudden meeting with old friends, with the return 
of himself and Bill and their comrades to liberty, 
that he could scarcely speak, now that those friends 
were all about him. It was with an effort that he 
steadied his voice, and then with a grip of iron that 
he took the hand of the one who had recognized 
him. 
“Tm glad!” he said. ‘Now let us get rifles 
and ammunition; for I and all of these men here 
are anxious to do our turn against the Germans.”

CHAPTER XIX 
The Might of Britain 
Pass along the line of British trenches as they 
stretch to the north, toward the Belgian sea-coast, 
cutting their devious way through the too often 
waterlogged soil of Flanders. See Lens, imme- 
diately to the north of that Vimy Ridge, which the 
gallant Canadians had captured; Loos, north again 
of the coal city which we have just mentioned, 
where British troops struck so hard a blow against 
the Teuton in 1915. Then note the Messines Ridge 
as it traces northward and so takes us on to Ypres 
and the heights of Langemarck and of St. Julien, 
ground which had long since become the cockpit 
of Europe. 
That blow which the British had struck at Vimy 
was soon followed by others. The Messines Ridge 
was taken in brilliant fashion. St. Julien and 
Langemarck fell to the united efforts of French and 
British, while the lines south and north of Lens 
were pushed forward, pinching that city out as it 
were, and threatening its capture. Even as we 
write it may well have fallen, for the Canadians 
have again gone forward and have taken Hill 70, 
which dominates the city to the north, and are 
pressing toward its centre. 
263
-P-A-G-E-272

Here, there, everywhere along the line in Flanders 
and in France, the Allies—Belgian, British, French, 
Portuguese, and Russian—strike at the invader, 
crush his formidable defences with their overmaster- 
ing gun-fire, and slay his soldiers. The line reels. 
Even though Germany has mustered every avail- 
able man, and has called to her aid every artifice, 
every invention, her armies are put to the test, her 
resources are taxed to make good the losses. 
‘‘And so it goes on,” Roger’s new friends told 
him, when he and Bill had been transferred to a 
corps near Ypres, and were once more working 
with the Tanks. ‘If America don’t hurry up 
she’ll be too late, for everything is going rosily. 
Of course we’ve a big nut to crack, but between 
us we’re making Fritz look foolish.” 
“Yes, and never for one moment leaving him 
alone,” another officer followed. ‘‘If there is no 
big action on there are always raids, and we carry 
’em out now even in daylight. Then there’s the 
Flying Corps.” . 
‘Yes, the Flying Corps,” quoth another. ‘‘Up 
all the time, night and day, swooping and bombing 
behind the enemy lines, smashing his hangars and 
aerodromes, pulling down his flyers, putting out 
his eyes, you might say, and then spotting his 
batteries for our artillery. It’s terrific! They've 
got a new wheeze. Believe me, in our last ‘ push’ 
there they were flying low down, some of ’em, just 
in front of our advancing line, putting machine- 
guns into action against the enemy infantry. It’s 
terrific!”
-P-A-G-E-273
        The Might of Britain 265 
He pulled hard at his pipe, and knocked the ashes 
out with an emphatic bang. Everyone who’ has 
followed the progress of this gigantic war must 
agree that the fighting has become amazing, terrific, 
beyond human endurance almost. Yet more is to 
come. The railways behind the line are groaning 
beneath their weight of shells, the British and 
French and Belgian fronts are seething with men. 
And behind, on the lines of communication, is an 
increasing army of women, driving pens or motor- 
cars, cooking, doing such work as loyal woman 
may do in times of stress, freeing the men for the 
conflict. 
“It just makes yer open yer eyes wide and 
swaller, it does,” asserted Bill as he sat on the end 
of the Tank which Roger now captained. ‘Seems 
to me that durin’ the time that we was prisoners 
things has changed beyond — well, beyond —er 
what’s the name?” 
“Recognition,” suggested Roger. 
“Jest that. To begin with, Mr. Roger, this 
here line behind the front’s so chock-a-block with 
men that you can scarce move. Then there’s things 
that we never dreamed of. Cinemas with the latest 
pictures from Lunnon, and concert parties made 
up of soldiers that goes about making the men 
laugh with their play-acting. And behind, don’t 
yer know, it’s an eye-opener. Gals a-doin’ this, 
gals a-doin’ that; natives a-labourin’ on the roads 
and railways—a swarming heap that all helps to 
keep the show a-goin’.” 
What Bill described in his own fashion was 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
   
266 Under Haig in Flanders 
nothing less than a triumph of organization—a 
British invasion of France and Flanders, though 
a peaceful one, we should hasten to mention. A 
new world had been brought into being, where 
British men and women predominated, and where 
the French civilians had become eager and inter- 
ested onlookers, admiring, as they undoubtedly 
do, the determination and the eagerness of their 
ally. 
‘‘And to-morrow we get off,” said Roger, some 
few days after his new Tank had been handed over 
to him. ‘*To-morrow at dawn. Wonder what new 
adventures will come our way? Hope we shan’t 
drop into a dug-out this time. But, anyway, we’ve 
a Tank that’s far more powerful, and our guns 
should be useful.” 
See that Tank clattering and roaring its way 
through the wrecked houses where the fair village 
of St. Julien once stood. Watch as it heads for 
the enemy line, here broken and disjointed, and 
composed of a series of gun-pits and redoubts. 
“Put her at it,” shouted Roger, as his driver 
turned his head over his shoulder and looked en- 
quiringly at him; for before the grovelling Tank 
there stretched a veritable lake of water. ‘‘Shove 
her through, for I’m going to attack that redoubt 
yonder. It’s holding up this flank of our advance, 
and, so far as I can see, there’s no other way of 
coming at it.” 
‘‘Shove her at it? Yes, sir,” came the answer, 
cut short by the firing of one of the guns the Tank 
carried. 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
      The Might of Britain “ 
“Tt’s that there pill-box that I’m after,” Bill 
shouted, as he peered through the port and indi- 
cated a tilted concrete structure some three hundred 
yards from them. ‘‘There’s a nest of machine- 
gunners in there, and our shells don’t seem to have 
done more’n shake’em. Hooray! That has, though. 
That’s put ’em out of action.” 
As the Tank wormed its way down a slope, 
sprawling in the mud—for continuous rain had 
made a mere of the ground around—Roger peered 
through the gun-port through which Bill had 
pointed. Yes, the last shot had taken effect, for the 
tilted pill-box, as our men call such isolated con- 
crete strong posts, showed a huge gaping hole in its 
side, while a white flag was already flying above it. 
Souse! The Tank wallowed into the lake, send- 
ing a bow wave up before her. Grunting and 
complaining, she wallowed forward, side-slipping 
in the ooze, her propelling chains coated with a 
foot of it, while slime and mud dripped from every 
quarter, 
“She’s a-goin’ ter do it, sir,” cried the driver, 
beaming on our hero. ‘‘If she’d refused, as you 
couldn’t blame her, we should ha’ stuck here and 
been a target. But she knows her job, she does. 
Up yer come, me beauty!” 
“Left!” commanded Roger, as the Tank clam- 
bered out of its bed of ooze and waddled upward 
to higher ground. ‘ Lay us alongside that redoubt 
quickly.” 
Bullets rattling against the steel sides of the Tank 
deafened them now. A grenade, flung by some 
    
-P-A-G-E-276
  268 Under Haig in Flanders 
mechanical contrivance five hundred yards away, 
plumped on to the roof, rolled off and exploded, 
whereat the Tank shook her tail, as it were, in 
dignified manner, snorted, and went onward. Then 
a duel commenced which kept the oncoming British 
troops who witnessed it spellbound. For machine- 
guns poured a storm of bullets from the face of the 
redoubt, while grenades fell like stones in a hail- 
storm. The Tank rocked as if in agony, smoke 
filled the interior till none could see, and breathing 
was difficult. As to the heat, it was almost insup- 
portable, for the Tank carried a full crew, and what 
with the necessity to wear gas masks, the confined 
surroundings, and the natural heat engendered by 
so great exertion, every man was perspiring as he 
had never done before. Then the guns she carried 
spoke. 
“Stop!” commanded Roger. ‘‘This position 
will do for us, for that bank in front gives us some 
shelter while still allowing our guns to work. 
Dismount two of the machine-guns. I'll take ’em 
outside, with volunteers, and enfilade the German 
garrison from the other direction.” 
‘‘Volunteers. That’s me, sir!” shouted Bill. 
“And me!” 
“Stop! You're all volunteers, I can see. You 
three men nearest me will come. Two of you will 
each bring a machine-gun. The third and myself 
will carry the ammunition. Use your discretion, 
Bill, while I’m out. If you have to move position, 
remember that we’re along at the far end of the 
bank.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
        The Might of Britain 269 
Making their preparations hastily, Roger opened 
the narrow steel door and emerged, the men follow- 
ing. Picking up their burdens, they then crept 
along behind the bank, under the lee of which 
the Tank lay sheltering, and, almost immobilized 
by the sticky mud, into which they sank to their 
knees more often than not, slowly and laboriously 
made their way to the left. 
“Stop again! We'll take a breather here,” said 
Roger, for it was hard work they were undertaking. 
“Tm on the look-out for a spot, a break in the 
bank perhaps, where we can set up one of the 
machine-guns and get a clear line of fire right into 
the ports in the redoubt. Our guns will never 
break that concrete. We've got to get direct hits 
on the ports, or smother the men inside with bullets 
sent through ’em.” 
Another ten minutes of strenuous work and such 
a position was reached, a narrow break in the 
sheltering bank being come upon. 
“The very place, eh, sir?” said one of the men, 
setting down his burden. 
“‘Couldn’t be better. Mind that you don’t get 
seen by the enemy. Fritz, no doubt, has most of 
his attention turned upon the Tank, but there will 
be observers. That’s one of our guns in position. 
You two men carry on and make the most of every 
opportunity, while I and Private Harris push ahead 
and look for another place. Don’t open fire till 
you are sure that you are dead on, for unless you 
can silence a port you'll be swamped with return 
fire from the enemy.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
      270 + Under Haig in Flanders 
Not for the first time in the conflicts which had 
raged along the British front had Tank officers 
emerged from the semi-security of their machines 
and dragged machine-guns into the open. After 
all, a Tank may usefully take a small force to within 
striking distance, and then, because of the ground, 
as in this case, be unable unaided to suppress re- 
sistance. Here was a case, in fact, where attack 
from another quarter was required, and the dashing 
Roger instantly adopted the plan we have followed. 
Then came the grinding rattle and roar of his 
machine-guns, while the steel leviathan near at 
hand shuddered under the recoil of her bigger 
armament. Chips of mud-caked concrete flew from 
the German redoubt, while one lucky hit blew in 
a port, joining it with another. The machine- 
guns brought about the greatest havoc. Popping 
up at closer quarters, and from an unexpected point, 
they riddled the interior of a portion of the re- 
doubt, pouring bullets through the ports imme- 
diately in front of them, and sweeping on to others. 
Then, as a door opened and Germans swung out 
and headed toward their own lines, they rattled 
and roared again. 
“‘Flag’s gone up! Place surrenders!” shouted 
one of the men, while the Tank let fly a final shell. 
“And here are the infantry. Let’s join them,” 
called Roger, returning to his first machine-gun 
party. ‘*Put your guns down and take to your 
rifles. When we have secured the fort we can rejoin 
the Tank, and then goon. Here we are. Rush for 
the door. Ah! They’ve closed it from the inside.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
      The Might of Britain a7 
‘Shove a bomb up against it! Men, lie down!” 
commanded a young subaltern who had just ar- 
rived, plodding forward with his men. ‘‘ Blow the 
show in, and then rush ’em. They’ve shoved a 
white flag up, but it don’t say that they all sur 
render. This redoubt has two stories, and those 
above aren’t taken yet.” 
They flung themselves down upon their faces in 
the wet mud, Roger and the others, and waited for 
the explosion of the bomb. Then, as it burst and 
threw the steel-coated door of the redoubt off its 
hinges, they rose to their feet with a yell, and 
poured through the opening into the interior. Men 
met them with bare bayonets. Men thrust and 
lunged at one another. In the twilight of the in- 
terior British and Germans struggled despezately, 
the enemy at bay, fighting for every inch, the 
British with an irresistible rush which carried all 
before it. And so, striking with their bayonets, 
swinging their rifles, heaving bombs before them, 
they fought their way onward, Roger and the sub- 
altern at their head. And finally they won their 
way to the far end. 
“But there’s still the upper story to win,” 
shouted Roger, breathing heavily after his exer- 
tions. ‘Who'll follow? I’m going for it!” 
Who’s following, indeed! Every man pushed 
his way forward. Roger leaped at the stairway— 
a solid construction, for the Germans had spared 
no pains and had grudged no labour—forced labour, 
be it added, the labour of unfortunate slaves—upon 
these concrete defences. A few steps took him to 
    
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 Under Haig in Flanders 
the top, where a steel-coated door, like that on the 
outer wall, obstructed his entrance. But a burly 
soldier came to his aid, wielding a sledge-hammer. 
One, two, three. His blows fell in swift succession, 
and then they were through. 
‘Struth! What's this? I’ve—I’m jiggered!” 
No wonder that the fine fellow who had broken 
the door down was dumbfounded. No wonder that 
Roger, swift on his heels, and the men who followed, 
stood rooted to the spot; for, indeed, the interior of 
the upper story of this redoubt presented a most 
extraordinary appearance. Light filtered freely into 
it through many a port, and through the wide 
gap which that fortunate shell from the Tank had 
created. It showed a huge rectangular place, with 
bare concrete walls and floor, the latter strewn with 
the empty cases of spent ammunition. A broken 
gun lay on its side, and about it the stiff figures of 
two of its crew. Farther along, there were a dozen 
more figures—heaped together in every attitude— 
men who had been struck down by the machine- 
guns which Roger and his men had turned upon 
the place. There were odds and ends of accoutre- 
ments here and there, more bodies of the defenders, 
food scattered about, rifles, and what not. But it 
was not the confusion of the place which drew 
exclamations of amazement from Roger and his 
men. It was not the evidence they had here of the 
losses the Germans were suffering. It was some- 
thing far different indeed. It was, in fact, the 
sight of a desperate encounter being waged be- 
tween two people.

‘“‘Germans—eh! A row. Let’em fight it out.” 
“‘Germans! No, one of ’em’s English.” 
“One of them is a British officer. Come on,” 
shouted. Roger, taking in the whole scene at a 
glance. ‘‘He’s unarmed, while the other fellow’s 
got a bayonet. Rush’em. Separate ’em at once. 
Capture the German.” 
That individual, German without a doubt, foughe 
like a tiger. Flinging off the officer with whom he 
had been engaged, and whom he had desperately 
endeavoured to run through with his weapon, this 
man, square-shouldered and strong, backed into 
a corner of the redoubt, set his, back to the wall, 
and faced the new enemies who assailed him. 
“‘My man! Rush him!” shouted Roger, and at 
once flung himself forward. A deft feint, a swift 
wriggle, and he was behind the point of that 
bayonet. Then out flew Roger’s fist, and in a 
moment he had dropped the German. 
Long before our hero had recovered his breath 
Bill was standing beside him, arms akimbo, 
scrutinizing the man upon whom Roger had so 
recently flung himself. 
“Things gets queerer and queerer,” he told 
Roger at length, scratching his woolly head as 
if vastly puzzled. ‘‘This here chap seems sort of 
to dog your footsteps, Mr. Roger. First he’s in 
Hurslet, your own village, a-wantin’ to knock you 
out, and him the son of a German baker. Then 
he turns up in the British army, British down to 
his brace buttons, and we sees him a hob-nobbing 
with Fritz and his brothers. Then there’s a curtain 
(0902) 18 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  274 Under Haig in Flanders 
drawn over the scene till we tumbles up agin him 
just here, when he’s a soldier of our old friend, Bill 
the Kaiser.” 
“(A spy. See that he’s put in charge of an 
escort. But that isn’t the queerest thing that’s 
happened, Bill,” said Roger—gasped it, in fact. 
“This officer here, look at him. Who do you 
think he is?” 
“Think he is!’ Don’t know him from Adam.” 
Well might Bill have said that, for the officer who 
had been engaged in deadly conflict with the Ger- 
man was almost unrecognizable. For what with 
his exhaustion, his generally dishevelled appear- 
ance, his torn clothing, he was a sorry object indeed, 
unlike the general run of British officers. Yet 
Roger recognized the man, and as the latter re- 
covered his breath and his strength, and began to 
note his surroundings better, he too stared at our 
hero, then started, and finally covered his eyes as 
if he were ashamed. It was Frank Riven, the 
ne’er-do-well, the dandy of Hurslet, he who had 
hired Hillstein to wreak vengeance upon young 
Roger Norman, still hardly more than a boy— 
Riven, the man who had loafed about, leaving 
it to Bill and to Roger and to men of their stamp 
to come forward in their thousands in defence of 
Britain.

CHAPTER XX 
Fight on for Freedom! 
STRANGE things happen in these days of warfare, 
and stranger things had occurred, in the three years 
which had now elapsed since Armageddon opened, 
than this meeting between Roger Norman—Lieu- 
tenant Roger Sullivan as he was known —and 
Lieutenant Frank Riven. ‘Yet, consider the added 
circumstance of this fight in front of St. Julien, 
witnessing the coming together of three men, our 
hero, Frank Riven, and that spy, Hillstein. 
‘« Tt’s—it’s—swob me bob! it’s fair took me breath 
away,” gasped Bill, when he at length understood 
precisely what had happened, and had seen Hill- 
stein put under an escort and marched out of the 
upper story of the captured German redoubt down 
to the basement. ‘‘There’s that scum that’s just 
been marched off, who’d have seen us shot months 
back, and him, too, in khaki at the time. Then this 
here orfficer. Well, it’s a rum ’un!” 
Roger signalled to him, and whispered an order. 
Then he called an officer who happened to be 
present to his side, and again whispered. At once 
all the men who, following Roger, had rushed up 
to the attack moved out of the place, and with 
them the officer. 
15

“Now, shut the door,” commanded Roger. 
“Put your back against it, Bill, Frank Riven,” 
he called, ‘‘we are alone now, and there is no fear 
of interference. We have something to say to one 
another. Come nearer!” 
The man raised his head and presented a troubled 
face, a face no longer sneering, but one expressing 
shame and sorrow. ‘‘Something to say to one 
another,” he said. ‘‘Yes, yes. I—but I’ll come 
nearer.” 
Rising ‘to his feet, he staggered across, the con- 
creted floor and dropped down limply near Roger, 
again burying his face in his hands. Then he 
lifted his head of a sudden and looked beseechingly 
at our hero; while the latter, getting a better view 
of him now, saw with amazement that the officer, 
whose single-handed combat he had interrupted, 
whose life he and the men had, perhaps, saved— 
seeing that Hillstein was armed and Frank was not 
—wore on the breast of his tattered tunic a ribbon, 
a decoration given only to those who have shown 
courage and resource in face of the enemy. And 
knowing Frank of old he marvelled. 
“‘Decorated! He! For bravery!” he wondered. 
“The fellow who played that mean trick on me, who 
set Hillstein and the other rowdy upon me. Im- 
possible! But—but no. This war has done such 
heaps of things, and has changed so many people. 
Tell me,” he demanded abruptly, pointing to the 
decoration; ‘that is yours? You won it in fight- 
ing out here? You have been mentioned in dis- 
patches?”
-P-A-G-E-287
    Fight on for Freedom! 277 
“Thave. Listen to me, Roger. Thanks to you, 
I won that honour out here; whereas, without you, 
I should have sneaked away to some hole or corner 
where I could escape service. It’s you I have to 
thank.” 
“Me! For that decoration! I—I don’t under- 
stand.” 
“But Ido. I could tell yer, Mr. Roger,” burst 
in Bill, who was an eager witness of the scene. 
“‘T know what he means. Speak out, Mr. Riven. 
You’ve got straight folks to deal with here, and 
I’m in the secret. Me and Mr. Roger was pals 
when he was down and out. The time he bolted 
from home, I mean; the time when he thought 
he’d killed a man—the man you'd set on him. 
Yes, you don’t quite like them words. But they’re 
the truth, same as it’s the truth that you wasn’t 
bad right down to the backbone, but only foolish, 
vicious, evil-tempered, and jealous, jest a loafer 
sufferin’ from swelled head, and sufferin’ too, per- 
haps, from the easygoin’ ways of them that brought 
yer up and nussed you. Own up like a man! 
Your conscience got hold of you and tore yer 
badly. You began to feel glad that that Hillstein 
rascal had failed to carry out the job, and, remem- 
berin’ the hammerin’ this here Mr. Roger had 
given yer, yer began to have respect for the chap 
as could beat off two rowdies what had set upon 
him. Yer began to 
“Stop!” commanded Roger, but Frank Riven 
at once interposed. 
“No, no!” he cried. ‘‘Let him go on with the  
-P-A-G-E-288
    278 Under Haig in Flanders 
tale. It’s true—true in every way, and I deserve 
it. Besides, it helps. Let him finish.” 
“And I will, and gettin’ yer leave to do so proves 
that you ain’t bad all through, same as I’ve already 
suggested. Not as it’s for me, a corporal, to lecture 
his officers. But I’m in this here thing. As I’ve 
said, him and me was pals a 
‘“‘Were pals? Say, rather, are pals, Bill,” in- 
terjected Roger. ‘‘Haven’t we been prisoners to- 
gether? Didn’t we go through lots side by side 
before rejoining the British?” 
“Prisoners?” asked Frank Riven vacantly. 
‘Aye, prisoners, and because of you—in a round- 
about fashion,” Bill told him sharply. ‘‘ Listen 
here, while I finish. This here Mr. Roger was 
nigh broke, what with fear and remorse and what 
not, that night when I first met him. But he’s the 
right sort of stuff to push ahead, and he’d learned 
that that fellow Hillstein was living. He made 
good all through, as the Canadians say, got his 
commission, and might be a captain now, but him 
and me run up agin Hillstein. Do yer think that 
chaps same as him forget? He was a spy, and jest 
lured us into the lines of the enemy, him being in 
khaki. There, you’ve got the tale now. It’s because 
Mr. Roger's the right sort, because you wasn’t alto- 
gether bad that you began to forget to hate him; 
and from forgetting you began to grow a bigger 
conscience. You remembered that the country 
wanted every mother’s son of us. He’d gone, the 
fellow you now admired and whom you’d wronged. 
You made up yer mind to follow; to wipe out what  
-P-A-G-E-289
  Fight on for Freedom! — 279 
you’d done on the battle-field; to prove to him, fust 
of all, and then to all the rest in Hurslet, that you 
was good too. Now out with it!” 
Frank Riven rose to his feet, and, striding across 
to gallant Bill Andrews, stood erect before him. 
“You've spoken just what I have thought so 
often, just what I would have liked to say. Will 
you shake hands with me?” 
“Will I? Why, bless me life, ain’t you got 
that there ribbon? Don’t I know that you’re a- 
quivering with shame at this very moment, and 
yet a-tremblin’ with hope. You played a dirty 
game in the old days, Mr. Riven, but you ring 
true now. Shake hands? Proud to!” 
When Frank turned, Roger was standing just 
behind him, hand outstretched, and a smile on his 
face. 
‘With me too, Frank,” he said. ‘‘Let bygones 
be bygones. Tell us all about Hurslet.” 
They chatted on for some while, and then went 
out to join again in the battle, Roger mounting his 
Tank, while Frank went to his own unit. But it 
was a very different Frank Riven now—a happy, 
natural, gay-hearted officer. For had not that 
strange meeting with Roger relieved his mind of 
a load, and had not his conduct since he joined the 
army—tales of which slowly filtered to Roger’s ear 
—retrieved and repaired as it were some of his 
former misdoings? But it was Roger’s forgiveness 
that he wanted most of all; and, after that, if he 
could win in the end some little appreciation, even 
friendship—though that seemed too good to think of  
-P-A-G-E-290
  280 Under Haig in Flanders 
—from the youth whom he had practically hounded 
out of that old English village, then indeed would 
his cup be full. As for the meeting which had just 
taken place, Frank blessed the mishap which had 
caused him to be surrounded and taken prisoner, 
blessed the fact that Hillstein, now fighting with 
the Germans, had recognized him; and from that 
point would have changed nothing of all that had 
happened. 
Think of the excitement in Hurslet village when 
Squire Riven went down with his pretty daughter 
to the Dene to congratulate the Doctor. 
“Of course, you’ve been kind enough to keep us 
informed about Roger all along, and we knew that 
he had won a commission. But he was fighting 
under another name than his own, and that seemed 
to me to be unfair to him and to all of us. But 
there it is. I shall have it framed, eh, my 
dear?” 
Together the three read the announcement in the 
paper, which ran as follows :— 
“Lieutenant Roger Sullivan adopts his own 
name forthwith, and is now entered on the strength 
of the British army as Lieutenant Roger Norman.” 
“But that isn’t all, eh, my dear?” the Squire 
shouted, waving the paper. ‘‘Doctor Norman 
hasn’t seen it, has he? But we have, eh?” 
Pretty Miss Riven acknowledged the fact with’ 
a blush and a smile of pleasure. ‘I knew it 
would be so one day,” she said. ‘‘ And—there 
itis 
“Military Cross. Lieutenant Roger Norman,”
-P-A-G-E-291
  
Fight on for Freedom! 281 
read the Squire. ‘‘ Military Cross, Doctor. And 
what for, eh? Then listen to this. ‘For constant 
dash and courage in face of the enemy, and for the 
most efficient and gallant handling of his Tank. 
This officer recently escaped from the German 
lines, leading a band of British prisoners. He 
then proved himself to be a most resourceful 
officer.’ What of that?” demanded the Squire. 
“Enough, you say. Well, we don’t; do we, my 
dear? Not a bit of it. Look below. Same 
gazette, Doctor. Here we are, for I marked it 
with a pencil: ‘Lieutenant Roger Norman to be 
Captain, dated August 24th’. How’s that? Splen- 
did, eh? Certainly! My dear, you agree without 
a doubt.” 
Everything was splendid, for a little while later 
Mr. Riven heard from Frank, having meanwhile 
had good accounts of him from other officers. 
Now he learned of that strange meeting at the 
front of the front, of the reconciliation, and of 
Frank’s sorrow for what was past, and of his 
enthusiasm for our hero. 
“So it all ends well, Doctor,” he told his old 
friend. ‘‘‘Roger’s done right well, as all of us 
knew he would; and, though he hadn’t anything 
to clear himself of, for he knocked that man down 
in self-defence, yet it’s fine to know that he first 
won a commission and then promotion. As to 
Frank, I’ll admit,” said the Squire ruefully, ‘‘ that 
he was a young scoundrel. A vicious and sneak- 
ing prig and coward. But he’s learned his lesson, 
he’s wined off that score. he’s made good, eh? 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  282 Under Haig in Flanders 
We'll forget the old days and give ’em both a 
great welcome.” 
To all of which the Doctor agreed readily enough, 
while the pretty daughter of the Squire flushed 
warmly, and her eyes glistened. Yet there was 
to be no sight either of Roger or of Frank for 
quite a while, for desperate fighting continued. 
Reeling under the blows British and French troops 
struck at her, Germany was called upon ever to 
protect herself from additional offensive strokes. 
That long line from the North Sea down to the 
Swiss frontier was aflame, now here, now there, 
and then at every point, almost without exception. 
Even as we write, the conflict, fierce elsewhere, 
has of a sudden blazed out anew at Verdun, that 
grave of the German Crown Prince’s reputation, 
of that Teuton braggart who has sent so many 
thousands of his men to their end in front of the 
heights which enclose the Meuse at Verdun. True, 
his cannon have shattered the famous city, have 
wrecked its ancient buildings, have even sent their 
shells thrusting to the depths of the crypt beneath 
the ruined cathedral. But shatter the moral and 
defence of the French those guns never could, nor 
could all the troops Germany threw into this sector. 
Yes, of a truth, Verdun, like Ypres and so many 
other places, has been the grave not alone of a 
puppet’s reputation, but of the reputation for in- 
vincibility of Prussian armies, and of countless 
Prussian soldiers. 
Hold on! Heed not the croakings of the cranks, 
of the pacifists, of those who talk ever and risk 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
    Fight on for Freedom! 283 
nothing by fighting. That revolution in Russia, 
which has seen the deposition of the Tsar and the 
uprising of a Republic, and the following demor- 
alization of the once-conquering Russian armies, 
has given Germany and Austria, her fellow-con- 
spirator, a little further space for breathing. But 
the day is dawning when those Russian hosts will 
again press forward against the common enemy; 
and then, with Italy thrusting as successfully as 
ever—and right gallant work her troops have done 
—with our Salonika and Mesopotamia armies ad- 
vancing, and America, perhaps, shoulder to shoulder 
with her allies on the French front, the dam built 
by the sweat of thousands of hapless slaves—that 
concrete dam, teeming with machine-guns, and 
backed by the last of Germany’s manhood—will 
break asunder. Wait and watch for that breach. 
Let none stand between you and it. Fight on, for 
victory and lasting peace lie beyond it. Only so, 
by the crushing of Germany, can the world return 
to freedom and tranquillity; only by the smashing 
of a system designed to crush the nations, and to 
place might—German might—above the rights of 
the peoples. : 
The village of Hurslet was all astir. The streets 
were lined with country folks in their best attire, 
while a triumphal arch actually obstructed the 
upper end. There stood the Squire and the Doctor, 
with Miss Riven close at hand, while near them 
was a gathering of the more important of the 
villagers. And at length a motor-car hove into
-P-A-G-E-294

sight at the top of the hill, sailed down it, and 
crept toward the arch. 
“Good gracious!” 
“Oh, jingo! How are we to face it?” 
“‘There’s doin’s down there, sir,” said Bill, as 
he turned in the front seat of the car to look at 
Roger and Frank—to note, in fact, the look almost 
of terror which they now presented. ‘Why, 
ain’t you glad? It’s a-goin’ to be a bean-feast. 
Blest if there ain’t a deputation a-waitin’ to meet 
you. Formal welcome, don’t yer know. Smiles 
and any number of congratulations.” 
Roger and Frank merely groaned. To return 
home after so many months of active service, and 
under such different conditions in the case of each, 
was quite an event; but to be met officially as 
it were, to be féted, perhaps to have to make a 
speech—well, it instantly set the two, who had 
faced the severest gun-fire on the French front, in 
a perspiration. 
“‘I—oh hang it!” groaned Roger. ‘‘ Goodness! 
The whole village is there. Go on, you idiot! 
Don’t stop! I—we——” 
The driver of the vehicle didn’t turn a hair, but 
pulled up with nice precision immediately beyond 
the arch, and then smiled on the assembled people. 
As for them, they shouted themselves hoarse; where- 
at Bill grinned his most expressive grin and peered 
slyly at our hero. Roger and Frank meanwhile sat 
petrified, saluting, trying to appear at ease, ready 
to bolt if there happened to arrive an oppor- 
tunity.
-P-A-G-E-295

It was the firm grip of Sergeant Higgins which 
next interrupted the proceedings. 
“No one more glad than I to see you back safe 
and sound, Mr. Roger,” said he, and smiled as he 
made way for the Squire and his pretty daughter. 
“‘Proud to meet you again, Mr. Riven, and con- 
gratulations on the ribbon. A medal means a lot 
to a soldier. A ‘mention’ and a special reward 
don’t come to everyone in the army.” 
How the few short days of that pleasant leave 
flew, and how the people of Hurslet féted the two 
returned warriors! Be sure that they discussed 
the matter threadbare at the ‘‘ Morning Sun”, and 
listened again and again to the lurid pictures which 
Bill painted for them. 
“You can put it down like this, Sergeant Hig- 
gins,” that worthy said, as if finally, on their last 
evening, addressing first mine host, and then the 
assembled company. ‘‘Mr. Roger’s Ar. Mr. 
Riven don't come much behind him. They’ve 
both made good over yonder, and if things go 
well, they’ll return to this place with further hon- 
ours. Then I suppose they’ll settle down—eh?” 
he asked, with a knowing smile, in which the com- 
pany joined instantly. ‘‘Mr. Frank—TI dunno what 
he’ll do. Says, though, that he’ll take on soldiering 
for good; which ain’t wonderful, seeing how he’s 
took to the job like a duck to water. Mr. Roger 
now —ah! there he goes. Ain’t they a proper 
couple!” 
They pressed to the bow-windows of the ‘* Morn- 
ing Sun” and peered curiously, and yet a little slyly, 
   
-P-A-G-E-296
  286 Under Haig in Flanders 
into the street. A stalwart khaki figure was stroll- 
ing up toward the Hall, and on his arm leaned the 
Squire’s daughter. 
“Hum! shouldn’t wonder,” said the Sergeant 
when they were seated again, jerking his head 
significantly toward the window. ‘‘Less unlikely 
things has happened in our time, and Mr. Roger’s 
no bad judge I'll warrant. Friends, don’t let us be 
too curious. But fill up. Here’s my toast, and it 
is a real warm one. Here’s to our two officers! 
Here’s to Mr. Roger and the Lady!” 
The cheer which followed was heard on the con- 
fines of the village, and Roger and his companion 
halted on the hill and looked backward. 
“So it is agreed then, dear,” Roger was saying 
as they turned again and went on arm-in-arm. 
‘After the war we’ll——” 
A second cheer drowned the answer.

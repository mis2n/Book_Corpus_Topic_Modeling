PREFACE 
  With the increasing demand for corrective gymnas- 
tics in the schools as well as in the colleges, it has 
become necessary to stress more and more this 
branch of physical education in the training of instruc- 
tors for this work. Many excellent books have been 
written giving methods of examination, descriptions of 
symptoms, and some directions for the treatment of 
the different types of cases usually found in a cor- 
rective gymnasium. Each of these books, however, 
gives only a few exercises, and each of those, as a rule, 
for one special type of case. 
In my own work, as director of corrective gymnastics 
for girls in the University of Wisconsin, I have felt the 
need of a book which would give exercises for the many 
types that are treated in a corrective gymnasium and 
which could be used both as a textbook and as a 
reference book. It was for this reason that I first 
planned this book. During the months in which I 
have worked over it, I have learned to think not only 
of the students in schools of physical education but 
also of the many instructors who, trained before the 
demand for corrective gymnastics was so universal 
as at present, are now forced to add to their other work 
one or more classes in this subject. 
I have had many letters and visits from graduates, 
not only of the University of Wisconsin, but from other

schools of physical education, who have wanted advice 
as to the best methods of handling corrective work 
with large groups. Many of these have told me of 
the great need of a book in which could be found a 
number and variety of suitable exercises. 
It is to meet these two needs that I offer this book. 
I have tried to describe the exercises as simply as 
possible, so that they may be used for quick reference. 
I have called attention to the errors that are gener- 
ally made in taking them, and have offered suggestions 
as to the method of presenting the exercises in order 
to prevent these errors. 
It has been suggested to me that as my chapters on 
organization are written about classes of girls and as, 
for convenience, I have, in referring to students, used 
the feminine pronoun, | should include in the title of 
this book the words ‘“‘for women and children.” I 
have not thought this advisable for several reasons. 
In the first place some of the methods of organization 
used are the results of my experience in giving correc- 
tive gymnastics to soldiers in France during the late 
war. I have also used these methods in instructing 
men in my normal therapeutic classes, and they have 
assured me that they found them practicable in their 
classesfor men. And, finally, the majority of exercises 
given can be used in the treatment of the conditions 
indicated whether these are found among women or 
men. 
I wish to express my appreciation to my friends at 
the University of Wisconsin for their interest, and for 
the encouragement they have given me during the 
preparation of this book: to Miss Leila Bascom and

CHAPTER I 
   CORRECTIVE, OR THERAPEUTIC, GYMNASTICS AS A PART 
oF PHysIcAL EDUCATION 
Changes in physical education in recent years. 
The addition to courses in physical education of a 
branch termed corrective, or therapeutic, gymnastics 
is of rather recent date, and in many schools corrective 
work has not yet become a required subject. It may 
be considered a new science, which has developed as 
the field of physical education has broadened. It 
results from the realization on the part of instructors 
in physical education of the benefit to be derived from 
properly directed individual exercises. 
Introduction into England of exercises for women. 
The history of the many changes which have taken 
place in physical education, particularly for women, 
is as quaint and interesting as is the history of the 
changes in the style of dress considered correct for 
women in the gymnasium. ‘‘Female Gymnastics” 
was introduced into England in the year 1826 by 
Signor Voarino, an Italian. The book which he wrote 
as an appeal to the ‘‘aristocracy’’ to permit and en- 
courage this form of exercise among the ‘young 
ladies”’ of England, with the arguments which he used, 
is most interesting and amusing to us of this present 
day of strenuous sports and apparatus work for girls.

-P-A-G-E-16
CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  After stating that ‘‘the introduction of gymnastic 
exercises into the system of education will constitute 
a remarkable epoch in the annals of history,’’ he goes 
on to say, “Exercise is universally acknowledged to be 
essential to the preservation of health. It is invari- 
ably recommended by physicians, who in their daily 
practice have occasion to witness the melancholy 
effects of those habits of inaction which so generally 
prevail among the female portion of society, more 
especially in large cities and towns.” 
Voarino’s method. His method, which was devel- 
oped “‘to restore health to persons who have long 
suffered under bodily infirmities, to check incipient 
deformities, and to lay the foundation of health and 
vigor in those who are yet in the earlier stages of 
life,’ has, he says, already been practiced in the most 
“respectable seminaries’ of Great Britain. He de- 
scribes it thus: ‘‘It consists of a regular and gentle 
course of gymnastic exercises, tending to correct 
deviations of the spine, to increase the strength and 
flexibility, and to impart a degree of energy to feeble 
constitutions.” Later he says, ‘‘In the composition 
of my work I have, I hope, paid so strict an attention 
to decorum as to remove the objection of the most 
delicate and fastidious.” 
If one may judge by the two exercises given below, 
he has indeed done so. 
“At the word Attention the pupil must lay the left 
hand on the chest, the thumb and forefinger spread, 
the other three shut; the right arm is first to be 
turned behind the back, then brought forward and 
extended to the height of the shoulder.”
-P-A-G-E-17
  AS A PART OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION 5 
“Standing with arms akimbo, rise to tiptoes then 
gently lower the body, bend the knees and body, and 
extend the arms forward, nails up. Place the elbows 
on the knees and let the whole body weight rest on 
the toes. Then rise with great lightness and return to 
the first position.” 
  STYLE OF WOMAN’S GYMNASIUM SUIT WORN IN ENGLAND IN 1827 
Copies of illustrations in Voarino’s Female Gymnastics. 
Whether the ‘‘Wall Exercise’ is quite so ‘‘deco- 
rous’’ is a question that inspires interested specula- 
tion. Here it is: ‘‘ Face down, on the hands and feet, 
creep up the wall with the feet, keeping the weight 
on the hands. Go up until you can kiss the wall 
between the arms.”
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
Changes in gymnasium dress for women. The 
changes in ‘‘gymnasium dress”’ are no less interesting. 
As pantalettes were the style at the time of Signor 
Voarino’s activities (1827), pantalettes must be worn 
in the gymnasium, the skirt must come down well

to the ankles, and neck and arms must be covered. 
When Signor Voarino tells us that ‘‘it will be abso- 
lutely necessary for the pupil to wear the calisthenic 
dress, as the usual female dress will impede her 
movements,” we are curious as to how she could 
decorously do the ‘‘ Wall Exercise’’ described above.
-P-A-G-E-19
  AS A PART OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION 7 
In the year 1842 came a change in the “‘ gymnasium. 
dress” for women, and another in 1864, neither of 
which seems to us of the twentieth century to have 
produced a dress allowing freedom of movement. And 
even after gymnastics for women had been introduced 
into some schools in the United States, the dress was 
most discreet, and girls engaged 
in active sports only out of 
sight of the ordinary man. But 
as the years passed and the 
world became accustomed to 
the fact that gymnastics were 
as essential for women as for 
men, great changes began to 
take place, not only in the type 
of sports, gymnastics, and gym- 
nasium dress for women, but also 
in the attitude of the world 
_toward public demonstrations 
of theirwork. Possibly the world 
began to see the truth of Signor 
Voarino’s words: ‘‘The advan- 
tages of exercises which have 
hitherto belonged too exclu- woman's cymNasIuM suIT 
sively to gentlemen are of equal, Lae at ee a 
if not superior, importance to 
females, as they impart that elasticity and grace 
which give an indescribable charm to the female form 
and carriage.” 
Value of exercises for women recognized. Certain 
it is that, when physical education for women became 
better known, its value as a means to health was soon

recognized. The exercise provided, causing, as it did, 
improved circulation, better codrdination, quickness 
of movement, improved posture, and many other 
benefits both to mind and body, was of unending

value to those taking part in it. And gradually, as 
gymnasium equipment improved and shower baths 
were added, the instructors began to realize how much 
good could be done through informing the members 
of their classes in matters of general hygiene. This

  CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
instruction came to include lessons in regard to bath- 
ing, sleeping, eating, the importance of fresh air, and 
many other matters pertaining to right living. 
Special corrective classes introduced. At first, 
when these classes were small, individual oversight 
and assistance could be given; but, as the classes 
increased in size, it became more and more difficult 
for the instructor to give close attention to each 
member of the class. To meet this situation, those 
individuals who needed more careful supervision than 
the majority were selected from the groups and formed 
into separate classes. Such special classes were first 
organized to take care of faulty postural conditions, but 
itsoon became apparent that there were many other con- 
ditions which could be benefited by this type of work. 
Corrective exercises should be given by trained 
instructors. Naturally, corrective gymnastics, whether 
for men, women, or children, ought to be in the hands 
of persons trained for that special work. As few 
school systems, however, are either able or willing to 
pay for an instructor in physical education and a 
specialist in corrective gymnastics as well, it has 
become necessary to train all students preparing to 
teach physical education in this special branch of the 
work. In a large school or college an instructor 
should not, of course, be expected to take charge of 
both branches, but a knowledge of corréctive work 
ought to be of use to any instructor in his or her 
general work, for there are many opportunities during 
the hours of sports and gymnastics when a helpful 
word regarding health and posture may be given to 
the students.  
-P-A-G-E-23
AS A PART OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION 11 
  Orthopedic examinations should benefit the person 
examined. The custom of giving individual ortho- 
pedic examinations in schools and _ colleges has 
become almost universal. In some schools, how- 
ever, where such examinations are given, there is no 
follow-up work. This omission does not seem to be 
just to the students nor sensible in any way. Occa- 
sionally a student, or his parents for him, will take 
some beneficial action as a result of the examiner’s 
report, but as a rule neither student nor parents will 
know what to do nor how to do it. Frequently there 
is no realization of the importance of remedial action. 
Why put a student through the form of taking a phy- 
sical examination to find out what defects are present 
if no instruction is thereafter to be given as to how 
these conditions may be improved? The correct 
course is, naturally, to examine the student, tell him 
clearly and fully the exact conditions which are found, 
instruct him in the means whereby such conditions 
can be corrected, and then give him the necessary 
supervision to enable him to do this work as it should 
be done. : 
Heads of schools should consider the physical con- 
dition of students. Surely the condition of the body 
should concern those at the heads of our schools and 
colleges as much as the condition of the mind. Within 
the past few years, owing, no doubt, to what has been 
published concerning the poor physical condition of 
American men as a whole, there has been a great change 
in the general attitude toward corrective gymnastics. 
Very few colleges, however, are taking care of this 
branch of education as they should. Women’s colleges

are perhaps doing more for their students than men’s 
colleges are for theirs. But, after all, should the work 
be left entirely to the colleges? Is it fair to let so 
large a percentage of both men and women grow to 
college age without this instruction? It does not seem 
right that ‘‘ posture classes’’ and ‘‘foot classes’’ should 
be very large even in a large college. As a matter of 
fact, this work of prevention should begin in the 
elementary schools, and continue in the high schools, 
so that when boys and girls go to college they will have 
such knowledge of their bodies and the correct methods 
of using them that they will not have to give time 
to this corrective type of work. As for those who 
never reach college, what physical help will they ever 
get unless corrective gymnastics is offered in the pre- 
paratory schools? 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
    CHAPTER II 
QUALIFICATIONS NECESSARY FOR INSTRUCTORS IN 
CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
In order to be successful in corrective gymnastics, 
an instructor should have certain definite qualifica- 
tions. 
Desire to heal. The first of these qualifications is 
a genuine desire to heal—to help others to reach a 
higher plane of health. In other words, if one is to 
be a helpful instructor, one must have the “doctor 
instinct.’’ There is an old saying that doctors and 
nurses are born, not made. Those who have lived for 
years in training schools for nurses know that this is 
not always true, nor need it be true of those who do 
corrective work. But that there should be a genuine 
interest in the work, an interest strong enough to 
make one put one’s whole heart into it, is essential. 
If. the instructor has this genuine interest in cor- 
rective work, few pleasures that come to her can be 
greater than the knowledge that, through her own 
efforts, she has been.able to help a crippled child to 
walk or to teach a delicate girl such an understanding 
of her body and its care as will enable her to grow 
to a healthy womanhood. 
A cheerful disposition. An instructor in corrective 
gymnastics needs to have a cheerful disposition. 
Among the trials which such an instructor has to 
14
-P-A-G-E-27
  QUALIFICATIONS FOR INSTRUCTORS 15 
meet, especially in a college where gymnasium work 
is required, is the attitude of freshmen assigned to 
her department. Since many of them have had no 
previous instruction as to the condition of their 
bodies, they see no necessity for entering the cor- 
rective classes. Then, too, they are disappointed at 
being cut off from the more active sports which their 
friends are enjoying. Asa consequence, their attitude, 
during the first part of the year, is likely to be an- 
tagonistic toward the work. To meet this attitude 
the instructor must have amiability, courage, and 
patience and be ready to use every means in her 
power to interest and instruct. It is a discouraging 
task to assist a student who does not want to be 
assisted, and who really resents another’s efforts to 
give her assistance; but the instructor should regard 
this difficulty as a challenge to her own power; she 
should not lose patience, but should put forth every 
effort to overcome the pupil’s resentment as quickly 
as possible. This difficulty does not, of course, arise 
in classes where the students have sought correction, 
but it is likely to be found in any group where the 
work is required. 
Patience. There are other reasons for the cultiva- 
tion of patience, in that the instructor must be ready 
to answer questions, to take an equal interest in all 
questions, and be willing to reply on each occasion as 
simply and carefully as if she had not answered the 
same question many times before. She must also be 
ready to repeat instructions again and again, for few 
students can quickly acquire the technique necessary 
to get the best results from an exercise.
-P-A-G-E-28
    16 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
Sympathy. In order to be a good corrective in- 
structor, she must be sympathetic, she must be ready 
to listen to the troubles of others, she must try to see 
the student’s side of a question. Even though she 
herself is healthy and vigorous, she must be ready to 
understand those who are not, and must be very 
patient with those less favored than herself. Not only 
must she know how to use her strength to help the 
less vigorous, but she must, at the same time, be so 
tactful as not to wound the student by emphasizing 
the contrast between the instructor’s vigor and the 
pupil’s weakness. As a matter of course, the instruc- 
tor who is truly sympathetic will also be tactful. 
Courage. A corrective instructor must have cour- 
age to persevere and the power of encouraging others 
to do likewise. Muscles develop slowly, and im- 
provements in conditions of the body appear at times 
almost impossible to obtain. It is only through 
perseverance and courage that the desired end is 
ever reached. 
Correct posture. A corrective instructor must hold 
her own body well. It is not easy to make students 
feel that a good posture is possible or necessary if the 
instructor, who is supposed to know the reasons for 
good posture and the best methods of obtaining it, 
stands before her class with head held forward, droop- 
ing shoulders, and prominent abdomen.” Students are 
quick to see the absurdity in such a situation, and 
such an instructor is in danger of losing their respect 
and thus of failing to get the codperation that is 
necessary to the obtaining of good results in her work 
with them.
-P-A-G-E-29
  QUALIFICATIONS FOR INSTRUCTORS 17 
Personal cleanliness. Corrective work brings the 
instructor into such close personal touch with those 
with whom she works that she must always be clean 
and dainty. The use of strong perfumes and highly 
scented powders is not in good taste for anybody, 
certainly not for anybody who is working closely with 
others. One of the first facts that is taught to pupil 
nurses in hospitals is that they must remember that 
what may be pleasant to themselves may be most dis- 
agreeable to those with whom they work; and the same 
rule holds for instructors in gymnastics. The instruc- 
tor’s gymnasium suit should be clean and neat; her 
hair should be carefully arranged; she should, in every 
respect, present a trim, professional appearance. 
Thorough knowledge of the work. A thorough 
knowledge of corrective work in all its branches is 
necessary. It is the instructor in charge who must 
examine, diagnose, prescribe, and give treatments to 
the students. Her responsibility is great; therefore 
she should not be satisfied with half knowledge nor 
with careless work. Much injury can be done in this 
type of work if it is not correctly conducted. In 
many of the cases with which a teacher works, it is 
especially important that time should not be lost. 
Indeed many of the cases should have been treated 
long before they came to the knowledge of the in- 
structor. Delay will make it still more difficult to 
correct the defects which are found, so that the 
instructor must do her best, not only to prescribe and 
direct the work as it should be done, but to make 
the student herself realize the reasons for a real effort 
on her own part.
-P-A-G-E-30
    18 S CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
Trustworthiness. A corrective instructor must be 
trustworthy. She must remember that the physical 
conditions that she finds and the related facts that 
are told her by the students must be regarded by 
her as matters of confidence just as they would be by 
doctors, nurses, and clergymen. 
Enthusiasm. She must believe in her work and be 
able to carry it on with enthusiasm and to impart 
the same spirit to those with whom she works. She 
must feel a genuine interest in each individual student 
and a real desire to accomplish all that is possible in 
every case. It helps the instructor to do all that is 
set before her, if she keeps reminding herself, when 
working with very many, that the important matter 
to each student is her own condition. If the instructor 
is really to help, all personal and other matters must 
be forgotten. To put it briefly, the instructor must 
put her whole mind upon the student’s needs. 
Eagerness to learn. The instructor must never be 
so satisfied with her own methods that she cannot 
listen to others. Progress in this work is constantly 
being made. A wider knowledge and understanding 
of pathological conditions are being taught, new 
methods are being developed, and discoveries are 
being made. The instructor must continue to study, 
to read, to visit other schools, and to try in every way 
to increase her knowledge and skill. The instructor 
who feels that her knowledge is so great that she 
need no longer study has reached the end of her use- 
fulness and had better drop out and leave the work 
to others.
-P-A-G-E-31
GIVING PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS 25 
to be sure, if all measurements are made by the same 
instructor and time is not a serious consideration, 
they may possibly be of interest to the student in 
noting improvement. But it must be borne in mind 
that measurements taken by different instructors will 
vary decidedly, even when taken upon the same day. 
If such measurements taken at the time of entrance 
are to be of interest to the student, they should be 
repeated at intervals during the student’s stay in 
the school. A knowledge of height and weight, lung 
capacity (tested with a spirometer), history of previ- 
ous work in sports and gymnastics, results of examina- 
tions for general condition and for bad orthopedic 
conditions of the feet and spine, together with the 
physician’s report as to cardiac and thyroid conditions 
and of recent operations and illnesses, should give a 
sufficient understanding of the student’s physical con- 
dition to enable the instructor to assign her to her 
class. 
Assignment to gymnasium classes should be made 
by the instructor in charge of the orthopedic depart- 
ment. In making this assignment, the student’s 
health, her posture, and the presence of any ortho- 
pedic deformity should be the determining factors. 
Both gymnastics and sports should be so planned as 
to give each student work which is adapted to her 
strength and condition. The gymnasium work may 
be divided into regular work for those able to take 
apparatus work and heavy gymnastics, light gymnas- 
tics for those not able to take strenuous exercises but 
not needing special or corrective work, and special 
gymnastics for those whose condition can be improved 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
    26 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
by prescribed and directed exercises. In sports, the 
same division into heavy, light, and medium sports 
may be made. 
Method of making the orthopedic examination. 
As the object of the physical examination is to enable 
the instructor to give the student the work which will 
be most beneficial for her, it is expedient that the 
student should understand each step in the examina- 
tion and be able to see for herself the physical condi- 
tions which the instructor finds. With this end in view 
the following method has been found satisfactory: 
The first step consists in taking a drawing of the 
student with the schematograph; then her weight and 
lung capacity are tested. Finally, bringing these rec- 
ords with her, the student goes to the instructor who 
is to give the orthopedic examination. For this, the 
student stands between two mirrors so placed that, by 
looking into one, she can see her back in the other. 
As the examination of her back, shoulders, hips, and 
general condition is made, each step is explained to 
her. She has pointed out to her the hollow in her 
back, the forward position of her head, or any condi- 
tion of posture which is not correct. She is asked to 
try to correct these conditions herself; that is, to 
stand in her ‘‘best position.’’ This she does in front 
of the mirror, so that she can see for herself whether 
or not her posture is improved. She is then shown

of physical education, but are in need of regular 
rest or outdoor exercise. 
We feel that this department is, in many cases, a 
real help to the students; many girls, especially those 
working hard with their studies, do not take as much 
rest as they should. But when the physical education 
department gives them credit for the hours of rest 
which they take under the corrective department, 
they are able to take that rest with a quiet mind. 
They do not feel that they are shirking their studies 
because they lie down during the day. Many of the 
students express appreciation for the permission that 
is given them to rest in this way. 
In order to get credit for rest the student is required 
to come to the rest room of the physical education 
department and each time to sign her name in a book 
which is kept for that purpose in the office. The 
hour of her rest is assigned to her, and she is expected 
to report at that hour. Such a rest room should, of 
course, be kept under supervision. The rest privilege 
is undoubtedly abused at times, and there are always 
students who fail to rest as they should; but that this 
scheme is a necessary part of a physical education 
department where work is required is unquestionably 
true. Nor does it seem right that the good of the 
many should be sacrificed because of a lack of honor 
on the part of a few. 
Those students who walk for credit are selected by 
the medical clinic. This walking, which is always for 
a definite length of time, should be done in groups 
headed by an instructor or by a student who is ap- 
pointed for that purpose. The length of such walks  
-P-A-G-E-34
32 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
should depend upon the strength of the students in 
each particular group, shorter walks being arranged for 
those students who are not able to take long hikes. A 
roll should, of course, be taken each time, and records 
of the attendance should be kept. 
Sometimes a combination of rest and walking may 
be made, the student taking two hours of rest and two 
of walking, or, on stormy days, giving the entire time 
to rest.

  Group corrective work. Giving corrective exer- 
cises in large classes may seem to some persons quite 
impracticable, for ‘corrective exercise’? and ‘‘indi- 
vidual exercise’ are considered synonymous terms. 
In small schools and in the gymnasiums of orthopedic 
surgeons, they are one and the same thing. But in 
large schools and universities where gymnasium work 
is required and the number of students to be instructed 
is large, class corrective work becornes an absolute 
necessity. 
Size of ideal class. Ideally, a corrective class 
that is to be taught by one instructor has an enroll- 
ment of about eight students. In a class of this size 
the instructor can, during the class period, come in 
touch with every girl; in such a class, therefore, indi- 
vidual exercises can be given. In most large schools, 
however, the number enrolled in a single class must 
be much greater than this, and the usual class period of 
one-half hour is so quickly over that, no matter how 
willing and industrious the instructor may be, she 
will find at the end of the period that she has been 
able to give instruction to only a few in the class and 
that there are many to whom she has not had oppor- 
tunity even to speak. 
33 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
34 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  Work in class should be individual. In classes of 
this type each student should be made to feel that 
the instructor has a personal interest in her, under- 
stands her particular condition, is ready ard willing 
to explain to her individually the object of the exer- 
cises which she has been told to take, and to answer 
any questions concerning the student’s condition and 
her hope of correcting it. Without this personal 
touch the student usually takes little interest in her 
work. She must understand before she can be inter- 
ested, and unless she can be made to take an intelli- 
gent interest, practically nothing is accomplished. 
Benefit to be derived from class work. When the 
period begins with a general class exercise the stu- 
dents all stand before the instructor, who can thus 
observe their individual posture. While moving about 
the class later she can speak to the girls individually, 
answer their questions, and in a low voice give them 
personal instructions and suggestions. 
Many of the exercises, particularly those given to 
improve posture, are taken by all of the corrective 
group and when used for class exercises are taught to 
large numbers of students at once. At the beginning 
of the semester’s. work, it is well to select girls who 
are to use the same exercise, and to explain to them 
in a group its purpose and the correct method of 
doing it. These group exercises are given in addition 
to the class exercises, which occur at the opening of 
the class hour. j 
Ideal class of one type only. The ideal correc- 
tive class should have in it only students having the 
same types of conditions to be treated; then the work
-P-A-G-E-37
   IN CLASSES AND WITH INDIVIDUALS 35 
of prescribing and giving exercises would be quite sim- 
ple. But the classes which must be instructed are 
often composed of students in all sorts of condition — 
strong, healthy girls who have poor posture or pro- 
nated feet, girls who have menstrual disorders, active 
thyroids, weak hearts, or knees which become easily 
dislocated, and girls with other conditions needing 
correction. With classes of this type the work is much 
more difficult. The first exercises must be those in 
which all can safely join, for at first the girls who are 
not quite strong, or who have some peculiarity, are 
sensitive about being told to drop out of an exercise. 
Later, as a girl becomes accustomed to the work and 
to the instructor, she learns to stop when she becomes 
fatigued or if the exercise proves to be one which is 
not just suited to her special condition. 
Exercises should be demonstrated. Each exer- 
cise should be carefully explained to the class. Stress 
should be laid on the results to be expected, and why 
and how this particular exercise is to give these results. 
Then the correct method of executing it should be 
demonstrated two or three times before the class, the 
instructor standing in turn before different sections of 
the class so that all may see the demonstration. The 
exercise should next be given slowly and the orders 
given in an informal, explanatory way. All corrective 
exercises should be given slowly. Each girl should be 
made to understand that she is working, not for snap 
or form, but to develop a certain set of muscles in her 
own body. She should aim to achieve results for her 
own benefit; hence, good posture should never be 
sacrificed for the sake of the exercise.       
    
  
-P-A-G-E-38
       
   CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS    36 
One characteristic which is noticeable in a class of 
the type just described is a lack of coérdination and 
muscle control. In spite of the fact that each exercise 
has been carefully explained and demonstrated and 
has then been given very slowly so that each student 
may have time to think as she works, at least a third 
of the class are likely to fail to execute it correctly. 
For this reason the demonstrations must be repeated 
and the errors made must be pointed out again and 
again. 
Foot exercises given under supervision. Foot ex- 
ercises, until they are thoroughly learned, should be 
taken under supervision; for if they are to be of any 
benefit they must be done with exact technique. Most 
students find them difficult. While doing these exer- 
cises the girls should be required to remove their 
shoes; and when demonstrating, the instructor should 
remove hers. 
Each student should have her own card of exercises. 
After the class exercises are completed each student 
should be given a card of exercises which has been 
prepared to suit her individual case, and she is ex- 
pected to go on with her work regardless of what others 
in the gymnasium are doing. Each student should be 
permitted to see her diagnosis card and should have 
her condition explained to her. Any questions which 
she asks should be answered, even if these questions 
take her into the fields of anatomy, orthopedics, and 
medicine; and every effort must be expended to make 
her take an intelligent interest in her own condition 
and the means which are being used to improve it. 
Individual demonstration and instruction must be

  given, and the student should be watched as she goes 
through her schedule to be sure that she understands 
each exercise and can execute it correctly. With large 
classes this supervision is most difficult, and the girls 
themselves sometimes make it even more difficult by 
their apparent reluctance to ask questions. Many 
will go blindly on, doing their work in a listless man- 
ner, with no clear idea of the object of the exercises, 
and no interest in them because they do not under- 
stand what they are doing. These students can, as a 
rule, be picked out by the instructor because of the 
way they do their work; and frequently, after they 
have received personal instruction and explanation, 
their whole manner will change. Many times such a 
student is heard to say, ‘‘Why, I had no idea that 
there was so much in corrective exercises! I think it 
is much more interesting than regular gymnastics, for 
here you are working for a purpose and not just to 
exercise.” 
Keeping in touch with each student. Frequently 
the size of the class makes it practically impossible for 
a student to get an opportunity to speak to the in- 
structor, since there are so many girls trying to do this 
same thing. A student may thus drift along from 
day to day, wishing to ask questions personal to her- 
self, and not finding her opportunity. To meet this 
situation, it is wise to ask, just before dismissing the 
girls after the general class exercises, if there are any 
who do not understand their work or who would like 
to speak personally to the instructor. Even then 
there are some who will hesitate to speak. To reach 
these, the following has been found a good plan:
-P-A-G-E-41
IN CLASSES AND WITH INDIVIDUALS 39 
  Each girl has her own card of exercises which she 
keeps in her locker and brings with her when she 
comes to class. If she wishes to speak to the instruc- 
tor, either to ask for assistance or explanations, if she 
would like an exercise to correct some condition which 
she feels should be corrected, if an exercise gives her 
pain, if she does not think that she is improving, or if 
she has any other reason for wishing to communicate 
with the instructor, she may make a note of the fact 
on her exercise card and slip it into a large envelope 
on the desk in the gymnasium. This envelope should 
be examined after each class. If a note in answer is 
all that is necessary, this is written on the card, and 
the student receives it when she next comes to class. 
If a personal interview is best, that is given her on 
the next class day. 
Sometimes there will be a student who, in spite of 
all that can be said or done in class, does not become 
interested and works only enough to keep her from 
being conspicuous. In the department in which the 
author has been working a girl of this type is called 
into the office in order to try to find out from her the 
reason for her lack of interest. At this time we put 
before her clearly her own condition and show her 
by books and photographs the more serious conditions 
which are likely to follow if she makes no effort to 
correct her body. We tell her of the work of the 
many men and women who are devoting their time 
and energy to helping others to prevent and cure these 
very conditions. We try to make her feel that this 
work is not a fad that has originated in our brains, 
but a science which has been developed through the 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
   
       40 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  efforts of some of the cleverest men and women in the 
world. At the end of the interview the matter is left 
entirely in the hands of the girl, and she is plainly told 
that she may stay in the class or not as she herself 
decides, but that, if she does stay, she will have to 
change her attitude and habits of work — that we do 
not care to have her in the class unless she does. We 
have never yet had to transfer a girl from the cor- 
rective department after an interview of this kind. 
On the contrary, these girls have almost invariably 
gone into the work afterward with their whole hearts, 
not only doing good work themselves, but also helping 
other students to see the importance of improving 
their posture and health by corrective exercises. 
Exercise instructions provided. When classes are 
small it is possible to write out the exercises on each 
card, but when classes are large it is impossible to do 
so. The following plan for large classes is therefore 
suggested: All exercises are written out plainly and 
simply, with explanations of technical terms; and a 
sufficient number of mimeographed copies are made 
to provide one for each student in the class. The 
exercises are grouped according to their purposes, and 
these groups are numbered as are also the exercises 
included in each group. Then a girl’s prescription of 
exercises, indicated by number, is written on her diag- 
nosis card. So that the diagnosis card may not be 
lost, each student copies the numbers of the exercises 
which she is to take, keeping this copy and bringing it 
to class each day, while the original card is filed. 
Until the student can remember how to do her 
exercises she keeps the mimeographed instruction 
 
-P-A-G-E-43

-P-A-G-E-44
  42 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
with her during her work, returning it to the instruc- 
tor’s desk before leaving the classroom. 
Work should be educational. When the class 
work first begins it is explanatory and theoretical. 
The few exercises which are given are for the purpose 
of demonstration, so that the student may test for 
herself the truth of what is being told her. The 
student should understand and believe the necessity 
for the work in her own case — her reason should 
assure her that the theories and methods presented 
are correct. On the first day, the students may sit 
while the requirements of dress and attendance, the 
diagnosis cards, the purpose of the mimeographed 
exercises, and the means which in large classes they 
must use to communicate with instructors, are ex- 
plained to them. They must be told never to do an 
exercise which strains or hurts them, but to omit it 
until they have talked it over with the instructor. 
They must be urged to codperate by asking questions 
either in class or privately; they must understand the 
wish and endeavor of their instructors to make the 
exercises suit each case exactly, and must be urged to 
state if there is some physical condition needing atten- 
tion which is not taken care of in their list of exercises. 
Teaching correct posture. On the second day the 
posture work may be begun. On this day the class 
is lined up before the instructor, all the students wear- 
ing their gymnasium suits. Beginning with the feet, 
each step of the correction necessary to bring the body 
into good position is explained. The reasons for the 
straight foot are explained and demonstrated. The 
bones of a foot and leg are shown, and there is a

  44 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
demonstration of the effect upon the foot of turning 
the toes out, the instructor removing her shoes in order 
to show this more clearly. From the feet the instructor 
goes over the rest of the body, dwelling on the position 
of the knees, the position of the pelvis and its effect 
upon the lumbar region, and the position of the neck. 
A skeleton is used during these lessons, so that the 
student may understand why the tilt of the pelvis 
affects the lumbar region, or why the position of the 
neck and head affects chest and abdomen. Outline 
charts of different postures A, B, C, and D, are 
shown, with the effects of these postures upon the 
muscles, organs, circulation, and general condition of 
the body. The student is then ready to try upon 
herself the effect of different positions. In order to 
make her realize that she cannot stand with her body 
straight and her toes turned out, she is asked to stand 
correctly, with her feet straight ahead, and weight for- 
ward, then to stiffen and hold her body in that posi- 
tion, and with weight still forward, turn her toes out. 
She is told to lock her knees strongly back, so that 
she may feel for herself the strain upon her legs and 
back which this position gives her. She is told to 
drop her neck forward and then lift it to correct posi- 
tion, in order that she may feel for herself the effect 
upon her chest and abdomen. 
Beginning the exercise. After the students have 
been taught what is meant by correct posture and 
what changes must take place in their own bodies to 
obtain this posture, the exercises may be begun. The 
first exercise taught is Exercise I, Chapter VIII. As 
the first part of this has been taught in their first
-P-A-G-E-47
  IN CLASSES AND WITH INDIVIDUALS 45 
explanatory lessons, the second part may be taken. 
Again let them find out for themselves the effect of 
posture upon their bodies. Let them relax into the 
position which they use when standing in line or wait- 
ing for a street car, assuring them that it is for no 
criticism on the instructor’s part that they are asked 
to assume these positions, but in order that they may 
criticize themselves. Then ask each girl to think of 
her own body, to see if her shoulders are uneven, to 
discover in what position she is holding her hips and 
abdomen, and to give herself a general mental survey. 
Explain the effect upon the body of constant mal- 
position of the hips and shoulders. Lastly instruct 
them in the correct way to relax. By demonstration, 
teach the correct method of sitting, and make them 
see the effect upon the instructor of a crouched posi- 
tion in the chair. 
The next exercise taught is Exercise II, Chapter 
VIII, and this must be learned before they can begin 
another. It is essential that students should readjust 
the pelvis before going on to other posture work. As 
desired results depend upon muscle control, and this 
is a good exercise to use for this purpose, try to see 
that each student can freely contract her abdominal 
and glutei muscles before she tries any other work. 
As soon as Exercise II, Chapter VIII, is conquered, 
the student’s card of exercise is given to her, and one 
by one each exercise is explained to her, the purpose 
for which it is given, and how it is to be taken to 
accomplish that purpose. 
Teaching the reasons for correct posture. Try to 
make the student feel the importance of the correct  
-P-A-G-E-48

-P-A-G-E-49
  IN CLASSES AND WITH INDIVIDUALS 47 
use of her body, not only because of health, but 
because of its effect on her personal appearance and 
her condition of mind and spirit. 
Exercises taken before a mirror. Most of the 
exercises, particularly the walking exercises, are done 
before a mirror, and the students are encouraged to 
study themselves with a critical eye. By this means 
they cannot only check up on their method of doing 
the exercise, but can discover for themselves any 
peculiarities of gait or carriage. As they work, these 
individual peculiarities are pointed out to them by 
the instructors and suggestions are made as to the 
best method of overcoming them. Walking exercises 
are given from the first not only that the students’ 
bodies may be trained under supervision, but also that 
they may learn this one important thing which they 
can carry away with them and practice daily. 
Corrective exercises should be slow. Corrective 
exercises should, asa rule, be taken slowly; each move- 
ment should be well controlled and carried out to a 
finish. Dr. John Mitchell says, in his book Exercise 
for Remedial Purposes, ‘‘In remedial movements to 
correct physical defects the chief value of the exer- 
cises will be lost if they are done too rapidly. The 
movements can scarcely be too slow.”’ The students 
should have a definite consciousness of the muscles 
which are being used during the movement, and with 
most, if not all, exercises should voluntarily contract 
the muscles by power of concentration. This volun- 
tary muscle control is difficult to obtain at first, and 
few who enter a gymnasium class have previously 
acquired it. But it should be considered the founda-
-P-A-G-E-50
  
  48 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
tion of corrective work, and no student should be per- 
mitted to proceed in her work until she has acquired 
this power to some degree. Slow work is necessary 
for this control, as each movement must be studied, 
not for its form, but for its muscle movement. 
Reasons for some work in formal gymnastics. 
Toward the end of the winter’s work it is well to 
introduce some marching and formal work for two 
reasons: first, so that the student may gradually be 
trained into doing rapid work while she exercises that 
control necessary to keep her body in correct posture; 
secondly, so that she may have some training in formal 
gymnastics before entering classes with others, who, 
having already had formal work, will be more ad- 
vanced and less awkward than she.

  Poor posture of university students. It is a source 
of unending surprise to those who work in universities 
that so many students are allowed to reach the 
university age with their bodies in poor postural 
condition. Even when a student has come from a 
school where attention is given to sports and exercises, 
there has been, in almost every case, no instruction as 
to posture, or even as to correct standing position. 
It is advisable, after finishing a physical examina- 
tion, to ask the student to show us how she stands 
when she is trying to look her best. If a girl fails to 
thrust her shoulders back, hollow her back, and other- 
wise distort her body, it is a matter of note and 
interest. 
Instruction should be given in the elementary 
school. This condition should certainly be remedied. 
If, for example, proper physical instruction were 
given early in the child’s life, there would be no need 
of months of work to correct deformities which are a 
result of months, or even years, of improper use of the 
body. Only such instruction and exercise would need 
to be given as seemed necessary to keep the student 
in good condition. Students in corrective classes 
are constantly saying, ‘‘Why was I not taught that

     50 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  before?’’ And their instructors, too, wonder why. 
There are, indeed, many reasons why instruction and 
exercises for posture should be given in elementary and 
in high schools. 
Children eager for information. To those unac- 
customed to work with children, the method of in- 
structional work for bodily correction seems difficult; 
but those who have tried it, find it practicable and 
interesting. A boy must be very young indeed not 
to have learned to make 
his biceps swell to show 
“how much muscle’’ he 
has; it is not difficult, 
therefore, to make him 
realize that he has other 
muscles which will swell 
in the same way. Girls, 
too, can be interested in 
muscles and exercise — 
even very little girls. 
For example, the desire 
to stand up straight and 
UNDESIRABLE sITTING posture walk like a woman is 
Sst hoe A CHE THAT IS 700 easily aroused in them. 
Children are, as a rule, 
eager for information. The facts about the working 
of their muscles, told to them in simple language, arouse 
their interest and fill them with an eager desire to try 
to do as they are told. Even the muscle charts are 
often interesting to them, and sometimes they take 
pride and pleasure in learning, quite unnecessarily, the 
long names of muscles pointed out to them.

Children’s class hour. With children, the class 
hour should consist of some serious work followed by 
simple games, or, perhaps, easy climbing on stall bars 
and swinging on rings. Even this play can be used 
to develop the right muscles. Overfatigue should be 
avoided.

corrective type of exercise; and when there dre two 
or three or more they can be made to look forward 
eagerly to the hour of their exercises. The mirror is a 
great help with the little ones, as well as with the 
older ones, particularly the double mirror in which 
they can see prominent shoulder blades, and abdo- 
mens, and hollow backs. They see for themselves that
-P-A-G-E-54
     
   52 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  they stand out in front and curve in at the back; 
hence, the mere suggestion of pulling in the abdomen 
and so pushing out the back gets a quick response in 
the improved position. It appeals to a child to be 
measured, to be urged to stand up tall and then see 
if he can hold that position in order that he may grow 
to be tall. To praise him for his efforts and point out 
to him their good results, spur him on to yet greater 
effort. Posture tests, also, and grading in posture 
are, of course, incentives. A contest of any kind in- 
terests a child, even if it is only to see if he can walk 
in a straight line toward a mirror keeping a small 
book placed on his head. 
Overfatigue should be avoided. A child must not 
be tired by his work. Work that is too hard for him 
will not only do physical harm, but will cause him 
to come to the corrective class unwillingly, so that 
the results will not be what they should be. 
Lessons learned in childhood remembered. Many - 
lessons as to the position of the feet in standing and 
walking, as to bad results from letting the abdomen 
stand out too far or the head hang down, can be taught 
to a child so that they will make an indelible impres- 
sion. The fact that shoes should give room for the 
toes may be taught at an early age. Do we not all 
remember facts of this type which were impressed 
upon us in our childhood? Sometimes, of course, the 
facts were not what they should have been, as, for 
example, the old-fashioned rule that the toes should 
be pointed out; but certain it is that these teachings, 
whether right or wrong, have remained with us and 
influenced us throughout our lives.

too, be taught to do their share? Should they not, 
for example, watch the children throughout the day 
to see that they do not sit in chairs that are unsuit- 
able? We talk constantly about school seats, but 
how many parents think of providing chairs suitable 
for growing children? On the contrary, after little 
people outgrow their baby chairs, they are forced to - 
sit in chairs built for adults; as a result, they sit on

     FOR SMALL CHILDREN AND OLDER PEOPLE 55 
the front of their chairs and lean back. The rea- 
son why this practice is so common among adults 
is undoubtedly that it was acquired during youth. 
Corrective exercises for older people. Another 
field of corrective exercises which is usually neglected 
is that for the older man 
and woman. According 
to ideas still prevalent, 
men and women of thirty 
whose posture is poor are 
often considered past the 
age when anything can 
be done to change their 
condition. Twenty-five, 
indeed, is often set as 
the final age at which 
results can be expected 
from such work. Pro- 
nated feet, it is true, are 
considered as possibly — qypp or incorrect SITTING POS- 
curable after that age, TURE DEVELOPED BY USE OF 
but treatment of this dis- CHAIRS THAT ARE TOO LARGE 
order is looked upon as ‘‘different.’’ We have a vivid 
memory of sitting in a classroom where the statement 
was made that ‘‘one should not expect to.correct the 
posture after twenty-five,’ whereupon a_ student 
leaned toward us and said, ‘‘That finishes me. I was 
taking this course so that I could correct my body, and 
I am now twenty-seven.’”” And upon other occasions 
when we have assigned women of thirty to the cor- 
rective classroom, they have told us that people 
laughed at them for thinking that they could change 
       
    
-P-A-G-E-58
    
   56 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
their bodies at their age. It is tv that bad struc- 
tural changes in bones cannot be overcome; but this 
condition is found not only in older persons, but in 
children as well. We do not wish to seem to under- 
value the importance of correcting posture in youth, 
for it is then a much easier task; and, naturally, 
if the poor postural condition is continued for any 
great length of time, bony changes may take place 
which will make it impossible to bring the body 
into perfect condition. But even if this preventive 
work has not been done and the bones and muscles 
have become somewhat .changed, much can still be 
accomplished in most cases to bring the muscles, at 
least, into much better condition; and many have, by 
perseverance, so restored their bodies that it would 
almost take an expert to discover their deformities. 
A case which came under our care a few years ago 
was that of a woman over thirty years of age who 
came into the class with great hesitance because she 
had been teased for thinking that she could help her- 
self there. She was sensitive and nervous and had 
become so conscious of her awkward appearance and 
gait that her sensitiveness began to interfere with her 
work as a lecturer. She wore bad shoes; she had flat 
feet and large hips; and she walked most ungracefully. 
Finally, her very poor posture was accompanied by 
visceral ptosis, constipation, and painful menstruation. 
In the corrective classroom she was first taught to 
carry her feet correctly; she was, in addition, given 
foot exercises and instructed as to the type of shoe 
which she should wear. Then she was given posture 
exercises and exercises to reduce her hips, and she
-P-A-G-E-59
  FOR SMALL CHILDREN AND OLDER PEOPLE 57 
was also criticized in regard to her method of walking. 
In class she worked faithfully and hard; she bought 
different shoes; she practiced walking in front of the 
mirror. She put in many extra hours at the work, 
and when she left the university at the end of the year 
she felt that she had been made over. She still 
seems to feel so; for she has written to a number of 
people telling them that her year at the university 
did wonders for her physically, that she has not lapsed 
into her former condition and never will. 
Opinions of physicians. Dr. John Mitchell in his 
book, Mechanotherapy and Physical Education, says, 
“A few words and most important ones must be said 
on the immense value of exercise in later middle years 
and in old age.””’,. Dr. McKenzie, in Exercise in Educa- 
tion and Medicine, after giving a number of breathing 
and other exercises recommended by Sir Herman 
Weber to be used by those in advanced age, goes on to 
quote from this author: ‘‘ By this movement we bring 
into action some of the muscles of the spine which are 
apt to be only imperfectly used by most persons in 
advanced age; and the stiffness of the neck and spine 
and the tendency to stooping so common in old per- 
sons can be to some degree corrected by this kind of 
movement.’’ Again he quotes from the same source, 
“In addition to the influence on the circulation, the 
respiratory movements keep up the nutrition and effi- 
ciency of the lungs, which undergo in old age a kind 
of atrophy.’’ And again, ‘Another important influ- 
ence consists in maintaining the elasticity of the chest 
walls which are apt to become stiff in old age and 
thus to interfere with free movement of the lungs.”

    58 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
If exercise and exercises are important for those in 
“advanced age’’ and are useful for ‘‘correcting”’ their 
round shoulders and other defects, certainly we should 
not discourage those between thirty and forty who 
come to us hoping to improve their condition. We 
should, on the contrary, take infinite pains to examine 
them, prescribe exercises, and in every way aid and 
encourage them to develop better bodies. 
Exercises should be suited to the age of the 
student. Exercises for both the very young and the 
middle-aged should be adapted to the age and physical 
condition of the one needing treatment. With both 
classes great care should be taken that individuals 
are not overworked — that they not only are not ex- 
cessively fatigued at the time of their exercises, but 
that they do not feel unnatural fatigue between the 
class hours. With older people, of course, the play 
element is not essential as it is with children. What 
they do need, however, is careful oversight and clear 
instruction as to their defective condition, the causes 
for this condition, the results which may follow if the 
condition is not corrected, and the means which they 
can use in their daily life to assist in its improvement. 
For older people especial care should be taken to. have 
the exercises so regulated that the heart will not be 
overtaxed. For instance, in making a schedule for a 
woman who is constantly occupied throughout the 
day, we ought so to regulate the work that she will 
feel refreshed, rather than overfatigued, by her exer- 
cises in the gymnasium.

allowed to sag out of place, the unnecessary fatigue 
caused by wrongly used muscles and imperfect circu- 
lation, the consequences of compressed and narrowed 
chest walls, and that crooked spines in their old age 
will be the result of unnecessary postural curves. 
Many will be hard to convince, for the young fre- 
quently live for the day and give no thought to the 
future, but a large per cent of those instructed will 
understand the value of correct posture and make an 
effort to acquire it. 
Normal posture. The normal body is one which is 
held up at its full height, the weight upon the balls of 
the parallel feet, the head and chest well up,. the 
shoulder blades flat upon the back, the costal angle 
from seventy to ninety degrees, the abdominal muscles 
strong, the abdomen flat at its lower part and fuller 
just below the ribs, the pelvis tilted at such an angle 
as to prevent an exaggeration of the lumbar curve, 
and the knees straight but not stiff. With the body 
in this position the thorax is full and round; the dia- 
phragm is high; the abdominal viscera, except the 
lower portion of the colon, the sigmoid flexure, and 
part of the small intestines, are above the umbilicus; 
the stomach is pear shaped and lies on the left side 
partly under the ribs; the liver and intestines are in 
place; the pelvic organs are free from pressure from 
above and their blood supply is not interfered with. 
Incorrect posture. When the body is held incor- 
rectly the head and shoulders are forward, the weight 
is upon the wrong part; 7. e., the inside, of the out- 
ward turned feet; the knees are rotated inward; with 
an incorrect tilt of the pelvis, the lumbar curve is
-P-A-G-E-62
64 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
increased and the sacroiliac joint is strained, the chest 
is lowered, and the lungs compressed; the costal angle 
is narrow; and, finally, the abdominal muscles being 
relaxed, the abdominal organs sag down so that they

do not function as they should and they press upon 
and interfere with the pelvic organs. 
As a result of this malposition of the body there is 
a loss of efficiency. All over the body the muscles
-P-A-G-E-63
CORRECT POSTURE 65 
are strained, and as they are working at a disadvan- 
tage they are easily fatigued. For example, the for- 
ward head and drooping shoulders strain the muscles 
in the back of the neck and the upper part of the back. 
The back is also strained in the lumbar and sacroiliac 
regions and the increased dorsal curve strains the in- 
      
CORRECT AND INCORRECT SITTING POSITION 
tervertebral ligaments and presses upon the nerves. 
The lungs work at a disadvantage because of their 
narrowed space; and, because the diaphragm is low- 
ered and the abdominal muscles relaxed, the support 
for the abdominal organs is lessened and they sag 
out of place. The results are constipation, indiges- 
tion, and, frequently in women, menstrual disorders. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
66 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  Finally, there is a loss of coérdination and balance and 
a general feeling of fatigue and discouragement. 
Correct posture in sitting and relaxed standing. 
Correct posture in sitting and relaxed standing should 
also be taught, for many hours spent in sitting incor- 
rectly, or standing mainly on one foot with the body 
twisted out of shape, will cause grave postural defects. 
A full description of the correct methods of sitting 
and standing are given in Chapter VIII under Exer- 
cise I. 
Best methods of teaching correct posture. Among 
instructors in posture work there is no one point upon 
which there is more disagreement than upon the proper 
orders for bringing a class into correct standing pos- 
ture. Such orders as these are frequently given: 
“Heels together, weight forward, shoulders back, 
chest up, chin in, and head up.” Such orders gen- 
erally result in a chin drawn back in an unnatural 
position with the neck still out of line, shoulders 
thrust backward, and the weight on the heels—the 
result being a backward displacement of the trunk 
and an increased hollow in the back. In fact, ex- 
perience shows that students who come for examina- 
tion for, and correction of, poor posture almost in- 
variably endeavor to correct their posture by thrusting 
their shoulders too far back and their chests unneces- 
sarily high, but do nothing to bring their necks into 
line, to decrease the hollow in their backs, to correct 
the position of their feet, or to alter their faulty weight 
bearing. For this reason it seems best at first to 
ignore those parts of the body which the students are 
already inclined to overcorrect and to give the orders

in such a way that they will get a different point of 
view. Correcting the position of the feet, swaying the 
body slightly forward from the heels up, stretching 
the spine, and pulling the abdomen in will in most 
cases correct (at least partly) the hollow back. Bring-

the breastbone), will bring up the breastbone and so

the trunk or the thrusting backward of the shoulders.
-P-A-G-E-67
  
  CORRECT POSTURE 69 
There is nearly always a tendency among beginners 
in corrective exercise to hyperextend; 7. ¢., stiffen, the 
knees backward. Such a tendency is probably due to 
the severe effort that is being made. This incorrect 
position of the knees must be guarded against, as it 
not only increases the lumbar curve and makes the 
whole body stiff, but also frequently causes pain in 
the lumbar region and produces a general condition 
of fatigue. In correct position, the knees are not 
bent, but held in an easy position of slight extension. 
The knees should be watched also to see that there is 
no inward rotation. If this condition is present, in- 
struction should be given as to the proper method of 
rotating them slightly outward, with exercises to 
strengthen the muscles which should hold the knees 
in correct position. 
Typical postural defects. Typical anteroposterior 
postural defects are illustrated in the drawings on 
page 64. In forward curvature or lordosis there is 
an increase of the normal lumbar curve. In back- 
ward curvature or kyphosis there is an increase of the 
normal thoracic curve. These defects are very fre- 
quently combined. In flat back (not illustrated) 
there is a decrease of all the normal curves. Each of 
these types is accompanied by various related or re- 
sulting maladjustments.

PURPOSE. To teach correct posture when the stu- 
dent is standing (a) ‘‘at attention’’ and (b) relaxed.           
              
                                (a) Standing at Attention 
POSITION. Standing, with the feet straight, the 
knees straight and not too stiff, the weight on the 
balls of thesfeet, the body swayed slightly forward, 
the arms down at the sides, the abdomen drawn in, 
the trunk stretched as tall as possible, the neck held 
back and stretched up, the shoulder blades flat against 
the back, and the chin at such a level that if one were 
in front of a mirror one would look straight into one’s 
own eyes. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Turning the toes out. 
(2) Thrusting the shoulders and upper trunk back- 
ward. (3) Resting the weight back on the heels. 
(4) Increasing the hollow in the back. (5) Not 
putting the neck back in line with the rest of the 
spine. (6) Pulling the chin too far in. (7) Raising 
the chest too high. (8) Overextending the knees 
backward. (9) Sagging in at the knees and allowing 
them to rotate inward.

(2) At ease (b). (3) Correct standing at attention. 
(4) Rest — the position in which the student has been 
accustomed to relax. 
HINTS TO INSTRUCTOR. Exercise I(a) should be 
used frequently, being given before every standing or 
walking exercise, and no such exercise should be begun 
until the body is in good position; (b) is excellent to 
use before starting a balance exercise. This relaxed 
position is the whole ‘secret of balance; that is, the 
middle of the weight should be over the base of sup- 
port. It is well to teach a student to practice this 
until she can take the position naturally and quickly. 
Muscle control is the foundation of balance and 
coordination, and, therefore, of good posture. It 
follows that the students should be made to under- 
stand what muscles they are using in order to reach
-P-A-G-E-70
   
     
                     72 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS    
   good posture, and should be taught to control those 
muscles voluntarily. It is better to give ample time 
to Exercise I at first, even though progress seems 
slow. Later, when muscle control has been learned, 
improvement will be all the more rapid because of 
this instruction. 
Wall Exercise. 
PURPOSE. (1) To change the tilt of the pelvis— 
to bring the front of it up and the back down, and 
thus decrease the anteroposterior curve in the lum- 
bar region. (2) To give the correct relative position 
of the trunk and pelvis. (3) To serve as an abdom- 
inal exercise. 
POSITION. Standing, leaning against the wall, the 
feet straight and the heels a few inches from the wall. 
EXERCISE. Push back at the waist line toward 
the wall. (This is done by contracting the abdominal 
muscles and the muscles in the back of the hips and 
thighs.) Holding the back in this position, draw the 
shoulder blades in and down, place the fingertips 
against the wall, and sway the body forward until the 
weight is upon the balls of the feet. Bring the head 
and neck into correct position. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to contract the cor- 
rect muscles. Raising the chest, holding the breath, 
and pressing the shoulders back against the wall in 
the effort to contract the abdominal muscles. (2) In- 
creasing the lumbar curve. (3) Failing to change the 
position of the head and neck after swaying forward. 
(4) Bending the knees. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This is a difficult ex-

  POSTURE EXERCISES 73, 
ercise for most beginners as it requires good muscle 
control, and the custom of tightening the abdominal 
muscles by lifting the chest or by filling the lungs is a 
very common one. Before the exercise can be prop- 
erly executed this habit must be overcome. In 
“working up”’ to an exercise it is better not to put 
the body into an incorrect position as a means of 
reaching the required result by an indirect way. Many 
methods of reaching this position are taught. One is 
to bend the knees. until the back touches the wall, 
then to extend them gradually while making an effort 
to hold the back against the wall. Another is to droop 
the head and shoulders and flex the knees until the 
back is close to the wall, then gradually extend the 
knees and bring up the head and shoulders. It does 
not seem a good plan to make the first step of an 
exercise one which throws the body into an incorrect 
position in the belief that the correctness of the last 
step will compensate for incorrectness of the first. As 
it is necessary for the student to be able to correct the 
position of her pelvis at any time and at any place, 
it is certainly better to teach the direct method of 
controlling these muscles. 
This exercise should first be demonstrated to the 
student by the instructor. The student should place 
her hand against the wall, back of the instructor’s 
lumbar curve. As the instructor contracts her muscles 
the student should feel that the spine is forced back- 
ward. Next, placing one hand on the instructor’s 
abdomen and the other against her buttocks, the stu- 
dent feels the contraction of those muscles. She 
should then lean against the wall and endeavor to con-  
-P-A-G-E-72
  74 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
tract her own muscles in the same way. If not suc- 
cessful the first time, the experiment should be re- 
peated several times. If the student is still unable to 
make the correct movement, the instructor may push 
down upon the student’s sacrum as she makes the 
effort, and thus help her to localize her pull. After 
assisting the student two or three times and pointing 
out the errors she is making, the instructor should 
leave her for a while to try it out for herself. 
If this method is not a success the student should 
be told to lie flat upon her back and after she is thor- 
oughly relaxed she should be directed to push down 
upon the instructor’s hand, which has been placed 
under her waist. This, as a rule, is easy to do in this 
position. The movement should be repeated until it 
can be easily accomplished. It is then suggested to 
the student that as she makes the movement she shall 
try to realize what muscles she is using. As a rule 
the abdominal muscles are the first discovered, though 
sometimes even these are not observed unless the in- 
structor places her hand upon the abdomen as the 
muscles are contracted. After this the student’s atten- 
tion is drawn to the tightening of the muscles in the 
back of her thighs and buttocks. She should then be 
directed to place her hands upon the anterosuperior 
spines of the ilium (the prominent part of the pelvis 
in front) and feel the movement upward of the pelvis. 
In this way she can be made to realize what she is 
doing and the means which she is using to accomplish 
the movement. If the contraction of the muscles in 
the buttocks)cannot be made, the student should be 
told to turn over on her face and with the instructor’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
     75 
  POSTURE EXERCISES 
assistance should contract the muscles, pulling in and 
down as the instructor pushes the muscles in the right 
direction. 
When the exercise can be done in the supine posi- 
tion, the student endeavors to lean against the wall 
and try to move the same muscles, going from the 
table to the wall and back again as often as necessary 
until she can do the exercise freely in either position. 
Sometimes there is such lack of coérdination on the 
part of the student’s muscles that it is necessary to 
abandon the wall exercise temporarily and begin with 
an exercise to develop a sense of muscle control. One 
which is generally used is that for abdominal contrac- 
tions, given as Exercise XIX in Chapter IX. 
The Wall Exercise is a very important one for the 
student to conquer as it ensures a position which she 
must be able to-assume and hold at all times if she is 
to have good posture. Exerting the muscle control 
necessary to execute the exercise is also splendid prac- 
tice, because direct muscle control is most necessary 
and often lacking in persons with poor posture. For 
this reason the exercise should be thoroughly taught 
and not abandoned until the student has conquered it. 
Exercise III. Walking a Line. 
PURPOSE. (1) To train the student to walk with 
the feet straight, the body in correct position and the 
weight thrown correctly upon the feet; (2) to serve 
as a balance exercise. 
POSITION. Standing on a line in front of and lead- 
ing to a mirror but some distance from it, with the 
body held correctly, feet straight, and the arms down 
at the sides. 
      
    
-P-A-G-E-74
   
   76 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
EXERCISE. Walk forward toward the mirror, plac- 
ing the front foot close against the toes of the rear 
foot and keeping the feet straight upon the line. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Incorrect posture of the 
body. (2) Turning the toes out. (3) Letting the feet 
pronate. (4) Failing to bring the heel of the forward 
foot close back against the rear foot. (5) Leaning 
the head over to watch the feet instead of looking 
into the mirror. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise is an ex- 
cellent one to use in training the student in the correct 
method of walking. The feet should be brought 
down correctly, the weight should be carried cor- 
rectly, and careful attention should be paid to details. 
The exercise should be taken slowly and should not 
be continued after fatigue is making it difficult to hold 
the body correctly. 
Exercise IV. Turkey Walk. 
PURPOSE. To strengthen the muscles of the thighs, 
legs, and feet; to teach the proper use of the feet; 
and to improve the balance. 
POSITION. Standing, with the body held correctly, 
in one of the following positions: (1) hands on hips, 
or (2) hands back of the neck, or (3) arms overhead, 
hands holding a wand. 
EXERCISE. (a) Bring the knee well up with the 
leg straight down and the ankle flexed. (b) With the 
knee still up extend the leg and foot, pointing the toe. 
(c) Bring the foot to the floor, heel first, a moderate 
step in advance. 
Repeat with the other foot and leg.       
-P-A-G-E-75
POSTURE EXERCISES 77 
  POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Thrusting the head for- 
ward. (2) Throwing the weight back on the heels. 
(3) Increasing the anteroposterior lumbar curve. 
(4) Turning the toes out. (5) Flexing the knee too 
much and holding the foot too far back. (6) Pointing 
the toes to the floor in (a). (7) Imperfect balance. 
(8) Making the step too long or too short. (9) Bring- 
ing the toes to the floor first. 
‘HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. An exercise of this kind 
should be given at first with the hands on the hips, 
as the arms-overhead position is apt to increase the 
lumbar curve, and make the balance more difficult. 
The student should understand thoroughly the method 
of obtaining good balance before attempting the ex- 
ercise. It should be given slowly and good technique 
required from the beginning as the exercise is of little 
use unless executed correctly. The exercise may be 
given at first with the student standing still instead of 
walking forward, until the technique of leg lifting 
and balancing is acquired. 
Exercise V. Walking Tiptoe. 
PURPOSE. To increase balance, to exercise the feet, 
to stretch the body, and to train the student in main- 
taining correct posture under difficulties. 
POSITION. Standing, with the arms down in front 
grasping a wand held horizontally, the heels turned 
out and the toes in. 
EXERCISE. Rise to tiptoes, bring the arms over- 
head, and walk the line toward the mirror, taking small 
steps and putting the feet down one directly in front 
of the other. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Increasing the lumbar curve.
-P-A-G-E-76
78 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
(2) Failing to keep the heels out and the toes in. 
(3) Making the steps too long. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise should not 
be given until the arms can be held overhead without 
increasing the lumbar curve. The exercise may be 
used for the feet by placing the hands upon the hips. 
  Exercise VI. Stretching. 
PURPOSE. To stretch the spine with the body in 
correct position and to develop the muscles which 
should hold it in that position. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands on the hips. 
EXERCISE. Push down on the hips and stretch the 
trunk as much as possible. Remove the hands and 
let the arms sink slowly to the side position and the 
shoulders to place, but keep the muscles in the trunk 
contracted so that the spine is held in the stretched 
position. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Losing the correct posture 
and balance. (2) Bringing the arms down too quickly. 
(3) Failing to keep the spine stretched: and the trunk 
muscles contracted. (4) Throwing the weight back on 
the heels. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise may be 
used as an individual exercise or with a class. If the 
arms are brought down too rapidly the trunk muscles 
relax and the whole effect of the exercise is lost. When 
giving an exercise of this type, care must be taken to 
see that the body is well balanced on the balls of the 
feet and that the trunk is stretched upward and for- 
ward. When using the exercise with an individual 
who is stiff or who has marked rotation of the spine,
-P-A-G-E-77
  POSTURE EXERCISES 79 
the assistant can make the exercise more effective by 
placing her hands on the two sides of the student’s 
trunk, thus helping her to stretch. The instructor’s 
hands should not be removed until the student’s arms 
and shoulders are in place. If there is either spinal 
rotation or much displacement, the instructor should 
direct the force of her push on that side of the stu- 
dent’s body which will help her to correct those 
defects. 
Exercise VII. Stretching. Exercise. 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise VI. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands clasped on the 
top of the head. 
EXERCISE. Stretch the body up, pulling down with 
the hands at the same time. Remove the hands 
slowly and bring down into position but keep the 
trunk muscles contracted. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to keep the muscles 
of the trunk contracted. (2) Placing the hands too 
far back on the head. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. Both this and Exercise 
VI may be taken sitting. Exercise VII can be used 
in place of Exercise VI to give variety. Or, as it is 
a little more difficult to hold the spine stretched while 
bringing the hands down from the head, it can be used 
to follow up Exercise VI. 
Exercise VIII. Stretching. 
PURPOSE. To relieve fatigue by stretching the 
whole body after a posture exercise. 
POSITION. Standing in correct posture. 
   
-P-A-G-E-78
80 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  EXERCISE. (a) Raise the arms forward and upward 
and stretch. (b) Bring the arms down to shoulder 
height and stretch. (c) Bring the arms down at the 
sides and stretch. (d) Relax. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to hold the correct 
body position throughout the exercise. (2) Keeping 
the arms uneven at the shoulders. 
Exercise IX. For Standing Posture. 
PURPOSE. To bring the body into correct balance 
and posture. 
POSITION. Standing. 
EXERCISE. Extend the arms at either side to shoul- 
der level with the palms downward. Rise to tiptoes. 
Sink to the heels, keeping the arms extended. Slowly 
lower the arms. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to keep correct pos- 
ture. (2) Coming back with the weight on the heels. 
HINT TO THE INSTRUCTOR. In addition to being 
a helpful exercise, this is also a good test for posture. 
Exercise X. Correct Walking. 
PURPOSE. To train in front of a mirror in the cor- 
rect method of walking. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands down at the 
sides, the feet straight, the body swayed slightly for- 
ward. 
EXERCISE. Bring the left foot forward, bend the 
knee, and slightly flex the ankle. Touch the floor 
lightly with the heel and throw the weight imme- 
diately upon the ball of the foot. As the left foot 
takes the weight of the body, bend the right knee and 
bring that foot up to the toes. Push off with the

toes, lift with the muscles of the thigh, bring the right 
leg forward, and come down with the heel first as was 
done with the left foot. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Putting the weight on the 
heels. (2) Turning the toes out. (3) Failing to keep

the body in good posture. (4) Not bending the knees. 
(5) Not lifting with the thigh muscles. (6) Swaying 
the pelvis or trunk. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  82 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. In slow walking on a 
level surface the thigh should move on the pelvis, the 
leg on the thigh, the foot on the leg, and the toes on 
the rest of the foot. All walking movements should 
be in an anteroposterior plane; there should be prac- 
tically no swaying of the body nor tilting of the 
pelvis. The arms should sway naturally at the sides, 
the head be held up well, and the student should be 
able to walk without leaning over to watch the 
ground. This method of walking seems stiff at first, 
but after it has been practiced for a while it becomes 
natural and easy. It should be practiced slowly in 
front of a mirror and the student should watch her 
movements carefully to detect any idiosyncrasies of 
carriage, or in the use of her feet. Sometimes, when 
one has been in the habit of walking with the toes 
out, the tendency is to throw the toes out and bring 
them back, making a semicircle with one foot or with 
both feet.

  CHAPTER IX 
EXERCISES FOR FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR 
CONDITIONS 
Exercise I. For Faulty Anteroposterior Conditions. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the muscles in the back of 
the neck and shoulders with the body placed in a 
position which makes it difficult to increase the 
lumbar curve. 
POSITION. Half lying on a table or plinth, the feet 
on the floor, the trunk resting on the table, the head 
bent forward with the forehead on the table, the arms 
down and back, and the hands clasped. 
EXERCISE. Keep the forehead down, the chin in, 
and (a) pull the head and the neck backward until 
the neck is in line with the rest of the spine; (b) pull 
down and back with the arms and contract the 
muscles between the shoulder blades; (c) contract the 
abdominal muscles; then (d) bring the trunk up to an 
upright position with the weight on the feet. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Raising the forehead and 
chin and rolling the head on the neck. (2) In doing 
(a) and (6), raising the trunk from the table by con- 
tracting the muscles of the spine. (3) Increasing the 
lumbar curve by failing to contract the abdominal 
muscles before raising the trunk from the table. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise, if cor- 
rectly given, is an excellent one for correcting a for-

FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR CONDITIONS 85 
  ward head and stooped shoulders, and for strengthen- 
ing the muscles of the back. Parts (a) and (6) of the 
exercise should be given first in the order as they come. 
In these the student’s trunk should rest upon the table 
so that the muscles of the back are completely 
relaxed. The movements should be made by volun- 
tary contraction of the muscles of the back of the 
neck and the upper part of the back, while the muscles 
in front. of the neck are also slightly contracted to 
make resistance against the movement. The muscles 
in the middle and lower part of the back should be 
relaxed so that there is no lifting of the trunk below 
the shoulder blades. The instructor should at first 
place her hand upon the student’s back just below the 
point to which the muscle contraction is to be made, so 
that the student may learn not to contract her muscles 
below that point. After (a) and (b) can be correctly 
executed, (c) may be given; but this part of the 
exercise should be omitted until the student has suffi- 
cient control of her abdominal muscles to raise her 
body without increasing her lumbar curve. 
Exercise II. For Faulty Anteroposterior Conditions. 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise I. 
POSITION. Sitting astride a stool, the arms down 
and back, the hands clasped behind, and the head 
forward with the chin resting on the chest. 
EXERCISE. Pull down and back with the arms. 
Contract the muscles in the back of the neck and 
upper part of the back and pull the neck and shoulders 
back. Resist with the muscles in the front of the 
neck.
-P-A-G-E-84
86 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Raising the chin and fore- 
head and rolling the head on the neck. (2) Bending 
the trunk backward and thus increasing hyperex- 
tension in the lumbar region. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. ‘Lhis exercise, given 
to provide variety, is very much like Exercise I in its 
effect, but is not so good as that, as it is more difficult 
in this position to ‘get a strong neck and shoulder 
exercise without increasing the lumbar curve. 
Exercise III. Shoulder Exercise with Wand. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the muscles at the back of 
the head and shoulders, and to stretch the chest 
muscles and the muscles at the back of the thighs. 
POSITION. Sitting on the floor or on a plinth with 
the legs straight out in front, the body held erect, and 
the hands grasping a wand. 
EXERCISE. (a) Raise the wand forward and up- 
ward, stretching well. (b) Bend the elbows and 
bring the wand back of the shoulder blades. (c) 
Return to first position. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Sitting with the knees bent 
and the shoulders drooped. (2) Dropping the head 
forward as the wand is carried backward. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. In this position it is 
possible to give a strong shoulder exercise without 
causing increased lumbar curve. The exercise can be 
made more strenuous if the instructor will grasp the 
wand when it is overhead and give resistance as it is 
brought back of the shoulders, or if the student will 
slide her hands out toward the ends of the wand while 
it is held back of her shoulders.

Exercise IV. Resistive Head Exercise 1 (Standing). 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise I. 
POSITION. Standing, facing the wall, with the arms 
extended and the hands braced against the wall. One 
hand of the instructor against the back of the student’s 
head, the other hand in front on the abdomen. 
  RESISTIVE HEAD EXERCISE 
(Exercise IV, Chapter IX.)
-P-A-G-E-87
  FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR CONDITIONS 89 
EXERCISE. Contract the abdominal muscles, 
stretch the body up straight, bend the head forward 
until the chin rests upon the chest. Push the head 
and neck backward against the resistance given by 
the instructor. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Bending the elbows as the 
hands rest upon the wall. (2) Pushing back with the 
shoulders and trunk. (3) Increasing the lumbar curve. 
(4) Raising the chin, thus rocking the head back. 
(5) Failing to push the neck back. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise, as well 
as most of the neck exercises, should be done by con- 
tracting the muscles at the base of the neck and re- 
sisting slightly with the muscles of the front of the 
neck. The body must be kept erect, the abdominal 
muscles contracted. The resistance given by the in- 
structor must be only heavy enough to increase the 
work of the muscle, not to retard it. As the strength 
of the muscle increases, the degree of resistance may 
be increased. The instructor’s hand is placed in front 
of the student’s abdomen so that any movement 
on the part of the student to thrust the abdomen for- 
ward may be detected. 
Exercise V. Resistive Head Exercise 2 (Sitting). 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise I. 
POSITION. Sitting on a stool, facing the stall bars, 
and grasping the bars with the arms extended at 
shoulder height, the hand of the instructor against 
the back of the student’s head. 
EXERCISE. Same as in Exercise IV. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Raising the chin and rocking
-P-A-G-E-88
  90 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
the head on the neck. (2) Including the body in the 
movement. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. The stool should be 
placed at that distance from the bar which will enable 
the student to have her arms straight out as she 
grasps the bar. Resistance should not be too heavy. 
  Exercise VI. Shoulder Exercise 1. 
PURPOSE. ‘To exercise the adductor muscles of the 
shoulders. 
POSITION. Sitting astride a stool, with the arms 
stretching forward, palms in; the instructor standing 
back of the student, grasping her arms just below her 
elbows. 
EXERCISE. Bring the arms backward to the hori- 
zontal side position against the resistance given by 
the instructor. Inhale as the arms go backward; 
exhale as they go forward. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Dropping the head forward. 
(2) Letting the shoulders stoop. (3) Raising the shoul- 
ders. (4) Dropping the arms below the height of the 
shoulders. (5) Increasing the lumbar curve. 
Exercise VII. Shoulder Exercise 2 (Swimming). 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise VI. 
POSITION. Standing or sitting. 
EXERCISE. (a) Thrust the arms forward with the 
palms in. (b) Turn the hands and bring the extended 
arms backward. (c) Bend the elbows and bring them 
in to the waist with the hands at the shoulders. 
(d) Repeat. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Dropping the head and
-P-A-G-E-89
  FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR CONDITIONS 91 
shoulders forward. (2) Too little vigor in the move- 
ment. (3) Increasing the lumbar curve. 
Exercise VIII. Shoulder Exercise 3 (with Pulley 
Weights). 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise VI. 
POSITION. Standing facing the machine at full arm’s 
length away. 
EXERCISE. (a) Grasp the handles of the machine, 
stretching the body well up with the weight on the 
balls of the feet. (6) Flex the elbows and bring them 
down to the waist, turning the palms forward and 
bringing the hands to the outer side of the shoulders. 
(c) Back to first position. (d) Bring the extended 
arms down. to the sides, the palms forward. (e) Back 
to place. (f) Bring the extended arms out at the 
sides, shoulder height, the palms forward. (g) Back 
to place. (h) Bring the extended arms overhead. 
(i) Back to place. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Letting the trunk sway 
backward thus increasing the lumbar curve. (2) Using 
the weight of the trunk to raise the pulley weights. 
(3) Dropping the head and shoulders forward. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. Remember that to ex- 
ercise the muscles of the back one should face the 
machine. For the chest muscles, one should stand 
with the back toward the machine. Unless the pulley 
weight exercises are used correctly they are injurious 
rather than beneficial. In order to exercise the mus- 
cles of the shoulders, the shoulder muscles must lift 
the weights. This is not done when the body sways 
backward and forward with each exercise. A common
-P-A-G-E-90
  92 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
mistake is to use too much weight; that is, weight 
that is too heavy for the shoulder and arm muscles; 
as a consequence, the trunk is swayed backward so 
that its weight may assist in the lift. The exercises 
should be begun with the lightest weight, and other 
weights should be added as they can be lifted. For 
the overhead exercise a very light weight is necessary. 
  Exercise IX. Chest Stretching 1. 
PURPOSE. To stretch the pectoral muscles, force 
the shoulder blades back, and expand the chest. 
POSITION. Sitting on a stool, the hands back of the 
neck, the elbows bent and held well back; the 
instructor standing with her foot on the stool back of 
the student, the instructor’s knee against the student’s 
back and her hands grasping the student’s bent 
elbows. 
EXERCISE. The instructor pulls the student’s 
elbows back, down and around to first position and 
presses her knee into the student’s back in order to 
stretch the pectoral muscles. The student must 
inhale as the arms come backward and exhale as they 
go forward. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Dropping the head forward. 
(2) Increasing the lumbar curve. (3) Rising from 
the stool as the muscles are stretched. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. The degree of stretching 
accomplished depends upon the force used in pulling 
back the elbows and pushing in with the knee. This 
force should not be great enough to cause pain nor to 
force the student to rise from the seat. It is better 
to use only a little force at first and gradually to
-P-A-G-E-91
FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR CONDITIONS 93 
  increase it as the student’s muscles become accus- 
tomed to the exercise. 
Exercise X. Chest Stretching 2 (Corner Exercise). 
PURPOSE. To stretch the pectoral muscles and to 
exercise the muscles of the abdomen, adductors of the

(Exercise IX, Chapter IX.) 
shoulder blades, and the muscles of the feet and legs. 
POSITION. ‘This exercise can be taken in the corner 
of a room or on upright bars ina gymnasium. Stand- 
ing facing the corner, the feet straight and about

  94 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  twelve inches from the wall, the body erect, the head 
up, and the abdominal muscles contracted. The hands, 
with the fingers pointing in, on the wall at the two 
sides of the corner and at what would be the height 
of the shoulders if student were standing on tiptoes. 
  CHEST STRETCHING 
(Exercise X, Chapter IX.) 
Note good position of child at right. Elbows of child at left are too 
low.
-P-A-G-E-93
  FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR CONDITIONS 95 
EXERCISE. (a) Rise to tiptoes and swing the trunk 
forward between the two hands, letting the elbows 
flex but keeping them at shoulder height. (6) Swing 
back and sink to the heels. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Dropping the head forward. 
(2) Relaxing the abdominal muscles. (3) Letting the 
back sink in at the lumbar region. (4) Changing the 
level of the elbows above or below shoulder et 
(5) Turning the toes out. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise may be 
taken with or without deep breathing. The severity 
of the exercise is regulated by the distance of the 
student’s feet from the corner or the bars. If she 
complains of pain while doing the exercise she is not 
doing it correctly. Pain is caused by a sagging in 
of the lumbar region and this can be prevented by the 
contraction of the abdominal muscles. If these 
muscles are properly contracted, the exercise can be 
used even with a case of sacroiliac strain. 
Give the exercise at first with the feet rather close 
up and give it only two or three times. As the 
student’s muscles become accustomed to the work, 
increase the number of times it is given and by 
moving the feet back increase the severity of the 
exercise. 
Exercise XI. Chest Stretching 3. 
EXERCISE. An exercise using Lovett’s apparatus 
for round shoulders. (For method and purpose, see 
Lateral Curvature of the Spine and Round Shoulders, by 
Robert W. Lovett, M.D.) 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. There are the same
-P-A-G-E-94
    96 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
objections to the use of this machine in a class in 
corrective gymnastics as there are to other stretching 
machines. (1) It makes the student conspicuous 
and self-conscious. (2) There is danger of stretch: 
ing the muscles beyond the student’s power of holding. 
The first objection can be overcome by a tactful pres- 
entation of the exercise. The apparatus can be used 
at first with those in the class whose condition is 
not sufficiently serious to make them sensitive. The . 
other students may be allowed to watch those who 
are put into the apparatus, and they should be 
encouraged to ask questions. Any student who 
wishes to try the machine should be allowed to do 
so. The time lost is small in comparison to the 
good accomplished by the psychological effect upon 
the class. The second objection is lessened if the 
stretching is not given too vigorously at first, and it is 
done away with if the student is first trained to hold 
her body at its best. 
Exercise XII. Shoulder Exercises for Two Students. 
PURPOSE. To add resistance to shoulder exercise 
and to provide variety. 
POSITION. Standing back to back, or facing, arms 
extended overhead, both students grasping a wand 
with both hands. 
EXERCISE. (a) Swing the arms down at one side; 
bend the elbow at that side, one student resisting as 
the arms are brought down. (b) Bring the arms back 
to place without resistance. (c) Swing down on the 
other side with resistance. (d) Back to place with- 
out resistance. (¢) Repeat, second student resisting.
-P-A-G-E-95
FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR CONDITIONS 97 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to hold the trunk 
erect as the arms are swung down. (2) Too much or 
too little resistance. (3) Failing to bend the elbows. 
  Exercise XIII. For Shoulder and Back. 
PURPOSE. To strengthen muscles of back and 
stretch pectoral muscles. 
POSITION. (1) Standing, with the body erect and 
hands resting on the hips. (2) Standing, with the 
_ trunk bending forward and the hands on the hips. 
EXERCISE. (a) Bring the arms up with the elbows 
bent and the hands back of the neck. (b) Bring the 
arms down with the elbows at the waist and the 
thumbs at the shoulders. (c) Stretch the arms over- 
head with the palms in. (d) Bring the arms down 
with the elbows at the waist and the thumbs at the 
shoulder. 
Repeat the series. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to bring the elbows 
well in at the waist. (2) Bringing hands to incorrect 
position. (3) Dropping the head and shoulders for- 
ward. (4) Increasing the lumbar curve. (5) Failing 
to keep the trunk in a correct position with the 
weight forward. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This series of arm ex- 
ercises and others which may be used to give variety 
and some differences in the effect, may be used not 
only in the two positions of the trunk indicated but in 
others, such as.in prone lying on the table, or with the 
trunk over the end of the table, or sitting on a stool or 
plinth with the feet fastened down and the trunk 
slightly inclined backward. They must be given care-
-P-A-G-E-96
98 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
fully and the student thoroughly instructed in the 
correct use of her trunk in the different positions so 
that she will not increase any faulty conditions of 
posture which she may have. 
  Exercise XIV. For the Back of the Neck, the Shoul- 
ders, and Back. 
PURPOSE. ‘To teach control of and to exercise the 
neck and shoulder muscles. 
POSITION. Standing, with the arms down at the 
sides, the body held in correct position, and the ab- 
dominal muscles well contracted. 
EXERCISE. (a) Drop the head and neck forward 
until the chin rests upon the chest. (b) Contract the 
muscles at the base of the neck and upper part of 
the back until the head is erect and the neck in line 
with the spine. (c) Shrug both shoulders upward 
and contract the muscles in the back between the 
shoulder blades. (d) Contract the muscles in the back 
just below the shoulder blades so as to pull the shoul- 
ders down, but at the same time resist the movement 
by a slight contraction of the muscles on top of the 
shoulders. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Rocking the head on the 
neck and thus failing to bring the neck back into the 
correct position. (2) Dropping the shoulders instead 
of drawing them down with the muscles. (3) In- 
creasing the lumbar curve by failing to keep the 
abdominal muscles contracted. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise, like all 
of those in which voluntary muscle control is neces- 
sary, is difficult at first. It should not be used until
-P-A-G-E-97
  FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR CONDITIONS 99 
the student can control her abdominal muscles and 
gluteal muscles. After she has learned to contract 
those muscles voluntarily, the difficulties in this 
exercise, with a little patience on the part of the 
instructor, can easily be overcome. 
Exercise XV. For the Muscles of the Back. 
PURPOSE. ‘To exercise the muscles of the back, par- 
ticularly in the lumbar and sacral regions. 
POSITION. Sitting on a stool, with the hands on the 
hips, the instructor’s hand in the middle of the stu- 
dent’s back. 
EXERCISE. Bend the trunk well forward; then come 
back against resistance. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Dropping the head and 
shoulders forward. (2) Letting the whole trunk sag 
until the back is round. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise can be 
used to good effect with cases of sacroiliac strain, but 
must be given carefully. If there is pain in the 
back, it is best to give the exercise at first without 
resistance and repeat it only a few times. When it 
can be taken without pain or soreness, begin using the 
lightest possible resistance. If there is still no pain, 
increase the number of times of giving the exercise 
and the degree of resistance. If there is a marked 
increase in pain or soreness after taking this or any 
other back exercise, it should be recognized as an 
indication of too heavy work; and the number of times 
of giving and the force used in resisting should be 
decreased. Sometimes it is best to omit the exercise 
for a day or two until the soreness has disappeared 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
     
           100 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  and the student has become less nervous. Then it 
may be given again and given lightly. 
Exercise XVI. Abdominal Exercise 1 (Standing). 
PURPOSE. To strengthen the abdominal muscles, 
to reduce the abdomen, and to stimulate the intestines. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands on the hips. 
EXERCISE. (a) Raise the extended leg forward 
and upward, alternating. (b) Raise the leg with the 
knee bent, straighten the leg and lower it to place, 
alternating, right and left. (c) Lift the bent knee 
with the foot back, extend the leg forward with the 
foot extended, and bring the foot quickly to the floor 
a short step forward. (d) With the knee bent and the 
foot extended, raise the leg and replace, alternating 
right and left. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to keep the body in 
good position. (2) Letting the weight go back upon 
the heels and dropping the head forward. (3) Swaying 
the body from side to side. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. These exercises affect 
the abdominal muscles only slightly. They are 
useful in beginning abdominal work after an opera- 
tion. They can be given in place, or walking forward. 
If (c) is given in place, the foot should be brought down 
to the original position instead of taking a step forward. 
All these exercises can be given slowly or rapidly. 
Exercise XVII. Abdominal Exercise 2 (Hanging). 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise XVI. 
POSITION. Hanging on the stall bars or boom, 
with the hands even.
-P-A-G-E-99
  FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR CONDITIONS 101 
EXERCISE. (a) Bend the knees up, one at a time, 
alternating; then lower to place. Repeat with both 
legs at once. (b) Bend the knees up one at a time, 
straighten the leg, and sink to place. Repeat with 
both legs together. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Wrong position of the hands. 
(2) Letting the body sag down on the arms. (3) 
Dropping the head forward. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. It is best, when giving 
a hanging exercise, to let the student become accus- 
tomed to the hanging position before giving the leg 
or trunk exercises. The hands should grasp the bar 
underneath, with the backs of the hands toward the 
wall, in these exercises. The hands should be well 
apart and there should be enough muscular contrac- 
tion in the arms and back of the shoulders to help to 
bear the weight of the body and to keep it from 
sagging down on the hands and arms. This method of 
giving a hanging exercise is perhaps more difficult, but 
the effect upon the shoulders and chest is much better. 
Exercise XVIII. Abdominal Exercise 3 (Lying on 
the Back). 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise XVI. 
position. Lying on the back on a plinth or mat, 
with the arms stretched over the head or the hands 
back of the neck, on the hips, or down at the sides. 
EXERCISE. (a) Bring the extended leg up as high 
as possible, bend the knee, and lower the leg to place. 
(b) Bring the leg up with the knee bent, straighten the 
leg, and lower it to place. (c) Bring the straight leg 
up and then lower it to place.

      102 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Hollowing the back as the 
legs approach the mat in coming down. (2) Letting 
the trunk be lifted by the weight of the legs. (3) 
Failing to keep the legs in the desired positions. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. In movements (a), 
(b), and (c), if the back hollows as the legs approach 
to about twelve inches from the table, have the 
student drop her legs at that point. At this angle the 
abdominal muscles pull very little and the iliopsoas 
muscles (muscles between the lower part of the spine 
and the thighs), which are attached to the lumbar 
vertebrz, come into play. It is always best to avoid 
an exercise that causes an increase in the lumbar curve. 
Exercise XIX. Abdominal Exercise 4 (Contraction 
and Relaxation). 
PURPOSE. To strengthen the abdominal muscles, to 
reduce the abdomen, and to make the first step 
toward voluntary muscle control. 
PosITION. Lying on the back, with the hands 
clasped across the abdomen. 
EXERCISE. Contract and relax the abdominal mus- 
cles without using the respiratory muscles. Begin 
slowly and later increase the speed of the contractions. 
Count mentally and endeavor to increase the num- 
ber of movements each time of taking the exercise. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Contracting and expanding 
the abdomen with the inhalations and exhalations. 
(2) Contracting and expanding the abdomen by rais- 
ing and lowering the chest. (3) Holding the breath 
during the exercise. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. Many persons find it 
           
 
-P-A-G-E-101
FAULTY ANTEROPOSTERIOR CONDITIONS 103 
  difficult to contract the abdominal muscles volun- 
tarily. When they first try to do so, they raise the 
chest with a strong inhalation or force their shoulders 
backward and their chests up. They lack the power 
of moving separately the muscles of the abdomen and 
those of the chest and shoulders. As voluntary muscle 
control is a very important part of corrective gym- 
nastics, and it is impossible to obtain the best posture 
if the abdominal muscles are relaxed, this exercise may 
be used for the first lesson in muscle control. Proceed 
in this way: (1) Place the student upon her back and 
see that she relaxes all over. (2) With one of her 
hands upon her abdomen, one under her lumbar re- 
gion, direct her to contract her abdominal muscles. 
If the movement that she makes is that of pushing 
back with her shoulders or taking a deep breath, she 
can feel with her hands that the movements have 
neither contracted her abdominal muscles nor flat- 
tened her lumbar spine. (3) After she has learned 
not to make use of incorrect movements, direct her 
to fill her lungs moderately full and hold her breath 
while she tries to push her abdomen out against, 
and to draw it away from, her hand. Continue this 
counting to see how many times it can be done before 
the breath must be relaxed. (4) As the next step, 
have her fill her lungs and, as she contracts and re- 
laxes her abdominal muscles, whistle or blow out the 
air from her lungs. This she should practice until 
she can blow steadily while her muscles contract and 
relax. (5) Have her talk as she takes the exercise, and 
practice this until her breath is not interrupted by the 
movement. (6) Have her breathe naturally, counting

inwardly and continuing the exercise until forced by 
muscle fatigue to stop. 
  Exercise XX. Abdominal Exercise 5. 
PURPOSE. To strengthen the abdominal muscles. 
POSITION. Lying on the back, with the feet fas- 
tened down, (1) hands on the hips, (2) arms crossed over 
the chest, (3) elbows bent and hands back of the neck. 
EXERCISE. Raise the trunk up to a sitting position 
from each of the three positions indicated. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Dropping the head forward. 
(2) Contracting the chest by bringing the shoulders 
forward. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise should be 
given first with the feet fastened down; later, when 
the student’s abdominal muscles are stronger and her 
muscle control is increased, it can be given with the 
féet free. The position of the arms may be changed to 
increase the difficulty of the exercise. The student 
should not be allowed to contract her chest when she 
raises the trunk, but should be assisted by the in- 
structor until her abdominal muscles are strong enough 
to let her keep her trunk in the correct position as she 
comes up. If this exercise is too difficult, the instructor 
may support the body while it goes backward and the 
muscles are being used in eccentric movement, and 
let the student bring the body upright in the concen- 
tric movement of the muscles. 
Exercise XXI. Abdominal Exercise 6. 
PURPOSE. To strengthen the abdominal muscles. 
POSITION. Sitting on a stool, with the toes caught

  under the stall bars, the elbows bent, and the hands 
back of the neck. 
EXERCISE. Incline the body backward, then return 
to the upright position. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. Dropping-the head “and-elbows 
forward and contracting the chest. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. The amount of work 
in this exercise depends upon the angle into which 
the trunk is inclined in the first movement. In this 
exercise, as in the preceding, if the work at first is too 
heavy the head and shoulders fall into an incorrect 
position; so it is best to begin with slight inclination 
backward until the muscles are strong enough to raise 
the body correctly. As all muscles work best when 
contracting, if the muscles are very weak it is better 
at first to support the student’s trunk as it is carried 
backward.

      CHAPTER X 
EXERCISES FOR A SINGLE CURVE 
Lateral curvature of the spine. Lateral curvature 
of the spine, or scoliosis, produces deviations in the 
framework of the body such as uneven shoulders and 
unequal hips. The person so afflicted usually regards 
his lack of symmetry as a first condition and does 
not realize that the real cause of the defect lies in the 
spine. 
A curve is termed “cervical,” ‘‘dorsal,’’ or “lumbar” 
according to the part of the spine in which the con- 
vexity is located and ‘‘left” or ‘‘right’’ according to 
the direction of the convexity. 
A “postural’’ or ‘‘total”’ curve is a deviation of the 
spine to the left or right for its entire length. (For 
an illustration, see page 12.). Such a deviation is 
commonly to the left. For this reason the following 
exercises have been written for a left total curve. 
For a right curve, the exercises should be reversed. 
Shoulder Exercises 
PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISES. To stretch the mus- 
cles on the right side of the trunk, to raise the right 
shoulder, and to lower the left.

HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise must be 
given in the correct fall-out position, with the trunk 
in a line with the rear leg. Keeping the sole of the 
right foot on the floor, pulls down the right hip. 
This is also a good exercise for strengthening the foot. 
Exercise XI.

  CHAPTER XI 
EXERCISES FOR A DOUBLE CURVE 
A double spinal curve. When a case of scoliosis 
exhibits more than one curve the upper one is men- 
tioned first in describing the condition. The exercises 
given below are written for a typical case of right 
dorsal, left lumbar scoliosis. For the opposite curves 
the exercises should be reversed. 
The person striving to correct either a single or a 
double curve should bear in mind the desirability of 
supplementing the exercises by assuming, when at 
rest, such a reclining position as will help toward the 
desired correction. 
Exercise I. 
PURPOSE. To raise the low shoulder.

PURPOSE. To straighten the lumbar curve. 
POSITION. Lying on the back on a plinth. 
EXERCISE. Raise the right leg to about a foot from 
the plinth and hold. 
POSSIBLE ERROR. Not raising the leg to the cor- 
rect height. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. In this exercise the 
foot should be raised to the point where the iliopsoas 
muscle (the muscle between the lumbar vertebre and 
the thigh) will work, and the abdominal muscles 
relax. This point may vary with different persons; 
so, in giving the exercise at first, have the student 
raise both legs and bring them down slowly until she 
feels a pull on the lumbar region. At this point the 
greater part of the weight of the legs is thrown upon 
the iliopsoas muscles, the angle being too great for 
the abdominal muscles. When both legs are at this 
point in their descent, the pull on the two sides of the 
lumbar vertebre brings them forward and increases 
the lumbar curve. With only one leg lifted the ver- 
tebre are drawn to the side. If the weight of the 
leg alone is not enough, a heavy dumb-bell or 
other weight may be suspended from the student’s 
ankle.

of the neck. 
EXERCISE. Bend to the left. 
POSSIBLE ERROR. Failing to keep the body in the 
correct posture. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise can be 
made more forceful if the assistant, after placing one 
hand on the left convexity of the spinal curve and the 
other hand on the opposite shoulder, will push in with 
the hand on the left curve and pull over with the hand 
on the shoulder. 
Exercise VIII. 
PURPOSE. To straighten the lumbar curve.

  CHAPTER XII 
Fiat Foot: Its CAUSE AND TREATMENT 
Importance of preventing flat feet. There is no 
work in corrective gymnastics more important than 
that of the prevention and treatment of flat feet. 
Many students who enter gymnasium classes have 
weak feet. That their feet have never given them 
trouble is no indication that the muscles are normal, 
for many students have never in any way tested the 
strength of their feet. They have done only ordinary 
walking, and have not gone for long tramps or taken 
up heavy sports. Since such students are not 
accustomed to exercising in gymnasium shoes, the 
change from shoes with high heels added to the effort 
to do much more strenuous physical work than they 
have done before, puts a very severe strain upon their 
feet. Therefore, to take up gymnastic or any heavy 
work without strengthening the muscles of the feet or 
learning to use them correctly is unwise, since the 
unwonted exercise strains these muscles and is very 
likely to cause flat feet. 
The feet of all new students should be examined. 
All entering students should have their feet thoroughly 
examined. If there are even slight symptoms of pro- 
nation, if the feet are being used incorrectly, or if the 
shoes are very bad, the students should be given the 
123  
-P-A-G-E-122
124 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
instruction and treatment necessary to prevent them 
from developing foot troubles. 
Treatment should be educational. The treatment 
of weak feet is largely educational. This educational 
work should include instruction as to the formation of 
the foot itself. The lessons should deal with the bony 
structure; the articulations and the part that these 
play in the movements of the feet; the muscles, their 
position and functions. This instruction should be 
given with a skeleton and a muscle chart, so that the 
student may see for herself the formation of the foot 
and the position of the 
muscles. While this in- 
struction is being given, 
each movement should 
SKELETON OF FOOT be demonstrated by the 
instructor and executed 
by the student, both being either in their stocking 
feet or, when advisable, barefooted. (See page 37.) 
After studying the formation of the foot, the stu- 
dent should be taught the correct use of the feet. The 
effect upon the feet of carrying the toes pointed out 
should be taught; and, for demonstration, the bones 
of the foot and leg, the muscle chart, the foot of the 
instructor, and that of the student should be used. 
In the same way she should be taught the effect of 
walking with the feet straight and the difference in 
effect resulting from carrying the weight upon the 
heel and upon the ball of the foot. When this demon- 
stration is given, the influence upon the posture of the 
body of straight feet and correctly borne weight 
should also be pointed out. Finally, the correct 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  FLAT FOOT 125 
method of walking should be demonstrated by the 
instructor and practiced by the student. 
The terms used should be understood. The stu- 
dent should be taught the movements of the feet, such 
as supination, pronation, etc. She should have ex- 
plained to her the meaning of the terms used in speak- 
ing of flat feet, and should be taught to Hropuite the 
symptoms of flat feet, the causes of 
these conditions, and the results of not 
correcting them. 
The student should be taught to 
recognize correct shoes.. The next 
most important subject to be taken up 
is the matter of shoes. Upon the days 
when shoes are to be discussed, it is an 
excellent plan to have the students 
wear their street shoes into the class. 
This is not that the shoes may be crit- 
icized, for the psychological effect of 
such criticism is not always good; it 
is, however, for the purpose of en- 
abling the students themselves to com- : * SOLE OF FOOT 
pare their own shoes with the shoes  yiot6 muscles and 
which are being demonstrated, and to _ tendons that bend 
use their own judgment in deciding meres cere 
whether their shoes meet the re- 
quirements laid down by the instructor. Frequently 
students will ask for a discussion of the shoes that 
they are wearing, expressing a desire for constructive 
  criticism. It is then permissible to point out to them 
the effect upon their feet of undesirable shoes; their 
attention can be drawn to the visible impression of 
     
-P-A-G-E-124
  126 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
bent toes upon a soft shoe and to the fact that, in some 
cases, the feet have spread over the soles because the 
sole is too small for the foot. The effect upon the 
feet of small shoes made of leather too heavy to 
stretch should also be pointed out. 
Material for demonstration. The material for 
demonstration during these talks should be as follows: 
(1) shoes of all types — those with inflare, outflare, 
straight, long and narrow, short 
and broad soles, low heels and 
round toes, high heels and pointed 
toes; (2) pictures and charts show- 
ing the position of the bones of 
the foot when in a correct shoe, 
in an over-narrow shoe, and ina 
shoe that is too short; (3) the 
bones of the foot and leg. In order 
to be of service to the student, 
the instructor should know where 
correct shoes can be bought; for 
POSITION IN waLxinc Mmability. to-find the right sort. of 
The feet should not be footwear is one of the principal 
turnedoutin thisman- reasons why women wear poor 
shoes. Many of the stores do not 
carry correct shoes; and, since they want to sell their 
stock, they either persuade the customer that it 
is impossible to find shoes of the type which she 
wishes or that her feet, being different from those of 
other people, do not require ‘‘sensible’”’ shoes. Now 
it is only natural to think that a man who is special- 
izing in shoes must know more about them than any- 
body else, so both men and women will many times 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  FLAT FOOT 127 
take the salesman’s word, against their own opinion. 
Perhaps some day those who sell shoes will realize 
their responsibility and be unwilling to recommend 
shoes that do not fit. 
Reasons why women do not wear better shoes. 
It is very difficult to induce women to wear shoes 
that do not injure and deform their feet. How 
the custom of wearing improper shoes ever became 
so universal is a cause for wonder. 
It is true, perhaps, that the foot 
looks smaller in the deforming type 
of shoe; and at one time it was 
considered as necessary for women’s 
feet to appear small as for their 
_ waists to be tiny, regardless of what 
injurious means were used to attain 
that result. The present genera- 
tion has, of course, reached the 
point where women can laugh at 
the style in dress of their grand- 
mothers and wonder how they could _ posrrion in waLKING 
think tiny waists beautiful and how The feet should be 
they could endure the discomfort of D! Paraiiel to each 
squeezing the body into an un- 
natural shape. We can only hope that some day it 
will also seem as strange to women that a preceding 
generation should have squeezed and deformed its feet. 
As a matter of fact, there are several reasons for 
the reluctance that women show to changing the 
_ common type of shoes. Among these are the 
following: 
(1) Custom and fashion demand that to be ‘well 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
     128 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  dressed’ a woman must wear high-heeled, narrow-toed 
shoes. She is conspicuous in a larger shoe, except 
when wearing sport clothes. 
(2) It is impossible to buy an evening shoe of any 
but the type indicated above. 
(3) Many of the so-called ‘‘common sense’’ shoes 
are anything but sensible so far as the ordinary foot 
is concerned, giving as much discomfort as more 
fashionable shoes, if not more. 
(4) Women as a rule do not understand why the 
narrow shoe is injurious nor recognize a good shoe 
when they find it, and they are not helped by the 
shoemakers so to understand. 
(5) Many women have tried to change from high 
heels to low, with resulting discomfort, not realizing 
that an intermediate change is necessary, so that the 
muscles of the feet and legs may become gradually 
accustomed to the difference in position. 
Demands of custom and fashion. To solve the first 
difficulty it will be necessary to do two things: to 
change the fashion in evening shoes — an innova- 
tion which may come but slowly — and to convince 
women of the inappropriateness of wearing with street 
costume a shoe of the same style as that which they 
would wear with evening dress. 
Difficulty in buying correct shoes. The second diffi- 
culty will never be met until shoemakers consent to 
make shoes of fine soft materials, suitable for evening 
wear, but of correct shape. For this state of affairs 
it is not just to hold the shoe dealers entirely respon- 
sible. They must provide shoes that the public will 
wear; and until women meet them at least half way,      
   
-P-A-G-E-127
  FLAT FOOT 129 
they cannot afford to stock up with different shoes. 
This difficulty will probably be met as that of the 
walking shoe is being met. Since the demand for 
better shoes has been growing, the supply has gradu- 
ally increased, slowly and with apparent reluctance on 
the part of the shoe dealers, but fast enough to indi- 
cate the changes that are coming. 
First type of “common sense” shoe. The first reac- 
tion against the small narrow shoe resulted in the 
“common sense” shoe, which was really an imitation 
of a man’s shoe and was planned along the same lines. 
The characteristics of ‘‘common sense” shoes were as 
follows: flat heels, wide toes, no support under the 
arch of the foot, sizes that were too large, and leather 
that was not suited to a delicate skin. Most of the 
women who tried to wear these shoes had, as a result, 
more trouble with their feet than they had ever ex- 
perienced before. The change from high heels to flat 
ones strained the muscles of the feet and legs and in 
many cases started flat feet. The feet slipped forward 
in shoes that were much too big and that did not 
support the arch; asa result, there was pressure upon 
the ends of the toes, causing hallux valgus (displace- 
ment of the great toe) and other toe deformities. In 
addition, the heavy leather rubbed and blistered the 
feet. Thus the woman who had sacrificed her pride 
to wear shoes that were supposed to keep her feet 
comfortable, made up her mind that either such shoes 
were not sensible or that her feet were different from 
those of others, and that she would, in future, wear 
the high heels and narrow toes to which she was 
accustomed. Fortunately, the old type of ‘‘common
-P-A-G-E-128
130 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
sense”’ shoe is rapidly disappearing, and a better shoe 
is taking its place. Each year more and more women 
are learning that it is possible to be fitted with shoes 
which, though following the natural outlines of the 
feet, are not too heavy nor too flat and big — that the 
feet can present a trim, neat appearance in shoes that 
  X-RAY PICTURE OF FEET IN PROPERLY FITTING SHOES 
have neither French heels nor narrow, pointed toes. 
Women entirely ignorant about shoes. Most 
women do not understand the points which should be 
considered in buying a shoe. They know nothing of 
the formation of the feet, of the effects upon the
-P-A-G-E-129
  FLAT FOOT 131 
feet of shoes that are too small, what causes a corn or 
bunion, or why the arches of their feet become weak 
and painful. They hardly associate these conditions 
with their shoes; or, if they do, they leave it entirely 
to the salesman to tell them what type of shoe they 
ought to buy in order to prevent or cure these condi- 
tions. Perhaps they buy arch supports and a longer 
  X-RAY PICTURE OF FEET IN IMPROPERLY FITTING SHOES 
shoe; perhaps they have their feet treated by a 
chiropodist, and, feeling temporary relief and not un- 
derstanding the serious conditions that may develop, 
see no need of changing the shape or style of their 
shoes. To meet this ignorance, two things are neces- 
sary: education of wearers of improper shoes, and 
education of the shoe salesman, not only in regard to  
-P-A-G-E-130
132 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  feet, the correct lines of shoes, and the evil effects of 
unsuitable arch supports, but also as to the grave 
responsibility which is his. Just as it is frequently the 
dressmaker who realizes the beginning of uneven 
shoulders and hips, it is the shoe salesman who, in 
most cases, is first to note and be consulted about foot 
troubles. Hence, if he does not make an effort to 
provide shoes that really fit — shoes that will prevent 
bad foot conditions — or if he does not impress upon 
his customers the necessity for consulting an ortho- 
pedic surgeon so that weakened feet may be cured 
before their condition becomes serious, he is evading 
his responsibility. 
Effect upon the feet of high-heeled and narrow- 
toed shoes. A high heel crowds the foot forward into 
the shoe, causing the toes to be cramped against the 
end and narrow sides of the shoe, so that the greater 
part of the body weight, instead of being borne on 
the ball, comes on the inside of the foot. Furthermore, 
since a small high heel does not properly support the 
weight, the ankle twists and turns as the weight is 
thrown upon it. With heels too high, the knees are 
held in partial flexion and are not used correctly in 
walking. Finally, when the foot is too far forward 
and the knees too much bent, it is impossible to hold 
the body in correct posture. The narrow-toed shoe 
is the cause of still other disorders. In the first place, 
compressing and distorting the toes of the foot as it 
does, it causes them to bend and overlap. This bend- 
ing of the toes forces the joints out of position and 
against the sides of the shoe, in which position the 
toes are rubbed at the joints so that corns and bunions
-P-A-G-E-131
  FLAT FOOT 133 
are formed. Again, since the toes, compressed and 
distorted, are not able to move, the muscles controlling 
them become so weakened from lack of use that finally 
a fallen anterior arch is the result. In addition, the 
joints of the toes are forced out of position, the muscles 
are strained, and the nerves pinched at the joints. 
And since, with the front part of the foot held motion- 
less, it is most difficult to walk with the feet straight 
forward, the toes are turned out more and more, while 
the inward rotation of the knees is increased. With 
the feet turned out, the weight of the body is thrown 
on the lateral arch, the muscles of which, unexercised 
and unable to bear the unnatural weight thrown upon 
them, become strained and weak. The result is flat 
feet. 
Effects of making a sudden change in height of 
heels. One of the causes of flat feet that is given by 
many orthopedic surgeons is a sudden change from 
tight, high-heeled shoes to broad, low-heeled shoes. 
The muscles of the leg have, up to the moment of 
change, been held in a shortened position and have 
. therefore contracted to take up the sag. Similar 
changes have taken place in the muscles of the feet. 
If the support of the high heel is suddenly removed and 
the muscles put into a stretched position, the result is 
that they are so stretched and strained that the feet 
and legs become weak and painful. The sufferer is 
therefore convinced that it was a mistake to change 
from high heels. If, however, the change had 
been made gradually, and the muscles of the feet and 
legs stretched with exercises, the results would have 
been good instead of evil. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
134 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  Points to be considered in fitting shoes. A prop- 
erly fitting shoe must have the shape of the foot upon 
which it is to be worn. The old idea that all shoes 
must have a straight last is rapidly changing. Now 
it is known that there are at least three types of feet: 
the inflare, the outflare, and the straight. If an inflare 
shoe is fitted to an outflare foot, the consequences can 
only be disastrous, for an inflare shoe does not give 
room for the little toes of the outflare foot, nor will a 
straight last fit either the inflare or the outflare foot. 
There are many varieties of each of the three types of 
feet. Among these are the long, narrow foot with 
long toes and either a high lateral arch, or a low long 
arch; the short, broad foot with short toes and high or 
low lateral arch; the foot with small narrow heel or 
big broad heel; and the foot with narrow heel and 
broad anterior, or wide heel and narrow anterior. 
To fit all feet with one style of ‘‘correct’’ shoe is, as 
can readily be seen, an absolute impossibility. Here 
again the knowledge and responsibility of the shoe 
salesman comes in; he should be able to recognize a 
foot that is not of the type to be fitted by the shoes 
which he handles, and his sense of responsibility and 
good salesmanship should be such as to make him 
tell his customer not to buy from him, but to go 
where the right type is to be found. It is becoming 
the custom to give names to the special types of 
shoes; hence, those who treat weak feet should learn 
the various shapes and names of these shoes and be 
able not only to instruct their students or patients as to 
the correct type of shoe for their feet, but also to give 
them the special name of the shoe that they need.

  136 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
‘The shoe must fit closely in the heel in order that 
the foot shall not slip up and down. It must fit the 
lateral arch. If the arch in the shoe is too high it 
presses unnecessarily upon the foot; if it is too low 
it does not give sufficient support. The arch should 
be long enough, but not too long, as the continuation 
of the lift in the arch of the shoe beyond that in the 
foot causes the leather to press upon the joint of the 
great toe and may inflame or blister the joint. The 
vamp of the shoe should be neither too long nor too 
- short, for if the vamp of the shoe rubs the foot it 
may blister and inflame the foot and cause permanent 
injury to the muscles and tendons of the toes. 
The shoe should be of correct length. It should, of 
course, be long enough to extend well beyond the ends 
of the toes, but a shoe which is so long that it does not 
fit in such places as the arch and vamp is not a well- 
fitting shoe. Many people buy their shoes long with 
the idea that they can, in this way, wear a narrow, 
pointed toe without injury. It may be possible to do 
so if there are no other complications; but care must 
be taken to see that the shoe is long enough for the 
toes to have room to spread, that the vamp and arch 
are suitable to the foot, and that the high heel is not 
causing the foot to slip down into the shoe until the 
toes are as close to the end of the shoe as they would 
be if the shoe were too short. 
Flexible shaft. Many people advocate a flexible 
shaft in a shoe. In theory, or for a perfectly normal 
foot, the lack of support of the flexible shaft may do no 
harm, particularly if the heel is low. With a very 
weak foot, however, this lack of support does make
-P-A-G-E-135
  FLAT FOOT 137 
a difference. Such shoes, therefore, are not always 
advisable, nor are they best for stout persons. These 
shoes frequently give just in front of the heel of the 
shoe, forcing the heel slightly backward and hence 
straining the muscles of the foot at that point. 
Weight of the shoe must be suitable. The weight of 
the leather should also be considered. It should be 
light for warm weather and for wearing in the house 
and heavier for cold weather or for walking, particu- 
larly for walking over rough ground. Another con- 
sideration is that, whereas some people can wear 
heavy leather without tiring or blistering their feet, 
others, under the same conditions of weather and sur- 
roundings, find heavy leather impossible. Leather 
must, therefore, be suitable to the skin and endurance 
of the individual. This, of course, does not mean 
that thin kid and suede shoes or slippers should be 
worn out of doors during the winter or in rain and 
snowstorms, for such shoes are meant chiefly for house 
wear. 
Wearing oxfords in winter. Oxfords and other low 
shoes were undoubtedly intended for summer wear, 
and in many ways they seem more appropriate to 
that season. But there is no reason why they cannot 
be worn in winter if the ankle is protected by woolen 
stockings or by spats which shed water, since the 
main purpose of the high boot for winter use is to 
protect the ankle. Unfortunately, there are always 
some who, when imitating a custom of this kind, fail 
to realize the importance of paying attention to the 
sensible side of the matter. Adopting the custom of 
wearing low shoes during the winter, these people,  
-P-A-G-E-136
  138 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
instead of protecting the ankles as they should, wear 
thin silk stockings out of doors, or frequently instead 
of oxfords wear thin suede and kid slippers. To do so 
indicates a lack of judgment and often results in colds 
and more severe illnesses. 
Wearing arch supports. One point which is much 
neglected in the education of people with weak feet 
is instructing them as to the weakening effect of arch 
supports upon the feet. In every gymnasium in 
which weak feet are treated, some are found, even 
among young girls, who, for longer or shorter periods, 
have worn arch supports. Unfortunately, this time 
often extends into years before the discovery is 
made that their feet are being injured by the use of 
these. Such supports are most often, though not 
always, given to them by shoe fitters; but, of course, 
there are many suffering from tired and painful 
feet who, seeing arch supports advertised, or hearing 
of some one who is using them, voluntarily buy 
and wear them, little guessing the evil effects the 
use may have upon the muscles and ligaments of the 
feet. Such statements as the following are common: 
“T had a pair of shoes that hurt me, but the sales- 
man told me that I could wear the shoes if I would 
use a pair of supports in them.” 
“My feet used to get very tired, so I bought these 
in a shoe store. They seemed to help at first, but 
sometimes now I feel as if they had made my feet 
worse.” 
“One of my insteps hurt and a friend told me that 
arch supports would help me. As they sell them in 
pairs, and I had to buy two, I just used them both.”
-P-A-G-E-137
  FLAT FOOT. 139 
“T had flat feet, and as the advertisement said that 
the arches would cure flat feet, I bought them. But 
I can’t say that I think they cure, for my feet are 
very weak still.” 
After a corrective class has been told what very un- 
desirable conditions are likely to follow the use of 
arch supports unless the feet are treated at the same 
time, many students will admit that what has been 
described as the result of a protracted use of arch 
supports is just what has occurred in their particular 
cases. 
In view of this, does it not seem that the promiscu- 
ous sale of arch supports should be forbidden? The 
fact that they are often injurious is well known — 
especially the arch support that does not fit. And 
why should shoe salesmen and chiropodists be allowed 
to prescribe this particular splint, whether useful or 
injurious, when they would not be allowed to apply 
splints for any other injury or disease? Is flat foot 
such a minor ailment that those suffering from it do 
not need protection from the untrained practitioner? 
Even now, however, there is one way to protect peo- 
ple against the improper use of these supports, and 
that is to educate them in the use and abuse of this 
form of treatment. 
Benefits to be derived from arch supports. Pri- 
marily, arch supports are intended to assist, tempo- 
rarily, the arches of a foot in which the muscles, so 
weak that they are no longer able to give the necessary 
support, are being further strained by the weight 
which they are not able to carry. In the second place, 
arch supports are useful in relieving the pain that so  
-P-A-G-E-138
140 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  frequently accompanies this strain upon the muscles. 
In the third place, the supports hold the bones of the 
foot in place, so that the muscles, no longer strained, 
have a better chance to recover their tone. While 
the arch support is being worn, the foot should be 
regularly exercised so that the support may eventually 
be dispensed with altogether. 
Injurious effects of arch supports. The pressure of 
the arch support 
against the muscles of 
the foot, unless the 
muscles are being 
exercised in some spe- 
cial way, interferes 
with the. circulation 
and the play of the 
muscles and finally so 
increases muscle weak- 
ness as to cause atro- 
phy. Asupport which 
does not fit throws 
the foot into an un- 
natural position and does not help in any way to 
correct muscle weakness. 
An arch support should fit. The arch supports 
which are put on the market for general sale are not 
adapted to individual feet. Furthermore, many of 
these supports are made of steel, a material which 
yields very little when the weight is put on the feet. 
The least injurious of the ready-made arches are 
probably those made of leather or rubber; but as these 
do not give so much support as the steel arches, many     X-RAY PICTURE OF ANKLE AND BONY 
ARCH
-P-A-G-E-139
  FLAT FOOT M41 ¢ 
consider them less satisfactory. As to the shape of 
these ready-made supports, they are made in the 
various sizes of the shoes, but the differences in the 
height or length of the lateral arch, or any other indi- 
vidual characteristics, are not considered. Few people 
seem to realize that, to be of any benefit, an arch sup- 
port should be made for the one who is to use it, and 
that the making and fitting of it should be done only 
by a specialist who thoroughly understands such work. 
Arch supports should be prescribed by nobody but 
an orthopedic surgeon; and after they are made, he 
should fit them himself in order to see that they are 
absolutely right. Most orthopedic surgeons them- 
selves take the impression of the feet in plaster, prepare 
casts for the instrument maker, cause the latter to 
make, from these casts, supports in some soft ma- 
terial, and then mold and fit these supports to the 
feet of their patients until satisfied that they are 
correct. Finally, they have these carefully fitted 
supports copied in steel or some other firm material. 
Getting accustomed to and leaving off arch sup- 
ports. Those who are just beginning to wear arch 
supports should wear them first in the house, and even 
there for only a short period at a time. If they are 
worn a long time without rest, the pressure upon the 
foot is often most uncomfortable, sometimes even pain- 
ful. After they have been worn for a while in the 
house, they may be worn outside, but at first on short 
walks only. When the wearer has really become 
accustomed to them, they may, of course, be worn con- 
tinuously. The same care must be taken in leaving 
them off. They should first be left off for short  
-P-A-G-E-140
    142 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
periods in the house, then for short walks. Finally, 
they may be left off entirely, or used only if the feet 
are very tired. If dispensed with too suddenly, the 
muscles of the feet and legs may become so strained 
as to be very painful. 
Causes of flat feet. The causes of flat feet are as 
as pointing out the toes, with, as a consequence, the 
weight thrown too much on the lateral arches and a 
restricted” use of 
the muscles; con- 
stant standing, as 
in the case of 
nurses, bank 
clerks, and police- 
men; excessive 
weight, particu-

NO HEEL IS WORN ON SHOE rapidly; ill health, 
resulting in general

of heels; injury from jumping in the gymnasium or 
during games; unaccustomed exercise, such as in long 
tramps. 
Examination of the feet. A student should be ex- 
amined in a standing position, with the feet uncovered. 
The first point to be considered is the position of the 
foot, whether it is straight or pronated, and if pro- 
nated, to what degree. The easiest way to determine 
this is to examine the feet from behind. In the nor- 
mal foot, correctly held, the tendo Achillis forms a 
straight line down to the heel. If the foot is pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
FLAT FOOT 143 
  nated, the tendon turns out at the lower end. The 
sagging down and in at the ankle of the pronated foot 
can also be seen. Next determine the degree of sag- 
ging which has taken place in the lateral arch. To 
do this the foot must be examined first without, and 
then with, the weight upon it. All feet flatten to some 
degree as the body weight is put upon them, but a 
weak foot flattens too much. The next step in the 
examination is to 
have the student 
walk first from and 
then toward the in- 
structor so that the 
manner in which the 
feet are used may 
be seen and also 
whether the ankles 
bend in as she walks. 
The toes should be

noticed, for crooked WHEN A HIGH HEEL IS WORN 
bent toes are an 
almost infallible indication of a flat anterior arch. The 
feet must also be examined for calluses and corns, as 
a callus under the anterior part of the foot is another 
symptom of flat anterior arch (see page 146), while 
calluses at the sides of the feet show faulty weight 
bearing and improper shoes. Corns also indicate im- 
proper shoes. The appearance of the muscles should 
be noted, to see if they are flabby or swollen. The 
student should be questioned as to pain or weakness 
in the feet or ankles and as to tendency to cramps in 
the legs or feet or severe sprains in the ankles. 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  144 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
The knees must also be examined. When the feet 
are used correctly, the patella is directly in line with 
the feet; that is, a plumb line dropped from the an- 
terior crest of the ilium will pass through the middle 
of the patella and between the two inner toes or just 
inside the great toe. When the feet are turned out- 
ward the knees turn out, too, for the knees and feet 
normally point the same way; but when the feet have 
been carried incorrectly until they become weakened

and pronated, a change also takes place in the knees 
and they gradually return to the forward position. As 
the knees rotate in, the tibia and fibula (bones of the 
leg), pressing upon the astragalus (the bone in the 
foot upon which the leg bone reSts), turn it slightly in 
its socket and press it in and down. The outward 
rotators in the thighs become somewhat elongated and
-P-A-G-E-143
  FLAT FOOT 145 
the relative positions of the knees and feet are changed, 
so that if the feet are placed parallel the knees are 
rotated inward, but if the outward rotators of the 
knees are contracted, the centers of the knees are 
brought to the front, the inner borders of the feet are 
lifted, and a large part of the pronation is corrected. 
For this reason, it is very important, when treating 
the feet, to teach the student to keep the outward

POSITION OF KNEES AND FEET 
rotators of her knees contracted as much as possible 
and to give her exercises to strengthen these muscles. 
Treatment of weak feet. An important part of the 
treatment of weak feet consists of exercises, for it is by 
this means that we can restore strength to the weakened 
muscles. Such exercises should, of course, be given 
under supervision. In a corrective gymnasium it is
-P-A-G-E-144
  146 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
much better to have all foot exercises taken in a 
class which is under the direct supervision of the 
instructor in charge. With flat feet, one of the 
defects to be overcome is perverted muscle sense with 
a resulting loss of muscle control. This defect makes 
it difficult to execute exercises with correct technique. 
The instructor must, therefore, watch the students’ 
feet closely as the exercises are performed, stopping 
an exercise at the least 
deviation from the cor- 
rect movement. 
A second reason for 
this class supervision is 
that the amount of 
work done must be 
regulated. As a rule, 
muscle soreness after 
exercise is not a serious 
condition, but muscle 
soreness after foot exer- 
cises is undesirable; for, 
while soreness in those

A FLAT ANTERIOR ARCH occasionally used makes 
but little difference, in 
the case of the feet, which must be used constantly 
throughout the day, soreness in the muscles will fatigue 
the whole body. The exercises, therefore, should at 
first be few in number and of a mild degree. As the 
feet strengthen, the number and nature of the exer- 
cises may be changed. Through the entire course of 
treatment, the condition of the feet between the class 
     
-P-A-G-E-145
  FLAT FOOT 147 
hours should be carefully considered in order that the 
effect of the exercises upon the student may be prop- 
erly gauged. Again, if, during the class hour, a student 
complains of unusual fatigue, or of cramps in the 
muscles of her feet or legs, she should be allowed to 
stop and rest while the class finishes the exercise. 
Finally, when a student understands the correct way 
in which the exercises should be done as well as the 
importance of doing them correctly, she should be 
asked to practice them daily in her home — but cer- 
tainly not until she can do them correctly without 
supervision. ' 
Stimulating the muscles with baths. To alternate 
hot and cold baths is one of the most effectual means 
of stimulating the muscles and relieving pain and 
fatigue. These baths are taken in the following man- 
ner: Fill a pail or bowl, or a small tub, with hot 
water and set it inside the bathtub. Then, while 
sitting on the side of the tub, turn on the cold water 
faucet, so that the foot can first be held under the cold 
water, then dipped into the hot water. Alternate 
this process from fifteen to twenty times, letting the 
feet stay in the cold water until they feel cold and in 
the hot water until they are hot. If it is more con- 
venient, two tubs or pails may be used, one filled with 
hot water, one with cold. 
This type of bath is of much greater benefit than a 
simple hot bath; for, while hot water relaxes the 
muscles and expands the small blood vessels, with the 
alternation of cold and hot, there is first a contraction, 
theri an expansion, so that the walls of the small
-P-A-G-E-146
    148 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
blood vessels are really exercised and the circulation 
increased. By means of this improved circulation the 
muscles are stimulated and the pain is lessened. 
Massage for the feet. Massage is helpful in 
strengthening the muscles in the feet and legs and to 
decrease muscle soreness and fatigue. 
Strapping the feet. Pain and fatigue may be re- 
lieved by strapping the feet with adhesive plaster. 
If the feet are in a serious condition, or if there has 
been an accident or injury, this strapping should be 
done only by a surgeon. If 
the feet are merely weak and 
are being treated by an in- 
structor in physical educa- 
tion, simple strappings may 
be applied. For the lateral 
arch, adhesive plaster may 
be used in the following 
STRAPPED ANTERIOR arcues Manner: Start at the inner 
AND BUNION PROTECTED BY border of the tibia, well above ADHESIVE PLASTER we 
the ankle; bring the strap 
over the front of the ankle and the external malleolus, 
then carry it down under the foot, just in front of the 
heel, to the internal malleolus; at this point, carry it 
across in front of the ankle and attach the end of the 
plaster to the outer side of the leg. For pain in the 
anterior arch a two-inch strap may be adjusted as 
follows: Starting on top of the foot, put the strap of 
adhesive plaster around just below the joint of the 
great toe; carry it under the foot and up below the 
joint of the little toe, drawing it rather closely and 
fastening it on top of the foot so that there isa gap rc) | 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  FLAT FOOT 149 
between the last end and the first; if necessary, a 
second strap, slightly overlapping the ends of the first 
strap, may be put on further up toward the ankle. 
Treatment of calluses, corns, and bunions. Cal- 
luses, corns, and bunions may be protected by adhesive 
plaster in the following manner: Cut a round 
or oblong piece of adhesive plaster according to the 
part that is to be protected. Cut a hole in the plaster 
just large enough to allow the part to be protected to 
protrude. Apply two or three, or even four, pieces of 
the plaster, building it up to a level with the part to 
be protected; cut little slashes in the edges of the 
plaster so that each may be made to fit. This type 
of protection is better than the ordinary corn and 
bunion plasters; it does not injure the skin at the edges 
as many corn plasters do, because it can be made of 
any height and is shaped to fit smoothly. Calluses 
and corns should not be cut. They should be treated 
with corn salves and then protected. But, if they 
must be cut, the work should be done by a physician 
who will use the necessary means to prevent infection, 
both during the cutting and as long as the wound 
remains open.

  CHAPTER XIII 
Foot EXERCISES 
Exercises to Be Taken Sitting 
Exercise I. 
PURPOSE. To make the feet more flexible. 
POSITION. Sitting on a low stool, with the knees 
crossed, the right knee on top. The right ankle is 
grasped by the right hand, while the left hand grasps 
the toes and the lower part of the right foot, the 
thumb pressing in on the anterior arch. Reverse the 
position for exercise of left foot. 
EXERCISE. (a) Pull the foot straight down and 
stretch it, at the same time pressing in with the 
thumb. Flex the foot well up and stretch again. 
(b) With the foot flexed, supinate it with the hand. 
(c) Starting with the foot flexed, pull it down, in, and 
up, making a semicircle inward. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. In (a) and (b), pronating the 
foot too much in the downward pull. In (c), starting 
from the extended position. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This is a good exercise 
to use if there is any stiffness in the feet and ankles. 
The movements should be made with the hand, not 
with the muscles of the foot and leg; that is, it should 
be a purely passive movement. 
150
-P-A-G-E-149
FOOT EXERCISES 151 
  Exercise II. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the supinators of the feet 
and to increase muscle control. 
POSITION. The legs stretched out forward and the 
ankles flexed. 
EXERCISE. Stretch the feet down, in, and up, 
making a semicircle inward, and concentrating the 
movement in the ankles. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Pronating the feet. (2) Let- 
ting the movement take place in the legs. 
Exercise III. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the supinators of the feet 
and to increase muscle control. 
POSITION. The legs stretched out forward and the 
feet flexed. 
EXERCISE. Turn the feet in (supinate), with the 
soles together and the toes contracted. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Extending the foot. (2) 
Rotating the legs out. 
Exercise IV. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the extensors and flexors of 
the feet and to increase muscle control. 
PosITION. The legs extended forward and the feet 
flexed. 
EXERCISE. Extend the feet well down and push 
down with the toes. Flex the feet well up and push 
down with the heels. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. Allowing the feet to swing out 
into pronation in pushing down or into pronation at 
the last when the foot is thoroughly flexed.
-P-A-G-E-150
  152 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. These three exercises 
(II, IlI, and IV) should be used regularly, for they 
not only exercise the muscles of the feet but are of 
real value in training to muscle control and in increas- 
ing correct muscle sense. After the feet have been 
used incorrectly for a long time there is a loss of 
muscle control and a perverted muscle sense which 
makes it very difficult to move them correctly. At 
first the student should be required to watch her feet 
carefully so that the movements may be correctly 
done. Later she should do the exercises without 
watching, making the same effort for correct work. 
The instructor should supervise the work and instantly 
check the student if the position of the feet becomes 
incorrect. 
Exercise V. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the muscles of the toes and 
of the anterior part of the foot. 
POSITION. Same as in Exercise IV. 
EXERCISE. (a) Keep the feet flexed and flex and 
relax the toes. (b) Extend the feet and flex and relax 
the toes. 
Exercise VI. 
PURPOSE. To teach the muscle control necessary to 
rotate the knees outward. 
POSITION. Sitting, with the legs extended out for- 
ward. 
EXERCISE. (a) Rotate the thighs out, then relax; 
at the same time notice the muscles used. (b) Hold- 
ing the feet close together and keeping them still, so
-P-A-G-E-151
  FOOT EXERCISES 153 
that the rotation will take place in the thighs alone, 
contract in the muscles that are used in the outward 
rotation (a). 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. In (b) if the student 
is unable to hold her feet still, place her feet upon 
your thigh and hold them for her. In order to 
concentrate upon the muscles used in (a), let the 
student place her hands upon her thighs and feel the 
muscles as they contract. After she can voluntarily 
contract her muscles while in a sitting position, let 
her stand and make the same effort in the standing 
position. Repeat this until she can readily control the 
outward rotators of her thighs. Encourage her to 
practice this outward rotation of the thighs whenever 
possible during the day. 
Exercise VII. 
PURPOSE. To strengthen the muscles of the toes 
and anterior part of the foot and to train the feet to 
correct position. 
POSITION. Sitting, with the feet parallel. 
EXERCISE. Stretch the right leg forward, place the 
foot flat upon the floor, and contract the toes as if 
picking up a small object. Return the foot to the 
first position. Do the same exercise with the left foot 
and continue alternating. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to start with the feet 
parallel. (2) Failing to place the heel upon the 
ground before contracting the toes. (3) Failing to 
bring the feet back into correct position. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise can also 
be done in the standing position. Some object, such 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    154 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
as a small marble or rubber eraser, may be used and 
the exercise taken with bare feet. The student should 
be required to bring her feet back without watching, 
so that she may learn to place her feet correctly with- 
out having to look at them. 
Exercises to Be Taken Standing 
Exercise VIII. 
PURPOSE. To teach the student the correct posture

of the feet and knees and encourage her to hold this 
position. 
POSITION; EXERCISE. Stand in front of a mirror 
with the feet straight, the body weight thrown on the 
outer edge sand balls of the feet, the knees slightly ro- 
tated out, and the body in correct position.
-P-A-G-E-153
  FOOT EXERCISES 155 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. . When one is working 
with a case of weak feet, it is best at first to have the 
student exaggerate somewhat the outward roll on the 
edge of the feet, or the voluntary lifting up of the in- 
side of the feet. At the same time she must be taught 
the correct method of standing, and the reasons for the 
exaggerated position should be explained to her. Fre- 
quently badly pronated feet are accompanied with 
inward rotation of the knees, so the knees should be

examined and if they are rotated inward the student 
should be taught to rotate them outward. While do- 
ing this exercise, the student should be encouraged to 
examine her own position and to ask questions. Better 
results can be reached in every case if the student un- 
derstands, not only her own condition, but exactly 
what she is working for, and why.  
-P-A-G-E-154
    156 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
Exercise IX. 
PURPOSE. To give general exercise to the feet, par- 
ticularly the flexors and extensors. 
POSITION. Standing, with the heels out, the toes 
pointing in. 
EXERCISE. Rise to tiptoes, then on the heels ;with 
toes lifted, rocking forward and backward. " 
Exercise X. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the extensors and supinators 
of the feet. 
POSITION. Same as in Exercise IX. 
EXERCISE. Rise to the tiptoes, and in coming down 
roll on the outer edge of the feet, keeping the front 
part of the feet on the floor. 
POSSIBLE ERROR. Failing to keep the front part of 
the foot on the floor when sinking to the heels. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise is a rather 
difficult one to do at first.. The body must be held 
correctly, the balance must be good, and the toes 
must cling to the floor as the feet are gradually brought 
down. It is an exercise which should be given only 
a few times at first as it is likely to make the muscles 
of the feet sore. 
trercise XI. 
PURPOSE. To strengthen the supinators and exten- 
sors of the feet. 
POSITION. Standing, with the feet straight. 
EXERCISE. Rise to the toes and turn the heels in- 
ward while keeping the front part of the feet on the 
floor,
-P-A-G-E-155
  FOOT EXERCISES 157 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (I) Failing to keep the front 
part of the feet on the floor. (2) Turning the toes 
out as the heels are turned in. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. In order to get good 
results from this exercise, it must be done correctly. 
Careful instruction and oversight must be given to the 
student before she can execute it. The two common 
errors, as has been indicated, are to roll on the outer 
edge of the foot, bringing up the great toes from the 
floor, and to use the toes as a pivot as the heels are 
turned in. These can both be prevented by clinging 
to the floor with the toes, thus throwing the work 
upon the correct muscles. 
Exercise XII. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the muscles of the toes and 
the anterior part of the foot. 
POSITION. Standing on a book, board, or stool, with 
the toes extended over the edge. 
EXERCISE. Contract the toes over the edge of the 
book, board, or stool. 
Exercise XIII. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the flexors and extensors of 
the foot and to rest the muscles after other foot work. 
POSITION. Standing, with the feet straight. 
EXERCISE. (a) Stretch the left foot forward with 
the toe pointing and touch the floor. Return to 
position, without putting the weight on the foot. 
(b) Stretch the foot out at the side and touch the 
floor with the toe. Return to first position, without 
putting the weight on the foot. (c) Stretch the foot 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  158 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
backward and touch the floor with the toe. Return 
to the first position and rest the weight upon the foot. 
Repeat, alternating the feet. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to extend the leg and 
foot well. (2) Resting the weight upon the foot when 
it is brought back to the side in (a) and (6). (3) Failing 
to keep the balance and correct posture. 
Exercise XIV. 
PURPOSE. To stretch the muscles of the feet andi 
legs, particularly the muscles in the back of the legs. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands on the hips, 
the feet straight. 
EXERCISE. Bend the knees as far as possible, keep- 
ing the heels down. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to keep the heels on 
the floor. (2) Turning the toes out. (3) Not keeping 
the body in correct posture. 
Exercise XV. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the supinators of the feet. 
POSITION. Standing, with the feet parallel. 
EXERCISE. Roll on the outside of the feet, curling 
the toes down and in. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to keep the toes 
down. (2) Using the muscles of the thigh. 
Exercise XVI. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the supinators of the feet. 
EXERCISE. Rise to heels and, holding the toes 
curled downward, swing them well in and then down 
on the floor. The weight of the body should be thrown 
on the outer edges of the feet,
-P-A-G-E-157
  FOOT EXERCISES 159° 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. While doing this exer- 
cise, the student must not be allowed to get her body 
into an incorrect posture. In order to keep her balance 
she may bend her trunk somewhat forward but she 
must keep her head and chest up. With an exercise of 
this type it is sometimes well to allow the student at 
first to steady herself by holding to a table or stall bar 
until she can do the exercise and keep her balance 
and posture without that support. 
Exercise XVII. 
PURPOSE. To exercise the outward rotators of the 
knees and to bring up the inner side of the feet. 
EXERCISE. Standing, with the feet straight, rotate 
the knees outward. : 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (I) Stiffening the knees back- 
ward. (2) Bending the knees. (3) Letting the feet 
come up from the floor. (4) Using the muscles of the 
feet instead of those of the thigh. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise is a rather 
difficult one for many persons. Nearly always when 
the first effort to stand erect is made the knees are 
forced too far back. Sometimes it is done with the 
belief that this is the correct thing to do, sometimes 
merely because of the unnatural effort that is being 
exerted. But it is possible by practice to learn to 
stand and to hold the knees rotated outward while 
they are in a position between extension and slight 
flexion; that is, in an ‘“‘easy”’ position. As this exer- 
cise is being taken, it is well to draw the attention of 
the student to its effect upon her feet. If it is not pos- 
sible at first to do the exercise in the standing position,

it can be done seated. This will help to give the stu- 
dent the correct muscle control, but of course the 
exercise does not have the same effect upon the feet 
as when the weight is on them. 
Exercise XVIII. 
Stand with the feet straight, bend the knees, sepa- 
rate them well out, then come back to position, 
keeping the feet well on the floor. 
Exercise XIX. 
Stand with the heels out, toes in. Bend the knees, 
separate them well out, then come up to position, 
keeping the toes on the floor. 
Exercise XX. 
EXERCISE. Stand with the hands on the hips. Fall 
out forward on the right foot, right toes slightly 
turned in, those of the left foot straight. Bend the 
forward knee well down, stretching the muscles in the 
rear leg as much as possible. Repeat, with left foot 
forward. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Failing to keep the heel of 
the rear foot straight. (2) Allowing the heels to rise 
as the knees are bent further down. (3) Failing to 
keep the body in a good position. 
Exercise XXI. 
EXERCISE. Stand facing the wall or stall bars. 
Keeping the feet straight and heels down, lean forward 
and rest the hands on the wall. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise is the 
more strenuous the further the student stands from
-P-A-G-E-160
  162 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
the wall. As in the other exercises of this type, the 
inclination is to ease up on the muscles by allowing 
the heels to come up from the floor. 
Exercises to Be Taken Walking 
PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISES. These exercises are 
very much like those given above, and their purpose 
can be xeadily understood by referring to Standing 
Exercises. The same foot exercises can be taken in a 
sitting, standing, or walking position to give variety 
and to add to the difficulty of doing and to the amount 
of work required of the muscles in the different posi- 
tions. 
Exercise XXII. 
Walk a line toward the mirror, on tiptoes, with the 
toes in, the heels out. 
Exercise XXIII. 
Walk a line toward the mirror, on the outside edges 
of the feet, with the toes curled down and in, bringing 
the heel of the forward foot close in so that it touches 
the toes of the rear foot. 
Exercise XXIV. 
Raise the heels and walk on the toes. Raise the 
toes and walk on the heels.

  CHAPTER XIV 
VISCEROPTOSIS AND CONSTIPATION 
Visceroptosis. One postural condition which can 
be greatly relieved by corrective exercises is that of 
abdominal, or ak ptosis. In this condition the 
abdominal organs are sagged out of place into posi- 
tions which frequently interfere with their functions. 
The results are likely to be indigestion, constipation, 
pain from pressure upon nerves, strain upon muscles 
and ligaments, excessive and unnatural fatigue, and, 
with women, painful menstruation. 
A diagnosis of this condition can often be made by 
means of an examination of the general posture and 
the shape of the abdomen; but such a diagnosis should 
be, if possible, verified by an X-ray examination of 
the abdominal content. 
In the normal, erect body, the organs are held in 
place by means of support given them as a result of 
the formation and position of adjacent bones and 
muscles. The walls of the abdominal cavity, for 
example, are formed by the spinal column, the 
upper part of the pelvic bones, the diaphragm, and 
the abdominal muscles; and when the body is erect, 
the bones and muscles form ridges or shelves upon 
which the abdominal organs rest, held there securely 
163 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
164 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
  by ligaments, fat, and the pressure of the abdominal 
muscles. Ina faulty posture these supporting shelves 
are out of position and the abdominal muscles are 
relaxed, so that the abdominal organs, lacking support, 
sag down from their positions. The organs in the 
pelvis lie below a ridge formed by the lumbar verte- 
bree, the pelvic bones, and the abdominal muscles. 
When the abdominal organs are held firmly in place, 
the pelvic organs are protected against pressure from 
above; but when the abdominal organs sag down, they 
frequently press upon the pelvic organs and the big 
blood vessels which nourish them. This pressure may 
cause the pelvic organs also to sag out of place, just 
as it may interfere with the blood supply which is 
needed to keep them in a healthy normal condition. 
The correction of visceroptosis. To correct such a 
condition, it is necessary, among other things, to re- 
store the body to its correct position, so that the 
organs may resume their places. If the condition of 
visceroptosis has reached a serious stage, the treat- 
ment should be given under the supervision of a 
physician; for it is frequently necessary to begin this 
treatment with rest, a fattening diet, and exercises 
taken in bed. When, in the opinion of the physician, 
the patient is ready for work in the gymnasium, the 
corrective work should consist of posture exercises, 
knee and chest exercises, and exercises performed 
while lying prone. No jumping or hanging should be 
given, nor should such exercises be used as Exercise 
XII in this chapter. In that and similar exercises, 
the pressure of the ribs and the position of the body 
tend to force the organs downward, whereas all effort
-P-A-G-E-163
VISCEROPTOSIS AND CONSTIPATION 165 
should at this time be directed to bringing them up 
into place. 
If good is to result from these exercises, they must 
be done daily, and this fact should be impressed upon 
the student by the instructor. Especially is it impor- 
tant that those positions which permit the organs to 
fall back into place should each day be held for an 
appreciable length of time. Upon waking, and again 
at night before retiring, the student should give some 
time to this sort of exercise; and when sleeping, she 
should, if possible, lie on her face, with a pillow under 
the middle of her body. Stress should also be con- 
stantly laid on the importance of the exercises for 
posture, since the body must be held erect in order 
that the organs may be held in place. 
Treatment of constipation. The treatment of con- 
stipation should not consist of exercises alone, but 
should include instruction as to the causes of consti- 
pation and in regard to such simple means of over- 
coming the condition as proper diet, the drinking of 
much water, and regularity in habits. At the very 
start, the evil effects of cathartics should be impressed 
upon the student, and she should be made to realize 
the seriousness of chronic constipation, as well as the 
results which follow from it. 
Those of us who work with students in corrective 
gymnastics are at first surprised and shocked at the 
number who suffer from constipation, the variety and 
strength of medicines which they take, and the general 
lack of knowledge which they have on subjects of per- 
sonal hygiene. An instructor in corrective gymnastics 
has a wonderful opportunity to give instructions on
-P-A-G-E-164
    166 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
these subjects. The work with the students enables 
her to learn much about them and their habits; and 
if she has gained their confidence, they will not only 
listen to her advice, but will usually carry it out. 
An instructor should, therefore, inform herself as to 
the correct means of preventing or curing such condi- 
tions as constipation, and she should always be ready 
to listen to and advise the students. Giving medicines 
is not a part of an instructor’s work; if a student 
really needs medicine, she should be sent to a physi- 
cian. But cases of constipation, painful menstruation, 
sleeplessness, and other conditions are frequently 
caused by irregular habits, improper food, or lack of 
exercise, and an instructor may be able to assist a 
student in overcoming these conditions without 
medicine.

  CHAPTER XV 
EXERCISES FOR MENSTRUAL DISORDERS 
An important field for corrective work. In few fields 
of our work have the results of exercises been more 
satisfactory than in the treatment of menstrual 
disorders. We do not assert that this method is 
infallible, for there are many cases of this type into 
which enter such conditions as to make any class 
of exercises undesirable. But experience has shown 
that, in many cases, pain has been relieved, nervous- 
ness at the time of the monthly period done away with, 
and an improved general condition brought about. 
Many girls who enter college with the feeling that, 
because of their menstrual condition, they should be 
excused from all gymnasium work, realize later, after 
taking special exercises, that they have been greatly 
benefited. And many times when, after such treat- 
ment, it has been suggested to a girl that she transfer 
to a regular gymnasium class, she has begged to be 
allowed to continue with the special exercises because 
so great was her former pain that she is anxious to 
prevent its recurrence. 
Thus it happens that, besides the girls who come to 
the corrective gymnasium because the work is obliga- 
tory, many other girls, juniors and seniors, of whom 
no gymnasium work is required, come for exercises, 
170
-P-A-G-E-169
  EXERCISES FOR MENSTRUAL DISORDERS 171 
merely because they have heard of the relief given to 
others through these same exercises. 
Growing belief in this work among physicians. The 
giving of exercises to relieve menstrual disorders is not 
new; for several years it has been practiced in correc- 
tive gymnasiums with good results. Up to a very 
recent date, this practice has not, it is true, been 
generally upheld by physicians. They have seemed 
to feel that too much was claimed for it. Lately, 
however, several articles have been published in 
medical magazines recommending this type of work, 
not only for disordered menstrual conditions, but as a 
means of preparing women for operations upon the 
uterus or of hastening their recovery after such 
operations. 
Dysmenorrhea frequently accompanied by poor 
posture. The majority of girls, who enter corrective 
classes, suffering with painful menstruation, are girls’ 
with poor posture, weak abdominal muscles, and a 
generally poor muscular condition. With these cases, 
the pain and irregularity are, as a rule, caused by 
sagging or misplaced organs which, pressing upon each 
other, interfere with the circulation and cause an in- 
creased congestion at the time of the period. The most 
usual type of misplacement is retroversion, or a 
falling backward of the uterus; and for this condition 
special exercises are given. Anteversion is less com- 
mon, but exercises for this condition are also provided. 
Treatment should include instruction. The treat- 
ment for these cases is very simple. First, the posture 
must be corrected; then the organs must be made to 
return to place and the abdominal muscles must be
-P-A-G-E-170
    172 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
strengthened to aid in holding them. In order to 
relieve congestion, suitable breathing exercises must 
be given, and the student must be advised as to the 
amount of exercise and rest that she should take at 
the time of her menstrual period. Not the least 
important part of this corrective work is the instruc- 
tion that should be given to the girl as to her care of 
herself. Girls appear to know very little about 
themselves; hence many apparently careless things 
which they do can be attributed to ignorance or to a 
lack of appreciation of the importance of what they 
have been told to do or not to do at the time of the 
menstrual period. But, with a clear understanding of 
the reasons for taking care of themselves, they, as a 
rule, are willing and glad to pay attention to the 
things they have been taught. And since many of 
the nervous conditions from which women suffer are 
caused by lack of knowledge, those of us who work 
with girls should be ready to meet with sympathy and 
understanding the questions they put to us. 
Exercises for Correcting Retroversion of the Uterus 
PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISES. To cause the abdomi- 
nal organs to fall back into place, at least temporarily, 
thus relieving the pressure of other organs upon the 
uterus and also increasing the return flow in the vena 
cava. 
Exercise I. 
POSITION. Lie on the face, with a pillow under the 
pelvis so as to raise it above the level of the head and 
shoulders,

HINT TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This position should be 
taken in bed and as far as possible held. throughout 
the night. 
Exercise II. Knee Chest Position. 
POSITION. Kneel upon a plinth or a bed, with the 
knees slightly separated; bend forward and rest the 
chest upon a pillow; then turn the head to one side 
and rest it and the arms upon the plinth or bed. 
EXERCISE. Hold the position and at intervals take 
deep breaths. 
  Exercise III. Prone Lying off a Couch or Chair. 
PosITION. In this exercise the body hangs down 
over the edge of the bed or couch, the head, chest, and 
arms resting upon a pillow on the floor. The legs are 
so placed on the couch that the edge of the couch 
comes just at the bend of the legs; that is, at the 
groin. If the couch is too high, the pillow should be 
on a stool of such height as to let the trunk incline 
down from the bed. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. As this position and 
that in Exercise II are to be held for some time, 
sufficient support must be given by the pillows to 
prevent discomfort. Care must be taken not to 
increase the lumbar curve, as that would result in a 
position not only incorrect, but tiresome and likely 
to cause pain in the back. The upside-down position 
seems an uncomfortable one, but if it is held at first 
for only a few minutes and the time gradually in- 
creased, the student becomes accustomed to it and 
can hold it for some time without discomfort,
-P-A-G-E-173
  EXERCISES FOR MENSTRUAL DISORDERS 175 
The exercise may also be taken in the following way: 
Turn a chair upside down and place one pillow so that 
it lies partly between the rear legs of the chair and 
partly over the back; then place a second pillow partly 
on the back and partly on the floor. Lie down on the 
chair over the pillows so that the body rests upon the 
reversed back of the chair and the legs come between 
the rear legs of the chair. In this position, the feet 
should be supported by a stool or second chair. This 
position can become quite comfortable and can be 
held for a long time, after the student has accustomed 
herself to its upside-downness. Deep breathing 
should be taken at intervals with both the foregoing 
exercises. This exercise and the knee chest position 
should be taken night and morning and, if used at the 
time of menstruation, will frequently relieve pain. 
Exercise IV. 
POSITION. Lying face down. 
EXERCISE. aise the body on the elbows and toes; 
then return to face-down position. Repeat. 
Exercise V. 
POSITION. Rest both hands and feet on the floor, 
with the legs as straight as possible so that the 
trunk will incline downward toward the head. 
EXERCISE. Walk on the feet and hands. 
Exercise VI. Deep Creeping. 
POSITION. Kneel, with the right knee in front, the 
left knee slightly back, the right hand on the floor on 
the outer side of the right knee, and the left arm 
stretched out with the hand on the floor in front of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  176 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
right knee. Twist the head with the face to the 
right, and rotate the trunk with the left shoulder up. 
EXERCISE. (a) Draw the left knee forward to the 
inner side of the left hand. Extend the right arm 
first above the head and then as far in front of the 
left knee as possible. Twist the face to the left. 
(b) Proceed by bringing forward the right knee, ex- 
tending the left arm in front of the right knee, etc. 
Exercise VII. Abdominal Breathing. 
See Chapter XVI, Exercise VII (c). 
Additional Exercises. To Exercises I-VII add posture 
exercises (Chapter VII) and abdominal exercises 
(Chapter VIII). Do not give hanging exercises. 
If the menstrual flow is quite profuse, the pain 
intense, or the girl in a run-down condition, it is well 
not to allow her to take part in any sport, but to 
require, in its place, some hours of rest each day.

  CHAPTER XVI 
BREATHING EXERCISES 
Why breathing exercises areneeded. The majority 
of people, whether because of incorrect posture, faulty 
clothing, or poor general habits, do not use their lungs 
correctly; therefore breathing exercises should be 
considered an important part of corrective work. 
However, it should be borne in mind that breathing 
is a natural process and will be properly done if the 
posture is correct and the body unimpeded. 
Various types of breathing exercises. There is 
much discussion as to the correct method of giving 
breathing exercises. One authority insists that to 
fill the lungs as they should be filled one must imagine 
that he is smelling a flower or some kind of perfume. 
Another points out in this connection, that, in the act 
of smelling forcibly, the nostrils are partly closed, a 
condition which necessarily interferes with the free 
entrance of air. Again it is stated that, in all breath- 
ing exercises, inhalation should be through the nose, 
exhalation through the mouth. The reasons for 
this belief are so far from convincing, it would seem 
that the authorities opposed to it must be correct 
when they teach that both inhalation and exhalation 
should be through the nose. Finally, opposed to the 
idea that ‘‘deep breathing” should be given with all 
177  
-P-A-G-E-176
  178 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
exercises, is the theory that one should breathe as 
nature requires while doing most exercises, and use 
specific deep breathing exercises only in the intervals 
between other exercises and at the end of the period, 
as a means of quieting and resting the whole body. 
To the author, this last-mentioned view seems 
reasonable. 
Breathing exercises of benefit. No matter how 
authorities may differ as to the time and methods for 
giving breathing exercises, there can be no doubt as 
to the benefit which can often be derived from them. 
It must be remembered, however, that breathing 
exercises can be used to excess, just as they can be 
incorrectly given. 
The “Yogi” method. A method that has found 
many advocates is the “ Yogi.” In this method the 
breath must first be drawn to the lower part of the 
lungs, swelling out the abdomen; then the breath must 
fill the middle part of the lungs, pressing out the 
lower ribs; and lastly the chest must be filled and 
swelled out. After the lungs are filled they must be 
emptied in the same way, first: the lower part; 
second, the middle part; third and last, the upper 
part of the lungs. One is assured that, if this method 
is well practiced, it will grow to be quite easy, finally 
becoming established as the natural way of breathing. 
This exercise is generally taken first in a reclining posi- 
tion, and the breath is so controlled that the periods of 
inspiration and exhalation are of equal length. 
Breathing with the body relaxed. In the corrective 
gymnasium, the student should be taught to fill her 
lungs well with each breath, controlling the speed of
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  BREATHING EXERCISES 179 
inhalation and exhalation, but not attempting to place 
the breath in the lungs as in the Yogi or in any other 
formal breathing exercise — just letting it go wherever 
it naturally flows as the lungs become filled. This 
exercise is given while the student is lying on her 
back; and before beginning the breathing exercise, she 
should be taught to relax absolutely. 
Difficulty in relaxing. A great many students do 
not know how to relax during a breathing exercise, 
and are constantly using their muscles to place the 
breath in some one part of their lungs, or, as one 
student put it, ‘‘in some part of the body, such as the 
chest or the abdomen.” Students, who have been 
taught some special method of breathing, have often 
become so accustomed to breathing by that method 
that it is almost impossible for them to take a full 
natural breath. These methods have been used for 
some good reason no doubt, such as, for example, to 
fill the lungs rapidly and empty them slowly as one 
must in singing. But should not these young people 
also have been given breathing exercises for the 
whole lung to enable them to use their lungs correctly 
when they were not singing? Is such a practice not 
equivalent to developing the muscles in one arm 
because we need that arm for special work, while we 
let the other arm get weaker and weaker? 
Even in general gymnasium work there is room for 
improvement; for the breathing exercises most used 
are those in which the head and arms are thrown back- 
ward and the chest up. One reason for the popularity 
of these exercises is, that while the students are 
standing these are the easiest to give, and their 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
  
  180 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
performance takes so short a time that they can be 
given two or three times at the last minute just before 
the class is dismissed. It is true that such breathing 
exercises have a value, particularly after violent or 
rapid exercise. The movements of the arms, ac- 
companied by rhythmical controlled breathing, help 
to regulate the venous and lymphatic flow and steady 
the heart action. During the few minutes given to 
these exercises the circulation and respiration return 
to normal, and the student is in much better condition 
to react from the shower which follows her work. 
But their value, particularly when given in the usual 
hurried, superficial way, should not be so over- 
estimated as to permit them completely to take the 
place of more thorough breathing exercises. 
Use of breathing exercises to improve the chest. 
Accompanying other conditions caused by poor posture 
are flat chest and narrow costal angle. To correct 
these it is necessary to have exercises to stretch the 
contracted muscles of the chest and widen the costal 
angle. The various breathing exercises given with 
arm lifting are unusually good for these purposes, so 
that they should be part of the list of breathing 
exercises used in the corrective department. At the 
same time the instructor should recognize the fact that 
these do not increase the capacity of the whole lung 
and should not be used to the exclusion of other 
breathing exercises. In the list given below we have 
included breathing exercises of sufficient number 
and variety not only to provide the exercises needed to 
correct narrow chests and faulty use of the lungs, but 
also to keep the work from becoming monotonous.
-P-A-G-E-179
    BREATHING EXERCISES 181 
Deep breathing for tuberculosis. In the incipient 
stages of tuberculosis, breathing exercises are of great 
benefit; and if the physician who has diagnosed and is 
treating the case approves, there is no reason why this 
treatment should not be given in the gymnasium. 
The treatment should begin with slow deep breath- 
ing. The patient should not be allowed to put forth 
too much effort, or to overexpand the lungs. On the 
contrary, she should be guarded carefully against 
fatigue, time for rest being given between all exercises. 
Gradually the length of time for the exercise and the 
effort on the part of the patient may both be in- 
creased, but throughout the treatment overfatigue 
must be avoided. 
With a well developed case or a case which is known 
to be active, breathing exercises should not be given. 
In these conditions the lungs need quiet and easy 
breathing, as forced breathing might cause a hemor- 
rhage. 
Deep breathing for asthma. Breathing exercises 
can often be used to relieve the spasmodic coughing 
spells of asthma. These coughing spells frequently 
occur when the patient first lies down or when the air 
in a room becomes close; or they are brought on during 
sleep by a filling up of the throat with mucus. They 
are also caused by nervousness, or by overexertion. 
The attack of coughing is accompanied by a spasm of 
the circular muscle fibres of the bronchial walls and a 
spasmodic movement of the diaphragm. By deep, 
rhythmical, controlled breathing the throat and 
bronchial tubes can be cleared and this spasm of the 
muscles controlled. The breathing should be begun
-P-A-G-E-180
  182 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
as soon as the oppression and desire to cough is felt, 
and it should be continued at intervals until the 
condition is relieved. Many cases of asthma can be 
materially helped by controlled breathing, regularly 
practiced. 
Deep breathing for abnormal heart conditions and 
menstrual disorders. Deep breathing is used with 
benefit for abnormal cardiac and menstrual condi- 
tions, as is more fully explained in the chapters 
treating of these subjects. 
Aims of deep breathing. The aims in giving deep- 
breathing exercises are as follows: 
1. To strengthen the muscles of respiration, par- 
ticularly the diaphragm. 
2. To increase the mobility of the lungs and chest. 
3. To secure equal development of all parts of the 
lungs. 
4. To enlarge the chest capacity and breathing 
capacity of the lungs. 
5. To deepen habitual breathing. 
6. To improve the circulation. 
7. To help increase the flow of blood through the 
inferior vena cava. 
8. To lower the blood pressure and to quiet the 
heart after violent exercise. 
9g. To cause a freer flow of blood and lymph to 
those distant parts of the lungs not habitually 
used. 
10. To relieve congestion in the organs in the pelvic 
region. 
11. To quiet the nerves and to relieve insomnia.  
-P-A-G-E-181
BREATHING EXERCISES 183 
Exercise I. 
POSITION. Lying on the back, with the arms down 
at the sides and all the muscles of the body relaxed. 
EXERCISE. Draw the breath in slowly through the 
nose; hold for an instant, then slowly breathe out 
through the nose. The inhalations and exhalations 
should be of equal length. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Trying to control the breath 
in order to force it into some specific region of the 
body. (2) Breathing through the mouth. (3) Failing 
to make the exhalation and inhalation of equal length. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. See that each student 
is thoroughly relaxed before she begins the exercise. 
If a student should find it difficult at first to relax 
when stretched out flat, let her flex her knees, put 
one arm under her head, or make any slight change 
in position which will help her to complete relaxation. 
To keep the breathing rhythmical, count aloud the 
same number for inhalation as for exhalation. Begin 
with a small number, such as six or eight, and increase 
when that breathing period becomes easy. A count 
of thirty for inhalation and thirty for exhalation will 
give expansion great enough for class work, although 
individuals can often continue much longer than this. 
To keep the rhythm for individual work, students 
may count mentally. 
Exercise II. 
POSITION. Same as in Exercise I. 
EXERCISE. (qa) Inhale as in Exercise I. (b) Hold 
the breath and contract the abdominal muscles; then 
exhale as in Exercise I.

Exercise III. 
POSITION. Standing, with the arms down at the 
sides. 
EXERCISE. (1) Bring tne arms up and out at the 
sides to shoulder height, turn the palms up, take the 
arms back as far as possible without losing correct 
posture. (2) Bring the arms back to the shoulder 
position, turn the palms down, and let the arms sink 
slowly to the first position. Inhale, as the arms go up 
and out; exhale, as they come back and down. 
Exercise IV. 
POSITION. Standing, with the arms down at the 
sides. 
EXERCISE. (a) Bring the arms out and up to shoul- 
der height, with inhalation. (b) Keep the palms 
down, circle with the arms back and down to first 
position, with exhalation. 
POSSIBLE ERRORS. (1) Dropping the head and 
chest forward as the azms go back. (2) Increasing 
the lumbar curve. (3) Letting the weight go back on 
the heels. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. In an exercise of this 
type care must be taken to see that the arms are not 
pushed back farther than the student can stretch with- 
out losing correct posture. The object of the exer- 
cise is to stretch the muscles of the chest and to in- 
crease the mobility of the upper thorax; but no 
stretching or effort should be pushed to the point 
where posture must be sacrificed. The whole object of 
the exercise is lost if the chest and head are dropped 
forward; for, in that position, the pull upon the chest  
-P-A-G-E-183
  BREATHING EXERCISES 185 
muscles is less than when the chest is held well up 
and the arms stretehed back against that resistance. 
Exercise V. 
POSITION. Standing, with the armsdownat thesides. 
EXERCISE. Rotate the arms outward, inhaling as 
they go back, exhaling as they return to place. 
Exercise VI. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands on the hips. 
EXERCISE. (a) Drop the chin forward on the chest, 
keeping the body in good position. Push the head 
and neck back, keeping the chin low and breathing in. 
(b) Bring the head forward again, breathing out. 
Exercise VII. 
PURPOSE. To expand the lungs in the upper part, or 
chest region; in the middle part, or region of the lower 
ribs; in the lower part, or region of the diaphragm. 
POSITION. Lying on the back. 
EXERCISE. (a) With the hands resting on the chest, 
inhale and exhale in rhythm, forcing the chest up 
against the hands. (b) With the hands against the 
floating ribs, inhale and exhale in rhythm, trying to 
force the ribs out against the hands. (c) Lay the 
hands across the abdomen, and begin abdominal 
breathing. Inhaling, push the hands up with the 
abdominal muscles; exhaling, pull the abdomen 
away from the hands. 
In other exercises. Deep breathing is of advantage 
in any exercises in which the chest muscles are 
stretched by the raising of the arms. Several of 
these may be found in Chapter VIII.  
-P-A-G-E-184
  CHAPTER XVII 
EXERCISES TO IMPROVE COORDINATION AND BALANCE 
Poor muscular coordination in children. Marked 
cases of poor muscular coérdination are not very 
frequently found among university students; they 
are much more common in the elementary schools. 
These cases are distressing to teachers as well as 
child, for pupils of this type are likely to be nervous 
and irritable and rather hard to control. The very 
effort that they must make to be and do as other 
children causes them to be nervous. Then, too, they 
are often misunderstood, found fault with, even 
scolded, for actions for which they should not be 
held responsible. Many people seem to think that 
children can be scolded into doing the correct thing; 
they fail to realize that the root of the difficulty often 
lies in a condition of the nervous system which can 
only be corrected by patient training and care. Nor 
should the word ‘‘care’”’ be construed to mean “‘con- 
stant watchfulness”’ by elders. Unless the child is, 
at times, left alone, so that he can be natural, even 
awkward when he wishes to be, he feels an additional 
constraint and nervousness which is due to excessive 
supervision on the part of his elders. 
Sympathetic treatment necessary. To be success- 
ful with cases of this type, an instructor must, in the 
186 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  IMPROVE COORDINATION AND BALANCE 187 
first place, be fond of children. In the treatment of 
such cases, an unending amount of patience is needed. 
The instructor must remember that lack of coérdina- 
tion is due to weakness and that a child suffering 
with it is quickly fatigued. Hence the instructor 
in corrective gymnastics must be willing to do a 
moderate amount and then stop. 
Lack of muscular coordination in college students. 
Lack of coérdination and balance is also found among 
college students, but, as has been said, to a much less 
marked degree than among children. With a student 
sufficiently mature, the treatment should begin with 
lessons in definite voluntary muscle control. There 
should be such exercises as Exercise II in Chapter 
VIII, or Exercise XIX in Chapter IX; and there 
should be general good posture exercises. 
Combination of exercises and play for children. 
In the treatment of a child, some well-chosen exercises 
should be given, but much can be done by directing 
the play to those games which require quiet, definite, 
well-controlled movements. 
Marked cases should be treated under a physician’s 
direction. Treatment of a child who is suffering to 
a marked degree from this condition, should, | of 
course, be given under the supervision of a physician, 
so that the general health will be looked after. 
For this extreme condition, as well as for other less 
serious cases, the treatment should begin with exer- 
cises for correct posture. The following exercises, to 
be found in Chapters VIII and IX, are suggested: 
Chapter VIII, Exercises I, II, III, IV, V, IX, and X;

extend into the pelvis. (6) Letting the body sag 
down in any part of the exercise. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. The chief value for 
codrdination in this exercise and in the following one 
is the training in bringing both arms and legs into 
definite positions upon order, and by gradually in- 
creasing the speed in which the exercise is executed, 
teaching control of the arms and legs during rapid 
movement. When giving an exercise to a student 
who has poor coérdination, give the orders slowly at 
first, until she understands and can follow them. 
Then gradually give the orders more rapidly; but be 
careful not to be too quick or too impatient, for any- 
body suffering from a marked degree of lack of co- 
ordination is easily confused and discouraged.

CHAPTER XVIII 
EXERCISES FOR CERTAIN WEAK OR STIFF JOINTS 
Weak or stiff joints. That field of therapeutic gym- 
nastics which includes serious joint conditions caused 
by infantile paralysis or other diseases or injuries, does 
not belong to the college gymnasium. Such treatments 
should be given only by those who are thoroughly 
trained in that type of work and should be under the 
supervision of a surgeon. But there are found, in 
most large schools, cases of weak or stiff joints which 
can be greatly helped by well directed work in the gym- 
nasium. To meet this necessity we include in this 
chapter a limited number of exercises for helping 
various joints that may have become weak or stiff from 
minor causes. Such exercises should not, however, be 
given unless approved by the examining physician. 
Such conditions as chronic subluxation of the knee 
or shoulder which has been caused by too long con- 
tinued bandaging and rest after an injury, stiff joints 
which have followed breaks, and chronic muscle 
weakness caused by infantile or obstetrical paralysis 
are frequently found when examining large groups 
and can often be helped by such exercises as those 
indicated below.

    194 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
Shoulder Exercises 
Exercise I. 
PURPOSE. To stretch the muscles around a stiff 
shoulder joint, or as a form of assistive exercise to 
strengthen a weak shoulder joint. 
POSITION. Standing, with the arms at the sides. 
EXERCISE. (a) Bring the arms up sideways to the 
shoulder level, palms down. (6) Bring the arms 
forward and up to shoulder height, palms in. (c) 
Bring the arms up sideways to shoulder level, palms 
down, and rotate them back turning the palms up. 
(d) Bring the arms forward and up over head. (e) 
Rotate the arms at different levels. (f) Circumduct 
the arms, forward, back, and around; backward, up, 
and around. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. These exercises may 
be varied by combining them with arm _ bending 
exercises, or can be made more strenuous by giving 
resistance. This resistance may be supplied by the 
instructor or by the use of pulley weights, dumb-bells, 
or rowing machine. 
Exercise II. 
PURPOSE. See Exercise I. 
POSITION. Standing, (a) facing the wall, (b) with 
the side to the wall. 
EXERCISE. Place the hand on the wall and creep 
up with the fingers. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. If this exercise is being 
used to stretch the muscles around a joint, the student 
should be encouraged to reach higher and higher on the  
-P-A-G-E-193
    
EXERCISES FOR WEAK OR STIFF JOINTS 195 
wall, and a mark should be made each day at the 
highest point which she is able to reach. 
Exercise III. 
PURPOSE. See Exercise I. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hand on the side of 
the stiff shoulder behind the back, palm backward, 
grasping a wand. 
EXERCISE. Grasp the other end of the wand with 
the other hand and pull it out sideways. 
Exercise IV. 
PURPOSE. See Exercise I. 
POSITION. Standing or sitting. 
EXERCISE. Bring the hand (a) back of the neck, 
(b) over the head, ‘c) forward and over the other 
shoulder. 
Exercise V. 
PURPOSE. To stretch the muscles in a stiff shoulder. 
POSITION. Sitting by the side of a table or in a chair 
with a wide arm. 
EXERCISE. Rest the elbow with the stiff shoulder 
on a pile of blocks or books as high as the arm can 
be raised. Continue piling up the books as the joint 
is stretched to admit them. 
Exercise VI. 
PURPOSE. To stretch the muscles around a shoulder 
joint. 
EXERCISE. (a) Hanging on the stall bars, rings, or 
boom. (6) Travelling on a boom.
-P-A-G-E-194

Exercises for the Elbow 
Exercise VII. 
PURPOSE. To strengthen the muscles at the elbow. 
EXERCISE. Arm flexion and extension (a) without 
resistance, (b) with resistance from the instructor, 
(c) with pulley weights, (d) with dumb-bells. 
Excercise VIII. 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise VII. 
EXERCISE. Arm bending (a) with elbows on a level 
with the shoulder, (b) elbows at the waist, (c) elbows 
back of, or in front of, the body. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. These movements must 
of course be given with all due attention paid to the 
muscles to be developed — omitting resistance in 
flexion if the extensor muscles are being treated, 
in extension if the flexors are being treated. 
Exercise IX. 
PURPOSE. To stretch a stiff elbow joint. 
EXERCISE. Hang on stall bars, rings, or boom. 
Exercise X. 
PURPOSE. Same as in Exercise IX. 
POSITION. Sitting, with the elbow resting on a 
support, and with wrist and forearm grasped by the 
instructor. 
EXERCISE. The instructor stretches or beads the 
elbow. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. No treatment of this 
kind should be attempted by an instructor unless she 
is sure of the physician’s diagnosis of the case. The
-P-A-G-E-195
  
  EXERCISES FOR WEAK OR STIFF JOINTS 197 
advice of a physician should be obtained before 
beginning the treatment. 
The movement of forcible stretching should be a 
steady, even pull; all jerky, uneven movements should 
be avoided. It is sometimes possible to obtain a 
greater range of movement if the treatment is given 
in the following way: Begin with a resistive move- 
ment, and when the muscles of the arm are well relaxed 
change over quickly to a passive movement; that is, 
while the student is trying to contract the arm resist- 
ance can be given, and then while the extensor muscles 
are completely relaxed the movement can be changed 
over quickly into one of passive flexion. These 
changes should be made quickly but with a steady 
well-controlled movement. 
Exercises for the Wrist 
PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISES. To strengthen the 
wrist. 
Exercise XI. 
EXERCISE. Flexion and extension of the wrist 
(a) without resistance, (b) with resistance. 
Exercise XII. 
EXERCISE. Abduction and adduction of the wrist 
(a) without resistance, (b) with resistance. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR ON EXERCISES XI AND XII. 
Resistance can be given in these cases in several ways: 
(1) by the instructor; (2) by the student, using her 
other hand; (3) with pulley weights; (4) with dumb- 
bells. &
-P-A-G-E-196
  198 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
Exercise XIII. 
EXERCISE. Circumduction of the wrist in two direc- 
tions. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. There is no true move- 
ment of circumduction in the wrist, but a somewhat 
circular movement can be made up of the other 
movements; and this exercise of rolling the hand 
round and round, moving it around first one way then 
the other, should be given so that all movements of the 
wrist may be brought to normal. 
Exercises for Fingers’ 
Exercise XIV. 
(a) Flexion. Close the fingers into the palm. (b) 
Flex the joints separately.. (c) Adduct the fingers. 
(d) Abduct the fingers. 
Exercises for the Thumb 
Exercise XV. 
(a) Flex both joints. (6) Extend both joints. 
(c) Adduct the thumb. (d) Abduct the thumb. 
(e) Circumduct the thumb both ways. 
Exercises for the Thumb and Fingers Together 
Exercise XVI. 
EXERCISE. (a) Touch the thumb to the finger tips. 
(b) Touch the thumb to the different joints of the 
fingers. (c) Bring the straight thumb and fingers 
close together making a hollow in the palm of the hand. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. ‘The exercises for both
-P-A-G-E-197
  
  EXERCISES FOR WEAK OR STIFF JOINTS 199 
the thumb and fingers should be given passively, 
actively, and with resistance. To enable the student 
to flex and extend the upper joints of a finger the 
instructor should grasp the fingers just below the joint. 
The student can be taught to hold or resist in her own 
exercises. 
When exercising a stiff wrist or stiff fingers, the 
student should constantly compare one hand with 
the other to see that the movements or degree of 
flexion and extension are normal. She must not forget 
that she should be able to hold the fist closed and bend 
the wrist forward at the same time and that the treat- 
ments should not be discontinued until all movements 
are perfect. 
Perhaps the best results with the fingers can be 
reached by the use of the hands in manual work. But 
one should be very sure that the movements of the 
hands and fingers in the work are the correct ones to 
develop the muscles which are weak, and that they do 
not overexercise those muscles already too strong. 
In most work the fingers are constantly flexed, and if 
the flexor muscles are already too strong such move- 
ments are injurious. 
Exercises for the Muscles of the Hip Joint 
Exercise XVII. 
EXERCISE. (a) Flex the hips by raising the legs 
(1) while standing, (2) while lying on the back. 
(b) Abduct and adduct the thighs (1) while stand- 
ing, (2) while lying on the back. 
(c) Circumduct the thighs (1) while standing, (2) 
while lying. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  200 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
(d) Rotate the thighs in and out (1) while stand- 
ing, (2) while lying. 
(e) Knee bending while standing. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. It is not necessary to 
describe these movements as they are already de- 
scribed in full in other chapters. Movement (a) is 
described in Chapter IX; movements (b), (c), and 
(d) in Chapter XVIII; and movement (e) in Chapter 
XIII. 
Exercises for Weak Muscles around the Knee 
Exercise XVIII. 
POSITION. Sitting. 
EXERCISE. Extend the knee (a) without resistance, 
(b) with resistance. 
Exercise XIX. 
POSITION. Lying on the face, with the knees bent. 
EXERCISE. Bring the leg down (a) without resist- 
ance, (b) with resistance. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR ON EXERCISES XVIII AND 
xix. In both of these exercises, resistance can be 
given by putting one ankle over the other. To 
supply any real benefit, the exercises must be practiced 
daily; and since a student, as a rule, comes to the 
gymnasium only once or twice a week, it is well to 
suggest to her ways in which she can give herself the 
resistance she is accustomed to receive from the 
instructor. 
Exercise XX. 
POSITION. Sitting on a flat surface, with the legs 
stretched out.
-P-A-G-E-199
  EXERCISES FOR WEAK OR STIFF JOINTS = 201 
EXERCISE. (a) Voluntarily contract the extensor 
muscles of the knee, pulling up the patella. (6) 
Contract the inward or outward rotators of the knee, 
according to the need. 
' Exercise XXI. 
POSITION. Standing. 
EXERCISE. (a) Knee bending. (b) Extend the 
strong knee, keeping the foot off the floor, and take 
(a) with the weak knee. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. The knee movements 
given in Exercises XX and XX] are for the extensors 
and rotators only. The most common condition re- 
quiring knee exercises that is found in a college gym- 
nasium is subluxation of the knee. In this condition 
the weak muscles are those of extension and rotation. 
In these cases exercises such as have just been indi- 
cated and massage will be found helpful. To exercise 
the flexors the directions given in Exercises XVII and 
XIX should be reversed.

    CHAPTER XIX 
EXERCISE IN ABNORMAL THYROID AND HEART 
CONDITIONS 
The reason for this chapter. It may appear to 
many that a discussion of exercises for abnormal 
thyroid and heart conditions would belong rather in a 
medical treatise than in a book written for instructors 
in physical education. It is quite true that the 
treatment of both abnormal heart and thyroid con- 
ditions belongs entirely to the physician, but cases of 
both these conditions, usually of mild form, are found 
in many gymnasiums, especially in the gymnasiums 
of schools where physical education is one of the 
requirements. It therefore seems absolutely neces- 
sary that the instructor should understand something 
of such cases as these, if only to know what exercises 
not to give. . 
Supervision of physician necessary. Such cases 
should, of course, be under the constant supervision of 
a physician, so that he can inform the instructor when 
unfavorable symptoms arise, and if necessary, advise 
the student to withdraw from the gymnasium. 
Types of thyroid cases found in a gymnasium. In 
a gymnasium carefully supervised by a physician, the 
advanced cases of thyroidism will not be found. The 
type of case assigned to the gymnasium will be of that 
202
-P-A-G-E-201
  IN THYROID AND HEART CONDITIONS 203 
milder form for which some sort of exercise is necessary 
to keep the student in as good condition as possible. 
Supervised work in the gymnasium is probably the 
best form of exercise which the student can take 
especially during the winter months. : 
These cases may be either hyperthyroid conditions 
or hypothyroid conditions. As far as the work of the 
gymnasium instructor is concerned, the treatment of 
the two types is practically the same. Overwork 
must. be guarded against in both cases, and the 
probability of a weakened heart should always be one 
of the factors to be considered in making up a schedule 
of exercises. There are certain exercises which should 
be omitted altogether. Exercises affecting the muscles 
of the front of the neck, hanging exercises, rapid 
marching, running, and any rapid, strenuous exercises 
are not advisable for either type of case. 
Sympathetic treatment necessary. To be of benefit 
to the student, work must be made as interesting 
as possible; there must, therefore, be some definite 
object for which to work. In order to make her feel 
that there is such a definite goal to be worked toward, 
the schedule of exercises should be as carefully planned 
as those of the other students. To begin with, many 
students who have thyroid trouble have poor posture 
or weak feet, conditions which can be improved with 
exercises that will not be injurious to them even in 
their weakened condition. But the instructor must 
remember that students with abnormal thyroid con- 
ditions are frequently nervous and sensitive. They 
do not, therefore, like to be singled out in a class as 
being different from the other students. For this 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
204 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
reason, their exercises should be of sufficient number 
to keep them reasonably occupied throughout the 
class hour, while, at the same time, these exercises 
should be of such a character as to enable them to lie 
or sit down during part of the time. Breathing 
exercises for abdominal contraction in the supine 
position, exercises for the feet taken in a sitting posi- 
tion, and any other exercises of mild form which the 
ingenuity of the instructor may devise, may be in- 
cluded in their schedules. Nor are the exercises 
everything. At the very start, it is well to let such 
students feel that the instructor understands their 
condition, is willing to allow them to take their work 
slowly, with intervals of rest, and to excuse them from 
the classroom before the end of the hour if they 
become fatigued or are not feeling well. At times, 
instead of requiring her to go through any exercises 
at all, it is best to send a student of this type directly 
to the rest room. This oversight can be given with- 
out making her in the least conspicuous. Most 
students are so appreciative of consideration of this 
sort that there is little danger that they will take 
advantage of such thoughtfulness on the part of the 
instructor. 
Heart cases in the corrective gymnasium. Unless 
there has been no careful examination of students 
before they begin the work, cases of acute heart 
disease are not found in college or other gymnasiums; 
but many students having weakened conditions of the 
heart are to be found there. Many of these students 
have had valvular diseases following scarlet fever, 
rheumatic fever, or some other infection and are in 
   
-P-A-G-E-203
  IN THYROID AND HEART CONDITIONS 205 
such a condition that, while vigorous exercise would 
be dangerous, moderate exercise is necessary not 
only to keep them in good general health, but to 
strengthen the muscles of the heart itself. Naturally, 
this work must be done most carefully and the student 
should be kept under close supervision by the 
instructor. 
Amount and character of exercises. There are 
two facts which an instructor must understand 
clearly before undertaking to treat a case of weak 
heart: first, the character and amount of the exercise 
to be given; second, those symptoms of overwork or 
strain which are the quickest to appear. 
Aim of the exercises. The aim of exercise for these 
conditions is to reduce a high pulse rate by flushing 
the peripheral vessel; to improve the muscular tone of 
the heart; to improve the respiration; to prevent 
palpitation of the heart by action upon the cardiac 
nerves; or to remove excessive fat around the heart. 
Character of the exercises. There are two types of 
exercises for these conditions, one type being advocated 
by certain physicians and the other type by others. 
The exercises of effort are advocated by the followers 
of Schott, who developed his method at Bad Nauheim; 
the exercises of endurance, organized and developed 
by Oertel in Munich, are a combination of mountain 
climbing and other exercises of endurance, added to a 
carefully regulated diet. 
The Schott Method of exercising. The Schott 
Method can be used to best advantage in nervous 
disorders of the heart and in such weakened conditions 
of the heart as follow influenza or other fevers, with
-P-A-G-E-204
  206 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
or without dilatation. The Schott, or Nauheim, 
treatment consists of resistive exercises and medicated 
baths. The baths are, of course, not to be given by 
the physical education instructor. These are given 
only under the advice of a physician and by persons 
trained for that purpose. Many of the exercises, 
however, may be used to advantage in the gymnasium; 
a brief description of them is, therefore, given here. 
These exercises are not meant for muscular develop- 
ment, but to produce certain results upon the heart 
and blood vessels; for this reason, resistance must be 
given most carefully and gently by the instructor. 
As it is desirable not to have the circulation interfered 
with in any way, the instructor should not grasp the 
limb to be exercised, but should place her hands flat 
upon it. ‘‘Self-resistance’’ is sometimes used with 
these exercises, but the instructor must remember 
that this type of resistance is most fatiguing; and no 
student should be permitted to use it for exercising 
for the heart unless she has sufficient intelligence and 
muscle control to regulate the amount of resistance 
as this should be done. 
In the following exercises all resistance is given by 
the instructor, and the amount of resistance must be 
regulated by the condition of the student, and accord- 
ing to the advice given by the physician in charge. 
Exercises Prescribed in the Schott Method 
Exercise I. 
POSITION. Lying, sitting, or standing; the in- 
structor’s hands lying flat upon the student’s wrist. 
EXERCISE. Extend the arms forward to shoulder
-P-A-G-E-205
    
IN THYROID AND HEART CONDITIONS 207 
level; then, at the same level, bring them back to the 
sides. 
Exercise II. 
POSITION. Lying, standing, or sitting. The arm 
flexed; one hand of the instructor supporting the 
student’s elbow; the other pressed, first, against the 
back, then against the front, of the student’s wrist. 
EXERCISE. Extend and flex the arm against resist- 
ance. 
Exercise III. 
POSITION. Standing, with the arms down at the 
sides, palms forward, the instructor’s hands pressed 
first against the ulnar, then against the radial side, of 
the student’s wrist. 
EXERCISE. Raise the arms sideways, overhead ; then 
bring them down sideways to position. 
Exercise IV. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands clasped in 
front of the abdomen, the instructor’s hands clasped 
lightly around the student’s wrist. 
EXERCISE. Raise the arms up overhead, keeping 
the hands clasped; then bring them down to first 
position. 
Exercise V. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands down at the 
sides and the palms against the thighs. The position 
of the instructor’s hands is described in ‘‘ Hints to the 
Instructor.”
-P-A-G-E-206
  208 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
EXERCISE. Raise the arms forward and upward to 
overhead position; then lower the arms to first position. 
HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This last is one of the 
most difficult exercises for giving resistance steadily 
and gently. At the beginning of the exercise the 
instructor’s fingers should press the radial side of the 
student’s wrist. As the arms are raised, the instructor 
should lightly grasp the student’s wrist, which, in this 
part of the exercise, should rest in the V which is 
formed by the instructor’s thumbs and fingers. When 
the shoulder level is reached, the instructor’s hand 
should be so turned as to support the student’s wrist 
upon her forefinger and thumb. As the arm reaches a 
lower level, the instructor should resist with pressure 
of her fingers, against the ulnar surface of the student’s 
wrist. A little practice may be necessary before an 
instructor can give this exercise smoothly and gently. 
Exercise VI. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands on the hips, the 
instructor’s hand first on the upper sternum of the 
student, then against the middle dorsal vertebre. 
EXERCISE. Bend the trunk forward; then raise it to 
correct position. 
Exercise VII. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands on the hips, 
one of the instructor’s hands upon the advancing 
shoulder of the student, the other clasped over the 
shoulder which is being drawn backward. ; 
EXERCISE. . Rotate the body from the waist, first 
to one side and then to the other.

Exercise VIII. 
POSITION. Standing, with the hands on the hips, 
one of the instructor’s hands placed under the armpit 
of the student, the other against the student’s hip, 
both on the side toward which she is to bend. 
EXERCISE. First bend the trunk sideways to the 
right; then to the left; then to erect position. 
Exercise IX. 
POSITION; EXERCISE. Same as Exercise II, but with 
the fist clenched. 
Exercise X. 
POSITION; EXERCISE. Same as Exercise IX, but 
with the palm turned out. Exercise first one arm,

EXERCISE. Bring the arms forward and overhead, 
the palms in; then lower the arms sideways to posi- 
tion, the palms down. 
Exercise XII. 
POSITION. Standing, with the arms down at the 
sides, the instructor standing behind the student and 
grasping her wrists lightly. 
EXERCISE. Carry the arms backward and up as 
high as possible without bending the trunk forward. 
Lower them to place.

EXERCISE. Resting the weight upon one leg, flex 
the thigh of the other leg on the trunk, letting the 
leg hang loosely down, then return to place. Exercise 
each leg in turn. 
Exercise XIV. 
POSITION. The same as in Exercise XIII, the 
instructor’s hand pressing against the student’s leg 
just above the ankle. 
EXERCISE. Raise the extended leg forward then 
backward. Exercise first one leg then the other.

POSITION. Standing, with both hands resting on a 
table or chair, the instructor’s hand first against the 
student’s heel, next in front of the ankle. 
EXERCISE. Flex the leg on the thigh, then bring 
back to place. Exercise first one leg and then the 
other. 
Exercise XVI. 
POSITION. Standing as in Exercise XIII, the in- 
structor’s hand against the student’s ankle. 
EXERCISE. Raise the extended leg out toward the 
side and back to place. 
Exercise XVII. 
POSITION. Standing, with the arms out at the sides
-P-A-G-E-209
IN THYROID AND HEART CONDITIONS 211 
at shoulder height, the instructor’s hands lightly 
grasping the student’s wrists. 
EXERCISE. Rotate the arms first backward, then 
forward. 
Exercise XVIII. 
POSITION. Sitting or lying; the instructor’s hand 
pressed against the palm or the back of the student’s 
hand. 
EXERCISE. Flex and extend the hand. 
Exercise XIX. 
POSITION. Sitting or lying; the instructor’s hand 
pressed against the sole or back of the student’s foot. 
EXERCISE. Flex and extend the foot. 
Regulating the amount of work. An instructor 
should thoroughly understand the degree and kind 
of heart weakness before she begins to treat a case 
of this kind. This information she should obtain from 
a physician whose knowledge and experience enable 
him to decide the amount of work which will be of 
benefit to the student. If the instructor is working 
in a gymnasium where the students are not examined 
before being put under her supervision, she should 
insist that a physician be asked to make an examina- 
tion before she begins her work. 
Exercises few at first. All work designed to 
benefit a weakened heart should at first be very 
light. The exercises should be few in number and 
easy to execute; and they should be repeated only a 
few times in any one exercise period. Later on, 
progress may be made by increasing the number of 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  212 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
times each exercise is repeated. The next step is to 
add new exercises of greater difficulty and it is well to 
decrease the number of exercises which the student is 
already taking, in order that she may not become 
overfatigued by an increase in her amount of work. 
Such exercises as leg-lifting and trunk-bending should 
be the last to be added, for they are sometimes 
most difficult for a person with a weak heart. It is 
especially important that an instructor consider not 
only the immediate effect of an exercise, but its effect 
upon the student through what remains of her day 
after she has exercised. An instructor must, there- 
fore, keep herself informed as to the student’s con- 
dition and must regulate her exercises accordingly. 
Adverse symptoms. An instructor must not at- 
tempt to treat a case of weak heart unless she has 
time to give close oversight to the student as she 
works. Different people are affected differently by 
the same exercises; and an instructor who is working 
with a person who has a weak heart must be quick to 
recognize an adverse symptom, and stop the exercise. 
Adverse symptoms for which to watch are irregular 
or increased breathing, excessive perspiration, quick- 
ened pulse, palpitation, and cyanosis. 
While the exercises are being taken, the instructor 
must watch to see that the breath is not held, but that 
breathing is free and regular. Sufficient rest should 
be taken between the exercises, and, if necessary, the 
student should rest, by lying down, in the middle of 
the class hour. Resistance must be regulated care- 
fully, made very light at first, and preferably given by

Class work and sports. As such a student becomes 
stronger, she may be permitted to join in the general 
class exercise if it is not too strenuous. But if she is 
permitted to do so, she must be watched and stopped 
should her breathing become perceptibly irregular. 
Light sports, such as archery, quoits, bowling, and, in 
some cases, swimming, may be allowed. But it isa 
good rule to insist that these heart cases be re- 
examined by a physician before permission is given for 
the more strenuous sports, such as tennis, baseball, 
and volley ball. Graduated work is usually good for 
the student. One student who was  successfuily 
treated for an abnormal heart started with the lightest 
possible gymnasium work and sport; at the end of 
her second year she was allowed to play baseball; and 
at the end of her fourth year she was able to do what 
she pleased in the way of sports, with no bad results 
whatever.

  CHAPTER XX 
EXERCISES FOR REDUCING WEIGHT 
Excessive flesh. Exercises for reducing weight 
belong to the corrective or remedial department, for 
excessive flesh is not alone a question of appearance; 
it is frequently one of health also. Excessive flesh 
will in many cases make a young person sensitive and 
awkward and prevent him or her from joining in 
those activities which would give a needed amount of 
exercise. Many people take up gymnastic work for 
the one purpose of reducing. If fat is equally dis- 
tributed over the body, general gymnasium exercises 
or walking, running, or horseback riding are probably 
all that is necessary, with proper attention to diet. 
Unfortunately this is not always the case. On the 
contrary, excessive fat as a rule settles in those 
parts of the body where it is least desired, such as 
the abdomen, the hips, or the back of the neck. To 
reduce the parts so affected and to bring the body 
back into good form, special, well-directed exercises 
are necessary. 
Physical fitness. Since exercises for reducing must 
be taken rapidly and vigorously and repeated many 
times, one should not attempt to take them unless 
physically fit to do heavy work. One also needs 
patience and perseverence, for it is usually necessary 
214
-P-A-G-E-213
  EXERCISES FOR REDUCING WEIGHT 215 
to continue the work for months; and as a rule one 
sees little result at first. 
Diet should be prescribed by a physician. If 
definite results are to be reached, the diet also must be 
regulated, and this should be done under the advice of 
aphysician. The many and varied methods of dieting 
and starving that are practiced without sufficient 
knowledge of their effect upon the general physical 
condition or thought of possible injury, are too 
numerous to mention. That many persons are 
veakened and in other ways injured by improper 
diet, used with the hope of reducing weight, is 
undoubtedly true. The most successful treatment 
of cases of obesity is that given under the guidance of 
a physician who directs the diet and medications (if* 
such are necessary), the gymnasium instructor pre- 
scribing and giving the exercises. 
Increase exercise gradually. At the beginning of 
the treatment a limited number of exercises should be 
taken and these repeated only a few times, so that there 
will be neither a great amount of fatigue nor muscle 
soreness; but the number and variety may be increased 
rapidly, until at least fifteen exercises are being repeat- 
ed from fifteen to twenty times once a day and every 
day. This is necessary if there is to be the desired 
result from their use.

HINTS TO THE INSTRUCTOR. This exercise, like all 
exercises in which unusual muscle control is required, 
may require much patience and perseverance on the

CHAPTER XXI 
TREATMENT OF SUBNORMAL CASES 
Students who belong neither in athletic nor cor- 
rective group. Students who are sound. physically 
are often given a great deal of attention in physical 
education, not only because they are full of life and 
therefore interesting, but because, with much virility, 
they demand activity of some sort, and exercises to 
meet their needs must be of a strenuous and competi- 
tive nature. But there is another group which 
presents a different problem. This group is made 
up of those who are not able to stand heavy gymnasium 
work or competitive sports, but who do not need 
special orthopedic exercises. Such students as these, 
though having regular work in classes, must be given 
a certain amount of individual oversight, and the 
exercises given must be light. 
Disabilities that characterize this group. The 
disabilities in this group, though they may in many 
cases come from a common and single cause, may 
vary as to the form in which they manifest themselves. 
The instructor should, therefore, understand thor- 
oughly the causes of the incapacity and its effect on 
the individual in order that she may determine the 
nature and extent of the exercises to be given. 
225  
-P-A-G-E-224
226 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
That branch of gymnastic work which is devoted to | 
the treatment of subnormal cases includes students 
having cardiac and acute menstrual disorders, active 
thyroids, and deformities which can not be corrected. 
The policy of permanently excusing subnormal stud- 
ents from all gymnasium work does not seem wise, 
since they need some form of exercise. This exercise 
must, however, be taken under supervision; and if it is 
combined with instruction in personal hygiene, great 
benefit should be derived thereform. 
Before work is begun with these students, a thorough 
medical examination should be given by a physician, 
* and no work should be undertaken by the instructor 
until she has received his report. 
The student’s daily report. In order to make the 
instruction personal to each student, some method of 
checking up on her daily life is found to be advisable. 
For this the blank on the following page is suggested. 
In the blank, the student can, by checking with 
numbers, in a very short time make a report sufficiently 
full to be satisfactory to the instructor. At regular 
intervals the students should bring their blanks to the 
instructor for discussion; and, in order that each 
student may be reached, there should be certain days 
appointed when nothing but a discussion of the reports 
takes place. In order to be helpful, these discussions 
must be practical, and the instructor must never lose 
sight of the psychological effect they may produce 
upon the student. She must, for example, be careful 
not to appear dictatorial or overcritical in her 
manner of giving advice, and her explanations should 
always be simple and direct.

Purpose of the work. The purpose of the work done 
in this class should be mainly remedial. First, the 
instructor should show the students where they are 
using strength unnecessarily and teach them how they 
may so direct their energies as to conserve them and 
thus reach a higher degree of efficiency; next, she 
should explain how, by proper feeding and resting, 
they may increase their strength and energy. 
The first work in class. In this course, as in all 
courses in corrective gymnastics, the first thing neces- 
sary is to develop in the students a kinesthetic sense in 
all the larger groups of muscles which control the 
positions of the lumbar, dorsal, and cervical spine. 
The use of the skeleton and various charts increases 
interest and helps the students to understand and 
remember. This instruction will help them to under- 
stand the possibility of conscious control of the 
different single groups of muscles which hold the spine 
in an efficient working position. After having worked 
with each group separately, the instructor should give 
exercises to teach codrdination between the groups 
and a more permanent static contraction when 
these groups of muscles are not being actively 
used. 
It is well to start with an analysis of standing and 
walking, since these exercises may be put into im- 
mediate practice and all subsequent work in the 
course is based upon them. The correct method of 
walking should be demonstrated by the instructor, and 
the students should practice this in the class under 
direct supervision. In teaching walking, an analysis 
of the muscles used, how and when they are used, the
-P-A-G-E-227
  TREATMENT OF SUBNORMAL CASES 229 
position of the trunk, and the transference of weight 
in the act of walking should all be explained clearly. 
At the very beginning, at least one class period 
should be employed for teaching breathing and 
relaxing exercises and explaining the object of these 
exercises. After the exercises have been carefully 
taught they should be given as a part of each class 
period. Instruction should also be given in the 
correct use of the body in the ordinary movements of 
the day, such as sitting down to rest or write, climbing 
stairs, lifting, or working in stooped positions. A 
sufficient amount of time should be devoted to instruc- 
tion in these movements to enable the instructor not 
only to explain and demonstrate the correct methods, 
but also to have the students practice the different 
movements before the instructor until they can 
execute these correctly. 
Correct use of the feet should be taught; and talks 
should be given on the hygiene of menstruation and 
the causes of constipation. With all of these talks, 
charts and the skeleton should be used. Simple 
remedies for constipation may also be suggested, and 
exercises may be given for the various abnormal 
conditions. 
Some typical cases. The following cases have been 
cited for the purpose of showing what good results are 
possible if the instructor studies the hygiene reports 
and discusses them seriously with the students. The 
response from such a method of handling a class is 
usually satisfactory; and if the instructor is sympa- 
thetic and not censorious, the reports given by the 
students will be found frank and truthful.
-P-A-G-E-228
230 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
Case I. A student with a cardiac trouble and a very 
low health grade. The first interview with this girl 
brought out the fact that she was not getting sufficient 
sleep and rest. She was firmly convinced that it was 
impossible for her to go to bed earlier or sleep later 
than she was doing, because she had so much studying 
to do. But when it was suggested to her that she 
might take two or three short rests through the day 
at hours when she was not studying, she was quite 
willing to codperate. The rest periods selected in 
her case were just before meals and just after her last 
class period. These short periods of rest, taken two 
or three times a day, amounted to a considerable 
time when counted as a whole. In the case under 
discussion the results were excellent, and the girl’s 
condition improved greatly. 
Case II. A_ student whose health history showed 
several attacks of pneumonia and a family tendency 
to tuberculosis, her brother having died of the latter disease. 
When this girl first came to the class, her skin had a 
greyish pallor, and she expressed a nervous dread of 
the work assigned her for fear of its causing coughing 
anda pain in her chest. After three or four weeks of 
routine work in the subnormal gymnasium class, she 
was advised to go to her physician for reéxamination. 
Since this examination proved that her pains were not 
caused by lesions in the lungs, but were muscular, her 
whole attitude towards life suddenly changed. The 
pains in her chest disappeared; her appetite im- 
proved; and she gained weight. In fact, she became 
more vigorous in every way, and she now looks and 
acts like a different individual. The development of 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
TREATMENT OF SUBNORMAL CASES 231 
this case shows what can be accomplished by carefully 
' supervised exercises on the one hand, and a thorough 
medical examination, frankly explained, on the other. 
Case III. A student whose report showed that she 
was taking very little recreation, eating scanty meals, 
sleeping little, and verging on a nervous breakdown. 
In talking to this girl, the instructor found that she 
was doing all the family cooking, washing, and 
ironing, and had, therefore, no time for recreation. 
Since it was found that her family was financially able 
to employ help for the heavy work, the girl was 
given tactful encouragement and assistance in induc- 
ing her family to hire a woman to relieve her. She 
was thus given time for recreation and was enabled 
to eat away from home at least once a week. As a 
result, her condition improved rapidly. 
Case IV. A student whose report showed a general 
low health condition and who appeared very hysteri- 
cal. The instructor found in talking to this girl that 
she had recently suffered from a nervous breakdown, 
and that she was having very vivid and terrible 
dreams. She fancied herself unable -to relax; but, 
after being taught breathing and relaxing exercises, 
she found she was able not only to relax, but really to 
rest when she lay down. Her strength has now 
improved, and she sleeps without dreaming. The 
relaxing exercise that she uses is the following: She 
lies down for at least twenty minutes, with her arms 
stretched over her head, and a blanket, folded to 
about sixteen inches in length by four inches in 
width, placed under the middle of the dorsal spine. 
This exercise is taken several times a day.

232 CORRECTIVE GYMNASTICS 
Case V. A student whose report showed her a 
constant suffererer from constipation and a slave to 
laxatives. The instructor advised certain exercises 
and the use of bran with the diet, which proved to be 
what was needed in this girl’s case. By these simple 
means the student has been able to cure her consti- 
pation and is no longer dependent upon laxatives. 
Type of gymnastic work given to subnormal cases. 
As may be seen in the preceding report, the work given 
in these special classes for subnormal cases is a 
combination of light gymnastics and instruction in 
hygiene. The purpose of the work is primarily a 
remedial one, exercises being given for correction 
rather than for pleasure or bodily stimulation. The 
one important thing in this class of work is so to 
interest the pupil that what she is taught in class about 
hygiene and the use of her body will be carried over 
into her everyday life. To attain this end she must 
be given something which can be practiced at any 
hour of the day rather than in just the short time in 
which she is doing the formal work in the gymnastic 
classroom. And if, in addition, she is taught a proper 
understanding of the body’s mechanism and of her own 
particular weakness, she will be prevented from 
injuring herself by the improper use of her muscles. 
The strain of college life must be met. College life, 
with its serious studies and no less taxing outside 
activities, calls upon all the physical and nervous 
energy that a girl possesses. Unless she has a good 
supply of such energy, she will by the senior year be 
worn out and nervous. She must be in good physical 
condition to be able to accomplish properly the four
-P-A-G-E-231
  TREATMENT OF SUBNORMAL CASES 233 
years of college work, and if she is not physically fit 
she must be helped to become so. 
As has been explained in this chapter, mere attend- 
ance at gymnastic classes is not enough for the sub- 
normal girl, however well she may work during class 
time, for by one half hour’s incorrect posture later she 
may undo the good work of the most effective gym- 
nastic drill. Tactful advice and instruction which will 
teach her how best to conserve her own strength and to 
improve her bodily condition, as well as remedial 
exercises suited to her particular weakness, are what 
the subnormal girl should have.

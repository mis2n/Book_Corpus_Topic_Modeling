  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
One of the many pleasures connected with the preparation 
of this monograph is that of expressing my gratitude to those 
instructors at Radcliffe College who have guided me. To 
Professor Sheldon and Professor Kittredge my indebtedness is 
very great for the advice that they have allowed me to feel 
might in times of perplexity invariably be had for the asking, 
and for the share that they have assumed in the drudgery of 
proof-reading. Thanks are also due to Professor Robinson for 
occasional criticisms and sundry references to Celtic sources. 
From the beginning of my study of fairy mythology I have 
been under obligations to Professor Schofield, and in both the 
fundamentals and the details of the following pages I have so 
often been influenced by his suggestions that the acknowledg- 
ment of his ample help must necessarily remain incomplete. 
I would also express my grateful appreciation of the arrange- 
ments by which Radcliffe College is able to offer her students 
the privileges of the Harvard College Library; by unhampered 
access to its resources, given with the utmost courtesy, it has 
been possible for me to collect the material for these studies.

    AN ADMONITION TO THE GENTLE READER 
Right well I wote 
That all this famous dntique history 
Of some th’ aboundance of an ydle braine 
Will iudged be, and painted forgery, 
Rather than matter of iust memory ; 
Sith none that breatheth living aire does know 
Where is that happy land of Faéry, 
Which I so much doe vaunt, yet no where show ; 
But vouch antiquities, which no body can know. 
But let that man with better sence advize 
That of the world least part to us is red; 
And daily how through hardy enterprize 
Many great regions are discovered, 
Which to late age were never mentioned. 
Yet all these were, when no man did them know, 
Yet have from wisest ages hidden beene ; 
And later times thinges more unknowne shall show. 
Why then should witlesse man so much misweene, 
That nothing is, but that which he hath seene? 
What, if within the moones fayre shining spheare, 
What, if in every other starre unseene 
Of other worldes he happily should heare? \ 
He wonder would much more ; yet such to some appeare. 
Of Faery lond yet if he more inguyre, 
By certein signes, here sett in sondrie place, 
He may it fynd.

STUDIES IN THE FAIRY MYTHOLOGY OF 
ARTHURIAN ROMANCE 
CHAPTER I 
THE FAIRY QUEEN 
Tue fairy mythology of the middle ages is represented in its 
most important literary form by the lays and romances embody- 
ing the “matter of Britain” which were written in France dur- 
ing the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A Breton lay or an 
Arthurian romance consists essentially in the glorification of _a _ 
single hero, and its incidents are strung, one after the other, 
upon the” thread of. his individual prowess. As a crowning 
tribute to his | excellence, often as the prize that rewards his 
most difficult achievement, the love of a fay is bestowed upon 
him by the narrator of his exploits. For the purposes of 
romance the fay exists that she may set a seal upon the hero’s 
valor and beauty by granting him her favor, or that she may 
afford an opportunity for him to display his courage by demand- 
ing of him an apparently impossible adventure. Hence, although 
the fay’s place in the narrative is really secondary to the hero’s, 
she is a highly important element in the structure of Arthurian 
romance, and we may scarcely wonder that it is in truth “ fulfild 
of fayerye,” nor that in it we have a treasure-house of fairy 
lore. The romances, however, are by no means a final source 
for information in regard to the other world and its inhabitants. 
To discover the fay in her true nature we must follow her 
to her home in_ Ireland and Wales, where among the earlier 
traditions of the Celtic people she stands nearer simple myth 
than in many of the twelfth-century lays and romances of 
France. 
There is no lack of Celtic sources to furnish us with a clear 
conception of the Celtic fairy queen. In Irish literature the 
earliest extant narrative in which we meet her is the /mram 
1
-P-A-G-E-14
2) The Fairy Queen 
Brain maic Febail (The Voyage of Bran, Son of Febal), which 
there is reason to believe embodies oral tradition first written 
down in the seventh century, although our manuscripts are 
probably derived from an original that does not antedate 
the tenth century.! 
One day when Bran chanced to be alone near his stronghold, he heard 
sweet music behind him, and however often he looked back, the music was 
ever behind him ; at last, such was its sweetness that he fell asleep. When 
he awoke he saw close by him a branch of silver covered with white blos- 
soms, which he carried with him to his dwelling. As he sat there with his 
hosts, a woman in strange raiment appeared before them, and began to sing 
to Bran of Emain, a distant island peopled by women, rich in flowers and 
birds, joy, music, and feasting, a land that knew nothing rough nor harsh, 
neither death nor decay. 
“© Not to all of you is my speech, 
Though its great marvel has been made known: 
Let Bran hear from the crowd of the world 
‘What of wisdom has been told to him. 
Begin a voyage across the clear sea, 
If perchance thou mayst reach the land of women.’ 
“ Thereupon the woman went from them, while they knew not whither she 
went. And she took her branch with her. The branch sprang from Bran’s 
hand into the hand of the woman, nor was there strength in Bran’s hand to 
hold the branch.” (§§ 29-31.) 
The next day Bran obeyed the woman’s summons and with a band of 
comrades began his mysterious voyage. As they neared the Land of 
Women, they saw the leader of the women at the port, and heard her voice 
calling them to shore and bidding them welcome. ‘The woman throws a 
ball of thread to Bran straight over his face. Bran put his hand on the 
ball, which clave to his palm. The thread of the ball was in the woman’s 
hand, and she pulled the coracle towards the port. Thereupon they went 
into a large house.... The food that was put on every dish vanished not 
from them. It seemed a year to them that they were there, —it chanced 
to be many years. No savour was wanting to them. 
“ Homesickness seized one of them, even Nechtan the son of Collbran. 
His kindred kept praying Bran that he should go to Ireland with him. 
The woman said to them their going would make them rue. However, 
they went, and the woman said that none of them should touch the land. 
Then they went until they arrived at a gathering at Srub Brain. The 
men asked of them who it was came over the sea. Said Bran: ‘I am Bran 
the son of Febal,’ saith he. However, the other saith: ‘ We do not know 
such a one, though the Voyage of Bran is in our ancient stories.’

  The Fairy Queen 3 
«The man leaps from them out of the coracle. As soon as he touched the 
earth of Ireland, forthwith he was a heap of ashes, as though he had been 
in the earth for many hundred years.” (§§ 62-65.) 
Another early story belonging to the same class of narrative 
as that of Bran is the Echtra Condla (The Adventures of Connla), 
a narrative that is found in the Ledbor na h-Uidre (The Book 
of the Dun Cow), an Irish manuscript the compiler of which is 
said to have died in 1106, and which contains tradition much 
older than the eleventh century? 
One day as Connla of the Ruddy Hair was standing on Uisnech with 
his father, Cond the Hundred-Fighter, he saw a beautiful maiden, clad in 
unfamiliar garb, drawing near. She was visible only to Connla, and for 
him alone had she come to tell him that she loved him and to summon him 
to her dwelling in the lands of the living, where neither death nor sin were 
known, and where Connla’s youth would never wither, a land that was 
justly called the Plain of Delight. 
Cond in grave anxiety at hearing such enticing words addressed to his 
son, bade his druid cast a spell upon the stranger who was trying to take 
Connla from him. But the maiden, as she turned to leave, gave an apple 
to Connla. For a month he refused food and drink, and tasted nothing 
but his apple, which however often he partook of it never grew smaller, 
but always remained a perfect fruit. More and more he longed for the 
maiden’s presence. At the end of the month he saw her coming toward 
him, and once more he heard her singing to him, bidding him sail with her 
in her boat of glass over the seas to the Plain of Delight, where none but 
women dwell. Connla instantly leaped into the boat with the maiden, and 
sailed away from his kindred. Never more did they have tidings from him, 
A being of the same type as the maidens from Emain and 
the Plain of Delight makes her appearance in Welsh literature 
in the Mabinogi of Pwyll, Prince of Dyved,* one of the genuine 
Mabinogion, which in its material probably antedates the twelfth 
century.* 
Pwyll, Prince of Dyved, was a lord of prowess and renown. One day as 
he sat with some of his followers on a certain enchanted mound, he saw an

unknown lady wearing a garment of shining gold come riding toward him. 
She was mounted on a large snow-white horse, and rode at a slow and even 
pace. Pwyll sent one of his followers to meet her, but she passed by, and 
although the page rode the fleetest horse in Pwyll’s stables, “the more he 
urged his horse, the further was she from him. Yet she held the same pace 
as at first... . ‘Ofa truth,’ said Pwyll, ‘there must be some illusion here.’ ” 
On the next day the same experience was repeated. On the third day, 
Pwyll once again went to the mound, and when the lady came pacing by, 
he himself rode after her, and urged his horse on to its greatest speed, yet 
he found that it availed nothing to follow her. Then Pwyll entreated her 
for the sake of him whom she best loved to stay for him. «<I will stay 
gladly,’ said she, ‘and it were better for thy horse, hadst thou asked it 
long since.’” She was journeying on her own errand, she told him in 
answer to his questions, and her chief quest was to seek him. She was 
Rhiannon, she said, the daughter of Heveydd Hén, who wished to give her 
to a husband against her will ; but such was her love for Pwyll that him 
alone would she have for a husband. As she spoke, Pwyll, gazing upon 
her, thought that she was more beautiful than any lady whom he had ever 
seen, and he gladly promised to meet her a year from that day at the 
palace of Heveydd. 
In a year’s time, attended by a retinue of knights, he fulfilled his word, 
and was received with joy and gladness in the palace, where he was treated 
as lord. t 
The rest of the narrative does not concern us here, nor the 
future fate of Rhiannon. Her summons of Pwyll is enough to 
place her beside the queen of the Land of Women and Connla’s 
love, even if we heard nothing of Harlech where the magic 
song of her birds over the sea makes time pass with the same 
mysterious swiftness as in Emain.1 
From these three stories we can form a distinct conception 
of the Celtic fairy queen, which we shall do well to keep before 
us in studying the fay of mediaeval romance, whose likeness in 
attribute and deed to the maidens beloved by Bran, Connla, and 
Pwyll stamps her clearly as their lineal descendant. So we 
must lay aside, for the time being, our cherished pictures of 
Queen Titania and Faery Mab, and remember that the fay of 
Arthurian romance is essentially a supernatural woman, always 
more beautiful than the imagination can possibly fancy her, 
untouched by time, unhampered by lack of resources for the

accomplishment of her pleasure, superior to human blemish, 
contingency, or necessity, in short, altogether unlimited in her 
power. Insistent love is a fundamental part of her nature, but 
she holds aloof from ordinary mortals and gives her favor only 
to the best and most valorous of knights.!_ She has complete 
foreknowledge, and often, as we shall see later, has guarded 
from infancy the mortal whom she finally takes to the other 
world as her beloved. However unexpectedly to the hero she 
appears before him, she comes always in quest of him, and for 
the purpose of carrying out a long-formed design of claiming 
his love. Her power at first is manifested by some mysterious 
agency. Like the musical bough to which Bran listened this may 
benumb the senses, or like Connla’s magic apple it may increase 
a longing for her, or again like Rhiannon’s snow-white horse, 
that none but Pwyll can stay, it may be the direct means of 
bringing the chosen hero to the fay’s side. The effect of 
these agencies is merely the sign that the mortal is feeling the 
bewildering fairy influence, and unconsciously, but perforce, 
yielding to it. When the inevitable result ensues, and he 
obeys her summons to the other world, his bewilderment 
becomes complete oblivion, and he dwells in utter forgetfulness 
of all things mortal, conscious only of the delights that the fay 
offers him. He may grow restless at his retention in fairyland, 
but he cannot escape the fay’s control. Her power follows 
him back to earth as that of the queen of Emain followed 
Nechtan, in the form of a command, disregard of which will 
bring certain punishment. We shall meet with numerous 
examples of the penalty that surely is paid by a mortal if he 
violates the injunction laid upon him by his fairy mistress ; 
and yet we shall see her again and again showing her forgive- 
ness of her delinquent lover, by coming to him just as the dire 
consequences of his disobedience overtake him, and bearing 
him off once more to the other world. In the fairy mythology 
of romance the law is invariable, that for the mortal who once 
has experienced the fairy control there is no true release, and 
that the fay is never to be thwarted in her plans to win the 
hero whose love she seeks. Hence, although she often appears 
in the pages of romance as a capricious mistress who with

      6 The Fairy Queen 
astonishing fertility of resource provides adventures for mortals, 
she really moves in accordance with a definite law of her nature, 
the law of absolute supremacy whenever she pleases to exercise 
her control, and this control is primarily effective for the wel- 
fare of the knight whom she loves.! 
In the Arthurian romances there are three powerful fays who 
are more important than all others, Morgain la fée, the Dame 
du Lac, and Niniane. Of the two latter neither finds a place 
outside of strictly Arthurian material. Each is prominent 
because of her association with a single hero, the Dame du 
Lac with Lancelot, Niniane with Merlin. Each is distinguished 
by one leading characteristic: the Dame du Lac is the 
protectress of a young knight, Niniane the beguiler of her 
lover. 
Morgain, on the other hand, is a much more pervasive influ- 
ence than either of the others, and has made her way even 
outside of the Arthurian material into the Roman de Trote 
and Huon de Bordeaux. This fact, however, should not be 
interpreted as pointing to a tradition of Morgain that was 
independent of the “matter of Britain”; for Benoit de Sainte- 
More, the author of the Roman de Troze, though he was pri- 
marily intent upon legend developed from Dares and Dictys, 
was unquestionably as familiar as Wace with “Breton”’ tales,? 
and in his reference to Morgain® we can detect him simply 
adopting a convention that he had learned from Arthurian 
stories. In the career of Huon de Bordeaux, as is well known, 
we are following a hero who treads the dividing line between 
the chanson de geste and the romance, and whose world is 
peopled quite as fully with the typical figures of Breton story 
as with those of the Carolingian epic. These passages, then, 
from the Roman de Troie and the Huon, considered apart from 
the special phase of tradition embodied in each, are to be 
regarded merely as evidence of Morgain’s prominence in 
Arthurian fairy lore.

Another distinction which separates Morgain from the Dame 
du Lac and Niniane is that, although as Arthur’s sister she is 
connected more conspicuously with him than with any other 
mortal, she has both amorous and hostile relations with many 
knights. Furthermore, it cannot be said that in her character 
any one trait is so far emphasized as to cast the others into the 
shade. As we survey the entire Morgain saga, we find her 
manifesting her power in a wide range of capacities, as the 
mistress of the healing art, the seductive amie, the revengeful 
schemer, the guardian of a young knight. If we glance over 
the earliest extant passages relating to Morgain, which extend

see her described as a supernatural maiden who heals Arthur’s 
wounds after his final battle at Camlan,! as the maker of a 
magic balsam,” as the acme of beauty and skill; she is said to 
be the sister‘ and also the niece of Arthur ;°® she is the beauti- 
ful lady of Avalon,® and the love of its lord ;’ she is represented 
as the slighted mistress who seeks revenge upon a mortal favor- 
ite for spurned love.’ We learn that she is endowed with the 
gift of prophecy,® the power of shape-shifting ” and of transform- 
ing the shapes of mortals," an amorous and also’a quickly 
revengeful nature.!8 In other words, we find no one theme, as 
in the case of the Dame du Lac and Niniane, around which, 
even in our early sources, the allusions centre, and we see that 
the typical attributes of a fay are assigned to Morgain. We 
may safely say that she is by far the most important fay por- 
trayed in the romances, and that she is essentially the Fairy 
Queen of Arthurian legend. Further than this we cannot go 
without a more detailed examination of her doings. 
Morgain has never been made the subject of special investi- 
gation. Few important studies in Arthurian romance fail to 
mention her, but recent discussion has dealt only in a cursory 
fashion, without undertaking anything elaborate, with her name 
and possible origin. To examine fully the conception of her 
nature as it is represented in the sources of the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries, and to trace, if possible, the historic 
development of her character, in ‘the hope of obtaining light 
upon the wider subject of fairy mythology, no one has hitherto 
attempted.

  The Fairy Queen 9 
Morgain’s name has been interpreted in sundry ways, and 
invariably connected with the sea. Freminville explained it as 
an alteration of Morg-wen, “blancheur de mer, écume de mer.” ! 
Maury classified her with the fées des eaux, and said: “On 
doit remarquer la grande ressemblance qui existe, entre ce nom 
de Morgane et ceux de muir gheilt, murd hucha’n merrow, sous 
lesquels on désigne en Irlande, les mermaids.”’?  Villemarqué,® 
according to Maury, “tire l’etymologie de... [Morgain] de 
Gan, prophéte.” Grimm‘ derived it from the Breton mor, 
“meer,” and gwen, “splendens femina.’’ The only attempts to 
connect Morgain with a definite personage in story have been 
made by Rhys and Ferdinand Lot. Owing to the fact that the 
earliest spelling of Morgain’s name, that in the Vita Merlini, 
is Morgen,®> Rh¥s connects her name with the Welsh Muzri- 
genos (Mori-genos), Muri-gena (Mori-gena), “née de la mer.” ® 
In a recent work he refers to the name Morgain or Morgan as 
that « given in French romances to one or more water ladies,” 7 
and has also said that “Morgan is, doubtless, to be taken to 
Stand for a Welsh Morgen, sea-born, and identified in point 
of etymology with the Irish Muirgen, one of the names of the 
aquatic lady Liban.” § ; 
The story of Liban is told.in one of the narratives contained 
in the Lebor na h-Uidre, the Aided Echach mheic Mhatireda 
(Destruction of Eochaid mac Mairidh).® 
A certain well in Ulster overflowed its banks. Liban, the daughter of 
Ecca, king of Ulster, was the only member of her race who escaped death 
in the flood. She was transformed into a salmon below the waist, and with 
her pet dog, which had been changed into an otter, she passed three cen- 
turies in the waters of the lake (Lough Neagh) which had been formed by

the overflowing of the well. At the end of this time, St. Comgall of 
Bennachar, or Bangor, sent Bevan mac Imle on a mission to Gregory. AS 
Bevan sailed over the sea he heard a chanting as of angels in the waters 
beneath him, and when he asked whence the song came, Liban replied that 
she made it, and forthwith told him her story, adding that her purpose in 
coming had been to bid him keep tryst with her a year from that day at 
innbher Ollorba. At the appointed day and place the nets were made 
ready, and the mermaid was taken in the net of a certain Fergus. “She 
was brought to land, her form and her whole description being wonderful. 
Numbers came to view her and she in a vessel with water all about her.” 
Soon a contest for her possession arose among. Comgall, Fergus and Bevan. 
By fasting they won a revelation from heaven which bade them yoke to the 
chariot in which Liban was placed two stags, and allow them to go with 
her wheresoever they would. The stags bore Liban away to tech Dadheoc. 
Then the clergy gave her her choice of being*baptized and going to heaven 
in the fulness of time, or of living on earth for three hundred years. “The 
election she made was to depart then. Comgall baptized her, and the name 
that he conferred on her was Muirghein or ‘sea-birth’ as before ; or perhaps 
Muirgheilt, ze. ‘sea prodigy,’ that is to say ge7/t in mhara, or ‘the prodigy 
of the sea.’”1 Liban Muirghein was afterwards worshipped as a saint at 
the town of Tec-da-Beoc. 
The Welsh name Morgen, however, Lot points out was in 
the twelfth century pronounced Morten: — 
“Le fait intéressant c’est l’existence d’un nom de femme 
irlandais écrit et prononcé ‘ Muirgen,’ et compris comme ‘ enfant 
de la mer.’. Pour qui connait les rapports entre les contes 
irlandais et les contes gallois, qui en dérivent en bonne partie, 
le passage du mot Muzrgen d’Irlande en Galles avec la croyance 
a l’Elysée celtique n’a rien que de fort admissible. Est-ce a 
dire que le nom et la chose n’aient pu passer également 
d'Irlande en Armorique? non, certes; mais la probabilité de 
cette hypothése est beaucoup moins grande. Nous croyons 
donc plus vraisemblable que Gaufrei de Monmouth ait emprunté 
sa description de l’ile fortunée et le nom de l’enchanteresse? 
a un conte irlandais, soit directement, soit plutdt par |’inter- 
médiaire d’un récit gallois.” ® 
Rhfs and Lot, it will be noticed, both base their conclusions 
on the form of the name, and do not emphasize a real connec- 
tion in story between Liban and Morgain. The main difficulty 
in accepting a theory that makes Morgain in her origin a

The Fairy Queen II 
mermaid or a fay of the sea is one that presents itself as soon 
as we have all of the Morgain material before us. Except in so 
far as she is the inhabitant of an island, Avalon, she is never 
connected with the sea before the romance of Floriant et 
Florete, a late source, where her association, with the water is 
probably due to the influence of local tradition in Sicily.1 
Moreover, although as we read the romances the Morgain saga 
seems to consist of utterly detached bits of tradition and fre- 
quently contradictory legends, when it is analyzed, it really 
arranges itself into a rather closely organized and entirely 
’ consistent body of material, representing a natural growth from 
a distinguishable germ, which, however, does not appear in any 
source in a form that we can be sure is original. This fact 
raises a presumption in favor of the view that we are not deal- 
ing with original Morgain material in our extant sources, and 
also that we must look behind them for some more distinct and 
important personality than that of the baptized Liban. 
There is in Irish mythology a figure whose attributes, legend, 
and name suggest the possibility that Morgain may be con- 
nected with her. This being is the Irish battle-goddess, the 
Morrigan. There are five ancient Irish goddesses of war, 
Neman, Ana, Badb, Macha, and the Morrigan; but the 
Morrigan occupies a position of peculiar prominence among 
them.2 She is the daughter of Ernmas, daughter of Ettarlamh, 
son of Nuada Airgedlamh, king of the Tuatha dé Danann,? the 
folk of the séde, or fairy hillocks. In the Yockmarc Emive 
(Wooing of Emer)* she is said to be the wife of the war-god 
Neit; but more often her husband is the Dagda, or great king, 
of the Tuatha dé Danann.> The special function of the Morri- 
gan among the battle-goddesses is, according to Hennessy,® to 
incite to deeds of prowess and to plan battle. Her attributes 
are, of course, primarily manifested in connection with strife

of one kind or another, and she aids in martial achievement 
both by direct encouragement and by her gift of prophecy. She 
is no unimportant figure in Irish story, and, in addition to her 
attributes as the promoter of strife, she has certain magical 
powers, notably knowledge of the future, the ability to create 
effects of nature, and versatility in shape-shifting.? 
The Morrigan has a more limited personality in the Celtic 
sources than Morgain has in the French romances. Her 
nature as a war-goddess is clearly defined, whereas Morgain 
exhibits the manifold activities of a fairy queen; but the resem- 
blance between them, even on a superficial examination, is too 
suggestive to be dismissed without consideration. As we study 
the Morgain saga, we shall see whether the more important 
individual episodes attached to Morgain’s name and the more 
pronounced relations in which she appears are paralleled in 
episodes and relations found in the legends of the Morrigan, 
and whether the attributes of the Morrigan are repeated in 
Morgain’s nature. In short, it remains for us to discover 
whether we can trace sufficient identity in saga between the 
war-goddess and the fay to indicate that there is more than 
a merely casual resemblance between them, and, if so, to detect 
how they are related. The simplest plan will be to examine in 
turn the episodes of Morgain’s career, noting on the way par- 
allels from the Morrigan legend when they occur. We may 
turn first to that episode which in its original form seems to lie 
nearest to early Morgain material and to offer the most easily 
recognizable parallel to a story told of the Morrigan. From 
this beginning we shall find that the important ‘remaining 
episodes of the Morgain saga follow in a natural sequence.

CHAPTER II 
MORGAIN’S HOSTILITY TO ARTHUR 
Tue Vita Merlini contains, as I have said, the earliest men- 
tion of Morgain in literature and brings her into connection 
with Arthur as the healer of his wounds in Avalon. Her part 
here stands out quite distinct from that in all other important 
episodes of the romances in which she is associated with the 
king, for in every remaining instance,! except ig late sources,? 
she is the perpetrator of some malign scheme against him. 
It may be said in general, then, that apart from those scenes 
in which Morgain tends the king’s wounds, her hatred of him 
is persistent and is the ruling motive of her career wherever it 
touches his. 
The French prose romances vary too greatly in the reasons 
that they assign for this hostility to leave us ground for sup- 
posing that they are giving us the true story of its origin. 
In the Lancelot, Morgain is said to hate both Arthur and 
the queen for the same reason, namely, that the lover of her 
youth had been the cousin of Guinevere, who had separated 
her from him. In the prose Zyistan® we learn that Arthur 
has banished Morgain from court because of her faithlessness. 
According to the Huth Merlin,’ Morgain’s hostility is roused 
by the death of her lover, Accalon of Gaul, at Arthur’s hands ; 
but before this has occurred she is said to cherish for Arthur 
the natural hostility of the evil toward the good. If we 
turn to a Fastnachtspiel” of the fifteenth century, we find 
that Arthur and his sister, an enchantress, are said to be on

    14 Morgain’s Hostility to Arthur 
unfriendly terms, and fuel is added to the flame because she is 
not included among the guests invited to a feast. Plainly the 
hostility of Morgain for Arthur must rest on some earlier 
foundation than any of the reasons given in these sources, 
where the narrators are evidently seeking to account in some 
way or other for a recognized, but not fully understood 
situation. 
A clue to the real cause is given in a long story told in the 
Huth Merlin’ and Malory,? relating Morgain’s efforts to use 
Excalibur, Arthur’s sword, against him. In the course of this 
narrative occurs an episode the analysis of which shows more 
clearly, perhaps, than that of any other the original theme in 
which Morgaineand Arthur probably were brought together. 
In the course of a stag-hunt, Arthur, Urien (Morgain’s husband), and 
Accalon of Gaul, her lover, are separated from their companions. Toward 
nightfall they find the wounded stag on the bank of a river, an easy victim 
for the king’s blow. Suddenly they espy a beautiful vessel, |silken-hung, 
speeding toward them down the stream. As soon as it touches shore they 
go aboard, and are gladly welcomed by twelve damsels, who lead them to 
luxurious couches for the night. 
In the morning when Urien awakes he is at Camelot with Morgain.® 
Accalon opens his eyes upon a meadow near a sparkling fountain not far 
from a great tower. Presently a dwarf sent by Morgain comes to him 
bringing Excalibur with the request that Accalon use it in a certain battle 
at she appoints for him on the following day. Arthur wakes to discover 
that he is imprisoned with many knights in a tower, the lord of which has a 
feud with his brother, which is to be settled by a contest between cham- 
pions. Arthur undertakes the battle, little suspecting that the collet 
has been concocted by Morgain, who, wishing to kill him, has arranged that 
Accalon, armed with Excalibur, shall be his opponent. In the meantime 
she sends to Arthur a sword made in the likeness of Excalibur, which he 
has previously given into her keeping. The appointed morning fjawna, and 
Arthur and Accalon, neither of whom recognizes the other, begin a furious 
combat in which Accalon gains the upper hand. The Dame du Lac, know- 
ing of Arthur’s danger, comes to his rescue just as Accalon is about to slay 
him, and casts an enchantment upon Excalibur that causes it to fall to the 
ground. Arthur at once secures it, and proceeds to overcome Accalon, but 
when he learns his opponent’s name and the part that Morgain has played 
in the affair, he pardons him. The two combatants go to a convent to have

their wounds tended, and there Accalon dies. Arthur sends his body to 
Morgain, with the message that he has[Excalibur in his own possession. 
Morgain hastens to the convent where Arthur is staying; she makes her 
way to his chamber, and finds him sleeping sword in hand. She seizes the 
precious scabbard, however, and hurries off with it, knowing that Arthur, 
while he wears this, can lose no blood.1_ When the king wakes and discovers 
his loss, he unhesitatingly {attributes the theft to Morgain, and sets out in 
pursuit of her. She flees swiftly across the open country, sees that Arthur 
is gaining fast upon her, and flings the scabbard far into the depths of a 
lake near at hand. Knowing that the Dame du Lac has come to the land 
for the express purpose of {protecting the king, and that therefore her own 
magic arts have no power over him, as the only means of safety, she trans- 
forms herself and her maidens into blocks of stone. Arthur recognizes her 
in her altered form and looks with horror on the fate that has overtaken 
her. When he has passed by, fhe breaks the spell.and goes on her way.” 
Later she sends him a taunting message to the effect that she is a shape- 
shifter and would have done something worse to him but for the protection 
that the Dame du Lac exercises over him. [In AZadory she reminds him “> 
that so long as she can turn herself into stone, she does not fear him.] ——] 
This long story falls naturally into three divisions: the fairy 
induction, the fight between Arthur and Accalon, and Morgain’s 
shape-shifting. 
i 
THE FAIRY INDUCTION 
The induction to the story resembles many another that 
recounts the entrance of a mortal into fairyland. In the Celtic 
stories cited,in the last chapter, the fairy mistress in person 
summons the hero whom she loves to the other world. But 
she is not limited to one method in accomplishing her ends, 
and we have a variety of inductions to our fairy episodes, 
recounting the means by which the fay draws the knight to 
her presence. A very ordinary form represents her as send- 
ing out a fairy messenger disguised as some tempting victim 
for the huntsman’s dart, usually a stag, a boar, or a bird, which 
lures the young knight to her domain.? Sometimes the pur- 
suit of the other-world messenger leads him to the bank of a

1 The magic boat is an extremely common means of passing from this world 
to the other. Connla sails with the fay to the Plain of Delight in her ship of

Liban to Fand in a boat of bronze (Zf. Celt., I, 183; cf. Hibbert Lectures, 
Pp. 343); cf. Marie de France, Guigemar, vv. 151 ff.; Partonopeus, vv. 702 ff.; 
below, pp. 66 ff. Perceval is sent by a fay across a stream in a boat that returns 
to her as soon as he has left it (Perceval, vv. 30,503-30,534). At the bidding of 
another maiden he enters a little vessel moored on a lake shore; the next day he 
finds himself in Cornwall, and the maiden has vanished (Léseth, § 315). See also 
Perceval, vv. 8725 ff. For other rudderless boats cf. the Wef de Joie, made by 
Merlin and sent by Mabon, the enchanter, to convey Tristan and Iseult from

Magic ships are frequently endowed with some peculiar virtue or beauty. Some 
sail by land as well as by sea. Merlin by means of art and precious stones makes 
such a vessel; Esglantine de Valon sails in it over sea and land to Arthur’s court, 
and predicts that it shall carry the king to Avalon (Prophecies, pp. 1xxii, 1xxiii; 
cf. below, p. 17, for the Mef de Joie which will be destroyed after the battle of 
Salisbury, when Arthur shall have left the kingdom of Logres ; see Léseth, § 324). 
This is doubtless a reflection of the ship sent by Argante to Camlan for Arthur; 
see p. 26. Cf. also Campbell, I, 244, 257. With these ships cf. the other-world 
horses that travel by sea as well as by land, Si/va Gadelica, II, 199, 295 ff.; see

    Morgain’s Hostility to Arthur 17 
to convey him, in obedience to her magic guidance, to the 
other world. 
A familiar example of this type of fairy induction is con- 
tained in the thirteenth-century romance of Partonopeus. 
Partonopeus is a young knight who, separated from his companions in a 
boar-hunt, wanders through the forest until he comes in sight of the sea. 
A boat sails up to the shore; he goes aboard, finds it unoccupied, falls 
asleep, and wakes to the discovery that he is far out at sea. The boat bears 
him to a beautiful palace, the dwelling of the fairy princess, Melior, with 
whom he enters upon a secret life of delight. She has ere this loved him 
for his valor, and has sent the boar and the enchanted boat to guide him to 
her side. 
The same kind of induction also occurs in an episode in the 
prose 7yistan,' although here the sender of the enchanted ship 
is not a fay, but a magician. 
Tristan, as he follows a stag in the chase, meets a damsel who induces 
him to go with her to the bank of a stream, where she shows him a marvel- 
lous vessel, the ef de Joie, made by Merlin, and destined to carry him 
with Iseult to Logres. Tristan immediately brings Iseult to the ship, and 
they sail gaily over the sea. They land at an enchanted island, where the 
vessel leaves them and vanishes from sight. When Tristan has performed 
two adventures successfully, the vessel appears as suddenly as it had van- 
ished, and the lovers once more set sail. The WVef de Joie speeds over the 
waters to its destination, the castle of Mabon the enchanter, who needing 
aid in performing a certain adventure has sent the vessel to bring Tristan 
to his land. 
In Floriant et Florete,2 Morgain herself employs a fairy boat 
to convey the young knight, Floriant, her fosterling, from her 
abode on Mongibel, where he has been brought up, to Arthur’s 
court. It transports him thither without guidance, then speeds 
swiftly back across the sea to Mongibel. The ship is described 
ships have been compared with the ships of the Phaeacians (Od., VIII, vv. 
557-563), which, pilotless and rudderless, sail wrapped in cloud and mist; see 
Dunlop-Liebrecht, p. 175. For several of the above references I am indebted 
to Dr. A. C. L. Brown, in whose article “The Round Table before Wace” 
(Studies and Notes, VII, 199, note 1) a further collection may be found; see also 
Id., 76., VIII, 79, note r; MacDougall, p. 147; cf. 289 ; Hartland, Sctence of Fairy

as a beautiful vessel made of ebony,! but the special feature 
emphasized is the hangings : 
Més or voil dire, 4 mon avis 
Com la nef iert encortinnée 
D’une cortine ; onc mius ovrée 
Ne fu, par le mien escient. 
Then follows an elaborate description, seventy-six verses in 
length, of the hangings? It looks as if a common tradition 
might be the basis of this account and that in the Huth Merlin, 
where the silken hangings of the ship are the only appoint- 
ments that receive attention: 
Li rois . . . voit venir a val l’iaue une nef couverte de drap de soie aussi 
vermeil coume une escrelate. Et estoit la nef si couverte de toutes pars 
qu’il n’i paroit riens de fust fors che qu’ e[rt] emprés l’eve . . . il trueve a 
entree un drap de soie tout vermeil, qui laiens estoit mis pour chou que 
on n’i veist se on ne fust dedens . . . il la veoient si biele et si cointe et si 
paree de drap de soie qu’il ne virent onques si biel lieu ne si envoisié que 
cil lour samble.® 
Morgain also employs a white stag to lead Floriant in the 
chase far from his comrades, up a mountain to the entrance 
of a beautiful castle. The stag vanishes from sight, and Flori- 
ant sees Morgain seated before him. She greets him with an 
embrace, and declares to him that he shall never leave her 
land.* 
In the light of these stories, we may recognize the induction 
in the Huth Merlin as evidently a true fairy induction, and the 
stag-hunt and fairy boat as elements that may have been used 
with Morgain’s name in an earlier source, which also perhaps 
influenced the author of Floriant et Florete. It should be said 
that the compiler of the Huth Merlin is capable of taking great 
liberties with his material. Like most of his class he is sadly 
prolix, and more than once he exercises his ingenuity by divid- 
ing an original adventure into sundry parts in order to make 
it do duty for several heroes. In the episode of la damoisele 
cacheresse,®° for example, one stag, one brachet, and one fay, all

of which properly belong together as the essentials for the 
adventure of a single hero, by a judicious arrangement supply 
three knights with difficult tasks, and the maiden herself in the 
end wanders off with still a different lover. So here, by means 
of one hunt and one fairy ship, three heroes are transported to 
three different places. When they awake, the magic ship has 
vanished, and sorry adventures await them all. Not one of 
them is borne by the boat, as we should naturally expect, to 
the love of a fay. Plainly we are dealing with material that 
has been distorted from its original form, 
TD 
THE FIGHT BETWEEN ARTHUR AND ACCALON 
When we select from the episode the features that are 
grouped about Arthur, we find that they simply tell how he 
was brought by a magic hunt and boat to an imprisonment 
designed for him by Morgain, how by her he was made to fight 
in disguise with his own knight, and how at the moment when 
through her agency he was about to suffer death by his own 
sword at the knight’s hands, he was rescued by the power of 
the Dame du Lac. With these points in mind it is of interest 
to turn to another episode, appearing in five sources, in which 
Arthur is represented as detained in the other world by a fay 
for purposes of her own. 
The French prose Zyistan1 is the earliest source for the 
story. 
A maiden arrives at Arthur’s court, and on the pretext of an adventure 
summons him to her tower in the forest of Darnantes. Here she slips on 
his finger an enchanted ring that leads him to forget the queen and give her 
his love. But a damsel of the Dame du Lac comes to him, tears the ring 
from his finger, and advises him to behead the maiden of the tower. As 
Arthur is on the point of putting this advice into effect, the lady calls her 
brothers to her rescue, and is herself about to behead Arthur, when Tristan 
led by a damsel appears upon the scene and saves the king. 
The same story is told with variations, not important for our 
purpose, in the Italian 7yistano,? a compilation probably belong- 
ing to the end of the thirteenth century, in the Zavola Ritonda,? 
1 Léseth, § 74 a. 2 Pp. 333-346. 3 I, 221-226,
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 Morgain’s Hostility to Arthur 
written in the end of the thirteenth or the early fourteenth 
century, and in Malory! The essentials are practically the 
same throughout the versions. Arthur is enticed by a fay to 
her dwelling, where he lives for a time in forgetfulness of his 
home and the queen; when at length he remembers the queen 
and no longer desires the fay’s love, she seeks to destroy him. 
He is obliged to fight with her knights or with his own who 
are in disguise. He is about to be slain [in Malory, with 
his own sword] in the contest when, through the agency of 
the Dame du Lac, he is rescued.” 
It will be noticed that, if we exclude the king’s sojourn with 
the enchantress, the main features of this story agree with 
those of the episode in the Huth Merlin. In this latter source 
the true fairy induction, which, as a rule, leads a hero to the 
love of a fay, is attached to a story in its scene barely suggest- 
ing fairyland, while in its conclusion it is identical with the 
account of Arthur's stay in the other world with the enchantress. 
Of this latter episode the central part tells the story of a fay’s 
revenge for rejected love. The question that naturally suggests 
itself is whether the enchantress of the story was originally 
Morgain, or whether in the Huth Merlin a theme told else- 
where of another personage is applied to Morgain, with the 
part of the enchantress omitted. We may be sure that if this 
role were originally Morgain’s, by the time when the prose 
romances in which she is always Arthur’s sister were being 
compiled, necessarily the story as a whole would be applied to 
some one else or the love theme would be omitted. This is 
exactly the condition in which we find the episode; the Huth 
Merlin exhibits the latter stage, the other versions the former. 
There are minor indications that Morgain, in the early story, 
was the fay who summoned Arthur to the other world to win 
his love. In the first place, with the exception of the Zavola 
1 Bk. IV, ch. 16. 
2 For this episode see also Prophecies, p. xx: a maiden who dwells with Queen 
Morgain will so enchant Arthur that he shall forget his court. She will make 
him joust with her men; he shall be rescued by one of the good knights of the 
world. Besides the above versions, there is an echo of the same episode in 
other sources. See, especially, Paris, R. 7. R., IV, 48, 55-58, 80-83; cf. below, 
pp- 97, 98. See Perceval, 1, 242 ff.: Arthur is imprisoned by the Lady of the 
Waste Manor, who sends for her knights to joust with him. He is saved by 
Lancelot.
-P-A-G-E-33
Morgain's Hostility to Arthur 21 
Ritonda, which is a late romance and evidently is engrafting 
another story upon that of the enchantress, the only source in 
which the fay is given a name is Madory, here she is called 
Annowre, a name which we shall see may possibly have 
become confused with Morgain.! In the Prophecies the enchant- 
ress is one of Morgain’s damsels. Another fact adding to the 
probability that Morgain was the original enchantress is that 
the Dame du Lac invariably destroys the maiden’s power and 
rescues the-king. Morgain and the Dame du Lac frequently 
appear as opposing influences,? and when the Dame du Lac 
employs her power to befriend Arthur it is usually for the 
purpose of thwarting some scheme of Morgain’s. 
More suggestive, however, than either of these considerations 
is Benoit de Sainte-More’s account of Hector’s experiences with 
Morgain. Hector monta sor Galatée 
Que li tramist Morgan la fée 
Qui moult l’ama et le tint chier, 
Més ne la volt o sei colchier, 
Et por la honte qu’ele en ot 
Si l’en hai tant com plus pot. 
Co fu li trés plus biax chevax 
Qu’ainz chevalchast nus hom mortax.’ 
This reference to Morgain’s love for Hector is altogether 
unique, but it affords definite proof that the story of the 
flouted fay whose love turned to hatred was told of her at a 
comparatively early period. 
Beside this passage, which contains one of the earliest refer- 
ences to Morgain that we have,‘ and beside the account of the 
rejected love of the enchantress and her consequent desire to 
kill Arthur, there should be placed a scene in the Morrigan’s 
career, which is described in the Lebor na h-Uidre in an early 
twelfth-century recension of the Taiz Bo Cuailgne.® 
1 See pp. 139 ff. This maiden’s name appears in Geoffrey, Wace, and Lazamon 
as that of a daughter of Ebraucus, the founder of the Castle of Maidens (Edinburgh). 
In Geoffrey (Hist. Reg. Brit., Bk. II, ch. viii) the form is Anaor ; in Wace (Brut, 
vv. 1605, 1606), Avor ; in Lazamon (Brut, v. 2719), Annore. 2 See Chap. XII, iii.

-P-A-G-E-34
22 Morgain’s Hostility to Arthur 
“Cuchullin saw draw near him a young woman of surprising form, 
wrapped also in a mantle of many colours. ‘Who art thou?’ he asked. 
She made answer: ‘ Daughter of Buan the king. I am cometothee. For 
the record of thy deeds I have loved thee, and all my valuables and my 
cattle I bring with me.’ ‘Surely,’ he said, ‘the season is not opportune 
in which thou hast come to us; my bloom is wasted with hardship nor, so 
long as in this strife I shall be engaged, is it easy for me to hold inter- 
course with a woman.’ ‘But in thy labor thou shalt have mine aid.’ He 
answered her: ‘Go to, not as putting my trust in a woman’s aid was it 
that I took this job in hand.’ ‘It shall go hard with thee,’ she said, 
‘what time thou settest-to with men and I come to take part against thee.’” 
She makes the same threats and Cuchulinn the same replies that they 
exchange in the conversation referred to below in the Zain Bo Regamna.’ 
Then she goes away from him. Later Cuchulinn meets in conflict the great 
warrior Loch. Then the Morrigan comes out of the szdhe to destroy 
Cuchulinn. She carries out her threats of shape-shifting and tries to 
hamper him in his fight. He fractures one of her eyes, and she does not 
succeed in preventing his final victory. 
There is then, as of the enchantress, so also of the Morrigan, 
a story telling how she vainly offered her love to a hero, how 
her resentment followed him, and how he visited her with 
forcible punishment ; and Morgain’s hatred of Hector is par- 
alleled by the Morrigan’s of Cuchulinn. 
It is not possible to regard any of the points noticed above 
as more than considerations increasing the probability of an 
original story to the effect that the fairy queen offered her love 
to Arthur, that he dwelt with her for a time, rejected her love, 
and thus incurred her displeasure, leading her to attempt to 
work him harm. She may have been represented as enticing 
him to her by a fairy stag and boat. A parallel to one possible 
stage that the story may have assumed before it passed into the 
Huth Merlin is afforded by the account given in Malory? of 
a fairy adventure of King Meliodas of Liones. 
-“[The wyf of Melyodas] was a ful meke lady | and wel she loved her 
lord | & he her ageyne |... Thenne ther was a lady in that countrey that 
had loued kynge Melyodas longe | And by no meane she neuer coude gete 
his loue therfore she lete ordeyne vpon a day as kynge Melyodas rode on 
huntynge | for he was a grete chacer | and there by an enchauntement she 
made hym chace an herte by hym self alone | til that he came to an old 
Castel | and there anone he was taken prysoner by the lady that hym loved.” 
Merlin releases him.

    Morgain’s Hostility to Arthur 23 
Of the many extant episodes in which Morgain and Arthur 
are concerned there is only one other that has value in enabling 
us to determine Morgain’s relation to the story of the enchant- 
ress, and to discover if the episode of the Morrigan from the 
Tain Bo Cuailgne is repeated in Morgain’s life and connected 
with Arthur. This is the important story of the sojourn of 
Arthur in Avalon, which will be discussed in the next chapter. 
III 
MORGAIN’S SHAPE-SHIFTING 
Before turning to Arthur’s sojourn in Avalon we have one 
more feature of the narrative in the Huth Merlin to examine, 
namely, the strange account of Morgain’s shape-shifting. 
In the picture of her flight and sudden transformation of 
herself into stone there is far more of the wild mystery that 
pertains to Celtic legend than in any other episode related of 
her; and even with no further support than this characteristic, 
it is scarcely unsafe to affirm that we are here fairly close to 
early material. Yet Gaston Paris says: ‘“ L’enchantement dont 
Arthur est l’objet de la part de sa sceur Morgue, son com- 
bat contre Accalon, ...la fuite et les prestiges de Morgue, 
paraissent ne se rattacher a aucun récit subséquent et étre 
sortis uniquement de l’invention de l’auteur.” 1 
It is indeed an isolated case in the Morgain saga, and appar- 
ently in the French romances.2 The Zain Bo Regamna, how- 
ever, one of the introductory tales to the Taiz Bo Cuailgne,?

2 See p. 216 for examples of the transformation of living beings into stone by 
the magic stroke of a sorceress. Petrifaction as a punishment for disregard of 
some magic injunction or divine law is almost too common in folk-stories to 
demand example; see, e.g., Hartland, The Legend of Perseus, London, 1896, III, 
96 ff., 129; Maury, p. 48; Wood-Martin, Pagan Jreland, London, 1895, pp. 303, 
304. For trolls petrified at dawn, see Bugge-Schofield, Zhe Home of the Eddic 
Poems, London, 1899, pp. 236-240, 254. For magic means used to avoid capture 
in pursuit, see Mabinogion, III, 358, 359; Campbell, I, 32-34. None of these 
references, however, offers a parallel to the Morgain episode.

  24 ? Morgain's Hostility to Arthur 
describes a meeting between the Morrigan and Cuchulinn that 
should be noted in connection with this story of Morgain’s 
shape-shifting. 
The Morrigan is driving away from the Sidh of Cruachan a cow that she 
has taken for purposes of her own. Cuchulinn is roused from sleep by a 
terrible cry, and as he hastens out to follow the sound, he meets a chariot 
harnessed with a one-legged chestnut horse, through whose body the pole of 
the chariot passed. “ Within the chariot sat a woman, her eye-brows red, 
and a crimson mantle round her.... A big man went along beside the 
chariot . .. while he drove a cow before him.” Cuchulinn remonstrates with 
her for driving away the cow, insisting that all the cattle of Ulster belong to 
him; but she meets his reproof defiantly. He is about to spring into the 
chariot so as to threaten her with his spear, “but horse, woman, chariot, 
man and cow all had disappeared. Then he perceived that she had been 
transformed into a blackbird on a branch close by him. ‘A dangerous 
enchanted woman you are,’ said Cuchullin.... ‘If I had only known that 
it was you, we should not have parted thus!’ ‘Whatever you have done,’ 
said she, ‘will bring you ill-luck!’” She threatens further that when he is 
engaged in combat with a man as strong as himself she will become in turn 
an eel, a gray wolf, and a white, red-eared cow, and in each shape will 
hinder him from victory. He vows that he will hurt her in every guise, and 
never give her help if she does not leave him. Thereupon the Morrigan 
departs into the Sidh of Cruachan, and Cuchulinn goes to his own dwelling. 
If we analyze this episode we find that structurally it bears 
a resemblance to the story of Morgain’s transformation. The 
Morrigan is carrying away property that Cuchulinn claims as 
his; Morgain is_stealing Arthur’s scabbard. Both Cuchulinn 
and Arthur rise from their sleep~to—hasten out in pursuit. 
Cuchulinn is about to attack the Morrigan when she and the 
cow vanish from sight, and she reappears in a changed form ; 
Arthur is on the point of overtaking Morgain, when she flings 
the scabbard out of sight into the lake and shifts her shape. 
The Morrigan reminds Cuchulinn that she can transform herself 
at her pleasure, and threatens him with destruction ; Morgain 
reminds Arthur that while she can transform herself into stone 
she does not dread him. 
The differences in detail are too great for much importance 
to be attached to the parallel, which, however, when added to 
other resemblances that exist between the sagas of Morgain 
and the Morrigan demands a certain degree of consideration.

  CHAPTER III 
THE SOJOURN OF ARTHUR IN AVALON 
I 
Ir is rare to find so excellent an illustration of the pliability 
of romantic material for narrators’ purposes as that which is 
offered in the literary treatment of Arthur’s connection with 
Morgain in the other world. The theme is handled by chroni- 
clers in prose and verse, in Latin as well as in the vulgar 
tongues, by learned poets, by a compiler of popular stories, by 
the compilers of French prose romances, and by the author of 
a late poetical romance.! Furthermore, we know something 
of the methods of a few of those who have reported the story, 
and can interpret their silence or elaborations by means of our 
acquaintance with their habits. For example, Geoffrey of Mon- 
mouth, in his avowed vé/e of historian, dips only far enough into 
romance to give the bare outer form of the tradition: Sed et 
tnclytus tlle Arturus rex letaliter vulneratus est, qui illine ad 
sananda vulnera in insulam Avallonis advectus, etc.2 Wace 
connects the “ Breton hope” with Avalon, but he treats it with 
a characteristic caution, and adds to Geoffrey's mention only 
the expectation of Arthur’s people that the king will return 
to them. 2 En Avalon se fit porter

In our sources for the legend that is incorporated here, the 
Argante of Lazamon is an isolated case. The supernatural 
woman who heals Arthur’s wounds, according to all sources 
except one,! where she is unnamed, is Morgain. The Vita 
Merlini, earlier than La3jamon’s Brut by half a century, gives 
evidence that before his time tradition had made Morgain 
the healing lady of Avalon ;* and, although there is reason to 
believe that the story recorded by Lajamon survived in sundry 
developments and was rationalized,® it is to Morgain that these 
developments and rationalizations are all attached. Argante 
is apparently the feminine of Avgant (brilliant), a masculine 
name which we find in its simple form as early as 869 in the

it into his story by mistake or deliberate intention, perhaps 
simply through the almost unconscious process by which nar- 
rators at all times have been prone to substitute for an unfa- 
miliar name one that is familiar, resembling the original in 
sound. This is exactly what Lazjamon is doing when for Mar- 
gan, the name of a British leader that he found in his source, 
he uses Morgan,’ which was an exceedingly common mascu- 
line name in his day. All the more readily then, since Mor-

name at his time,! would he turn from any one of these forms 
with its baffling masculine appearance to a familiar Argante. 
It is scarcely necessary to say that the story in the Vita 
Merlini of the mistress of the /wsula Pomorum cannot have 
been Laz3amon’s source. There is abundant evidence that he 
was not averse to elaborating Wace’s record by the introduction 
of current Celtic folk tales,? and substantially the same story 
that he tells in one passage is given in a brief and condensed 
statement by two of his contemporaries, Gervasius of Tilbury 
and Giraldus Cambrensis,? both of whom, by the terms in 
which they refer to it as the idle concoction of Breton story- 
tellers, show that they have not derived it from a literary source. 
Lazamon’s account of Arthur’s departure from earth contains 
one of the commonest themes of fairy lore, —the fay’s sum- 
mons of the hero to fairyland. This theme has a place compar- 
atively early in the Morgain material, where it is represented 
by the Bataille Loguifer, and it is repeated of Morgain more 
often perhaps than any other. But in Lazamon there is present 
an element somewhat foreign to the usual situation. The love- 
motive is always the prominent and inevitable feature when 
the fay takes the knight to her abode, and it is not to the 
wounded hero that she is attracted. When she comes upon 
the scene as a healer she is usually engaged in a beneficent 
rather than an amatory errand. She protects the hero whom 
she already loves from receiving wounds,® but her love is not 
first drawn to a knight in the hour of his weakness. The 
only source in which the love-motive is defined is the late 
Gesta Regum Britanniae,> where the result of the king’s 
healing is nothing more or less than a fairy imprisonment

  The Sojourn of Arthur in Avalon 29 
exercised by the queen of the other-world island, whither he 
has gone :— z sanati membra reservat 
ipsa sibi ; vivuntque simul si credere fas est. 
It is almost a commonplace in romantic tradition that with 
the name of a great hero there should be connected the story 
of a fairy retention. Cuchulinn, Oisin, Merlin and Ogier, all 
came under the sway of a fairy mistress, and the idea that 
there was an original theme which we know only through 
a transformed version, allotting to Arthur’s share an amorous 
sojourn in fairyland, receives a limited support by analogy 
with the experiences of other heroes.1_ We are, however, by 
no means reduced to such vague associations as these in 
detecting the original that lies behind Laj3amon’s account. 
Celtic literature supplies a tradition which is peculiarly 
instructive when compared with La3amon’s narrative, and 
which proves to be highly important in explaining the account 
of Arthur’s stay with Morgain in Avalon, as well as Morgain’s 
relations to both Arthur and Guinevere. This is the story of 
the summons of Cuchulinn to the other world by Fand, told in 
the Serglige Conchulaind (Cuchulinn’s Sick Bed ),* which is pre- 
served in the Lebor na h-Uidre,? and therefore represents 
material very much older than the earliest extant versions 
of the story of Arthur in Avalon. 
Two beautiful birds alight one day on a lake near which the Ultonians 
are assembled, and sing a low melody that lulls the hearers to sleep. 
Cuchulinn makes an attempt to slay them, but his efforts are in vain, and 
he goes apart from his comrades, melancholy and aware that drowsiness is 
1Some such lingering tradition Spenser may have had before him. He 
describes Arthur (7aixy Queen, I, ix, 13-15) after a day spent in “ranging 
the forest wide on courser free,” alighting from his horse and being overcome with 
sleep as he stretches himself out wearily on the grass at the foot of a tree. 
Whether he dreamed or whether it were true he could not tell, but it seemed to 
him that a beautiful maiden appeared to him and bade him love her, remained 
at his side, and “at her parting said she Queen of Fairies hight.” Ever after 
Arthur sought her eagerly.

stealing upon him. Two strange women draw near him smiling, and in 
turn they stroke him with switches that they carry. When his strength 
fails, they leave him, and he lies in a long trance, after awaking from 
which he remains for a year without uttering a word. Then a stranger 
comes to him, and sings of two women who can give him back his strength; 
they are Liban, the wife of Labraid, who dwells in the Plain of Delight, 
and her sister, Fand, who is filled with love for Cuchulinn. 
His message given, the stranger departs. He is soon followed by 
another messenger from Fand, her sister Liban, one of the two women who 
had given Cuchulinn the strokes with the switches. If Cuchulinn will come 
with her to the Plain of Delight, and fight against the enemies of Labraid, 
his reward shall be nothing less than Fand’s love. The weakness which he 
pleads as an excuse need be no obstacle in his way, for he shall be healed 
of his disease and shall regain the strength that he has lost. This promise 
induces Cuchulinn to send his charioteer with Liban in her little bronze 
boat to Fand’s island; and when the charioteer returns, at his description 
of the marvellous charms of the land and of its mistress Cuchulinn feels 
refreshed and strengthened. Again Liban comes for him, and this time he 
sails with her to the Plain of Delight. Here he overcomes Labraid’s ene- 
mies, and passes a month of happiness in the love of Fand. When he must 
perforce leave her for Ireland, they arrange a tryst at Ibar-Cind-Trachta. 
Emer, Cuchulinn’s wife, hears of the proposed meeting, and hastens to the 
appointed place, armed and attended by fifty women, with the intention of 
killing Fand. Cuchulinn protects Fand from Emer’s violence, but his wife’s 
chidings and grief stir his pity, and he avows his loyalty to her. Fand 
acknowledges Emer’s prior claims, and realizes that she must relinquish 
Cuchulinn ; but she declares that by his desertion of her, he loses her love. 
Cuchulinn is seized with madness, as he sees Fand turn to leave him, and it is 
only by means of a druidical draught of forgetfulness that he and Emer are 
brought back to their former happy estate. Manannan mac Lir, Fand’s hus- 
band, shakes his cloak between the lovers that they may never meet again. 
The essential elements of this long story, it will be noticed, 
represent also those of both the Arthur-Avalon episode and 
the story of Arthur and the enchantress. In the former, just 
as two women summon Cuchulinn to the other world, whither, 
induced by Fand’s promise of healing, he sails in a boat guided 
by a fairy messenger, so two fays come for Arthur, and in a 
magic boat convey him to the other world for the healing of 
his wound; there he, like Cuchulinn, dwells with a beautiful 
fairy queen. In the enchantress story also, Arthur passes a 
period in the oblivion of the other world with a fay who has 
summoned him to her. When, like Fand, she sees that the 
force of her spell wanes, and that with revived memories of
-P-A-G-E-43
  ‘ 
The Sojourn of Arthur in Avalon BL 
the queen the hero no longer submits to her power, her love 
ceases. If, then, we presuppose that a story similar to that of 
Cuchulinn and Fand was attached to Arthur and a fairy queen, 
we may understand the two developments seen in the accounts 
of Arthur’s experiences in Avalon with Morgain, and in the 
tower with the enchantress. The latter episode, it is evident, 
reveals a somewhat less contaminated phase of the early 
material, since it includes the king’s forgetfulness of the queen 
while he is enjoying the love of the fay, and also the remem- 
brance of her as the motive force in inducing him to leave the 
fairy mistress, elements neither of which has a place in the 
Avalon episode. The course may be traced, however, by which 
the original material was worked over into the form in which 
we find it in the latter. 
There is one essential difference between Fand’s summons 
of Cuchulinn and Argante’s summons of Arthur as La3amon 
records it. Both heroes, it is true, go to the other world for 
healing, but Cuchulinn’s so-called disease, like the magic sleep 
caused by the song of the enchanted birds, is simply the evi- 
dence: that he is within the fairy power. He himself sends 
word to Emer during his debility that fays have injured him. 
Just as the maiden from the Plain of Delight exerts her power 
over Connla through the magic apple that fills him with long- 
ing for her in her absence, so the destruction of Cuchulinn’s 
strength is the means used by the fay to induce him to come 
to her land. Arthur, on the contrary, is not under the influ- 
ence of a druidic trance, but his wounds have been received 
on a well-fought field, where he has performed many deeds of 
valor. : 
What significance shall we attach to this difference in the 
situations? Two considerations are important in an analysis 
of the Arthur-Avalon episode, the conception of the hero him- 
self and that of the being who allures him. The legend that 
represents Arthur in Avalon enjoying the healing touch of a 
fay embodies only one of the phases assumed by the belief of 
the Britons that Arthur had fallen at Camlan. The antici- 
pation of the king’s return to this world as a deliverer of his 
oppressed countrymen had taken remarkably deep root in the 
national imagination certainly by the early part of the twelfth
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 The Sojourn of Arthur in Avalon 
- 
century.! In the early records the tradition does not show itself 
crystallized into any oneform. Arthur is the exalted hero whom 
his people refuse to believe dead, and whose return from a vague 
resting-place they fondly anticipate; and by far the larger part 
of the allusions to this belief in the literature of the second half 
of the twelfth century partake of the same indeterminate char- 
acter.2. In consideration of the indefinite form in which the 
tenacious tradition persisted, it is not surprising and is in fact 
an illustration of no unfamiliar principle in the growth of myth, 
to find it differentiated into four varieties. Thus, according 
to one form of the tradition, Arthur has gone to Avalon for 
healing. Again he sleeps in an enchanted cave, waiting for 
the spell that holds him to be broken.‘ He is the leader of the 
wiithendes Heer» He lives transformed into a raven.® 
Of these four traditions the first is the earliest to make its 
appearance in literature and is the most persistent in literary 
sources ; for traces of the story that Arthur rests at Avalon 
are to be detected in the later chroniclers’ accounts of his 
burial at Glastonbury, with which Avalon was identified? In 
this form of the tradition, the fay is by no means always in 
evidence, although the excuse for Arthur’s presence in Avalon 
is always the healing of his wound. We should not fail to

bear in mind that the hero of the story is Arthur, of whom 
there was the historic record that he had died fighting in battle, 
and concerning whom the all-absorbing thought to the fadz/osz 
Britones was that he still lived and would come back to them. 
So common in popular story was the theme of a mortal’s return 
to this world after a long period of oblivion in fairyland that 
almost inevitably Arthur’s resting-place had to be made Avalon, 
and his stay in the other world, which undoubtedly had a place 
in tradition, came to be identified with his life after death. 
In fact it is difficult to see how the three traditions, that Arthur 
was mortally wounded in battle, that he would return to this 
world after death, and that he was beloved by a fairy mistress, 
could escape the fate that moulded them into the Arthur- 
Avalon episode. Thus by the mingling of historic and romantic 
tradition with myth, the important element in the story became 
not the, love of the fay, but the cure of the wounds that 
Arthur, the British king, had received in his final battle. 
Hence the fay’s dispelling of the magic weakness that she has 
herself caused becomes the healing in Avalon of the king’s 
wounds, and the battlefield is the spot where she seeks him to 
take him under her peculiar care. 
Although neither Lazjamon nor Gervasius states expressly 
that the fay herself came to Camlan for Arthur, all the other 
versions represent Morgain as visiting in person the field of 
battle. Her office here calls to mind that of the Scandinavian 
battle-maidens, who choose for Odin the warriors wounded on 
the battlefield and bear them to Valhalla. Here, too, an echo 
of the Morrigan tradition is to be detected.

Saxonicae, Anglo-Danicae Scriptores XV, Oxford, 1691, I, 637; Boccaccio, De 
Cas. Vir. Zil., VIII, xcix. In the so-called Draco Normannicus, without mention 
of either Morgain or Avalon, there is a record of the king’s healing after Camlan: 
—ibique vulneratus sit, sed herbis fatalibus permixtis, adhuc vivit (Notices et 
Extraits des MSS. dela Bibl. du Roi, VIII, 306; cf. 298); and the Italian Lancz- 
Zotto, a romantic poem belonging to the second half of the fourteenth century, 
gives simply the story of a magic ship that bore Arthur away to an unknown land 
after Salisbury; the Britons look for his return, although it is said that he was 
found dead in a church dopo sua finita. (Li chantari di Lancellotto, ed. Birch, 
London, 1874, pp. 76, 77; Lancilotto Poema Cavalleresco, ed. Giannini, Fermo, 
1871, VI, 51, 52. The poem is also known as La Struzione della Tavola Ritonda.)

In the Aided Cuchullin) or The Death of Cuchulinn, the last 
advance of Cuchulinn’s foes against him is described. 
«And on the night before the Morrigan had broken the chariot, for she 
liked not Cuchullin’s going to the battle, for she knew that he would not 
come again to Emain Macha.” During the final battle, though powerless 
to aid Cuchulinn, in distress she hovers above him in the form of a crow, and 
after he has received his death-wound, she perches on a stone near him. 
When his enemies advance and slay him, the Morrigan, seeing that her 
mission is ended flies away from the scene.”

Rev. Arch., 3i*me série, XXXVI (1900), 70, for a description of two Gallo-Roman 
reliefs in which he identifies the figures of three birds with the Morrigan, 
Badb and Macha. 
Cervantes (Don Quixote, I, xiii) preserves the Breton hope in a unique form. 
El rey Artus, de quien es tradicion antigua y comun en todo aquel reino de la Gran 
Bretafia, que este rey no muri6, sino que por arte de encantamento se convertié en cuervo, 
y que andando los tiempos ha de volver 4 reinar y 4 cobrar su reino y cetro. 
See also 2., xlix. Cf. Persiles, I, 18: — 
[Error] deve de ser lo que las fabulas cuentan de la conversion en cuervo del Rey Artus 
de Inglaterra, tan creyda de aquella discreta nacion que se abstiene de matar cuervos en 
toda la isla.—No sé... de dénde tomé principio essa fdbula, tan creyda como mal 
imaginada. ; 
Among the statutes of Hoel the Good, who died in 993, there are two pro- 
hibitory of the slaughter of crows, hawks, falcons, eagles and cranes. (See 
Don Quixote, ed. John Bowles, London, 1781, I, xiii; III, 48.) This law, which 
arose from a desire to preserve useful birds, gave foundation according to Ticknor 
(Don Quixote, New York, 1897, p. 55, note 2) for the popular belief that Arthur was 
transformed into a crow. If a connection between Morgain and the Morrigan be 
established some light may perhaps be thrown upon this strange tradition. The 
Morrigan as a crow hovers over Cuchulinn until his death, when she takes her flight 
from the field; Morgain comes to the battlefield and bears Arthur away to Avalon. 
At this point of our investigation, we may recognize a possible treatment of these 
two traditions that resulted in the belief which we know through Cervantes. 
A modern Breton tale is cited by Bellamy (Za Forét de Bréchéliant, Rennes, 
1896, I, 129): — Morgain became enamoured of Arthur, transported him in a cloud 
to Avalon, made him forget Guinevere and finally allowed him to leave the island 
only in the form of a crow. He will regain his human form and return to earth 
to reign once more.

In the later versions the important features of the early 
story remain prominent. They are emphasized outside of the 
romances by Gervasius of Tilbury,! who stands chronologically 
next to Lajamon among the authors who mention the fay in 
connection with Arthur’s disappearance from earth, and also 
by Giraldus Cambrensis,? who in an effort to separate fiction 
from what he believes to be truth, in reality throws light upon 
certain features in the later tradition. He, in common with 
the majority of the chroniclers even so late as the fourteenth 
century,® regards as the idle story of fanciful Britons the tra- 
dition that Arthur would come again; and he is quite ready to 
believe that the king was buried in the island of Avalon, which 
as early as William of Malmesbury’s time had been identified 
with Glastonbury,‘ where in the latter part of the twelfth cen- 
tury © the monks announced that they had discovered Arthur’s 
tomb. Hence the story of the king’s sojourn in Avalon for 
the healing of his wounds is merged into that of his burial 
1 Otia Imperialia, ed. Leibnitz, I, 937 (see above, p. 27, note 7, for the date): — 
Arcturus vulneratur, omnibus hostibus ab ipso peremptis. Unde secundum vulgarem 
Brittonum traditionem in insulam Davalim ipsum dicunt translatum ut vulnera quotannis

  30 The Sojourn of Arthur in Avalon 
at Glastonbury.1 At this stage of rationalization the part of 
the maiden who tended Arthur in Avalon is naturally trans- 
ferred to a dignified kinswoman, who performed the last offices 
for the king. Even before the time of Giraldus and as early as 
that of Chrétien, Morgain had been made a sister of Arthur,? 
and this fact doubtless had its influence upon the sophisticated 
version that Giraldus records. 
The results of the transference of the story to this world are 
to be traced in at least four of the later versions, (1) La Mort 
Artus,? (2) Malory,* (3) Le Morte Arthur,> (4) La Tavola 
Ritonda.§ 
1It is not beyond possibility, although we have no direct evidence on the 
subject, that the tradition of Arthur’s voyage in a fairy boat to Avalon united the 
,more readily with the report of his burial in Glastonbury through the influence 
of legends that told of the mysterious rudderless ships, which without a pilot 
transported the bodies of saints to their place of burial, and thus revealed the 
divine preference of a certain spot for this honor. Cf. for the possible monastic 
influence upon the tradition of Arthur, Stephens, Literature of the Kymry, London, 
1876, p. 414. See Usener, Die Sintfluthsagen, Bonn, 1899, p. 137; Gervasius of

In all of these sources the situation in the beginning is practically identical. 
Arthur has been mortally wounded in the battle of Salisbury; he orders Giflet 
in 1, Sir Bedivere in 2 and 3, a squire in 4, to leave him on the edge of a stream. 
The remainder of the account I quote below from the separate versions. 
(1) Giflet s’éloigne lentement, non sans regarder derriére lui: il voit bientét aborder une 
nef de laquelle descendent plusieurs belles dames vétues de blanc, a leur téte Morgain la 
sceur d’Artus. Elles entourent le roi dont la faiblesse était extréme, et le transportent dans 
leur nacelle: puis au signal de la fée l'esquif s’éloigne rapidement et Giflet les perd de vue. 
Il regagna tristement la Noire Abbaye, ot il acheva ses jours, aprés avoir vu les fées venir 
y déposer les tombes de Lucan et du roi Artus. 
(2) “ And whan they were at the water syde euyn fast by the banke houed a lytyl barge 
wyth many fayr ladyes in hit | & emonge hem al was a quene | and al they had blacke 
hoodes | and al they wepte and shryked when they sawe Kyng Arthur | Now put me in to

this wounde on your heed hath caught ouermoche colde | And soo than they rowed from 
the londe | and syr Bedwere behelde all tho ladyes goo from hym.” _Bedivere cries in lamen- 
tation after the king, but Arthur bids him take comfort. “For I wyl in to the vale of 
auylyon to hele me,of my greuous wounde. And yf thou here neuer more of me praye for 
my soule | but euer the quenes and ladyes wepte and shryched that hit was pyte to here.” Sir 
Bedivere makes his way to a hermitage not far distant; he sees a new made grave in which 
the hermit tells him that a body is interred that was brought thither by some ladies the

  The Sojourn of Arthur in Avalon 37 
In these sources! the two lines of tradition that Giraldus 
kept distinct are blended. Throughout Morgain is so far a fay 
that she comes in her magic ship to bear the hero away to a 
night before. “Alas, sayd syr bedwere, that was my lord kyng Arthur that here lyeth 
buryed in thys chapel.... Thus of Arthur I fynde neuer more wryton in bookes that ben 
auctorysed nor more of the veray certente of his deth herde I neuer redde | but thus was he 
ledde aweye in a shyppe wherein were thre quenes | that one was kyng Arthurs syster quene 
Morgan le fay | the other was the quene of North galys | the thyrd was the quene of the 
waste londes | Also there was Nynyue the chyef lady of the lake.... More of the deth of 
kyng Arthur coude I neuer fynde but that ladyes brought hym to his buryellys | & suche one 
was buryed there that the hermyte bare wytnesse that somtyme was bysshop of caunterburye | 
but yet the heremyte knewe not in certayn that he was verayly the body of kyng Arthur.” 
(3) A ryché shyppe wyth maste And ore, 
Fulle of ladyes there they fonde. 
The ladyes, that were feyre and Free, 
Curteysly the kynge gan they fonge, 
And one, that bryghtest was of blee, 
Wepyd sore, and handys wrange, 
“ Broder,” she sayd, “wo ys me; 
Fro lechyng hastow be to longe, 
I wote that gretely greuyth me, 
For thy paynés Ar fulle stronge.” 
Arthur speaks to Bedivere : — 
“JT wylle wende A lytelle stownde 
In to the vale of Avelovne, 
A whyle to hele me of my wounde.” 
Whan the shyppe from the land was broght, 
Syr bedwere saw of hem no more. . 
He goes on the following day to a chapel, where he finds a new tomb in which 
he learns that ladies have buried a body on the preceding night. He is convinced 
that itis Arthur’s tomb. (Cf. King. Arthur’s Death, Bp. Percy’s Folio MS., ed. 
Hales and Furnivall, London, 1867, I, 506-507 :— 
But he saw a barge from the land goe, 
And hearde Ladyes houle and cry certainlye, 
but whether the king was there or noe 
he knew not certainlye. 
Cf. Parlement of the thre Ages, vv. 510, 511. After Arthur’s final battle he 
bids farewell to Gawain, who saw a boat 
‘There-Inn was sir Arthure and othire of his ferys 
And also Morgn la faye that myche couthe of sleghte.) 
(4) E stando per un poco, ed ecco per lo mare venire una navicella, tutta coperta di 
bianco ; e,quando lo re la vidde, si disse allo scudiere: — Ora é venuta mia fine. — E la nave 
s’accostd allo re, e alquante braccia uscirono della nave che presono lo re Arti e visibile 
mente il misono nella nave, e portdrollo via per mare. E lo scudiere, molto isbigottito, 
stette tanto quivi, quanto pot? vedere la nave; eppoi si parti, e va contando la maraviglia, 
E tale conveniente, si crede che Ja fata Morgana venisse per arte in quella navicella, e por- tdllo via in una isoletta di mare; e quivi mori di sue ferite, e la fata il sopelli in quella 
isoletta.

land over seas; but the reaction of the sophisticated version 
upon the fairy theme brings incongruous features into the story. 
Hence, fays inter Arthur in the Noire Abbaye according to 
the Mort Artus!; hence the statement in Malory that “ladyes 
brought hym to his buryellys,” and hence, too, the story of the 
Italian version that the king died of his wounds and that Mor- 
gain buried him on an island.?_ Hence perhaps also in Madory 
comes the feature of the black-hooded queens who “ wepte and 
shryked when they sawe Kyng Arthur.” ®

Having traced La3amon’s story back to the type which is its 
possible source, and forward in its later development,‘ we are in 
a position to examine the account of Morgain and Arthur in 
Avalon, contained in the Vita Merlini.5 The words are put 
into the mouth of the bard Telgesinus. 
Insula pomorum quae Fortunata vocatur, 
Ex re nomen habet, quia per se singula profert: 
Non opus est illi sulcantibus arva colonis, 
Omnis abest cultus nisi quem natura ministrat : 
Ultro foecundas segetes producit et uvas, 
Nataque poma suis praetonso germine silvis ; 
Omnia gignit humus vice graminis ultro redundans. 
Annis centenis aut ultra vivitur illic, 
Illic iura novem geniali lege sorores 
Dant his qui veniunt nostris ex partibus ad se: 
Quarum quae prior est fit doctior arte medendi ; 
Exceditque suas forma praestante sorores ; 
Morgen ei nomen, didicitque quid utilitatis 
Gramina cuncta ferant, ut languida corpora curet; 
Ars quoque nota sibi qua scit mutare figuram, 
Et resecare novis quasi Daedalus aera pennis ; 
1 See Paris, &. 7. &., V, 351, note 1. 
2 The Italian version introduces the mysterious arms undoubtedly under the 
influence of the immediately preceding incident telling of the arm that grasps 
Excalibur and draws it into the lake. 
8 For another suggestion, see Cuchullin Saga, p. xxix. 
4 There are three sources, beside those mentioned above, that treat of Arthur’s 
stay with Morgain in Avalon, but add nothing materially to the Morgain tradi-

In spite of the fact that this source antedates those that we 
have been examining, the story in La3amon’s Brut is clearly 
less removed from the original fairy theme. Different details 
and a different side of the situation are given here. The 
description of Morgain’s home scarcely allows it to be classed 
with such an island as the Plain of Delight, and if it were not 
for an interpretation of the name zzswla Avalloniae as insula 
pomorum, recorded in the first quarter of the twelfth century 
by William of Malmesbury,? we might suppose that the author 
was vaguely placing Morgain in one of the waxdpwv vioo that 
are as old as Hesiod.* For the island is surprisingly barren of 
many features characteristic of the Celtic other world. It is 
true that like fairyland, which is free from death, the insula 
pomorum is a place where life lasts for a delightfully indefinite

between the love-charm of throwing the apple, familiar in folk-lore, and the inter- 
pretation of Avalon as insula pomorum. That the apple symbolizes love or fruit- 
fulness is a very ancient and tenacious superstition. (See B. O. Foster, Harvard 
Studies in Classical Philology, X, Boston, 1899, 39-55). A natural conjecture is 
that the apple in Celtic story may have been known first as a love gift from the 
fay to entice the hero to her domain, and thence have come to be regarded as a 
common type of other-world fruit possessing magic qualities. The apple is particu- 
larly prominent in Celtic other-world stories, as is attested by many familiar 
examples.

period and where the inhabitants are women whose sway is 
complete.! In fairyland, however, the pleasures are sensu- 
ous in their quality :— splendid dwellings, gay eolors, feasts 
where the viands gratify each hero’s peculiar taste, the best 
of wine, sweet music, a marvellously beautiful woman? The 
delights of the island where Morgain lives are those that are 
scattered by nature. For seven verses the author harps on 
one string—the amazing fertility of the untilled soil. 
1 See Vita Merlini, vv. 916, 917. 
2In the course of the present study we shall meet many names applied to 
faérie—the J/e Celée, Terre Lointaine, Forét sanz Retor, Val sanz Retor, Ile d’Or, 
Chastel as Pucidles ; but none of these terms is used in a generic sense. The 
other world par excellence in the “ matter of Britain ” is Avalon, — ux isle gui mult 
est beals (Marie de France, Lanval, v. 661). It is the only pure and simple 
other-world abode that Morgain is represented as having in the French romances. 
The longest descriptions of Avalon that we have are those from the Vita Merlini, 
the Gesta Regum Britanniae (see p. 45) and the Bataille Loguifer, which has 
doubtless influenced the description of Avalon in the Ogier material. (See 
PP: 79; 133-135+) 
Avalon has received peculiar fame by being brought into connection with 
Arthur. For although the name is used in the broad sense of faérze, without 
special or individual associations (see Le Couronnement de Louis, ed. Langlois, 
Paris, 1888, vv. 1796, 1827, cf. AZS. C., v. 1598; Hist. Reg. Brit., Bk. IX, ch. iv;

below, pp. 52, note 2, 151, note 2, 226, note, for mention of a fay, the Dame d’Avalon, 
who is simply a powerful enchantress, but not Morgain), the number of pas- 
sages is comparatively small that do not mention it particularly as the place 
where Arthur sought healing for his wound received at Camlan (see above, 
Ppp. 25, 26, 35 ff.). Other passages occur in the romances that mention Avalon as a 
place of burial for Arthur and Guinevere. (See above, pp. 35 ff.; Perceval, I, 262, 
270, 348; Hist. Litt., XXX, 220.) These are probably to be explained as an out- 
come of the identification of Glastonbury and Avalon, which dates back certainly 
to the time when William of Malmesbury wrote his De Antiguitatibus Glastoniensis 
Ecclesiae (ca. 1135). See Migne, CLXXIX, col. 1687; cf. Morte Arthure, ed. 
Brock, London, 1865; also ed. Perry, London, 1865 (E. E. T. S.), vv. 4309, 4310; 
Arthur, ed. Furnivall, London, 1864 (E. E. T. S.), vv. 612-614; Zhe Life of 
Joseph of Armathia (Joseph of Arimathie, ed. Skeat, London, 1871, E. E. T. S., 
pp. 35 ff.), vv. 198, 199; Paris, R. 7. R., I, 88, 93, 98, 103. 
This identification, as Zimmer (Zs. f. fr. Sp. XII, 1890, 245 ff.) and Lot 
(Rom., XXIV, 1895, 329, 503; XXVII, 1898, 552, 553) have shown, may rest on 
false etymology, which led to the interpretation of the name as zwsu/a vitrea, ile de 
voirre, and hence to its association with the other world. (On the éle de voirre 
as a name for the other world, see Zimmer and Lot as above; Paris, Rom., X,

Far more than it resembles fairyland this island resembles 
the Fortunate Isles. In fact the description of the Fortunate 
Isles given by Rabanus Maurus? so closely parallels that of the 
Vita Merlini that the first eight verses of our passage read 
almost like a versification of the account of Rabanus :—

Furthermore it is to be noted that the zxsula pomorum is one 
in a list of islands of the sea treated individually by Telgesinus 
in a discourse on the wonders of nature,? and that this section 
of the Vita Merlini containing as it does a description of island

literature, especially, as Ferdinand Lot has observed,* to such 
an account as the Wavigatio Sancti Brendani. In the terra

with which the zxsula Fortunatorum was identified,® there pre- 
vailed the same luxuriant vegetation that is the chief character-

account of St. Brandan’s voyage, which is placed by Zimmer

known, an abiding influence on mediaeval thought,’ and we

repromissionis as it is portrayed in the Mavigatio; and it is 
not strange if the obverse of the situation is true, and the fea- 
tures of another mysterious island are in the Vita Merlini 
attributed to Avalon. A learned poet would naturally turn to 
the conceptions already expressed in Latin prose or verse, when 
he was describing the distant island to which Arthur was taken 
for healing, rather than to those usually stirred by the thought 
of Avalon as the abode of fays. 
If the author knew the story of the fairy messengers and 
boat that took Arthur to Avalon, he chose to disregard them 
and to make the king’s guide to the distant island, Barinthus.? 
Also, whereas the other versions which are giving an account 
of Arthur’s final battle do not carry the narrative to Avalon, in 
this case where the interest to the author centres in the island 
that he is describing, the scene of importance naturally lies 
there. Moreover, just as extraneous influences are evidently 
at work in the description of the island, so Morgain herself is 
not strictly speaking a pure other-world fay. She is beautiful, 
has the power of shape-shifting, and understands the healing 
art, all of which attributes belong directly to her fairy kind ; 
but of the true other-world fay it could not be said that she had 
learned mathematics, i.e., astrology.? There are early accounts 
of islands off the coast of Gaul, which offer in many respects a 
parallel to the Celtic Isle of Women. The most apposite here 
is that given by Pomponius Mela in his De Sitw Orbis®:— 
Sena in Britannico mari, Osismicis adversa litoribus, Gallici numinis oraculo 
insignis est: cuius antistites, perpetua virginitate sanctae, numero novem 
esse traduntur: Gallicenas vocant, putantque ingeniis singularibus praedi- 
tas, maria ac ventos concitare carminibus, seque in quae velint animalia 
12s. f. d. Alt, XXXIII, 144 ff.; see also Schréder, p. xi. 
2 See Brown, Rev. Celt, XXII (1901), 339 ff., for material showing that 
Barinthus or Barri (cf. Zimmer, Zs. f. vergl. Sprachf, XXXII, 160), who acts in 
both the Wavigatio Sancti Brendani and the Vita Merlini as a guide to the other 
world, was originally a Celtic sea-deity, serving properly as an other-world mes- 
senger. Thus his part in the original Arthur-Avalon episode would equate with 
that of Fand’s messengers to Cuchulinn in the Serglige Conchulaind.

Whatever source Mela was using, we may trace through his 
words the existence of a long-standing tradition that may have 
influenced Geoffrey when he wrote the Vita Merlini2 What 
would be a more natural process than for an author, when his 
mind was turning toward distant islands of the sea, to attribute 
to the fay of Avalon certain characteristics of the supernatural 
women who he may have heard were also the inhabitants of

tantem utrum apud eius posteros imperium permaneret. 
Salomon Reinach (Acad. des Inscr. et de Belles Lettres, Jan. 1897, 33; Rev. Celt, 
XVIII, 1897, 1 ff.) maintains that Mela’s account has no historic weight, and that 
it is due to an identification of Sena (i.e. Ouessant or the Isle de Sein) with Circe’s 
island during the Roman period, when the opposite coast was believed to be the 
spot where Ulysses had addressed the shades. See Rev. Celt., IX (1888), 279; 
X (1889), 352; Elton, Origins of English History, London, 1890, pp. 24 ff.; Rhfs, 
Celtic Folklore, Oxford, 1901, 331, note 1. 
2 Cf. Maury, p. 44; Rhfs, Ce/t. Folklore, 330, 331; and Meyer and Nutt, II, 
147-149. According to Mela there were nine priestesses of Sena, and though nine 
is a number too sacred to superstition (cf. Stokes and Windisch, IV, i, 342, Index 
of Things, s.v. nine; Silva Gadelica, Il, 202, 214, 239, 257; Mabinogion, I, 323; 
Bran, §§ 32, 62; Bugge-Schofield, Home of the Eddic Poems, p.266) for us to build 
upon this feature which is common to the two accounts, it is noteworthy, in con- 
sideration of the other resemblances, that Morgain is never made one of nine 
sisters except in the Vita Merlini. The necessity of naming her eight sisters is 
apparently embarrassing to the poet; he economizes by ringing three.changes on 
one name, — Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, and his ingenuity deserts him completely 
before he reaches the eighth. Where he found their names has never been 
determined (see Lot, Ann. de Bretagne, XV, 533, note 3), though two of them 
are suggestive of possible originals. /zten is suspiciously close to Thetis ; and 
we know that even so late as the composition of Der jiingere Titurel the silver- 
footed goddess of the sea survived as a lady of magic power, who serves as a 
gauge for the accomplishments in necromantic art of Accedille, Uterpendragon’s 
sister. Weder tetis noch sibille waren 
niht so richer kunst in wane. 
(Albrecht von Scharfenberg, Der jiingere Titurel, ed. Hahn, Quedlinburg and 
Leipzig, 1842, st. 2433.) 
With 7Zhetis as a possible basis for this name we can scarcely refrain from the 
conjecture that G/iten may be the distortion of the name of another sea-maiden, 
the unhappy nymph Clytie, the daughter of Oceanus, whose history our learned 
poet must have known through his Ovid (JZe¢. IV, vv. 256 ff.). If these guesses 
do hit the truth, the nominative in ex may be attributed to the influence of the 
form Morgen.

islands about which he had no definite information? We may 
readily see, therefore, even though we have no direct source 
for the tradition in the Vzta Merlini, how such a version as it 
contains might under recognizable influences have been evolved 
from the earlier fairy conception. 
Beside the passage from the Vita Merlini there should be 
placed some verses from the Gesta Regum Britanniae? 
Cingitur oceano memorabilis insula, nullis 
Desolata bonis: non fur, non predo nec hostis 
Insidiatur ibi; nec nix, non bruma nec estas 
1 Hartmann von Aue in his Zvec (vv. 5132-5241), instead of following Chrétien 
by simply mentioning Morgain’s avtret that healed Erec (see pp. 259, 260), 
describes at length a fairy plaster that the queen binds upon Erec’s wounds, which 
she had received from Famurgan, the king’s sister; and he follows this description 
with as long an account of Morgain as has come down to us (vv. 5156-5241), not 
excepting that contained in the Vulgate Merlin (see p. 151). Hartmann is cer- 
tainly relying on some material extraneous to his main source (see Bartsch in 
Pfeiffer’s Germania, VII, 1862, 165; Gruhn, Zs. f. d. Alt., XLIII, 1899, 298, 299; 
Erec, pp. xvii, xviii). His information about Morgain, although it presents simi- 
larities to the description in the Vita Merlini, sets forth the accomplishments of 
a true mediaeval sorceress, such as those, for example, described in the thirteenth- 
century romance of Amadas et Ydoine (ed. Hippeau, Paris, 1863, vv. 2007 ff.; 
cf. Cligds, vv. 3002 ff.). 
‘With Hartmann’s comparison of Morgain to those beings who can restore the 
dead to life, cf. the sorceresses who practice the same art by means of a touch or a 
balsam, Madinogion, I, 342; Perceval, VI, 185; Malory, Bk. VII, ch. 22, 23; 
Campbell, II, 463-465; III, 289; Campbell, Ze Fians, London, 1891, p. 247. 
We may easily believe that a tradition started by the Vita Merlini survived and 
reached Hartmann in a form to which there had been already added, or to which 
there was added by him, an unattached account of a sorceress. Some three quar- 
ters of a century later in the Prophecies (p. xcvi) we come across another tradition 
of Morgain in which she appears in a part that recalls Hartmann’s words. Here 
she is summoned to a contest of skill in magic by the Dame d’Avalon. She 
calls a legion of devils to her, changes half of them to dragons and half to birds, 
and commands them to carry the Dame d’Avalon through the air to a certain 
tower. Reading in her book of enchantment (cf. Gervasius of Tilbury, ed. Lie- 
brecht, p. 50, with note p. 160; Paris, R. 7. R., IV, 83; Sébillot, Trad. et Sup. de 
la H. Bretagne, 1, 300-304), she herself advances toward the castle of her intended 
victim, by whom she is regarded as a formidable rival (cf. p. 52, note 2). 
This is the only episode of just this kind connected with Morgain that is pre- 
served to us. She is referred to by Malory as a “sorceresse and wytche” 
(Bk. VIII, ch. 3), and a tradition, which looks like a survival of the early concep- 
tion of Morgain as a sorceress, is repeated by Reiffenberg:— “Dans certains 
villages, la plupart des vieilles mendiantes passent pour de vulgaires descendantes 
des Canidies et des Morgan” (Chevalier au Cygne, ed. Reiffenberg, Brussels, 
1846, I, Ixxxix).

other world has been pointed out by Lot? and by Nutt,? though 
what has been said above about the description of Morgain’s 
island in the Vita Merlini is also true here, and it is evident 
that the learned author has probably been influenced by cer- 
tain Latin models that dealt with other-world abodes of a non- 
Celtic origin, such for example as Lactantius pictured the home 
of the Phoenix to be: —# 
non huc exsangues morbi, non aegra senectus, 
nec mors crudelis, nec metus asper adit, 
nec scelus infandum, nec opum vesana cupido,

The Sojourn of Arthur in Avalon 47 
The Gesta Regum Britanniae is the only source except the 
Vita Merlint that places the scene in Avalon, and dwells on 
Arthur’s experiences there rather than on his summons to the 
other world. In spite, however, of the resemblances between 
the Vita Merlini and the Gesta Regum Britanniae, there is suf- 
ficient difference in the form of the story to exclude the idea 
that the author of the latter is borrowing directly from the 
former. The vegia virgo possesses no qualities that do not 
belong to the true other-world fay, and she is more nearly allied 
to the beguiling fairy mistress of Celtic stories, who retains 
with her the hero whom she has favored with her help, than to 
the Morgain of the zxsula pomorum. Clearly the thirteenth-cen- 
tury poem stands nearer to original conceptions than does the 
Vita Merlini, and the relation of the two versions is appar- 
ently that of two accounts using a common tradition, which in 
the Vita Merlini is more contaminated than in the later poem. 
IV 
For the sake of clearness, then, we may gather together the 
results of the preceding discussion : — 
1. In the story of Cuchulinn and Fand there is found a pro- 
totype which, if it became attached to Arthur’s name, accounts 
for the two developments that appear in romance describing 
his stay in the other world. 
2. One development of this story — the Avalon episode — 
is uniformly attached to Morgain’s name. In this episode a 
characteristic of the Morrigan as the guardian of her hero is 
seen in Morgain. 
3. The other development of this story which was discussed 
in the last chapter—the enchantress type—is not attached 
to Morgain’s name. Here there is a distinct reminder of the 
part played by the Morrigan in the story of her love rejected 
by Cuchulinn and her ensuing efforts to destroy him. 
4. In another episode attached to Morgain’s name, that of 
the fight with Accalon, which also was examined in the last 
chapter, Arthur is taken to her domains by the same means as 
in the Avalon story. The conclusion of this episode is iden- 
tical with that of the enchantress type.  
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 The Sojourn of Arthur in Avalon 
These facts are explainable by the view that Morgain was 
the fairy queen of the original story from which there sprang 
two developments, in both of which traces of the Morrigan 
are to be detected. Thus Morgain’s two-fold attitude toward 
Arthur is explained, and the ground for her feud with him as 
it appears in the romances made clear.! It is also evident 
that there are points of contact between the traditions of the 
Morrigan and important parts of the Morgain saga. 
1 The remaining episodes of importance in which Morgain is connected with 
Arthur are simply variations on the theme of her rancor against him, and are 
more appropriately treated below.

CHAPTER IV 
MORGAIN’S RETENTION OF RENOART, LANCELOT, AND 
ALISANDER L’ORPHELIN 
I 
RENOART 
Tue conclusions drawn in the last chapter receive indirect 
support from other episodes. The story that we may believe 
was told of Morgain and Arthur in Avalon is told of Morgain 
and three other mortals. In none of the versions is there 
uncontaminated early material, and in fact none of them in 
and for itself is particularly valuable. They afford an excel- 
lent illustration of the transformations that rationalism effected 
even when employed on material so remote from real life 
in its setting as that which is contained in the early Celtic 
fairy-mistress tales. In probably the latest version, that of 
Alisander l Orphelin, the theme is plainly not derived from any 
of the extant sources, but in many of its features it stands 
nearer than they to our hypothetical original. In the Batazlle 
Loquifer, the earliest chronologically, Morgain herself is more 
clearly pure fay than in any of the other developments. Here 
she is the love of Renoart, a warrior who figures in the epic 
cycle of Guillaume d’ Orange; but in this case the epic mate- 
rial comes justly by its Breton coloring. The author of the 
Bataille Loquifer, Jendeus de Brie, there is good reason to 
believe lived in Sicily where, as Zimmer and Graf! have 
shown, there is a probability that Norman influences had by 
the early part of the twelfth century diffused Breton story. 
The hero Renoart has lost his son Maillefer. Exhausted with weeping, 
he sleeps by the sea. There come flying toward him three fays, who con- 
gratulate themselves on finding so hardy a warrior, and plan to carry him 
off to Avalon, where he shall dwell in happiness all his days with Arthur

50 Morgain's Retention of Renoart, 
and other heroes. One fay declares that because of Renoart’s prowess she 
intends to preempt him for her am, one of her companions, piqued, 
resolves to dohim harm. They lift the sleeping Renoart, ask God’s bless- 
ing, change his club and his hauberk into birds, his helmet into a harper, 
and his sword into a lad; then they bear Renoart himself away to Avalon 
par grant enchantoison. Here we learn that the three fays are Morgain, 
her sister Marrion,! and an attendant. Fays come forth from Avalon in a 
procession to meet the hero, and sing with marvellous sweetness. When 
Renoart hears the noise, he wakes from his sleep, seizes his club, calls upon 
the Virgin, and succeeds in alarming the fays. Arthur greets him, and 
points out to him first the heroes who have come from this world to 
Avalon : — 
Et cele bele au vis enluminé 
Icele est Morgue ou tant a de biauté.2 
Her beauty at once arouses Renoart’s passion, and he craves her love,’ but 
after a few days of delight with her, he is eager to go in search of Maillefer. 
Instantly Morgain’s anger is stirred by this slight put upon her love. In 
revenge she induces Kapalu, a youth in whose convoy Renoart leaves Ava- 
lon, to sink the vessel in which Renoart sails; but the hero is rescued from 
a watery grave by sirens who lull him to sleep and carry him ashore. When 
he awakes he remembers his wife Aalis, and repents of his escapades in 
Avalon. 
Morgain here is purely an other-world fay, gifted with a primi- 
tive magic power, amorous, supreme, brooking no rival. She 
loves the hero for his valor. She transports him in a sleep by 
enchantment to Avalon. He yields at once to her beauty and 
forgets home and its ties while he is under her spell. When 
he wishes to leave her, her anger is roused and she resolves on 
his destruction. When Renoart gives up all thought of her, 
he remembers his wife. Finally, this is clearly an episode in 
which there are combined many essentials of the Cuchulinn and 
Fand story, and also the rancorous nature of the Morrigan, 
all attached to Morgain’s name. In one other early source, 
namely in Adiscans, Renoart winds up a jingling list of his 
brethren with Morgans li faés : — 
1T find no trace of this fay elsewhere, unless she is to be connected with Mor- 
gain’s sister Moronoe in the Vita Merlini; see p. 44, note 2. 
2 Michel (Za chanson de Roland, Paris, 1837, p. 209) cites the above passage 
after another manuscript, the date of which he does not give, which speaks of 
Morgain as Arthur’s sister. 
8 Morgain afterward bears a child to Renoart, Corbon, ux vif diable, qui ne fist 
se mal non. With this fea:ure of the story cf. pp. 61, 77.

Et Clariaus, et Quarriaus, et Outrés, 
Et Malatrous, et Malars, et Maurés, 
Et Miraidiaus, et Morgans li faés, 
Ki plus est noirs ke aremens triblés.t 
We have not sufficient ground for asserting what is the real 
significance of the passage; it may be simply the result of a 
confusion of names that turns a fairy love of Renoart into a man, 
his brother.2. So far as we know, there is no inherent cause 
for the connection between Renoart and Morgain. The most 
palpable reason for it is that a narrator, desiring to extend 
Renoart’s history by making it include a sojourn in Avalon 
where Arthur and other famous heroes dwell, applied to him 
the love theme already connected with Morgain, the mistress 
of Avalon. It is only fair to the mediaeval story-tellers to 
remember that, though they had but little originality, they 
doubtless had preferences even as we, and that if a narrator 
wished to expand his material he probably would turn first to 
some story that struck his fancy as a pretty or a thrilling bit 
to fasten to his hero. Probably the attaching of this episode 
to Renoart’s name is due mainly to the individual taste of some 
combiner. 
I 
LANCELOT 
If we turn now to a later source, the prose Lancelot, we find 
the same theme related of the hero there.® 
Lancelot lies sleeping beneath an apple-tree. The queen of Sorestan, 
Morgain la fée, and Sebile /enchanteresse come riding past in state. Mor- 
gain, though she is not attended with so much pomp as the queen of 
Sorestan, is apparently the leading spirit of the trio. Their eyes are keen 
enough to espy the sleeping knight, and when they detect his beauty, each 
desires him for her love, and disputes her chances with the others. At 
Morgain’s suggestion they cast him into an enchanted sleep, and have him

(ca. 1180) ; see also Gautier, Zp. 7r., IV, 468, note 1. 
2 It seems more probable, however, that by some confusion Renoart’s “ cousin,” 
Margot de Bocident, is really referred to here. See the variants for Margot cited 
in Rolin’s Aliscans (Leipzig, 1894), v. 4716, Morgaus, Morgans.

  52 Morgain’s Retention of Renoart, 
carried on a litter to the Chateau de la Charrette which belongs to the queen 
of Sorestan (in Madory, to Morgain). There they confine him in a strong 
and beautiful chamber, where he wakes from the spell. In the morning 
they bid him choose one of them for his love, or remain a prisoner. Lancelot 
without embarrassment or gallantry declines to obey. In a rage they leave 
him. He makes his escape through the agency of a damsel of the castle. 
It requires but little analysis to show that this incident and 
that of the Bataille Loguifer are developments of a common 
theme. Renoart and Lancelot both sleep,! spent with grief 
and toil. The fays come flying toward Renoart, riding past 
Lancelot. They are three in number, except in Ma/ory, where 
four are mentioned, Morgain, the queen of Northgalys, the 
queen of Eastland, and the queen of Oute Isles.? The fays

rally, the apple-tree. See Child, Ballads, I, 340, 350; IV, 456; Paris, R. 7. R., 
III, 326; Kittredge, Amer. Journ. of Phil., VII (1886), 190. i 
2 Two of Morgain’s companions in this adventure deserve a passing notice. The 
French sources for thé episode say that Morgain, Sebile, and the queen of Sorestan 
are the three women, who, with the exception of the Dame du Lac, knew more 
about enchantment than all others in the world, and therefore they loved each 
other and rode all day in company. As a matter of fact, a more distinguished 
trio in the romances is formed by Morgain, Sebile l’enchanteresse, and the Reine 
de Norgalles. The most elaborate episode in which all three play a part is in 
Prophecies, p.xcv. The Dame d’Avalon has been presented with three enchanted” 
rings, and tests their virtue upon Sebile l’enchanteresse and the Reine de Nor- 
galles. Despite their best endeavors, they are outdone by the rings, and the 
Dame d’Avalon affably says that if she can enchant these ladies, she certainly can 
enchant Morgain. When Morgain arrives she proves herself a more troublesome 
subject than the others, but eventually succumbs to the power of the rings. A 
joyful meeting takes place between the four choice spirits, and if the Dame du Lac 
had been present, the narrator adds, all the subtlety of the world would have been 
represented there. The gifted ladies start off in search of Merlin. The interest 
of the incident lies in its differentiating Morgain and the Dame d’Avalon, and in 
its showing Morgain as superior to the other fays. 
A Reine de Norgalles, perhaps not the fay, is mentioned in the romances; 
see e.g. Léseth, pp. 189, 269, § 631 a, pp. 483, 491; Aalory, Bk. XXI, ch. 6; for the 
fay see pp. 36, note 6, 58,99. We have not enough information about her to guess 
at her origin, but may note that Annowre is a sorceress of Norgalles (see p. 21). 
Sebile has no individual history in the romances that we can trace. She is 
named among the fays gui tienent grant contrei at the cradle of Brunehaut, the 
daughter of Judas Macabé in Awderon, v. 405; but as a rule she is merely a 
shadow of Morgain. See Léseth, pp. 189, 217, 483, 490, 491; Esclarmonde, v. 3209; 
below, pp. 58, 226, note, 253. There is little question that she is descended from 
the Sibyl. Antoine de la Sale in Za Salade (Bk. IV, ed. Séderhjelm, Antoine de 
a Sale et la Légende de Tannhduser, in Mém. de la Soc. néo-phil. & Helsingfors, 
II) repeats a popular legend that he had learned in a visit to the Mont de la 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
Lancelot, and Alisander l Orphelin 53 
love Renoart for his valor, Lancelot for his beauty. Morgain 
claims Renoart’s love, and thus piques her sister; the fays 
contend for Lancelot’s love. Both mortals are taken in an 
enchanted sleep to the fay’s dwelling. The refusal of her love 
in both cases arouses her rage. 
In the prose romance the other-world situation has become 
thoroughly sophisticated. The fays are queens of great estate ; 
a silken canopy carried by four knights protects the queen of 
Sorestan from the sun; Lancelot is transported in a magic 
Sibylle, one of the peaks of the Apennines near Norcia. In this mountain there is a 
cave, in which he who entered had to encounter a mighty blast of wind, cross a bridge 
one foot wide that spanned a brawling torrent and was guarded at one end by two 
dragons, and also pass through two metal doors that swung back and forth 
unceasingly, before he came to a large crystal door which led into a beautiful 
castle. Here the queen Sibylle dwelt, presiding over a true fairyland of per- 
petual youth, riches, and pleasure, where food to each man’s taste was provided 
for him, and where heat, cold, and the flight of time were unknown. A knight 
from Germany was admitted within the crystal door, and entered upon a life of 
other-world delight. But he discovered that every Friday at midnight the queen 
and her maidens were transformed into serpents, and after nearly a year, coming 
to the conclusion that he was in the power of the devil, he departed for Rome to 
seek pardon from the Pope. The Holy Father, to make an example of him, drove 
him from his presence, but resolved to grant him absolution later. In despair 
the penitent went back to da reine Sibylle, and has never been heard of again. 
The legend is of course familiar from the story of Tannhiuser, but stands in 
La Salade a little nearer the true Celtic form, in that the knight returns to fairy- 
land forever. Thus, although the Holy Father’s reputation is saved by his inten- 
tion to pardon the repentant sinner, the story itself adheres to the original type. 
The connection between the Sibyl and the queen Sibylle is shown more clearly 
by Andrea da Barberino, who in Guerino il Meschino (see ed. of Venice, 1816, IV, 
cap. 134; V) tells substantially the same story, evidently derived from a common 
source with the legend reported by Antoine de la Sale. In Guerino the fay is 
Alcina /a ncantatrice, but she is identified in conception and description with the 
Cumean Sibyl (see IV, cap. 134; V, cap. 149), and Guerino seeks her, even dwells 
with her, solely for the purpose of gaining hidden knowledge, and of discovering 
from her the story of his own parentage. She refuses to give him the coveted infor- 
mation, and after a year he leaves her. The Pope grants him pardon for his sin. 
The two sources supplement each other, Antoine’s representing purer Celtic 
material, Andrea’s preserving more distinctly the Sibylline character of the fay, 
which would never suggest itself to us from Antoine’s account, were it not for the 
queen’sname. Both sources show tendencies that are often displayed in mediaeval 
fairy lore — the scanty precision of legend when it deals with supernatural beings, 
and the merging of Celtic and classical tradition in popular story (cf. pp. 235 ff., 
275 ff.). For discussions of the legend of the Mont de la Sibylle, see Paris, Revue 
de Paris, VI (1897), 763 ff.; Reumont, Del Monte di Venere (Discorso letto alla 
Soc. Colombaria fiorentina il di 25 maggio 1871); Neilson, Studies and Notes, 
VI, 133-135.

  54 Morgain’'s Retention of Renoart, 
sleep, it is true, but by prosaic means, to his prison. The 
dwelling is not even said to be across a stream,! and Avalon 
has become a simple castle of this world. The fays do not 
know who the hero is, and Morgain fails to recognize him — 
farewell to romance — for ce guw’il ot esté touzés (tondu) novel- 
ment.* The fairy retention has become a serious imprison- 
ment behind iron bars; the hero’s escape can no longer be 
accomplished by the permission of the fay coupled with an 
injunction, but the figure of the releasing maiden common in 
the epic who rescues the hero from Saracen captors is intro- 
duced into the poem as a deus ex machina. 
A working out of the same theme with a still greater corrup- 
tion of the early features appears in that part of the prose 
Lancelot which is called the Livre d’ Agravain? 
Morgain sends out twelve maidens in search of Lancelot, one of whom 
by the promise of an adventure entices him to Morgain’s castle. Herea 
magic potion puts him to sleep, a magic powder which Morgain blows into 
his nostrils keeps him in ignorance of his whereabouts. Morgain loves 
him for his beauty, and keeps him prisoner, hoping to win his love (vecntre 
le cuidoit par ennuz). But he refuses all her entreaties, and in the spring 
by the sight of a rose is filled with such longing for the queen that he 
breaks the bars of his prison and escapes,* leaving for his would-be love the 
message that Lancelot du Lac greets the most disloyal woman in the world. 
It was doubtless late when the theme that we are examining 
here was attached to Lancelot. There is no: trace in early 
material of Morgain’s love for him, and never the slightest 
indication that he was sensible to her charms; usually her 
schemes against him are the outcome of her already deeply 
rooted hostility toward the queen. For this there was in the 
early story the same cause that existed for the contest between 
Fand and Emer, and when we study the episode of Morgain 
and Guiomar, we shall see what excellent reason there is to 
believe that it has a place in comparatively early Morgain 
material. As soon as it became impossible by tradition for 
Morgain to entice the queen’s husband from her, she naturally 
would be represented as endeavoring to entice the queen’s 
devoted lover from her. In other words, the elements of the

early story are kept, though disguised, and the hero is changed. 
Properly Morgain’s relations to Guinevere have produced this 
essentially late development which reverts to the original story.

ALISANDER L’ORPHELIN 
We learn the history of Alisander l’Orphelin through four 
sources :—a manuscript of the prose Jystan,1 the Suite de 
Palaméde, the Prophécies de Merlin,? and Malory  Alisander 
is a fearless young hero of Cornwall; who “hadde neuer grace 
ne fortune to come to Kynge Arthurs court.” 5 Morgain plays 
an important part in his career, which in general outline 
belongs to the same type as that of Tyolet, Meriadeuc, Bel 
Inconnu, and Perceval.6 The versions are substantially alike in 
the parts recounting his experiences with her : — 
It chances that a maiden tells Morgain of Alisander’s valor and beauty, 
and assures her that if she can win control over him, she may count herself

5 Malory, Bk. X, ch. 40. 
6 The following summary gives the outline of Alisander’s career : — 
King Mark of Cornwall, actuated by jealousy, secretly murders his brother. 
The widow, Anglediz, taking her infant son, Alisander, whom Mark believes 
dead, flees from the Cornish court to a castle held for her by a faithful chaste- 
lain. Here she brings up the boy in retirement and in complete ignorance of the 
circumstances of his father’s death. On the day when the lad is knighted, she 
shows him his father’s blood-stained garments, and tells him the history of the 
murder. Alisander at once sets out for Logres to put himself under the tutelage 
of Lancelot, and thus prepare for taking vengeance upon King Mark. He passes 
through a variety of typical adventures, the most important of which is that with 
Morgain (see the summary given below). While he is defending the site of Bele 
Garde, Aylies la Belle Pelerine hears of the adventure that he offers, and vows to 
give her hand to his conqueror. Since Alisander is invincible and she is beautiful, 
the matter ends by their marrying each other. After the required term for his 
defence of the site of Bele Garde is completed, according to Léseth’s summary, 
Alisander is about to prosecute his plans against King Mark, when he is killed by 
Helyas le Roux; according to Malory, he is treacherously murdered by Mark, and 
his death is avenged by his son, Bellengere le Beuse. 
Variations in the sources, and vague references in the Pa/améde to adventures

happy. Mark, who is Alisander’s enemy, in the meanwhile hears of his 
prowess, and resolves that he must die. He asks Morgain’s aid against 
him, but although she promises the king her assistance, she determines to- 
get Alisander into her own power. She wastes no time, and sets forth at 
once to a castle not far distant where she has heard that he has been victor 
at atourney. The maiden of the castle is detaining him with her, that he 
may take the field against Malagrin (in J/a/ory, Malgrin) le felon, an 
unwelcome suitor, and the reward of his victory is to be her hand. Morgain 
resolves to prevent the marriage. 
She reaches the castle in time to watch a fearful battle between Alisander - 
and Malagrin, which ends for Malagrin with the loss of his head and for 
Alisander with sixteen great wounds. Morgain sees her chance, and offers 
to heal Alisander’s wounds. When she bandages them she applies an irri- 
tating salve, which causes him a night of such torture that in the morning, 
chastened by suffering, he gladly promises to do all her will provided she 
will heal him. Instantly she applies a healing ointment that puts him out 
of pain. In the course of his recovery she forbids him to wed the maiden, 
and Alisander accordingly bestows her in marriage upon another knight. 
During the wedding festivities Morgain leads Alisander apart and bids him 
come to a pavilion of hers, where he will be free from the noise and mirth 
lengthy independent narrative, and was sufficiently popular to be embodied in a 
variety of versions. Indications abound that Alisander’s history is modelled on 
the Perceval type, notably the following parallels :— (a) The death of Alisander’s 
father, the flight of his mother, and his own upbringing. Cf. Léseth, §§ 302, 308, 
312, 313; Sir Perceval of Galles, ed. Halliwell, The Thornton Romances, London,

know through Léseth, §§ 302, 308, 312, 313; see also Schofield, Studies and 
Notes, 1V, 183 ff. (b) The faithful chastelain who aids Alisander’s mother. Cf. Per-

der’s mother speaks of him. Cf. Bel fil, Beau Valet, the names by which the 
heroes of the Perceval type of story are called; cf. also the name Riche Orfelin 
given to Lancelot in the abode of the Dame du Lac (Paris, R. 7. X., III, 27; see 
below, p. 186). (d) Alisander’s appearance before Palamedes, who when he hears 
of the young hero’s valor summons him to his dwelling. Cf. the déu¢t of the 
unknown youth before Arthur in the earlier versions; see especially Be/ Inconnu,

Perceval, v. 2169. Note especially Alisander’s refusal to reveal his name, his 
betrayal of his life of seclusion by ay admission that he has never seen Tristan, 
his peculiarities of bearing for which his Cornish origin is said to account. Cf. the 
inability of the heroes in the above sources to tell their names, also their lack of 
the conventional graces, for which their forest rearing is usually held responsible.

of the castle. She takes him to a litter before the door, gives him a draught 
of drugged wine, and within three days brings him safely to Bele Garde 
(in Malory, La Beale Regard), a former castle of her mother’s. Here she 
completes his cure, but he grumbles at his confinement. One of Morgain’s 
maidens promises for his love to betray the castle by night to her uncle who 
will destroy it by fire; thus Alisander shall be freed. Alisander vows that 
if she will carry out her purpose he will defend the site for two years. The 
maiden is as good as her word; Alisander is released, and proceeds with 
his defence of the site of Bele Garde. The maiden sends word to Morgain 
of the destruction of the castle, and Morgain disappears from the story 
enraged at the tidings of her loss. 
The story of Alisander is instructive here not because of its 
inherent interest, but because of three points that it serves to 
illustrate. In the first place, it points to that stage in the 
Morgain saga, of which we have seen indications in Chapter 
III; in the second place, it shows distinctly the perversions of 
an early theme in late hands; and in the third place, it is an 
aid in explaining the variations of Morgain’s character in the 
romances. Let us see what her part in Alisander’s life is. 
Her desire to bring the young knight to her castle is stirred by 
hearing of his beauty and valor. She sends out her messengers 
in search of him, and to “make assurance double sure,” she 
herself mounts her palfrey and rides out in his path. She 
exerts her power over Alisander by her promises of healing and 
rest. She interferes with his love for the mortal maiden who 
should rightfully have been his bride. She keeps him in het 
castle in a confinement which he finds irksome and desires to 
leave for his accustomed life. In other words, Morgain’s part 
here on analysis shows the same features that we have seen 
doubtless appeared originally in the Arthur-Avalon episode. 
Once again the medicamen that we first met in the Vita Merlini 
in the zxsula pomorum is found in Morgain’s hands. This is 
still another repetition of the story of Fand and Cuchulinn. 
Here, however, we have to do with sadly rationalized mate- 
rial. Morgain’s promises of healing concern literal cuts and 
gashes. She does not send a fairy debility upon the knight 
that leads him to realize her power, but she irritates his 
wounds with a baneful salve, and then holds out promises of 
relief.1_ There is no benumbing of his senses by the intangible

58 Morgain’s Retention of Renoart, 
influences of the other world, but a draught of drugged wine puts 
Alisander to sleep. Morgain conveys him to her castle, not by 
a fairy boat, but an ordinary litter. She herself is an enchant- 
ress with much of her other-world brilliancy obscured by the 
appliances of this world. When her maiden tells her of the 
gallant young Cornish knight, she excuses herself to the Queen 
of Norgales and Sebile l’enchanteresse, who are waiting to talk 
with her, leaves her castle and all her possessions at their dis- 
posal for a month, and rides off in search of Alisander. She 
receives a letter from King Mark asking her to help him in 
his plot against Alisander, and at once sends a polite message 
to the king assuring him that she will aid and abet him. She 
rests in her pavilion by the way, entertains passing knights at 
supper, and extracts from them the information about Alisander 
that she desires. Her part has been subjected to prosaic influ- 
ences; but her 7é/e here confirms the probability that the 
Cuchulinn-Fand story was at one time told of her, and that 
her name was connected with it before it was developed into 
the two types discussed above in Chapters II and III. 
But why is this story, which is a true Morgain episode, 
attached to the name of Alisander? Properly, after defeating 
Malagrin the young knight should wed the lady and live as her 
defender. Alisander, however, does not maintain a “ custom” 
at her castle, but appoints himself the voluntary defender of 
the site of Bele Garde for two years after it has been destroyed. 
This extraordinary proceeding on his part is evidently a work- 
ing out of the theme which has been interrupted by the episode 
with Morgaih. The situation in the story offered by her 
advent is similar to that in Rigomer Gawain after having 
destroyed the enchantment of the castle Rigomer, and released 
its mistress, Dionise, is called upon to wed her. His fairy love, 
Lorie, appears with a stupendous suite, and throws a wet blanket 
on the hopes of Dionise by claiming Gawain as her own prop- 
erty. He appeases Dionise by promising to find her a worthy 
husband in the course of a year. The story of Alisander is 
based in the main on a line of incidents unconnected with the 
Morgain saga. The narrator undoubtedly introduced the epi- 
sode with Morgain into his history not merely because it would

-P-A-G-E-71
  Lancelot, and Alisander l Orphelin 59 
redound to Alisander’s glory to be beloved by the greatest of 
fays, but because when he had made his hero receive sixteen 
dire wounds in battle, the famous story of Morgain’s fairy 
healing supplied him admirably with additional material. 
The Alisander story throws light upon apparent variations 
in Morgain’s character. RhYs+ makes a distinction which can- 
not be proved to exist. The romances, he says, “spoke of a 
lake lady Morgain, Morgan, or Morgue. The character varied : 
Morgain le Fay was a designing and wicked person ; but Mor- 
gan was also the name of a well-disposed lady of the same fairy 
kind, who took Arthur away to be healed at her home in the 
Isle of Avallon.” The fay who takes Arthur away to be healed 
in Avalon is the same fay who forms designs against Alisander. 
The story that we are examining in both cases, when told of 
Fand, does not show those attributes in the fay’s nature that 
are prominent in Morgain. The Morrigan’s character is to be 
detected in Morgain in the early material which lies behind the 
episode of Arthur in Avalon as we know it, and the same is 
true of those elements in Morgain in the later sources that 
allow us to characterize her as cruel and designing; for the 
nature of the war-goddess was slow to die even when its repre- 
sentative had been by tradition most nearly merged into the 
proud, unscrupulous lady of a mediaeval castle.

CHAPTER V 
MORGAIN AND GUIOMAR! 
Wits the original situation outlined in the preceding chapters 
before us, Morgain’s relations to Guinevere acquire a special 
significance. If Emer’s interference with Fand’s love is repro- 
duced in the history of Guinevere and Morgain, it will be so 
much the more evident that there was a story told of Arthur 
in faérie which was parallel to that of Cuchulinn’s experiences 
in Mag Mell. 
It is certainly true that if Morgain is hostile to Arthur, still 
more so, if possible, is she to the queen. 
La roine...ne l’amoit mie moult, pour chou que elle n’avoit onques

et si grant blasme dont on parla puis tous les jours de sa vie. che fu de la

por quoi.8 
There is no episode in the romances in which Morgain 
appears on friendly terms with the queen, except that discussed 
in this chapter, at the beginning of which she is represented as 
a lady in waiting on Guinevere. The stories in which her hos- 
tility is most in evidence are those of her love for Guiomar, of 
the Cor enchanté and the Manteau mal taillé, and of her designs 
upon Lancelot. Her hatred is attributed to the queen’s inter- 
ference with her early love for Guiomar, to her jealousy of 
Lancelot’s love for the queen, and to the affront that she 
received from the queen, who omitted her from the guests 
invited to a feast at court. She manifests her hatred according

to the Livre d’Artus, P. by creating the Val sanz Retor; 
according to other sources by employing various devices to 
shake Lancelot’s love for the queen, and by making untiring 
efforts to betray it to the king.? 
Among the episodes that bring Morgain into connection with 
the queen, there is one that follows in natural sequence those 
that we have just been studying. This is the tale of Morgain’s 
love for the gallant young knight, Guiomar. There came to 
Erec’s wedding feast, Chrétien tells us, together with many 
other noble counts and lords, Guigomar,? 
De I'Isle d’Avalon fu sire. 
De cestui avons oi dire 
Quw’il fu amis Morgain la fee, 
Et ce fu veritez provee.* 
But we do not meet an episode bringing Morgain and Guiomar 
together before the Lamce/oz,* and here we have a full account 
of the course of love between them. 
Morgain is Arthur’s half-sister, lady in waiting upon Guinevere. She 
cherishes a secret passion for Guiamor de Camelide, a fair and valiant 
knight, the nephew of Arthur. One day they have a quarrel, and thus 
attract the queen’s attention. She succeeds in surprising them together, 
and wishing to turn Morgain from folly, and to avert shame from the lovers 
and from Arthur, she warns Guiamor that his life is in danger, if Arthur 
learns of his love for Morgain. He readily renounces the maiden, but she, 
seeing that he has deserted her for love of the queen, is greatly distressed. 
Knowing that Merlin can aid her, she goes in search of him, and since he 
loves her, he teaches her many enchantments. By Guiamor Morgain has a 
son who becomes a knight of great prowess. Thus begins Morgain’s hatred 
of the queen. 
Paris in his summary omits two details, —the name of the 
lover who is simply said to be a cousin of the queen, and the 
mention of Morgain’s child.

62 Morgain and Guiomar 
A different version is found in four other sources, the Vu/- 
gate Merlin, the English Merlin,? the summary of Le Rot Artus 
by Paris,’ and the Livre d’Artus, P.* 
A brilliant assembly is being held at Arthur’s court. The guests separate 
and go to rest, but Guiomar, the queen’s nephew, lingers behind the others 
with Morgain, Arthur’s beautiful sister, who is sitting at her embroidery. 
Guiomar talks with the maiden on many themes as he winds her thread of 
gold ; soon he sues for her love, and easily induces her to smile upon him, 
and in the end to grant him all his will. For a long time their relations are 
undiscovered, but at length the queen learns the true state of affairs, and 
separates them. Morgain, therefore, hates her, and works her harm. 
In the Livre d’Artus, P., this part of the story is given in a 
condensed form, but a continuation is added : 
Morgain has recourse in her trouble to Merlin, who loves her and 
teaches her his art completely. With the skill derived from him she 
founds the Val sanz Retor as a means of revenge upon the queen, and for 
the sake of having Guiomar in her power. After her departure from court 
Arthur seeks her everywhere. Guinevere extracts from Guiomar an oath 
that he knows nothing of her whereabouts. He, however, is eager for 
further tidings of her. 
A comparison of the versions shows three noteworthy differ- 
ences among them: — 
1. In the Lancelot there are three significant variations from 
the other sources : — 
(a) Morgain is not beautiful. 
(4) It is implied that Guiomar loves the queen, although 
this is not the reason given for her separation of the lovers. 
(c) Morgain and Guiomar have a son. 
2. The Vulgate Merlin and the Rot Artus differ from the 
Lancelot in three important particulars: — 
(a) They contain an introduction, i.e., the embroidery scene. 
(4) They contain a lengthy description of Morgain’s per- 
sonal characteristics. 
(c) They do not contain the sequel, Morgain’s flight to 
Merlin. 
3. The Livre d’Artus, P. differs from the other versions in 
the mention of Morgain’s founding of the Val sanz Retor as 
the result of her anger and love.

Morgain and Guiomar 63. 
The differences between the Lamce/ot and the versions repre- 
sented by the Vulgate Merlin, and also their agreement in the 
outline of the story, point to the use of common material 
coming perhaps through more than one intermediary, rather 
than to interdependence. The same relation of the Lancelot 
to the versions of the other class is indicated here that will be 
seen more clearly below in the episode of Merlin and Niniane.! 
There an introduction containing a long account of an exhibi- 
tion of magic power given by Merlin before Niniane is an 
evident addition to the main story, which the author obviously 
was deriving in large part from the same source as that of the 
Lancelot. So here in the Lancelot, Morgain is said to be /aide, 
also chaude et luxurieuse; the Vulgate Merlin reads: moult 
estott brune di vis . . . chaude et luxurieuse ; but her beauties 
and accomplishments receive an amplification a page long? 
We have no direct source for this passage, which contains 
the most complete description of Morgain that has come 
down to us. The author of a mediaeval romance was lavish 
in detail when he seriously set out to describe his heroine’s 
charms,® and although this description mentions traditional 
traits of Morgain and is not so purely conventional that it 
has no value in the Morgain material, its presence here may 
be attributed to the writer’s personal bent and not to his 
source. The embroidery scene also may be regarded as a 
narrative flourish on his part, for which we need not insist 
that he necessarily resorted to a definite written or narrated 
source. 
Leaving then, for the present, the features which are evi- 
‘ dently not integral parts of the theme, we see that in its 
essentials, particularly as they are given in the Lancelot, the 
story is that of the secret love between the fay and a young 
knight, with which the queen interferes. The knight deserts 
~ the fay through the queen’s influence, towards whom in conse- 
quence the fay cherishes an abiding hatred.

64 Morgain and Guiomar 
Shall we regard this story of Morgain’s first love as a work- 
ing-over of some early other-world adventure in which Guws- 
gomar, sire a’ Avalon,| whom the Evec mentions, figured as 
Morgain’s ami? Before examining other sources, we may 
recall certain features of the early story of Arthur in fairyland 
that were developed in the last chapter. In the Cuchulinn- 
Fand episode, which we saw was transferred to Arthur and a 
fay who in all probability was Morgain, there are contained 
the same elements that reappear in the account of Guiomar 
and Morgain. The fay loves the knight, the queen breaks in 
upon an assignation of the lovers, she demands their separation 
and her entreaties move the hero to compliance, the fay in indig- 
nation leaves them. In other words, essentially the same story 
was attached, not only to Arthur and Morgain, but also to Gui- 
omar and Morgain, of whom it was told at some time anterior to 
1168, about which date Chrétien probably wrote his Zrec.? 
There is scarcely room for doubt that Morgain la fée, the 
love of Guigomar, was identified in Chrétien’s mind with 
Morgue, the sister of Arthur, whom he mentions in another 
passage in the Zvec.3 Ferdinand Lot questions such an iden- 
tification on Chrétien’s part. “C’est ce qu’on ne peut affirmer 
et il parait impossible d’établir avec certitude a quelle source 
il a puisé.”* Chrétien knows Morgue as the concocter of all- 
potent balms, and speaks of her as Morgue, the sister of 
Arthur, and also as Morgue la sage. 
[Li rois] fet aporter un antret 
Que Morgue sa suer avoit fet.5 
Car d’un oignement me sovient 
Que me dona Morgue la sage.® 
He certainly is referring to the same being in these two pas- 
sages, and inasmuch as in the Huon de Bordeaux’ and the Jus 
Adan * unquestionably the fay, and nobody else, is designated 
as Morgue la sage, there is ground for believing that Chrétien 
means one and the same personage, when he speaks of Morgain

Morgain and Guiomar 65 
la fée, Morgue la sage and Morgue, the sister of Arthur. His 
words, then, show that before 1168 approximately Morgain 
was known as Arthur’s sister, and that the original love 
adventure therefore could no longer be related of them. If 
the story was to be told of Morgain, the hero had to be 
changed. As soon as it is clear that the episode of Morgain 
and Guiomar is simply the original episode of Morgain and 
Arthur with a new hero, we understand why the sources 
say that it relates the beginning of the fay’s hostility toward 
the queen. The hint in the Lancelot, which otherwise seems 
strange, that Guiomar left Morgain for love of the queen, is 
also explained, as well as Guiomar’s future ignorance of Mor- 
gain’s fate. 
Further evidence that this substitution may have taken place 
is afforded in the lay of Guigemar by Marie de France,! in 
which the name of the hero resembles Guzomar sufficiently ? to 
leave us no ground for surprise that the same story should be 
attached to each. The lay is a composite production, which, in 
spite of the seemingly incongruous elements that it contains, 
throws a more abiding glamor about the hero than the story 
of the prose romances bestows on Guiomar. 
Guigemar, son of Oridial, lord of Liiin, is in the service of King Hoilas 
of Bretagne. He shows himself valiant in war, knightly in temper, and 
wins universal affection. 
He is beloved by women, but to the distress of his friends cares for none 
of them. One day in the course of a stag-hunt, as he chances to linger 
behind the rest of the company, he espies a doe with her fawn in a thicket 
near by and draws his bow against her. The dart wounds her, but instantly 
rebounds and wounds him in turn. The doe cries out that he has killed 
her. 
E tu, vassal, ki m’as nafree, 
tels seit la tue destinee : 
ja mais n’aies tu medecine ! 
Ne par herbe ne par racine,

2 For the view that Guigemar and Guigomar (Guyomar) are the same name see 
Zimmer, Zs. f. fr. Sp., XIII (1891), 9, 11 : —“‘ Diesem bretonischen Guihomar des 
XII Jahrhunderts entspricht offenbar das franzésiche Guigomar (woraus Guiga- 
mor, Guingamor), Guigemar ...  Urspriingliche Form des Namens war ohne 
Zweifel Guigomar, Guigemar ; es ist heutiges Guyomar.” Guiomar’s name sur- 
vives to-day among the saints of Brittany, and a parish of Morbihan is named after 
him, Saint Guyomard. For his story see Sébillot, Petite Légende Dorée, p. 188.

Guigemar determines without delay to seek the land where he shall find 
healing. He rides through the forest till he comes in sight of the sea, 
where he espies a beautiful ship anchored in a harbor. He goes aboard and 
discovers that he has no companions on the vessel. The ship, without a 
pilot, leaves the shore and bears Guigemar swiftly out on the high sea to the 
port where his wound is destined to be healed. The lord of the city is an 
old man who is jealous of his young wife’s beauty, and has confined her in 
a tower surrounded by a high wall except on the side toward the sea. To 
her tower Guigemar’s ship carries him. When the lady hears his story she 
offers him her hospitality until he shall be healed, and at once proceeds to 
tend his bleeding wound. Love grows apace between them, and the result 
is that for a year and a half Guigemar dwells in secrecy with her. One 
unhappy day her husband surprises them together, and forthwith orders 
Guigemar to put out to sea in the magic vessel. The ship takes him safely 
to his native land, and afterwards when at last the fair lady is able to 
escape from her tower, she finds the same magic vessel waiting in the har- 
bor to bear her to Bretagne. Here she and her lover by means of other 
adventures are reunited. 
These adventures are quite irrelevant to our purpose here ; 
it is with the induction and Guigemar’s stay with his love that 
we are concerned. The former belongs to the same class as 
those of which we have already had examples, in which the 
fay by means of a fairy messenger and boat transfers the hero 
to the place where she desires his presence. The resemblance 
between this induction and certain features of the Partonopeus 
has been pointed out,? but a comparison of the lay and the 
romance shows one important difference between the situation 
in Guigemar and in the typical episode of its class.2 The

prophetic doe and the magic bark are attributed to no definite 
source, and the lady, who like Melior should be the motive 
force for all the later incidents, is as ignorant of their meaning 
and is taken as completely unawares by their occurrence as the 
hero himself. By analogy with a familiar class of tales in which 
a maiden, bespelled into the form of an animal by a jealous 
husband or relative, wanders in the woods waiting until the 
destined hero effects her release,| the wounded doe should be 
the fay herself transformed, released from spells by the hero 
whom she eventually rewards with her love.? The variation on 
the original episode, allowing the dart that proves fatal to the 
fay to wound the hero as well, is undoubtedly due to the senti- 
mental psychology of Marie’s time, and afforded an acceptable 
opportunity to the poetess, familiar with the ways of the Anglo- 
Norman court, to dwell on the serious effect of the shaft of 
love. : Mes amurs l’ot feru al vif; 
ja ert sis quers en grant estrif, 
kar la dame I’a si nafré, 
tut a sun pais ublié. 
De sa plaie nul mal ne sent; 
mult suspire anguissusement.® 
The purely mortal dénouement is evidently also the result of 
the rationalizing tendency by which fairy. incidents are fre- 
quently transformed, and which led the author of Marie’s 
original* to add to his other-world material a common theme, 
according to which a young wife imprisoned in a tower by a 
jealous husband was visited by a gallant lover, from whom she 
was rudely separated by her husband.® ;

philosophy, handsome, and rich despises the love of women. Tormented by 
entreaties of friends who beg him to marry, he orders stone-carvers to make for
-P-A-G-E-80
68 Morgain and Guiomar 
The induction brings us back once more to the story of 
Cuchulinn and Fand, for it contains the essentials of the 
earlier Celtic induction—the effort of the hero to wound a 
druidic animal, the other-world messenger and her promise that 
he shall find healing with his love, the fairy boat, — elements 
which we have seen were doubtless repeated in a story that 
was told of Morgain and Arthur. These, features do not 
appear in the story of Morgain and Guiomar, but they belong, 
as I have just said, to a Celtic tale of the same type, and 
have a place in the narrative that is told of Guigemar. Thus 
the histories of Guiomar and Guigemar are complementary to 
each other, and give us reason to assume that they have as a 
common antecedent a story similar to that of Cuchulinn and 
Fand, and of Arthur and Morgain, in which Guiomar was later 
substituted for Arthur. If this be true, it is evident that the 
him the stone image of a beautiful woman, and vows that only she who is the liv- 
ing counterpart of the statue shall be his bride. Some friends tell him of a 
beautiful lady in Greece who meets the conditions, and who is imprisoned by her 
jealous husband in a tower by the sea. The reluctant and sceptical wooer sails to 
the lady’s tower, finds that she is the most beautiful creature in the world, and after 
a brief conversation avows his passion for her. For a long time he visits her 
secretly, and at length succeeds in carrying her off with him to Rome. This story 
is not contained in the Latin work of Johannes de Alta Silva (ed. H. Oesterley, 
Strassburg and London, 1873), of which Herbert’s Do/opathos is a translation with 
amplifications. The harmony, however, between Herbert’s style here and in those 
parts of the poem where he is undoubtedly translating from Johannes de Alta 
Silva has led Paris (Rom., II (1873), 499 ff.) to the conclusion that he was working 
from a later text of the latter than that which has come down to us, and that in 
this text the incident was embodied. The date of the Dolopathos is placed not 
long after that of Johannes de Alta Silva’s own work (1184-1212 ; see Dolopathos, 
pp. xii, xix), and we may therefore feel assured that from whatever source Herbert 
directly derived his eighth story, there was told in France in the latter part of the 
twelfth century a tale that we evidently know through both Marie and Herbert, 
recounting how a noble youth, who despised love, after sailing across the sea found 
imprisoned in a tower by her jealous husband a fair lady, whose love he secretly 
won and long enjoyed. 
Certain resemblances in phraseology, idea, and structure occur in Guigemar 
and kindred parts of the Dolofathos, which, it is true, are not so far from common- 
place that their significance is to be insisted upon; but which are easily explain- 
able as the outgrowth of an ultimate common source. See the following : —

  Morgain and Guiomar 69 
adventure of the induction to the lay is that which properly 
belongs with Guigemar’s name, and is responsible for the 
fact that the remaining themes of the lay are connected with 
him. 
Why, if Arthur’s part in the early story is to be transferred 
to another hero, should the lot fall upon Guiomar? The prose 
romances supply us with no explanation; they contain apart 
from our story only scattered allusions to Guiomar, all of 
which represent him as among the favored and gallant knights 
of Arthur.1 To answer our question we must in the first place 
recall the experiences of the hero, Guingamor, celebrated in 
Breton lays. His name Zimmer? regards as a development of 
Guigomar. The change of the termination -omar to -amor, 
-amuer, Zimmer explains as the result of a confusion between 
-omar and the common Breton termination -mor, -mer, -muer, 
which means great; and the Guin- for Gui- in the first mem- 
ber as developed by analogy with the many Breton names in 
which Guin-, Guen- forms the first syllable. This merely indi- 
cates that the forms Guingamor, Guingamuer are transparent, 
and even if not connected phonologically with Guigomar 
might by popular usage easily arise from it. Let us see if in 
the stories connected with Guingamor we find an identity with 
the history of Guiomar and Morgain. 
The lay that bears the name of Guingamor tells how this valiant young 
knight of Bretagne, who cared naught for love, in the course of a perilous 
boar-hunt met a beguiling fay, who took him away to her beautiful castle 
and banished from his mind all thought of time and the world. After three 
hundred brief years, she let him return to earth on condition that he taste 
no food while there. But his mortal cravings tempted him beyond his 
strength, he disobeyed his fairy mistress, and immediately became a feeble, 
shrivelled old man. She forgave him, however, and sent her messengers 
to bring him back across the water to fairyland. ; 
1 See Paris, X. ZT. R., I, 187, 190, 243, 250; Livre d’Artus, P., p. 13, §§ 30; 47, 
171-175; Vulgate Merlin, p. 252; cf. Arthour and Merlin, vv. 9670, 9713- 
2 Zs. f. fr. Sp., XIII, 7 ff. Zimmer derives the name Guigomar from an old 
Breton name Wiuhomarch. He cites the Annales of Eginhard for mention of a 
Wihomarchus Britonum dux, who in 822/25 was at war with Louis the Pious, 
and also gives documentary evidence that this name existed in Redon as early as 
854/60.

  70 ‘Morgain and Guiomar 
From Gaucher de Dourdan’s continuation of the Perceval 
we learn of another and slightly different version of the story.1 
Here we are told of the death of a certain Brangemuer, king 
of the isles of the sea. 
Guinganmer l’engenra 
En une fée qu’il trova. 
Bien avés oi aconter 
Coment il caga le sangler 
Et com ma dame le retint ; 
Bien avés oi qu'il devint; 
C’est la roine Brangepart.? 
We see from these passages that the story of Guingamor and 
his fairy mistress was a familiar theme at the time of Gaucher, 
and formed undoubtedly the subject of more than one independ- 
ent narrative?; at least two versions of the story must have 
existed, that of the lay of Guingamor and that of the source 
that Gaucher has in mind. Moreover, Sir Gringamore* also 
appears as an other-world character in the seventh book of 
Malory, where as in Evec he is said to dwell in the Isle of 
Avilion,> and is provided with two fairy sisters, Linet and 
Dame Liones. 
Thus there is certain indication that by the time when the 
material of the prose romances was put into shape, there was 
a connection established in story between the name Guzngamor 
and fairyland. This fact in itself offers the solution of which 
we are in search. Zimmer,® who leaves out of consideration 
the Guiomar of the prose romances, as well as Sir Gringa- 
more, says that the same theme is associated with Guingamor 
and Guigemar; Freymond’ advances the view that the Guio- 
mar of the prose romances is identical with the Guingamor of 
the lays, and that the prose versions recounting his experiences

Morgain and Guiomar 71 
with Morgain contain a saga known from several “Breton” 
lays, Guigemar, Guingamor, Graelent, and Lanval. But analysis 
appears to show that although the stories of Guiomar and 
Guigemar may represent two developments of one original, and 
although the heroes may bear the same name, they can be 
classed only in their broad outlines with the story of Guinga- 
mor, and really contain elements that place them in a different 
category among themes dealing with a fairy mistress. The 
names Guingamor and Guigomar (Guiomar), whether they be 
the same in origin or not, are sufficiently alike to be easily 
confused; and when the part of Arthur in the early theme 
had to be attached to another name, the lot could fall to few 
more suitably than to Gwi(g)omar, which closely resembled 
Guingamor, the name of the well-known hero of an other-world 
adventure. Furthermore, elements that are found in stories 
of the Guingamor type would naturally in the course of time 
creep into the story of Guiomar and Morgain, — a condition 
that would not arise if the reverse of the course that I have 
suggested were the case, and the hero of the lay of Guingamor 
were named from Morgain’s lover. Asa matter of fact, most 
of the features in the tale of Morgain and Guiomar that are 
foreign to our supposed original are explained when we see 
that they may have entered the story from the influence of 
the Guingamor type. 
In the Lancelot Guiamor is the nephew of Arthur; Guinga- 
mor is the nephew of the king of Bretagne. In the Lancelot 
also the story runs that Morgain becomes the mother of a child 
by Guiamor; Guingamor and the fay Brangepart have a 
son. Guingamor is denominated by Chrétien sive de l’isle 
Avalon, even as Sir Gringamore is said by Malory to dwell at 
the Isle of Avilion. Gaucher says of Brangemuer, the child 
of Brangepart and Guinganmer, 
Rois fu des illes de la mer; 
En une des illes estoit 
U nus autres hom n’abitoit, 
De cele contrée estoit rois.* 
The isles over which Brangemuer was king were doubtless 
the possessions of the fairy princess, his mother.2 Hither

72 Morgain and Guiomar 
Guingamor had returned from earth, and the natural inference 
is that he, before his son, was thought of as lord of the other- 
world island where his loved one dwelt. Hence Guigomar is 
fittingly made lord of Morgain’s home, Avalon. 
Ferdinand Lot in commenting on the similarity of the 
adventures recounted in the lays of Graelent and Guingamor 
concludes :— “Le lai de Gugemer (par Marie) ne présente 
aucun rapport avec le précédent [Graelent]. Il n’en est 
pas de méme de celui de Guingamor.... Ici encore! la 
‘pucelle’ qui entraine le héros dans un autre monde n’est pas 
nommée, non plus que dans le lai analogue de Lanval, od 
apparait cependant Avalon.... N’est-ce pas singulier, cet 
anonymat constant de la fée, et ne peut-on pas soupgonner Chré- 
tien de l’avoir dénommée de sa propre autorité?”? « Remar- 
quons, a l’appui de notre opinion, que dans la suite du Perceval, 
par Gaucher de Dourdan, v. 21,873, le nom de l’amie de Guin- 
gamor n’est pas Morgain mais ‘la roine Brangepart.’’’® But if 
we have not gone astray in analyzing the material, we can 
understand why Guzgemar should have no distinct connection 
in story with the cycle to which Guzngamor belongs, and also 
that there is no reason to suspect Chrétien of having named 
the love of Guigomar on his own authority. Back of his 
passing allusion to Guigomar there must have lain a more 
elaborate story that had already passed through more than one 
stage in its growth. 
The course of development that the story doubtless had may 
be briefly traced. A fairy-mistress theme was attached by a 
narrator to the name Guingamor and won popularity. When 
the time was ripe to transfer to another hero Arthur’s part in 
the account of his stay with Morgain in fairyland, a name 
similar to Guingamor, if not the same name, was that chosen 
for the knight. The induction to this episode was fittingly 
attached to a mortal theme by the author of a lay, and the 
hero named Guigemar. Elements of the Guingamor type of 
narrative entered with the similar name, and explain Chrétien’s 
reference, the allusions in Malory, and certain features in the 
French prose romances. The story was rationalized and

  Morgain and Guiomar 73 
changed in scene to Arthur’s court, and in this way assumed 
the form that we know in the prose romances in the episode of 
Morgain and Guiomar. Thus Morgain’s part remains the 
same throughout, Arthur’s name is dropped from the story, 
Guiomar, owing to the traditions already associated with a 
name similar to his, is substituted for it, and therefore his 
name or one resembling it appears in romance regularly in 
connection with fairyland and an other-world love, but with 
two distinct branches of the fairy-mistress theme attached 
to it! 
The story of Guiomar, accordingly, is an admirable example 
of the methods in which romantic material was treated by nar- 
rators. Just as the same acanthus whose tendrils adorn the 
rim of a cup is to be traced also in the design of a Corinthian 
capital, so in popular tradition a single theme may assume 
manifold forms and be varied according to its environment. 
1 So excellent an illustration of the situation in general is furnished by the devel- 
opment of the Lycurgus legend in Greece that it is perhaps pardonable to cite 
here material that is so foreign to our own. In Laconia there is evidence that 
a temple was dedicated to Athena Opthalmitis by Lycurgus, who had lost his eye 
at the hands of a certain person shown to be of chthonic origin. In Arcadia we 
find a Lycurgus, the brother of a priestess of Athena Alea who is allied to Athena 
Opthalmitis. In Thrace the legend tells of a Lycurgus who lost his eye as a 
punishment from Zeus or Dionysus in a contest with the latter, in Thrace a 
chthonic divinity. In Delphi, Dionysus, a chthonic god, is at strife with Apollo, 
in whose cult the wolf (Avkos) appears; the summit of Parnassus is known as 
Lykoreia, and the Delphic Apollo himself is designated as Avxwpets, Auxdpe.os. 
In Argos there is connected with the cult of Apollo Lykios the legend of a contest 
between a wolf and a bull, in which the wolf is victorious —a legend in which 
there is evidence that the wolf represents Apollo Lykios, and the bull, Dionysus. 
Not to cite further instances, these already given show that the Lycurgus legend 
was diffused throughout Greece in various forms connected almost invariably with 
a strife between a chthonic power and another hero or god with whom Lycurgus 
is associated, sometimes only through an appellation connected with the same 
name. (For these facts see Sam Wide, Bemerkungen 2u der spartanischen Lykur- 
goslegende, Upsala, 1891.) In other words similar legends are associated with the 
same or similar names.

MORGAIN AND OGIER LE DANOIS 
Morgue l’amie Ogier

Tue unknown author of the fourteenth-century romance, 
Brun de la Montaigne, mentions Arthur’s cousin 
c’on dit Morgue la fée 
Qui d’Ogier le Danois fu moult lonc temps privée. 
Fate has decreed that his words should prove tantalizing to his 
readers of to-day, for the material that was evidently familiar 
to him eludes us altogether, and it is only in sources later 
than that. which he had before him that we find the account 
of Morgain’s love for Ogier le Danois. Neither the twelfth- 
century poem of Raimbert de Paris, La Chevalerie Ogier,? nor 
the redaction of its first canto, known as Les Enfances Ogier, 
made about 1270 by Adenet le Roi, gives even a hint that the 
hero penetrated the mysteries of Avalon. To the fourteenth 
century we owe a vifacimento in alexandrines of Raimbert’s 
Chevalerie, which by a judicious use of some eighteen thousand 
additional verses extended the round of the hero’s experiences, 
and allowed them to include a visit to Avalon.5 This poem is 
preserved in three manuscripts, one of the fourteenth century 
in Paris, in the Bibliothéque de ]’Arsenal,® one of the fif- 
teenth century in the British Museum,’ and another of the

has been edited in complete form; merely a few fragments 
have been published, and of these only meagre portions that 
concern Ogier’s relations to Morgain.? In the fifteenth cen-

said to follow the poem closely.2 In the sixteenth century 
another poem was produced recounting the adventures of 
Ogier in fairyland, Le premier livre des visions d’Ogier le

Morgain and Ogier,—a scanty amount of first-hand French 
material available in this country, but many summaries of 
varying degrees of usefulness.’ We have a Danish version 
of the prose romance by Christiern Pedersen,* from which, so 
far as we can tell, the French sources show no important 
variations in those parts that concern Morgain. In fact the

76: Morgain and Ogier le Danois 
the outline of Ogier’s doings in Avalon is practically inva- 
riable in the sources. 
In this part of the narrative there is sufficient material to 
fill many pages of a romance, yet the story is simple and 
familiar in its structure. For a brief outline we may ask 
nothing better than that given by Professor Child!:— 
“Six fairies made gifts to Ogier at his birth. By the favor of five he 
was to be the strongest, the bravest, the most successful, the handsomest, 
the most susceptible, of knights: Morgan’s gift was that, after a long and 
fatiguing career of glory, he should live with her at her castle of Avalon, 
in the enjoyment of a still longer youth and never wearying pleasures. 
When Ogier had passed his one hundredth year, Morgan took measures to 
carry out her promise. She had him wrecked, while he was on a voyage 
to France, on a loadstone rock conveniently near to Avalon, which Avalon is 
a little way this side of the terrestrial Paradise. In due course he comes 
to an orchard, and there he eats an apple which affects him so peculiarly 
that he looks for nothing but death. He turns to the east, and sees a beau- 
tiful lady, magnificently attired. He takes her for the Virgin; she corrects 
his error, and announces herself as Morgan the Fay. She puts a ring on 
his finger which restores his youth, and then places a crown on his head 
which makes him forget all the past. For two hundred years Ogier lived 
in such delights as no worldly being can imagine, and the two hundred 
years seemed to him but twenty; Christendom was then in danger, and 
even Morgan thought his presence was required in this world. The crown 
being taken from his head, the memory of the past revived and with it the 
desire to return to France. He was sent back by the fairy, properly pro- 
vided, vanquished the foes of Christianity in a short space, and after a 
time was brought back by Morgan the Fay to Avalon.” 
Leaving for the time being Ogier’s welcome into this world 
by fays, we may turn to his experiences in Avalon and their 
sequel. Renier has pointed out? their similarity to those of 
Partonopeus, who is sent by the fay Melior from her magic 
castle to France to fight for his native land.3 It is probable, 
too, that the author also knew the Batazlle Loguifer* Ogier, 
like Renoart, as he enters Avalon is met by fays who pay him 
great honor. He, too, finds Arthur in Avalon and is greeted 
lovingly by him. In the Batazlle Loguifer Renoart has to 
do combat on his arrival in Avalon with a certain monster 
Kapalu; Ogier meets in battle in Arthur’s stead a King

  Morgain and Ogier le Danois TF: 
Kapalus, who defies him shortly after he has entered Avalon. 
Moreover Morgain in both poems shipwrecks her beloved ; in 
the Bataille Loguifer, it is true, for the sake of vengeance, in 
Ogier to bring him to her own abode. But Morgain is not 
depicted in the Bataille Loguifer as she is in the Oger. In 
the former she is passionate and rancorous ; in the Oger, even 
though not in our eyes resembling the Virgin Mary,! she is 
gentle and queenly. 
Ogier certainly enjoys no great distinction in being the sub- 
ject of a fairy retention at Morgain’s hands ; but his story 
does not belong with those discussed above in connection with 
Arthur and Guiomar. None of these contains the fay’s pro- 
hibition, the hero’s violation thereof, and the fay’s ultimate 
forgiveness and reunion with the hero, all of which are ele- 
ments in the Ogzer story. We must look a little more closely 
at some of the details of the narrative if we would attempt to 
classify it correctly. 
It was while Ogier was suffering from the deadly sickness caused by the 
apple of Avalon that Morgain appeared to him, and telling him that she 
had loved him since his birth, summoned him to dwell with her as her true 
love in Avalon; and Ogier gave the old response sent by Cuchulinn to 
Fand: —“ Dear lady, it is not meet that I should hold converse with you 
nor your fair maidens, for I am wholly sick and sore.” But Morgain 
answered, “Be content, I shall make you all sound again”; and by a 
touch from her hand he was restored to perfect health.2 Then she led him 
to Avalon, where he was greeted with maidens’ mirth, songs and lays and 
glad cheer, and two centuries of enjoyment had begun for him. A son, 
Meurvin, was born to him and Morgain, who, we may note in passing, duly 
became the hero of a long romance.’ When the time came for Ogier to 
think of home and to return to France, Morgain told him how long he had 
been with her; but he did not believe her words, and preferred to test their 
truth for himself. She bade him never forget her, and never speak in this 
world of the wonders of Avalon. As a parting gift, she gave him a fire- 
brand, telling him that when it should be consumed by fire, he would die. 
Equipped with his ring that gave him a youthful appearance, Ogier was

  78 Morgain and Ogier le Danois 
transported by a cloud to this world. He found matters changed by the 
flight of two hundred years, but was able to fit into his place as a doughty 
warrior of France. For safe-keeping he left his firebrand with the Abbot 
of St. Faro, before he entered upon a series of valiant deeds, At the 
death of King Philip of France, his widow sought Ogier in marriage. 
According to the poem, however, Ogier was weary of this vale of tears, 
and at once took measures to leave it. He rode to the Abbey of St. Faro, 
demanded the firebrand, and flung it into the flames, took his ring from his 
finger, and instantly became an old man three hundred years of age. 
Et ainsi beaux seigneurs que le tison ardoit 
Et par cause de feu illec ainerrissoit 
Ainsi le corps Ogier ille se declinoit 
Et ainsi que le bers en ce peril estoit

Et osta le tison qui ens ou feu flamboit 
Dedens un riche char qui tout de feu sembloit 
Fist eslever Ogier et si le ravissoit 
Et ne seut quil devint labbe qui la estoit 
Ensement fu ravis en faerie droit. 1 
In the extant Morgain material there is no other case where 
this theme occurs. It begins as the story does that we cannot 
but believe early became a part of the Morgain saga, and with 
which we have become familiar in connection with Arthur and 
Alisander. Morgain lures the hero to Avalon by promises of 
healing the sickness that she has caused. After this the story 
of Ogier diverges from the others, and follows the Guingamor 
type. In addition to the details from the lay of Guingamor 
that have already been given, we may recall to mind here 
that when Guingamor is led by his mistress to her beautiful 
castle, he is met by a gay company of knights and their amzes ; 
within he finds the knights whom he had thought departed 
from earth. When he has passed, as he supposes, three days 
with his love and she tells him that they have been together 
three hundred years, he refuses to believe her and must needs 
depart to earth to prove her words. He finds himself an 
unknown stranger in familiar scenes peopled with new faces. 
1 See Renier, Mem. della R. A. delle Sc. di Torino, Serie 2, XLI, 431, 432. In 
the prose romance the torch is of minor importance, and the ring is the more 
prominent gift. Here also Ogier suffers a rather different taking off. As he 
is about to go to the altar to be wedded to the Queen of France, a beautiful 
maiden clad in white and shining garments appears to him, embraces him, and 
carries him off in a great cloud to Avalon. See Renier, as above, 446, 447; Kong 
Olger Danshes Kronicke, p. 311.
-P-A-G-E-91
Morgain and Ogier le Danots 79 
He has the mien of a gallant young knight, but by his disregard 
of his fairy love’s parting injunction he loses the other-world 
gift of eternal youth. i 
An identification of the two stories makes Ogier’s connec- 
tion with Morgain easy to explain. His, like Arthur’s, is a 
name to which heroic and romantic deeds were probably 
attached even so early as the twelfth century! Literary con- 
vention in mediaeval France insisted that any hero of renown 
should be blessed with the love of asupernatural maiden. The 
situation was demanded. So it is far from strange that at a time 
when “Breton” themes were used as a veneer for decadent 
epic material, as in the Bataille Loguifer and Huon de Bor- 
deaux, Ogier should be regarded as the beloved of Morgain la 
fée, and like Arthur should be summoned to Avalon for healing. 
More than one parallel is to be drawn between episodes told 
of these two great heroes, for example, in the gifts that fairies 
give them in infancy, in their anticipated return to earth from 
the other world. 
How then does it happen that the story of Morgain and 
Ogier resembles so much more closely that of Guingamor than 
it does that of Morgain and Arthur? Doubtless because many 
features from the tale of Guingamor and the supernatural 
maiden whom he loved had been transferred to the story of 
Morgain and her lover whose name was easily associated 
with his. In the saga of Ogier we find additional reason to 
trust the indications held out by the Guiomar material that 
this was the case. Ward? says that with the exception of 
the firebrand the ‘fairy machinery seems to be chiefly 
imitated from that of the Chanson of the Bataille Loquifer”; 
but although a version of the Batazlle Loguifer was doubtless 
before our author, he possibly was also familiar with a version 
1 See Barrois, Za Chevalerie Ogier, pp. xlv ff. ; Renier, Mem. della R. A. delle 
Sc. di Torino, Serie 2, XLI, 457; Voretzsch (Uber die Sage von Ogier dem Dinen, 
Halle, 1891, p. 30) cites a passage from the Pseudo- Turpin as evidence that songs 
dealing with Ogier were known as early as the middle of the twelfth century; 
cf. also Voretzsch, pp. 31-33. 
21,607. The firebrand Ward attributes to the story of Meleager. A reason 
for its being found in Morgain’s possession may perhaps be derived from the 
Huth Merlin, where Merlin is said to create similar torches, and thus to arouse 
Morgain’s desire to learn his art that she may do what he does. See p. 226, 
note.

of Morgain’s amour with Guiomar that had been very per- 
ceptibly colored by the kind of incidents known to us through 
the lay of Guingamor. Probably to this story, too, there 
remained clinging the early episode of the promised fairy 
healing. If we attempt to assert just why this theme should 
have been transferred to Ogier, we shall be wise above what 
is written. A plausible reason, however, is that a famous fairy 
theme was naturally that chosen to be repeated of an important 
person, such as Ogier. Moreover, because Arthur was known 
to be in Avalon with Morgain—even though not as her 
lover, —a theme already attached to Morgain’s name would 
naturally be selected as that to be told of Ogier, who thus 
would follow not only Arthur but many another distinguished 
hero to a resting place in Avalon, Morgain’s island. Granted 
this development, the Bataille Loguifer might well be drawn 
upon for some of Ogier’s adventures after he reached Avalon. 
Morgain herself is in the Ogier story very little more than 
a type of a beguiling supernatural woman, devoid of the per- 
sonality that characterizes her in the earlier material. There 
are other episodes which will be discussed later, that represent 
the same stage in the Morgain tradition, where she appears to 
be simply a typical fairy queen.

  CHAPTER VII 
THE VAL SANZ RETOR 
E ancora vi venne chavalier ben cento 
che lancelotto avie diliberati 
gia per adrieto pello inchantamento 
ove morghana gli avien prigionati 
in una valle'chon grande arghomento 
in questo locho ov’ erano impacciati 
i’ chavalieri ch’ io chonto tutti quanti 
era la valle de fallaci amanti.? 
THERE is an episode connected with Morgain’s name, which 
in one of the sources is represented as a sequel to her love for 
Guiomar, and which it will be of interest to look at now before 
turning to the remaining stories that show Morgain’s hostility 
toward Guinevere. The scene of this episode is a famous 
valley, known as the Val sanz Retor, because no knight has 
ever returned therefrom, and also asthe Val des faux amants,* 
because no knight who has ever been false to his lady even in 
thought can leave the valley when once he has entered it. 
The story of the valley is told in the prose Lancelot,? the 
Livre d@’ Artus, P.,* and a conte, Le Vallon des Faux Amants® 
(1) The Creation of the Valley. 
According to all the sources except the Livre d’Artus, P., Morgain 
believed herself beloved by a certain knight upon whom she had for a 
long time set her affection, but who had really given his love to another 
maiden more beautiful than she. One day the lovers met in a smiling 
valley, and here they were surprised by Morgain. In her rage and grief 
she cast a spell upon the valley, so that no knight who once entered there, 
if he had been false to his love in any respect, could leave. By her magic 
also she made her rival fancy herself enclosed in ice from her feet to her 
girdle, and wrapped in flame from her girdle to her hair. [In Le Vallon 
des Faux Amants, Morgain tantalizingly fastens the two lovers within

sight of each other.] The enchantment shall last until the coming of a 
knight who has never been false to his love in deed or thought. 
In the Livre d’Artus, P., the story runs that Morgain, after her separa- 
tion by the queen from Guiomar, in order to have him again under her 
control, and to anger the queen and the Round Table, as well as to be able 
to take from the queen any knight whom she loves, creates the Val sanz 
Retor by the art that she has learned from Merlin. 
(2) The Features of the Valley. 
The valley is long and wide, fair and verdant, watered by a sparkling 
fountain. It is spread at the foot of lofty hills, and is completely sur- 
rounded by a wall of mist through which alone lies entrance and egress, 
and which appears to follow closely him who passes through it. At the 
entrance Morgain builds the so-called Chapelle Morgain, which affords the 
inhabitants of the valley an opportunity to enjoy the comforts of religion. 
A single road leads through the valley, adorned with beautiful dwellings. 
Although the knights confined there remain unwillingly, the life is glad 
and gay, constant ames may abide with their lovers, and all beguile the 
time with feasting, music, dancing, chess, and draughts. At one point the 
road leads through a low, narrow passage, guarded by two fire-breathing 
dragons. It passes on over a boiling torrent that can be crossed only by 
means of a narrow plank defended by knights on the opposite shore. Further 
on a wall of flames obstructs the way, and still more adventures? must be 
encountered by him who travels along this path, which leads to the palace 
of Morgain. 
(3) The Dispelling of the Enchantment. 
(Lancelot; Paris, R. T. R.: — Galeschin, duke of Clarence, attempts the 
adventures of the valley. He makes his way as far as the bridge, but is 
overcome by its defenders and taken into a garden where he finds many 
former comrades. Yvain and Lancelot, on their way to another adventure, 
pass through the valley. Yvain enters first, and is luckless enough to meet 
the same fate as Galeschin. Lancelot is not to be deterred from following 
his comrade.] He dashes boldly into the mist, kills both dragons, crosses 
the bridge without a tremor, and routs five defenders on the opposite shore. 
He chances to bethink him of a ring that the Dame du Lac has given 
him, which has virtue to overcome all enchantments. As soon as he 
exposes it to view, the water and plank vanish. He passes through the 
wall of flame, and pushes boldly forward until ‘he reaches a stairway 
defended by three knights. Two of these he vanquishes, the third leads 
him a long chase through hall and apartments and garden into a beautiful 
pavilion, where Morgain lies slumbering peacefully on a luxurious couch. 
The knight conceives the idea of taking refuge under the couch, but Lancelot

awakening, dashes after the fleeing knight, and succeeds in beheading him 
in a distant apartment. Then, the knight’s head in his hand, he returns to 
Morgain, drops on his knees before her, and tenders her the head with a 
humble apology for having upset her couch. The captive knights, Mor- 
gain’s first lover among them, come thronging in and hail Lancelot as their 
deliverer. Morgain tries to conceal her rage at the destruction of her valley. 
She bids Lancelot pass the night in her castle, and before dawn she casts 
him into an enchanted sleep, and conveys him to one of her favorite forest 
dwellings. The next morning the rescued knights find themselves with 
their horses in the midst of a plain, but the castle, water, garden, and walls 
of air have vanished.! 
Nobody can read this long and elaborate episode without 
immediately recognizing that whatever the germ of the story 
is, in the form that reaches us here it suspiciously resembles 
a late concoction. With the exception of those episodes in 
which Morgain is represented distinctly as living in Avalon 
(e.g., the Vita Merlini, Bataille Loquifer, Gesta Regum Britan- 
niae), her abode here is more purely an other-world abode than 
in any other incident told of her. For in the Val sanz Retor we 
are dealing distinctly with an other-world adventure. Merely 
the name of the valley is enough to indicate this,? and its impor- 
tant features may all be paralleled from other-world scenes. It 
belongs, as Philipot has pointed out,’ to the same class of region 
as the garden of La Joze de la Cour* and the enchanted garden 
of the Queen of Denmark,® to the castle of mist where the 
Noir Chevalier is confined, and to Merlin’s air-bounded prison.® 
The scene of the adventure known as La Joie de la Cour is laid in the 
garden of Brandigain, the island castle of king Evrain. This garden, 
where magic fruit and perennial flowers grow and where birds sing with 
1 The analysis of the undated conte, Le Vallon des Faux Amants, gives noth- 
ing beyond Lancelot’s entrance to the valley. It is evidently based on the Lance-

ravishing sweetness, is enclosed by a high wall of air, so fashioned that 
only by flying is it possible for any creature to enter it. There is, however, 
une estroite entrée, through which a crowd of people succeed in going into 
the garden. Here the knight, Mabonagrain, is kept in confinement by a 
maiden whom he had long loved, and who had bidden him in fulfillment of 
a promise that he would always do her will remain in the garden until a 
knight should enter who could conquer him. Erec is the victorious knight 
who dispels the enchantment by forcing Mabonagrain to declare himself 
recreant. The joy of the people of the castle knows no bounds, and they 
hail Erec as the restorer of gladness to the court of .Evrain. The fay is 
sad at the loss of her knight, but yields to consolation derived from Enid.* 
The mist-enclosed garden of the Queen of Denmark was established for 
purposes of revenge. She fears for the safety of her son Oriel of whom 
Gawain is in pursuit, and wishing to decoy knights from the path that 
Oriel will take, she establishes the adventure of the garden; especially, with 
the intention of giving Logres to Oriel, she hopes to imprison Arthur here 
in revenge for the ill that he has done her in war. The wall of air that 
surrounds the garden has a single opening for entrance and for egress, but 
he who has once tasted of the magic apples that grow within can never 
leave it. If a knight refuse to eat the fruit, he must fight with two bands 
of ten knights each and with three giants. Those who eat the fruit lose 
all desire to leave the garden, and dwell there happily in complete forget- 
fulness of their interrupted quests. Saigremor, Arthur, and Gawain enter, 
overcome the champions, and dispel the enchantment, to the wrath of the 
Queen of Denmark.’ 
These episodes explain the type of place to which the Val 
sanz Retor belongs. The walls of air from which there is no 
exit, like the druidic mist common in Celtic stories, indicate the 
bewildering effect of the fairy power. In the Val sanz Retor 
and the version of La Jote de la Cour in Geraint, the hedge of 
mist is unbroken and there is no question of entering the 
other world except by dashing through the barrier. This is 
the primitive condition ; the druidic mist completely envelops

the hero, and there is properly no escape from the fay’s power. 
Thus Galeschin, unable as he is to overcome the spell of his 
surroundings, is pursued by the mist after he thinks that he 
has passed through it. 
Once within the wall of air we find ourselves clearly in the 
other world. Beautiful dwellings, feasting, music, and chess 
are accepted commonplaces of fairyland. The adventures, 
too, are quite as distinctively other-world as the delights of the 
valley. According to Chrétien’s story, Lancelot on his way to 
the land don nus estranges ne retorne is told that one of the 
dangers of his road is the passage des pierres, well defended 
and so narrow that only one knight can pass through it at a 
time.? Moreover, of the two magic bridges by which the Land 
without Return can be entered, that selected by Lancelot for 
his approach is the so-called pont de /’épée.2 This remarkable

Livre d’Artus, P., § 113. The origin of such a bridge as the pont de Pépée is 
perhaps explained by a passage in Audhwch and Olwen, which mentions the 
magic dagger of Berwyn. “When Arthur and his hosts came before a torrent, 
they would seek for a narrow place where they might pass the water, and would 
lay the sheathed dagger across the torrent, and it would form a bridge sufficient 
for the armies of the Islands of Britain, and of the three Islands adjacent with 
their spoil” (A/adinogion, II, 264). Cf. the bridge high as a tower and sharp as 
a razor which is said to span a boiling torrent at the entrance to the Terrestrial 
Paradise in the English Owain Miles (Edinburgh, 1837, p. 35); on this cf. Brown, 
Studies and Notes, VIII, p. 123. For examples of dangerous bridges see Meyer 
and Nutt, I, 77 : — Mongan’s bridge, which falls beneath those who are crossing it, 
when they reach the middle; Zs. f d. Alt, XX XIII (1889), 160:— the bridge on 
the seventeenth island in the Voyage of Maelduin, on which he who steps falls 
backward ; Cuchullin Saga, p.75; Arch. Rev., I (1888), 299:— the Bridge of the 
Cliff, which “ had two low ends and the middle space high, and whenever anybody 
leaped on one end of it, the other head would lift itself up and throw him on his 
back”; Perceval; vv. 28,411-28,482 : — the bridge built for Carmadit by his fairy 
mistress, left unfinished because of his death, which extends half-way across a 
rushing stream ; when stepped on by Perceval, it utters a noise, unfastens itself

bridge is as narrow as a sword-blade, and spans a boiling tor- 
rent. Lancelot sees two horrible lions guarding the opposite 
shore, but he crosses the bridge in spite of wounds and slashes, 
healed and supported, adds the courtly Chrétien, by love. 
When he has crossed, he finds that the lions have vanished 
completely. 
Il met sa main devant sa face, 
S’esgarde son anel et prueve, 
Quant nul des deus lions n’i trueve 
Qu’il i cuidoit avoir véuz, 
Qu’ anchantez fu et decéuz; 
Car il n’i avoit rien qui vive. 
Rigomer® recounts the adventures of Lancelot when he tried 
to free Dionise, the mistress of the castle Rigomer, from 
the spell cast upon her dwelling by a fay. ‘Dans la lande 
qui entoure le chateau, on peut jouter et mener belle vie, 
pourvu que l’on consente a n’y entrer que désarmé; mais, 
si l’on veut passer le pont qui traverse le fossé, il faut com- 
battre un serpent monstrueux, et quand méme on arriverait a 
le vaincre, on n’en serait pas moins s{irement ou tué ou dés- 
honoré.’”’ Although Lancelot overcomes the serpent, he is 
enticed by a maiden into the castle, given a lance that 
deprives him of courage and a ring that deprives him of 
memory, and remains a prisoner until he is at last freed 
by Gawain. When Ogier enters Avalon an angel comes to 
him and bids him meet undaunted whatever adventure may 
befall him. The path leads him to a beautiful palace, but as 
he enters its portal two ravening lions spring upon him. Of 
course he fells one of them to the ground and smites off the 
head of the other. Renoart,? Carduino,* and Bel Gherardino® 
all encounter at their entrance to fairyland monsters or ani- 
mals that are really human beings enchanted into the shape 
from which the deed of the hero releases them. So also in 
the Voyage of Maelduin we have an example in a somewhat 
different form of the other test of Lancelot that our versions

mention, namely the wall of fire: “Ils apergurent ensuite 
une petite ile; un mur de feu l’entourait, ce mur était mobile 
et tournait tout autour.”! Finally, after the adventures of the 
valley have all been accomplished and the enchantment dis- 
pelled, the entire scene vanishes, as fairyland ever has vanished 
from the eyes of the mortal who has overcome the other-world 
power or been abandoned by it.? 
It is not necessary to resort to any of the attempts at popu- 
lar etymologizing of Avalon into elements that connected it 
with a valley ® in order to account for the location of Morgain’s 
dwelling in this episode. Celtic stories tell of magic glens 
that are the abode of horrors, essentially places of danger 
where the hero’s valor is to be tested. 
By the enchantment of Dornolla, a loathly maiden whose love Cuchulinn 
has spurned, he is separated from his companions in a journey across Alba 
to the dwelling of Scathach ; he loses his way and is forced to take a road 
that leads him through the Perilous Glen, across which there lies a single 
narrow path beset with monsters sent by an enemy to destroy him.* 
One of Peredur’s adventures takes place in the Round Valley, a circular 
valley surrounded by rocky, wooded sides. Deep in the wood there are 
large black houses, rudely built. Within the wood Peredur comes upon a 
rocky ledge, on which a lion lies asleep. Peredur strikes him from his

Irish Folk Tales and Romances, London, 1893, p. 14:— Three miles of fire are 
passed over by a hero on an other-world quest. Campbell, II, 456 ff.: —A magic 
island has a hoop of fire about it, across which only a valorous knight can leap.

Inconnu, vv. 5303 ff. Cf. Holy Grail, p. 202. 
La Chapelle Morgain is a highly incongruous adjunct to this scene from fairy- 
land. We can hardly refrain from suspecting that we have in it a transferred bit 
of local tradition that attributed to fairy agency the rocky entrance of some valley 
where the mists settle. Megalithic formations are very commonly associated in 
name with fays in Brittany (see Sébillot, 7yad. et Sup. de la H. Bretagne, I, 5 ff., 
106; II, 203; Maury, p. 46; cf. for similar traditions in Ireland, Wood-Martin, 
Pagan Ireland, London, 1895, p. 270). Morgain’s name still lingers in Pléhérel 
in Brittany in the so-called Tertre de la fée Morgant, a spot to which according 
to the popular belief fays used to come (see Sébillot, Zrad. et Sup., 1,97). Tra- 
dition to-day in the Cétes du-Nord classes several unfinished chapels with the work 
of fays, who from one cause or another left their task incomplete (see Sébillot, 
Petite Légende Dorée, No. XLIX).

resting place into the pit beneath, and leads his horse across the ledge down 
into the valley. Here a certain great gray man owns a fair castle, where 
Peredur is entertained for the night, but where he learns that on the 
morrow he must fight with giants who inhabit the black houses in the 
woods. The next day he engages in the inevitable encounter, slays a third 
of the gray man’s giants, and spares the rest on condition that the gray 
man do homage to Arthur.! 
To turn now to a somewhat different type of adventure, the 
scene of which is laid in an other-world valley : — 
In the Lay of the Great Fool (Amadan Mor)* a “solitary valley” 
is described, a place 
Of purest streams, woods, and soil, 
And the roar of the waves on rocky cliffs. 
It is full of witchcraft and enchantment, and leads to Dun-an-Oir (Fort of 
the Gold), the marvellously beautiful dwelling of the Gruagach or enchanter, 
who is the lord of the valley; here the loyalty of the guest to his host 
undergoes a severe test through magic agencies. By enduring the test 
manfully Amadan Mor unspells the Gruagach, who has been disguised 
through sorcery, and he stands revealed as Amadan Mor’s own brother, 
who has long sought him. Near by in the valley is another mansion, the 
dwelling of five terrific giants, whom it takes a deadly contest to overcome.* 
The adventures in the other Celtic glens about which we 
have been reading concern simply the well-being of the indi- 
vidual hero ; they are the necessities of his path. The adven- 
ture performed by Amadan Mor has to do with the unspelling 
of the lord of the magic castle, and herein it resembles that of 
the Val sanz Retor. The latter belongs to that class of other- 
world episode which Alfred Nutt denominates the « unspelling 
quest,” * when, as in the story of the Grail Castle, the mortal 
visitor to the other world goes not to enjoy the smiles of a 
fairy mistress, but to free captives of the other-world power. 
The magic castle of Ygerne,5 the Chastel as Puciéles, has been laid by a 
necromancer’s art under a spell that turns every knight who enters into a

coward. Here are gathered young men and old from all lands, widows 
wrongfully deprived of their possessions, and orphan damsels, all waiting 
until a knight comes so accomplished in knightly virtues that he can with- 
stand the enchantment and perform certain adventures that await him in 
the castle. Then the disinherited ladies shall be reinstated in their posses- 
sions, the damsels shall marry, the young men shall become knights. 
Gawain passes victoriously through the adventures, and is hailed as saviour 
by the inmates of the castle. 
Yvain finds in the Chastel de Pesme Avanture! a band of unhappy 
maidens, ill-fed and ill-attired, who are kept ever weaving silk in a meadow 
by two demi-devils, the lords of the-castle, until a valiant knight shall come 
who can defeat them in contest. Yvain performs the adventure, and is 
loaded with blessings by the released maidens. 
It is probably the same kind of place that is the scene of an 
adventure of Gaheriet described in the Perceval? 
Gaheriet enters a magic castle and passes through a garden into a 
pavilion where he finds a knight and a lady. The knight bursts into a 
tempest of rage because Gaheriet has dared enter the premises unbidden, 
and tells him that he must fight in the garden of the castle with a dwarf.? 
Gaheriet is defeated and then learns from the dwarf that every knight con- 
quered in the garden must return at the end of a year, when he may either 
begin weaving silk in the castle, or engage again in contest with the dwarf ; 
if he is victorious he may go free, if he refuse these conditions he must at once 
be beheaded. Gaheriet agrees to return in a year. As he makes his way 
out of the castle, he sees in a chamber many ladies fashioning girdles, who 
taunt him with defeat; gay companies of ladies and knights playing Aelotes, 
chess, and draughts jeer at him ; a crowd of knights and sergeants gathered 
in the hall mock at him as he passes; people in the streets throw bits of 
fish and meat after him and revile him.* At the end of a year Gaheriet 
returns and kills the dwarf as well as the lord of the castle; but with this 
part of the story there is entangled another adventure, so that we hear 
nothing about the unspelling of the inmates of the castle, which we are 
fain to believe formed part of the original story and gave it a motive. 
It is plain, then, that the Val sanz Retor is an other-world 
region whither a knight goes on an unspelling quest. But 
this is not the end of the story, and another important char- 
acteristic of the scene demands our attention. The valley 
itself does not serve merely as an enchanted prison; it has an 
additional quality which we shall see is found in countless

enchanted objects, —it serves as a fidelity’ test. Only the 
loyal lover can overcome its difficulties. 
» There are two other incidents told of Lancelot that are 
excellent commentaries on the structure of our episode. In 
the first of these we must accompany the magician, Guinebaut, 
“a goode clerke and a wise” according to the English Merlin, 
as he is faring through the Forest Perilleuse, later known as 
the Forest sanz Retor. 
Guinebaut comes in sight of a fair meadow where a carole is being 
danced by knights and ladies before an aged knight and a beautiful 
maiden, whose charms the clerk is not slow to regard with an appreciative 
eye. He succeeds in winning her love by promising to make the carole 
continue as long as she desires ; all men and women who come hither must 
join the dance whether they will or no, until that knight arrives who has 
never been false in love and is the best knight of his time. The maiden, 
delighted with this specimen of her lover’s skill, begs for something better 
yet, and entreats him to make another magic game which shall never fail, 
that all the world may speak thereof after his death. Then Guinebaut 
makes a chessboard of gold and ivory, the pieces of which are self-moving, 
ever-mating, until the best knight who has never been false in love shall 
play against them. 
Lancelot du Lac is the faithful lover destined to put an end to the 
carole and to win the chessboard. Guinebaut abides thereafter ever 
with his love, and teaches her many other secrets of enchantment. He [in 
Le Roi Artus, she] created the carole that Meraugis found in the Cité 
sans nom. 
In the Roman a’ Agravain we read that Lancelot enters the Forest 
Perdue, whence no knight has ever returned. He comes to a tower before 
which knights and ladies under an enchantment are dancing a carole, but 
his arrival breaks the spell, and he learns from the dancers that the destruc- 
tion of the enchantment has been reserved for him. He takes his place at 
the chessboard and mates the opposing chessmen. The spectators hail him 
as victor. He sends the board to the queen, who is at once mated by the 
magic chessmen. Arthur accordingly keeps the board as a priceless gift. 
Naturally we turn at once to the romance of Meraugis de 
Portlesguez® to learn of the hero’s experiences at the Chateau 
des Caroles. He finds a band of maidens dancing a carole led 
by a solitary knight about a green pine in the court of the

castle. No sooner is Meraugis himself within the-court than 
he feels an irresistible desire to join in the song and dance ; 
but when he begins to take part, the other knight withdraws, 
and Meraugis is obliged to remain dancing the carole for ten 
weeks, until the arrival of still a different knight breaks the 
spell and enables him to leave the castle. 
For a similar scene we may look back a good deal earlier 
than the time of Raoul de Houdenc. In the Voyage of Bran,} 
and in the thirty-first adventure of the Voyage of Maclduin®

2 Zs. f. d. Alt., XX XIII (1889), 171: Nutt has pointed out that section 61 of 
the Voyage of Bran is evidently a “mere excrescence” (Meyer and Nutt, I, 171), 
but that this special adventure of the Voyage of Maelduin is so clearly an integral 
part of the tale that it undoubtedly appeared in the original form of the story. 
This gives a date as early as the ninth century, according to F. Lot (Rom., XXIV, 
1893, 326) or perhaps the end of the eighth, according to Zimmer and Nutt (see 
Meyer and Nutt, I, 163), for the story of the irresistible. merry-making, and also 
shows us that the dance is plainly a Celtic other-world feature. 
Survivals of the same adventure are found in modern Celtic tales, which rep- 
resent honest country folk, sometimes enticed by sweet music, coming suddenly 
upon a band of fairy people dancing round and round upon the green. The mortal 
is drawn into the circle, and remains there dancing, oblivious of time. At length, 
after varying intervals, he is rescued by a friend who is obliged to use main force 
to draw him from the dance. In some variants the mortal moulders to dust 
immediately on leaving the fairy circle. See, e.g., the tales collected in Wales 
and Scotland given by Hartland, Science of Fairy. Tales, London, 1891, pp. 161 ff.

The widely diffused story of the Dancers of Kélbigk appears to show, as 
Professor Schofield has suggested to me, the influence of the Celtic fairy dance. 
(For the story see William of Malmesbury, Gesta Regum Anglorum, ed. Stubbs, 
London, 1887, II, § 174; Robert Mannyng of Brunne, Handlyng Synne, ed. Fur- 
nivall, London, 1862, vv. 6890-6940; William of Wadington, Le Manuel des 
Pechiez, publ. in Handlyng Synne, ed. cit., vv. 6890-6940. See also for a full 
collection and discussion of these and other sources Schréder, Zs. f. Kirchen- 
geschichte, XVII, 1896-1897, 96 ff.; G. Paris, Journal des Savanis, December, 
1899, 733 ff.) A company of young men and maidens in the Saxon town of 
Colebize (Kélbigk) one Christmas eve were tempted by the devil to indulge in a 
gay dance in the cemetery by the church of Saint Magnus. The priest commanded 
them to cease from such sacrilege, but they paid no heed to him and went on with 
their dance. Although his own daughter was among the number, the priest at 
once called down an imprecation upon them: Utinam potentia Dei et merito sancti 
Magni martiris sic inguieti annum cantando ducatis. His son seized his sister by

92. The Val sanz Retor 
the story is recorded of a gay multitude dwelling on an other- 
world island in whose continual laughter and games a mortal 
visitor must perforce join, and which he never can leave. This 
island has already been connected by Ferdinand Lot with the 
carole of Meraugis, though he does not pursue the analogy to 
that of Guinebaut.!. The three sources, however, the Celtic 
stories, Meraugis, and the Guinebaut episode, really mark 
_three distinct stages in the treatment of the theme. In the 
Celtic stories it appears in its simple form, in the Meraugis 
the influence of the “custom”’ is perceptible, in the episode of 
Guinebaut still a further step is taken. 
In this source the name of the land in which the carole is 
established, the Forest sanz Retor, — the amusements created 
the arm, attempting to draw her out from the band by force, but the arm came off 
in his hand, yet not a drop of blood flowed. For a year the dance continued. 
The dancers felt no storm, knew neither cold nor heat, hunger nor thirst, their 
garments did not wear out, their hair did not grow long. At the end of the year 
the curse was removed ; the company were released from the dance, and a deep 
sleep fell upon them, in which they continued for three days and three nights. 
Then three of the number died, the rest remained throughout their lives the vic- 
tims of a twitching of the limbs (tremor membrorum) as a memorial of their sin. 
The elements of this dance, if we eliminate the churchly influence, are identical 
with those of the dance in the Forest sanz Retor, the Chateau des Caroles, and the 
Celtic islands, and lead naturally to the supposition that this is an instance where 
Celtic material has been made use of in a tale that served to explain some physi- 
cal infirmity, such as St. Vitus’ dance (see Schroder, p. 104; Paris, pp. 734, 744), 
and also to point the moral which we find emphasized by William of Wadington 
and Robert of Brunne that dancing on holy days is sacrilegious. (Cf. for the pos- 
sible interlacing of Celtic tradition and the legends of the church pp. 53, 191, 
note 1; also, although here the parallel is less close, with the blooming gardens 
made in January by enchantment, mentioned p. 207, note, cf. Jacopo da Voragine, 
Legenda Aurea, ed. Grasse, Leipzig, 1850, p. 911.) 
For remarks suggestive of the possible Breton provenience of the material see 
Paris, p. 734; cf. Schréder, pp. 105, 106. Cf. also the Breton folk tales which 
tell of an innocent company of dancers whom the devil joins, usually in the form 
of a gay gallant, who is an admirable dancer, and who compels the mortals to con- 
tinue the dance unceasingly whether they will or no; a priest comes upon the 
scene, drives the devil away, and releases the dancers from the spell (see Sébillot, 
Trad. et Sup. de la Haute Bretagne, 1, 192 ff.; Littérature Orale de la Haute 
Bretagne, Paris, 1881, p. 172). 
1 Rom., XXIV (1895), 325. It is doubtless a reminiscence of the unvalorous 
release of one participant in the carole of Meraugis simply by the advent of a new- 
comer, that occasions the discrepancy in the story of Le Roi Artus ; here it is said 
that the dancers of to-day in Guinebaut’s carole must take the place of the dancers 
of yesterday, although the entire point of the narrative consists in the fact that 
none can leave the dance or the forest until Lancelot dispels the enchantment.

by the enchanter, cavoles and chess, the name of the lady, 
corrupted though it seems in the forms that we have, la Dame 
de la Terre Estrange Soustenue,! Terre Lointaine,2 Londe 
Susteyn,3 Honorable la dame de la Terre  Soutaine,*— all 
indicate that it is essentially the other world to which the 
carole belongs. But here it is made use of by an enchanter as 
a means to stir a lady’s admiration; hence it receives a new 
introduction, and is no longer an isolated feature in the story. 
It also receives a conclusion, — the condition that the spell can 
be broken only by the coming of the faithful lover, Lancelot. 
Very much the same is true of the magic chessboard, which 
we shall find elsewhere in the romances used to test a knight 
in one way or another, but not to prove whether he be a 
perfect lover. The first part of the Guinebaut story, as we 
shall see when we come to examine the legend of Merlin and 
Niniane, very probably existed as an ordinary theme in inde- 
pendent narratives, and the conclusion, which gives a reason 
for the magic creations by letting them exhibit Lancelot’s flaw- 
less love for the queen, places the incident among the many 
that in the romances are attached to the name of Lancelot to 
enhance what had become his most prominent characteristic, 
namely, his devotion to the queen. The compiler is using a 
typical other-world situation and object in the service of 
Lancelot and of his romance.®

5 A parallel treatment of other-world material, Professor Schofield reminds 
me, appears in the Lai du Trot (ed. Monmerqué and Michel in Renaut, Zai 
a’ Ignaures, Paris, 1832, pp. 71-83), where a fairy cavalcade is made the basis for 
a Court of Love allegory. As a certain knight of Bretagne, Lorois by name, rode 
out to the woods one April morning, he saw come from the forest two gay com- 
panies of beautiful ladies, who wore fine raiment and were crowned with garlands 
of flowers; they were mounted on snow-white palfreys, whose pace was marvel- 
lously swift, yet almost imperceptible to the rider. Each maiden was attended by 
a handsome, gallant lover. Za ot moult delitouse vie. Ere long Lorois heard a 
sound of wailing, and saw another band of maidens emerge from the forest, 
mounted on horses that were lean and spare, in broken harness. Each damsel 
went her way alone, without a lover, in tattered clothes, and riding at a violent 
pace. The maidens were followed by a band of youths in the same wretched 
plight. One of the company explained to Lorois that the happy ladies and their 
lovers were they who in life had been loyal servants of Love; whereas the for- 
lorn and dolorous band was composed of those who had been disdainful of his 
claims. Never should they have rest summer nor winter, and they who refused 
to love could not escape joining the cavalcade.

94 The Val sanz Retor 
That this is exactly the principle upon which the episode of 
the Val sanz Retor is constructed is obvious from the incidents 
cited above, that furnish parallels to individual features. It is 
all the more clear when we read the story in Claris et Laris of 
a wonderful valley over which Morgain presides. 
This company that Lorois met bears a close resemblance to a pure fairy caval- 
cade. Such a train rode forth from the other world in quest of Heurodas, the 
wife of Sir Orfeo (see Siz Orfeo, ed. Zielke, Breslau, 1880, vv. 55-328). As Heu- 
rodas lay sleeping one day under a tree, there came to her the fairy king attended 
by a train of fairy riders 
Al.on snowewhite stedes, 
As white as milke were her wedes. 
The king made Heurodas ride beside him on a snow-white palfrey to the other 
world. When Orfeo was deprived of his bride, he dwelt in solitude in the forest. 
Often he saw the King of Fairy with his route come hunting through the woods ; 
often he watched a great host of knights gallop by, and mysteriously vanish. A 
. band of ladies, too, came riding past him, “gentle and jolif,” and not a man 
amongst them. With them he espied Heurodas, who also saw him, and wept. 
pe oper levedis pis yseize 
And maked hir oway to ride; 
Sche most wip him no lenger abide. 
The ballad of Zam Lin relates a similar experience of Tam Lin who, carried to 
fairyland by the Queen o’ Fairies, must needs ride in her train, “just at the mirk 
and midnight hour” of Hallowe’en (see Child, Ballads, I, 340 ff. For the fairy 
cavalcade cf. Kittredge, Am. Journ. of Phil., VII (1886), 189; Gervasius of 
Tilbury, ed. Liebrecht, pp. 121 ff.; S#/va Gadelica, II, 187). 
The essential difference between the fairy cavalcade in the Lai du Trot and the 
others to which I have referred is one of motive. In the former there is no 
return from the fairy company when the mortal has once joined it, and it is just 
as difficult for the rider to leave the snow-white fairy horse as for one of the 
dancers in the Chastel des Caroles to leave his place, or for one of the unhappy 
maidens in the Chastel de Pesme Avanture to cease from her silk-weaving until 
the necessary conditions for release shall be fulfilled. But the members of the 
fairy cavalcade in the Zaz du Trot are depicted as if they were the figures in a 
Court of Love allegory, the faithful servants of Love rewarded by his pleasures, 
or his disdainful scoffers who cannot leave the ceaseless motion that the angry 
god has imposed upon them (see Neilson, Rom., XXIX, 1900, 85 ff.). In 
other words the customs of fairyland are blended with those of the God of Love, 
whose court played so important a part in the social conceptions of mediaeval 
life (cf. Id., Studies and Notes, V1, 156 ff., for a discussion of the mingling of 
fairy lore and Court of Love allegory in the Zs/e of Ladies or Chaucer’s Dream. 
With the pace of the horses in the Lai du Trot cf. that of Rhiannon’s horse, 
above, pp. 3, 4; cf. also that of the Elf-queen’s in Thomas Rhymer, Child, 
Ballads, I, 325). In a similar way the other-world valley is adapted to the pur- 
pose of some special narrator, and given a reason for existence by being repre- 
sented as the place where loyal lovers may be tested.

  The Val sanz Retor 95 
The two gallant knights, Claris and Laris, journeying through Broceli- 
ande, hear toward nightfall sounds of music from all manner of unseen 
instruments. A maiden comes toward them and bids them, if they wish 
shelter for the night, come with her. She leads them to a lovely valley, 
long and broad, adorned with fine dwellings, from which music as sweet as 
that of Paradise is heard. Claris and Laris are taken to a wonderfully 
beautiful palace where they are greeted by twelve fair ladies. One of them 
in reply to a question from Laris tells him that she is a fay, Morgain, the 
sister of Arthur, and that her companions are fays, gud la gent par le mont 
Jfeoient. The knights shall be treated with honor and shall have every 
wish gratified, but they can never leave the valley. Claris is loud in his 
expressions of indignation, but Morgain assures him that, when she and her 
sisters created the enchantment, they did not know that he and Laris were 
coming. The knights remain sad at heart. Laris, however, succeeds in 
ingratiating himself with Madoine, one of the fays, from whom he learns that 
there is a certain small stone made by necromancy that closes the entrance to 
the valley; he who turns this stone may find his way out. Laris and his 
companion avail themselves of this information and secretly depart. 
This is substantially the same valley as the Val sanz Retor. 
It is true that in Broceliande Morgain does not surround her 
abode with a mist nor offer thrilling adventures to the stranger. 
It is no place for testing a hero’s qualities ; it is simply an other- 
world valley, the attractions of which, as they are set forth in the 
verses that I have cited above, are closely parallel to those of 
Morgain’s more famous valley in the prose romances. Claris et 
Laris is a late romance,” quite late enough for the author to have 
derived his material from the Lancelot; but if he were working 
from the Lancelot he was stripping his original of its most 
prominent features, and retaining the name of the mistress, 
as well as elements characteristic of other-world habitations, 
whether they are islands, castles, or valleys. In view of the sort 
of treatment that the cavo/e and chessboard received, it is more 
reasonable to see here the account of an other-world valley 
associated with Morgain, which was made by some narrator 
into a fidelity test for Lancelot’s benefit, and was used by the 
author of Claris et Laris as a suitable feature to work into the 
scenes that he was placing in Broceliande, which Wace even 
in his day knew was the haunt of fays.?

  96 The Val sanz Retor 
There is another valley mentioned in the prose romances 
that is of the same general character as the Val sanz Retor. 
This is the Val des Faux Soulas which is described in the 
Roman de Palamedes. 
The Val des Faux Soulas is a valley of surpassing loveliness, 
the home of singing birds, green and fresh even in mid-winter :? 
21 ne avoit en tout le val noif ne gelee, et sembloit que May fust 
venuz en celuy lieu... cile est lieu de paradis au semblant. 
The valley is the site of two towers situated on opposite banks 
of a stream, one inhabited by knights, the other by ladies, 
between whom there has been unfortunately a long-standing 
feud, which has been suppressed by Galehout le Brun, who in 
behalf of the ladies by force of arms compelled the knights to 
agree never to cross the river in the lifetime of their fair ene- 
mies, and to fight in equal numbers the knights who should 
come to defend them. The knight Danain for love of one of the 
ladies undertakes to act as their defender, but he is an unsuc- 
cessful champion, and being defeated is forced by the knights to 
fight against the ladies’ future champions. When this state of 
affairs has lasted for ten years Danain is rescued. Then it is 
evident that the scene has been the result of enchantment : — 
st devint la vallée aussi seche et ausst froide comme [autre pays. 
Although the episode is unmistakably late, it shows the 
kind of story that formed one of the elements in the tradition 
of the Val sanz Retor.? For that the episode of the Val sanz

which is contained in the fourteenth-century romance of Perceforest (cf. for MSS., 
editions, and dates, Paris, Rom., XXIII, 78-85), there are reminders of the same 
class of stories that we have been examining, although the Zaz de /a Rose is essen- 
tially connected with a wide-spread theme of a different nature (see Paris, Rom., 
XXIII, 102 ff.; Kohler, Jahrb. f. rom. u. engl. Lit., VIII, 1867, 44-65). 
A certain duke of Great Britain was lord of the Val aus Vrais Amans.

The Val sanz Retor 97 
Retor is a concoction and does not represent simple or early 
material is obvious. It seems improbable, however, that we 
owe its composition to the author of the Lancelot, because in 
an earlier part of his romance? he introduces an episode that is 
plainly similar to that of the Val sanz Retor; and the natural 
conclusion is that he had one model before him for both 
accounts. 
During Arthur’s war with Hardogabran, King of the Saxons, he falls a 
victim to the wiles of the beautiful Camille,? the sister of Hardogabran, 
who by her blandishments succeeds in winning his passionate love, and 
getting him altogether under her control. With promises of her love she 
decoys him to her tower, the Roche aus Saisnes, and then imprisons him in 
her dungeon. Her next step is to send a maiden to court with word that 
Arthur is in danger. Gawain, Lancelot, Hector and Galehaut follow the 
damsel to Camille’s tower, and as a result they also are taken prisoners. 
Camille throws an enchantment upon the door that fastens it securely. 
Captivity and separation from Guinevere reduce Lancelot to such a state 
of frenzy that Camille sets him free ; the Dame du Lac restores him to his 
reason, and he forthwith sets out to rescue Arthur. By using the ring 
given him by the Dame du Lac, which has the power of overcoming all 
enchantment, he enters Camille’s tower, routs her knights who oppose his 
course as he passes through room after room, until he reaches the chamber 
where Camille sits with her amz Gadresclain. To make a long story short, 
Lancelot kills him, and frees Arthur and the imprisoned knights. In a 
subterranean vault they find a maiden beloved by Gadresclain, whom 
Camille in furious jealousy has kept in confinement bound to a pillar. 
His fair daughter, Lisane, marries a young knight, Margon, who is compelled by 
sundry misfortunes to leave his bride and enter the service of king Perceforest. 
As a parting gift Lisane gives him a case in which far soutil art she has placed a 
marvellous rose, which will never wither so long as she remains loyal to her 
husband. Two knights at the court of Perceforest, who are jealous of Margon, 
discover the secret of his rose, and plan to steal Lisane’s affection from him. 
They visit her in his absence, and with each in turn she makes assignation to 
meet in a certain tower at night. Each suitor after waiting for the lady in the 
tower finds that he is imprisoned there, and must pass his time in spinning and 
winding thread. They are kept at their disgraceful task until Margon returns 
home, and sets them free. The same story is also told in a shorter form in prose 
in the Perceforest (for a summary see Paris, Rom., XXIII, 99 ff.), but without 
mention of the Val aus Vrais Amans. Paris (p. 101) has indicated the probability 
that both versions are derived from a common source.

-P-A-G-E-110
98 The Val sanz Retor 
The maiden bids her rescuers seize Camille’s book and chest, if they 
would thwart her power. The enchantress, realizing that all is lost, takes 
her own life by flinging herself from the Roche aus Saisnes. 
This episode is a working over and fusing together of two 
main themes:— Arthur’s stay with a dangerous enchantress, 
from whose power he is rescued by one of his knights,! and 
Lancelot’s unspelling quest. If the author had before him the 
same source which he may have been following in his account 
of the Val sanz Retor, the irrelevancies of the situation are 
accounted for. The presence of Gadresclain and the unhappy 
maiden, the object of Camille’s jealousy, who are forced into 
the story, is explained, as well as Lancelot’s madness and 
Camille’s consent to his release. For after Lancelot has dis- 
pelled the enchantment of the Val sanz Retor, he falls a victim 
to the wiles of Morgain,? and escapes finally from her power 
1 See pp. 19, 20. 
2 The wiles that Morgain practices upon Lancelot are commonplace, and are not 
paralleled elsewhere in her history. We are constrained to regard them as simple 
padding, used by the author as an easy way to round out his narrative and give 
greater proportions to the theme of Lancelot’s love for the queen. 
When Morgain has Lancelot conveyed to her dwelling in the forest after he 
has performed the adventure of the valley, her intention is to gratify the hatred 
that she has cherished for Guinevere and Arthur ever since her separation by the 
queen from her cousin, whom Morgain loved. She promises to release Lancelot 
from his captivity provided he give her a certain ring that Guinevere had given to 
him, which closely resembles one that Morgain herself owns. Finding that all 
her efforts to persuade him to give it up are vain, she allows him to go to the 
adventure of the Tour Douleureuse, on condition that he return to her when his 
task is accomplished. With him she sends one of her maidens as a guide. As 
they fare on their way, the maiden tries to arouse Lancelot’s love, but her blan- 
dishments are all alike unavailing. When at last by her persistent forcing of her 
seductions upon him, he is compelled to threaten her with his sword, she confesses 
that she has done all at the command of her mistress. Thus peace is made; 
Lancelot performs his adventure, and returns to Morgain. The fay renews her 
attack upon the ring by giving Lancelot a soporific draught, and while he sleeps 
exchanging her ring for the queen’s (cf. Morgain’s exchange of a false sword for 
Excalibur, above, p. 14). Then she sends one of her damsels to court with a 
trumped-up story that shall betray Guinevere’s love for Lancelot, in proof. of 
which the damsel is to produce the ring. The plan is a dismal failure, for the 
queen defends herself, and nobody believes the story. Lionel goes forth in search 
of Lancelot. He meets a maiden who offers to be his guide. On the way he 
climbs a tree to view the landscape o’er, and espies Lancelot being led by armed 
sergeants from a court into a fair meadow. Lionel descends to tell the news, but 
neither he nor his friends can ever again find the tree (cf. p. 87). Morgain, 
meanwhile, persists in harassing Lancelot. By means of a spiced potion she
-P-A-G-E-111
The Val sanz Retor 99 
only by promising her that he will absent himself from court 
fora year. Overcome by the nature of his promise, which cuts 
him off from all chance of seeing Guinevere, his reason gives 
way, he wanders about in madness in the forest, and but for 
the Dame du Lac’s kindly care, he would have remained the 
hopeless victim of frenzy. 
The author is simply applying an episode twice to the same 
hero,! but in the story of Camille he varies with common- 
place details what he probably knew first as an other-world 
situation. 
Morgain’s part in the episode of the Val sanz Retor is cer- 
tainly not conspicuous, although she is the creator of the valley. 
She is simply the enchantress who has bespelled the region. 
Any other powerful fay would serve the purpose just as well 
as she. But in so far as the test for loyal love is applied to 
Lancelot by Morgain’s agency, we are dealing with material 
that might have been attached to the Morgain saga at any 
time after the stories of her hostility to Guinevere and of 
Lancelot’s love for Guinevere were established. 
How then are we to regard the induction to the episode ? 
There are two forms, as our summary has told us. The earlier 
of the two is doubtless that given in the prose Lancelot. In 
the early story of Arthur and Morgain that I have postulated, 
we have seen that the mortal wife interferes with the love 
of the hero and the fay. Quite probably this same theme is 
elaborated in the Lancelot into the story of the mortal damsel of 
whom the fay is justly jealous, and is used as a suitable intro- 
duction to the narrative, the conclusion of which sounds the 
praises of the true lover. There is an episode that tells of a 
fair maiden who suffered enchantment at the hands of Mor- 
gain and the Queen of Norgalles because they were jealous of 
causes him to dream that the queen has given her love to a certain young knight, 
against whom he would have drawn his sword but for the queen’s interfering 
word. Morgain lays his sword beside him, so that when he wakes he may be fully 
convinced of the reality of his dream (cf. Perceval, 1,7; for deceptions in sleep 
see below, p. 208, note). In despair he wins his release by promising to shun 
for a year the king, as well as the knights and ladies of the court. For the 
sequel see below, p. 196; see also Léseth, § 41.

her beauty.!_ There is no means of knowing the exact relation 
of these two stories to each other, but, if we accept the hypo- 
thetical original, we may reasonably suppose that the theme of 
the enchanted lady suggested here the special punishment of 
Morgain’s unhappy rival. 
In the treatment of this maiden we have again a parallel to 
Court of Love material. Andreas Capellanus describes a pun- 
ishment inflicted by the God of Love upon mortals who are 
1 See Malory, Bk. XI, ch. 1 :— When Lancelot arrives at the castle of Corbin 
he is hailed as the deliverer of the lady within the tower, who “ever boileth in 
scalding water,” and whom Gawain has failed to deliver. The iron doors of the 
chamber where she is imprisoned unbolt for him; “so Sir Lancelot went into the 
chamber that was as hot as any stew and took the lady by the hand.” She had 
been given her punishment by enchantment of Queen Morgan le Fay and the 
queen of Northgalis, because she was called the fairest lady of the country, and 
she had been in the tower for five years. The prose Lancelot also gives the 
story of Lancelot’s rescue of the maiden, though without mention of Morgain 
(see Malory, III, 191 ; cf. Lancelot, vv. 3593 ff.). The account of Gawain’s effort 
to rescue the maiden is found in Paris, R. 7. R., V, 256, 306: — Gawain arrives 
at a fair castle, from within which he hears the piercing cries of a woman; he 
enters, and finds in a marble tank a damsel standing up to her waist in boiling 
water. She entreats him to lift her out, but his efforts to do so are in vain, and 
she tells him that she must suffer there till the best knight in the world comes to 
deliver her; her punishment for a former sin is not yet great enough. Sommer 
(Malory, UI, 192) shows that the minor inconsistencies and discrepancies in the 
first two of the passages mentioned above indicate that they are derived from a 
common French source. 
This French source, or one kindred to it, is evidently responsible, directly or 
indirectly, for Morgain’s part in Pu/ze//a Gaia, an Italian poem belonging probably 
to the fourteenth century, and representing, so far as I know, the only independent 
treatment of Morgain material preserved to us in mediaeval Italian literature. 
Pulzella Gaia is Morgain’s beautiful daughter (cf. Zavola Ritonda; 1, 295, 300, 
487), the fairy love of Gawain, who, by complying with her demand that he tell 
her his name, has unspelled her from serpent shape. She promises to grant his 
every wish provided he does not reveal their love; but on his boasting of her ata 
tourney at court, she is compelled to surrender herself to /a savia Morgana, who 
imprisons her in a tower, where she must stand waist-high in water, and suffer 
transformation into fish-shape below the waist. Gawain sets out in quest of her, 
forces his way into Pela Orso, Morgain’s castle where Pulzella Gaia is impris- 
oned, draws the maiden from the water, puts Morgain in her place, and with his 
love, transformed, let us hope, from her fishy estate, rides merrily off to Camelot. 
The lady of the prose versions, who in consequence of Morgain’s wrath stands 
waist-high in boiling water, the victim of a magic spell that Gawain seeks in vain 
to break, is certainly in a similar predicament to that of Pulzella Gaia. (For con- | 
finement in a red-hot iron chamber as a punishment, see Mabinogion, III, 112 ff.) 
The transformation to mermaid shape may possibly have been induced by the 
story of the fay Melusine, whose mother inflicts substantially the same penalty

  The Val sanz Retor IOI 
not his worthy subjects,! which is very like that bestowed by 
Morgain upon the maiden who unwisely returned Guiomar’s 
love. Within the domains of the God of Love, according to 
Andreas, there is a meadow arranged in concentric circles. In 
one circle, flooded with intensely cold water and beaten upon 
by the rays of the burning sun, those women who have loved 
without discrimination must abide after death.2 Since Mor- 
gain’s punishment has the allegorical tone characteristic of the 
Court of Love material, and not of Celtic tradition, it seems 
likely that here we have an illustration of the way in which 
themes of all kinds are used by the romancer, and an evidence 
that his work is not to be characterized as Celtic in every 
detail.* K 
Before leaving this part of the story, we may recall to 
mind that transformation by enchantment is one of the means 
employed by the Morrigan to avenge a personal affront. This 
the milkmaid Odras is said to have learned to her sorrow. 
She went in pursuit of a cow that the Morrigan had taken to 
her own domains. “Still on fared Odras, in the track of her 
cow, towards the elf-mound of Cruachu. Sleep fell upon her 
in the Oakwood of Falga, and the Morrigan awoke her and 
upon her (see Couldrette, AMellusine, Le Livre de Lusignan, ed. Michel, Niort, 
1854, vv. 2940-3186, 3835-4228). 
In a modern Breton folk-tale we find practically the story of Pulzella Gaia 
told of a daughter of a Margot-la-Fée. This unfortunate daughter is meta- 
morphosed into a snake on a certain day in the year. The Margot-la-Fée, her 
mother, entreats a peasant to go to a designated point on the road, at which he will 
find a snake which she bids him cover with a basin. To clinch matters he sits 
down on the basin when he has done her bidding, and remains seated all day. In 
the evening he raises the basin, and finds the most beautiful maiden in the world, 
who is willing to give him a rich reward (see Sébillot, Zrad. et Sup. de la 
#. Bretagne, I, 109). I have met no other tradition told of both Morgain la Fée 
and a Margot-la-Fée; but, although belonging to an ordinary type of incident, 
this example adds a trifling weight to the probability that the Margot-la-Fées 
and Morgain are connected, and that a common story of Morgain’s bespelled 
daughter whom a knight released is at the foundation of the Italian poem and 
the Breton folk-tale of to-day.

hagen, 1892, pp. tor ff.

3 An other-world plain is described in the Tochmarc Emire (see Rev. Celt., X1, 
1890, 447), on one half of which men freeze fast, while on the other they are 
raised on the grass. But this cannot be called a parallel tradition to that of the 
maiden in the valley.

sang spells over hér, and made of Odras a pool of water which 
entered the river that flows to the west of Slieve Bawne (the 
Shannon).” ! 
The Livre d’Artus, P. connects the foundation of the valley 
with Morgain’s love for Guiomar.? In this respect, according 
to Freymond,’ it offers material that lies nearer the original 
than does the Lamce/oé, in that the theme appears of the mortal, 
Guiomar, retained by the fay in her domain. It is well, how- 
ever, to observe how the author of the Livre d’ Artus, P. treats 
his sources. In the Lancelot, the object of the special adven- 
ture upon which Lancelot is engaged at the time when he went 
on his excursion into the Val sanz Retor is the release of 
Gawain from the Tour Douloureuse. The episode of the Val 
sanz Retor is merely incidental to this. The knight who can 
put an end to the enchantment of Ascalon le Tenebreus* is he 
who will accomplish the adventure of the Tour Douloureuse. 
The knight who can perform the adventure of lifting from a 
certain river the bodies of two guiltless lovers who have been 
drowned there, is he who will be able to rescue Gawain from 
the Tour Douloureuse.® In the Livre d’ Artus, P. it is said that 
only he can break the spell of the Val sanz Retor who has suc- 
cessfully accomplished the adventure of Ascalon le Tenebreus ; 
and he who cannot perform the adventure of the valley will not 
succeed in taking from the water the bodies of the two guiltless 
lovers, nor in accomplishing the adventure of the Tour Doulou- 
reuse. In other words, in the Livre d’ Artus, P. we have a chain 
formed from episodes that stand in comparatively unconnected 
sequence in the Lancelot. In the Lancelot also, these adven- 
tures are related in full; in the Lzvre d’Artus, P. that of lift- 
ing from the water the bodies of the guiltless lovers is merely 
mentioned, although the other adventures are given at some

arts learned from Merlin, cf. the account of the beautiful valleys surrounded by 
an invisible, impassable wall built by Manannan mac Lir for the Tuatha dé

length. Neither does the Livre d’Artus, FE. like the Lancelot 
relate a tale of the attempted achievement of the adventures 
by Galeschin and Yvain. Evidently the author of the Livre 
@’ Artus, P.is connecting parts disconnected in his source. He 
is modelling his material, we know, on both the Lancelot and 
the Merlin,! and in telling the story of Guiomar with the Val 
sanz Retor as a sequel he may be simply combining two sto- 
ries, and identifying the Val sanz Retor with the other world, 
Avalon, where Guiomar dwelt with Morgain and ruled as lord. 
At all events we may say with confidence that if at one stage 
the story told of Morgain and Guiomar represented her as tak- 
ing her lover back to the other world, there was not connected 
with it, unless as a late addition, an unspelling quest performed 
by a faithful lover. The fay does not properly take her lover 
to the other world to await the coming of a knight who shall 
break a spell that holds him there ; she takes him there for an 
unending life of delight, or as the maintainer of her “ custom.” 
In either case there is no convenient place for a mortal amze. 
It is owing to a combining of several elements by the author 
that we have the episode of the Val sanz Retor, which is valu- 
able in the present study not because of light that it casts upon 
early conditions, but because it represents Morgain distinctly 
as an other-world queen, vindictive and jealous, although with 
very little personality in the episode itself.”

CHAPTER VIII 
MORGAIN IN THE HORN AND MANTLE TESTS 
Moreain had other means for testing the fidelity of mortals 
beside a mist-enclosed valley. Discriminating objects that 
detect in mortals the presence or absence of certain graces are 
commonplace in folk-lore.1 For the mediaeval story-teller a 
ring, a shield, a glove, a bridge, a girdle, a mirror, or, what 
you will, served almost indifferently as the residence of the 
same magic power. All alike may be able to discern one 
special virtue or failing. Among the enchanted objects that 
are potent as fidelity tests in romantic material, the two 
that appear perhaps more often than any others are the Cor 
enchanté and the Manteau mautatllé, the virtue of both of 
which Morgain occasionally uses to effect a malicious pur- 
pose. Obviously it would be almost impossible to find the 
stories dealing with one of such similar tests uninfluenced 
by those told of the other, and in the great variety of ver- 
sions and the multiplicity of. correspondences between those 
of either class, fruitless perplexities attend an effort to untwine 
one wholly from the other. An elaborate examination of the 
two tests and of the versions in which they are embodied 
has been made by Warnatsch.2 His results greatly facilitate 
a study of Morgain’s part, to which he gives only a cursory 
notice; and his conclusions are in the main simply to be 
extended in determining the position in the Morgain saga 
occupied by the episodes that bring her into connection with 
these widely diffused themes. Two Italian texts* omitted by

Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests 105 
Warnatsch should be included among those versions in which 
Morgain has a place. It is with the horn test that she is the 
more frequently associated ; in fact there is only one version 
of the mantle test in which she appears, whereas six repre- 
sent her as the owner of the dangerous horn. Of these lat- 
ter the two typical sources are the French prose 7yistan and 
Malory. 
Tristan* The knights Lamorat and Driant, faring on their way, meet a 
knight under orders to bear to Arthur’s court an enchanted ivory horn, from 
which only a faithful wife can drink without splashing the wine. He refuses 
to tell the name of the sender, but after Lamorat has unhorsed him, he admits 
that it comes from Morgain, whose object in sending it is to force Guinevere 
into a betrayal of her love for Lancelot. Lamorat who wishes to make 
trouble for King Mark sends the knight with the horn to him.  Iseult and 
the other ladies of the court are subjected to the test, and all but four spill 
the wine. Iseult with protestations of her innocence suggests that a knight 
break a lance in her defence, but Mark rejects the idea. He and his barons 
hush the matter up, and decide that the test is worthless. 
Malory Here again, Sir Lamorat and Sir Driant meet a knight sent by 
Morgain to Arthur; “and this knyght hadde a fayre horne harnest with 
gold.” The description of the virtue of the horn and also Morgain’s object 
in sending it to court agree with those in the other accounts. “And by force 
sire Lamorak made that knyghte to telle alle the cause why he bare that 
horne | Now shalte thou bere this horn sayd Lamorak ynto kyng Marke 
or els chese thou to dye for it.” The knight bears it to Mark and tells him 
of its peculiar quality. “Thenne the kynge maade Quene Isoud to drynke 
therof | and an honderd ladyes | and there were but four ladyes of alle tho 
that dranke clene | Allas saide kynge Marke this is a grete despyte | and 
sware a grete othe | that she sholde be brente and the other ladyes | 
Thenne the Barons gadred them to gyder and said playnly they wold not 
haue tho ladyes brente for an horne maade by sorcery that came from 
as fals a sorceresse and wytche as tho was lyuynge | For that horne dyd 
neuer good but caused stryf and debate | and alweyes in her dayes she 
had ben an enemy to alle true louers | Soo there were many knyghtes 
made their auowe | and euer they met with Morgan le fay that they wold 
shewe her short curtosye.”’ * 
1 Loseth, § 47. 2 Bk. VIII, ch. 34. 
8 The same story is told with certain differences in the Italian Zristano 
(pp. 153 ff.), and also in the Zavola Ritonda (I, 157 ff.). These Italian versions 
differ from that of the French 77is¢az in the following particulars : — 
1., Driant is not mentioned. 
2. The horn is the most beautiful in the world, made of silver, harnessed with 
gold, according to 7ristan: made of ivory chased with gold and silver, in the 
Tavola Ritonda. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
106 Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests 
The episode is obviously composed of two strata, and either 
the introduction telling of Morgain’s gift and its malign intent 
is prefixed to an independent story of a test of Iseult at Mark’s 
court, or a conclusion relating the sequel to Morgain’s scheme 
against Guinevere is attached to characters of greater promi- 
nence in the Tristan romances than are Guinevere and Lance- 
lot. That the latter is the correct view to take of the situation 
is evident from a comparison with the earliest bit of literature 
that we possess embodying the horn theme. This, as is well 
known, is the Laz du Cor of Robert Biquet, which according 
to its editor, Wulff, should be dated probably no later than the 
3. In Zavola Ritonda the bearer is named Tramondo Ughiere. 
4. In Tristano, there are two contests between Amoratto (Lamorat) and the 
bearer of the horn; the first agrees with that in the Zyistan, the second is 
intended to force the knight to carry the horn wherever Amoratto bids him. 
In Zavola Ritonda only this second contest is mentioned. 
5. Isolda and [in Zyistano] three hundred and sixty-five ladies [in Zavola 
Ritonda six hundred and eighty-six] are subjected to the test; all but [in Zris- 
tano| two [in Tavola Ritonda thirteen] are found guilty. 
6. Mark commands that all the guilty be burnt at the stake. 
7. Mark revokes his decision on the declaration of [in 7ristano] a baron of 
Cornovaglia that the adventures (sic) of Logres are not worthy of serious consid- 
eration, and that his own wife is innocent; [in Zavola Ritonda] Dinasso the 
seneschal, that the enchantments of Logres deserve contempt. 
While in Malory and Tristan two knights — Lamorat and Driant — encounter 
the bearer of the horn [in 7+istano and Tavola Ritonda, Lamorat alone], and four 
ladies are found innocent [in Zristano, two, Tavola Ritonda, thirteen], it is only 
in these insignificant details that Ma/ory agrees with 7yistan where the latter differs 
from Tristano and Tavola Ritonda. In the following points Malory and Tristano 
agree, and differ from Z7ristan : — 
1. The horn is of silver (Ma/ory, fayre), harnessed with gold. In Zyistax the 
horn is of ivory. 
2. The knight takes the horn to Mark only after a second contest in Zyistano. 
There is a threat of a second contest in Ma/ory: ‘ Now shalt thou bear this horn 
unto king Mark or else choose thou to die for it.” In Z7istan, the knight obeys 
Lamorat without a word. . 
3. Mark commands that the guilty ladies be burnt; a baron in Tyistano, 
barons in Aa/ory, interfere. In 7ristan, Iseult proposes a champion; the king 
and barons by mutual consent dismiss the question. 
It is evident that all three versions are to be traced to the same source, and 
that Zristano and Malory here are derived from the same French source, which 
was not the manuscript of the 7yistan that Loseth is summarizing (cf. Malory, 
III, 286). The version of the Zuvola Ritonda is undoubtedly derived from the 
Tristano from which, though it differs slightly, it shows no divergences that can- 
not be accounted for by the characteristic freedom of its compiler in handling 
his material. 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests 107 
middle of the twelfth century, and which shows clearly more 
primitive features than any other existing version.1 
The scene is laid at a brilliant Pentecostal feast at Arthur’s court. A 
fair youth enters the hall bearing a magic horn of ivory, which he presents 
to Arthur as a friendly gift from the king of Moraine. The horn has been so 
enchanted by a fay that no man whose wife has been untrue to him even 
in thought may drink from it without splashing his breast with the wine 
that it contains. The king at once puts the gift to the test, calls for wine 
and drinks, but spills the liquor. He seizes a knife and is about to stab 
the queen, but Gawain, Cadain, and Iwain prevent him. The queen in dis- 
tress offers to prove her innocence by the ordeal of fire. Arthur, however, 
is determined that all shall try the horn, and when he finds that none pres- 
ent can drink without splashing and sees the queen’s blushing amazement, 
he recovers his good temper and declares that the horn is a noble gift. 
Caradoc, a valiant knight, alone drains the cup without spilling a drop. 
Femme avoit molt leal. Arthur gives him Cirencestre as a reward and 
also the horn, which is kept there on exhibition at festivals. 
Thus in the early story neither Morgain nor Iseult is men- 
tioned, and the scene is laid at Arthur’s court, the appointed 
destination for the horn in the Z7istan and kindred versions. 
But in spite of the difference in its localization, the account of 
the test at Mark’s court bears indications that the original 
from which it is derived was a working over of the story that 
we know through Biquet’s lay. The horn in this original was 
doubtless, like that in the lay, made of ivory harnessed with 
gold; the interference of the knights with the king’s move- 
ment to stab the queen had very likely become the advice of the 
barons to treat the matter lightly ; Guinevere’s offer to undergo 
the ordeal by fire probably had a place there, and appears as 
Mark’s command that Iseult and her companions in guilt be 
burned at the stake; the king’s recovery of his good humor 
develops into Mark’s sudden decision that the enchantments 
of Logres are of no account. 
Evidence that this part of the story had reached some such 
stage while it was still attached to Arthur and his queen, 
before it was incorporated in the supposed source of our ver- 
sions, is supplied by a Fastnachtspiel of the fifteenth century.”

108 Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests 
The play opens with a conjugal dialogue between Arthur and the queen, 
who are making a list of the proper guests to be invited to a feast at court. 
They have decided to summon certain crowned heads of Europe, when 
the queen suddenly remembers that they have omitted the king’s sister, the 
queen of Cyprus. Arthur, however, positively refuses to include her among 
his guests : — 
Wan sy gross wider mich han taun 
Darumb ichs nit wil laden laun.1 
The queen of Cyprus, who is well aware of all that is going on, angry at 
the insult, sends to court by one of her maidens a magic horn out of which 
only he whose wife is constant can drink without spilling the wine. Her 
own name is to be concealed from the king, and the maiden is to tell him 
merely that it comes von ainer werden kiinigin frey. The virtue of the 
horn is set forth in an inscription chased upon it. 
Arthur is the first to test the gift; he splashes his breast with the wine, 
bursts into a passion with the queen, and threatens to strike her. Weigion 
(Gawain) * remonstrates with brevity and soothes the king’s wrath. The 
guests drink in turn, and all find their wives guilty except the king of Spain, 
who is immediately presented by the king with congratulatory gifts. The 
maiden in the meantime returns to the queen of Cyprus, who fancies with 
high glee the dissension that the horn will cause at court. After the test 
is completed Ayax accuses Weigion of disloyalty to the king with the 
queen ; the two knights forthwith defy each other, break lances, and are 
separated by the king, who announces that the horn has occasioned evil 
which all had best forget in merrymaking : — 
Desgleich ir herren, tantzt mir nach all 
Und springent frélich auff mit schall.8 
1P. 191, v. 15. 2 See Warnatsch, Der Mantel, p. 67. 
3 P. 227, vv. 15,16. In the Orlando Furioso (canto xiii, st. 70-73, 97-104; 
canto xliii, st. 6-44), Warnatsch suggests, there may be preserved the same 
lost version of the story that was known to the author of the Fustnachtspiel (see 
Der Mantel, p. 89 ; cf. Child, Ballads, I, 265; Rajna, Fonti, p. 578). Here Mor- 
gain’s goblet is given to Rinaldo in an enchanted palace by a knight, who bids him 
drink as a test of his wife’s constancy. Only he who has a faithful wife can drink 
from the goblet without spilling the contents. The enchantress Melissa had pre- 
sented it to the knight with the words : — 
Io ti dard un vasello 
Fatto da ber, di virth rara e strana, 
Qual gid, per fare accorto il suo fratello 
Del fallo di Ginevra fe’ Morgana. 
(Canto xliii, st, 28.) 
This version stands nearer the original material than do the 77yistan and the allied 
sources in that men drink to test their wives, and the women are not obliged to 
convict themselves; but, although the story of the goblet and its connection with 
Rinaldo’s host is long, the reference to Morgain is too brief to allow an exact 
decision as to what source, or sources, Ariosto had before him. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests 109 
Clearly in general outline and content the Fastnachtspiel 
stands nearer the original material than do the Tristan romances. 
The resemblances, however, between the Fastnachtspiel and 
the latter indicate that they represent two redactions of the 
same ultimate French source,! that reached the author of 
the Fastnachtspiel either directly in the French or indirectly 
through a German medium. In this source the men probably 
put the horn to the proof;* the queen, like Iseult, may have 
craved a joust in her defence, which in the fifteenth-century 
text is represented by the contest that actually takes place 
between Ayax and Weigion; the story probably ended with 
the king’s careless dismissal of an unpleasant subject. 
Although Morgain does not appear elsewhere as the Queen 
of Cyprus, there can be no question that the king’s malicious 
sister who owns the marvellous horn is none other than she. 
An earlier source containing the same incident is a Meisterlied 
by Conrad von Wiirzburg.? 
The Meisterlied tells the story of a feast at Arthur’s court at which 
seven kings with their wives are the guests. They are with one exception 
the same monarchs that appear in the Fastnachtspiel. 
A maiden enters bringing an ivory horn with an inscription in golden 
letters telling of its magic properties, and presents it to the king from her 
mistress. Arthur tests it, finds that the queen is guilty, and in a fury is 
about to strike her when Yban prevents the blow. The guests try the horn, 
but the king of Spain alone is successful. Arthur gives him the horn and 
showers congratulatory gifts upon him. 
Warnatsch ‘ shows that the Mezsterlied and the Fastnachtspiel 
doubtless go back to a common Middle High German original, 
which naturally was treated by Conrad von Wiirzburg in a 
more condensed form than by the author of the Fastnachtspiel. 
But the text is unreliable at the very point where it has most 
interest for us, namely the verse that gives the name of the

8 Ob. 1287. The Meisterlied is contained in a fifteenth-century manuscript 
published by Zingerle under the title Das goldene Horn in Pfeiffer’s Germania, V 
(1860), 101 ff. A somewhat different text with the title Dis ist frauw tristerat 
horn von Saphoien is published by Bruns, Beitrdge zur kritischen Bearbeitung 
alter Handschriften, Brunswick, 1802, pp. 139 ff.

sender of the horn. That of the so-called Wilten manuscript 
published by Zingerle is unintelligible : — 
Euch santz mein frauw in der . . . aus der Syrneyer lant. 
The last two words Zingerle amends to Syrenen lant. The 
text of the Hamburg manuscript published by Bruns, which 
is evidently the work of a second redactor,! reads : — 
Es schickt uch schon frau tristerat 
her uss von Saphoer lant. 
Frau Tristerat is an altogether obscure personage. Her 
home, however, Saphoer lant, brings to mind the province of 
Lorraine, Savoie, which we know during the eleventh century 
was identified with the neighboring district of Maurienne,? 
an early name for which was Morienna.’ This is suggestively 
like Moraine, the name of the country from which the horn 
came according to Biquet’s Zaz; with this name, moreover, 
Morgain is indirectly associated, for it is the form used by 
Lazamon for Moray, the territory in Scotland assigned by the 
early sources to Urien, Morgain’s husband. Hence, despite 
the danger of a conjecture resting on a conjectural basis, we 
are not entirely without reason for suspecting that in the 
source from which both Mezsterlied and Fastnachtspiel are 
derived the horn came from Moraine and that the sender 
was Morgain, who possibly from a lack of familiarity with her 
name on the redactor’s part disappears entirely in Conrad’s 
poem, and in the Fastnachtspiel is given a new name, just 
as the crowned heads of Europe take the place of the early 
knights of Arthur’s court. 
Why Cyprus should be selected as the land over seas of 
which the fay was queen is not altogether clear. Warnatsch 
thinks that a confusion between Morgain and Melusine may 
account for it :— “ Die Verwandlung der Fee Morgane in eine

Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests IIl 
Kénigin von Zypern beruht wol auf einer Verwechslung mit 
der (in Deutschland besonders durch das Volksbuch des Thiir- 
ing von Ringoltingen) bekannten Fee Melusine, deren Sage in 
dem frz. Hause Lusignan (in Cypern nach der Eroberung 
durch Richard Loéwenherz herrschend) heimisch war.”’! But 
Melusine and Morgain are very unlike in their histories and 
attributes, and the probability of such a confusion may be ques- 
tioned. In the Mezsterlied, after Arthur receives the horn, we 
read according to Zingerle, 
Kiinig Artus hies schenken ein den klaren zyper wein ;? 
according to Bruns, 
Konig Artus hiess es schencken vol 
Des claren zyppar wine.* 
Wine from Cyprus as a royal beverage requires no explana- 
tion, and who shall say that it was not this feature in the 
original that influenced the author of the Fastnachtspiel to 
make the distant homie of the lady of the seat who owned 
the magic drinking horn, the far-away island of Cyprus, from 
which the wine came? 
How did Morgain come to be connected with the story? 
As we have seen, she does not figure in the Laz du Cor. The 
bearer of the horn according to Biquet presents his wonderful 
gift to the king with these words: — 
De Moraine li reis 
‘ qui proz est e corteis 
vos enveie cest cor 
qu’il prist en son tresor.> 
Round the horn runs an inscription in letters of gold and 
Suelo Co vos mande Mangons ® 
de Moraine, li blons.” 
The name of Saint Mungo (ie. Kentigern) of Glasgow 
appears as Mangon in asseverations in Guillaume le Clerc’s 
romance of Fergus,*but this gives us no assistance in identifying

the owner of the horn. Of Mangon, Wulff says, “ce nom .. . 
rappelle Morgue, Morgain (méchante fée, sceur d’ Artu).”1 It 
recalls, too, and more forcibly perhaps, the name of the famous 
Celtic enchanter, Mongan, whose history is contained in the 
Lebor na h-Uidre,2 and about whom stories at least as old 
as the eighth century exist.2 He is noted for his power 
of shifting his own shape as well as of transforming that of 
others. He possesses the resources of rich fairy knolls,> 
and is generously disposed in sending gifts to kings.® He is 
the son of Manannan mac Lir, god of the sea, who visited his 
mother in the absence of her husband, Fiachna Lurga, king 
of Ulster, and when Mongan was three nights old took him 
away to the Land of Promise, where he kept him under his 
tutelage until he was a lad sixteen years of age? In the Land 
of Promise Manannan had in his possession a magic drinking- 
vessel, a touchstone for truthfulness. This we know through 
an allusion to Manannan’s cup in the Ozded mac n Uisnig 
(Death of the Sons of Usnach),® and also through the Zchtra 
Cormaic (Adventures of Cormac), a tale preserved in the Book 
of Ballymote and the Yellow Book of Lecan, which tells of 
Cormac’s summons to the other world by Manannan. Here, 
among other striking experiences, he saw that “a cup of gold 
was placed in the warrior’s hand. Cormac was marvelling at 
the cup, for the number of forms upon it and the strangeness 
of its workmanship. ‘There is somewhat in it still more 
strange,’ says the warrior. ‘Let three words of falsehood be 
spoken under it, and it will break into three. Then let three 
true declarations be under it, and it unites again as it was 
before.’’’ When Cormac left the Land of Promise, Manannan

gave him the marvellous cup, but at his death took it back 
into his own possession.! 
In the extant versions of the horn test, either the owner 
of the magic horn is not mentioned, as in the Livre de Caradoc 
preserved in the Perceval? and also in Renard le Contrefait, 
or its possessor is said to be Morgain or Mangon, as in 
the versions cited above, or according to Diu Créne,* a sea- 
king. Heinrich von dem Tiirlin, as Warnatsch shows,® was 
probably not using the Laz du Cor as a source, but a version 
akin to it. The horn, he tells us, was the work of a magician 
of Toledo, and was brought to Arthur by a dwarf covered with 
scales, riding on a monster of the sea. He presents his gift 
with the words : — 
Dar umbe hat mich her gesant 
Uz dem mer kiinec Priure.® 
Although Heinrich is using material extraneous to the lay, 
there is here a confirmation of the theory that Mangon, the 
owner of the horn, is only a distortion of Mongan, whose 
original nature as the son of the sea-god was not forgotten 
in Heinrich’s source, which attributed the possession of the 
horn to a sea-king. There is a logical fitness in the situation 
that our versions give us, if we regard it as the development 
from such an origin. Mongan, by right of his sonship to 
Manannan, might very properly become in story the owner 
of the marvellous drinking-vessel that could be used as a test 
of faith.? A mediaeval horn frequently did duty as a goblet, 
and furthermore since by virtue of his connection with the sea, 
11d., III, i, 215. Cf. a later text translated by O’Grady, Trans. Oss. Soc., III, 
227. A false story told before the cup breaks it into four bits; a true story welds 
them together again. Cf. also Stokes and Windisch, III, i, 209, for the crystal 
vessel of Badurn, made in a fairy mound, which separates into three parts if three 
lies are uttered under it, and reunites for three truths.

  114 Morgain in the Horn and. Mantle Tests 
Mongan, or Manannan, like old Triton, might justly be regarded 
as having a ‘“wreathed horn,” it would be appropriate, and 
not at all strange, if this goblet in some versions became a 
drinking horn. 
A confusion between the names of the shape-shifter Mon- 
gan! and the fay Morgain (Morgan) is undeniably one of the 
easiest conceivable blunders in either an oral or a written 
source. There is indirect evidence that such a confusion may 
have taken place at a time previous to the composition of 
Biquet’s lay, and that this confusion is responsible for more 
than one story that has become attached to the fay’s name. 
If we turn from the Irish tale of Mongan’s youth and 
upbringing to the altogether unique account of Morgain’s 
early days contained in the Awdevon, known as the Prologue 
to Huon de Bordeaux and undoubtedly written later than the 
poem to which it contains the introductory material, we find 
a striking similarity in the two histories.” 
Morgain, the sister of Arthur, was stolen in her infancy by a fairy king, 
a wise master of all enchantment, who kept her for ten years in his domains 
and taught her his arts. He owned a magic horn, which he gave to Mor- 
gain at his death, and which became a valuable part of her dower, greatly 
coveted for Julius Caesar by his doting parents, who represent to their son 
that the ownership of the horn is a special advantage attendant upon his 
marriage with the maiden. One of Julius Caesar’s valued possessions also 
is a goblet that he had received from his mother, Brunehaut, a queen in 
fairyland, which eventually comes into the hands of Auberon, who receives 
the famous horn as well from his mother, Morgain. 
The poem in itself is so late as to be unreliable as a 
source for primitive tradition, but a further examination of 
1 Mongan’s shape-shifting was one of his most familiar characteristics. See 
Zs. f. celt. Phil., 11 (1898-1899), 318. In the so-called Fragmentary Annals 
(published without assignment of date, Silva Gadelica, I, 390 ff., translated 
II, 425), we have a euhemeristic description of the enchanter: “Certain dealers 
in antiquarian fables do propound him to have been son to Manannan, and 
wont to enter at his pleasure into divers shapes, yet this we may not credit: 
rather choosing to take Mongan for one that was but a man of surpassing knowl- 
edge, and gifted with an intelligence clear and subtle and keen.” For Morgain’s 
power of shape-shifting emphasized in our earliest accounts of her, cf. pp. 8, 151. 
2 See Auberon, vv. 1211-1235, 1319-1342, 1451-1498, 2147. The Axderon is

and is dated by its editor Graf tentatively after 1230; see Auderon, p. iv. Cf.

-P-A-G-E-127
Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests 115 
the material at our disposal shows that this story of Morgain 
may not be dismissed without hesitation as simply the result 
of a late romancer’s fancy. Morgain’s horn in the Awberon 
is not a drinking-vessel. It can be heard when sounded by 
all the vassals of the owner wherever they may be, and with 
it twenty thousand armed warriors may be instantaneously 
summoned The goblet, when it is touched by the owner, 
will be filled with a limitless amount of wine.? Neither is 
said to have any power in discerning moral qualities. Fora 
more primitive description we must turn to the Huon de Bor- 
deaux. Here we learn that Auberon, /e petit roi faé, the child 
of Morgain, owns a magic horn of ivory, the sound of which 
is potent when the horn is blown by Huon, because he is 
a preudhomme ;* he has a golden goblet which he can fill with 
wine by making a circle thrice about it and the sign of the 
cross over it, but which loses its magic properties when not 
in the hands of a prewdhomme, or of a man who is absolutely 
truthful.$ 
If we put side by side the description of the magic horn or 
goblet used in the versions of the horn test, the earliest of 
which assigns it to Mangon, and that of Auberon’s magic horn 
and goblet, in spite of the differences in the uses of the horns, 
similarities come to light that are not without significance. 
We have another version of the horn test which Wamatsch 
has shown® is derived from a common original with the Laz 
du Cor. In the Livre de Caradoc, which is inserted in the 
first continuation of the Perceval,’ this version is added as a 
fitting sequel to the story of Guimer, Caradoc’s devoted wife, 
1See Paris, Rom., VII (1878), 332: “‘M. Graf a fort bien reconnu qu’il n’y a 
dans Auberon aucun élément traditionnel: c’est le simple développement, a l’aide 
d'une imagination fort pauvrement douée, des indications sur le roi de féerie 
contenues dans Huon de Bordeaux.”

who gladly underwent physical suffering in order to rescue her 
husband from the serpent that was destroying his life. Hence 
the account is told in a more condensed form than in the 
lay and moves directly to its end, namely the glorification of 
Caradoc and his wife. Neither the sender of the horn nor 
its origin is mentioned. Details, however, not contained in 
the lay are given here, notably for our purposes, the power 
that the horn is said to possess of turning water into wine. 
Comparing then these four sources, Biquet’s lay, the Livre 
de Caradoc, Huon de Bordeaux, and Auberon, we find verbal 
similarities in the description of the appearance of the horn :1— 
Lai du Cor, vv. 33-36. 
En sa main tient un cor 
a quatre bendes d’or 
Li cors esteit d’ivoire 
entailliez de trifoire.

D'ivoire & .IIII. bendes d’or,

Moult cléres et moult vertuouses. 
Huon de Bordeaux, wv. 3229, 3230. 
Et ot au col .I. cor d’ivoire cler; 
A bendes d’or estoit li cors bendés. 
(CE. vv. 3359 3369; 3795, 3714, 3831, 4039.) 
Auberon, vv. 1221-1225. 
-I. cor avoit qui doit estre chieris, 
D’iuoire ert fais, blans est con flours de lis, 
Bendes est d’or triphones et polis ; 
Bien uaut li cors l’auoir de .IIII. cis, 
Car il est tex qu’estre ne puet pieris. 
Auberon, vv. 1319, 1320. 
Son cor ares qui est d’iuoire cler, 
Et de fin or trifonies et bendes. 
Furthermore, both the horn of Mangon and that of Auberon 
are the work of fays, who have given them a destinée.2 The

horn in the lay is adorned with marvellously sweet fairy bells 31 
the sound of Auberon’s horn induces the hearer to forget 
discomfort.2 When Mangon’s messenger sounds the horn in 
Arthur’s court, the hearers lose their self-control, the servitors 
stand immovable, the seneschals totter and stumble, he who 
is cutting bread cuts his finger instead of the loaf. The sound 
of Auberon’s horn also forces the hearers to act contrary to 
their will. A touch of the finger arouses the virtue of the 
horn in the Laz, of Auberon’s horn, and of Morgain’s goblet 
in the Auberon.4 In the Perceval water that is poured into 
the magic horn becomes wine of which there is enough to 
satisfy the thirst of all present, however many they may be; 
Auberon by a magic pass and the sign of the cross can fill 
his goblet with wine sufficient for all the living and all the 
dead. Moreover Auberon’s goblet serves the same purpose 
as King Mangon’s horn, namely, to test the loyalty of the 
drinker. Auberon gives it to Huon promising that if he 
can drink from it, the goblet shall be his; Huon drinks, and 
Auberon at once pronounces him preudhomme.® 
Hues, biau frere, dist Auberons li ber, 
Si m’ait Dix, preudhomme t’ai trové.” 
Huon himself employs it to try the faith of his uncle, Oedon,® 
and of the Saracen, Gaudise,® and this same goblet at Auberon’s 
instigation passes from hand to hand at a feast at court to test 
the honor of the emperor and his barons.”

118 Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests 
These parallels might be explained perhaps as the result 
of convention, which uses stereotyped phrases in the descrip- 
tion of similar objects,! and ascribes well known resemblances 
in the power of enchantment to the handiwork of fays or magi- 
cians. But it may also be said that they show the horn and 
goblet attributed in one source to Morgain and her husband, 
and in another to their child,? to have many common attributes 
with the fidelity horn. 
We have seen reason to suspect that | at one point in story 
Mongan had a cup similar to Manannan’s, and that this cup 
became in some versions a drinking horn ;° the next step 
showed that owing to an easy confusion between Mongan and 
Morgain a horn and a drinking vessel like his may have been 
assigned to her; hence they are found also in the hands of her 
son Auberon. If tradition thus Dene personage with a 
1 Cf. for example the golden goblet described in Horn et Rimenhild (ed. 
Michel, Paris, 1845), vv. 935 ff. 
| Il ad cel jor porté une cupe d’or fin; 
Unches n’urent meillur Cesar ne Costentin: 
Triffuire ert entaillie de bon or melekin. 
Note that the bells of the horn in the lay were made in the time of Constantine 
(v. 48), and that Morgain’s horn comes into the possession of Caesar. 
2In the Auéeron it is quite obvious that the author is making his material 
go as far as possible, and is reproducing one theme as often as his temerity 
allows. The story of Brunehaut, Caesar’s mother, for example, is evidently a 
bit of patchwork, part of which is like the early life of Morgain. She owns a 
magic goblet and hauberk, which she presents on separate occasions to her son 
(vv. 1067-1079, 1329-1342), and a bow, which she presents to Auberon (vv. 2395- 
2405). With these scenes and that in which Morgain gives her horn to her son, 
we have in the Auderon four presentations of magic gifts by fays to their descend- 
ants. Both the bow and the hauberk resemble enchanted objects in Auberon’s 
possession in the Huon de Bordeaux (cf. Auberon, Vv. 2395-2402 with Huon, 
wv. 3241-3243; cf. Auberon, vv. 1067-1074 with p. 128 below), and it is evident that 
in the Awderon the author is simply distributing among several personages the 
belongings of one in the earlier poem; but that he is doing this entirely on his 
own authority is scarcely a probable assumption, since the resemblances that we 
have observed indicate 4 stage in tradition when the goblet as well as the horn 
may have been assigned to Morgain. 
8 The Celtic origin of the fidelity horn in the lay is emphasized by Rhfs’s 
theory that the name Bonoec, given to the horn in the Livre de Caradoc, is derived 
from the Welsh word éannog, which appears in the name of two fabulous oxen, 
Ychen Bannog, associated with the district about Llandewi in Cardigan. See 
Celtic Folklore, Oxford, 1901, p. 695, note on pp. 579 580. See Rom., XXVIII 
(1899), 229, note 2.

Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests 119 
Benjamin’s portion of drinking vessels, there might naturally be 
substituted for the horn’s magic qualities in such a capacity 
those that it exhibited when sounded.! In the Laz du Cor, 
Mangon is king of Moraine. Mongan is associated with Ulster 
in Celtic material, especially with Rathmore of Moylinny? 
Morgain, however, is, as has been said above, the wife of Urien, 
king of Moraine. If Mangon is Mongan, in his association with 
a province of the same name as that with which Morgain is 
indirectly connected we have possible evidence that a confusion 
in the names had arisen before Biquet’s time and that Morgain 
had already become related to this theme. 
Although both the horn and mantle may be used, as they 
are in the stories of Guimer and Iblis,® for the sake of extoll- 
ing the worth of one fair lady, they may quite as well be sent 
to court by a fay with malicious designs against some one 
particularly obnoxious to her. There are only two person- 
ages about whom the interest of such a test naturally centers, 
one the constant wife, the other the lady highest in rank 
and therefore the most conspicuous of those tested ; all others 
are on one plane. Hence when a story is told about the dis- 
cerning object, it must either have for its end primarily the 
fair fame of the devoted wife, or the shame of the highest 
lady. Let tradition once establish an animosity of Morgain 
toward the queen, an easy weapon for the fay to use against 
her would be the magic horn which by a confusion of names 
may have been assigned to Morgain. 
This brings us to a point where, since we have seen a pos- 
sible reason why Morgain’s name came to be connected with 
the horn at all, we are better able to consider the value of the 
tradition contained in the Fastnachtspiel that the malicious sister 
sent the horn because of a slight that she had received. This 
theme sounds with an altogether new note in Morgain’s history.

120 Morgain in the Horn and Mantle Tests 
manuscript of no authority,! Morgain sends to court a mantle 
that will fit only the constant wife. In doing this she is actu- 
ated by hatred of the queen, whose beauty she envies, and 
of whose love for Lancelot she is jealous, since she loves 
him herself, “qui fut cause la faire conspirer sur la reine et 
toutes ses dames, telle chose dont la feste fut despartye, et par 
aventure si la reine l’eust fait semondre a celle feste, l’incon- 
venient jamais ne fust advenu.” ? | 
These are the only instances in the Morgain material where 
she is represented in the very ordinary mood of a fay who, 
piqued at some real or fancied slight of a trivial kind, visits 
the offender with dire punishment; and in both of these 
sources it is implied that the relations between Morgain and 
the court had previously been ruffled. Morgain’s hatred of 
the king and queen rests, we may feel assured, upon the 
deeper ground that we have seen existed, — nothing less than 
the interference with the course of her love for a mortal 
which had a place in early material. As soon as the love 
between the queen and Lancelot had become an established 
fact in romance,* Morgain’s hatred would inevitably be repre- 
sented as seeking ways to wound Guinevere in this ‘her most 
vulnerable point, and by no means more effectively than by. 
the magic horn. So that while we may regard Morgain’s con- 
nection with the horn as early, and even her use of it against 
the queen as possibly a story of no ate date engendered by 
the queen’s separation of her from her lover (Arthur, Guio- 
mar), the desire to reveal the love between Guinevere and 
Lancelot should be considered a later element in the material. 
The statement in the conte that Morgain loved Lancelot does 
not by any means stand alone, but is supported by the epi- 
sodes that have been discussed above, treating of Lancelot’s 
retention in the other world. There is little doubt, then, that 
the motive of the slighted fay is not indigenous to the Mor- 
gain saga, and that it is to be regarded as the importation of

indicating by its appearance in the Manteau mal taillé that 
the author of the Fastnachtspiel was not responsible for attach- 
ing it to the story. It is quite possible that the element of 
anger at omission from the feast may have entered the horn 
test through some version of the mantle test, in which the 
sender is not infrequently a fay, though never Morgain except 
in the late conte. 
Evidence that the gift to Arthur of a dangerous mantle was 
attributed to Morgain before this source is afforded by a story 
in the Huth Merlin® and Malory3 
In these versions Morgain’s hatred of Arthur has been roused by his 
having slain her lover Accalon. In Madory it is said, and in the Huth 
Merlin implied, that Morgain wishing to take vengeance upon Arthur for 
the deed sends to him a mantle of such a nature that he who first puts it on 
will fall dead. Arthur has been warned of the fatal character of the gift 
by the Dame du Lac, and by her advice insists that Morgain’s damsel shall 
be the first to wear it. The instant that she slips it over her shoulders she 
falls dead. Arthur has a pyre built and the maiden’s body burned. 
This story shows resemblances to the Conte du Mantel, 
the Manteau mal tatllé, and the version of the mantle test 
considered by Warnatsch as the earliest that we have, namely 
that contained in Ulrich von Zatzikhoven’s Lamzelet.5 In 
these sources a fay sends to court, by a varlet in the French * 
versions, by a maiden in the Lamzelet, a costly mantle which 
is either too long or too short for all the ladies assembled, 
except for her who is the faithful wife. In the Huth Merlin 
the maiden draws the mantle from a silver box; in the 
Manteau mal taillé from a velvet box with a silver lock. In 
the Huth Merlin she tells Arthur that the sender is “la plus 
vaillans damoisele et la plus biele que je sache orendroit el 
1On the confusion between the two tests cf. Child, Ballads, I, 262, note ; War- 
natsch, Der Mantel, pp. 55 ff. ; Rajna, Fonti, pp. 577 ff. Possibly in the debased 
form of the horn test that the 77istan records, according to which the women use 
the horn, there is to be seen the influence of the mantle which is put on by the 
women of the court. 2 TI, 250-253. 8 Bk. IV, ch. 15, 16. 
Ed. Wulff, Rom., XIV (1885), 358-380. The text probably dates from the 
end of the twelfth century, and is evidently based upon a version derived from a 
common source with the Lai du Cor. See Rom., XIV, 344, 355; Warnatsch, 
Der Mantel, p. 60; Child, Ballads, 1, 262, note.

elle vous a oi prisier seur tous les rois qui soient orendroit el 
monde vous envoie elle un garnement si chier et si riche que 
a painnes le porriés vous prisier.”” In the Langzelet the sender 
is a wése merminne,; in the Conte du Mantel, une pucele de 
mout lointain pais; in the Manteau mal taille, une tres haulte 
dame qui moult vous aime. In the Huth Merlin the mantle 
is “de drap de soie si biel et si riche par samblant que se 
vous le veissiés, vous ne cuidissiés mie quiil euust el monde 
si riche et si vaillant.” In Malory it is “the rychest mantel 
that euer was sene in that Courte | for it was sette as ful of 
precious stones as one myght stand by another | and there 
were the rychest stones that euer the kynge sawe.” In the 
Lanzelet the mantle is iridescent, embroidered with flowers 
and fruits. In the Conte du Mantel it is more beautiful than 
any ever seen by man, or than can be described. In the Man- 
teau mal taillé it is the most beautiful ever seen in England, 
purple and gold, embroidered with pearls, diamonds and 
rubies. In the Conte du Mantel the object of the story is to 
exalt Caradoc’s wife; in the Lamze/et the mantle is sent by the 
merminne who is his protectress to Iblis, his wife. 
It is in the termination of the story in the Huth Merlin, 
- therefore, that we find different material from any that we 
meet in the sources where the enchanted mantle is used as 
a constancy test. It is true that in a Gaelic version of the 
mantle test,! a poem contained in the Book of the Dean of Lis- 
more, a compilation of the early sixteenth century, the story 
takes a fatal turn. Conan, whose wife dons the white seam- 
less robe, when he sees that it does not fit her, immediately 
slays her with his spear. Morann Mac Main’s truth-testing 
collar produced more serious physical results than the tests 
which we have been considering, since it would close around 
the foot or hand of a false person until it had cut the member 
off.2. But these instances are scarcely to be placed with the 
fatal robe of Morgain. It has been compared with Deianira’s

and Medea’s poisoned robes,! but the lack of similar details 
forbids our seeing in the French source more than a reminder 
of these classical themes. We may with probability regard the 
version of the Huth Merlin as fashioned after a version of the 
mantle test, but given a fatal ending, perhaps because it is 
death that Morgain is seeking to avenge. For our purpose 
the episode has importance because it supplies an indication, 
as I have said, that Morgain’s name was connected with the 
mantle test before the late conte, and that she sent the robe 
in anger at the loss of her lover. Since we have seen reason 
to believe that Morgain’s connection with the horn test is 
early and rests upon an early misunderstanding, it appears 
probable that her association with the mantle is a reflection 
of the theme that made her the sender of the horn.

| 
A PERSONAGE like Auberon, to whom tradition has awarded 
Julius Caesar for a father and Morgain la fée for a mother, 
may be supposed to come justly by a composite nature. 
Auberon is not known in French literature previous to the 
Huon de Bordeaux Here he is depicted as a little king of 
faérie, who dwells in a wood that men consider perilous owing 
to his magic.power. He owns a wonderful horn and goblet, 
both of which he gives to Huon, who has to pass through the 
forest on his way to adventure, and who wins the abiding love 
of the fairy king by his nobleness and loyalty. Auberon appears 
before us first in a ré/e resembling that of the éte incommode, 
who figures in Syre Gawene and the Carle of Carelyle, the 
Chevalier a l Epée,* and two Italian canzoni of the fourteenth 
century5; he has the same power of creating illusions by

magic as Merlin and many another enchanter;! yet although 
he owes not a few of his supernatural gifts as well as his 
dwarfish stature to the destiny given him at birth by fays,? 
he ascribes his power to Jesus,? and prefers his appointed 
seat in Paradise to the joys of faérie.t Thus with his 
other-world attributes as fairy king and enchanter there is 
mingled a churchly influence,® which indicates that the mate- 
rial is not in its pure original form.6 All that is appropriate 
here is to ascertain, if possible, what significance should be 
attached to his connection with Morgain, as perhaps the 
most important, certainly the most attractive, of her reputed 
children.7 
The origin of Auberon’s name has been made the subject 
of extensive discussion, and his relation to Alberich, the dwarf 
of German legend, as well as his position in the story of 
Huon de Bordeaux, carefully examined.’ Little has been said 
discovers that the lord has the habit of beating or killing those who do not give 
implicit obedience to his orders. He who renders the required obedience is 
rewarded by valuable gifts from the host, even the hand of his daughter. Huon, 
before entering the dangerous wood whence none return, is warned that if he 
speaks to Auberon he will never leave the dwarf’s domains. In reality he learns 
that the risk for him lies in not obeying Auberon’s orders. By refusing to heed 
Auberon’s command to speak, his life is endangered, and only by compliance with 
his host's bidding that he return his greeting can Huon escape death at Auberon’s 
hands. Obedience, on the contrary, brings a rich reward (see vv. 3456, 3479-3489).

126 Morgain and Auberon 
about the parentage assigned to him in the poem.! Villemarqué? 
maintained that Auberon and a Celtic fairy king, Gwyn-Araun, 
are one and the same. ‘Gwyn-Araun est sorti comme un 
éclair d’un nuage (ab nudd), disent les traditions galloises, 
et a été nourri par Morgan, la magicienne, la reine des fées.” 
He gives no greater authority for this statement, which, in 
view of the untrustworthy character that Paris has shown ® 
belongs to Villemarqué’s further development of his theory of 
Auberon’s origin, should be dismissed from consideration. 
Auberon, however, is not an isolated figure in the pages of 
romance. In the Perceval we have the description of a Petit 
Chevalier, the defender of an other-world garden. Gaheriet, 
all unaware of the fact that he is committing a trespass, enters 
a certain magic castle, and learns to his regret that he must 
pay for his intrusion by fighting with a Petit Chevalier in the 
garden of the castle.®   Atant entre li chevaliers

Hummel, Archiv f. Studien der neueren Sp., UX, 307, 308; Voretzsch, Epische 
Studien, 1,124, 251. Paris has recently suggested a reason why Julius Caesar was 
elected to be Auberon’s father. The ancient tower of the Chateau de Mons was 
called the Tour Auberon as early as 1425. “Une tradition érudite, que des his- 
toriens modernes ont cru pouvoir défendre, attribuait (comme le fait Guichardin) 
a Jules César la premiére fondation de cette tour, et il est fort possible que ce soit 
pour cela que, dans notre poéme, Jules César est donné pour pére 4 Auberon”

  128 Morgain and Auberon 
The Petit Chevalier is the owner of a beautiful little ivory 
horn which gives a mighty blast and, like Auberon’s, compels an 
instant response from the hearers.!_ He, too, is a forest knight, 
who passes his time in the defence of a silver shield that hangs 
on atree not far from his castle walls. No knight has ever 
been able to take it from him, for none can bear it away 
unless he is not only himself gifted with knightly graces but 
also has a love who is perfectly constant to him.2,- The renown 
of the shield is so great that Arthur with the consent of the 
Petit Chevalier offers it as a prize at a tourney. Gawain, 
whose love at that time happens to be Taurée, the sister of 
the Petit Chevalier, alone is able to win and defend the shield. 
Auberon was once the proud possessor of a shining white 
hauberk,? which at the time of the story told in the Hon has 
been taken from him by the giant Orgileus, who has seized the 
castle of Dunostre where it was kept. Its qualities are almost 
identical with those of the little knight’s shield, although since 
there is no question as yet of an amze for Huon, who covets the 
hauberk, dramatic propriety makes it test the constancy of the 
wearer’s mother, not of his lady. Auberon also is practically 
the defender of his enchanted cup and horn, and will bestow 
neither of them upon the hero, until he has met the required 
cCStS:. ——

Morgain and Auberon 129 
The little knight from Gales, then, and Auberon are both 
essentially defenders of fidelity tests, which require virtue on 
the part of the wearer, and convey additional power to him who 
wins them. 
That the class of beings to which Auberon and his brother 
knights in the Perceval belong had a place in Celtic popular 
tradition is shown by a story that Giraldus Cambrensis reports 
in his /tinerarium Cambriae* as told in his time at Swansea. 
A certain worthy presbyter, Eliodorus, who (despite his future dignity) as 
a small boy was not free from the foibles of youth, once upon a time during 
his school days played truant. He scampered off to a river’s bank, and hid 
in a hollow near at hand. Here there came to him two little men (homun- 
culi duo staturae quasi pigmeae) who led him away to their home in an 
underground land, mirky but very beautiful. The little men Giraldus 
describes at some length :— “ Erant autem homines staturae minimae, sed 
pro quantitatis captu valde compositae: flavi omnes, et luxuriante capillo, 
muliebriter per humeros coma demissa. Equos habebant suae competentes 
modicitati, leporariis in quantitate conformes.*... Iuramenta eis nulla: 
nihil enim adeo ut mendacia detestabantur. Quoties de superiori hemi- 
sphaerio revertebantur, ambitiones nostras, infidelitates et inconstantias 
exspuebant. Cultus eis religionis palam nullus; veritatis solum, ut videbatur, 
amatores praecipui et cultores.” 
Having before us this testimony of Giraldus to a Celtic 
belief in certain beautiful other-world dwarfs, who hated false- 
hood and held aloof from the sins of mortals, we can under- 
stand why Auberon and the Petit Chevalier from Gales ( Wales) 
are associated with tests of truth and constancy, and why 
Auberon loves nothing so well as Jozauté. He declares to Huon, 
Je vous aim tant por vo grant loiauté 
Que plus vous aim c’omme de mere né,* 
and he informs the emperor, 
Si m’ait Dix, li rois de maisté, 
Moult aimme droit et foi et loiauté ; 
1 See Lanzelet, vv. 6197-6199, for the advantages conferred upon the wearer by 
the fidelity mantle. Cf. Perceval, vv. 31,805-31,829 with Lai du Cor, vv. 226-250.

Pour chou aim jou Huon le baceler, 
Car preudon est, et bien l’ai esprové.t 
Morgain and A: beron thus, we see, each by a separate line 
of tradition becanie endowed with a truth-testing drinking 
vessel. There is the perhaps a deeper reason for the legend 
that Morgain was AuLeron’s mother than the mere desire to 
give the dwarf a distinguished family connection. The same 
principle by which two heroes, Graelemor and Guingamor, were 
made brothers because of the similarity of their adventures,” 
may be responsible for the relationship of parent and child 
that exists between two other-world beings each possessing the 
same magic object.’ Auberon in this way would justly be made 
a fairy king. An explanation might then be necessary for the 
fact that the son of the beautiful Morgain was fetis nains 
bocerés, and hence Auberon’s tiny stature and deformity are 
accounted for by the presence of a malicious fay at his cradle.* 
It is unsatisfactory to leave the question of the relationship 
between Morgain and Auberon without looking once more at 
1 JB., vv. 10,405-10,408; cf. vv. 5386-5389; 10,247, 10,448. Desor ta loiauté, 
en fine loiauté, and similar phrases are favorite expressions of Auberon’s ; see 
vv. 3576, 3667, 3696, 3698, 3716, 3722, 10,441. 
2 See Lrec, vv. 1952-1954 ; Bel Inconnu, vv. 5424-5427. Zimmer, Zs.f. fr. SP., 
XIII (1893), 16; Lays of Graelent, etc., p. 126. Cf. also the tradition in Italian 
sources (Zavola Ritonda, ch. vi; Pulzella Gaia, st.95) that makes Morgana and 
the Dama del Lago sisters. 
8 Without entering here upon the vexed question of Auberon’s relation to 
Alberich, the dwarf of Germanic legend, I would call attention to the fact that 
none of the special attributes in Auberon which are significant in pointing out the 
possible origin of his connection with Morgain appear in Alberich in the Ortnit. 
Cf., on the Celtic element in Auberon, Paris, Rev. Germ., XVI, 384; Poémes et 
Légendes, pp. 84ff.; Stimming, Zs. f. rom. Phil. Il (1878), 610. Esclarmonde 
(pp. 64, 145) and the late prose versions of Hon make Auberon’s mother the 
Queen of the Ile Celée, the love of Florimont (see Paris, MSS. franc., III, 26, 27), 
perhaps owing to the tradition that a fairy queen was his mother; see Paris, Rev. 
Germ., XVI, 386; Huon de Bordeaux, pp. xxi ff.; Graf, Ayderon, p. xii; Hummel, 
Archiv f. St. der neueren Sp., LX, 308; Keightley, Te Fairy Mythology, London, 
1850, p. 41. In the fourteenth-century romance of Ogier le Danois, Auberon is

* Huon de Bordeaux, vv. 3500-3504, 10,389-10,393- There is not a hint of 
physical deformity in the little knights whom I have described. It is however 
unusual to find a dwarf in the romances who is not a humpback (cf. Voretzsch, 
Epische Studien, I, 125), and convention appears to have introduced the blemish 
on Auberon’s beauty as a later addition to the characteristics that belong properly 
to the truth-loving dwarfs.

the accounts of the white hauberk of Dunostre. In Huon

father, Julius Caesar. iy

At the entrance stand two men of copper each holding a flail of 
iron with which through summer’s heat and winter’s cold they 
deal unceasing blows. Not even the swift swallow can enter 
and escape death. Figures of metal wielding weapons at the 
entrance of an other-world castle occur elsewhere,? and once such 
a device is described at the gate of a castle of Morgain’s. The 
description occurs in the prose 7vistan ® in the course of a rather 
flavorless incident. Gifflet le filz Dou comes to the Castle Arés, 
and finds that his entrance is barred by a knight of metal made 
par grant soutiliece. Morgain had enchanted the castle and 
sought refuge there, when Tristan was in quest of her.‘ 
By a comparison of two other sources we find a second point 
of resemblance between Dunostre and a castle of Morgain’s. 
One of these is the romance of Fergus, written by Guillaume 
le Clerc, probably in the beginning of the thirteenth century. 
Fergus has lost his love, and is told by a dwarf that he can regain her 
only if he is sufficiently preu et sage to achieve the adventure of the marvel- 
lously radiant white shield of Dunostre, which renders the wearer invulner- 
able. The tower of Dunostre is situated on a rock beaten on all sides by 
the sea; it has but one entrance and this is guarded by an old woman (/a 
vieille mossue), who wields a flail of steel a foot and a half broad, with 
which she decapitates every knight who dares attempt the entrance to 
the tower. Further adventures await Fergus before he attains the shield.

132 Morgain and Auberon 
We cannot be sure whether this description of Dunostre 
antedates that in the won or not, and there is not sufficient 
resemblance in the versions to denote interdependence. The 
contest with the old crone has a wilder character than the 
figures of the knights of copper, and reminds us of certain 
Celtic stories in which a hero is enticed into a magic cave, 
where he has a struggle with a hag, who sometimes gives him 
a disastrous blow with a druidical club.! 
The second source of which I have spoken is the interpolated 
text of the Roman de Thebes, known as MS. S2 
A tower of Morgain’s has become the property of a devil named Astarot, 
who has assumed the form of a hideous old woman, and propounds the 
riddle of the Sphinx to all comers. Polinices and Tydeus visit the tower ; 
Tydeus knows the answer to the riddle, and thus is able to put the devil to 
death. La vieille sorci’re is said to be completely green, to have shaggy 
ears that veil her form, red eyes, nails like a lion’s claws, teeth like tusks. 
La vieille ne fu mie liee, 
Ainz fu molt laide et hericie[e].2 
In Fergus, la vieille mossue who demands a contest with 
every new comer, not being really a devil, is by so much less 
revolting than this figure, and is described more briefly. 
Desus le pont en estant voit 
Le vielle laide et hirechie.

It is always a hazardous matter to base a theory of the relation 
between sources on descriptions of objects that are common- 
place in romance. Just as Odysseus is wily and A®neas pious, 
so the magic castle and the loathly lady have certain charac- 
teristics that are practically their inevitable, or at all events 
their normal accompaniments.’ But it is noteworthy that both 
Dunostre and a castle of Morgain’s are protected by copper

knights with weapons, and that Dunostre in one version is 
guarded by a hideous old crone, and Morgain’s castle by a simi- 
lar figure in another ; moreover that this castle of Morgain’s, 
according to the description, is very like her castle Pela Orso, 
the scene of an adventure in Pudzella Gaia,! and also Avalon as 
it is depicted in the Bataille Loguifer ;* furthermore, Morgain 
herself appears in the form of a loathly lady in one source, the 
Middle English poem of Szr Gawayne and the Green Knight3 
It would be interesting to know more about the history of 
Dunostre. In Fergus it is characterized by a wonderfully bril- 
liant light, which is attributed to the white shield within its 
walls. In this respect it bears comparison with Dun-an-Oir,

regard to Morgain’s beauty. There are many examples in Celtic story of a fay’s 
assuming a revolting form in order to test a hero (see Hist. Litt, XXVI, 105; 
for further examples cf. Maynadier, as above, ch. ii). Possibly the old crone of 
Dunostre originally was a fay who followed the same practice, and was ready to 
transform herself into a beautiful damsel at the fitting deed of the knight.

Fort of the Gold, an enchanted golden city described in the 
Celtic Lay of the Great Fool (Amadan Mor), to which I have 
already had occasion to refer. The radiance from Dun-an-Oir 
shines afar : — 
°T was not long till they saw in the valley 
A city that shone like unto gold ; 
There was no colour which eye had seen 
That was not in the mansion, and many more.! 
This beautiful city is closely paralleled in French material by 
the Ile d’Or in the Bel /uconnu,? and by the magic castle, Chef 
dOire,? in Partonopeus, and may fairly be taken as a typical 
description of that other world to which the Ile d’Or, Chef 
d’Oire and Dunostre belong, even if we can trace positively no 
intimate connection between the suggestively similar names 
of these dwellings. In all of the cases we are dealing with the 
same type of abode. Each is characterized by unsurpassed 
wealth of material and color, and one description may very 
easily be changed with another without altering our conception 
of the scenes. At the same time the passages describing 
Morgain’s dwelling appear to be strung on one thread ; and 
they allow us, if we like to indulge our fancy with the possibili- 
ties of romantic narrative, to build up a story in which Morgain 
in the guise of a hag tested a hero at the entrance to her castle, 
1 Trans. Oss. Soc., V1, 173- 
2 Vv. 1859 ff. See Studies and Notes, IV, 171 ff. 
8 Vv. 786 ff.; cf. vv. 1760 ff. The author of the Partonopeus says that the 
castle was named from the river Oire on the banks of which it stood :— Zinsi 
Pai fait por go nommer | C’Oire sort ci et ciet en mer (vv. 1761, 1762). The editor 
of the poem, Crapelet (I, lix), explains Ozve as “ un grand cours d’eau,” and con- 
cludes that since Melior is the heiress of Constantinople the Oire is the Bosphorus. 
Melior, however, was not the first fay to be rationalized into a princess of Constanti- 
nople (cf. below, pp. 156-162), and the name of her dwelling may have been 
affected by a similar process. According to Paris (La Vie de Saint Alexis, ed. 
Paris and Pannier, Paris, 1872, p. 194) and Berger (Lehnwérter in der franz. 
Sprache dltester Zeit, Leipzig, 1899, pp. 201, 202) o#re, which survives in the name 
Montoire, is derived from the Latin aureus. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries 
it was used, Paris says (1. c.), only in the combination Portes oires, i.e., the Portae 
aureae of Jerusalem. The author of Partonopeus doubtless had some early form 
before him, and being unfamiliar with it sought an explanation. (On o/re cf. also 
G. Paris, Journal des Savants, 1900, p. 301, note 1.)

Morgain and Auberon 135 
which was as beautiful an abode as Avalon, easily confused or 
identified with such a brilliant place as. Dun-an-Oir, and named 
eventually Dunostre. 
One step more we may take in conjecture. An incident is 
told of Morgain in the prose romances? in which she is said to 
be the owner of a shield that she gives to Tristan when he 
lodges at her castle, bidding him bear it in Arthur’s presence 
at a tourney to which he is bound. The device of the shield 
is a knight resting his feet upon the head of a king and queen ; 
by this means Morgain intends to reveal to the king the love 
between Lancelot and Guinevere. This looks like a late devel- 
opment of the stories of the fidelity tests with which Morgain 
is connected. It possibly points to a tradition in which she, 
like the Petit Chevalier, owned a shield of the earlier type that 
would more directly betray the guilty lovers. If such a tra- 
dition did exist, it would account for the connection of Mor- 
gain’s castle, which seems to have been named Dunostre, with 
the wonderful shield of Fergus, and also for its fitting asso- 
ciation with Auberon’s hauberk after she had been made his 
mother.

Martin, Fergus, p. xx.

CHAPTER X 
MORGAIN, THE SISTER OF ARTHUR 
WERE other-world themes and situations are concerned, the 
true nature of Morgain may be traced with a reasonable degree 
of probability, but when tradition seeks to bind her to human 
kind by family ties, a tangled skein is the result. Morgain’s 
connection with Arthur is primarily romantic and mythical ; 
she should not properly be included among his kindred. To 
her original connection with him a large proportion of the epi- 
sodes related of her should be referred, and by it her attitude 
“toward him and toward the queen should be explained. So it is 
not surprising to find that the most widely emphasized human 
relationship of Morgain is with the king himself. Beginning 
with those passages which may be dated with comparative 
*\—assurance,! we find nothing before Chrétien that gives any trace 
of her mundane kinship. In Chrétien’s Zyvec,? in Hartmann 
von Aue’s Evec,3 in one manuscript of the Bataille Loguifer, 
throughout the prose romances, in the thirteenth-century 
romances of Floriant et Florete® and Claris et Laris,®§ as well as 
in the Axéeron,’ in the fourteenth-century romance of Ogier 
Ze Danois,® in the Arthour and Merlin, and in Sir Gawayne 
and the Green Knight, she is represented as Arthur’s sister. 
Here and there a confusion in the tradition arises, for Gaucher 
de Dourdan makes her Arthur’s niece,!! the author of Brun 
de la Montaigne Arthur’s cousin,” and Giraldus Cambrensis 
refers vaguely to a Morgain who is a kinswoman of Arthur. 
The real point of perplexity upon which the records throw no 
light, is how and why tradition allowed the fairy queen, Arthur’s 
love, the healer of his wounds, to occupy the unromantic position 
1 The lay of Zyo/et is of uncertain date; hence the reference in v. 630 to Zvain 
le filz Morgain is excluded here.

Morgain, the Sister of Arthur 137 
of his sister. Giraldus Cambrensis, it is true, gives us the 
result of one rationalization of the Avalon theme in his account 
of Arthur’s burial by a dignified kinswoman, and it is not 
unreasonable to suggest that this same tendency went a step 
farther and converted the kinswoman into a sister. Such a 
story might have grown up at any time after the identification 
of Avalon with Glastonbury, but it is altogether questionable 
whether it would have been sufficiently wide-reaching to 
account for the strength of the tradition that made Morgain 
Arthur’s sister. Again, though Arthur is not always the vic- 
tim of propriety, we might perhaps allow ourselves to fancy 
that he is in this case, and that some scrupulous narrator has 
transformed his stay with the beautiful fay in Avalon into his 
sojourn with a sister who tended his wounds. Or we might 
permit ourselves the conjecture that the broader significance 
of the old French swer (sister) frequently used by a lover to his 
lady, or a husband to his wife, lies at the foundation of the 
tradition Not much can be said in support of any of these 
ideas, none of which accounts satisfactorily for so persistent 
a feature in the legend. A confusion that we find actually 
occurring in early sources supplies a different explanation 
which appears more tenable. 
To form a just idea of the situation we must summon 
Arthur’s sisters before us. According to Geoffrey,? Wace® and 
Lazamon,* he had but one, Anna; she is given: in marriage 
to Lot of Londonesia or Leoneis, and becomes the mother of 
Gawain. By the time of the prose romances the royal damsels 
have multiplied in number, created probably by tradition as a 
convenient means of bringing certain kings into a closer rela- 
tion with Arthur by marriage. Here besides Morgain, Arthur 
has a sister, Hermisant, who marries Urien of Garlot,® another,

  138 Morgain, the Sister of Arthur 
Blasine (Basyne), who is given in marriage to Neutre of 
Sorhaut,! and still another, Elaine, who according to Malory? 
was bestowed on Nentre of Garlot ; a fourth and nameless sister 
marries Karadan,° or Briadas,* and dies. Anna disappears com- 
pletely from the romances, and although in the various accounts 
of the giving in marriage of the king’s sisters, Lot is said to 
receive one of them, she is not mentioned by name until the 
Arthour and Merlin,® where it is said that Lot married Belisant ; 
but her name is coupled with Blasine and Hermisant, and from 
its very collocation looks suspiciously as if it had been coined 
for the occasion. In Diu Créne Igerne lives in her magic 
castle with her daughter Orcades (Morchades),® the mother of 
Gawain —a tradition that by transferring to the wife of Lot the 
name of his territory, Orcades, Orcanie (the Orkneys), repre- 
sents one of the easiest possible devices for naming her.? In 
Malory the mother of Gawain is Morgause (Margawse).8 
In this confusion a few facts can be recognized. The 
authority of the earliest records assures us that the wife of 
Lot and mother of Gawain is Arthur’s only sister, Anna. 
Blasine, Hermisant, Belisart, Elaine, Emine, Orcades, and 
Morgause are assuredly mere names attached to an otherwise 
completely impersonal figure. Anna in the chronicles, Morgain 
in the romances, are the two important sisters of the king 
mentioned by name and appearing with an individual career,

another version of the same episode, in which the mother of Gawain is not named. 
Cf. also Perceval, v. 20,967 : — there sat beside King Lot at a festival Queen Mar- 
cadés (Morgads, MS. Mpl.). Morchades (Marcades) is perhaps merely a mis-

Morgain, the Sister of Arthur 139 
and in the case of Anna even this is practically non-episodic. 
Of these two sisters Morgain never appears in the chronicles, 
Anna never in the French romances.! Whence Anna came 
and whither she went are alike uncertain. Her name has a 
scriptural rather than a Celtic appearance, and whatever infor- 
mation regarding her may have been contained in Geoffrey’s 
source, the former associations seem to have clung about the 
name at all events in Lazjamon’s mind when he wrote, 
/@fter Arthur was iboren : 
peo edie burde 
heo wes ihaten AEne 
 aedien maiden.? 
There are three passages to which it is useful to call atten- 
tion here. The first is from the Lebor Gebhala or Book of 
Occupation which is preserved in the Book of Leinster. Here 
the Irish war-goddess Ana or Anann, known as Mater deorum 
Hibernensium,? is mentioned with Badb and Macha as the 
daughter of Ernmas, but in a versified form of the same 
poem Ana has disappeared, and the lines run according to 
Hennessy’s translation: 
Badb and Macha, rich the store, 
Morrigan who dispenses confusion. 
This is not at all a common identification, and in the account 
of the battle of Magh-Tuiredh,* all four goddesses are men- 
tioned; but the passage supplies an instance of the substitu- 
tion of Morrigan (Morgan) for Ana (Anna). 
The second passage to which I refer is Malory’s version of the 
episode of Arthur and the enchantress Annowre.5 We have 
already seen that one form of this incident was probably attached 
to Morgain. In other words a name resembling Ama, and the 
name Morgain are associated with the same series of events.

Waluuanii, ed. Bruce, Trans. Mod. Lang. Ass., XIII (1898), 390 ff.

140 Morgain, the Sister of Arthur 
The third passage that I have in mind has a purely con- 
jectural value. In the Welsh Peredur,! Gwalchmei, and in 
Kulhwceh and Olwen,2 Gwalchmei and Gwalhavet, are mentioned 
as the sons of Gwyar. Of this name Rhys says : “ Gwyar is 
a word used by Welsh poets in the sense of shed blood; so 
that as a proper name it seems to refer to Gwalchmei’s mother 
as a war-fury.... The interest of the name Gwyar, then, 
consists in its placing the bearer of it on the level of the Irish 
Mérrigu, as a war-fury.’° But, if it belongs to Gwalchmei’s 
mother at all, when put beside Geoffrey’s words it places its 
bearer on a nearer level with the war-goddess Ana. 
We find Ana, a war-goddess, in Irish tradition ; Anna, the 
mother of Gawain, in early sources in England and France ; a 
term applicable, according to Rhys’s interpretation, to Ana the 
war-goddess, given to one of Gwalchmei’s parents in Welsh 
material. This is an analogous situation to that which we shall 
meet in the case of the Morrigan: in a certain episode in a 
French source she retains her Irish name in a French form ; 
in Welsh material in the same episode a term synonymous 
with her name is used.® The evidence thus far indicates that 
tradition made Anna the mother of Gawain in her origin essen- 
tially the same sort of being that Morgain was in her origin, 
and that a consequent confusion in name between Anna and 
Morgain accounts for Anna’s disappearance from the romances 
and Morgain’s appearance there as Arthur’s sister.6 To Anna 
as the mother of Gawain, Arthur’s nephew,’ this position 
belonged by the time when Geoffrey wrote his Historia, 
whatever her origin may have been; but there is excellent 
reason to believe that it had not been Morgain’s from the time 
when tradition first associated her with Arthur.

® Rhfs (Arthurian Legend, p. 22) has implied that this is conceivable, but with- 
out giving the reason for his suggestion : — “ Geoffrey calls Loth’s wife Anna, but 
she is probably to be identified with Arthur’s sister called Morgan le Fay in the 
romances.” 
7 Gawain was Arthur’s nephew as early as 1125; see Hist. Litt, XXX, 29.
-P-A-G-E-153
  Morgain, the Sister of Arthur 141 
Both statement and incident here and there tend to confirm 
the existence of such a tradition and confusion. In the first 
place there are some significant words addressed to Gawain in 
the romance, L’Atre Perillous,! which belongs probably in the 
second half of the thirteenth century.” 
Une autre cose vous en di, 
Si savés bien, si est ensi: 
Vostre mere si fu moult sage, 
Auques vous dist de son corage, 
Je sai bien qu’ele fu faée, 
Si vous dist vostre destinée, 
Et vous acointa sans mentir, 
Quanques vous devoit avenir.? 
In the second place we have from an unexpected quarter an 
example of the actual substitution of Morgain for Anna in 
tradition. In the fragment of a Greek poem of uncertain date, 
contained in a manuscript of the thirteenth or fourteenth 
century, a certain king addressing Gawain, says : 
Oporoy ras xdpuras, wytépe cov Mopyaivy.* 
We also have a case that shows the possible reaction of the 
fay’s name upon that of the queen of Orcanie. This instance 
we owe to Malory, according to whom King Lot’s wife is called 
Morgause® Although Malory gives Morgause a passing men- 
tion elsewhere,® the only scenes in which she is an active figure 
are in the seventh book, which recounts the adventures of her 
son Sir Gareth, Beaumains. He comes, a fair and unknown 
youth, to Arthur’s court, is dubbed Beaumains by Sir Kay, in 
derision of his fair hands, and is kept in service as a kitchen 
knave until he takes upon himself an other-world adventure 
rejected by the knights of the court, and departs to win glory 
in its accomplishment. All that is said of Morgause is that

142 Morgain, the Sister of Arthur 
while he is absent on his quest, his mother, Morgause, comes 
to court, reveals his true name and chides Arthur for his treat- 
ment of her son.!_ When the young knight returns from his 
adventure, dame Morgause at sight of him falls down in a 
swoon.2, Thus the only source which relates the career of 
Beaumains is the only source for the two incidents in which 
Morgause is concerned.’ 
Morgain has a son whose name is practically synonymous 
with Beaumains, Sir Ewaine le Blanchemains.’ Yvain (Ewaine), 
the hero of Chrétien’s poem, like Beaumains, went on a diffi- , 
cult quest to the other world, and there passed through adven- 
tures similar to his. Whatever may have been the origin of 
the names of these two youths,’ Beaumains and Ewaine le 
Blanchemains, or whichever was first made by tradition the 
son of Arthur’s sister, the parallel between them in story and 
in name offers a plausible explanation for the influence of the 
name of Morgain, Sir Ewaine le Blanchemains’ mother and 
Arthur’s sister, upon that of Beaumains’ (Gareth’s) mother, 
who was also a sister of Arthur.® 
To turn now to the other family ties attributed to Morgain. 
Having been made Arthur’s sister, she had to be brought into 
connection with his kindred. By the time that the prose 
romances were compiled, her position as a member of the royal 
family was established, but established on a rather uncertain 
footing ; her relations to the king are here invariable, but the 
Teh-t25. 2 Ch: 33. 
8 In the 7ristan (Léseth, p. 58; cf. § 47; p. 489) a commonplace incident tells 
of the unnamed queen of Orcanie, Gaheriet’s mother, whose lover Lamorat jousts 
with other knights in defence of his boast that she is the fairest queen alive. In 
Malory’s version of the same episode (Bk. IX, ch. 13, 14) he naturally names 
her Morgause, having already known her by that name through his source for 
Book VII. 4 See Malory, Bk. I, ch. 2. 
> Beaumains is identified with le Beau Mauvais by Paris (Rom., XXVI, 1897, 
280, note 1), who explains Beaumains as the result of Malory’s failure to under- 
stand a French source. 
6 Perhaps it is not without significance that the only other episode beside those   that I have mentioned in which Gareth is brought into special connection with 
his mother is somewhat similar to the only episode in which Yvain and Morgain 
are associated. Cf. Léseth, §256; Huth Merlin, II, 212 ff.; Malory, Bk. IV, 
ch. 13. See also Nennius (ed. Mommsen, Mon. Germ. Hist., XIII, 1894), ch. 63 ; 
Skene, Four Anc. Books, 11, 439; Mabinogion, 1, 89 ; Lot, Ann. de Bretagne, XV 
(900), 528, 529. 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
Morgain, the Sister of Arthur 143 
same cannot be said of her ties to the other members of the 
princely circle. She is the daughter of Ygerne and the Duke 
of Tintagel, a bastard daughter of Ygerne, a bastard daughter of 
the Duke of Tintagel, a daughter of Uterpendragon.! It was 
also a difficult matter to anchor Morgain to one mortal husband. 
In the romances there are three kings regularly -allied by 
marriage with Arthur, — Lot, Uentre, and Urien.2 According 
to the Huth Merlin Morgain is given in marriage to Urien of 
Garlot ;° according to Malory to Urien of Gore ;* according 
to the English Merlin to Uentre of Garlot;* according to 
the Huth Merlin Morgan, a bastard daughter of Ygerne, 
is given to Neutre of Sorhaut.6 The fact that Morgain was 
the only name thoroughly in vogue in the thirteenth century 
as that of Arthur’s sister explains the confusion into which 
the author of the Huth Merlin falls in making both a Morgue 
and a Morgan Arthur’s sister. Neutre and Urien trench upon 
each other’s domains in other respects also. Urien is king of 
Garlot in the Huth Merlin, and of Gore in Malory, but 
Sorhaut is a city within his borders.’? As a result Morgain 
cannot be said to be persistently the queen of any one terri- 
tory ; but she is more persistently the wife of Urien than of 
any other prince. In the romances from early times Yvain is 
regularly the son of Urien.8 We should be glad to know whether 
tradition dealt with a Sir Ewaine le Blanchemains,® the child 
of Morgain, who was a distinct person from Yvain, the son of 
Urien; but in the silence of our sources, we can see only that 
such a tradition would offer the best possible explanation of 
Morgain’s marriage to Urien, for she would naturally be made 
the wife of that king whose son had the same name as her

144 Morgain, the Sister of Arthur 
own. Hence the Ewaine of whom she is represented as the 
mother is not always distinguished as Ewaine le Blanchemains,! 
but it is quite evident that her connection with Ewaine is more 
fully recognized than that with Urien, and that although she is 
in one source said to have married Uentre she is never made 
the mother of his son Galescin. There is no means, then, of 
telling surely whether a stage of tradition before or after 
Morgain’s marriage with Urien is represented by the lines in 
Tyolet : — Gauvain le baise et Uriain, 
Keu et Evain, le filz Morgain.? 
But they look a little as if there might have been the independ- 
ent tradition which I have suggested above, that made Morgain 
the mother of Ewaine le Blanchemains. We cannot share 
Ferdinand Lot’s doubt as to whether the Morgain mentioned 
is really the fay,? but we may feel reasonably sure that Zyo/et, 
which Paris would date no earlier than the twelfth century,* 
may not be said to contain early material for the Morgain saga. 
We may leave the subject of Morgain’s family ties, regarding 
the conjecture as plausible that Morgain, originally altogether 
disassociated from mortal kind, came to be considered Arthur’s 
sister because of a confusion between her name and Anna’s, 
which may be paralleled as early as the days when the Morrigan 
and Ana were war-goddesses on Celtic soil. To her sisterhood 
to Arthur are due the other human relationships that belong to 
her; hence Morgain’s most important mundane connections 
may all conjecturally be traced back in direct line to an associ- 
ation between her saga and that of the Morrigan.

romances; see also Arthour and Merlin, vv. 7635 ff. 2 Vv. 629, 630.

CHAPTER XI 
MORGAIN LA FEE 
iT 
WE have followed Morgain now through the principal epi- 
sodes! of her varied life,and have examined all the important 
features of her history. As we review them one after the 
other, two facts are probably obvious to us all:— first and 
most important, that a story parallel to that of Cuchulinn 
and Fand forms the nucleus of the entire Morgain saga as 
we know it; and secondly, that in the incidents which are 
attached least firmly to this centre the conception of Morgain 
as a great fairy queen accounts for her doings, her possessions, 
and her relationships. We have learned to be cautious in tam- 
pering with the doings of Time, who ruthlessly destroys even 
Breton lays and French romances, and to acknowledge that 
when we would restore what he has obliterated, we can lay 
claim to few results that are not tentative. Still, we have seen 
that Arthur’s stay with the enchantress and his experiences 
with Accalon, as well as his sojourn in Avalon, may be regarded 
as branches of our early fairy-mistress theme, and that a com- 
parison of the existing versions of all these episodes points to 
a strong probability that Morgain was the original fairy mis- 
tress. Our material, we have found, shows three noteworthy 
variations from the postulated original. 
1. The original hero and the original fay never appear 
together in their original relations; one of them is changed, 
or their relations to each other are changed. Arthur is lured 
to the other world by an enchantress, who loves him and has 
come to seek him. Morgain transports Renoart, Lancelot and 
Alisander to her own domains, and there claims their love. 
She entices Arthur by other-world agencies to a tower, intending

PPp- 190, 195 ff., 226, note, and Excursus I. 
145
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 Morgain la Fée 
to destroy him, or she guides him to Avalon that she may heal 
his wounds. 
2. The fierce hostility of the enchantress toward Arthur 
after he has left her, and of Morgain toward him in the fight 
with Accalon appears as a much less pronounced element in 
our typical fairy-mistress story, where Fand simply declares 
that since Cuchulinn has given her up for Emer, she has 
ceased to love him. 
3. Morgain is usually represented as Arthur’s sister. 
This last alteration in the material produced, as we have 
seen, the first of the three variations just mentioned; for 
as soon as Morgain was said to be Arthur’s sister, she could 
no longer be the mistress and he the lover of the story. The 
second variation, we have noticed, contains a parallel to the 
Morrigan tradition in that it reproduces the battle-maiden’s 
offers of love to Cuchulinn, and her anger at his repulse, 
which led her to attempt his death in combat. The third 
variation we accounted for most readily by an evident con- 
fusion between Morgain and Anna, Arthur’s sister, which is 
paralleled in Celtic myth by a confusion between the war- 
goddesses, Morrigan and Ana, and which in both the French 
and Celtic material was assisted by the fact that the two beings 
confused belonged to the same class in their origin. Two, then, 
out of the three variations on the early theme are paralleled 
in the Morrigan material, and the third is the result of one 
of them. 
To the postulated fairy-mistress story we have traced the 
experiences of Renoart, Lancelot, and Alisander with Morgain. 
We saw that the tradition of Morgain’s hatred toward Guine- 
vere was a probable outgrowth of the same early story, modi- 
fied by the variation that attributed to the fay a bitterly 
rancorous nature. This tradition, it is likely, influenced the 
story of Morgain’s love for Guiomar, in which we detected 
elements that belong to the original fairy-mistress theme, 
and that we found might have become attached to Guiomar’s 
name as a consequence of Morgain’s sisterhood to Arthur. 
We learned also that her connection with Guiomar might 
account for the special form of tradition that tells of her love 
for Ogier, which parallels the fairy-mistress theme attached to 
    
-P-A-G-E-159
  Morgain la Fee 147 
Guingamor, a knight whose name so resembles Guiomar’s that 
an association in story between the two heroes might easily 
arise, and a transference of the Guingamor type to a new amz 
of Morgain result. The same early motive we detected once 
more in the induction to the episode of the Val sanz Retor, 
but here we perceived Morgain’s character as fairy queen 
entering clearly into the saga. We saw also that to her 
position and traits as fairy queen, which made it easy to con- 
fuse her name with that of the well-known enchanter, Mon- 
gan, was probably due her connection with two other famous 
fidelity tests, the horn and the mantle; and that even these 
were used as a means for ringing changes upon the theme of 
her hostility to Arthur and Guinevere. Furthermore, her own- 
ership of these fidelity tests showed us a plausible reason for 
her appearance as the mother of the truth-loving and loyal 
Auberon, who cherished similar magic belongings. 
Very few of the themes that are attached to Morgain’s 
name are in themselves unique, nor are her activities dis- 
tinctive of her alone. All fays love gallant young knights3\ 
all, if they choose, shift their shapes, build enchanted dwell- 
ings, fashion magic objects, and take dire revenge upon mor- | 
tals who offend them. The student of the French romances 
early learns that when a personage from one cause or another 
came to be regarded as the type for some one class, or as the 
typical representative of a special quality, there began to be 
attracted to him a variety of stories repeating the particular 
deed for which he was celebrated, or exemplifying the trait 
for which he was distinguished. Plenty of illustrations will 
occur to all of us; the histories of Gawain, Lancelot, Merlin, 
Caradoc at once come to our minds. Hence it may seem quite 
possible that Morgain’s close association with Arthur as the 
healer of his wounds led to her being accounted a powerful 
fay, and that then numerous typical and popular fairy stories 
were attached to her name at the dictates of each narrator’s 
fancy. It is, however, highly questionable whether this pro- 
cess would result in so closely connected a whole, in which 
the parts adhere firmly to a centre, as the Morgain saga 
presents. The essential elements forming its true kernel 
resolve themselves into the early fairy-mistress theme, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
Ee TN ta ee ee eRe Me rr CET eae ee 
148 Morgain la Fee 
anger of the fay against her lover, and the rvé/e of Morgain 
as the fairy queen. These are the three factors, then, with 
which we have to reckon in determining Morgain’s origin. 
II 
Does a derivation of Morgain from the Morrigan account 
for the essential elements of the Morgain saga? Clearly it 
does not explain the details of the fairy-mistress story that 
was probably at one time told of Arthur and Morgain. The 
fairy messengers from Avalon, Arthur's enchanted voyage 
thither, the promises of healing for his wound, and his sojourn 
in the other world lead our thoughts to Fand and Mag Mell, 
but not to the Morrigan. It does, however, explain those devel- 
opments of the early story in which the fay’s rancor follows 
the rejection of her love, namely, the story of Arthur in the 
tower of the enchantress, and that of Hector, Renoart, Lance- 
lot, and the fickle lover who met his fate in the Val sanz Retor, 
and it gives a reason also for Morgain’s hatred of Arthur. It 
throws light, too, upon Morgain’s sisterhood to Arthur, even 
if it does not wholly account for it. 
Moreover, if Morgain be derived from the Morrigan, there 
is an easy explanation for her otherwise puzzling twofold atti- 
tude toward Arthur, who is the object of her care and of her 
vengeance. The Morrigan stands in specially intimate rela- 
tions to Cuchulinn. In one of his youthful exploits she acts 
as his protectress by spurring him on to valor just as he is 
about to be worsted in conflict.1_ Despite the hostility ascribed 
to her after Cuchulinn’s refusal of her love, she gives him her 
aid, as we have seen, and in his final battle until his last 
moment she does not cease her efforts to protect him.” 
Minor incidents, too, here and there in Morgain’s life faintly 
reproduce episodes told of the Morrigan. Such is the story of 
the punishment by transformation into a river visited by the 
Morrigan upon the offending Odras, and Morgain’s spell cast 
upon her rival in the Val sanz Retor.? An episode of the 
same character, though here the parallelism is rather more 
striking, is that of the Morrigan’s shape-shifting to escape 
1 See Hibbert Lectures, p. 452. 2 See p. 34. 8 See pp. 99-102.
-P-A-G-E-161
Morgain la Fee 149 
from Cuchulinn’s grasp, and Morgain’s shape-shifting as she 
flees across the moors from Arthur’s pursuit with the scab- 
bard of Excalibur in her hand. 
When we turn from incident to attribute we see a closer 
parallelism, especially in the manifestation of supernatural 
power. In the Cath Maige Turedh (Second Battle of Moy- 
tura),? the Morrigan with Badb and Macha? is represented as 
' protecting the Tuatha dé Danann from their enemies by magic 
clouds of darkness and mist, and showers of fire and blood.t 
Another of her gifts is that of prophecy, which she uses 
in behalf of the Dagda, telling him where his enemies will land 
their forces and how she will destroy the son of their king ;* 
and she gives a timely warning to “that extraordinary precious 
thing the Brown Bull of Cuailgne’’ when the men of Erin are 
planning to carry him away from his home.’ Shape-shifting is 
one of the Morrigan’s most ordinary habits, and she commonly 
appears to mortal sight in some disguise. Her favorite form 
is that of a bird, especially a crow or araven.? She becomes in 
turn an eel, a gray wolf (or hound),® and a white red-eared cow 
in a contest with Cuchulinn.® We have seen her come to him 
also as a beautiful maiden,” as a woman with red eyebrows,"

ited and translated in an abridged form from a fifteenth-century manu- 
script in the British Museum (Har/. 5280) by Whitley Stokes in Rev. Celt, XII

the tenth or eleventh century. See also Rev. Celt, I, 40; O’Curry, On the 
Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish, London, 1873, I, 187. 
8 The Morrigan is more closely associated with her two sisters, Badb and 
Macha, than with any of the other Irish war-goddesses, and when she does not 
appear alone, she usually moves in their company (see Rev. Celt., I, 1870-1872, 
35 ff. pass.; Cuchullin Saga, p. 102 ; cf. above, pp. 34, 139). Morgain frequently 
appears in the society of two fays (see pp. 50, 51, summaries in Excursus I). But 
three is a number so commonly connected with fays that no stress should be laid 
on this resemblance (see e.g. Perceval, vv. 26,699, 34,143; Floriant et Florete, 
wv. 552 ff., 8258; Paris, R. 7: R., III, 119; Malory, Bk. IV, ch. 18; Maury, p. 32;

and still again we read that after she was wounded by him 
in battle, since he alone could heal her, she sought him in the 
guise of an old crone driving a cow, and by giving him a drink 
of milk won his blessing, which at once made her whole.! 
According to the Céir Anmann? the Morrigan dwells in one 
of the szdk; Hennessy gives us to understand that she had a 
fairy palace beside the Suir. In the Zochmarc Emire we read 
of the Morrigan’s Garden‘ and the “Wood of the Badb, i.e., 
of the Morrigan’’;® in the “led Bricrend there is a mere men- 
tion of the Morrigan’s ford, and certain Irish localities accord- 
ing to Hennessy are designated as the Morrigan’s Field, the 
Mound of the Morrigan, the Fulacht of the Morrigan.7 
We cannot have followed in Morgain’s path thus far without 
finding ourselves on familiar ground as we read of these attri- 
butes and associations of the Morrigan. Morgain’s name is 
not wholly unrepresented in the topography of Armorica; she 
has, it goes without saying, a fairy dwelling ; she can foretell 
the future, she can cast a magic mist where she will. Like 
the Morrigan, also, Morgain is a fomenter of strife: — « Deboi- 
naire estoit ele sor toute rien tant com ele estoit en sen boin 
sens. Mais quant ele se courechoit enuers aucun homme 
noiant estoit del acorder.” ® “Whan she were wroth with eny

to her beauty that evidently existed among the narrators who 
described her appearance looks as if there had been some story

The parallels that we have examined assuredly indicate a 
connection in tradition between Morgain and the Morrigan. 
The forms of the two names also point in the same direction ; 
but conclusions that are based on the possible relation of the

French and Celtic names must be highly uncertain, for there 
is always present the possibility that the word Morrigan did 
not enter France from Ireland directly, but through Wales, 
where the form that it assumed has perished with the literature 
in which it may have been embodied. ~ Also we may as well 
acknowledge the fact that no fay nor mortal was ever more 
elusive or erratic in career than is a proper name in mediaeval 
literature, and that with the multitudinous opportunities for 
a misunderstanding in an oral or a misspelling in a written 
source, theories as to its domestication on foreign soil accord- 
ing to strict phonological conventions “ gang aft agley.’ The 
relation of the forms of Morgain’s name to each other and to 
Morrigan is a matter into which the element of uncertainty 
enters too strongly! for it to have much weight in establishing 
the connection between the two mythological figures. We are 
treading on surer ground in dealing with the sagas. 
The community between the Irish battle-goddess and the 
Breton fay may be said to be in the main one of attribute 
rather than of incident; and many of their characteristics are 
too universal with supernatural beings to be important in fixing 
1 The spelling of Morgain’s name is a variable quantity (see Excursus II for a 
classified collection of the passages in which the name is found). In French 
our earliest forms are Morgue, Morgdin, ih Chrétien, and Morgdén in the Roman de 
Troie. The difference in the forms Morgan, Morgain simply represents, it 
should be said, an exceedingly common variation in spelling of which we have 
many instances (cf! Garadagain, Caradigan ; Houdain, Houdan ; Agrevain, Agra- 
fan. Chrétien inflects the name with a nominative Morgue (Evec, vv. 4220, 4222; 
Yuain, v. 2953), an accusative Morgain (Erec, v. 1957), following the regular 
inflection that is seen in such names as Eve, Evain; Berte, Bertain; Alde, Aldain 
(see Schwan-Behrens, Grammatik des Altfranzisischen, Leipzig, 1899, § 288, 3). 
He is the only author who is consistent in his inflection. In other sources, 
neither Morgue nor Morgain is reserved exclusively for one case, except in the 
Auberon, where Morgue is sometimes used in the accusative, Morgain in only the 
accusative. In Gaucher de Dourdan’s continuation of the Perceval there occur 
the earliest sure examples of Morghe as an accusative (vv. 30,240, 30,308). This 
obtrusion of each case upon the other may be due not only to the general ten- 
dency of the language to drop inflection, but an accusative Morgain may also 
have come to be regarded as a nominative by analogy with such well-known 
names as Yvain, Gauvain, Agravain. Morgain itself is given the nominative 
termination s in some sources (see below, pp. 256, 257. In /oriant et Florete, 
v. 2083, the form Morgains as an accusative is doubtless influenced by mains, 
the last word of the succeeding verse). In the Roman de Troie (v. 7990) Morgan 
appears as a nominative. From the fact that in such early material Morgan 
is a nominative it seems rather more likely that an analogical nominative, 
 
-P-A-G-E-165

an identity. But the aggregate of the resemblances, and the 
parallelism appearing both in that incident of the Morgain saga 
which forms the kernel of the whole, and also in Morgain’s 
relations to Arthur, the mortal with whom she is most closely 
associated, make it likely that the situation is not the result of 
a chance accumulation of stories. 
Ill 
How intimate a connection may we believe exists between 
Morgain and the Morrigan? Doubtless we have all noticed 
as we have reviewed the parallels in the Morrigan and Mor- 
gain traditions, that although their framework is the same, 
the effect of the two structures is unlike. A remoteness 
from the Celtic which is perceptible in the French material 
is scarcely easy to reconcile with the view that the latter is 
directly repeating the former. In the French sources we are 
listening merely to an echo, at times clear and distinct. Shall 
we believe, then, that the tradition of the Morrigan came to 
Morgue, was formed from Morgan (ain), than that the reverse process took place, 
namely that Morgazn is an analogical accusative, which in the Roman de Troie is 
already obtruding upon the nominative, as it certainly did in the thirteenth cen- 
tury. It is possible to explain the form Morgdn (or Morgdin) as derived directly 
from Morrigan. The name of the war-goddess is written Mérrigan, Mér Rigan, 
Morrighan, Mor(r)ig(h)ain, Morrign, Morrigu (see Hennessy, Rev. Celt., 1, 53, for 
the declension ; Stokes, Rev. Ce/t., XII, 128, 308). The original accent of the word 
is uncertain; but the etymology generally accepted by scholars (see below, p. 159), 
which explains the name as a compound consisting of mor, great, and r/gan, queen, 
makes it probable that the word had an accented penult. Of this Celtic penult there 
is no trace in any of the French forms of Morgain’s name, doubtless owing to the 
fact that the distinct vowel a of the last syllable of M/orrigan had drawn the accent, 
and thus occasioned the loss of the 7. Welsh material, if it existed, might supply 
us with a convenient intermediate form. ‘The earliest instance of the name, that 
in the Vita Merlini (vv. 920, 933), gives us no assistance, inasmuch as we do not 
know on what language Geoffrey’s latinization is based, whether French or Welsh, 
and to reconstruct his original from his Latin form of a name is a delicate task. 
Not to mention the many examples that his Historia affords, in the Vita Merlini 
we find that his Latin for Taliesin is Telgesinus, for Rydderch, Rodarchus. It 
should be added, however, that if the connection between Morgain and the Morri- 
gan be established, we may eliminate from consideration Lot’s theory that the 
Morgen of the Vita Merlini is derived from the Irish Muirgen, the name of the 
mermaid whose history is told in the Death of Eochaid referred to above 
(pp. 9, 10; see Lot, Rom., XXVIII, 1899, 323 ff.; Rhys, Celtic Folklore, Oxford, 
1901, p. 373), and with whom we have seen that Morgain has no connection in 
tradition.

154 Morgain la Fée 
France direct from Ireland, or that it passed through Wales 
before it reached the continent? Either course would be 
possible, but there are two factors that have some weight in 
turning the scale in favor of a Welsh intermediary. One has 
just been mentioned — the Morgain tradition is not a perfectly 
transparent medium for that of the Morrigan. The other is 
an incident fortunately preserved in our scanty portion of 
Welsh literature. Zimmer and Foerster in their arguments 
in favor of an Armoric source for the Arthurian material lay 
special stress upon the fact that our Welsh texts never men- 
tion Morgain la fée :— “ Die in den franzésischen Texten mit 
Arthur und Avalon aufs engste verkniipfte Fee Morgan ist 
der welschen Sage iiberhaupt, nicht blos der Arthursage, eben- 
falls absolut unbekannt.””! “Die kymrische Sage kennt eine 
Fee Morgan gar nicht, so dass der kymrische und kymrisie- 
rende Bearbeiter Ivains und Erecs mit ihr nichts anzufangen 
wusste.... Diese Figur ist nicht etwa nur der Artussage, 
nein, sie ist der inselkeltischen Saga iiberhaupt fremd.”? Yet 
it is in the Mabinogion, in Peredur,? that the incident is found 
which suggests the solution of our problem. 
As Peredur is on his way to attack the Addanc, a dreadful monster who 
lives in a cave and slays men, he sees the fairest lady whom he has ever 
beheld seated on a mound. «“*I know thy quest,’ said she, ‘thou art 
going to encounter the Addanc.... And if thou wouldst pledge me thy 
faith, to love me above all women, I would give thee a stone, by which 
thou shouldst see him when thou goest in, and he should not see thee.’ 
“I will, by my troth,’ said Peredur, ‘for when first I beheld thee, I loved 
thee; and where shall I seek thee?’ ‘When thou seekest me, seek towards 
India.’ And the maiden vanished, after placing the stone in Peredur’s 
hand.” Thus equipped, Peredur enters the cave of the Addanc and 
slays him. 
After sundry adventures Peredur rides into a valley where many gaily 
colored tents are spread in preparation for a tourney to be given by the 
Empress of Cristinobyl the Great: “and she will have no one, but the 
man who is most valiant; for riches does she not require.” At the win- 
dow of one of the tents Peredur espies the fairest maiden that he has ever 
beheld, and forthwith he loves her greatly. The next day he enters the 
lists, and wins the tourney. At the bidding of the Empress, he visits her. 
«“ And the Empress said to him, ‘Goodly Peredur, remember the faith that

    Morgain la Fée 155 
thou didst pledge me when I gave thee the stone, and thou didst kill the 
Addanc.’ ‘Lady,’ answered he, ‘thou sayest truth, I do remember it.’ 
And Peredur was entertained by the Empress fourteen years, as the story 
relates.” 
The Empress is plainly no ordinary mortal Empress of Con- 
stantinople; she is essentially a fay, endowed with pure fairy 
attributes. She knows Peredur’s quest of the Addanc with the 
true fay’s foreknowledge of her chosen knight’s career, and 
comes to the hero who is strongest and best for the express 
purpose of winning his love. Her magic stone is one of the 
many pledges, potent to supply a pressing need, that a fay 
gives the mortal whom she loves.!_ She can change her appear- 
ance at her will, and like Dame Liones, Sir Gareth’s fairy 
mistress, now in one guise and now in another even more 
beautiful, she affords the same hero the sensation of falling 
in love with her twice. Very probably also the Empress 
created the tournament with the design of winning her chosen 
knight for herself.

rigans The proffered aid of the Empress to Peredur he com-

156 Morgain la kee 
coming danger to Cuchulinn in the Taiz Bo Cuailgne As 
Cuchulinn despises the Morrigan’s favors, so, he says, Peredur 
leaves the Empress and forgets his life with her. The com- 
parison is scarcely to be pressed. The scene in which the 
Empress proffers her aid to Peredur lacks one of the most 
important details of that in the Zazx Bo Cuailgne, namely 
Cuchulinn’s scornful rejection of the Morrigan’s advances ; 
the absence of this element leaves the episode one that may 
be paralleled again and again in the romances. The fay’s 
delight is to await by the fountain or in the forest the coming 
of her chosen hero, with the sole object of giving him what- 
ever he wishes and of gaining his love. Guingamor, Lanval, 
Graelent, Gawain, Florimont and many other heroes experi- 
enced this seductive trait of the other-world damsel. Nor 
is Peredur’s voluntary separation from the Empress after a 
sojourn with her near enough to Cuchulinn’s contemptuous 
treatment of the Morrigan to be significant. Nothing is com- 
moner than this situation in fairy stories, and ever since the 
days of Bran the supernatural mistress has permitted the mor- 
tal to leave her after a period passed with her in her domains. 
There is one other incident in the Pevedur® with which the 
Empress is connected. 
Peredur comes to a lake in the middle of which stands the Castle of 
Wonders. He enters the open door, and sees in the hall a chessboard on 
which the chessmen are playing against each other. ‘And the side that 
he favored lost the game, and thereupon the others set up a shout, as 
though they had been living men. And Peredur was wroth, and took 
the chessmen in his lap, and cast the chessboard into the lake. And when 
he had done thus, behold the black maiden came in, and she said to him, 
‘The welcome of Heaven be not unto thee. ... Thou hast occasioned 
unto the Empress the loss of her chessboard, which she would not have 
lost for all her empire.’” The only way in which Peredur can recover 
the chessboard, she continues, is to slay a certain Black Man, who is 
ravaging the dominions of the Empress; but when Peredur returns from 
the adventure, she refuses to admit him to the presence of her lady until 
he shall have killed a destructive stag of the forest to which he shall be 
guided by the little dog of the Empress. 
Another version of this same episode is contained in Gau- 
cher’s continuation of the Perceval. ®

Morgain la Fée 157 
Perceval enters a wonderfully beautiful castle on the bank of a stream. 
In one of the apartments he espies a golden chessboard with golden chess- 
men, self-moving, ever-mating. They checkmate him when he begins to 
play with them, and in an ill-humor he takes them from the board, intend- 
ing to fling them out of the window. But his plans are thwarted by the 
advent of a beautiful maiden, who rises from the river flowing past the 
castle, and, telling him that the chessmen are in her keeping, commands 
him to restore them to their place. Not until he has obeyed her, does she 
consent to enter the castle and listen to his words of love. Even then she 
will not grant his desire until he has undertaken the quest of the white stag 
in the forest, in which her fairy brachet is his guide.! After arduous adven- 
tures he returns to her with the quest accomplished ; then sitting before the 
chessboard she tells him its history. 
Once upon a time Morgain chanced to be playing chess with a knight in 
a meadow, when a certain necromantic maiden joined them, and begged 
Morgain to accept from her an enchanted chessboard. Shortly afterward 
Perceval’s love had entered Morgain’s service as a lady in waiting, and when 
at last she had asked permission to go away, Morgain had given her the 
magic chessboard as a parting gift. The maiden had left Morgain’s dwell- 
ing and had wandered to the river, where she had built her beautiful castle. 
For ten years the chessboard had been in her keeping. 
This same adventure is related of Perceval in the Didot-Per- 
ceval,? but here Morgain has no place. The mistress of the 
castle is the hero’s love, and imposes the adventure upon him; 
the chessboard is in the keeping of one of her attendants, who 
holds a laughing parley with Perceval, enjoining him to restore 
the chessmen to their places before she will grant him the privi-_ 
lege of seeing her mistress. 
Morgain’s part in the incident of the Chessboard Castle is 
rather puzzling ; in fact the story connecting her with the chess- 
board appears like an altogether needless device of Gaucher's 
for filling up the hours of conversation between the reunited 
Perceval and his amze. The interchange of courtesies between 
Morgain and the maiden skilled in necromancy, and Morgain’s 
subsequent gift to her swzvante suspiciously resemble padding, 
the manufacturing of which would require no great amount of 
ingenuity.2 But even if the lion’s share in the details belongs 
1 Cf. below, p. 230. 2 Pp. 438-445, 467-471. 
3 An evident emanation from Gaucher’s story is contained in Les Quatres 
Freres Chevaliers de la Table Ronde, a late romance summarized in no better 
source than the Bibliotheque Universelle des Romans, ed. Paulmy, July, 1777, 
I, 106-122. For other-world chessboards and games of chess, see above, p. 90;
-P-A-G-E-170
    158 Morgain la Kee 
to Gaucher, it is natural to suppose that he had some reason 
for attaching them to Morgain’s name and for forcing her into 
this special tale. 
In Peredur the Empress as an active participant in the story 
is scarcely more important than Morgain is in the Perceval. 
The Black Maiden lives and moves and has her being for the 
express purpose of imposing adventures upon Peredur as tests 
in consequence of his failure at the Grail Castle, and although 
it is in the name of the Empress that Peredur kills the Black 
Man and pursues the stag, the entire point of the story is that 
the Black Maiden really demands the adventures from the hero. 
In Perceval, though the lady who guards the board is the hero’s 
love, it is she who imposes the adventure. In neither is Mor- 
gain nor the Empress much more than a mere figure behind 
the scene, although the Empress, of course, forms an integral 
part of the story in a way that Morgain does not. Thus 
Gaucher’s lady of the Chessboard Castle takes the 7é/e which 
in the Madinogi is divided between the Black Maiden and the 
Empress, in the Didot-Perceval between the damsel and the 
mistress.1_ In all three sources, no one of which is probably 
dependent wholly on the others, a fay guards the chessboard 
which is or has been the prized possession of a fay greater than 
herself. In the Peredur this more powerful fay is a fairy queen, 
the Empress; in the Perceval she is the fairy queen, Morgain. 
‘Plainly Gaucher and the author of the Peredur are indebted, 
though perhaps not directly, for the outline that they follow, to 
a common source, according to which a fairy queen entrusts to 
a maiden’s care a magic chessboard. In the Welsh source this 
fairy queen is called the Empress (amherodres) of Cristinobyl, 
in the French, Morgain. What was the fairy queen called in 
the ultimate source from which the Welshman and Gaucher 
drew ? ; 
The original significance of the Morrigan’s name is not cer- 
tain. Two derivationg have been suggested. There is no 
Perceval, 1, 85, 89; Hist. Litt, XXX, 83; Silva Gadelica, 11, 258; Mabinogion, 
I, 383 ; Rev. Celt, XII (1891), 79; Kennedy, Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts, 
London, 1866, p. 137; cf. Cuchullin Saga, pp. 37, note, 59, 135- 
1 For a discussion of the exact relations of the sources in this complicated 
incident, see Holy Grail, pp. 139-145. Morgain’s connection with the story is 
all that is important here.
-P-A-G-E-171
  Morgain la Fée 159 
question that Régan means “queen,” and it is only in regard 
to the signification of the first member that authorities differ. 
The name is sometimes found with 6 (Mérrigan), a spelling that 
justifies the interpretation of the first syllable as mor, “great.” 
For this meaning there is authority in the Acallamh na Sené- 
rach, where there are mentioned among the Tuatha dé Danann 
the children of the mérrighan or “great queen,” daughter of 
Ernmas, with her six and twenty female warriors.! Whitley 
Stokes makes a different suggestion.2 “The mor seems iden- 
tical with O.H.G. and A.S. mara, Eng. mare in night-mare, 
Germ. mar (gl. damia), Grimm, Worterb. s.v. Mahr, Pol. mora. 
The mark of length sometimes found over the 0 of Mor is due 
to popular etymology: so dévama for bdroma.”* Whatever the 
accent of the word originally was, it affords too excellent an 
opportunity for popular etymologizing to escape receiving the 
interpretation “great queen.” In addition to the above pas- 
sage from the Acallamh na Senérach there is evidence that it 
came to be so understood‘ in the fact that Morrigan is almost 
as much a title as it is a proper name. A gloss in the Ledor 
Buidhe Lecain explains Macha, the name of one of the Irish 
war-goddesses, as the third Morrigan or great queen ;® we hear 
also of a Macha Moingruadh who founded Armagh, and of 
Mongfind, a queen of the third century, to both of whom the 
name Morrigan is applied.® 
There is no reason to suppose that if the name Morrigan 
reached France, its Celtic meaning would be felt there. In 
the French interpretation of the Welsh Caradoc breich bras we 
have an example of the way in which a Celtic name might 
be treated in France. Srveich bras in Welsh signifies great 
arms, breich meaning “arms,” and éras, “great.” This by the 
mistake of some Frenchman who understood évas as his native 
word for “arm” has been turned in French into drzef, or briés,

braz, “short arm.”! If the tradition of the Morrigan reached 
Welsh districts, however, the meaning of the name would 
probably still be felt. The name of the Irish hero Nuadha 
Argetlamh or Nuada of the Silver Hand? is represented in 
twelfth-century Welsh in the Black Book of Caermarthen by 
Lluda Llaw Eveint or Lludd of the Silver Hand, where Rh¥s 
suggests that the L/udd is an early corruption for Vudd3 In 
other words, the Irish epithet is represented by a synonymous 
epithet in Wales, a fact indicating either that in Wales the 
Irish term was understood, or that a common tradition existed 
in the two countries. Hence it would not be at all surprising 
if we found the Morrigan’s name interpreted in Wales as 
“great queen,” and rendered amherodres, the Empress. 
But the Empress of the Peredur is, as we have seen, a pure 
fay, and not distinctively a battle-maiden at all. The story 
of the Mabinogi in fact would have no bearing upon the ques- 
tion before us, if it were not that classes of supernatural 
beings insist upon poaching on each other’s preserves,* and 
that certain common attributes attract members of one order 
into the territory of a similar order without regard to the 
antecedents of either. I have spoken above of the indications 
that the Irish war-goddess Ana was made into a fay in popular 
tradition.’ In the Irish story Woinden Ulad (The Debility of 
the Ultonian Warriors),® which there is reason to believe con- 
tains very early material,’ the name of the Irish battle-maiden, 
Macha, appears as that of a true fay, who comes, a mysterious 
stranger from an unknown land, to love and help a mortal,

whom she suffers to leave her only on condition that he never 
reveal their love, and whom despite his disregard of her com- 
mand she saves in a moment of peril. Macha is said in 
the story to be the daughter of Saimreth mac Imbraith, that 
is Saimreth the son of Ocean, and hence we may infer that she 
came from the Celtic fairyland which is often situated under the 
waves.! Moreover, it is reasonable to suppose that Cuchulinn’s 
marvellous horse, Liath Macha (the Gray of Macha), which 
rises from a lake for the hero’s capturing hand and returns to 
the lake after his master’s final battle,? is an other-world gift 
from the fay Macha, whose name he bore. Furthermore, 
the attributes of a war-goddess as the protectress of a warrior 
in battle would be peculiarly ready to coalesce with those of 
a fay, who protects her favorite hero in an hour of danger. 
Hild,* Sigrun, Svafa5 in Norse mythology are very like fays in 
their relations to the heroes whom they love and guard. The 
Empress herself by means of her fairy stone protects Peredur 
on his quest of the Addanc. Saxo Grammaticus'® tells a story 
of Hother, who one day when he was hunting lost his way in 
a mist, and came upon a company of maidens :— ///ae suis 
ductibus auspictisque maxime bellorum fortunam gubernart 
testantur. Saepe enim se nemini conspicuas proeliis tnteresse, 
clandestinisque subsidiis optatos amicis praebere successus. 
Quippe conciliare prospera, adversa infligere posse pro libitu 
memorabant. Hother listens to words of counsel from them; 
the scene vanishes from his sight, and he finds that he is alone 
in the open country. Peter der Diemringer von Stauffenberg, 
the hero of a Middle High German poem,’ has a fairy mistress

8 With this wonderful horse who bears the name of a maiden descended from 
a sea king cf. Galatée, the beautiful steed given to Hector by Morgain (Roman 
de Troie, vv. 7989 ff.); the name looks as if the horse were called after Galatea, 
the daughter of Nereus.

whom he met by the wayside. In response to his words of 
love she confides to him that she was waiting for him, for she 
has loved him ever since he could first mount a horse, and she 
has often protected him in tourney and in battle, though 
invisible to him. The subject of the poem is an exceedingly 
wide-spread fairy theme, and there can be no question that the 
beautiful lady who has protected Peter is a fay. 
From these examples it is clear that the attitude of the 
Morrigan toward Cuchulinn, whom she protects in his youthful 
exploits, although she spurs him on to fresh trials of his 
strength, whom she seeks in the hope of winning his love, and 
whom she tries to save from death on the battlefield, is in 
itself such as easily to lead the popular imagination to confuse 
her with a fay. Accordingly we should not be at all surprised 
to see the Morrigan becoming in popular superstition a true 
fay, nor to find either her own name, or a Welsh synonym, 
applied to any fairy queen in Wales, where its significance may 
have been felt. But in France the name would certainly not 
be so transparent nor its significance so sure to be understood ; 
in Graelemor and Guingamor, for instance, the -mor (great) has 
completely lost in French its value as an epithet, and has 
become a part of the name. Hence in France Vorrigan would 
more readily be regarded strictly as a proper name by which the 
queen of the fairies was appropriately called. From very early 
times proper names have shared such a fate as this on foreign 
lips. The Phoenician term £abirim, which meant “the great,” 
and which was applied by the Phoenicians to the great gods of 
Samothrace, the Greeks turned into a proper name and desig- 
nated the Samothracian deities as Kd@epor. The Phoenician 
name Melicertes, which means “king of the city,” was given 
by Tyrian traders to the chief local divinity of any Greek town, 
and as a result, the Greek god Palaimon, who is associated with 
Corinth, becomes Melicertes,! 
IV 
In the light of tradition gathered from many sources, no one 
of which alone is illuminating, the history of Morgain may be 
traced with a reasonable degree of clearness. We will suppose 
1 See Usener, Sintfluthsagen, Bonn, 1899, pp. 151, 152.
-P-A-G-E-175
Morgain la Fee 163 
that the Irish battle-goddess, the Morrigan, became in the 
conception of the Celtic people more and more a fay; when 
traditions about her reached Wales, where the meaning 
of her name was felt and her traits recognized as in a large 
measure those of a fay, she was regarded as the great fairy 
queen. When tradition was in this stage, we may conceive 
it to have entered France, where the Morrigan’s name was felt 
essentially as a proper name, though her power was that of a 
great fairy queen rather than that of a war-goddess. We have 
no right to assert positively whether the tradition came directly 
from Ireland or through Wales, but from the remoteness of the 
associations between the Morrigan and Morgain, from elements 
in the chessboard episode, as well as from the first story 
of Morgain that we can postulate, it appears more probable 
that before the tradition reached Armorica, it passed in Wales 
through an intermediate stage in which the Morrigan’s name 
had become associated plainly with the conception of a fairy 
queen. In this fay, whom we know in France as Morgain, the 
traits are naturally most prominent that were most pronounced 
in the Irish war-goddess, and incidents told of the war-goddess 
are repeated of her. Hence since the Morrigan stood in 
peculiarly close relations to one hero, Cuchulinn, we need not 
be surprised to find that, as story after story told of other 
heroes became attached to Arthur, the theme of the Morrigan’s 
love and hatred for Cuchulinn was repeated of Arthur and 
Morgain. Whether a story parallel to that of Fand and 
Cuchulinn had already been connected with Arthur’s name or 
not, it would be very easy for the two episodes that recounted 
the offers of love made to Cuchulinn by two supernatural 
women to become confused — particularly if both incidents 
were told on foreign soil1— and to give us the form of early 
love story that we have conjectured was told of Morgain 
and Arthur. Naturally the original traits of the Morrigan 
appear in the character, then, of Arthur’s fairy mistress, 
although in our early story her 7é/ reminds us of Fand’s. 
But such a development of Morgain from the Morrigan would 
not lead us to expect that Morgain’s attributes and activities

164 Morgain la Fée 
would be limited to those of the battle-goddess ; they would 
embrace all the arts of a powerful fay, and would doubtless 
appear in just such a variety of forms as those predicated 
of Morgain in our early sources. When she was once estab- 
lished in France as a great fay, certain developments in the 
saga arose. In the first place she was subjected to rationaliza- 
tion, in which her sisterhood to Arthur very probably had 
no small influence. Although this tendency is perceptible 
in the Vita Merlini the first marked trace of it is evident 
in Hartmann von Aue’s long and composite description of 
Morgain in the Zrec.1 Hartmann represents Famurgan as the 
king’s sister, who died like any mortal woman, and he feels 
that an attempt at explanation for her attainments in the magic 
art is necessary: — ich enweiz wer siz lérte. In fact this pas- 
sage from Hartmann throws some light upon the situa- 
tion in the prose romances, where Morgain’s title la fée,” 
1 See p. 45, note 1. 
2 Morgain is so frequently designated /a /ée, that the term becomes almost an 
integral part of her name. See Roman de Troie, v. 7989; Roman de Thebes, Il, 
Appendix I, v. 2812; Erec, v. 1957; Prose Erec, p. 264; Perceval, v. 30,240 ; 
Bel Inconnu, v. 4263; Huon de Bordeaux, vv. 3493, 30,381; Ploriant et Florete, 
v. 5145; Ogier le Danois, Renart le Nouvel, see below, p. 256; Jus Adan, p. 76; 
Vulgate Merlin, pp. 77,361; Huth Merlin, 1, 120; Prophecies, pp. xliiii, xlv, xcv ; 
Loseth, §§ 265, 624; Livre d’Artus, P., p. 13; English Merlin, pp. 86, 374, 
375, 508; Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight, v. 2446 ; Malory, Bk. I, ch. 2, 20; 
II, 11; IV, 4, 6-15; VI, 3; VIII, 24, 28; IX, 13, 25, 26, 41-43; X, 1, 17, 20, 35— 
38; XI, 1; XXI, 6. See the German forms below on p. 258, note 2, in which 
Jfé has become engrafted upon the name; cf. the common Italian Fata Morgana ; 
see p. 251. This designation may be a remnant of an early stage of Morgain’s 
history, an echo of the popular interpretation of Morrigan. She is the great 
queen, the fay; hence Morgain la fée. Or it may have been used simply to stamp 
Morgain as a feminine being, because of the masculine form of her proper name. 
Margot-la-Fée in a number of the districts of the Cétes-du-Nord is a generic 
term for fays who dwell in rocks and caves (see Sébillot, Tyad. et Sup. de la 
H. Bretagne, 1,74, 106). There is not sufficient material to establish a direct 
connection between Morgain la fée and the Margot-la-fées. These latter, be it 
said, resemble the fays of the sea to whom the Morganes of Ouessant show simi- 
larities (see Sébillot, 7rad. e¢ Sup., I, 106 ; below, p. 251, note 2). Probably the 
name of the great fairy queen has been changed in popular tradition to the familiar 
name that was nearest it in sound, just as Sancta Marina in the Latin calendar 
appears as Hagia Maria in the Greek, though since the same tradition is told of 
her as of Sancta Pelagia, Marina is assuredly the correct name (see Usener, 
Legenden der Pelagia, Bonn, 1879, p. xvii. Cf. the suggestion of Rh¥s, Zrans. 
Hon. Soc. of Cymmrodorion, 1892-1893, p. 16, that in a poem which he cites from 
the Black Book of Caermarthen, Meredid (= Margarita) is a popular substitution
-P-A-G-E-177
Morgain la Fee 165 
and her acquisition of necromancy are explained in various 
ways.t 
In the second place, Morgain came to be regarded as a type 
of fairy queen, and in some of the later sources her Morrigan 
nature is altogether overshadowed by the more general concep- 
tion. This is true, as we have seen, in the Ogier story and in 
the Auberon,; it is also evident in Floriant et Florete, the Jus 
Adan, the Chanson d’Esclarmonde, and Brun de la Montaigne,? 
all of which illustrate the fact that to Morgain’s name there 
were in time attached common and typical fairy situations, 
when her place had come to be indisputably that of the fairy 
queen of romance. 
Few points in the above course of tradition can be said to be 
proved ; but where there is ground for each conjecture of a 
series, we should probably be led at every turn into deeper pit- 
falls and snares than we have been encountering, if we were 
treading on purely debatable land. Hardly would the facts 
suggested by our material dovetail so nicely if we were not 
for an original Morgen). The change of a specific to a generic name is not unusual 
in the speech of children; we can all recall examples of it. In fact the very name 
Margot-la-Fée, whatever its origin, is an illustration of such a development 
(cf. p. 100, note 1. For an example of the easy confusion between Margot and 
Morgan, cf. the variants of Margos in Aliscans, v. 4714, given in Rolin’s edi- 
tion, Leipzig, 1894, — Morgaus, Morgans, Margot ; see note on v. 4716; cf. Hertz, 
Spielmannsbuch, Stuttgart, 1900, p. 348). 
1In the Zamcelot (II, Ixix) it is said that because of Morgain’s interest in 
enchantment, she left human society and passed day and night in the forests by 
the fountains, so that people foolishly said that’ she was not a woman, but they 
called her Morgain la déesse (in Paris, R. 7. X., IV, 238, Za fée. For the use of 
déesse as synonymous with fée, see Hertz, Spielmannsbuch, Stuttgart, 1900, p. 351; 
Grimm, D. JZ, I, 140; cf. Gawayne and the Grene Knight, v. 2452; Hartmann 
von Aue, Zrec, v. 5160). Another account preserved in the Huth Merlin 
(I, 120) and Vulgate Merlin (p. 77) says that in her girlhood Morgain was sent to a 
convent where she learned the arts, astronomy and fisigue: — Et par cele fisique et 
par le sens quele ot lapeloit on Morgain la fée. The English Merlin (p. 86) tells 
the same story, but also reports that Morgain learned so much necromancy from 
Merlin that the peple cleped hir afterward Morgain le fee, the suster of kynge Arthur 
(p. 508). In the Livre d’Artus, P. (§ 135) still a different reason for the title is 
given. Morgain instructs in her magic art certain ladies of the land so that 
throughout the country-side she is called Morgain la fée. One of the most ordi- 
nary results of rationalization is the explanation of a fay’s power as art learned 
from an enchanter, or as due to an acquaintance with astrology ; cf. above, pp. 43, 
114, below, p. 205; Partonopeus, vv. 4575 ff.; Bel Inconnu, vv. 4838 ff.

166 Morgain la Fée 
reconstructing with an approximate degree of accuracy the 
original of which they form the component parts. 
The Irish Morrigan, developed by tradition into a fay, but 
retaining her pronounced original attributes, transferred through 
Wales to Armorica, and on French soil attracting to herself a 
romantic saga of which the Morrigan myth forms the kernel, 
and which manifests itself in consistent developments, — this 
is the being that we have reason for conceiving Morgain la fée 
to be. Her character is not so complex as it looks at first 
sight, for she is tenacious of her Celtic prototype, and as a rule 
marshals her attributes closely about those of the Irish battle- 
goddess.

CHAPTER XII 
LA DAME DU LAC 
I 
THE NATURE OF THE DAME DU LAC 
ALTHOUGH in the romances there are very many fays 
endowed like Morgain and Niniane with a proper name, a 
large number who are important as the ames of valorous 
knights are nameless. The fay’s lack of a proper name is 
noticeable also in the early Celtic sources. The maiden who 
enticed Bran to Emain is simply the woman from Emain, the 
queen with whom Maelduin sojourned is only the Queen of 
the Amorous Isle, Connla’s love is the Maiden from the Plain 
of Delight. They are types, scarcely having an individual per- 
sonality ; each exists for the narrator, not because she already 
has an independent history, but merely because the love of an 
other-world damsel will add to the brilliancy of some special 
hero. Hence, doubtless, the vague terms in which the Celtic 
fays are named. In the romances also there is a vast num- 
ber of fairy-mistress stories that are practically unattached, in 
which the fay is called simply /a puciéle, la dame, or la damot- 
sele, and is characterized by some epithet appropriate to her 
kind.1 In the case of the Dame du Lac her title at once 
betrays her fairy nature; for the Celtic imagination placed 
the other world not only beyond the sea, but also beneath 
the sea (Tir na n-Og, Tir fa Thuinn).2 From such a land,

apparently, the fay Macha came to this world.1 To the same 
other world belonged the kindly puciéles des puis, of whom we 
read in the Perceval,? who when a wayfaring knight rested by 
a spring were wont to arise from the water bearing golden gob- 
lets and dishes, in which they served him the food and drink 
that he craved.. A familiar example of the kind of being who 
dwelt beneath the waves is given also in the lay of Zydorel? 
The beautiful queen of Bretagne is visited one day in her garden by a 
tall and handsome knight, who gives her greeting, and confesses that he 
has come in quest of her. When the queen begs him to tell her who he 
is, for reply he lifts her into his saddle and rides off with her to a lake, 
across which he who swims shall have all that his heart desires. The 
mysterious lover seats the queen on the shore of the lake, then, mounted 
as he is, plunges into the waves and disappears from sight. 
De V’autre part est fors issuz, 
Si est a la dame venuz; 
“Dame,” fet il, “ desoz cest bois 
Par ceste voie vien et vois : 
Ne me demandez noient plus.” + 
He takes the queen back to the garden, but continues to visit her secretly 
until their love is discovered. A son, Tydorel, is born to them, who, after 
he has grown to the age for knighthood, hears the story of his birth; 
instantly he mounts his horse, spurs off to the lake, plunges into its depths, 
and never returns. 
Another hero of the same nature as this knight of the lake 
is Aalardin del Lac, who figures in the first continuation of 
Chrétien’s Perceval.’ 
Aalardin del Lac is a knight from a distant land, who dwells in a beau- 
tiful pavilion spread on the banks of a stream that flows near a grove where 
birds sing with marvellous sweetness. Within the pavilion maidens and 
their ams sing caroles and make merry. At the door are two figures of 
gold and silver, wrought by enchantment, one of which holds a harp, the 
other a dart. If he who is base attempts to enter, the dart is thrown at 
him and the harp sounds discordantly; when a wounded knight who is

worthy is brought to the tent, the sound of the harp banishes the sense of 
pain, and he awakes as from a grievous dream. 
One day the knight Caradoc, separated from his companions in a stag- 
hunt, is overtaken by a storm. As he stands under the sheltering branches 
of a tree, he sees.a marvellous light moving toward him through the forest, 
and hears birds singing as gaily as in summer. In the midst of the bright- 
ness there rides a great knight, whom Caradoc salutes as he passes ; but 
he answers never a word, and goes on his way surrounded by the blaze of 
light and accompanied by the birds. Caradoc follows, but can with diffi- 
culty keep him in sight, and rides on in swift pursuit to a beautiful hall 
where many knights are seated playing chess and draughts. Here the 
knight dismounts, comes laughing toward Caradoc, greets him by name, 
and admits that he has purposely led him a chase, in order to entice him 
to his abode. His name, he adds, is Aalardin del Lac. 
There is scarcely a detail of importance in this description 
of Aalardin del Lac that cannot be paralleled from pure fairy 
material. The beautiful pavilion, the marvellous birds, the 
enchanted figures that test the merits of the comers to Aalar- 
din’s tent, the magic harp, the gay company, the stag-hunt, the 
storm and druidic light! by which Aalardin leads his desired 
guest to his dwelling, these are all familiar characteristics 
of fairyland, and we may well believe that Aalardin’s appella- 
tion del Lac is no empty title, but that in an earlier source, 
he, quite as truly as the splendid father of Tydorel, was a knight 
from the other world under the waves.*

who is skilled in the healing art.

a restriction laid upon her by her fairy mother, when she finds that she will be 
compelled to speak, she will cast herself into the sea and return whence she came.

170 La Dame du Lac 
Thus we find abundant evidence that the name of the Dame 
du Lac indicates her fairy origin, and is as appropriate to a 
fay as Ja damoisele de Vile faée, la puciele de Tile d'Or, or la 
sage dame de la forét sans retor. 
II 
THE FAIRY GUARDIAN OF LANCELOT 
No fay is connected in tradition with Morgain so intimately 
as the Dame du Lac. The romantic material dealing with her 
does not exhibit so large a variety of typical fairy episodes as 
that which we have been reviewing in our study of Morgain, 
and it forms by no means so thoroughly developed a tradition. 
It is limited to three chief groups:—those stories in which 
the Dame du Lac is represented as the guardian of Lancelot, 
those in which she appears as an opponent of Morgain, or is 
brought into contrast with her, and those in which she is called 
the love of Merlin. The first class is by far the most important, 
and since each of the others may be explained as the result of 
late influences working upon a narrative already developed, to 
discover the underlying conceptions in the story of the Dame 
du Lac, we must examine first those episodes showing her rela- 
tions to Lancelot. No one of these has reached us in a truly 
primitive form. The tradition had advanced several degrees 
beyond its original stage when it was embodied in our earliest 
extant version. We shall approach this more intelligently, if we 
leave it for the present, and examine first the parallel sources 
which contain earlier forms of the same theme. Of these there 
are several; for although the very title of the Dame du Lac 
predisposes us not to seek a definite antecedent for her as for 
Morgain, she belongs to a type of being, who, to quote from 
Alfred Nutt, “appears ... in every form and at all periods of 
Celtic mythic literature, and forms one of the most distinctive 
and characteristic personages of that literature,” ! namely the 
supernatural woman who instructs a young hero in the manly 
exploits — skill in arms or the chase — that fit him for some 
special purpose. In the stories through which we know the 
fairy guardian, we find her occupying one of three relations to 
1 Folk Lore Record, IV (1881), 32.

the hero. She is his mistress, his mother, or simply his 
instructress. One of the early examples of such a personage 
is contained in a version of the Zochmarc Emire, which Kuno 
Meyer assigns to possibly the eighth century :!— 
Cuchulinn is induced by his enemy Forgall the Wily, to go by a perilous 
road to the dwelling of Scathach, where he may learn soldierly feats. He 
is welcomed to the dun by Scathach’s daughter, who at once becomes 
enamoured of the young chieftain’s beauty, but relinquishes him to her 
mother for the night. As the maiden serves Cuchulinn at meat, he stirs up 
a fray in the dun by taking hold of her and breaking her finger. A cham- 
pion of Scathach’s attacks him, and in the ensuing combat meets his death. 
“ Sorrowful was the woman Scathach at this; so that he [Cuchulinn] said 
to her he would take (upon himself) the service of the man that had fallen.”? 
As Scathach’s champion, Cuchulinn abides in her dwelling and learns skill 
at arms of her. He gives his love to her daughter, yet Scathach also occu- 
pies toward him the position of a mistress. Many are the marvellous feats 
that he learns under her tutelage, before he takes leave of her and goes to 
his own land. “ And she told him what befel him after he came to Erin, 
and Scathach said this : ‘Great peril awaits thee.’ ” ® 
Wild and mysterious though Scathach-is, she may be defined 
as an other-world being,t who is Cuchulinn’s instructress in 
martial skill; as the defender of her dwelling he puts in prac- 
tice the arts learned of her ; she apparently treats him as her 
lover, and moreover she knows his future career. 
If we turn now to much later sources, to the lay of Zyolet 
and to Renaud de Beaujeu’s Bel Juconnu,® we find what is 
undoubtedly a very early conception of the fay’s attitude to 
the young hero whom she fits for the task that awaits him. 
Tyolet lives alone in the forest with his mother, a widow (/a veve dame). 
and he is skilled in the chase, the possessor of a valuable gift, taught him 
by a fay, a magic art in whistling.

Et a sifler li enseigna :

4Jn the later version of the Zochmarc Emire the other-world character of 
Scathach’s dwelling is more pronounced. Beside being reached, as in the earlier 
version, by a path that leads through other-world perils, it is situated on an island 
connected with the mainland by the Bridge of the Cliff; see above, p. 85, note 3.

172 La Dame du Lac 
One day in the woods the lad gives chase to a stag, which, instead of respond- 
ing to his whistle, turns away from him, leads him in pursuit to a stream, 
across which it swims, and then is transformed before Tyolet’s astonished eyes 
into a knight fully armed, and mounted on a beautiful horse. The knight 
by his words fills the boy’s heart with longing for knighthood, and bids him 
tell his mother that he would fain become a knight. In answer to Tyolet’s 
wish, his mother gives him all the armor that she has in her keeping, and 
sadly sends him forth to Arthur’s court. _ His first adventure after his arrival 
is a quest proposed to the knights of Arthur by the daughter of the King 
of Logres. This maiden demands that a knight cut off the white foot of 
the stag with hair that shines like gold, guarded by seven lions ; her white 
brachet shall lead him to the stag’s haunt, and the reward shall be her own 
hand. Guided by the brachet, Tyolet, by means of his magic whistling, 
charms the stag, and compels it to come to him and stand motionless while 
he cuts off the foot. The lions he slays by his own prowess. He 
returns to court, and is rewarded by the love of the maiden, who takes him 
to live in her land, where he is king and she is queen. 
Although in Tyolet’s secluded boyhood, the prominent figure 
is his mother, it is entirely by fairy agencies that he is brought 
to the point where he can perform the adventure leading to the 
fay’s love. The many stories cited above of the messengers 
used by a fay to win a young knight to herself teach us to rec- 
ognize here at once that the magic whistle! and the druidic 
stag that shifts its shape to that of the mounted knight? are 
the means employed by the fay to prepare him for his final quest, 
and to compel him to the series of adventures that will give him 
to her for her lord. There can be no doubt that the other-world 
influence which guided Tyolet’s life emanated originally from 
the fairy princess of Logres. e that this was the case all 
the more clearly when we compare her with the fay of the Ile 
d’Or, the love of Gawain’s son, Guinglain, in Bel Znconnu. 
Bel Inconnu arrives at Arthur’s court, an unknown youth, unacquainted 
with his own name and parentage : —

Ne je ne sai se je oi pares WU 
As his first adventure he undertakes to /rescue from enchantment the 
lady Blonde Esmerée, and on his way to the place of her captivity he

hero to her land, see Brown, Studies and Notes, VIII, 98 ff. 8 Vv. 117 ff.

La Dame du Lac 173 
passes the Ile d’Or, the abode of /a pucele as blances mains. Here he 
overcomes a knight, who in a pavilion before his lady’s abode defends it 
against all comers. Thus Bel Inconnu wins the right to the fay’s love. 
He does not linger long to enjoy it, but soon leaves the Ile d’Or to accom- 
plish the adventure on which he is bent. After he has released Blonde 
Esmerée from the spell of which she is the victim, he hears a mysterious 
voice telling him that his name is Guinglain, and that he is the child of 
Gawain and the fay Blanchemal. He wearies of his separation from the 
maiden of the Ile d’Or, and at length wins her forgiveness for his desertion 
of her ; then he learns that she has been the moving cause of all the incidents 
of his life, and has had foreknowledge of his every deed. Her words are 
highly significant in fairy tradition. 
Et saciés que moult a lonc tens 
Qu’amer vos commengai premiers, 
Ains que vos fuissi¢s chevaliers, 
Vos amai je, car bien le soi,

| Aloie je por vos véir ; 
Mais nus ne m’en fesist issir.t 
She had known all his destiny; she had incited the messenger from 
Blonde Esmerée to seek in Arthur’s court a knight to rescue her mistress, 
knowing that Guinglain was he who would undertake the deed. Hers had 
been the mysterious voice nee ae heard tell him his name and parent- 
age, after he had eee ide Esmerée from enchantment. With all 
her power she had aided/ him through his career, because of the great love 
that she bore him, and her sole object had been to win him for her amz.

Unquestionably in the life of Tyolet and Guinglain the fay 
plays the same part. She fixes her love upon the hero while 
he is a mere lad dwelling with his mother, and destines him to

accomplish the adventure appointed by her as that which shall 
give a knight the right to her love. The smiting off of 
the stag’s white foot is quite as much a means of testing 
the hero’s valor before he is admitted to the fay’s favor! as 
is the encounter of Bel Inconnu with Malgier le Gris at the 
entrance to the Ile d’Or. Renaud, when he represents the 
maiden of the Ile d’Or as desiring Guinglain for her knight 
and also as impelling him to the rescue of Blonde Esmerée, an 
adventure which will eventually take him away from her to 
marry the rescued damsel, is undoubtedly modifying his source 
to suit his own design. We may be very sure that the true 
fay does not lead the hero to the rescue of some mortal damsel 
whom he is to wed. She trains him for purposes that directly 
concern herself, and have to do with the accomplishment 
of her own desires.”

druidical fawn with a golden lustre upon it, described in Coir Anmann, Stokes 
and Windisch, III, ii, 319: Maynadier, Zhe Wife of Bath’s Tale, London, 1901, 
pp. 25 ff. 
2 A story throwing a side-light upon the theme that we have been examining, 
1s the account of Peredur’s visit to the sorceresses of Gloucester, contained in the 
Welsh Peredur (Mabinogion, 1, 322 ff., 369, 370). Peredur is brought up by 
his mother in the wilderness, and grows strong and agile, able to hunt and slay 
the deer, gaining in boldness and strength. After he has set out to seek adven- 
ture, he passes the night at the dwelling of the nine sorceresses of Gloucester, 
who are devastating the country. In the morning he sees a sorceress at her evil 
work, and attacks her so fiercely that she cries him mercy, calling him by name. 
“« How knowest thou, hag, that Iam Peredur?’ ‘ By destiny, and the foreknowl- 
edge that I should suffer harm from thee. And thou shalt take a horse and 
armour of me; and with me thou shalt go to learn chivalry and the use of thy 
arms.’” Peredur takes surety of the hag that she will not injure the land further, 
and goes with her to the palace of the sorceresses. “ And there he remained for three 
weeks, and then he made choice of a horse and arms and went his way.” Later we 
learn that the sorceresses have been destined to be slain by Peredur. Arthur 
and his household, Peredur among them, attack them, and slay them every one. 
The story is confused, and just why Peredur should have gone to learn chivalry 
to the abode of creatures so evil as the mysterious sorceresses, or why they should 
have trained him from whom they knew that they were destined to suffer harm, is 
not at once clear. 
The modern Celtic folk tale, Ze Sea Maiden, which Campbell (I, No. iv) 
reports, helps explain the situation: — An old fisherman, who is childless, is out 
fishing one day when a sea-maiden rises by the side of his boat, and in return for 
his promise that he will give her his first son, not only sends him plenty of fish 
but gives him three magic grains for his aged wife, who if she eats them will have 
three sons; when his son is three years old, the fisherman must remember the 
sea-maiden. The child is born, but his father fails to take him to the sea-maiden
-P-A-G-E-187

La Dame du Lac SOehe5 
We do not know Renaud’s direct source for the fay as 
the protectress of Guinglain’s career. He probably used a 
version of Guinglain’s boyhood such as appears in the English 
on the appointed day, and although he promises to bring him to her at the end of 
four years, he once more breaks his word, and this time is bidden by the sea- 
maiden come again at the end of seven years bringing the child with-him. At 
the end of seven years the lad hears of his father’s promise, and determines to go 
out into the world to try his fortune. He passes through manifold unimportant 
experiences, but his chief adventure is with a terrific monster who makes a vast 
amount of trouble by coming out of the loch where she lives and carrying off 
human beings to her abode. She seizes upon the hero, and takes him to her 
dwelling, but releases him for the sake of some jewels promised her by a princess 
whom he has married. Next she takes possession of the princess, but the hero 
succeeds at last in killing the monster and regaining his wife. 
Through a variant of the story (Campbell, I, roo ff.) we learn who the frightful 
beast actually is; for in the variant the mermaid herself rises from the loch, and 
carries the hero away to her dwelling; but she returns him to his wife for the sake 
of some.gaudy dresses that the lady spreads on the shore to attract her notice. 
In the former of these versions the two parts of the story are ill-connected. 
The sea-maiden is represented as having some mysterious and special interest in 
the lad’s career; she not only occasions his birth by her magic, but wishes to have 
him in her keeping in his childhood, and awaits his growth to manly strength. 
Yet her connection with him is apparently severed from the moment when he sets 
forth from his father’s house, and the listener is left to wonder what happens when 
one forgets to regard the will of a sea-maiden. But the fay is never thwarted in 
her purpose, and the variant, which shows us that it was the maiden herself who 
transported the youth to her dwelling, gives us good reason to feel sure that the 
monster is the fay bespelled into a hideous shape, from which she can be freed 
only by the hero whom she has herself destined for this purpose. This, as we 
have already often seen, is a common type of story, and some such theme as this 
renders the form assumed in the Peredur by the account of the sorceresses. of 
Gloucester intelligible. In this original the supernatural women who trained the 
young hero may quite possibly, like the sea-maiden of the modern tale, have been 
bespelled, and instead of being really destroyed by the prowess of their pupil at 
arms, were only freed from enchantment. The fay, however, is supreme in power ; 
hence originally she could not have been represented as bespelled, for there is no 
magic greater than that of which she is mistress. But since she herself could 
shift her shape, and since she had minions who were shape-shifters at her control, 
from the fact that she often tested the hero’s courage by demanding that he pur- 
sue or vanquish a transformed fairy being, there would very naturally arise the 
story that she herself had been transformed, and was waiting for the coming of 
the hero to be released. 
An interesting parallel to this class of story occurs in the Vé/sungasaga, in the 
account of the birth of Velsung, where a supernatural maiden performs a similar 
part to that of the sea-maiden in Campbell’s versions. The parents of Volsung 
have long been childless. Hljéth, the daughter of Hrimnir, the giant, in bird form 
brings to Volsung’s father an apple, which he takes to his wife, who eats of it, 
and in consequence bears Velsung. When the hero grows to manhood, he marries 
Hljéth, whom Hrimnir sends to him. See Vélsungasaga, cap. i, ii.

176 ‘ La Dame du Lac 
Libeaus Desconus,! according to which Guinglain is the son 
of Gawain and a maiden whom he met “be a forest syde”’ ;? 
the child’s boyhood, like that of Perceval, is passed with his 
mother in the solitude of the woods, which he leaves at a 
suitable age to seek knighthood at Arthur’s court. He is 
never ‘represented here as the object of a fay’s protecting 
care from his earliest years. Renaud’s original for this ele- 
ment in his narrative was evidently early in character, for 
although the pucele as blances mains is rationalized, her part is 
near to primitive conceptions.? She is a true Celtic fay, all- 
powerful, intolerant of the slightest infringement of her will, 
and having as the single aim of her existence to lure to her- 
self her chosen mortal favorite. In type the story that Renaud 
knew belonged to the same class as Zyolet. We might easily 
suppose that for narrative and personal reasons he was simply 
attaching to Guinglain’s name an unattached bit of current 
fairy tradition, if it were not that we have other sources of 
information concerning the fairy protectress of Guinglain’s 
youth. In these sources she is his mother, or simply his 
instructress. Thus, the Guinglain material shows the guardian 
fay occupying toward him each one of her three typical rela- 
tions to the hero, mentioned above; for according to Renaud 
and some other sources Guinglain is said to be the child 
of Gawain and a fay, — Florie in Wigalois, a maiden “ met 
be a forest syde”’ and therefore doubtless a fay, in Lzbeaus 
Desconus, the fay Blanchemal in Bel Jnconnu.s In all of these 
romances the hero is brought up in seclusion by his mother, 
and at a fitting age is sent by her, properly equipped, to 
Arthur’s court to seek knighthood. 
According to Wigalois, Gawain marries an other-world princess, Flérie, 
whom he leaves after a six months’ sojourn to return to court. In the

4 Some confusion in tradition is indicated by the reading adopted by Hippeau 
(Bel Inconnu, v. 3208), Blanchemains, for the name of Guinglain’s mother as well 
as of his fairy guardian; Foerster, however, gives Blancemal as the manuscript 
reading (see Hist. Litt, XXX, 176, note 2); cf. also Perceval, VI, 187, where 
Blancemal appears as the name of a true fay. 
Dame Ragnell is merely mentioned as the mother of Guinglain in the Weddynge 
of Syr Gawayne. See Madden, Syr Gawayne, London, 1839, wv. 800 ff.

fulness of time, Florie gives birth to a son, whom she brings up with the 
greatest care; she and her maidens train him in valor and in knightly 
accomplishments until he has grown into a brave and handsome lad. 
He hears of his father, and entreats his mother to let him go forth in search 
of Gawain. She reluctantly allows him to go to Arthur’s court. When he 
arrives he is given into Gawain’s care for instruction in knighthood. Later, 
from the soul of a dead king, whose daughter Wigalois frees from an 
enchanter’s power, he learns that his father is the same Gawain under 
whose tutelage he has been living.? 
This story brings us into touch with an old and wide-spread 
narrative formula, according to which a child born illegitimately 
or posthumously is brought up in seclusion by his mother, 
or if, as not infrequently occurs, he is separated from her in 
infancy, by a childless couple, a nurse, or a supernatural agent. 
He is kept in ignorance of his father’s name and of his 
inherited rights, until circumstances stimulate his curiosity, he 
learns something of his history, and goes forth to find his 
father, or to regain his ancestral possessions.? Frequently, 
through misunderstanding or ignorance, he meets his unknown 
father in combat, and recognition by means of a token, or 
in some other way, ensues. In some variants, as in Wigalois, 
the union between the boy’s parents has taken place in the 
other world, and the mother is a fay. The lay of Doon? 
furnishes another example of this latter situation. 
Doon, a knight of Brittany, rides to a castle, which although said to be 
in Danebore (Edinburgh), is evidently a magic dwelling, and here he 
meets certain apparently impossible conditions imposed by the fairy mis- 
tress of the castle upon her wooers, who all alike have been unsuccessful. 
Doon remains with her but three nights, then returns to his home, bidding 
her give their son a certain ring when he has grown to a suitable age, and 
send him in search of his father. The child is born, his mother lavishes 
the most careful training upon him, and when the fitting time comes, sends 
him to France ;* here he meets Doon in a tourney, and the father and son 
discover their relationship. 
Social conditions in days when a passing knight easily wooed, 
won, and deserted a maiden, leaving her to rear their unchristened

child,! doubtless gave rise to such a story as this,? which 
is extremely common, and is told far more often of the son of 
a mortal than of a fairy mother. The picture of the fay as a 
mother rearing her child does not rest upon a primitive con- 
ception of her nature.? For example, in the early version of 
the Tochmarc Emire, that I have cited above, Cuchulinn passes 
one night with an other-world princess, Aiffe. ‘She also said 
that it was a son she would bear, and that the boy would come 
to Erin that day seven year. And he left a name for him.” * 
Later versions relate the more fully developed story of this 
son, that when he came to Erin, he met his unknown father 
in a conflict and fell by his hand. Many and many a valorous 
hero, like Cuchulinn, left a son destined to become a centre of 
tradition ; and the child of such an evanescent fairy union, born 
sometimes after his mortal father had left the other world and 
returned to earth, was fittingly made the hero of a narrative 
telling of the youth’s quest for a father whom he did not 
know. Leaving for the time being this form of the story 
as Wirnt tells it, we will look at our other source in which 
Guinglain’s fairy guardian appears. This is the account of 
the boyhood of Gawain’s son, given in the first continuation 
of Chrétien’s Perceval. Although here the youth is nameless, 
resemblances between the Perceval and the cycle of poems 
that relate the career of Guinglain, Li Biaus Desconeus, indi- 
cate that he and the hero of the Perceval story are one and 
the same. As a preface it should be said that this latter

and his fairy love, which is essentially the same as that of Graelent and Lanval, 
yet in Désiré an obviously later feature is introduced in that a son and daughter 
are born to the hero and his fairy mistress. Long after Désiré has left her and 
returned to court, the fay appears there, accompanied by her son and daughter, 
whom she presents to the king with the request that he knight the lad and con- 
seiller the maiden. The king accordingly bestows knighthood on the son, and 
marries the daughter. Désiré and his love are married in church, before the fay 
takes him back with her to her own land, whence he never wishes to return.

serail is confused ; the author evidently knows more than 
one version of the story that he is telling, and reduces as well as 
combines sources. He gives contradictory accounts of the 
bringing up of the child, and two versions of the meeting 
between Gawain and the boy’s mother, which, however, 
although they differ in detail, are alike in the main outline. 
The parts of the story that concern us here are easily elimi- 
nated from the rest.! 
The hero of the narrative is the son of Gawain and Gloriete,? a maiden 
whom Gawain finds in a beautiful pavilion on the bank of a stream, and 
with whom he passes but a few hours of dalliance on his way to adventure. 
She is the sister of the knight Brandelis, who cherishes a feud against 
Gawain for the wrong that he has done her. Later Gawain inadvertently 
comes to the castle of Brandelis, a conflict takes place between them, in 
which just as Gawain is about to slay his opponent, Gloriete springs for- 
ward, holding up between their drawn swords her child, who is five years 
old. A complete reconciliation of the knights is the result, and Gawain 
remains for some time at ‘the castle of Lis with his amze and her son. 
One day the child is stolen while at play. His two uncles go out to 
search for him; Gawain, meanwhile, accompanied by Gloriete, rides off 
to Arthur’s court, which he soon leaves in quest of adventure. At this 
point in his narrative the poet pauses to tantalize us by hinting at what 
he might have said, if he had chosen to tell all that he knew.

knight drawing near them. The maiden sends the lad to him, with orders 
to bid him tell his name and errand, and even to strike him if he does 
not obey. “Coment? fait-il, mostrés-le mot.” Whereupon the maiden 
teaches him how to deal a blow, to wield his lance and bear his shield; 
the boy advances to the knight, and on his refusal to tell his name, 
stretches him with one blow lifeless on the ground. The lad in per- 
plexity goes back to the maiden who on discovering that his shield has 
been dented in the fray promises him another that will be far better. 
A little later the boy has an encounter with another knight, who fells 
him to the earth. The maiden hastens to him, lifts him up, puts him on 
his horse, and instructs him further in the proper method of holding his 
shield ; moreover, she gives him a shield wonderfully wrought in ivory 
and gold, that only he of great valor can win. They ride forward to a 
beautiful pavilion in a garden, and here they take up their abode. The lad 
defends the pavilion against all passing knights, and achieves many splen- 
did victories. One day Gawain himself comes in sight, and the youth 
meets his unknown father in deadly combat. Gawain admiring his young 
opponent’s powers bids him tell his name. But the boy replies that he 
does not know it; in the court where he was brought up, Za riche sale du 
fis, he was called Ze neveu son oncle, for his mother did not dare mention 
the name of his father in the castle, because of the great wrong that he 
had done her family. Gawain at once feels sure that the lad is his son, 
and declares himself the prisoner of the pucidle au pavillon. When he 
is led to the maiden, she bids him tell his name, and thus the relationship 
between him and the boy is revealed. 
Very similar to the Perceval story in its elements, although 
not in its conclusion, is that of Finn mac Cumhaill. The old- 
est account that we have of his birth is found in the Fotha 
Catha Cnucha (Cause of the Battle of Cnucha) contained in the 
Lebor na h-Vidre, and hence written down in the beginning 
of the twelfth century. 
Cumall, son of Tremor, king of Ireland,woos Murni Muncaim (Murni 
of the Fair Neck), daughter of the druid Tadg, and when her grandfather 
denies his suit, he carries her away by force. Cond, in whose service 
he is engaged, bids him restore the maiden, and upon his refusal Cond 
sends forces against him, who slay him and his men. Murni expects 
to give birth to a child, and spurned by her father, who wishes her to 
be burned for her offence, she takes refuge at Cond’s suggestion in the 
house of Cumall’s sister. Here a son is born to her, and Demni is 
the name given him. ‘ The boy is nursed by them, after that, until he was 
capable of committing plunder on every one who was an enemy to him. 
He then proclaims battle or single combat against Tadg, or else the full eric

of his father to be given to him. Tadg said that he would give him judg- 
ment therein.” Tadg leaves his stronghold, Almu, and cedes it to Finn. 
It is quite plain that this is an incomplete narrative, and 
that although the narrator is giving a full account of the love 
of Cumhall and Murni and the birth of their child, he is omit- 
ting some part of the story that he had before him. We are 
told that the boy is called Demni, and the next time that he 
is mentioned by name in the narrative he is spoken of as Find,! 
yet no statements are made that explain this change of name. 
The child’s mother and aunt are represented as giving him the 
training that fits him for the great object of his existence, — 
revenge upon his father’s enemies.” 
In the so-called Boyish Exploits of Finn Mac Cumhail? a 
fragment of the Psalter of Cashel, a fifteenth-century manu- 
script in the Bodleian library, an account is given of the 
early days of Finn, which, although it is not nearly so full as 
the Ledor na h-Uidre version in the part dealing with the hero’s 
birth, is evidently based upon a narrative that contained details 
lacking in the earlier source. This version supplies an explana- 
tion for the change of the boy’s name, as well as a definite 
account of his rearing, neither of which appears in the Ledor 
na h-Uidre. 
Cumhall and Uirgreun are said to have fought the battle of Cnucha as 
rivals for the chieftainship of the Finns. Cumhall was slain in the strife. 
After his death his wife Muirenn gave birth to a son whom she named 
Deimne. “ Fiacail the son of Cuchuin, and Bodhmall the Druidess and 
Liath Luachra came to Muirenn and carried away the son, for his mother 
durst not keep him with her. Bodhmall and Liath taking the boy with them 
went to the forests of Sliabh Bladma where the boy was nursed secretly.” 
Enemies were eager to kill the child, and therefore the two women kept 
him long in retirement. After six years his mother came to visit her son 
and asked the heroines to take charge of him until he should be of 
heroic age; accordingly he was afterwards nursed by them till he was of 
fit age to go hunting. He went out on sundry expeditions, but returned 
from them to the two heroines. One day he joined some youths who were 
playing hurly, and won against them all; when they were describing him 
they called him jim (fair). On another occasion when they were swim- 
ming, they challenged him, and in return he drowned nine of them. Men

asked who drowned the youths, and the answer was that Fin (the Fair) 
drowned them. Ever after the name clung to the boy.t 
From the confused account of Gawain’s son in the Per- 
ceval,? with its obvious discrepancies, we can establish certain 
1 It is significant that in folk tales still preserved in Ireland Finn is represented 
as an illegitimate child, brought up by a supernatural woman. According to one 
version (see Kennedy, Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts, London, 1866, The 
Fight of Castle Knoc, p. 216) Cumhail and Conn are at strife, and in a battle 
between them Cumhail is defeated by the magic of the druid Tadg, whose hatred 
he has incurred because he has outraged Muirrean, the daughter of Tadg. On 
the eve of the battle, Cumhall summons Boghmin, his female runner, and tells her 
that when a son is born to Muirrean, she must carry him away to a spot where he 
shall be safe from the wrath of Tadg. Boghmin obeys, and with the help of 
“the sage woman Fiecal” brings the child up in secret in a cave of Slieve Bloom. 
She calls him Deimne. When he has grown older, he takes part in certain games 
at Tara. Conn asks the name of this Paustha Fion (fine youth). Boghmin 
replies that Fion shall be his name. A by-stander explains that he is Cumhall’s 
son, whereupon Boghmin seizes the child in her arms, and speeds away from her 
enemies so fleetly that none can overtake her. 
In another version, given by Campbell (How the Een was set up, III, 348), 
Cumhall is put to death by the jealousy of certain enemies, among them the king 
of Lochlann, whose sister is Cumhall’s mistress, and who commands that if a boy 
be born to Cumhall and the maiden, he shall be slain. On the night of Finn 
Mac Chumhail’s birth, his nurse flees with him to a desert place, and keeps him 
there until he has grown into a strong lad. She is disturbed by the fact that he 
is nameless, and goes to the town to try to find him aname. She sees some boys 
swimming, and bids the lad swim out into the loch and drown them. The bishop 
who is looking on asks who the “fair son” (#%ozm) is who is drowning the boys. 
“May he steal his name,’ said his nurse, ‘Fionn, son of Cumhall, son of Finn, 
son of every eloquence, son of Art, son of Eirinn’s high king, and it is my part to 
take myself away.’” The instant that he comes to shore, she puts him on her back, 
and hastens away with him. As their pursuers are about to overtake them, he 
leaps from his nurse’s back, and puts her about his neck holding her by the 
ankles. He dashes into a wood, and when he comes out has only the two shanks 
left. He throws them into a loch that he is passing, which is called thereafter Loch 
nan Lurgan, the Lake of the Shanks. Two great monsters grow from the shanks. 
Other versions of the story still survive and have been collected by J. G. 
Campbell (Z%e Fians, London, 1891, pp. 16 ff.) :— Finn is the illegitimate child of 
Cumhall and the daughter of an Ulster smith. Cumhall is slain in battle, and 
since his enemies, who have heard a report that his son will avenge his death, 
plan: to kill the child on his birth, Cumhall’s sister, Los Lurgann (Speedy Foot), 
takes the boy to the Ulster wood as soon as he is born. She has her brother, a 
joiner, build her a house in one of the trees with such skill that nobody can detect 
it. Then, to insure secrecy, she kills the joiner, and takes up her abode in the 
house with the child. When he has grown to be a lad, she teaches him feats in 
swimming, leaping, running. The rest of the story agrees with the preceding ver- 
sions. (See also The Fians, pp. 24 ff. Cf. Silva Gadelica, II, to1 ff.)

parallelisms with the story of Finn. An illegitimate child was 
born to Gawain and Gloriete, as to Cumhall and Murni of the Fair 
Neck. In both cases the mother’s kindred sought vengeance 
on the lover. Murni was disowned by her father, who even 
desired her to be burnt. In the Middle English poem, The 
Jeaste of Syr Gawayne,' there is given a version of the meeting 
and love between Gawain and the sister of Syr Brandles, which 
varies somewhat in details from that of the Perceval. Here 
we read that Syr Brandles, after having parted from Gawain, 
beats his sister with many stripes. 
Then the lady gate her a-waye, 
They sawe her never after that daye, 
She went wandrynge to and fro? 
From the story of Murni we may conjecture that the fate of 
this fair lady was originally similar to hers, and that the ver- 
sion adopted in the Perceval, which allows Gawain’s love to 
remain with her kindred and meet her lover again, even dwell 
with him in the castle of her brother, and finally ride off with 
him to Arthur’s court, is the result of the sophisticating tend- 
ency of which we have had examples. The story of Gawain’s 
son, then, in its introduction, is modelled upon essentially the 
same series of incidents found in that story of Finn which ante- 
dates the French romances; and it also contains an account of 
the lad’s supernatural training, which parallels features in the 
later Boyish Exploits? It would appear probable, therefore, that 
the training of the child by the other-world maiden formed a part 
of an early narrative, to the type of which the stories of both 
Finn and Gawain’s son conform. 
The relation of the three accounts of the boyhood of Guin- 
glain—the Desconus poems, Wigalois, and the Perceval — is 
extremely puzzling. We may presuppose that before the time 
of Renaud, there was told of Guinglain a story similar to that 
of Tyolet, in which the lad is brought up in seclusion by his 
mother, and watched over by a fay whose ami he is destined 
to be. Whether here the boy’s mother was a fay or a mortal

of Gawain’s son exclude the supposition that the Boyish Exploits was influenced 
by the latter.

maiden, we do not know. A misunderstanding might easily 
have represented the hero who was protected by a fay in his 
childhood, as the son of a fay. On the other hand, we may 
remember that in studying the fairy lore of the romances 
scarcely any element has more constantly to be taken into 
account than rationalization ; and an early story of Guinglain, 
in which he, the child of a mortal and a fay, was said to go 
forth in search of his unknown father, might easily have been 
rationalized into a type conforming with that of the Finn story, 
and known to us through the Perceval and the /easte of Syr 
Gawayne. It is in any case obvious that although neither the 
version of the Perceval nor that of the Bel Juconnu is based 
upon the other as its source, a pucele as blances mains and la 
puciele esgarée are substantially one and the same person, who 
represents the supernatural guardianship that watched over the 
life of the hero. The puciéle esgarée takes the child to her 
land, trains him herself to deeds of arms, just as Scathach 
instructs Cuchulinn, and keeps him with her defending her 
abode, as Scathach keeps Cuchulinn. Thus she fits him for a 
special adventure, the fight with Gawain, by means of which 
he learns the story of his birth. Unlike the fay of the Ile 
d’Or, however, she has no motive for her conduct, and the ele- 
ment of love does not enter into the account at all. The Per- 
ceval tells us nothing further of /a puciéle : she disappears from 
its pages when her mission is ended, that is, when the young hero 
whom she has fitted for his task in knighthood knows whose 
son he is. In this version, however, it should be observed, the 
machinery belongs to an old and common type, the fight between 
father and son ending in their recognition,! and from its very 
nature gives a more coherent story than does that adventure 
in the Bel Znconnu which leads to the knight’s knowledge of his 
true name. But, as we have seen, in the narrative of a hero, 
who was born as the son of Gawain was born, living without a 
name, called like Finn, the Fair One, like heroes of the French 
romances, Beau Fils, Bel Inconnu, Beau Valet, Beaudous, the 
interest of the story centres upon his meeting with his father,?

or learning his descent, and a fay, already introduced as his 
mistress, instead of fitting him only for the tests that shall 
prove his right to her love, gives him the training by which he 
shall learn his true history, or by which, as in the case of Finn, 
he shall regain what is his right by birth. 
With these examples of the ré/e of the guardian fay in 
romance before us, we may turn perhaps with greater interest 
to the versions of the up-bringing of Lancelot by the Dame du 
Lac. The earliest source in which the Dame du Lac is men- 
tioned by name is the French prose Lancelot. But in the 
Middle High German romance Lanzelet,1 by Ulrich von 
Zatzikhoven, the same personage apparently is designated as 
a merfeine or merminne ;: here, accordingly, we find the most 
primitive extant representation of the Dame du Lac. 
In Ulrich’s poem? King Pant of Genewis, whose territories are besieged 
by his enemies, is reduced to hopeless straits, and is compelled to leave the 
town, taking with him his wife and his son but one year old. Before they 
reach a place of refuge, the king dies from a mortal wound. While the 
queen seeks the shelter of a tree near at hand, a fay from the sea approaches, 
surrounded by a magical vapor (eine merfeine ... mit eime dunst als ein 
wint)*; she lifts the child up in her arms and bears him away to her own 
land. ez hat ein vrouwe genomen, 
ein wisiu merminne, 
diu was ein kiiniginne 
baz dan alle die nu sint4 , 
She rules over Meideland, a country where ten thousand maidens dwell, 
and where flowers and trees are in perpetual bloom. Her beautiful castle 
is built on a crystal mountain; the sea surrounds the land, which is pro- 
tected by an insurmountable wall; within neither jealousy nor anger is 
known, the maidens who dwell there are always blithe and merry, he who 
abides in the land a single day is happy so long as life lasts. Here the boy 
is carefully brought up by the lady, and trained in gentle bearing. When 
he is fifteen years old, he begs her to let him go where he may see tourneys 
and jousts, and entreats her to tell him who he is, for he has lived in com- 
_plete ignorance of his name and history. This latter request she assures 
him that she cannot grant, until he has overcome the redoubtable knight, 
Iweret von dem Schoenen Walde. The boy is filled with a desire to go 
out into the world and meet Iweret. The lady equips him with a beautiful 
horse and fitting accoutrements, sails with him across the sea, and gives 
him many parting instructions as to his conduct, before he mounts his

horse and spurs away from her to adventure. In the fulness of time he 
makes his way to the Schdtel le mort, the dwelling of Mabuz, the son of 
the merfeine, who, since it was predicted to her before his birth that he 
would always be a coward, has enchanted the castle so that every one who 
enters without the host’s permission must lose his valor. Iweret is a for- 
midable neighbor, who can easily despoil Mabuz of his possessions, and 
therefore the lady of the sea has destined her fosterling to slay him and 
free Mabuz. As the youth fares on his way after the battle in which he 
has defeated Iweret, he is met by a maiden, who comes from the queen 
of Meideland. Her mistress has sent her to tell him that his name is 
Lanzelet, and to acquaint him with the story of his origin. 
In Ulrich’s version, removed though it is in some respects from 
primitive conditions, we have a more consistently constructed, 
and certainly an earlier story than that given in our other 
source for Lancelot’s youth, the French prose Lancelot :1— 
King Ban of Benoic is besieged in Trebes by Claudas de la Deserte. 
By permission of Claudas he sets out from Trebes to seek aid from Arthur, 
taking with him his wife and his young son Lancelot, but on the way he 
dies. His wife, leaving Lancelot lying on the grass, hastens to the dying 
king, and when presently she returns, to her amazement she sees a maiden 
on the borders of the lake, caressing the child. To the queen’s entreaties 
that she give her back her son; the maiden does not reply a word, but springs 
into the lake with the boy in her arms and disappears beneath the waves. 
The Dame du Lac bears Lancelot off to her own dwelling, a gay abode 
filled with knights and ladies. It is in a forest; for the lake into which she 
plunged is only an illusion, which veils from the eyes of mortals the beauti- 
ful dwellings and winding streams that adorn the woods. Here she gives 
the child into the care of one of her maidens, and when he is fifteen years 
of age he is placed under the tutelage of a master, who teaches him to 
hunt, to ride, to play chess and draughts. He grows into great beauty and 
strength, and is called Beau trové, Riche orphelin, but by the Dame du Lac 
always Fils du Roi, although she carefully keeps his origin secret from him. 
When he is eighteen years old, she realizes that she should send him from 
her side to win knighthood. ' He returns from the chase one day to find her 
in tears. She bids him leave her, and convinced that he has offended her, 
he is mounting his horse, when she seizes his bridle, and forces him to 
admit that he was about to ride to Arthur’s court, where he might obtain 
knighthood. The lady at once tests his earnestness by telling him of the 
hard duties of knighthood, and proceeds to deliver him a long discourse on 
chivalry, explaining the qualities that a knight should have, the arms that he 
should bear, their symbolic meaning, and the knight’s obligations. Lance- 
lot’s desire for knighthood remains unabated, and the lady consents:to set

out with him to court. Attended by a brilliant retinue the Dame du Lac 
comes before the king, and begs as a boon from him that he knight the 
youth, but stipulates that she be allowed to give him his arms. She bestows 
many parting injunctions upon her fosterling, and bids him say, if asked 
his name, that the lady who brought him up kept him in ignorance of it. 
She slips on his finger a ring that has power to break all enchantments, 
foretells his achievement of marvellous adventures, and committing him to 
God, leaves him. : 
Briefly, then, Lancelot is a king’s son, deprived of his inherit- 
ance and separated from his parents by the fortunes of war, 
brought up in seclusion and in ignorance of his name and 
position by a supernatural power, whom he leaves to learn his 
descent and finally to regain his ancestral possessions. Thus 
he comes among the heroes whose history follows the so-called 
Aryan Expulsion-and-Return Formula. The persistent part 
of Lancelot’s story in romance, however, is that which deals 
with his relations to the supernatural lady who guards his 
career. We have already had to do with sufficient early fairy 
lore to make it needless to point out here the many indications 
that the French prose Lancelot? is affected by later influences 
than the Middle High German poem. There is, however, one 
important element in the German source that has no place 
in the French romance. The queen of Meideland cherishes 
Lancelot with a special design, — she wishes her son to be 
unspelled; for this achievement she trains her fosterling, 
and only upon the doing of this deed shall he win the longed- 
for knowledge of his own name, obviously not a primitive 
rendering, since the true fay who is supreme over enchantment 
does not require a knight for such a service as this. In 
the prose Lancelot the Dame du Lac has no personal object 
in caring for the boy, no ends of her own to gain, and no 
1 Cf. Nutt, Hol Lore Record, IV, formula facing p. 42. 
2 Such, for example, is the difference in the descriptions of the fay’s dwelling; 
in the Lancelot, where it is said to be in a forest veiled by a magic lake, the narra- 
tor evidently does not understand the Celtic Underwaves Land, and carefully 
explains that the lake into which the lady plunges is only an illusion (cf. Huth 
Merlin, 11, 150) ; while Ulrich represents Meideland as an other-world abode, which, 
since its queen is a merminne, was in his source doubtless placed beneath the 
waves. Such also are the details of the Dame du Lac’s manifestations of sorrow 
at the thought of her fosterling’s departure, and her discourse on the manifold 
obligations of knighthood. 
 
-P-A-G-E-200

designated quest for which to prepare him. After he has per- 
formed in part a subsequent adventure, the dispelling of the 
enchantment at the Douloureuse Garde,! in which he is assisted 
by the agency of the Dame du Lac, he learns his name; but his 
acquisition of the knowledge is not attributed to her power.? 
As in the case of Gawain’s son the story demands that the 
hero prove his valor in some way, before his father’s name 
shall be revealed to him; but the special adventure performed 
by Lancelot is irrelevant in that it has no obvious point in being 
the means by which he shall learn his origin. In short the story 
of the Dame du Lac has reached us at about the same stage of 
development as that of the puciéle esgarée. Each fay steals 
the child from his mother, and keeps him with her in her own 
land, giving him the training which will enable him to attain 
the coveted knowledge of his origin. Even as there is no hint 
of love between the fuciéle and Gawain’s son, so Lancelot 
occupies to the Dame du Lac purely the relation of a foster- 
ling. But for Renaud de Beaujeu we should be wholly ignorant 
of the love between Guinglain and his fairy protectress, and 
the mere fact that a relentless fate has not preserved to us a 
1 See Paris, R. 7. #., III, 154 ff. Lancelot, no long time after his knighting 
by Arthur, arrives before the impregnable castle known as La Douloureuse Garde, 
where mortals are kept imprisoned under enchantment. As he is trying to enter 
the first gate of the castle, a veiled maiden comes to him who dissuades him from 
the adventure, and when she finds that he will not listen to her, appears to leave 
him. At the end of a day of hard combat, Lancelot again finds the veiled maiden 
beside him ; she bids him rest for the night, and takes him to a chamber where 
she unarms him. Here she reveals herself as a messenger from the Dame du 
Lac, shows him three magic shields which the Dame du Lac has sent him, and 
assures him of the aid of her mistress in completing the adventure. During the 
bloody conflicts of the succeeding day, at every crisis when his strength is failing 
him, the maiden of the Dame du Lac appears beside him, slips one of the magic 
shields around his neck, and in spite of his remonstrances that thus she is detract- 
ing from the glory of his victory, insists upon replacing his helmet when it is 
broken with one that is better, and giving him a brighter sword than his own. 
Thus he wins the day and enters the Douloureuse Garde in triumph. When he 
has been welcomed by the inhabitants of the castle, he is conducted by them to a 
cemetery, in the middle of which he sees a great metal slab, bearing an inscription 
saying that only he who has performed the adventure of the castle can lift the 
metal slab, and that within he will find his name. Lancelot lifts it, and reads 
beneath it his own name, Ci reposera Lancelot du Lac, le fils au roi Ban 
de Benoic. The maiden is at his side, and promises to reveal the name to 
no one.

correspondingly early story for Lancelot does not necessarily 
lead to the conclusion that a more primitive type of fairy- 
guardian theme was never attached to his name. There are 
only two indications, however, that such may have been the 
case, and that originally the Dame du Lac may have been 
Lancelot’s amie. In Diu Créne, when the fidelity glove is 
brought to court, Lancelot fails in the test, and Kai is ready 
to declare with a taunt that thus it is revealed 
daz ir die gotinne, 
verkurt an ir minne, 
diu iu z6ch in dem sé. 
Our information is too scanty to base conclusions upon such 
a reference as this. Again, the main adventure related of 
Tyolet is told of Lancelot in a somewhat later form in the 
Dutch Lanzelet2 The quest of the white stag is proposed 
at Arthur’s court by a messenger from a distant princess: 
Lancelot is the successful knight, but declines the love of the 
fay for whom he has performed the adventure, because of his 
love for Guinevere. If we suppose that an early story akin to 
Tyolet was told of Lancelot, and that in it the Dame du Lac 
fitted the young knight for the adventure of the white stag, 
and was ready to reward him with her love, we can readily 
understand by a comparison with the Guinglain story that when 
Lancelot was brought into the number of those heroes who 
went out in quest of an unknown father, the element of love 
might be obscured, and the fairy training have for its object 
solely his ability to gain his desired end. In any case, almost 
inevitably the story of a fairy love would die out of the 
Lancelot material, after it became thoroughly permeated with 
his devotion to the queen, which we have repeatedly seen 
has the power to change the conclusions of episodes from their 
original form. 
A story parallel to the Lancelot and suggestive as to the 
relations of the hero to the fay is that of Floriant, contained 
in the thirteenth-century romance, Floriant et Florete.3

faithful retainer, and on the way gives birth to a son. While she and her

a nobleman’s son should know. When he reaches the age of fifteen years 
he comes to Morgain and begs her to tell him who his father is. Morgain 
recognizes this question as a sign that she cannot keep him longer with 
her. She tells him that his father is a king and his mother a king’s 
daughter, and on the next day she knights him and by a magic ship sends 
him with a rich equipment to the court of her brother Arthur. On his way 
thither Floriant stops at many points to achieve marvellous adventures, and 
arrives at court in time to win renown by brilliant victories in a tourney. 
After he has delivered his message from Morgain to Arthur, a maiden 
comes to him bearing a letter from Morgain, which reveals to him the story 
of his birth and tells him that his mother is besieged by Maragoz in 
the castle of her retainer. Aided by Arthur, Floriant sets forth to rescue 
her. Adventures and successes crowd upon him, and he not only raises 
the siege and frees his mother, but is made king of Palermo and ex 
passant falls in love with Florete, the daughter of the Emperor of Con- 
stantinople, and marties her. He lives prosperously in Palermo until one 
day in a hunt he pursues a white stag which leads him far away to a 
beautiful castle, through the door of which it dashes. Floriant follows, 
the stag disappears from view, and Floriant sees Morgain sitting on a 
couch. She tells him that he must die if she lets him remain longer 
on earth; therefore she has sent the white stag for him, and he never shall 
leave her. To make him happy she sends three fays to bring Florete also 
to dwell in Mongébel forevermore. 
Step by step the story of Floriant agrees with that of Lan- 
celot. In the circumstances of their birth, of their discovery 
by the fay, of their remaining in her land, of their knighting 
by Arthur, and of their final restoration to their ancestral 
thrones, the two heroes are alike. The differences are too 
great for us to regard Floriant as a mere redaction of the Lan- 
celot story, and it may rather be accepted as another working- 
over of a narrative of the same type, and as evidence of the 
way in which an original tale containing the return of the hero 
to the fairy mistress who has guarded him from infancy, is 
adapted to the additional themes related of the same hero. 
The romance plainly gives us an instance where a common

story has made its way into the Morgain saga, and Morgain, as 
I have said above, is here only a type.! 
It is unwise to dogmatize in regard to the exact stage of 
development at which an account of boyish exploits in fairyland 
was attached to Lancelot’s name. His name itself, Lancelot 
du Lac, which appears as early as Ulrich’s poem, is evidence 
of the importance in the Lancelot legend of his training by the 
Dame du Lac, which made it appropriate that the title of the 
protecting lady should be extended to the young knight who 
1A similar story is that of Maugis and the fay Oriande, told in the epic of 
Maugis d’ Aigremont, which belongs probably in the end of the thirteenth century 
(see Nyrop-Gorra, Storia dell’ Epopea francese, Turin, 1888, p. 177; cf. Hist. Litt., 
XXII, 704), and in which we should therefore expect to find romantic as well as 
epic material. The poem is accessible only through summaries. See //ist. Litt., 
XXII, 700 ff.; Keightley, Zales and Popular Fictions, London, 1834, pp. 343 ff. 
Tristan de Nanteuil (summarized Hist. Litt., XX VI, 234 ff.; Dunlop-Liebrecht, 
Pp- 143, @), one of the early fourteenth-century epics, contains further indications 
of the popularity of the exfances féerigues : — Tristan de Nanteuil, the infant son 
of Gui de Nanteuil and Eglantine, owing to various casualties attendant upon a 
storm that he and his parents experience at sea, is left alone in the boat which 
floats out over the waters. A siren follows it and rescues the child; a fisherman 
brings both the siren and Tristan to shore, and takes the siren captive. Tristan 
once more is left alone. He is found by a doe, who cares for him and brings him 
up in the woods. When he is sixteen years old he leaves the woods and wanders 
forth on adventure. \ 
The same theme has a place in the ballad of the Birth of St. George (Percy, 
Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, ed. Wheatley, London, 1877, III, 218 ff.), 
which is considered as in the main modern (see 76. 217; cf. Nutt, Folk Lore Record, 
IV, 32). The wife of Lord Albert of Coventry has a dream, the interpretation of 
which Lord Albert seeks with the weird lady of the woods, who tells him that his 
wife shall die at the birth of a son, who will be as dreadful to his foes as a dragon. 
Lord Albert returns to his castle to find his lady dead, and to learn the sad fate 
le that has befallen the new-born child: — in the past night thunder had rolled, 
lightning flashed, the castle had shaken, and the child was gone. Lord Albert 
in sorrow wandered far and wide. 
At length, all wearied, down in death 
He laid his reverend head. 
Meantime amid the lonely wilds 
His little son was bred. 
There the weird lady of the woods 
Had borne him far away, 
And traind him up in feates of arms, 
And every martial play. 
Cf. also, for a late version of the theme, the thirteenth-century German 
romance, Wigamdér (ed. Hagen and Biisching, Deutsche Gedichte des Mittelalters, 
Berlin, 1808, I, pp. 1 ff. of the poem; cf. pp. 41-44). Here Lespia, ain wildes wey 
(v. 112), steals Wigam(ir from his parents, and carries him to her home in the sea.

was brought up in fairyland.’ Throughout the career of Lance- 
lot the Dame du Lac occupies the ‘position of his protectress. 
Lancelot more than once when in peril has recourse to her ring 
for aid.2 Twice she heals his madness ;* she sends a fidelity 
mantle to court that brings honor to Iblis, his love ;* she com- 
forts the queen in her hours of separation from him ;°-by a 
messenger she even saves him from self-destruction in a moment 
of despair. Thus she is the guardian spirit of the hero’s life, 
guiding him at every point, protecting him in danger, present 
at every time of need.7

tended him at birth (see p. 194, note). Aiol, also, the son of Count Elie, who had 
been exiled by the king of France, was born and brought up in the forest of 
Bordeaux, and is said to have been named Aiol from the grant aiant, who with 
other savage creatures surrounded him at his birth (see Azo/, ed. Normand and 
Raynaud, Paris, 1877, vv. 64-68, 451, 452; p. v, note 1; Azol et Miradel, ed.

7 A few episodes (see Paris, . 7: R., II}, 56-68, 83-94, 281; IV, 136 ff.; V, 
202) represent the Dame du Lac as giving her care and protection to Lancelot’s 
cousins, Lionel and Bohor, the sons of Bohor de Gannes. These stories are doubt- 
less concocted simply for the purpose of extending the length of an already long 
romance. They have no important bearing on the nature of the Dame du Lac. 
The Dame du Lac learns that the sons of Bohor, the brother of Ban, are 
deprived of their inheritance and kept in confinement by Claudas de la Deserte. 
She determines to rescue them, and sends one of her maidens, Sarayde by name, 
to the court of Claudas with full instructions as to how the rescue shall be achieved. 
Sarayde, leading two hounds, enters the hall where Claudas sits at meat, and induces 
him to summon the lads to his presence. When they stand before the king she 
covers them with chaplets of flowers, and passes about their necks chains of gold 
and precious stones, the magic power of which instantly drives them to a frenzy, 
and in the general mé/ée that follows she shifts their shapes and those of the 
hounds, and leaving the supposed youths to the mercy of Claudas, makes her 
escape with the real youths in hound shape. She conducts them to the dwelling 
of the Dame du Lac, where they are brought up under her tender care with the 
young Lancelot. She resolves to keep them under her protection even after they 
leave her domain (Paris, R. 7. &., III, 56-68, 83-94). Later (é., 281) we read 
that she sends Lionel to Galehaut for training in knightly accomplishments, and 
still later (7., IV, 136 ff.; V, 202) we find an account of the protection afforded 
Bohor in combat by Sarayde, who comes as a messenger from the Dame du Lac.

be remembered that the fay is never a disinterested actor. 
Her influence on the hero’s life is for the gratification of her 
own love for him. With this principle in mind, although the 
sources discussed in this chapter present many unsolved prob- 
lems, they serve to establish at least a few facts in regard to the 
fairy guardian of romance. It is consistent with our knowledge 
of the Celtic fay to believe that originally when she exercises 
protection over a child, it is because she has destined him for 
her loved one when he shall have attained heroic years,! and 
1 Although the part of the fay as the instructress of the young hero whom she 
has guarded in his infancy rests upon a true Celtic foundation, her vé/e offers a point 
of contact with that of the Parcae and the Norns, who preside over the birth of a 
child and weave his destiny for him; this may perhaps account for the frequent 
occurrence in romance of stories in which fays play directly the part played by the 
Parcae in other sources. The resemblance between the Parcae and Norns on the 
one hand, and the fays of French romance on the other has been frequently noted. 
See e.g. Grimm, D. JZ, I, 332 ff.; Maury, pp. 26, 29, 66 ff. Cf. especially 
for the influence of the conception of the Parcae on that of the Norns, Bugge- 
Schofield, Home of the Eddic Poems, London, 1898, pp. 79 ff., 97 ff., 105, 106.

In the romance of Amadas et Ydoine (ed. Hippeau, Paris, 1863, vv. 1979 ff., 2043- 
2304), in fact, fays are clearly identified with the Parcae. The fair Ydoine, who 
has been parted from her lover Amadas, in great distress on the eve of her com- 
pulsory marriage to the Count of Nevers consults three sorceresses as to what 
means she shall adopt to remain faithful to her true lover. They assume the 
beles figures de fées and as Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos cast a spell upon the Count 
so that he does not know whether he is asleep or awake. They proceed to pre- 
pare a repast by his bedside, and as they sit and dine, in order to deter him from 
the wedding they talk over together the unhappy destiny that they have given 
Ydoine at birth. A few late French sources show more distinctly the union in 
the fay of the Parcae who give the child his destiny at birth, and the Celtic fairy 
mistress who destines for her own love the young knight whom she rears. For 
an illustration see Brun de la Montaigne, p. xi, note 2:—In the night that Ogier 
was born, when his mother died, six fays came to the bed where he was lying and 
with caresses each gave him qualities worthy of a hero’s desire ; Morgain was the 
last of the number to speak, and she decreed that Ogier should never meet death 
by the hand of man, and that he should see all her joys in faerie where he should 
dwell as her lord and her beloved (cf. also the Exfances Garin de Montglane, 
in which Morgain appears with two other fays at the birth of Garin and gives 
him gifts. See Gautier, Zp. Fr., IV, 111). 
In Brun de la Montaigne (vv. 430-1357, 1859-2021, 2744-2874), an obviously 
late representation of the fay as the protectress of children is given. Butor de la

that she therefore prepares him especially for an adventure that 
will lead him to her. As a development from her original 
characteristic, when the circumstances of the hero’s life empha- 
sized by narrative demand an alteration of her part, she trains 
him for any great adventure which she knows awaits him ; thus 
she loses her character as fairy mistress. An extremely com- 
mon and early narrative theme, not founded upon the conven- 
tions of fairyland, but upon human social conditions, represents 
the child of a maiden and a hero who has met her when away 
from his home, and has left her after a brief sojourn, as brought 
up in retirement by his mother and in ignorance of his father, of 
whom he later goes in quest. This story is naturally made the 
history of a youth who is the offspring of a mortal and his fairy 
love, whom he had met in her distant land and had left to return 
to earth. Thus the mother who brings up the child in seclu- 
sion is a fay. Probably the two types of narrative, that in 
which the fay is the lad’s protecting fairy mistress, and that 
Montaigne exposes his newborn son in the forest of Bersillant, that he may receive 
a destiny from the fays. Three fays come singing to the fountain beside which 
the child is lying, and two in turn endow him with gifts, the third with misfortune 
in love. One of the others at once promises him comfort in his misfortunes. 
Very soon the same fay comes to the castle of Butor and offers herself as a nurse 
for Brun. For many years she takes care of him, coming and going unseen by 
mortal eye between the castle and Bersillant. When Brun is fifteen years old she 
tells him that he will soon become a lover, that she must leave him for ten years, 
during which time he will be engrossed with his first love; when, however, this 
love, which will be unhappy, shall be over, she will come to him and he shall love 
the most beautiful maiden in the world. The story is incomplete, but in the light 
of the other stories that we have examined it is fair to suppose that the fay herself 
sought Brun’s love. 
The romance of Galien 1i Restorés (st. xv-xxx) furnishes a particularly good 
example for comparison with the stories of Finn and Guinglain. It is evidently 
modelled upon the same type as they, but the part of the fay who tends the hero 
has become attenuated into the part of the fay who simply gives a destiny to the 
child. Galien is the illegitimate child of Jacqueline, the daughter of the emperor 
Hugo, and Olivier. After Olivier leaves Jacqueline to return to France, her father 
drives her from his home before the birth of her child, and she takes refuge with 
a kindly cottager. Back of the cottager’s house by a fountain her child is born. 
The fays, Galienne and Esglantine, come to guard the mother and to bless the 
child. Both give it good gifts, and Galienne declares that it shall be called by her 
name. Galien is brought up at the castle of his great-uncle ; when he is old enough 
he goes to his grandfather’s court, where his beauty and prowess win him applause, 
and his grandfather gladly learns that the lad is his own grandson. When Galien 
hears from his mother that his father is Olivier, he sets forth in quest of him.

in which she is his mother, influenced each other, and pro- 
duced confusion in narrative, even as the stories of the Per- 
ceval type in which a hero is brought up -by a mortal mother 
in the forest, and those in which he is the fosterling of a fay 
know no sacred line of demarcation. Narratives such as those 
of Perceval, Fergus, Alisander |’Orphelin, Sir Gowther, and 
many others all show the immense popularity of the so-called 
enfances humaines, and the prosaic influences by which they 
became modified. We have seen, too, the great popularity of 
the enfances féeriques, and again, as in the youth of Tyolet, 
Guinglain, and Finn, we have found the two types blended. 
Despite the interlacing of the themes we may be reasonably 
sure that the fairy guardian and fairy mother are both derived 
from the original Celtic fairy ae

MORGAIN AND THE DAME DU LAC 
In the Prophecies! a comparison between Morgain and the 
Dame du Lac is instituted by Merlin, who having felt the attrac- 
tions of both fays might presumably speak with authority. The 
Dame du Lac, he says, possesses greater natural gifts and a 
more subtle art than any woman in the world. Morgain is 
the child of passion and fire; the fair Dame du Lac was born 
near to Paradise. Morgain seeks to work evil, the Dame du 
Lac good. Morgain to kill knights, the Dame du Lac to help 
them. Morgain is the enemy of orphans; the Dame du Lac 
has nurtured Lancelot and his two orphan cousins. This con- 
trast between his two loves observed by Merlin is manifested 
throughout the romances, where in their relations to Lancelot, 
Guinevere and Arthur, Morgain and the Dame du Lac are fre- 
quently represented as opposing forces. 
In the case of Lancelot the situation is to be expected. Mor- 
gain’s hostility to him, we have seen, was a secondary devel- 
opment in tradition, the outcome of her hatred of Guinevere, 
and after she once had taken her place in romance as the 
fay who constantly sought to harm him, the Dame du Lac, 
ac Pees
-P-A-G-E-208
196 La Dame du Lac 
Lancelot’s guardian, naturally was represented as ready to foil 
her designs. Owing to a promise that Morgain has extracted 
from him, Lancelot loses his reason, and in his madness wanders 
through the land.; The Dame du Lac seeks him far and wide, 
and when at last she finds him in the forest of Tintagel, she 
takes him to her dwelling, and cares for him until his reason 
is restored, then equips him with a horse and armor, and sends 
him to Camelot, with the prediction that he shall rescue the 
queen from the land whence none has ever returne(l} In the 
Prophecies the Dame du Lac is said to dread Morgain’s evil 
designs against her fosterlings, and is in fact warned against 
Morgain by a certain widow of the forest. 
The difference between the attitude of the two fays toward 
Guinevere is also to be explained from the early stories 
connected with each. We have followed the process by which 
the wrath of Morgain towards the queen became an established 
element in the Morgain saga. In the Lamnzelet, in which Lance- 
lot is not represented as the queen’s lover, the Dame du Lac 
accords her favor to Iblis, his wife.2 Even so in the later 
versions, where the element of a fairy-mistress love does not 
appear, her affection for Guinevere, the lady beloved by Lancelot, 
is a necessary consequence of her devotion to him. Hence the 
Dame du Lac and Morgain are ever working at cross purposes 
in their contact with Guinevere, Morgain constantly endeav- 
oring to thwart her love, the Dame du Lac to encourage it.? 
1 See Lancelot, Il, \xxvii; Paris, R. 7. R., V, 3-5. In consideration of the 
parallel that we have already seen exists between Camille and Morgain (see 
pp. 97 ff.), it should be noticed that after Lancelot is released by Camille from 
imprisonment, he wanders about in a state of madness, until he makes his way to 
the quarters of the king. The queen takes him under her care, and discovers 
that she can calm his frenzy by hanging about his neck the shield given her by the 
Dame du Lac (see below, note 3); when it is removed, his madness returns. One 
day a fair lady, silken clad, attended by knights and maidens, arrives in the hall. 
She is taken by the queen to Lancelot’s chamber ; she calms him by greeting him 
as Beau trové, and tells him that she has come from afar to heal him. She 
anoints him with a soporific salve, directs the queen to prepare a bath for him, 
from which he will emerge completely restored, and commands him always to 
wear her shield. Then she hastens away to her own ami. See Paris, R. 7: R., 
IV, 65 ff.; cf. below, p. 201. Cf. also the healing of Yvain by Morgain’s oint- 
ment, below, pp. 267, note 2, 272. 2 See p. 119.

The relations of Morgain and the Dame du Lac to Guinevere 
and Lancelot rest upon a fundamental part of the tradition of 
each fay. This is not the case in the attitude of the Dame du 
Lac to Arthur. There is a curious inconsistency in the 
traditions in which they are brought together, for although she 
is in reality always opposed to him when she is aiding and 
abetting the love of Lancelot for the queen, she appears 
frequently as a power who prevents Morgain’s hostile designs; 
against the king. She rescues him, as we know, from Mor- 
gain’s machinations in the fight with Accalon, in the story 
of the enchantress, which is probably in its origin a Morgain 
episode, and also in the scene with the messenger of the 
damoisele de Vile faée,1in which she tells Arthur that she came to 
the land simply to protect him, and asks no further reward than 
that he cherish knighthood as he has ever cherished it.? ie 
Morgain flings the scabbard of Excalibur into the lake to. pre- 
vent Arthur from regaining it, she tells her damsels that she can 
work no harm to the king, so surrounded is he by the enchant- 
ment of a maiden who has come to the land to protect him? 
“The damoysel of the lake,’ says Malory, “... euer she dyd 
grete goodenes vnto kynge Arthur | and to alle his knytes thurgh 
her sorcery and enchauntementes.”* Morgain, on the contrary, 
as we know, hates her brother and the knights of the Round 
Table. ‘Kynge Arthur and she have ben at debate and stryfe 
... | And euer as she myght she made werre on kynge Arthur | 
And alle daungerous knyghtes she withholdeth with her for to 
destroye alle these knyghtes that Kynge Arthur loueth.” > 
A plausible reason for the situation is that the Dame du Lac 
attained prominence as a guardian fay in the Lancelot story, 
and has become so far a type of fairy protectress that her care 
is made to include Arthur also; and that just as Morgain is ’ 
make use of a symbolic shield, Morgain with evil purpose against Lancelot and 
Guinevere, the Dame du Lac for their benefit; see Léseth, §§ 190, 191 ; Malory,

regularly associated with malign influences, so the Dame du Lac 
came to be regarded as her foil in incident as well as in nature. 
A possible explanation, too, is afforded by the story of Excalibur, 
the famous sword supplied to Arthur according to the Huth 
Merlin and Malory? from the depths of a lake, and coveted by 
Morgain, who makes every effort to win it from him :— 
Arthur feels the need of a trusty sword. Merlin leads him to a lake that 
is the abode of fays, and tells him that beneath its waters lies a sword 
destined for him. Even as they speak, Arthur sees in the middle of : 
the lake an arm clothed in white samite, lifting up a sword in its hand. A 
maiden rides up to them,at that moment, and tells Arthur that he shall have 
the sword if he will promise her a boon which she will ask when she wishes. 
Arthur gladly makes the promise, and she speeds over the water with 
dry feet, takes the sword from the hand, which immediately disappears, and 
gives it to the king. [In JJalory, the damsel is seen by Arthur “ going 
upon the lake”; she bids him row out to the hand and take the sword and 
scabbard.] The sword pleases Arthur as he gazes at it, but Merlin tells 
him that the scabbard is worth more than the sword, for while he has the 
scabbard on him he shall lose no drop of blood. 
~~" We have nowhere any direct evidence that Arthur’s sword 
came from the Dame du Lac herself. Excalibur is always an 
other-world-gift, whether Arthur draws it from an anvil of iron 
set in a stone, or-whether he takes it from the land beneath the. 
waves. His final casting of it into the lake before his death, 
however, is a persistent tradition, that is thoroughly in keeping 
with the story of its origin in the land under waves. For 
example, Cuchulinn’s marvellous other-world horses, Liath 
Macha (the Gray of Macha) and Dubhsaighlenn (Black Sain- 
glenda), rise before him from the waters of a lake, and after 
a brief struggle are mastered by his powerful hand. At 
Cuchulinn’s death the Black dashes from the battle-field back to 
the lake from which he came, and plunges into its depths, 
making the surface seethe and boil; the Gray, wounded earlier 
in the fight, bids his master farewell, and returns to the waters 
from which he had risen.’ The tradition that ascribes a lake

beautiful fay Marsique gave it to him when he was about to do battle for her 
against the enchanter Naborn; but when the battle was over, Gawain had the 
scabbard no longer and he knew not what became of it. Auth Merlin, Il, 222.

We read of other marvellous swords in Celtic material that came from the 
fairy realm under the sea. Manannan, the son of Ocean, according to the Oided 
mac n Uisnig or The Death of the Sons of Usnech,a tale of the tenth century, 
fashioned a wonderful sword, the stroke of which never failed and which could cut 
off the heads of three heroes with one blow (see Ep. Celt, 1,217). Arthur’s sword 
belongs to the same class of weapon as the Sword of Light, which is a common 
object in modern Celtic tales. Excalibur is distinguished for extraordinary bril- 
liancy :— “ The picture of two snakes was on the sword in gold. And when the 
sword was drawn out of its sheath, it looked as if two flames of fire broke out of 
the jaws of the snakes” (see Madinogion, I, 405; cf. Stephens, Literature of the 
Kymry, London, 1876, p. 184; English Merlin, pp. 118, 339, 476; Malory, III, 
36; cf. also the magic sword of Socht which shone at night like a candle, Stokes 
and Windisch, III, i, 199, 218; the magic sword on Solomon’s ship, Hucher, Ze

v. 202; La Queste del Saint Graal, ed. Furnivall, London, 1864, pp. 182 ff.). 
The Sword of Light in modern Celtic stories is a favorite object of an other- 
world quest, and in the tale of Art and Balor Beimenach it must be sought in 
Under Wave Land (see Curtin, Hero Tales of Ireland, Boston, 1894, pp. 325 ff. ; 
cf. below, p. 201, note; Larmenie, West Lrish Folk-Tales and Romances, London, 
1893, pp- 10 ff.; Mac Innes and Nutt, p. 123. I owe the above references to Dr. 
A.C. L. Brown). For magic weapons destined to perform a certain deed see

Celtic swords that speak cf. especially the description of Skéfnung, 2., p. xvii; 
see also p. xvi. 
A strange sequel to the story of Arthur’s finding of Excalibur is given in the 
Huth Merlin (I, 213 ff.) and Malory (Bk. II, ch. i, 2; II, 3): A lady that is 
called the Lady of the Lake comes to Arthur’s court, and demands the head 6f-a 
certain damsél and also the head of the knight Balin, as the boon that Arthur 
had promised her when she gave him the sword. Balin smites off her head in 
the presence of the king, and explains that by her enchantment she has vo

du Lac came to be regarded in story as the giver of Arthur’s 
marvellous sword, she might naturally be depicted as bestowing 
her protecting care upon him, and therefore as standing in 
opposition to Morgain in her relations to him. Such a situa- 
tion would make it easy to understand why Morgain specially 
covets Excalibur, and why when there was attached to Arthur 
the common folk-lore theme, which we meet, to cite two 
familiar examples, in Hermes’ theft of Apollo’s cattle and in 
Thor’s loss of his hammer at the hands of the giant Thrym, 
the other-world being who stole his most precious possession 
should be Morgain.! 
the enemy of many good knights. Arthur banishes Balin from the court, buries 
the Lady of the Lake richly, and makes great dole. This damsel of the Lake is 
plainly not the Dame du Lac who reared Lancelot. The episode is merely a part 
of a story the interest of which centres in Balin’s successful ungirding of a magic 
sword from a damsel’s girdle; doubtless the feature of the sword has induced 
the author of the Huth Merlin, or his source, to make the particular fay, whose 
part in the story is to furnish a reason why Balin must leave the court and proceed 
to other adventures, the fay who was supposed to have given Arthur his wonder- 
ful sword. The story affords a hint of the ease with which te Lady of the Lake 
and any lady of the lake might become identified. Cf. Paris, 2. 7. R., III, 162 ff., 
passim, 172: the attendant of the Dame du Lac is called Za demoisele du lac. 
~ 1See Huth Merlin, 1, 199, 267 ff.:— Arthur, before he-has lost confidence in 
Morgain, gives into her keeping the sword and scabbard, explaining to her the 
magic power of the scabbard, and charging her to guard it well. Tempted, how- 
ever, by the wish of a lover of hers at court she decides to keep the enchanted 
scabbard for him and has a duplicate made to give Arthur. By an awkward mis- 
take the scabbards arefexchanged ; the lover receives the duplicate, and finding it 
worthless, under the conviction that Morgain has deceived him, he tells the king 
that he is protected by a magic scabbard, which Morgain has given him bidding 
him slay the king. Arthur resolves to punish Morgain Sick she leaves 
the court, enjoining Merlin to tell Arthur that the sword and scabbard have been 
stolen from her, and that she has fled in fear of her brother’s wrath. When 
, Arthur hears hermessage he kills her treacherous lover, and restores the scabbard to 
herikeeping. Morgain next makes use of Excalibur in the fight between Accalon 
\and Arthur. (Cf. the story that Morgain causes Tristan’s death by the same lance 
with which he has killed her lover Huneson, Léseth, pp. 137, 374, 382, 384)- 
Malory (Bk. II, ch. 11) connects the account of the scabbard directly with the 
story of Accalon:— 
“Soo after for grete trust Arthur betoke the scauberd to Morgan le fay his 
syster | and she loued another knyght better than her husband kynge Vryens or 
kynge Arthur. And she wold haue had Arthur her broder slayne | And ther for she 
lete make another scauberd lyke it by enchauntement and gaf the scauberd Excali- 
bur to her loue | and the knyghtes name was called Accolon that after had nere 
slayne kyng Arthur.” 
The two stories contained in the Huth Merlin are simply variants of the same 
theme. At the end of the first story it is necessary that the weapon be restored

IV 
CONFUSIONS IN THE TRADITION OF THE DAME DU LAC 
There remain to be mentioned a few other stories in which 
the Dame du Lac is conspicuous. In several sources she is 
identified with Niniane, the love of Merlin. This is a concep- 
tion of her part that apparently diverges widely from the 
original type. It cannot be understood until a study of 
Niniane herself has been made, and therefore a discussion of 
it must be reserved for a later chapter.! 
We find the Dame du Lac in two situations that cannot 
be connected in any way with her 7é/e in the youthful exploits 
of Lancelot. In the Prophecies? she is represented as the 
amie of Meliadus, whom she reluctantly conducts to the cave 
in which she has entombed Merlin, where he hears Merlin’s 
condemnation of her and in fact of all women because of her 
deed. We have seen elsewhere® that Meliadus was said to be 
beloved by a fay who lured him to her by a druidic stag; and 
it is quite possible that after the Dame du Lac became 
conspicuous in story as an important fay her title was bestowed 
to Morgain’s keeping, since she is to use it again in the second episode. Here 
the author simply grafts the sword episode upon the conclusion of the enchantress 
story. The confusion in the parts played by the sword and scabbard in the two 
variants is doubtless due to the accepted and persistent tradition of Arthur’s final 
casting of Excalibur into the lake before his death (see the sources mentioned 
above, p. 36, note 1), which made it necessary that the sword itself should be left 
at the end of the story in his possession ; consequently it is only the scabbard that 
he can lose at Morgain’s hands. 
In one of the modern Celtic tales (see Curtin, Hero Tales of Ireland, Boston, 
1894, pp. 254 ff.) recounting a quest for the Sword of Light, the hero Coldfeet is 
returning from the Lonesome Island, the proud possessor of the Sword of Light, 
in search of which he has gone thither. He finds welcome for a night in a certain 
house, but while he sleéps the woman of the house exchanges the Sword of Light 
for an old, worthless weapon. Coldfeet eventually regains the magic sword. , It 
is evidently such a theme as is represented in this story, which the author of the 
Huth Merlin gives us worked into his long narrative. The other-world weapon 
that the hero has sought is stolen from him by one whom he has trusted, and a 
worthless substitute put in its place. A somewhat similar device on the part of 
Morgain has been already mentioned in the story of her exchange of the queen’s 
ring for her own on the sleeping Lancelot’s finger, while he is her prisoner (see 
p. 98, note 2).

  202 La Dame du Lac 
upon the love of Meliadus. There may have been connected 
with Meliadus a fairy-guardian story of the type that we have 
been examining in this chapter, which the author of the 
Prophecies knew :— 
Meliadus is the illegitimate child of the Queen of Scotland and King 
Meliadus. His mother to escape discovery has the child put on board 
a vessel and sent out to sea. When the boat drifts ashore, the mother 
of the Dame du Lac takes the infant under her care, and brings him up as 
her own son. Merlin tells Meliadus the story of his birth, and bids him, if 
he would confirm the truth of it, go to a certain chapel where he will find 
a stone bearing an inscription that repeats the same tale.t 
The source is too late and too untrustworthy for us to attach 
much importance to it. The other episode to which I have 
referred is the story of Pelleas and Ettard, which, so far as 
I am aware, is known only through Malory,? and which is 
foreign to the legend of the Dame du Lac and also, as we shall 
see below, to that of Niniane. It apparently became attached 
to either or both of these personages in consequence of some 
confusion, after they had become prominent fays in romance. 
We may unhesitatingly classify the Dame du Lac as a true 
Celtic fay from Tir na n-Og, belonging to the same family of 
other-world beings as the father of Tydorel,? as Aalardin del Lac, 
and the puciéles des puis. In her function in story she is to be 
placed beside Scathach, Bodhmall, and Speedy Foot, the puczéle 
esgarée, the pucele as blances mains, and the daughter of 
the king of Logres. But the Dame du Lac differs from all 
of these fays in one respect. A vague personality at first, 
merely the lady who nurtured Lancelot and dwelt in the fairy- 
land beneath the waves, undoubtedly because her fosterling

2 Bk. IV, ch. 22, 23 : — Sir Pelleas loves the proud lady, Ettard, who scornfully 
spurns his love. Gawain undertakes to win Ettard for Pelleas, but in reality 
gains her love for himself. Pelleas surprises the lovers together, and learns that 
he has lost his lady and that his friend is faithless. The damsel of the lake, 
Nimue, when she hears the story of his sufferings, by her enchantment makes the 
lady Ettard mad with love for Pelleas, while she causes Pelleas to hate Ettard and 
to love herself. He goes with her where she bids him. ‘So the lady Ettard died 
for sorrow, and the damsel of the lake rejoiced Sir Pelleas, and loved together 
during their life days.” On this episode cf. Arthurian Legend, pp. 284 ff. ; below,

attained popularity as a hero, she came to be regarded as the 
type of a divine protectress, and as a preéminently gentle and 
beneficent being. It is quite plain that she and Lancelot are 
fundamentally united in story, and that when she is associated 
in tradition with other personages, as with Guinevere and 
Arthur, the connection is due to a development from her 
original relation to Lancelot, and to the fact that she had 
become prominent, in Malory’s words, as “the chief lady 
of the lake.”

CHAPTER XIII 
NINIANE AND MERLIN 
Our study of Morgain and the Dame du Lac has shown us 
that there is attached to each of them a variety of episodes which 
are either developments from an early story, or contain themes 
that are perfectly consistent with the early conception of each 
being. In the material that deals with Niniane, or Vivien as 
she is more familiarly called, we find on the contrary only one 
important story, the “tale of Merlin and the lovely fay,” made 
so familiar to us all by Tennyson and Matthew Arnold that we 
scarcely need pause here to recall its outline. It tells how 
Merlin met and loved the forest maiden of Brittany, how he 
taught her all his art as an enchanter, and how by the charms 
learned from him she bespelled him into an endless sleep. This 
same story forms the principal episode related of Niniane even 
in our earliest sources. There her romantic connection with 
Merlin is the subject of the only prominent incident in her life, 
and her real activity in the French romances is limited to the 
scene of Merlin’s enchantment. Nevertheless she has become 
the victim of a confusion in legend, which is at first perplexing 
to the student of her nature. In minor episodes and occa- 
sionally in those that contain the account of Merlin’s love, she 
is, as I have said in the preceding chapter, identified with the 
Dame du Lac; except in the story of Pelleas and Ettard, how- 
ever, in all those which are not connected with Merlin’s love 
the fay plays a part that is consistent with the essential nature 
of the Dame du Lac, though not with the traits of Niniane 
as we shall find them emphasized in the principal story told of 
her. It seems probable, therefore, that these episodes repre- 
sent a stage of tradition when two fays, originally distinct, had 
become identified, and Niniane’s name attached to the Dame 
du Lac, to whom the stories properly belong. Evidently, then, 
in studying Niniane, we are seeking to discover the fundamental 
traits of a fay who has practically no independent existence in 
204
-P-A-G-E-217
| Niniane and Merlin 205 
romantic material outside of her relations to Merlin. That the 
story of Merlin’s love for her was highly popular is attested 
by its appearance in ten sources; these it will be convenient 
to study here grouped in three classes according to their 
resemblances. 
| I 
The first class (Class A) is formed by the Merlin romances 
(exclusive of the Huth Merlin and the Prophecies), Le Rot 
Artus,and Livre d’Artus, P All follow the same general out- 
line, but the Merlin romances give the complete story of 
Merlin’s meeting with Niniane, his instruction of her in magic 
arts, and his eventual confinement by her power. 
The scene is laid by a fountain in the forest of Briosque, a favorite 
haunt of Niniane, the beautiful daughter of Dionas, a vavasour of high 
lineage. Hither one day Merlin, assuming the guise of a fair young squire, 
takes his way, wins a gentle greeting from the maiden, and explains to her 
that he is the pupil of a wise master who has given him instruction in the 
magic art. He himself, he assures her, knows how to build a castle in the 
air, how to walk on the water without wetting the soles of his feet, how to 
make a river flow over a dry plain, and how to perform even greater won- 
ders. Niniane, dazzled by such genius, exclaims that if Merlin will show 
her some of these marvels she will become his love save toute vilenie, and 
receives Merlin’s ready promise for so rich a reward to teach her all that 
she wishes to learn.?_ Forth from the forest he summons by enchantment a 
merry band of knights and ladies ; he spreads before the delighted maiden’s 
eyes a smiling garden; jongleurs sing cavo/es about a magic circle that he 
draws, young knights tilt and dance gaily off with fair maidens under the 
spreading trees. At sunset the illusions vanish,? and Niniane is ready to 
declare that Merlin can ask nothing too great for her to grant him, after he 
shall have taught her all of his art that she wishes to know. He at once 
gives her a lesson in magic, and leaves her, promising to return on the eve 
of St. John and teach her more. At the appointed time Niniane keeps 
tryst with him by the fountain, and leads him secretly to her chamber. 
Fearing the excess of his love, by many blandishments she induces him to

Merlin, pp. 307-312, 378, 565, 607, 634, 679-681, 692-694 ; Merlin (1528), I, cxlv, 
exlvi; II, cxxvi, cxxvii; Paris, R. 7. &., I, 174-181, 334; Livre ad’ Artus, P., 
§§ 17, 30, 67, 85, 87, 89 ff., ror, 130, 136. 
2 Livre d’Artus, P.: — Merlin merely tells Niniane that he is skilled in 
necromancy, and will display his art to her on condition that she grant him 
her love. 
8 These details are omitted in Livre ad’ Artus, P.
-P-A-G-E-218
  206 Niniane and Merlin 
show her how to keep a man asleep at her pleasure. She protects herself 
further against him by inscribing on her flesh magic words that deprive 
him of the power to draw near her except in accordance with her will; she 
deludes him by laying an enchanted pillow in his arms, that casts him into 
a deep sleep. 
Merlin’s visits to Niniane are frequent.2 He becomes “the victim of a 
slowly enfeebling infatuation,” and gradually imparts to her more and more 
of his magic art,® teaching her all that she asks to know. Then she plans 
to withstand him forever. She would keep him with her always, and by 
flattery and beguiling pictures of the beautiful spot that she will fashion 
where they alone shall dwell in happiness, she induces him to show her how 
to confine a man sans tour & sans mur & sans fer par enchantement. 
One day as they sit beneath a white-thorn bush in Broceliande, Niniane 
lulls Merlin to sleep. With her girdle she makes a magic circle nine times 
about the sleeper ; when he wakes he is in the fairest. tower in the world, 
which only Niniane can destroy. She dwells with him, but goes in and out 
at her own will. Later Sir Gawain riding through Broceliande hears a 
voice, but sees only a thick mist before him. The voice is Merlin’s address- 
ing him from the walls of air, saying that by her to whom he had taught 
much he has been enclosed here never to come forth. 
The story falls naturally into three divisions, of which the 
first and third are characteristic of Class A alone:— The 
exhibition of magic given by Merlin before Niniane to stir her 
love; Niniane’s subsequent acquisition of necromancy ; Nini- 
ane’s imprisonment of Merlin in the castle of air. 
It was no unusual occurrence in story for an enchanter to 
give a voluntary exhibition of his power to arouse admira- 
tion or faith on the part of the beholder; and more than one 
instance affords reason to believe that this feature of the 
Merlinand Niniane story belongs with the body of floating tales 
which are found attached now to one magician and now to 
another.* An excellent illustration of this is offered by the story 
1In the Livre d’Artus, P., Niniane learns from Merlin how to produce a sleep 
that shall last at her pleasure, and how to summon him to her when she wishes. 
She tries to protect herself by casting him into a sleep.

of Guinebaut,! which Paulin Paris regarded as a simple variant 
of the story of Niniane and Merlin.? It is clear from our pre- 
vious examination of the Guinebaut theme that it stands nearer 
the early Celtic material, from which the Merlin episode 
could not be a direct development. In this latter there is no 
question of the carole serving as a means to keep mortals in a 
land without return, for its purpose with that of the other illu- 
sions is accomplished when they have excited Niniane’s love. 
It is simply an other-world feature reproduced by magic art, 
and represents the application of a common theme to two 
different stories, as well as to two different enchanters. 
The second visit of Merlin to Niniane, in which he 
instructs her in the magic art, is also treated at some length in 
Class A. The episode consists of a series of Niniane’s devices 
to protect herself against Merlin’s passion and to gain the 
knowledge that she desires, all of which, like the illusions 
produced by the enchanter, may be said to belong to the stock 
in trade of a narrator dealing with magic themes.’ It is of 
by nine waves, and rises on the tenth with dry chest (cf. Sébillot, Gargantua, 
Paris, 1838, p. 37); Huth Merlin, I, 198, 201: —A fay passes over the water to 
fetch Excalibur to Arthur from the lake (see p. 198), and returns with dry feet, for 
she has crossed on an invisible bridge; MacDougall, p. 94 :— A magic path leads 
across a lake. For a river made to flow over a dry plain, see Vulgate Merlin,

zig, 1895, vv. 554-561; cf. vv. 771-794. For a garden created by enchantment, 
see Gautier de Metz, Z’/mage du Monde, in Comparetti, Virgilio nel Medio Evo, 
Florence, 1896, II, 196:— Virgil creates a garden enclosed in air (cf. Alex.

note 1; also Partonopeus, vv. 4621 ff.

3 As Niniane sits beside Merlin in the garden, she induces him to lay his head 
in her lap, and then commit to her the coveted secret of an unending slumber 
(Vulgate Merlin, p. 299; cf. p. 484, where Merlin is said to lay his head in Niniane’s 
lap before she lulls him to sleep under the white-thorn). A parallel situation 
occurs in the ballad of Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight (Child, Ballads, 1, 55; 
cf. 48):—The Elf Knight stirs the love of the Lady Isabel and entices her to a 
wood, intending to kill her. She persuades him to lay his head in her lap as they

interest in a study of the relations of the versions, for it 
offers a direct parallel to the main part of Class B in order of 
events and in phraseology. It will therefore be treated below! 
in connection with Class B. 
The third section of the story belongs to the class dealing 
with a fay’s detention of a mortal in an air-bounded prison, 
of which we have already seen instances in the examination of 
the Val sanz Retor. An episode closely allied in type to this 
part of our theme is that of the Noir Chevalier contained 
in Gaucher de Dourdan’s continuation of the Perceval,? and in 
a slightly different form in the Didot-Perceval 
A young knight, the story runs, once upon a time set forth in quest of 
adventure. He chanced to enter the land of Avalon, and in the Forest del 
Blanc Perron he found sitting by a fountain the most beautiful maiden in 
the world. Quickly he won her love, and readily granted her demand that 
in return for her favor he should promise to do all her will. They wandered 
together through the forest until they came to a green meadow, where the 
maiden wished to remain, and by her assurances that she would always 
dwell with him, she overcame her lover’s objections to so remote an abiding 
place. Feeling an irresistible drowsiness stealing upon him, the over- 
persuaded knight threw himself on the grass to sleep. When he awoke, 
he was with his love in a splendid castle, which the maiden had built while 
sit beneath a tree, and thus gains the power to charm him to sleep; while he 
slumbers, she kills him. 
The enchanted pillow, of which Niniane makes use in Merlin’s third visit to 
her, is found also in many other sources. See Herbert, Do/opathos,ed. Brunet et 
Montaiglon, Paris, 1856, vv. 7167-7179, 7200-7208 : — A maiden skilled in necro- 
mancy places an enchanted feather beneath the pillow of her lover, which deprives 
him of the power to move and puts him to sleep as soon as his head touches the 
pillow; Doon, ed. Paris, Rom., VIII (1879), 61-64, vv. 51 ff.: — Every suitor of a 
certain lady when he comes to her castle is led to his chamber, where an inviting 
couch is prepared for him, on which before morning he dies; Perceval, vv. 9630 ff.: — 
When Gawain lies down in the famous /it de /a merveille in the magic palace of 
Ygerne, a maiden slips beneath his head a pillow which immediately lulls him to 
sleep; Paris, X. 7. &., III, 327: A fay who wishes to anoint Agravain with a 
baneful salve puts under his head, as he lies sleeping, an enchanted pillow, which 
will prevent his waking while he rests upon it. Cf. Cligés, vv. 3197 ff.: — A magic 
potion is prepared by a sorceress, which is employed by a wife to deceive her hus- 
band as Niniane’s pillow deceives Merlin, and which causes him to dream dreams 
in accordance with his desires. Cf. Zaz de l’Ombre, ed. Michel, Zais Jnédits, 
Paris, 1836, pp. 48, 49. For a simpler form of the enchantment, a spell cast by a 
maiden, which holds her lover immovable, see Campbell, I, 37; MacDougall,

he slept, and had made invisible to mortal eyes. At the entrance she had 
fashioned: a tomb that all men could see, on which she had placed an 
inscription stating that any passing knight, who cried out to the occupant 
of the tomb that he who put him there did a deed of folly, should be 
attacked forthwith by the knight of the tomb. The land is so wild that for 
ten years the knight has remained in his prison waiting for an opponent. 
His horse is his only solace, for an occasional visit is all that his love 
vouchsafes him. He is known as the Moir Chevalier de l’Arcel de la 
Sepouture en la lande. Perceval goes to the tomb, and utters the pre- 
scribed defiance. The knight comes forth, but upon receiving a wound-in 
the contest he waits for no further blows and flees at once back to the 
tomb. 
Of the Noir Chevalier Philipot says :!1— “Sa légende nous 
fournit tout au long le correspondant que nous cherchions a 
‘lentombement Merlin.’”” The parallel is in truth very close: — 
the hero finds the maiden by a clear fountain, he promises to do 
her will in return for her love, she leads him to a fertile spot in 
the forest, assures him that he shall pass a life of happiness there 
with her, casts him into a magic sleep, and while he slumbers 
rears about him an invisible house, where she keeps him in 
a melancholy confinement waiting for the adventure that tar- 
ries, and supported by visits from her at her own caprice. 
Although the knight is practically the defender of a “custom,” 
he passes years in a merely nominal championship of his abode, 
and is, like Merlin, kept in an inactive confinement. 
In the Didot-Perceval? there is told the story of another knight whose 
life resembled that of the Noir Chevalier. Urbain, son of the queen of 
Naire Espine, met one day in the forest a beautiful maiden who led him to 
a fair castle, and promised to love him if he would agree to abide with her 
in the place where she chose to take him. Ever since that time he has 
dwelt with her in a castle invisible to all eyes except his and _hers, situated 
beside a ford of which he is the defender. Perceval comes to the ford and 
defeats Urbain. Forthwith a mighty noise heralds the destruction of the 
magic castle. Urbain’s love, when she sees that he is being defeated, 
transforms herself and her maidens into birds, who swoop down and attack 
Perceval. 
The story of Urbain contains distinct resemblances to the 
episode of La Jote de la Cour in Erec.? Like Urbain, the knight 
Mabonagrain has defeated many an opponent in the defence 
of his lady’s mist-enclosed garden; he, too, dwells ever with

his amze, and is not the recipient of only her occasional favor. 
The sound of a horn terminates the adventure of La Jote de la 
Cour; a mysterious noise indicates that the fay’s castle by the 
ford is destroyed.‘ When the “custom” of the garden is 
abolished, according to the Welsh version in Geraint, the mist 
disappears; when Urbain is overcome, the castle vanishes. 
The fay in Zrec laments bitterly the defeat of Mabonagrain ; in 
Perceval the fays transformed into birds take vengeance upon 
the victor. In Mabonagrain, moreover, there appear united 
two names which frequently are found side by side,?— Madson, 
Eurain in Bel Inconnu,; Mabon, Trayn in Libeaus Desconus ; 
Mabonagrain, Evrain in Erec ; Mabounain, Urain in Perceval. 
In the Didot-Perceval substantially the same story as that of 
Mabon is told again of a hero whose name closely resembles 
Eurain (Irayn, Evrain, Urain), and therefore the couple Mabon- 
agrain, Urbain deserves to be added to the above list, which 
Philipot has brought together.® 
That it is a true fairyland in which Merlin, the Noir Chevalier, 
and Urbain are imprisoned is evident when we recall the char- 
acteristics of the Val sanz Retor and kindred scenes. The 
beauty of the castle and, in the story of the Noir Chevalier, the 
unfailing supplies of food promised by the fay, are details that 
belong to the dwellings of the other world. In the white-thorn 
bush in full blossom in Broceliande, beneath which Merlin is 
lulled to sleep by Niniane, there may perhaps be a reminis- 
cence of the white musical boughs that bring drowsiness, which 
in Celtic tales are borne to mortals by messengers from the 
other world. When Bran awoke from the slumber to which he

IV, 125, 126. 
3 Rom., XXV (1896), 275-277. Another type of Celtic fairy story bears 
resemblance to the theme discussed here. In the folk-tale, 7he Daughter of King 
Underwaves (Campbell, ITI, 421), Diarmaid releases a maiden from spells, and is 
rewarded with her love. One night while he sleeps she builds'on a spot selected by 
him the fairest castle that he has ever seen, and consents to dwell there with him, 
provided he does not say to-her thrice how he found her. He fails to observe 
her injunction, and at his third mention of the plight in which she had come to 
him, the castle disappears. Cf. MacInnes and Nutt, pp. 210 ff.; Maynadier, Zhe 
Wife of Bath’s Tale, London, 1901, pp. 21-24, 33, 34-

had been lulled by wonderfully sweet mysterious music, he saw 
close by him a branch of silver with white blossoms. A strange 
woman appeared to him: “ And she said: — 
A branch from the apple-tree from Emain 
I bring like those one knows ; 
Twigs of white silver are on it, 
Crystal boughs with blossoms.” ! 
In the Echtra Cormaic,? we read that Cormac’s guide to the 
Land of Promise is an aged knight, who visits him bearing a 
musical silver branch with golden apples; “very sweet music 
did that branch make, wounded men and folk enfeebled by 
sickness would be lulled to sleep by it.” In pursuit of the 
aged knight Cormac goes to the Land of Promise. Niniane’s 
complete annihilation of Merlin’s power may perhaps be par- 
alleled by the trance, such as Cuchulinn’s, that leaves the mor- 
tal weak and helpless in the hands of a fay.4 
At the beginning of our study of fairy mythology, we saw 
that i in the early Celtic type of fairy story, in that of Bran and 
Connla, for example, the fay loves the hero for his renown or 
beauty, and lures him to her abode by magic means, a musical 
bough, it may be, perhaps an enchanted apple. There in com- 
plete oblivion, forgetful of time, he stays a willing prisoner,® 
asked to do no deed of valor and enjoying the continual pres- 
ence of his mistress. In the stories that we have just been 
considering the inherent situation is that the fay loves the

hardy knight, who in return for her love promises to do her 
will; he goes with her to an other-world dwelling that she 
builds, and then as a result of his promise he is obliged to 
defend the abode, or in other words to maintain the fay’s 
“custom.” An important difference exists between all of 
these episodes and Class A. In the latter the enchanter loves 
the fay and seeks her love; she promises to grant it to him on 
condition that he teach her his magic art. When she has built 
for him the other-world dwelling, the narrative is ended, and 
Merlin in his remaining history is represented as a melancholy 
victim of imprisonment, whose confinement is utterly devoid 
of activity. These differences in the story are undoubtedly 
due to the character of the hero, whose power lies in his magic 
art ; complete submission to the will of his mistress involves 
for him no knightly deed, such as the defence of her domain 
against an armed opponent, but simply the surrender of his 
skill to her control. If the fay’s beloved is a knight, it is his 
strength, if a magician, his necromantic art, that must be at 
her disposal. Hence Merlin’s sojourn in the other world is 
necessarily inactive. In the same way the fay’s vé/e is modi- 
fied by the situation. She cannot demand a deed of arms, for 
the hero is no knight ; but he is the prince of enchanters, and 
she therefore insists that he yield up his magic skill to her. 
Accordingly, she must appear in the story as not thoroughly 
versed in all enchantment, as a true other-world fay should be, 
but as gradually making the magician’s power her own, and 
thus sapping his force. As the early fairy story was modified 
in Arthur’s case by his character, so here we have doubtless 
another instance of a variation on an original theme occasioned 
by the established nature of the hero. 
Clearly, in Class A we are dealing with composite material. 
Its main part tells the common story of a mortal kept in durance 
in an other-world dwelling by a supernatural mistress to whom 
he has promised complete submission ; the introduction — the 
tale of an enchanter who woos by magic means — and the minor 
episodes contain material which is recognizably popular and 
wide-spread, and hence readily attached to so important a magi- 
cian as Merlin was by the time that the prose romances were 
compiled, and to a fay who used her wiles upon him.

16 
The second class (Class B) comprises the Lawce/ot versions.1 
On the borders of Brittany there lives a beautiful maiden, named Niniane, 
of whom Merlin becomes enamoured. When she learns who her lover is, she 
promises to grant all his wishes provided he will first impart to her some of 
his skill in magic. She induces him to teach her how by the power of words 
to enclose a spot from which none may pass out, and how to keep a man 
asleep at her pleasure. These secrets she wishes to use against her father, 
whose anger she fears if he discovers Merlin’s visits. According to one 
version (Lancelot) she inscribes on her flesh two magic words that protect 
her virtue ; according to the other (2. 7. #.) she casts Merlin into a deep 
sleep with the same purpose. At last she has learned so many arts from 
him that she is able to seal him asleep? in a cave in the perilous forest of 
Darnantes. Since that time he has never been seen, nor does any man 
know the way to the place of his confinement. 
In the account of Merlin’s meeting with Niniane and his 
instruction of her, Class B comes into contact with Class A, 
but diverges from it in the story of Merlin’s disappearance 
from the eyes of men. The Lawce/ot is an earlier composition 
than those versions comprised in Class A and Class C,? and 
internal evidence shows that its rendering of the story is not 
based upon the material most prominent in them. In the con- 
cise treatment of the beginning and the end of the account 
it looks like a condensation of some more complete narrative. 
But between the more elaborated part of B and one scene in 
A there is, as I have said above,a marked similarity. This 
scene in A appears with an introduction in which Niniane 
meets her lover by a fountain on the feast of St. John, and 
leads him to her chamber ; later she cajoles him into revealing 
the fatal secret —a story which in its complete form we do not 
find elsewhere. In both classes the events in the narrative 
follow the same general order,‘ and striking verbal similarities

Niniane and Merlin 215 
enclose a place by magic forms the nucleus of the last scene. 
Each of these details occupies in the Lancelot one sentence ; 
in the Merlin each forms almost a complete narrative by itself. 
The authors are quite transparent in their methods. The com- 
mon source is elaborated in Class A by the introduction, as we 
have seen, of material current in tales of enchanters and of 
maidens seeking to thwart the desires of unwelcome suitors ; 
in Class B it is evidently condensed, although its outlines are 
preserved. 
The characteristic feature of Class B lies in the conclusion : — 
Niniane seals Merlin asleep in a cave of the forest. In the 
Ossianic saga there are traces of a twofold tradition concerning 
Oisin’s experiences with a fairy mistress. One embodied in a 
literary form tells of his life with the golden-haired Niamh in 
the Land of Youth;! the other is current to-day among the 
peasants of Cork, and makes the scene of his sojourn with a 
fay the so-called cavern of the Grey Sheep near Mitchelstown 
in Cork: Oisin chanced to go into the cave, and on the other 
side of the stream that flows through it he met a beautiful 
damsel with whom he lived, as he fancied, a few days. When 
he asked her consent to revisit the Fenians, she told him that 
he had been with her for more than three hundred years, and 
that he might return to his countrymen provided he did not 
alight froma horse that she gavehim. He disobeyed her, how- 
ever, and the steed fled away from him, leaving him a decrepit 
old man. There is no means of telling the age of the tradition ; 
a different and unmistakably late story is told of the Cavern 
of the Grey Sheep, accounting for its name, and the tale of 
Oisin may be an old tradition connected with the cave by the 
peasants of the district, who wished to localize in their own 
region the experience of a famous hero.” 
As with Oisin and Merlin, so with Arthur and with Ogier, 
the story of the hero’s disappearance from earth has assumed 
more than one form. Though Arthur dwells with Morgain’ in 
Avalon, he also sleeps bespelled in an enchanted castle or cave, 
awaiting with his knights a bugle call or the sound of a bell

that shall awake them from a magic slumber.! Ogier not only 
is honored by a sojourn in Avalon with Morgain, but in a 
vaulted chamber near the castle of Kronberg in Denmark he 
and his men sit fast asleep around a table, and there he has 
said that he and his warriors will remain, until there are no 
more men in Denmark than can stand on a wine-butt. Ogier, 
too, haunts the forest of Ardennes, but some day he will return 
to the abodes of men2 Merlin, like Arthur, rests in oblivion in 
a cave, and waits to be roused only by a destined signal; but 
in his case the bespelling hand is that of the maiden who has 
enticed him, and she alone can break the enchantment. 
In Class B there is never an indication that Niniane loves 
Merlin, although in A she listens to him at first willingly and 
with sincere eagerness. Throughout B a strain of duplicity is 
perceptible in her character, as in the nature of a sorceress 
who entices heroes to their own undoing. Again and again in 
Celtic material we read of the malicious inmate of a cave who 
from sinister motives attracts a hero to her home. 
In the story of the Exchanted Cave of Keshcorran® three sorceresses of 
the Tuatha dé Danann, to entrap the Fianna, hang hasps of yarn in front 
of the cave of Keshcorran. The Fianna pass through the hasps, “ where- 
upon a deathly tremor occupied them and presently they lost their strength, 
so that by those valiant hags they were fast bound indissolubly ... Their 
pith and valour likewise was abolished .. . As helplessly pinioned and tightly 
tethered culprit prisoners the hags transported them into black mysterious 
holes, into dark perplexing labyrinths.” A comrade rescues them. 
Tain, the hero of a West Highland tale,* goes with three companions to 
acave. One of the companions enters, and is at once struck by a hag with a 
magic club which makes him a bare crag of stone. Iain’s other companions 
meet the same fate, and all are freed from the spell only when Iain himself 
sprinkles upon them certain magic drops of water which restore them to life. 
Another Celtic story of the same type is the Zale of Young Manus.’ A 
beautiful woman stands at the bedside of Young Manus and easily induces 
him to follow her to a cave ; here she strikes him with a magic rod which 
turns him into a pillar of stone. He is restored to life by the touch from a 
rod dipped in a certain reviving cordial.°

Niniane and Merlin 217 
There is in the romances an evident association between 
Niniane and the goddess Diana! In the cave versions of 
Niniane’s retention of Merlin, it is possible for us to see one 
important effect upon the legend that this connection may have 
had. The fate of Endymion had left an impression upon the 
- literature of mediaeval Europe. Ausonius? speaks of his slum- 
bers as of a familiar theme, and in writing the Ephemeris 
considered it unnecessary to mention his name in order to 
recall him to the minds of his readers. 
Errat et ipsa, olim qualis per Latmia saxa 
Endymioneos solita adfectare sopores, 
Cum face et astrigero diademate Luna bicornis.* 
Annuam quondam iuveni quietem 
Noctis et lucis vicibus manentem 
Fabulae fingunt cui Luna somnos 
Continuarit.* 
Nor is it a trifling indication of the diffusion of the myth 
to find it referred to by Martianus Capella,> whose work had 
a highly important educational value in the middle ages.®

In the versions of Niniane’s imprisonment of Merlin, one 
class is composed of pure Celtic material, and leaves Merlin 
confined by Niniane in a castle with walls of mist ; in this class 
Niniane’s connection with Diana is more remote than in the 
others, and Diana is said to be merely her father’s godmother, 
or a kindly goddess who gives her a “destiny” before birth. 
In the other classes, Niniane’s connection with the goddess is 
more personal; she dwells at the Lac de Dyane, or she is

herself endowed with the attributes of Diana; in these versions 
she seals her lover asleep ina cave. If Niniane were already 
associated with Diana whose beloved slept forever in a cave, 
what more natural change than the transformation of the fay’s 
air-bounded prison where the Celtic enchanter dwelt in oblivion 
into the same hiding-place as that of Endymion? 
The just prerogative of heroic deed is the power to draw 
to itself legends of different variety but similar type, and the 
hero’s disappearance from earth is a magnet for story. We 
cannot assert positively which type of tradition first belonged 
to the Merlin saga. The enchanted sleeper in a cave has been 
known since the days of Endymion, and as long ago as the 
time of Odysseus, Circe employed her power as a sorceress to 
detain with her the hero whom she loved. But since the castle 
of mist belongs unmistakably to Celtic fairydom, and since 
Merlin is a Celtic enchanter and Niniane a Celtic fay, there is 
a strong probability that the earlier theme to become attached 
to Merlin’s name is the story that we know through Class A. 
Exactly the opposite is true, of Merlin to that which is true 
of Arthur. In the Arthur tradition as we know it, after his 
disappearance from this world a love-motive may be said almost 
never to be present ; in Merlin’s story this is the prominent 
feature, and the promise of the hero to do the fay’s will in 
return for her love is a fundamental part of every version. 
The magic oblivion of a hero in a cave is not necessarily influ- 
enced by this motive ; but by presupposing that such existing 
material as is represented in A was already attached to Merlin, 
and by recognizing the connection between Niniane and Diana, 
we may more readily explain the cave version as the outcome of 
the former under the influence of the latter than we may the 
reverse situation.

Class B; the induction to their story shows us Niniane as a 
damoisele cacheresse and will be examined in the next chapter. 
1. Huth Merlin. 
Niniane is dwelling at Arthur’s court as a guest, and since she is 
remarkably beautiful Merlin begins to love her. She refuses to heed his 
wooing unless he will teach her as much of his magic art as she wishes to 
know. When she leaves the court to return to her home in Northumber- 
land Merlin acts as her voluntary escort. She hates him more than she 
hates any living being, but feigns pleasure in his society. On their way 
they come to the beautiful Lac de Dyane, where Merlin builds for her 
a princely dwelling, which by enchantment he makes invisible to mortal 
eyes. Here he abides with the maiden, and through his instruction she 
learns more about necromancy than any one in the world except Merlin 
himself. Nor is there anybody on earth whom she hates with so deadly a 
hatred, and knowing that he desires to wrong her she constantly plans to 
destroy him. One day Merlin tells the maiden of a plot of Morgain to 
kill Arthur.1 At once she is eager to go to Great Britain to save the king, 
and as Merlin, knowing that death awaits him there, fears to go, she prom- 
ises with protestations of affection to protect him from all danger, if he will 
attend her. All the way his love for her and her hatred of him increase, 
and Niniane resolves upon his death. 
In the forest perilleuse Merlin takes the maiden to a fair chamber fash- 
ioned among the rocks, which had been the refuge of a certain unhappy 
Anasteu and his love, and where they had been buried in a marble tomb 
with a marble cover of such weight that only Merlin can raise it. The 
maiden insists that she wishes to look upon the bodies of the lovers lying 
within the tomb, and Merlin lifts the cover and lays it on the ground. The 
maiden next professes to be so charmed with the story of the lovers that 
she wishes to pass the night beside their tomb. As soon as Merlin lies 
down upon his couch she casts a magic sleep upon him, in which he loses 
his memory and all his power. Then she summons her servants and 
shows them that Merlin is like one dead and that the great enchanter is 
himself enchanted, bespelled by her because he has followed her for her 
dishonor. She bids her attendants lift him and fling him into the tomb 
where the lovers rest, and upon it she lays the cover, and seals it with her 
magic arts so that none can move it. No eye could see Merlin thereafter 
until she herself came to the tomb by Tristan’s request. Nor did any man 
hear Merlin’s voice except Baudemagus, who came to the tomb four days 
after Merlin’s enchantment, while he was still alive and able to tell Baude- 
magus that only she who had confined him there could open the tomb. 
This was the last cry that Merlin uttered in lamentation that he had been 
given over to death by the craft of a woman, and that a woman’s wit had 
overcome his own.?. The maiden departs from the tomb on the day after 
she has imprisoned Merlin.

3. Prophecies. 
The Dame du Lac summons Merlin to ask him not to reveal that one of 
Morgain’s knights has been captured by one of her knights. He remains 
with her, and in order to protect herself against him, she casts him into a 
deep sleep at night. She hates him with a deadly hatred and longs to con- 
fine him in a place whence he can never escape. He teaches her all that he 
knows of necromancy, and vows fidelity to her, but she becomes convinced 
of his faithlessness, and plans how she may deceive him. In a cave in the 
forest of Darnantes there is a certain tomb to which Merlin leads her one 
day, telling her that none but she may find the way thither. Here they 
dwell together for fifteen months and would have remained longer but for 
Morgain, who comes to the forest in search of Merlin. The Dame du Lac 
hears the sound of her hunters’ horns and fears her, for she knows that if 
Merlin is on friendly terms with Morgain and her ally, Claudas de la Deserte, 
Lancelot and his two cousins, her fosterlings, will surely be put to death. 
Merlin assures the Dame du Lac that he expects never to leave the cave, 
and she begs him to allow her to remain with him. He tells her that he 
shall die before her death and entreats her to be buried in the tomb with 
him ; whereupon she prevails upon him to lie down in it that she may see 
if there will be room for her also. Instantly she closes the lid upon him, 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
| Niniane and Merlin 221 
and fastens it in the fashion that he has himself taught her, so that none 
may open it. Morgain, she tells him, has reproached her with a boast of 
his that she has lost her virtue by him; hence the vengeance that she is 
taking upon him. He has taught her how to cast a man into a deep sleep, 
and how to fasten a place so that it can never be opened; by these arts 
she has secured him now. Merlin bids her go to Maistre Antoine, the 
bishop of Gales, and tell him what she has done, and that her maidenhood 
isunharmed. In two months his flesh will moulder away, but his spirit will 
remain for all who come to the tomb. The Dame du Lac stays by the tomb 
until the two months are ended, then wends her way to Maistre Antoine. 
She laments her deed and would do all in her power to set Merlin free, but 
she has so confined him that none but Christ can release him. Merlin in 
revenge teaches all women how to deceive men. 
The versions of the Huth Merlin and Malory belong together, 
that of the Prophecies forms a class by itself. Malory’s account 
is clearly based on one that was kindred to the Huth Merlin; + 
but his description of the confinement of Merlin is so vague 
and incomprehensible that it looks as if here he or his source 
were making an attempt at abridgment, in which the influence 
of some such story as that of the Prophecies may be at work. 
The date of the Prophecies is placed at 1272,? that of the Huth 
Merlin, by Gaston Paris, at about 1225 or 1230.9 The former 
contains an obviously later account than that of the Huth Mer- 
Zin, and is more remote from the fairy theme that we have seen 
in Class A; but it is evidently influenced by the same material 
that we find in the Huth Merlin. The stay by the Lac de 
Dyane and the scene by the lovers’ tomb in the forest peril- 
leuse are represented here by the stay in the cave in Darnantes. 
Just as Merlin takes /a damoisele cacheresse to the Lac de Dyane 
and builds her an invisible house there, so the Dame du Lac, 
who in the Prophecies is completely identified with Niniane,* 
has a presumably invisible house by the Lac de Dyane, to 
which she has a mysterious habit of opening the path, so that 
others beside Merlin may find it.6 In the Huth Merlin, Mor- 
gain indirectly causes the departure of Niniane and Merlin 
from the Lac de Dyane. In the Prophecies Morgain is again 
the interfering cause that interrupts the sojourn of Merlin with

-P-A-G-E-234
222 Niniane and Merlin 
the Dame du Lac; but here her slanders are a direct influence 
in actuating the Dame du Lac to Merlin’s imprisonment. This 
is a new feature in the saga, throughout which fear and hatred 
of Merlin are Niniane’s impelling motives. The tradition 
which makes the Dame du Lac in the Huth Merlin and else- 
where the opposing principle to Morgain’s schemes against 
Arthur is here carried further, and is probably responsible for 
this emphasizing of the hostility of Morgain to Niniane. Mor- 
gain is a friend to Claudas and to Merlin; if among them a triple 
alliance is formed, Lancelot and his cousins will be injured. 
This shows the influence of those episodes in which Morgain 
and the Dame du Lac are at odds for Lancelot’s sake ;? and the 
Dame du Lac’s dread here is connected with her true 7é/e as 
Lancelot’s guardian. All of these characteristics that I have 
mentioned are indicative of a later stage of tradition than is 
seen in the Auth Merlin. Furthermore, two other features 
point in the same direction; in the Prophecies, it is by sheer 
craft and not by magic wiles that Niniane inveigles Merlin into 
the place of his imprisonment, where she confines him by his 
own art; neither is it by her power that he can be set free, 
but by Christ’s. 
It will be noticed that Class C and Class A have few points 
of contact ; both come into contact with Class B, the former 
group in the beginning, the latter in the end. But the simple 
story of the magic sleep in a cave in B is elaborated in C into 
a long account of the confinement in a tomb in the cave. When 
Merlin was once represented as lying wrapped in oblivion in 
a cave, the feature of the tomb is almost a necessary addition 
of the rationalizing tendency which so frequently influences 
the material of the prose romances. The enchanted sleeper is 
dead to the world. Whether or not this conception affected the 
strange story of the place where the Noir Chevalier maintained 
his “ custom” we have no means of determining. 
In the story of Helimas, father of the fay Melusine, there is a resem- 
blance to the variety of the Merlin story contained in Class C, especially 
1 Cf. p. xliv:—The Dame du Lac has confined Merlin in the tomb Jour le 
despit de Morgain; p. xlv:—The Dame du Lac put Merlin in a place where 
Morgain could not find him, since he could teach Morgain how to kill Boors and 
to deceive her. 2 See pp. 195 ff.

in the Huth Merlin. Helimas, king of Albania, the husband of the fay, 
Pressine, loses her by his disobedience to an injunction that she has laid upon 
him. Her three daughters resolve to punish their father. They take him 
to a cave in a mountain ¢vestout plain de faerie, and there imprison him. 
En ce haut mont l’enfermerent. 
On ne scet quel part qu’ilz alerent 
Mais Helimas depuis n’issy,

In a beautiful chamber in; this cave his wife has a tomb made for him at 
his death, and also places there an alabaster statue of herself. Then, as 
par lordre de fairie, she decrees that none shall enter there who does not 
derive descent from Avalon. 
There are indications that the story of a man who was enticed 
into a tomb or hiding place and there entrapped or assailed 
was a favorite subject with narrators, and might readily have 
become attached to Merlin, when the episode was once in vogue 
that depicted him as enticed by magic into a tomb where he 
was confined? One illustration of such stories is contained in 
the Perceval: —* 
Perceval comes upon a cross and a tree and a marble tomb. In the 
tomb a knight is crying loudly for release, and in response to Perceval’s 
eready proffers of help he directs him how to lift the lid from the tomb. As 
soon as he emerges, but while Perceval is still. holding up the lid, with all 
his might he pushes his rescuer into the tomb. The lid falls, and the 
knight springs on Perceval’s mule, only to find, however, that having been 
enchanted it refuses to stir for any rider except Perceval. Angry and 
devoid of ingenuity, the unfortunate knight lifts the lid of the tomb, sum- 
mons Perceval forth, and settles down in his old quarters again without 
another word.>

IV 
The study of these numerous sources shows us that there 
are two distinct accounts of Merlin’s meeting with Niniane : — 
one the story of the maiden of the fountain in the forest of 
Brittany, the other that of /a damoisele cacheresse. There are 
also two accounts of Merlin’s confinement by the maiden : — 
one the story of the air-bounded castle, the other that of the 
cave or the tomb in the cave. The story of the meeting with 
the maiden of the fountain is concluded by that of the castle of 
mist ; that of la damoisele cacheresse by the version of the tomb 
in the cave. One set of versions (Class B) contains features 
common to both accounts, and adds the imprisonment in the 
cave to a story resembling that to which the castle of mist 
forms the conclusion, but not resembling that of /a damoisele 
cacheresse. In spite of their apparent dissimilarities, a brief 
comparison of the essential features of the versions shows that 
they have numerous resemblances, and that certain elements 
persist throughout. In all the classes Merlin’s love is a forest 
maiden of Brittany; in all they meet secretly; in all, by the 
power that Niniane has derived from Merlin, she protects her- 
self against him; in all he shows her how to produce a magic 
sleep that shall endure at her pleasure, and how to fashion a 
magic prison; in all she lures him to the spot where she 
casts him into a magic sleep and imprisons him by the arts 
that he has taught her. With these persistent elements of the 
story there is mingled in Class A extraneous material, the 
employment of which is accounted for by the fact that the hero 
is an enchanter and not a knight, and by the elaboration of 
detail incumbent upon the worthy writer of a long romance. 
In Class C the extraneous material is largely due to the more 
pronounced influence of a different conception of Niniane’s 
character,! which suggests a series of incidents remote from A. 
Essentially the story places Merlin among the many heroes 
of old who fell victims to fairy blandishments, and were 
closet, tomb, or pit from which a serpent unexpectedly darts forth and attacks the 
hero. See Perceval, vv. 15,191 ff.; Malory, Bk. XI, ch. 1; Child, Ballads, V, 
126; cf. Carrie A. Harper, Modern Language Notes, Nov., 1898; Paris, Rom.,

transported by other-world agencies to a land without return. 
Merlin’s experiences when once he is in Niniane’s power are 
just as truly other-world experiences as are those of Bran, 
Maelduin, and Connla. The story of his disappearance from 
the world was popular in the highest degree. Its repeated use 
in the prose romances and the variety in the forms that it 
assumes are sufficient indication that it was told and retold? 
1 See the summary of the unpublished romance Ysaye le Triste, Zs. f. rom. Phil. 
XXV (1901), 181, § 11: — The spirit of Merlin is confined beneath a beautiful tree 
by the command of the Dame du Lac. See also a Breton tale cited by Southey, 
King Arthur, London, 1817, I, xlviii, and in Hibbert Lectures, p. 159, note 1:— 
Merlin was enclosed in a tree by the power of an enchanter greater than himself. 
De la Rue (Zssais Historiques, Caen, 1834, I, 71) cites a tradition from Gautier 
de Metz, L’Image du Monde: —“ C'est dans cette forét [Bréchéliant] que périt 
Venchanteur Merlin, victime d’un charme que les Fées bretonnes lui avaient appris, 
et qu’il ne croyait pas possible.” See also Bellamy, Za Forét de Bréchéliant, 
Rennes, 1896, I, 196 ff. 
For an account of Merlin’s retirement at /’Esplumeor Mellin, with which 
Niniane is not connected, see the Didot-Perceval, 1, 505; cf. Raoul de Houdenc, 
Meraugis von Portlesguez, ed. Friedwagner, Halle, 1897, vv. 1333, 2052, 2634, 
2700, 2703, 2713; Sébillot, Gargantua, Paris, 1883, p.114. See further, Loth, Zes 
Mabinogion, Paris, 1889, 11, 277, 278 (cf. Mead, English Merlin, p. xcviii, note 3) ; 
Skene, Four Anc. Books, 1, 478; 11, 234 (cf. Lot, Ann. de Bretagne, XV, 1899- 
1900, 509 ff.) ; Sanesi, Za Storia di Merlino, Bergamo, 1898, p. xxxvii. 
An evidence of the popularity of the Merlin and Niniane story is found in 
the echoes of its characteristic elements that we catch here and there through 
the romances. In the continuation of the Perceval by Gaucher de Dourdan 
(vv. 34,205 ff.) we read that Merlin by necromancy fashioned in a certain place 
across and a magic pillar. A maiden chanced to come to the spot and thus did 
foolishly, for when she thought to go away she could not leave Merlin, but had 
to abide with him as his love. He built for her a fair house, and there he dwelt 
with her. The story also appears in the Zavola Ritonda (I, 223) : — Escorducarla, 
Dama dell’ Isola di Vallone (doubtless Avalon; see p. 230, note 3, citations from 
Gottfried von Strassburg and the Zavola Ritonda; Couronnement de Louis, ed. 
Langlois, Paris, 1888, cf.v. 1827 and MS. C., v. 1598), built a marvellous palace, 
intending to imprison Merlin there, for she loved him. He had no idea of 
submitting to such treatment, and himself took the lady away to the Isola di 
Vallone, where he keeps her a prisoner. See also Parlement of the Thre Ages, 
vv. 608-611. This tradition is directly the obverse of that which we have been 
examining. A parallel situation is found in the case of the enchanter Mabon, the 
pupil of Merlin, who, in a story distinctly reflecting that of Merlin and Niniane, is 
said to have been imprisoned by a fair lady in her castle by means of the art that 
he had himself taught her (Léseth, § 334); and who, according to another source 
(Bel Inconnu, vv. 314 ff.), himself imprisons a mortal maid and keeps her in the 
form of a serpent in his castle until she shall marry him or be rescued by a hero. 
There is nothing contrary to the course of tradition, therefore, in the situation by 
which two types of story are attached to Merlin’s name, according to one of which 
an other-world love exercises supreme power over him, while according to the
-P-A-G-E-238
226 Niniane and Merlin 
Lays and independent narratives existed dealing with Merlin,! 
and inasmuch as his legend was peculiarly fitted to absorb 
other he gains control over a damsel and imprisons her. The magic house built by 
Merlin for the lady, however, looks like a reflection of the more widely diffused 
story of Niniane. Cf. also the invisible house built by Merlin for Niniane, and, 
in the Prophecies, his magic decorations of the cave whither he assures Niniane 
that none but she may find the way. 
In several minor episodes, besides that of Mabon, the story of Merlin’s instruc- 
tion of Niniane is echoed. The Dame d’Avalon in a trial of magic skill at Avalon 
with the Queen of Norgalles, Sebile l’enchanteresse, and Morgain carries off the 
palm from the rest :—‘“ Ouy certes font les aultres. cest art vos apprint Merlin | 
car il me iura une nuyt quat il emporta mon pucelage | mais iey feuz deceue | car 
il me dist il maprédroit ce qul scauoit ” (Prophecies, p. xcvii). A certain damsel 
of Leonnois is wronged by Merlin, who teaches her his arts and enchantments 
(Prophecies, p. 1xv). See also Léseth, p. 466. 
The most important reflection of the story is to be seen in the accounts of 
Merlin’s love for Morgain and his instruction of her in the magic art. This 
cannot properly be regarded as an independent tradition, but is doubtless the result 
of rationalization, which, as we have seen, frequently explains a fay’s power as due 
to a magician’s instruction, and which, when Morgain’s supernatural gifts had to 
be accounted for, would naturally place her under the tutelage of the greatest of 
enchanters, Merlin. The passages in which Morgain is represented as deriving 
her art from Merlin fall into two divisions, — those in which she is merely said to 
win her skill from Merlin who loves her (Zamcelot, I, xxi; Paris, R. 7. X., II, 
205; Léseth, §190; Renart le Nouvel, vv. 4807 ff.; Tavola Ritonda, I, 296; 
above, pp. 61, 62, 102), and those in which reminiscences of the Niniane story 
are more clearly defined. To this latter class belongs the account in the Livre 
@ Artus, P. (§§ 100-102), according to which Morgain proves herself quite as apt 
a pupil of Merlin as Niniane is, and in fact temporarily rather more engrossing 
(cf., however, §§130, 135, 136). The special magic power taught Morgain by 
Merlin, according to this source, is a reminder of the arts that he is said in 
Class A to have imparted to Niniane : — Et auint lonc tens apres ce que Merlins 
fu perduz. que ele fist faire sales por ester les plus beles du monde en maint leus. 
et quant eles estoient assouies. et li ourier sen estoient ale. si gitoit son enchante- 
ment (p. 14). Still greater is the resemblance to the Merlin and Niniane story in 
the account in the Huth Merlin (1, 263-266) of Morgain’s acquisition of necro- 
mancy : — Arthur has had erected on the top of a fortress gold and silver images 
of twelve vanquished kings, in whose hands he has had lighted torches placed, 
which Merlin announces shall burn till the day of his own death (cf. Gautier de 
Metz, Z’Jmage du Monde, cited by Comparetti, Virgilio nel Medio Evo, Florence, 
1896, II, 196, for a somewhat similar device of Virgil’s. Cf. also the firebrand 
that shall burn as long as Ogier’s life lasts, given him by Morgain in Avalon; 
see above, pp. 77, 79). Morgain, on learning that this marvel is due to Merlin’s 
art, decides that his acquaintance is worth cultivating, and since she wins his love 
by her beauty, she easily persuades him, in return for her promise to do whatever 
he asks, to teach her so much necromancy that no woman on earth shall know

CHAPTER XIV 
LA DAMOISELE CACHERESSE! 
One day while Arthur is sitting at meat a white stag comes dashing 
through the hall pressed hard by a brachet. After it in hot pursuit there 
rides a beautiful maiden who has just unleashed thirty couples of hounds. 
She is clad as a huntress in a short green robe, round her neck hangs an 
ivory horn, in her hand are bow and arrows. She is riding at full speed, 
and is making an obnoxious amount of noise. A knight who is present 
seizes the brachet and rides off with it; the stag and hounds escape. The 
maiden flings down her bow and arrows, and clamors for immediate repara- 
tion from the king for the loss of her little dog and the interruption of her 
hunt. Merlin, in spite of reminders that the adventure will lead to death, 
appoints Gawain to bring back to court the stag’s head and the hounds 
unharmed, and Tor to go forth in quest of the brachet. At this moment an 
armed knight rides up, swings the maiden to his saddle, and spurs off with 
her. She cries loudly for help, and Merlin deputes Pellinor to go to her 
rescue. 
Gawain’s pursuit leads him to a ford defended by a knight [in Jalory, 
Allardin of the Isles], whom he overcomes. He follows the stag across 
the stream through a forest and into a beautiful castle. The dogs rush 
after it and kill it in the hall. An armed knight makes his appearance 
forthwith, and indulges in loud lamentation because he has guarded ill his 
favorite stag that his lady gave into his keeping. Gawain and he engage 
in combat, and Gawain is about to kill him when the knight’s ame throws 
herself between them, and Gawain by accident cuts off her head instead of 
her lover’s. The knight, however, is vanquished and Gawain sends him as 
a prisoner to the queen. Left alone, he notices that the castle is apparently 
uninhabited. Presently a thundering blast from a horn breaks the stillness. 
Four armed champions enter the hall, attack Gawain, wound him, and 
take him off to a dungeon. When the lady of the castle learns who he is, 
she releases him provided he will promise to do her bidding, and return to 
court with the maiden’s body bound to his saddle and her head hanging 
from his neck. She gives him the stag’s head to take back to the king as" 
evidence that he has accomplished the adventure. When he arrives at 
court Merlin in commending him says :— Et saichiés gue ceste aventure 
poés vous bien tenir a une des aventures de{l] saint graal*

Tor, meanwhile, pursues the brachet. Guided by a dwarf he comes to 
a meadow where beautiful pavilions are spread. In one of these he discov- 
ers a maiden sleeping, with the brachet in her arms. Despite her entreaties 
and threats, Tor takes the little dog from her and rides on his way. The 
next day the maiden’s lover, the knight who had stolen the brachet, over- 
takes him and demands the dog. The result isa contest in which Tor 
is victor. 
Pellinor, after some unimportant experiences, finds the maiden and her 
captor, with whom a cousin of hers is fighting in her defence. When the 
contestants hear Pellinor’s declaration that he intends to lead the maiden 
back to the king, they make their peace and attack their new opponent, only 
to be defeated by him. The maiden’s cousin begs Pellinor to treat her with 
consideration : — Car bien sachiés que ele [est] fille de roi et de roine et 
estraite de moult haut lignage. Mais tant li plaist la cacherie des fores 
et tant si delite que elle ne vaut ongues avoir ne ami ne baron, ains s’en 
gabe quant on en parole a li.1 On their way back to court the maiden’s 
horse stumbles, and she falls, hurting her arm. They stop to rest, and 
overhear a plot of two passing knights to poison Arthur, at which the 
maiden expresses her confidence in the king’s safety since Merlin is at 
court. They pursue their way to Camelot where /a damoisele cacheresse 
receives at Arthur’s hands her brachet, hounds, and stag’s head. She tells 
the king and queen that her name is Niniane ; and that she is the daughter 
of a man of high rank in Little Brittany, but she does not say that she is 
the daughter of a king. Everybody who has heard the story of Robert de 
Boron knows that this maiden is she who was called /a damoisele du lac, 
who brought up Lancelot du lac. 
Gaston Paris says of this episode :2—“On a vu que notre 
romancier a fait de la ‘demoiselle chasseresse’ de cette aven- 
ture la méme que Ninienne. Cela n’éclaircit pas l’histoire de 
cette demoiselle et de sa chasse, histoire qui est d’ailleurs aussi 
peu intéressante que peu claire.” It is, however, clear at once 
that we are touching fairyland, and that we have to do with an 
episode in which we may detect our author subjecting his mate- 
rial to very much the same sort of treatment that he bestowed 
upon it in his version of the enchanted voyage of Arthur, Urien, 
and Accalon.? In our study of fairy life we have by this time 
learned to suspect the vicinity of faérie when we find before 
our eyes a white stag and brachet, and a splendid uninhabited 
castle. That the quest of the white stag and brachet is prop- 
erly an other-world adventure may be seen by a comparison

with other incidents less complex in their structure in which 
the same theme is prominent, and especially with Perceval’s 
adventure of the Chessboard Castle to which I have had occa- 
sion to refer before.1 
The fairy mistress of the Chessboard Castle refuses to grant Perceval 
her love until he shall bring her the head of the white stag in the forest. 
To aid him in his pursuit, he may take with him her white brachet, adorned, 
as a true fairy dog, with a gold collar? and endowed with supercanine 
intelligence ;* if he does not bring the little dog back with him, he shall 
never have her love. As Perceval is returning with the stag’s head, he is 
despoiled of his brachet by an ungracious maiden (pucidle de malaire) who 
refuses to give the dog back to him until he has fought with a certain

last three passages refer is a fairy hound, when they are compared with the descrip- 
tion of a dog in the Lay of the Great Fool,a Celtic source, with which in the episode 
in question they show a striking agreement (see above, p. 88, note 2, for references 
on this subject). In the Zay (pp. 159 ff.) the dog, a red-eared white hound, is 
owned by an enchanter, and is given to the wife of Amadan Mor, the daughter of 
the King of the Golden Isle —an other-world name. The little dog serves as an 
other-world messenger, for Amadan Mor, the hero, after killing a deer that the dog 
has driven into his path through an enchanted glen, binds the dog, and thus falls 
into a dispute with its owner, which ends with a reconciliation and with Amadan 
Mor’s accompanying the enchanter to his other-world dwelling. In Zibeaus Des- 
conus (vv. 1021 ff.) the little dog in the manifold gay colors of his coat resembles 
Petit Criu, the brachet from Avalon described by Gottfried von Strassburg in the 
passage cited above. In Libeaus Desconus, also, he is owned by Ser Otes de Lyle, 
which is possibly a corruption of Oste(s) de isle (Héte de l’Jle), an other-world 
name. This suggestion I owe to Professor Schofield.

knight. During the fight, Perceval loses both stag’s head and brachet, for 
they are stolen by a passing knight, and the luckless lover thus is once 
more involved in a long series of adventures. One day he chances upon 
the ungracious maiden sitting before a beautiful tent beneath a tree on 
which the stag’s head is hanging. Perceval appropriates the head, but is 
obliged to do battle for it and for the brachet with the maiden’s amz. We 
have previously been told that she is King Pescéor’s daughter, and that she 
has been thwarting Perceval in his task, because of his failure to ask the 
fitting question at the Grail castle. 
Here, as in the episode of /a damozisele cacheresse, the object 
of the quest is to bring back the head of the stag and the fay’s 
white brachet. Perceval is warned that to perform the adven- 
ture completely he must bring back the brachet, just as Gawain 
is told by Merlin that he must return with the hounds unharmed. 
Perceval and Tor in the pursuit of the brachet take their prop- 
erty from a maiden found by Perceval sitting outside a tent, by 
Tor sitting within a tent, and both fight with her am for the 
little dog. These similarities make it seem probable that such 
a story as we know through Gaucher was influencing the author 
of the later prose romance. In the Welsh Pevedur! a some- 
what different form is given to the same adventure. The 
Black Maiden imposes upon the hero the quest of the stag and 
brachet, success in which shall admit him to his loved one’s 
presence, and she also acts the part of the ungracious maiden 
in his subsequent adventures. She, too, concocts all the 
trouble for Peredur that she can in consequence of his failure 
at the Grail castle. Merlin, in the Huth Merlin, makes the 
somewhat surprising statement to Gawain after his return to 
court that his adventure is to be regarded as one of those 
belonging to the Grail, —an apparent irrelevancy increasing 
the probability that in the author’s source this very test of 
Perceval had an influence. 
Though Gawain’s adventures, unlike Tor’s, diverge widely 
from Perceval’s, they belong distinctly to the other world. Not 
only is the stream that must be crossed to reach the beautiful 
castle of the adventure defended, according to Malory, by 
Allardin of the Isles, whose name strongly resembles that of 
the other-world knight, Aalardin del Lac,? but beside occupying

the accepted situation of a magic castle, it is apparently unin- . [. . : 
habited, a mysterious and terrific blast from a horn is heard 
within its walls,! its mistress, like a fay, helps the hero in 
his trouble, and exacts from him the promise to do her will. 
The stag, also, shows its primitive characteristic as a fay’s mes- 
senger by leading the way into the castle,” although unlike the 
typical messenger it does not vanish from sight when its mis- 
sion is accomplished, but serves as the source of a fresh dis- 
turbance for Gawain in his contest with its defender appointed 
by the mistress of the castle. The proper function of the 
knight in our story, however, was probably to maintain a 
“custom” of the castle against a knight brought thither by 
the fay’s messenger; just as the blaze of an immense fire 
attracts knights to the enchanted abode of Helaes, where they 
discover that at the fireside they must encounter an armed 
champion.* The earlier stories with which I have classed the 
episode in the Huth Merlin always demand that the adventure 
appointed by the fay shall in some way lead to her love; this 
is of course made impossible here by the division of the 
adventure between two knights, and further by the sudden 
rape of the lady herself. 
It has seemed worth while to call attention to the general 
character of the episode, because by such an analysis the 
unique part ascribed here to Niniane becomes all the more

3 A parallel'to Gawain’s pursuit of the deer and his combat with the knight 
who has it in his keeping is furnished by the West Highland tale, 7he Fair Gru- 
agach (Campbell, II, 424-450), which, according to Campbell, contains very early 
features. The Fair Chief pursues a deer of marvellous swiftness, which leads him 
across a ford. The deer gives a spring, and the Fair Chief catches it by one of 
the hind legs. The deer roars, and “the Carlin ” — who has not appeared earlier 
in the tale—cries : “Who seized the beast of my love?” (Cf. the grievance of 
the knight in the Huth Merlin, 11, 87,—car il li ont... occhis dedens son ostel 
meesmes la beste el monde que il plus amoit.) She and the Fair Chief have a parley 
in regard to the possession of the magic deer, but the Chief departs with it. This 
is the beginning of a series of bouts between them in the same cause, in one of 
which the Chief slays the Carlin. 4 Livre d’Artus, P., § 148.  
-P-A-G-E-245
  La Damoisele Cacheresse 233 
striking. Oddly enough, in Pellinor’s adventure, which concerns 
the damsel who, we are told, is a fay, there are no distinctively 
fairy features.1_ Her rescue from the champion, her fall on the 
way home, which is apparently a mere excuse for introducing 
the episode of the passing horsemen and the maiden’s expres- 
sion of confidence in Merlin’s power, are incidents that contain 
no suggestion of other-world relations, but look like the flimsy 
concoctions of a prolix narrator. La damotsele cacheresse her- 
self, although later she is said to be sage and hence adapted 
to the acquisition of Merlin’s art,? is neither all-powerful nor 
all-knowing, as an other-world fay should be ; nor, like the fays 
of the streams and forests, is she ever on the alert to win a 
young knight’s love, but she treats the thought of a lover as a 
jest, and lives a virgin life in the woods. She is la damoisele 
cacheresse —a name applied to Niniane only in the romance in 
which this episode occurs,’ — essentially a huntress, offensively 
noisy, even more pronounced a type than the Elfland Queen, 
“a lady that was brisk and bold,” whom Thomas the Rhymer 
saw “come riding o’er the fernie brae.’* The description of 
her appearance suggests much more vividly the figure of a 
Diana of Versailles than that of a fay, such, for example, as — 
Lanval’s gentle mistress, who comes riding with dignity to 
court, carrying her sparrow-hawk on her wrist and followed by 
her hound.® In this episode also we should note that the 
account of the first meeting between Merlin and Niniane is 
completely at variance with that in the Vulgate Merlin, where 
the enchanter finds the beautiful maiden by a fountain in a 
forest of Bretagne.® 
The situation accordingly is that two adventures belonging 
distinctly to fairyland are here connected with a maiden who 
is known in romance as a powerful fay, but who appears in this 
episode as a helpless, impulsive, even stormy, mortal damsel, 
arrayed in huntress garb. Plainly we are here dealing with 
material which combines with the fairy nature ascribed to 
Niniane certain elements foreign to it. Do these non-fairy

elements belong to the original conception of Niniane’s char- 
acter, or are they later accretions? If they are later accretions, 
from what source are they derived? 
As the first step in the solution of these problems, it will be 
well to turn to a series of passages, the significance of which is 
evident as soon as they are brought together. 
1. The fay who takes the young Lancelot under her protec- 
tion rises from the Lac de Dyane.! Niniane, the beloved of 
Merlin, is the maiden who bore Lancelot away to the lake.” 
2. Dionas, a young knight, delights in hunting and takes up 
his abode in the forest of Briosque. The goddess Diane, his 
godmother, visits him and on her departure gives him a “ des- 
tiny” for his first daughter: she shall be so beloved by the 
wisest man who ever has lived that he shall teach her the 
greater part of his skill in necromancy, and shall be able to 
refuse her nothing. This daughter is Niniane.® 
3. In the Merlin (7528)* we learn in addition to the above . 
story that Dionas was named after Dyane, who received her 
name at baptism from her mother, /a seraine de Cecille. When 
Dionas was still a child, Dyane, being a goddess of the sea, 
asked the gods of the sea to allow his first child to be a girl 
full of grace and virtue, and to bestow upon her the same 
“destiny” as that mentioned in the versions given above. 
4. The Dame du Lac, who deceives Merlin, dwells at the 
Lac de Dyane? 
5. Meliadus, a lover of the Dame du Lac, is said to have 
been reared by her mother at the Lac Dyane.® 
6. One passage remains to be mentioned here which is more 
elaborate than the rest and, like the episode of la damotsele 
cacheresse, is found in the Huth Merlin.’ 
Niniane some time after her rescue. by Pellinor leaves the court for her 
home in Norhomberlande, attended by Merlin, who has become enamoured 
of her. They are faring through a small wood of exquisite beauty called 
En Val, when Niniane espies the Lac de Dyane, which she regards with

satisfaction, for Dyane, as she says, ama toute sa vie la deduit del bois 
autant que je fais ou plus. Near by is the marble tomb of Faunus, whose 
story Merlin tells the maiden : — Dyane ruled (szc) in the time of Virgille, 
and loved woodland pleasures. She followed the chase through the forests of 
France and Bretagne, and at length chose this spot for her abode. Faunus, 
the son of a king of the land, saw her and loved her. She granted him her 
love on condition that he never leave her to return to his home, and built a 
beautiful dwelling on the shore of the lake where they lived together. But 
the inconstant Dyane soon began to love another knight, Felix, whom she 
found hunting. He was of lowly origin, and since Dyane realized that if 
their love were discovered, Faunus would kill him, she resolved that Faunus 
must die. There was a tomb near at hand filled with water upon which an 
enchanter, Demophon, had bestowed healing properties. Faunus, one day, 
coming in wounded from the chase, had recourse to the tomb, from which 
Dyane had the water instantly drained away, but on his experiencing the 
pangs of disappointment at finding himself in a dry tomb, Dyane shut 
the lid and promised to cast medicinal herbs through the apertures. No 
sooner was he safely covered up in the tomb than she poured boiling lead 
upon him, and thus put him to death. She reported her deed to Felix, but 
he, scouting her love, beheaded her. Her body was flung into the lake, 
which has ever since been called the Lac de Dyane. 
Niniane is so charmed with the spot that at her request Merlin builds 
her an invisible house on the border of the lake, where she may rest between 
her hunting expeditions, and where they dwell together for some time. 
The story is a strange combination of classical names and 
reminiscences, and of themes from Celtic fairy tradition and 
mediaeval folklore. As the Faunus of classical mythology was 
the son of Picus, king of Latium, so Faunus the lover of Dyane 
is the son of a king; and the name of his rival, Felix, in sig- 
nificance recalls that of Evander (Evavépos), who is connected 
with Faunus in the Lupercalia. 
There is in Roman mythology an obscure god, Virbius, a 
sylvan deity apparently, about whom little is known except that 
he is connected with the worship of Diana at Aricia! and is 
identified with Hippolytus, the beloved of Artemis, who after 
he was raised to life in the presence of A‘sculapius was hidden 
in secrecy at Aricia by the goddess.2 The name of this favorite 
of Diana persists in our own time among the peasants of the 
Romagnuola.? They say that Verbio was a beautiful youth 
who loved a maiden and believed that he was loved in return,

236 La Damoisele Cacheresse 
A stranger with greater charms chanced to come along, and 
the damsel transferred her interest to him. The unfortunate 
Verbio accordingly fell ill ; the girl felt the pricks of conscience, 
and told her new gallant that Verbio’s love was greater than his 
own. She suddenly perceived that he was a devil, and surren- 
dered her soul to him on condition that she be allowed to pass 
years of happiness with Verbio. The end of the story is, as 
Leland observes, quite evidently an addition, but the situation at 
the beginning is the same as that in the early part of the account 
of Diana’s unhappy lover, Faunus. He loves her and believes 
that he has her favor ; the more attractive youth comes in her 
way, and she deserts Faunus for him; her fickleness meets 
with due punishment. When we consider that the Virbius, 
Faunus, and Sylvanus of Roman mythology must almost inevi- 
tably have been confused one with another by the people of 
Gaul,! and all have been classed together on the new soil in 
one great family of sylvan deities, it becomes quite conceiv- 
able that Faunus might have taken the place of Virbius in the 
popular story of a hunter carried away from his home and kept 
in retirement by Diana; and that in the Huth Merlin and the 
tale of the Romagnuola we have two remnants of what was 
perhaps originally one story of Diana and her lover, Virbius. 
The suggestion, however, is perhaps hardly worth considera- 
tion, for we have no information as to the age of the Italian 
story, nor as to the time when it was first associated with 
Verbio ; and were it not that the name Virbius is intimately 
connected with Diana, it would scarcely be justifiable to place 
the incidents side by side. The fickle maiden who disposes of 
one adorer for the sake of a greater novelty is not such a 
rarity in mediaeval literature that we need turn to the peasants 
of the Romagnuola to account for the appearance of the theme 
in a French romance. 
The termination of the Faunus and Dyane episode recalls a 
theme that we know in the lay of Egaitan by Marie de France.”   
Equitan loves the wife of his seneschal and is loved in return. She 
determines to bring about the death of her husband that the course of her 
love for Equitan may be unhindered, and therefore prepares for her lord a

bath of boiling water which will instantly put him to death. But her hus- 
band surprises her with Equitan, who, in the hope of saving himself from 
detection, springs into the scalding bath and meets the fate intended for 
his seneschal. The guilty wife is drowned by her husband in the same 
bath. 
Here the wife, the husband, and Equitan correspond to 
Dyane and her two lovers, the old and the new. The wife 
prepares to bring about her husband’s death by a boiling bath 
in order to enjoy Equitan’s love; Dyane destroys her first 
lover by a bath of boiling lead in order to remove all obstacles 
to her new lover’s passion. The wife dies by the means 
through which she had hoped to gain her own happiness ; 
Dyane dies because of Felix’s indignation at the method that 
she has followed to secure the gratification of her desire.! 
Demophon as the lover of Phyllis is of course a well known 
personage in mediaeval literature, but Demophon as an 
enchanter is obscure. He, however, is by no means the only 
enchanter who endowed water with healing property. Virgil 
himself was said to have made baths to cure the sick at 
«Puchole” near Naples.2 In Celtic mythology we find that 
the Tuatha dé Danann were in the habit of throwing balsamic 
herbs and plants. of healing into the burns and rivers of 
Conaille-Muirthemne in Cuchulinn’s behalf.? According to 
Geoffrey,* the giants who built the Giants’ Dance made heal- 
ing baths among the stones by washing them with a compound 
of herbs, which invariably cured the sick who bathed there. 
Gaston Paris remarks on this entire episode, —“ L’épisode 
de la forét d’Ex Val n’est qu'une imitation anticipée de 
cette histoire” * (i.e., the confinement of Merlin in the tomb by 
Niniane). This is very probably true of the element of the

tomb, which was perhaps suggested to the. compiler by the 
version of Merlin’s imprisonment that he adopted. He mani- 
fests a grim predilection for tales of lovers and tombs, a com- 
bination that he gives us here, in the story of Anasteu and 
his amze, and in that of Merlin and Niniane.! But the par- 
allels cited above show that he may not improbably have had 
before him an independent story of Dyane and her lovers, con- 
taining elements familiar to popular story. 
We thus have a series of passages associating Niniane with 
Diana, no one of which in itself would be of any considerable 
value as evidence of an inherent connection between the fay 
and the goddess, but which taken together, and in addition to 
the episode of /a damoisele cacheresse, are of importance in 
understanding Niniane’s nature. These passages do not deal 
with one consistent account connecting Niniane and Diana. 
One version makes Niniane’s father, Dionas, a godson and name- 
sake of Dyane, who gives Niniane a “destiny” before her 
birth; three make her dwell at the Lac de Dyane; one says 
that her mother dwells there ; one recounts a story which attrib- 
utes to Dyane a treatment of her lover similar to that which, 
according to the same romance, Niniane bestows upon Merlin ; 
still another, while obscuring the fairy nature of Niniane, ‘rep- 
resents her as an obstreperous huntress reminding us of Diana, 
the leader of the Wild Hunt, and also ascribes to her distinctly 
the qualities of Diana, 
“ Fair silver-shafted queen for ever chaste, 
. . . [who] set at nought 
The frivolous bolt of Cupid, ... 
... and she was queen o’ the woods.” 
Niniane’s virginal purity is, as a rule, insisted upon in the 
sources, and a dread lest Merlin should sully it is her persistent 
motive for confining him.” 
1 See i6., II, 192 ff. 
2 Cf. Prophecies, pp. \xx, xxi; see below, p. 226, note, for the contrast in this 
respect between Niniane and other maidens to whom Merlin imparts his magic art. 
There are two further resemblances between Diana and Niniane which deserve 
merely to be noted: — The mid-day demon is especially in evidence at noon on 
St. John’s Day, as the mid-hour of the mid-day of the year, and it is on the feast

In the Diana myth and in fairy tradition there are certain 
parallel elements,! and in fact we have already seen the part of 
a fay attributed to Diana in the prose romances. In the story 
and attributes of one special fay, Niniane, there is an echo of the 
old Diana myth that lingered about the lakes and woods. The 
path that leads from the clearly defined Diana of antiquity to 
her fairy counterpart is as elusive and uncertain as the goldene 
Bricke on the waves of a lake, but that popular imagination 
had in truth constructed it there can be little doubt. 
There is one element in the Niniane material that is perhaps a 
direct outcome of her association with Diana. In those sources 
where her connection with the goddess is the less emphasized,? 
she is not identified with the Dame du Lac who fostered 
Lancelot, except in the Exglish Merlin, where at a later point 
in the narrative and in a different context, mention is made of 
«Niniane, the lady of the lake that brought Lancelot up ten- 
derly” ;3 the English Merlin, however, is late enough to have 
suffered contamination in its material. In the versions where 
the connection with Diana is more emphasized‘ either the 
authors take pains to explain that the lady who deceives 
Merlin was the same who bore Lancelot away to the lake ;> 
or, as in the Prophecies, she is called throughout only the Dame 
du Lac, never Niniane, and is represented as the guardian of 
Lancelot ;® or, as in Malory, she is denominated one of the 
damoysels of the lake,’ or the [chief | lady of the lake,’ and her 
partiality for Lancelot is implied.° Nowhere except in one 
beautiful and clever cousin is Lunete (see Livre d’Artus, P., §§ 89ff.); but to 
this remote connection with Luna I would attach no importance, especially as 
the episode in which it occurs is based on a familiar other-world theme — the 
adventure of the Perilous Fountain, —and is not pure Niniane material.

    240 La Damoisele Cacheresse 
manuscript of the Lancelot, cited by Jonckbloet, does the collo- 
cation occur, Mixiane who brought up Lancelot,! or the Dame 
du Lac whose name was Niniane. In other words, the 
persistent relations are that Niniane is Merlin’s love, and the 
Dame du Lac, Lancelot’s guardian ; the occasional relations 
that Niniane is the Dame du Lac, Lancelot’s guardian, and 
the Dame du Lac is Merlin’s love, Lancelot’s guardian. 
Two fays, accordingly, one the beguiling mistress, the other 
the guardian of a child, are represented as one person, but each 
with the distinction of her class preserved. Their point of 
contact is the Lac de Dyane. This gives the key to the situa- 
tion. A fay, the denizen of a lake, the fosterer of children, 
might readily be associated with Diana, the tutelary deity of a 
lake, one of whose special attributes was to care for an infant’s 
birth. Thus it might be easy and natural to associate the 
Dame du Lac with the Lac de Dyane, and in this way with the 
fay, Niniane, in whom some of the attributes of Diana had 
already centred. 
Why should Niniane be the fay in whom we see a reflection 
of Diana?? In French literature, so far as I have been able 
to discover, no trace of Niniane’s name exists previous to its 
connection with Merlin, and it is altogether reserved for his 
fairy mistress. It has served, moreover, as a means for eliciting 
sundry conjectures from scholars, none of which have been 
wholly adequate to account for her personality. In two of the 
Welsh poems attributed to the bard Myrrdin, the Avadllenau® 
and the Hozanau,* certain prophetic words are put into the 
mouth of one designated as hwimleian, huimleian, chwimpleian, 
chwibleian, chwivileian,’ a word which is translated Szbyl by 
VII, xii; fo. 152 1°: — Mimenne qui Lancelot norri au lac. 
2 See Malory, Bk. XVIII, ch. 21, for a description of a maiden who belongs 
to the same type as /a damorsele cacheresse, but who is not definitely associated 
with Diana.

Skene, Vymphe by San Marte.! In an interpolated text of the 
Avallenau contained in the Myvyrian Archaiology? there are a 
few lines describing her, which are available in San Marte’s 
translation :— 
Die Nymphe welche erscheint und verschwindet weissagt deutlich 
In Bildern von unruhigen Zeiten, die sicherlich kommen werden.’ 
This personage is regarded by Villemarqué,t by Maury,> who 
accepts Villemarqué’s statements, and by Thomas Price ® as the 
original for the Vivian of the romances.’ V7v/ian, Villemarqué 
says, is a name changed by the romancers into Vivian. Price 
admits that ‘it is true there is not much resemblance in the 
names,” but adds that Chwifletan by the French writers of 
romance might be easily modified into Viviane. The word 
Hwimleian in its various forms, according to Gaidoz,’ means 
neither sibyl nor nymph, but is a proper name of unknown 
etymology. Hence Paris® rejects the evidence as wholly insuf- 
ficient for the identification of Vivian with Chwyblian; but 
Ninienne, which he considers the original form of the name, 
is altogether of a Celtic cast, he says, and in confirmation 
of this statement he cites the: name of the Irish saint, 
Ninianus. 
Rhys sees an identity between Pelleas, whose experiences 
Malory recounts," and Pwyll, whose story is told in the Madino- 
gion,” and on this basis he draws a comparison not only in story, 
but also in name between Niniane, whom he calls the Lady of 
the Lake, the love of Pelleas, and Rhiannon, the wife of Pwyll. 
«“ Even the names of the former,” he says, “distorted as they are to 
Nyneue in Malory and Wiviene in the Huth Merlin, admit of being traced 
back by easy steps of misreading and miscopying to that of Rhiannon,

which in the 12th century and later would be written Riannon. Thus 
Nyneue and Niviene point back to the prototypes nifen and ninien respec- 
tively as any one will see who knows anything about our old manuscripts. 
But besides the common confusion of ~ and w, of zz, xz and wz, there was 
also that of open a with z, which makes nifien the possible result of mis- 
reading niunen for niané or nianen. Further the consonant 7 ! in thé writing 
usual in Wales till the advent of the Normans, was easily mistaken for an 
n, in case the first limb was carelessly left insufficiently prolonged below 
the line. This is one of the misreadings evidenced elsewhere in the 
romancers’ reproduction of Welsh names, and assuming it here, we step 
from nianen to Yianen. Lastly the scribe’s predilection for certain forms 
must always count for something, and other instances, such as Natiien, 
or Nascien, for Welsh Nwython, illustrate the substitution of ze (for on) 
making nianon into nianien; so we pass from Yianien to rianon, which 
comes sufficiently near Riannon, the old Welsh spelling of Rhiannon.” 
Two similarities Rhys finds between the parts played by 
Niniane and Rhiannon. Each takes the initiative in her love 
affair, Niniane with Pelleas, Rhiannon with Pwyll; Rhiannon, 
he says, as well as Niniane, was a kind of lake-lady, and he 
cites in confirmation of this an incident in which Rhiannon 
plays a part similar to that of the lake-lady Liban,” and also 
the fact that Rhiannon is the owner of magic birds whose 
warbling is heard clearly on land while they are really singing 
far out above the sea. 
Of these three explanations that of Villemarqué is built up 
on almost the slenderest possible basis of characteristic and a 
resemblance in name so faint as to be barely perceptible. 
Paris gives us the satisfaction of seeing an existing masculine 
name, the feminine of which may be the fay’s, but leaves us no 
clearer knowledge as to who the bearer of this name is. In the 
third case, the theory rests upon a hypothetical tortuous course 
of written sources, upon a community of incident which is so 
universal in the histories of fays as to be entirely without sig- 
nificance — for who among them does not take the initiative in 
securing the hero’s love? —and upon a stage of tradition that pre- 
supposes the identity of Niniane and the Dame du Lac, hence, as 
we have seen, not upon an original phase of Niniane’s nature. 
There is, however, in Celtic tradition the name of a fay, 
which doubtless ere now would have been recognized as the 
possible original of Mindane, if the resemblance in the stories

connected with the two names had been noticed. The Irish 
poem known as the Lay of Ozsin in the Land of Youth, is 
attributed to Michael Comyn, who lived about 1749, but there 
is good reason to believe that it embodies early material? 
The poet sings of a misty morning when the Fianna went out to hunt. 
The golden-haired Niamh, the beautiful daughter of the King of the Land 
of Youth, comes riding toward them, and easily persuades Oisin to obey 
her summons to the Land of Youth. She bears him away across the sea 
on her milk white steed to a land that is as fair as Paradise; here he 
forgets time and home, and unwittingly passes three hundred years of 
happiness with Niamh. Then the inevitable desire of the mortal hero to 
return to earth seizes him. Niamh reluctantly lets him go, but charges 
him not to alight from his horse on pain of becoming a decrepit old man. 
He disobeys the command and suffers the penalty. 
In the Acallamh na Senérach* a tale is told of Niamh, daughter of the 
king of Munster, who eloped with Oisin and took up her abode with him by 
a certain well, known as the “well of women.” “The damsel with her 
thirty women used to come every morning, and in this blue-surfaced water 
they would wash their faces and their hands.” Here she was found bath- 
ing by the King of Munster and his hosts, who came in pursuit of the truant 
Oisin. In shame and grief Niamh laid her head upon the ground and with 
her companions died. Henceforth the hill has been called the hill of 
slaughter. 
Although the Acallamh na Senérach is by no means an early 
source‘ this story furnishes no inconsiderable evidence of the 
comparatively early date of the material in the Lay of Oisin. It 
is evidently a rationalized version of the same theme attached, 
as the legends of the Acallamh na Senérach in general are, to 
a certain locality in explanation of a topographical name. The 
“elopement” is merely a less happy term for the summons of 
a fairy mistress, the “well of women” is a commonplace name 
for Emain, the Land of Women, the Land of Everliving Women, 
Metdeland, Chastel as Pucidles ; Oisin’s escape from the world 
and his retired life with Niamh beside the well is doubtless 
simply the happy experience of a hero who has been enticed 
away from men by a fay to dwell with her in her own abode.®

To turn now fo a moment to an earlier mythological figure. 
We have seen that there is reason to believe that three Irish 
war-goddesses, Ana, Macha and Morrigan, are developed by 
legend into fays. Another of the ancient Irish goddesses 
of battle, apparently by no means so prominent a divinity 
nor so distinct a personality as the Morrigan, is Neman,! wife 
of Neit, the god of battle; ‘venomous were the pair... and 
both were evil.”? A natural supposition might be that her 
name affords a possible original for Niniane, but there is noth- 
ing in the history of either being to indicate an immediate con- 
nection between them. There is, however, in the external 
similarity of the names sufficient reason for a misunderstand- 
ing or confusion, by which a fay Niamh, and not Neman, 
appears in Celtic legend. In any event, the examples show 
that Vzamh was a not uncommon Celtic name, that it was 
given to a fay, and was connected with the same theme that 
forms the kernel of the story told of Niniane, that of a 
mortal’s retention by a fay in an enchanted dwelling. 
Since the Celtic final m/ has a spirant value,? Wiamh would 
possibly appear in a French written source as Viave,* which 
might easily become Wane.’ It is to the existence, at one 
time, of just such a form as this latter that the references to 
the name of Merlin’s love, and the attempted explanations 
point. «Si ot non en baptesme Viviane & ce est .i. nom en 
kardeu (Hari. Ms., Caldien) qui soune autant en franchois com 
sele disoit xocant ne ferai, & se torna sor merlin la besoigne

Le Roi Artus by Paulin! Paris coincides, with a difference in 
spelling in the definition of the name : — néant ou naant ne ferat. 
The Merlin (1528), says that Nymanne “ est ung nom de caldee 
qui est a dire en francois rzex nen feraye: ce nom se tourna dessus 
Merlin car ceste fille fut sage et si prudente que bien se sceut 
garder de plusieurs deceptions.” In the English Merlin® we 
read :— ‘“‘Hir name was cleped Nimiane, and it is a name of 
ebrewe that seith in frensch ment neu feraz, that is to sey in 
english, I shall not lye, and this turned upon Merlin as ye shall 
here her-after.”’ This last interpretation obviously comes from 
a misreading of ment for nzent. Even without knowing of any 
possible original, we should infer that Niniane is surely a 
foreign name, quite possibly a learned name, that had puzzled 
some worthy narrator, and led him from the sounds of familiar 
syllables to construct a phrase significant of a maiden’s deep- 
laid protestations of innocence, which Merlin learned were not 
to be trusted. To what origin he assigned the name made 
very little difference to the story-teller so long as he selected a 
source sufficiently remote, and Chaldaic or any unusual tongue 
answered the purpose equally well. The name Escalibourc is 
treated in the English Merlin after the same fashion :— “and 
the letteres that were write on the swerde seide that the right 
name was cleped Escalibourc, whiche is a name in ebrewe, 
that is to sey in englissh, kyttynge, Iren, tymber, and steill.” ¢ 
From their comments alone it would appear that the authors 
are explaining a name which was spelled WVezane, Neiene, Niane, 
or WViene,° and which as a foreign name was associated by

on leaving the palace he explains by an inscription that he writes in Hebrew over

5 Such a form as one of these Heinrich von dem Tiirlin (Diu Créne, v. 1603) 
may have had before him, when in a list of ladies at Arthur’s court he placed 
Neini (variant Neyn) die twerginne. He is perhaps interpreting Neini as Maine, 
a.French word that might have been suggested to him by any one of the hypo- 
thetical spellings for Niniane’s name which we have seen that the passages quoted 
above imply.

French hearers with that combination of French words (ntent 
ne) nearly identical with it in sound (i.e., zane). Obviously, 
however, although the explanations of the name apply to any 
of the forms that I have just mentioned (Neiane, Neiene, Niane, 
Niene), they do not apply to the actual spelling of the name 
employed by the compilers, who apparently knew it with an 
additional Ni— at the beginning, and hence either are dis- 
regarding a syllable, or are credulously accepting an explana- 
tion of an earlier form of the name than that which they used 
in their story. I have already mentioned Paris’s recognition 
of a connection between the names Minzanus and MVinienne. 
From Mave there might be made Miane, Niniane in the same 
way that the Latin Minzanus was formed from Menn, Neann, 
Nein, the popular forms of the name of St. Ninian, a fifth 
century Irish apostle among the Britons and Southern Picts.! 
It is altogether plausible, then, to suppose that a story of 
Merlin and Niane passed through a Latin medium,? in which 
the fay was named Niniana, before a French redactor ren- 
dered her name Winiane.® 
In addition to the implication of the passages explaining 
Niniane’s name, her association with Diana supplies another 
1 The earliest latinization of St. Ninian’s name that we know is Ninia, the form 
used by Bede, Alcuin, and William of Malmesbury. In the Irish calendar the 
saint’s name has the prefix mo, in the forms Monenn, Maoineann, Monein. Dur- 
ing the Irish occupation of Whithearn we hear of the names Nennio, Monennus. 
See Forbes, Life of St. Ninian and St. Kentigern (Historians of Scotland), Edin- 
burgh, 1874, V, v; Rev. Ce/t., XIX (1898), 97. This name suggests a possible 
popular form for Nennius. The later latinization of St. Ninian’s name, which 
is not established until after the time of St. Ailred (ob. 1166) is Ninianus (see 
Forbes, p. 256, note B). The influence of the earlier forms of Ninia, treated as 
an a stem, and hence looking like a feminine, may have produced from Niave > 
Niane a latinization Niniania>Niniana, owing to the fact that -ava is the more 
common termination. It is, however, in no way necessary to assume any direct 
influence of Vinianus upon NMiniane ; the two cases are parallel. 
Even the form Niamh might have been latinized into Niniana; cf. Geoffrey of 
Monmouth’s latinization of Teilav, Chelianus ; Hist. Brit., Bk. IX, ch. xv. 
2 Popular stories passed through a Latin medium in many instances; Johannes 
de Alta Silva, for example, made a Latin version of popular stories, which Herbert 
worked over in the Dolopfathos. See also Tyolet, vv. 27 ff.; Wulff, Lai du Cor, 
by Biquet, Lund and Paris, 1888, p. 8; Lays of Graelent, etc., p. 175, note I. 
8 Niniane’s name occurs in the French romances in the following forms : —

indication that before a learned clerk made his Latin version 
of the story, the fay was known in France as Wane, or that by 
the side of the Latin form this popular name survived for a 
time. Vane is sufficiently near to Déane to account for the 
partial identification of Niniane with the goddess.

Either an original Niniane (Nynyane) or Niniene, owing to the nasal vowel in 
the penult would almost certainly bring the other with it, and from either of these 
forms by an obvious error, such as we have already seen exemplified in the Zng- 
lish Merlin in the misunderstanding of xien¢ for ment, there might arise Vimane, 
Nimanne (Nymanne), Nimaine, Nimenne,— forms which are evidently the basis 
for the spellings with m in the English texts. By the very common scribal inter- 
change of and v, we may explain from Méniene the variant Wivienne in the 
Lancelot, as well as the forms in the Huth Merlin, where we evidently have to do 
with a scribe indifferent to spelling, since he never uses the same form of the name 
twice. Viviene may be regarded as an intermediate to Viviane (-enne), a form the 
adoption of which may have been assisted by the name of the hero Vivian, promi- 
nent in the Garin de Montglane cycle. The forms preserved, therefore, support a 
primitive Niniane. Similar vagaries in the’spelling of proper names are common- 
place in the romances. As variants for Neroneus de I’Ile, there occur Neroveus, 
Noroneaus, Noroneans, Neron, Norneaus, Veroneus (see Léseth, §92, note 3). 
Vannes appears as Vanes, Venes, Nantes (see Rom., XXVIII, 1899, p. 215,

CHAPTER XV 
THE THREE IMPORTANT FAYS OF ARTHURIAN 
ROMANCE 
ALTHOUGH we have learned, even as Spenser did, that faérie 
is. “exceeding spacious and wide,” yet all paths have led prac- 
tically in one direction. The kernel of the traditions con- 
nected with Morgain, the Dame du Lac, and Niniane is found 
in the typical Celtic fairy-mistress story, which antedates at 
the latest the eighth century. Yet all three fays possess a dis- 
tinct individuality, and although Morgain has by far the most 
important mythological significance, each represents a separate 
imaginative conception. We must therefore reject the view 
of Rhys that the Lady of the Lake and Niniane “may be 
taken as different aspects of the one mythic figure, the lake- 
lady Morgen,”?! for not only were they originally three dis- 
tinct beings, but, although the Lady of the Lake and Niniane 
are sometimes confused in story, each of the three fays retains 
in general her own personality. 
Our study has shown us also that three important principles 
operate in producing the fay of Arthurian romance. The 
established character or tradition of the hero is here the deter- 
minative element in the episode, and this fact frequently trans- 
forms the part of the fay from its original state. Moreover, the 
fay is not a wholly simple product, but although primarily the 
creation of Celtic myth, she has attracted to herself from other 
sources the traditions of supernatural beings, and has been 
influenced by Roman and even Scandinavian myth. In the 
third place, the tendency to rationalization has altered her 
original character. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the 
Celtic other world and its inhabitants were continually brought 
nearer to the courtly life of France, until the distant land 
of Mag Mell lay for the writer of romance in a wonderful 
mediaeval castle on the bank of a stream, and the fairy mistress

  The Three Important Fays of Arthurian Romance 249 
was only a beautiful maiden taught the necromantic art by 
wise masters, and even was so far associated with this world 
that a poet could identify her in his imagination with his own 
lady. The study of Morgain, the Dame du Lac, and Niniane 
in turn has made it evident that in the fairy lore of Arthurian 
romance we are dealing with rationalized myth, which produces 
a strangely incongruous and incomprehensible whole, unless it 
is interpreted in the light of Celtic tradition. That to each of 
the most important fays of the Arthurian cycle a Celtic origin 
is to be assigned is a view evidently enforced by an investiga- 
tion of their nature.

MORGAIN IN FRENCH SOURCES OF THE THIRTEENTH 
AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES 
I 
FLORIANT ET FLORETE 
Tue tradition of Morgain that is recorded in the thirteenth- 
century romance, Floriant et Florete, domiciles her in Sicily on 
Mongibello.1_ Here she brings up the young Floriant, hither 
by a stag messenger she guides him when the time has come 
for his removal from earth,? and this is the land to which she 
purposes bringing her brother, Arthur, when he is mortally 
wounded.? Morgain’s connection with Sicily, as Graf* has 
pointed out, is indirectly explained by a popular tradition 
recorded both by Gervasius of Tilbury,® who paid a visit to Sicily 
about the year 1190, and also by his contemporary, Caesarius 
of Heisterbach,® according to which the wounded King Arthur 
rests in a beautiful palace situated on a smiling plain on the 
roughest slope of Mongibello., This special phase of the 
Arthurian legend that we find actually domesticated in Sicily 
Graf, and even more earnestly Zimmer, believes to be due 
to the Normans, who were in intimate communication with the 
Bretons before the eleventh century, and who when they came 
to Sicily doubtless imported the Breton stories with which they 
were familiar.” 
In the versions of Gervasius and Caesarius Morgain has no 
place, and it is probably simply in consequence of the legend

No other lines in the Morgain saga connect Morgain directly 
with the sea.2 Moreover in Sicily the name of the fay lives 
to-day in the mirage that appears near Messina, the /aca

the seventeenth century, reports a belief in his time of the 
presence of Morgain near Pelorus :— “ Haec vero de sirenibus 
fabula aliam vulgi de saga quadam cui nomen Morgana, narra- 
tionem aeque fabulosam in memoriam mihi revocat, quoniam et 
haec ad delicias tractus Peloritani declarandas inventa videtur. Placido Reyna, a Sicilian writer of 
1 Floriant et Florete, vv. 550-554. 
2 The modern inhabitants of Ouessant, one of the islands off the coast of 
Armorica, are said to believe in the Morganezed (masc. Morganed ), a race of little 
people, blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked, fair to see, who are addicted to the habit common 
with maidens of the streams of combing their curling golden locks with golden 
combs on the banks of rivers (see Luzel, Voyage a Ple d’Ouessant, Revue de 
France, V, Mars, 1874, 187, 207; Contes Populaires de Basse-Bretagne, Paris, 1887, 
Il, 257-272; Loth, Rev. Celt, XIII, 1892, 497. Sébillot, Trad. et Sup. dela 
Hi. Bretagne, I, additions to p. 92, refers to a study by Luzel, Les Fées des houles des 
Cétes-du-Nord, les Morganes de Pile d’Ouessant et les Femmes volantes, announced 
for the Bulletin de la Société archéologique du Finistere, April or May, 1881). We 
have not enough information to warrant much theorizing about them. Their 
name may, perhaps, be more properly connected with such a form as the Welsh 
Morganiaid, the term by which Pelagians is translated in Article IX of the Book 
of Common Prayer, than with Morgain la fde (see Rh¥s, Celtic Folklore, Oxford, 
1901, p. 373). If they represent in name and traits a survival of early tradition, it 
is possible that a misunderstanding of Morgain’s name associated her with them. 
The modern name in Ouessant for fays of the streams is said to be Mary- 
Morgant; see Lot, Rom., XXVIII (1899), 326, note 3; RhYs, Celtic Folklore, 
P. 375:

  252 Li Jus Adan 
Formosissimam ibs esse sagam narrant, quae terram nostram 
incolat ac saepe numero, qua potentia praedita sit, admirabili 
ratione demonstrat.”1_ The association in the popular mind 
between fairydom and a mirage which charms with its beauty 
and then vanishes as suddenly as the magic castle at dawn 
is not unusual;? the recurrence of the natural phenomenon 
with which Morgain, the wonder-working fairy queen, had 
become connected, rather than a-peculiar tenacity of the Mor- 
gain tradition in Sicily, has quite possibly served to perpetuate 
her name there. 
The localization of the tradition near Messina and the asso- 
ciation of Morgain with the sea in Sicily, since sirens and fays 
are often identified? may not at all improbably have been 
influenced by the stories of the sirens who from antiquity have 
been connected with this region.

LI JUS ADAN¢ 
Li Jus Adan, written ca. 1262, represents perhaps as wide a 
divergence from the original traditions of Morgain as any source 
before the fourteenth century. The scene here in which Mor- 
gain appears is characterized by the popular conception of the 
fays as people to be dreaded by honest folk and viewed with 
displeasure by the church.® 
A monk one evening is collecting offerings for the saints from a crowd 
of people in a part of Arras, to which Morgain and her attendants are in

Before they appear, Crokesot, a messenger from the fairy monarch Helle- 
kin,! joins the group, bringing to Morgain an offer of love from his master. 
Morgain enters with her companions, Maglore and Arsile, and all three seat 
themselves at the table prepared for them. Morgain and Arsile proceed to 
give riches, love, beauty, success to the two citizens who have made such 
admirable preparations for them, but Maglore, who is vexed at the discov- 
ery that no knife has been laid at her place, awards ill fortune. Morgain 
next turns her attention to Crokesot. When she hears his message she 
assures him that she has. given her affection to Robert Soumeillons, an 
excellent young man of the town of Arras, and that Hellekin sighs in vain; 
but Arsile and Crokesot easily persuade her to think better of the charms 
of Hellekin and to promise to be his ade forever. The gathering is 
broken up by Dame Douce, who wishes Morgain’s assistance in bringing to 
disgrace a certain man. The fays flit away singing, —

LA CHANSON D’ESCLARMONDE 2 
La Chanson ad’ Esclarmonde is one of the continuations of 
the Huon de Bordeaux. Here Morgain appears as the mother 
of Auberon, but her part has nothing peculiarly characteristic 
about it, and the scene in which she is most prominent is 
strangely influenced by legends of the church. 
Morgain is mentioned as present at Auberon’s death bed, and as pre- 
pared to extend courtesies to Arthur and Huon, who are at Monmur, 
Auberon’s palace, at the time of his death. Auberon has made Huon his 
heir, but Arthur has disputed Huon’s right to inherit Faérie on the ground 
that he is married to a mortal, Esclarmonde. Auberon therefore has decreed 
that Arthur and Huon shall settle their claims by combat after his death. 
Since in the combat neither succeeds in vanquishing the other, they decide 
to meet every year on the same day and try their chances again. Huon 
remains at Monmur with Esclarmonde. In answer to a wish of his, all 
the fays of fairyland appear before him, Dame Oriande, Dame Marse, 
Sebile, and Morgain being especially in evidence. Morgain is spokes- 
woman, and assures Huon of the loyalty of the fays; but they refuse to 
obey him unless he takes a fay for his wife. Huon drops fainting into ‘the 
arms of Morgain, who is ready to offer him the consolations of religion and

Esclarmonde to the Earthly Paradise to Jesus, and entreat Him to turn her 
into a fay. Without delay they hurry Esclarmonde off through the air to 
the Earthly Paradise, and plunge her into the Fountain of Youth. In 
answer to a prayer of Morgain’s Jesus comes to them, breathes upon the 
lips of Esclarmonde, whispers in her ear, signs her thrice with the sign of 
the cross, places her feet upon His own, and instantaneously she is wafted 
into the air and endowed with the true fairy virtue forever. The fays in 
their joy at the result take a bath in the fountain, and Morgain proceeds to 
test Esclarmonde’s newly acquired graces by bidding her wish the entire 
company back to Monmur. Esclarmonde obeys, and the five fays at once 
stand before Huon. Morgain presents his regenerated spouse to him, 
arrays her in magnificent raiment and crowns her. Huon bestows a compli- 
mentary crown upon the four great fays with the approval of all fairydom.

BRUN DE LA MONTAIGNE 
In Brun de la Montaigne! a romance of the fourteenth 
century, Morgain is a powerful fay, the mistress of a castle 
where fair ladies dwell, and where young knights are welcome 
guests. Her part is entirely free from any distinctive charac- 
teristics.

1 The following spellings which are not important or significant may be 
explained from the above early forms :— Morguen, Erec, var., vv. 1957, 42203 
Prose Erec, vax., p. 264; Didot-Perceval, 1, 502 (cf. Morgwen, a form cited by 
Bellamy, Le Forét de Bréchéliant, Rennes, 1896, I, 129). This spelling may be 
due to the influence of the forms in » acting upon Morgue. So also Morguain 
(Auberon, vv. 1219, 1250, 1415), Morguain (Lancelot, U1, \xxi), Mourguein (Le 
Mantel mal taillé, pp. 126 ff.) look as if they might be the result of an attempt to 
combine the accusative Morgain and the nominative Morgue. Mourgue is a form 
cited from ancient manuscripts without authority by Legrand d’Aussy (Fadliaux 
bu Contes, 1,152). Mourgues and Morgene are also forms used by modern writers 
without mention of authority (Reiffenberg, Pxilippe Mouskés, Brussels, 1838, 
p. cxxxviii; Bellamy, as above, I, 208). Morgaine (Chevalier du Papegaut, ed. 
Heuckenkamp, Halle, 1896, p. 11) is, like Morgane (p. 258, note 2), an attempt 
to give the name a feminine termination. Morgne (English Merlin, pp. 86, 374, 
375; Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight, vv. 2446, 2452), Morgn (Parlement of 
the thre Ages, v. 511) are due probably to scribal errors in writing Morgue. 
Morgein (Arthour and Merlin, v. 4445 ; Le Vallon des faux Amants, pp. 156 ff.), 
Morgeins (English Merlin, 86) may be explained as bearing the same relation to 
Morgain as Gawein to Gauvain, Ewein to Yuain. 
With Morgue cf. the Danish Morgua (see above, p. 75, note 8), the Icelandic 
Morgna (lvens Saga, ed. Kélbing, Halle, 1898, ix, 21), the Swedish Muvena, 
Danish Murne (Herr Ivan Lejon-Riddaren, ed. Liffmann and Stephens, Stock- 
holm, 1848). With the forms in -we/n cf. the spellings in the Dutch Lancelot, — 
Morgucin (v. 13,667), Morgueyn (s) (vv. 22,881, 22,968, 23,071, 23,264, 23,391, 
23,396, 23,408, 23,759), Morgueyne (vv. 23,148, 23,558), Morguweyn (v. 13,654), Morguyen (vv. 22,942, 23,006, 23,026, 23,089), Margueyn (v. 22,954). With 
Morgain cf. the Greek Mopyatvy (dative; Zristan, II, 270; see above, p. 141), 
and the Spanish Morgayna (Huth Merlin, I, xc, El baladro del sabio Merlino, cap. 
xxii). Some of the above references I have obtained from the complete and 
valuable collection of names for an Onomasticon of Arthurian Romance that Miss 
Alma Blount (Ph.D.) is preparing for publication. 
? Although this form of the name is undeclined in the early instances, it exhibits 
the fluctuations between the nominative and accusative customary in thirteenth- 
century French. On the relation of Morgan to Morgain, see p. 152, note 1. See 
also p. 267. 8 See above, p. 132.

Rhfs (Hibbert Lectures, p. 229, note 1 ; cf. Celtic Folklore, Oxford, 1901, p. 374,

Loquifer, pp. 248, 256). Morgane is used in a late source, the Vallon des faux

EXCURSUS III 
MORGAN TUD 
I 
ACCORDING to the Welsh Geraint, Edeyrn, the son of Nudd, came one 
day to Arthur’s court grievously wounded. ‘And Arthur caused Morgan 
Tud to be called to him. He was the chief physician. ‘Take with thee 
Edeyrn, the son of Nudd, and cause a chamber to be prepared for him, and 
let him have the aid of medicine as thou wouldst do unto myself, if I were 
wounded, and let none into his chamber to molest him, but thyself and thy 
disciples to administer to him remedies.’ ‘I will do so gladly, Lord,’ said 
Morgan Tud.”? 
On another occasion Geraint, who was absent from court on adventure, 
came sorely wounded and in pitiable plight to an encampment of Arthur’s 
in the forest, and was welcomed gladly by the king. «Arthur also called 
Kadyrieith, and ordered him to pitch a tent for Geraint, and the physicians, 
and he enjoined him to provide him with abundance of all that might be 
requisite for him. And Kadyrieith did as he had commanded him. And 
Morgan Tud and his disciples were brought to Geraint. And Arthur and 
his hosts remained there nearly a month whilst Geraint was being healed. 
And when he was fully recovered, Geraint came to Arthur, and asked his 
permission to depart. ‘I know not if thou art quite well.’ «In truth I am, 
Lord,’ said Geraint. ‘I shall not believe thee concerning that, but the 
physicians that were with thee.’ So Arthur caused the physicians to be 
summoned to him, and asked them if it were true. ‘It is true, Lord,’ said 
Morgan Tud. So the next day Arthur permitted him to go forth, and he 
pursued his journey.” ? 
These instances of the name Morgan Tud are unique, nor 
do we know of any physician of Arthur with whom this 
personage is to be identified. In the scene in Chrétien’s Evec 
corresponding to the first of those cited above from Geraint, 
when Yder (Edeyrn) arrives at court, he is disarmed by squires, 
but there is no mention of the care of his wounds, still less of 
a physician? In the second case, Erec is healed by a magic 
ointment that had been given Arthur by Morgain (Morgue) his 
sister.*

In the morning Erec rises, apparently with no more wounds to trouble 
him, and fares forth on his way.? 
Although Morgan Tud’s name occupies so little space in

scholars, who have sought to connect the first part of the name 
with that of the fay, Morgain, and to give to the second an

appropriate significance. Rh¥s1 proposes emending the text to 
Morgant Hut (or hid), and then postulates a meaning for the 
result. ‘Hut, now hdd,” he says, “means z/usion or enchant- 
ment, but there must have been a word sud also, meaning one 
who practised illusion or enchantment, an elf or fairy,’— con- 
clusions too conjectural to be regarded seriously. According 
to Zimmer,? Morgan Tud can be explained only by the fact 
that Morgain la fée was an entirely unknown figure in the 
Welsh saga. The combination of Morgan and Tud is, he says, 
“scheinbar ganz sinnlos.” 
“ Morgan ist ein bekannter und oft vorkommender kymr. Mannsname, 
dessen altkymr. Form Morcant ware.... Nimmt man zu der Tatsache, 
dass Morgan ein haufig vorkommender kymr. Mannsname ist, noch die 
andere, dass fiir einen kymrischen Erzahler jener Zeit ein Leibarzt am Hofe 
Artur’s selbstverstaindlich war... dann ist klar, wie ein kymr. Bearbeiter 
ganz von selbst dazu kam aus der ihm unbekannten Morgain la fée oder la 
sage den Morgan penn medygon (Morgan Haupt der Aerzte) an Artur’s Hof 
zu machen. Was wollte er aber mit dem Zusatz Tud sagen? Kymr. ‘ud 
ist ein ganz gewohnliches Wort.... Im Kymr. hat das Wort seit Beginn der 
Litteratur nur die Bedeutung ‘a region, a district.’... Da die kymr. Bedeu- 
tung von /ud Alter ist als die Romanze Geraint, so kann bei der Deutung 
von Tud in Morgan Tud nur von ihr ausgegangen werden und dann ist der 
Zusatz sinnlos. ... Wenn nun der Name Morgan Tud in seinem zweiten Teil 
weder direkt aus der Quelle klar ist noch aus der bekannten und sichern 
Bedeutung von ¢wd, dann scheint nur ein Drittes méglich: er beruht auf 
einem Missversténdnis der Vorlage.... Morgan Tud ist in’s Franz. 
tibersetzt ‘ Morgan le pays.’ Der Welshman betrachtete Morgan la fée als 
Eigenname und verdolmetschte ihn sich als Morgan Tud (Morgan le pays). 
Nun ist vd im Kymr. wie iiberhaupt im Kelt. ein Femininum; einem 
im Franzésischen, nicht festen Welshman lag daher in Gedanken ein 
la pays = tud nahe. 
«“ Hierzu kommt ein zweites. Im Kymr.. .. erscheint ein mit... / anlau- 
tendes [Wort] mit 4 oder #/ (gesprochen und auch in Handschriften 
geschrieben /).... 
“Wenn nun der Welshman in dem ihm vorliegenden Morgain la fée den 
Zusatz la fée nicht verstand — und dies miissen wir sicher annehmen, da er 
anderenfalls doch nicht einen Leibarzt Morgan aus dem weiblichen Wesen 
machen konnte — wenn er also la fée in Morgan la fée nicht verstand, dann 
lag es nahe, dass er einen Zusatz zu dem Namen darin sah und um diesen 
Zusatz zu iibersetzen mit seinen mangelhaften Kenntnissen daran herum- 
kliigelte. Sollte es dem Welshman so fern gelegen haben Morgan la fée 
als Morgan la pays zu deuten? Dann war Morgan Tud gegeben.”

262 Morgan Tua 
Foerster cites these words of Zimmer’s in the course of an 
argument intended to show that the Gevazut is a translation of 
Chrétien’s Evec, an admirable proof of which, he says, is fur- 
nished by the evident misunderstanding of Morgain’s name by 
the Welsh author of Geraint 
“ Der Name Morgan Tud kommt ausser in I # nie vor. Wohl aber ist 
eine ganz gewodhnliche Figur aller Artus-Romane Morgue la fée .. . eine 
Schwester Artus’, die Zauberin ist und heilt. Morgue hat im acc. Mor- 
gain oder Morgaint. Es ist daher sehr wahrscheinlich, dass der Name 
Morgan in M (das kleine Wo6rtchen Tud ist in der Absicht des Kelti- 
sierens hinzugefiigt, die Bedeutung desselben wird die eines schmiickenden 
Beiwortes sein) aus dieser Form entstanden ist, indem sie falschlich fiir 
die eigentliche Form des Namens gehalten wurde. Die Akkusativ-Form 
hat keine weibliche Endung, und wir sehen dem entsprechend diese Figur in 
M als mannliche Person auftreten.” * 
The views of Zimmer and Foerster, then, rest primarily on the 
theory that Morgan Tud is an ignorant translation of Morgan 
(Morgain) la fée. But it is important to observe that the pas- 
sage in Chrétien’s Evec from which Foerster gives us to under- 
stand that he believes the Welshman is translating does not 
contain the words Morgan la fée at all. The lines read 
++. un antret 
Que Morgue sa suer avoit fet.* 
The maker of the magic ointment is simply Morgue, the sister 
of Arthur. In an earlier passage in the Evec,> which is not 
represented in the Geraint, mention is made of Morgain la fée, 
who loved Guingomar. If, as Zimmer argues, the name Mor- 
gan Tud is explainable only when we use Morgan la fée as a 
point of departure, we are forced to believe that the Welsh 
author was applying to the personage in question a name not 
found in the passage that he was translating, or that he recog- 
nized in the Morgue sa suer of the lines that he had before him 
the same being as the Morgain la fée, whose name occurs earlier 
in the poem in a passage which, be it said, is not represented 
at all in the Geraint. In both passages in the Erec, Mor- 
gain is essentially and unquestionably feminine; in one she is

Morgan Tud 263 
a mortal’s loved one, in the other a mortal’s sister. Clearly, 
if we accept Zimmer’s view, there is only one course open 
to us: we must give our Welshman credit for understand- 
ing his material well enough to know that Morgain la fée, 
Guingomar’s fairy mistress, was the same person as Morgue, 
Arthur’s sister, but accuse him of not knowing that she was 
a female being —obviously an impossible situation, if the 
Welshman was rational. 
J. Loth,! with whom F. Lot concurs,? offers a more reasonable 
explanation : — 
«Zimmer triomphe de ce que Morgan la fée est remplacée dans le roman 
gallois de Geraint ab Erbin par un homme, Morgan Tut, et conclut a une 
erreur des Gallois provenant de ce que la légende de Morgain leur était 
étrangére. De toutes les traditions galloises, il n’y en a pas eu, au con- 
traire, de plus tenace que les légendes des fées.... S’il ya eu une erreur, 
elle doit venir de l’écrivain frangais. Les fées femmes lui étaient plus fami- 
Tigres que les fées males.... I] aura trouvé dans sa source anglo-normande 
Morgan le Fé ou le Fed et aura tout naturellement lu Morgan /a Fede ou 
la Fér. (V. au mot fed, Godefroy, Dict. anc. frang. Littré, au mot fée, 
rémarque que /é est masculin en normand.) Tel est, en effet, probablement 
le sens de l’épithéte zt dans le récit gallois. Tut doit étre corrigé en Tuth 
ou Tud, et étre rapproché de l’armoricain Zevz, lutin, génie malfaisant ou 
bienfaisant. (Grég. de Rostr., Déct., esprit follet, lutin, teuz, teuziou.) .. . 
On le trouve sous la forme tuth (écrite tuthe avec un e fém, francais) dans 
une vie de saint Maudez, que M. de la Borderie croit composée, non sans 
raison, vers la fin du XIe siécle: il s’agit d’un don qui s’amuse A troubler 
les disciples de Maudet . . . résidant avec leur maitre dans Vile de Gwe/d- 
Enes: ... contigit quadam die, absente magistro suo, quod quidam daemon 
quem Britones 7uthe appellant coram eis apparuit.” 
This explanation also fails to be wholly satisfactory, because 
the meaning of wth as Loth gives it is not altogether appro- 
priate’ to the person of Morgan Tud in the Geraint; and 
furthermore because Loth does not explain what relation the 
Anglo-Norman source which he supposes Chrétien was using 
bore to the Welsh text.

If we leave the Geraint and the Erec for the time being and 
look at the chronicles, we get a little light upon the name 
Morgan Tud.

264 Morgan Tud 
According to a twelfth-century manuscript (Harleian No. 
3859)1 of the Annales Cambriae, the oldest extant Welsh 
annals, which were redacted at the end of the tenth or in 
the early eleventh century,” there is the record for the year 
796 :— Offa rex Merciorum et Morgetiud rex Demetorum morte 
moriuntur. For the year 811, there is a record of Eugem filius 
Margetiud, which in the Welsh Genealogies following the 
Annales Cambriae in the same manuscript? stands as Owein 
map Marget iut;* in the same genealogies the name occurs 
with the spelling Morgetiud: — Regin map Morgetiud; Regin, 
Ludon, Owen, tres filit Morgetiud sunt This Morgetiud (Mar- 
getiud) is the ancient Welsh form, according to Loth, of Mare- 
dudd,® a familiar name evidently, which occurs in the Dream 
of Rhonabwy as that of Madawc’s father,’ and in the later 
manuscripts of the Aznales Cambriae as a variant reading for 
the two records of 796 and 811 cited above ;® in fact in the 
later records of the Aznales it appears as the name of no less 
than seventeen different persons.? From Geoffrey,” Wace,” 
and Lajamon™ we also hear of a Margadud, the son of 
the Ebraucus. (or Ebrac) who built the Castle of Maidens. 
Through the same chroniclers, too, the name is known as that 
of a King of South Wales, who attains a certain prominence 
in the councils of Cadwalla.!* Thus the evidence shows that 
Morgetiud, Margetiut (or -d), Margadud existed as a not 
uncommon early Welsh name ; and it also points to the prob- 
ability that by the time of the composition of the Gevaznt, cer- 
tainly by the time of the transcription of the manuscript that 
we know, it would have an archaic flavor or even be entirely

unfamiliar. It would take but a slight and very ordinary scri- 
bal error to transform this unfamiliar Morgetiud to the Morgan 
Tut, Morgant Tut that appears in the manuscript of Geraint.’ 
The forms of the name given above show that the z is not 
always present, and that the final consonant varies between @ 
and7¢. A scribe need be guilty of no unusual inaccuracy who 
wrote an a for an e, and understood the cross of a ¢ as the 
regular manuscript contraction for 2, placed over the vowel.” 
The recurrence of the error, especially in a text transcribed 
from an earlier manuscript,? is in no way extraordinary. Nor 
is the division of the one unfamiliar name into two words 
a matter for surprise. We detect German sources splitting in 
this way French proper names. In Stricker’s Daniel von dem 
Blihenden Tal one variant for Gengamor is Gegen gamor ;* 
Heinrich von dem Tiirlin in giving the long list of knights 
who drank from the coupe enchantée presses into the service 
the guests whom Chrétien had named among those at Erec’s 
wedding, and renders the Menagormon of Erec (v. 1937), by 
Margue Gormon® In the case of Morgan Tut the division 
might very probably have been influenced by the common 
Welsh name Morgan$ 
Even if the evidence shows satisfactorily that Morgan Tud’s 
name is intelligible as the result of a commonplace scribal 
error operating upon a well-authenticated word, his place in 
tradition remains to be determined. With nothing except 
Geraint before us, we should immediately acknowledge a tradi- 
tion that gave Arthur for a physician one Morgetiud > Morgan 
Tut(Tud). There is nothing against this view in the fact that 
the physician’s name appears only in the Geraint, for it may 
have had a place on scores of pages lost to us. But the question

  266 Morgan Tud 
that we must attempt to answer is whether this physician 
who healed Geraint is quite independent of any connection 
with the fay whose balm was potent in Erec’s case. Four 
facts are unavoidably suggestive of an association in tradition 
between the names Morgetiud and Morgain. (1) Ewaine is the 
son of Morgain ; Owein is the son of Margetiut. (2) Morgain 
is the inhabitant of an Isle of Women; Margedud is the son 
of the founder of the Chastel des Puci¢les (Edinburgh). (3) 
Morgain is the healer of Arthur’s wounds in Avalon; Morgan 
Tud is Arthur’s chief physician. (4) At Arthur's bidding 
a balm of Morgain’s is applied to Erec’s wounds ; at Arthur’s 
summons Morgan Tud and his disciples give their care to 
Geraint. The first two of these parallel traditions indicate 
that a relation is quite as possible between Morgain and 
Morgetiud as between Morgain and Morgan Tud, a probable 
scribal error for Morgetiud. Hence it is obvious that the 
question to be considered really is: What association existed 
between Morgain and the bearer of the original name, Morge- 
tiud, before it was tampered with by a scribe? Since the first 
two of the parallels that I have mentioned are based upon 
statements in the Azuzales Cambriae and Geoffrey, it looks as if 
some confusion between the two names had taken place at 
a comparatively early date. But it should be said that in the 
record in the Annales Cambriae that Owein was the son of 
Margetiut we have two far from uncommon names, and that 
therefore it is a question how great stress should be laid upon 
the fact that its words offer a parallel to the tradition that 
Ewaine was the son of Morgain. Geoffrey is giving a list of the 
numerous children of Ebraucus; from this list it appears that 
Anaor, whose name apparently has a place in romantic tradi- 
tion as that of a fay, was Margadud’s sister, a daughter of the 
founder of the Castle of Maidens. This would seem to indi- 
cate that an other-world connection was not remote from the 
mind of him — whoever he was —who first accomplished the 
task of naming the twenty sons and thirty daughters of Ebrau- 
cus; and accordingly Geoffrey’s words, when placed among the 
parallels dealing with Morgetiud and Morgain, derive some 
weight as additional evidence that a confusion may have arisen 
1 See pp. 21, note 1; 139.  
-P-A-G-E-279
Morgan Tua 267 
before his time. These two examples, however, merely sug- 
gest a possibility that the names Morgetiud and Morgain 
(Morgue) were confused by the eleventh century, and do not in 
any way give proof of such a confusion. 
In the third of the parallel traditions noted above, an impor- 
tant and persistent office of Morgain as Arthur’s healer in 
Avalon, which occupies an early place in the Morgain saga as 
we know it, comes into close contact with the 7é/e of Morgan 
Tud. A possible supposition is that Morgain, the fay of 
Avalon who cared for Arthur’s wounds, was rationalized into 
Arthur’s court physician, and given a name in Welsh resem- 
bling Morgain, that is Morgetiud. But apart from the fact that 
such a rationalization and unsexing are rather violent, there is 
still another objection to this view. Since Worgetiud is an old 
Welsh name the most natural inference is that the country 
where such a rationalization would take place would be Wales, 
and that the time probably would be no later than the first half 
of the twelfth century. Morgan we know was with Bretons 
and Welsh a not uncommon masculine name,! but never, so 
far as we are aware, a feminine, except when it was applied to 
the fay in France.? Hence, if such a rationalization as I have 
1 See Lot, Rom., XXVIII (1899), 323. This is a fact that led more than once 
to a misunderstanding of Morgain’s (Morgan’s) nature. By the masculine form 
of her name the author of A/sscans, as we have seen (p. 51), may have been led 
astray, and the same mistake is made in the English metrical romance, Vwaine 
and Gawin (ed. Ritson, Anc. Eng. Metr. Romances, I, vv. 1755 ff.). In the 
French source (Yvain, v. 2953; cf. above, p. 64) the famous magic balm which 
was to cure Yvain’s madness has been given to its owner by Morgue la sage ; in 
the English source by Morgan the wise: — 
He sayd, this unement is so gode 
That if a man be brayn-wode, 
And he war anes anoynt with yt, 
Smertly sold he have his wit. 
Cf. Li Romans dou Chevalier au Lyon, ed. Holland, Brunswick, 1886, v. 2947, note. 
? Rhfs repeats a tradition of Glasfryn Lake in the parish of Llangybi in Wales, 
that is to the point here. Morgan is a wicked man who lives in the lake, and is 
justly the terror of naughty children, for he carries them off to his pool and keeps 
them there. Rhfs shows that a confusion probably took place in Wales between 
the name Morgen (sea-born), applied to a mermaid, and the masculine Morgan. 
“No sooner, however, had the confusion taken place between Morgen and the 
name which is so common in Wales as exclusively a man’s name, than the aquatic 
figure must also become male. That is why the Glasfryn Morgan is nowa male, 
and not a female like the other characters whose réle he plays.” (Celtic Folklore, 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  268 Morgan ee 
suggested above took place, it is not clear why Morgain’s own 
name, often spelled Morgan, being masculine in form to Welsh 
ears, should have been abandoned when it was ready to tradi- 
tion’s hand, and Morgetiud made to do duty for the occasion. 
The situation in general, however, is explainable if in the 
first place we recognize a story which may have been recorded 
in an early manuscript of the Geraint, namely that Arthur had a 
court physician, Morgetiud. Between his name and office and 
those of Morgain (Morgue), the healer of the king’s wounds, 
there was sufficient resemblance for the two personages to 
become confused, either in the mind of a Welshman who knew 
Morgetiud and heard of an unfamiliar Morgain (Morgue, Morge) 
la fée, or in the mind of a Frenchman who knew Morgain and 
heard of Morgetiud through a Welsh source. 
III 
Thus far then we have seen that there may have existed 
in Welsh tradition one Morgetiud, the king’s physician; and 
that his name and part might easily become confused with 
Morgain’s in either Welsh or French sources. Can we account 
any more definitely for the difference between the Gevaint and 
Erec in the scene of Edeyrn’s (Yder’s) reception at court, 
and in that describing the care administered to the hero’s 
wounds by Arthur’s orders? In other words, the question has 
narrowed itself to the relation between the Gerazut and the 
Erec in the scenes that concern Morgan Tud and Morgue. 
We have learned that the author of the Geraint, whatever else 
he is doing, is certainly not translating his passages concerning 
Morgan Tud from Chrétien’s Evec. Is he introducing his story 
of Morgan Tud because he does not understand his source, or 
is he simply for his own reasons departing from his original, 
introducing here a creation of his imagination and naming the 
hero by a name suggested by Morgue, viz., Morgetiud? In the 
scene of Edeyrn’s healing, the question is easily answered. 
Oxford, 1900, pp. 372-3743 cf. Trans. Hon. Soc. of Cymmrodorion, 1892-1893, 
pp- 16,17.) Although this is a modern example it illustrates a situation similar 
to that which it is not unreasonable to suppose existed even before the twelfth 
century in Wales, where doubtless the name Morgan in itself suggested a male 
being to a Welshman.

Morgan Tud 269 
In Evec we are told that Yder’s dwarf has insulted one of Guinevere’s 
maidens. Erec has gone in pursuit of him, has vanquished him in combat, 
and has sent him to Guinevere as her prisoner. At Guinevere’s request, 
Arthur postpones a certain festival at court until Erec shall return. Yder 
arrives duly at Caradigan. 
“Ses haubers est coverz de sanc; 
e De roge i a plus que del blanc.” 
“Ses haubers est ansanglantez, 
Mout est hurtez et debatuz; 
Bien i pert qu’il s’est conbatuz. 
Savoir poons sanz nule faille, 
Que fiere a esté la bataille.”1 
But we hear nothing further about his wounds. He is brought before 
Arthur and Guinevere, greets them, surrenders himself to the queen, and 
tells her his story, adding that Erec will come to court the next day. The 
queen at once calls the king’s attention to the fact that she gave him excel- 
lent advice the day before, when she counselled him to await Erec’s presence 
at the feast. 
‘Por ce fet il buen consoil prandre.’2 
The king admits that she is right : 
“Mes se de rien nule m’avez, 
Cest chevalier quite clamez 
De sa prison par tel covant 
Que il soit des or an avant 
De ma mesniee et de ma cort; 
Et s’il nel fet, a mal li tort.” 
Li rois ot sa parole dite, 
Et la reine claimme quite 
Le chevalier tot maintenant; 
Mes ce fu par tel covenant 
Qu’a la cort del tot remassist. 
Cil gueires proiier ne san fist : 
La remenance a otroiiee ; 
Puis fu de cort et de mesniee — 
N’an avoit pas devant esté. 
Lors furent vaslet apresté, 
Qui le corurent desarmer.® 
In the Geraint under the same circumstances Edeyrn comes to court. 
“ Miserable and broken is the armor that he wears, and the hue of blood is 
more conspicuous upon it than its own color.” Guenhwyvar hears of his 
arrival, and goes to the gate to meet and admit him. He yields himself to 
her, tells the tale of his encounter with Geraint, and announces that Geraint 
will come on the morrow. “Then Arthur came to him and he saluted

Arthur; and Arthur gazed a long time upon him and was amazed to see 
him thus. And thinking that he knew him, he inquired of him, ‘ Art thou 
Edeyrn, the son of Nudd?’ ‘I am, Lord,’ said he, ‘and I have met with 
much trouble, and received wounds unsupportable.’ Then he told Arthur 
all his adventure. ‘Well,’ said Arthur, ‘from what I hear it behooves 
Gwenhwyvar to be merciful towards thee.’ ‘The mercy which thou desir- 
est, Lord,’ said she, ‘will I grant to him, since it is as insulting to thee that 
an insult should be offered to me as to thyself.’ ‘ Thus will it be best to do,’ 
said Arthur; ‘let this man have medical care until it bé known whether he 
may live. And if he live, he shall do such satisfaction as shall be judged 
best by the men of the court; and take thou sureties to that effect. And if 
he die, too much will be the death of such a youth as Edeyrn for an insult 
to a maiden.’ ‘This pleases me,’ said Gwenhwyvar.” Then follows a list 
of the sureties and the scene with Morgan Tud quoted at the beginning of 
this chapter. Edeyrn’s part in the story ends when he is consigned to 
Morgan Tud’s care. 
There are two marked differences in these two accounts, one 
* that of national characteristic, which gives us less courtly cere- 
mony in the Geraint than in the Zvec, and the other the pres- 
ence of Morgan Tud. If the Geraznt is based on the Zrec, the 
author is following in his version of Edeyrn’s arrival at court 
one of two methods: he may be introducing into his story 
a bit of ornamental description based upon the incident of 
Geraint’s healing that he intended to use later, and attaching it 
to Morgetiud, a figure, be it remembered, created in the second 
instance out of the mention of Morgain’s balm, — which is 
plainly a very complicated and unnatural process ; or, what is 
more probable, he may be following an independent old Welsh 
story about one Morgetiud, Arthur’s physician. If this be 
true in the case of Edeyrn, why should it not also be true 
in the healing of Geraint? The existence of such a tradition 
would explain certain difficulties in the scene where Geraint is 
healed. The passages cited at the beginning of this chapter 
show the wide variation here between the Geraint and the Ervec 
in story. If the author of the Geraint is misunderstanding his 
original, he is misunderstanding it at the very point where we 
have a right to feel assured that he would have understood it. 
To a Welsh narrator a fay with her healing balsam was a 
common figure in story,! and it is difficult to believe that by 
an error he would have discarded the fay and substituted

Morgan Tud 7 
so entirely different a figure and story. The second question 
is answered by the fact, that it is improbable if the author 
' were fabricating Morgetiud after 1168, the approximate date of 
Erec, he would have given him an ancient form of the name ; 
for apparently by the middle of the twelfth century Morgetiud 
was not in vogue, but had been supplanted by Maredudd. 
It is surely reasonable to suppose in view of all the above 
considerations that there figured in old Welsh tradition a per- 
sonage called Morgetiud, the king’s leech, who was able to 
heal whatever wounded knights came to Arthur’s court. As 
Zimmer shows by example,” the chief physician was a person 
of distinct importance in Welsh court life as early as the tenth 
century, and was as prominent as the bard among court offi- 
cers. Hence in taking the story of Geraint at its word, and in 
accepting a tradition that gave Arthur a great physician Mor- 
gan Tud < Morgetiud, we are only recognizing in the narrative 
what we know was a prevalent custom. 
Supposing this be true, what shall we think of Chrétien’s 
story? If the Welsh version is not derived from the French, 
is the obverse of the situation plausible, and may we explain 
Chrétien’s introduction of Morgue as the outcome of what he 
found in a source derived from a Welsh version of the Geraint 
story? 
Tradition shows that the healing balm that Morgain gave the 
king in Avalon is conspicuous in the earliest versions of the 
Avalon story. Both in the Vita Merlini? and in Lazamon 
the medicamen prescribed by the fay has a place.‘ Hence the 
antret given to the king by Morgain, according to Chrétien, is 
doubtless that which she gave him originally in Avalon, but 
which tradition, establishing her at court as the king’s sister,

? Erec, p. xxviii, note; cf. Mabinogion, II, 164. The king’s physician is an 
important person in Celtic literature at least as early as the tenth century. For 
an account of Fingen, King Conochar’s remarkable physician, see the tale known 
as the Tragical Death of King Conochar, which should probably be placed earlier 
than the tenth century, translated in Cuchullin Saga, pp. 270 (cf. 266), 215 (cf. 190).

    272 Morgan Tua 
has brought to earth along with the fay herself. Chrétien uses 
it again in the Yvazn where he represents Morgain’s magic 
ointment as effecting an immediate cure of Yvain’s madness.! 
If then Chrétien had before him a healing scene based upon 
that which we know in the Geraint, in which Morgetiud, the 
king’s physician, displayed his skill, it would be a short step 
for him, led by the name or misunderstanding it, to fit to 
the story a traditional part of Morgain. This will appear all 
the more natural for him, when we recall to mind that any 
mediaeval maiden was as a matter of course skilled in the use 
of medicinal herbs; Nicolette displayed no unparalleled art 
when she cured Aucassin’s hurt, and not infrequently in the 
French romances a knight or lord is said to have in his house- 
hold a sister conveniently gifted with peculiar skill in surgery, 
whose services he enlists in behalf of a wounded comrade.” 
We have seen above the possibility that a confusion in tradition 
between Morgetiud and Morgain existed before Chrétien’s 
time. With these confused traditions he might have been 
acquainted, and by them have been assisted in the rendering 
that he gave the healing scene of his ultimate Welsh source. 
Hence, if the responsibility of a misunderstanding or a deliber- 
ate alteration of his source is to be laid on Chrétien’s shoulders, 
we see that he had ample excuse for either. 
When we turn to the text of the Zvec we find that such a 
supposition explains the differences between the vec and the 
Geraint more readily’than its opposite explains them. Chrétien 
is simply omitting from his source the healing of Yder. We

is found in Arthur’s possession in Spenser, Faerie Queene, Bk. I, Canto ix, 19: —

Embowd with gold and gorgeous ornament, 
Wherein were closd few drops of liquor pure,

women as skilled in the healing art; see Zyolet, vv. 557-574; Raoul, Messire

    Morgan Tud 273 
wonder why we hear nothing more of the knight’s profusely 
bleeding wounds, but when we look at the Geraint and find 
the description of the care given the wounded Edeyrn, we 
understand that Chrétien, having put his knight through the 
necessary adventure and sent him to Arthur’s court, at that 
point preferred to condense his narrative. Geraint stays for a 
month at Arthur’s tent for healing, Erec’s cure is of course 
effected immediately by the fairy balm; hence Chrétien natu- 
rally shortens his hero’s stay at Arthur’s court, and sends him 
forth more speedily to fresh adventures. 
IV 
In the course of our investigations we have seen, in the first 
place, a probability that Morgan Tud may be the result of a 
scribal error for an ancient Welsh name, Morgetiud, and further- 
more that in Welsh story before the twelfth century a certain 
Morgetiud may have been represented as Arthur’s chief physi- 
cian; that therefore, granting these probabilities, the author of 
Geraint, so far as his reference to Morgan Tud is concerned, 
need never have heard of Chrétien. In the next place we have 
found that the names Morgetiud and Morgain appear here and 
there in parallel traditions, Morgetiud in Celtic sources and in 
Geoffrey of Monmouth, Morgain in French material. It has 
also been evident that Morgain’s 7é/e as Arthur’s healer would 
readily coalesce in story with that of Morgetiud, Arthur’s chief 
physician, and her name, especially in the form Morgue (Morge), 
easily be confused with his; but that since Morgetiud is an 
ancient name, such a confusion between the two personages 
would probably antedate the twelfth century at latest. Possibly 
as a result of this misunderstanding Morgetiud is suitably made 
a denizen of the Castle of Maidens, and Morgain, Ewain’s fairy 
mother, may have become Margetiud, Owein’s father. Thence 
also, as we saw, is possible a confusion in episodes of healing, 
rendered all the simpler after Morgain was known as the sister 
of the king, dwelling at court, skilled in surgery. Thence, too, 
may be derived the misunderstanding or deliberate alteration 
seen in the Zvec and the Gerainé, and the consequent problem 
as to the interrelation of the two sources, —a difficulty that it 
   
-P-A-G-E-286
274 Morgan Tud 
appears satisfactory to explain by assuming that Chrétien’s 
source was based upon an early version of the Geraint story, 
from which he diverged, owing it may be to a confusion, 
perhaps already existing, between Morgetiud and Morgain 
(Morgue), or to an association of ideas suggested to him by 
the similarity in the names of the two personages, their skill 
in the healing art, and their relations to Arthur. 
At all events the grave and mysterious Morgan Tud has no 
certain information to give us about Morgain la fée. He 
stands as a notable example of what a stroke of the pen may 
effect. With his disciples and his simples we may leave him, 
feeling sure that his name should not serve as an unquestion- 
able support for the belief that Chrétien relied on a written 
Anglo-Norman source for his material, or that the author of 
Geraint was threading the mazes through which Zimmer and 
Foerster would follow him as a translator of Chrétien’s Evec.!

EXCURSUS IV 
THE DIANA MYTH AND FAIRY TRADITION 
CerTAIn features in the Diana myth are, as I have said above, 
paralleled in mediaeval fairy lore. 
1. By the sanctuary of Diana in the grove of Aricia on the 
shore of Lake Nemi, there grew a certain tree, of which only 
a runaway slave was permitted to attempt to break off a bough. 
If he were successful, he had to fight in hand to hand conflict 
with the priest of the goddess, and if he were victor in the 
encounter, he was compelled, as vex nemorensis, himself to 
defend the sanctuary against the next comer.!_ The cult of the 
Arician Diana was a peculiarly wide-spread and persistent 
Italic cult, and is said to have flourished as late as the second 
century of our era.2_ So great was the reputation of the grove 
and lake that the goddess became known as dea nemorensis, 
and that no unusual popular name for a lake was speculum 
Dianae. Hence during the period of Roman colonization 
in the provinces the Arician Diana was a widely recognized 
and powerful divinity. The parallel between the Arician cult 
and the “custom” of a fay’s castle is close. The story of the 
mysterious bough and the priest who awaits his slayer by 
the Arician lake, whatever the original significance may have 
been, would, if it were translated into mediaeval thought, 
necessarily become the adventure of a knight, who, after per- 
forming some special deed of valor for which he was destined, 
had to fight with the defender of a magic castle and if victo- 
rious take his place ;* and the goddess whose shrine the vex 
nemorensis guarded would become the fairy mistress of the 
castle.

276 The Diana Myth and Fairy Tradition 
2. At Nemi Diana was specially worshiped by women in 
her capacity as Genitalis or Lucina, and therefore to a certain 
extent she shares with Juno Lucina and the Parcae the care 
over a child’s birth. In the Vulgate Merlin, as the giver of a 
“destiny” to a child, she plays practically the same 7é/e as 
the earlier Parcae and the later fays.! 
3. Again, the story of Diana, who, in anger at Oeneus 
because he had passed her by when he was sacrificing to the 
other gods, sent the Calydonian boar to ravage his land, offers 
a distinct parallel to the common story of the fay who, angry 
at some real or fancied slight, directs a sign of her displeasure 
against the offender.” 
4. Finally, according to one form of the Endymion myth, 
Luna and not Zeus imposes upon the fair youth his endless 
sleep in the cave on Mount Latmos. “Luna... a qua [Endy- 
mion] consopitus putatur ut eum dormientem oscularetur.” ’ 
Thus, again and again, we have seen the mortal whom a Celtic 
fay would win to her control overcome by magic drowsiness. 
There is abundant evidence that Diana.made her way into 
northern Europe, and that her cult persisted through the 
middle ages. In the end of the second century of our era, 
according to a votive tablet dedicated to Diana Abnobae, she 
was regarded as the divinity of the mountain Abnoba in north- 
ern Germany;* and another inscription, which is of more 
interest here, indicates that she was identified with the tutelary 
divinity of the Ardennes. In the second half of the sixth 
century, Gregory of Tours found at Tréves an established cult 
of Diana which he endeavored to destroy.* She is mentioned 
among the heathen deities whom none may dare invoke, in 
a sermon of Saint Eligius,’ who lived during the middle of the 
seventh century. In the Life of Saint Kilian, a missionary 
among the Franks in the seventh century, it is related that

The Diana Myth and Fairy Tradition ayy 
Gozbertus, a Frankish leader, inquired of the saint which was 
preferable —the worship of the God whom he preached, or 
that of Diana : — “ Diana namque apud illum in summa venera- 
tione habebatur.””! Whether the Diana mentioned in all these 
references is the true Roman Diana, or whether simply her 
name is attached to a northern divinity offering a more or 
less striking analogy in attributes with her own,” the passages 
indicate that the popular mind had formed some conception of 
the prominent characteristics of the goddess. The testimony 
of Ordericus Vitalis, who lived in the end of the tenth and 
beginning of the eleventh centuries, is more important here. 
He relates the experiences of one Taurinus, the son of the Bishop 
of Paris, at Evreux in the year 1080. Taurinus entered the 
temple of Diana and called forth a horrible monster, a species 
of demon, Zabulon by name, greatly feared by the people. An 
angel opportunely descended from heaven, and led away Zabu- 
lon, whereupon Taurinus purified the temple and consecrated 
it to the Blessed Virgin.® 
From her attributes as huntress and moon-goddess, Diana 
long survived as the leader of the Wild Hunt. From Burchard 
of Worms‘ down to Johannes Herolt, a Dominican monk 
of the fifteenth century,® we have evidence of her obnoxious 
influence in this capacity.6 She was also to be dreaded as the 
mid-day demon’ according to the belief of the Haedui, as it is 
recorded in a passage from the Acta Symphoriani : —«Dianam 
quoque daemonium esse meridianum sanctorum industria inve- 
stigavit : quae per compita currens et silvarum secreta per- 
lustrans . .. Triviae sibi cognomen, dum triviis insidiatur, 
obtinuit.”® It should be noted that the sirens appear in

Greek mythology as mid-day demons,! and that in German 
folk lore the mid-day demon is sometimes a maiden of the 
springs, who sits by the water combing her golden hair.” 
Diana’s appearance in the Merlin (1528) as a divinity of the sea 
indicates that she was still associated with the water,® and 
furthermore we have the statement that her mother was a 
siren. The Lac de Diane and the Forét de Diane* furnish 
us with evidence that her name survived in popular usage. 
There are perhaps few better illustrations of the mediaeval 
development of the Diana myth than that found in the descrip- 
tions given by Geoffrey of Monmouth,® Wace,* and La3zamon,? 
of the prophecy of Diana to Brutus at Leogecia. Brutus found 
there, Geoffrey says, a temple of Diana, where a statue of the 
goddess gave replies to the petitions of suppliants such as he. 
Geoffrey’s account is practically untinged by mediaevalism. 
The vision of the Penates that came to Aeneas is evidently his 
model, and he is not departing far from classical ideas. Diana 
here is the Diana that we meet in Horace, 
Montium custos nemorumque virgo 
Diva triformis. 
Wace, however, allows current mediaeval notions to cluster 
about his source, and he recognizes in Diana une devineresse, 
Diables ert. Around this nucleus Laj3amon groups a still 
further developed tradition of Diana, the ‘enchantress, skilled 
in evil arts. | 
There is undeniable evidence, then, that Diana remained in 
mediaeval popular belief endowed with attributes that are in 
lineal descent from those of her primitive character. Through- 
out the middle ages she is connected with the streams and 
century, to a man who was the victim of an infirmity attributed to the stripes and 
scourgings of a daemon guod rustici Dianam appellant.

forests. She is associated with the moonlight huntress, the 
mid-day demon, the fates who guard a child’s birth, and the 
sirens; a story is told of her in which she is depicted as 
the beguiling yet fickle mistress of mortals whom she lures 
from their homes. In other words, she survived as a person- 
ality about whom stories clustered, and many of her permanent 
and persistent attributes are paralleled in the fays of northern 
Europe.! 
In Froissart’s romance Meliador® nymphs of Diana and fays 
are distinctly identified. 
The young knight Saigremor, on his way through the forest of Archi- 
nai, the abode of fays, is led a useless chase by a white stag that darts into 
his path from a thicket. At length the stag comes to him, and seems to 
invite him to mount. No sooner has the young knight sprung upon its 
back, than it bears him away to a lake into which it plunges. [Here a leaf 
of the manuscript is lacking.] Saigremor sleeps, dreaming of his love. 
When he wakes he is in the presence of three beautiful ladies, to whom he 
has to give an account of his presence. They take counsel together con- 
cerning him, 
Car d’elles fu pris et ravis 
Et moult doucement portés ent. 
Et saciés que ces dames trois 
Estoient nimphes et pucelles 
A Dyane et ses damoiselles, 
Qui ravirent le chevalier. 
Here the story ends, but with the picture of the stag-messenger 
before us, the apparently magic sleep, the beautiful ladies who 
have brought the fair knight to their land, we do not need the 
assurance given us a few hundred verses later that Saigremor 
was taken captive by fays,* and that the nymphs of Diana are 
maidens of the Celtic other world.

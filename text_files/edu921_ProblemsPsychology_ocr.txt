EXPLANATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT 
The use of problems in the teaching of a science is not at 
; all new. Although this may be the first attempt to collect and 
formulate a large number of psychological problems, teachers 
of psychology have always used illustrations of particular 
forms of behavior to explain their subject matter and to make 
it more concrete. The compiler has, after a careful trial, 
found it so convenient to have the illustrations assembled as 
in this book that he has been led to feel that others too would 
find this collection useful. 
The nature of these problems is such that they may be used 
with any standard text book. Care has been taken that no 
single point of view shall dominate. The conventional list 
of questions has not been included, because of the existence 
of a book of questions in psychology by Whipple. The order 
of the sections, while not arbitrary, does not represent in any 
sense an ideal of continuity of topics. Any one section, there- 
fore, can be used independently of all the others, according 
to the arrangement of the chapters of the text book used in 
class; and the problems of any section can be assigned at any 
time, irrespective of their order in the section. Proper names 
and colloquial speech are frequently employed in the problems 
for greater concreteness and stronger appeal to students’ ex- 
periences; at times, also, unusual situations are used for ob- 
vious pedagogical reasons. 
I take pleasure in acknowledging the help that I have re- 
ceived from the many writers on psychology. To enumerate 
all would be impossible, as some of the sources date back to 
my earliest education in the field, but they are evident to any

DEFINITIONS, PROBLEMS AND METHODS 
OF PSYCHOLOGY 
1. “To reach a clear understanding as to the true meaning 
of psychology is a more difficult task than the solution of any 
special psychological problem” (Miinsterberg). Explain. 
2, An experiment is an observation that can be repeated, 
isolated, and varied. Illustrate, 
Explain and criticize the following definitions of Psy- 
CHOLOGY: 
. It is the science of the soul. 
. It is the science of mind. 
. It is the science of consciousness. 
. It is the science of mental life. 
. It is the science of behavior. 
. It is the science of thinking, feeling, and acting. 
9. It is the science of the faculties of thinking, feeling, and 
acting. 
xo. “ Psychology is the science which deals with the mutual 
interrelation between an organism and its environment” 
(Warren).

2 PROBLEMS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
Explain and differentiate the different methods of psychology 
shown in the following examples and statements (11 to 16} 
inclusive): | 
1x. This theory XYZ is the product of a reflective, non- | 
experimental psychology, having no introspective guarantee | 
of its (the XYZ theory’s) adequacy. 
12. Look, for an instant, at this red paper, and then turn | 
your eyes from it upon a gray wall, and observe what color 
will appear. 
13. John wanted to know how quickly he could memorize 
a number of words while walking to and fro in his room, 
and how long it would take him to memorize a like number 
of words while sitting down. 
14. “When many different species of animals are compared 
in intelligence and also in brain weight, the two are found 
to correspond fairly well, the more intelligent species having 
on the whole the heavier brain, from which we fairly conclude 
that the size of the brain has something to do with intelli- 
gence” (Woodworth). 
15. Fred was a good student of German. One day he 
wanted to find out the origin of the German word Herr. In 
doing so, he became interested in the origin of language in the 
human species. Therefore he turned to study one of the 
special fields of psychology. 
16. Helen wanted to know what would take place if part of 
the brain were removed from her dog. Then as she was 
browsing about in the library she found a book which pointed 
out some of the correlations between brain disease and loss 
of mental power.

  SECTION II 
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ITS RELATION 
TO BEHAVIOR 
1. Explain the nature and function of the terms used in the 
following quotation from Breese: ‘The nerve-cell is com- 
| posed of a protoplasmic cell-body and its prolongations of 
fibers. These prolongations are of two kinds: axones and 
dendrites.” 
2. Explain the basis for the following classification of terms: 
Neurones may be classified according to their function into 
(1) Sensory or afferent neurones, 
(3) Motor or efferent neurones, and 
(3) Associational or central neurones. 
3. Explain the nature and function of the terms used in the 
following quotation from Breese: “The brain is connected 
through nerve-fibres with all parts of the body. Some of these 
fibres come from the sense end-organs which are played upon 
by the external forces in the environment, and some of them 
go out to the muscles which bring about adaptive movements 
of the body.” 
4. Explain the basis for the following classifications of areas 
of localization in the brain. Assign a function to each term 
used in the classification. The brain consists of the higher 
centers and the lower centers. There are the following areas 
of localization in the brain, (1) area of general sensation, (2) 
auditory area, (3) visual area, (4) olfactory area, (5) gusta- 
tory area, (6) motor area, (7) association areas, (8) motor 
speech center, (9) sensory speech center, (10) visual center 
for written language.

5. Explain the nature and function of the terms used in the 
following quotation from Breese: “ Besides the cerebrospinal 
nervous system there is another relatively independent nervous 
system known as the autonomic nervous system.” 
6. Justify the content of the following quotation from Pills- 
bury: “If behavior or consciousness is affected, some change 
in the nervous system is usually found.” 
7. Illustrate the following with examples taken from your 
own experience: “ Mental life is in some ways more immedi- 
ately connected with the motivity of the central system, but 
it is also related to the autonomic system in many important 
particulars” (Angell). 
Explain in neural terms and diagram problems 8 to 16 
inclusive. 
8. A cinder in the eye will cause a flow of tears. 
9. A cold will cause coughing. 
10. Pepper will cause sneezing. 
zz. Onion will cause the eyes to water and burn. 
12. The hand, if it is burned, will be jerked back. 
13. “ Writing on dictation ordinarily disappears with speech 
in the sensory forms of aphasia” (Pillsbury). 
14. I was fixing the knives of our cutting machine, when, 
just as I put my hand into the cylinder containing the knives, 
I noticed that there was a snake in that very cylinder. But 
you know I could not even jerk my hand out of that place, 
because I should have cut it. 
15. An amoeba will always entirely surround food, but it 
will move away from any stimulus that might in any way 
injure the cell. 
16. When Helen retires to her room for the night, she turns 
on the light. Frances, who is asleep in the same room, turns 
her face away from the light. 
17. If you should surgically destroy the brain of a dog, he 
would nevertheless violently scratch his back if that part were 
stimulated with acid. Why? Explain in neural terms.

men would become blind, but their memory of visual objects 
would not be impaired? Justify your answer in neural terms, 
19. George stepped on a nail barefooted. As he did so, he 
jerked his foot up and then cried out because of the pain.

« the consequences due to the injury of the two men as narrated 
\ below: In the last street fight one man-—his name was 
' Francis, I think —received a rather slight injury to one 
: part of his head, and as a result was unconscious for three 
| hours, while another man—his name I cannot recall, but 
/it does not matter — received the same type of injury as 
; Francis did, but it caused a paralysis of a small group of 
i muscles and the loss of one, or it may have been two, of his 
| Senses. 
i 21. Justify in neural terms the following experience with 
, 2 turtle: After the hemispheres of the turtle were removed, 
: it could still swim and avoid collision with objects. 
22. John’s right side became paralyzed as a result of an 
| i } ‘ 
automobile accident. When in the hospital he again and again 
asserted that the doctor must be wrong in what he said about 
the injury, because he (John) could feel his right leg move 
and could also move his right eye outwards. What was respon- 
sible for John’s experience? 
23. Point out in neural terms the relationship of the pres- 
. sure on the soldier’s brain and his continued talking as illus- 
; trated by the following experience: During the war, a soldier é 
; 
_ received a bad head wound. In the operating room his brain 
  ' was exposed. All at once the soldier began to talk and con- 
; tinued until it was discovered that part of the skull was resting 
on the soldier’s brain. When the pressure was removed the 
: patient instantly stopped talking.

the following statement: My sister’s boy placed a dro| 
acid upon the foot of a frog, to see the frog draw its foo: 
Then he fastened the left foot of the frog and again plac._

the acid upon the fastened foot. Then the boy got ho 
right foot, whereupon the frog contracted the muscl: 
forelegs and of his trunk. 
26. Professor James of the Zoology Department ha: 
strated to his class in General Zoology that when Pltsoue ay 
applied to certain parts of a frog’s body the frog w’”

REACTIONS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS 
«1. Criticize the following description of a reflex arc: “A 
: reflex arc begins in a sense organ; it extends along a sensory 
} axon (really along a team of axons acting side by side) to its 
_ end-brush in a lower center, where it crosses a synapse and 
enters the dendrites of a motor neurone and so reaches the 
i cell body and axon of this neurone, which last extends out to 
: s the muscle (or gland) ” (Woodworth). 
2. Criticize the following quotation from Woodworth: 
“ Every reflex has its own team of motor neurones, harnessed 
i together by its outfit of sensory and central neurones.”

: coordinated, representing team work on the part of the muscles 
as distinguished from indiscriminate mass action. That means 
selective distribution of the nerve current” (Woodworth).

Instincts or InsTINctIVe TENDENCIES TO ACTION 
18. Instinct is “compound reflex action” (Spencer). 
Criticize. 
Explain and criticize the quotations numbered 19 to 26 
inclusive. 
19. “We may... define an instinct as an inherited or 
innate psycho-physical disposition which determines its pos- 
sessor to perceive, and to pay attention to, objects of a certain 
class, to experience an excitement of a particular quality upon 
perceiving such an object, and to act in regard to it in a 
particular manner, or, at least, to experience an impulse to 
such action” (McDougall). 
20. “ The innate psycho-physical disposition, which is an 
instinct, may be regarded as consisting of three corresponding 
parts, an afferent, a central, and a motor or efferent part, 
whose activities are the cognitive, the affective, and the con- 
ative features respectively of the total instinctive process ” 
(McDougall). 
21. “Instinct is the activity of a team of neurones so 
organized, and so connected with muscles and sense organs, 
as to arouse certain motor reactions in response to certain 
sensory stimuli’ (Woodworth). 
22. Instinct is an “inherited reaction of the sensori-motor 
type, relatively complex and markedly adaptive in character,
-P-A-G-E-54
48 PROBLEMS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
and common to a group of individuals” (Baldwin’s 
Dictionary). 
23. “ In instinct the action is explicit and capable of being 
observed without instrumentation” (Watson). 
24. “We should define émstinct as an hereditary pattern 
reaction, the separate elements of which are movements prin- 
cipally of the striped muscles ” (Watson). 
25. “Instinct may not be inappropriately defined as the 
Will of Nature expressing itself through us” (Yerkes). 
26. “The final mode of activity is not along the line of any 
single instinct, but is a compromise in which one instinct is 
modified by conflict with other instinctive tendencies ” (Judd). 
27. Comment upon the following quotation from Thorn- 
dike: ‘“ When the tendency concerns a very definite and uni- 
form response to a very simple sensory situation, and when 
the connection between the situation and the response is very 
hard to modify and also very strong so that it is almost in- 
evitable, the connection or response to: which it leads is called 
a reflex. Thus a knee-jerk is a very definite and uniform 
response to the simple sense stimulus of sudden hard pressure 
against a certain spot. It is hard to lessen, to increase, or 
otherwise control the movement, and, given the situation, the 
response almost always comes. When the response is more 
indefinite, the situation more complex, and the connection more 
modifiable, instinct becomes the customary term.” 
28. Give two examples of the type of instinct described in 
the following: “A dog has been taught to beg for food. One 
of her pups goes through the begging movement without 
having had an opportunity to see its mother make the move- 
ment” (Pillsbury), Is this an instinct? Could it have been 
developed by training the mother? 
29. “The whole process of development of instinct is due 
to the development of the physical structures upon which 
these responses depend ” (Pillsbury). Justify.

63. “ There was in operation for some years at the leper 
colony off the Philippine Islands a system of weekly gratuities 
to each man, woman, and child confined in the colony. From 
‘the women and children no accounting for this subsidy was 
required. But from the men a certain amount of manual 
labor about the island was exacted upon penalty of having 
the pocket money withheld. From the administrative point 
of view this had seemed an easy solution for the difficult prob- 
lem of getting adequate labor in an isolated place inhabited 
largely by the victims of a dread disease. But the men patients 
took vigorous exception to this form of compulsory labor and 
finally made complaint about it to the Philippine government. 
An investigation into the unrest at the leper colony was insti- 
tuted and the Secretary of the Interior visited the island and 
heard all the complaints in person. As a result of his study 
the system for gratuities for men was wiped out. And _ the 
necessary work on the island was paid for at an agreed rate 
which, it appeared later, was less than the previous gratuity. 
Nevertheless, the men found the new system preferable; there 
was no more complaint; the necessary work was done; the 
men who were inclined to work received the weekly stipends 
and the others did not. But from that day to the present, 
trouble on this score has been unheard of ” (Tead).

(McDougall). 
4. “ An emotion is a ‘ moved’ or stirred-up state of mind. 
Or, since almost any such state of mind includes also elements 
that are cognitive, like recognition of present objects or 
memories of the past, we might better speak of emotion as the

collision in which I was concerned; next to the stranger with 
whom I had collided, and of the stranger’s business address

were the words: Plato, State, 48, Colony, Philosophy, Harding, 
Statue, Germany, Paper, Venus, Wilson, 13, Greek, Europe, 
Write, Ohio, Pencil, Kant, War, England. Mr. Shaw learned 
the words in a little more than half the time it took Mr. Wales 
to learn them. Mr. Shaw said that he learned the words in 
the following relation: Paper — Write— Pencil — Venus — 
Statue — Greek — Plato — Philosophy — Kant — Germany

24. Discuss the principle involved in this experience, and 
point out its application: Somerville remembered all the dates 
of American History and could tell any date without effort. 
I asked him to tell me how he remembers them all. I knew 
that the memory of dates is of no importance, but I was inter- 
ested in the general subject of memory; so I asked. He said 
that he has consciously connected all of the dates in three 
independent ways: one, by relating the dates to the nature of 
the events during the different periods of history; a second, by 
linking them with the developments in the history of science; 
and the third, by associating them with Roman numerals. 
I myself have in a similar way connected the dates of American 
History with the different lengths of a yard stick, but I cannot 
Tecall the dates as well as Somerville can. 
25. Fred remembered the principle of the lever, in connec- 
tion with a hammer, a long iron rod, and a board. When his 
friend asked him to tell him about this principle and its appli- 
cations, Fred could not do it at that moment. Why?

28. Comment on the following quotation from James: “A 
young woman of four or five and twenty, who could neither 
tead nor write, was seized with a nervous fever, during which, 
according to the assertions of all the priests and monks of 
the neighborhood, she became possessed, and, as it appeared, 
by a very learned devil. She continued incessantly talking 
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, in very pompous tones and with 
most distinct enunciation. This possession was rendered more 
probable by the known fact that she was or had been a heretic. 
. [The young woman] had been charitably taken by an 
old Protestant pastor at nine years old, and had remained 
with him some years, even till the old man’s death. .. . It 
had been the old [pastor’ ’s] . . . custom, for years, to walk 
up and down a passage of his house into which the kitchen 
door opened, and to read to himself with a loud voice, out of 
his favorite books. . . .” 
29. Discuss the principle involved in this quotation from 
Woodworth: “There is a famous incident that occurred in a 
Swiss psychological laboratory when a foreign student was 
supposed to be memorizing a list of nonsense syllables. After 
the list had been passed before him many times without his 
giving the expected signal that he was ready to recite, the 
experimenter remarked that he seemed to be having trouble 
in memorizing the syllables. ‘Oh, I didn’t understand that 
I was to learn them,’ he said, and it was found that, in fact, 
he had made almost no progress towards learning the list.” 
30. “A typist who spent perhaps two hundred hours in 
drill, and then dropped typewriting for a year, recovered 
the lost ground in less than an hour of fresh practice.” How 
long would you judge it would take a typist who has drilled 
fifty hours, to regain her lost skill after dropping the type- 
writer for a year? Reasons (Woodworth).

was this advertising man’s offence serious enough to lead to 
his discharge? 
33. Write down all of the advertising slogans you read in 
a magazine. Then look through the magazine again, compar-

that serve to give them light in the absence of the sun, as our 
moon does to us. They are all in their motions subject to

alittle clearing by the side of a brook. Then they started 
for home, striking straight through the woods, as they thought, 
in the direction of home. After quite a long tramp, when 
they thought they should be almost out of the woods, they saw 
a clear space ahead, and pushing forward eagerly, found 
themselves in the same little clearing where they had eaten 
their lunch. Reasoning process No. 1 now occurred; one of 
the boys recalled that when traversing the woods without a 
compass or any landmark, the traveler is very likely to go in 
acircle: inference, ‘ That is what we have done and we prob- 
ably shall do the same thing again if we go ahead. We may 
as well sit down and think it over’ . . . Mental exploration 
ensued. ‘How about following the brook?’ ‘That won’t 
do for it flows down into a big swamp that we couldn’t get 
through.” ‘How about telling direction by the sun?’ ‘ But 
ithas so clouded over that you can’t tell east from west, or 
torth from south.’ ‘Yes, those old clouds. How fast they 
are going! They seem to go straight enough.’ ‘Well, say! 
How about following the clouds? If we keep on going straight, 
in any direction, for a couple of hours, we shall surely get 
out of the woods somewhere.’ This seems worth trying and 
actually brings the boys out to a road where they can inquire 
the way home ” (Woodworth).

WILL AND ACTION 
1. Explain and criticize the following quotation from 
McDougall: “ We may . . . define volition as the supporting 
or re-enforcing of a desire or conation by the co-operation of 
an impulse excited within the system of the self-regarding 
sentiment.” 
2. Comment on the following quotation from McDougall: 
“They recognize will as a fundamental faculty co-ordinate 
with conation. They recognize that in all.organisms (animals 
and men alike), this faculty of striving is directed either 
vaguely or with more or less of precision towards certain kinds 
of action which tend to secure specific ends; that when these 
conative tendencies are brought into play in relative isolation, 
sporadic impulse, desire, or action is the result; and they 
recognize that moral volition and moral conduct depend upon 
the systematic organization of such tendencies; that, in short, 
moral volition expresses character or is character in action. 
Their doctrines, then, imply the thesis here maintained; 
namely, that in order to explain or understand any action 
we have to exhibit it as the expression of some single conative 
disposition, or of a conflict of, or of some conjunction of, such 
tendencies, according to the plan of organization of the char- 
acter; and that, when we thus show it to be an instance of 
conation or appetition conforming to the most general laws of 
appetition, we do all that as men of science we can be called 
upon to do.”

THE SELF 
x. Comment on the following quotation from Pillsbury: 
“Mind [on the one hand] is not a collection of unrelated 
faculties and, on the other, . . . it is not a single force or 
faculty, but rather . . . mind is merely a term applied to a 
number of different functions spoken of collectively. . . - 
When certain of these separate functions are grouped in ont 
way or to the attainment of one end, the process is perception; 
when grouped in another way, imagination; in a third, memory; 
and in a fourth, reasoning. When other functions are intro- 
duced and practical activities are controlled, the process is 
will. Other modifications constitute the emotional and affective 
processes. In any event, what gives the name to the functiot 
in every day life and in scientific usage is not the materials 
of which the mental state is composed or even the laws re- 
vealed in its operation, but the end that the function sub- 
serves. The fundamental laws of operation and the simple 
elements are relatively few as compared with the ends and 
the names for functions or ‘faculties, either popular of 
scientific.”

118. Explain and justify the following quotation from 
Pillsbury: “ Mind [on the one hand] is not a collection of 
unrelated faculties and, on the other, .. . it is not a single 
force or faculty, but rather . . . mind is merely a term applied 
to a number of different functions spoken of collectively. . . . 
When certain of these separate functions are grouped in one 
way or to the attainment of one end, the process is perception; 
when grouped in another way, imagination; in a third, memory; 
and in a fourth, reasoning. When other functions are intro- 
duced and practical activities are controlled, the process is 
will. Other modifications constitute the emotional and affective 
processes. In any event, what gives the name to the function 
in everyday life and in scientific usage is not the materials 
of which the mental state is composed or even the laws revealed 
in its operation, but the end that the function subsetves. The 
fundamental Jaws of operation and the simple elements are 
relatively few as compared with the ends and the names for 
functions or faculties, either popular or scientific.”

  LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. 
DeparrMent or THE Iyrertor, 
Bureau or Epucarton, 
Washington, July 16, 1924. 
Sir: During the period of years since the World War there has 
been an unprecedented school building program undertaken to 
relieve congestion which developed under war-time conditions. 
This congestion is only partly relieved and schools will be built in 
increasing numbers during the next few years. More than a billion 
dollars will be expended for this purpose in the next half decade. 
It is highly important that these buildings should be constructed to 
meet the best requirements of instruction, health, and sanitation, 
with some regard for architectural appearance but imperative that 
economy should be used so far as is consistent with efficiency. 
Those who are responsible for this program are turning to the 
Bureau of Education for advice and assistance. I have, therefore, 
asked Fletcher B. Dresslar, special agent of the Bureau of Educa- 
tion, to prepare this exhaustive study of American school buildings, 
and I ask that it be printed as a bulletin of the Bureau of Education. 
It will be of immense value at this time to State departments, 
county boards of education, city boards of education, and all those 
who are responsible for the building of schools. 
Respectfully submitted.

Commissioner.

INTRODUCTION. 
Since the publication by the Bureau of Education of Bulletin 
(1910) No. 5, entitled “American Schoolhouses” much progress has 
been made in school architecture from every point of view. In 
this revised edition such changes and such additions have been 
made in the text as will, it is hoped, bring this progress to the 
attention of school authorities in all essential details. The illustra- 
tions, both of floor plans and elevations of school buildings, are 
mostly new, and serve as an attempt to give a cross section of pres- 
ent acceptable standards. The preparation of this edition was 
undertaken with the hope that some additional helpful material 
might be brought to this service. The Commissioner of Education 
has requested some of the most prominent school architects of the 
country to furnish for this volume floor plans and elevations of a 
number of their most successful buildings. This volume will, in 
the main, show only high-school buildings, both senior and junior, 
and large buildings for grammar schools for city conditions. Those 
for the country schools will appear in another bulletin. 
The author is under great obligation to boards of education, and 
especially to the school architects of the country who have so 
generously contributed photographs, drawings, and much service for 
the common good of American schools.

  AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
I. LOCATION OF A SCHOOLHOUSE. 
The first thing to consider in selecting a site for a school building 
is, of course, the convenience of all the children. The schoolhouse 
ought to be so situated as to make it most easily and safely accessible 
for the greatest number. But the fear of some possible incon- 
venience in this way to a part of the pupils should never allow more 
important considerations to be neglected. It is a matter of small 
moment that a few of the children be compelled to walk a little 
', farther than the others, if thereby a better and larger school ground 
can be secured. 
It seems to be a very difficult matter to get parents and boards of 
education to realize fully how important to the comfort, pleasure, 
and welfare of the children are large and well-situated school 
grounds. They can readily see that cattle and horses will not thrive 
and remain healthy when kept in small inclosures, but for some 
reason they do not extend the same consideration to their children. 
Hundreds of towns and villages and even many large cities could 
have large school grounds well located, instead of cramped quarters 
in the midst of noise and dust, if the people could be persuaded that 
the hardship imposed on children in walking a longer distance to 
school is far less serious than that of being housed in buildings 
situated on small lots, hemmed in by other buildings, and immersed 
in foul air, dust, and the din of the hurrying multitudes. There is 
a show of reason in providing buildings near their homes for chil- 
dren in the primary classes; but those in the intermediate grades and 
‘the high school would be accommodated better, and more rationally 
treated from every point of view, even at the expense of a long walk, 
if, upon arrival at the schoolhouse, they could have before them a 
day’s work in a pure atmosphere, freedom from the interruptions of 
outside life, and a place to play together. 
While the location of the schoolhouse is primarily and necessarily 
the duty of a school board or of some special officer to whom this 
duty is delegated, it is nevertheless true that teachers, if prepared to 
advise in such matters, can often be of the greatest assistance by 
bringing before the minds of the people the important questions of 
playgrounds and of sanitary surroundings.

  2 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
The lack of such professional interest was forcibly illustrated to me 
some years ago. I was engaged to teach in the high school of a 
thriving town where the people were hearty supporters of their 
public schools, and invariably evinced their interest. by electing their 
most intelligent townsmen to positions on the school board. At the 
time in question three college men had been chosen, all of whom 
were leading physicians. During the previous year the same board 
had erected an additional building. A lot was chosen in the worst 
possible place. There happened to be for sale at the time a rather 
large block of ground in, topographically, the lowest part of town. 
It was a worthless piece of ground and had been shunned even by 
manufacturing establishments because it was too low and wet. Just 
to the east there was a livery stable, while to the west, one block 
away, there was a flouring mill and a railway with noisy, smoky 
engines frequently tugging their trains up a heavy grade. To the 
south, running along the edge of the grounds, there was a little 
stream which of necessity carried away much of the surface water 
from the public streets. The bed of this stream was scarcely 6 
feet lower than the foundation of the building. Here, despite these 
and many other unfavorable conditions, a large brick building had 
been erected and into it hundreds of the children of the town were 
gathered. Think of what this means! Forcing all the children of 
a town who attend a high school to spend the best hours of the best 
part of their lives in a place not fit for a factory is not only a crime 
against the children but it is in direct opposition to the spirit, if 
not the letter, of the law. Besides much time is wasted in that. 
school every day, for the teachers must often stop the recitations until 
the noisy trains have gone by. There is not the least doubt in my 
mind that if the teachers had been alive to the questions of school 
sanitation even in this one regard, they could have been instrumental 
in averting this serious blunder. The average business man does 
not think of these things, and it is the duty of the teachers to bring 
the facts clearly before the people. 
Another very important question concerning the location of 
schools, especially in cities and villages, has to do with the avoidance 
of disturbing noises. It is a far more serious error to locate school 
buildings near railways, noisy factories, or busy thoroughfares than a 
first thought would seem to indicate. The rattle and roar of a noisy 
train or of a heavy wagon not only tends to disturb the pupils while 
at study but it is impossible to carry on a recitation in a satisfactory 
manner during such distractions. It may be argued that children 
soon get used to all such noises and pay little attention to them. 
Indeed, we have had thoughtful people tell us that it is good for 
children, for it teaches them to concentrate their thoughts, and
-P-A-G-E-13

thereby to neglect those things irrelevant to their work. But it 
must be remembered that although we learn to disregard very much 
of the stimuli with which we are constantly assailed, our nervous 
systems are continually exposed and irritated. There is a persistent 
demand and drain on the nervous system notwithstanding the mind 
may apparently be at ease. With most children mental concentration 
is an utter impossibility when distractions are present. They are 
drawn hither and thither by almost every passing stimulus, hence any 
unnecessary excitement should be avoided. The educational de- 
mands made upon the children of to-day are sufficiently great to 
exact of them all the energy available, and it is little less than crim- 
inal to place them in conditions that compel them to waste their 
energy. Most children who live in the larger cities are never in 
repose. They are bathed in this constant turmoil of noise both day 
and night, and as a result their nervous systems are levied upon 
incessantly to no purpose at all. 
The rapid growth of modern cities suggests that in the near future 
radical changes must be made in the selection of school locations. 
The increasing values assigned to land near congested centers will 
of necessity limit the school grounds to the smallest possible space 
and tend to enforce the construction of taller buildings. With such 
restriction in the size of school lots the danger of fire will be greater, 
while noises, dust, and dirt will, in all probability, increase pro- 
portionately. 
/ It would be more economical and far more hygienic for cities to 
set apart certain large areas in healthful localities, and use these for 
the sites of many school buildings, and, if need be, furnish free 
transportation to those children whose homes are at too great a dis- 
tance from the schools. 
There is in the city of Nashville to-day a four-story high-school 
building, recently completed, that accommodates something like 
2,000 students. It is improperly oriented and has not a square foot’ 
of playground. In its vicinity street cars clang, automobile horns 
scream, and heavy trucks rattle; dust and smoke pour into the build- 
ing from all sides, and all because no one foresaw what was to 
happen, or at least was willing to prevent it. 
This edifice and the ground on which it stands represent an out- 
lay of approximately a million dollars. Within a few years the 
building will doubtless have to be given up for another one better 
located; for the best school work can not be done here safely and 
economically. 
The same building, or better, on a 10-acre school ground might 
have been had for less money and with less inconvenience a mile 
or so from this center‘of noise and dust. 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
Literally scores of similar illustrations of placing school build- 
ings in noisy, dusty, and dangerous positions, with no room for 
playgrounds, could be cited for each State. There is still great 
need for the education of school officers in this important part of 
their work. Every school superintendent and teacher must be urged 
to exert all the influence possible to bring about further reform in 
this regard, else this sort of thing will continue indefinitely. - 
In recent years the consolidation of rural districts into larger 
units has made distinct and, in some sections, remarkable progress. 
Along with this consolidation have come better locations for school 
buildings, larger grounds, and great improvements in buildings, in- 
struction, and sanitation. There has as yet been comparatively 
little change in cities from the old order of things, but a growing 
sentiment for school betterment has already operated, in some cases, 
in demanding and securing more extensive grounds and better loca- 
tions for school buildings even at the expense of greater distances 
from the homes of the children. 
It is often very difficult to secure proper light in the classrooms 
when the school building is situated in close proximity to tall build- 
ings. Hither the light will be partly shut off or the reflections will 
annoy and harm the vision. For the first reason it is a mistake to 
build too near a hillside. Unless each child can see some part of 
the sky while at his desk, the probabilities are that the light will be 
insufficient. Tall buildings and high hills so raise the horizon line 
that those who are sitting farthest away from the windows in school- 
rooms so placed la vor at a great disadvantage. 
After a site has oe selected, much trouble may be prevented by 
carefully considering the location and orientation of the building on 
the lot. To those who have not taught in schools these points will 
scarcely appeal in the light of their real importance. But the fact 
is that the proper lighting of a schoolroom and the usefulness of the 
average’ limited playground depend very largely on the way the 
building is placed. 
If possible, the windows of a classroom ought to open toward the 
east or west, never toward the south, in the latitude of this country, 
and only in a few cases toward the north. Special reasons will be 
given for this preference in the discussion of the subject of lighting. 
It is enough here to remark that no amount of after adjustment can 
overcome the difficulties introduced by facing the windows in the 
wrong direction. (See Appendix.) In most climates the play- 
ground ought to be so exposed to the direct sunshine during the 
school year as to prevent, as far as possible, a damp or muddy sur- 
face. When the building is properly placed on the lot, the play- 
ground is not divided, and at the same time’ the sunshine is given 
free access to it.

PROTECTION AGAINST DAMPNESS, 5 
II. SOIL AND DRAINAGE. 
In the location of all structures for the habitation of man_the 
selection of the soil upon which the building is to stand is an impor- 
tant consideration. This is especially true with schoolhouses, for 
it must be remembered that every sanitary precaution necessary in 
private homes should be enforced as rigorously in schoolhouses. All 
authorities agree that such buildings should be located on soil as 
free from moisture as possible. The matter becomes doubly impor- 
tant when we take into consideration the playground. 
There can not always be a choice of soils, and where there is 
undue dampness the best of drainage should be provided, both for the 
ground on which the building stands and for the playground. 
Other conditions being equal, an elevated site should be selected 
for the building, provided there is. suitable ground attached for 
playground purposes; but where the available land is flat an adequate 
system of underdrainage should be arranged. 
III. PROTECTION AGAINST DAMPNESS. 
Concrete foundations with good wide footings are doubtless the 
best which can be used and when made with scientific care are much 
less porous than brick. But there must be a layer of some inde- 
structible material, impervious to water, built into all basement walls 
and piers, otherwise dampness will find its way into the rooms above. 
Furthermore, this layer must of course be above ground, must be 
entirely hidden or inconspicuous, and must in no way detract. from 
the strength or permanency of the walls. 
It has been found that a thin layer of slate embedded in rich, fine 
cement mortar will break the capillarity in a wall of cement, stone, or 
bricks and thereby prevent the moisture from the ground rising 
above it. This material has also the advantage of strength and en- 
durance. It has also been found that a thin layer or coating of hard 
asphaltum embedded in the walls will serve the same purpose and 
will in no way impair the strength of the walls. These damp-proof 
layers are not expensive, especially if asphaltum or some effective 
damp-proof paint is used, and there is no reason why they should be 
left out. Even a layer of tarred paper on the top of a wall will be 
of some service for years. Perhaps the best method of damp proof- 
ing foundations consists in the use of a thin layer of 1 to 1 cement. 
In addition the outside of all basement walls below ground should 
be coated with boiling tar or asphaltum before excavations are filled, 
for this will materially aid in preventing the absorption of the 
ground water by the walls, especially during rainy weather. Where 
basements are built this is a necessity, if the air within them is to be 
kept at all wholesome.
-P-A-G-E-16
a ee ef tee 
6 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
The figure on the following page will make clear the points herein 
enumerated. 
Not only do rainstorms beat against the outer walls of a building 
and saturate them, especially if they are of brick, but frequently 
eaves are not supplied with gutters and spouts to carry away from 
the building the water shed from the roof. When this is the case it 
is certain that the walls of the upper part of basements will be satu- 
rated, even though the normal water line is much below all parts of 
the foundation. Furthermore, it is too frequently true that leaky 
eavespouts are allowed to saturate basement walls and those above 
ground. 
The safe thing, therefore, is to provide all school buildings (dwell- 
ings as well) with strong, durable eave gutters, and a sufficient num- 
ber of down pipes to carry off the water from even the hardest rains. 
These down pipes should empty into impervious earthen pipes or 
cement drains, so that the water will be delivered at a safe distance 
from the walls. It is very poor economy to provide gutters and 
pipes and then let the water pour on the ground at every corner of 
the house. 
Schoolhouses should never be located where it is impossible to get 
a free and easy outlet for a drain through which the water line about 
the building may be kept always below the foundations and basement 
floors. The tiles for this drain should be farm drain tile, well 
burned so they will resist decay and safely bear all strain to which 
they may be subjected. The joints should be left slightly open and 
covered for some inches with coarse gravel or broken stone. It is a 
useless expense to fill the entire excavation with gravel or stone, for 
almost all the water finding its way into the tiles rises and enters at 
the bottom of the drain. The only need for gravel or broken stone 
at all arises from the fact that if the soil is sandy or a loose loam 
there is danger that enough of it will enter the joints in time to clog 
the drain. If the joints are sufficiently protected with coarse gravel 
or bits of broken stone to prevent the surrounding soil from entering, 
all requirements in this regard have been met. Almost no water 
drops directly down to the drain, and especially so if the ground 
surrounding the building slopes away from it, thus carrying surface 
water away from the walls. This drain should always be placed 
lower in the ground than the foundations, so that the water line will 
never reach the walls for any length of time. In general practice, 
if this drain is 8 inches lower than the basement there will be little 
or no trouble with ground waters. 
This precaution is absolutely necessary for all buildings with a 
basement, for unless the water line is kept below the level of the 
floor of the basement it will be impossible to prevent water from 
rising in it. It is a mistaken notion, and a very common one, too,

that if a basement is thoroughly cemented, both floor and walls, no 
water can get into it. Contrary to the belief of a great many people 
who are just beginning their experience with cement, it is not im- 
pervious to water, and under a comparatively slight pressure water 
will readily find its way through well set and carefully made cement 
floors. Unless, therefore, those who introduce basement floors into 
a school building have placed the building on high land, with the 
ground sloping away from it rapidly in all directions, they must en- 
circle it with a drain as indicated in Figure 1, or it is perfectly certain 
that no reasonable amount of cementing within will prevent the 
water from entering. I am insistent on this point, for the reason 
that I have seen almost no end of trouble and much unexpected 
expense grow out of neglect in this matter. It is not expensive, 
save in rare cases where buildings are badly placed, to drain the 
ground as indicated. The tiles needed are only such as farmers use 
in underdraining land, and the labor required to put them down can 
be done by any ordinary workman, with the exception of the leveling, 
and even this requires no expert service in many cases. Generally 
speaking, such*drains save more than they cost. For when these are 
properly placed a great deal less care is required in finishing the 
basement, and often much expense in cement work can be saved. 
It is never well to run drains under a basement floor, especially if 
they connect directly or indirectly with a sewer system. In fact, 
it is unsafe to connect the outside drains with sewers, for the gases 
and odors given off by sewage may filter through the ground and 
render it unwholesome. All drains, then, should come to the sur- 
face, or empty into a trap, rendering it impossible for sewer gas 
to collect in or about schoolhouses. Furthermore, it is wholly un- 
necessary, even in the case of large buildings, to put any drains © 
under the building, if drains have been placed all around them and 
deeper than the foundations or basement floors; for, since the ground 
under the building is protected from rains, no moisture can gather 
there unless it comes from the outside and is either forced up by 
the pressure of the waters on higher ground or pours in from the 
surface. But a drain outside will relieve all pressure from below 
and ordinary embankments will protect from surface water. 
This drain should be about 6 or 8 feet outside the foundation walls, 
and if the tiles are sufficiently large and the drain has a sufficient 
fall to its outlet, the down pipes from the eave spouts can be made to 
deliver their water into them through solid and thoroughly water- 
proofed pipes. In this way all roof water can be quickly carried. 
away. Common sense will teach those who undertake this to avoid 
overfeeding the drain pipes and to make sure the leaves and soot, 
which often gather on roofs in the fall time, do not clog the drains.
-P-A-G-E-19
  
PLANNING. 9 
Sometimes in large and irregularly shaped buildings it is necessary 
to introduce laterals into the main drain in order to insure rapid, 
safe, and complete drainage of the ground all about the schoolhouse, 
but this can be left to the judgment of the architect, to be treated 
as the exigencies of the situation demand. 
IV. PLANNING. 
1. BASEMENTS. 
It is highly advisable that a basement be constructed under all 
school buildings which are situated where adequate drainage can be 
provided. There are several reasons why this should be done, chief 
among which are the following: 
A basement, when properly placed, provides a good location for 
engine rooms and central heating and ventilating plants. The noise 
and dirt incident to maintaining fires, removing ashes, and preparing 
fuel are least disturbing here, while the ducts designed to carry 
warm air from furnaces, or steam pipes from boilers, can be de- 
livered into the classrooms more economically and effectively than 
if they had their source outside of the building. Of course, in large 
buildings, or for a group of buildings, it is far better to locate boil- 
ers in a separate structure if ample room is at command. But as 
conditions are to-day, nearly all heating plants for schoolhouses are 
located in the buildings themselves, and by the use of low-pressure 
boilers or hot-water systems there is comparatively little danger or 
annoyance. From the point of view of economy in construction there 
is often a great saving, for under ordinary conditions at the same 
expense more space can be provided in a basement than in any other 
part of the building. A well-constructed basement provided with 
good means of ventilation and underdrainage is one of the most 
effective agencies in preventing the rise of moisture in the walls and 
ground air into the classrooms and halls. 
Room for fuel storage is quite important, and when thoroughly 
fireproofed the basement affords the most economical and convenient 
place. Naturally, this room and the furnace room should be closely 
connected and in every case made completely safe from fire hazards. 
This can be done by making the chimney safe, constructing the ceil- 
ing of reinforced concrete, and the walls surrounding of brick or con- 
crete. Naturally, these rooms must be kept free from all ashes and 
cinders and all unnecessary combustibles. 
Basements are generally used for the location of urinals and 
toilets. No one will say that this is an ideal location for them; 
but when due care is taken and good systems are correctly installed 
and intelligently kept there can not be very grave faults found 
with such location. There are some advantages and some dis-
-P-A-G-E-20
  
10 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
advantages. One advantage lies in the ease with which they can be 
isolated, another their accessibility from playgrounds. The chief 
disadvantages lie in lack of light and ventilation and a tendency to 
liberty in basement not so noticeable in similar rooms above ground. 
Playrooms in basements are not advisable unless these are near 
the level of the ground and are thoroughly lighted and ventilated. 
Cement floors are not satisfactory to play upon. 
The ceilings of all basements should be at least 10 feet high, with 
not more than.4 feet of excavation. Even this is too deep if the 
soil is damp and the ground-water line high. For example, experi- 
ence with a well-built modern high-school building situated on allu- 
vial soil, with a long sloping rise behind it, taught me that the rush 
of water through such soil in wet weather is very difficult to meet. 
A thick cement floor would not keep it out, though the excavation 
was not greater than 3} feet. Proper drainage, however, brought 
relief. | 
On ground easily drained and higher than that anywhere in the im- 
mediate neighborhood it may be advisable, for the sake of appear- 
ance and expense, to go deeper, but this will have to be determined 
by local situations and local needs. 
It is always well to remember that where some advantage is gained 
by going deeper into the ground than here recommended, area- 
ways can be resorted to for securing light and ventilation. 
If basement floors are nearer the first-floor joists than 10 feet, it 
will be difficult to install the plumbing and air ducts for heating 
and ventilation, if mechanical systems are used, without placing them 
so low that they will interfere with the heads of teachers and janitors, 
and at the same time offer opportunity for the children in their play 
to hit them “just for fun.” It should be remembered that if air is 
to be delivered mechanically into schoolrooms there must be large 
ducts, well protected from cold and with no sharp turns or elbows. 
The failure to do this has rendered many expensive heating and 
ventilating plants unsatisfactory. Invariably, if the basement ceil- 
ing is too low, sacrifices will be made in the inclination and size of 
these ducts, and if not rendered seriously defective they will neces- 
sitate more power to deliver the air needed. And just here it is 
well to emphasize the fact that basement plans deserve a great deal 
of study before they have been finally accepted. In fact definite 
plans and specifications for basements ought to include all the plumb- 
ing, furnaces, air ducts, etc., in order that one can see exactly what 
the completed basement will include, where every appliance will be 
placed, and how it will fit. Failure to do this leads to many mal- 
adjustments which give trouble from the very start. For example, 
suppose the schoolhouse is to be near a busy street: where much dust 
is raised by passing vehicles. At once one will say that no air 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  
PLANNING. ee? 
should be drawn from that side of the building into the schoolrooms, 
and that the basement arrangements must be made to meet this de- 
mand. Economy and practical sense both dictate an arrangement 
of the intake that will take advantage of the prevailing wind and 
not compel the fan to work against it. It is sometimes advisable to 
supply two openings for the intake of fresh air so as to be able to 
use the one best suited to the conditions of the day. These openings, 
as explained elsewhere, ought to be sufficiently above the ground to 
avoid dust and possible ground air. 
On the whole, a good quality of cement makes the best floors for 
basements. Asphaltum can be used, but it is more likely to become 
rough and uneven and is more difficult to lay evenly and level. Still, 
it is more impervious to the rise of ground air than cement. 
If finances will permit, the basement walls can be veneered with 
glazed light-colored brick or tile to good advantage. This treat- 
ment will greatly increase the light, render the walls more sanitary, 
and invite less defacement. Such walls are easily cleaned and kept 
bright and fresh. This treatment of toilet rooms, wash rooms, and 
bathrooms in basements is especially recommended. 
Too much pains can not be taken in placing piers and walls in 
basements so as to intercept as little light as possible. Frequently, 
instead of a solid supporting wall, piers supporting cross beams can 
be used, thereby rendering the basement more open and airy and 
increasing the light. Sometimes arches can be constructed of brick 
or concrete, accomplishing the same ends without in any way in- 
creasing the expense or weakening the building. 
2. THE CLASSROOM. 
The primary unit of a school building is the classroom, and no 
definite plans for a building can be thought out until a decision has 
been reached as to the size, form, and number of classrooms desired. 
Since the number will vary to suit local conditions, it is not necessary 
at this time to discuss this point; but the size and form of classrooms 
are matters which ought to be decided in accordance with hygienic 
and pedagogical principles, and it is necessary to consider these 
points rather carefully. 
(a) DIMENSIONS. 
The size of the classroom for elementary school purposes ought to 
approximate the following requirements: 
It should be sufficiently large to seat properly from 35 to 40 pupils, 
and at the same time have sufficient space left for aisles and the 
requisite furniture and apparatus. This limit as to the number of 
pupils is based on the theory that no teacher ought to be asked to 
teach more than 35 or 40 pupils, even though they all belong to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-22

12 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
same grade and are doing approximately the same work. It is not 
infrequent, however, to find more than 50 pupils to a classroom in 
the intermediate grades. One effective way to render this impossible 
is to make the room of such a size that when the seats for 35 or 40 
pupils, the maximum, are properly placed there will be no room left 
for crowding in any more. This may seem a rather indirect way to 
prevent overcrowding in a room, but all practical schoolmen know 
that as long as there is room for more they are likely to be crowded 
in. A room 22 feet wide and 30 feet long will comfortably seat this

aisles, etc. 
number, allowing ample space for aisles, blackboard workers, and 
space for reference table, sand tables, or any other pieces of appara- 
tus regularly needed. 
These dimensions are reduced from those recommended in the 
original edition of this bulletin for the reason that public opinion 
has developed during the past 10 years to such a degree as to permit 
such a reduction. In general, teachers are not called on now to 
handle so many children and hence the classroom can be reduced in 
the interest. of economy of construction and upkeep. During the 
past 10 years little or no regret or dissatisfaction has been voiced 
by school officers because of these reduced dimensions. Therefore, 
these dimensions in length and breadth of a classroom for elementary
-P-A-G-E-23
  
PLANNING. 13 
grades are recommended with the assurance that they have proved 
acceptable in practice and of course have introduced decided econo- 
mies in construction and care. 
If the reader will take the time to study the floor plans of buildings 
from all parts of the country reproduced in this volume, he will get 
an approximate idea of the prevailing standards now carried out in 
practice. 
It must be held in mind, however, that the figures given are for 
classrooms of buildings designed for the elementary grades only. 
Classrooms for high-school buildings should not be so standardized, 
because of the varied sizes of classes to be taught. Each building 
for high-school classes should have several sizes of recitation 
rooms, lecture rooms, and special rooms of various kinds, and 
the proper dimensions of these can only be determined by a 
careful study of the courses offered. It is very poor economy to 
teach a small class in advanced Latin, mathematics, or any other 
subject in a classroom large enough for four times the number of 
students. This, however, is often done, because the architect or the 
. one responsible for the planning did not make a careful study of 
what high-school students do, and how the number of pupils are 
proportioned to the subjects offered. Manifestly, however, the gen- 
eral hygienic requirements set forth for elementary students should 
be adhered to for high-school students. 
Elsewhere in this bulletin attention has been called to the fact that 
there should be considerable variety in the sizes of the high- 
school classrooms, both from the point of view of the economy of 
building upkeep and care and also from the point of view of the 
teacher. Objection has been raised by a teacher, let us say in Latin, 
to going from her regular classroom where she may have most of 
her references books, maps, charts, etc., into a small room for an 
advanced class; but in reality there is very little trouble about this, 
for such helps as are actually needed are not troublesome to supply 
nor to segregate from those needed by the general classes. Ordi- 
narily, however, in large high schools several rooms are needed for 
instruction in each of the major subjects of the curriculum, and the 
handling of classes and supplies is correspondingly simple. Economi- 
cally speaking it is a mistake to allow classrooms to be idle several 
periods a week simply because they are marked as rooms for 
mathematics, English, Latin or other subjects. Teachers sometimes 
are considerably disturbed, even disgruntled, when “ their rooms” 
are of necessity used for classes in other subjects. Their contentions 
run about as follows: “This is my room with my books, refer- 
ences, charts, maps, and at times board work which should not 
be disturbed. I need some time to prepare my work for the class and 
naturally the best place to do that is in my classroom, hence there
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
must be several periods in which my classroom is not to be occupied 
by any class.” There is an element of truth and propriety in the 
foregoing statement, but most of the difficulties suggested can be 
eliminated by supplying departmental office rooms, library rooms, 
and study halls which are necessary for all large high schools. In 
general, then, at least three sizes of classrooms—not including labora- 
tories and study halls—should be provided in large high schools. 
The largest of these should be designated for not more than 35 to 
40 students, the middle size for about 20, and the smallest for about 
10. Architects may easily plan buildings to meet these demands if 
those who are in charge of the schools will make such studies of their 
classes and class rolls as will set forth actual needs. 
With this variety in sizes of actual classrooms there will be no 
need for excuse for shifting partitions or introducing the abomina- 
tion of folding doors. 
By reference to a number of the floor plans for high schools re- 
produced in this volume it will be seen that some variety in size 
of classrooms prevails. Generally speaking, however, buildings 
designed for not more than 300 or 400 students show less variation 
in this regard than those designed for larger numbers. This could 
have been anticipated on the basis of practical demands. Elective 
courses and increasing emphasis on sciences, English literature, 
modern languages, and commercial branches have broken up all first, 
second, and especially third and fourth year classes into smaller 
groups than was formerly the case. Here again, then, architects and 
school boards must consult teachers and study curricula and class 
registrations in order to plan conveniently and economically. The 
classrooms and recitation rooms of high schools can not be stand- 
ardized in regard to amount of floor space as can those for elemen- 
tary schools. 
(0) LENGTH OF ROOM. 
A classroom must not be so long that a pupil seated in the back of 
the room will have any difficulty, even with good light, in seeing 
easily and distinctly any ordinarily clear writing or drawing which 
the teacher may place upon the board in the front of the room, orsuch 
charts and models as are often used for the instruction of the whole 
class. It has been found by careful experimentation that the distance 
at which a normal eye can easily see well-written or printed letters an 
inch and a half high is about 29 feet. Burgerstein says: “According 
to my experience the distance at which a normal eye can see script 
4 centimeters high, written rather heavily on a blackboard, is 9 
meters (294 feet).” He concludes that it would be a good thing, 
therefore, to limit the maximum length of a schoolroom to 9 meters.
-P-A-G-E-25
  
PLANNING. 15 
(Handbuch der Schulhygiene, Burgerstein and Netolitzky, second 
edition, 1902, p. 116.) 2 
Burgerstein says in a later book that, all things considered, one 
will find that a classroom 9 meters (294 feet) long, 6 meters (194 
feet) broad, and 4 meters (little over 13 feet) high is about the 
proper size for serviceable use. (Schulhygiene [Aus Natur und 
Geisteswelt], 1906, Leo Burgerstein, p. 31.) 
He says such a room will accommodate double benches for 50 
pupils. His reasons for this size of room are normal requirements 
for vision, hearing, and the depth to which light will carry. 
Schmid-Monnard and Schmidt practically agree with Burgerstein. 
They suggest that the width might be extended to 64 meters (21 feet 
4 inches). (Schulgesundheitspflege, Kin Handbuch fiir Lehrer, 
Arete und Verwaltungs-Beamte. Leipzig, 1902. p. 14.) 
A room of this length will make it easy for a child who sits in a 
rear seat to hear distinctly when the teacher at the other end of the 
room speaks in a clear, distinct voice with moderate force and natural 
intonation. In the primary grades especially a large part of the 
instruction must of necessity be given orally, and since the children 
must hear the words of the mother tongue accurately if they are 
expected to learn to speak them correctly, it is of vital importance 
that their classrooms be adjusted to this demand. Unfortunately, 
many teachers have failed to cultivate a speaking voice that will 
carry well and at the same time maintain a good tone with distinct- 
ness. Poor spelling frequently results from inaccurate pronuncia- 
tion and faulty articulation. This defect in school work was made 
clear by the investigations of Miss Wiltse, who found poor hearing 
responsible for much bad spelling. (Proc. National Education 
Association, 1892.) 
It has been found by observation and careful investigation that 
the ordinary speaking voice, such as should be used in a schoolroom, 
will not carry with sufficient force beyond 30 feet to enable normal 
children to hear easily and accurately. It is very tiresome to have 
to strive to hear what is said, and the fatigue resulting from con- 
tinued effort to hear is harmfully annoying and distracting. Fur- 
thermore, no teacher should be kept in a schoolvoom that makes it 
necessary for her to tire her voice unduly or waste her time in repeat- 
ing. Hence 30 feet is a safe length for hearing, vision, and the num- 
ber of children properly in charge of one teacher. 
In the length proposed I have allowed “ample room” for black- 
board workers, for aisles, and for tables at the teacher’s end of the 
room. By leaving an aisle 30 inches wide behind the last row of seats 
the pupils farthest from the teacher are well within hearing and 
seeing distance. .In a shorter room there would not be space enough  
-P-A-G-E-26
    16 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
for passing and for work at the board, and especially so if, as often 
happens, the cloakroom must be placed adjoining the rear end of the 
classroom. Figure 2 illustrates a room of the length and width 
proposed, with the location of desks, the width of aisles, and the 
space at the teacher’s end of the room. 
(c) WIDTH OF THE ROOM. 
The width of the schoolroom, where unilateral lighting is used, 
should never exceed twice the distance from the floor to the top of 
the windows, and where external conditions are unfavorable for good 
light even this width is too great. Most European authorities insist 
that the width of the room should not be greater than one and one- 
half times the distance from the floor to the top of the windows, and 
this demand is repeated by those already quoted. Naturally the 
row of desks farthest. removed from the windows will receive the 
least light, but by grouping the desks as close to the windows as 
sufficient aisle space will permit, my experience is that in most parts 
of our country 22 feet is not too great a width. This will permit 
ample space for 35 to 40 single desks and still leave room for aisles, 
space for the teacher, apparatus, and the workers at. the blackboards. 
However, one must not forget that light decreases as the square of 
the distance increases, and that those pupils removed the greatest 
distance from the light are those, other things equal, who need most 
attention when matters touching light are considered. Fortunately, 
our country as a whole is better situated with reference to latitude 
than most European countries, especially England, Scandinavia, 
Germany, and Holland. In these countries the winter days are 
very short and the early morning and the afternoon light is dull 
and weak. We can get, on the average, better light during the winter 
season in a room 22 feet wide with the same dimensions of window 
surface than most European countries can get with one 18 feet 
wide. Iam certain that this is true for all the southern and for most 
of the western part of our country. 
(d) HEIGHT OF CEILING. 
The height of a standard classroom should be determined after 
due consideration of several factors. In the first place, the item of 
expense should be considered. Unless some real permanent and im- 
portant pedagogic or architectural ends are to be gained, every foot 
saved in the height will reduce the cost much more than a casual 
calculation would indicate. If the building is to be constructed of 
brick, stone, or concrete, the cost of every foot increases with the 
height above the ground. For instance, if a 35-foot wall is required 
for the basement and two stories of classrooms, 1 foot more added 
to each story would cost more than a foot of the same wall lower in
-P-A-G-E-27
  PLANNING. 17 
the building would cost. The cost would also be increased under 
certain conditions by reason of the need of making heavier walls, 
taller chimneys, longer and larger air ducts for heating and ventila- 
tion, and more extensive plumbing. Besides, every foot added to 
the height of a classroom adds so much more expense in keeping it 
in repair, and especially in heating it. 
The item of expense is not, however, the most important factor 
for consideration, though it should not be minimized. Every foot 
added to the height of the interior walls of a schoolroom lifts the 
floor of the story above 1 foot, thereby increasing the length of 
stairways and making it necessary for all pupils whose classrooms 
are above the first floor to climb that much higher. From the 
hygienic point of view there is no special disadvantage in this for 
the boys, but it is an added hardship on adolescent girls. In case of 
fire or earthquake there is also increased danger. There is also a 
loss of time. If climbing stairs is disagreeable and tiresome to 
anemic pupils, they will frequently remain in the classrooms during 
* intermissions rather than go into the fresh air. Besides all these 
considerations the matter of acoustics deserves attention. Echoes 
are very distressing in any public assembly room, but they are serious 
disturbances in classrooms. Other things equal, rooms with tall 
ceilings are more troublesome in this regard than are rooms with 
lower ceilings. Architects have worked out no fast and safe rule 
which, if followed, will insure the best acoustic conditions. Since 
steel lath has been introduced for plastering and concrete construc- 
tion is becoming more common, it seems that troublesome echoes are 
more frequent than ever before, and every precaution should be 
taken to deaden the walls in school buildings to prevent this grave 
annoyance. 
. Nevertheless, it is necessary to make a classroom sufficiently high 
to insure the proper placing of windows, adequate area of glass sur- 
face, and the conditions necessary for suitable ventilation. 
Having considered these points even briefly, it seems that we shall 
not err to any great degree if we recommend that a standard class- 
room for the public elementary schools of our country should be 30 
feet long, 22 feet wide, and 123 feet high from finished floor to 
finished ceiling. 
Naturally where the area of glass surface required to light the 
room will be more than one-sixth of the floor surface, and especially 
where a ratio of 1 to 4 is needed, windows will have to be spaced 
carefully. The decision, therefore, as to the exact height of a class- 
room ought to depend somewhat on local conditions with reference to 
the source and quantity of light generally available. 
One of the objections which will be urged against making the ceil- 
ings of our classrooms 12} feet in the clear is this: It will deprive
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
the pupils of air space and hence make the problem of ventilation 
more difficult. At first thought this objection seems valid; but it is 
fully answered when it is stated that children need the same amount 
of fresh air per minute whether they are in a large room or a small 
one, and consequently after the initial supply is vitiated the same 
amount must be introduced in either case. 
Where any system of forced ventilation is used, the only difference 
there would be between supplying a room 124 feet high and one a 
foot higher would grow out of the fact that it would take a fraction 
of a minute longer for the children to vitiate the air in the room with 
the higher ceiling when the fan was not running at sufficient speed 
to supply an adequate amount. This difference is so small as to be 
negligible. 
In rooms where the ceilings are 134 feet high, and where the win- 
dows run to within 6 inches of the ceiling, there is a slight advantage 
if ventilation is to be provided by means of the windows alone. For, 
since warm air is lighter than cold air, there will be a little more 
pressure exerted to drive out the warm air where the windows are 
higher above the floor. This would create a slightly more rapid cir- 
culation, especially when outside air is much colder than that de- 
manded in the classroom. But this difference in circulation will 
depend very largely on the management of the windows, and since 
teachers can not be depended on to keep the windows at all times 
properly adjusted this advantage may not be realized in a practical 
way. 
In planning buildings for high-school purposes, the size of class- 
rooms may vary a great deal, as suggested previously, in order to 
meet the requirements for different-sized classes. Some subjects at- 
tract a relatively small number of students, and it would be not only 
uselessly expensive to construct large rooms for such classes but 
would entail needless expense in maintenance. 
3. HALLS. 
From the teacher’s point of view, there are some requirements in 
the construction of halls in school buildings that deserve more con- 
sideration than architects are at times inclined to give. 
The units of the school building are the classrooms, which, of 
course, deserve prime consideration. But it is a mistake to sacrifice 
too much in the form, size, and lighting of halls in order that any 
specific scheme of classrooms may be carried out. I wish, therefore, 
to emphasize some essentials in the construction of halls and to urge 
teachers to see that these are called to the attention of architects and 
the members of boards of education. 
They must be wide enough to prevent congestion while students 
are gathering in the morning or passing between classes and during
-P-A-G-E-29
  
PLANNING. 19 
intermissions, and especially at dismissals. It is not possible to 
specify definitely what the width of any hall should be without first 
calculating how many students are likely to use it at any one time, 
but there are certain ideals which ought to be considered. In large 
high-school buildings the main hall should be at least 14 feet wide; 
16 feet is better. A hall 12 feet wide is more spacious for grammar 
grades than one 14 feet wide for high schools accommodating the 
same number of pupils. This is true because of the size of the pupils, 
and because it is rarely necessary for pupils in the grammar grades to 
pass from their room in a body save at intermissions. In high 
schools the rule is for a complete change of rooms for all students 
at the close of each recitation period. This at once makes it clear 
that the hallways of high-school buildings are used much oftener 
than those in buildings designed for the grammar grades. Besides, 
greater precautions are necessary at this stage of life in mixed 
schools to avoid all excuses for that familiarity which crowded halls 
would suggest. Bnt aside from these reasonable and just claims for 
wide halls, it is always expedient to keep in mind dangers from a 
blockade in case of fire. Fire drills will lessen the danger; still, 
nothing but plenty of room will prevent trouble when a lot of people, 
old or young, lose their wits and stampede. <A deficiency at such a 
time is too serious to call for further emphasis. 
Another imperative need for-wide halls is this: Spacious halls 
offer perhaps the best opportunity afforded in any part of a school 
building for the location of pictures, for mural paintings, and those 
touches of art which exert such a powerful, though silent and un- 
conscious, influence upon the lives of young people. A cramped 
narrow hall will not admit of effective decoration. 
Some of the illustrations presented in this bulletin will emphasize 
what has been said in the foregoing, and will doubtless suggest to 
school boards that it is not a waste of money to provide spacious 
halls. 
Halls are more effective and less objectionable when there are no 
projections to obstruct and no constrictions to hinder. A long spa- 
cious hall, terminating at each end in a tasteful stairway with good 
light, is suggestive of a dignity and a decorum to which students 
will unconsciousiy respond. 
The method of putting lockers all along hallways has some advan- 
tages, notably in their management and general care, but they are 
unsightly ; they restrict hallways, invite congestion, are hard to ven- 
tilate and difficult to keep free from dust. The hallways of school- 
rooms, when they are properly constructed and lighted, offer one of 
the best opportunities which the building affords for artistic treat- 
ment and esthetic influence. A wide hallway, with good floors, neat 
panelings, artistic tinting, good light, and a few well-chosen pictures
-P-A-G-E-30
EE EDIE 
20 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
selected and framed to suit, will exert a greater influence on young 
people than “ practical ” Americans are prepared to estimate. 
It is the general professional opinion that hallways should never 
be restricted or despoiled with rows of hat pegs or even closed 
lockers—open ones are an abomination. 
Another essential is plenty of light. In this country it is almost 
universal to flank the two sides of a hall with classrooms, and depend 
on doors at the entrance and windows at the ends of the hall for 
light. In Germany it is the prevailing custom to have classrooms 
on but one side of a hall, and as a result they have better light in the 
halls in their newer school buildings than we do. The American 
plan of construction gives a more thoroughly centralized building, 
and for the same number of rooms a Jess expensive building, but it 
demands wider halls, and introduces a great deal more difficulty in 
supplying them with sufficient light. The German type of building 
introduces difficulties in heating and ventilation which the American 
type readily overcomes. One of the weakest points about our types 
of school buildings is that the halls are not generally attractive and 
are rarely well lighted. 
4. STAIRWAYS. 
In two-story buildings designed for high schools there should be at 
least two stairways from the first floor to the second, and in large 
schools there should be more. These stairways ought to be situated. 
as near the ends or outer walls of the building as the plan of con- 
struction will permit. For when so located there is a natural division 
of the students into groups, and, generally speaking, this, in case of 
panic, will prevent that congestion on stairs and landings which is 
dreaded by all teachers who take precaution against loss of life in 
case of fire. Besides, this location facilitates passing up and down 
stairs between recitations. One hundred students in double file can 
easily descend a broad, well-lighted stairway in 35 seconds, and 
with proper fire drills can reduce this time considerably and with 
all safety, so that they can emerge from the building in a minute to 
a minute and a half. Experience has shown that 1,000 children, 
in a two-story grammar-school building furnished with four stair- 
ways, can be trained to get out safely in a minute if the stairways 
are properly placed and wide enough. Another reason for placing 
the stairways leading to the second floor near the ends or opposite 
sides of the buildings is the fact that fires, as a rule, originate in the 
central part of the building, or if they do not originate there the 
smoke is likely to gather there and render a central stairway dark 
and forbidding. Besides, there is a better chance for light near the 
outside walls and less inflammable materials, especially in brick, 
stone, or cement construction,
-P-A-G-E-31

5. CLOAKROOMS. 
The problem of supplying cloakrooms and lockers for high-school 
pupils is a very different one from that. of supplying comparable 
conveniences for the grammar grades. Generally speaking, high- 
school pupils are moving about from room to room throughout the 
day, and they rarely if ever finish a session with a recitation in the 
same room in which they began; they have no room which they can 
properly call their own, though they may have a “class teacher,” or 
one to whom they are attached for a term for special help and advice ; 
they must have lockers where books and materials can be kept during 
the hours of the day when not in use, and of necessity these rooms 
and lockers must be located where general convenience demands. It 
goes without saying that in high schools there ought to be separate 
cloakrooms for the boys and the girls, and that where possible these 
ought to be well separated from each other in order to prevent 
crowding in the halls and also to insure greater privacy for each. 
In a large school there ought to be at least four of these rooms, two 
upstairs and two on the lower floor, the girls of the third and 
fourth year classes using the one upstairs, while those of the first and 
second years would use the one below, or vice versa, according to 
arrangement of classes. A similar provision also should be made for 
the boys. In small schools one for each sex will suffice. These rooms 
ought to have abundance of light, be well ventilated and warmed, 
and should be located where they can be readily supervised and 
frequently inspected. It is a mistaken policy and poor economy to 
stint in the matter of cloakrooms and lockers, with reference either 
to space or to furniture. Make these rooms neat and attractive, and 
then it is the duty of those in authority to see that they are carefully 
kept and in no way abused by the pupils. It is sometimes more than 
distressing to see how such rooms are misused, especially by the 
boys. Locker doors are broken open for no other reason than that 
a lazy boy will not go home for his forgotten key. Walls are defaced, 
and an air of general carelessness is likely to prevail. The safe 
thing is to make the rooms attractive and deserving of good treat- 
ment, and then demand that they be kept so. 
In general, it is both unhygienic and inconvenient to locate cloak- 
rooms in basements, and especially so when lockers are needed. These 
rooms are rarely well ventilated and lighted, are too far from the 
teachers for inspection and supervision, and they invite pilfering. 
Bicycle stalls can be arranged in basements, but the demands for 
these will be limited, and they will need comparatively little care. 
In taking the position that cloakrooms or lockers for high schools 
should not be situated in basements, the writer is conscious that he is 
opposing a more or less prevalent custom, The basement is the place 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
where architects frequently find it most convenient to locate them, 
and it is argued that there is little or no need for pupils to remain 
long in such rooms and that it is useless waste of space to locate them 
above the basement. It is readily agreed that it is less expensive to 
put them in the basement, but it does not always happen that the 
least expensive is the best or even the most economical in the long 
run. Of course, if a basement floor is not more than 2 feet below the 
surface, and the lighting, heating, and ventilation of the basement 
rooms are looked after with as much care and made as effective as 
in rooms above, there can be little rational objection to using well- 
appointed space in basements for cloakrooms. But there are so 
many basements in small or medium sized buildings 4 feet or more 
below the surface of the ground, with small windows and dark 
rooms, that it is rarely advisable to suggest this as a place for cloak- 
rooms, In large buildings, where the problem of securing proper 
proportion does not call for bringing the main floor close to the sur- 
face of the ground, basement floors can be put at or near a level with 
the surface of the ground, and of course such basements would offer 
a convenient and sanitary location for cloakrooms. But even in 
large public high schools it is not altogether wise to make the base- 
ment a gathering place. The license suggested by a basement when 
so used will certainly operate to make any school more difficult to 
manage, for proper supervision will be very much more difficult 
to maintain. 
Care should be exercised in making cloakrooms as neat, attractive, 
and sanitary as any other rooms in the building. If you wish to 
forestall defilement and lax discipline in any public institution, 
especially in schools, it can not be done more effectively than through 
hygienic toilets guarded with zealous care, or through tasteful 
rooms where students congregate, such as locker rooms, cloakrooms, 
gymnasiums, or assembly halls. It is rarely possible to make a 
basement locker room a pleasant, attractive place, especially for girls. 
The form of lockers used will to some extent depend upon where 
they are placed; but for obvious reasons they should be well venti- 
lated and at the same time strongly made, so as to offer no tempta- 
tion to pilfering. When placed in the basement they are more ex- 
posed to meddlers and thieves than if placed on the floors above, 
and so must be more securely constructed and supervised more 
carefully. 
In grammar schools each classroom must be provided with a well- 
lighted and well-ventilated cloakroom. It is not necessary to make 
separate cloakrooms for the sexes if such rooms are correctly placed, 
sufficiently large, and properly equipped. In small buildings of not 
more than four rooms it is often easy to arrange separate cloak
-P-A-G-E-33
  
PLANNING. 23 
rooms for the sexes, and when it can be done without inconvenience 
or undue expense, it is desirable; but in large buildings much con- 
fusion and its incident difficulties can be avoided by giving each 
classroom one common cloakroom. Entrance to the cloakroom 
should be from the schoolroom and at the end opposite the teacher’s 
desk. This plan gives the teacher control, and prevents anyone from 
entering it during school hours without the teacher’s knowledge. It 
permits of ventilation and heating as described elsewhere, and 
gives the teacher a clear wall at her end of the room. The room 
looks more tidy and there is likely to be less congestion in the front 
of the room. This change from the earlier edition has come about 
as the result of long and continued observations. 
However, the advantages of this location are overbalanced at times 
by architectural demands for placing the cloakroom at the teacher’s 
end of the room, in order to meet the legitimate call for external 
balance and symmetry. 
6. TOILET ROOMS. 
The satisfactory location of toilet rooms in school buildings has 
been one of the hardest problems with which we have had to deal. 
Many architects give far too little consideration to these necessities 
and quite frequently makeshifts are resorted to at the last. In 
small to medium sized buildings for elementary schools, in either 
a one-story or two-story type, a good, well-lighted, and thoroughly 
drained basement may be safely used for toilet rooms. But the 
troubles come usually in poor lighting, imperfect ventilation, defec- 
tive drainage, and disagreeable congestion. 
In large buildings, designed for the use of either elementary or 
high school purposes, especially for high schools, toilet. facilities 
should be provided on each floor for each sex. The best arrange- 
ment is to open them directly from rest rooms or locker rooms and 
not into a common hall. By locating them in the rear of opposite 
wings of the building they are safely isolated, and can be lighted 
and ventilated properly. This arrangement will require, in a two- 
story building, six small rooms, two on each floor, and two in the 
basement. The great advantage in this plan is that, along with 
locker rooms, they can be assigned specifically to certain grades or 
classes and then these held responsible for proper and decent care. 
Ordinarily those located in the basement rooms are to be used in 
connection with the baths, and possibly gymnasium and athletic 
work. Such a plan prevents congestion, secures privacy with con- 
venience, and, best of all, commands perfect light and easy natural 
ventilation. By arranging them directly over each other plumbing 
is much simplified and construction made easier.

  24 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
Toilet rooms should be narrow, allowing no more space than is 
necessary for legitimate purposes, but with the stalls facing the win- 
dows. This will bring the front of the stalls near to the light, in- 
sure better ventilation, and, if the rooms are faced in such a way as 
to command the sunshine at least a part of the day, will materially 
aid in keeping them acceptable and sanitary. We can not emphasize 
too strongly the necessity of making these rooms as light as it is 
possible to make them. Schoolmen know that when more light is 
turned in not only better sanitary conditions prevail but a better 
moral atmosphere will pervade the whole school. It is really sinful 
to construct a schoolhouse in such a way as to make these rooms dark 
and offer opportunities and suggestions for moral laxness. It has 
already been suggested that these rooms should be narrow for the 
sake of light and sunshine, but in addition, by offering not one foot 
more space than necessary, the opportunity for possible congrega- 
tion will be prevented. This is especially true with reference to boys’ 
toilets. These should be made no larger than legitimate demands 
dictate. 
V. CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT. 
1. FLOORS. 
That part of a school building which receives the roughest usage is 
the floor, and when laid improperly and of poor material is both 
insanitary and very difficult to keep in order. Perhaps there is no 
part of a school building which has so much to do with the general 
sanitation and neatness of halls and classrooms as the floors, and 
surely no part requires so much attention. It is a great mistake to 
be niggardly in expense when it comes to the material for floors, for 
in the end good floors are much less expensive, when considered 
merely from the point of view of length of service, than are poor 
ones; but good floors are also less eee to keep in order and 
will save much janitor service. 
It is proper, then, to ask, What are good floors for school buildings 
and how are they constructed ? 
In the first place there should be, in those buildings not fireproofed, 
double floors. This is important for several reasons, but chiefly to 
prevent the inflow of damp or bad air from basements. The first or 
under set of boards should be rather narrow and well seasoned, but 
may be made of any durable wood and left rough, though of even 
thickness. They shouldbe laid diagonally with the joists and made 
to fit closely. Over these should be carefully fitted some covering 
both impervious to the air and deadening to sound. If no material 
can be obtained combining these two qualities, then both fire proof 
paper and deadening material should be used. Tarred paper is
-P-A-G-E-35
CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT. 25 
effective in keeping out damp air, but its use is questionable on 
account of its inflammability. A good quality of asbestos paper or 
felt, will serve the purpose of deadening and at the same time present 
a fairly good barrier to the entrance of moisture. It is more ex- 
pensive than many other forms of deadening material used, but it 
has the advantage of being noninflammable. In small buildings, 
however, especially for country and village schools, it is far better 
to use heavy building paper than to use nothing at all. Whatever 
. form of deadening material is used, builders ought to use it carefully, 
so as to keep the floor level and stop all the cracks from below. 
Double floors soon save their cost, especially in cold climates and 
where fuel is high. I know of no figures expressing the exact pro- 
portion of this advantage of double floors over single floors, but a 
moment’s thought will suffice to see a distinct saving. 
From the hygienic point of view single floors on the first story of a 
school building ought not to be tolerated, for during the winter sea- 
son—and this is almost always the school season—the children will 
suffer constantly from cold feet. Such a condition is not only annoy- 
ing and distracting to teachers and children alike but fruitful of 
colds and bronchial troubles through the effects of impeded and 
uneven circulation. 
The need of tight, air-proof floors for the first story of a school 
building has been emphasized because of the danger of cold floors, 
bad odors, and dampness. In the upper story the matter of noise is 
especially troublesome unless the floors are thoroughly deadened and 
made so secure as to prevent jarring. The problem of deadening the 
stairways, the floors of the halls, and rooms of the upper story is 
therefore a more insistent one than it is for the lower rooms. 
In buildings thoroughly fireproofed the problem is rather easily 
solved, but.in buildings where wooden joists and steel laths for plas- 
tering are used it is a much more difficult task. There are on the 
market a great many patent. deadening felts or quilts designed for 
this purpose. Some increase the fire risk; others, if free from this 
fault, are not so made as to break up most effectively the sound waves 
and prevent their transmission to the ceiling below. 
The method of deadening shown in figure 3 was designed to meet 
the requirements when the deadening quilt is used. This material is 
made of “cured eel grass” arranged in crisscross layers and then 
spread between two layers of paper which are stitched or quilted 
together. Experience with it shows tliat. it is effective as a sound 
deadener when properly laid. It can be used effectively on inner 
walls, as well as on the floors. Perhaps the safest of all deadening 
material is asbestos board, or quilt, which can be had in most any 
market; but if this is used for deadening purposes chiefly, it must 
be of good heavy grade and carefully laid.

26 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
In this discussion it has not been my purpose to give directions to 
architects, because it is their business to have more extensive knowl- 
edge of such things than other people. The attention of teachers and 
members of building committees should be called to the need of mak- 
ing careful provision for good floors, and then of rendering them as 
impervious as possible to the entrance of cold or foul air and proof 
against the transmission of disturbing noises. 
To some, who are used to conditions as they now exist in our best 
cities, this discussion of the need of double floors may seem out of 
place, or at least useless; but there are hundreds of schoolhouses being 
built this year in our country with single floors. It is to help to 
prevent a continuation of this error that the above was written. 
Finished Flooring 
      
Fic, 3.—Section ef floor, showing the use of deadening quilt. 
In the next place, hardwood should be used for the upper set of 
boards, and so carefully selected that every board will be straight 
grained and free from defect of any sort. One or two slash-grained 
boards in the floor of a hallway or classroom will inevitably bring 
trouble. They splinter easily, gather and hold the dirt, take on a 
different color from the rest. of the floor, and cause that untidy 
“ spotty ” appearance so disturbing to all who are sensitive to seemly 
things wherever found. It is, therefore, quite important that close 
supervision should be exercised over builders when they are laying 
floors. Somebody with authority and good judgment in matters of 
this sort ought to be in constant attendance to pass upon every board 
used. It is far less disastrous to use questionable lumber in wain- 
scoting or walls than to use it in the floors. Floors are sometimes 
rendered unsightly and difficult to keep sanitary when hard pine 
boards, with streaks of pitch or rosin in them, are allowed to go in; 
for as these boards season and shrink this material will gradually 
work out, leaving gashes in the floor hard to keep clean and always 
unsightly. The best material to use is narrow boards of well-sea- 
soned and carefully selected oak. Such boards wear evenly, do not

CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT. oF 
splinter, are not affected greatly by changes in the weather, are 
easily finished, and give to the rooms an esthetic character worth a 
great deal when considered in relation to management and good taste. 
But oak lumber of a good grade has become very expensive, and it 
may not be possible for school authorities to see their way clear to its 
use. Perhaps the next best available wood for schoolhouse floors is 
hard maple, sawn in narrow boards, of straight grain, and free from 
all defects. This makes a neat floor, takes a good polish if skillfully 
handled, and wears well if it is kept well oiled or waxed. It is softer 
than oak, however, and shoe tacks easily dent. it. It requires more 
care than oak floors, and in this respect is not so economical. Jt can 
be made to fit together well, and is not readily affected by dampness, 
though more porous than oak. 
Hard pine is generally the most. available material, and when care- 
fully selected and prepared makes a good, durable, and beautiful 
floor. Since this is the material most often used it seems fitting to 
consider it somewhat carefully. In the first place, the boards ought 
to be from 2 to 24 inches wide. If they are wider it will be almost 
impossible to get them so well seasoned and so carefully joined as 
to prevent cracks from opening between them. They must have a 
straight, close grain, be free from pitch gashes, and sufficiently thick 
to prevent the tongue from splitting the upper edge. 
They must be set carefully and fastened (blind nailed) with cut 
nails. Here again there is constant need of active, vigorous super- 
vision in the laying of schoolroom floors. It is a fact, however 
doleful it may seem, that American workmen are not so careful when 
building for public as for private interests. Doubtless there are 
many exceptions, but experience is on the side of this general asser- 
tion. What would otherwise be a good floor may be badly marred 
and rendered unfit by dents from the hammers of poor workmen 
when they are blind-nailing the boards. Such workmen try to 
excuse themselves by saying that those dents soon close up. Yes, 
they do; but it is with dirt. Surely ceaseless vigilance, unquestioned 
authority, and special knowledge on the part of the supervisor is the 
price of good floors. 
One specification with reference to floors in school buildings is 
frequently omitted from contracts, but is deserving of more consid- 
eration. After floors are laid and all the other work in the room is 
completed they ought to be planed or sandpapered to an even, smooth 
surface. Unless this is done it will be impossible to polish them well 
or to remove the stains incident to building operations. 
In buildings of fireproof construction steel beams are used for 
joists, and usually the space between them is filled with brick and 
cement, or, better, with specially prepared earthen tiles and cement. 
A cheaper method consists in suspending a series of bent wires from  
-P-A-G-E-38
    28 : AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
joist to joist, so they will give strength to the cement, and then boxing 
up underneath and pouring in sufficient cement to: fill the space. 
‘When the cement is set it has a firm grip on joists and wire. Then 
by screwing thin strips of wood on the tops of the joists the floor can 
be easily and securely fastened. Of course it is necessary to fill 
the space with cement flush with the tops of the strips in order that 
the floor may rest evenly and closely against the cement. This will 
effectively deaden the floors and render them thoroughly sanitary 
from the underside. 
Where wooden joists are used the floors may be deadened with 
fair success and a complete double floor rendered unnecessary by the 
method illustrated in Figure 4. 
This treatment reduces the risk from fire, but is more expensive 
than double floors with deadening materials and adds materially to 
the weight of the building. Doubtless many other ways can be de- 
  Tra. 4.—-Floor with wooden joists and a thin layer of cement. 
vised to deaden the floors more satisfactory to local demands than 
any here mentioned. 
In buildings of fireproof construction a single floor is sufficient, 
for the materials used in fireproofing both deaden the floors and pro- 
tect. them from the cold air from below. 
There is a growing tendency because of the increasing cost. of 
wooden floors to substitute cement floors. But generally speaking, 
it is the writer’s opinion that those who are specifying these and ac- 
cepting them do not realize that cement, even though of the best 
grade, will not last so long as a well-cared-for hardwood floor prop- 
erly set. 
The proper method of caring for wooden floors is of comparative 
recent date, and we can look forward to longer usefulness in modern 
buildings for wooden floors than in the older buildings. If floors are 
scrubbed and soaked week after week with dirty water, we, of course, 
may expect rapid destruction of them; but. if carefully waxed and 
oiled and cleaned with care we can expect longer wear from them 
than we can from any cement at present. available. 
If he who reads this statement is still in doubt, let him study stair- 
way treads where slate, cement, and wooden steps have been used, 
and then compare those that have been properly cared for. He will 
be surprised at the lasting qualities of good wood.  
-P-A-G-E-39
  
  
CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT. 29 
But even if it should happed that cement floors will last longer, 
they are never so satisfactory nor so easily kept clean as wooden — 
floors. Constant waiting over them will loosen the particles of sand 
and cement and these will be swept out day by day. 
On the whole, it is a mistake at present. to put cement floors in 
classrooms, but halls, lavatories, and basement rooms, especially the 
latter, may be better off with cement. 
The so-called dustless oil floor dressing has, when used with skill 
and judgment, proved of great service in protecting floors and pre- 
venting the dust. and dirt from rising into the air. It is best to put 
it on sparingly, however, to prevent any possible odors, and more 
especially to prevent it from soiling clothing. A great deal of com- 
plaint is frequently heard on account of this, and not infrequently 
such complaint is justifiable, for there is no need to keep the floors 
saturated with oil to get the best effect. This trouble sometimes re- 
sults from the use of an oil too thick and heavy, but usually from 
using it too often or applying too much at one time. When a thin 
coating of light oil is put on with a brush or better with a spray, 
made for this purpose, and all pellets of dust and dirt collected by 
this oil are removed from the floors daily, there ought to be little or 
no complaint from those teachers who value the cleanliness and 
healthfulness of the schoolroom more than their own convenience or 
personal preference. 
In high schools where pupils are more careful to keep their shoes 
clean, and especially in those buildings where good hardwood floors 
are laid, it is best to wax the floors and keep them well polished. 
_ This method, of course, does not prevent so much dust from rising, 
and it requires more service to keep the floors in good condition; but 
with the use of dampened sawdust to gather up the dust when 
sweeping, and with due care, a waxed floor is most satisfactory. 
There are several kinds of dustless oils on the market, and also 
many varieties of floor wax.t_ No general recommendation is needed, 
and indeed none could be made which would be found reliable under 
‘all conditions, for the different woods used for floors will need 
different treatment. 
The floors of toilet rooms should be made of some impervious 
material, preferably tiles or terrazzo. This will enable them to be

washed out frequently or mopped up without much trouble. We have 
* found that the only way to keep toilet floors neat. and tidy and free 
from the odors due to infiltration is to make them right to start on 
and then keep them clean and sanitary under all conditions. A 
school superintendent who will permit school toilets to become in- 
decent and insanitary, and at the same time make a show of esthetics 
elsewhere, is deluding himself into thinking that partially hidden 
ugliness will be overlooked by the children. 
Some insurance companies have objected to the use of floor oils, on 
the ground that buildings so treated have a greater fire hazard, and 
they have brought pressure to bear on many boards of education to 
prevent their use. This restriction is mere theory and reliable 
statistics are not available to prove it. On the contrary, it seems to 
the writer that there is about as much evidence for the use of oil 
as against it to prevent fire. In the first place, without some such 
treatment floors soon splinter, open cracks get abnormally dry, and 
wear through much more quickly. Besides fires do not start on 
schoolroom floors except where defective stoves are used and the 
floor left unguarded. If a fire gets such headway from a basement 
or furnace room as to come into classrooms or halls, then the build- 
ing is probably doomed anyway. Some experimentation, though it 
was inconclusive, has caused the writer to feel that dry floors are 
. more inflammable than those properly oiled. q 
The floors of halls in high-school buildings are subject to more 
wear than are those of the classrooms, and therefore require more 
care and deserve more consideration in their construction. There is 
a growing tendency to make the floors of halls of light-colored tiles 
set in a strong base of cement, or to embed in cement broken bits of 
marble of various colors and then to polish them to an even surface. 
Some modern buildings in this country have used plain cement. 
There are many things to be said in favor of tile floors. In the first 
place they can be made durable, they are readily cleaned, non- 
absorbent, and render the hall lighter and more cheery than wood 
or any darker material. Tiles, however, are cold, but since halls are 
to be used chiefly for those who are passing to their rooms or from 
room to room, there can be little fault found on this account. Per- 
haps the most serious objections which can be offered to their use are 
that they are expensive and noisy. Good oak floors properly cared 
for will last a long time, and they are very effective when kept clean 
and well polished. But they require a great deal of attention, and 
in the end are perhaps more expensive than tile floors. If hard pine 
or maple is used, the precautions mentioned under the section on 
“Floors” ought to be kept in mind.

2. STAIRWAYS. 
The stairways should be of fireproof construction, especially in a 
wooden building. The prevailing custom is to make wooden stairs 
in wooden buildings, and more resistant stairs in stone, brick, or 
cement buildings. A moment’s thought is sufficient to show that in 
this regard wooden buildings need greater care in the construction 
of stairs than buildings of more resistant materials. 
It is in no sense unreasonable to insist on fireproof stairs in all 
large two-story buildings, especially now that the material is within 
reach of all. Steel frames incased in cement, and with treads made 
of the same material render stairways reasonably safe against fires 
and also insure much greater permanency. The width of a stairway 
will of course depend in part on the number of students it is designed 
to accommodate; but in all cases it should be wide enough for two 
adults to ascend or descend abreast without crowding. In large 
schools there should be room for three adults on the same tread at 
once. In general, 54 to 6 feet in width will give plenty of room. 
The height of the riser should not exceed 64 inches, and the width 
of the tread be not less than 10 inches in the clear; 12 inches is 
better. There should be a rectangular landing approximately half 
way up, and this should be in width nearly double the length of the 
tread. Such a width will help to prevent blockades in case of fire 
and will insure better light on the stairs. It may be said here in 
passing that the habit of decorating this landing with potted plants, 
box seats, etc., needs questioning. If plants can be placed safely out 
of the way, there can be no objection offered. Some day we may have 
enough faith in the value of art and enough artists in our country to 
decorate the walls above these landings as well as in the hallways 
with mural paintings of a worthy sort, and then they will not seem 
so bare and cheerless. 
Much has been written on the question of whether or not stairways 
should be boxed in or finished with open work, surmounted with a 
handrail. Those favoring the former method have cited instances 
where children have fallen over and received serious injuries where 
open balustrades have been used. But the danger from this sort of 
construction seems very slight, indeed, where due care is taken to 
make these high enough and sufficiently strong. The most objection- 
able feature of the open balustrade along stairways is the fact that 
in mixed schools they do not sufficiently shield the girls, as they 
ascend, from exposure to the view of those on the lower half of the 
stairs. At the high-school age, girls still wear short skirts, and in 
mixed schools, stairways thus constructed furnish opportunities 
which may be very objectionable. On the other hand, the boxed-in 
stairway is much darker and sometimes less acceptable from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
    82 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
standpoint of appearance. It therefore seems wise in building for 
mixed schools to recommend a. balustrade with the lower part solid 
and the upper part more open. 
Our best school architects are consistently specifying solid 
balustrades and also placing two or three metal ornaments of simple 
design on the rails to prevent pupils from attempting to s.iide down 
them, and there can be little serious objection to them. 
When stair treads are made of cement, the corners next the risers 
ought to be left rounded instead of square, in order to facilitate 
keeping them clean. Dirt caught in rectangular corners is hard to 
remove and by reason of this fact is often left undisturbed. Where 
wooden stairs are used a triangular piece of tin made to fit the corners 
closely, saves much work in sweeping and gives better results in clean- 
liness, It is a wise procedure, in the construction of fireproof stair- 
ways, to use the very best cement obtainable, so that the treads may 
resist wear, stand level or nearly so, and especially to render the ex- 
posed edges strong and nonslippery. Handrails are needed on the 
wall side as well as along the outer side. These, however, should not 
extend more than 3 or 4 inches from the wall, and should be at least 
3 feet above the treads. They are often too low to offer satisfactory 
assistance in going down the stairs, and there is far more need for 
them in descending than there is in ascending a stairway. 
The short flight of steps through the main entrance to the first 
floor needs to be wider than those in the stairways proper, and can 
be constructed of stone or cement. The back stairways leading 
from the first floor to the basement can be more safely placed near 
the center of the building, for they are not likely to be used in case 
of fire. 
3. BLACKBOARDS. 
Nowhere in the world are blackboards used so extensively in 
schools as they are in America. They are essentially democratic 
and individual in their service, as contrasted with their use in 
countries where the teacher rules and guides with autocratic author- 
ity, and is the source of a large part of the information given to the 
pupils. A large area of wall space set apart in classrooms for black- 
boards assumes that pupils will individually present to their fellow 
classmates and to the teacher the results of their study, so that 
the free give-and-take of criticism will result in an independent, self- 
helpful assurance necessary to all good citizenship in our form of 
government. Blackboards are, then, not merely pedagogical con- 
yveniences but civic agencies worthy of consideration. 
The history of blackboards is an interesting one, but for obvious 
reasons it would be irrelevant to recount it here. Suffice it to say, 
however, that they were used in Europe more than three centuries  
-P-A-G-E-43
  
  CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT. 33 
before they found their way into the schools of America. They were 
not introduced into our schools until the first or second decade of the 
last century, and were then merely blackened boards as the name 
indicates. 
In the planning of school buildings, it is a matter of much im- 
portance not only to provide sufficient room for blackboards but to so 
place them with reference to the light that they will offer the fewest 
possible disturbances to vision. If the form of classrooms else- 
where recommended is chosen, the unused appropriate wall space 
in the back of the room, on the side opposite the windows and at the 
teacher’s end of the room, should be prepared for blackboards. This 
will give approximately 60 linear feet of wall surface for this use. 
No blackboards should ever be placed on the same side of the room 
as the windows, and particularly between windows. To those who 
can recall the tiresome and painful effects of trying to see any 
work placed on a blackboard situated between windows, no argument — 
will be needed to prove the wisdom of this prohibition. But there 
are still some school authorities who permit such a mistake, and to 
such as these it may be said that when the eye is adjusted to 
an object reflecting one strength of light it is out of adjustment 
for others reflecting either greater or less light. When a blackboard 
is situated between windows and a pupil at his desk undertakes to 
read any work written on this board, he must of necessity receive 
the light of the windows directly in his eyes. Such light being far 
stronger than that reflected from the written work on the board, his 
eyes automatically adjust themselves to the strong light, and hence 
he must either squint or strain, the muscles of accommodation to 
see at all clearly. The evil effects of these eyestrains and malad- 
justments are too obvious to need further discussion. So a black- 
board should never be put between the windows in a system of 
unilateral lighing. 
Taking for granted, then, that the proper portions of the walls 
“have been prepared for blackboards, he high above the floor should 
the lower parts of the boards be set? Plainly the answer will be this: 
They should be so placed as to give the children the use of the great- 
est amount of blackboard room while standing erect, or nearly so. 
In rooms designed to accommodate pupils of the first and second 
grades of tha elementary schools the bottoms of the blackboards 
should not be more than 26 inches above the floor. For third and 
fourth grades, they can be set 27 inches; for the fifth and sixth 
grades, 30 inches; for the seventh and eighth grades, 34 inches. If 
these figures are followed for setting blackboards in rooms designed 
for elementary-school purposes they will not be far from the exact 
height required by the pupils, Of course some very tall pupils in  
-P-A-G-E-44
  84 AMERIOAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
the primary grades or some very short ones higher up may be some- 
what troubled. It is necessary for architects to specify clearly these 
limits, or some closely approximating limits, else builders, when 
figuring on wainscoting or cutting it, will overlook these matters 
and set the boards too high for the primary classes. For rooms 
designed for high-school classes the distance between the floor and 
the blackboards should be not less than 3 feet. In rooms designed 
especially for classes in language or literature they can be put 2 
inches higher with good effect, for while a student can make fairly 
good figures lower than this, he can not write well below this level. 
At the teacher's end of the room it is best to raise the blackboard at 
least 42 inches above the floor, for this board will be used chiefly by 
the teacher to indicate lessons and other general directions, and any 
point lower than this will not be easily seen by the students seated in 
the middle or rear of the room. 
The next question for the architect to consider will be the width of 
the blackboards. On this point it may be said that not 1 square foot 
more of blackboard material should be placed in aschoolroom than is 
really needed. The reasons for this caution are these: Good black- 
board material is expensive, and hence it would be a waste of money 
to put in more than is necessary. But a more important reason lies 
in the fact that blackboards absorb, under certain conditions, nearly, 
if not quite, 50 per cent of the light that strikes them. Since they 
are, for the most part, placed near those pupils who are farthest from 
the windows and who can least afford to lose the absorbed light, it is 
plain that no more blackened surface should be placed on the walls 
than real need demands. This is important. Where classrooms 
must be arranged to suit several grades of children, as is usual in 
village and consolidated rural schools, the blackboard 28 inches wide 
will be ample for the first, second, and third grades, for the fourth, 
fifth, and sixth, 32 inches, for the seventh and eighth, 3 feet. In 
high schools, especially in rooms designed for mathematics and art 
work, boards should be 40 inches wide. : 
Some recent thoroughgoing, but as yet unpublished, investigations 
which were made under the direction of the author by Miss Rainey, 
then a graduate student in Peabody College for Teachers, definitely 
determined that a blackboard 3 feet wide set at the proper height 
furnishes all the surface children actually use in regular school 
work. So we feel certain that architects can save and vision be 
conserved by specifying accordingly. 
The next point to consider and one of prime importance is the 
material to be used for blackboards. Wood is no longer advisable, 
and no discussion of this seems necessary. 
A fairly good blackboard can be made by using a good quality 
of cement thoroughly colored with some dull black material and so
-P-A-G-E-45
  CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT. 85 
securely plastered to metal lath on the walls that no hollow sound 
will be heard when the chalk is being used. This difficulty can be 
overcome by constructing a solid, even backing of wood for the lath. 
Care must be taken, however, to prevent the expansion in such a 
backing from cracking the cement after it begins to set, for the 
moisture absorbed by the wood will cause it to expand. If the inner 
walls are made of brick or cement, no such difficulty will arise. The 
cement must. be put on evenly, the surface finished as smoothly as 
pure cement can make it, and colored with great care. <A slight tinge 
of dark green mixed with the black will be acceptable. One chief 
difficulty in the use of cement for this purpose is the fact that it must 
be put on quickly after being mixed and usually not enough can be 
mixed at.one time to finish a room. As a result of two or more sepa- 
rate mixtures, there is liable to be slight differences in color which 
will be noticeable when it is dry. Of course this difficulty may be 
overcome when several workmen cooperate. There is danger, too, 
that after a time the coloring matter will fade or leach out when the 
board is washed. A cement board is likely to be harsh at. first. and 
therefore to cut the crayon too freely. There are a number of 
patented mixtures using cement as the chief ingredient and all of 
these are open to these objections. It makes a comparatively in- 
expensive board, but should not be used in first-class school buildings. 
It is hard to keep clean, and will not last so long as slate or glass, 
and glosses easily. 
Slate of a dull black color when cut in large slabs, carefully and 
evenly set, is perhaps the best material now readily available in this 
country. It is expensive, but will last indefinitely and with reason- 
able care can be kept comparatively free from the dirt and oil 
gathered from the hands of the pupils. The most. serious objections 
to slate are these: It is noisy and the joints never fit very closely and 
evenly. This latter defect often causes the eraser to catch and this 
often knocks it out of the hand of the pupil. This is not only trouble- 
some to the worker, but it will throw a good deal of crayon dust 
into the air. Unless slate boards are set and fastened firmly to the 
wall, they will warp and render these joints still more troublesome. 
There are on the market several kinds of blackboards made of 
paper, paper-like material, or wood pulp rolled and pressed into 
sheets of any reasonable length. They can be colored to suit, and, 
when well set, are for a time fairly satisfactory. The main troubles 
with these are they absorb water when washed or during damp 
weather, become oily, and in time buckle and chip. Experience with 
them indicates that they will not stand hard usage very long and 
soon become dangerously glossy. It is not advisable to use such 
material in the best school buildings. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  
  86 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
In England the best blackboards are made of glass. A sheet of 
glass of good quality and thickness is slightly but evenly ground on 
one side. The reverse side is painted the color desired, and when dry 
is firmly set with the ground side out. The color shows through so 
as to seem to be on the surface, while the roughness caused by the 
grinding cuts the crayon and thus leaves a clear white mark on a 
black background. It is very necessary that the grinding agent does 
not cut too deep and leave the surface too rough, for glass cuts the 
crayon freely and would, under this condition, introduce the diffi- 
culty of an undue amount of crayon dust, which, as every teacher 
knows, is irritating and harmful when breathed. 
The great advantages of glass boards are obvious. They are easily 
cleaned, do not absorb moisture or oil from the hands, do not warp or 
buckle, last. indefinitely—indeed they improve with use—and can be 
made to fit at the joints more perfectly than slate. They are not used 
to any extent in this country, but in many respects they are superior 
to slate, and in time will be used more extensively. 
There are a number of other forms of boards, but slate or glass 
are the best, and in the long run are most economical. Of these 
glass is to be preferred. When this can not be obtained, slate should 
be chosen for all good buildings. 
Since the first edition of this bulletin was printed glass blackboards 
have been used in a number of buildings in the Eastern States, but 
so far as can be learned have not been uniformly satisfactory. This 
was due to the fact that the glass was ground too coarsely and was 
in part poorly set. It is plain that the glass blackboard has not 
made much progress in this country and will not do so unless greater 
care is taken in its manufacture. At present the best advice to give 
is that which will dictate the use of a good quality of black slate. 
4. DOORS. 
Whether laws require it or not, no schoolhouse should be con- 
structed with outside doors set to swing in. In many States there are 
laws now in force commanding outward swinging doors in all public 
buildings, including schoolhouses. Furthermore, some recent dis- 
asters, notably the one in Ohio, emphasize the necessity of so fas- 
tening outside doors that they may be easily thrown open from the 
inside. In the past few years patents have been issued for fasten- 
ings which render the door secure from the outside, although it will 
open readily at an 8 or 10 pound pressure from within. These 
make it possible to keep the building locked during school hours so 
as to prevent intruders and thieves from entering, yet in no way 
endanger the children in case of fire, for a small child can push 
them open. Recent surveys of school buildings in a number of
-P-A-G-E-47
CONSTRUCTION. AND EQUIPMENT. 37 
cities in various parts of the country have revealed the fact that 
these safety devices have been poorly constructed and are frequently 
ineffective in preventing doors from being opened from without by 
intruders. Architects and contractors should be cautioned against 
specifying and using such devices unless they can be so set as to 
insure permanency and reliability. Theoretically they meet the 
needs, but practically they have not always been satisfactory. 
The style of interior doors deserves some attention from the point 
of view of beauty and cleanliness. The ordinary stock paneled 
doors are not at all satisfactory. They shrink a good deal, catch 
the dust on the ledge supporting the panels, and are often easily 
split. The best doors are smooth on both sides from bottom to top, 
and built up of different layers of wood glued together, with the 
grain of the core and the outside running at right angles. The cen- 
tral or inner layer can be constructed of light, well-seasoned pine 
or poplar boards, tongued and grooved and thoroughly glued to- 
gether, and running crosswise. Over these a veneer of wood, selected 
to match the finish of the rooms and halls and set vertically to the 
floor, is carefully fastened and glued to the core. This gives a com- 
paratively light door, which will not easily warp or split. Such a 
door is readily kept clean and when properly finished is really more 
attractive than the regulation paneled door. These are not theoret- 
ical doors, but they are used in some of the best school buildings of 
the country. 
In this connection protest should be made against the use of the 
so-called “ carpet” strip, or threshold strip, so frequently put under 
inside doors to insure them swinging clear of the floor. These strips 
may and do have a reason for being in a home where carpets or rugs 
are spread over the floor in front of doors, but they are in the way, 
and serve no necessary purpose in the school building. They catch 
dust, make it hard to sweep or brush the floor, and in addition are 
stumbling blocks to the children. A level floor offers no impediment 
to a door set vertically and secured by strong hinges. 
It is of course necessary to set a door slightly above the floor, so 
it will not drag when opened; but if the floor is carefully laid, the 
door frames vertically set, and the door solidly hung there will be 
no trouble. It is a great relief to get rid of the “ carpet” strip for 
the sake of cleanliness, and the floor and room present a much neater 
appearance without it. 
Save in those instances where it is necessary to transmit light to 
halls or inner rooms, it is a mistake to put glass in schoolroom 
doors or above them. A schoolroom needs privacy in order that the 
teacher and the children may do the most effective work. Besides, 
even if the glass be frosted or ground so as to render it merely trans-  
-P-A-G-E-48
  88 ‘ AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
lucent, a gust of wind or a bump from passing students may break 
it. Experience with such doors warrants advice against their use. 
A good many superintendents and principals, however, insist 
that it is helpful to have a simple pane of glass set high in the 
door so that they may in passing get a glimpse of classroom condi- 
tions without in any way disturbing the class and with the least pos- 
sible loss of time. But, generally speaking, such observations are not 
of much use and at times may be misleading. Then, too, it is more 
than likely that passers-by will disturb the children unnecessarily 
and even unintentionally. 
Transoms serve no purpose save that of offering some little aid in 
very hot weather by permitting a draft from the room into the hall. 
Transoms rarely fit closely and at the same time work with sufficient 
ease to make it possible to use them when needed. With the plenum 
system of ventilation they are troublesome, because of the leakage 
from the room. They are often neglected, and hence usually dirty. 
They furnish a ledge for the accumulation of dust and cobwebs, and 
thus often give a room an untidy appearance. It is better in general 
to dispense with all transoms, for they are more trouble than they 
are worth and waste much money in construction. 
For the purposes of cross ventilation it is much better to insert 
breeze windows above the blackboards, as described elsewhere in this 
bulletin, than to depend on transoms over doors; for breeze windows 
when properly constructed are better placed and large enough to 
serve for effective ventilation. 
5. WINDOWS AND SCREENS. 
Of late years a great variety of window sashes has been devised 
in the attempt to give better illumination and easier methods of 
ventilation. In an investigation of the San Francisco school build- 
ings, a dozen varieties at least were found in the newer types of 
buildings. Some were pivoted in the center both top and bottom, 
others at the sides, others were divided into sections and each section 
pivoted, and still others so constructed as to open outward or inward 
in various ways, all with the idea of. opening a greater space for 
ventilation than could be done with the ordinary double hung win- 
dow. But almost without exception it was discovered that these 
hinged or pivoted types were giving a good deal of trouble and many 
of them were so hard to handle that it was practically impossible 
for the teachers to manage them. 
In cases of storms such sashes are likely to blow open, damage the 
building or occasionally injure a child. Experience shows that the 
best and safest type is the old-fashioned double hung window. 
Teachers know how to operate this kind of window and will gen-

CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT. 89 
erally do so, and, while it at best only permits half of the window 
space to be open at one time, it gives far less trouble, frequently 
costs much less, and is more practical. With this type it is easy to 
screen windows, while with the hinged or pivoted type it is fre- 
quently impossible. Theoretically these newer windows are very 
promising, but experience has proven that they are many times quite 
troublesome and unsatisfactory. 
Again, let me insist on rectangular-topped windows that may be 
opened easily and readily rather than those fancy arched types set 
transom fashion. The latter obstruct the light and are open to the 
same objection in part as the hinged windows above described. 
Here, as frequently occurs, the simplest thing is the best. Heavy 
strong sashes should be specified for windows, and the glazing should 
be with comparatively small sizes of glass. Heavy sashes are needed 
because of the size of the windows and also because they will give 
ample contacts for the putty. A great deal of trouble has arisen in 
recent years because of the falling off of the putty, thereby exposing 
the glass to breakage and the sashes to rapid weathering. It seems 
that a very poor quality of putty is being used or it has not been 
put on properly. While this may seem a matter of small moment, 
it is worth attention because of the many troubles that grow out of it. 
This is especially important in the hotter and dryer regions of the 
South and Southwest. In colder climates all classroom windows 
should be provided with air deflectors so that the lower sashes can 
be opened without a resulting draft of outside air upon the pupils. 
These deflectors should be so constructed as to interfere as little as 
possible with the admission of light. 
PLATFORMS. 
There is no need in an ordinary schoolroom for a teacher’s plat- 
form or rostrum. To many this statement may seem to be nonsense. 
But stop to think a minute. They are always in the way, they are 
hard to keep clean, they are rarely in the right place, and even when 
not fastened to the floor, they are too heavy to move easily. They 
are remnants from medieval days, when schools were dominated by 
the church, when monks were teachers, and when the work of the 
school consisted in listening to lectures and copying verbatim what 
was said. To-day the teacher, with books and helps of all sorts, 
merely guides, directs, inspires, and amplifies. In the primary grades 
more direction and help are needed, but they are given usually at 
the desk of the pupil or at the blackboard. But the teacher to whom 
this will seem an invasion will object, saying: “ But how can I see 
my pupils when I am seated on the same level with them?” The 
93146°—25——4
-P-A-G-E-50
40 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
best answer to this, and the only one that will convince, is this: 
“Try it and see.” Another will remark, “It will take away the 
teacher’s dignity.” Well, if dignity is a matter of platform, then 
it is well to get rid of it. A teacher can not have too much true 
dignity, but this sort comes from within, and exhibits itself in wis- 
dom, judgment, understanding, and genuine sympathetic help. Plat- 
forms and silken robes are for those who cling to customs belonging 
to previous centuries. 
A. good teacher has no need to spy on children, for the more they 
can work together the better the result. A neat table or desk and a 
simple chair is all the pulpit a regular classroom needs. Then 
almost the whole front of the room is free for workers and for such 
apparatus as the day’s work will demand. Of course in science lec- 
ture rooms and in assembly rooms platforms and stages are needed. 
If you have never taught in a room without a platform, you will find 
much relief, especially in grammar-grade work. Your room will be 
neater and the space for moving about much less obstructed. 
The foregoing was written more than 10 years ago, and while 
there has been a great lessening in these impedimenta, many new 
buildings are still being supplied with them. 
As we have elsewhere stated another elimination from classrooms 
ought to be urged in this connection, and that is the “carpet strip” 
beneath the doors. If the floor from the hall is continuous through 
the door, and the door set to swing just clear of the floor, there is 
much relief from dirt, stumblings, and noise where nothing obstructs 
the entrance. It is good school hygiene to eliminate all that is 
useless both in building and in the program. 
6. CLASSROOM FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT. 
Strictly speaking no discussion of classroom equipment and fur- 
niture is necessary here, but because of its indirect effect upon the 
building, attention should be called to a new kind of school desk 
which has been devised since the former bulletin was written. I 
refer to an adjustable and movable chair-desk, which can be placed 
at any part of the room, or taken from room to room without trouble. 
Whenever it is possible boards of education and architect should 
consider together the question of school furniture. Boards of edu- 
cation should be guided by the advice of those who have technical 
knowledge of such problems. 
A fixed case or cabinet is necessary for each classroom, where books 
and material may be kept safely and out of the dirt and dust. A 
comparatively small but neat table, with a comfortable chair, should 
be provided for the teacher in each room.
-P-A-G-E-51
LIGHTING. 41 
VI. LIGHTING. 
It is safe to say that the demands made on the eyes of school chil- 
dren are greater now than at any previous time in the history of 
education, and therefore whatever can be done in the way of furnish- 
ing better light for owr schoolrooms will serve to make school work 
less fatiguing and indirectly more interesting. And it must ever be 
held in mind that the problems of lighting, heating, and ventilating 
schoolrooms are far more complex and difficult than those connected 
with lighting, heating, and ventilating a living room at home. But 
it seems that this is a very difficult thing to learn, both for teachers 
and school officers. If children could be allowed the same freedom at 
school that they are allowed at home, and if they could have the same 
average amount of space at school that they have at home, then 
many of the suggestions offered here would be out of place. But at 
present, when a teacher must manage, direct, and teach from 40 to 50 
children in a room so small as to afford in many cases less than 15 
square feet of floor space per pupil, many difficulties are of necessity 
introduced. It requires persistent reiteration and striking objective 
illustrations of this difference between home and school conditions to 
bring teachers to act accordingly. The habits they have formed in 
their homes in these particulars must be overcome before they can be 
trusted to be careful of these things in their schoolrooms. 
The problems connected with the proper lighting of schoolrooms 
vary to some degree in different parts of our country. California 
and all of the States of the Southwest enjoy more sunny days, and 
hence get more regular and continuous bright light than any of 
the Eastern or Northern States. Besides, in this same region the 
air is often freer from dust and smoke than it is farther north and 
east, and this renders both the direct and indirect light unusually 
strong. During several months of the year*the landscape in the 
Southwest presents a wide expanse of browns somewhat dazzling to 
the eyes as it reflects the bright rays of the sun. To the north and 
northeast both the quality and quantity of the light is affected by the 
dazzling snows of winter or, in some places, the shades of summer. 
Taking all of these things into consideration, it is impossible to for- 
mulate rules which will apply equally well in all parts of our coun- 
try. Most writers on this subject have, however, neglected to take 
into account these varying conditions, and have stated their rules and 
principles as if they could be universally applied, and school authori- 
ties who have tried to follow such directions without seeking ad- 
vice concerning local conditions have, in many instances, made seri- 
ous blunders. 
In the northern part of our country where, during the winter 
season, twilight begins comparatively early in the afternoon, where
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
the shadows are long at noontime, and where cloudy, dark days are 
of frequent occurrence, it is often necessary to require for each class- 
room an amount of window surface equal to one-fourth of the area 
of the floor. In the Southwest it will be perfectly safe to limit the 
total area of the windows to one-sixth of the floor space. It must be 
understood, however, that these rules will hold good only in those 
cases where the windows are properly placed and where rooms are 
of the proper shape and proportion. Furthermore, it is necessary 
for architects and builders to remember that these figures do not 
represent the combined space inside the window frames, but the 
actual glass surface through which the light can enter unhindered. 
A schoolhouse should be so constructed and so placed on the lot as 
to admit into the classrooms the early morning sunshine or that of 
the later afternoon. In the latitude of our country, schoolrooms 
should never be lighted by windows facing to the south. If windows 
open into a classroom from the south, despite all that can be done 
with ordinary shades or blinds, bright rays of the sun will find their 
way into the room during the busiest part of the day and will in- 
evitably dazzle and disturb the eyes of the children as well as those 
of the teacher. It will prove a mistake in nearly every instance to 
say that the teacher can so regulate the shades as to prevent all such 
troubles. If we were to grant that double shades can be regulated 
so as to shut out the direct rays of the sun, the fact still remains that 
very often busy teachers will neglect to regulate them properly, and 
consequently harm will result. During many years of observation 
on this point I have yet to see a single classroom properly lighted 
when depending on light from south windows. 
While speaking on this point, though addressing his thought to 
the teachers of Germany, and, of course, to the conditions of German 
climate, Professor Foster, of Breslau, has said: 
No curtains have yet been invented which will keep back the direct rays of 
the sun and at the same time let the diffused light of the clear sky pass through. 
Ground glass has been recommended, but it is too dazzling and blinding in the 
direct rays of the sun, and during cloudy days it intercepts too much of the 
light. 
Since the words here quoted were written many attempts have been 
made to solve the difficulties mentioned by the invention and manu- 
facture of many kinds of shades, but we have yet to see a shade, 
whether green or gray, buff or blue, which, if satisfactory when ex- 
posed to the midday rays of bright sunshine, did not prove unsuit- 
able during the earlier and later periods of the school day. Some 
one may say, however, that the teacher must adjust the shades as the 
conditions change during the day. But teachers do not adjust and 
can not be trusted to adjust the shades so as to maintain a regular 
light when windows open to the south.  
-P-A-G-E-53
LIGHTING. 43 
But if it is difficult to use shades to regulate properly a south 
light it is more difficult and, let us say, almost wholly impossible to 
do so with the common shutters or slat blinds. I have found that 
even when these are new and all of the slats are in place, just as 
with the shades, they are very frequently neglected and therefore 
dangerous; but the difficulty is especially great when, after a short 
time, all the slats do not close equally tight. Through the chinks 
thus afforded pencils of light stream in, producing that peculiar 
painful adjustment of the eyes which not only induces undue fatigue 
of the eye muscles but also distracts the attention and annoys the 
child into a restless and careless mood. So the plain advice to give 
here is, do not construct your schoolhouse in such a way that windows 
will open from any classroom toward the south, for it is impossible 
to light the room properly in this way. 
As a result of a year of scientific experimentation, conducted by 
Robert H. Southerland, the following results with reference to the 
proper orientation of school buildings were obtained :? 
It was found that if a classroom faced toward the northeast there 
were only 165 desk hours of sunlight interference, while if it faced 
to the east 1,336, to the southeast. 2,458, to the south 2,885, toward 
the southwest 2,190, and toward the west 828 desk hours of sunlight 
interference. By desk hours is here meant that direct sunshine will 
fall on the top of the desk during school hours, making it disagreeable 
and unhygienic from the point of view of vision to be so exposed. 
This means that if the windows of a classroom face toward the north- 
east there will be little interference as well as very little sunshine; if 
toward the east the classroom will be subjected,to a complete sunning 
before school begins and we will have to shield the desks for about an 
hour or an hour and a half to prevent direct sunlight from inter- 
fering. After 11 o’clock there will be no further interference during 
the rest of the day and shades may be pulled up and the entire win- 
dow used for proper lighting. When the windows face toward the 
southeast during most of the winter months, the whole classroom 
will be interfered with until about 2 o’clock in the afternoon. With 
the windows facing south during every clear day in the wintertime. 
even as far south as Nashville, shades must be drawn to protect 
the children on the first rows near the windows. In so doing, those 
farther removed from the windows are handicapped by lack of 
light. Furthermore, the sun does not pass far beyond the center 
of the room at any time, and while those near the windows are 
bothered all day long, there is no direct. sunshine on the north side 
of the classroom. Southwest exposure brings difficulty all the after-

noon, really beginning before 12 o’clock. It gives much greater in- 
terference than the west light, and at the same time does not purify 
the room as a whole so completely. 
From the figures given it will be seen that there are far fewer 
hours of interference from the west than any other orientation. This 
is due to the fact that schools are out from 2.30 to 3.80 o’clock, 
giving only about an hour or an hour and a half of actual trouble. 
Naturally there were two questions to be considered in this in- 
vestigation, namely, how to get maximum sunshine in the classroom 
with the least interference by direct sunshine on the desks. By maxi- 
mum sunshine is meant the maximum amount of space thoroughly 
sunned during the day. It is not a question of supplying heat, 
but a question of purification and direct sunlight interference, for 
in the first place we get the maximum space of a classroom swept 
by direct sunlight when windows face toward the east or west. 
We get the minimum space purified by direct sunlight when windows 
face toward the south, but likewise the maximum amount of inter- 
ference, ‘This interference must be considered of great importance, 
for shades must be drawn to protect the children from the dazzling 
light upon their desks, while, at the same time, other children 
will be deprived of sufficient light, and ventilation will be interfered 
with because the windows are thus covered with shades. 
Taking these two sets of data into consideration, it was found 
that the best sanitation and least interference from direct sunshine 
was obtained when the classrooms faced either east or west. And 
as I am able to state without hesitation that the best orientation for 
classrooms is toward’the east and west, this fact has been estab- 
lished beyond mere opinion. 
Southeast and southwest exposures are especially to be avoided. 
The windows should be placed in one side of the room only, and 
preferably on the east side in the buildings of one room. They should 
be placed on one side so as to avoid cross lights and prevent the 
children from writing in the shadows of their own hands. The eyes 
of any pupil in the room will thus be relieved of the necessity of 
attempting to adjust themselves to unequal sources of light. Even 
as simple and as plain a necessity as unilateral lighting for school- 
rooms is not understood by many who know naught of school condi- 
tions. A physician recently rebuked me for recommending this 
method of placing the windows, for he said that he believed it would 
be a very serious thing to thus compel the children to use only one 
eye in their work. 
With unilateral lighting it is far easier to arrange for adequate 
blackboard space and to place it opposite the light, as it should be, 
than in any method of construction admitting light from both sides.
-P-A-G-E-55
  LIGHTING. 45 
Furthermore, in large buildings it is practicaily impossible to plan 
for windows on more than one side on account of the necessary hall- 
ways and adjoining rooms. 
The windows should be placed as closely together as safety of con- 
struction will permit, and well toward the rear of the room—that is, 
the windows ought to be located so as to be as far as possible to the 
rear as well as to the left of the pupils when seated at their desks. 
To make this arrangement of the windows possible, it is necessay ~ 
to determine, before they are placed, the direction toward which the 
pupils will face. This will be more easily understood by referring to 
the drawing showing the proper position of desks and windows. 
(Fig. 2.) Pupils should receive the light from the left in order that 
when writing the shadow of the right hand will not fall directly on 
the point where the pen touches the paper. It follows, therefore, 
that if there be any pupils who use the left hand in writing or draw- 
ing, special provisions should be made for them so that they may sit 
with the right side to the light. If the majority of pupils were left- 
handed, plainly the advice should be given to construct the rooms so 
as to have the windows to the rear and on the right side. 
It has been said that the windows should be placed on one side 
only, and preferably toward the east. The last statement in this 
rule, of course, could not always apply to school buildings contain- 
ing more than one room. In buildings of two, four, or more rooms 
it will often be necessary to have the windows of as many rooms face 
the west as the east. It still remains true, however, that those rooms 
whose windows face the east, when other conditions remain the same, 
will be the most healthful and wholesome rooms because of the early 
sunning which they will get. And just here is perhaps the best 
place to say that while the north light is the most diffused and the 
softest which can be admitted into the schoolroom, it is unsafe to: 
depend on maintaining the health of children kept in schoolrooms 
with windows looking only toward the north. These rooms will 
do for art work and laboratories, but not for regular classrooms. 
Every schoolroom needs a sun bath each day to keep it pure and 
wholesome, and it is contrary to the simplest and plainest rules of 
hygiene to construct a schoolhouse which will not permit of this 
mode of sanitation and disinfection. Also the first part of the last 
rule needs some slight modification in order to prevent it from de- 
terring in certain cases. There are conditions in most of the South- 
ém and Southwestern States, especially in the great valleys, which 
demand openings toward the north, not for the purpose of getting 
additional light, but for ventilation and cooling. In the warm val- 
Jeys, during the early and later months of the school year, the heat 
is often so intense as to render it almost necessary to get the advan-
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
ae of a breeze through the room. Under these conditions it is best 
to have some openings in the side of the room opposite the windows. 
Such openings have elsewhere been called breeze windows. If they 
open into a hall or cloister they offer no inconvenience from weather 
conditions or cross lighting. These openings need not be full-sized 
windows, but better, small windows set 8 feet or more above the 
floor. In case these are set in an outside wall they must be so made 
as to prevent rain from beating in, and covered on the inside with 
close-fitting opaque shades or curtains. This precaution, together 
with their height above the floor, will prevent such windows from 
admitting a blinding light into the eyes of teacher or pupils. In 
those sections of our country where there are many cloudy days 
during the winter and early spring, and especially in smoky cities, 
with tall buildings not far removed from the school ground, it is 
necessary, as I have elsewhere said, to plan for at least one-fourth 
as much glass surface to each room as there is floor space. The 
difficulty comes in the proper placing of so nz-uch glass surface in a 
single wall. 
If, for example, the room is 30 feet long, 22 feet wide, and 123 feet 
high, it would be necessary, according to this rule, to place in a wall 
80 feet long 165 square feet of glazing. If the bottom of the win- 
dows are set 4 feet above the floor and the tops of them extend within 
6 inches of the ceiling, the length of the windows would then be 
limited to 8 feet. In order, therefore, to get the amount of window 
surface demanded by this rule, 21 feet of wall surface would have 
to be used for glass. This would leave only 9 feet for mullions 
between windows and the corner supports. This would necessitate 
the extension of the windows too far to the front so that some of the 
children in the room would be compelled to sit through the day 
almost facing the windows. But it should be remembered that in a 
room 22 feet wide it requires a smaller ratio of glass surface to floor 
surface, other things being equal, to give equal illumination. Those 
children who sit near the windows have plenty of light and those 
farther away are handicapped accordingly. So when classrooms are 
reduced in width we may safely reduce the ratio of glazing to floor 
surface correspondingly. Hence, six windows 3 feet wide and 8 feet 
long will give ample light in such a classroom except in extreme 
northern climates or when buildings are badly placed. 
It rarely does any good to attempt to make up the deficit of glass 
surface, if there be any, by setting windows in the rear of the class- 
-room. Such an arrangement always disturbs the teacher, causes the 
children to work in their own shadows, and to get disturbing cross- 
lights. In the greater part of our country we have found that the 
ratio of glazing to the floor space need not be over 1 to 5. This will
-P-A-G-E-57
LIGHTING. AT 
give ample room to set the windows properly and provide ample 
illumination. Hence, under ordinary conditions, there is no neces- 
sity for purposes of lighting to put windows in more than one side 
of schoolhouses properly placed and where the light is not cut off by 
fog, smoke, or high horizon lines. 
In the earlier edition of this bulletin it was necessary to stress 
unilateral lighting far more than it is now for the simple reason 
that it was an innovation and people had to be convinced of its value. 
During the past 10 years practically all progressive communities 
and all capable school architects have accepted this as the best type 
of lighting. Hence there is no need at the present to enter into 
extended arguments pro and con. Furthermore, methods of building 
have made rapid progress and what once.seemed to be a difficult type 
of building to construct is now easy. It may be repeated here that 
a classroom 22 feet wide is, other things being equal, better than one 
24 feet wide. The farther north in our country the better results 
we get, in the way of satisfactory light, by reducing the width of 
the classroom and thus commanding good light with a smaller ratio 
of glazing to the floor surface. 
The distance between the floor and the lowest part of all class- 
room windows should be greater than it is usually made, in order to 
prevent the light from shining directly into the pupils’ eyes. The 
window sill should be at least 4 feet above the floor, so that all 
light falling upon the desks would come from above the level of the 
eyes of the pupil when seated at his desk. This is an exceedingly 
important direction, for, when windows are so constructed, the dan- 
ger of misplaced and disarranged shades is minimized. Some of the 
European cities require that the bottoms of the windows must be 
placed as high above the floor as the tops of the pupils’ heads when 
seated. 
n order to get the best light and the most of it for the amount of 
window surface, it is absolutely necessary to run the top of the win- 
dows as near to the ceiling as possible, for it is plain that 1 foot of 
window surface near the ceiling of the room will do more to light 
the room than 2 or 8 feet near the bottom. The tops of the 
windows ought to be at least 12 feet above the floor, for this will 
insure sufficient light to those pupils seated farthest from the 
windows. 
Ten years ago there was a tendency among school architects to 
introduce into schoolhouses a coved or curved ceiling line. This 
tendency was condemned at that time and reasons given why it was 
a mistake. During the intervening years this mistake has been cor- 
rected, and it is a rare thing to find architects specifying such con- 
struction, The main reason for condemning this practice was,
-P-A-G-E-58
    48 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
as can be inferred from the above discussion, that it necessitated 
dropping the tops of the windows too far below the ceiling line. 
As mentioned elsewhere, no pupils should be seated at a greater 
distance from the windows than that equal to twice the height of the 
tops of the windows from the floor. And this, too, only on the condi- 
tion of the proper amount of window surface. Where it is impos- 
sible to get sufficient light from ordinary windows, due to errors in 
plans or to conditions over which builders have no control, prismatic 
or ribbed glass may occasionally be used with profit. As the result 
of a@ series of tests made by Professor Norton, of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, it was found that by the use of this ribbed 
glass, set in the upper parts of windows, the illumination on dark 
days could be increased under certain conditions from 40 to 50 
per cent. 
The proper arrangement of shades for the windows is not an easy 
matter. Blinds ought not to be used at all, for the reasons spoken 
of above, and for the further reason that they are far more ex- 
pensive than common roller shades, and frequently become hard to 
manage. 
The best arrangement of roller shades which has been devised 
consists in using two separate sets of shades for each window, both 
fastened at about two-fifths of the height of the window, the upper 
one to pull up and the other to pull down. Care must be taken to 
place them in such a way that they will not rub together when both 
are rolled up, nor leave a chink through which a stream of light 
may pass when both are unrolled. Special brackets have been de- 
vised for these fastenings and are now on the market. The shades 
should be wide enough to cover the window and extend over each 
side of the window frame, to prevent rays of light from passing the 
sides. This last precaution will save much annoyance later. 
There is on the market now a type of shade which folds rather 
than rolls; fastens at the center above, and can be adjusted to cut 
out the light from any part of the window. It requires more care in 
handling than the roll type of shade, but. if teachers will learn to use 
it and take the time to adjust it carefully, it will meet the needs bet- 
ter than any single shade. 
There has been a great deal said about the proper color of the 
shades, and many experiments have been made to find the color and 
tint most satisfactory to the eyes of children, which will at the same 
time serve to prevent the entrance of dazzling light. Some have ad- 
vised the use of an opaque dark green shade below and a translucent 
lighter green one above. This arrangement, however, can be satis- 
factorily only when the shade used above is sufficiently opaque and 
sufficiently dark to avoid that peculiar greenish light which makes

for discomfort. Rowe, 1n his excellent little book on The Lighting 
of Schoolrooms, says: 
I have found: bisque (a light sage) makes a very satisfactory color, not 
light enough to annoy or dark enough to exclude the light. This and lighter 
colors of the handmade tint and the Bancroft Sunfrost Hollands meet all the 
requirements of Cohn’s light tester. 
Since the light of the room is modified both in amount and quality 
by the color of the walls, it is in place here to speak of this. What 
color is best for the walls of a schoolroom? The answer to this ques- 
tion will be given by summarizing a report. made to the school board 
of New York City by a committee of the best known oculists of the 
city: 
(1) The wall space between the floor and the window sills and 
the chalk troughs should be a light brown. 
(2) Side walls and ceilings should be a light buff tint, or a light 
gray. [The red end of the spectrum should never be used in school- 
room decoration, for it. absorbs too much of the light. 
(8) Light-colored wood should be selected for the furnishings 
d furniture of the room. 
(4) The color chosen for the walls and ceilings should be chosen 
x the most unfavorable days. 
(5) The woodwork in the schoolroom should not be highly 
olished. Natural finish with a dull surface is best. 
SUMMARY. 
1. In those parts of our country far to the north, where the sun 
is low in the south a greater part of the school year, and in those 
locations where fogs and cloudy weather prevail or where the air 
is clouded with smoke, architects ought to allow to each room one- 
fourth as much glass surface for the purpose of lighting as there is 
floor surface. In the South and Southwest where sunshine is abun- 
dant and where the sun is higher above the horizon at noontime, one- 
sixth as much glass surface as floor surface, when the windows are 
properly placed, is sufficient. In general, where there are no hills, 
high buildings, or trees to obstruct the light, and where the atmos- 
phere is comparatively clear, one-fifth as much glass surface as 
floor surface will suffice. 
2. The bottom of the windows should be at least 4 feet above the 
floor. 
3. The windows should be placed as closely together as safety of 
construction will permit and as far back toward the rear of the room 
as possible and to the left of the children when seated at their desks. 
4. To aid in grouping the windows closely together iron or steel 
mullions should be used with the inner and outer sides having 
4
-P-A-G-E-60
50 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
rounded edges in order that the light from the windows may be 
equally distributed over the room, that as much light as possible may 
enter, and that no shadows may fall on the desks near the windows. 
5. The windows should extend close to the ceiling, for the best and 
most effective light comes from the top of the windows and spreads 
over the entire room most evenly. 
6. Where tall buildings or high hills raise the horizon line on the 
window side of school buildings, prismatic or ribbed glass should be 
used in the upper part of the windows, for this both scatters and 
increases the light in darker parts of the schoolroom. This sort of 
_ glazing should not be used on the lower part of the windows on 
account of the glare produced. 
7. In hot climates, where during part of the school year a breeze 
is refreshing and acceptable, there should be placed, when possible, 
at least two small windows 8 feet above the floor in the side of the 
room opposite the windows. These breeze windows should be hinged 
to the lower part of their frames or placed on a pivot and covered 
with opaque curtains. Such windows are not for the purpose of 
light, but, as suggested, to afford openings for an alleviating breeze 
when conditions demand. 
8. Sliding slat blinds or outside shutters should never be used in 
schoolrooms either to cut off the direct rays of the sun or for deco- 
rative effect, for they are both expensive and ill adapted for school 
purposes. The best means so far devised and at the same time the 
cheapest and most easily managed appliances for this purpose are 
double shades or the single folding shade recently put on the market. 
These double shades should be fastened at a point about two-fifths 
up the windows from the lower sill. They should be fastened in a 
specially devised bracket (such brackets are on the market), so that 
while one shade will close the upper part of the window from below, 
the other will close the lower part of the window from above. Care 
should be taken that these brackets are so constructed and so placed 
that no rays of light can pass between the two shades, either when 
rolled or unrolled. The shades should be sufficiently wide to prevent. 
the rays of light from entering at their sides. 
9. It is a very difficult matter to hit upon the proper color of 
shades and at the same time to get those sufficiently translucent to 
allow a maximum of light to pass through without producing a 
glare. In general, it may be said that a light unobtrusive green seems 
to be the most satisfactory. This, however, will in part depend upon 
local conditions and the proper situation of the windows. Green is 
a very troublesome color to handle in a schoolroom, and tests ought 
to be made in all cases before final decision is made. For it often

happens that a slight variation in shade or the quality of material 
makes a decided difference in the quality of light in the schoolroom. 
10. The great amount of blackboard surface used in American 
schoolrooms tends to absorb much of the light. On dark days when 
these are not in use it has been found that great relief can be afforded 
those children who sit at the desks farthest removed from the win- 
dows by drawing down light curtains over the blackboards. Profes- 
sors Basquin and Scott report that “by the introduction of screens 
over the blackboards” they found that in rooms receiving unilateral 
lighting they could by the use of such screens increase the light at 
the darkest seat in the room 50 per cent. 
11. By reducing the width of classrooms to 22 feet it is much - 
easier to get proper illumination for all the children than it was in 
the old type of classrooms 24 to 26 feet wide. In this room, five 
_ rows of desks are placed while in the older room six rows of single 
desks were set. The distance, therefore, of the last row of chile 
dren from the windows was greater in the old type of classroom than 
the one I am now advocating and hence their desks were not so 
readily illuminated. 
VII. HEATING. 
Before entering upon a discussion of the various methods em- 
ployed in heating schoolrooms, it will be well to consider briefly 
this question: At what temperature should the schoolroom be kept? 
Very thorough investigations of this subject, especially those con- 
ducted by the New York Commission on Ventilation, have estab- 
lished the fact that a temperature of from 66° to 68° (with a 
relative humidity around 50 per cent) is the best for school work. 
Certainly 70° is the maximum allowable. | 
These figures may all be misleading, however, for the construction 
of the schoolroom and the methods of heat distribution enter vitally 
into the question. For example, one schoolroom with damp walls and 
poorly constructed floors may be quite uncomfortable at 68° F. at the 
breathing line in the center of the room, while another, with damp- 
proof walls and double floors with deadening felt between may be 
quite satisfactory with an even temperature of 66° F. One frequent 
complaint from teachers arises from the fact that there is too much 
disparity between the temperature at the breathing line for the chil- 
dren while seated and that for the teacher while standing. There is 
a real difficulty here, and it can be remedied only by double floors well 
deadened and protected from drafts and more effective methods of 
evenly distributing the heat. Naturally, heated air moving by the 
force of gravity will seek the upper part of the room, and unless it 
finds an exit there will remain until it becomes cooler than the ascend- 
ing currents, when it will slowly descend. ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  52 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
Every school should be supplied with two or more accurate ther- 
mometers, so that the supervisor as well as the teacher may know 
the exact temperature maintained at the breathing line and at the 
floor line in all parts of the room. These are not expensive luxuries, 
but may serve to forestall a good deal of complaint and furnish 
indisputable evidence for the edification of all concerned. 
Certain discomforts which were hitherto connected with breathing 
foul air are really due to working in overheated rooms. Dullness, 
headaches, and general heaviness of mental action may, and often do, 
find their immediate causes in superheated air, which by interfering 
with the elimination of body heat, upsets the normal physiological 
activity of the body. On the other hand, unless the children are 
comfortably warmed in cold weather, it is not only impossible to 
carry on the work of the school, but it is positively dangerous for 
them to be quiet. It is absolutely essential, then, to make pro- 
visions for adequate heating. This last statement seems to be a use- 
less one, for it is a mere truism; but, sad to say, it is what one 
might with propriety call a theoretical truism rarely realized in 
practice. 
1. FIREPLACES. 
Old-time schoolhouses were heated by fireplaces, and, in general, 
those pupils close to the fire were too hot, while those at a distance 
were uncomfortably cold, for such a fire is more effective in creating 
drafts in a schoolroom than it is in giving out heat. In.a room so 
heated there is a partial vacuum created, causing the outside cold air 
to pour in at every possible crack or crevice and to move directly 
toward the fire. The day of the open fire in the schoolhouse has 
almost gone, for, while it had some advantages, it failed to accom- 
plish satisfactorily and economically its purpose. It was cheery on 
mild days and totally inadequate on cold days, but it was a good ven- 
tilator—indeed, too good. In comparatively recent years fireplaces 
have been constructed in such a way as to warm the fresh air and in- 
troduce it into the schoolroom through ducts above the fireplace. 
This style has a distinct advantage over the original in that it helps 
in preventing drafts and at the same time is more economical of fuel. 
But fireplaces in school buildings are inadequate and ineffective save 
in well-constructed buildings in mild climates. Even so, the trouble 
of keeping up the fires and preparing the wood is too great to com- 
mend them for use in a busy schoolroom. Most fireplaces and grates 
waste more than 90 per cent of the fuel. As an auxiliary to ventila- 
tion, when the heat supply comes from a furnace or through steam 
coils connected with the fresh-air inlets, the fireplace correctly placed 
is useful and effective.
-P-A-G-E-63
HEATING. 53 
2. BOX STOVES. 
The box stove came next with its greater efficiency and economy. 
It heated the room but afforded no effective means of equalizing the 
temperature in the various parts of the room. When situated in the 
centeyof the room it was in the way, and because of the fact that it 
was out of the question for a pupil to sit near it when it was heated 
sufficiently to meet the demands of those occupying benches next the 
walls much of the best space of the schoolroom was wasted. If 
placed near the end or side of the room, it was ineffective for the 
room as a whole. The roastings to which the school boys of a gen- 
eration ago were subjected remain yet as vivid impressions. Fortu- 
nately, vigorous outdoor employments-and sports, together with short 
school terms, minimized the dangers. In early days the school build- 
ings were often built in such a way that the wind swept under the 
floor at will. Double floors with deadening felt were not known, or 
if they were, knowledge in this case at least had no relation to virtue. 
Single floors with open cracks were the rule. The walls were made 
of studding, covered on the outside with one thickness of clapboards 
put on shingle fashion, and on the inside with wide boards tongued 
and grooved. Shrinkage was ample and hence the stove must be 
kept red hot in cold weather. Log houses well chinked were in 
some respects much better, but small and awkwardly fitting windows 
in these generally evened up the difficulties. 
The great majority of the country schools in parts of our country 
are yet in the box-stove era, but the buildings are being more care- 
fully made, and hence the children are somewhat better protected 
from the cold. 
3. JACKETED STOVES. 
The jacketed stove is the next step in the evolution of heating 
small school buildings. A jacketed stove, as its name indicates, 
is a stove surrounded with a casing or jacket, between whieh jacket 
and the stove there is left an air space connected directly by means 
of one or two ducts with the air outside. These ducts permit the 
cold fresh air from the outside to come in contact with the stove 
and when it is warmed to rise directly into the schoolroom. The 
jacket when properly fitted serves to keep this fresh air close enough 
to the stove to warm it, and at the same time to deliver it into the 
room well above the breathing line. It is well to provide the fresh- 
air inlets with dampers to be used during troublesome winds. 
In recent years a great many varieties of jacketed stoves have been 
put upon the market, all of them using of course the same principle 
of heating fresh air and distributing it through the room and at the 
same time creating a circulation by exhausting the air in some
-P-A-G-E-64
0 Ee eee ee 
54 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
fashion near the stove. They can be set in the corners of the room, 
draw the fresh air directly from without, and heat and deliver it to 
the classrooms directly. At one time it was thought of great im- 
portance to have an exit flue or a pipe attached to the stove and ex- 
tend nearly to the floor.’ The theory was that as the warm ex- 
panded air swept upward and outward to the various parts of the 
room that the air would leave the room through this flue and 
thereby create considerable circulation. This theory works in part, 
but is not nearly so effective as many imagine. Much of the incom- 
ing air goes out around windows and doors and various openings 
in the wall, especially those higher up in the room. The heavier 
air lies nearer the floor and hence is not inclined to be drawn readily 
through the exit flue. In the former edition of this bulletin more 
stress was laid on the necessity of providing exit flues than now - 
seems justifiable. The friction in these flues is often so great and 
their lack of sufficient draft so correspondingly poor, that a 
smaller amount of impure air is exhausted than was thought to be 
the case. I do not mean by this discussion to suggest elimination of 
these exits from jacketed stoves, but simply to warn schoolmen against 
believing that the jacketed stove will ventilate a schoolroom. It 
will aid much in very cold weather, but in mild weather it is of very 
little use in supplying fresh air to classrooms. The fact is a 
jacketed stove can not be trusted to ventilate satisfactorily at any 
time and not even passably, save in cold weather, but is of great 
service in equalizing the temperature in various parts of a class- 
room. But it is the best method of heating where a central system 
can not be installed. Every country school, or for that matter 
village school, not supplied with a central heating plant should be 
supplied with jacketed stoves. 
4. HOT-aAlk FURNACES. 
Hot-air furnaces are so well known that any extended description 
of them is unnecessary. Suffice it to say that the furnace of a hot-air 
heating system must be placed in a basement or at least in a room 
lower than the space to be heated unless mechanical contrivances 
are utilized to drive the heated air into the building. Like any 
central heating system it has the great advantage of keeping fuel 
and other débris out of classrooms and confining the fire hazard to 
some central location where it can be guarded much more safely. 
Naturally the distribution of ducts leading to various rooms to be 
heated and the location of the furnaces are of prime importance. 
Very frequently disastrous mistakes are made in locating and prop-

hot-air furnace gives off heat quickly, and likewise, unless care-

fully handled, loses its heat speedily and hence is likely to cause a 
good deal of fluctuation in temperature in the classrooms. There 
are some serious objection in addition to the foregoing which may 
be briefly stated as follows: 
There is danger that the gases produced through combustion, 
especially of coal or oil, will leak through the joints in the furnace 
and enter the air passing into the schoolrooms. The danger is espe- 
cially marked when through carelessness of the janitor or the person 
who tends the fires the furnaces are overheated and then somewhat 
suddenly allowed to cool by opening the doors of the fire boxes. In 
cold weather, when it is necessary to heat the radiating surfaces very 
hot to supply enough heat in the rooms, the danger is more marked. 
It must ever be remembered that however tight the joints are made 
in the beginning, any furnace fire box is subject to great strain, 
through the expansions due to heating and the contractions due to 
cooling. These strains will in time open the joints and furnish 
opportunity for some of the carbon monoxide and sulphurous gases 
generated by a coal fire to escape into the air ascending to the rooms. 
The only remedy for such a defect is to make the heaters so large 
that it will be unnecessary to make them very hot to raise the amount 
of air needed to the temperature required. It is obvious, then, that 
an overworked furnace is the most dangerous furnace when leakage 
of gases is considered, and the most expensive in the cost of fuel 
and labor. The practical lesson to learn here is this: If a hot-air 
furnace is to be used for heating the air and delivering it to the 
schoolroom, it is essential to install one abundantly large, so as to 
heat all the air needed without the necessity of overheating the 
fire box. It is in no sense an exaggeration to assert that 75 per cent 
of the furnaces for heating schools which I have examined are too 
small for either safety, economy, or health. 
In large buildings where this method is used it is good economy to 
have two or more furnaces in different parts of the basement and to 
adjust the fires accordingly. This plan of separate furnaces has the 
double advantage of preventing overheating and of making it much 
easier to introduce the air into the rooms without serious friction in 
the ducts and with a minimum loss of heat through radiation. For 
long air ducts, especially where there is much horizontal run, offer 
so much friction to the passage of the air through them and afford 
an opportunity for so much loss of heat that they are almost useless 
when depending on gravity for air movement; and even when a fan 
is used they are still ineffective. 
When cold air comes in contact with overheated radiating sur- 
faces it becomes dry and, as it were, parched. Such air is in effect 
desert air, and when introduced into a schoolroom will rapidly absorb 
93146°—25——_5
-P-A-G-E-66
      : 
56 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
moisture from the skin and especially from the lining membranes of 
the eyes and air passages. Such continual absorption renders the 
skin, and more specially the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, 
throat, and trachea, dry and harsh. Such a condition, as everyone 
ought to know, offers ideal opportunity for pathogenic germs to lay 
hold of these delicate tissues and penetrate into their crypts. When 
the lining membranes of the air passages are coated with their normal 
~ moisture or mucus it not only serves to prevent these germs from so 
readily reaching the tissues but it also catches dust particles and 
thereby prevents them from being drawn into the lungs. After a 
ride in dust and smoke the condition of the lining membranes of the 
nostrils will bear witness to this fact. Besides, it seems quite prob- 
able, if not certain, that these mucous exudations may have germi- 
cidal properties which have hitherto escaped scientific detection. 
AJ hot-air furnaces should be supplied with some means of mois- 
tening the air before it is introduced into the schoolroom. Especially 
is this necessary in cold climates where the amount of moisture mixed 
with the air is necessarily small and where its temperature must be 
raised 40° or 50° F. The expansion of the air thus taking place will 
further reduce the percentage of saturation very greatly, ‘and serious 
and annoying dryness will result; and then we have a desert atmos- 
phere in the schoolroom. The problem of heating is intimately con- 
nected with the problem of securing satisfactory humidity in the air. 
Obviously, the supply of fresh air to the radiating surface of a 
hot-air furnace or, for that matter, to any heating surface used should 
enter through a clean passageway and from a point well above the 
ground. The walls of the passageway and the fresh-air chamber 
near the furnaces should be carefully constructed of glazed brick or 
lined with smooth, hard cement, in order that as little friction as pos- 
sible will result as the air passes to the heating surfaces. The floors 
of these air passages should be cemented and kept scrupulously clean, 
for any dirt or dust that enters them will quickly find its way into 
the schoolrooms. 
“If the opening for the entrance of fresh air is placed 6 or 8 feet 
from the ground there is much less likelihood that dust from the 
playground, the roadway, or street, or contaminated ground air will 
be drawn into the schoolrooms. This opening should be securely 
screened so as to keep out the larger particles floating in the air dur- 
ing high winds, and to prevent anything from being thrown into it, 
such as apple cores, orange peels, or anything else that would vitiate 
the air or litter the floor. These passages must be carefully closed 
below and as far as possible made air-tight so that foul air may not 
be drawn into them from the basement. The location of the opening 
to receive the ingoing fresh air is a matter of much importance on
-P-A-G-E-67

account of the influence of winds, the danger from dust, and the need 
of drawing the air from the purest source possible. It has been 
found that if this air can be drawn from the south or warm side of a 
building there will be a decided saving in fuel. Carpenter says: 
It may be demonstrated by a properly protected thermometer that the average 
day temperature of air is higher on the south than on the north side of a build- 
ing. The difference often reaches 10° F. An average of 5° F. would make it 
highly advantageous to take the air from the south rather than from the north 
side of a building. If an average rise of 35° I’. is needed in the air temperature 
in ventilating work, then one-seventh of the heat required for that rise could 
be gained by choosing a south as against a north location for the inlet. 
(Heating and Ventilating Buildings, by Dr. Rollo C. Carpenter, pp. 451-452.) 
The fresh air must be brought into the bottom of the heating cham- 
ber so that even on windy days there will be no possibility for reverse 
currents, and that at all times there will be as little hindrance to the 
easy movement of the air as possible. 
All things considered, especially when an ample radiating surface 
is installed, when the ducts leading to the rooms are mathematically 
proportioned and not too long, and when proper means are afforded 
for humidifying the air, hot-air furnaces are fairly satisfactory in 
the milder climates of our country, and if carefully kept in repair 
there is no valid argument totally condemning them. The main 
troubles come through overheating, lack of humidification, and 
unbalanced system of ducts leading to the various rooms and neglect 
in upkeep. 
It is unnecessary to state or discuss in this case the various rules 
used for determining the exact amount of radiating surface needed 
to meet easily and safely the demands to be made upon any 
system of heating. 
These are matters for the expert engineer to determine, and a 
school board will act wisely when it seeks and pays for such advice. 
This caution, however, ought to be given: Some expert engineers— 
indeed, many of them—know little about the demands of schools, 
and it is always better to select for consultation one who has made 
a careful study of the peculiar needs of schoolroom heating, and 
especially one who has no connection with manufacturers of heating 
systems. One duty, and a very important duty indeed, which such 
an expert adviser ought to be called on to perform, is to test the plant 
when completed and be sure it fulfills the contract signed. 
5. HOT-WATER HEATING. 
In the past few years hot-water heating systems have been in- 
stalled in greater numbers in school buildings than theoretically one 
could have anticipated, and yet there are some major difficulties 
with this system when applied to the heating of school buildings.  
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
The one outstanding disadvantage and danger is that during severely 
cold weather, during vacations, the radiators, which, of course, are 
necessarily filled with water, will freeze and burst unless emptied 
or the fires kept burning. Were it not for this particular difficulty 
there would be no hesitancy in recommending hot-water systems 
for medium-sized school buildings, for in many respects it is the 
best system of central heating thus far devised. In the first place, 
it is far more regular and steady than either steam or hot air. It is 
more easily regulated, it is free from noise and “air-scorchings” 
and more economical of fuel. It is a little slower, however, than 
either of the other systems, but once the rooms are heated variation 
is very slight. It has one distinct advantage over steam. In mild 
weather, when only a slight increase over outside temperature is 
demanded, small fires will produce. the result and keep heat going 
that in a steam boiler would produce no effect because obviously the 
fires must be heavy enough with steam heating plants to develop 
steam before any heat can be supplied. 
Speaking in general terms, it is not safe to install a hot-water 
system in very cold climates, but in mild climates it can be used 
safely and satisfactorily if all necessary precautions are taken and 
the system is installed under the guidance of a competent engineer. 
There is far less expense attached to keeping up a carefully planned 
hot-water system of heating than any other known system. Natu- 
rally, it requires a greater radiating surface for a given space than 
steam, but offsets this difficulty with a much steadier and more regu- 
Jar heat. There will probably be in the next few years a rather 
striking growth in the number of hot-water heating systems installed 
in school buildings in the milder parts of the country, and this will 
doubtless be in the line of advancement. 
6. STEAM HEATING. 
The most generally used method for heating the larger school 
building is that of direct or indirect radiation or both from the 
radiators of a steam heating plant. Within the past 10 years low- 
pressure systems of steam heating have been installed in a great 
majority of the new buildings constructed. The one great advan- 
tage of steam heating lies in the fact that it is much easier to regu- 
late the heat in the various rooms, and to proportion it properly, 
especially in large buildings, than any other system. Ten years ago 
it was practically universal to use, in connection with a steam 
heating plant, a plenum fan system to blow the air over the radia- 
tors into the various rooms. Later the split system was developed, 
in which a part of the radiating surface is located in the various 
rooms to be heated, and the rest left in heating chambers and con-
-P-A-G-E-69
  
HEATING, 59 
nected up with the various rooms by inlet ducts through which fans 
operate to force in warm fresh air. This development took place on 
the theory that proper ventilation could be secured by the plenum 
system in which doors and windows of classrooms were always kept 
closed and air forced in and out by means of the fans. Recently, 
thoroughgoing investigations have somewhat changed our attitude 
in this regard and at the present time there is a growing tendency to_ 
depend more completely on direct radiation without the aid of the 
fan system. This point will be discussed more completely coger 
the general heading “ Ventilation.” 
Steam radiators placed in the schoolroom are often disconcertingly 
noisy. The hammering or slapping sounds which are not infre- 
quently heard are very annoying and distracting alike to the teacher 
and the pupils. No way has been devised to get rid entirely of these 
disturbances, for they seem to be caused by the rising steam catching © 
and driving back the returning stream of water produced by the con- 
densation of the steam already used. In addition to this noise in any 
system of steam coils, the valves get leaky and the escaping steam 
will set up confusion, or the dripping water will injure the building. 
All of the so-called vacuum systems of steam heating are designed 
to prevent this noise, and in addition to manage the steam supply 
in the radiators so that the temperature will be automatically reg- 
ulated. But systems of this type, which I have seen in use and for 
which large claims have been made, are not free from beating noises, 
nor will they at all times properly regulate the temperature. Theo? 
retically, they may be all that they claim, and if perfectly set and 
furnished may suffice in practice; but I am told by a distinguished 
engineer that thus far there is surely a discrepancy between the 
claims made for these systems and their practical workings. 
Steam heating is better adapted to cold climates than it is to those 
parts of our country where mild to medium weather prevails through 
the greater part of the winter season. This system of heating, how- 
ever, frequently requires more care than any other system now in 
general use. This is largely due to the fact that the radiators, of 
which a great number are required, are often quickly heated and as 
quickly cooled. This rapid expansion and contraction necessarily 
throws much strain upon all connections and when these are opened 
they are frequently hard to close. The boilers of course require ex- 
‘pert care, especially where high pressures are used both to insure 
safety and to guard against deteriorations. Leaking flues and steam 
fittings require the services of expert mechanics andr this is expensive 
service. But taking it all in all the best advice to give, especially in 
the colder climates of the country, is to install a low-pressure system 
of steam heating and to depend largely, if not entirely, upon direct
-P-A-G-E-70
  60 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
radiation and a thoroughgoing system of thermostats to regulate 
the heat in each room. Of course the utmost care must be taken to 
proportion and apportion the radiators in the several rooms and to 
make certain that the disturbing noises or “ water-hammerings” are 
eliminated as completely as possible. 
It is essential that every board of education upon whom the duty 
of building schoolhouses rests should see to it that the best of expert 
advice be followed in installing heating plants. Otherwise one can 
not expect satisfactory results. 
7. THERMOSTATS. 
e . 
When the heating of schoolrooms is wholly or is part dependent 
upon indirect radiation and warmed air introduced into the class- 
room, it is a vital necessity to have an adequate system of thermo- 
stats to regulate the temperature of the air or rather to maintain 
a proper temperature inside the classroom. 
Such devices depend in one way or another upon the principle 
of expansion by heat and contraction by cold. The practical 
difficulty to overcome has been that of hitting upon a medium sufli- 
ciently sensitive to respond and yet steady enough to prevent rapid 
fluctuations. Some use mercury as the medium, others sensitive 
metals of a more rigid form, and still others liquids of such a com- 
position that they will vaporize at the temperature required. Gen- 
erally, those using mercury depend on making and breaking an 
electric circuit in which an electromagnet acts upon the dampers to 
close or open the entrance for hot air, and vice versa to open or 
close the duct permitting the entrance of cold or tempered air. 
Those using liquids depend directly upon the force generated by the 
vapor to regulate the dampers, while those using metals of a rigid 
sort depend upon the management of compressed air to do the 
work required. These appliances have brought great relief to both 
the teachers and the children, for without them the teacher was 
compelled to keep watch on the thermometer to prevent the room 
from either becoming too cold or too hot. When thermostats are 
properly installed and the heating is of the indirect sort men- 
tioned, the temperature of a schoolroom can be regulated, and, 
if the heat is always to be had, will keep the room at a tempera- 
ture not varying more than 2° F. at any time. One of the most 
successful kind may be described briefly as follows: Somewhere in 
a convenient place in the basement is a tank containing compressed 
air, from which small pipes radiate to the various schoolrooms, 
where they connect with a thermostat properly located and care- 
fully adjusted. One part of the apparatus visible in the school- 
room shows by means of a pointer whether the room is being cooled
-P-A-G-E-71
  HEATING, 61 
or warmed. A neat covering containing a thermometer shields the 
rest of the apparatus and at the same time furnishes a ready means 
for testing its accuracy. The thermometer has no organic connec- 
tion with the thermostat. The air is supplied to the tank containing 
the compressed air by an air pump automatically regulated. The 
force applied to this pump is usually that of the water in the pipes 
of an ordinary city water supply. If this is not available, some 
other source of regular power must be used. If the temperature of 
the room is below that required, the opening in the end of this tube 
is kept closed by a tight-fitting valve or plug held in place by a 
spring. When the air reaches the temperature desired, a tongue 
of specially prepared metal expands, and, by means of the mecha- 
nism connected with it, opens the valve and permits the air to escape 
through another tube, at the end of which is a small air-tight cham- 
ber connected on one side with a diaphragm, or metal bellows. 
These are in the basement, where the changes in the diaphragm can 
be observed by the fireman. The pressure of the air within this 
cavity forces up this diaphragm, which acts on a lever connected 
with the dampers in the air ducts leading to the schoolroom, and 
thus cuts off a part or all of the warm air and at the same time opens 
the damper to the cold-air chamber, and thus through the pressure 
of the fan allows the cold or tempered air to be driven into the 
schoolroom until that temperature is reached which causes the metal 
tongue to contract. The spring will then cause the valve to close the 
tube leading to the compressed-air tank and at the same time permit 
the air in the diaphragm to escape back through the tube into the 
outer air. The diaphragm will then be compressed by a spring 
attached to it and the dampers will be reversed, allowing warm air 
again to enter the schoolroom. This plan will prove successful if 
carefully guarded, and the apparatus is so made that it will not be 
constantly changing and through too great a range of temperature. 
There is this to be said about all thermostats with which I have 
had experience in school buildings: They are complicated bits of 
apparatus and must be guarded with care and will not prove success- 
ful unless the caretaker thoroughly understands their construction 
and knows how to adjust them. It is a waste of money and danger- 
ous to the health and comfort of school children to install a system 
of thermostats and then to put them under the control and super- 
vision of a janitor or a teacher who does not understand the principle 
used in their construction or the mechanism devised to utilize the 
principle involved. A janitor selected for political purposes or 
simply because he can sweep and build fires is never likely to handle 
them well. Here, then, let me repeat what is said elsewhere, the 
janitor of a modern and thoroughly equipped school building must
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
have had a good deal of mechanical training and above all must be 
a man of high-grade intelligence. 
The modern thermostat, in which a metal bellows takes the place 
of a rubber tambour, has eliminated much difficulty. They are or 
may be made as sensitive to changes as the older type and are entirely 
free from the necessity of constant attention and such fluctuations as 
would come with the loss of elasticity in rubber. 
VIII. VENTILATION. 
It would require the writing of a volume to discuss exhaustively 
the problems connected with ventilation, and even then lack of exact 
knowledge would be much in evidence, for there are still many un- 
solved problems in this field. It seems wise, then, to limit the dis- 
cussion in this bulletin to those demands which must be considered 
and met during the process of the construction of school buildings 
and leave the others to more technical treatises on school hygiene 
and engineering. Let us then set ourselves the task of answering as 
best we can this question: What are the requirements in the way of 
equipment and construction necessary to secure adequate ventilation 
of a modern school building? 
Theoretically there is no satisfactory system of ventilation for 
many-roomed school buildings which does not use some form of 
mechanical means to force air into the rooms or to withdraw it 
from the rooms, or both to drive in and withdraw it at the same 
time. A gravity system of ventilation (that is to say, one where 
the air is caused to move by reason of different temperatures) can 
be made fairly satisfactory in medium to cold weather when the 
differences in the temperature required in the room and that pre- 
vailing outside are from 40° to 50° F. Plainly in mild or warm 
weather there will be very little movement in the air unless a wind 
is blowing, and for this reason it is difficult to make changes in the 
atmosphere in the classroom depending entirely on window ventila- 
tion. The reason that this is true lies in the physical principle 
that all air motion necessary in gravity or natural ventilation is 
caused by the difference in weight of the same bulk of heated or 
cold air. When we warm air it expands and becomes lighter, and 
hence will rise when surrounded by cold air, for the same reason 
that a cork will rise to the surface if immersed in a bucket of 
water. Water is heavier than cork and will thus displace it until 
it finds a balance at the surface where a part of it will rise above 
the water. Cold air is heavier than warm air and will displace it 
if opportunity is given for the warm air to rise; so if the air out- 
side the room is cold and the air inside is heated, either by direct
-P-A-G-E-73
  
VENTILATION. 63 
or indirect radiation, there will be a pressure exerted from all 
sides and underneath the schoolroom by the heavy air to displace 
the warm air and drive it up, just as the cork is driven up from the 
pail of water. The cork does not come up of itself, neither does 
the warm air rise of its own accord. Neither would move were it 
not for the fact that each is displaced by heavier medium. This 
gives us the principle upon which all forms of natural or gravity 
systems of ventilation depend. If we remember that air when 
heated expands and bulk for bulk is lighter than cold air then we 
have a guide to the measurements of air currents in any gravity 
system of ventilation. Suppose, then, it is cold weather and we 
depend on heating the air about a furnace or steam coils in a base- 
ment and connect these heating boxes by means of a system of 
ducts with the various schoolrooms above. As the air is warmed 
it expands, becomeg lighter, and is forced to rise by the greater 
weight of the same bulk of cold air which will rush into the duct 
Jeading from the outside to the heating surface, providing, of 
course, this entrance duct delivers the cold air underneath the 
heating surfaces and the ducts leading to the schoolrooms connect 
et or near the top of the heating chamber. Suppose the air out- 
side is at a temperature of 20° F. and the fires warm the heating 
surfaces in the furnace so as to cause this cold air to take a tempera- 
ture of 70° F. There will then be a strong upward movement of 
this heated air caused by the pressure of the cold air. This warm 
air will escape through the ducts arranged for the purpose into the ° 
schoolrooms. This warm air is pure air, if it comes from a good 
source and the heating surfaces are properly made, and hence the 
schoolrooms are being supplied with pure, warm air. But it is plain 
from what has been said that the amount of such fresh air delivered 
into the schoolrooms will depend on the size of the ducts and the 
rate of the movement of this fresh, warm air. Try another ex- 
periment with the cork by embedding in it some leaden pellets, 
such as shot, to see if the rate of its movement from the bottom 
of the bucket to the surface of the water will be increased or de- 
creased. You know what the result will be before trying. The 
less the difference in weight between the cork so loaded and the 
same bulk of water the slower will be its upward movement. Ex- 
actly the same thing happens by reducing the difference in weight — 
(that is, the amount of expansion) between the air ready to enter 
the schoolroom and that outside. Suppose, for example, the air 
outside is at a temperature of 50° F. To heat it to a temperature 
of 68° F. will cause less difference in expansion and therefor less 
difference in weight. Hence the rate of movement will be slower 
and Jess warm, fresh ‘air will enter a room within a given time.
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
Thus the ventilation of that room will be less rapid and will supply 
the needs of fewer people. 
Children of the primary grades, gathered in a schoolroom, need 
2,000 cubic feet of fresh air per pupil each hour. Students of high- 
school age need 2,500 cubic feet. This does not mean that they will 
individually breathe so much, but that each will vitiate that amount. 
They will each breathe approximately 18 cubic feet per hour, but 
when a breath of air is exhaled it has lost so much of its oxygen and 
has taken up from the blood so much carbonic-acid gas that one ex- 
haled breath will vitiate more than a hundred times as much fresh 
air to such a degree that none of it will be fit to breathe. This 
vitiation consists in reducing the normal amount of oxygen, but 
especially in increasing the normal amount of carbon dioxid and 
throwing into the air bad odors and possibly some sort of toxic agent 
produced through fatigue. 
Since the first edition of this bulletin was prepared much inves- 
tigation has been undertaken with reference to proper methods of 
ventilation. The most notable work done in this field is that of 
the New York Commission on Ventilation. After two or three 
years of experimental work, in which ample means and trained 
specialists were at command, the following conclusions represent in 
part the results of their labor: 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide in ordinary classrooms, even 
under condition of poor ventilation, is of very little danger. 
2. The depletion of oxygen in a badly ventilated classroom is 
insufficient to cause appreciable harm. 
3. The chief difficulty lies in the interference with the normal 
escape of heat from the bodies of the children, due to the lack of 
the dissipation of the blanket of heated and moist air with which 
they are surrounded. 
4. In order that these disadvantages may be obviated, it is neces- 
sary to keep the air in the classroom in motion, and to keep it from 
becoming too warm. 
5. The outstanding result in the condition of those who are sub- 
jected to badly ventilated workrooms is loss of appetite. 
This much-talked-of and fairly thoroughgoing investigation seems 
to make it clear that the chief problem is to keep the air in motion 
within the classroom, so that the bodies of the children will be kept at: 
the proper temperature and the blanket of moisture gathering about 
the bodies be carried away. This looks as if it would be necessary, 
if the recommendations of the commission be carried out, to install 
within the room some mechanical device to keep the air in motion 
rather than to depend upon a central plan of fans to drive the air 
into the room, The fact is we are still in doubt as to the best methods
-P-A-G-E-75
  VENTILATION. 65 
of supplying, at a reasonable cost and without other disturbances, the 
best sort of mechanical schemes of ventilation. It is very plain that it 
is perfectly possible to install sufficient fan power in the basements 
of buildings and connect these up with properly placed ducts with 
the classrooms to furnish ample and thorough ventilation without the 
necessity of installing fans within the rooms, But the trouble comes 
in the expense of installation and in the running of such fans. There 
are thousands of fans installed in school buildings totally inadequate 
to do the work they are supposed to do. There are hundreds of others 
sufficiently powerful but are not operated because of the expense con- 
nected with their operation. The truth is (and boards of education 
should understand this thoroughly) it is a very expensive process to 
install fans of sufficient power to ventilate all schoolrooms properly 
and a much greater and a more constant expense in the long run to 
keep them running. It is disheartening, to say the least, to see how 
many school buildings are supplied with fans that never run. Liter- 
ally there are millions of dollars’ worth of ventilating devices rusting 
out in the large school buildings of this country. It stands to reason 
that one of two things ought to be done. Either fans must not be in- 
stalled, or, if adequately installed, they must be kept running. 
Boards of education must be frankly told that mechanical systems 
of ventilation are very expensive, and unless they are willing to bear 
this expense constantly and regularly it is a serious blunder to in- 
troduce fans. The safest plan, at least temporarily, is to heat by 
direct radiation and ventilate through the windows. I am fully 
aware that this throws the responsibility wholly upon the teacher so 
far as maintaining ventilation is concerned, and that it also intro- 
duces the difficulty of ventilation in mild weather, when the air 
currents move very sluggishly. “Possibly the next step will be the 
introduction into rooms of individual electric fans to help keep the 
air in motion, still depending upon the windows for intake and exit. 
The whole problem of ventilation is still far from being solved, and 
boards of education should be warned against any so-called mechanical 
system without the best of disinterested advice and the knowledge 
that they must pay heavily for the results obtained. 
While it seems established that temperature and humidity are the 
chief factors to be considered in ventilation this does not mean that 
increase in carbon dioxide and decrease of oxygen content may be 
totally disregarded, and it is not at all proven that odorous substances 
given off from the body are not depressing and that toxic materials 
iaay not also be present in respired air. 
The best thing to do is to keep the air in classrooms as near to 
that. of the outside air as possible, when that outside air is at the 
proper temperature, in order to prevent undue accumulation of heat
-P-A-G-E-76
  
  Pe 66 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
in the body. The big problem, of course, is to induct sufficient 
fresh air into the schoolrooms, distributing this equally and keeping 
it moving at such a rate as to dissipate the blanket of moisture 
gathering about the bodies of the children. The best possible way 
of doing this has not been demonstrated, but at present (knowing 
the tendency everywhere to neglect the use of fans in ventilating - 
classrooms) the best results may be obtained by the use of properly 
adjusted windows, properly oriented, and handled by teachers who 
thoroughly appreciate what they are trying to do. (See Appendix 
on Orientation of Buildings in Southern States.) 
: Ix. TOILETS. 
The walls of toilet rooms should be made of white tile, glazed 
brick, or hard cement and finished with a hard waterproof white 
paint. AJl schoolmen know the difficulties encountered in keeping 
the walls of these rooms free from obscene writings and drawings. 
They also know that the neater and better the toilet rooms are pre- 
pared at the first, the less apt the walls are to be defaced. The walls 
of dark and dingy toilet rooms are the very ones, other things being 
equal, that suffer from such indiscretions. Young people respect and 
care for these rooms when decently made, flooded with light, and 
acceptably ventilated. And when we are arguing for this care in 
planning and construction we are doing so not only from the point 
of view of sanitation and convenience but also for the sake of moral 
values. Where glazed tiles or bricks can not be used, due to the 
expense, specially prepared hard cement plaster and hard waterproof 
paint may be used with a fair degree of satisfaction. In order to 
keep these rooms free from evil suggestion, then, flood them with 
light and keep the walls scrupulously clean. 
Toilet rooms should be so constructed as to offer direct drain- 
_age through a trap with sewer connections. In the girls’ room 
this should be on opposite sides from the seats or toward the front, 
so that the drainage may flow from the seats toward the outer 
wall. In toilet rooms designed for boys no special opening is nec- 
essary, for the drainage can be made through the urinals. While 
to some the foregoing directions may seem unnecessary, it has been 
found by extended observation that a great many blunders have 
been made in these details. 
Elsewhere it has been suggested that the toilet seats should be 
set in a single row and not back to back as most frequently found. 
It is almost impossible to light stalls when set back to back, and 
then it is difficult to inspect such rooms quickly and see that all con- 
- ditions are justifiable. Naturally this requires a little more space
-P-A-G-E-77
TOILETS, 67 
per pupil than if seats were set in double rows back to back. But 
this demand is legitimate and hygienically important. 
The urinals in the boys’ toilets should be constructed of white 
glazed enamel, and set so that the bottom will be slightly below 
the level of the floor and sloping toward the drain. They should 
be of small to medium size. The floor should slope very gently 
so that the pupils may stand close to the urinals without danger 
of slipping and thus prevent contamination as well as conserve 
decency. One urinal for each 30 boys is ample, especially if teachers 
and principals will so order recesses that there will be no conges- 
tion. Enough is necessary but too many bring trouble. In build- 
ings given over entirely to children of primary grades, there should 
be one urinal for each 25 boys : 
There is no reason why small children should be furnished with 
adult-sized toilet seats. Indeed, it is sinful to impose on them in 
this fashion. Juvenile-sized seats are on the market, cost no more, 
usually less, and when furnished, automatically segregate the smaller 
children in these rooms from the older pupils. This in itself is 
worth while; but it is positively insanitary and unjust to require 
little folks to use adult sizes. Care must be exercised in selecting 
the proper type of toilet fixtures. Those opening slightly in front 
and without top lids are to be preferred, for this not only assures 
better cleanliness but less danger. With the development of plumb- 
ing it is now possible to secure directly flushed seats so as to 
get rid of the flush tanks of the older variety. These tanks have 
been the sources of a great deal of trouble in schools because of 
the fact that they get out of repair so frequently. The automatic 
flush and hinged type of seat is not satisfactory for the lower 
grades and indeed not completely so for any grade of school. It 
is very difficult for small children to mount these seats and also 
troublesome for them to get off without soiling themselves. It is 
better to have the push button or lever type of direct flush and 
depend upon teaching children to flush the seats. 
One seat for each 20 girls in the lower grades and for each 25 
in bigh schools is sufficient. For the boys there should be one seat 
for every 25 pupils in the lower grades and one for each 30 in the 
high schools. These numbers are reductions from the writer’s earlier 
estimates, but subsequent careful investigation has shown that when 
programs are planned so as to dismiss the various grades, with a few 
minutes interval between, that the foregoing number of seats will 
be entirely satisfactory. Of course this takes into account the neces- 
sity that all should be kept in repair and not, as frequently happens, 
a number of them allowed to remain out of repair for weeks at a 
time. It is essential to have enough, but it is unnecessarily expensive 
and hygienically troublesome to supply more than are necessary. 
   
-P-A-G-E-78
    68 : AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
The width of stalls should not be over 32 inches and their depth, 
if the doors open out, not over 4 feet. These dimensions give ample 
room, conserve space, and thereby save expense. The top of the 
sides of the stalls should not be over 5 feet from the floor. This gives 
all the privacy needed, permits better lighting, better ventilation, 
and reduces expense both in installation and upkeep. Partitions 
made of slabs of expensive marble, 7 feet high, have been installed in 
some school buildings. This is not only a criminal waste of public 
funds but really a harmful thing to do from the hygienic point of 
view. The reason why the sides of toilet stalls have frequently been 
made so high is to raise the front cross bar between the stalls high 
enough to clear the head of a tall man. To be sure, these braces 
must be high enough to avoid bumps, to keep the stall sides rigid, 
and, also, in the boy’s toilet, to prevent them from being used for 
gymnastic apparatus. This can be accomplished, however, without 
the necessity of boxing in the stalls with partitions as high as 
these cross braces. Steel pipes T’d off from the outer and upper 
corner of the sides of the stalls and fastened securely to them and 
the walls at each end of the toilet room furnish neat and rigid 
braces. Naturally, the bottoms of the stall partitions should be 
lifted at least 12 inches above the floor, and the bottom of the door 
high enough from the floor—say 14 inches—to permit the shoes of 
the children to be readily seen without opening the door. A door 
3 feet high so set is high enough for all necessary privacy. I believe 
these doors are necessary and important for the stalls designed for 
the upper grades of the school. There is a delicacy suggested by 
them worthy of our consideration and should be a part of the regular 
school influence. 
X. DISPOSAL OF SEWAGE. 
Lavatory bowls should be set in these rooms as near the exit as 
possible and always in good light. These ought to afford a sug- 
gestion to each child as he leaves the room, “Wash your hands.” 
This is an elemental, sanitary rule, which should be taught to all 
children. The number of these lavatory bowls need not be greater 
than one-third of the number of seats. They should be kept in good 
repair and scrupulously cleaned each day. 
In specifying these demands for as good toilet equipment as can 
be made, there is no desire to be wasteful or unduly particular. The 
best is in the long run the most economical and certainly the most 
educational. A schoolhouse is not only a place where children are 
taught, but, in all its appliances and conveniences, it should be an 
educational and sanitary agent. As better sanitary fixtures are being
-P-A-G-E-79
DISPOSAL OF SEWAGE, 69 
installed in the homes, the number of such fixtures can be safely re- 
duced in school buildings. Parents should teach their children (and 
do when conveniences are afforded) to use them before school hours 
and thus conserve health and the time at school. 
What are we to do with toilets, baths, overflow from drinking 
fountains, and drainage in general from a schoolhouse, if the build- 
ing is in a town not supplied with a sewer system, and especially in 
the country? This was formerly a difficult question to answer, but 
relief can now be satisfactorily afforded. Under such conditions 
the best method to use is some form of septic tank disposal. Since 
the first edition of this bulletin was written much progress has been 
made in this kind of sanitation. Perhaps the best known simple 
form of septic tank is one devised by the Kentucky State board of 
health for use in country homes and at country schools. The fol- 
lowing cut and description will make this clear:

  Fic. 5.—Septiec tank made of glazed sewer tiles. 
Naturally, one of the important factors making for success in 
this type of sewage disposal is the absorption field. This field must 
be ground of porous nature, so that the outflow from the tank may be 
quickly and readily absorbed, and all suggestion of overloading, 
which would cause disagreeable odors or keep the ground wet and 
soppy, must be avoided. The automatic siphon, which properly and 
wisely belongs to this form of waste disposal, tends to insure a 
better use of the absorption field, because by reason of an intermit- 
tent but rapid outflow it spreads the water throughout the whole 
field, and then, until the dosage tank is refilled, time is given for the 
absorption field to take care of the water and dry out and purify 
itself. Where the outflow is constant and comparatively slow there 
is a tendency for that part of the absorption field lying nearer the 
tank to be overworked, while other parts are insufficiently supplied. 
However, this siphon attachment requires more thoughtfulness and 
care in setting it than the simpler form, such as the Kentucky type, 
which, however, when properly devised and well placed, is a very 
important element in sewage sanitation.

Properly speaking, this short discussion belongs more properly 
in the bulletin entitled Rural Schoolhouses and Grounds which is 
to follow this publication. In this, further and completer discus- 
sion will be made. 
XI. BATHS. 
Tt is no longer an experiment to install in public-school buildings 
bathing facilities for school children. Naturally baths are most 
needed in large city schools, especially in those sections where for- 
eigners and poverty-stricken families generally congregate. But 
what a glorious thing it would be if country and village high schools 
could all be supplied with baths, for all who know country conditions 
generally know that country children rarely have access to proper 
bathing facilities. Country boys bathe in summer in streams and 
“mudholes,” chiefly for the fun of it. Even this questionable method 
of ablution is generally denied the girls. 
It is safe to say that not one country child of school age in a hun- 
dred has even regular weekly sanitary tub or shower baths through- 
out the year. With modern windmills, driven wells, storage tanks, 
air-pressure tanks, and gasoline engines, country schools and country 
homes are no longer of necessity compelled to handle a water supply 
at a great disadvantage. One part of the social mission of the 
schools consists in introducing into the homes better facilities for 
plain hygienic living, appliances which will bring surcease from 
much useless drudgery, and those modern conveniences which save 
so much time and conserve health. Every consolidated country 
school should, therefore, be supplied not only with pure, wholesome 
drinking water but an ample supply for baths, lavatories, and 
toilets. 
From the point of view of cleanliness, and especially from that 
of economy, shower baths are much to be preferred in school build- 
ings over either tub baths or swimming pools. In arranging a 
building for shower baths, very little extra cost for plumbing is 
necessary. The only item of serious expense is that for providing 
hot water. Some form of heater or boiler is necessary, unless some 
method of sun heating is adopted, such as is used in many parts of 
California. There, by means of a series of lenses focused on a water 
tank, all the hot water needed is readily supplied. But, of course, 
such a method is only practicable where the climate is very mild, 
and where days with a high sun are very common. Where gas is 
accessible, it is not difficult to install heaters, and these are now 
manufactured in many styles and sizes, and are so constructed that 
they need little care, are very compact, and can be used at a minimum 
expense for fuel. It is never advisable to use water from a steam
-P-A-G-E-81
  
    SWIMMING POOLS. Ta 
boiler for bathing purposes, because of the impossibility of pre- 
venting the water in such boiler from becoming increasingly dirty 
and oily. However, there are good oil stoves now on the market 
which might be easily arranged to heat water for baths. Besides, 
there are coal stoves designed for this purpose and may be installed 
wherever fiue connections and a water supply are available. 
It is easy to see that shower baths in schools are superior to tubs 
and swimming tanks, for the former require less water, and this 
is constantly pure; there is less danger in them of the spread from 
one pupil to another of any contagious skin disease; they take much 
less time, require less space, and on the whole are more effective. 
But it may be asked, how could bathing facilities be installed in 
a village or country school building where there is no public water 
supply that could be piped into the building? This can be easily 
accomplished now by the use of a windmill or gasoline engine in 
connection with an air-pressure tank in the basement or elsewhere 
out of the danger of cold and storms. By this method water can be 
forced through a building to laboratories, toilet rooms, faucets, drink- 
ing fountains, bathrooms, wash rooms, lavatories—in fact, wherever 
it is needed. Such a provision for water supply will also lower 
the rate of insurance and render the building safer for children to 
occupy, for in case of fire it offers immediate help. 
The matter of soap and towels can be left to local communities to 
settle. Where public opinion warrants the expenditure, it is best 
for the school to furnish these, for then the washing and sterilization 
can be done thoroughly. However, there is no decisive reason why 
each pupil should not be free to furnish his own towels and soap. 
In general, it is better to begin in this way and thus prevent some 
criticism. 
The position of the baths and dressing rooms in a school basement 
will be determined in part by the size of the basement and the num- 
ber of pupils to accommodate; but they ought to be placed where 
waste water can be carried away most readily. It is never hygieni- 
cally permissible to allow waste water from any part of a school 
building, save that passing through the urinals and toilet vaults, to 
pass directly into sewers. Somewhere outside of the building the 
ordinary waste-water pipes should be trapped into the sewer so 
effectively as to make it impossible for sewer gas or odors to come 
into basements. 
XII. SWIMMING POOLS. 
Naturally, swimming pools are for healthful recreation and not 
for bathing purposes. No one should enter a swimming pool who 
has not been thoroughly cleansed in a shower bath, and who is not 
93146°—25 6    
-P-A-G-E-82

  42 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
free from any contagious skin disease. There has been a rapid in- 
crease in the last- 10 years in the number of swimming pools through- 
out the country, in connection with high schools, Christian associa- 
tions, churches, municipality undertakings, and many fraternal 
orders. The committee on sanitation of swimming pools of the 
American Public Health Association reported in New Orleans, in 
1919, that data had been received relative to 1,254 pools of 47 States. 
Probably it will not be far from the truth to say that at present there 
are between 1,500 and 2,000 swimming pools in various parts of the 
country. It is interesting to note that according to population the 
‘Western States are better supplied in this regard than the Eastern. 
California has practically twice as many as any other State in the 
Union. 
Keeping these pools in sanitary condition and seeing that they are 
used properly are not easy tasks. In most States, as the report of 
the foregoing committee shows, very little has been done in the way 
of legislation to control sanitary conditions in swimming pools. 
A committee of the American Public Health Association also sent 
out a questionnaire on bathing places. Seventy per cent of the 
replies received were to the effect that bathing places were an im- 
portant factor in the transmission if diseases. Bathing places 
in this report include beaches and other open pools in addition to 
swimming pools. Naturally, there would be a good deal of difference 
between these two types of bathing places. In open water, such as 
beaches and rivers, there is more opportunity for contamination 
from a distance; that is, the water is likely to be far more impure 
than in properly cared for bathing pools. On the other hand, the 
danger of transmission of diseases from person to person is doubt- 
less more likely in swimming pools. The problems of the swimming 
pools are not only concerned with the purity of the water but with 
the cleanliness of towels and the condition of the bodies of those who 
enter the pools. The report of the above-mentioned committee may 
be fairly well represented by the following quotation: 
The most significant and important data obtained from our replies were 
reports of epidemics of various diseases, which, from the information supplied 
by the reporting physicians, may be considered reasonably authentic. Seven 
different physicians reported epidemics of conjunctivitis, and six others, 
epidemics of skin diseases, four of these being epidemics of furunculosis, two 
of impetigo contagiosa, two of molluscum contagiosum, and one of eczema. Two 
physicians reported epidemics of middle-ear infection, which, from the history 
submitted, were undoubtedly caused by infection of the water at the bathing 
places. Two other physicians reported epidemics of tonsillitis and phar- 
yngitis, and one reported an epidemic of nasal sinus infection in which all the 
evidence pointed to bathing water as the origin. One of the members of the 
committee also reported an epidemic of typhoid fever in a camp for boys, which 
was unquestionably caused by bathing in polluted water.
-P-A-G-E-83
  
SWIMMING POOLS. 73 
It is very seldom that fatal cases of any disease, outside of typhoid, per- 
haps, have been attributed to bathing place infection. One physician, 
however, reported a fatal case of mastoid infection and four other physicians 
reported a number of fatal cases of meningitis following infection of the nose 
or ear: passages.” 
It is plain from the result of this investigation, and others of a 
similar nature, that those who plan to construct swimming pools in 
high-school buildings or other public-school buildings may have, 
clearly in mind that while they are offering a fine opportunity for 
healthful sport they are also affording opportunity for the spread of 
infectious diseases unless they make thorough sanitary provisions to 
prevent such dangers. Eye, ear, nose, and throat specialists have 
frequently told me that infections have multiplied perceptibly and in 
certain cases strikingly whenever swimming pools have been opened 
to the general public. To be sure, it will be much easier to guard 
from infections in swimming pools for schools than those in general 
public use, but even here a definite and serious problem must be 
frankly met. 
All water in swimming pools should be thoroughly filtered each day, 
and this can be accomplished by any good form of pressure filtration. 
The water should be tested at regular intervals, both chemically and 
biologically, but, probably more important than all, no one should be 
allowed to use the swimming pool who is infected with eye trouble, 
nose or throat trouble, or any form of contagious skin disease. This 
calls for a constant examination of children’s bodies and would 
certainly require more time and more expense than the average high 
school is able or willing to undertake at present. All swimming 
pools should be sterilized daily by the use of chemicals, or, preferably, 
ultra-violet rays of light, for this is not harmful to eyes or ears. 
From what has been said above there is no reason to infer any 
opposition to swimming pools in connection with high schools if the 
community is willing to pay for their installation and proper sanitary 
oversight. All who have seen the delight and help children get in 
learning to swim will agree in saying that it is a splendid recreational 
agency. IJ am anxious, however, to make plain the dangers connected 
therewith so that those who construct swimming pools will know the 
problems they must plan to meet and the dangers they must combat. 
XIII. GYMNASIUMS. 
During the past 10 years there has been a remarkable growth in 
the demand for gymnasiums in public-school buildings and especially 
so in medium-sized high schools. The problem of health develop- 
ment, greatly emphasized by the World War, has caused boards of   
1 American Journal of Public Health, February, 1922, pp. 121-123,
-P-A-G-E-84
PAY SEs pee eR ee ee ae ee ee 
94 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
education and the people in general to demand gymnasiums and 
equipment for school buildings much more persistently than was 
formerly the case. No one can conscientiously deny that this is a 
good thing, but it often happens that people make demands incon- 
sistent with conditions as they actually exist. Gymnasiums are im- 
portant, no doubt, but so are open-air sports and outdoor exercises. 
_In the northern part of our country it is too cold and disagreeable in 
“winter to get much regular exercise outdoors, and hence in such 
climates gymnasiums are far more important than in the warmer 
sections where, during at least four-fifths of the winter, children can 
play out of doors, to the advantage of all concerned. Some architects, 
notably Mr. Ittner, have made the gymnasium serve the purpose of a 
theater and assembly room. This is illustrated in the Grover Cleve- 
land High School in St. Louis and the new Phillips High School in 
Birmingham, Ala. Others have made assembly rooms serve as gym- 
naslums. 
The size and relative dimensions of gymnasiums should be worked 
out tg suit the special conditions and needs of the school, but it should 
be high enough, wide enough, and long enough to accommodate a 
regulation basket-ball court, for this is rapidly becoming a very 
important game in American high schools and colleges and is worthy 
of encouragement. 
It is to be hoped that more attention will be given by schoolmen 
to open-air gymnasiums than thus far has been given. By an open- 
air gymnasium is meant a covered structure large enough and high 
enough for all gymnastic exercises, but inclosed on the sides with 
wire only, so as to allow the free movement of the outside air and 
complete exposure of the floor to sunshine some parts of the day. 
The most successful of such structures are usually made of a light 
but firmly united steel frame and trussed roof. In most of the 
Southern States such gymnasiums can be used nearly every day of 
the winter and, of course, offer children a chance to exercise in the 
open air without exposure to inclement weather. But in sections 
where snows drift and the temperature is too low for free play out 
of doors they are not especially valuable. 
A combination of gymnasium and auditorium will be discussed 
under the heading “Assembly room.” 
XIV. PLAYGROUNDS. 
The apparent tendency of boards of education to limit the amount 
of ground for school buildings and at the same time to demand ex- 
pensive gymnasiums sould be protested against. The popular call 
for gymnasiums, in which spectacular basket-ball games may be 
played, should be resisted. It would be better to spend the money 
|
-P-A-G-E-85
LABORATORIES. 75 
on larger and better school grounds, with hard surface tennis courts 
which may be used for outdoor sports of many kinds, including 
basket ball, volley ball, ete. 
Educational authorities and officers should give more time to the 
general recreation and health of all the children instead of devoting 
money, time, and attention to opportunities for athletic contests, for 
a few only. These contests are not harmful if managed sanely and 
honestly, but they are far less valuable than the quiet, unpretentious 
but thoroughgoing upbuilding of the health of all the pupils. It 
often happens that those who need general outdoor exercise and gen- 
eral upbuilding are the ones who are left out when some “team” is 
to be developed. Year after year this problem arises when grounds 
are selected and buildings planned. Principals of schools are partly 
to blame for this, because very few are able to resist the advertise- 
ment that comes from a winning team. 
By all means build gymnasiums, if the community is willing, 
but first get plenty of ground for play purposes and prepare this 
for all sorts of sports and expect the children to use it. When this 
attitude toward relative values becomes more marked. fewer gym- 
nasiums will be necessary. 
XV. LABORATORIES. 
The time has passed in the history of education when it was 
thought sufficient in a course in physics or chemistry for the teacher 
to set lessons in textbooks and do the experimenting himself in the 
presence of the class. There is yet definite need for textbooks and 
good models of experimentation, but we have learned that unless 
the pupils take hold of apparatus and, under specific direction and 
wise guidance, perform experiments themselves, we can not hope 
for any lasting interest or thorough understanding of these subjects. 
It becomes necessary, therefore, to plan to give each student who 1s 
studying either or both of these sciences, and for that matter all 
sciences, room and opportunity for individual work. Furthermore, 
as a laboratory equipped with tables, gas pipes, water basins, micro- 
scopes, balances, etc., can not be used conveniently as a lecture room, 
where the class may meet to see experiments of a special sort, to 
discuss them and to compare their own results with certain prin- 
ciples enunciated in the textbooks, a science lecture room is almost 
a necessity. Hence, at least, five rooms are needed for these two 
sciences: A laboratory for physics, one for chemistry, a common 
lecture room, and two smaller rooms for storing apparatus and 
chemicals until needed. In a high school where one teacher is ex- 
pected to teach both of these sciences one supply or apparatus room 
of ample dimensions and of proper construction can be made to
-P-A-G-E-86
  16 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
suffice. This is true only on the condition that some isolated part 
of it be set apart for those chemicals which might by their presence 
in the same room be deleterious to certain pieces of physical ap- 
paratus. But it is always better to have a separate room for the 
chemicals, where they may be carefully and systematically placed 
and rendered less dangerous to both apparatus and the building as 
a whole. 
Suppose two supply or apparatus rooms can be provided, how 
shall these, the laboratories, and the lecture room be best arranged 
with reference to each other? In the first place, the question must 
be asked: Where shall these rooms be placed, on the first floor or on 
the second, if a two-story building is planned? There are advan- 
tages and disadvantages with either location. When a chemical 
laboratory is placed on the first floor there is danger that the fumes 
and odors from the chemicals used in experiments. may escape into 
hallways and adjoining rooms, rendering it difficult to keep the air 
fresh and pure. Then, too, it is better, as far as possible, to use the 
space on the first floor for recitation rooms, and in this way make 
it unnecessary for most of the students to climb the stairs so often, 
for it must be remembered that at least three-fourths of the recita- 
tions of a high-school course are held in ordinary classrooms. In 
the next place, it is far more difficult to ventilate properly a chemical 
laboratory on the ground floor than it is one located on the second 
floor next to the roof, presuming, of course, that the building is two 
stories in height. In fact, no schoolhouse should be built higher 
than two stories; all those going beyond this limit introduce many 
difficulties and ee merely for the sake of economy. No chemical 
laboratory can be safely used unless adequate precaution is taken 
to carry off the fumes and gases generated during experimental work. 
And these ventilators must extend to the outer air above the build- 
ing. When the laboratory is on the ground floor these’ ventilators 
have to be placed in the walls, and this either makes it necessary to 
do the work close to the walls or to make sharp angles in the ven- 
tilating ducts so that they can overhang the experiment tables in 
the center of the room. If the ventilating ducts are placed in the 
walls and the experimental tables arranged next to the walls, it is 
almost impossible to arrange sufficient work room with satisfactory 
light without undue expense. If these ducts are bent or elbowed 
so as to open above the central parts of the room, where the tables 
should be placed, they are thereby rendered far less effective on ac- 
count of the great retardation of the movement of the air due to 
the friction in the crooked and longer ducts. On the other hand, it 
is much easier and less expensive to supply proper and safe plumb- 
ing for a chemical laboratory situated on the ground floor, Gas
-P-A-G-E-87
LABORATORIES. CF 
pipes and water pipes can be easily carried into the walls to the 
second floor and be brought through the floor at the proper places, 
but it is more difficult to place the waste pipes and render them safe 
and hygienic. But aside from these difficulties of plumbing (and 
they can be overcome) and the greater instability of the upper story 
of a building, there is no reason why the second floor should not be 
preferred for the physical laboratory. The light is usually better, 
and the opportunity for many disturbances is reduced. In delicate 
experiments where jarring or shaking movements are troublesome 
and disturbing there is a real difficulty. But, generally speaking, 
there is little or no real need for such experiments in a high-school 
course in physics, and, judging by the growing tendency to eliminate 
them, they will shortly be left to the college course, where they be- 
long. 
All things considered, physical and chemical laboratories are 
better placed on the second or top floor than on the first. Doubt- 
less this will not hold good for all conditions, but in the majority 
of cases it has proved wise to arrange them in this way. 
If it were possible to have a separate building of one story devoted 
to the sciences, then, of course, what has been said would not apply. 
It would be an ideal arrangement, as far as laboratories go, to sepa- 
rate them from the main building; but usually, on account of lack of 
space and because of the increased cost of such rooms, they are made 
to occupy a part of the main structure. This arrangement reduces 
the expense of heating, ventilation, and plumbing, as well as initial 
cost in the room provided. ; 
So far it has been assumed that it is best to have the physical and 
chemical laboratories on the same floor, and if possible in the same 
part of the building, in order to make the lecture room serve for 
both, and not to be far removed from the apparatus or supply 
rooms. At the present time there seems to be a tendency, especially 
in small or medium sized high schools, to eliminate the science 
lecture room as a separate room and use one end of the laboratory 
for this purpose. There are some advantages and some disad- 
vantages in this plan. For example, it will eliminate to a certain 
extent some duplication in furniture and give the teacher an op- 
portunity at any moment during the laboratory period, if it seems 
necessary, to call the students together for a demonstration or 
general directions. In a way, it will seem less formal than if the 
students were taken to a separate room. In this manner possibly 
better reactions, or at least more natural ones, can be secured. 
However, if the laboratory room is made sufficiently large to use 
one end of it for lecture purposes very little, if anything, is saved
-P-A-G-E-88

in the way of space and hence expense in construction. There will 
also be no chance to use this space for other purposes as satisfac- 
torily as can be done with a lecture room. 
Furthermore, a lecture room can be much more readily and easily 
arranged for lanterns or any type of visual work than can be done 
in the laboratory proper. Then, again, this lecture room can be 
used for all the sciences and in this way bring them closer in touch 
with each other and enhance daily the value of cooperation. One 
space, therefore, in the form of a lecture room will avoid duplica- 
tion of space in several laboratories. 
The following cut illustrates what seems to be one of the best 
arrangements thus far worked out: 
  Fic. 6.—A plan for chemical and physical laboratories. 
This shows these laboratories occupying the same wing of a build- 
ing with windows looking toward the east. They are supposed to be 
on the top floor, and are adjusted with reference to the apparatus 
rooms and a common lecture room. It will be understood that the 
lecture room can be built with an inclined floor sloping away from 
the window side down to the teacher’s table. This plan is somewhat 
objectionable on account of the necessity of the teacher facing the 
light, and also on account of the pupils having to write somewhat in 
their own shadows, i. e., with the light behind them, but it insures 
good light.on the apparatus toward which both pupils’ and teacher’s 
eyes will in the main be directed. The students will have com- 
paratively little writing to do in this room, for in proper work the 
time will be, in the main, given to observation and discussion, and 
what writing they will have to do will be limited to a few notes and 
drawings. 
As to the teacher’s position toward the light, it may be said that 
his table can be adjusted on the track designated, so as to give him a 
position to one side of the front of the room and in this way relieve 
him from the necessity of facing the light directly. Then, too, if he 
wishes to spend a greater part or all of the hour in lecturing he can _ 
stand to one side still further. :
-P-A-G-E-89
    
LABORATORIES. 79 
But most of the disadvantages resulting from this method of light- 
ing can be readily obviated by introducing a skylight into the lecture 
room. This method seems to be growing in popularity since heavy 
wired and ribbed glass have been manufactured. <A skylight is di- 
rect and does not disturb either the lecturer or students, and at the 
same time offers the least difficulty with shadows. However, it is 
somewhat more difficult to darken the room for lantern work, and it 
also introduces difficulties in obtaining proper architectural effects 
and efficient ventilation where mechanical means of ventilation are 
not provided. But these objections can be overcome, and skylight- 
ing for a science lecture room seems on the whole to be the best. 
The track mentioned above and indicated in the cut is of light 
rails laid flush with the floor so that the teacher’s tables, properly 
equipped with wheels, can be run from the apparatus rooms into the 
lecture room with the apparatus all in place, and at the close of the 
lecture can be run back into the apparatus rooms to discharge the 
apparatus not further needed. This arrangement will save a great 
deal of the teacher’s time and make it possible for the room to be used 
immedietely for another lecture or for any other purpose. It will 
enable the teacher to prepare for an experiment the day before with- 
out appropriating the lecture room. It will save not a little break- 
age, insure better order in the supply rooms, and better care of the 
apparatus in the laboratories. Furthermore, this arrangement will 
save time in transporting the apparatus and thus make it easier to 
prepare for lectures and demonstrations. 
This arrangement of science rooms is an adaptation of one I saw 
in the Reform Gymnasium in Berlin and which was recommended 
highly by the science master. 
It will be noticed that the track extends entirely through the 
whole series of rooms and can be utilized for collecting and replacing 
apparatus in the laboratories and transporting such to and from the 
storerooms. This, again, will save much time, especially in supply- 
ing the demands of the workers in the physical laboratory. If the 
track is laid flush with the floor and the side grooves made only deep 
enough and wide enough to admit the flanges of the wheels, the rails 
will not interfere with the use of that part of the room and will be 
in no way objectionable. 
But if for given reasons it seems best not to extend the track 
through the laboratories, it can, of course, stop at the outer doors of 
the supply rooms and be used only for carrying apparatus to or from 
the lecture room. It seems wise, however, to lay it in the physical 
laboratory, on account of the frequent changes in the apparatus 
needed in a course of experimental physics.
-P-A-G-E-90
  
80 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
A window from each supply room to its corresponding laboratory 
has been indicated to further aid the teacher in distributing appara- 
tus and materials to the laboratories. The shelving and cases in 
these rooms can be arranged to suit the equipment, and ought to be 
specified by the science teacher or the principal of the school. It is 
better that no doors should open into the halls from these supply 
rooms. This will aid in safeguarding the apparatus from meddlers 
and prevent the entrance of much dust. If sliding doors could 
always be relied on, it would be better to use this form of door be- 
tween the lecture room, supply rooms, and laboratories, but since 
they are usually troublesome, wide swinging doors are indicated, to 
be set to open away from the apparatus. 
In the lecture room there should be a switchboard and water con- 
nections, as indicated in the figure by “W” and “KE.” These could 
be placed next to the wall or in the wall were it not for the fact 
that when connected up with the apparatus on the table the wires or 
water connections would be in the way of the teacher while at work 
at the table. It seems best, therefore, to make a permanent basin 
with all necessary plumbing at one end of the table when it is in 
place and a switchboard at the other end. These, as shown in the 
cut, ought to be in front and just clear of the edge of the table when 
moved along the track. These permanent fixtures can be boxed in 
and made to be covered so as not to present any danger or untidy 
appearance when the room is used for lectures in any other subjects. 
In fact, they can be easily finished so as to be transformed into stands 
from which a lecturer may read, or upon which books can safely rest. 
With this arrangement they will be out of the way when not needed 
and ready for immediate use when required. 
The wall space between the doors into the hall can be used for a 
blackboard. It is best to set it 4 feet above the floor and make it at 
least 3} feet wide. It should be of slate of a good grade and set as 
near flush with the wall surface as possible, in order that a white 
curtain may be pulled down from a roller fastened against the wall 
close to the ceiling. The purpose of this curtain is to furnish a 
surface upon which lantern projections may be thrown. The stere- 
opticon or projectiscope can be used to advantage not only in the 
sciences but in history, literature, and art. To this end a small, level 
platform ought to be constructed near the side of the room next the 
windows, from which lanterns or like apparatus can be used. This 
suggests proper electric wiring for light and provision for thoroughly 
darkening the room. And just here let it be said that a little fore- 
thought and definite planning will save time and often much trouble. 
For example, instead of depending on a loose wire down the hallway 
to the teacher’s table, a signal wire can be run under the floor and

emerge at the right places with practically no expense. This will 
always be ready and save much annoyance. The seats in this room 
should be of the opera type, with two aisles in the central part and 
one on each side. There should be two doors opening from this room 
into the hall, as indicated. This will prevent crowding, save time, 
and make it possible for the room to be used for other classes even 
while the laboratories are in use. 
If the windows, in case lateral lighting is used, are placed 4 feet 
above the main-floor level, the rear of the inclined floor will not 
seriously obstruct the light, for 3 feet rise will be ample to insure to 
each student a chance for unobstructed observation. It is needless 
to say that the location of the electric or other lights, permitting the 
use of the room at night, is a matter of importance but must be left 
to the architect and the principal to work out. 
FLOORS. 
The laboratory floors, especially on the chemistry side, are mat- 
ters of rather serious concern. Cement is heavy, expensive, and 
both hard and cold. But it is safer than wood. It can be scrubbed 
without harm and can be replaced when worn. Perhaps the best 
floor that can be constructed for a chemical laboratory is that made 
by laying hard-baked glazed tiles in cement. These tiles when of 
good quality are nonporous, nonabsorbent, acid proof, and are 
easily cleaned. They are durable, and when planned with due re- 
spect to artistic effect give to the laboratory a clean, neat, and whole- 
some appearance. A laboratory in which this material is used for 
the floor is rendered still more artistic and aseptic by using the 
same material for wainscoting. This material is rather expensive 
when considering the initial cost. Consequently it will be used spar- 
ingly save in fireproof construction and in those wealthier com- 
munities which can afford the best. In the long run such a floor is 
economical, for it is easily cleaned and lasts indefinitely when prop- 
erly set. 
Another form of floor covering consisting of cement and broken 
bits of marble mixed evenly and then polished to a level surface has 
been used, but this is subject to injury by acids, and is both hard and 
cold. Some builders have used a good quality of cement, and with 
due precaution such floors have proved fairly satisfactory. They 
are, however, porous, will in time stain and discolor, and will also 
suffer from acids. 
When any of the fireproof floors are used it is well to surround the 
work tables with some form of linoleum to protect the feet of the 
students from the cold floor and to lessen the fatigue incident to long 
standing on a hard surface.  
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
If wooden floors are used in a chemical laboratory, they should be 
protected by wax, paraflin, or some such material. Wherever 
finances will permit, and especially in a brick, stone, or concrete 
building, the use of tile floors is strongly recommended. 
Floors made of asphaltum are recommended by Professor Gill. 
“ But,” as he remarks, “ there is danger that heavy tables, chairs, etc., 
will sink into the asphaltum and thus render them of unstable bal- 
ance and out of level.” This, he suggests, may be partly overcome by 
making wide foot rests for such tables. Naturally this sort of floor 
must be laid on the top of a close-fitting underfloor and separated 
from it by tarred paper, asbestos board, or some form of steel lath. 
In every case where a laboratory is on the second floor all possible 
leakage from water pipes or basins must be prevented, and this is 
best done by taking care in construction. 
The late Doctor Baskerville, formerly of the College of the City of 
New York (Science n. s. 28, p. 665 f.), said: 
In my opinion, the best material for floors which has been put forward is that 
which is known as lithoplast, devised by Dr. W. L. Dudley, of Vanderbilt Uni- 
versity. It is essentially a paraffined sawdust-sand floor, with a magnesia 
cement. This flooring may be laid in any length and in one piece and offers 
many desirable qualities. The baseboard may be made as a part of this floor. 
There are no cracks. The presence of the sawdust allows of its expansion and 
contraction with changes of temperature and the coating of paraffin over it 
prevents its rotting or napping, which are objections put forward in opposition 
to sawdust. It may be tinted, polished, washed, or scrubbed. It can be re- 
paired without having cracked points, and, furthermore, it allows nails and 
screws to be driven into it in much the same way as wood does. 
When it comes to a consideration of the material to be used for the 
tops of the laboratory tables, a more difficult problem must be con- 
fronted. It is without doubt true that all, or nearly all, of the older 
tables used for this purpose had wooden tops, and as a result of habit 
in the making of other tables oak or some more expensive material 
was used and finished with much care for appearance sake. But, as 
all who have worked in a chemical laboratory know, it is only a mat- 
ter of weeks until such tables are blistered, stained, or discolored until 
they are unsightly, and it seems unnecessary to use expensive lumber 
and go to the trouble of polishing and varnishing it, as is done with 
furniture in general. Good, clear pine, free from pitch, is about as 
serviceable as oak. Naturally, there is some danger in the use of 
wood, but it causes less breakage of test tubes and beakers than 
almost any other material used. It is not so cold as glass, tile, or 
slate, and hence does not endanger glass apparatus as much. 
Theoretically, plate glass is the most satisfactory material for table 
tops, for it does not stain, is easily kept clean, is nonabsorbent, is not 
affected by acids in ordinary use, and from the standpoint of wear
-P-A-G-E-93
LABORATORIES. 83 
is durable. The only objections of serious importance that can be 
offered against the use of glass for this purpose are that it is cold 
and hard and is liable to crack from the heat reflected from the bot- 
tom of vessels heated during experimental work. This latter is 
such a serious objection that it seems wise to caution against its use. 
Professor Gill says: 
For the tops of laboratory desks or tables the following woods have been 
found to give good satisfaction: Northern pine, whitewood, cedar, and Cali- 
fornia redwood. These may be finished with equal parts of linseed oil and tur- 
pentine, or better, filled with aniline black made in the pores of the wood. 
It may be added here that sugar pine is an ideal wood for table 
tops for laboratories, for this wood does not readily warp. It can 
be had in boards wide enough for a full top, and so will leave no 
cracks. It does not splinter, can be planed easily, readily takes the 
stain and filling noted above, and is not heavy. Unfortunately, the 
great trees from which such lumber is made are rapidly disappear- 
ing, and therefore the lumber is comparatively expensive. 
Mr. Lincoln, of the Technical High School of Springfield, Mass., 
says that he prefers wood as material for table tops for beginners 
in chemistry on account of the danger of increased breakage with 
the use of harder surfaces, but personally prefers white glazed tiles 
if they can be laid so that they will not buckle. When wood is used, 
he prefers soft pine treated in the following way (which is the same 
as that recommended by Professor Gill) : 
Recipe for treating tops of laboratory tables. 
Solution 1: 
100 grams aniline hydrochloride, 
40 grams ammonium chloride, 
650 grams water. 
Solution 2: 
100 grams copper sulphate, 
50 grams potassium chlorate, 
615 grams water. 
Apply solution 1, let it dry, then apply solution 2 and let it dry. Do this 
three times. 
During this process the color changes from green to black. The table top 
is then washed with hot soap solution, allowed to dry, then rubbed down with 
vaseline. After this last the color of the table top is a soft deep black. 
The tables treated as above have given very good service. They are wiped 
with a damp cloth each day after the laboratory work is over. 
WALLS. 
In a chemical laboratory it is important that the walls be so con- 
structed that the material composing them will neither discolor 
nor disintegrate as a result of the fumes liberated in experimental 
work. The ordinary plastered walls are very unsatisfactory, for 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
84 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
this disintegration begins quickly, and not only litters the floor 
but causes the room to appear untidy as a result of the rough and 
stringy appearance of the plaster. In laboratories where any quan- 
titive work is done this falling material will vitiate results and cause 
much trouble. In sections of the country where earthquakes occur 
the plastering so affected is likely to fall and is therefore dangerous. 
The same is true in the event of fire. The use of cement instead of 
ordinary plaster is followed by similar troubles. 
Hard-glazed tiles are clean, durable, neat, and acid proof, and 
when carefully selected and well set are easily cleaned and are also 
attractive in appearance. Glazed white brick is still more to be 
desired, but is expensive, and for inner walls adds considerably to 
the strength necessary in the building. Unglazed bricks may be 
used, but need to be covered with an acid-proof white or cream- 
colored paint. Professor Gill recommends for such purpose a paint 
made of “sublimed lead (PbSO,), barytes, or zine white, or pref- 
erably a mixture of these in about equal proportions.” 
On the whole, despite the added danger due to the inflammable 
material, a ceiling made of well-seasoned pine or maple, carefully 
tongued and grooved with the boards not more than 3 inches 
wide, blind nailed and then treated with acid-proof paint, seems best 
adapted to a chemical laboratory for high schools. This is, in its 
initial cost, more expensive than plaster, but in the end it is cheaper 
and much more satisfactory. 
Where plaster must be used “ white plaster, which has been given 
three coats of acid sulphur-proof paint, a combination of lithopone 
and zinc oxide, has proved satisfactory. Paints which contain lead 
oxide should be avoided. All metal ware which is likely to be 
exposed to any fumes whatever in the laboratory should be painted 
with an acid-proof paint.” 
In the plan presented to indicate the proper arrangement of the 
science rooms, it will be noticed that the main aisle is along the wall 
away from the windows, and along the track laid in the floor. The 
tables in the laboratories ought to be placed at right angles to the 
main aisle, with individual work spaces and plumbing on each side. 
This will insure good light and better classification of the workers. 
The secondary aisles between tables can be made as wide as space 
will permit; but they should be at least 5 feet. 
Further discussion of the arrangement of science rooms seems 
unnecessary, for equipment and plumbing are matters which school 
authorities must settle for each individual case. This further point, 
however, ought to be emphasized: It is a serious menace to the health 
of the students to work in a chemical laboratory which is not pro- 
vided with adequate means for carrying off the fumes and keeping
-P-A-G-E-95

the air pure and clean. Therefore, directly above the tables upon 
which the experiments are performed ducts should be placed to carry 
off the gases liberated in the experimental work. In small labora- 
tories gas jets kept burning within the main part of the duct will 
create a fairly good draft and in this way help to keep the air pure. 
But in a larger room where many students are engaged and the 
system of ducts rather complicated, it is best to place in the pipes 
between the roof and the ceiling a small exhaust fan with an electric 
motor attachment to be run during the laboratory periods. This fan 
must be firmly bedded so as not to jar or buzz while running, and 
the branching ducts must be as free as possible from sharp angles, 
and air-tight between the openings above the tables and the outer air 
above the roof. 
XVI. ASSEMBLY ROOMS. 
The assembly room, or aula, as it is called, is the center of school 
life for a German gymnasium. It is the place of all places in the 
school where artistic and even lavish decoration is the rule. It is 
the historic remnant of the days when churches and chapels were 
used as gathering places for students, and it has retained some of 
the religious atmosphere of those bygone days. They gather here 
for music, for worship, for lectures, for counsel, or for some celebra- 
tion. Stained glass windows, beautiful mural paintings, tasteful 
pieces of statuary, and very frequently a pipe organ attest the fact 
that this room is designed to be used for important educational 
purposes. 
We have made rapid progress in supplying assembly rooms for 
both high schools and grammar schools since the earlier edition of 
this bulletin was printed. The illustrations of assembly rooms here- 
with presented should arouse our pride, for they are as beautiful and 
commodious as many of our best theaters. But for our smaller and 
medium-sized high schools we are not yet demanding what we should 
in this regard. It is earnestly hoped that the illustrations here re- 
produced will serve to stimulate to further efforts to secure for all 
schools this much needed and very helpful agency. 
There is no desire to overestimate the need of assembly rooms in 
the American public high school, but I believe there is no country in 
the world where the need of social unification, artistic refinement, and 
cooperation is more pressing than in our country, under our form 
of government. Loyalty to athletic prowess is a good thing, but there 
is need for a deeper, more fundamental loyalty to school, to scholarly 
ideals, and to the community; and an artistic assembly room will 
greatly contribute to these ends. Every high-school building, then, 
ought to be built to meet this need. In addition to the uses above

suggested it will be a great stimulus to boys and girls in the grades 
if they also can occasionally share in the use of these rooms. Wise 
supervision of city schools demands closer contact between the chil- 
dren of the grades, especially the upper grades, and those of the high 
school. It would be a powerful stimulus to many boys to endeavor 
to enter the high school if now and then they could get a peep into the 
Jaboratories and assembly rooms of which they sometimes hear but 
which they rarely or never see. Moreover, around the school, as has 
been suggested, are gathering many organizations for social service 
looking to immediate help in practical citizenship. An assembly 
room, properly and tenaciously guarded against those who have sel- 
_fish ends to serve, can become the rallying point for the general educa- 
tional movements in the community. Such use of a school building 
will not desecrate it, and can, if wisely directed, be of great service in 
connecting school work with the real and vital problems of the com- 
munity. 
Having said so much in general—and these arguments are often 
needed to convince those in authority of the importance of supplying 
an assembly room—let us now turn to the actual demands of con- 
struction. 
The first question to consider is its location in the building. The 
prevailing practice in the older buildings was to put it on the second 
floor, but this is passing away, for surely the first floor is a 
better place. This location saves much wear on the building, in that 
it enables large audiences to gather without threading hallways or 
climbing stairs. It makes it easier to start the day’s work with an 
assembly, and in this way gives opportunities for announcements by 
the principal, for the inspiration of song, readings, or short ad- 
dresses. It is safer in case of fire; permits of easy entrance from 
the second floor to the gallery, if one is introduced; and allows 
ample height for the stage and for the ceiling above the gallery 
without interfering with a uniform scheme for roofing. It also in- 
sures a safer and stronger building for large audiences and gives a 
better opportunity to heat and ventilate it properly. By thus using 
the height of two stories, the floor of the main room as well as that 
of the gallery can be inclined without interfering with any other 
part of the structure, and extra exits can be arranged with little 
expense and without marring the architectural effect of the build- 
ing as a whole. This position will also have the advantage of the 
wider hallways, and exits below and will thus avoid crowding in 
the halls and on the stairways. If situated in the central axis of 
the building and opposite the main entrance, it will give a unity 
and dignity to the interior not possible when on the second floor. 
The floor plans and cuts herewith presented illustrate the arrange-
-P-A-G-E-97
  ASSEMBLY ROOMS. 87 
ment of assembly rooms for large buildings and also for smaller 
buildings. 
An assembly room should be provided with a stage of ample pro- 
portions. Upon this stage the young people will gather on gradua- 
tion day to receive their diplomas; upon it they will give their plays, 
choruses, and recitals; from it they can hear lectures and concerts 
by visiting talent; and in many ways there will be need for a roomy, 
and safely built stage. There should be dressing or retiring rooms 
at both ends of the stage and on the same level with it. 
Some interesting plans, especially those designed by William B. 
Ittner, of St. Louis, show an enlarged stage equipped as a gym- 
nasium. With means of a temporary partition or drop curtain this 
may be reduced to the ordinary sized stage or opened up to the audi- 
ence as a gymnasium. In this connection the following from Bulle- 
tin (1922) No. 23 of the United States Bureau of Education says: 
Experience has proved that it is altogether feasible to expand the stage to 
the size of a standard gymnasium and by this method to increase the seating 
capacity of the auditorium whenever desired. The combination stage-gym- 
nasium also has other advantages. It gives opportunity to view physial edu- 
cational exhibitions from the auditorium and makes provision for large 
choruses, symphony concerts, and community activities for which an ordinary 
stage is always inadequate.‘ 
All assembly rooms call for ample light, and the stage should have 
windows, but placed so high that they can not be seen by. the audi- 
ence. (In large schools there should be a gallery so constructed as 
to require as few supports from the main floor as possible, and built 
with due care for the demands of acoustics.) The lighting of an 
assembly hall is an important feature in its usefulness and should be 
given careful consideration. If, as has been suggested, this room is 
placed on the central axis of the building and on the ground floor, 
light can be had from both sides, above and below the gallery. 
In village and country high schools there is as much or more need, 
comparatively speaking, for assembly halls as in cities with more 
pretentious buildings, and yet under the stress of financial conditions 
they are often eliminated from the plans for the smaller schools. 
The accompanying floor plans for a small building (fig. 7) were 
drawn with this difficulty in mind, and the hallway has been widened 
so as to serve both for a passageway and an assembly room. It will 
be observed that the hall is shorter than the wings of the building 
and ends in a raised platform or stage, which can be cut off by fold- 
ing or sliding doors and used as a library, principal’s office, and a

stage. An open fire in the center will make it attractive from 
within the office, and also from the assembly hall. It will be noticed 
that cloakrooms are connected with each room so as to keep the hall 
clear. Movable chairs can be used and quickly arranged when 
needed and crowded together when a wider passageway is required 
along the sides or across the hall to facilitate the movement of the 
,students between recitations. Provision can easily be made in the 
event that this room is desired for a study room. The ceiling of the 
assembly room is high, is finished to show the timbers, and is lighted 
from above. I am indebted to Mr. Bernard Maybeck, architect, 
Berkeley, Calif., for the drawings. This building can be built of 
wood, plastered on the outside or shingled, or of brick or stone. It 
does not readily lend itself to a painted clapboard construction. It

should be made to blend with the landscape, and when covered with 
vines will make a charming village high school for the accommoda- 
tion of 75 to 100.students. The only serious diticulties to contend 
with are the long valleys in the roofs at each side of the assembly 
room, and, in the hotter parts of the country, the lack of a cross 
breeze in the lower part of the assembly room. 
It is characteristic of an American community to expect of the 
architect more school accomodations than the money allowed him 
will buy. Amost invariably the demand comes for an assembly 
room and very frequently for a gymnasium, and yet not more than 
half enough money is voted or set aside for the construction of the 
building desired. It has therefore become necessary to sacrifice 
some features of the building demanded or to insist on waiting 
until sufficient funds are in hand to do what the community wishes.
-P-A-G-E-99
SCHOOL ARCHITECTURE AND IMPROVEMENT, 89 
All schools in city or country need some sort of an assembly 
room where the school children may congregate or where the whole 
community may join in entertainments or more serious educational 
undertakings. But a room built only for an assembly, with a slop- 
ing floor and. fixed chairs is used too infrequently in small to 
medium-sized schools to warrant this heavy outlay. So it has be- 
come necessary to plan an assembly room with a level floor, without 
fixed seats and with a sufficiently high ceiling, that it may be used 
for a gymnasium as well as for mere assembly purposes. One of 
the chief difficulties with this has been the trouble of handling 
chairs. To get them out of the way for gymnasium exercises and to 
replace them again for assembly purposes has been a serious prob- 
lem. Much relief, however, has come by building a stage a little 
higher than ordinary, so framing it that stalls can be made under 
it facing the assembly floor, and small trucks, the width of a folding 
chair and the length of the depth of the stage, constructed with 
counter-sunk casters, upon which to place the chairs and run them 
under the stage when not needed. These little trucks or cars are 
not expensive to make, they require only a groove on either side 
under the stage upon which to run the casters, and posts at each end 
to prevent the chairs from sliding off. One of these will hold some- 
times as many as a hundred chairs and thus practically all of the 
chairs can be cared for by using a few trucks. When chairs are to 
be removed from the floor, the trucks are run out into the room; 
the chairs are picked up and placed on the trucks in an orderly 
way, and then pushed under the stage. Vice versa when chairs are 
needed the trucks can be pulled out onto the floor and the chairs 
placed quickly as required. Naturally double doors are set in front 
of the stalls to close them when the chairs are removed or returned. 
This device has been used for a number of years. It has made an 
assembly room serve assembly, gymnasium, and social purposes, to 
say nothing of exhibitions or fairs. Thus the value of this room and 
the income from the investment have been multiplied many fold.

This is the age of schools and schoolhouses as characteristically as 
the latter part of the Middle Ages was the period of churches and 
great church buildings. In each case the faith and fervor of the 
people can be read and fairly understood through a critical study of 
these objective results and the ideals for which they stand. It will 
not miss the mark very far to say that our ideals and feelings asso- 
ciated with the notion of popular education are becoming suffused 
with a glow ana zeal heretofore only found associated directly or
-P-A-G-E-100

indirectly with religious faith and religious propaganda. And some- 
thing of the same spirit that once wrought to build a tabernacle or a 
cathedral worthy of a dwelling place of the Most High is seeking 
expression in furnishing to the youth of our land nobler temples in 
which their hearts, minds, and bodies may better adjust themselves 
to the demands of a practical civic brotherhood.. Whoever, then, un- 
dertakes to build a schoolhouse to meet and foster these ideals ought 
to approach his task with holy hands and a consciousness of the 
devotion which it is to typify. 
The problem, then, of building a schoolhouse to-day is in no small 
sense complicated by the growing tendency to use schoolhouses for all 
sorts of attempts at social betterment. Schoolhouses, especially in 
the large cities, have come to be used night and day, summer and 
winter. Vacation schools have-been established, in which unusual 
programs of work and play have been introduced, and for their 
successful consummation such programs often demand equipment 
and accommodations not needed in the regular day schools. Lecture 
courses have been introduced not primarily for school children but 
for those who have quit school and gone to work, for those adults who 
have a desire to keep up their intellectual interests, and for those also 
who have sufficient spiritual pride to begin even late in life. But 
such buildings demand special equipment in the way of lighting, 
stereopticons, photographic rooms, assembly halls readily accessible, 
chairs, platforms, moving-picture machines, etc. 
Manual and technical training courses have been introduced, de- 
manding power plants not heretofore needed, or at least not thought 
desirable. Playgrounds are in greater demand, not only for the reg- 
» ular school children, but for those who for various reasons are denied 
school privileges through the day. Such children may come in the 
evening, after school hours, or on holidays. This demand for greater 
space and better adjustment led to roof playgrounds on school build- 
ings. But no sooner had they been built than it was discovered that 
such favored and well-ventilated areas could be utilized as social 
gathering places, where good music could be heard, where the young 
people could meet and enjoy social dances under wholesome and safe 
environments, and where society could institute rational competition 
with the cheap vulgar shows and dangerous dance halls rampant on 
the streets below. 
There are social movements in almost every community in our 
country to-day looking toward educational betterment, and such 
movements should be fostered, guided, and rationalized. Whenever 
these are for any worthy reason disconnected from church organiza- 
tions, either the public-library building, some building designed espe- 
cially for social workers, or the public-school buildings ought to be 
available as a center for such workers. :
-P-A-G-E-101
  SCHOOL ARCHITECTURE AND IMPROVEMENT, 91 
The school building has many advantages, for it is the citadel of a 
democracy, and there has developed about it a sentiment of dignity 
and decorum, influential in all movements undertaken within its pre- 
cincts. Furthermore, the use of these buildings for worthy social 
work of all kinds is bringing school work into more vital touch with 
the real life of the world; vice versa, it is bringing the American 
community into a more vital relation with the teachers and those who 
are responsible for schools and school organization. 
In planning even a country schoolhouse or village high-school 
building, one must therefore think out into the possible needs of the 
community and enlarge his usual notions of the scope and purpose of 
public-school education. 
Some day in the near future more pains will be taken to make 
schoolhouses beautiful in external appearance as well as commodious 
and healthful within. Thus far the architects of the large majority 
of our smaller school buildings have clung tenaciously to the “ school- 
house type,” and have given us, in the main, buildings devoid of any 
attempt at niceties of proportion or unity of design. In many cases 
attempts at cheap ornamentation have been made at the expense of 
real beauty of form and hygienic considerations. 
It seems strange, on first thought, that our schoolhouses have been 
the last of public buildings through which public taste has sought to 
express itself. But when one recalls that this tardy recognition of 
children’s rights has exhibited itself in all lines of endeavor wherein 
the education and care of children were concerned, a fundamental 
phase of human nature is brought into light. Adults have regularly 
thought and planned first for the satisfaction of their own needs © 
rather than those of the children. If the reader is inclined to doubt 
this, let him make a study of the Sunday-school rooms of our 
churches and compare them with the rooms of the same buildings set 
apart in the main for the use of adults. Let him examine the homes 
and contrast the provisions made for adults with those for the chil- 
dren, and he will understand more clearly what I mean. Even 
children’s clothing is designed not so much for personal comfort, joy, 
and approval of children as for the satisfaction of older people. 
Precisely for the same reason that the education of children at public 
expense has been, in the main, the last phase in the development of 
our educational systems, we may expect that schoolhouses for the 
little children will not receive so careful attention from the general 
public in our generation as those designed for college students or 
students of our secondary schools. But a protest should be entered 
against this selfishness and, at the same time, a plea made for the 
esthetic education of the children and through them the develop- 
ment of an enlightened conscience and artistic sense in the public
-P-A-G-E-102

at large. The school buildings in which our children spend a great 
part of their working hours during their early years deserve serious 
attention and artistic treatment. Art leagues desiring to promote 
civic improvement should offer artistic and well-adapted plans of 
country schoolhouses for the consideration of those who have charge 
of the construction of such buildings. 
Such plans should be simple and easily followed. They should call 
for materials within the reach of local markets or conditions. Coun- 
try schoolhouses are, in the main, built by “ hatchet-and-saw ” car- 
penters who can not read complicated drawings or follow readily the 
usual forms of specifications. Proportion in such buildings is almost 
everything, and to secure this end plans ought to be drawn and 
specifications devised so explicitly that no mistake can be made. No 
amount of interior decoration will offset the bad effect of exterior 
ugliness. 
If country people are inclined to be careless about the appearance 
of their schoolhouses and school grounds, and we all know that this 
is often the case, it becomes a double duty for those who have better 
taste to exert themselves to place before them better models. Real 
beauty is not expensive. The best things are in reach of us all. Log 
cabins can be built as satisfying to the artistic sense as palaces, in- 
deed frequently more so. The planning of a one-story, one-room 
country schoolhouse ought to demand, and will demand from any 
capable and conscientious architect, as painstaking consideration as 
a large city school. In fact, the opportunity for the development 
and dissemination of taste in this, the central agency for social and 
wsthetic improvement in the country, ought to appeal with especial 
interest to all concerned. , 
Here is an account of the influence of one teacher “ who organized 
a community ” (World’s Work, vol. 5, p. 9601) : 
In September, 1904, Miss Mabel Carney, a young Irish girl just out of normal 
school, began teaching in a country school in Putnam County, Ill. Her pupils 
were few, the building dilapidated and poorly equipped, the site unattractive, 
but she was a teacher of practical ideas. Two neighboring schools were in a 
condition equally bad, and Miss Carney went to work on a plan of consolida- 
tion. She talked consolidation of these three inefficient country schools until 
she had won hearers enough to put the question to a vote in the spring of 1905. 
The electors voted down the proposition that year, but the young teacher’s 
consolidation plan was adopted at the election in 1906. Here are some of the 
concrete results: Mr. John Swaney, a public-spirited citizen, gave 24 acres for 
a campus—a campus for a country school! The people of the*three districts 
voted $18,000 to make the building one of the best schoolhouses in Illinois. 
Wagons carry the children who are too remote from the building to walk. The 
principal of this country school is paid $1,000 a year. On the campus is an 
agricultural experiment plot of 6 acres, conducted in cooperation with the 
school of agriculture of the State university, and a large tract of natural forest. 
A four-year high-school course is offered, with a liberal election of studies. 
Country boys and girls may here study agriculture, animal husbandry, horticul-

ture, domestic science, and all phases of work vitally related to the fundamental 
means of a people living in the country. Culture subjects are not neglected, 
_but the real basic interests of culture among an agricultural people are given 
due emphasis. An enlarged country neighborhood has been bound into a co- 
operative social unity, whose possibilities for higher culture are not inferior to 
those of cities of 10,000 people. These are the products of two years’ work - 
of a young girl with the right ideals. 
Equal or more striking results have been achieved in all parts of 
the country since Miss Carney’s efforts. There has been a truly 
wonderful growth, especially in the rural districts, in the consolida- 
tion of schools and the use of the school building as an educational 
center for the whole community. Permit me to sketch very briefly 
and inadequately what has happened in one county in Alabama. 
Five years ago the author was called to advise with County Superin- 
tendent Feagin, of Montgomery County, Ala., to see what might be 
done in the way of consolidation in that county, especially looking 
toward the greater social unification of the white people in the rural 
communities. At that time the small village of Pike Roads had a 
miserable makeshift of a school building with two teachers in charge. 
The children were badly handicapped, and the teachers were so badly 
situated that they were unable to do satisfactory work. The con- 
ditions were deplorable. Fortunately, there was a desire in the com- 
munity for better things. Through the proper presentation of the 
needs of the school the people were induced to purchase a small farm 
of 35 acres adjoining the town. The county bonded itself to con- 
struct a modern school building and to consolidate at this place a 
great many districts. Automobile trucks were purchased, good 
teachers employed, and the children of a large area of the county 
were gathered in at this place. 
The change in the educational interest of the people and the 
progress of the children in this community, as well as the county 
at large, during the past few years are almost unbelievable. Bonds 
have now been voted to construct buildings of this type for all the 
white children of the county. In a few buildings the school children 
of a whole county will meet together. The spirit of educational 
progress has already called for a rural high-school edifice of a dis- 
tinctive and fine type, where the children of the county can get such 
preparation for advanced work as before was impossible. The 
effects of this socializing influence are radiating throughout the whole 
State. 
It has been the custom in many places in our country to build 
schoolhouses according to ready-made plans furnished by so-called 
architects and builders. These plans are rarely sufficiently accurate 
and complete to give any definite idea of what will result as the 
finished preduct. Their specifications are indefinite and not in- 
frequently in error, and trouble and extra expense result from attempt-
-P-A-G-E-104

94 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
ing to follow them. The sane and economical thing to do, even if only a 
one-story school building is to be erected, is to engage the services of a 
reliable, tasteful architect, and with him work out every detail before 
, the plan is finally accepted. School boards of towns and cities should 
give their teachers, or at least a committee from the teaching force, 
a large share in helping to plan their schoolhouses. It seems more 
than strange that members of a board of education who rarely have 
any intimate acquaintance with the demands and necessities of 
modern school buildings should, when called upon to erect new 
| buildings, neglect to avail themselves of the services of the experts 
| they have selected to do the school work. Boards of education often 
come together to consider plans which have been placed in competi- 
tion without so much as inviting a principal or superintendent to 
aid them. One by one the architects are called before the board to 
extol their products and point out the superiority of their respec- 
tive plans to all other possible plans. In general, the most plausible 
talker, with the gaudiest elevation and the greatest number of im- 
possible carriages passing the proposed building, generally gets the 
vote. If the floor plans are studied at all, they receive a mere 
glance, and generally from eyes unable to read them intelligently. 
The fact is the planning and building of schoolhouses is a highly 
specialized business and can not be safely left in the hands of men 
who know nothing about it. In every system of city schools, whether 
a regularly employed architect is available or not, the superin- 
tendent of schools should insist that a committee from the teaching 
staff should with him be empowered by the board to study plans and 
advise architects on all matters pertaining to arrangements most 
suitable for practical school work. This committee ought to be a 
standing committee, and should be in every way encouraged to study 
in detail schoolhouses from the educational point of view. It is 
certainly very poor economy to neglect to utilize the teachers’ inti- 
mate knowledge of what is needed. The same sort of a policy ought 
to be encouraged in villages and in country districts. County super- 
intendents ought to be given power to pass on all plans for school 
buildings; or, better still, they ought to have at command data from 
which architects can work , and then through advice and direction 
guide to better plans. 
In a large city system of schools where an architect is employed to 
make plans for all the schoolhouses to be built, and gives his whole 
time to this specialty, there is less waste and better results. And yet 
even these specialists can often profit from the suggestions teachers 
are able to give. But in the great majority of places there is no 
architect regularly employed, and few who know much about the 
special problems of school buildings. Under such conditions a cus- 
tom has sprung up of advertising for competitive plans, and then is 
 
-P-A-G-E-105

enacted the farce described above. Indeed, several States have made 
it compulsory for school boards to select plans in this way. There 
can be no question that this in general is a clumsy and ineffective 
method. The safe and businesslike thing to do is to engage an 
architect and let him work up a plan under guidance, so that when 
it is done it will be understood. The best architects rarely submit 
plans in competition. It is too expensive for them to prepare worthy 
plans on a mere chance. But school boards have a difficult political 
problem to meet when they select an architect, and the competition 
system has furnished them a means of forestalling criticism, and 
often of compelling the acceptance of unsuitable plans. Not one 
business block in a thousand is built after plans secured through 
competition, and the very men who serve on school boards would 
never manage their own business in this way. 
One of the most difficult problems, as elsewhere suggested, rises 
out of the fact that people think that a successful school building, 
designed for a particular place and orientated in a specific way, can 
be copied exactly, used on a different lot with a different orientation, 
and be as successful in the latter as the former position. This is a 
very great blunder. Each school building is a problem in itself. It 
has a definite lot upon which it is to be located; it must face in a 
given direction to meet the demands of this lot; and it must be de- 
signed to meet the educational needs of the peculiar and specific 
community. To be sure, one can get many suggestions and fre- 
quently specific helps in the study of successful architecture wher- 
ever found, but, in the last analysis, each school building should be 
designed practically to meet its environment both physical and 
educational. The sane, safe, and economical thing to do when a 
school building is to be erected on a specific lot is to employ an 
architect, demand a careful study of the location and the needs 
of the school, and then gradually and slowly work this out into 
sketches until all demands are approximately met. An honest, con- 
scientious architect, capable of preparing plans and specifications 
for a school building, will easily save enough to pay for his services 
and at the same time get a better building than could otherwise be 
expected. School architecture is a highly specialized line of work; 
and the planning and construction of schoolhouses demand the com- 
bined knowledge and skill of architects, superintendents, and teach- 
ers. Members of school boards rarely have time to study the needs 
of schools in detail and are rarely competent to select plans. They 
should depend on specialized knowledge and skill where so much is 
at stake, both financially and educationally. Fortunately this 
tendency is growing and in a large measure accounts for the grow- 
ing excellence of American schoolhouses.

APPENDIX. 
ORIENTATION OF BUILDINGS IN SOUTHERN STATES. 
For a number of years past there has been rather constant demands in 
various Southern States that windows of classrooms be opened toward the 
south, for school officials in these States have generally insisted that the 
prevailing breezes in the warmer part of the school year blow from the south. 
Naturally it was a legitimate demand to make as much provision as possible 
for alleviating the temperature in schoolrooms in the hot months but, at the 
same time, we were likely to introduce more difficulty with the necessity of 
having to pull down the shades to cut out the south sun than we should get 
relief from this orientation. 
In order to ascertain the truth of the matter, Mr. Roscoe Nunn, meteorologist 
in charge of the Nashville station of the Weather Bureau, was appealed to. 
He was kind enough to undertake this rather arduous task and sent question- 
naires to all the bureau stations of the 10 Southern States to get information 
as to the direction of the prevailing winds at each station for the hours of 8 
a. m. to 4 p. m. during the months of April, May, June, September, and 
October. These months cover the warm weather for most of the school year, 
and probably little change would occur in July and August. Through a study 
of these returns he worked out the following table:

1 Hourly data not available; therefore use the monthly prevailing direction. 
The general conclusions Mr. Nunn has reached, in addition to the data given 
in the foregoing table, may be represented by the following quotations: 
The records show a rather mixed distribution of air movement over the 
southern States, due principally to local topography and the varied conditions 
of exposure of wind vanes. But there are also regional characteristics of wind 
direction, due to geographical differences, the paths of general storms, and the 
distribution of mean temperature and mean atmospheric pressure. 
Topographical effect is shown clearly at Fort Smith, Ark., where the wind 
rarely blows for any length of time from any direction other than east, due to 
the trend of the valley in which the wind vane is located. This is the most 
conspicuous case of the kind among Weather Bureau stations in the Southern 
States, but doubtless other similar situations exist. In the highland and moun- 
tain districts of Tennessee, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia, the wind 
directions are evidently affected to some extent by the broken character of the 
land surface, ridges, and valleys; otherwise, it is difficult to account for some 
of the characteristics of the records at the several stations. The westerly com- 
ponent is prominent at Nashville, Knoxville, Atlanta, Asheville, Wytheville, 
and Lynchburg. 
The suggested regional distribution may be grouped as (1) the States of 
Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and western 
Alabama, where southerly winds, especially south and southeast, predominate 
decidedly throughout the period; (2) the eastern half (roughly) of the States 
of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, southern Alabama, and all 
of Florida, where the prevailing winds in spring and early summer are from 
the southwest and in September and October from the northeast; (3) the 
remaining portions of the Southern States, embracing Tennessee and the high- 
lands and mountainous portions of Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia, where 
the westerly component (southwest, west, and northwest) predominates. 
Means or averages of the data in the table, covering the whole area, are 
probably of little value. It is difficult to compute a correct mean from these 
data, as the sections of the area are disproportionately represented. However, 
it may be stated that, considering all the data in the table, we find that south- 
west is the most frequent direction recorded. This is followed by south, which 
is considerably less frequent; then by northwest, northeast, and southeast, of 
equal frequency but considerably Jess than south,
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 AMERICAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, 
If we take the States east of the Mississippi River we find southwest winds 
distinctly predominating, followed by northeast and northwest. Taking Arkan- 
sas, Oklahoma, and Texas, we find south strongly prevailing, with southeast next, 
and but little from any other direction. 
By months, considering the whole area, we find that southwest winds prevail 
in April, May, and June, and northeast in September and October; but south is 
a pretty strong second. 
But these groupings and averages are considered of no great value for 
guidance in the orientation of a schoolhouse in any particular locality. They do 
indicate that there is no strong prevalence of south winds except in Arkansas, 
Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana. Emphasis should be placed upon the ad- 
visability of making as thorough investigation as practicable of conditions in 
each locality in the preliminary plans for school buildings, and this generally 
can be done through near-by Weather Bureau stations. 
It is obvious that south windows would catch the breezes from the southeast, 
south, and southwest; west windows would catch them from the southwest, 
west and northwest. But west windows, it seems, are decidedly preferable from 
the standpoints of light and sanitation. Therefore, where the prevalence of 
south winds is very strong, as in the Southern States west of the Mississippi 
River, a choice of west or south windows may be difficult to make; but in the 
States east of the Mississippi River, generally speaking, it would seem that any 
sacrifice of other features to secure south breezes would be a mistake.

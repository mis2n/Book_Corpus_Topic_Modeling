  PREFACE 
ux present volume is the first of a series of books 
designed expressly for students of collegiate grade in 
professional schools for teachers. Forthcoming volumes 
of. the series will treat in detail the various subjects 
that are now recognized as important in the profes- 
sional education of teachers, including not only psychol- 
ogy, measurements, administration, management, curric- 
ulum-organization, and the technique of teaching, but 
also the materials of elementary and secondary educa- 
tion considered from the professional point of view. 
The books will be prepared by specialists in the several 
fields under the general direction of the editors. It is 
not intended, however, that the series shall reflect any 
single or exclusive theory of education. On the con- 
trary it is the hope of the editors that each book will 
have an individuality of its own, and that the series as 
‘a whole will represent a sincere and successful effort to 
treat the complicated problems of education with the 
tolerance, the catholicity, and the open-mindedness 
that their intricacy and their fundamental importance 
demand. : 
Inasmuch as the series will be the work of many 
persons, extended perhaps over many years, it will have 
an opportunity to realize this ideal in a measure that 
cannot be approached by this introductory volume. 
The writers trust, however, that the following chapters 
will be found not entirely devoid of the characteristics

just named. The aim has been, through a brief but 
comprehensive survey of the field, to orient the pros- 
/pective teacher with regard to the outstanding prob- 
lems of education, to give him a balanced perspective 
on disputed issues, to develop in an initial way the 
meanings of the more important technical terms that 
his later studies will involve, and to make easier on his 
part an intelligent choice of a specific field of service. 
The first chapter sets forth the advantages and dis- 
advantages of teaching as an occupation. Following 
this, an effort is made to explain in simple and concrete 
terms the essential nature of teaching and learning, and 
in doing this to bring to the student’s attention some 
of the basic problems with which educational theory is 
concerned. The materials of universal education are 
next considered primarily for the purpose of showing 
how these materials have evolved and why they have 
been accorded so important a place in the programs of 
the elementary and secondary schools. Succeeding 
chapters provide an introductory treatment of the psy- 
chology of teaching and learning. Here, in connection 
with each of the larger problems, typical school prac- 
tices are described and discussed. Chapter X deals 
with public education as a vast social enterprise, and 
aims to encourage the student to build up an adequate 
mental picture of the highly organized service that he 
is planning to enter. Two concluding chapters consider 
the personal qualifications important in teaching and 
the specific qualifications needed for each of the major 
divisions of the teaching service. 
At the end of each chapter are suggestions for further

reading and a brief list of questions, exercises, and 
problems. The suggested readings are in no sense com- 
plete bibliographies of the topics treated in the chapters. 
The references are chiefly either to non-technical books 
and articles or to the more elementary technical liter- 
ature. It is assumed that other courses will go far more 
deeply into the various topics. Indeed, one justifica- 
tion of a general introductory course lies in the fact 
that it should make possible in the later courses (espe- 
cially in the extended curricula) a more advanced, in- 
tensive, and thoroughgoing treatment than could other- 
wise be given. 
For advice, criticism, and encouragement in the prepa- 
ration of the book the writers are under a heavy debt 
to a large number of their fellow-teachers and to a host 
of students. A course dealing with the same problem 
was given in the School of Education of the Univer- 
sity of Illinois by one of the writers during the years 
1908-1917. Many of the chapters of the book have been 
presented for criticism to successive classes of normal- 
school teachers engaged in graduate study at Teachers 
College, Columbia University. Specific and detailed 
criticisms of the manuscript have been made by Miss 
Jane McGrath and Mr. M. J. Walsh of the Indiana, 
Pennsylvania, State Normal School, by Miss Rosamond 
Root and Professor I. L. Kandel of Teachers College, 
Columbia University, and by Professor Thomas Alex- 
ander of the George Peabody College for Teachers. The 
writers are also indebted to Miss Adrienne Moukad and 
Miss Frances M. Burke for aid in preparing the manu- 
script for the press.

  AN INTRODUCTION TO 
TEACHING 
CuaprTer I 
TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 
TEACHING is a fascinating occupation. This is the 
verdict of conscientious and successful teachers every- 
where. Not all of these teachers can-tell_just-why they 
find their work attractive. Likings of all sorts are diffi- 
cult to analyze. Often their roots lie very deep, — far 
beyond the limits to which even the most sincere at- 
tempts at self-examination can carry one. Undoubt- 
edly some of the causes-that-would-explain the attrac- 
tiveness of teaching must: be sought-in-these-deep-lying 
and fundamental impulses. | The teacher is in constant 
) contact with youth, and it is natural for the adult to be 
attracted to and interested in the young, it is in- 
stinctive for the mature to protect and care for the 
immature. @ conditio i 
a and develop this impulse.\} It_is_an exacting 
responsibility _and_makes—a—eonstant—demand—for—the 
most devoted service; it_is in rendering such service’ 
many people find the richest and mast satisfying_ 
values of life. 
The contagion of youth. — Nor is this all. Inevit- 
ably the teacher responds moe buoyancy and hope and Cacf- 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  
  2 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
enthusiasm that are the natural attributes of childhood 
and adolescence. Good teachers stay young through 
the very contagion of youth. They may grow old in 
years, but in no other occupation does one have the same 
stimulus and opportunity to remain young in attitude 
and enthusiasm. Youth rebuilds its spirit and its dream 
in its devoted teachers. 
\~ New problems are continually presented. — Another 
reason for the fascination of teaching doubtless lies in 
the new problems that it continually presents. Though 
‘a teacher may spend his or her entire working life in one 
apparently narrow field of service, —a fourth-grade 
room, or a rural school, or the English department of a 
high oy — every class is a new and different class, 
every pupil is different from all other pupils. There is a 
never-ending variety in the human materials with which 
the teacher deals, and this means a never-ending variety 
in the problems that must be solved. Monotonous, 
mechanized work takes on the soul-killing qualities of 
drudgery, and while there is much necessary (and very 
important) routine work connected with teaching, this 
need never be for the teacher a purely mechanical process. 
There is always the possibility of improvement, — of 
doing even the simplest tasks better than one has done 
them before. 
Teaching stimulates the teacher’s mental growth. 
Successful teachers also find a source of continuous 
growth in the materials other than human with which 
they deal,—in the subject-matter that they teach. 
Even upon the lowest age-levels of education, these 
materials are rich and abundant. It is a very serious  
-P-A-G-E-15
  TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 3 
mistake to think of the elementary-school subjects as 
simple and rudimentary; they are, rather, elemental and 
fundamental. If one studies them aright, they lead out 
readily and quickly into fields of discovery and investi- 
gation that may well challenge the keenest intellect. 
Successful teachers make numerous excursions into these 
fields, and come back to their young charges with a fresh 
equipment. They see old truths in new Ways; and this 
again is a source both of keen enjoyment and of an 
invigorating mental growth. 
Teaching an essential “productive” occupation. — Con- 
scientious and successful teachers find an abounding 
satisfaction in the social significance of their work. Not 
only is teaching a field that is replete with opportunities 
for serving one’s fellows, but the service that it renders 
is indispensable to the life of the community, the state, 
and the nation. The school, indeed, is the most char- 
acteristic feature of modern civilization. Universal ele- 
mentary education is admitted by all to be the corner 
stone of an effective democracy, and democracy is the 
predominant form of social organization among the 
civilized peoples of the modern world. Teaching, then, 
is not only an important occupation; under the condi- 
tions of modern life it is an absolutely essential occupa- 
tion. The teacher is actually and essentially a producer, 
— not a producer directly of food or shelter or clothing, 
which are sometimes thought of as the basic life-neces- 
sities, — but a producer of that trained and informed 
intelligence without which, on a nation-wide and even 
world-wide scale, modern civilization will quickly crumble 
into ruin.
-P-A-G-E-16
Q AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
  Teachers as a group have important collective respon- 
sibilities. — Teachers who take their work seriously are 
coming to appreciate more and more keenly this essential 
social value of their work. They recognize, too, that 
their obligations extend far beyond the limits of their 
classrooms. They recognize that they and their fellows 
constitute a company of workers. to whom a very im- 
portant collective duty has been delegated. They must 
think clearly regarding the aims that they should strive 
to realize. They must formulate well-matured policies 
which in their judgment should govern the work of the 
schools. They must place these policies as clearly and - 
cogently as possible before the people as a whole, with 
whom, under the conditions of a democratic social order, 
the final decision will rest. This growth of a eroleeeat 
consciousness and the parallel development of a sense 
of collective responsibility for the guidance of a funda- 
mental social institution are contributing much to. the 
attractiveness of teaching as a life-career. 
Some persons to whom the work of teaching will not 
be attractive. — It goes without saying that the advan- 
tages of teaching as a life-occupation will not appeal to 
everyone. ‘There is to-day so wide a diversity of human 
occupations that young people may ‘‘pick and choose” 
to a degree that was quite unknown in former genera- 
tions; and while a hasty decision on the basis of a super- 
ficial acquaintance with this or that field of work is not 
to be encouraged, nothing is more certain than that one 
should avoid a calling for which one is hopelessly dis- 
qualified. Sometimes these disqualifications are due to 
desires and ambitions that the calling cannot satisfy;
-P-A-G-E-17
  TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 5 
sometimes they are due to temperamental traits which 
stand in the way of effective work; sometimes they are 
due to a lack of native ability for which no amount of 
training can provide a substitute. 
Teaching will not satisfy certain types of ambition. — 
It is only fair to say that a person whose chief ambition 
is to achieve a wide public recognition — to ‘‘win fame” 
—will find in teaching as such few opportunities for 
realizing his heart’s desire. Many of the most success- 
ful teachers are unknown outside of the neighborhoods 
in which they serve. Others who are known in wider 
areas are known only to their fellow-workers and not to 
the public generally. Men and women who teach have 
not. infrequently achieved wide renown in the field 
of scholarship, —as investigators and writers, — but 
only in the rarest cases as teachers. Others, whose 
earlier work in life has been that of the teacher, have 
won fame as executives, — as builders of great educa- 
tional institutions, — but their teaching, though often 
markedly successful, did not bring them fame. Still 
others have left the work of teaching and have found 
in business, law, or politics a measure of public recog- 
nition which was never accorded to them as teachers. 
To what extent these facts constitute a handicap to the 
teaching service it would be difficult to say; but life is full 
of compensations. Fame is a fickle mistress, and wide 
fame, by its very nature, can come to but few individ- 
uals. Equally certain it is that the distinctive values 
which the teacher’s work involves are substantial and 
enduring; nor is their possession limited to a few indi- 
viduals. 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The financial handicap of teaching. — Teaching has 
the ill repute of being an underpaid occupation. This 
bad reputation is in part unjustified. The general level 
of teachers’ salaries, taking the country as a whole, is 
not high, but this is due in part to the meager compen- 
sation of a large group of teachers — nearly one half of 
the total number — who serve in the schools of the open 
country and the small villages. As a group, these rural- 
school and village teachers are immature, untrained, and 
transient in the profession; yet they are so numerous 
that their low wages have a most seriously depressing 
effect on the general average. The relatively permanent 
and far better prepared teachers. of the towns and cities 
are much better paid, and although the general level of 
teachers’ salaries, even in these communities, is still 
below what it should be, the prospects for its gradual 
advancement are favorable. Under the best of condi- 
tions, however, teaching cannot be expected to offer the 
opportunities for large financial returns that certain 
other occupations offer, and those persons whose am- 
bitions can be satisfied only by the accumulation of 
wealth scarcely need be urged to select another calling. 
Those who seek riches of a different sort will find them 
in abundance in the teaching service; and even the 
material rewards, modest though they may be, have a 
certainty and a stability that more lucrative employ- 
ments seldom afford. 
Certain temperamental characteristics that interfere with 
success in teaching. — Men and women who are at- 
tracted to the work of teaching by one or more of the 
advantages mentioned earlier in this chapter sometimes
-P-A-G-E-19
  on 
TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION - 7 
find themselves disqualified for the service by tempera- 
mental defects that stand squarely across the path of 
success. Often they lack patience. They are irritated 
by the slowness with which some of their pupils learn, 
and this constant irritation gives a sharp edge to their 
tempers. They may lack, too, that indefinable quality 
known as tact which is so important in all occupations 
in which the human contacts are frequent and intimate. 
They may have any one of a half-dozen personal defects, 
which would not interfere in the slightest measure with 
success in certain other fields, but which none the less 
constitute a serious handicap to success in teaching. 
Not all of these personal and temperamental defects are 
irremediable, and many teachers who have failed in the 
earlier stages of their work have learned to conquer all 
obstacles, and in the end have achieved a high degree of 
success. It is the part of wisdom, however, for the 
young person who desires to enter the teaching service 
to take a careful account of his or her personal qualifica- 
tions for the work.! Fortunately the professional schools 
for teachers can do and are doing a great deal to aid 
the student in determining whether or not he or she 
has made the right choice. They are doing much, also, 
to correct the personal and temperamental defects that 
can be remedied. 
Unworthy motives for engaging in teaching. — Some 
persons who enter the work of teaching are attracted by 
apparent advantages of the occupation that are either 
quite illusory or so obviously an appeal to unworthy 
motives as to stamp those whom they influence as 
1 This problem is discussed in Chapter XI.
-P-A-G-E-20
    8 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
probably unfitted for the responsibilities of the service. 
Indeed, certain mistaken notions regarding’ teaching 
prevail so widely that the actual truth regarding them 
eannot be too frequently or too forcibly pointed out. 
Teaching far from ‘easy’? work. — The relatively 
“short” working day, the ‘‘free’’ Saturday, and the 
“long” summer vacation lead many laymen to regard 
teaching as. an ‘‘easy”’ occupation to be shunned by 
sincere and self-respecting men and women who wish 
to do their full share of the world’s work. By the same 
token, these features of the occupation sometimes loom 
large in determining the choice of teaching by men and 
women of the opposite type, who are looking — openly 
or furtively — for a soft berth on the voyage of life. It 
is scarcely necessary to say that those who enter teaching 
from this motive are more than likely to be bitterly dis- 
appointed. The actual work of teaching, it is true, in- 
volves relatively short hours as compared with some 
‘other occupations, but both the short day and the short 
week are more than counterbalanced by two other 
factors: (1) the need of constant, relentless, unremitting 
concentration throughout the school day; and (2) the 
multiplicity of necessary tasks and duties that can be 
accomplished only outside of school hours. As a result, 
the actual time given to the work during the week is, in 
the average of cases, well up to the limit usually recog- 
nized as a fair maximum for adult workers (forty-four 
to forty-eight hours), while the most successful teachers 
usually devote far more time than this to work that 
is directly related to their teaching. The summer vaca- 
tion, too, as well as being in part a period of physical
-P-A-G-E-21
  TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 9 
recuperation unquestionably justified by the exacting 
concentration of the school year, is coming more and 
more to be devoted in part to advanced professional 
education. 
LTeaching as a “ stepping-stone’? to other ‘eniniias 
One of the most serious handicaps to the development of 
teaching as a profession, — and consequently a most 
serious handicap to the efficiency of the schools, — has 
been the appeal that the occupation has made to those 
who wish to earn money toward preparation for other 
callings, and often to use the spare hours of the school 
week (and even the spare minutes of the school day!) in 
study for such occupations. The evils of this practice 
are obvious enough upon the slightest reflection. 
(1) Teaching, one of the most serious responsibilities 
that a person can undertake, becomes merely an inci- 
dental means to a quite extrinsic end. Instead of domi- 
nating as the life-purpose to which one devotes the 
major part of one’s energies, it is taken up as a temporary 
employment to be abandoned at the first good oppor- 
tunity to do something else. Under these conditions, 
attention is divided, tasks and duties are not taken 
seriously, and the work for which one is paid is likely 
to be done in a formal, lifeless, perfunctory way. 
(2) The practice is manifestly unfair to the teachers 
who take their profession seriously and pay to it the fine 
tribute of an undivided loyalty. The pressure of the 
temporary teacher who is headed for another calling 
has tended in the past to force upward the “‘initial” 
salaries which have sometimes been far more generous 
than beginners in other fields usually command, and at _
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
the same time to depress the ‘‘terminal’’ salaries which 
have frequently been little above the beginners’ level. 
The practice also tends to stamp the occupation in the 
public mind as‘casual and temporary rather than 
serious and permanent, thus adding a social handicap 
to the financial handicap of the permanent teacher. 
(3) The most disastrous result, however, is the unfortu- 
nate effect on the children who, under this practice, 
receive their early and most formative training at the 
hands of successive levies of raw recruits. Not only is 
the “‘stepping-stone”’ teacher unlikely to take his work 
seriously; he also fails to remain long enough in the 
occupation to get beyond the level of the novice; or, if 
he does remain simply because “‘something better’’ fails 
to present itself, he is almost certain to be sour and 
morose, — a teacher out of all sympathy with his calling. 
As someone has well said, —‘‘Those who for one 
moment condone teaching as a stepping-stone to other 
occupations forget that it is the children of the Nation 
who are being ‘stepped upon’ in the process.” 
Teaching as a ‘‘genteel” occupation. — In spite of the 
growth of the democratic ideal, the notion that certain 
types of necessary work are menial and degrading still 
persists. Teaching sometimes attracts persons because 
it is a “respectable” occupation in the unfortunate 
meaning of the term, —a meaning for which the word 
“genteel” is a more fitting expression. The attitude 
reflected in a choice of teaching that has been determined 
by this motive is not the attitude that will make for 
effective service in a democratic school system. No good 
democrat will ask or expect someone else to do something
-P-A-G-E-23
  TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 11 
that he would be ashamed to do for himself. ‘‘ As I would 
not be a slave,” said Lincoln, ‘‘so I would not be a 
master.”’ And he added: ‘‘That is my idea of democracy. 
What differs from this, by the extent of that difference, 
isnot democracy.” Teaching is one of the “‘ white-collar” 
occupations, it is true; but this fact adds nothing what- 
soever to its dignity or to its worth; and one of its most 
important tasks is to do everything that it can to correct 
the cruel and distorted scale of values which recognizes 
invidious distinctions between the sons of Martha and 
the sons of Mary. 
The professional education of teachers. — Schools 
play so important a part in modern civilization that all 
progressive nations have found it necessary to make 
extensive provisions for the professional education of 
teachers. In some countries, indeed, no teacher is ap- 
pointed. to a public-school position who has not been 
carefully prepared in a professional college. In a great 
and growing country like our own, this ideal is much 
more difficult to realize than in smaller countries with 
relatively stable populations and with forms of social 
organization that place a premium upon permanency in 
occupation.t. Thus, while it seems paradoxical that the 
1 This does not mean that provisions have not been made for the profes- 
sional education of teachers, but rather that the development of the public 
schools has been so rapid and the rewards of the service so inadequate that 
only a relatively small number of the teachers needed have taken advantages 
of such education. The first ‘‘normal school” in the United States was 
opened at Concord, Vermont, by Samuel R. Hall, a clergyman. This was a 
private venture and was short-lived. The first State normal school was opened 
at Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1839, largely through the efforts of James G. 
Carter (1795-1845). Carter was greatly aided in his efforts by the most 
illustrious of American educational leaders, Horace Mann (born 1796). 
Mann was a lawyer by profession, and became a member of the State senate. 
He was deeply interested in public education, introduced a bill providing for 
a State board of education, and became secretary of this board in 1837. 
From that time on, he was an educational crusader. It was largely through

  12. AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
  richest nation on earth has a larger proportion of tran- 
sient, immature, and untrained teachers in its schools 
than has any other nation of approximately comparable 
rank, the apparent paradox can be easily explained. Not 
only has our population been growing very rapidly, but 
the very resources that have induced this growth and 
which constitute the basis of our national wealth have 
opened a multitude of occupational opportunities. 
Occupational stability, especially in the fields of employ- 
ment that can be used as ‘“‘stepping-stones,” is the 
exception and not the rule. In spite of the recognized 
importance of teaching, then, teaching has been in our 
country ‘‘not a profession, but a procession.” 
Within the past two or three decades, however, this 
situation has been rapidly changing, especially in the 
urban communities. The public-school service in the 
cities and larger towns is now fairly well stabilized, and 
this development has been accompanied by a parallel 
growth of professional schools for teachers. In some 
parts of the country, standards of certification have been 
raised to the point where at least two years of professional 
education beyond graduation from a four-year high 
school are required before one is permitted to teach in 
an elementary school. For high-school service, four 
years of college work! are regarded as the minimal 
qualification. These standards now prevail generally in 
his efforts that the principle of free, tax-supported, secular schools was firmly 
established throughout the northern states. He also had a large influence in 
humanizing school government and making the school studies richer and less 
formal. In his later life, Mann became president of Antioch College in Ohio. 
He died in 1859. By this time, most of the great reforms for which he had 
labored were beginning to bear their fruit. The normal-school idea, in particu- lar, spread rapidly from Massachusetts to the other states. By 1870, nearly 
all of the northern states had one or more of these institutions. 
‘ That is, work in advance of a standard four-year high-school education.
-P-A-G-E-25
  TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 13 
so far as the schools of the urban communities are con- 
cerned, and in a few states! they apply with equal force to 
the schools of the open country and the villages. Gen- 
erally speaking, however, the rural-school service is still 
open to the untrained teacher, —a great misfortune, 
for, in spite of the rapid growth of our urban population, 
the open-country and village schools still enroll almost 
half of the Nation’s children. 
The importance of a thoroughgoing preparation for 
teaching. — We shall not at this point discuss the very 
great importance to the public of having well-prepared 
teachers to do the work of the schools. It is rather the 
importance of a thorough professional education to the 
teacher himself that we would emphasize. Every occu- 
pation yields its rewards most generously to those who 
take its responsibilities most seriously and who strive 
the most diligently to fit themselves to do its work well. 
Teaching is no exception to this general rule. Generally 
speaking, those who find teaching a fascinating occupa- 
tion are those who have paid the price of hard study, 
unceasing devotion, and a resolute determination to mas- 
ter a difficult art. Just as clearly, those who have made 
the largest investment of money, time, and effort in. 
preparation for the work of teaching are those who reap 
the largest financial rewards. Indeed, the recognition 
of the importance of professional education has now 
- reached a point where salary schedules for teachers in

  teacher completes. Probably in no other calling does an 
added investment in education bring so quick and so 
certain a financial return.! 
Much more important in the end, however, are the 
increased efficiency that comes with extended training 
and the accompanying satisfaction of doing better work 
than could otherwise be done. A thoroughgoing pro- 
fessional education gives to the teacher a consciousness 
of mastery, a comforting margin of strength. Problems 
there will be in abundance for which even the best of 
training will not provide ready-made solutions; but these 
will take their proper place as part and parcel of the day’s 
work, giving to the day’s work, indeed, a zest and an 
interest that it would otherwise lack; they will not be the 
sources of worry or the causes for panic that they might 
easily become to an untrained teacher; nor, on the other 
hand, will the trained teacher fail to recognize them as 
serious problems, — a mistake that the untrained teacher 
is likely to make. 
Phases of professional education. — It is generally 
recognized to-day that the professional education of all 
teachers should begin on the basis of a broad and liberal 
non-professional or ‘‘general’’ education. In the United 
States, the prevailing tendency is to make the completion 
of a full four-year high-school curriculum the prerequisite 
for admission to professional study. It is for this reason 
that the typical professional schools for teachers are now 
called ‘‘teachers colleges,’ this designation having 
1 Experience has shown that, in the long run and in the average of cases, 
each year of added training for the work of teaching brings an addition of 
about $200 to the annual salary. In other words, the investment in each 
year of training may be expected to pay an annual dividend equal to this 
amount.

replaced in most instances the older term, ‘normal 
school.”’! - 
Sound scholarship as a basis for teaching. —- An im- 
portant task of the modern teachers college is to provide 
for the prospective teacher a sound basis of scholarship, 
especially in those fields with which his later teaching 
will be concerned. tt is obvious enough that the 
teacher should know thoroughly the subjects that he 
tries to teach.) It is less obvious, but equally true, that 
he cannot have such a mastery without going far beyond 
the boundaries to which these subjects are necessarily 
limited in the elementary and high schools. In some of 
the professional schools, the policy formerly prevailed 
of depending on the elementary and high schools for 
“subject-matter,” and of limiting the ‘‘professional” 
courses to such subjects as “psychology,” “theory,” 
“methods,” and ‘‘practice-teaching.”’ The tendency 
to-day is to lay a far heavier emphasis upon the mastery 
of subject-matter, but to approach this mastery from 
the point of view of the teacher’s specific needs. Thus 
while the prospective elementary-school teacher will 
probably find, among the requirements of the teachers 
college, courses in such subjects as arithmetic, geogra- 
phy, English, and history, he should not conclude that 
1 The ‘‘teachers-college’? movement owes it name as well as a strong im- 
petus to the development of Teachers College, Columbia University, under 
the leadership of James E. Russell (born 1864), who became dean of the Col- lege in 1898. Among those who have taken an active part in the transforma- 
tion of normal schools into teachers colleges are: Homer H. Seerley (born 
1848), who became president of the Iowa State Normal School (now the State 
Teachers College) in 1886; David Felmley (born 1857), who was for several 
years a teacher in the Illinois State Normal University and who became its 
president in 1900; John R. Kirk (born 1851), State superintendent of public instruction in Missouri from 1895 to 1899, and since the latter date president of the Northeastern Missouri State Teachers College; and John W. Withers 
(born 1868), who was the first principal of the Harris Teachers College of St. 
Louis, and who is now dean of the School of Education, New York University. 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
    16 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
he will simply ‘‘review” the work that he went over in 
the elementary school. He will find that such courses 
not only give him a ‘‘new view” of those elementary 
materials but also stimulate him to a degree of mental 
effort equivalent to that which would be called for by 
any of the traditional college courses; and in addition he 
will find in the teachers-college program courses in 
subject-matter which will have a clear bearing upon his 
later work but which will not suggest, even by their 
names, an association with work that he has already 
astered. 
Training in the art of teaching. — The professional 
lleges of to-day place a strong emphasis on what may 
be called the “laboratory” study of teaching; — that is, 
on the work of ‘‘demonstration” and ‘‘training”’ schools. 
In the demonstration classes, the students very early 
in their professional study become acquainted at first 
hand with the way in which skillful teachers adapt 
subject-matter to the needs and capacities of children. 
In the training school, the prospective teacher begins the 
actual practice of his art under close and sympathetic 
supervision. Sometimes this, too, is begun fairly early 
in the period of professional education, so that the study 
of subject-matter, the demonstration of good teaching, 
and the actual participation by the student in the work 
of teaching go hand in hand, each helping the others and 
in turn being helped by them. Thus a thoroughgoing 
professional unity of the work is insured from the outset. 
In other schools, there are still rather sharp divisions 
among the various stages of professional education, — 
subject-matter and theory coming first, and practice  
-P-A-G-E-29
  TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 17 
being postponed to the latter part of the curriculum; 
but even in such cases, the effort is usually made through 
demonstration-classes to keep the actual teaching of 
boys and girls constantly in view as the fundamental 
objective of the professional college. 
The study of education as a science. — Another impor- 
tant phase of professional education is represented by the 
study of educational science. During the present cen- 
tury, remarkable progress has been made in the experi- 
mental investigation of educational problems, and a 
goodly numberof carefully tested facts and principles 
bearing directly on the work of teaching are now avail- 
able. These are usually studied in separate courses 
under such titles as ‘educational psychology,” ‘child 
study,” ‘‘experimental education,’ ‘school hygiene,” 
“educational measurements,” and the like; but the 
tendency here, as in the professional study of subject- 
matter, is to emphasize the unity of all of the work that 
the professional school represents. sThus almost every 
course that the prospective teacker undertakes is likely to 
reflect some of the facts and principles that the scientific 
study of education has revealed. The science of edu- 
cation is not a self-contained, detached body of knowl- 
edge; it has its meaning and its justification in the light 
that it throws upon the actual problems of teaching and 
learning. One cannot teach without teaching some- 
thing to somebody; hence the science of education has 
dynamic and intimate relations both to the subject- 
matter that is taught and to the persons to whom it is 
taught, as well as to the manner or method of teaching. 
There is general agreement that its lessons can best be
-P-A-G-E-30
    18 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
mastered by the prospective teacher when presented in 
close connection with their application to the tasks in- 
volved in teaching specific and particular subjects to 
actual flesh-and-blood boys and girls. 
The broader study of educational theory. — The modern 
teachers college, however, does not neglect the more 
comprehensive and penetrating study of educational 
theory. This contributes to the student’s understand- 
ing of the art of the teaching and consequently to his 
mastery of this art. Beyond this it is made necessary 
by the increasing participation of teachers in the con- 
struction of broad educational policies. As has been 
pointed out, the teacher’s responsibilities extend beyond 
the limits of the classroom to the council rooms and the 
halls of deliberation where the aims of education as a 
great social enterprise are discussed, and where programs 
for the realization of these aims are framed, criticized, 
and evaluated. Some measure of preparation toward an 
effective rendering of this collective service must be 
provided in the professional schools. Most teachers 
colleges offer courses that have this broader preparation 
as their chief objective. Of great importance in this 
connection are such studies as biology, sociology, eco- 
nomics, and history, including the history of education 
itself. As the capstone to all of these, there may well 
be a course in the philosophy of education which brings 
together the facts and principles involved in the pre- 
ceding courses, and encourages the student to formulate 
for himself a ‘‘working theory” of education. 
Brief vs. extended preparation for teaching. — The 
program that has been very briefly sketched in the pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 19 
ceding section cannot be mastered in a brief period. 
The present minimal standard of two years following 
graduation from a four-year high school is far too re- 
stricted a preparation for any branch of the teaching 
service. To increase this period to three years will not 
be an impossible achievement; one of the states (New 
York) has already made such an extension, and it is 
probable that a four-year period will ultimately be 
established. In the meantime, the problem is being 
partially solved in another way. Facilities are now 
provided very generally for the professional education 
of teachers in service. ‘Extension’ or ‘‘extra-mural” 
courses are offered by the normal schools and teachers 
colleges, and by liberal-arts colleges and universities, — 
courses which teachers can take during the school year. 
These can be adapted without serious difficulty to the 
hours and needs of teachers in service, and credits earned 
in this way will count toward the Bachelor’s degree and 
in some cases toward the advanced Master’s and Doc- 
tor’s degrees. Even more significant has been the de- 
velopment of summer sessions in universities, teachers 
colleges, and other institutions. This development has 
been going on for about thirty years, and has already 
reached a point where nearly one fourth of all of the 
public-school teachers of the country themselves 
attend school in the summer. 
The ideal of continuous growth. — While the rapid 
development of extension and summer-session courses 
has been stimulated by the policy of granting increases 
in salary for added increments of professional education, 
the movement had its beginning and still derives a large 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
  part of its force from the earnest desire of teachers to 
grow in their work. It reflects, in other words, a con- 
scious ideal that is coming more and more generally to 
characterize the teaching profession, — the ideal, namely, 
of continuous growth, the accepted conviction that the 
successful and conscientious teacher must always be a 
learner. In the broadest sense, the professional educa- 
tion of the teacher is never finished. It is a process 
that may well continue during the longest life; a process, 
too, that during the longest life may easily mean the 
continually increasing effectiveness of the teacher’s ser- 
vice and a continually increasing measure of satisfaction 
and happiness in his work. From this point of view, the 
profession of teaching now has a very marked advantage 
over many other occupations. The conditions that sur- 
round its service both permit and demand the kind of 
growth that in other human callings is very largely limited 
to the initial periods of training and apprenticeship. », 
The ideal of growth as a check to pedantry. — The“de- 
velopment of this ideal is also doing much to counteract ° 
what is perhaps the most serious disadvantage of teach- 
ing as a life-long occupation; namely, the tendency of 
continuous teaching to develop that undesirable quality 
known as pedantry, While the conventional caricature 
of the soliSolinaster with its exaggeration of pretense, 
smugness, and self-complacency is far from a true pic- 
ture of the type, it none the less points by its very over- 
emphasis to a real danger that the calling involves. 
Mr. Graham Wallas! has developed an interesting the- 
1Granam Wauuas: Our Social Heritage, pp. 150ff. Yale University 
Press, 1921.
-P-A-G-E-33
TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 21 
ory by which he attempts to explain this tendency of 
continuous teaching to develop a pedantic attitude. 
Recognizing that teaching is for many adults a fascin- 
ating occupation, he assumes that there is an instinctive 
or inborn tendency to guide and instruct the young of 
the species; but he also maintains that this instinctive 
tendency is intermittent in its appearance, resembling 
in this respect the parental instincts. He says: 
“Mankind ... have a teaching instinct. That instinct can be 
observed in many ‘born’ male teachers, and in a rather larger 
proportion of women teachers, and particularly of women who, 
at the age of early motherhood, are teaching very youn tate: 
But the teaching instinct was evolved under conditions where men 
and women taught during only part of their lives. The profes- 
sional teacher now teaches every day; he forms, indeed, the habit 
of teaching; but habit, when it overrides nature, produces severe 
nervous reaction; all regular work ...is unnatural to us.... 
Habituation is easier for the teacher because he is dealing with a 
quickly changing series of immature minds. After every year 
. .. he begins with a new class, and tends to repeat his most suc- 
cessful sayings, and to emphasize, without the sense of humor 
and proportion which comes from adult criticism, his pet ideas. 
When the mediaeval Italian laity turned the word ‘pedagogue’ 
into ‘pedant,’ the word and its meaning was understood and 
adopted from one end of Europe to the other.” 
It is probably true, as Mr. Wallas contends, that all 
regular work is unnatural. In this case, all occupations 
that are pursued throughout adult life labor under a 
disadvantage similar to that of teaching. Addison,' 
indeed, in commenting on this very quality of pedantry, 
stoutly maintained that it was not peculiar to the 
teacher. The solution of the problem would seem to lie, 
1 See The Spectator, No. 105. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34

22 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
then, not in making teaching a temporary and casual 
occupation, but in providing explicitly to offset these 
narrowing and stultifying tendencies. The development 
of the ideal of continuous growth, and the parallel 
development of facilities for the education of teachers in 
service, are by far the most notable and effective steps 
that have so far been taken toward thisend. Mr. Wallast 
has clearly recognized this fact: 
“Tt is fortunate that the process of being taught, itself gives 
nervous relief when exchanged for that of teaching. One realizes 
one of the causes which lent zest to mediaeval university life, when 
one reads Chaucer’s description of the Clerk of Oxenford, ‘and 
gladly would he lerne and gladly teche.’” 
The relation of pre-service education to in-service educa- 
tion for teachers. — It would be a mistake, however, for 
the prospective teacher to conclude that the many facili- 
ties now afforded for in-service education will justify 
an abbreviated period of pre-service education. Exten- 
sion and summer-session courses cannot be a substitute 
for a prolonged period of uninterrupted, systematic 
training. There is an unquestioned value in a coherent 
and well-articulated curriculum of studies and activities 
steadfastly pursued from start to finish. There is, too, 
an unquestioned advantage in being immerged for three 
or four years in an institutional atmosphere that is sur- 
charged with professional idealism. To have all or most 
of the initial professional education in smaller fragments 
is to miss a large part of these values and advantages. 
The prospective teacher will be most fortunate if he can 
pursue an uninterrupted curriculum until he has reached   
1 WALLAS, op. cit., p. 153.
-P-A-G-E-35
TEACHING AS AN OCCUPATION 23 
the level of attainment and proficiency that is repre- 
sented by the Bachelor’s degree. He will be unfortunate, 
however, if he interprets the conferring of this degree as 
meaning the completion of his professional education. 
Ultimately, no doubt, the in-service agencies will limit 
themselves to specialized, advanced, or graduate study. 
Even now it is clear that the teachers who profit the 
most by the extension and summer-session courses are 
those who have had the most substantial pre-service 
education. 
The differentiation of pre-service education. — It is 
the first unit, then, of professional education that the 
regular sessions of the normal school or teachers college 
usually represent. It is well to emphasize the unitary 
character of this initial work. The term “curriculum” 
is now used to designate a unified and coherent sequence 
of separate ‘‘courses,”’ all of which coéperate toward a 
given end or objective. Most of the teachers colleges 
offer several ‘‘curricula,’”’ and the total of the offerings 
is known as the “ program of studies.” Each curriculum, 
however, is a unit in that the combination of courses 
which it represents is pointed toward a definite objective. 
There may be one curriculum for kindergarten-primary 
teachers; one for teachers of the intermediate grades; 
one for teachers of the upper grades (or in place of this, 
several related curricula for different types of teaching 
in the junior high school); one for teachers in ungraded 
rural schools. Some also offer curricula (or programs 
from which individual curricula may be constructed) 
for special types of high-school teachers (English, Latin, 
history, mathematics, science). In other words, the
-P-A-G-E-36
EE ESSS'~ Se 
24 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
professional education of teachers, even in its preliminary 
stages, is rapidly coming to be specialized; but the 
preparation for each special field is a unit in itself, 
although there will obviously be numerous courses that 
are common to several different curricula, and some 
courses that are common to all. 
Choosing a curriculum. — This differentiation of pro- 
fessional education is made necessary by the differentia- 
tion of the teaching service. The time is long past when 
one person can be expected to do well the teaching de- 
manded on all of the educational “levels,” or in all of 
the school subjects. One must select a special field, and 
one must furthermore make this choice fairly early. In 
a few teachers colleges, the choice must be made at 
the very outset; others, however, provide a longer or 
shorter period of common courses before differentiation 
is begun. In any case, the work of the first term or the 
first semester is likely to reveal to the student the advan- 
tages and disadvantages of the various specialized fields, 
and to give some inkling of the qualifications that each 
field demands. The present volume aims, among other 
things, to aid the student in making a wise choice by 
describing the various fields of the teaching service, and 
by suggesting methods of studying these fields and meth- 
ods of determining whether one is qualified for the service 
which each represents. 
The importance of an acquaintance with the field of 
education as a whole.—One of the most important 
factors in making a wise choice of a special field of service, 
however, is to see education as a whole, — to get a bird’s- 
eye view of the work that the schools are called upon to
-P-A-G-E-37

do. This is not to say that a full and thorough under- 
standing of education either as a process or as an institu- 
tion can be attained at the outset; but, in a relatively 
brief period of serious study, through a broad survey of 
the field, one may acquire an initial understanding of its 
varied and interesting problems. It has been primarily 
to help the student in fashioning this preliminary scaf- 
folding for his later construction that the following 
chapters have been written. 
Quzstions, Exercises, AND PROBLEMS 
1. From your experiences with schools and teachers, make a list 
of the features of the teacher’s work that attract you and a list of 
the features that you find unattractive. 
2. Recall the best teacher that you had in the elementary school. 
Make a list of the qualities in which this teacher apparently excelled. 
Recall the best teacher that you had in high school and make a 
similar list of qualities. The ten qualities most frequently noted by 
all members of the class may be well studied with the purpose of 
determining in how far it is possible to acquire them. 
3. Make a list of the occupations other than school-teaching 
which involve teaching activities. In what important ways, if any, 
do these teaching activities of other occupations differ from those 
of school-teaching? To which of these occupations, if any, do you 
think that school-teaching might be considered a legitimate ‘“step- 
ping-stone”’? 2 
4. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, in commenting on the grief 
of the Harvard students over the death of Professor N. S. Shaler, 
makes this statement: “It left a wonderful impression of the power 
with coming generations of a single great teacher. Every one of 
those boys may become a source of power himself — no one can tell 
which. The author has vast power also... ; but it is not brought 
together in so direct and visible a shape.” (Letters and Journals 
of Thomas Wentworth Higginson, p. 347. Houghton Mifflin, 1921.)

WHAT IS TEACHING? 
In a modern schoolroom, a teacher has many tasks 
that do not constitute teaching in the strict sense of the 
term. As a condition of doing well the work that should 
be done, order must be maintained; the temperature of 
the room, the circulation of the air, and the lighting 
must be looked after; the bodily health of each child 
must be cared for; an appropriate sequence of work and 
relaxation must be organized; books, maps, charts, 
pencils, paper, and other material equipment must be 
provided, cared for, and properly used. It is true that 
there are opportunities in connection with each and all 
of these details to teach certain important lessons; but 
even granting these possibilities, it is clear that good 
order, comfortable and healthful surroundings, and 
material equipment exist primarily as means to another 
end, — they exist and are important chiefly because they 
make good teaching and effective learning possible. 
Teaching and learning. —The union of the terms 
“good teaching” and “‘effective learning” gives a clue 
to what teaching is at basis. (Io stimulate, encourage, 
and direct learning is the soul and substance of the art 
of teaching.) It is the pupil himself who must learn. 
Without activity on the pupil’s part, — without some 
dynamic expression of a “will to learn,” — the efforts 
of the best teachers will be futile.

% AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
What is meant by “learning”? — Before we can un- 
derstand what teaching is, then, we must first understand 
what learning is. It is not difficult to define learning in 
simple terms, but it is very difficult to frame a simple 
definition that will do full justice to the importance and 
the complexity of the process. The truth is that there 
are several kinds of learning; or, if we wish to think of 
Jearning as a unitary process, we must at least admit that 
this process varies with the point of view from which 
it is studied. The more important of these different 
kinds of learning (or of the different points of view from 
which learning may be studied) will be considered briefly 
in this chapter as a preliminary to the more detailed 
treatment which subsequent chapters will undertake. 
1. Learning means a change in behavior or conduct. — 
An important step toward understanding the learning 
process is to think of it as meaning some change in 
behavior or conduct. John knows how to throw a curved 
ball and James does not. James watches John carefully 
and sees just how he grips the ball and how he throws it. 
James then practices and gradually develops the requisite 
skill. He has learned what is for him a new art; he has 
acquired a new control over his muscles; he can do 
something that he could not do before. 
The illustration is a simple one, but it typifies clearly 
a fundamental condition which all true learning must 
meet. Whether directly or through indirect and devious 
channels, learning produces a change in the way in which 
the learner acts. This is clear enough in the mastery of 
definite skills or arts, but it is equally true, although not 
at first glance so clear, when we consider other types of  
-P-A-G-E-41
  WHAT IS TEACHING? 29 
learning. We shall turn to these directly; for the present 
let us look at this process of changing conduct or behavior 
from another point of view. 
( 2. Learning means the formation of new ‘“‘bonds” or 
connections in thénervous system. — From his study of 
physiology, the student will recall something of the way 
in which the muscles of the body are controlled and 
particularly of the part that the nervous system plays 
in this process. While the nervous system of man is a 
very complicated structure, its general ‘‘pattern”’ is not 
difficult to comprehend. It is essentially a very delicate 
apparatus for controlling the muscles in such a way that 
movements of the body may be made in harmony with 
conditions existing in the outside world and in harmony 
with the needs of the body as related to these conditions. 
The nervous system is so constructed that it (1) ‘picks 
up” impressions or ‘‘stimuli” which represent external 
conditions, (2) interprets these impressions with reference 
to the needs of the organism, and (3) stimulates the 
muscles so that they will make the movements necessary 
to meet these needs. 
All this is accomplished by a marvelous network of 
very sensitive filaments called ‘“‘neurones.’”’ A neurone 
is a unit of living matter (protoplasm), — technically a 
“cell,” — consisting of a rather substantial body from 
which extend long thread-like arms. Each of the 
external sense-organs (the eye, the ear, the taste-buds, 
and the like) contains the ends of ‘“‘sensory’’ neurones 
which ‘‘pick up” impressions that inform us of the outer 
world. There are also internal sense-organs in the 
muscles, tendons, and joints and in the vital organs that
-P-A-G-E-42
  30 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
constitute the viscera. These internal sense-organs 
contain the ends of sensory neurones which inform us of 
the condition of the body itself. The sensory neurones 
convey to the central nervous system (the spinal cord 
and the brain) each its own particular variety of impres- 
sion, — whether of light, sound, smell, taste, pressure, 
temperature, movement, hunger, thirst, pain, or what 
not. In the central nervous system other neurones, 
called ‘‘association”’ neurones, receive the incoming im- 
pressions and distribute them to still other neurones, 
(‘““motor” neurones) which send the requisite “orders” 
outward to the muscles. 
It is a fairly well-established inference that the way 
in which one acts is determined by the way in which 
groups of neurones have been connected, and conse- 
quently that a change in conduct or behavior means 
the formation of new “bonds” or connections among the 
neurones. When James learned from John how to throw 
a curved ball, it may be inferred: (1) that by watching 
John he was able to initiate in his own nervous system . 
the same kinds of bonds that John had already built up 
in his nervous system; and (2) that by practicing the 
movements, he gradually strengthened these bonds until 
the necessary movements followed one another as a 
matter of course and the “‘art’’ was mastered. 
This explanation of learning as the formation of new 
bonds among neurones has the advantage of enabling one 
to picture the process as it probably goes on in the ner- 
vous system. It helps one to understand what learning 
probably means from the point of view of the anatomical 
structures involved and the physiological functions that
-P-A-G-E-43
  WHAT IS TEACHING? 31 
are fulfilled by these structures. There are, however, 
certain important phases of learning that it does not 
satisfactorily explain, perhaps because our knowledge 
of what actually goes on in the nervous system is still so 
scanty. 
3. Learning means mental activity. — It is necessary, 
then, to approach the problem from still another point 
of view. What do we mean when we say that John 
“knows how” to throw a curved ball while James does 
not? It is true that John has formed certain bonds or 
nerve-connections that James lacks, and it is true that as 
James learns to throw a curved ball he must form in his 
own nervous system a series of bonds similar to those that 
James already possesses. But before he can do this, and 
as an important part of forming the connections, James 
must have what we have called an ‘‘idea”’ of the way in 
which the movements are made. He must see the 
process in his ‘‘mind’s eye,’”’ as we say, so that he may 
“know how” to direct his muscles. It is for this reason 
that he so carefully watches John as the latter grips the 
ball. He is trying to form a mental picture or image of 
the way in which the ball is held, and then he strives to 
govern his own muscles accordingly. When we speak of 
a “bond” or a “‘nerve-connection,”’ we are speaking of 
something that is physical in its character; when we 
speak of ‘‘ideas,”’ ‘‘images,” and ‘‘mental pictures,”’ on 
the other hand, we are speaking of something that is 
essentially not physical but mental — although we 
assume that physical or physiological processes are back 
of this mental something. We know little of these 
physical and physiological processes, however, but by 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
32 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
examining our own consciousness we can come to know 
something about the mental processes, and we can easily 
and safely conclude from our own experience that they 
are of very great importance in learning. Indeed it is 
safe to say that all kinds of learning that are worthy of 
the name involve mental activity. 
4, The formation of clear ideas is probably the most 
important step in learning. — We may go even beyond 
this and maintain that in all probability the most im- 
portant phase of learning is that which is involved in the 
formation of clear ideas. If one ‘‘knows how”’ to reduce 
a compound fraction, or if one ‘‘knows how” the map of 
Australia looks, or if one ‘‘knows how” corn is raised, 
it means that one has an equipment of ideas that may be 
used to guide or control conduct. To teach is to stimu- 
late, encourage, and direct the learner to build up a 
series of such ideas. It should be remembered, however, 
that the ideas — the ‘‘knowledge’”’ — cannot be looked 
upon as an end. It is always the conduct of the learner 
that is the final test; the proof of learning is the ability 
to act consistently with the knowledge learned. 
5. Improvement in conduct or behavior usually means 
forming clearer ideas through repetition. — It is also true 
that one may have fairly clear ideas and the willingness 
and ability to act consistently with these ideas, and yet 
lack readiness and skill in such action. An important 
part of teaching is concerned with the repeated per- 
formance of what has been initially learned until a desir- 
able degree of proficiency in its use has been acquired; 
but even this involves, frequently if not always, a refining 
and clarifying of the ideas that guide conduct. \Gener-

ally speaking, when mental activity ceases, learning 
ceases.’ This happens as a matter of course when an art 
has been learned so well that one does not have to ‘think 
about’? how to do it, — when one does not have con- 
sciously to guide the movements by means of ideas. 
Thus a large part of our behavior becomes habitual or 
mechanical with repetition. And yet if the behavior is 
not satisfactory, — if the mechanized process is not so 
efficient as we would like, — there is only one way to 
improve it: namely, by improving our ideas, by learning 
better “how.” 
Summary: provisional definitions. — Learning, then, 
is essentially a mental process. It involves mental 
activity. The learner must perceive, he must form 
images, he must remember, he must think, he must 
consciously apply what he learns. 
Teaching stimulates and directs these mental pro- 
cesses, — this mental activity,—of the learner. It 
does not and cannot be a substitute for the learner’s 
activity. It may show, explain, expound, clarify, guide, 
reveal, encourage, reward, inspire; (indeed, if it bungles 
its job, it may obscure, misdirect, depress, and dis- 
courage); but it cannot by any legerdemain or miracle 
become a substitute for the primary condition of all 
learning, — namely, the active mental effort of the 
learner himself. 
Some important facts with regard to teaching and 
learning may be summarized from the foregoing dis- 
cussion: : 
1. Teaching is the art of stimulating, encouraging, 
and guiding learning. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
2. Learning is primarily a process of forming clear 
ideas that will serve to guide and control behavior or 
conduct. 
8. Repetition is usually necessary to perfect and 
crystallize learning, but repetition to be most effective 
must mean also a further clarification or refinement of 
ideas. 
4. Learning, therefore, is essentially a mental process. 
Some difficulties in applying these definitions. — There 
are certain phases of teaching and learning, however, 
which do not seem at first glance to be covered by these 
definitions. The emphasis on conduct or behavior as 
the important end in all learning is often puzzling to the 
student. The “ideas” learned in the study of arith- 
metic, grammar, and hygiene have a very clear and 
direct bearing upon conduct. It is obviously advan- 
tageous to ‘‘know how” to add, subtract, multiply, 
divide, manipulate fractions, and compute interest. It 
is obviously advantageous to ‘‘know how” to frame a 
sentence so that its structure will be grammatically cor- 
rect and its meaning clear. It is likewise important to 
“know how” to live healthily, to gain and maintain 
physical vigor, to avoid disease. But other ideas are 
taught and learned for which a direct and important 
influence upon actual conduct is not so easy to demon- 
strate. Every American child, for example, is expected 
to learn something of his country’s history, — to build 
up certain ‘‘ideas’’ about Washington, Franklin, Lin- 
coln, and a number of other men whose efforts have done 
so much toward making our country what it is; to gain 
a clear ‘‘idea”’ of the way in which our government was
-P-A-G-E-47
  WHAT IS TEACHING? 35 
established, and how it has developed in the course of 
a century and a half; to live ‘‘in imagination” through 
some of the great movements that constitute the im- 
portant episodes of our history, — the development of 
the West, the anti-slavery movement, the Industrial 
Revolution, the rise of the nation to a position of inter- 
national leadership and responsibility. 
If the ‘‘ideas’”’ learned in the study of history affect 
life at all, then, it is clear that they do it in a somewhat 
different way from that in which the ideas learned in 
arithmetic, grammar, and hygiene affect life. The 
connection with actual behavior is not always or often 
so direct and immediate in the former case as it is in the 
latter case. And yet even the slightest reflection will 
convince one that the study of history may have and 
frequently does have very profound influence upon con- 
duct. The ways in which this influence is exerted will 
be discussed later (see below, pp. 79-87, pp. 241-249); 
it is sufficient here merely to emphasize the fact as a 
preliminary to the later discussion. 
Again, the pupils in American schools are expected 
to “learn” something about the masterpieces of litera- 
ture, music, and the pictorial and plastic arts. In what 
way will the ‘‘ideas” thus developed influence conduct? 
Certainly the influence may not be direct and immediate, 
and yet, as we shall point out later, such study may 
serve to make one a quite different individual from what 
he or she would otherwise have been. 
What has been said in the three preceding paragraphs 
illustrates again the difficulty that confronts one who 
attempts to frame simple definitions of such terms as
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
“teaching,” “learning,” and ‘‘education.”’ The effort 
at simplification is likely to cover up or leave out of 
account some very important factors; and when these 
factors are thus eliminated, the student is likely to infer 
that they are not very important. This easy inference 
has been the source of much confusion, not only to young 
people who are preparing to teach, but also to men and 
women who for years have been thinking and working 
in the educational field. 
Two varieties of learning. — Some of these confusing 
difficulties may be avoided by looking at teaching and 
learning from yet another point of view. We have de- 
fined teaching as the art of stimulating and directing 
learning, and we have defined learning as a process of 
forming clear ideas that will serve to guide and control 
conduct or behavior. But where do these ideas come 
from and what do they represent? 
John could throw a curved ball; James could not. 
James, by carefully watching John, formed the idea of 
how to grip and throw the ball. But where did John 
himself get this idea? He learned it from someone else, 
who in turn had learned it from someone else, and so on 
back to the first baseball pitcher who either “hit upon.” 
(discovered) or worked out (invented) the ‘‘trick.” — 
There are, then, two sources from which ideas are 
learned. Most ideas we learn from other people who 
in their turn have learned them from other people; but 
if we carry the analysis back far enough, we must con- 
clude that some one originally either “hit upon” or 
more or less laboriously worked out the idea as a new 
discovery or invention. This new discovery or inven-    
-P-A-G-E-49
  WHAT IS TEACHING? 37 
tion constituted a brand-new kind of experience. Others 
who borrowed the discovery or invention probably added 
to it by new experiences of their own, — they refined and 
improved the idea; but for most of the advances that 
human life has witnessed, a great deal of credit must 
be given to those who initiated the advance. 
All learning comes through experience. — Quite ob- 
viously everyone learns more or less from his own ex- 
perience; everyone, from his own successes or failures in 
meeting the situations of life, forms ideas of how to do 
things. But in the long course of history, experiences 
have been accumulated and their lessons crystallized so 
that one living a civilized life to-day, while learning 
something from his own experience, learns much more 
by appropriating the ideas that have come from the 
past experience of the race. This appropriation, let it 
again be emphasized, must involve the active effort of 
the learner; it is always in a greater or less degree a 
process of reéxperiencing what others have experienced 
before, and of gaining through this process the ideas 
that others have gained and the advantages that are 
involved in the possession of these ideas as guides to 
efficient conduct. It is possible for one to “go through 
the motions” of these accumulated experiences, and not 
- get the ideas at all. One important task of good teach- 
ing is to prevent this disaster, and, on the positive side,. 
to insure a true process of reéxperiencing what others 
have learned. : z 
The two processes of learning, or the two sources of 
ideas, that we have just contrasted are sometimes 
spoken of as (1) ‘‘direct”’ or ‘‘personal” experience, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
(2) “vicarious” experience. The term “‘personal’’ ex- 
perience refers to what one learns from meeting and 
mastering the situations that confront one in actual 
living. ‘‘Vicarious” experience refers to the appropri- 
ation, — or better, the reéxperiencing, — of the way in 
which others have solved these problems. 
Education as growth.— The fact that individual 
experience is the primary factor in learning suggests at , 
once that education may be very largely a process of 
natural growth; we know that the body grows in accord- 
ance with inborn tendencies when the right kind of food 
is provided and when the conditions are appropriate for 
the right kind of exercise. There is, so to speak, an 
unfoldment of the bodily structures and functions that is 
largely determined from the very outset by natural 
laws. In the same fashion, it is held, the mind grows 
and develops in accordance with innate tendencies when 
the right kind of stimulus is provided, and when the 
conditions are favorable for the right kind of exercise. 
There is again an unfoldment, — this time, of the mental 
structures and functions. 
Advocates of education as growth: Comenius and Rous- 
seau. — In one form or another, this view of education 
has been held and advocated by many of the most 
prominent and influential students of the problem during . 
the past three centuries. Comenius! said: 
“There must be no pressure. Learning should come to children 
as swimming to fish, flying to birds, running to animals.” ’ 
1 John Amos Comenius (Komensky) (1592-1670) was a Polish Moravian, 
who was educated for the ministry and became in later life a bishop of the 
Moravian faith. He is best known, however, for his great work in education. 
In 1631, he published a book of encyclopedic character called The Gate of
-P-A-G-E-51
WHAT IS TEACHING? 39 
The great French writer on social and educational 
problems, Rousseau,! proclaimed a similar principle: 
“The first education should be purely negative. It consists by 
no means in teaching virtue or truth, but in securing the heart, 
of the child from vice and the intellect from error. If you could 
do nothing and let nothing be done, if you could bring on your 
pupil healthy and strong to the age of twelve without his being 
able to tell his right hand from his left, from the very first lesson 
the eyes of his understanding would be open to reason. Being 
without prejudices and without habits, he would have nothing in 
him to thwart the effect of your care; and by beginning with doing 
nothing you would have made him an educational prodigy.” 
Pestalozzi. — The greatest figure in modern education, 
Pestalozzi,? also attributes a large educative influence 
to the unaided operations of natural tendencies: 
“From the very moment that the child’s senses open to the 
impressions of nature, nature teaches it. Its new life is but the 
the Languages Unlocked. In 1649, his Great Didactic, completed in 1632, was 
published. It has been said of this work, ‘‘So sane and far-seeing are the 
precepts . . . that it may even yet be read with greater profit to.the teacher 
sufficiently intelligent to avoid many minor errors than the majority of 
contemporary educational writings.’’ Comenius should also be remembered 
as the first person to prepare a textbook in which pictures were systematically 
employed to make words more meaningful to the learner. This was his 
famous Orbis Pictus, published in 1658. He was the first student of educa- 
tion to achieve an international reputation and influence. He was well 
known in England; he was asked to become president of the first American 
college (Harvard); and he was engaged by the government of Sweden to 
reorganize the schools of that nation. In his native land he is still regarded 
as one of the great national heroes, and the tradition of mass-education that 
he established has been a powerful factor in giving to Czechoslovakia its 
present distinguished position among the countries of modern Europe. 
1 Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1770) advocated a ‘‘return to nature” 
in part as a protest against the artificialities of French civilization in the days 
of the later Bourbons. His greatest contribution to educational literature is 
the Emile, a book that describes in detail the way in which a boy should 
(and should not!) be trained. The quotation in the text is from this book. 
The writings of Rousseau exerted a powerful influence and are recognized as 
having been important factors in bringing about the French Revolution. 
His influence upon modern education has probably been more profound than 
that of any other man with the exception of Pestalozzi. 
2 Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1745-1827) was a Swiss who, after the 
devastation of his country by the wars following the French Revolution, 
sought its regeneration through education. As a father, he kept a careful 
 
-P-A-G-E-52

  faculty, now come to maturity, of receiving impressions; it is the 
awakening of the germs now perfect which will go on using all 
their forces and energies to secure the development of their nat- 
ural organization; it is the awakening of the animal now com- 
plete which will and shall become a man. So the sole instruction 
given to the human being consists merely in the act of giving a 
helping hand to this natural tendency toward its proper devel- 
opment; and this act consists essentially in the means of putting 
the child’s impressions in connection and harmony with the pre- 
eise degree of development that the child has reached. There 
moust be then in the impressions to be given him by instruction 
a regular gradation; and the beginning and the progress of his 
various knowledges must exactly correspond with the beginning 
and increase in his powers as they are developed. . . . This grada- 
tion must be discovered for all the branches of human knowledge.” 
Froebel. — One of the most picturesque portrayals of 
this conception is given by Froebel! in his Education of 
Man: 
“O man, who roameth through garden and field, through 
meadow and grove, why dost thou close thy mind to the silent 
teaching of nature? Behold even the weed, which, grown up 
diary of his son’s development, and out of this grew many of his educational 
theories. He was also influenced by the writings of Rousseau. Many of 
his theories are set forth in a story of what rural life might become under the 
right conditions; this book is entitled Leonard and Gertrude. Unlike Rousseau, 
however, Pestalozzi was far more than a theorist; he was himself a teacher of 
boys and girls, — and a more ardently enthusiastic teacher never lived. He organized schools successively at Neuhof, Stanz, Burgdorf, and Yverdun. 
The school at Burgdorf was really an asylum of waifs and orphans left stranded 
in the wake of the great wars that were then sweeping western Europe. 
Pestalozzi not only taught these children;— he dressed them, fed them, and 
eared for them in every way. This intimate and long-continued contact with 
children and with the actual problems of teaching gave to Pestalozzi’s theories 
a force and a vitality that brought to him a host of disciples from all parts of 
Europe. His teachings had a large influence in the establishment of educa- 
tional systems in all the countries of northern Europe. Indeed, Pestalozzi 
may well be revered as the father of the modern universal school. 
1 Friedrich W. A. Froebel (1782—1852) was a native of southern Germany. 
After serving as a soldier in the Napoleonic wars, he established, in 1816, a 
school at Griesheim in which during the following twenty years he worked 
out the implications of his educational theories. The term ‘‘kindergarten,” 
which he first used in 1836, is a happy designation of the ideal that he had in mind for the school, — a place where human nature would unfold as naturally
-P-A-G-E-53

amid hindrances and constraint, scarcely yields an indication of 
inner law, behold it in nature, in field or garden, and see how 
perfectly it conforms to law — what a pure inner life it shows, 
harmonious in all parts and features: a beautiful sun, a radiant 
star, it has burst from the earth! Thus, O parents, could your 
children, on whom you force in tender years forms and aims 
against their nature... unfold in beauty and develop in all- 
sided harmony.” 
Dewey. — By far the most prominent and influential 
student of educational problems to-day is John Dewey.' 
One of his most important contributions is a theory 
which aims to adjust the processes of education to the 
natural development of the child through insisting that 
education is not merely a preparation for life but life 
itself. A typical expression of his point of view is the 
following quotation from his Democracy and Education: 
“Since life means growth, a living creature lives as truly and 
positively at one stage as at another, with the same intrinsic 
fullness and the same absolute claims. Hence education means 
the enterprise of supplying the conditions which insure growth, 
or adequacy of life, irrespective of age. We first look with im- 
patience upon immaturity, regarding it as something to be got 
over as rapidly as possible. Then the adult formed by such edu- 
cative methods looks back with impatient regret upon childhood 
asa plantin the garden. Froebel’s views were not well received in Germany; 
in Prussia, indeed, a law was passed in 1852 forbidding the establishment of 
kindergartens. The history of Germany might conceivably have been dif- 
ferent had the Prussian authorities taken a different attitude toward Froebel’s 
proposals. 
1 John Dewey (born 1859) organized in 1900 at the University of Chicago 
an experimental elementary school in which he demonstrated the educational 
theories that have since then profoundly affected school practice, not only in 
this country, but throughout the civilized world. Since 1904, he has been a 
professor of philosophy in Columbia University. He has acted as adviser to 
the Chinese government in the reorganization of the educational system of 
that republic, and his teachings have had a powerful influence in shaping 
the school policies projected by the Russian government. His principal edu- 
cational writings are: School and Society (Chicago, 1899); The Child and the 
Curriculum (Chicago, 1902); Interest and Effort in Hducation ( Houghtor 
Mifflin, 1913); and Democracy and Education (Macmillan, 1916).

  42 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
and youth as a scene of lost opportunities and wasted powers. 
This ironical situation will endure till ‘it is recognized that living 
has its own intrinsic quality and that the business of education 
is with that quality.” 
Teaching as the direction of growth. — From the point 
of view that emphasizes education as growth, the work 
of teaching becomes primarily that of directing growth, 
— of providing the right kind of stimulus at the time 
most favorable for the exercise that will promote growth. 
Thus the teacher, in place of being a taskmaster who 
makes arbitrary requirements and then forces the learner 
to meet these requirements, becomes a guide and a 
counselor, ever on the watch for signs that the learner 
is ready for this or that type of educative experience. 
When the child evinces a desire to learn, the teacher is 
there to help him realize this desire in the most effective 
way. 
Advantages of the conception of education as growth. — 
Although, as we have seen, the point of view that regards 
education as a process of growth is far from new, it 
has gained very widely in favor during the past few 
decades, and to-day represents the dominant educational 
theory. In many ways, it has worked a veritable trans- 
formation in the work of the schools. The kindergarten 
probably reflects this theory more clearly and more 
consistently than any other part of the school system, — 
and quite naturally, for Froebel, whom we have just 
quoted, was the ‘‘Father of the Kindergarten”; but it 
has also influenced powerfully the work of the primary 
school, and to some extent the work of the upper grades 
and the high school. Whatever may be its theoretical
-P-A-G-E-55
  WHAT IS TEACHING? 43 
justification, its great practical value lies in the fact that 
it strives to enlist from the outset the active and aggres- 
sive interest of the learner himself in the task of learning. 
Its fundamental postulate is the futility of all learning 
which does not proceed from a keenly felt need or desire 
on the part of the learner. It tends to break down the 
barrier between teacher and pupil. It makes the child 
rather than the teacher or the subject-matter the soul 
and center of the school. 
Education as vicarious experience. — Many of the 
problems involved in teaching have their origin in the 
difficulty that confronts the teacher when he attempts to 
reconcile the notion of education as growth and its 
inescapable emphasis upon learning through immediate 
experience and at the behest of immediate impulse and 
desire, with the equally inescapable need for the mastery 
of the experience of the race. Is it possible to let learning 
of the latter type await the time when a natural impulse 
or desire for such learning puts in its appearance? Can 
we delay an attack on the mechanics of reading or on 
the multiplication-tables until a real need for these useful 
tools makes a vital and compelling appeal to the imma- 
ture learner? If a natural interest in geography fails to 
evince itself, shall we let the individual remain innocent 
of geographical knowledge? If the child does not ‘‘take” 
naturally to a study of the history and government of 
his country, shall we permit him to grow up in entire 
ignorance of these subjects? 
The basic significance of the social heritage. — The fact 
that very few persons would answer these questions in 
the affirmative suggests that another principle, perhaps
-P-A-G-E-56
Re eee Pe ee ee eee 
44 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
just as fundamental as the principle of growth, must be 
recognized in the work of education. Man is what he is 
to-day very largely in virtue of the accumulated experi- 
ences of the race. Mr. Graham Wallas states that ‘the 
most important and progressive varieties of the human 
race would probably, if social inheritance were in their 
ease interrupted, die out altogether.”! He adds: 
“Tf the earth were struck by one of Mr. Wells’s comets, and if, 
in consequence, every human being now alive were to lose all the 
knowledge and habits which he had acquired from preceding gen- 
erations (though retaining all of his own powers of invention, and 
memory, and habituation), nine tenths of the inhabitants of 
London or New York would be dead in a month, and 99 per cent 
of the remaining tenth would be dead in six months. They would 
have no language to express their thoughts, and no thoughts but 
a vague reverie. They could not read notices, or drive motors 
or horses. They would wander about, led by the inarticulate 
cries of a few naturally dominant individuals, drowning them- 
selves, as thirst came on, in hundreds at the riverside landing 
places, looting those shops where the smell of decayed food at- 
tracted them, and perhaps in the end stumbling-on the expedient 
of cannibalism. ... Even in the country districts, men could not   
1Grauam Wautas: Our Social Heritage, p. 18, London, 1921. In com- 
menting on the dominance in American education ‘of the theory of education 
as natural growth, Mr. Wallas says: “...in her actual production of con- 
structive, critical, and imaginative literature, many Americans believe, with 
regret, that America does not now ‘pull her own weight in the boat’ of world- 
civilization. To a foreigner it appears as if one cause of this lies in an in- 
sufficient recognition of the need of civilized man for conscious and systematie 
intellectual effort. In the education of young children, successive move- 
ments for the reform of American common schools have been greatly influ- 
enced by the conception of the ‘natural’ growth of the human mind as ex- 
pounded by Froebel and other early nineteenth-century educationalists, by 
the coincidence of that conception with the eighteenth-century political 
ideas of ‘nature’ received from Rousseau by the Fathers of the American 
Revolution, and by the fact that the physical environment of the pioneer life 
of fifty years ago was sufficiently like that of primitive man to make it much 
safer than it is in modern New York or Chicago for him to trust to the more 
natural forms of thought. But Froebel seems to me to have helped to pro- 
duce a dangerous neglect by current American theory of the socially inherited 
elements in civilization...” (Op. cit., pp. 511.

invent, in time to preserve their lives, methods of growing food, 
or taming animals, or making fire, or so clothing themselves as 
to endure a northern winter. . . . After a few years mankind would 
almost certainly disappear from the northern and temperate 
zones. The white races would probably disappear everywhere. 
A few primitive races might live on fruit and small animals in 
those fertile tropical regions where the human species was origi- 
nally evolved, until they had slowly accumulated a new social 
heritage. After some thousands of generations they would prob- 
ably possess something which we should recognize as a language, 
and perhaps some art of taming animals and cultivating land. 
They might or might not have created what we should call a 
religion, or a few of our simpler mechanical inventions and _politi- 
cal expedients. . . .” 
Nicholas Murray Butler! is another writer who has 
strongly emphasized this conception of education. After 
insisting that education is much more than the mere 
imparting of knowledge, he goes on to say: 
“Tf education cannot be identified with mere instruction, what 
is it? What does the term mean? I answer, it must mean a 
gradual adjustment to the spiritual possessions of the race with a 
view to realizing one’s own potentialities and to assist in carrying 
forward that complex of ideas, acts, and institutions which we 
call civilization. Those spiritual possessions may be variously 
classified, but they are certainly at least fivefold. The child is 
entitled to his scientific inheritance, to his literary inheritance, to 
his esthetic inheritance, to his institutional inheritance, and to 
his religious inheritance. Without them all he cannot become a 
truly educated or a truly cultivated man.” 
Man is what he is to-day, then, not merely because of 
the unfoldment of inherent tendencies through the pro-

man of affairs. He has been president of Columbia University since 1902.

cess of “natural growth,” but also, and just as signifi- 
cantly, through the infoldment of the experience of the 
race that is made possible in each generation by the 
capacity for “vicarious” experience. It is not merely 
that the men and women who have lived in the past have 
solved problems which we shall not have to solve in the 
same laborious way if we but acquaint ourselves with the 
work that they did. This is important, but there is some- 
thing far more fundamental than this in man’s capacity 
for vicarious experience. What this something is may 
perhaps be made clear by a simple contrast. 
A few years ago the newspapers reported the case of a Ken- 
tucky mountaineer who had reached at that time the advanced age 
of one hundred thirty-three years. The precise truth of this report 
need not concern us; for the sake of the argument, let us assume 
that this mountaineer was born in 1787 and was still living a fairly 
vigorous life in 1920. His actual living experience, then, had coy- 
ered the entire period during which our country under its present 
form of government had been in existence. Great events were trans- 
piring throughout that period. There is no record that the moun- 
taineer participated in these events; but even had he been most 
fortunately cireumstanced, he could have participated in relatively 
few. Though he might have watched the flatboats and later the 
steamboats sweeping down the Ohio, he would have been far keener 
than most of his contemporaries had he grasped even an inkling 
of what that incessant stream of westward migration meant. Though 
he had seen the factories multiplying in the northeastern states and 
the railroads stretching across the western plains, neither he nor 
anyone else living at the time could have foretold the significance 
of these happenings. He was old enough in 1820 to be a member 
of Congress. That he was not a congressman is of no consequence to 
our illustration, for even had he taken part in the debate on the 
Missouri Compromise, he could not have appreciated at that time 
its bearing upon the future of the nation. He was nearly sixty
-P-A-G-E-59
  WHAT IS TEACHING? 47 
years old when the War with Mexico began. Thestory is that he tried 
to enlist in the Army at that time but was rejected because of his 
age. He lived through the years of the Civil War, some of the im- 
portant battles of which were fought near his home. He lived 
through the turbulent troubles of the reconstruction period himself 
apparently untroubled by the perplexing questions of that period. 
He lived through the decades of national expansion which brought 
the Nineteenth Century to a close, and on into the Twentieth 
Century through the years of the Great War. 
Let us now contrast with this aged mountaineer a boy of eighteen 
who in 1920 had just completed his high-school course. Let us 
assume that he was a boy of good “native’’ intelligence (as the 
mountaineer may well have been). Let us assume also that he had 
had in his twelve years of school life some very good teachers. He 
was born in 1902, let us say. But did he not also live in 1787? 
Certainly if he had had the teaching that we have assumed, he sat 
in the Constitutional Convention then assembled. He participated 
in its discussions. He took the measure of the members of the 
convention as accurately as the best judge of human nature in the 
group, — perhaps more accurately! He not only watched -the tide 
of emigrants sweep down the Ohio; he learned what this tide meant, 
—and he saw the same movement from a half-dozen other points 
of vantage; from the summits of the Appalachian passes, from the 
Erie Canal and the Great Lakes, later from the Mississippi, the 
Missouri, and the transcontinental trails. The most significant 
events of the Industrial Revolution he lived through — and saw 
their meaning. He was with Fulton on the Clermont; he helped 
Whitney invent the cotton-gin, Morse the telegraph, and McCormick 
the reaper. The black cloud of slavery he saw gathering long before 
it darkened the sky. With Lincoln he lived from 1809 to 1865, and 
perhaps he came to know the greatest American better than any of 
Lincoln’s contemporaries knew him. He witnessed the complicated 
development of modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern 
commerce. He fought through the Great War and sensed dimly 
some of the perplexing problems that it left in its trail. 
All this, of course, does not tell the whole story of this eighteen- 
year-old lad’s “vicarious” experience. We have been comparing 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
him only with a man who, we have assumed, has actually lived 
through the same period. The boy, however, has lived much longer 
than these one hundred thirty-three years. He has not only re- 
traced some of the most important epochs of human life as these 
are recorded in what we ordinarily call history: the world of men 
and things that he looks out upon is to him a vastly different world 
from what it would be did he lack the background and perspective 
that his vicarious experiences — his school “studies” — have given 
him. He has not lived through all or even an appreciable fraction 
of the long and toilsome researches by which the secrets of nature 
have been revealed, but some of them he has lived through. He can 
see in the falling apple what Newton was the first to see. He sees 
the plant-world through the eyes of Linnaeus, the animal world 
through the eyes of Cuvier, Lamarck, and Agassiz, and the whole 
world of organic life through the eyes of Darwin, Wallace, Mendel, 
and De Vries. Nor have his attitude toward and his understanding 
of his fellowmen remained uninfluenced by what the master-minds 
have learned. If it is true that he has lived with the great figures 
of history, it is also true that he has lived with the great figures 
of literature, and because he knows Hamlet and Macbeth and 
Shylock he can see in human nature something that Shakespeare 
was the first clearly to reveal. 
The unique advantages of vicarious experience. — Even 
if direct or personal experiences could be provided on a 
truly mammoth scale, then, they could not supplant the 
need for the vicarious experiences that the school with 
competent teachers can readily furnish. For the peculiar 
kind of experience which education represents, there is 
no substitute, because — r 
1. It transcends space in the sense that, through its 
influence, one may in effect live in far-distant lands, not 
infrequently gaining through vicarious experience a 
clearer conception of the conditions tzere prevailing than 
an untutored traveler could gain. 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  WHAT IS TEACHING? 49 
2. It transcends time in the sense that, through its 
influence, one may live in the past and gain a clearer con- 
ception of the conditions then prevailing than any person 
actually living at the time could have gained. 
3. It reduces to terms of individual experience the 
vast sweeps of race-experience. The individual, so to 
speak, personifies the group. The group’s struggles, 
extending over generations, become his struggles; its 
triumphs become his triumphs; — a fact of tremendous 
significance in the development of the spirit of kinship 
or brotherhood, expressed in the past not always happily 
in a narrow type of nationalism, but having within it, as 
Mr. Wells has so clearly pointed out, the possibilities of 
a common bond uniting all peoples. 
4. It enables the insights, inferences, and interpreta- 
tions of the keenest and cleverest minds to become the 
insights, inferences, and interpretations of all normal 
minds. Thus genius, rare and exotic though it be from 
the point of view of its actual appearance among human 
kind, may become through its fruits in a very practical 
way an almost universal possession. 
5. It is clearly both the condition and the agent of 
progress, permitting the accumulation and consolidation 
of gains from individual to individual, from group to 
group, and from generation to generation, and insuring 
as well the perpetuation of the ideal of progress and of its 
method. 
Teaching as the adaptation of the experience of the 
race to the capacities of the individual. — The right of 
the individual to grow or unfold or develop according to

    50 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
the natural tendencies for growth that are within him 
seems, then, to be at times paralleled and at other times 
crossed by a right that is apparently of equal importance, 
—namely, the “‘right of the individual to share in the 
spiritual life of the race.’”! Perhaps the most helpful 
way in which to regard the task of education is to take 
due account of both rights and to look upon teaching as 
the art of adapting the experience of the race to the capacities 
of the individual. Capacities are sometimes indicated by 
spontaneous impulses and desires, but this is not always 
true. There will be occasions when a satisfactory adjust- 
ment of the two rights will be extremely difficult, — but 
the criterion that should be applied in cases of doubt 
seems tolerably clear. The lessons to be derived from 
the experience of the race have an unquestioned social 
value that far transcends any value that will in all likeli- 
hood be derived from individual experiences. As Profes- 
sor Dewey has said: 
“Tt is of grace not of ourselves that we lead civilized lives. 
There is sound sense in the old pagan notion that gratitude is 
the root of all virtue. Loyalty to whatever in the established 
environment makes a life of excellence possible is the beginning 
of all progress. The best we can accomplish for posterity is to 
transmit unimpaired and with some increment of meaning the 
environment that makes it possible to maintain the habits of 
decent and refined life.” 2

THE MATERIALS OF EDUCATION: A. THE 
BASIC SOCIAL ARTS 
School subjects crystallize race experience. — Gen- 
erally speaking, the materials of education comprise the 
conquests of mankind in its struggle upward. In a very 
real sense, they are the substantial and enduring deposits 
of human experience, and their place and importance in 
education are determined very largely by the measure in 
which they enable each generation to stand upon 
shoulders of those that have gone before. 
In the school these materials, — these — of the 
experience of the race, — are organized as ‘‘subjects of 
instruction” or school “studies.” Crystallized as they 
thus are, and given specific names, such as “reading,” 
“language,” ‘‘spelling,”’ ‘“‘arithmetic,” ‘‘ geography,” 
“history,” and “science,” they not infrequently tend to 
become formal and detached. That they had their 
origin in concrete, living human experience and that they 
had and still have a large part of their value in the aid 
that they give man in solving the problems of his life 
and in controlling the forces that play upon him, are 
facts that both teacher and learner are likely to overlook. 
It is most important, then, that the teacher especially 
should not only know the materials with which he is 
dealing, but also appreciate their significance through 
an understanding of how they came into existence and 
53

54 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
in what important ways they serve to make life infinitely 
richer and more fruitful than it would be without them. 
Tue Arts oF COMMUNICATION 
Of prime significance among these materials are the 
arts of communication, and especially the language arts, 
—oral speech, reading, and writing, — which lie at the 
very basis of social life. 
The evolution of articulate speech. — We who have 
been born into a world of articulate speech must needs 
make a strenuous effort of the imagination even dimly to 
appreciate what the development of language has meant 
to humanity. No one knows how many thousands of 
generations ago our ancestors first acquired the power 
of so controlling the muscles of the lips, tongue, and 
larynx as to make at will distinct vocal sounds, but it is 
agreed by all competent students of the subject that this 
period was far back of the time when recorded history 
began, —so far back, indeed, that the time elapsing 
from the first development of the power of speech to the 
invention of writing (which made recorded history possi- 
ble) was vastly longer than the time which has elapsed 
from the invention of writing to the present day. 
Gesture, pantomime, and drawing helped in the develop- 
ment of speech.— The mere power of controlling the 
voice-muscles was, of course, only the beginning. The 
development of separate words each representing a dis- 
tinct idea or meaning was a very slow and laborious 
process. We may imagine a primitive man returning 
from the pursuit and capture of some animal desired by 
him for food, and wishing to let his companions know
-P-A-G-E-67
THE BASIC SOCIAL ARTS 55 
about his adventure. He could reproduce by gesture 
and pantomime some of the important experiences that 
he had undergone, taking now his own part, now the part 
of the animal that he was pursuing. We may imagine 
him going through the motions of running, swimming a 
stream, climbing a tree, catching the animal, beating it 
with a club; and then, quickly shifting the pantomime, 
representing the animal as panting for breath, struggling 
with its pursuer, finally sinking exhausted to receive the 
death-blow. Meantime the actor would add realism to 
his acting by repeating his own cries of fear or exultation, 
and by imitating the instinctive cries of his wounded 
prey. We may imagine, too, that he made some use of 
graphic representation, — indicating relative positions 
by sticks and stones or by crude drawings in, the sand or 
on the walls of his cave. AA 
Slowly and tortuously out of experiences such as these, 
objects and actions came to be attached to vocal sounds 
and to visual representations. Words and pictures came 
to have more or less definite meanings. Gesture and 
pantomime accompanied by more or less inarticulate 
cries undoubtedly came first; crude drawing and other 
visual methods of symbolizing experience next; and then 
the beginnings of articulate speech. But even with the 
first articulate speech, gesture and drawing probably 
served to make the meanings clearer. 
“Tf Paleolithic man had a word for ‘horse’ or ‘bear,’ he probably 
showed by tone or gesture whether he meant ‘bear is coming,’ 
‘bear is going,’ ‘bear is to be hunted,’ ‘dead bear,’ ‘bear has been 
there,’ ‘bear did this,’ and so on. Only slowly did the human 
mind develop methods of indicating action and relationship in a 
formal manner. Modern languages contain many thousands of 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
56 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
words, but the earlier languages could have consisted of only a 
few hundred. ... The growth of speech was at first a very slow 
process indeed, and grammatical forms and the expression of ab- 
stract ideas may have come very late in human history, perhaps 
only 400 or 500 generations ago.’’? 
The condition of primitive man before the develop- 
ment of language. — It is important to know that, in 
the judgment of competent students, some of these 
primitive men who were so narrowly limited in their 
ability to communicate with their fellows were physically 
equal to the most advanced peoples of the present day. 
Not only were their bones and muscles as well developed, 
but in the structure of the brain and other parts of the 
nervous system they seem to have been in no essential 
way inferior to modern man. They had the same powers 
and capacities, but they lacked something that is very 
important, — something that distinguishes modern man 
from his primitive forebears perhaps just as sharply as 
primitive man was distinguished from the more highly 
developed of the lower animals. What primitive man 
lacked that modern man possesses is the capitalized 
experience of the race, — the arts, skills, ideas, ideals, 
and standards toward the accumulation and refinement 
of which the generations of primitive peoples who worked 
out so laboriously an articulate language made the first 
start. It is well to remember our indebtedness to them, 
— an indebtedness which has been expressed by William 
James in the following eloquent passage: 
“Bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, are these half-brutish 
prehistoric brothers. Girdled about with the immense darkness 
of this mysterious universe even as we are, they were born and

  THE BASIC SOCIAL ARTS 57 
died, suffered and struggled. Given over to fearful crime and 
passion, plunged in the blackest ignorance, preyed upon by hideous 
and grotesque delusions, yet steadfastly serving the profoundest 
of ideals in their fixed faith that existence in any form is better 
than non-existence, they ever rescued triumphantly from the 
jaws of ever imminent destruction the torch of life which, thanks 
to them, now lights the world for us.” ! 
Language as the prime condition of social living. — 
The development of articulate oral speech was important, 
not only because it afforded a means of passing on the 
lessons of experience from individual to individual, but 
also because, in doing this, it brought men closer together, 
enabling them to work in codperation and to share their 
experiences. With such codperation came a common 
understanding, common sympathies, common standards, 
and common aspirations, — the basis, in short, of a 
truly social life. When the modern school teaches the 
child to use oral speech effectively, when it increases his 
vocabulary of meaningful words, and multiplies and re- 
fines the associations of these words with concrete experi- 
ence, it is doing a vast deal both to fit the individual 
for life in a highly organized social group and to make 
possible the conditions of betterment and progress 
within that group. 
The invention of writing. — Written or printed lan- 
guage greatly expands the influence of oral speech. It 
was suggested in an earlier paragraph that drawing and 
articulate speech probably developed together in the 
earlier stages of social evolution. The word and the 
picture are, in many ways, the twin symbols of man’s 
1 Wi1AM James, quoted by J. Artnur Tomson in The Outline of 
Science, vol. i, p. 175. Putnam, 1922.

58 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
progress upward. It took thousands of generations of 
experience with spoken words and pictures, however, 
before the art of picturing words was invented. The 
earliest ‘‘writings’”’ were not pictures of words, but pic- 
tures of things, which, when standardized or conven- 
tionalized, became ‘‘pictographs” or symbols of ideas. 
The development of pictographic writing was of very 
great importance, but of much broader significance was 
the invention of phonetic writing, or the use of symbols 
to represent spoken words. “Taken together, these two 
inventions are considered by some to have constituted 
the greatest event in human history. 
Written language made possible the development of 
accurate knowledge. — Whether or not we agree with this 
characterization, we cannot fail to recognize in the 
invention and refinement of the art of writing a most 
significant forward step. And the reason is clear. The 
oral word has no permanence except as it is treasured in 
memory, — and memory, as everyone knows, is always 
uncertain and sometimes treacherous. Thus while 
experiences may be accumulated and transmitted from 
generation to generation by word of mouth, — and were 
so transmitted for thousands of years, — they are likely 
to become heavily overlaid with all sorts of errors. As 
one generation after another repeats them, additions and 
subtractions are inevitable until the original story, which 
may have been thoroughly authentic and reliable, has 
become merely a tradition of which one part in ten may 
perhaps be true, while the remaining nine parts are the 
accumulated products, not of actual experience, but of 
the imagination, the fancy, and the speculation of those
-P-A-G-E-71
THE BASIC SOCIAL ARTS 59 
througn whose minds the tradition has passed. Indeed, 
if experiences can be transmitted only in this way, the 
line of least resistance is to reduce them to songs, chants, 
and rhymes, so that melody and rhythm may help the 
memory; and this process itself, while it has given the 
world some of its greatest masterpieces of imaginative 
literature, is quite likely to distort beyond all recognition 
the original truth from which the tradition may well have 
had its start. 
Written language widened the scope of social coéperation. 
—It was writing, then, that really made possible the 
accumulation and refinement of accurate knowledge. 
But in doing this, it also did something else of perhaps 
equal importance. Oral speech, as we have seen, brought 
men together in codperating groups through the capacity 
that it gave to each individual to share in the experiences 
of his immediate fellows, to profit by the lessons that they 
had learned, and to strive with them toward the realiza- 
tion of common purposes. But written language in- 
finitely extended the scope of such codperation and com- 
mon striving. It removed from mankind the shackles 
of the local and immediate. Those living in places far 
distant from one another had now a means of working 
together and thinking together; and, in a very real sense 
too, those who had lived in the past could be reincarnated 
in each generation. They could not themselves, of 
course, be reborn in the flesh; but their thoughts and 
dreams and ideals could be made to live anew in each 
oncoming group. 
Written language made possible law, property, and a 
“continuing tradition.” — With the development of 
   
-P-A-G-E-72
60 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
writing, social evolution or civilization received a pro- 
nounced impetus. Stable governments were now possi- 
ble, for laws could be crystallized in permanent form and 
administered with something akin to justice; trade and 
commerce could pass the stage of barter; and, above all, 
the institution of property became possible through the 
recording and preservation of titles. With these advan- 
tages came also the possibility of a “continuing tradi- 
tion” that served to bind people together in larger and 
larger social groups and over relatively long periods of 
time. In so far as can be learned to-day, some form of 
written language was an indispensable basis for all of 
the ancient civilizations. Accumulated culture had long 
preceded these civilizations; arts of various sorts had 
been slowly evolved and measurably perfected; but the 
relative stability and continuance that were essential 
to such civilizations as those of Egypt, Assyria, Crete, 
China, and India needed above all other arts the art of 
writing. 
Limitations of writing. — And yet the art of writing, 
epoch-making as it was, suffered under a severe handicap. 
Whether as a means of expressing one’s own thoughts 
through written symbols or as a means of interpreting 
through these symbols the thoughts of others, the art 
was difficult to acquire, and only those who had sufficient 
native wit combined with leisure and diligence could 
make use of it. The difficulties were much more numer- 
ous and appalling in connection with pictographic writing 
than later when the phonetic alphabets had been devel- 
oped. As a consequence, it was well within the range of 
possibility that a whole generation might elapse during  
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE BASIC SOCIAL ARTS 61 
which no one learned to read or write, and then the \ 
written records became meaningless and the civilization 
which they made possible quickly disintegrated. This 
has.actually happened more than once since the begin- 
ning of recorded history, and it may be a partial explana- 
tion of the death and burial of civilizations which for 
thousands of years were unknown to the generations that 
followed, and some of which have only recently been 
uncovered through the efforts of scholars who have 
puzzled out the meaning of the ancient records. 
Because it facilitated the mastery of reading and 
writing, the development of the phonetic alphabet 
greatly lessened the chance that a link would be 
missed in the chain of transmission. Even with a 
phonetic alphabet, however, the service which this 
form of communicating experience may render hu- 
manity has its limitations. As long as records had 
laboriously to be transcribed by hand, the multiplication 
of records on a wide scale was impossible, and even 
though the mastery of the reading and writing arts was 
less laborious than under the pictographic system, it 
was still far from easy, and this fact together with the 
limitation of manuscripts would still mean the restric- 
tion of these arts to a relatively small group of people. 
Universal education made both possible and neces- 
sary by printing. — We can readily see, then, why the 
invention of printing was an event of the first magnitude 
in human history, — why it is, indeed, that what we call 
“modern” history actually dates from the development 
of the printing-press in Europe. The impetus that writ- 
ing had given to ancient civilization was now widened 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
in scope and intensified in influence, — multiplied, in- 
deed, a thousand-fold, perhaps a million-fold. What 
had been the privilege and prerogative of a very few 
individuals was now open to the masses of people. Not 
at once, of course, for learning to read and write was not 
then nor is it now an easy task, and to provide schools 
and teachers costs money. There has been until recently, 
too, on the part of the governing powers in some coun- 
tries, a deliberate effort to keep the masses of the people 
from learning to read and write. But gradually through 
four centuries of struggle, mass-education in the Western 
world has become an established institution. 
Language the basic factor in social evolution. — This 
is a far ery from primitive man struggling through ges- 
tures and inarticulate cries to let his fellows know the 
joys and the sorrows that were in him. It is a far cry 
from the ancient civilizations where the great masses of 
the people lived in the densest ignorance and the most 
abject slavery, and where splendor and glory were for 
the very few, and the privileges of knowing the past and 
its secrets were for still fewer. But it is all part and 
parcel of the same great movement in social evolution, 
—a movement that has nowhere been more vividly 
depicted than in the words of Mr. Wells: 
“... From the first writings onward, a new sort of tradition, an 
enduring and immortal tradition, began in the minds of men. 
Life, through mankind, grew thereafter more and more distinctly 
conscious of itself and its world. It is a thin streak of intellec- 
tual growth we trace in history, at first in a world of tumultuous 
ignorance and forgetfulness; it is like a mere line of light coming 
through the chinks of an opening door into a darkened room; 
but slowly it widens, it grows. At last came a time in the history

  THE BASIC SOCIAL ARTS 63 
of Europe when the door, at the push of the printer, began to 
open more rapidly. Knowledge flared up, and as it flared it ceased 
to be the privilege of a favored minority. For us now that door 
swings wider, and the light behind grows brighter. Misty it still 
is, glowing through clouds of dust and reek. 
“The door is not half open; the light is but a light new lit. 
Our world to-day is only in the beginning of knowledge.” ! 
The teaching of the language arts. — The teacher 
whose business it is to teach children to read and write 
may be thought of by some people as spending his or her 
time in a humdrum, formal, and quite uninspiring task; 
but it is doubtful whether any other work in the whole 
range of human occupations is at: basis more significant 
than this. It is well, too, for the teacher to know that 
it is significant and why it is significant. The work of 
this, that, or the other primary teacher might be dropped 
to-morrow never to be resumed, — and the world would 
go on in about the same way. But if half or even a 
quarter of the primary teachers of our country were to 
quit their work, and if no substitutes could be found, it 
would be another story — and a most calamitous story. 
This does not mean, however, that merely insuring a 
mastery of reading and writing is all that the school can 
or should do. It is a very important beginning, but after 
all only a beginning. Even the low per cent of adult 
illiteracy in. many of our American states is not proof 
that the schools of those states are doing their work as 
well as they should. During the World War, the Ameri- 
can Army used a much better standard of literacy than 
is applied when the census is taken. An effort was made 
to find out not only whether the soldiers could read and 
1H. G. Weits: The Outline of History, vol. i, p. 231.

  64 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
write, but whether they could read a newspaper intelli- 
gently or write an intelligible letter. Measured by this 
standard, nearly one fourth of the enlisted men were 
found to be deficient, and their deficiencies were no doubt 
due in large part to inadequate school training. 
The beginnings of reading and writing, then, while of 
primary importance, must be supplemented by more 
advanced instruction and training in the language arts, 
and by instruction in other arts. Such studies as spelling, 
composition, and grammar represent the effort made by 
the schools to increase the pupil’s mastery of language, 
both oral and written, and to give that accuracy and 
freedom which are necessary to the adequate use of 
language as a means of social communication. 
Tue Arts or CoMPUTATION AND MEASUREMENT 
The social significance of computation and measure- 
ment. — A second group of arts are almost as important 
in education as are the arts of communication. They have 
this high rank because, like language, they are funda- 
mental to social living. These are the arts of computa- 
tion and measurement, which are represented in the 
program of the elementary school by the subject of 
arithmetic, and in the high-school and college programs 
by algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and other branches 
of “‘mathematics.’’ In a highly organized human society, 
computation and measurement are essential because 
occupations are specialized, each person doing something 
for others and in turn depending upon others for many, 
indeed most, of the goods and services that he himself 
needs. A system of exchanging products and services
-P-A-G-E-77
THE BASIC SOCIAL ARTS 65 
necessarily develops under these conditions, and with 
the continuing growth of the population and the increas- 
ing interdependence of its component units, the system 
_ of exchange becomes more and more intricate. Food- 
stuffs are exchanged in terms of pounds, tons, quarts, 
bushels, dozens, gross, hundreds, and what not. Cloth- 
ing materials are exchanged in terms of pieces, bolts, 
dozens, and yards. The value of engines and dynamos 
is determined in part by the horse-power that they 
generate. Land is bought and sold in the country by the 
acre and in the city by the front-foot. The products or 
services of one individual must be measured against some 
definite standard of value if anything like an equitable 
distribution of the burden of maintaining society is to be 
attained. Thus arise the various monetary systems 
which furnish “‘common denominators’”’ of value. The 
various individuals making up the social group must 
either learn to compute values in terms of these common 
denominators or suffer under a severe handicap in their 
dealings with others. 
Measurement the basis of accurate knowledge. — 
The brief statements just made give only a suggestion 
of the importance of measurement and computation in 
modern life. These arts are not only essential in the 
cooperative living that modern civilization has brought 
about; they are in themselves instruments of the first 
significance in the gaining of new knowledge. Science 
itself is based upon measurement, and as each science 
develops, it tends to become more and more mathemati- 
cal — which is only another way of saying that it in- 
creases the accuracy with which it measures. ‘The bal-

66 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
ance and the graduated test-tube are indispensable to 
the chemist. Practically every piece of apparatus in 
the physics laboratory is an instrument for measuring, 
for comparing measures, or for computing measures. 
Modern biology is developing its units of measurement 
and is dealing with certain phases of its investigations, 
— for example, the study of heredity, — on a distinctly 
mathematical basis. Modern psychology had its origin 
in an attempt to measure differences in the “‘intensity” 
of sensations, and its recent development has made 
increasing use of measuring devices. Even the processes 
and produets of education are being measured, and much 
of the progress that education has achieved during the 
past two decades may be traced to the success with 
which units and instruments of measurement have been 
devised and refined. 
The slow evolution of even the simplest phases of 
these arts. — It is small wonder, then, that the arts of 
measurement and computation are so important in the 
work that the school tries to do. Only the simpler and 
more universally used measures, of course, can find a 
place among the materials of elementary education, but 
this does not mean that the topics of arithmetic that are 
taught in the lower grades are unimportant, or that they 
are “simple” except by contrast with the more advanced 
phases of mathematical science. It took the race a long 
time to learn how to count beyond four or five; and it 
was a long time after the process of counting was learned 
before the system of decimal (Hindu) notation was 
developed. Even Roman civilization had to content 
itself with a much more cumbrous and ineffective method  
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE BASIC SOCIAL ARTS 67 
of representing numbers, and one who is skeptical of 
the advance which the invention of the decimal sys- 
tem made possible may gain a pronounced respect for 
this device which we now look upon as a commonplace 
by attempting to multiply, say, MDCLXVII by CLXI 
without translating the Roman into Hindu numerals. 
Even the invention of the Hindu notation did not 
mean at once the relatively facile processes that we now 
employ. The digits from 1 to 9 had been used for 
generations before the symbol for zero (0) was added. 
And some of the now familiar processes came so late 
that they may almost be looked upon as modern inven- 
tions. Clever mathematicians, for example, struggled 
for centuries with cumbrous cancellation methods in 
working the problems that we now solve by “long 
division.”” Decimal fractions were an even later devel- 
opment, — a development that, simple as it may seem 
to us now, really marked a forward step of large sig- 
nificance. 
It is well to remember, then, that the teacher who 
teaches children how to count, add, subtract, multiply, 
divide, work with fractions, compute interest, use tables 
of denominate numbers, and understand something of 
mensuration, ratio, proportion, and the metric system 
is not only helping them to a mastery of some very useful 
arts, but is also retracing with them some of the impor- 
tant steps that the race has taken in its long struggle’ 
upward from the brute and the savage. 
Formal education for a long time limited to training 
in the basic social arts. — The arts of communication, 
computation, and measurement have been so important
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
in the development of civilized society that it is small 
wonder that the work of the school should have been for 
a long time limited almost exclusively to training in these 
arts. This does not mean that education in the larger 
sense began with these materials. Far from it. Prob- 
ably long before articulate speech was well developed, 
and certainly long before the invention of writing, chil- 
dren were trained by their parents in the arts that were 
necessary in securing food and shelter. It is likely, too, 
that the primitive social group — the tribe — undertook 
to instruct the young in the tribal customs and ideals. 
If we infer regarding conditions existing in the remote 
past from the way in which savage peoples live to-day 
we may well conclude that mankind very early developed 
impressive ceremonies for initiating young people into 
the privileges and responsibilities of adulthood. This, 
with the training in the ‘‘practical” arts of hunting, 
fishing, building rude shelters, making clothing from the 
skins of animals, as well as in the arts of primitive war- 
fare, constituted a certain very important type of edu- 
cation. It was for the most part, however, an incidental 
or informal type of education; almost instinctive, in 
fact, — that is, carried on with but slight conscious pur- 
pose or recognition of its meaning. ‘‘Formal”’ or or- 
ganized and purposeful education came much later, and 
may be thought of as owing, if not its very existence, at 
least its growth and stability, to the social development 
made possible by the arts of language, computation, and 
measurement. Hence these arts, among all of the 
achievements of humankind, have had and still have the 
place of first importance in the school.

Quzstions, EXERCISES, AND PROBLEMS 
1. Find the oldest school textbooks you can on such subjects as 
reading, grammar, and arithmetic, and compare with modern text- 
books in the same subjects. (Every institution that prepares teachers 
should have a collection of such old textbooks, and each generation 
of students should add to the collection.) 
2. At about what age do normal children begin to babble? to 
use words? to make sentences? If a child did not hear any language 
at all, at what age would he begin to talk? What if he were con- 
genitally deaf? How, then, does social environment influence the 
development of a child’s language? What new “slang” have you 
learned since last June? Explain the process by which you 
learned it. 
3. Suppose you were shipwrecked on an island inhabited by civ- 
ilized people who spoke a language unknown to you. How could 
you communicate with them? How would a mastery by you of a 
hundred of their words help you? Name ten of the English equiva- 
lents that you would place in the first one hundred words to be 
learned. Answer the same questions on the supposition that the 
inhabitants .of the island were uncivilized but had an oral language 
with one thousand words. How would you proceed to teach these 
uncivilized people a written language? What civilizing effect would 
a written language have on these uncivilized people? 
4. Who invented the art of printing by movable type? How does 
a linotype machine operate? How is printing paper made? If 
printing should become a “lost art,’ what would be the effect on 
modern business? on government? 
5. Who taught you to read? By what method were you taught? 
In what ways is the ability to read serviceable to you? Do you 
know a person who is illiterate? How many illiterates are there 
in the United States? In your State? In your county? In your 
town? Find in the latest United States Census the illiterates by 
age-groups. Put in parallel columns the facts for the preceding 
census period and explain the differences. 
6. Consult any standard dictionary for the following terms: 
measure, foot, yard, rod, mile, pound, ton, ounce, bushel, peck, gallon,

quart, pint, gill, dram. What is the metric system? What are its 
advantages? Why is it not universally adopted? 
7. What are the “Three R’s”? Were they ever adequate to the 
social needs of people? If so, what things have since made them 
inadequate? 
8. What has brought about what we call progress? What sus- 
tains, supports, or continues progress? What will cause progression? 
(Consult a dictionary for the meaning of progress and progression.) 
9. What relation has the work of the public school to progress 
and progression?

THE MATERIALS OF EDUCATION: B. THE 
LIBERAL STUDIES 
“Form” subjects and “content” subjects. — The 
materials discussed in the preceding chapter are some- 
times called the ‘‘form’’ subjects because they deal 
primarily with the framework of language and number. 
Sometimes, too, they are referred to as “tool” subjects 
because they are indispensable instruments for gaining 
knowledge. Perhaps they might be more fittingly 
termed the ‘‘key’’ subjects, for their mastery unlocks 
the door to the accumulated wisdom of the ages. Any 
of these designations, however, would be unfortunate if 
it tempted one to forget the fact that these “form” or 
“tool” or “key” subjects are in themselves a most 
important part of this accumulated wisdom. The 
teacher especially should appreciate their significance 
as well as understand their structure and acquire skill 
in their application. 
The ‘‘form” subjects are sometimes contrasted with 
such studies as geography, history, civics, literature, and 
the natural sciences, which are often referred to as “‘con- 
tent” subjects. The contrast may again be helpful if 
one does not forget that anything that is “learned” may 
become an instrument in promoting further learning. 
The content studies are essentially “liberalizing” in 
their effect. — Much more important is the conception 
of the ‘‘content’’ subjects as a means by which the

widening of experience and the deepening of experience 
become possible once the ‘‘tools of knowledge” are at 
the command of the learner. They are the principal 
agencies or vehicles of that vicarious experience the 
importance of which was emphasized in Chapter II. 
It is chiefly through these studies that the “time hori- 
zon”’ and the “space horizon” may be immeasurably 
widened. It is chiefly through these studies that the 
individual may re-live the great epochal experiences of 
the race. It is chiefly these studies that must be de- 
pended upon to provide that basic ‘‘common culture” 
which makes collective thinking and collective action 
possible among vast numbers of people and thus lays 
the basis of an effective democracy. Because they 
enable men to transcend the limits of individual ex- 
perience, — to break through the barriers of the local 
and the immediate,— these studies are essentially 
“liberalizing,” or (better) liberating, in their influence. 
Hence we shall refer to them in this book as the “lib- 
eral” studies. 
All subjects may be studied from the liberal point of 
view. — It should be said most emphatically, however, 
that no group of school subjects has a monopoly of this 
liberalizing or liberating influence. The basic social 
arts that we discussed in Chapter II, and the ‘“prac- 
tical arts”’ that will be the theme of Chapter V, can be 
made thoroughly liberal in their organization, their 
spirit, and their effect. There are, however, some sub- 
jects the primary justification of which must be sought 
and found almost exclusively in the liberalizing effect 
of their mastery, and among these the so-called “con-

tent”’ subjects of the elementary and high-school pro- 
grams have a most important place. In the present 
chapter a few of the basic types of these essentially liberal 
studies will be discussed with particular reference to 
their fundamental meaning as materials of universal 
education. 
GEOGRAPHY AS A LIBERAL STupy 
Geography and national history were the first of the 
“content” subjects to be recognized in modern elemen- 
tary education — and for a fundamental reason. Geog- 
raphy in a very real sense widens the space-horizon; 
history in an analogous fashion widens the time-horizon. 
The one carries the learner beyond the narrow confines 
of his own locality; the other carries him beyond the 
confines of the immediate present. 
The human significance of geography. — Under the 
proper conditions, the study of geography may become 
not only an informing description of the earth as the 
home of mankind; not only a fascinating account of how 
millions of people, whom we have never seen, live and 
work; but also an inspiring revelation of some very im- 
portant phases of human progress. In other words, 
geography is not only a collection of facts; it is itself a 
record of experience, —of struggles and disappoint- 
ments and achievements. Again it is important that 
the teacher not only know the facts but also appreciate 
in some measure what these facts have cost and what 
they have meant in human life. 
The “common” vs. the “‘commonplace.’’ — It is a com- 
monplace to-day, for example, that the earth is “round

  74 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
like a ball.’ For generations children have learned this 
phrase. They have seen and twirled the school globe 
and have been told that this globe represents the form 
of the earth on which they live. The illusion of a flat 
world has little chance of lodgment in their minds. 
From the very outset they are enabled to avoid one of the 
gross errors to which for thousands of generations even 
the keenest and cleverest minds of the race were subject. 
But just because the fact of the earth’s rotundity is a 
matter of common knowledge to-day, its true significance 
is likely to be missed. It becomes one of those things 
that are ‘‘taken for granted.”” Obviously, although the 
fact is a matter of common knowledge, it is very far 
from a commonplace fact;! its establishment as a fact’ 
was very far from a commonplace achievement; and the 
influence of its establishment upon human life and 
human destiny was very far from a commonplace influ- 
ence. To teach children the fact that the earth is 
round may seem to the public and even to the teacher 
a simple and perfunctory and not very important task. 
But to lead each generation to an appreciation of what 
this part of its heritage has cost, what it has meant, and 
what it still means is not simple nor unimportant, nor 
can it be done successfully through lifeless and perfunc- 
tory teaching. 
What the map-symbolism has cost.— As the pupil 
progresses in the study of geography, he soon gains an 
1 For this distinction between the ‘‘common’’ and the commonplace”’ the 
writers are indebted to President Livingston C. Lord, of the Eastern Illinois State Teachers College. Dr. Lord (born 1851), himself a remarkable teacher, is widely known as an unusually keen judge of teaching. Many men now 
prominent in educational leadership were selected by him in their earlier years 
and given an opportunity to develop. 
‘

initial acquaintance with a new set of symbols that have 
been almost as important in human progress as have 
words and numerals. These are the map-symbols, and 
to be able to read a rich meaning into the lines, dots, 
shades, and colors of modern maps is a most important 
objective in teaching and learning geography. And 
what efforts the construction of these maps has cost! 
There are the efforts of map-makers and printers and 
lithographers which have been so important in giving us 
clear and accurate maps. There are the penetrating 
studies of the long list of mathematicians who have 
taught mankind how to reckon longitude and determine 
latitude, how to survey or measure vast distances with 
minute accuracy, and how to represent curved surfaces 
on flat “projections.” Good maps would be impossible 
without these devices and instruments and large credit 
must be given to those who, generation after generation, 
have made these advances possible. Then, too, we have 
the scientists who have discovered and formulated the 
laws that govern climate, prevailing winds, and ocean 
currents, all of which are important items of our present 
knowledge of geography and each of which has its part 
to play in the map-symbolism. Finally, back of the work 
of the map-makers, the mathematicians, and the scien- 
tists lie the pioneer efforts of the discoverers and ex- 
plorers who penetrated into the unknown and brought 
back the ‘‘raw materials”’ so to speak, — the immediate 
experiences, — out of which geographical knowledge has 
been refined. 
The study of geography as a series of adventures. — 
To “study” geography should certainly mean for each

pupil in school some glimmer, at least, of these deeper 
human meanings. Most people would consider them- 
3 selves very fortunate indeed if they could take a voyage 
to the South Seas, or journey through Central Africa, 
or paddle down the Mackenzie through the glories of 
the Canadian summer. Only one in a million, perhaps, 
may actually have one or another of these opportunities. 
But practically everyone who has learned to read may 
take vicariously not only these but a thousand other 
adventurous journeys, and in so doing may have a very 
decided advantage over an unlettered traveler who 
through accident or good fortune happened to take a few 
' of them in the flesh. The South Seas may be explored in 
the company of no less a personage than Captain Cook; 
Livingstone and Stanley stand ready to act as guides 
along the great rivers, and through the jungles, and over 
the plateaus of equatorial Africa; and one might actually 
paddle down the Mackenzie and gain far less from the 
experience than one could secure in a fraction of the time 
by following Mackenzie himself on the first voyage that 
a white man ever made down that interesting stream. 
The civic value of knowing other lands and other 
peoples. — To say that geography may ‘‘widen one’s 
space-horizon,” then, is more than a mere phrase. Some- 
thing of the breadth of outlook that the actual experi- 
ences give to a favored few (and only to a favored 
few) of those who travel may be gained through vica- 
rious travel if the teacher’s guidance be adequate. And 
beyond the broadened outlook that comes from an intelli- 
gent acquaintance with other lands and other peoples 
there may well be the priceless privilege of knowing
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE LIBERAL STUDIES 77 
intimately the great travelers of all the ages from Strabo 
and Hanno and Marco Polo to Nansen and Scott, Sven 
Hedin, Amundsen, and Peary. 
It is clear too that, with the development of modern 
civilization, an appreciative knowledge of other countries 
and other peoples has become increasingly important, 
not only to scholars and statesmen, but to all who have 
a vote and a voice in determining national policies, — 
and under the conditions of modern democracy this 
means practically everyone. ‘Breadth of outlook” 
and a ‘‘ widened space-horizon’’ become, then, very much 
more than merely individual advantages. They are 
essential attributes of the kind of thinking that every 
intelligent citizen must do if he is to play well his part 
in the business of self-government. 
Geography reveals the adjustment of natural resources to 
human needs. — The proper teaching and the proper 
study of geography will reveal the outstanding conquests 
that man has made over the material objects and forces 
that surround him, — his conquest of his material envi- 
ronment. To learn in a concrete and vivid fashion whence 
come the commodities of everyday use, — our food, our 
clothing, our tools and machinery, the materials from 
which our buildings are constructed, — and at what 
cost of human effort these commodities are grown, mined, 
manufactured, transported, exchanged, and finally placed 
in our possession, — is an important step toward under- 
standing the complexity of modern society and toward 
appreciating the service that social organization renders 
to the individual, and the debt that every individual 
owes to those who codperate in providing for his needs. 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
A keen sense of this interdependence, if widely spread 
among all of the people through the agencies of universal 
education, will do much to eliminate the danger of radical 
social upheavals, both by impressing the toiler with the 
basic importance and the essential dignity of his work, 
and by stigmatizing as social parasites those who live in 
idle luxury. It is by no means an accident that the 
peoples that have been least subject to political and 
social revolutions in the critical years following the 
Great War are those among whom elementary educa- 
tion had been made most nearly universal in the gen- 
erations preceding. 
Geography impresses the need of conserving natural 
resources. — The proper study of geography will also do 
much to insure a keen appreciation of the priceless value 
of natural resources; a salutary resentment against those 
who devastate the forests, impoverish the soil, or draw 
wastefully or extravagantly upon the limited stores of 
coal and petroleum; and above all a social conscience that 
will impel each generation to keep in mind the needs of 
those that are to follow. Again it is the education of all 
that is needed here. The conservation of natural re- 
sources must become a national standard, — ultimately, 
through coéperation among the teachers of all civilized 
nations, a world standard. 
Geography an elementary sociology. — Geography has 
been a recognized part of the elementary-school pro- 
gram of studies for approximately a century. During 
that time its materials have been not only refined and 
adapted to the capacities of children, but also pointed 
more and more consciously and with increasing effec-
-P-A-G-E-91
THE LIBERAL STUDIES 79 
tiveness toward the social outcomes some of which have 
been discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The older 
meaning of geography (literally, a description of the 
earth) had been both expanded and limited, — expanded 
to include many materials from such sciences as astron- 
omy, meteorology, anthropology, and economics in 
addition to the basic earth-science, geology; and limited 
in the sense that human life and its needs have become 
the center of organization for all of these materials. The 
study of geography to-day is in reality an elementary 
(or better, an elemental) study of sociology. 
History as A LIBERAL STUDY 
The broadened scope of history as a school subject. — 
The reader will have noted that, from one point of view, 
all of the school subjects so far considered may be 
thought of as phases of the subject that we call history. 
That is, they are records of human experience. We do 
not usually think of them as historical in their character 
because we have come to associate the word “‘history” 
almost exclusively with the story of the growth of nations 
and the development of political institutions. Of late 
there has been a decided tendency to broaden the scope 
of the historical studies that are included in the school 
program. Relatively less emphasis is given to changes 
in government and to the warfare which such changes 
have so often involved, while a far stronger emphasis is 
given to the development of commerce, industry, agri- 
culture, education, literature, and art. There are some 
students of the problem, too, who would teach history 
almost exclusively in connection with problems that
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
arise in the study of other subjects, abandoning the 
systematic study of history as such. _ 
It is questionable, however, whether the systematic 
study of history can be replaced by merely tracing the 
origin of present’ problems or by weaving into the treat- 
ment of other subjects the fascinating story of their 
development. What history may accomplish as a 
systematic study is so important, so significant to our 
common life, that it could be dispensed with only at a 
very great loss. 
The consciousness of a common past as a social 
“binder.”” — What is this important something that the 
systematic study of history may provide? <A suggestion 
toward an answer to this question may be found in the 
preceding chapter. In emphasizing the significance of 
the art of writing, we said that with writing came “the 
possibility of a continuing tradition that served to bind 
people together in larger and larger social groups.” It is 
this consciousness of a common past that forms the basis 
of all national groups. Even primitive peoples have 
recognized this fact, — perhaps more or less dimly but 
none the less effectively. Almost instinctively they have 
striven to keep alive the traditions of the tribe, the clan, 
the embryo nation. The development of writing, as 
we have seen, made this a much easier process, and the 
development of printing has made the complete loss of 
tradition almost an impossibility. With the evolution 
of universal education, one of the primary duties laid 
upon the schools of every country has been to preserve 
and strengthen the national ideals as these are reflected 
in the nation’s history.

The development of national unity as a function of the 
study of history.— There has been much discussion, 
especially since the World War, as to the advisability of 
thus perpetuating and intensifying the nationalistic 
spirit through the study of national history. It is held 
by some people that a permanent peace among the 
nations is impossible as long as each nation indoctrinates 
its children with its own “patriotic” ideals. A few, 
indeed, have even gone so far as to advocate a complete 
break with the past, — a gigantic effort to erase tradition 
and to begin anew with a ‘‘clean slate.” Not many 
serious students of the problem, however, would take 
so extreme a view. Nor has the outcome of the War 
been in any way favorable toward a diminution of the 
nationalistic spirit. Old nations, long submerged within 
overgrown empires, have been revived, — Poland, Fin- 
land, Esthonia, Czechoslovakia; new nations have been 
formed from the union of contiguous peoples that have 
long been related in language and tradition, — Yugo- 
slavia; and the national pride of each of the countries 
associated as victors in the struggle has been given a vast 
access of new strength through the very fact of struggle 
and victory. 
The dangers of a narrow nationalism. — It is fairly 
clear, then, that the time is not opportune for so drastic 
a process as ‘‘breaking with the past,” even if this were 
either humanly possible or socially desirable. But this 
does not mean that education may not do something, — 
and in the end perhaps a very important something, — 
to keep national pride within bounds, to prevent aggres- 
sion, promote international good-will, and make im-

probable if not impossible another world conflict. And 
it may be that the study of history, which has been 
blamed for many of the evils of nationalism, can itself 
be directed toward an elimination of these evils while, 
at the same time, it preserves the unquestioned benefits 
which the consciousness of membership in a national 
group involves. In other words, the best hope for a 
permanent and enduring peace may well lie, not in the 
probably futile attempt to forget history, but rather in 
a broader and richer and more penetrating study of 
history. 
Let us try to see how this may be brought about by 
first learning why it is that the study of history has so 
profound an influence upon the way in which men think 
and feel and act. 
The psychology of patriotism. — It will be recalled 
that in Chapter II we contrasted with a youth who had 
lived vicariously through the important events of our 
country’s history an unlettered mountaineer who had 
actually lived through the same period. In setting forth 
the advantages of education through vicarious experi- 
ence, this statement was made: “‘It reduces to terms of 
individual experience the vast sweeps of race-experience. 
The individual, so to speak, personifies the group. The 
group’s struggles, extending over generations, become 
his struggles; its tragedies become his tragedies; and its 
triumphs, his triumphs.”’ 
If the reader will analyze the feeling that he has when 
he speaks of “‘My country,” he will find, we believe, 
that he has actually thought of himself as playing a 
part in the events that constitute its history. These
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE LIBERAL STUDIES 83 
things belong to you, and they form a powerful bond 
uniting you with all others who share the same possession. 
You have the feeling that what you are now is due in 
large part to these happenings in which you have vicari- 
ously participated. The members of a family are bound 
together, not alone by ‘‘blood relationship,” but also 
and perhaps more strongly, by an identity of experi- 
ences. Under conditions which were once universal 
and which are even now fairly prevalent, the members 
of the family lived a very intimate life of common 
thought, common feeling, and common striving, and it is 
these common experiences that engender common sym- 
pathies, affections, and loyalties. Where these are sup- 
plemented by honored traditions cf what one’s forebears 
have accomplished, the binding force of these common 
experiences is immeasurably strengthened. 
Now patriotism is, in a very real sense, only a gener- 
alization, a broadening, of this family loyalty and 
devotion. In our country, indeed, where “family” has 
lost much of the prestige that it has in other countries, 
patriotism may almost be said to be a substitute for the 
older sentiment. It provides something that human 
nature seems to crave, — something to identify one’s 
self with, to revere, to be loyal to. Mr. H. E. Bourne 
traces this connection of patriotism with family pride by 
referring to the force and fineness of the ideal expressed 
in the phrase ‘‘noblesse oblige”’: 
“Why does ‘nobility oblige’? Simply because the boy or man 
has entered into a larger realization of what he is through his 
knowledge of the traditions of the house. In the same way the 
honorable record of a regiment, of a ship of the line, the tradi-

84 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tions of even-handed justice that surround certain courts, elevate 
and clarify the consciousness of the men who make up their 
personnel. So the boy and the girl may, through the proper 
study of history, learn better to know themselves in relation to 
their community, their State, and their country... . 
“Tf a boy be told to love his country, he might properly in- 
quire, What is my country? It would not be enough to show 
him a list of the States, or the flag, or to name the leading poli- 
tician who happened to be President. His real country has much 
that is invisible built into its very structure. It is Washington’s 
long struggle to found and organize the republic; it is Jefferson’s 
dream of democratic equality; it is the deeds and words of men 
who from period to period guided public opinion and settled the 
national policy, of those who spread civil communities from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific, who built up our industries and laid the 
foundations of our national life. Each act in all the great drama 
has added its bit to the reality of the whole.” ! 
It would seem, then, that the popular demand that 
the schools, whatever else they do, must “teach patriot- 
ism” has back of it something that is both fine and fun- 
damental. The danger is incurred when, at the behest 
of those who have selfish or partisan interests to pro- 
mote, the teaching of patriotism becomes a teaching of 
one-sided or distorted history. A most serious defect 
in the teaching of our own national history, for example, 
is the fallacious assumption that it began in 1776, — or 
at the earliest in 1492. As a matter of fact, the roots of 
our present American institutions lie in the remote past, 
and out of that past have grown, not only our institu- 
tions, but those of other nations many of whose people 
have come to our shores, bringing with them traditions, 
ideals, and points of view some of which will inevitably

THE LIBERAL STUDIES 85 
be woven into the fabric of our national life, and which 
we should consequently be in a position to understand 
and evaluate. 
World history as a check against a narrow national- 
ism. — Beyond this, however, is another and a more 
vital issue. Beyond the national jealousies and preju- 
dices and superstitions that tend to keep the world in’ 
discord is the common past of humanity itself, to re- 
live which, in the sense in which each nation re-lives 
its own history, may do much to bring peoples together. 
Viewed in this way, the study of history, while still pre- 
serving the finest elements in the traditions of each 
nation, may well furnish the basis of a common under- 
standing, a common sympathy, and a common respect. 
It was with this idea in mind that Mr. H. G. Wells 
wrote his Outline of History. Whether or not he has 
overrated the influence of historical study, his motive 
is one with which it would be impossible to quarrel, and 
the ideal that he has projected is worthy of the most 
serious consideration: 
“The need for a common knowledge of the general facts of 
human history throughout the world has become very evident 
during the tragic happenings of the last few years. Swifter means 
of communication have brought all men closer to one another for 
good or for evil. War becomes a universal disaster, blind and 
monstrously destructive; it bombs the baby in its cradle and sinks 
the food-ships that cater for the non-combatant and the neutral. 
There can be no peace now, we realize, but a common peace in 
all the world; no prosperity but a general prosperity. But there 
can be no common peace and prosperity without common. historical 
ideas. Without such ideas to hold them together in harmonious 
coéperation, with nothing but narrow, selfish, and conflicting 
national traditions, races and peoples are bound to drift toward

  86 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
conflict and destruction. This truth, which was apparent to that 
great philosopher Kant a century or more ago . . . is now plain to 
the man in the street... . / A sense of history as the common ad- 
venture of all mankind is as necessary for peace within as it is for 
peace between the nations.’’? 
Mr. Wells’s phrase, ‘‘a sense of history as the common 
adventure of all mankind,” brings out clearly the sig- 
nificant and unique characteristic of the study of history. 
Even though one may disagree with Mr. Wells as to the 
importance of the study of world history, this statement 
of what history really accomplishes in education is a 
contribution of no small value. <A ‘“‘sense”’ of American 
history as ‘‘the common adventure” of all Americans 
may, in any case, be accepted as a worthy objective in 
American education. 
History as a dynamic force. — What has been said is 
perhaps sufficient to show that, while the “ideas” 
taught and learned in the history classes do not affect 
conduct in the direct and unequivocal fashion in which 
the ideas taught in the arithmetic, language, and hygiene 
classes affect conduct, they nevertheless may have, and 
unquestionably in many cases do have, a deep and last- 
ing influence. A certain kind of history taught with 
unceasing vigilance for more than forty years was no 
small factor in impelling the German people to follow 
their leaders in the effort to make for their nation a 
“place in the sun.” Another kind of history taught 
with equal vigilance in the French schools over the same 
period was no small factor in the blighting of Germany’s 
ambitions. One cannot view such processes and still 
1H. G. Weis: The Outline of History, vol. i, p. 6. Macmillan, 1920.
-P-A-G-E-99
THE LIBERAL STUDIES 87 
maintain that the study of history is merely a ‘“‘cul- 
tural” activity without influence on the “practical” 
affairs of life. On the contrary, when one considers 
large groups of people, such as those that make up the 
modern nations, one may reasonably conclude that no 
part of the school program has a more profound bearing 
upon a nation’s character and a nation’s destiny. 
LireratTure as A LiperRAL Stupy 
The significance of imaginative experiences. — We 
turn now to a third group of the liberal studies, — the 
group that is most clearly represented in the school pro- 
gram by literature, but which, in a comprehensive treat- 
ment of the field, would also include the products of the 
other ‘‘fine arts,’’— music, painting, sculpture, and 
architecture. The essence of the fine arts and especially 
of literature lies in the fact that they are records, not 
primarily of actual happenings, but of imaginings. It 
is hardly too much to say, indeed, that the greatest 
literature is a record not of facts but of dreams. What 
justification (it may be asked) has so expensive a process 
as public, universal education to deal with anything so 
unreal as dreams when a substantial world of facts lies 
all around in space, and when an almost equally sub- 
stantial world of facts lies back of us in time? 
The recreative value of such experiences. — The 
answer to this question involves the recognition of a 
fundamental truth; the truth, namely, that the human 
mind is constantly projecting itself beyond the world of 
actualities, beyond what is or has been, into the realm of 
what may be and,—even more importantly, — what
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
should be. It is not only impossible for the individual 
to escape this tendency, — it is one of the privileges of 
life that he can look beyond the actual into the world 
that his imagination opens to him. In the first place, 
it is there that he is most likely to find relief from the 
burdens and perplexities of everyday existence, to “‘re- 
create’’ himself with new hopes and new visions. Even 
if we admit that an overindulgence of this tendency 
may result in the futile dreaming of the visionary, we 
must also admit that its temperate indulgence is in a 
very real sense a source of renewed strength and renewed 
hope. 
Imaginative experiences as the source of dynamic 
ideals and standards. — The influence of imaginative 
experiences strikes much deeper than this, however. 
The best products of literature and of the other fine arts 
are not only the means to a wholesome and upbuilding 
recreation, they are also records or interpretations of the 
most penetrating and dynamic of human experiences. 
We do not ask whether ‘‘Hamlet” is true to fact; we 
ask rather whether it is true to life; and by that we 
mean, Does it reveal or portray something that every 
normal mind will recognize as worthy, — as “‘true” in 
the most fundamental, human sense? The great novel 
or the great drama may create a quite imaginary situa- 
tion, perhaps with an almost complete illusion of reality 
as in Robinson Crusoe, perhaps with so fantastic and 
impossible a setting as Alice in Wonderland; but through 
this created situation something of recognized worth 
shines out. This something may take the form of an 
ideal, an aspiration, a standard for judging character
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE LIBERAL STUDIES 89 
and conduct, a revelation of the interplay of motives, 
an interpretation of life in one or more of its countless 
phases. What we find above all in literature is a record 
of the way in which some of the most gifted minds of all 
time have thought and felt about the deeper and more 
persistent problems of life, —the problems which, in 
spite of the advances that science and invention make 
possible, must be faced afresh by each generation. 
Literature deals with the persistent problems of 
human life. — The emphasis upon the persistent char- 
acter of these problems is of the utmost importance. 
We do not go to the works of the Greek physician, 
Galen, for our knowledge of medicine; nor do we go to 
the books of the old Roman writers on agriculture to 
learn how to grow crops and feed cattle. Modern sci- 
ence has developed far beyond the point that the Greeks 
and Romans reached. The external world to-day is a 
quite different world from that in which they lived. 
But there are some things that do not change. Men 
still love and hate and strive and suffer. Human nature 
does not change; and one may still find in the literature 
of the remote past interpretations of human nature and 
portrayals of human character that are unsurpassed if 
not unequaled in the modern world. 
The ethical implications of literature. — If one were 
to ask whether literature affects life the answer would 
be unequivocal. Literature has influenced profoundly 
the way in which men think and feel and act because it 
has revealed and formulated ideals toward which to 
strive and standards for judging conduct. In this re- 
spect its influence is analogous to, although not identical  
-P-A-G-E-102
90 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
  with, that of religion. The teaching of religious doc- 
trines is not a part of the program of American public 
schools, hence literature is probably the most effective 
vehicle at the command of the schools for imparting the 
fundamental ideals of life and conduct. This does not 
mean that everyone who ‘‘takes a course”’ in literature 
will for that reason accept and act upon the ideals and 
standards that are revealed through the literature which 
is studied. (For that matter, does everyone who at- 
tends church and Sunday school act consistently with 
religious teachings?) It does mean, however, that the 
ideals and standards are there, and that a good teacher 
of literature may do much to make them dynamic forces 
in the lives of his or her pupils, — although perhaps the 
one thing that good teachers of literature would not do 
is directly to preach a moralizing sermon with a master- 
piece of literature as a text! 
The unique contribution of literature to life. — Lit- 
erature, then, does not constitute an exception to our 
general principle that the materials of education are, 
in a final analysis, products and records of human ex- 
perience. The kind of experience that produces great 
literature, however, is of a somewhat different order 
from the kind of experience that has produced arith- 
metic, geography, and history. Literature is an inter- 
pretation of life, —in Matthew Arnold’s famous phrase, 
a “‘eriticism of life,’ — rather than a record of actual 
happenings or a description of actual objects. When 
we read Stanley’s account of what he found in Central 
Africa, we may be able in imagination to see Central 
Africa very much as we might have seen it had we ac-  
-P-A-G-E-103
THE LIBERAL STUDIES 91 
companied Stanley on his journeys. But we might 
live through a long span of life in intimate contact with 
all sorts and conditions of men and not see in human 
nature what Shakespeare saw. It was the essence of 
Shakespeare’s genius that he could detect traits of human 
nature that others could not see; but once he caught 
these traits and crystallized them in his writings, they 
became relatively clear even to average minds. 
The importance of portraying human character in 
types. —It is this keen characterization of human 
nature in type forms that gives to the masterpieces of 
imaginative literature much of their value as materials 
of education. Shylock is a symbol of avarice, Macbeth 
of vacillation, Othello of jealousy ; Micawber will go down 
the ages as the outstanding example of respectable and 
well-meaning inefficiency; Becky Sharp and Hester 
_ Prynne represent contrasting types of womanhood; Tom 
Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn are concrete, living em- 
bodiments of most of the good and some of the evil that 
is in every boy. These and the other great characters 
that our literature portrays have played and will continue 
to play a very important part in the life of English- 
speaking peoples. They give us common standards of 
comparison, common terms in which to discuss the 
problems that arise in dealing with men and women and 
children. Beyond this, too, they give us concrete and 
definite pictures of types of conduct that we recognize 
clearly as worthy or unworthy of emulation.' 
1 Nor is the value of literature as a source of common ideas and common 
standards limited to these portrayals of individual character as revealed in 
individual conduct. Fiction and the drama portray also community and 
group types. Mr. Sinclair Lewis’s conception of Main Street may or may 
not live on as a dynamic idea in future generations, but the rapidity with  
-P-A-G-E-104
  
92 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
  
The fundamental influence of children’s literature. 
The instances that we have just cited do not in general 
represent the kind of literature that children will read in 
the lower grades. What is true, however, of the master- 
pieces that are addressed to the mature mind holds with 
even greater force for the literature of childhood. While 
the latter may be simpler than the former, it is often 
older and far more fundamental. Even the children’s 
“classics” that bear the names of modern authors are 
not infrequently modern versions of world-old stories, — 
Hawthorne’s Wonder-book and Tanglewood Tales, for 
example. Probably no literature that is to-day extant 
has had a longer life than have the folk-lore, the fairy 
tales, and even the nursery rhymes that delight genera- 
tion after generation of children. The teacher who 
deals with these fundamental forms of literature will do 
well to form some acquaintance with their history, and 
to recognize what powerful forces the ideas and ideals 
that they represent may be in the later lives of the boys 
and girls who read them or listen to them with such keen 
enjoyment. There is doubtless a far deeper influence 
at work here than most of us recognize, — certainly a 
far deeper influence than we can definitely trace. It 
is probably in connection with these fundamental and 
appealing materials that one of Mr. Wells’s keen obser- 
vations finds its chief justification: 
“The driving force that makes for either peace or war is engen- 
dered where the young are taught. The teacher — whether 
which the term became current is proof that the author succeeded in making 
clear and definite something that a great many people recognized once it was set forth, — something, undoubtedly, that they had been dimly conscious of and had probably struggled themselves to express.

mother, priest, or schoolmaster — is the real maker of history; 
rulers, statesmen, and soldiers do but work out the possibilities 
of codperation or conflict that the teacher creates. This is no 
rhetorical flourish; it is sober fact. The politicians and masses of 
our time dance on the wires of their early education.” 
Tue Liperar Stupy or THE NatTurAL SCIENCES 
The rapid development of the natural sciences. — No 
departments of human knowledge have grown and 
expanded within the past half-century as have the natural 
sciences, — astronomy, physics, chemistry, geology, bot- 
any, and zodlogy. Our age is preéminently the age of 
science. Not a year passes without its new “marvels” 
of discovery in this field of endeavor. Not a year passes 
that does not witness some profound change in the condi- 
tions of everyday living for which the scientist is pri- 
marily responsible. Of all of the fundamental forces that 
to-day are working toward the improvement of human 
life, science is far and away the most powerful. 
The ideals and methods of science. — The unques- 
tioned achievements of the natural sciences give to the 
ideals and methods of science a place of paramount im- 
portance as parts of the precious heritage with which 
education deals, and which it is the teacher’s chief duty 
to ‘transmit unimpaired and with some increment of 
meaning” to each succeeding generation. It is these 
ideals and methods of science that lie back of the achieve- 
ments, — it is these that have made the achievements 
possible. It would, indeed, be a great loss if the material 
products of science were suddenly and completely 
swept away; but if the spirit and ideals and methods of 
scientific study remained, the loss of the products would 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
94. AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
  not be irreparable. If, however, the spirit and ideals 
and methods of science should be lost, the products them- 
selves would not long remain. Such a loss would be a 
calamity of the first order; it would mean nothing less 
than the death of our civilization. It is well for us to 
remember that earlier civilizations disappeared from the 
face of the earth, not because their material products 
were destroyed, but because the spirit and the ideals 
which lay back of the products faded from the minds of 
men. 
The study of science in the universal school. — It 
would seem, then, that the modern universal school 
should lay a very heavy emphasis upon the teaching and 
study of the natural sciences. As a matter of fact, the 
study of the sciences as such has still a place of very slight 
importance in universal education. This does not mean 
that those who have been responsible for the develop- 
ment of elementary education have not recognized the 
importance of science and the need of giving it a place in 
the school program; they have done something, but in 
spite of their sincere efforts, the problem still remains 
unsolved. In the elementary school, ‘‘nature study” 
has come closer to complete failure than has any other 
school subject. In the high school, the natural sciences — 
have had a wider recognition, but the results as far as 
the great masses of pupils are concerned have been 
admittedly meager. The solution of the problem of 
science teaching, both in the elementary school and in the 
high school, still lies in the future. 
Some reasons why the teaching of science as such has been 
neglected in the lower schools. — An intelligent effort to
-P-A-G-E-107
  
THE LIBERAL STUDIES 95 
solve this problem should aim first to find the reasons for 
the unsatisfactory results so far attained. Certain 
conditions that have stood in the way of a solution may 
be briefly referred to here: 
1. Many of the findings of science are woven into other 
school subjects. We have already seen how the work 
of the scientist is represented in geography. In the 
following chapter we shall discuss the applied sciences 
that have recently been given a place of large importance 
in elementary and high schools, — especially the indus- 
trial arts and the health studies. Some students of the 
problem believe that the study of science in the lower 
schools may well be limited to these applications. Im- 
portant as these applications are, however, it is ques- 
tionable whether this limitation of the study of science 
will insure upon the part of the great masses of the people 
a keen appreciation of the fundamental ideals of science 
or a sympathetic understanding of its essential method. 
2. Another reason why science has not achieved the 
recognition in universal education that its importance 
demands lies in the pressure that rests upon the school to 
do the things that seem on the surface to be most in need 
of doing. and to neglect things that seem to be looking 
after themselves fairly well. Natural science apparently 
belongs in the latter class. It is taking care of our health, 
our food, our transportation, our industry, and even our 
warfare with an efficiency that makes us stand aghast. 
The better it does these things, the more likely we are to 
take it ‘‘for granted,”’ — to be satisfied with the product 
without troubling ourselves to inquire into the process. 
But can the vast structure which science is building safely
-P-A-G-E-108
  
96 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
remain a mystery to the average man, —a fairy god- 
mother or an Aladdin’s lamp that will do his bidding 
swiftly and unerringly, albeit by means that pass his 
understanding? Servants of this type have in the past 
shown a clear tendency to reverse the réle, and sooner or 
later to play the master. It should be recognized, too, 
that the progress of science will itself be handicapped if 
the common mind fails to grasp in some measure its 
deeper meaning. The host of ‘‘anti” cults, from the 
anti-vaccinationist to the anti-evolutionist, are witness 
(and by no means mute witness) to the need of science 
in mass education. 
3. In the third place, there has been and there still is 
a wide difference of opinion as to the best ways in which 
to teach science in order to insure the understanding and 
appreciation that are the desired outcomes. The spirit, 
ideals, and methods of science have been very late devel- 
opments in human evolution; it took the race a long time 
to learn them; it is not to be expected that the task of 
insuring their perpetuation and further development 
through education will be easy. A good example of the 
difficulty is found in the subject that now represents the 
scientific movement in the elementary school, — namely, 
“nature study.” The proponents of nature study have 
insisted that books are tabu, and that the only way in 
which to give children an insight into the spirit and 
methods of the natural sciences is to have them study 
nature directly. But the teacher who can guide such 
study effectively is very rare — and he himself cannot 
be in any sense ignorant of what others have found out 
about nature. It is indeed doubtful whether science can
-P-A-G-E-109
  
THE LIBERAL STUDIES £9" 
ever be given the place that it deserves in universal edu- 
cation unless some means are found whereby the teacher 
may be enabled to make an intelligent use of such guides 
and helps as books supply in other fields. Direct experi- 
ences in “observing” nature will certainly be no less 
valuable if the observer has caught something of the 
difficult art of observation from those who have prac- 
ticed it most successfully. 
The great opportunity in science teaching. — The 
present situation is, indeed, a distinct challenge to the 
ambitious and resourceful teacher who is interested in 
the natural sciences and who sees clearly the value of 
inculcating in childien the spirit of scientifie inquiry. 
The problem is literally crying out to be solved. It may 
be that some scudent who is now preparing to teach will 
be the one to point the way. It is clear enough that he 
or she will have some towering obstacles to overcome; 
but therein lies the glory of conquest. If anyone can 
solve this problem or contribute notably toward its 
solution, — if anyone can give to the spirit of science a 
place in universal education that is at all commensurate 
with the réle that it is playing in modern civilization, — 
he or she will have a niche in history that will not be far 
below those occupied by the great masters of science. 
1Jt is possible than an understanding and appreciation of science may 
best be approached through a combination of ‘direct’ and ‘‘ vicarious” 
experience rather than exclusively by the former as the leaders of the nature- 
study movement have insisted. One who does not know what the scientific 
method means can scarcely do better than to follow Darwin in his fascinating 
description of the way in which he found out what earthworms do and the 
way in which they do it (see his Formation of Vegetable Mould), or to follow 
Tyndall in his crystal-clear exposition of the way in which a glacier moves 
(see his essays on Forms of Water). We venture the guess that the average 
teacher could direct such a study with an average class far more effectively 
than he or she could direct an actual study of earthworms in the garden or 
of glaciers in the Alps.

Summary: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LIBERAL STUDIES 
in Democratic EpucaTIoN 
The social need for a community of culture. — The 
materials discussed in this chapter have an important 
place in the program of education primarily because they 
widen and deepen the experience of the learner. They 
represent in a typical fashion some of the most signifi- 
cant parts of the social heritage, and their effective mas- 
tery will mean a richness and fullness of the individual’s 
life that would otherwise be unattainable. While this 
alone would amply justify the schools in making provi- 
sion for their study, they have a far deeper social func- 
tion. As we have seen, common ideas, ideals, and 
aspirations are the great binding forces that hold indi- 
viduals together in codéperative groups. The liberal 
studies that can be made common to all are the most 
dependable source of these common, vicarious experi- 
ences. The conditions of life vary widely in different 
communities and even among different individuals and 
groups in the same neighborhood. The provision of a 
common culture, — of common vicarious experiences, — 
counteracts these variations, and makes possible large 
social units. 
Common denominators of experience. — It is not too 
much to say that the chief function of education in a 
democracy is to insure this ‘“‘“community of culture.” It | 
is not that all are to think alike on every question. Far 
from this, everyone should be encouraged and stimulated 
to think for himself. But it is essential to collective 
action that all have common terms in which to do their
-P-A-G-E-111
THE LIBERAL STUDIES 99 
thinking, common standards for judgment, and some 
measure of common aspiration toward the realization of 
which united action may be directed. Just as the worth 
of gold is greatly increased because it is a common 
denominator of value, so the worth of ideas and ideals is 
greatly increased when they become common denomi- 
nators of experience among larger and larger groups of 
people. If, for example, the President of our country 
wishes to discuss with the people an important policy 
of government, the fact that he can refer to events in our 
past history or in the history of other countries with 
confidence that the people will understand him gives to 
the common knowledge of these events a very large and 
significant value. If it would serve his purpose to sum 
up in the name of a great character in literature a 
thought that he wished to convey or an ideal toward 
which he would point, there would be a decided advan- 
tage if he could know that those to whom he made his 
appeal would understand his meaning. Lacking this 
basis, his discussions would necessarily be limited in con- 
tent and scope; they would the more likely be an appeal 
to prejudice rather than an appeal to reason. 
The educational basis of an effective democracy. — 
The liberal studies, then, have a place of unique impor- 
tance in a scheme of democratic education. .. Democracy, 
according to one of its most distinguished students, Lord 
Bryce, means the control of the social group, not by any 
individual or group of individuals, but by the people as 
awhole. This is the form of social organization that our 
own country represents; it is the form of social organiza- 
tion that is now predominant throughout the civilized

world. Two fundamental principles crystallize the basic 
significance of universal education to democracy: 
1. The efficiency of a democracy is dependent upon 
the number and quality of the ideas and ideals that are 
common to all of the members of the democratic group. 
2. The level upon which a democratic society does its 
collective thinking is dependent upon the level to which 
educative forces have raised the great majority of its 
members. A high level of common culture is essential to 
collective thinking on a high plane. 
The “race between education and catastrophe.” — 
The schools of a democracy face a tremendous task in 
their efforts to solve this problem, — a task so tremen- 
dous that there are many who are quite ready to 
pronounce the effort futile. These critics point particu- 
larly to the apparently low level of native mentality 
among the great masses of the people,! and either 
openly or by an easy implication advocate a return to 
the form of social organization that restricts the control 
of human destiny to a chosen few. Others are far more 
hopeful, basing their faith in large part upon the results 
that universal education has already achieved. And there 
are still others who recognize that, whether for good or 
for evil, it is too late now to set back the clock, — no 
matter how great the handicap, it is now, as it has never 
been before, ‘‘a race between education and catastrophe.”

THE MATERIALS OF EDUCATION: C. THE 
PRACTICAL ARTS AND THE APPLIED 
SCIENCES 
The “cultural” versus the “practical.” — The liberal 
studies referred to in the preceding chapter are often 
spoken of as ‘“‘cultural” in their character, and as such 
are frequently contrasted with the so-called ‘‘ practical” 
studies. There has been a widespread conviction that 
studies of the cultural type are “‘impractical’’; that most 
of them are ornamental in their function rather than 
useful; and that they are useful chiefly in providing 
leisure-time interests. The source of this conviction is 
not far to seek. The privileges of the broader education 
until very recently were for the select few, not in any 
sense for the great masses of the people. As a conse- 
quence those who enjoyed these privileges were quite 
likely to be persons whose means made it unnecessary 
for them to toil for a living, and who themselves were’ 
inclined to look upon learning merely as an ornament. 
The phrase ‘“‘an accomplishment,” sometimes used in 
referring to an amateurish mastery of foreign languages 
or music or drawing, reflects even to-day this older 
notion that education beyond the rudiments of reading 
and writing is chiefly something ornamental, — some- 
thing that merely sets one off from the common run of 
men and women.

  104 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The confusion of culture with intellectual snobbery. — 
It is true, too, that this narrow conception of culture did 
not reflect a sympathetic attitude toward those who do 
the necessary routine work of the world. Education 
offered an escape from work of this type, and those who 
enjoyed the advantages of the broader education did not 
often stop to think that their freedom from manual toil 
was purchased by the toil of others. They were (and 
many of them still are) inclined to look upon their privi- 
leges as inherent rights. Thus the cultural types of 
education have come to be associated with the airs and 
attitude of the aristocrat; to the liberal education there 
still clings the tradition of inutility;— although as was 
pointed out in the preceding chapter, no materials of 
education have a deeper and more fundamental influence 
than do the liberal studies, and no group of studies is 
more significant to the safety of democracy and the 
progressive development of democratic institutions. 
Beneficial results of the reaction against the narrow con- 
ception of culture. — Fundamentally important as they 
are, however, it has been by no means a bad thing for 
the liberal studies to be ‘“‘under suspicion.’”’ In the first 
place, the suspicion has stimulated those who believed in 
culture to reinterpret their belief from a social point of 
view, to recognize that the ‘‘culture’’ represented by the 
liberal studies did not always liberalize, and to formulate 
their aims anew with social service rather than individual 
advantage as the chief objective. In the second place, 
the reaction against the narrow conception of culture 
brought into the schools a new group of materials, which 
not only bear directly upon the practical affairs of every-
-P-A-G-E-117
  PRACTICAL ARTS 105 
day life but also exert in themselves a liberalizing influ- 
ence which in many ways compensates for recognized 
deficiencies in the older liberal studies. We shall dis- 
cuss this new group of materials under two heads, the 
“Practical Arts” and the “Applied Sciences.”’ As in the 
two preceding chapters, we shall consider chiefly under 
these heads the materials that are most significant 
from the point of view of universal education. 
Tue PractTicaAL ARTS 
The antiquity of the practical arts. — While we have 
referred to the practical arts as relatively new school 
subjects, it does not follow that the arts themselves are 
new. On the contrary some of them are among the 
oldest parts of the social heritage. Long before articu- 
late speech had reached even a moderate degree of re- 
finement, it is altogether likely that certain other skills 
had been well mastered. Far back in the Old Stone 
Age, man learned to make fire, to cook some of his food, 
to chip flinty stones to a fairly sharp edge, and to fashion 
crude weapons. It is possible that, even in that remote 
time, he learned something about cultivating plants, 
and perhaps he had already domesticated one species 
of wild animal — the dog. Even with limited powers of 
speech, these arts could be passed on from generation to 
generation and improved little by little. 
Development of the practical arts in the Neolithic Age. 
— During the relatively long period (not less, probably, 
than 5000 years) that constituted what is now called the 
Neolithic or ‘‘New Stone” Age, still further progress 
was made in the fundamental practical arts. Long 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
before men had learned to make written records of their 
experiences, they had learned how to cultivate the soil. 
Through the long ages they had also learned how 
to breed and train animals. A very large proportion 
of the plants that we cultivate to-day and practically 
all of the animal species that are now bred for human 
food, human service, and human companionship are, 
in their cultivated or domesticated forms, far older than 
recorded history. Professor John M. Tyler has given 
us a picture of life in the latter part of the New Stone 
Age which summarizes some of the conclusions of the 
archeologists who have studied the remains of the Lake 
Dwellers in Switzerland: 
“Could we have sat on one of these village platforms of a sum- 
mer afternoon and looked out to the wheat fields on the shore, 
and seen the canoes come in with fish or game, and the cattle 
returning from the mainland pasture; could we have watched the 
men fashioning implements and all manner of woodwork, and the 
women grinding the grain or moulding pottery, or spinning and 
weaving; we should have found a great deal to please and inter- 
est us. The fruits and berries, the smell of roasting fish and baking 
bread, of cakes well flavored with the oil from beechnut or flax, 
or perhaps sifted over with the seeds of poppy or caraway, would 
have been far from disagreeable. We should have felt that it 
was a goodly land, and that life was well worth living. We should 
not have been disturbed by shrieking steamboats, puffing and 
groaning locomotives, or honking automobiles, or by telegraphs or 
telephones, by letters which must be answered or books which 
must be read. There were no stocks and bonds, bill or notes, 
strikes or lockouts. There was no labor question; all simply had 
to work. No one went to school, except to nature, and there 
were no lectures. ‘The name of that chamber was peace.’”’ 1

  PRACTICAL ARTS 107 
The early use of metals. — In the centuries that fol- 
lowed the New Stone Age and still preceded the invention 
of writing, further progress was made. Indeed, the great 
turning-point in social evolution that closed the New 
Stone Age and ushered in its successor was marked by 
the development of an art that was second in importance 
only to writing and printing in its influence upon human 
development. This was the art of refining metals. 
Copper. — When and how men learned to smelt ores 
and thus secure metals that could be used for making 
weapons and tools, no one knows. It is known, however, 
that before ores were smelted, one kind of metal had been 
discovered that could be used in its native form for cer- 
tain purposes. It is the only metal, indeed, that is found 
in large amounts in a pure form, — namely, copper. 
Probably the first chunk of native copper that primitive 
man found did not impress him very much. It was not 
so good a material for making hatchets and spear-heads 
as were the harder flints. But it had one important 
quality the value of which sooner or later came to be 
recognized; it could be pounded into various shapes and 
it could be brightly polished. Even primitive man liked 
to adorn himself; he loved beautiful things; and copper 
could be made into attractive ornaments. It was also 
used to some extent for making needles and pins, and 
more rarely for making knife-blades and axes, although 
these could never be given an edge that would hold its 
sharpness. 
Bronze and iron. — There is, however, another metal 
which, when melted with copper, forms a fairly hard 
combination or alloy. This metal is tin, and while it is
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
seldom found in nature in a pure form, some of the ores 
containing it are so rich in tin that they can be easily 
fused with copper to form bronze. Primitive man some- 
how and somewhere stumbled upon this fact, — and the 
discovery, whenever and wherever it may have occurred, 
was one of the most momentous events in human evolu- 
tion. Man had now a metal that could be hardened and 
polished and given a keen and fairly lasting edge. It is 
not so good for making edged tools as is steel, but it is 
far better than copper. But beyond this, man in making 
bronze mastered the twin arts of refining metals and of 
molding them, while still in liquid form, into a variety 
of shapes. The use of tin-bearing ores for making bronze 
suggested that other metals might be extracted from 
other ores or earths which give at first glance no hint of 
the presence of the metals. Thus the way was open for 
experimenting with earths, and in the course of time — 
long in itself, but much shorter than the period that 
constituted the New Stone Age — the Bronze Era gave 
place to the Age of Iron. 
The early household arts. — During the long centuries 
that preceded the beginning of recorded history, then, 
mankind had gradually mastered the basic elements of 
agricultural and industrial art. Nor had the so-called 
household arts lagged behind. In the Lake Dwellings, 
a competent archaeologist reports, ‘‘every house had 
its loom.’! ‘We find not only threads, cords, twine, and 
nets, but cloth of varying pattern and design. Some 
pieces were so finely woven and well preserved that their 
discoverers could hardly believe that they were not of

PRACTICAL ARTS 109 
modern make.”! There is evidence, too, confirming 
the conclusion reached from the study of still earlier 
periods that, in the practical arts of primitive man, 
beauty and utility developed together; for, we are told, 
“Fringes and embroidery occur.” 
Why the practical arts were so long neglected in for- 
mal education. — The practical arts, then, had under- 
gone a long development before writing was invented; 
they underwent another long period of development 
before they were recognized as materials of formal educa- 
tion and incorporated in the programs of the schools. It 
is not difficult to see why their educational recognition 
came so late. In the first place, many of them were so 
thoroughly interwoven with the daily lives of the people 
that children learned them almost as a matter of course 
from watching the processes, imitating them in play, 
and while still very young lending a hand to help their 
elders. This was true of the household arts, especially, 
and of the agricultural arts among farming peoples. In 
the second place, the arts that very early became special- 
ized developed an efficient system of training through 
apprenticeship which made it unnecessary for a long time 
to have these arts represented in the schools. Thus the 
mining and smelting of ores and the working of metals 
were not arts that everyone needed to practice; hence 
from the earliest antiquity these arts have constituted a 
recognized division of labor; (witness, for example, the 
wide prevalence of the trade-name, Smith, as a surname). 
In the third place, the basic school arts, reading and com- 
putation, became of practical importance to everyone 
1 TYLER, op. cit., p. 84.   
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  110 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
only when social organization had developed to a con- 
siderable complexity, and when a monopoly of these 
arts by a relatively few individuals gave to the latter an 
opportunity to exploit and oppress the masses. The first 
strong impetus toward universal education, — toward 
an effort to teach everyone to read, write, and cipher, — 
came with the democratic awakening. The prime need 
then was the intellectual enlightenment of the great 
masses of the people rather than an enhancement of their 
industrial efficiency. 
The great changes brought about by the Industrial 
Revolution. — With the development of universal educa- 
tion, however, there came a parallel (and in part a conse- 
quent) development of industry. The application of 
steam-power to the machinery of production, manufac- 
ture, and transportation led to a far more elaborate spe- 
cialization of industry than the world had ever known. 
It led also to the rapid growth of commercial and 
manufacturing centers. The profound changes in ways 
of living thus brought about are called to-day the Indus- 
trial Revolution. We are still too close to these changes 
thoroughly to appreciate their full significance; in fact, 
the Industrial Revolution is still in progress. Some of 
its implications for education, however, have already 
been clearly recognized. Among these is the need for 
incorporating in the school programs certain of the 
materials represented by the practical arts. Among 
the reasons that have justified this policy the following 
have been especially important: 
1. The specialization of industry. — Machinery quickly 
carried the specialization of industry so far that many
-P-A-G-E-123
  PRACTICAL ARTS 111 
workers came to be concerned with the production of 
only one fraction of the unit product. Where, for exam- 
ple, each shoemaker had formerly made the entire shoe 
from the start to finish, each worker in the shoe factory 
is now likely to concern himself entirely with cutting the 
leather, or stitching the pieces together, or nailing on the 
heels. Thus labor, instead of being artfully and thought- 
fully directed toward a total completed product, has 
become more and more thoroughly fractionated, routin- 
ized, and mechanized. The machine has tended to make 
the worker himself a machine, and under these conditions 
it is the verdict of human experience that labor becomes 
humdrum drudgery, thinking lags for want of a stimulus, 
the imagination atrophies, and the most satisfying re- 
ward of effort, — namely, pride in a fine product, — is 
entirely lacking. 
2. The estrangement of master and workman. — Ma- 
chinery tended to estrange master and workman. Under 
the older system of industry, the master himself was one 
of the workmen. The apprentice very frequently lived 
with the master’s family, and when the apprentice be- 
came a journeyman he was not distinguished in social 
status nor essentially in financial status from the 
master. But the factory hands work under the fore- 
men who in turn are under superintendents; the modern 
substitute for the master, — namely, proprietor of the 
the factory or the executive officer of the corporation 
that owns the factory, — does not work with the men. 
His skill is of another type; his social affiliations are 
with another group; and his financial status is widely 
different from that of the routine workers. Thus the
-P-A-G-E-124
112. AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Industrial Revolution has brought with it an accentu- 
ated class-consciousness upon the part both of the 
workers and of the employers, —a consciousness of 
class differences which has in many ways canceled or 
offset the equalizing influence of political democracy. 
3. The growth of the urban population. — In the third 
place, — and, for the purposes of this brief discussion, 
finally, — the Industrial Revolution rapidly worked 
toward a relative depopulation of the rural areas and 
the concentration of population in urban communities. 
Cities, of course, are not new things in human history; 
urban centers rivaling in size all but our very largest 
modern cities existed in ancient times; and many of the 
cities of Europe during the Middle Ages were large and 
important. Never in the past, however, have the cities 
claimed so large a proportion of the total population as 
they claim to-day. The great majority of the people in 
ancient and mediaeval times and until very recently in 
modern times lived either in small villages or in the open 
country; hence whatever unfortunate effects city life 
may have involved did not influence a large proportion 
of the people. Offsetting the complicated and artificial 
life of the cities was the simple, stable, and conservative 
life of the country, — a kind of life which had its origin 
far back in prehistoric times and the roots of which lie 
consequently very deep.t To pull them up on a large

in the latter part of the New Stone Age we find the people of the banded pot- 
tery who practiced an advanced form of agriculture. Here apparently the 
men as well as the women worked in the fields. We find their stone mattocks 
and ploughshares. Hoe-culture was giving place to ploughing. Here men 
were receiving a very different education and training from the hunters, fishermen, and herdsmen of the north, though there was also a gradual in- 
crease of tillage doubtless taking place. They were tilling the ground la-

scale means, as we are now learning, a profound read- 
justment, not only of social institutions, but of indi- 
vidual desires, prejudices, and standards. 
New problems of education arising from the Industrial 
Revolution. — It is clear, then, that the universal school, 
which was first established to teach everyone to read 
and write, and which later undertook to give to every- 
one some knowledge of geography and history and some 
acquaintance with literature, music, art, and science, 
has of late years been confronted with the task of keeping 
alive, under greatly changed conditions, the arts and 
virtues which a simpler organization of society involved, 
and which are likely to be lost to large numbers of peo- 
ple as social organization becomes more and more com- 
boriously, monotonously, doing what was wearisome and disagreeable for a 
reward sometimes large, sometimes scanty. The peasant farmer learns fore- 
thought, thrift, economy, industry, and a host of homely virtues, far less 
known to hunter or herdsman. He is no more a collector taking what he 
finds; he has gone into partnership with nature. He is studying her ways, 
moods, and whims, He amasses a steadily increasing store of most valuable 
lore concerning climate, weather, soil, plants, animals, and things. He is 
rooted in a little patch of ground. His outlook is narrow and he is slow to 
change. But he learns his lessons thoroughly. He may enter the school 
unwillingly but he stays in it. 
“He has a permanent home even if it is hardly more than a hut, which is 
the centre of his life and thought. It is a hard, healthy life, and population 
increases rapidly under such conditions. He probably has a large family of 
children, and they educate and socialize him and one another. He is trained 
and moulded by ‘home surroundings.’ Is not this the history of the fron- 
tiersman or homesteader everywhere at all times? The home and family 
stienments and instincts are deeply rooted because very ancient and entirely 
natural. 
“ He lives in a village or neighborhood, which is hardly more than a great. 
patriarchal family, closely united by intermarriage, and by the pressure of 
common work to satisfy common needs, common ownership of the soil, 
mutual aid in hard times.... We easily forget the civilizing, refining, and 
improving unremitting pressure and power of these simple, uninteresting 
peasant influences. He is learning to get on with the members of his family 
and neighborhood. He is experimenting upon his neighbors; his experiments 
and experiences may often be very trying to himself and them; the results 
may sometimes be disastrous. But he is not only practicing the essentials 
and fundamentals of morality very incompletely and without code; but a 
sort of preparatory course in government. It may easily be self- -government 
in these small villages. The town-meeting originated here or somewhat 
farther north.”
-P-A-G-E-126
114 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
plex. The loss of the arts themselves might not con- 
stitute a serious problem; but the loss of the virtues 
would be disastrous. | 
The school has taken over many functions of the home. — 
The school has attempted to solve this problem in 
several ways. Recognizing the fact that the typical 
home no longer provides opportunities for children to 
become acquainted with such fundamental practical arts 
as those involved in agriculture, the handicrafts, and 
even home-making itself, the modern school has devel- 
oped school gardens, school shops, and school courses in 
the household arts. | 
The practical arts as complements of the basic school 
arts and the liberal studies.—In the development of 
these phases of school work, it has been found both 
expedient and valuable to relate these practical arts to 
the older school subjects. The “making” of things 
affords innumerable opportunities for measuring and 
weighing. It thus not only leads to the application of 
what has been learned in the arithmetic classes but also 
shows clearly to the pupil the need for arithmetical skills 
and hence tends to stimulate or ‘motivate’ further 
study. The materials that the practical arts involve, — 
woods, metals, foods, and textiles, — suggest interesting 
questions as to their sources and the means by which 
they are obtained, transported, and changed from their 
raw form to the form in which they are utilized in the 
arts; hence geography finds a wide field of application, 
and the study of geography takes on a new and richer 
meaning. Planning for constructive work puts a pre- 
mium on thoughtful discussion and this in turn stimu-

lates clear expression; thus the study of language may 
receive a powerful impetus from the work in the practical 
arts. Finally, the processes which comprise these arts, 
as we have already suggested, have had a long and 
honorable history, to learn something of which is to take 
the first step toward an appreciation of what civilization 
means.! 
The practical arts as related to the applied sciences. 
—In making a place for the practical arts in its pro- 
gram, however, the modern school has done more than 
merely to furnish a substitute for the training that the 
home and the ordinary occupations of life provided 
in the less complicated social organization of the past. 
In addition to this it has been a means whereby advances 
in science may be understood and appreciated by large 
numbers of those who will apply them to the practical 
arts. We have already called attention to the fact that 
many of these arts had their origin in prehistoric times, 
and that some have even persisted with very little 
change through all the centuries covered by recorded 
history. As long as these arts were transmitted from 
generation to generation largely through imitation, their 
improvement was a very slow process. Transmission 
of this type tends to be severely conservative; it stub- 
bornly resists change. Each generation not only prac- 
tices what the preceding generation has taught it to 
practice, but also feels that there is a certain sacredness 
about the procedure. ‘‘What was good enough for our

around the interests and activities involved in the practical arts. Dr. Bonser

in 1910 a member of the staff of Teachers College, Columbia University.

  116 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
fathers and grandfathers should be good enough for us,” 
is a quite natural expression of this conservative attitude. 
This is good in so far as it insures the perpetuation of 
those things that are valuable; it is not so good when it 
blinds people to the wastefulness or inefficiency of the 
older methods. To make the industrial arts a subject 
of school study is one way of breaking through the crust 
of tradition and of insuring changes that are in the direc- 
tion of progress. This has been particularly noticeable 
in the work in home-making that is now provided in the 
upper grades of the elementary school and in the high | 
school, and in the work in agriculture offered in the 
high schools that serve farming communities.‘ 
Vocational enlightenment and guidance. — In organ- 
izing courses in the practical arts, the modern school 
has also discovered a means of guiding boys and girls 
toward the occupations for which they are best adapted. 
Under the older conditions, family tradition was nat- 
urally the most important factor in determining the 
occupations followed by the children; the son tended to 
take up the occupation of his father. If this occupation 
was overcrowded and if, in consequence, the son had 
to look elsewhere, the field of choice was usually re- 
stricted to the occupations of the immediate neighbor- 
hood, — farming, fishing, mining, weaving, or what not. 
1The development came first, of course, in the professional and technical 
schools. As long as physicians were trained by the apprenticeship system, 
the progress of medicine was slow and halting. With the organization of 
medical schools, a premium was placed upon the application of science to the 
art of healing. Learning by imitation gave place to learning through the 
mastery of principles. The development of engineering schools gave a similar impetus to the growth of engineering as a science, and this led in turn to 
rapid improvements in the practice or art of engineering. Agriculture is one 
of the latest of the occupations thus to “institutionalize” the training of its 
recruits, and again the result has been to change agriculture from an empirical 
“rule-of-thumb” art to an applied science.
-P-A-G-E-129
PRACTICAL ARTS 117 
The business and professional opportunities with which 
the young person was likely to be familiar were also 
limited to those in evidence about him. If he lived ina 
town or city, the example of the merchant or the lawyer 
might impress him with the possibilities represented by 
these callings; if he lived in the open country or the small 
village, he knew at least the doctor, the clergyman, and 
the small shopkeeper. 
The need of vocational guidance. — Prior to the Indus- 
trial Revolution, these limitations in the choice of occu- 
pation were far less significant than they are to-day. 
At best the range of choice was relatively narrow, — 
although even then the city boy had a great advantage 
over the country boy. At the present time, however, 
the division of labor has been carried so far that occu- 
pational opportunities are almost innumerable, — and 
yet the occupations coming within the ken of any one 
individual are likely to be only a small fraction of the 
total number. These specialized occupations also tend 
to be localized. A farming community, for example, is 
likely to limit itself largely to dairy farming or grain 
farming or cotton farming. A manufacturing commu- 
nity specializes in cotton goods, felt goods, silks; in fire- 
arms, cutlery, typewriters; in glass, pottery, earthen- 
ware; in locomotives, cannon, structural steel; in leather 
products, dressed meats, prepared foods. Within these 
industries technical and professional workers are em- 
ployed in addition to skilled artisans and machine 
operatives. The typical worker in a mammoth factory 
may have but a slight notion of the wide range of varied 
activities that the factory represents.
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The practical arts as an agency of vocational guidance. 
— There has come about, then, a distinct need for a 
new subject of study in the schools, — the study of occu- 
pations for the purpose of helping young people to make 
an intelligent choice of a life work. This process of 
“vocational enlightenment” has not yet progressed very 
far, but one of the most promising beginnings has been 
made through the courses already established in the 
practical arts. In these courses boys and girls are made 
acquainted with the kind of work that the basic occu- 
pations demand. Some schools, indeed, provide a 
“battery” of such courses, organized with distinct ref- 
erence to the guidance function. The pupils pass, during 
one or two years, from one of the school shops to another, 
spending from four to nine weeks in each, and gaining 
thereby a first-hand touch with woodworking, metal- 
working, plumbing, the electrical trades, printing, paint- 
ing and decorating, machine-shop practice, automobile 
repairing, and the like. Those who find in this experi- 
ence some field of work for which they seem to be par- 
ticularly adapted are then permitted in the remaining 
years of the school course to specialize in this field. At 
the same time those who go into other types of work will 
have gained through this process a sufficient acquaint- 
ance with the practical arts to appreciate the significance 
of these arts and to respect those who follow them. 
The liberalizing influence of the practical arts. —This 
need of appreciating the work that others do is, indeed, 
a most important justification of teaching the practical 
arts in the universal school. Experience, as we have 
seen (Chapter II), may be either personal or vicarious.
-P-A-G-E-131
  PRACTICAL ARTS 119 
One may share in the life and activities of mankind by 
actual participation or by imaginative participation; but 
the latter to be effective must rest upon an interpretive 
basis of actual, personal experience. School training in 
the practical arts, limited though it necessarily is both in 
scope and in time, may do much to provide this inter- 
pretive basis, and upon this basis may be built a clear 
understanding and a keen appreciation of what the goods 
of life have cost in terms of human ingenuity and human 
effort. 
A new conception of culture demanded by democ- 
racy. — We have already pointed out the long associa- 
tion of “culture” with leisure and freedom from toil, 
the consequent identification of the cultural with the 
merely ornamental, and the disposition of the broadly 
educated person to feel that he is superior to the common 
run of workaday men and women. This conception of 
culture is far too narrow to meet the needs of a demo- 
cratic social order. And it is unnecessarily narrow. It 
is not in literature and art alone that the hopes, aspira- 
tions, and achievements of mankind have been caught 
and crystallized. A new machine, a device for reducing 
human drudgery, an improved tool or utensil that makes 
the day’s work less wearisome and more productive, a 
new strain of live stock or an improved variety of fruit 
or grain perfected by long continued selection and breed- 
ing, — each of these is as truly a part of the social her- 
itage as are the great poems and the great pictures. 
Cultural possibilities in the common things of life. — 
The truly cultured person may be thought of as one who 
sees through to these deeper meanings of the common
-P-A-G-E-132
  ' 
120 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
things of life, and who because of this appreciates the 
more keenly the value of his heritage. He knows what 
these things have cost. He has a deeper respect for 
those who produce them, and perhaps even the stimulus 
to do his share of the world’s necessary toil. If he is 
himself engaged in their production, he has a keener re- 
spect for his materials, a finer appreciation of the worth 
of his labor, and perhaps the stimulus to put into his 
work the creative element that may lift; what would 
otherwise be routine drudgery to the plane of a fine art. 
The civic and pelitical importance of this broader con- 
eeption of culture. — We have referred frequently to the 
basic need of a community of culture as the prime con- 
dition of the collective thinking and the united action 
that democracy involves. The broader type of culture 
which includes an appreciation of the common things 
of life and a deep and abiding respect for the efforts of 
those who produce them has an important function to 
discharge in this connection. Democratic institutions 
are threatened to-day not so much by the dangers of 
aggression from without as by the perils of dissension 
within. The Industrial Revolution ‘has divided the 
people into occupational groups, the interests of which 
frequently conflict. The groups distrust one another, 
question one another’s motives. In our own country 
capital and labor are held apart by a sullen hostility; 
suspicion and envy array the farming classes against the 
commercial and industrial classes; producer, distributor, 
middleman, and consumer are at four-cornered logger- 
heads. All this represents in part the continued mal- 
adjustment of those processes of social transformation
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE APPLIED SCIENCES 121 
that began with the invention of the steam-engine, and 
the end of which is not yet in sight. The school cannot 
itself resolve these antagonisms,— but the school can 
lay the basis for the forces that will resolve them if 
anything can accomplish this end. In so far as dis- 
sensions among occupational groups are due to a lack of 
appreciation upon the part of each for the services that 
the others render, the recognition of the practical arts 
in the school program may well exert a powerful cor- 
rective influence. 
Specialized vocational efficiency not an objective of 
elementary education. — Specific training for bread- 
winning occupations is not accepted in this country as a 
proper function of the elementary school. There is a 
general conviction that the earlier years of school life 
should be devoted to general education, the main features 
of which are common to all, rather than to specialized 
forms of vocational training. The practical arts in the 
elementary school, then, should be distinguished sharply 
from the specific vocational courses and curricula that 
the high schools are coming more and more generally to 
provide. 
Tue AppLieD SCIENCES 
Types of applied science. —It has already been 
pointed out that the applications of science have worked 
marvelous improvements in the practical arts, and that 
one of the benefits following from the recognition of the 
practical arts in education has been the wide and speedy 
dissemination of these improvements. ‘The scientific 
study of navigation, agriculture, forestry, the mechanical
-P-A-G-E-134
  
  122 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
arts, and the household arts has yielded a multitude of 
dependable facts and principles which explain and justify 
certain empirical practices that have evolved gradually 
in the history of the race, and which also reveal clearly 
the waste involved in certain other empirical practices 
and suggest better methods of doing the world’s work. 
Most of these applications of science have their princi- 
pal bearing upon education in connection with specialized 
vocational curricula in the high schools and colleges. 
Some acquaintance with them, however, should be gained 
in the elementary school, and as we have already seen 
(Chapters IV and V) certain phases of geography and 
arithmetic are important from this point of view. 
Modern geography, for example, teaches some of the 
fundamental principles that govern climate and which 
thus have important applications to agriculture and 
navigation; in its description of industry geography sets 
forth the basic industrial processes that underlie mining 
and manufacturing and which have been so profoundly 
affected by the work of the scientist; in emphasizing the 
problems of conservation, it makes numerous references 
to the developments of modern science in the fields of 
agriculture and forestry. Arithmetic is seeking in in- 
creasing measure to set forth the applications of its 
principles to problems of everyday life, and while these 
applications refer chiefly to commercial processes, the 
fields of agriculture and industry are coming to be 
included. 
Health education. — There is, however, one group of 
school subjects which exemplify in a striking fashion the 
important influence of applied science in modern life.  
-P-A-G-E-135
  
THE APPLIED SCIENCES 128 
   
                                                          These are the subjects that are grouped under the general 
term, ‘‘Health Education.” 
Many of the practical arts, as we have noted, are the 
oldest of all of the products of race-experience. This is 
not true in the same measure of the health studies and 
exercises. Among the nations of antiquity, one and, so 
far as the records inform us, only one, made the cultiva- 
tion of health and bodily vigor an outstanding virtue. 
This nation was Greece; but while the modern interest 
in health education has been deeply influenced by the 
Greek ideals of physical beauty and grace, the strength 
of this interest and the growing demand for health educa- 
tion in the schools represent a thoroughly modern, — 
indeed, a very recent, — development. 
The growth of knowledge concerning health. — The 
recognition and development of health education as an 
important part of the school program have resulted in 
large measure from the very great advances that have 
been made in the knowledge of health and disease. It 
should not be inferred that these advances came sud- 
denly; on the contrary, they have back of them a long 
series of patient and laborious investigations. It is the 
recent culmination of these investigations in principles 
which give us a relatively clear understanding of the laws 
of health that has been sharp and ‘‘sudden.” We now 
know that most diseases are caused by microscopic 
organisms, belonging chiefly to the plant-group, Bacteria, 
which gain access to the body and there set up fermenta- 
tions. This discovery, however, was not made overnight. 
Before Bacteria could be known, the microscope had to 
be devised and improved, —and men worked with
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
single lenses for two hundred years before the combina- 
tion of two lenses, which is the basic structure in both 
the telescope and the microscope, was hit upon. After 
the invention of the microscope nearly two hundred years 
elapsed before the existence of Bacteria was clearly dem- 
onstrated and their relation to disease clearly proved. 
Even then, further investigations of a most laborious 
character were needed to identify the specific kinds of 
Bacteria and other microérganisms associated with dif- 
ferent diseases, and to provide means of combating or 
controlling each kind. It is the marvelous success of 
these latest investigations that has impressed mankind 
as a sharp and sudden advance. 
The relation of this knowledge to health habits. — It is 
not only or chiefly this new knowledge of the laws of 
health that forms the materials of health education in 
the schools. That everyone should understand these 
laws is obvious, and fortunately the most important of 
them can be made clear through simple description and 
illustration even to fairly young children; but of far 
greater moment is the development of the habits and 
ideals of living that will be consistent with the laws. 
The outstanding practical lesson that has come from the 
discovery of Bacteria and their relation to health is the 
lesson of cleanliness. Next in importance perhaps are 
the practical corollaries that follow from the fact that a 
healthy, vigorous body may successfully resist invasion 
by these disease-breeding parasites. Certainly not least 
in importance are the relationships which fresh air, 
sunlight, nutritious food, wholesome play, regular habits, 
sufficient sleep, and temperance in all things bear to the
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE APPLIED SCIENCES 125 
maintenance of bodily vigor. Finally, there is the sig- 
nificant fact of social responsibility in matters of health, 
—the danger of spreading disease, now made increas- 
ingly perilous by the gathering of large segments of the 
population in crowded cities. These are the larger 
problems with which health education as a definite part 
of the school program is concerning itself. 
The place of play in the health program. — Especially 
significant to the réle that the school must play in health 
education is the close relationship that has been dis- 
covered between wholesome play and good health. The 
playground and the gymnasium are to-day as important 
features of the school’s equipment as are the classrooms 
and the laboratories. The social element and the zest 
of competition are probably necessary if physical exercise 
is to exert its most beneficial influences. As Joseph Lee 
has said, ‘‘From the adult standpoint, play is re-creation; 
from the child’s standpoint, play is creation.” 
The life of the school as part of its curriculum. — 
What has just been said illustrates a principle that has 
rapidly gained recognition during the past two decades. 
It is not alone in books that the educational materials 
which we have been discussing are crystallized. The 
school itself is a product of civilization; it is in an out- 
standing fashion the type and symbol of the social 
heritage. The life that the school represents can be 
made to reflect in a very effective way some of the 
most precious elements of this heritage. The regimen of 
the school is in miniature the great lesson of law and 
order and system that it took the race milleniums of 
bitter experience to learn. In so far as the school life 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
126 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
clearly embodies and expresses equality of opportunity, 
justice, sympathy, kindliness, codperation, and truth, 
it is doing much not only to keep these ideals alive and 
vigorous in each succeeding generation, but to insure their 
growth and their extension. 
Questions, EXERCISES, AND PROBLEMS 
1. What constitutes culture? Should all people be cultured? 
What truth, if any, is there in the statement, “It takes nine gener- 
ations to make a gentleman”? Are we using “culture” in the 
sense in which it is generally employed in ordinary conversation? 
2. The three basic needs of life are often said to be “food, cloth- 
ing, and shelter.’ How would each be provided were there no 
tools or machines? 
3. Soap was formerly made in almost every household. How 
was it made? How is soap made now? Of what value is it to one 
who will never make soap to know how soap was formerly made or 
to know how soap is now made? 
4, Trace the genesis of lighting houses and streets; of private 
and public water supplies; of weaving cloth; of baking bread. 
5. Which of the basic practical arts have you had an oppor- 
tunity to learn by first-hand experience? What, if any, would be 
the value of this experience, if we assume that you never practice 
the art in later life? 
6. It has been said that “Modern industry tends to make of 
each man a mere shred of humanity.”’? What does this mean? What 
are the evils involved in this condition? In what ways, if any, can 
education work to counteract these evils? 
7. Why do farmers so often wish to “move to town”? Show 
how, in your judgment, each of these causes may be counterbalanced. 
8. Why are practical farmers generally opposed to what they 
call “book farming’? What led a President of the United States 
to say that he had appointed ‘‘a real dirt farmer” to be Secretary 
of Agriculture? 
9. “Misfit” is a term applied to persons who do not seem to 
succeed in the occupation in which they are engaged. Who is to 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE APPLIED SCIENCES 127 
blame for these “misfits”? How can the school help to reduce the 
number of misfits? 
10. “As civilization develops, the period of elementary education 
is necessarily lengthened.” Explain the reasons for the preceding 
statement. 
11. “Soap making was once a practical, empirical, rule-of-thumb 
art; now it is a science.” Make other similar statements. Whence 
comes science? What is the service of science? Why is there such 
a decided movement toward a science of health just now? 
(Note. — By this time, the students who are studying this book 
should have observed classes of children at work in schoolrooms 
and groups of children on the playground. The preceding chapters 
should be re-studied critically in the light of these observations.)

MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 
The problem of the chapter. — The three preceding 
chapters have dealt with the materials of education as 
these are crystallized in the subjects of study found in the 
schools. It has been pointed out that these materials 
represent the important results of the experience of the 
race and that a basic problem of education is to insure 
that the most significant results of race-experience shall 
become an integral part of the experience of each suc- 
ceeding generation, — that they shall be woven into the 
experience of as many individual members of each 
generation as possible. 
’ While this is a basic task of education, it does not tell 
the whole story. The reader will recall the distinction 
that was drawn in Chapter II between education as 
growth and education as vicarious experience. It is the 
latter point of view that was emphasized in Chapters 
II, IV, and V. It will be well now to return to the point 
of view represented by the conception of education as 
growth. We have this important question to ask and 
answer: In what ways will the mastery of these materials 
of education promote the growth or development of 
mind? 
What is “mind”? — And first of all, we must make 
sure that our use of the term “mind”’ is clearly under- 
stood. This is another of those big, comprehensive 
128  
-P-A-G-E-141
  MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 129 
terms that are difficult to define in a satisfactory way. 
Here as elsewhere, a simple definition is almost certain 
to omit important elements that keep popping up to 
confuse us once we have accepted the definition. It is 
well, then, to work into the conception slowly and care- 
fully, ever ‘‘mindful”’ of the fact that we are dealing with 
a very important term upon the precise meaning of which 
the keenest thinkers have been far from an agreement. 
Mind as consciousness. — The notion of mind that has 
been most generally accepted is that which identifies 
mental life with consciousness. This identification at 
least gives us a starting point, for we all know some of 
the important differences between consciousness and 
unconsciousness, — between a conscious life and an 
unconscious existence. We know that we lose conscious- 
ness when we sink into a. sound sleep, and that we 
recover consciousness when we become ‘‘wide awake.” 
We know, also, that there are degrees of consciousness 
between these two extremes, — that sometimes we are 
“barely conscious” and sometimes we are ‘‘fully con- 
scious.” If this definition be accepted, it is clear that 
when one loses consciousness completely, one has in a 
very real sense lost one’s mind. 
Mind as a mirror of past experiences. — We can with 
some profit to our thinking carry this conception of mind 
a little further. When you awaken gradually from a 
sound sleep you become gradually ‘‘conscious”’ of your 
surroundings as these are ‘‘reported”’ by the sense- 
organs. Often this is a very fantastic consciousness 
which misinterprets the stimuli that the sensory nerves 
are sending inward, and this fantastic experience with its
-P-A-G-E-142
    130 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
grotesque misinterpretations we call a dream.' Often, 
however, you know that you are not dreaming, and yet 
you are uncertain and confused; you scarcely know 
where you are or even what or who you are. The sense- 
impressions are not misinterpreted as in a dream, but 
their meaning is obscure. Perhaps by what seems at 
the time an almost superhuman effort, you are able to 
“rouse” yourself, — to “‘snap”’ yourself into full con- 
sciousness. You know where you are. You recognize 
the different things that you see, — you know what they 
mean. Beyond this you know that you are you; the stage - 
of consciousness of self has been reached. 
Now this experience, which is familiar to all of us, 
may give us a suggestion of what consciousness or mind 
is in its most primitive form, and of what it comes to be 
in its later development. Whether all varieties of life 
have the attribute of consciousness is a disputed question, 
but its possession by, and its value to, the higher forms 
of animal life cannot be questioned. The higher animals 
learn; that is, they modify their behavior in the light 
of their past experience, and to bring past experience to 
bear upon behavior is an incontestable function of mind or 
consciousness. One might go farther and say with a large 
measure of truth that mind is light of past experience 
brought to bear upon present conduct. This is obvious 
enough when you definitely remember past events and 
relate them to present problems. It is less obvious but 
no less true when there is no explicit recall of past events. 
When on waking from a sound sleep you “‘recognize”’ 
1It is generally believed that dreams come only in light sleep, — that 
dream-life is a semi-conscious life so to speak.
-P-A-G-E-143
  MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 131 
the objects about you, you are interpreting your sense- 
impressions in the light of your experience. It may be 
only a fleeting “feeling of familiarity,” but trifling and 
unimportant as it may seem, this feeling of familiarity is 
the root and basis of mental life. William James, in 
one of his famous epigrams, puts it in this way: “A polyp 
would be a conceptual thinker if a feeling of ‘Hollo! 
Thingumbob again!’ ever flitted through its mind. This 
sense of sameness is the very keel and backbone of our 
consciousness.” 
Mind not only reflects the past; it also projects the 
future. — It is obvious that the usefulness of mind or 
consciousness would be restricted within narrow limits 
if all that it did were merely to reflect the past. Asa 
matter of fact, in doing this it actually accomplishes 
much more. It anticipates what is coming, and this is an 
achievement that no mechanical device — not even a 
living automaton — could possibly parallel. “If... 
a hungry person sees a tempting morsel, his mouth 
waters, and his jaw tends to move at the same time that 
his hand goes out toward the food. The various reac- 
tions are set off simultaneously ... as though the 
nervous system were rehearsing beforehand all the steps 
in the act of eating. The object is, so to speak, being 
grasped and eaten before it is touched.’ If it is true, 
then, that mind reflects the past, it is no less true that it 
projects the future. Each moment of waking con- 
sciousness points ahead, — anticipates what is coming

if only for the next succeeding instant of time. In the 
sense that it is always pointing toward something new, 
mind is creative as well as reproductive. Mental life — 
conscious life — is a continually changing life. When it 
ceases to change, the mental element tends to drop out, 
and behavior becomes mechanical. Conscious behavior, 
as Professor Bode says, is ‘‘essentially experimental, 
forward-looking, controlled by the future.” + 
What is mental development? — Still holding fast to 
these three notions of mind (a. that mind may be iden- 
tified with consciousness, b. that it reflects the past, and 
c. that it projects the future), let us try to understand 
what is comprised under the term “mental develop- 
ment.”’ There is manifestly a sharp contrast between 
the primitive and advanced forms of mental activity. 
Let us agree that the polyp, just barely competent to the 
discovery, ‘‘Hollo! Thingumbob again!’’ would have | 
the glimmer of a mind. Something out of past experi- 
ence has reappeared in a feeling of familiarity. Some- 
thing in the immediate future has been foreshadowed, 
anticipated, projected. Just a tiny spark of that thing 
called intelligence has flashed out of the void. It is only 
a beginning, and probably for the polyp it would be also 
an ending, for it is altogether likely that the first animal 
forms to get as far as this made little further progress. 
There would be no clear image of the original experience 
—no distinct recollection of the first. meeting with 
“Thingumbob.”’ There would be no deliberate judg- 
ment to the effect that ‘‘I reacted so-and-so to Thingum- 
bob the other day with a satisfactory result and shall

MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 133 
therefore proceed to act in a similar way to-day, antici- 
pating an equally satisfactory result.” These diverse 
elements which a higher type of mind can detect in the 
total experience are unknown to the primitive mind. 
There is, we may safely assume, just a ‘feeling of 
awareness” fused with a glow that represents the 
satisfactory character of the earlier experience (or a 
shudder that reflects its painful character); and then 
an appropriate movement, at basis quite mechanical, 
but modified in some measure, — ‘‘conditioned” in 
some measure, — by this vague and fleeting conscious- 
ness. 
A long road has been traversed from this first glimmer 
of mind to the searchlight beams with which an Einstein 
pierces the mysteries of interstellar space or a Millikan 
lays bare the secrets of electrons; but the essential char- 
acter of mind and its unique function have not changed. 
Mind still builds upon the past and projects the future, 
and by so doing controls or directs conduct. But the 
past that is reflected by the highly evolved and highly 
trained human mind of to-day is not limited to the cir- 
cumscribed personal experiences of the individual, nor 
yet to the experiences of his immediate fellows; as we 
have seen, it may comprise the outstanding and epochal 
experiences through which the race has passed. Fur- 
thermore, the future that such a mind projects is not 
limited to the next succeeding pulse-beat nor to the 
brief span during which the pangs of hunger or thirst 
or some other instinctive desire may remain unappeased. 
It may encompass days, weeks, and seasons through 
which effort is directed toward a remote goal; it may

  134 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
plan for years ahead, for a lifetime of organized and 
directed work; it may even leap forward unerringly 
through long centuries, as when the astronomer predicts 
to the fraction of a second the time of the sun’s eclipse 
ten thousand years hence. Nor is it individual conduct 
alone that is controlled and directed; for minds may 
think together and men may act together, and vast en- 
terprises involving millions of men and extending over 
generations may be conceived and executed through 
cooperative thinking and collective action. 
When we speak of mental development we refer to the 
gradual growth of mind from its faint beginnings to its 
vastly more complex and highly organized forms; from 
the fragments of crude experience which it first reflects 
to the wide range of tested, refined, and organized 
knowledge which may later form its substantial back- 
ground; and from its feeble ability to pierce a little way 
into the future to its far-reaching power of setting up 
distant goals and of holding conduct to the achievement 
of these goals. The changes that this growth involves 
constitute the field of two related branches of the science 
of psychology, — (1) ‘‘genetic” psychology which deals 
with the growth of mind in the individual, and (2) 
“comparative” psychology which studies the behavior 
of lower animals as compared with that of higher ani- 
mals and the behavior of primitive man as compared 
with that of civilized man, and through these compari- 
sons attempts to learn how mind has developed in the 
race. In this book, it will not be possible to set forth in 
detail the conclusions that the students of genetic and 
comparative psychology have reached, but some of the
-P-A-G-E-147
MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 135 
more important facts and hypotheses relating to mental 
development, and especially those that bear upon the 
problems of teaching and learning, will be referred to in 
this and the three following chapters. 
Nature versus nurture in mental development. — As 
was pointed out in Chapter II, the growth of mind de- 
pends in part upon innate forces, and may be looked 
upon from this point of view as an unfoldment of natural 
tendencies that are present in an undeveloped form 
from the very outset of the individual’s life. If by some 
miracle a newly born babe were separated at birth from 
all other human beings, and if means were devised 
whereby he could pass through the years of childhood 
and youth to maturity with no contact whatsoever with 
his kind, it is likely that there would still be a mental 
development of some sort. His nervous system would 
respond to the stimuli of his environment. Assuming 
that food and protection could in some way be provided 
in the earlier years, the experiences associated with the 
satisfaction of hunger and other bodily needs would give 
his mind a start on the road of growth. Some things no 
doubt he would learn for himself through either the 
fortunate or the unfortunate results of random move- 
ment or haphazard trial. How far he would get under 
such conditions can be only a matter of conjecture, but 
if we let our imaginations work a little on the problem 
we may perhaps gain some notion of the limited develop- 
ment that a purely “natural” education would bring 
about. The important point to emphasize, however, is 
this: that a certain part of mental development is due 
to the unfoldment of native capacities. The nervous
-P-A-G-E-148
136 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
system, which is the physical basis of mental life, grows 
- and develops just as other bodily organs grow, and 
develop. 
Two important corollaries ‘follow from this fact. In 
the first place, if we know some of the laws governing 
this natural growth or unfoldment, we may be the better 
able to take advantage of these natural tendencies in the 
processes of teaching and learning. These possibilities 
will be discussed in the next chapter under the title, 
“Nature’s Provisions for Learning.” In the second 
place, if mental growth is conditioned by the natural 
growth of the nervous system, it is clear that nature may 
impose some rather definite limits on mental develop- 
ment. We know that mental development in the ani- 
mals below the level of man is very narrowly limited. 
We shall also find that among human beings there are 
wide differences in the capacity for mental development. 
Not everyone by any means can acquire the rich back- 
ground of knowledge or attain to the keen, penetrating 
vision of an Einstein or a Millikan; — not everyone, 
indeed, can even follow the trails that these men have 
blazed. /Nature, then, not only helps us in the process 
of learning, but in a very real sense nature sets for each 
of us certain limits which, try as we may, we cannot 
transcend. ) These limitations of mental development 
will be thé theme of Chapter VIII, “ Adapting Materials 
to Individual Capacities.” In the remainder of the 
present chapter we shall discuss briefly some of the 
forces which may be thought of as operating to promote 
mental development with the help of natural tendencies 
and within the limits set by nature.
-P-A-G-E-149
  MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 137 
The powerful influence of social pressures. — Granted 
an adequate basis in the nervous equipment of the 
individual, far and away the most powerful factor in the 
development of mind is a social organization which 
places its heaviest sanctions upon intelligence and men- 
tal alertness and imposes its heaviest penalties upon 
ignorance and mental sloth. Upon the degree in which 
the social organization exerts this influence depends in 
very large measure the mental development of the 
individuals that make up the social organization. Other 
things equal, the families that cherish most steadfastly 
the ideals of education and reflect in the home the most 
effective sanctions for mental effort are the families that 
produce the keenest and cleverest minds. Other things 
equal, the communities and states that provide most 
j liberally for the education of their children are the com- 
munities and states that lead all others in prosperity 
‘and progress. Other things equal, the nations that in 
the past two or three generations laid the heaviest 
emphasis upon mass-education have to-day the highest 
rank on the scale of civilization. How far mental devel- 
pment will proceed toward the limits that nature has 
fixed will depend in almost every case upon the stimula- 
tion that the social environment provides. 
“Stretching the mind.” — What has just been said 
uggests at once that mind grows through effort, and 
that social pressures provide the most powerful stimulus 
to the necessary effort. There is probably a large meas- 
ure of truth in this inference. It is something more than 
a figure of speech to say that mind grows through the 
“stretches” that it makes. The reader will recall the   
         
      
      
    
   
-P-A-G-E-150
    138 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
emphasis laid in earlier chapters upon the need of self- 
activity in the learner, — upon the fact that it is the 
learner himself who must do the learning if anything of 
value is to be accomplished. Almost without exception, 
those who look back over their school days and evaluate 
their teachers give the first honors to the teachers who 
inspired them to the greatest effort. The ‘‘easy” 
teacher may be popular for the time being, but the 
teacher who combines sympathy with rigor gets the 
credit in the end. The conviction that one has grown 
mentally is strongest when one has reached out per- 
sistently to grasp a difficult conception, and has finally 
succeeded. One then feels that one’s ‘‘grasp’’ has been 
enlarged and strengthened. In so far as that particular 
conception is concerned, this conviction that one has 
really ‘grown’ has an unquestioned validity, although 
how far this increased strength will help in grasping 
other difficult conceptions is a matter upon which there 
is still a wide divergence of opinion. 
Imitation as a means of mental development. — The 
two preceding paragraphs have not only emphasized the 
importance of social pressures in stimulating mental 
growth; they also suggest that mental growth comes in 
part at least from following the lead that others have 
taken, from striving to learn the lessons that others have 
learned, —in short, from a process that may well be 
called ‘‘imitation.” Viewed in a large-way, a preponder- 
ant part of mental growth not only does come from this 
process but must of necessity come in this way. In how 
1This is one of the questions involved in the age-old controversy over 
“formal discipline,’ — a topic which will be referred to only indirectly in this 
book, but which the student will meet frequently in his subsequent studies.
-P-A-G-E-151
  MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 139 
far the tendency to copy the pattern that our fellows (and 
particularly our elders) have set is instinctive or innate, 
and in how far it is an acquired trait, are questions that. 
must be left for the following chapter; but there can be 
no reasonable doubt that mental growth in man not only 
gets its initial direction in this way but also depends 
throughout its course in a larger measure than most 
people perhaps would like to admit upon following the 
paths that others have made. 
How imitation may serve to get learning started is illustrated 
by the following example. M as a baby was daily taken by her 
mother to the front door (which had a glass panel) as her father 
left the house. As the father reached the sidewalk he invariably 
turned to wave a good-bye, to which the mother as invariably re- 
sponded. For some weeks M paid no attention to these performances. 
Finally the mother took M’s hand and waved it in response to the 
father’s waving. This was continued for several days until quite 
without direction M took up the movement of her own accord. | It 
is not at all probable that there was either choice or purpose in this 
action. It is likely that the visual impression produced by the re- 
treating figure of the father simply became associated with the move- 
ment of waving the hand. A bond was established that sooner or 
later became associated with the natural affection of the child for 
the parent. It was a little step toward building in the child’s mind 
an idea of the father and of what he meant in the life of the family. 
The appearance of imitation in a child is, therefore, 
an important event in his mental development, for it is 
very largely through imitation that he takes on the 
qualities that are distinctively human. The child, by 
doing what adults do, develops into the human pattern. 
This development is limited by the copy, by the human 
environment. For the young child, this human environ- 
ment is the home. The home environment is gradually  
-P-A-G-E-152
    140 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
broadened by contacts with relatives neighbors. 
Certain aspects of this widening environment affect the 
child and certain other aspects do not affect him. In 
general, however, the developing child under five years 
of age follows closely in his interests the generic interests 
of those who constitute his companions. Not without 
some measure of justification is the popular belief that 
the influences operating upon the child during these early 
years are formative in the highest degree. 
With the advent of school life, new copies are set, and 
just as faithfully the child responds to them in the way 
of imitation. The pupils, the teacher, and the school 
studies begin to exert their influence — almost always in 
the order named as far as the intensity of the influence 
is concerned. Sometimes these factors work against 
each other, as when an unsympathetic teacher causes a 
negative reaction on the part of the child which may be 
readily transferred to the school subjects; or as when the 
“fashion” in the pupil-group is antagonistic to the 
teacher or to the studies. But the influence of imitation, 
be it positive or negative, is always there, and must 
always be reckoned with. 
When a person leaves school and undertakes a bread- 
winning occupation, further mental development is 
likely to depend upon the demands that his social 
environment makes. If he casts his lot with a sluggish, 
unprogressive group, the chances are that he will stand 
still mentally or even deteriorate.t If by chance or 
1 This has been frequently the case with children of backward races who 
have been taken from their primitive homes and given school advantages in 
progressive communities, and who have then returned to their own ‘people 
only to settle back into the standards that are exemplified all about them
-P-A-G-E-153
  MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 141 
design he finds himself among alert and progressive 
people, he will almost inevitably respond in some meas- 
ure to the stimulus that such an environment affords. 
As new ideas, standards, methods of living, and methods 
of work are adopted by the group, he will put forth effort 
to grasp their meaning and to mold his own life con- 
sistently with them. Thus his own mental growth is 
stimulated by the urge that he feels to imitate — to make 
himself like — those with whom he is associated.) af 
Discovery, invention, and initiative: “creative infer 
ligence.”’ — If this tendency to imitate is so strong and 
pervasive, one may well ask how it is that progress of any 
sort is possible. The answer is that, while imitation is a 
powerful force, and while it fulfills a most important 
function in holding men together in working groups or 
societies, its influence may be profoundly modified in 
two ways. 
(a) Even the child, while tending to copy the patterns 
that he finds reflected in his surroundings, is also certain 
to make for himself discoveries. Quite by accident, and 
without imitating anyone, he finds that a certain move- 
ment that he makes results satisfactorily, and thereafter 
he tends to repeat the movement and to build into his 
experience an element that to him is original — although 
millions of other children may have ‘“‘hit upon’’ the same 
discovery. Further than this, the child in attempting 
to realize a keen wish or desire may deliberately plan a 
method that will enable him to reach the desired end, 
and this method may be for him an absolutély new 
invention — although, again, the same invention may 
have been made by countless other children. One who 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
     142 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
  watches children carefully will find innumerable exam- 
ples of both discovery and invention; but because they 
usually concern what the adult considers trivial and 
unimportant things, little attention is paid to them. 
The ability thus to depart in some measure from the 
pattern or copy that the race has set is called ‘‘initiative.” 
Of late the term “creative intelligence” has become 
current with reference to the same trait, especially when 
applied to highly original instruments, plans, or proposals 
that have a profound effect on human life. Most of the 
men and women who are recognized by history as ‘‘great”’ 
owe their distinction to the fact that they conceived or 
created something that was both new and useful. It may 
have been the germ of a scientific principle, as when 
Galileo by a keen interpretation of the swinging chande- 
liers in the cathedral at Pisa laid the basis of the theory 
of gravitation which Newton later formulated into law. 
It may have been the initiation of a new machine for 
harnessing energy as when James Watt thought out and 
constructed the first practicable steam-engine. It may 
have been a new vision of social responsibility for the 
weak and erring, as when John Howard convinced the 
English people that the government of their prisons was 
inexcusably and unnecessarily brutal. But whatever it 
was, it has borne the unmistakable hallmark of originality 
and initiative. One may perhaps achieve a certain meas- 
ure of temporary recognition by reaction and destructive 
criticism; sometimes, indeed, the conservative may dis- 
charge a very useful function by checking new moye- 
ments until they have demonstrated their worth; but it 
still remains true that the world’s gratitude through the 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 143 
ages goes, not to the “‘stand-patter,” but to the innova- 
tor, the reformer, the discoverer, the inventor, the creator. 
The important factor in human progress, then, is the 
new idea, the putting together of past experiences in new 
ways. The result is sometimes crystallized in material 
things, in useful objects, utensils, and machines. From 
stylus and quill to fountain-pen and typewriter; from 
the sickle, the scythe, and the cradle to the mowing 
machine, the self-binder, and the harvester; from the 
hand-lever printing press to the cylinder press; from the 
oxcart to the automobile: there is a clear sequence of 
new ideas, each carrying with it some increment of 
improvement in man’s control over his environment. 
In the realm of human relationships, the same kind of 
progress is observable. All social institutions are at basis 
inventions, and their gradual improvement and adapta- 
tion to human needs have been marked by the gradual, 
accumulation and acceptance of new ideas. The home is 
an invention, and the fine relationships expressed in 
respect for age and respect for womanhood have had a 
long and tortuous evolution. The church; the state; 
civil society; our modes of salutation; the clothes we 
wear; the fashions, modes, and styles of clothes; the 
system of describing lands and the modes of conveying 
them; our music and art; our law; and our systems of 
education: all these are inventions which have been 
wrought by human minds — most of them during the 
few thousand years that have elapsed since the end of the 
Old Stone Age. Above all and beyond all, our methods 
of thinking are inventions, and the ideal of progress was 
itself a discovery! 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
144. AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
(b) Man, then, is not exclusively an imitating animal; 
-his mind has constructive and creative abilities which 
have already demonstrated their power in countless 
ways. The distinctively human type of progress, which 
depends upon new ideas, has seemed slow and halting. 
The heavy hand of tradition, imitation, and conserva- 
tism has seemed to hold men back, and in a certain sense 
it has retarded and still retards human progress.! It 
is easy to become depressed and discouraged by the 
slowness of progress, and to reach the pessimistic conclu- 
sion that the human race is incorrigible. The briefest 
study of the history of civilization would seem to suggest 
afar more hopeful conclusion. Progress must of necessity 
seem slow when viewed ‘‘close up.’’ But when one sees 
happenings in a due perspective, the situation is entirely 
altered. A full generation separated Galileo from New- 
ton. Forty-six years elapsed between the granting of the 
patent to Watt for the first practicable steam engine 
and the operation of the first successful locomotive by 
Stephenson. The American nation was in existence for 
nearly three quarters of a century before all white men 
could vote; another decade elapsed before the restric- 
tions of the suffrage relative to color and race were 
removed; while the enfranchisement of women had to 
wait more than half a century longer. 
1 We can study the operation of this factor to-day in one of the most re- 
markable phenomena of history: the failure of civilized peoples to put an end 
to warfare even after a most stupendous and costly world conflict which 
was prosecuted in part to achieve this very end. And yet one cannot doubt 
that the great masses of people in all civilized countries sincerely desire to 
see the peril of warfare ended for all time. Even though it may be true that 
selfish and self-seeking groups contribute gladly to the confused thinking 
which now impedes the solution of the problem, it is equally true that thou- 
sands of men and women whose motives could never be questioned, — who 
have nothing to gain and would scorn to gain from war, — are uncertain 
and bewildered. They cannot see clearly how the adjustment can be made 
between nationalism and a thoroughgoing international unity.
-P-A-G-E-157
  
MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 145 
The essentially hopeful and encouraging fact is that 
human progress, slow at first, has increased its momen- . 
tum until to-day a single decade witnesses changes more 
profound and advances more notable than generations 
or even millenniums accomplished with primitive man. 
This acceleration has been due to a variety of factors, 
to some of which we have already referred.!. Among the 
most important has been the gradual coming to self- 
consciousness of the ideal of progress itself. This seems, 
indeed, to be the fortunate solution of the apparent 
inconsistency between imitation and initiative. In 
the modern world, initiative, invention, change, discovery, 
and progress have been givena pervasive social sanction. 
They constitute the new ‘‘pattern” which society sets. 
Thus, even if it be true that most men are conservative 
by nature (a conclusion which has yet to be established), 
it is also true that one of the ideals now most sedulously 
“conserved” is the ideal of progress, the ideal of change. 
Invention and genius. — It is usually believed that 
human progress owes its impetus to persons of unusual 
native gifts. The following quotation puts this point of 
view clearly:   
“The human mind has been built up through hundreds of 
thousands of years by gradual accretions and laborious accumu- 
lations. Man started at a cultural zero and had to find out every- 
thing for himself; or rather a very small number of peculiarly 
restless and adventurous spirits did the work. The great mass of 
humanity has never had anything to do with the increase of intel- 
ligence except to act as its medium of transfusion and perpetua- 
tion. Creative intelligence is confined to the very few, but the 
many can thoughtlessly avail themselves of the more obvious 
1See Chapter III.   
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
achievements of those who are highly endowed. Even an ape 
will fit himself into a civilized environment. A chimpanzee can 
be taught to relish bicycles, roller-skates, and cigarets which he 
could never have devised, cannot understand, and could not 
reproduce.. Even so with mankind. Most of us could not have 
devised, do not understand, and consequently could not repro- 
duce any of the everyday conveniences and luxuries which sur- 
round us. Few of us could make an electric light, or write a good 
novel to read by it, or paint a picture for it to shine upon. 
“_..So history, namely change, has been mainly due to a small 
number of ‘seers,’ — really gropers and monkeyers — whose na- 
tive curiosity outran that of their fellows and led them to escape 
here and there from the sanctified blindness of their time. 
“The seer is simply an example of a variation biologically, such 
as occurs in all species of living things, both animal and vege- 
table... .”1 
This explanation which attributes human progress 
almost entirely to the production of variations from the 
usual human type, —to the fortunate appearance of 
“natural” geniuses, —found its most substantial ad- 
vocate in a man who himself ranks as one of the out- 
standing figures in the history of modern science, — 
Sir Francis Galton.? In 1869 Galton published a remark- 
able book, Hereditary Genius, in which he set forth an 
abundance of evidence tending to show that the unusual 
ability which is recognized as genius is due not so much 
to environment and training as to biological variation 
and physical heredity. The plausibility of this evidence 
has led many people to infer that the only sure and cer- 
1J. H. Rosrnson: The Mind in the Making, pp. 79f. Harper, 1921. 
2 Francis Galton was born in 1822 and died in 1911. In addition to his 
important work in the scientific study of mental heredity, he was one of the 
pioneers in applying mathematics to social and psychological problems, and 
he laid many of the bases of the present-day science of statistics. He was 
cousin of Charles Darwin.
-P-A-G-E-159
MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 147 
tain way to promote human progress is through a process 
of selection parallel to that which the stockbreeder 
practices in producing better strains or varieties of 
domestic animals. This proposal is known as the 
doctrine of ‘‘eugenics,”’ a term that Galton himself was 
the first to use. 
A lively controversy has grown up with regard to the 
validity of this general theory, — the battle between the 
“hereditarian” and the “environmentalist,” the former 
following Galton in ascribing the preponderant influence 
to heredity (‘‘nature”) and consequently laying a heavy 
emphasis upon eugenics as a social policy, the latter 
scribing the preponderant influence to environment 
(‘nurture’). and consequently urging the claims of 
ducation and training. 
We shall come more closely in touch with this question 
(the answer to which is obviously of basic importance to 
ucation) in a later chapter.!| In the present chapter, 
we are interested in it only as it affects the problem of 
ental development. Even granting that the forward 
ushes are given by those who owe their strength to 
nherent or native abilities, — even granting that “‘cre- 
tive intelligence is confined to the very few,” — does 
t follow that the many merely “thoughtlessly avail 
hemselves of the more obvious achievements of those 
who are highly endowed”? Or is it true that, in using 
nd profiting by the advances that genius initiates, the 
‘common man” rises somewhat toward the level that 
enius has attained? 
An affirmative answer to the latter question is dis-

-P-A-G-E-160
148 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tinctly justified if the conception of mental development 
that we have sketched in this chapter is at all valid. 
There seem, indeed, to be two modes of mental develop- 
ment: one imitative, causing the individual to follow in 
the general path that someone else has blazed and yet to 
surmount, each in his own way, the obstacles that beset 
his progress; the other, original, creative, impelling the 
individual to make new discoveries and inventions, and 
to solve new problems; but both representing real mental 
growth. It is well to emphasize as Professor Robinson 
has done in his book, Mind in the Making, the vital 
significance of ‘‘creative’’ intelligence. It would be a 
grave error to infer from this emphasis that the other 
way of mental development — the way that follows 
rather than leads — is neither true mental development 
nor essential to human progress. Two important 
matters may be briefly referred to in this connection. 
(a) Impressed by the importance of developing in- 
itiative and originality, many persons have jumped to 
the conclusion that a faithful and systematic study of 
what others have worked out in some way confines or| 
even crushes one’s own original tendencies. It is a 
easy step from this to what is virtually a discrediting 
knowledge or race-experience in the work of education, 
One frequently hears the phrases “mere knowledge,” 
“book-learning,”’ and the like spoken in a contemptuous 
tone; and while it is right to condemn the attitude tha‘ 
looks upon knowledge merely as an ornament, — merel 
as a means of separating the “cultured” from th 
“erowd,’’ —it is very easy to carry this condemnatioi 
so far as to cast suspicion upon the kind of learning tha 
     
    
   
   
     
     
   
  
-P-A-G-E-161
  MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 149 
earnestly and sincerely attempts to master what the 
race has learned. Far from being inconsistent with 
initiative and originality, such a mastery, as Professor 
Thorndike! has clearly pointed out,? is essential to the 
highest and most useful forms of creative and con- 
structive effort. 
(b) While it would be difficult to overestimate the 
services that have been rendered by men and women of 
genius, it would be just as unfortunate not to recognize 
that contributions to progress depend very largely upon 
the level that has already been attained, not alone or 
chiefly by the leaders that have preceded, but also and 
more fundamentally by the great masses. The message 
of Lincoln would have fallen on deaf ears had not the 
people to whom he appealed reached a point of mental 
development where they could understand and appreci- 
ate what he had to say. More than that, lesser men did 
much to prepare the way for Lincoln, — Garrison who 
was persecuted for his opinions, and Lovejoy who was 
murdered by a mob, and John Brown who was executed 
for treason. All this does not detract from Lincoln’s 
enduring personal contribution to human progress, but 
it does serve to illustrate the fact that many men and 
many minds work together to insure almost every for- 
ward movement of civilization, and that the tendency to 
ascribe progress solely to the efforts of unusually gifted 
men and women needs some measure of correction. 
1 Edward Lee Thorndike (born 1874) has probably done more than any 
other person to promote the scientific study of educational problems. His work in the refinement of statistical methods as applied to these problems is 
especially notable. For a quarter of a century he has been professor of edu- 
cational psychology in Teachers College, Columbia University.

150 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Speaking of the “‘law of continuity” in history, Professor 
E. P. Cheyney makes this significant statement: 
“In popular belief Alfred founded Oxford, Luther began the 
Reformation, Gutenberg invented printing, Jefferson wrote the 
Declaration of Independence, the Kaiser started the Great War; 
yet none of these statements satisfies the thoughtful historian. 
Actual origins elude us; everything is the outcome of something 
preceding; the immediate, sudden appearance of something, its 
creation by an individual or a group at one moment in time, is 
unknown in history.” ! 
Encouraging initiative and invention in children. — 
It is safe to say that the extent to which most children 
will manifest an inventive disposition depends largely 
upon the necessity which is felt by them to realize 
through their own constructive effort some desire that 
they keenly feel. In too many cases, undoubtedly, so 
much is done for children that the need of independent 
and original effort does not constitute a real ‘“urge.” 
Educational theory and practice have long recognized 
this fact, and many of the teaching-methods that are 
now recognized as ‘‘good practice’’ are built upon the 
theory that opportunity and stimulus must be provided 
for the independent activity of the learner. 
A father took his seven-year-old son to the woods one afternoon. 
‘The boy became thirsty just as they arrived at a spring of water. 
‘They had no cup and the problem was to find a way of getting a 
drink. The boy suggested that he could lie down and drink; the 
father objected that he would get muddy and wet. The boy then 
proposed that he could make a cup of his two hands. The father

an Historical Association, December, 1923), American Historical Review, 
January, 1924, p. 237.

MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 151 
said that there was a better way. The boy apparently did not see it; 
so the father said that there was something not very far away out 
of which a serviceable drinking-cup could be made. The hint was 
sufficient and the boy gathered some large leaves for the purpose. 
The father suggested that there was a still better cup to be had, 
and that the thing out of which the cup could be made was in his 
pocket. The pocket was emptied and the boy quickly selected an 
envelope out of which to make his cup. 
The usual procedure would have been for the father to say, taking 
the envelope from his pocket, ‘I will make a cup for you.” As it 
was, the boy’s own initiative was stimulated in at least a slight 
degree. His wits were challenged, and he responded. 
Which is the better procedure? The answer depends in part on 
.the aim that we have in view. If supplying the child with a drink 
by the shortest possible method is the end sought, then the father 
may well do all the thinking and deliver the drink to the child. 
Tf, on the contrary, the end sought is the development of the child’s 
ability to use his knowledge and experience in solving a new prob- 
lem, — in other words, to stimulate him to mental growth, — then 
the method described has plausible advantages. 
The school cannot go through life with the child to 
see that the knowledge which he acquires is used as it 
should be used, but the school can foster a constructive 
attitude toward what it teaches by having the learner 
re-invent and re-discover some of the simpler elements 
among the materials with which it deals. The school 
can also with demonstrated profit base some of its in- 
struction on the problems and purposes that appeal to 
the learner as well worth solving or realizing, and thus 
convince him that the materials that he is expected to 
master have a real value. The more important types 
of teaching that have been developed to meet these con- 
ditions will be discussed in Chapter IX. What we have 
to emphasize here is that the modern school is far from 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  152. AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
blind to the importance of stimulating initiative and 
originality as modes of mental growth. 
Insuring an appreciation of what progress has cost. — 
Even where it is impossible or impracticable to have the 
learner work out for himself the lessons that it is neces- 
sary for him to learn, it is often possible and always 
profitable to see to it that he appreciates the heritage 
that is placed at his disposal. Professor Robinson’s 
statement that ‘‘the many can thoughtlessly avail them- 
selves of the more obvious achievements of those who 
are highly endowed’’! points to a real need in educa- 
tion. One may merely ‘‘catch on’ to the “how” of 
machines and to the proper procedures in social life by 
following the copy in a passively imitative way, and 
fail to catch even a glimmer of their meaning and to 
sense what they have cost.? We all tend to take for 
granted the utensils and amenities of civilized life. Not 
infrequently we take an absurdly unjustified pride in 
their possession. With regard to these products of 
human thought and ingenuity and effort we are very 
much like the person of whom Wordsworth wrote: 
““A primrose by the river’s brim 
A yellow primrose was to him, 
And it was nothing more.” 
To retrace with the learner, then, some of the impor- 
tant steps in the development of the materials that 
he will master — to show how these have been slowly 
and often laboriously wrought and refined from human

experience — is likely to do something toward giving 
him an understanding of the way in which great minds 
have worked, as well as a sense of his indebtedness to 
those who have smoothed the path for him, and a keen 
desire on his part to pass on the heritage not only un- 
diminished by his neglect, but enlarged by his own 
creative efforts. 
The scientific method as a means of realizing the 
ideal of progress. — We said a few pages back that 
modern civilization differs from its predecessors in plac- 
ing a powerful social sanction upon change and progress, 
—that it has made progress itself a conscious ideal. 
This emphasis has gone hand in hand with the develop- 
ment of a method by which progress, instead of depend- 
ing chiefly either upon chance discoveries or upon the 
inventions of a few gifted persons, can be insured on a 
wide scale and in a systematic and continuous fashion 
through the efforts of large numbers of men and women 
who, though they may fall short of “genius,” are never- 
theless thoroughly competent to comprehend and apply 
a developed technique of promoting progress. This 
technique is known as the ‘‘scientific method.” Its 
gradual refinement has been a most important phase of 
mental development in the race; its effective mastery by 
a large number of persons in each generation will be an 
important factor in continued progress; but the surest 
guarantee of continued progress is to make certain that 
everyone have an appreciative understanding of this 
method. As was pointed out in Chapter IV, this is one 
of the problems of the universal school that have so far 
been least satisfactorily solved.
-P-A-G-E-166
154 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The essential characteristics of the scientific method. — 
The scientific method can be formulated in simple terms, 
but such a formulation, like the simple definitions of 
other large and comprehensive terms that we have 
discussed, is likely to be misleading. It is true that the 
scientific method usually involves (a) a definite problem 
to be solved; (b) a most careful and unprejudiced obser- 
vation of the “facts” in the case; (c) the framing of 
a provisional theory or hypothesis regarding the solution 
of the problem; (d) the careful testing and re-testing of 
this hypothesis, if possible under conditions in which 
every factor operating can be controlled, and its influence 
determined by accurate measurement (see pp. 65f.); and 
(e) the formulation of a final conclusion only after one 
is certain that all possible influences have been accounted 
for. While all of these steps are likely to be reflected in 
every piece of really scientific work, the problems in the 
various fields of scientific inquiry are so diverse and 
present so many different kinds of difficulty that it is 
extremely difficult to make this or any other general 
formula fit every item of scientific procedure in a single 
field. 
From the point of view of general education, however, 
the important task is not to give to every person skill in 
the application of the scientific method, for these skills 
are very highly specialized, —so highly specialized, 
indeed, that a single individual, however highly gifted, 
can scarcely hope to be a master of the special technique 
of investigation in more than one narrow field. The 
important task is to insure, through a study of typical 
illustrations of the scientific method, an understanding

       of the general procedure and above all a keen apprecia- 
tion of what the spirit of science is and what it has 
accomplished. 
Moral and aesthetic development as significant phases 
of mental development. — The development of mind as 
sketched in the preceding pages may appear to the 
reader to have laid undue emphasis upon what may be 
called ‘‘intellectual” development to the neglect of 
“moral’’ and “‘aesthetic” development. The three-fold 
division of mental functions under the terms ‘‘ knowing,” 
“feeling,” and ‘willing,’ although not recognized by 
modern psychology, still has a certain validity. Educa- 
tion must always face squarely the problems of ‘‘edu- 
cating the will” (‘‘moral” development) and “educating 
the feelings” (‘‘aesthetic’”’ development), as well as the 
problem of ‘‘educating the intellect.” In so far as a 
recognition of the three functions, — knowing, feeling, 
and willing, — will keep us from neglecting moral and 
aesthetic development, we should still retain the distinc- 
tions that these three terms imply. On the other hand, 
it is important that we do not let these useful terms lead 
us to the conclusion that knowing, feeling, and willing 
are even relatively independent of each other in the 
actual working of the human mind. In the present 
chapter and in the preceding chapters, we have had much 
to say about the ‘“‘knowing” side of mind, but it will be 
recalled that we have also emphasized at every point the 
primary function of “knowing,’’ — namely an improved 
control of conduct or behavior. Thus ‘‘intellectual” 
education in our treatment turns out to be, in a very 
real sense, ‘‘moral” education. We have also referred
-P-A-G-E-168
  
  156 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
repeatedly to appreciation as a most significant phase or 
outcome of learning, and appreciation is essentially a 
matter of feeling. To insure a growing appreciation of 
what is beautiful and true and good in the world about 
us is precisely what most people mean by ‘‘educating 
the feelings,’ while to insure especially the growing 
appreciation of the beautiful is the specific problem of 
“aesthetic education.” 
Some persistent problems of moral education. — While 
it is true that all education which is consciously directed 
toward the improvement of conduct is, in the last analy- 
sis, moral education, there are certain specific problems 
of moral education that must be given a separate and a 
somewhat independent recognition because of their 
basic significance to social life. Generally speaking, the 
phases of mental development that have been traced in 
this chapter have been marked by what all would agree 
to be moral progress. As the human mind has gradually 
improved its control over its environment, — as it has 
increased its capital of experience or knowledge and its 
power of projecting itself into the future, — it has also 
become more tolerant, more humane, more sympathetic, 
more willing to sacrifice for others. Out of its accumula- 
tion of experience, it has wrought not only knowledge in 
the narrower sense of the term, but also ideals and stand- 
ards of conduct that are essentially moral in their nature 
and significance; and these constitute a most important 
part of the heritage that is placed in the hands of the 
teacher to transmit ‘“‘unimpaired and with some incre- 
ment of meaning” to each succeeding generation. 
This responsibility of the teacher is of especial impor-
-P-A-G-E-169
  MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 157 
tance in an age of change and progress. The very ideal 
of progress that we have just been discussing is making it 
continually easier to discard, not only old machinery and 
utensils, not only old ways of working and living, but 
also old ideals and standards in the field of morals. In 
connection with these ideals and standards, a peculiar 
factor operates that does not appear at all in connection 
with other things that may be discarded. Moral stand- 
ards have been evolved through the ages as means of 
holding in leash individual desires and impulses that can- 
not be gratified indiscriminately without grave danger 
to the social structure. The temptation to give them up 
is consequently stronger as a rule than is the temptation 
to give up other things; hence the responsibility to keep 
them as vital controlling forces in each generation rests 
with increasing weight upon education. 
Beyond this, there is another factor that is operating 
to increase the school’s responsibility for moral education. 
These standards and ideals have been strongly fortified 
in the past by religion. The code of moral law that is 
represented by the Ten Commandments, for example, 
has had a far-reaching force and effectiveness because of 
its religious setting. Many people believe that the 
influence of religion has been declining in modern civiliza- 
tion, and whether this be true or false, there is no doubt 
that the idea of eternal punishment (which, whether we 
like to admit it or not, gave a powerful sanction to the 
moral law) has lost much of its force. The school, then, 
must devise some means by which the moral controls 
can be made effective, and in our country the school must 
do this without recourse to the most powerful sanctions
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
which have been the mainstays of the moral standards 
in the past.1. We shall revert to this very significant 
problem in Chapter IX, ‘‘The Outcomes of Teaching and 
Learning.” 
Summary. — This chapter has considered mind as 
consciousness, and has thought of the development of 
mind as the development of a conscious control over 
conduct or behavior. It has recognized that conscious- 
ness not only mirrors past experience and interprets 
present situations in the light of past experience, but also 
anticipates the future, projects itself into the future. 
The development of mind in all of these directions is due 
in part to an unfoldment of natural tendencies, but it is 
also due to an infoldment of experiences. The enlarge- 
ment of the capital of experience or knowledge upon which 
1 There are wide differences of opinion as to whether moral progress is now 
keeping pace with material and intellectual progress. There are numerous 
expressions of a pessimistic and even a despairing attitude, but many of these 
are based upon an uncritical observation of conditions that are probably 
neither fundamental nor permanent. The older members of each generation 
are likely to ‘‘ view with alarm” the standards and the conduct of the younger 
members. This phenomenon is as old as history, and need not disturb us 
unduly. On the other hand, history very clearly teaches that every period 
of rapid progress involves very serious dangers of moral deterioration; every 
pronounced change in the conditions of social life involves new moral peril 
and inasmuch as the present age is distinctly one of profound social readjus 
ments, these perils must be reckoned with to-day. It is particularly note- 
worthy that, in spite of our recent progress in many phases of civilization, 
there has been a notable absence of progress in some things that are un- 
questionably fundamental. Science and education, working together, have 
succeeded marvelously well in increasing the average life-span by reducing the 
danger of death from disease. Science and education are now working. to- 
gether with already demonstrated success to reduce the hazard of death from 
accidents. (This is the movement known as “‘safety education.”) But in 
our country the risk of violent death by murder has shown no tendency to 
diminish during the generation that has witnessed such marked progress in 
other directions. Our national ‘‘homicide record’ is not only a national 
scandal; it is a scandal that so far shows no signs of abatement. The homicide 
record, however, from our point of view is not nearly so significant in itself 
as it is when one regards it as a general index of the situation that exists re- 
garding serious crime and the respect. that the masses of the people have for 
the rights and welfare of others, —in short, the “respect for law.” This 
seems to be a problem that education has not yet satisfactorily solved. 
    
-P-A-G-E-171
  MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 159 
mind works, and the increase in its power to interpret and 
predict, are due largly to the demands that its environ- 
ment makes upon it. Generally speaking, mind grows 
through its new efforts, — through the “stretches” that 
it makes to ‘“‘grasp”’ larger and larger meanings, — but 
whether it will put forth the effort depends usually upon 
pressure of some sort, and most frequently upon social 
pressure. The direction that mental growth will take is 
ordinarily determined by the patterns or copies that the 
social environment provides; hence imitation is a funda- 
mental mode of mental development. But mind may 
also grow through its own initiative; as well as appropri- 
ating the discoveries and inventions that others have 
made, it may itself discover and invent. Unusual ability 
to initiate, discover, and invent is the characteristic of 
genius, but all normal minds have this capacity to some 
extent. Present-day civilization places a heavier pre- 
mium upon initiative and its products than did any of - 
the earlier civilizations;! change and progress now con- 
stitute in themselves a pattern or copy that society sets 
for the individual to imitate. 
While true mental development includes the develop- 
iment of moral ideals and standards and of aesthetic 
astes as well as the development of the intellect, and 
while mind operates as a unit and not as a combination 
f separate ‘‘faculties” (such as knowing, feeling, and 
willing), it is well to recognize that moral education and 
sthetic education are problems that the school cannot 
eglect, and that moral education is especially important 
n an age that is marked by profound social changes.

  Qusstions, EXERCISES, AND PROBLEMS 
1. Note in your own experience the differences between semi- 
consciousness when you are just falling asleep or gradually awaken- 
ing from sleep and the full consciousness of waking life. 
2. Imagine an entirely uneducated adult in your classroom. 
How would his consciousness of his surroundings differ from yours? 
Imagine a primitive savage in your dining room. What would he 
“make of” the furniture, the dishes, the silverware, the habits and 
manners of the diners? 
3. Note the way in which even the immediate recognition of the 
objects about you reflects your past experience. Compare this im- 
mediate recognition with the experience of searching in your memory 
for definite past events with which to identify the objects. Watch 
for occasions when you have a vague feeling of familiarity which 
you try to make definite by explicitly recalling a past event; (this 
frequently happens in meeting people whom you have met before 
but whom you cannot quite “‘locate’’). | 
4. Consider each of the studies that you have pursued during the 
present year, and list for each the principal ie acquaintance with 
which has seemed to promote your own mental growth. Which of 
these have been hardest to “grasp”? Which do you regard as the 
“biggest” ideas, and what is your basis for judging the “‘size” of 
an idea? 
5. In the study of geometry in the high Sigal: you doubtless 
had two kinds of exercises: in some cases you studied the demon- 
stration of certain theorems as these had been worked out by the 
author of the textbook; in other cases, the theorem was simply 
stated and you were directed to work out the demonstration. Do you 
feel that you achieved any “menital growth” from the former? If so, 
did it differ in any way front whatever mental growth you may have 
gained from the latter? i 
6. Describe any school experiences that you may have had which 
seem to you to have developed your “initiative,” What methods 
of teaching did these experiences usually involve? What phases of 
your school work do you think operated to apant or kill your ini- 
tiative and originality? 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  
MIND AND ITS DEVELOPMENT 161 
7. Study your classmates and identify those that seem to be the 
most original. How do these students rank with respect to their 
mastery of knowledge or “‘scholarship’’? 
8. Observe in an elementary-school classroom the ways in which 
the teacher definitely attempts to insure mental growth on the part 
of the pupils through (a) encouraging them to “stretch” their 
minds, (6) getting them acquainted gradually with ideas of increasing 
difficulty, (c) encouraging them to initiate, discover, and invent. 
Note opportunities for such stimulation that the teacher may have 
overlooked. 
| 9. Study the work of an elementary-school classroom to deter- 
mine what specific steps the teacher takes that could be classified 
as “moral education.” As “aesthetic education.”

NATURE’S PROVISIONS FOR LEARNING 
Man a “learning animal.” — In the preceding chap- 
ter it was pointed out that mental development is due in 
part to inborn tendencies that are just as much a part of 
man’s nature as are the inborn tendencies that determine 
his physical growth. Further than this those phases of 
mental development that are not in themselves inborn 
are based in the final analysis upon native or inborn 
tendencies. Nature has done much to make man 
distinctively a learning animal.. Man himself has been 
able to work out his human destiny because he has been 
able to avail himself of the experiences of those who have 
gone before, but this very ability rests upon certain 
important natural or ‘‘unlearned”’ traits and tendencies. 
The present chapter will discuss some of the more im- 
portant features of this natural equipment which makes) 
both civilization and education pebble 
ImporTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MAN AND THE 
Lower ANIMALS 
1. The lengthened period of infancy. — Most of the 
lower animals come into the world fairly well equipped 
for maintaining themselves in the struggle for life. Many 
of the very low forms are practically ‘“‘mature”’ from the 
outset; that is, they can at once move about, find their 
own food, combat their enemies, and propagate their 
162

  NATURE’S PROVISIONS FOR LEARNING 163 
species. As animals increase in complexity of organiza- 
tion, however, they tend to bring forth immature off- 
spring; in these cases, the young must pass through a 
certain “‘period of infancy’’ during which they are cared 
for by their parents; at the outset they are relatively 
helpless. In no other species of animal life are the 
offspring so helpless and dependent at the beginning as 
is the human infant; in no other species is the period of 
immaturity, — the “‘period of infancy,’’—so long in 
proportion to the total life-span as in the case of man. 
Prolonged immaturity means plasticity and necessity 
or guidance. — This helplessness, however, turns out in 
the end to be one of the very great advantages of human- 
kind. The very fact that the nerve-connections which 
control behavior are for the most part incomplete at 
birth makes possible a far-reaching plasticity of behavior 
las contrasted with the relatively fixed and unchangeable 
behavior to which most of the lower animals are limited, 
nd which even the highest of the animal orders below 
an cannot far transcend. In general, the more numer- 
us and precise the definite movements possible when the 
nimal first comes into the world, the fewer will be the 
ossibilities of learning. In general, the greater the need 
or adult care, control, and guidance during the period 
f immaturity, the more numerous are the ultimate 
hances of progress. One writer has set forth the essen- 
jal contrasts as follows:     
     
   
    
            
       
   
      “Every child is born destitute of things possessed in manhood 
which distinguish him from the lower animals. Of all industries 
he is artless; of all institutions he is lawless; of all languages he 
is speechless; of all philosophies he is opinionless; of all reasoning

he is thoughtless; but arts, institutions, languages, opinions, and 
mentations he acquires as years go by from childhood to manhood. 
In all of these respects the new-born babe is hardly the peer of 
the new born beast; but, as the years i ever and ever he 
exhibits his superiority in all the great classes of activities until 
the distance by which he is separated from the brute is so great 
that his realm of existence is in another kingdom of nature.” ! 
This relationship between the lengthened “period of 
infancy” in the human species and man’s progress in 
civilization was suggested more than two thousand years| 
ago by some of the keen Greek philosophers, but its| 
fundamental significance was not piped pointed out| 
until the marked difference as well as the clear resem- 
blances between man and the lower animals became 
serious subject of study following the epoch-makin, 
investigations of Charles Darwin in the second quarte 
of the nineteenth century. John Fiske? deserves th 
chief credit for setting forth this ilhdehinating principle. 
2. “Social heredity” as a distinctively human pre 
rogative. — The lengthened period of infancy in th 
human species is important primarily because it enable: 
man to transmit to his offspring the ene of his ow: 
experience and of the experience of his predecessors, 
The child acquires these products in part through un 
guided imitation and in part from the conscious an 
deliberate instruction and training provided by adults

popularize the philosophy of evolution as set forth especially by Herber| 
Spencer. In doing this, he added to the Spencerian teachings certain theorie| 
of his own, by far the most important of which was his interpretation of thy 
period of humaninfancy. Fiske also wrote extensively in the field of Ameri 
can history.

  NATURE’S PROVISIONS FOR LEARNING 165 
These processes of transmission are often referred to as 
“social heredity” in contrast with ‘‘physical heredity,” 
the latter term covering the transmission of traits or 
characteristics through the germ-cells. Man _ shares 
with the lower animals the power to transmit his char- 
acteristics by physical heredity, but he alone possesses 
in a significant measure the added advantage of trans- 
mission through social heredity. 
“Acquired characters” probably not transmitted by 
physical heredity. —It is now a fairly well established 
principle that definite changes or modifications in the 
structure of an animal which come about during its 
individual lifetime because of the action of outside or 
“environmental” forces are not transmitted to the off- 
spring through physical heredity. For example, if .a 
man has had an arm amputated in early life, his children 
will not be born ‘‘one-armed.’”’ Nor will the bonds that 
experience establishes in the nervous system be trans- 
mitted through the germ-cells. A man may laboriously 
acquire skills of one sort or another; these mean the for- 
mation and fixation of certain definite connections in the 
nerve-substance; but the children of this man will not 
be born with these fixed connections; if the children are 
to ‘‘inherit”’ the same skills, it is social heredity, and not

stantiated, this hypothesis will be of great significance to educational theory.

even learn fairly complicated skills; but these skills, like 
those that man acquires, cannot be transmitted to the 
offspring by physical heredity; and, unlike man, the 
lower animals have no ready channels of ‘“‘social hered- 
ity”? through which these gains can be passed on by the 
adults of each generation to the young of the next. 
Physical heredity vs. social heredity. — As a result of 
these limitations, progress in the lower animal orders is 
very slow and very gradual; only ‘‘germinal” variations 
of a type that can be transmitted through biological 
reproduction will result in permanent changes, and it is 
always problematical whether these germinal variations 
will be in the direction of progress. Man, on the other 
hand, can transmit his successful modifications through 
social heredity, and thus accumulate from generation to 
generation the elements that make for progress. As we 
have seen, this process of accumulation takes what we 
consider a long time, but compared with the long gen- 
erations that progress through germinal variation 
requires, the time is relatively very short. 
Organic vs. social evolution. — The contrast between 
physical heredity and social heredity is often referred to 
as a contrast between two distinct types of evolution: 
(a) organic evolution, which depends upon the appear- 
ance of germinal variations and their perpetuation by 
physical heredity; and (6) social or human evolution, 
which depends upon the appearance of modifications 
and their perpetuation by social heredity. By the same 
token, the products of human experience which are thus 
transmitted by social heredity are often spoken of as the 
“social heritage,’ the ‘‘human heritage,” or the ‘‘cul-

ture-heritage,” to distinguish them from the physical 
or biological heritage. 
3- The highly organized instincts of the lower animals 
as contrasted with the “innate tendencies” of man. — 
The lengthened period of infancy helps us to explain still 
another important difference between man and the lower 
animals. It was said above (p. 162) that many of the 
lower animals almost from the outset can move about, 
find their own food, combat their enemies, and propa- 
gate their species. This means that they come into 
the world with nerve-connections already fixed which 
enable them to carry out complex acts without going 
through a period of training or learning. These inborn 
connections are the physiological basis of what the 
psychologist calls ‘‘instincts.” For our purposes an in- 
stinct may be defined as a relatively complex type of 
behavior for which fixed and definite nerve-connections 
are provided by physical heredity. 
The behavior of most of the animals below man is 
almost entirely governed by these inherited ‘‘controls,”’ 
and, as we have seen, this behavior tends to remain 
relatively unchanged from generation to generation. 
The human infant, on the other hand, has very few of 
these definite and perfected nerve-connections fixed at 
birth. He can breathe and take food and cry; but he 
cannot control to any marked extent the movements of 
the trunk and limbs. This is one of the disadvantages 
of being born a human being, but, as we have also seen, 
“this temporary disadvantage is offset in an overwhelming 
measure by the advantage of plasticity; not being bur- 
dened with fixed and unchangeable modes of behavior, 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
the human infant is in a position to learn or acquire the 
modes of behavior that meet best the conditions under 
which he will live. 
Instincts and innate tendencies. —'There has been a 
lively controversy among psychologists as to whether 
the human infant possesses more or fewer instincts than 
do the lower animals. If we define an instinct as a com- 
plex type of behavior for which fixed and definite nerve- 
connections are provided by physical heredity, it is clear 
that the instinctive equipment of the human infant is 
very meager indeed; but if we were to conclude that the 
human infant has few inborn tendencies to act in some- 
what definite ways we should probably be mistaken. 
For this reason it is well to distinguish between the fixed 
and definite instincts of the lower animals, and the in- 
nate (or inborn or instinctive) tendencies of man. The 
latter are just as much the product of physical heredity 
as are the former, but they differ in being less definite 
and much more amenable to modification. We can ex- 
plain this by reference to the lengthened period of in- 
fancy. In all probability, the very remote ancestors of 
man had full-fledged instincts comparable with those of 
the lower animals. As infancy became prolonged, it 
may well have come about that the human offspring 
came into the world with fewer and fewer of the nerve- 
connections firmly fixed. With most of these connections 
it is probable that only the initial stages of development 
are perfected at birth. Most of the instincts have be- 
come, as it were, “truncated.” Something innate is 
there, but it expresses itself as a tendency and not as a 
perfected movement.
-P-A-G-E-181
  NATURE’S PROVISIONS FOR LEARNING 169 
Tue Innate TENDENCIES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY 
SIGNIFICANT IN TEACHING AND LEARNING 
The innate sources of motives. — These innate ‘‘ten- 
dencies to act’’ manifest themselves chiefly in the form 
of strong impulses or desires which are of the very great- 
est importance in human life because they probably 
constitute the basic sources of human ‘‘motives.” They 
are, indeed, powerful ‘‘moving” forces impelling the 
individual to certain types of action. Thus the fight- 
ing instinct, which in the lower animals expresses itself in 
definite and characteristic movements, becomes in man 
the fighting impulse, not at first (or natively) highly 
organized on the side of movement, but “‘impelling” or 
“driving” the individual either to make many move- 
ments some of which may be successful and consequently 
repeated until the nerve-connections have become well 
fixed, or to imitate successful movements that others 
make in like situations. The important point, how- 
ever, is that the primitive, age-old feelings, emotions, 
and passions still persist, although, because of the plas- 
ticity of the human nerve-connections, they do not 
often express themselves in fixed, unchangeable, and 
characteristic movement-types. 
From the point of view of teaching and learning cer- 
tain innate tendencies or impulses are of very great 
importance because they constitute nature’s provision 
for getting the learning process started. Among the 
most important of these tendencies are the following: 
The play impulse.— This is characteristic of the 
young of all animals that are born immature but es-
-P-A-G-E-182
170 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
pecially is it characteristic of the human offspring. The 
tendency to pick up and practice in playful activity the 
modes of behavior that may be useful in later life is one 
way in which the plasticity of infancy or immaturity is 
expressed. The inherited factor here is probably the 
general impulse itself, although there is some evidence 
that certain rather specific and definite types of play are 
also part of the inherited equipment. Just as puppies 
and kittens play at fighting and at hunting prey, so 
young children of all races play, with apparent spon- 
taneity, “hunting and fighting games. More clearly 
characteristic of children, however, is the expression of 
the play impulse in imitating the activities of older 
children or of adults. The importance of this type of 
play in facilitating learning is obvious. Long before the 
child can appreciate or understand the purpose or value 
of certain movements, he has the impulse to learn how 
to make these movements. Play is essentially activity 
that is self-sufficient, that has no consciously recognized 
end or aim. The impulse to play, then, may be looked 
upon as one of nature’s provisions for insuring the learn- 
ing of useful activities at a time when the real meaning 
or value. of these activities cannot be understood. 
The tendency to imitate. — The imitative factor has 
already been referred to as one of the important modes 
of mental development (Chapter VI), and we have just 
noted the fact that the play impulse often works itself out 
through imitative movements. That there is a ‘general 
instinct” of imitation, or an innate tendency to copy 
everything that one sees, is seriously doubted by most 
psychologists. It would be difficult, however, to explain
-P-A-G-E-183
  NATURE’S PROVISIONS FOR LEARNING 171 
the early mastery of language without assuming that 
this specific impulse to imitate is an inherited tendency, 
and there are doubtless other very specific types of imi- 
tation that are thoroughly instinctive. The tendency 
to follow the social pattern, which was so strongly em- 
phasized in Chapter VI, may best be looked upon as an 
acquired tendency, having its roots in some of these 
specific impulses, but owing its force and persistence 
chiefly to the social approval that normally attaches to 
it. 
The impulse of curiosity. — There can be little doubt 
that there is an inherited tendency to seek new forms of 
stimulation, which leads us to pry into things, to explore 
that part of the world that lies about us, and especially 
to find out what we can about new and unfamiliar 
objects. It is well known that very young children fol- 
low with the eyes objects that are moving; it is clear 
that this tendency to attend to moving objects must 
have been of large value in the primitive life that man 
lived for thousands of generations; consequently such a 
tendency may reasonably be thought of as having a 
biological basis. In the same way, strange and unfa- 
miliar objects were, under primitive conditions, sources 
of possible danger; hence the tendency to note such 
objects, and to find out what they are and what they 
mean, may also have been firmly established as part of 
the physical heritage. Again, it would have been of 
obvious advantage to primitive man to have a general 
tendency to pry into things, to explore his surroundings, 
to be interested naturally in what went on about him; 
and it is easily conceivable that a tendency having so
-P-A-G-E-184
172 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
large a ‘‘survival value’”’ may likewise be conditioned by 
inherited nerve-connections. 
In any event, whether or not one is justified in recog- 
nizing an “‘instinct”’ of curiosity, it is clear that every 
normal child evinces a keen desire to know about the 
world in which he lives. Often his curiosity is quickly 
satisfied; almost always it is difficult to hold him very 
long to any of these primitive and probably innate in- 
terests; but the tendency is none the less of great value 
as a starting point in the process of learning. 
Rivalry or emulation. — There can be no doubt that 
even very young children show a strong desire to draw 
attention to themselves, and evince marked feelings of 
envy and jealousy when others are given favors in which 
they themselves do not share. There is probably an 
innate basis for such desires and feelings; in any case, 
they are so thoroughly normal to childhood, and can be 
used so easily to incite the child to effort, that education 
has employed them freely — sometimes all too freely — 
as incentives to learning. 
In recent years there has been a distinct reaction 
against an overemphasis of rivalry and emulation in the 
schools. It has been maintained, and with reason, that 
an appeal to rivalry among individuals cultivates an 
unsocial attitude, encourages selfishness, and sometimes 
puts a premium upon unfair methods of obtaining an 
advantage. It has also been apparent that these rivalries 
have their greatest influence upon only a small propor- 
tion of the group. The slow learners soon discover that 
their case is hopeless, and become permanently dis- 
couraged. In many schools a successful effort has been
-P-A-G-E-185
  NATURE’S PROVISIONS FOR LEARNING 173 
made to replace rivalry among individuals by rivalry 
among groups. In this way, every member of the group 
has a strong motive for putting forth effort, for although 
he will not be able to surpass the brighter members of his 
group, his accomplishment, no matter how small, will 
add to the group’s accomplishment and perhaps enable 
the group to surpass its competitors. Another important 
modification of the primitive interest in rivalry and 
competition has been brought about by encouraging the 
individual to surpass, not the record of his fellows, but 
his own previous record. The development of the ‘‘ac- 
complishment quotient” (p. 192) promises to be of large 
service in this connection. Moreover, the emphasis 
upon interest as a motive reduces the opportunity for 
the more unfortunate expressions of rivalry. So long, 
however, as there is competition in the social world there 
will be ample stimulation of the desire to outshine 
one’s fellows. 
The social impulse. — Whether there is an inherited 
basis for distinctively social traits such as a willingness 
on the part of the individual to coéperate with others and 
to sacrifice his own interests for the social welfare, is a 
disputed question. Some students of the problem main- 
tain that man is naturally a social animal, — indeed, 
that he has well-defined instincts that impel him to co- 
operate with his fellows and to sacrifice his own desires 
for the common good. Others are skeptical as to the 
existence of these inherited tendencies; they are dis- 
posed to regard man as naturally an unsocial animal, 
and to explain the tendencies toward coédperation and 
sacrifice as traits that have been acquired because of
-P-A-G-E-186
ee ee 
174 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING | 
their recognized value, but which have not as yet become 
part of the inherited equipment and which must conse- 
quently be perpetuated from generation to generation 
by social heredity. The question is of fundamental 
importance to education because the way in which it is 
answered will make a decided difference in the responsi- 
bility that education must assume for the development 
of the social traits and in the methods that will be em- 
ployed to this end. Perhaps the safest hypothesis for 
education to accept pending further light is to recognize 
certain social tendencies as probably innate,’ but in 
general to regard such tendencies as less strong and 
pronounced than the individualistic tendencies, and 
consequently in greater need of confirmation and 
development through precept, example, inspiration, and 
training. 
Other applications of the theory of innate tendencies. 
— The above list does not comprise by any means all 
of the inherited tendencies that man possesses nor even 
all of the inherited tendencies that are important in 
teaching and learning. It may serve, however, as an 
introduction to the more extended study of “original 
nature’’ in the courses that the prospective teacher will 
1 Some cases are clear and unequivocal; for example, the mother’s impulse 
to sacrifice herself for her offspring. This is indisputably instinctive and is 
shared by the females of animal orders below man. There is probably, too, 
an innate basis that lies back of the desire for human companionship and the 
dread of solitude, but it seems likely that the custom of living together in 
large groups was a relatively late development in human evolution, and con- 
sequently that the “herding” instincts are not so deeply rooted as in some 
of the lower animal orders. It seems fairly evident that mankind does not 
possess innate social tendencies that are at all comparable with the social 
instincts of the ants, wasps, and bees, although mankind has clearly demon- 
strated its ability to acquire social traits that are just as complicated as are 
the activities of these animals. The important point is that, if social traits 
are acquisitions, they can be perpetuated only by social heredity, and par- 
ticularly by some form of education.
-P-A-G-E-187
NATURE’S PROVISIONS FOR LEARNING 175 
later undertake, especially in the field of psychology and 
child study. It may also give point to the following brief 
exposition of two important hypotheses. 
Periodicity in the appearance of innate tendencies. — 
It is generally believed that certain of the innate ten- 
dencies do not operate with equal strength throughout 
life, but have, so to speak, their periods of rise, domi- 
nance, and decline. It is well known, indeed, that 
marked changes in interests and impulses come with the 
development of the sex-functions (the period of “‘adoles- 
ence” beginning with girls usually at some time between 
the ages of ten and thirteen, and with boys a year or two 
later). The play impulse undergoes marked changes 
both before and during adolescence, as does also the im- 
pulse of curiosity. Many students of the problem believe 
that the social impulses do not appear in a marked meas- 
ure before the onset of sex-maturity. Some important 
educational practices are based on this assumption. These 
will be referred to in Chapter XII. 
Innate tendencies as the basis of attention and in- 
terest. — (1) Primary passive attention; primitive interests. 
—A more helpful hypothesis has to do with the relation of 
innate tendencies to attention and interest. Everyone 
knows that learning involves attention on the part of 
the learner and that a lively interest in what is learned 
greatly facilitates the process of learning. The innate 
tendencies may be thought of as the basis of natural or 
primitive interests. Attention is readily given to those 
objects and activities that “‘fit in” with these interests. 
[Because such attention involves little or no effort and 
because it is natural and primitive, it is sometimes 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  
  176 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
referred to as primary passive attention. The absorption 
of children in their play activities admirably illustrates 
this variety of attention. There is no temptation to 
attend to anything else. Hence, while play may involve 
mental and physical activity of the liveliest sort, it does 
not require an ‘‘effort of the will” to hold one’s self 
to it. 
(2) Active attention. — Contrasted with this primitive 
or ‘“‘primary passive” attention is that which is called by 
the psychologists ‘‘active attention.’”’” Work has fre- 
quently to be attended to that is not naturally interest- 
ing, — that does not ‘‘fit in” with any innate tendency 
or desire. One must then put forth effort to counteract 
the temptations to “do something else.” Sometimes a 
veritable battle must be fought with one’s self to deter- 
mine whether duty or desire will win the victory. This 
type of attention is almost always demanded at certain 
stages in the carrying through of any sustained task. 
Sometimes the struggle comes at the very outset, and 
one writer has used the phrase, ‘‘the agony of getting 
started,’ to describe a harrowing experience that is 
thoroughly familiar to all of us. At other times the start 
is easy enough, — perhaps we are attracted by the 
novelty of the task (a clear case of primary passive 
attention), — but the later stages become tiresome, and 
the struggle of ‘‘active attention”’ centers at such points.* 
Wherever it may be, the essence of active attention is 
always that it involves a conflict between what we desire 
to do and what we “‘know”’ we ought to do, — or what, 
1“ Sustained muscular or mental effort is . . . ‘unnatural’ to us, though it 
is necessary for the creation of the wealth and power without which civilized 
men could not exist.” — Granam Wauuas: The Social Heritage, p. 27.  
-P-A-G-E-189
  NATURE’S PROVISIONS FOR LEARNING 177 
in any case, we are obliged to do. This capacity to work 
steadfastly against desire, to hold primitive impulses in 
leash, and to pursue a steadfast course toward a remote 
goal, is so important that it has been characterized as 
the most important of all human attributes. 
Secondary passive attention: derived interests. — A 
third form of attention sometimes grows out of these 
bitter struggles. When a person has held himself reso- 
lutely to a task that has been initially unattractive, he 
may find that it gradually loses its disagreeable features, 
and not infrequently that it even comes to acquire a 
fascination of its own. There is no longer needed the 
desperate effort to resist distractions; there is no longer 
the struggle against desire. Attention has become 
“passive” again, but it is different in its origin from 
rimary passive attention in that it is not mediated by 
rimitive interests or innate tendencies. An acquired or 
ived interest has been achieved. Sustained work now 
oes forward smoothly and persistently. A remote goal 
is constantly being approached, but one does not have 
‘0 use this goal as a whip to keep one’s self true to the 
ourse. 
This hypothesis has educational and ethical implica- 
ions of large importance because it offers a working 
xplanation of the way in which the higher forms of 
terest are developed, — an explanation, too, that seems 
o be in harmony with the experience of most people. It 
ould be recognized, however, that there is a difference 
f opinion among students of the problem as to the strict 
alidity of the theory. Some believe that permanent 
interests of the higher type can be developed only

178 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
through the effort and struggle that active attention 
involves. Others maintain that primitive interests based 
upon innate impulses may pass over into derived interests 
of a permanent type without involving this more or less 
protracted period of intense and usually disagreeable 
effort. As to the fact that permanent and desirable 
interests are often developed through work that is dis- 
tasteful either at the outset or during some of its inter- 
mediate phases there seems to be no doubt. The ques- 
tion at issue is whether the struggle cannot be abbre- 
viated or even avoided if. appropriate steps are taken. 
Summary. — The present chapter has aimed to set 
forth some of the more important facts and hypotheses 
regarding original nature as manifested in instincts and 
innate tendencies, and the bearing of these facts and 
hypotheses on the problems of teaching and learning. 
The most important conclusions are: (1) that man 
possesses an inherited equipment of tendencies or im- 
pulses, some of which greatly facilitate the learnin, 
process; (2) that while physical heredity is important t 
education because it supplies this equipment and thu 
makes it possible to start the processes of education, th 
great significance of education itself lies in the fact tha 
it represents not physical heredity but social heredity 
(3) that nature’s best gift to humankind seems to hav 
been a capacity that has enabled man to transcen 
nature, to rid himself of the leading strings of perfecte 
instincts, and to work out his own destiny by accumu} 
lating and refining the fruits of his own experience; an 
(4) that each generation in all probability must pay th 
price of effort and struggle if it is to stand on the shoul

ders of its predecessors, and itself leave an enlarged 
heritage for those who come after. 
Questions, EXERCISES, AND PROBLEMS 
1. To what extent, if any, is there a difference in plasticity between 
male and female of the human species? 
2. Make a list of cases in which qualities have been said to have 
been inherited, —such as musical ability, art ability, skill in the 
use of tools, ability to speak in public, etc., and determine whether 
they can be explained on the basis of the influence of early social 
nvironment. 
3. By observing children, find a clear case of each kind of instinc- 
ive activity (or inborn tendency) named in this chapter, — and 
thers, if possible. 
4. In a similar way, find clear illustrations of “primary passive 
ttention,” “active attention,” ‘secondary passive attention,” 
‘native interest,” and “derived interest.” 
5. In what ways and how has man “transcended nature’’? 
6. How does the social heritage increase in volume? In quality? 
ow could a reverse process be set up and mankind move toward, 
ven into, barbarism?

ADAPTING MATERIALS TO INDIVIDUAL 
CAPACITIES 
The problem of the chapter. — In the preceding pages, 
the materials of education have been set forth in broad 
outline (Chapters III, IV, and V); the conditions under 
which these materials may stimulate mental growth 
within the limits set by native capacity have been dis- 
cussed (Chapter VI); and the importance of enlistin; 
the instincts and inborn tendencies in the service o 
education has been emphasized (Chapter VII). We no 
come to the heart of the teaching-problem, which is t 
adapt the materials of education that are socially valua. 
ble (and many of which are socially indispensable) t 
the widely varying capacities for learning represente: 
by the pupils of the universal school. We revert agai 
to a fundamental principle: However important, eve’ 
indispensable, the elements of the social heritage may be. 
their values cannot be realized in education until the 
have been reéxperienced by the learner and made a: 
integral part of his life.

must understand something of what the psychologist 
speaks of as ‘‘individual differences,’ or the wide varia- 
tions among individuals in the capacity to learn. Dur- 
ing the past two decades a great deal of careful work 
has been done in the scientific study of these differences, 
and the results of this study are already beginning to 
affect profoundly both the theory of education and the 
art of teaching. In this introductory book, it will not 
be possible to discuss this problem in detail. At the 
very outset of his professional study, however, the 
prospective teacher should recognize the importance of 
the problem, and know something of the way in which 
it will affect his later work. 
The fact of individual differences in learning-capacity 
has, of course, been known to teachers from time im- 
memorial. Some children are ‘bright’; others are 
“slow,” “dull,” or ‘‘stupid”; and a large number are 
recognized as ‘‘average.’’ Scientific studies were not 
needed to establish this fact, — but scientific studies 
have been important in revealing, first, the extent of these 
differences; secondly, their degree of persistence (whether 
they tend to disappear with further growth or to last 
through life) ; thirdly, their character as general or specific 
(whether a person who is ‘‘dull” in one kind of learning 
is likely to be “dull” in all kinds of learning); and 
fourthly, their cause (whether they are due to inheritance 
or to early training or to accidents of disease, nutrition, 
or what not). 
The extent of wvaniabingy in learning-capacity. — Sci- 
entific studies have shown that the differences in learn- 
ing-capacity are much wider than teachers generally

  182 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
believed prior to these studies. Of 100 six-year-old 
children it may be predicted that two or three could 
complete the work of the eighth grade within four years 
if they were stimulated to the same degree of effort that 
the average pupil will take to complete the same work in 
eight years; while approximately the same number of 
pupils working eight years with the same degree of 
effort will scarcely achieve a reasonable fourth-grade 
standing. 
Our knowledge with regard to this problem is most 
dependable in the case of arithmetic, because progress 
in this subject can be measured more accurately than 
progress in subjects like geography and literature. Bas- 
ing his conclusions on a large number of studies of in- 
dividual differences in the capacity to learn arithmetic, 
Thorndike! says: 
“The variation within a single class for which a single teacher 
has to provide is great. Even when teaching is departmental and 
promotion is by subjects, and when also the school is a large 
one and classification within a grade is by ability — there may 
be a wide-range for any given component ability. Under ordinary 
circumstances the range is so great as to be one of the chief limit- 
ing conditions for the teaching of arithmetic. Many methods 
appropriate for the top quarter of the class will be almost useless 
for the bottom quarter, and vice versa.” 
The persistence of differences in learning-capacity. — 
It is probably true that the wider differences in learning- 
capacity tend to persist throughout school life. The 
pupil who learns quickly in the first grade is likely to 
learn quickly in the fourth grade, the eighth grade, and

throughout the high-school and college years; and the 
slow learner of the first grade is likely to be similarly 
handicapped, in his later work. There are, however, 
numerous and important exceptions to this general rule, 
as will be pointed out when the causes of these differ- 
ences are under discussion. 
Is there a “general” learning-capacity or are learning- 
capacities specific? — The answer that scientific inves- 
tigation has given to this question is quite different from 
that which teachers were in the habit of giving before the 
problem was studied carefully by scientific methods. 
The clear tendency of the investigations is toward the 
conclusion that the person who learns one subject read- 
ily will learn other subjects readily, and this has led to 
the conviction among many psychologists that there is 
really such a thing as a general learning-capacity, — or, 
as they term it, a factor of ‘‘general intelligence,’ — 
which determines very largely the ease and rapidity 
with which one learns anything. This hypothesis of 
“general intelligence’ has become of outstanding im- 
portance in present-day discussions of educational and 
social problems. Indeed, it is not too much to say that 
the future not only of education but of social organiza- 
tion will turn upon the conclusions that are finally 
accepted regarding the existence and operation of this 
now hypothetical or assumed factor. The topic will be 
reverted to later in this chapter. 
The causes of differences in learning-capacities. — 
It is generally agreed among students of the problem that 
capacities for learning depend upon the condition of the 
nervous system, and especially of that part of the nervous
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
system, — the large brain or cerebrum, — the functions 
of which are known to be definitely related to mental 
life. The whole organization of the nervous system, as 
we have seen (Chapter II), may be thought of as an 
elaborate device for enabling one to make an adequate 
response or adjustment or movement to meet the con- 
ditions of the external world as reported through the 
sense-organs, and learning from this point of view in- 
volves the formation of bonds among neurones. 
Variations in the nerve substance. — While this physi- 
ological conception does not teach us all that we should 
like to know about learning, it does furnish a helpful 
basis for explaining differences in learning-capacities. 
The nervous system is one of the important parts of 
the body; it is an anatomical ‘‘structure,’”’ and it is 
consequently likely to be subject to the same laws that 
govern other anatomical structures. One of the most 
important of these is the law of biological variation. 
No two individuals are alike, and human beings vary 
just as other animals vary. They vary in height, 
in weight, in color of the hair, color of the eyes, tex- 
ture of the skin, and every other physical character- 
istic. If learning-capacities are dependent upon an 
anatomical structure — a purely physical characteristic 
— it is reasonable to assume that learning-capacities 
will differ among individuals just as all physical charac- 
teristics differ. 
Heredity may perpetuate these variations. — Nor is this 
all. It is known that while these physical character- 
istics show a wide variability among individuals they 
also show a considerable resemblance among families. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES 185 
Complementing the law of biological variation is the 
law of physical heredity, — “‘ Like breeds like.’’ If the 
color of the eyes, the texture of the skin, the tendency 
to be short or tall, stout or thin, are likely to be trans- 
mitted by heredity, it is reasonable to infer that the 
kind of nervous system that makes for quick or for slow 
learning is also likely to be inherited; and this inference 
seems to be fairly well borne out by actual cases, for 
bright parents tend to have bright children and dull 
parents tend to have dull children. 
Heredity as a factor in determining individual differ- 
ences. — The chief cause of the differences in learning- 
capacity that so greatly complicate the teacher’s task, 
then, is generally believed to be nothing less than 
heredity. Some children are “‘born long” and others 
are “‘born short,” and there, one might say, is the end 
of it — only, from the teacher’s point of view unfortu- 
nately it is rather the beginning of it! 
Some differences in learning-capacities are doubtless due 
to environmental factors. — While there can be no reason- 
able doubt that many and perhaps most of the differ- 
ences in learning-capacities are due to inherited differ- 
ences in the structure and functions of the nervous 
system, there are certainly some cases in which the 
factor of heredity does not play the determining 
part: — 
(1) Nourishment. — Children are sometimes appar- 
ently “slow” and “dull” because they are under- 
nourished. This has been found so serious a handicap 
to effective work in certain schools located in the “slums” 
that nutritious lunches are regularly provided, in some 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
    186 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
eases at public expense and in others by philanthropic 
enterprise, and almost invariably with a marked effect 
on the pupils’ progress in school. 
(2) Sleep. — Insufficient sleep and other conditions 
that promote physical exhaustion, such as undue excite- 
ment or an overplus of worry, may have a depressing 
effect upon learning-capacities. 
(3) Gland action. — Some persons are very sensitive 
to discouragement. Failures or disappointments will 
depress them mentally to the point where they may 
seem to be (and sometimes actually are) dull and obtuse. 
Success, on the other hand, may inspire them with a 
self-confidence that seems to release new sources of en- 
ergy; and they often surprise themselves and those who 
know them by the rapid progress that they make. It 
is now believed that these effects are due to physiological 
causes; the action of certain glands, — especially the 
thyroid, pituitary, and adrenal glands, — seems to be 
profoundly affected by mental states which either in- 
erease or diminish the glandular secretions, and these 
secretions in turn act upon the nervous system and 
condition the work that it does. It is true, of course, 
that the glands themselves, like the nervous system, are 
inherited structures, hence differences in learning-capaci- 
ties that trace back to glandular action might be thought 
of as “‘inherited’’ differences. If, however, the glandu- 
lar action itself depends in large part on factors that can 
be controlled, so to speak, from the outside, it is clear 
that heredity does not here impose the hard and fast 
limitations that it does in determining such physical 
characteristics as one’s height or the color of one’s eyes.
-P-A-G-E-199
  INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES 187 
(4) The will to learn. — Learning-capacities depend 
in part upon a favorable or unfavorable attitude of the 
learner toward the task of learning. While a resolute 
“will to learn” cannot accomplish miracles it may easily 
turn what would otherwise be complete failure into a 
moderate success, — under rare conditions, perhaps, into 
a brilliant success. In some families and in some com- 
munities, success in school work is given a very strong 
social sanction; intellectual effort is taken for granted.' 
In other families and other communities, the importance 
of schools and of intellectual progress is not highly re- 
garded, and the “will to learn” is not strongly stimu- 
lated. A few children doubtless have inborn capacities 
for learning that will override all handicaps, but for the 
great majority, the attitude that is encouraged or dis- 
couraged by the home and by the social environment 
will be an important factor in determining the progress 
that is made. It is well to remember, however, that 
even when home and community influences are not 
favorable, good teachers sometimes succeed marvelously 
well in stimulating their pupils’ will to learn. 
Summary. — We may sum up the evidence in a pro- 
visional way as follows: While capacities for learning 
are doubtless strongly influenced by heredity, and while 
it is true that some persons are “‘born long” mentally 
and that others are ‘‘born short” mentally, it is also 
undeniable that the limits set by heredity are for the 
great majority of people relatively wide. Leaving out 
the extreme cases (the very stupid on the one hand and 
the very bright on the other hand), and considering only 
1 Recall the discussion of this factor in Chapter VI, especially p. 137.  
-P-A-G-E-200
  188 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
the large numbers that lie between the extremes and 
including the remediable cases, it is safe to say of this 
group that they are capable of learning the things 
necessary to a reasonably effective social life and that 
their progress in learning will depend chiefly upon the 
opportunities that are provided for them in the way of 
good schools and good teachers, the stimulus to sys- 
tematic effort which comes from such schools and 
teachers and from the examples set by the home life 
and the community fashion, and the care that is exercised 
in preventing undernourishment, excessive worry, and 
an overplus of exciting distractions. 
If this provisional conclusion suggests that the work 
of the teacher is full of hope, it suggests no less strongly 
that the teacher’s task is far from easy. Even if we leave 
out the extreme cases, the variations among those that 
are left is so wide that the same methods cannot be 
applied with equal success to all, nor can anything 
resembling an identical rate of progress be insured. The 
problem of adaptation still looms large, and some of the 
ways through which adaptation is facilitated may be 
profitably considered at this point. 
Mentrat Acre; THE INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT; THE 
r ACCOMPLISHMENT QUOTIENT 
4 \Mental age. — In adapting the materials of education 
to individuals who vary in their learning-capacities, it is 
often helpful to know how far an individual deviates from 
the norm (that is, from the capacity of the average 
individual). It is now possible to find the amount of 
deviation with reasonable accuracy by determining the
-P-A-G-E-201
  INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES 189 
“mental age” of the individual in question. Psycholo- 
gists have devised mental tests which, they assume, will 
measure ‘‘general intelligence” or general learning- 
capacity. (See above, p. 183.) By applying these tests 
to thousands of individuals, they have established norms 
or standards for each year of age, at least up to sixteen; 
in other words, they have found what score the average 
child eleven years old makes on the test, the score that 
the average twelve-year-old child makes, and so on. 
Having established these norms, they can then apply 
the test to a given individual. Suppose that this indi- 
vidual is twelve years old and makes the average twelve- 
year-old score when tested: he is then said to be ‘‘nor- 
mal”; that is, his “mental age” corresponds with his 
“chronological age.” Another child who is twelve years 
old chronologically may be able to make the score that is 
average for a fourteen-year-old child: it is clear then 
that, while his “chronological age” is only twelve, his 
“mental age” is two years beyond this, or fourteen. 
Still another child twelve years old chronologically 
may be able to make only an eight-year-old score: this 
child’s mental age, then, is only eight although his 
chronological age is twelve. 
Mental age and school progress. — Most children start 
school life at about the same chronological age, — six 
years is the usual beginning age in this country, — but 
The first. distinctive tests of general intelligence were devised by Alfred Binet (1857-1911), a French psychologist. The most notable version of the 
Binet tests is that known as the “Stanford-Binet,” for which Lewis M. 
Terman is chiefly responsible. Dr. Terman (born 1877) has been a professor in Stanford University since 1910 and i is one of the most prominent, leaders in 
the measurement movement. He is the author of The Hygiene of the School 
Child, Houghton Mifflin, 1915, and The Intelligence of School Children, 
Houghton Mifflin, 1919.
-P-A-G-E-202
  199 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
not all of these children, of course, are six years old 
mentally. A few are eight or even nine; a few are four 
or even three; many more are five or seven; while by 
definition a clear majority are ‘‘normal’’ in the sense 
that their mental and chronological ages coincide. 
These differences, as we have seen, may persist through- 
out school life. Often the children with low mental ages 
progress so slowly that they soon become ‘‘retarded,”” — 
that is they fall behind their chronological-age group 
(they ‘‘fall behind their grade”) and do the work with 
younger children. Some of them, however, are kept with 
their classes, and even a sixth-grade or seventh-grade 
group may have pupils of about the same chronological 
age who vary rather widely in their mental ages. If the 
teacher knows the extent of this variation, he or she may 
find this knowledge helpful in adapting the teaching to 
the variation in learning capacity represented by the class. 
The intelligence quotient. — Another way of finding 
how far individuals vary from the norm in learning- 
capacities is by determining the ‘‘intelligence quotient.” 
The principle is precisely the same as in the determina- 
tion of mental age, but the expression is different. The 
intelligence quotient is the ratio of mental age to chrono- 
logical age. If, for example, a child is only nine years 
old mentally but twelye ¢ years old chronologically, his 
intelligence quotient is 9 + 12 or .75 (the decimal is dis- 
regarded for convenience and the quotient expressed as a 
whole number, 75); if he is twelve years old both mentally 
and chronologically his intelligence quotient is 12 + 12, 
or 100; if he is fifteen years old mentally and twelve 
chronologically his intelligence quotient is 15 + 12 or 125.
-P-A-G-E-203
  INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES 191 
The advantage of the intelligence quotient. — The intelli- 
gence quotient, or ‘I. Q.,” as it is familiarly called, has 
the advantage of indicating at once not only whether 
the person is below or above the norm in general learning- 
capacity (assuming that there is such a thing and that 
the tests accurately measure it), but also how far below 
or above the norm his station lies. It is also important 
in giving a ready means for finding how much of a handi- 
cap a teacher has in teaching a given group of pupils. 
If the median (or midmost) pupil of the group has an 
I. Q. of 90, it will mean that a goodly proportion of the 
entire class is below the norm, and one may consequently 
infer that the difficulties of teaching will be greatly 
increased over those encountered by a teacher who has 
a group with a median I. Q. of 115. 
Dangers in an unintelligent use of intelligence quotients. 
— The serious danger involved in the free use of the 
intelligence quotient in schools lies in its character as a 
single and apparently simple index of a person’s mental 
ability. Its numerical form and its very name suggest 
an accuracy and precision which, fortunately or unfortu- 
nately, it does not as yet reflect. The hypothesis of a 
general intelligence or learning-capacity is still only an 
hypothesis; it is not a fully established principle. Most 
psychologists asswme that there is such a thing as general 
intelligence, and they asswme furthermore that this 
factor is both inherited and very little influenced by 
educational’ or other environmental factors. But these 
1 This assumption is open to the most serious question. It has rested upon 
a very interesting chain of reasoning. No intelligence test has been devised 
as yet which measures inherited learning-capacity directly. All tests measure 
acquired capacity, usually by measuring what the individual has actually  
-P-A-G-E-204
192 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
inferences are still assumptions; their validity has not 
as yet been clearly established. It is thoroughly legiti- 
mate to use the “I. Q.” in a supplementary way to help 
the teacher in determining for practical purposes how 
far a pupil deviates from the norm at the time he is 
measured; but it is not legitimate to use this device in 
its present stage of development in such a way that hard 
and fast lines of cleavage will be drawn between pupil- 
groups, and especially in a way that will condemn slow 
learners to restricted educational opportunities because 
of their supposedly meager inherited equipment. 
The accomplishment quotient. — The development of 
the intelligence quotient has led to another device which 
promises, if perfected, to be of very large service in the 
work of teaching. While the mental tests are not as yet 
instruments of precision, there can be no doubt that they 
furnish a fairly dependable index of a pupil’s learning- 
capacities at the time when the tests are given;! in other 
learned. It would seem, then, that the results of the tests (the scores made 
by individuals) must necessarily reflect the opportunities that these individuals. 
have had for learning, — that is, their school opportunities. Most of the 
psychologists have assumed that, if the tests deal with relatively simple 
materials, the opportunities of all individuals who are subjected to the 
tests will have been approximately the same, and consequently that any 
differences that are revealed in scores will be due primarily to differences 
in native or inherited capacity. Undoubtedly this assumption would be 
valid in very rare instances, — for example, when the comparisons have been 
limited to a group of individuals all of whom have had just the same amount 
of schooling under the same teachers and in. the same community, and all 
from equally good homes. It is clear that such conditions are very hard to 
meet. Sometimes it is possible to account for varying school opportunities 
and then to compute what the differences in the scores would be if all factors 
other than native ability were equal; but this, too, can be done only in rare 
instances. It is scarcely to be doubted that the results of intelligence tests 
when applied to very large mixed groups (as in the case of the famous ‘‘ Army 
tests” given to the drafted soldiers of the American Army in the Great War) 
reveal, not differences in native ability, but differences in school opportunity. 
(See an article entitled ‘‘Do Good Schools Pay?” Journal of the National 
Education Association, June, 1923.) 
1 Even with this limitation, it is not well to depend upon a single test, par- 
ticularly a ‘‘group”’ test.  
-P-A-G-E-205
  INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES 193 
words, they indicate, at least roughly, what he will be 
able to do from the standpoint of his present abilities, 
whether these have been inherited or acquired. Taking 
the intelligence quotient based on these tests, then, as 
an index of present ability, the teacher may measure a 
pupil’s progress with reference to the pupil’s ability. If 
he is apparently of moderate ability and still makes good 
progress, one may reasonably conclude that he is invest- 
ing his capital well, although absolutely his progress may 
not be commensurate with that of brighter pupils. On 
the other hand if he happens to be one of the bright 
pupils making high score on the mental tests with a 
resulting high intelligence quotient, and if he then fails 
to progress consistently with his apparent ability, it is 
reasonable to conclude that he is not working up to his 
limit, — although even under these conditions he may 
make more absolute progress than the slower pupil. 
Achievement tests.— The ratio between the actual 
accomplishment of a learner and his learning-capacities 
is called his ‘‘accomplishment quotient.’’ In order to 
compute an accomplishment quotient, we must have 
numerical measures of what he accomplishes in the 
several school studies and definite age-norms with which 
to compare his own accomplishment scores. These 
measures and norms are furnished by the achievement 
tests that have been worked out for the more important 
elementary-school subjects and for some of the high- 
school subjects. The Courtis arithmetic-tests, the 
Thorndike and the Ayres handwriting scales, and the 
Thorndike-McCall tests for silent reading are examples. 
The achievement tests have been “standardized” by 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
    194 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
giving them to thousands of children of different ages 
and grades, so that norms or average scores for each 
chronological age and each school grade are available. 
Computing the accomplishment quotient. — Let us now 
assume a twelve-year-old child whose intelligence quo- 
tient is 115. His accomplishment in arithmetic, however, 
is only the normal accomplishment for a child of his age, 
and hence his arithmetic quotient is only 100. It may 
be assumed, then, that he is not doing work of the high 
quality that his superior ability would lead us to expect for 
his accomplishment quotient in arithmetic is 100 + 115 
or a little less than 87. Theoretically, it would seem 
that an accomplishment quotient could never exceed 
100, but there are on record cases of children whose 
intelligence as measured by the mental tests and recorded 
in I. Q.’s is only moderate, but whose accomplishment 
has notably surpassed their assumed abilities. As one 
writer has expressed it, ‘‘So well have the teachers in- 
vested the intellectual capital of these children that the 
interest actually exceeds the principal.’’! 
How the accomplishment quotient may help teachers. 
— The development of the accomplishment quotient is 
especially promising for two reasons: 
(a) It may be used as an incentive to encourage pupils 
to work to the maximum of their ability. Heretofore, 
bright pupils often have not had such an incentive. They 
could easily ‘“‘keep up’ with, or even surpass, their 
slower fellows and still themselves do very little work; 
but if their progress is measured in terms of their own 
1 Crrit Burt: Mental and Scholastic Tests, p. 176. London County Council, 
1921.
-P-A-G-E-207
  INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES 195 
superior abilities, it is clear that the tables may be 
turned. Again, the slow pupil has been in the past under 
a most serious and depressing handicap, for he has been 
penalized for failure to achieve ends that he could, in 
many cases, never achieve short of a miracle. If the 
accomplishment quotient can do something to prevent 
these two types of tragedy, it will be a boon and a 
blessing. 
(b) It is believed, too, that the development of the 
accomplishment quotient may make it possible to eval- 
uate much more justly than has hitherto been possible 
the work done by the teacher. Obviously a teacher with 
a bright group of pupils will, other things being equal, 
make a much better showing than will a teacher to whom 
fate has assigned a class of dullards. If teachers are to 
be judged by the actual growth that they stimulate in 
their pupils, then clearly the factor of the pupil’s initial 
abilities should be taken into account. The refinement 
of the accomplishment quotient may make this possible. 
Segregated groups based upon learning-capacities. — 
Even before tests were devised for measuring either 
learning-capacities or progress in learning, some schools 
made it a practice to group pupils according to their 
abilities and to let these segregated groups work at the 
rate best fitted to their powers. Since the development 
of tests, the segregation of the very slow learners has 
become general in the larger school systems of the towns 
and cities. Separate “opportunity” rooms are provided 
for these special classes, and teachers are employed for 
them who have been especially trained to deal with the 
difficult problems that such work involves. More
-P-A-G-E-208
    196 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
recently, a movement has been started to provide 
segregated quarters and special treatment for the un- 
usually bright or “gifted” children. It is maintained 
that such children need special treatment just as much 
as, if not more than, their dull fellows: — (a) because 
the very bright child may acquire habits of laziness and 
attitudes of superiority when grouped with average chil- 
dren whom he can surpass without effort; and (6) 
because from these groups of gifted children will prob- 
ably come the influential leaders of the next generation, 
and special opportunities given to such a group may 
consequently be a social investment that will yield 
dividends far greater than the social return that comes 
from similar opportunities given to average or dull 
children.! 
Problems involved in segregation on the basis of general 
intelligence. — The questions of policy involved in the 
segregation of pupils on the basis of their learning- 
abilities are both numerous and perplexing. There can 
be no doubt that the segregation of very slow learners 
has on the whole worked to the benefit both of the 
segregated pupils and of those who remained in the 
regular classrooms. Whether from this latter group it 
would be well now to remove the brighter pupils is a 
question upon which the opinions of teachers vary 
widely. In any case, the movement is going forward 
slowly at present, — and happily it is going forward on 
a careful experimental basis. Within a few years, both

M. Whipple (born 1876), who has been one of the pioneer students of mental 
and educational measurements. Dr. Whipple is now a professor in the

versity and with the University of Illinois.

the advantages and the dangers involved in the proposal 
will be clearly revealed, and when that time comes the 
question of the general adoption of the plan can be 
settled without prejudice.' 
OrHerR Ways or Apaptina Tracuine To INDIVIDUAL 
DIFFERENCES 
Emphasis upon individual treatment. — Even if it be 
found advisable to organize in segregated groups the 
pupils who resemble one another in their learning 
capacities, the teacher’s problem of adapting his materials 
to individual needs and abilities will not by this 
procedure alone be entirely solved. No matter how 
homogeneous or uniform the individual members of a 
segregated group may seem to be at the outset, every 
individual will remain (and from the point of view of 
the teacher should remain) an individual. 
Extreme individual treatment.— The most extreme 
proposals for solving the problem have contemplated 
an almost complete abandonment of the usual group- 
organization of pupils (in ‘‘classes”’), and the giving of 
all, or practically all, of the instruction and training on 
a strictly individual basis. In many ways, this is not a 
new proposal, for the lower schools until well on in the 
nineteenth century? gave little except individual instruc- 
1 As this book goes to press, a number of careful investigations are reported 
in the Tweniy-third Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Educa- 
tion. The results of these investigations, as summarized by Professor Free- 
man, suggest the provisional inference that the segregation of bright pupils is 
not desirable.

be dated from 1680, when the plan was introduced into the schools of the 
Christian Brethren by Father LaSalle of Rheims, the founder of this Society.

but it did not supersede individual instruction generally until well on in the 
nineteenth century. Cf. J. Lanpon: School Management, p. 151. Osgood, 1884.

tion — the master sitting at his desk, and the pupils 
coming to him one|at a time to ‘‘recite.” The organiza- 
tion of pupils in classes and the development of a tech- 
nique of ‘simultaneous’ instruction were greatly 
stimulated by the development of universal primary 
education and the consequent need of taking care of 
large numbers of pupils without unduly increasing the 
teaching staff. But ‘‘simultaneous”’ instruction, while 
it has certain virtues in addition to its economy, has also 
a marked disadvantage in that it tends to treat all learn- 
ers as though their needs and capacities were the same. 
Combined with the grading system) (which in American 
urban schools dates from about the middle of the nine- 
teenth century), it brought about a deadening uniformity 
of progress which has been stigmatized by the phrase, 
the “‘lockstep of the schools.”! All pupils, irrespective 
of their capacities, tended to progress at the same rate, 
which usually meant a pace that could be sustained by 
most of those in the slower half of the group. 
The modern movement toward a return to the older 
mode of individual instruction as a means of ‘breaking 
the lockstep” dates from about 1890. It has found a 
definite expression in a series of proposals and systems. 
Among the earlier of these were the ‘‘Pueblo Plan’’? and 
1 The evil has never been so pronounced in the one-teacher rural schools 
as in the graded schools of the towns and cities, for the classes in the one- 
teacher schools will necessarily be small, and the conditions of individual in- 
struction are more closely approximated. This virtue has frequently been 
emphasized by those who wish to retain the isolated open-country school. 
However important the virtue may be, however, it clearly does not compen- 
sate for the disadvantages which the ungraded school presents. 
2 The Pueblo plan was organized by Preston W. Search (born 1853), who 
deserves especial credit for the forceful way in which he called attention to 
the evils of the class system. He established a system of individual instruc- 
tion in the schools of Pueblo, Colorado, in the early nineties, and published a 
widely read account of the experiment in his book, The Ideal School, Apple- 
ton, 1901.

the “Batavia System.”! At the present time, typical 
and important expressions of the movement are found in 
the work that has been undertaken by Dr. Frederic 
Burk? in the San Francisco Teachers College, and in 
two very interesting systems known respectively as the 
“Winnetka Plan’ * and the “Dalton Plan.’’ 4 
The essential feature of the present-day proposals 
for individual instruction (especially the Dalton and 
Winnetka plans) is the very careful preparation of 
printed assignments or sets of directions by means of 
which the individual pupil can master the materials at 
1The Batavia system attempted to combine class and individual instruc- 
tion in a novel and in many ways a successful fashion. It was organized 
by John Kennedy, Superintendent of Schools in Batavia, New York, in 1898. 
An account of it will be found in W. C. Bagley’s Classroom Management, 
Macmillan, 1907, ch. xiv. 
2 Frederic Burk (1863-1924) was president of the San Francisco State 
Teachers College from 1899 until his death. He was one of the most active and 
vigorous proponents of individual instruction. In the Journal of the National 
Education Association, April, 1924, after telling of the unsatisfactory results 
that were obtained in his training-school by the class system, he says: “We 
undertook to remedy matters by announcing that thereafter no lessons would 
be prescribed; each would pursue his own lessons and proceed at his own rate. 
The result was electrifying.... Even the poorest pupils, practically, 
maintained the former class rate at least. The large majority went much 
faster, covering two, three, four and five times the amount of work by the 
class rate.” 
3 Organized by C. W. Washburne, a former student of Dr. Burk and now 
superintendent of schools at Winnetka, Illinois. Mr. Washburne’s experiment 
has been particularly notable in connection with the working out on a scien- 
tific basis of the minimal essentials that should constitute the curriculum of 
all pupils, and the organization of these materials in a form that permits 
individual mastery. 
4The Dalton plan came into prominence at about the same time as did 
the Winnetka plan. Miss Helen Parkhurst first put the plan in operation in 
the schools of Dalton, Massachusetts. She, too, was strongly influenced by 
the teachings of Dr. Burk, and also by the work of Dr. Maria Montessori 
(an Italian anthropologist who invented several devices for teaching young 
children, and who projected a general theory of education which had a wide- 
spread but temporary vogue). Miss Parkhurst’s work attracted the atten- 
tion of European educators, and has been extensively adopted in England. 
The essential feature of the plan is the careful organization of materials in 
series of individual assignments or ‘‘jobs’’ which the pupils undertake or 
“contract”? to complete. Each pupil works at his own rate, conferring 
with the teacher whenever necessary, and passing to ou succeeding “job” 
after its predecessor has been approved.

his own pace.!' The teacher’s time is then free for the 
giving of such individual help as may be needed. 
Adaptive possibilities in the technique of teaching. — 
It should not be inferred, however, that those who 
have not advocated extreme individual instruction have 
been blind to the evils of the class system. Most of the 
principles, precepts, and practices that have been 
gradually accumulated in the experience of success- 
ful teachers during the past century are explicitly di- 
rected toward a correction of these evils, — toward 
a better provision for adapting materials to indi- 
vidual capacities. It is not within the province of 
this introductory book to set forth in detail these prin- 
ciples and suggestions, for their mastery forms a most 
important part of the training which the prospective 
teacher will follow in the professional school, and a rich . 
literature is already available to supplement or comple- 
ment that training. A very brief reference may here be 
made, however, to some of the topics which the much 
more intensive and detailed study of the ‘‘art of teach- 
ing,” the ‘‘technique of teaching,” and the ‘‘ principles of 
teaching”’ will involve, especially in connection with the 
basic problem of adapting materials to individual learn- 
ing-capacities. This preliminary view of the practical art 
of tedching may be best gained perhaps by a brief con- 
sideration of the general plan or ‘‘pattern” of classroom 
procedure as this has been developed in American schools. 
The class unit. — The umit of the teacher’s work may 
be thought of as the task involved in teaching a group 
1 It is interesting to note that this method of instruction has been generally 
employed in the private “business colleges” of this country for forty years 
or more. 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES 201 
of from twenty to forty pupils in a single subject through. 
a single class period. It is convenient to discuss classroom 
procedure in terms of this unit. Indeed, the organization 
and conduct of this unit typify American public education 
as it is carried on by hundreds of thousands of teachers. 
and as it affects millions of boys and girls. They thus 
constitute a general ‘“‘pattern” of classroom procedure. 
Two important factors in the evolution of the prevailing 
“nattern” of classroom procedure. — Two basic factors 
have determined the main outlines of this organization. 
(1) The Textbook. — The first of these is the large 
place that the textbook has come to occupy in American 
education. The increase of numbers of pupils to be 
taught has always outrun the supply of adequately 
trained teachers, and to enable relatively untrained 
teachers to do school work, the materials of teaching 
have been embodied in textbooks that are placed in the 
pupils’ hands, and which both furnish the subject-matter 
to the pupils and supply a guide for the teacher. This 
emphasis of textbook instruction, which has grown out 
of the actual needs of the situation, has led to many evils 
which will be referred to later in this book and which the 
student will be guarded against throughout his period 
of training; but it has also had its advantages, — so 
many of these, indeed, that textbooks would probably 
continue to have an important place in the schools even 
if the time should come when all teachers are well pre- 
pared for their work. 
(2) Self-activity. — The chief value in the emphasis. 
that has been given to the textbook lies in the demands 
that it makes on the independent effort of the learner.
-P-A-G-E-214
: 
202 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Thus out of a dire necessity has grown a positive virtue. 
Almost from the outset, the pupil for a part of his learn- 
ing has been thrown somewhat on his own resources. 
Crude and unwieldy as it has been, then, the organization 
of the American classroom has, in a unique fashion, 
reflected the fundamental principle of self-activity. In- 
effective as our school work has been and still is in many 
respects, it has emphasized in its typical organization! 
what we referred to in Chapter II of this book as the 
‘primary condition of all learning, — namely, the active, 
mental effort of the learner himself.” | 
The three-fold division of classroom exercises. — Let us’ 
see how this organization expresses itself in the actual 
conduct of a class: The typical classroom exercise falls 
into three parts: (1) the assignment of the “lesson”; 
(2) the independent work or study of the pupils in “pre- 
paring”’ the lesson; (3) the recitation or group meeting 
for testing the effectiveness of the pupils’ preparation 
and for discussing the results of the learning. This form 
or pattern of procedure, be it remembered, grew out of the 
imperative necessity for using textbooks; it was a 
“technique” developed in practice for using textbooks 
effectively; and yet it has within it the germ of a funda- 
mental procedure which would persist even if textbooks 
as we now know them were entirely abandoned. Of far 
more significance to our present problem, however, is 
the fact that the refinement of this technique has already 
done much to overcome many of the difficulties involved 
in adapting teaching-materials to individual needs and 
capacities. A very brief reference may be made to these 
1See p. 33. , 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES 203 
refinements in connection with each of the three large 
divisions of the general plan or pattern: 
(1) The assignment. — The word ‘‘assignment”’ once 
referred exclusively to the materials that were “‘set”’ for 
the following lesson; the assignment might be the “next 
ten words in the spelling-book,”’ the ‘‘long-division prob- 
lems on such-and-such pages,” the ‘‘next chapter’ in 
the history textbook, the sentences to be analyzed in 
grammar, the sections of ‘‘Caesar”’ to be translated, or 
what not. As teachers came to study the problems in-_ 
volved in their work they found that an important phase 
of teaching is concerned with the way in which lessons 
are assigned. The assignment, instead of referring ex- | 
clusively to the materials of the ‘‘next lesson’? came to 
be recognized as a process of teaching, and to-day one 
of the accepted tests of good teaching is the way in 
which the teacher handles the assignment. It has been: 
found by actual experiment that the efficiency of the 
teacher’s work in many cases can be greatly increased 
merely by taking account of this factor. 
We shall not dwell here upon the various functions of. . 
the assignment or upon the technique by means of which 
these functions can be discharged. It is with the way 
in which the assignment may be used to solve the prob- 
lems of adaptation that we are now concerned. Among 
the practices that have specific reference to this problem 
may be mentioned: (a) the giving of individual assign- 
ments! in addition to the general class assignment; 
(b) the provision of growp assignments 2? whereby specific

problems are delegated to two or more pupils who then 
work together on their solution and report their find- 
ings for the benefit of the class as a whole; and 
(c) the provision of minimal and maximal assignments, 
whereby a certain amount of work is expected from 
all members of the class, while additional work is pro- 
vided for those who are able to accomplish more than 
the minimum. 
(2) Training in the art of study.— Perhaps the 
greatest progress in adapting materials to individual 
capacities has been made through the development of 
methods for teaching pupils how to study. This need 
was recognized very early in the development of Ameri- 
can education, but effective means of meeting the need 
have been a relatively recent development. Thirty 
years ago, Professor B. A. Hinsdale,? in a very helpful 
book called The Art of Study, made a number of sugges- 
tions toward the solution of the problem, one of the most 
important of which pointed out (the value of setting 
aside definite class periods during which teacher and 
pupils would study a lesson together.) At such times the 
teacher could not only give instruction. in the art of 
study but also acquaint himself with the difficulties that 
individual pupils met in the effort to master the mate- 
rials. The interest in the problem of study was greatly 
stimulated a few years ago by the work of Professor 
1 This distinction was first clearly pointed out by Miss Mabel Simpson in 
her Supervised Study in History, especially pp. 12-13, 48-49, 74-75. Mac- millan, 1918. 
2 Burke Aaron Hinsdale (1837-1900) was a prominent American teacher 
and student of education during the latter half of the nineteenth century. 
‘As a student and an instructor in Hiram College (Ohio) he was intimately associated with James A. Garfield. Later he became Professor of the Science 
and Art of Teaching in the University of Michigan.

Frank M. MeMurry,! who published in 1909 his book, 
How to Study and Teaching How to Study. This book set 
forth a definite technique of study which had a profound 
influence on the development that followed. One of the 
early fruits of this development was the recognition of 
the value of supervised or directed study as a means cf 
supplementing class instruction and as a means/es- 
pecially of adapting instruction to the varying capacities 
of individual learners.) Numerous investigations and 
a considerable literature? have centered about the study 
problem, and while a great deal of careful work still 
remains to be done before the complicated problems 
involved are satisfactorily solved, it is none the less true 
that a most promising beginning has been made. 
(3) Improvements in the recitation. — Improvements 
in the technique of the recitation have also con- 
tributed something toward the solution of the difficult 
problem under discussion, — the problem of adapting 
materials to varying capacities. In its earlier stages 
of development, the recitation was merely what its name 
signifies, —a “‘recital’’ by the pupils of the materials 
learned. It was a testing rather than a teaching exercise, 
1 Frank Morton McMurry (born 1862) has been for twenty-five years one 
of the best known American teachers. His earlier work was in the Illinois 
State Normal University. Since 1898 he has been Professor of Elementary 
Education in Teachers College, Columbia University. He is the author of 
several important books for teachers, including How to Study and Teaching 
How to Study, Houghton Mifflin, 1909, and Elementary School Standards, 
World Book Co., 1912.

  206 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
and because of the heavy premium placed upon an ac- 
curate reproduction of the learned materials it en- 
couraged rote-learning or memorizing words with little 
reference to their meaning. Conscientious teachers 
recognized this evil, but how to prevent it and at the 
same time insure an adequate mastery of the subjects 
studied was another matter. 
One of the first steps toward the solution of this prob- 
lem was an effort to get pupils to “recite,” not in the 
“words of the book,” but in ‘‘their own words.” This 
seems to be a rather trifling change, but its effect was 
profound. Gradually the recitation as conducted by 
good teachers lost much of its stiffness and formality, 
and was transformed into a far more informal or conver- 
sational discussion of the lesson-materials. No longer 
satisfied with the parrot-like repetition of memorized 
words, the teachers asked searching questions which 
would reveal whether the pupils actually understood 
what they were talking about. Difficulties in the way 
of such understanding were revealed by this process, 
and the teachers were then in a position to explain and 
amplify the textbook materials, and even to take especial 
pains in the assignment of lessons to clear up some of the 
difficulties in the way of understanding that would other- 
wise tempt pupils to memorize without comprehending 
the meaning of what they learned. A technique of 
questioning as a means of promoting a real mastery of 
materials became more and more clearly recognized. 
The ‘Socialized Recitation.”” — The many detailed 
stages in the development that followed cannot be set 
forth here. It is sufficient for our present purposes to
-P-A-G-E-219
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES 207 
point out that the important tendency in the develop- 
ment of the recitation has been toward the recognition 
of the class or pupil-group as a social organization rather 
than as a mass, or a mere aggregation, of individuals. 
In the best schools to-day, the class represents a company 
of. learners. More and more the teacher is happily losing 
his traditional character as a taskmaster, and is taking 
on the far more effective qualities of a companion, a 
leader, and a guide. The attitude of both teacher and 
pupils has undergone a fundamental change, and this 
change in attitude has meant a corresponding change in 
the spirit and morale of the classroom. Not all can do 
the same amount of work; not all can do the same work; 
but each can do something that will be of value to the 
group asa whole. A fundamental virtue of the ‘socialized 
recitation” lies in the recognition that it gives to individual 
differences and capacities. Each pupil contributes in 
proportion to his ability, and a most significant task of 
the teacher is to study each individual to find just what 
he can contribute, and how through this contribution 
his growth may be best assured. 
Summary. — It may be concluded, then, that much 
ean be done to adapt teaching-materials to individual 
differences in needs and capacities even if pupils are not 
segregated on the basis of such capacities. Much can 
be done, also, without surrendering the obvious social 
values that inhere in class instruction, and returning to 
the older mode of individual instruction. The technique 
that has been developed in the evolution of the typical 
pattern of classroom procedure provides one answer to 
the problem of individual differences. .

  208 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Quzstions, Exercises, AND PROBLEMS 
1. Select two pupils in the same class (preferably in one of the 
lower grades) for observation as to their learning capacities. Note 
particularly differences in the ability of the two to learn the same 
subjects and in the ability of each with different subjects. Note the 
different ways in which the teacher treats the two pupils. 
2. Observe three or four successive lessons given to a class. As you 
observe try to rate each pupil as a “quick learner,” an “average 
learner,” or a “slow learner.” After completing the observations, 
make a classification of the pupils on these three bases. If you 
have observed them in different subjects, note whether they have 
the same relative rank in each. Note any variations in the ratings 
from day to day. If possible, have the teacher check your ratings, 
and try to discover the reasons for any misplacements that you may 
have made. 
3. Compare three standard tests of general intelligence (such as 
the Stanford revision of the Binet tests, the Otis group tests, and 
the Army “Alpha” tests). Study typical questions presented in the 
tests and try to determine what kinds of mental ability each measures. 
Which seems to you to be the best of the three tests and why? 
Make a list of the characteristics that in your judgment a good test 
of “general intelligence” should represent. 
4, Make a study of the ways in which a good teacher whom you 
may have the opportunity to observe adapts instruction to indi- 
vidual capacities (1) in assigning lessons, (2) in directing or super- 
vising study, (3) in conducting recitations, and (4) in other ways.

problems involved in the measurement of intelligence turn first to 
books and articles that have been prepared for the general reader 
rather than to the technical literature of the field. A start may well

Cuapter IX 
THE OUTCOMES OF TEACHING AND 
LEARNING 
Problem of the chapter. — In discussing the materials 
of education (Chapters III-V), it was pointed out that 
they owe their significance very largely to the fact that 
they crystallize the important results of human experi- 
ence. They constitute the various ways in which man 
has transcended nature (p. 178) by building up “controls” 
of conduct differing essentially from the instinctive con- 
trols that determine the behavior of the lower animals. 
It is especially important that the various outcomes of 
teaching in stimulating learning be classified with respect 
to the ways in which these outcomes affect conduct or 
behavior, — in which they develop effective “controls” 
of conduct. Certain terms which are often used in the 
discussion of educational problems and which represent 
the outcomes of teaching and learning have appeared 
frequently in the preceding discussions, — such terms| 
as habits, skills, ideas, ideals, and attitudes. It is neces- 
sary to consider in some detail the differences among 
these outcomes and the ways in which the materials} 
of education can be made to engender them.        
          
       
        Tue Distinction Between ‘“FIxep” AND 
“ ADAPTIVE”’ CONTROLS 
At the outset a very important distinction divides th 
controls of conduct into two great groups which may b 
210
-P-A-G-E-223
OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 211 
called for convenience, the “fixed” and the “adaptive” 
controls. The two groups, as we shall see, have impor- 
tant interrelations, and each has a bearing upon the 
development of the other, but it is important to distin- 
guish between them because some basic educational 
principles follow from this distinction. 
The economy of establishing fixed responses to re- 
current situations. —It is clear that there are certain 
types of conduct the significance of which to civilized 
life is persistent or at least relatively unchanging. We 
may safely predict that the children who are in our 
American schools to-day will need in their adult life to 
use the English language with a reasonable degree of 
fluency, precision, and grammatical correctness. We 
may predict that they will need to write legibly and to 
spell correctly the words that are commonly employed 
in communicating ideas; that they will need a fair mas- 
tery of the arts of computation; that they will need 
habits of clean living and wholesome exercise. 
For special groups, other needs may be predicted. 
Those who become farmers will need specific skills con- 
cerned with the cultivation of the soil and the care and 
breeding of animals; those who become machinists, car- 
penters, or masons will need other specific skills some of 
which are not likely to change very much within the next 
few generations; and the same is true of other specialized 
groups. These groups need not detain us at the present 
time, however, for this book is concerned chiefly with 
the education that is common to all rather than with the 
specific education of different occupational groups. 
The point is that, even in the former type of education, 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
    212 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
there are specific and definite situations, needs, and’ re< 
lationships that all children will meet in later life and 
for which the school can prepare them in very specific 
and definite ways. 
The equal need of adaptive controls. — On the other 
hand, there is no fact more clearly obvious than that the 
conditions of civilized life are continually changing. We 
have already referred to the fundamental changes that 
the Industrial Revolution brought about (pp. 110 ff.) and 
to the changes that are now going on under the stimulus 
of the ‘‘ideal of progress”’ (pp. 145 ff.). Social, political, 
industrial, and even hygienic conditions are in a constant 
flux. New situations are continually arising for which 
existing solutions are quite inadequate. Scientific dis- 
coveries are made which, almost overnight, render our 
older scientific information obsolete and inadequate. 
New inventions compel us to send our old machinery to 
the scrap-heap, — and along with the machines must 
often go the skills that were laboriously developed for 
operating them. A great war in another part of the 
world shakes our own political structure to the very 
foundations, and necessitates a reconstruction of some 
of our most deeply-rooted conceptions. All this is of 
the very essence of civilization. Education, which has 
aimed to prepare the young for the responsibilities of 
adult life, has itself been an important factor in prevent- 
ing the static and unchanging condition which would 
greatly simplify its problems. The very flux and change 
which it has played a large part in bringing about 
multiplies a thousandfold the difficulties that its work 
involves.
-P-A-G-E-225
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 213) 
The school faces, then, what seems to be at first glance 
an impossible task: it must prepare each generation for 
the solution of problems that cannot now be foreseen. 
But the task, while difficult enough, is not entirely insur- 
mountable. Not only can the school fix specific and 
definite controls of conduct that will enable the learner 
to meet the unchanging and persistent situations of life, 
but it may do much to make him far more adaptable to 
new and unpredictable situations than he would other- 
wise be. In other words, there are certain outcomes of 
teaching that are essentially fixed outcomes; there are 
other outcomes that are essentially adaptive in their 
character and in the influence that they exert. 
A. Harts AND SKILLS AS Frxep OuTCoMES 
Habits as specific responses to recurring situations. — 
A specific habit is an automatic or mechanical association 
between a stimulus and a response that has been acquired 
through experience. It is entirely analogous to the sim- 
ple inherited responses that are called ‘‘reflex”” move- 
ments, but unlike the latter it has been learned and not 
inherited. 
Illustrations of specific habits.—'The work of the 
elementary school fairly bristles with these specific 
habits. When a child learns that six sevens are forty- 
two, and then through repetition makes this association 
or connection or ‘‘bond”’ so thoroughly automatic that, 
whenever the stimulus ‘‘six sevens” is given, the response 
“forty-two” is  instantaneous—coming without 
thought or reflection, without the slightest temptation 
to say forty-one or forth-three or any other number ex-
-P-A-G-E-226
  214 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
cept forty-two — then a specific habit has been formed, 
and a very definite ‘‘control” of conduct has been 
established. When one learns how to spell a difficult 
word like ‘‘believe” or “‘receive” and then through 
repetition reaches the point where the word ‘‘leaps” from 
the pen, so to speak, without involving on the part of the 
writer a conscious effort to determine whether the i comes 
before the e or the e before the 7, another specific habit 
has been formed, another ‘‘control’’ of conduct estab- 
lished. When one learns to use the future auxiliary forms 
correctly, — to say, without consciously debating about 
the matter, ‘‘I shall” and “We shall,” ‘You will” and 
“He will” and ‘‘They will” when simple futurity is 
implied and to use the converse forms when deliberate 
intent is to be expressed, — still other specific habits 
have been formed. 
These illustrations are typical of a large number of 
habit outcomes that the elementary-school teacher seeks 
to establish. The aim of his effort is the permanent fixa- 
tion of very specific associations or bonds. In the cases 
just cited, the associations are linguistic, but there are, 
of course, innumerable habit-responses that are not con- 
cerned with the association of words or of the ideas that 
lie back of words. Some of these, also, are significant in 
school work. Habits of good posture in sitting and stand- 
ing are especially important in this connection, and the 
difficulty of establishing such habits without at the same 
time imposing a ‘‘wooden”’ stiffness upon the classroom 
becomes a serious problem. More and more, too, the 
school is coming to concern itself with the health-habits 
of the pupils outside of the school. As was pointed out
-P-A-G-E-227
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 215 
in an earlier section (p. 124), the aim of health teaching 
is to insure the living of a healthy life, and this means 
above all the early formation of health-habits. To brush 
the teeth at stated intervals and in the right way; to 
open the window before going to bed; to chew food 
thoroughly; to bathe frequently and at definite times; 
— these are only a few of the types of conduct for which 
“habit-controls” must be established. 
Important, too, are the little automatic responses that, 
when added together, constitute so important a part of 
one’s equipment in ‘‘manners.” That a boy should 
stand aside to let a woman or an older person pass first 
through the doorway; that he should take off his hat 
when greeted by a woman or an elderly man; that he 
should listen attentively to what others are saying and 
express his own opinions without rudely interrupting 
them: these are assuredly among the things of persisting 
value in a changing world. It is true that they should be 
something more than habits, but it is also true that 
unless they are habits first it is not likely that they will 
ever be anything more. 
The distinction between habits and skills. — The 
difference between habits and skills is chiefly the differ- 
ence between relative simplicity and relative complexity. 
Skills may be thought of as more or less elaborate com- 
binations of specific habits. In learning to drive an auto- 
mobile, for example, one must consciously master a large 
number of separate movements. Each of these may be 
considered as a specific habit. Some are very simple and 
easily learned, such as pressing the foot on the brake; 
others are more difficult, such as passing from “low”
-P-A-G-E-228
  216 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
through “intermediate” to ‘‘high.’’ Most persons who 
learn this art undergo a period of distinct discomfort. 
They must make each movement consciously and care- 
fully, and after the specific movements have been 
mastered, they must continue the period of conscious 
direction while the simple or “‘lower-order”’ habits are 
being combined into complex or “higher-order "habits. 
Gradually, however, the connections become fixed; the 
whole chain of adjustments is completely mechanized; 
the ‘‘skill” has been acquired. 
The ‘‘skill” subjects. — In the elementary school, such 
subjects as reading, writing, drawing, manual training, 
and the household arts are essentially ‘‘skill” subjects, 
and an important field of educational investigation is to 
determine by careful experiment just what skills are 
essential and how best to teach these skills. The history 
of the methods of teaching reading illustrates clearly the 
need for such investigations. Should the smaller habits 
be formed one at a time and then combined, or should 
larger skill units be attacked at the outset? Should the 
“unit” in beginning reading be the letter (the ‘“‘alpha- 
betic’’ method), the sound of letters and combinations of 
letters (the ‘‘phonic” method), the word (the “word” 
method), or the complete sentence (the ‘‘sentence” 
method)? Controversy has raged rife over the alleged 
virtues and defects of these methods, but of late the 
whole problem has been attacked from the objective 
and scientific point of view, and marked progress has 
been made particularly in determining the number and 
kind of specific habits involved in the complex reading 
skills. Handwriting has been similarly analyzed into its

component habit-elements, and the best methods of 
combining these elements into the requisite skills are 
being carefully studied.* 
The habit and skill elements in arithmetic have also 
been subjected to careful scientific investigation with 
the result that the teaching of arithmetic in the elemen- 
tary schools is far more effective to-day than it has ever 
been in the past.2- A promising beginning has been made, 
too, in determining the habit elements and skill combina- 
tions that are important in effective oral and written 
composition.* 
The practice curve. — Before scientific investigation 
attacked seriously the problems involved in the skill 
subjects of the elementary school, a great deal of good 
work had been done in the study of the acquisition of 
skills in such fields as telegraphy and typewriting. 
Among the important results of this study was the plot- 
ting of the typical “practice curve” or the “‘curve of 
learning” in the mastery of skills. As will be noted in the 
graph (Figure 1), progress in learning a skill is relatively 
rapid at the outset, but sooner or later growth becomes

has been an important part of the work of the School of Education of the 
University of Chicago. These investigations have been stimulated by Charles 
H. Judd (born 1873), formerly a professor of psychology in Yale University; 
since 1909 director of the School of Education of the University of Chicago; 
anda most influential advocate of the scientific method as a means of solving 
educational problems. Especially significant have been the investigations 
of Dr. Judd and Dr. William S. Gray (born 1885) in the field of reading, and 
those of Dr. Frank N. Freeman (born 1880) in the field of handwriting. 
2 The pioneers in the scientific study of arithmetic have been Stuart A. 
Courtis (born 1876), who for a long time has been connected with the public 
schools of Detroit, and who now also has a chair in the University of Michigan, 
and Edward L. Thorndike (see footnote, p. 149). 
3 Of outstanding importance is the work of Werrett Wallace Charters 
(born 1873), for many years dean of the School of Education, University of 
Missouri, later of the University of Illinois, and still more recently of the 
Carne Institute of Technology at Pittsburgh and the University of Pitts- 
burgh.

more gradual until finally the curve “flattens out”; that 
is, further practice produces little or no perceptible im- 
provement. Of especial importance, however, is the fact 
that the upward trend of the curve is not uniform, but 
rather broken by periods when no progress is made or

when the learner actually reverts to a lower level of 
performance. When these periods are somewhat ex- 
tended in time, they are known technically as “plateaus,” 
and a lively discussion has arisen as to their significance. 
Some students of the problem believe that they represent 
the successive stages of forming ‘‘lower-order” habits 
(p. 216) into ‘‘higher-order”’ habits, and are inclined to
-P-A-G-E-231
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 219 
consider the plateau an inevitable accompaniment of 
successful learning. Others look upon them as due 
chiefly to fatigue, tedium, lack of interest, or lack of 
motive, and are inclined to believe that, with proper 
guidance, the plateaus could be greatly reduced in num- 
ber and perhaps entirely eliminated. The question is 
important to education because the plateau periods are 
extremely discouraging to the learner; many persons, 
indeed, who start out valiantly to master a complicated 
art give up in the earlier stages because it seems to them 
impossible to make further progress. ! 
The “drill lesson.””— An important result of the 
recognition of habits and skills as specific outcomes of 
teaching has been the refinement of a special technique 
for the class exercises that aim to develop skills. This 
technique involves five principles: 
(1) Motivation. — It is generally agreed that the task 
of forming a habit or a skill should have behind it a strong 
desire on the part of the learner to master the process; 
hence, it is considered good practice to spend some time 
in showing the learner why the habit or the skill is im- 
portant, how it will help in meeting and solving the 
problems that he will face, — in short doing everything 
that can be done to provide a motive for (or motivate) 
the sustained effort that is necessary to mastery.* 
1The best known name connected with the early study of the practice 
curve is that of William Lowe Bryan (born 1860), who in 1897 published, in 
collaboration with N. Harter, a penetrating study of the processes involved 
in ledrning telegraphy. Dr. Bryan has been since 1902 president of Indiana 
University. Other well known students of the problem are Edgar J. Swift 
(born 1860), a professor in Washington University, St. Louis, and William F. 
Book (born 1872), now an official in the State Department of Public Instruc- 
tion of Indiana. ° 
2 The importance of motivation extends, of course, to other types of learn- 
ing. What may be called the “doctrine of motivation” has been set forth in 
 
-P-A-G-E-232

220 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
(2) Focalization. — We have already seen (Chapter 
IJ) that learning normally involves getting first of all a 
clear idea of what is to be learned. While habits and 
skills operate with little conscious guidance, this does not

mean that conscious direction and guidance are not 
necessary in their establishment. Far from it. The more 
clearly the learner sees ‘‘in his mind’s eye”’ the new ad- 
justment that he is to learn, the more quickly (other 
detail in H. B. and G. M. Wilson’s Motivation of School Work, Houghton Mif- 
flin, 1916. Harry B. Wilson (born 1874) has been superintendent of schools in, 
Berkeley, California, since 1918. Guy M. Wilson (born 1876) was for several 
years associated with the Iowa State College, and is now a professor in Boston 
University. The graph (Fig. 2) is from a study by J.C. Chapman and R. B.

things equal) will he master it. Good teachers, then, 
make it a point very clearly to demonstrate or illustrate 
a new skill. They try to fix the attention of the learner 
upon the essential elements; this is referred to as 
“focalization,” or bringing the essential elements of the 
process into the focus of consciousness. The “assign- 
ment’’ (p. 203) of a drill lesson is frequently devoted to 
the two problems of motivating and focalizing the new 
process. 
In assigning a spelling lesson, for exathple, the teacher may first 
refer to the meaning and significance of the new words, calling 
attention perhaps to the fact that these words have been misspelled 
in the previous written work of the pupils, or in other ways arousing 
interest in (“motivating”) the new lesson. The correct form (not 
the misspelled form!) of each word is then carefully considered, 
with especial emphasis upon the letter-combinations that ordinarily 
cause confusion (the first a in separate, for example, or the place 
where the / is doubled in parallel). Similarly, in a writing exercise, 
the appropriate movements may be focalized by careful demonstra- 
tion, the teacher having the pupils follow his movements as he 
writes the letter or the word on the blackboard. 
(3) Attentive repetition. — Another important phase 
of habit-building is repetition or practice. Generally 
speaking it is only through repeated practice that the 
habit-bonds can be firmly fixed. From the teacher’s 
point of view, the difficulties in forming habit are largely 
concentrated here. Repetition tends inevitably to be- 
come monotonous, and the normal mind of childhood 
abhors monotony as nature abhors a vacuum. Further- 
more, listless and perfunctory repetition may be even 
worse than no repetition at all, for when interest flags, 
attention is likely to be distracted, carelessness results, 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
errors creep in, and a cumbrous, ineffective habit is 
likely to result. It becomes a serious problem, then, to 
insure not only continued repetitions but careful and 
attentive repetitions. 
The problem may be solved in several ways. If the “motivation” 
has been strong enough it alone may serve to hold the learner to the 
needed repetitions, but this happy outcome is far from frequent. 
Even a keen desire to master a skill may lose its strength long before 
the simpler habits have been thoroughly mechanized. Recognizing 
this probability, the skillful teacher provides additional incentives for 
sustained effort. He may employ rivalry and emulation (p. 172), 
pitting groups against one another as in a spelling match. He may 
utilize standard tests (p. 193) to incite the learner to surpass his 
own best previous record. He may employ “devices” to introduce 
a superficial variety into the practice while the essential process 
that is being learned remains unchanged. Thus, instead of drilling 
exclusively on the multiplication-tables in their organized form, he 
may use number “‘flash-cards”’ on which various combinations have 
been printed and which are presented to the class quickly with a 
premium of some sort placed upon ready and accurate responses. 
It has been fairly well established by experiment that drill or 
practice periods are most effective when not too long, especially if 
one is just beginning to learn a new art. As practice continues, too, 
the intervals between the drill periods may profitably be lengthened. 
(4) Permitting no exceptions.—An important precept 
of habit-formation is very sedulously to guard against 
exceptions or errors in the practice. This is one of the 
principal reasons, of course, for laying so heavy an em- 
phasis upon attentive repetition. It also suggests a 
reason for the superior effect of brief practice periods at 
the outset in the earlier stages of learning. If the prac- 
tice continues until fatigue sets in, the chances of error 
are greatly multiplied.

(5) The ‘‘law of effect.”— As a rule, habits are 
formed more quickly when each step toward their per- 
fection appeals to the learner as satisfying some need 
that he feels. Contrariwise, unpleasant results tend to 
keep the desirable bonds from becoming fixed. Hence 
habit-formation is usually subject to what Professor 
Thorndike has called the ‘law of effect.” 
The fundamental importance of habit-formation. — 
Many teachers who have acquired skill and insight in 
the difficult work of habit-formation find this apparently 
laborious and uninspiring phase of teaching replete with 
satisfactions. They enjoy seeing their pupils grow little 
by little, yet perceptibly, and now (since the develop- 
ment of standard tests) even measurably, in the incre- 
ments of habit that in the end and in the aggregate 
will mean so much in the way of growth, development, 
and mastery. Taken each by itself, these increments 
seem small and trivial; and yet, ‘little things” though 
they are, they are fundamental to the work that the 
school has to do, and this work is very far from a ‘little 
thing.” Much that man has accomplished in the past 
is represented by these tiny increments of habit and skill 
that form so large a part of the materials of elementary 
education. In the individual as in the race, every little 
conquest bravely attempted and toilsomely wrought is 
a step upward. 
No one has so forcefully and eloquently written upon 
the subject of habit as did William James in a famous 
chapter of a great book, The Principles oj Psychology. 
1 William James (1842-1910) is recognized as the most distinguished scholar 
that America has so far produced. By training a physician, he later became 
a profound student of psychology and philosophy. He taught for several

  224 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
We commend to the prospective teacher this book (or 
its briefer form published under the title, Psychology) 
and especially the chapter on Habit. He or she will 
find in it much that will lift the difficult work of habit- 
building from the level of a routine and perfunctory 
task to the plane of a “great adventure.” 
B. Ipras, Concepts, Facts, AND PRINCIPLES AS ADAP- 
TIvE OutTcomses OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
The distinction between habits and ideas. — We have 
already seen that the formation of a clear idea is an im- 
portant initial step in forming a habit. An idea is a 
mental picture, either (1) a conscious revival or recon- 
struction of an experience, or (2) a construction formed 
from elements of different experiences. For example, 
one may revive more or less accurately an image of an 
acquaintance, or the details of a journey that one has 
made; or one may build ‘‘in the imagination” a charac- 
ter that combines the good qualities of several persons 
that one has known, or project a journey that one has 
never taken by uniting in a new way certain elements 
in one’s memories of former journeys. The ability to 
recall experience in the form of ideas is obviously of very 
great value, for it enables one to “size up” situations or 
solve problems in the light of earlier experiences with 
situations or problems of the same kind. But the ability 
to construct ideas from elements chosen from different 
years in Harvard University in company with George H. Palmer, Josiah Royce, 
and other brilliant students of philosophy. In addition to his Principles of 
Psychology, published in 1890, he put forth in 1899 a delightful series of 
addresses, Talks to Teachers on Psychology, and to Students on Some of Life's 
Ideals, which has already been listed among the recommended references for 
our readers.
-P-A-G-E-237
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 225 
experiences is of even larger value, for this ability makes 
it possible for one to take elements of one’s own experi- 
ence and put them together so that they will represent 
the experiences of others or even the great group of ex- 
periences of the race. (Recall the discussion of “‘vi- 
carious” experience in earlier chapters.) This con- 
structive ability also makes possible an intelligent 
adaptation of past experience to new situations and prob- 
lems. (Recall the forward-looking capacity of mind as 
discussed in Chapter VI.) 
Illustrations of the distinction between the “skill” 
and “knowledge” outcomes. — This distinction is of 
paramount importance in teaching. In the old-time 
school the only kind of learning that found a place was 
memoriter mastery, — “learning by heart,’’ — which 
really meant reducing everything to an automatic or 
“habit” basis. This kind of learning is still absolutely 
necessary in the “skill” subjects; it has a limited place 
in the “knowledge” subjects, but this place is far less 
important than the old-time teachers believed. Here 
the emphasis should be upon rational mastery rather 
than upon mechanical mastery, upon understanding or 
comprehension rather than upon memorization. 
“Knowledge”’ elemenis in the study of hygiene. —We 
have already suggested that habit-forming is important 
in certain phases of the study of hygiene; but it is also 
important to leave with the learner broad and compre- 
hensive principles which will serve as a guide to his con: 
duct in situations that we cannot foresee or for which 
e cannot equip him with completely formed habit- 
esponses. He should have specific habits of cleanli-

  226 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
ness, but he should also know why cleanliness is signifi- 
cant and what his habits do for him. Definite ideas or 
accurate meanings should be associated in his mind with 
such terms as ‘‘disease,’’ “bacteria,” ‘‘resistance.” He 
should understand that certain diseases are caused by 
bacteria and that bacteria can be killed or rendered 
innocuous by such agencies as sunlight and oxygen and 
chemical disinfectants. This knowledge represents only 
one of the many large and comprehensive principles with 
which the science of health is concerned, but it illus- 
trates what is meant by a ‘‘principle,” and it suggests 
the importance of these comprehensive principles as 
outcomes of teaching and learning. 
Geography as a ‘‘knowledge” subject. —In the early 
days of elementary education, the study of geography 
meant memorizing the names of countries and their 
boundaries; cities and their locations; states and their 
capitals; rivers and mountain ranges; oceans, seas, gulfs, 
and bays; capes and peninsulas. Successful learning 
meant skill in‘glibly reciting these often purely mechani- 
eal associations. Some work of this sort is still neces- 
sary to a mastery of geography, but the teacher of to-day 
aims to go much farther than this, and to leave with his 
pupils an understanding of the laws that govern climate; 
the meaning of rivers, oceans, lakes, and mountains in 
terms of their influence upon human life through pro- 
moting or retarding easy communication; the principles 
that determine the location of cities; the reasons why| 
the great trade-routes developed as they did. 
“Knowledge” outcomes in education for citizenship. 
Certain habits and skills are proper outcomes of th     
    
               
    
      
-P-A-G-E-239
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 227 
study of civics. Children should have some practice in 
school in what may be termed the mechanics of trans- 
acting public business. They should learn through their 
own clubs and societies how to organize and conduct 
public meetings; how to elect officers; how to observe 
the proper formalities in addressing the chairman and in 
debating with their fellows. Practice likewise should 
certainly be afforded in some of the activities that make 
for community cleanliness and health. Important as 
they are, however, these items of habit and skill are 
probably less significant as outcomes of school education 
than is an understanding of the principles that underlie 
good government and good citizenship, and the meaning 
of such terms as ‘“‘democracy”’ “representative govern- 
ment,” a “‘public trust,” and the like. Even an under- 
standing of these principles is probably less important 
than another group of outcomes that we shall discuss 
a little later. 
“Knowledge” elements in arithmetic. — We suggested 
in a preceding paragraph that the “basic elements” of 
arithmetic belong primarily to the group of “skill” 
subjects. There are, however, numerous topics in 
arithmetic the desired outcomes of which partake far 
more of the nature of knowledge than of the nature of 
skill. While everyone needs a ‘‘letter-perfect”” mastery 
of the fundamental processes, — addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division, — and reasonable facility 
in manipulating common and decimal fractions, the 
more important tables of denominate numbers, and the 
erations of percentage and interest, many of the appli- 
ations of arithinetic are of chief importance in elemen-

tary education because of the insight or knowledge that 
they furnish regarding the way in which the world’s 
business is transacted. Thus such topics as taxes, in- 
surance, banking, partnerships, and “‘stocks and bonds” 
need not and should not be treated in the same way as 
are the basic skill elements. Understanding is the sig- 
nificant factor here, not mechanical mastery. | 
Some provisional definitions. We have used the 
terms idea, concept, meaning, fact, principle, and law as 
representing adaptive outcomes of teaching and learn- 
ing, but we have not yet tried to define these terms in a 
formal way, preferring to let their meaning come first 
through the context and through the contrast that we 
have drawn between “‘skill”’ outcomes and “‘knowledge”’ 
outcomes. By way of summary certain provisional 
definitions will now be attempted. 
Ideas, concepts, and meanings. — For our purposes, 
the terms idea, concept, and meaning may be thought 
of as fairly synonymous. While, strictly speaking, every 
recalled experience is an idea, the use of the word in edu- 
cational discussions is usually limited to those conscious 
controls of conduct that have been built up or “‘ab- 
stracted” from several experiences. These are usually 
attached to words or other symbols, and if the student 
will think of the meaning that he or she attaches to such 
words as “‘ government,” “‘democracy,”’ “‘religion,”’ ‘‘hon- 
esty,” and the like, the essential characteristics of the 
term idea will probably be clearer than a formal definition 
could make them. (We choose these rather abstract 
terms because such words as ‘‘table,” “chair,” ‘“‘dog,” 
and ‘“‘window” usually suggest concrete, images of par-
-P-A-G-E-241
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 229 
ticular objects.) The essential characteristic of an idea 
is not the concrete imagery in which it manifests itself, 
but rather the meaning that it has for conduct. An 
idea is, indeed, a bundle of ‘‘cues” for conduct. In this 
sense it is quite synonymous with the terms ‘‘meaning”’ 
and “concept.” 
Professor Bode explains these terms as follows: 
“Tn general, a meaning is anything that is suggested, pointed 
to, or indicated by something else. The noise in the street means 
street car, the cloud of smoke means a fire, the falling leaves 
mean the approach of winter. But human beings have the capac- 
ity of detaching the thing thus suggested or indicated and treat- 
ing it independently, apart from the specific setting or context. 
A child on the roof of a house suggests falling, but the falling 
can be disengaged from its concrete setting and made a subject 
of independent interest, as when we study falling bodies in order 
to determine the law of momentum or acceleration. In much 
the same way we detach meanings when we study school systems, 
or soil composition, or business organization. ... , the result being 
that we can talk about these topics without necessarily referring 
to any specific instance. When a suggested thing, a meaning, is 
thus detached and provided with a name, it is called a concept. 
Our concepts may have a great wealth of content, so that they 
are applicable to a wide range of cases; in fact, the great advan- 
tage of detaching meanings in this way is that they become more 
readily available for use in a variety of situations.” 
“Facts,” “principles,” “hypotheses,” and ‘“laws.’’? — 
For our purposes, the terms “fact” and “principle” may 
be thought of as formulations of discovered relationships 
between ideas. ‘“‘The world is round like a ball’’ for- 
mulates the discovered relationship between the idea

-P-A-G-E-242
  230 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
“world” and the idea of a ‘‘ball.” The line between 
facts and principles cannot be sharply drawn, but the 
term ‘‘fact”’ is usually employed to cover single or par- 
ticular relationships, while the term “principle” repre- 
sents sweeping or general relationships, — relationships 
which are universal in the sense that they hold true of all 
facts of the same class. Such general relationships or 
‘generalizations’? when proved to be universal in their 
scope and application, are called “laws.” If they are 
not clearly established as laws but still seem to be uni- 
versal, they are termed ‘“‘hypotheses” or ‘‘theories.” 
Thus the principle of gravitation is usually accepted as 
firmly established and is properly referred to as the 
“law” of gravitation; the principle of natural selection 
as the prime factor in the evolution of life is still an 
“hypothesis.” 
It is well for the student of education to discriminate carefully 
between statements that represent well-established laws and state- 
ments that are only plausible but still unproved hypotheses. Edu- 
cation deals with social and psychological problems of very intricate 
character, and the thoroughly established laws in the fields of soci- 
ology and psychology are few in number. Almost inevitably writers 
and speakers will set forth statements that appear to have universal 
validity, but which on analysis prove to be but plausible hypotheses, 
or even express relationships that are true only in exceptional cases. 
The reader of this book has doubtless been somewhat irritated by the 
frequency with which qualifying words and phrases occur,—“per- 
haps,” “probably,” “apparently,” “it seems,” “some people believe,” 
and the like. No writer wishes to use terms that indicate uncer- 
tainty, and yet ina field such as ours this practice is often necessary. 
' Even after the caution that has been exercised, the student will 
doubtless discover several instances of general statements which 
should have been qualified.

OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 231 
The teaching of meanings, facts, and principles. — To 
equip the learner with an adequate store of meanings, 
facts, and principles, —in short, to equip him with 
knowledge as distinguished from habits and skills, — is 
far from an easy task. To get the learner to understand 
or comprehend what one tries to teach is difficult enough, 
but good teaching cannot stop here. The large problem 
in connection with “instruction” (as distinguished from 
“training,” or habit-building) is to make knowledge 
dynamic, — to teach in such a way that what is learned 
will not only be understood, but also recalled and applied 
when needed in facing and solving the problems of life. 
The facts of individual differences in learning-capacity 
which were discussed in Chapter VI become of large 
import in this connection... To quote Professor Bode 
again: 
“Whether any individual can apply the meanings or concepts 
which he has already acquired when he is confronted with a new 
situation is, to a considerable extent, no doubt, a question of na- 
tive ability. Newton, for example, was able to apply the familiar 
concept of ‘falling body’ to the motion of the moon, because he 
was able to see the resemblance between this motion and the 
falling of the apple. His previous training had furnished him with 
some information about falling bodies and about the components 
of a circular motion, but for the application of this knowledge he 
was left to his own devices. . . . 
“...No amount of training can convert dullness into genius, 
and if the individual is too slow-witted or too much upset by the 
emergency to use his own resources, this fact can hardly be blamed 
1In Chapter VIII, ‘‘general intelligence” was identified with capacity to 
learn. It is well to point out here that some psychologists believe that the 
ability to deal with abstractions (with very large and comprehensive ideas 
and concepts) is the true criterion of “‘intelligence.’’ According to this view, 
a marked ability to apply general principles to concrete situations would in- 
dicate a high degree of intelligence.
-P-A-G-E-244
  232 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
on education. But, unfortunately, the failure to apply previous 
training to the new situation may be due to the character of the 
training. If the concepts are mainly verbal, too empty to furnish 
suggestions, then education must assume the responsibility. 
James’s story of his struggle with his student lamp is’a case in 
point. The lamp would not burn properly, and it was only by 
accident that he discovered the remedy, which consisted in prop- 
ping up the chimney so as to let in more air. James had doubtless 
studied the theory of combustion in physics, but in spite of that 
fact the flickering lamp suggested nothing whatever to him. The 
theory was for him just ‘book learning,’ which could not be con- 
verted into practice.” ! 
Some of the most important developments in the 
technique of teaching during the past thirty years have 
been directed toward the solution of this problem of 
having knowledge mastered in such a way that it will be 
a dynamic force in the life of the learner, —in such a 
way that it will actually fulfill its function in enabling 
him to adapt himself more effectively to the situations 
that he meets. These developments will be studied by 
the prospective teacher in the succeeding stages of his 
professional education. In this introductory book only 
an initial orientation can be attempted. 
Exposition vs. development in teaching. — An impor- 
tant step in insuring a dynamic mastery of facts and 
principles is to encourage the learner to discover some 
of them for himself, and then to encourage him likewise 
to look for ways in which they can be used or applied. 
Thus the modern school has laid much emphasis upon 
teaching by development as contrasted with teaching by 
exposition.

ships, one may proceed by setting forth definitions of nouns, verbs, 
adjectives, and adverbs, illustrating each definition carefully by 
appropriate sentences, explaining the various forms or inflections 
in which the parts of speech appear, and finally formulating the 
rules of syntax which govern the relationships, and a mastery of 
which, the teacher hopes, may enable his pupils to speak and write 
correctly. A clear, logical, well-illustrated exposition of this sort 
may be successful with some pupils. It is now regarded as a much 
better practice, however, to have the learner himself work with the 
materials of language under the guidance of the teacher; make his 
own definitions after a study and analysis of typical sentences; dis- 
cover for himself the way in which good writers use the inflected 
word-forms; and formulate simple rules that will generalize what 
he has learned. 
Teaching by such a process of development obviously 
consumes more time than teaching by systematic and 
logical exposition, but it is believed to insure far better 
results, and the testimony of good teachers is strongly 
in its favor, — although very few would contend that 
everything should be taught through development and 
that there is no place for clear-cut logical exposition. 
Developmental lessons. — The teaching-technique which 
aims thus to encourage the learner to formulate rules 
or principles on the basis of his own study of particular 
cases and to search for applications of these principles 
has been formulated in two types of ‘‘developmental 
lessons.” 
(1) ‘Inductive development.’’ — The ‘Inductive Les- 
son” has as its objective the clear understanding of a 
principle (rule, definition, generalization) based upon 
the careful study of particular facts. The lesson is 
divided into stages or steps, five in number, which were

worked out by the followers of Herbart,! and are some- 
times referred to as the ‘‘formal steps of the recitation.” 
They may be briefly described as follows: 
Step I. Preparation: One of Herbart’s lasting contributions to 
educational theory was his recognition of the fact that new knowl- 
edge can be comprehended or understood only when brought into 
a definite relation with what is already known. This is his famous 
principle of ‘“apperception,”’ which means the interpretation of the 
new in the light of one’s experience. The followers of Herbart, in 
working out a technique of teaching new knowledge, placed as: the 
first step in the process the recall or revival or “review” of the 
knowledge possessed by the learner that would help him in under- 
standing the new knowledge. For example, if one has already 
studied nouns and comes now to a first acquaintance with adjectives, 
it is well as a preliminary to the study of adjectives to review briefly 
what is known of nouns. Either at the beginning of this step of 
“preparation” or at its close the Herbartian writers recommended 
that the aim or purpose of the new lesson be carefully explained to 
the class. 
Step II. Presentation: This basis having been laid, the next 
task of the teacher is to set before the class the concrete or particular 
eases that they are to study as a basis for drawing conclusions and 
formulating a generalization. In the lesson on the adjective this 
might well be a group of words modifying the noun. Under the 
supposition that the pupils are already familiar with nouns and verbs, 
the attention naturally falls on the new part of speech. 
Step III. Comparison and abstraction: By comparing the new ele- 
ments in the sentences with the elements already known, some of 
the characteristics of the former may be made to stand out in sharp 
relief. The skill of the teacher lies chiefly in his ability to get the 
1 Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776-1841) was one of the most influential 
of modern students of educational theory. His clear recognition of the 
significance of interest to learning was an important factor i in, (breaking up 
the barren formalism of the old-time school. He established a “‘ Pedagogical 
Seminary” at the University of Kénigsberg in East Prussia, but his teachings 
were not viewed with favor by the Prussian government, and his Seminary 
was discontinued in 1833. In addition to his contributions to educational 
theory, Herbart is recognized as one of the founders of modern psychology.
-P-A-G-E-247
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 235: 
pupils to see these characteristics for themselves, — to discover them. 
Omitting the adjectives makes a difference in the meaning of the 
nouns. Once this is detected, the essential nature of the adjective 
as a noun “changer” or “modifier” is not difficult to grasp. This 
mental “grasping” of an element common to a number of particular 
cases is known as the process of “abstraction.” 
Step IV. Generalization: With the common elements abstracted 
through comparing the particular cases with one another and with 
related older knowledge, the generalization or formulation of these 
elements will follow as a matter of course. The theory of develop-. 
mental teaching lays large emphasis upon the learner’s own formu- 
lation, even if the definition or principle thus derived be crude and 
inadequate. It can be, and of course should be, refined and re- 
worded before the work with it is completed, but the initial effort of 
the learner to state as clearly as he can the principle that he has 
discovered or the distinction that he has defined is far from an 
unimportant part of the process. 
Step V. Application: If the principle or the definition has been: 
worth the time and trouble consumed in its development and for-~ 
mulation, it is certainly worth a little more time and effort to give 
practice in its application. As a result of developing the definition. 
of the adjective, for example, the pupils may be directed to find all 
the adjectives that they can in a new group of sentences, and to: 
explain in each case why they are adjectives. Thus, beginning with 
the concrete and particular, they pass to the abstract and general, 
and finally come back once more to the concrete and particular, — 
but now newly equipped to solve its problems. 
The refinement of the technique! involved in the in- 
ductive developmental lesson was an important forward 
step in the art of teaching. Like other suggestions for

in Germany, Tuiskon Ziller (1817-1882), and Wilhelm Rein (born 1847); in 
England, John Adams (born 1857), for many years a professor in the Uni- 
versity of London, England; and in America, Frank M. McMurry (see note, 
p. 205); his brother, Charles A. McMurry (born 1857), for several years di- 
rector of training in the Northern Illinois Teachers College, now a professor 
in the Peabody Teachers College, Nashville, Tennessee; and Charles De Garmo 
(born 1849), from 1898 to 1914 a professor in Cornell University.

  236 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
the improvement of teaching, however, its virtues were 
exaggerated in the sense that it was assumed to have a 
field of application far more extensive than rightly be- 
longed to it. Within a limited range, the “formal steps” 
have a very large value, and it is to be regretted that 
this value was somewhat obscured by the assumption 
that they constituted a ‘‘general method” of teaching, 
a mastery of which by the young teacher would solve 
most of his problems. This assumption could not be 
substantiated and as a result the procedure itself tended 
to be discredited. 
(2) “‘Deductive development.” — Another technique, 
suggested by and analogous to the Inductive Lesson, is 
known as the Deductive Lesson. This is really -an 
expansion of Step V (‘‘Application’’) of the Inductive 
Lesson, and was designed still further to emphasize the 
application of principles to the solution of particular 
problems, although it was used long before the Induc- 
tive Lesson was formulated. 
The emphasis of the problem in teaching. — Through 
emphasis on developmental lessons, an important factor 
in effective teaching and learning emerged gradually into 
high relief. The value of presenting the materials of 
education in the context of their application came more 
and more clearly to be recognized. It had long been 
known, of course, that subjects of study which could be 
easily organized into a series of “problems” were, as a 
rule, better taught and better mastered than were sub-   
1 Illustrations of the Deductive Lesson may be found in Miss Lida B. 
Earhart’s Types of Teaching (Houghton Mifflin, 1915, ch. vi), G, D. Seaver 's

Bagley’s The Educative Process (Macmillan, 1905, ch. xxvi).

jects of study that lacked this advantage. Mathematics 
and foreign languages are subjects which lend themselves 
readily to this “‘problematic”’ presentation, and the use 
of the problem and the problematic exercise in the work- 
ing of “examples” in arithmetic and algebra, in the 
solution of “originals” in geometry, and in the very 
definite problem work in translating, analyzing, and 
parsing, has been emphasized almost from the outset 
in the teaching of these subjects. The development of 
the Herbartian pedagogy, especially the emphasis given 
in the formal steps to stating clearly the aim or problem 
of the lesson, suggested the extension of “teaching 
through problems” to other fields. A powerful stimulus 
to this extension came also from the work of John 
Dewey,' who, early in the present century, set forth the 
great value of basing instruction upon the actual, present 
needs of children rather than exclusively upon their 
future needs. (See p. 41.) He contended that the school 
is not only a preparation for life but also life itself, and 
that the child can be best prepared for aduithood by 
teaching him how to solve the immediate problems that 
arise in his own child-world. 
The project method. — An important and far-reach- 
ing result of this emphasis of the problem in teaching 
and learning has been the development of the “project 
method.” It is in this method that the theories of edu- 
cation advanced by Dewey have found their clearest 
expression. 
To teach through “projects” means, in essence, to 
bring knowledge and skill to the learner through the 
1 See footnote, p. 41.
-P-A-G-E-250
  238 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
medium of problems for which he earnestly desires a 
solution. Lest the term “problem” be too narrowly 
conceived, the writers! that have most closely fol- 
lowed Dr. Dewey’s teachings prefer to use the term 
“purpose” and refer to the essential characteristic 
of learning through projects as “purposeful activity.” 
Other writers? give the larger emphasis to the “natural 
setting’ as the essential characteristics of a project. 
They distinguish sharply between such problems as 
those represented by the ‘“‘examples” of arithmetic and 
algebra, and the “‘real’”’ problems of actual life such as 
those that the farmer, the mechanic, the business man, 
and the housewife must meet and solve. Only when 
problems of the latter type become centers about 
which to organize skills and ideas, these writers con- 
tend, is one truly applying the ‘‘project method” of 
teaching. 
From either of the points of view, however, the im- 
portant feature of project-teaching lies in the attempt 
to make skill and knowledge dynamic from the outset. 
The materials of education are taught and learned in 
their immediate application to the solution of real prob- 
lems or the realization of whole-hearted purposes. The 
contrast with the older methods of teaching and learn- 
1The leading exponent of the conception of project teaching which em- 
phasizes ‘purposeful activity” is William Heard Kilpatrick (born 1871), since 1911 a professor of education in Teachers College, New York City, 
and widely known as a teacher. He defines the project as a ‘‘ whole-hearted. 
purposeful activity proceeding in a social environment, or more briefly . . 
the unit element of such activity, the hearty purposeful act.” 
2 For example, W. W. Charters (see footnote, p. 217). His definition of 
the project (‘‘An act carried to completion in its natural setting and involving 
the solution of a relatively complex problem”) has been developed and richly 
illustrated by John A. Stevenson in his book, The Project Method of Teaching, 
Macmillan, 1921.

  240 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The second part of the diagram represents the various subjects 
of study organized and taught each in accordance with its own in- 
ternal system, and with reference not to immediate values or appli- 
cations but to “deferred values” or adult applications. Frequent 
efforts are made, however, to illustrate possible applications and 
values through practice in school problems or references to situations 
in actual out-of-school life. 
Different views as to the place of project-teaching. — 
A very important question in educational theory and 
practice to-day is the extent to which the organization 
of materials on a project basis should replace the sys- 
tematic organization. It is maintained by certain stu- 
dents of the problem that all of the skill and knowledge 
that one needs may be learned in close connection with 
projects and purposes, — that the art of teaching at its 
best consists in seizing upon the dominant problems and 
purposes of the learner and then bringing in the items 
of skill and knowledge that will solve these problems 
and realize these purposes. Others would use the proj- 
ect organization extensively in the lower grades, sup- 
plementing it gradually with systematic study as the 
child advances to the higher grades. Still others see in 
the project method a valuable means of supplementing 
or complementing systematic teaching and learning at 
all stages of school life. While it is as yet too early to 
take toward this important question anything more than 
an open-minded attitude, the student of teaching will 
do well to keep closely in touch with the development 
that is now going on so rapidly and to make sure that 
he or she has at least an initial mastery of both the 
older and the newer procedures.

AND LEARNING 
The distinction between ideas and ideals. — Ideas, 
concepts, and meanings were considered in the preceding 
section as practically synonymous terms, and were de- 
fined as bundles of ‘‘cues” for conduct, — conscious 
“controls” which may serve to guide conduct when one 
faces situations for which a mechanized habit-response 
has not been developed. An ‘‘ideal”’ as this term is used 
in educational discussions may well be thought of as a 
master-idea, — a much more comprehensive control which 
determines large patterns of conduct. It is further 
differentiated from an idea by being surcharged, so to 
speak, not only with meaning but with worth; it re- 
flects something that appeals to one as of outstanding 
value; it has an emotional as well as an intellectual basis; 
it is appreciated as well as understood and comprehended. 
Illustrations of the distinction. —It will be recalled 
that ideas, concepts, and meanings are crystallized in 
and expressed by words. Words may likewise crystal- 
lize and express ideals, and by contrasting idea-words 
and ideal-words, the student may form for himself a 
fairly clear ‘‘idea”’ of an “ideal.” Let us take the word 
“temperance” for example. As this word is used in 
everyday discussion it has a definite and well-understood 
meaning. ‘‘He had temperate habits”; ‘‘We attended 
a lecture on temperance”; ‘John B. Gough was a 
leader of the temperance movement”; — even a person 
who is most intemperate in his alcoholic indulgences 
may understand or comprehend the meaning of the ternr
-P-A-G-E-254
  242 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
“temperance” as thus used. In other words, one may 
have a perfectly clear idea without being possessed of the 
corresponding ideal. One may even use the idea in 
adjusting one’s self to situations in life without making 
the idea a goal to be striven toward, or a rigorous 
standard for determining what one should or should 
not do. When an idea becomes such a goal or standard, 
it has taken on the essential characteristic of an ideal. 
Again, consider the word ‘‘Union”’ as this is applied 
to the federation of American states. The Constitution 
was adopted, among other reasons, in order to estab- 
lish ‘‘a more perfect union.” The idea of union was 
even then well understood or comprehended; the imme- 
diate desirability of a larger measure of unity among 
the thirteen states was clearly recognized; to some, 
even at the very outset, a thoroughgoing union was an 
ideal in the sense of a goal to be worked toward; but 
it required nearly three generations of struggie and effort 
culminating in a great civil war to enthrone national 
unity as a fundamental ideal possessed by all of the 
people. 
Consider another illustration: A high school bey is 
trying to decide upon an occupation. He takes a course 
in “vocational guidance.’’ One by one the principal 
fields of work are set before him. As he studies them 
he gains relatively clear ideas of each. He learns what 
the various occupations demand in the way of innate 
abilities; what training is required; what rewards each 
offers; what opportunities for growth each provides; 
what dangers to life and health each involves; what 
the chances of seasonal unemployment will be in each;
-P-A-G-E-255
OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 243 
  and so on. Gradually, it may be, one group of occu- 
pations comes to stand out above the rest as, to him, 
the most desirable. He talks the matter over with his 
parents and his teachers, and finally makes a firm 
decision. He decides to be a farmer, a carpenter, ‘a 
lawyer, or a merchant. Out of tke ideas that he has 
built up, then, a lasting ideal has emerged. 
Or it may be that this boy has a more general ideal 
from the very outset. He intensely desires to be a rich 
man, and he studies the range of occupations to find 
those that will promise best to make him wealthy. In 
this case, the knowledge that he gains of the various 
occupations is a means to an end. His ideal has already 
been formed; he now builds up ideas that will help 
him toward the realization of his ideal. In the same 
way, he may have a desire to be ‘“‘successful”’ or — far 
better — he may have firmly established the ideal of 
rendering the best service to his fellows. 
Two important types of ideals. — From the above 
illustrations, it is clear that there are two large groups 
of ideals: (a) terminal ideals, which we designate in 
everyday language as ‘‘ambitions,” broad ‘‘aims,’”’ com- 
prehensive ‘‘purposes,” and the like; and (6) regulative 
ideals, which are frequently spoken of as “standards of 
conduct,” ‘‘moral standards,” or “‘virtues.” 
The significance of this distinction will be apparent 
from a simple illustration. The boy’s desire to become 
wealthy represents a terminal ideal. It is a broad and 
comprehensive purpose projected into the future. Let 
us assume that this ideal really possesses him to the 
extent that he is willing and anxious to put forth every
-P-A-G-E-256
  244 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
effort to attain the projected end. As to whether this 
is a worthy or an unworthy ideal, opinions will differ, 
but all will agree that its realization may be sought by 
unworthy methods. It becomes a most important mat- 
ter whether the individual will resort to avarice, exploita- 
tion, and even downright dishonesty, or whether he will 
hold his ambition within the standards of fair-play, 
scrupulous honesty, and a decent regard for the rights 
of others. The latter qualities exemplify regulative 
ideals; they regulate conduct in that they set certain 
limits within the boundaries of which terminal ideals 
are to be sought. 
The significance of ideals as outcomes of teaching 
and learning. — Probably no work that the school at- 
tempts is so important as that which is involved in its 
efforts to establish worthy ideals. By their very nature, 
of course, terminal ideals are largely individual in their 
character, but good teachers can and do exert a large 
influence in determining whether the ambitions or broad 
life-purposes of their pupils and students are worthy ; — 
they can, in other words, do much to make the learner 
self-critical of his or her ambitions. 
There are, too, certain types of terminal ideals that 
govern the conduct of peoples and nations, and here the 
influence of the school is unquestioned. Germany’s am- 
bition to secure a ‘“‘place in the sun” was deliberately 
inculeated by German schools and German teachers. 
Indeed, wherever great national systems of universal 
education have been developed, the use of the school 
to inculcate national ideals has been both general and 
effective. The very efficacy of the procedure suggests}
-P-A-G-E-257
  
OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 245 
at once the serious responsibility that rests upon those 
who determine the policies of the schools to insure that 
the national aspirations encouraged by educative agen- 
cies shall be worthy and not unworthy. In a very real 
sense, the future of the world depends upon the teachers 
who, in each nation, have the duty of inculcating ideals 
in the hearts and minds of the great masses of the 
people.! 
In the development of regulative ideals, the school has 
a clearly recognized field. To insure that its product 
shall be possessed of worthy dynamic standards, such as 
honesty, industry, personal cleanliness, a respect for 
law, and a willingness to help others, is an objective with 
which no one will quarrel. It is a simple matter to for- 
mulate the objective, but it is quite another to realize 
it in actual practice. 
The teaching of ideals. — Relatively definite methods 
or patterns of teaching, as we have seen, are available 
to the teacher who seeks the two types of outcomes 
previously discussed (the habit-and-skill outcomes and 
the knowledge outcomes); and in these fields, too, it is 
now possible with a reasonable degree of accuracy to 
measure the degree in which the desired outcomes have 
1Cf. the discussion of the teaching of history, pp. 79 ff. above. A very 
important question arises here as to the extent to which the ideals to be 
inculcated shall be in the choice of the teachers themselves. In Germany, 
prior to the Great War, the teachers had essentially no choice. They were 
only cogs in a great machinery of indoctrination. In our own country, 
while there are innumerable partisan groups that are attempting to control 
this powerful force of universal education, the collective judgment of the 
teachers themselves has at least a chance to be heard. With this opportunity 
there rests upon the teaching profession a corresponding responsibility to 
formulate with the utmost care the policies that it would propose, and to put 
these policies before the people with a force and a cogency that will carry 
conviction. The recent development of professional organizations for 
teachers (see ch. xi below) will doubtless reap its richest harvest in this con- 
nection. 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  246 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
been attained. But when one approaches the more 
difficult task of establishing dynamic ideals and depend- 
able standards, the suggestions as to procedure are far 
less definite, and objective measures of the results of 
teaching are almost entirely lacking. This is far from 
saying, however, that the problem has not been very 
seriously considered, or that progress has not been made 
toward its solution. Some of the more important the- 
ories that have been proposed as provisional guides for 
educational practice in this field may be briefly referred 
to here. 
Ideals as direct and as concomitant outcomes. — It is 
generally agreed that ideals may be impressed. or devel- 
oped either as direct outcomes of teaching and learning 
or as indirect or ‘‘concomitant’”? outcomes. Almost 
everyone will be able to recall one or two occasions in 
his or her life when a great awakening came, when a new 
standard or a new aspiration suddenly assumed a position 
of dominance, and when the whole trend of life was 
transformed. A frequent phenomenon of this type is 
represented by religious conversion, but some who have 
never “‘experienced” religion in this way have had 
analogous experiences. They have responded to some 
deep and fundamental note in a sermon or a lecture; 
they have been inspired by a great novel or a powerful 
drama; they have gained a new access of strength and 
power from a song or a symphony; from a great picture 
they have caught something of the vision of the artist; 
more frequently perhaps the inspiration has come in a 
more personal and intimate way from the direct influ- 
ence of a ‘‘strong personality.” From the point of view
-P-A-G-E-259
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 247 
or our present discussion, the important fact is that this 
direct and immediate implanting of an ideal is not only 
possible but sometimes tremendously effective. 
We all recognize, however, that strong and pervasive 
ideals may develop much more slowly and as a result of 
experiences that have not been explicitly directed toward 
this end, — that they may, indeed, be indirect or con- 
comitant (accompanying) outcomes of learning-experi- 
ences the direct outcomes of which are of a quite different 
character. In the learning of reading, arithmetic, spell- 
ing, and other school subjects, for example, the learner 
may also be acquiring at the same time life-long stand- 
ards and ideals of industry, thrift, self-reliance, accuracy, 
application, and persistence, — or just as certainly he 
may be acquiring life-long standards of a negative or 
unworthy sort, such as indolence, ‘‘getting by’’ with 
least effort, dependence upon others, and dishonesty. 
Not only in the school, but at home, on the playground, 
on the street, wherever he may’be, ideals and standards 
either worthy or unworthy are constantly being exem- 
plified and these will inevitably be taken up, literally 
“absorbed,”’ by large numbers of children. To recog- 
nize all possible sources of ideals, to utilize those that 
yield worthy ideals, and to counteract the influences 
that are negative or degrading, are obvious and yet most 
difficult duties of education. 
The lesson in appreciation as a means of engendering 
ideals directly. — As we have seen, literature and the 
other fine arts are among the most important agencies 
that the school can use for the direct inculcation of 
ideals. The problem in teaching these subjects is two-
-P-A-G-E-260
  248 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
fold: (a) to develop standards of selection, or — as it is 
usually phrased — to develop a ‘‘taste” or ‘‘liking” for 
good literature, good music, and good pictures; and 
(6) through this to insure an appreciation of the great 
ideals which art at its best reveals. Something in the 
way of a definite pattern or technique for teaching in 
this field has been formulated as the ‘‘lesson in appreci- 
ation.” ! 
A detailed treatment of the lesson in appreciation? will be found 
in a book by thai name written by Dr. F. H. Hayward, of London. 
Dr. Hayward maintains that the introduction of the learner to a 
great masterpiece of literature or art should be a “great event” in 
the learner’s life, — as he terms it, a “Red-letter’”’ lesson. He fur- 
nishes a wealth of practical suggestions for making such a lesson a 
great event, emphasizing the importance of preparing the “mind 
and the mood” of the learner far in advance by clearing up the dif- 
ficulties that would otherwise stand in the way of full enjoyment 
and appreciation; taking care that the necessary foundation of in- 
formation has been well laid; arousing an anticipatory interest by 
suggesting now and again that something important will soon hap- 
pen; taking due precautions lest distractions will come in to break 
the “magic spell’”’ at the appointed hour; in short, making every 
possible effort to insure a dramatic effect that will make the lesson 
stand out sharp and strong and clear, — something for the learner 
to look back upon in later years as one of the events of his school 
life. 
While Dr. Hayward’s suggestions refer primarily to the teaching 
of literature and the other fine arts, the suggestion of the Red-letter 
lesson can be applied in almost every subject of instruction. The 
initial acquaintance of the learner with a great event or movement 
in history, with a great discovery of science, or with a great invention

lessons devoted to the problem of insuring appreciation was recognized at 
about the same time by George D. Strayer (see footnote, p. 303). and by

in the field of the practical arts may well be made in a manner that 
befits the significance of the materials with which the lesson deals. 
The phase of “teaching for appreciation” in which 
the greatest progress has probably been made is that 
which has to do with story-telling in the primary grades. 
Materials in abundance are now available for work of 
this sort, and several helpful books on the technique of 
story-telling have been published. 
Ideals and standards as concomitant outcomes of the 
more recent developments in the art of teaching. — The 
“socialized recitation” and the “project method” have 
already. been mentioned, — the first as one means of 
adapting materials to the varying capacities of different 
individuals, the second as a means of bringing knowledge 
and skill to the learner in the context of their actual 
application to real problems (pp. 231 ff.; pp. 237 ff.). 
It should be said here, however, that both of these de- 
velopments have made a strong appeal to the progressive 
teacher because of the opportunities that they afford 
for the inculcation of ideals and standards as concomi- 
tant outcomes of learning. They had their origin, in- 
deed, in the tendency of the older forms of class organ- 
ization and the older methods of teaching to engender 
the unworthy concomitant outcomes to which reference 
was made in the preceding section. 
D. Arrrrupes as Reativety Frxep Outcomes or 
TEACHING AND LEARNING 
The nature and types of attitude. — Attitudes are fre- 
quently mentioned in connection with ideals as important 
outcomes of teaching and learning. It is a familiar fact
-P-A-G-E-262
    250 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
that the way in which one interprets a situation and 
reacts to it is often determined by one’s ‘“‘point of view,” 
one’s ‘‘mental set,’’ one’s “‘perspective on the problem.” 
A person who has grown up in the Southern states, for 
example, is likely to have an attitude toward the race 
problem that is quite different from that of a person who 
has grown up in the Northern states. Sometimes these 
attitudes are so deeply seated that any proposal that 
is at all inconsistent with one of them is met by an im- 
mediate emotional response which quite prevents a calm 
consideration of the proposal and a reasoned judgment 
concerning its merits. Because action or decision in 
such cases is likely to come before judgment, the person 
is said to be “prejudiced” or to have a “‘prejudice.” 
Less violent in their manifestations but none the less 
immediate in their effects are the ‘‘tastes”’ that one has 
developed. To the trained musician, the bungling and 
awkward performance of the amateur is irritating; to 
the painter, a lack of harmony in color combinations or 
a lack of balance in design is unpleasant or even painful; 
vulgar speech disgusts those who have been accustomed 
to decent and refined standards of expression. These 
fundamental attitudes have a positive as well as a 
negative influence: one is likely to accept very willingly 
proposals that fit in with one’s points of view or one’s 
prejudices; we readily ‘‘see the truth” in arguments that 
confirm our own beliefs and pet theories; the ‘appeal 
to prejudice” is easily the most popular form of public 
address. . 
It is obvious that attitudes as exemplified in the illus- 
trations just given are powerful ‘“‘controls” of conduct,
-P-A-G-E-263
  
OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 251 
but just what they represent psychologically is not as yet 
clearly understood. They have many resemblances to 
habits; indeed, in everyday speech they are often re- 
ferred to as “‘general habits.” For many reasons, how- 
ever, it is best to limit the term “habit” to the specific 
connections between stimuli and responses that were 
discussed in an earlier section (see pp. 213 ff.), and to 
think of attitudes as representing the much larger and 
more comprehensive outcomes not only of teaching and 
learning in the narrower sense, but of experience in the 
very widest sense. 
The genesis of attitudes. — Even if we are uncertain 
as to the precise nature of attitudes, it is possible to 
say something about the way in which they come into 
existence, and from the point of view of education this 
is perhaps more important than a precise definition of 
them would be. 
The significance of early training. — There can be no 
question that the early experiences of children and the 
early training to which they are subjected form a most 
significant source of the attitudes, points of view, tastes, 
and prejudices that will have a determining influence in 
their later lives. This is, of course, no new discovery; 
it is a belief that has been widely held and more or less 
intelligently acted upon for centuries; but it has recently 
received an overwhelming confirmation from scientific 
investigation in the field known as psychoanalysis. All 
experiences may be educative in the sense that they 
modify conduct in some measure, but the early experi- 
ences of childhood are formative and fundamental in the 
highest degree. A clear corollary from this principle is
-P-A-G-E-264
252 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
that the educative influences of the home and of the 
earlier school years transcend all others in their impor- 
tance. 
Attitudes as outcomes of the ‘‘life of the school.” — From 
the point of view of the development of attitudes, the 
“life”? of school as distinguished from its program of 
studies has a very large significance. (See pp. 125 ff.) 
This principle has also been recognized for a long time. 
Indeed, the emphasis upon school life has probably been 
the chief factor in the unquestioned influence of the great 
secondary schools of England, such as Eton, Harrow, 
Rugby, and Winchester. In our own country there are 
conspicuous examples of the same influence among some 
of the private and endowed “‘boarding-schools” of see- 
ondary grade, and more notably in the United States 
Military and Naval academies at West Point and Annap- 
olis. Such schools have an advantage over most of our 
public elementary and secondary schools in that the 
entire life of the pupils and students is under institutional 
control during the school year. This advantage cannot 
be duplicated in day-schools, but a great deal has been 
done to overcome this handicap in some measure through 
an intelligent development of what are termed ‘‘extra- 
curricular activities,’ — athletics; clubs and societies for 
debating, nature study, ‘‘dramatics,” and the like; the 
Boy Scouts and Gir! Scouts; the Junior Red Cross; 
pupil and student publications; school parties, excursions, 
and exhibits; and the various forms of student self- 
government. 
The school studies as sources of attitudes. — It should 
not be concluded, however, that the school studies them-
-P-A-G-E-265
  
OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 253 
selves have no influence on these fundamental forces 
that we have called attitudes. If by the skillful teach- 
ing of literature, we can develop a dynamic ideal, we 
may be tolerably certain that this ideal through re- 
peated conscious application will work over into a com- 
prehensive and persistent attitude. Standards of worth 
developed in the study of music will through their re- 
peated application sooner or later develop the kind of 
attitude that we have referred to as a “taste” for good 
music. Whatever is done, then, directly to engender 
ideals and standards may, under the right conditions, 
form the basis of these more fundamental controls of 
conduct. There is, too, clear evidence that persistent 
and systematic study will engender definite points 
of view and perspectives which will remain as impor- 
tant determinants of conduct long after many of the 
detailed facts mastered in such study have been for- 
gotten. This is especially true of the study of history 
(see pp. 82 ff.), and it is highly probable that the sys- 
tematic study of science has an analogous outcome. 
It has often been said that every experience leaves a 
“deposit,’’ — that everything that one does exerts an 
influence upon one’s later conduct. While this would 
be very difficult to prove, it doubtless reflects some 
measure of truth. If it be true of “real” or “actual” 
experience, we cannot escape the conclusion that it is 
also true of “‘ vicarious”’ experience, and it is certainly true 
of the experience of learning considered apart from what 
is learned. Even if attitudes are difficult to define, their 
existence and their potency must be granted. They must 
assuredly be reckoned with in the process of education.

Summary; EpucATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND THE 
ProsieMs oF CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION 
The importance of classifying outcomes as a basis for 
curriculum construction. — The terms that have been 
used in this chapter as designating different outcomes 
of teaching have a large place in educational discussions, 
and especially in the discussions of the “curriculum- 
problem” in the elementary and high schools. This 
problem in its various phases is being studied to-day 
as never before. It is recognized that many of the 
school subjects have developed in a haphazard fashion, 
often without a clear-cut understanding of the function 
that they were to discharge in the scheme of education. 
This does not mean that the mastery of these subjects 
has been without a large measure of value. It rather 
means that these values, in many cases, have not been 
clearly defined, and that teachers have consequently 
worked without having in mind definite objectives be- 
yond seeing to it that pupils “passed” in the courses 
that they were taking. 
The present tendency is rigorously to insist that 
these objectives be clearly and definitely formulated. 
The more recent curriculum studies set forth very 
specific ends that should be sought in terms of definite 
habits and skills to be mastered; specific facts and 
principles to be learned and applied; definite ideals to 
be appreciated; tastes, interests, points of view, and 
other attitudes to be established. 
The determination of desirable outcomes. — Some 
very important pioneer work has been done, too, in
-P-A-G-E-267
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 255 
finding out what specific habits, skills, items of know]- 
edge, ideals, and attitudes are likely to be most needed 
and most useful by all individuals (as a basis for uni- 
versal general education) or by members of different 
occupational groups (as a basis for specialized and voca- 
tional curricula). Some of the more important methods 
that have been employed to this end will indicate the 
way in which this phase of educational investigation is 
being attacked. 
Job analysis. — This method has been extensively em- 
ployed in vocational education. A very good example 
is given by Dr. Charters in his book, Curriculum Con- 
struction: } 
“A formal job analysis. — A somewhat more formal sort of 
analysis is that which is known as the job analysis. Used at first 
in the. vocations as a device in the employment offices of organ- 
izations which-were too large for the employment officer to be 
familiar with the duties of all the jobs in the organization, it 
spread very rapidly and came to have its greatest usefulness and 
largest amount of publicity in connection with the Army during 
the World War. While its widest use in the vocations has been 
in connection with employment, its most valuable use is in con- 
nection with training programs. 
“Another example of the analysis of a simple job is that of the 
position of application clerk in a department store, which is given 
as follows: 
“1. Meets people who desire to open accounts. 
“2. Asks them for the information to fill out blank. 
“3. Writes form letters or telephones for references. 
“4, Fills out Mercantile Agency blanks. 
“5. Looks up rating in Dunn’s, etc. 
“6. Files applications temporarily till references come in. 
1 Published by Macmillan, 1923. For reference to Dr. Charters’s other 
oontributions to educational science see footnote, p. 217.

“7, Makes notes of references on blanks and hands to Credit 
Chief, who passes on them. 
“8. Enters name, address, and number of applications in index, 
“9. Answers requests from other firms for references. 
“In this table are shown nine duties which the application 
clerk has to perform, and clearly the course of study needed to 
train such a clerk will deal with the nine topics. It should teach 
him how to meet people who desire to open accounts, how to ask 
them for information with which to fill out blanks, how to write 
form letters, how to get information over the telephone, ete. 
When the student has been taught each of these topies according 
to ideals which would necessarily be included, all the theory 
needed by him has been presented.” 
A principle similar to that employed in job analysis 
is represented by Dr. Bobbitt’s! proposal to base the 
curriculum of formal education upon the deficiencies or 
shortcomings that individuals reveal ‘‘after they have 
had all that can be gained by . . . undirected training.” * 
The analysis of current literature. — This has been used 
as a method of determining the information that one 
needs regarding persons, places, historical events, literary 
characters, and the like, if one is to read intelligently 
the literature of the day. The method yields some sug- 
gestive inferences regarding the materials that may be 
regarded as especially important in the study of such 
subjects as history, geography, and literature, but the 
results of the analysis must be very carefully inter- 
preted if they are to be used with profit.* 
1 Franklin Bobbitt (born 1876) is one of the outstanding students of the 
curriculum problem. He has been since 1908 associated with Professor Judd 
in the School of Education of the University of Chicago. 
2 F. Bopsrrr: The Curriculum, p. 41. Houghton Mifflin, 1918. 
3 Examples of the use of this method as applied to newspapers and maga- 
zines will be found in the Fourteenth Yearbook of the National Society for the 
Study of Education, Part I, 1915; and in the work of C. W. Washburne (see 
also footnote, p. 199) in the T'wenty-second Yearbook of the society, 1923,

Analysis of official reports. — Dr. H. O. Rugg" has an- 
alyzed statistical reports to learn what facts of com- 
mercial and economic geography are of particular value 
in elementary education, and a related application of 
the same principle has been made by Dr. Horn in ana- 
lyzing platforms of political parties to find what ques- 
tions and issues are of persisting significance in political 
discussions. 
Judgments of experts, and especially of ‘frontier 
thinkers.”’ — A number of investigators have attempted 
to evaluate curriculum-materials by collecting and 
“averaging”? the judgments of experts workers in vari- 
ous fields. In an early study, for example, the relative 
importance of twenty dates in American history was 
determined by having a number of competent historians 
“rank” the dates and by combining the rankings thus 
obtained. A most suggestive variation of the same 
principle was made by Dr. Rugg when he had a number 
of recognized “frontier thinkers” in the social sciences 
list the problems that each thought to represent the 
most important issues that the coming generation will 
have to face. 
Limitations of the scientific study of the curriculum 
problem. — The methods briefly referred to above rep- 
resent pioneer efforts in a very important and a very 
complicated field. These methods will doubtless be re- 
ch. xiii. Another application of the method, this time applied to current 
Sooks in the social studies, will be found in the chapters contributed to the 
Sixteenth Yearbook of the Society by Ernest Horn (born 1882), one of the most prominent students of the curriculum problem, and since 1913 a professor of education in the State University of Iowa. 
1 The work of Harold O. Rugg (born 1886) has been particularly note- 
worthy in the study of curriculum-materials for the social-science courses of 
the junior high school. Since 1919 he has been the psychologist of the 
Lincoln (experimental) School of New York City.

258 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
fined within the next decade and other methods will be 
discovered or invented. The result will be a large 
number of important facts concerning the materials of 
education that are most useful for given purposes. 
Rapid progress in this field can be confidently predicted. 
On the other hand, there are obvious limitations to the 
objective methods which try to determine what the school 
may profitably teach by analyzing what people now do 
and thus finding out what equipment in the way of 
skills, knowledge, ideals, and attitudes they need in 
order to do these things well. This is important, but 
education must consider as well another problem —a 
problem that must be approached in a quite different 
way. It must ask not only how to help each genera- 
tion to do well those things that in all likelihood it will 
have to do in any case; it must also ask whether there 
are not other things to do which are not being done 
now, and which in consequence no objective analysis 
could possibly discover. Science gives us facts, and 
facts as we have seen are of tremendous importance; 
but science in itself does not supply us with ideals, 
nor in a fundamental way does it teach us to choose 
among ideals. This is the particular task, not of the 
scientist, but of the philosopher, and hand in hand with 
a science of education must go a philosophy of education. 
As the late Dr. Colvin! said in discussing this problem 
of educational objectives: 
“Tt is the business of a philosophy of education to evaluate 
human experience, and to discover those values most significant

of educational problems, particularly in the field of psychology and measure- 
ments. He was associated for many years with the University of Illinois,

must act on its own initiative. It must act constructively.” 
Qusstions, EXERCISES, AND PROBLEMS 
    
   
         
   
              
   
                
    1. Prepare a list of the important specific skills that you acquired 
before entering school. Make a supplementary list of the specific 
skills that the.elementary school was instrumental in forming. 
2. Find in your own experience illustrations of the distinction 
between fixed and adaptive controls of conduct. What principles 
of hygiene have you consciously used in meeting new situations 
and forming new habits? In what way have you applied consciously 
the facts and principles that you learned in the study of geography? 
How has the knowledge that you acquired in the study of physics, 
chemistry, or biology in the high school helped you? 
3. Select a specific piece of conduct that you wish to make habit- 
ual, — such as going through a series of “ setting-up ’’ exercises 
immediately after arising each morning, or devoting fifteen minutes 
at a definite time each day to systematic reading that is not a part 
of the required work of the school, or speaking with clear enuncia- 
tion if you happen to be a person who mumbles his words and clips 
his final consonants. Keep a record of the progress in each case, 
and note how long it takes to establish the habit, what difficulties 
you have to overcome, and what devices help you most in over- 
coming the difficulties. 
4. Illustrate from your own experience the distinction between 
ideas and ideals. Try to trace your “terminal’’ ideals or ambitions 
to their sources, and determine the part (if any) that your teachers 
and your school studies have played in the development of these 
ideals. 
5. Study your own “attitudes,” your preferences (tastes) for 
certain types of literature or art, your political prejudices (if you 
Ihave any), your deeply-seated moral convictions. What influences 
Ihave been exerted upon you that may account in part for these 
ttitudes? (Consider home training; school instruction; church and 
nd later with Brown University and Columbia University. The quotation 
in the text is from a paper that he published just before his death, ‘The 
jource of Educational Objectives,” School and Society, May 12, 1923.

Sunday-school experiences; books that you have read, especially 
novels, histories, and biographies; and the personal influence of the 
people whom you have known.) 
6. In observing classwork in the elementary or high school try 
to identify the type of lesson. Note especially what is done to 
initiate specific habits and skills, to develop meanings, to engender 
ideals. Note, too, the ways in which the life of the school may 
influence (whether for good or for evil) the more fundamental atti- 
tudes of the pupils.

EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 
The aim of the preceding chapters has been to set 
forth the outstanding facts regarding the purposes, 
materials, and processes cf education. The present 
chapter turns to another group of facts with which the 
prospective teacher should have an acquaintance if he 
is to understand the conditions surrounding the teach- 
ing service and if he is to decide intelligently as to the 
particular branch of the teaching service that he will 
prepare himself to enter. These are the facts relating 
to what may be called the “‘machinery”’ of education, — 
the established agencies or institutions through which 
the purposes of education as a great public enterprise 
are realized. 
The magnitude of the educational enterprise. — 
Taken as a whole, the work of organized educational 
agencies constitutes the largest single enterprise in our 
country with the exception of farming and the all- 
inclusive business of government itself. In the work of 
education a larger number of individuals are engaged 
each year than in any other single kind of work. Pupils, 
students, teachers, school executives, and other school 
employes of all kinds constitute as a group more than 
one fifth of the entire population. To build up an 
adequate mental picture of an organization so huge as| 
this is not an easy task, but it is well worth the effort. 
262
-P-A-G-E-275
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 263 
THE CLASSIFICATION OF EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES 
The problem. — Perhaps the best way to start the 
construction of such a picture is to attempt a classifica- 
tion of the institutions and agencies that carry on this: 
vast enterprise. We know that there are schools of 
various kinds, — elementary schools, high schools, col- 
leges, universities, medical schools, law schools, reform 
schools, technical schools, trade schools, rural schools, 
urban schools, schools for the deaf, schools for the blind, 
public schools, private schools, parochial schools, and a 
long list of others. It is clear, however, that more than 
one principle of classification is involved even among 
the few types of schools that we have named. Elemen- 
tary schools, for example, may also be public or paro- 
chial or private, rural or urban; technical schools may be 
high schools or they may be colleges; schools for the 
deaf may be public or private, they may be of elemen- 
tary-school grade or of high-school grade. It will be 
well, then, to determine the chief distinctions upon 
which are based the different types of educational agen- 
cies. At least five principles of classification seem to be 
implied in the grouping of educational agencies that 
common usage recognizes in referring to different types 
of schools. Some of these principles will be obvious 
enough once they are clearly formulated; others will 
merit more detailed study. 
1. Schools may be classified according to the edu- 
ational levels represented. — This principle lies at the 
asis of the distinctions that are made in American edu- 
ation between elementary schools and high schools,

  264 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
between high schools and colleges, and (to some extent) 
between colleges and universities. In general, elemen- 
tary education has been thought of as including the 
kindergarten and the first eight grades of the usual 
public-school program. For the normal child who be- 
gins school at six and who completes one grade of school 
work each year, the elementary-school period ends at the 
age of fourteen. The standard high school has required 
four years of work for the average pupil, and the period 
of high-school or “secondary” ort has normally 
covered the years from fourteen to eighteen. The 
standard college course is four years in duration, but the 
more advanced college work, which is sometimes called 
work of ‘university’? grade, may extend the period of 
“higher” education two or three years further. Thus 
there are three large divisions of education that are based 
upon a combination of the two factors, age and attain- 
ment: namely, elementary education, secondary educa- 
tion, and higher education; but just where the lines are 
to be drawn is not as yet a matter upon which all are 
agreed. The accompanying diagram indicates both the 
grouping that prevails the more generally to-day; and 
the grouping that is strongly advocated by certain 
authorities. (See diagram p. 265.) 
2. Schools may be classified according to the aims 
and objectives that they seek to attain. — A very im- 
portant distinction is to be drawn between institutions 
of general education, and institutions of specific education. 
General education involves those materials and processes 
that will be of probable significant value to every in. 
dividual whatever his specific occupation or mode of lif

  266 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
may be. Specific education, on the other hand, deals 
primarily with specialized materials and processes, and 
is distinctly pointed toward specific occupations or 
modes of life. 
Types of “general” education.— (1) Fundamental edu- 
cation. — General education may be further subdivided 
into at least two rather distinct types: fundamen- 
dal_education, the most important materials of which 
were described in Chapter III; and liberal education, 
some of the typical materials of which formed the theme 
of Chapter IV. Fundamental education may be thought 
of as comprising the habits, skills, ideas, ideals, and atti- 
tudes that are absolutely necessary to individual sur- 
vival under the conditions of modern civilization. In 
addition to (a) the basic social arts described in Chapter 
III, there is general agreement that fundamental educa- 
tion should also reflect: (b) the specific habits and general 
ideals that make up the social amenities, — decent be- 
havior, deference to age and to womanhood, and consid- 
eration for the rights and feelings of others; (c) the hab- 
its, knowledge, and ideals that make for personal and 
social health (Chapter V) ; and (d) the habits, knowledge, 
and ideals that are indispensable to good citizenship, 
including the basic facts of geography and national his- 
tory and a knowledge of the forms and functions of 
democratic government. 
(2) Liberal education. — Fundamental education is 
pointed toward the clearly predictable situations which 
all must face in living the social life. It tends, therefore, 
to emphasize the fixed outcomes referred to in Chapter 
TX. Liberal education deals chiefly with the adaptive;
-P-A-G-E-279
  
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 267 
outcomes (Chapter IX), and prepares for situations the 
precise nature of which cannot be predicted. It aims to 
equip the individual, not so much with specific skills as 
with broad and comprehensive principles. It aims to 
make the world just as meaningful to him as possible. 
It furnishes him with standards of value, through which 
he can view problems in their proper proportions, — 
not distorted by local, selfish, or partisan points of view. 
Through the study of history, it aims to rid his mind of 
the fallacy of the immediate, — to give him a time per- 
spective upon his own life and the issues of his own 
generation which he must help to meet. Through sci- 
ence, it tries to free him from the shackles of superstition, 
fraud, and error which often reduce strong men to the 
helplessness of infancy. Through literature and art, it 
tries to reveal the finer and more subtle forces which 
dominate human motive and often determine human 
conduct — forces so subtle that only the masters can. 
detect them, but which when once revealed are available 
to all who can appreciate and understand. It is clear 
that a liberal education in this sense could be made of 
large value to an individual irrespective of his particular 
occupation or mode of life; hence its inclusion under the 
broader term, “‘general’’ education. 
Dr. David Snedden' has proposed a somewhat different distinc- 
tion between liberal and vocational education. He divides human 
activities into two large groups which he calls production and con- 
1 David Snedden (born 1868) has won wide recognition as a student of the problems involved in vocational education and as a pioneer in the study of 
the sociological phases of education. He has been on the staff of Teachers 
College, Columbia University since 1905, except for the period between 1909 
and 1916 when he served as Commissioner of Education for the State of 
Massachusetts. The point of view to which reference is made in the text is 
set forth in his Vocational Education, Macmillan, 1920, ch. iii.

268 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
sumption. In the economic order, every person who “pulls his own 
weight” must be a producer (whether directly in farming, fishing, 
or manufacturing, or indirectly through essential services rendered 
to actual producers); and every person, too, is necessarily a con- 
sumer of his own products and of the products of others. Educa- 
tion, then, must aim to develop both productive capacities and con- 
sumptive or utilizing capacities. Education for production is the 
field of vocational education, education that will make the individual 
a better consumer is the field of general and especially of liberal 
or cultural education. This point of view is particularly signifi- 
cant because of the definite value that it recognizes for those types 
of education that will lead men and women to make a wise use of 
their leisure time (for civilization greatly extends the leisure time 
of the average individual), and to use intelligently the products 
of labor (which constitute social capital). 
Types of specific education (1) Vocational education. 
— Specific education also has its subdivisions. Prepa- 
ration for particular occupations can be included under 
the broad term, vocational education, of which several 
sub-types at once suggest themselves: (a) “industrial” 
education is usually thought of as dealing with the 
training of skilled artisans in the mechanical trades; 
(b) “technical” education prepares those whose work will 
lie in the broader constructive or planning phases of 
industry; (c) “‘commercial” education on the lower 
(secondary) levels trains for the ‘‘skill” phases of busi- 
ness life, — accounting, stenography, and the like; on the 
higher levels, commercial education is analogous to 
technical education; (d) “agricultural” education deals 
with the specific problems involved in technical training 
fordarming and allied occupations; (e) “home-making” 
education takes as its field the large and important 
problem of preparing women for the innumerable re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 269 
sponsibilities of the home; (f) ‘professional’ education 
is analogous to technical education in that it deals 
extensively with principles as well as with skills; its field 
is that of preparing recruits for the occupations that are 
called professions, — medicine, law, the ministry, teach- 
ing, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, journalism, social 
work, and the like.! 
(2) Auxiliary education.— A second subdivision of 
specific education is coming to be included under the 
term, auxiliary education. Here the differentiating 
principle is preparation not for particular occupations 
but rather for particular modes of life. The term is 
usually employed in referring to educational institutions 
that care for those who deviate in a marked degree from 
thenorm. Thus we have schools for ‘‘sensory’’ deviates, 
—for the blind and the deaf; schools for ‘“‘mental” 
deviates, — for morons and the feeble-minded; schools 
for “moral” deviates or delinquents, — reform schools 
and parental schools; and a beginning has been made in 
the establishment of special schools or classes for the 
exceptionally bright or ‘‘gifted” children (see Chapter 
VIII). 
3- Schools may be classified according to their means 
of support. — The broadest distinction here is between 
schools that depend for their support chiefly upon the 
fees that are paid by their pupils, and which may be 
called tutional schools, and those in which instruction 
is given either entirely or largely without cost, and which 
1 It is clear that a sharp line cannot be drawn between the technical and 
professional occupations, but in a general way the technical occupations are 
seen to deal with things, while the so-called professions generally involve 
personal relationships. 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
    270 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
are called free schools. Of the latter type, there are 
two important sub-types: ‘‘tax-supported” schools, 
where the cost of operation is met from public funds 
derived chiefly by taxation; and ‘‘endowed’’ schools, 
which depend upon private benefactions. 
4. Schools may be classified according to the agencies 
that control them. (1) Public control. — Tax-supported . 
schools are almost always controlled by legally con- 
stituted boards which represent the people as a whole 
and are responsible to the people either directly or 
through an executive or legislative body. Such schools 
are known in this country as public schools when they 
are of elementary or secondary grade and are under the 
control of local governmental units such as the city, 
county, town, or school district; when they are schools 
of higher education, they are usually called government 
institutions, state institutions (usually colleges or uni- 
versities), or municipal institutions, accordingly as the 
control is vested in one or another of these three govern- 
mental units. 
(2) Corporate control. — Many schools supported in 
whole or in large part by public benefactions are con- 
trolled by boards of trustees that are self-perpetuating 
(that is, new members are chosen by those who them- 
selves constitute the board). Such boards are usually 
incorporated under the state laws, and this type of 
control may therefore be termed corporate. 
(3) Church control. — There is, however, an impor- 
tant group of institutions that are supported chiefly by 
religious bodies; when these are controlled by such 
bodies (sometimes they are controlled by independent
-P-A-G-E-283
  
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 271 
boards of trustees) they may well be called church 
schools. Here the largest group is that represented by 
the “‘parochial’”’ elementary schools of the Roman 
Catholic and Lutheran churches, but these and other 
denominations also support and control a number of 
secondary and higher institutions. 
(4) Private control. — Finally there are the institu- 
tions. that are controlled by individuals or by joint- 
stock companies. These are usually of the tuitional 
type, and not only depend upon student-fees for sup- 
port but also look to these fees as a source of profit. 
It is well to reserve the designation, private schools, for 
this group.! 
5- Schools may be classified according to the type 
of community that they serve. — This basis of classifi- 
cation is particularly important in the discussion of 
public-school problems. The outstanding distinction is 
that which is recognized between rural and urban 
schools. The United States Bureau of Education draws 
a line between these two groups very definitely, 
including as rural schools those that serve commu- 
nities of fewer than 2500 inhabitants. There are con- 
sequently two important subdivisions of this group, 
“open-country”’ schools and ‘‘village” schools, — two 
terms which are self-explanatory. Another helpful classi- 
fication of rural schools is based upon the number of 
1 The restriction of the terms “public school” and ‘public institution” 
to tax-supported and publicly controlled schools and colleges has been de- 
plored by those interested in corporate and church institutions on the ground 
that the latter institutions are “public” in several important ways. In the 
first place they are open to the public; in the second place, while they do not 
draw their support from public taxation, they often appeal to the public for 
support; and in the third place, they are not infrequently subject to a certain 
measure of state control.
-P-A-G-E-284
  272 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
teachers employed; thus the terms ‘‘one-teacher,” “‘two- 
teacher,” and ‘‘three-teacher’’ schools lia recur fre- 
quently in the discussion of rural-school problems, while 
for open-country schools of more than two or three 
teachers the term ‘‘consolidated” school is often em- 
ployed because such schools have usually been formed 
through the consolidation of two or more smaller units.

Tue Puprt anp StupDENT PopuLATION 
Upon the basis of some such analysis and classifica- 
tion as the preceding section sets forth, one may well 
proceed to the next step in the construction of a mental 
picture which will embody the outstanding features of 
American educational systems. The magnitude of the 
educational enterprise has already been referred to.
-P-A-G-E-287
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 275 
To know how the pupils and students are distributed 
among the various agencies of education will aid one in 
appreciating what this magnitude actually means. 
How pupils and students are distributed among the 
various types of schools. — An overwhelming proportion 
of the pupil and student population is represented, of 
course, by the enrollment of the public elementary and 
high schools. In 1920, this enrollment reached the im- 
pressive total of a little over 21,000,000.    
   
                               
    
        There are many devices which one may use in attempting to get 
a fairly clear idea of such very large numbers. If we imagine this 
vast army of public-school children assembled for a “grand review,” 
and marching four abreast, it is easy to compute that it. would take 
a month for the army to pass a given point, — assuming that two 
ranks passed each second and that the procession continued twenty- 
four hours each day. Again, if this army were assembled in a single 
group, allowing standing-room two feet square for each, it would 
spread out over an area of 2000 acres or more than three square 
miles. If each were to be allotted “camping ground,” — say a space 
two by six feet on which to lie down, every inch of space on nearly 
6000 acres or nine square miles would be occupied, — one fourth 
of a “congressional township.” 
While some persons find such devices for conceiving huge magni- 
tudes helpful, others are probably distracted by irrelevant factors. 
Having gathered the 21,000,000 school-children on a 2000-acre or 
1000-acre space, a conscientious imagination is likely to be puz- 
led as to how to feed them and how to get them back!! Even 
his curiosity might lead to a further clarification of the conception, 
owever, if the student cared to make some further computations 
elative to the amount of food required for a single breakfast, or the 
umber of passenger coaches that it would take to transport the 
ultitude. 
1 This difficulty has been very interestingly discussed by John Adams in 
is Exposition and Illustration in Teaching, Macmillan, 1910, ch. xii, 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  276 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Another kind of picture which does less violence to the actualities 
may be built up by imagining the various divisions of this great 
army on their march to school. Anyone who looks out upon a city 
street, a country highway, or a village lane between half past eight 
and nine o’clock in the morning of any school day will see the “local 
contingents” take up the march. Let the imagination be extended 
to cover all of the neighborhoods of the community; then all the 
communities of the state; then all the states in the time-belt. When 
it is half past eight in Boston, the first division begins its march, 
—a, great movement that extends all the way from easternmost 
Maine to the tip of Florida and west to the further slope of the 
Alleghenies. Half past nine in Boston, — half past eight in Chicago: 
another division dotting every street and highway from the Great 
Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico falls into line. Half past ten in Boston, — 
half past eight in Denver: the third division stretches out over the 
plains and mountain valleys from Montana to the Mexican border. 
Half past eleven in Boston, — half past eight in San Francisco: 
from Puget Sound to San Diego, the fourth division takes up the 
march. 
The enrollment of 21,000,000 for the public elemen- 
tary and high schools must be increased by approxi- 
mately 2,000,000 which represents the enrollment in 
parochial and private schools of elementary and second- 
ary grade, thus making a total of 23,000,000 on these 
two educational levels. On the level of higher educa- 
tion, the enrollment is relatively much smaller, and yet 
even here the number is now more than half a million. 
The distribution of elementary and secondary pupils 
as to age and grade. — In so far as numbers enrolled in 
the schools are concerned, the most significant period| 
of life from the educational point of view lies betwee 
the ages of six and fourteen. Of the total number o' 
persons between the ages of five and twenty who wer 
attending school in 1920, nearly two thirds (62.8%     
    
                
   
                   
    
-P-A-G-E-289
  
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 277 
were in this age-group, while slightly more than one 
fourth (26.3%) represented the age-group, 14-18. This 
is only a partial indication of where the “peak-load”’ of 
the public school lies. Although one fourth of all 
pupils in attendance represent the age-groups, 14 to 18, 
by no means one fourth of the public-school enrollment 
is in the corresponding grades. In fact, if we take the 
public-school enrollment for 1919-20 (leaving out the 
kindergarten) we find the following distribution! of the 
pupils among the various grades: 
PER CENT 
or Toran 
ee dae Primary grades: 32.3% GRADE 
: 115 Intermediate grades: 43.0% 
Junior-high-school grades: 19.2% 
Senior-high-school grades: 5.5% 
  Practically three fourths of the school burden falls, 
then, in the primary and intermediate grades, and if 
the kindergarten enrollment were added, the burden of 
the kindergarten-primary and intermediate divisions 
would be found to be even greater. The table shows 
clearly, too, where the largest demand for teachers is 
likely to be found under present conditions. 
1 These per cents have been computed from the careful estimates of grade- 
distribution published by the U. S. Bureau of Education, Annual Report,

278 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Retardation and elimination. — These comparisons of 
grade enrollment are indicative of a condition net has 
constituted a very serious problem in American educa- 
tion. Not all pupils progress regularly from grade to 
grade in harmony with their chronological ages. In 
place of this regular and uniform progression, we find 
in almost every classroom (in addition to a group that 
are of normal age for the grade) both underage and 
overage pupils, the latter usually greatly outnumbering 
the former. This means either that many pupils do not 
enter school at the normal age of six, or that many are 
held back and required to repeat the work of one or more 
grades. Both of these factors, and especially the latter, 
give rise to what is technically known as retardation 
(see ch. viii). Retarded pupils not only tend to accumu- 
late on the lower educational levels, but they also tend 
to drop out of school at the earliest date that the com- 
pulsory-schooling laws will permit; hence arises the 
problem of elimination, — another technical term which 
means dropping out of school before one has completed 
the work of the eighth grade.? 
The wide discrepancy between the enrollment of the 
first grade and the enrollment of the eighth grade is 
not.of course entirely due to retardation and elimination. 
It must be borne in mind that first grade enrollment 
will always be relatively larger than eighth-grade en- 
rollment as long as the population is increasing. It is 
also true that death claims a small proportion of chil- 
dren of school age, and that this factor will account for 
a certain part of the discrepancy. Even when these

  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 279 
and other factors are duly considered, however, the 
elimination that is unquestionably due to ‘‘repeating”’’ 
grades remains by far the most significant factor in 
producing these differences.! 
The growh of the high-school enrollment. — It will be 
noted that the enrollment in the four years which con- 
stituted the high-school period under the older termi- 
nology is only about ten per cent of the total enrollment. 
It would be quite erroneous, however, to conclude from 
these figures that only ten per cent of American children 
attend high school. The four high-school years con- 
stitute only one third of the twelve-year total; hence if 
the population were stationary, and if everyone who 
entered the first grade progressed regularly through to 
the twelfth grade, the enrollment in the last four grades 
would be only one third of the total. It will probably 
never even approximate so high a proportion, (1) be- 
cause the population, at least for decades to come, will 
continue to increase, thus giving a relatively larger 
number of children to the lower educational levels; and. 
(2) because elimination in the elementary school, while 
possible of great reduction, will probably never be re-' 
duced to zero. As a matter of fact, however, the num- 
ber of pupils that are kept into and through the high 
school has increased remarkably within the past ten 
years, and it is still increasing literally by “leaps and 
     
   
    
   1 The first extensive investigation of retardation and elimination was made 
for the Russell Bags Foundation and published under the title, Laggards in 
Our Schools, in 1909. The author, Leonard P. Ayres, is one of the most 
prominent American statisticians. He was born in 1879, and served as a 
teacher and a school administrator in Porto Rico soon after it became an 
American possession. During the World War, he was Chief Statistician of 
the American Expeditionary Forces. Since 1920 he has been vice-president 
of the Cleveland Trust Company.

bounds.” The enrollment in the four high-school years 
has more than doubled within the past decade. This 
growth has been stimulated very largely by the greatly

increased provision of high-school facilitics. During the 
past thirty years, the high-school enrolln ent has grown 
ten times as fast as the general popul ition. Out of 
every 100 pupils who entered the first grade in 1912,
-P-A-G-E-293
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 281 
slightly more than 23 enrolled in the first high-school 
year in 1920. In many city school systems where high 
schools are well supported, the proportion of first-grade 
pupils who eight years later are enrolled in the first 
high-school year has been as high as forty per cent. 
The growth of enrollment in higher institutions. — The 
rapid increase in the number of high schools during the 
past thirty years, and the consequent heavy increase in 
high-school enrollment, has had the effect of stimulating 
larger and larger enrollments in colleges and other insti- 
tutions of higher education. The enrollment in such 
institutions was more than doubled during the decade 
1910-1920, and is still increasing at a very rapid rate. 
In 1920, the aggregate in all higher institutions was 
approximately 625,000. 
Characteristics of the pupil and student population on 
different educational levels: Differences due to elimina- 
tion and selection. As has been pointed out (ch. viii), 
a most important problem of teaching is to adapt the 
materials of education to different learning-capacities. 
While this problem is difficult enough when the pupil- 
group or class is fairly homogeneous, — that is, made 
up of pupils who are closely similar in their abilities, — 
it becomes much more complicated when the groups 
represent wide variations in capacity. This variation is 
greatest on the lower age-levels where a typical class- 
room is likely to reflect all grades of ability except as 
the extreme dullards or the very superior pupils or both 
are segregated in special classes. Throughout the first 
six grades, this heterogeneous character of the pupil 
groups persists. The seventh and eighth grades or the  
-P-A-G-E-294
  ae 
282 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
first two years of the junior high school usually repre- 
sent some measure of “selection.” The slower learners, 
having been retarded in the earlier years, are likely to 
reach the end of the compulsory-schooling period before 
they have attained a seventh-grade status. In the 
senior high-school years, the homogeneity is further 
increased through the dropping out of more of the 
slow learners; and those who pass from the high school 
to college constitute a still more highly selected group. 
Factors other than native ability affect this selective 
process. — It should not be inferred, however, that per- 
sistence in school is determined entirely or even pre- 
dominantly by inborn capacities. Many very capable 
pupils are prevented from continuing in school beyond 
the compulsory-schooling period because their parents 
are financially unable to keep them there. Others, who 
could afford to remain, are tempted by the prospect of 
earning without further education what seems to them 
a good wage. Still others are restive and restless under 
the constraint of the school, and take the first oppor- 
tunity to leave. Among those who remain in school, 
too, there are many slow learners who, through personal 
ambition or parental pressure or both, do not give up. 
Thus, while the upper grades and the high school are 
in a sense “‘selective” of the better grades of ability, 
they are by no means rigidly selective. The clear ten- 
dency of the past two decades has been to keep pupils 
sxx school just as long as possible, and to provide types 
of work that even the slow learners will be able to do 
with profit. To-day it may be safely said that the 
chief factors determining persistence in school are, for
-P-A-G-E-295
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 283 
the vast majority of boys and girls, economic and social 
rather than strictly mental. 
A number of careful studies have centered upon this problem. 
One of the earliest of these, made by J. K. Van Denburg,! found only 
slight evidence that the economic status of parents influenced the 
persistence of pupils in the New York high schools. The factors 
that seemed to be most significant were: (1) the presence or absence 
of younger children in the family; (2) the nationality of the parents; 
(3) the choice or lack of choice of an occupation; and (4) the inten- 
tion of the pupil with regard to graduation. C. E. Holley,? how- 
ever, in studying the problem in the high schools of two Illinois 
cities, concluded: (1) that there is a high correlation between the 
economic, educational, and social advantages of a home and the 
number of years’ schooling which its children receive; (2) that eco- 
nomic and social influences more often cause a child to stop attend- 
ing school than does lack of ability to do the work; (3) that truancy 
is most frequent among children of poor and uneducated parents; 
and (4) that a “family tradition of schooling” is probably very effec- 
tive in inducing unusual persistence in school in some cases. F. P. 
O’Brien® has furnished evidence which shows that poor mental abil- 
ity may not be a pronounced cause of elimination from high school. 
H. G. Burdge,‘ in a monumental study of some 200,000 boys be- 
tween the ages of 14 and 16 who had dropped out of school in New 
York State, found very clear evidence that these years constitute 
“restless” age, and that boys at this time are likely not only to 
leave school, but to quit any work that they undertake after a few 
months’ experience with it; leaving school or leaving any other 
type of work may not be due to inability, but rather to this spirit 
of restlessness which makes persistence in any single activity dis- 
tasteful.

284 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Differences due to stages of mental and physical devel- 
opment. — There are, of course, marked differences 
among pupils of different age-groups, and these are 
probably more important to the teacher than are the 
differences that result from the sifting process of elim- 
ination and selection in so far at least as the latter 
operates in the elementary school and in the earlier 
high-school years. With regard to physical develop- 
ment, certain stages or nodes are clearly marked, and 
while there is much uncertainty as to whether these 
physical differences are correlated with equally distinct 
mental differences, the evidence is sufficiently convine- 
ing to warrant a provisional recognition of four stages 
of mental development corresponding roughly to four 
important stages of physical growth. These may be 
conveniently referred to as: (1) the childhood years, 
covering normally the period of kindergarten-primary 
education or the chronological ages five to seven inclu- 
sive; (2) the juvenile years, covering normally the period 
of the intermediate grades (III, IV, V, and VI), or the 
chronological ages eight to eleven inclusive;! (3) the 
early adolescent years, covering normally the period of 
the junior-high school (grades VII, VIII, and IX), or 
the chronological ages, twelve to fourteen inclusive; and 
(4) the later adolescent years, covering normally the period 
of the senior high school (grades X, XI, and XII), or 
the chronological ages fifteen to seventeen inclusive. 
The more important characteristics of these periods 
will be discussed in Chapter XII. 
1 Some students of the problem, including one of the authors of this book, 
regard the third grade as properly a part of the ‘‘primary”’ division, and would 
have the “intermediate” division begin with the fourth grade.

EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 285 
Variations in the pupil and student population due to 
type of community. — (1) Urban and rural communities. 
— The most significant distinctions in American com- 
munities are those that set off the city-dwellers from 
those who live in the open country. These differences 
are reflected in some measure in the pupils of urban 
schools as compared with those of the rural schools. 
The child who lives on a farm has many educational 
advantages in the way of contacts with nature, and 
usually in the way of home-responsibilities, that the 
town and city children lack. On the other hand, the 
city child has more numerous human contacts, and 
probably an environment that is more continuously 
(although perhaps less wholesomely) stimulating to men- 
tal growth. Some students of the problem believe that 
the development of the cities has tended to drain the 
rural districts of the more intelligent stock, and that 
the level of native mental ability is therefore likely to 
be lower among country children than among city 
children. Others believe that the inadequacy of the 
rural school, — the short terms, inadequate supervision, 
and undertrained teachers, — will explain the differences 
that are found. There can be no question with regard 
to the differences. The studies! that have been made 
show very clearly that rural school children at the close 
of the elementary-school period, are likely to be at 
least one year behind comparable city children in school 
attainments; and the results of the Army intelligence 
tests which were given to the drafted soldiers in 1918 
1 The “school surveys” of New York, Kentucky, and Virginia have all shown this very clearly.

286 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
showed consistently lower scores for white soldiers from 
the rural states than for white soldiers from comparable 
urban states. 
(2) Native and foreign-born communities. — Difficul- 
ties of teaching, especially in the elementary schools, are 
intensified in many American communities by the large 
enrollment of children from immigrant homes. In such 
communities, the schools have frequently to teach the 
pupils to speak English before they can proceed with 
the work that the school attempts from the outset with 
the children of the native-born. Again it is maintained 
by some students of the problem that certain elements 
of the foreign-born population represent a relatively low 
level of mental ability which is reflected in larger pro- 
portions of slow learners than one finds among the 
children of the native-born, while others contend that 
most of the differences found may be satisfactorily ex- 
plained in other ways. In any event, it is clear that 
the foreign-born community constitutes a real problem 
in American education. 
Tue TEACHING POPULATION 
Teaching numerically the largest professional occu- 
pation. — The total number of teachers in the United 
States was reported by the Census for the year 1920 ag 
761,766. This number may be compared with correspond- 
ing numbers for other professional groups ! as follows: 
For every 139 people in the country there is one teacher

Distribution of teachers as to different types of 
schools. — The great majority of teachers (680,000 in 
1920) serve in the public elementary and high schools. 
It should be of interest to the prospective worker in this 
field to know in what proportions these teachers are 
distributed among the various divisions of the public- 
school service. The following tabulation gives this 
information in an approximate fashion:

Outstanding characteristics of the different groups. — 
Among the several groups listed in the above tabulation 
there are differences so wide and so significant that one 
cannot gain a clear picture of the teaching population 
as a whole without first studying the important charac- 
teristics of each group. 
Urban and rural elementary teachers. — The elemen- 
tary-school teachers of the United States are almost 
equally divided between the city schools and the rural

recognizes seven elementary and four high-school grades. 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
  
  288 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
schools of the small villages and the open country. 
These two groups, as was pointed out in Chapter I, 
contrast sharply with one another. The elementary- 
school teachers of the cities constitute on the whole a 
mature and relatively permanent group, most of whom 
have been professionally trained for their work. The 
teachers in the village and open-country schools (and 
especially in the latter) are as a group much younger 
than the city teachers, the great majority of them re- 
main but a very brief period in the service, and as a 
group they represent a deplorably low level of general 
and professional education. 
There are wide variations among the different states 
in the age, experience, and training of rural and urban 
teachers, but in every state the differences between the 
two groups are clearly marked. In New York State, for 
example, the differences among teachers in different types 
of elementary schools were reported for 1921 as follows:

EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 289 
The report of the New York Rural School Survey 
also summarizes these differences in terms of what they 
mean to the rural child as contrasted with the city child: 
“The child attending a one-teacher school has one chance in 
two of having a teacher who is less than 24 years old; he has one 
chance in four of having a teacher who is not yet old enough to 
vote. ... A child in a typical second-class city of New York State 
has one chance in two of not having a teacher who is under 34 
years of age; in a third-class city, a child has one chance in two 
of not having a teacher who has not passed the age of 29... . 
“As to the teacher’s experience, the child attending a one- 
teacher school has one chance in five of coming under the instrue- 
tion of a teacher who is just beginning his or her work; in the 
typical city school system the chances are in the ratio of one 
to ten — just half the risk. The rural child in the one-teacher 
school has between one chance in five and one chance in six of 
having a teacher who has taught at least ten years; the chances 
that the teacher will have had more than ten years of experience 
are more than doubled in the . . . cities. 
“As to education, the New York rural child attending a one- 
teacher school has one chance in twenty of having a teacher with 
‘standard training,’ — two years’ attendance at a normal school 
or college following graduation from a four-year high school; if he 
attends a two-teacher school, his chances are about doubled (2 in 
20); in a village school his chances would be increased seven-fold 
(7 in 20); in a second-class city, the chances would be multi- 
plied by twelve (12 in 20); and in a third-class city they would 
be multiplied by sixteen (16 in 20).”’1 
The elementary-school teachers, whether in urban or 
rural schools, are alike in two important particulars: they 
ome chiefly from large families and from families that 
ive in moderate circumstances. This holds true for 
very state in which studies of the teaching population

299 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
ais I have been made, and it is a fact that must be reckoned 
with whenever an effort is made to raise the standards of 
professional education for teachers in the elementary- 
school service. Dr. Coffman found in 1911 that the 
family supplying the typical (‘‘median”) woman teacher 
in the elementary schools had an annual income of $862 
| and that this typical teacher’s family numbered six 
persons — four children and the parents. Studies made 
since that time fully corroborate Coffman’s findings. 
The family income reported in the more recent studies is, 
of course, larger than that found by Coffman, but when 
a correction is made for the decreased purchasing power 
of the dollar, the economic situation of the families sup- 
plying recruits to the elementary-school service is seen 
not to have been appreciably changed. It would, of 
course, be very difficult for such families to provide an 
extensive training for any of their children in preparation 
for a profession. This is one of the reasons for the low 
standards of teacher-preparation that prevail in ele- 
mentary-school service outside of the larger cities.” 
1 Lotus D. Coffman was the pioneer student in this field of educational 
research. His monograph, T'he Social Composition of the Teaching Population, 
was published in 1911. He was born in 1875, and after a wide experience as 
a teacher and superintendent, became director of the training school in the 
Eastern Illinois State Teachers College, and in 1912 a professor in the 
University of Illinois. Since 1920 he has been President of the University 
of Minnesota. 
2In view of this condition, the proposal has been made to provide state 
subsidies for students who are preparing to enter the public-school service. 
A discussion of this problem will be found in W. 8. Hertzog’s State Main- 
tenance of Teachers in Training, Warwick and York, 1921. Maryland now bears all of the expenses of students in its State normal schools in excess of 
$100 annually. Connecticut provides a scholarship of $300 annually for one 
student from each town in the state. Delaware offers fifty free scholarships covering tuition, board, and lodging for a period of two years. The Educa- 
tion Bill which has been before Congress for the past five years, and which 
proposes among other things Federal aid to the states for the training of teach- 
ers, stipulates that a state may use part of its allotment of the Federal tunds 
to provide scholarships for prospective teachers.

    High-school teachers. —'The chief differences between 
elementary-school and high-school teachers are in stand- 
ards of educational attainment and the economic status 
of parents. The typical high-school teacher is a college 
graduate — that is, he or she has had four years of edu- 
cation beyond graduation from high school; except in 
one or two of the largest cities, the standard of prep- 
aration for the elementary-school teacher is but two 
years of education beyond high-school graduation, while 
a large majority of the elementary teachers of the coun- 
try have not as yet reached this minimum. The high- 
school service as a rule, then, is open only to those who 
are sufficiently well cireumstanced to undertake the 
longer and more expensive training. The families sup- 
plying high-school teachers, as reported in the few 
studies that have been made, have in the average of 
cases fewer children and larger incomes than the families 
supplying elementary-school teachers. 
Certain other facts regarding the high-school teachers 
are important: (1) The proportion of men in this branch 
of the service is much higher than in the elementary 
schools. In 1900, the number of men was about 33,000 
or one third of the total number of high-school teachers. 
(2) While the pre-service education of high-school teach- 
lers is longer than that of elementary teachers, the pro- 
essional emphasis in the preliminary education is much 
ess in evidence. (3) This lack of a professional atmos- 
here in the training institutions may account for the fact 
hat the average length of service for high-school teachers 
is less than that of elementary teachers who have had the 
tandard normal-school or teachers-college preparation.
-P-A-G-E-304
  292 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Administrators and supervisors. — This group includes 
school superintendents and their assistant superintend- 
ents; elementary-school and high-school principals; sub- 
ject-matter supervisors, grade supervisors, and rural 
supervisors; together with (as yet) a small number of 
school psychologists, statisticians, physicians, and nurses. 
Unfortunately we have no studies which enable us to 
say more of this group than that they constitute a far 
more mature and stable group than do the classroom 
teachers, whether elementary or high-school. Recently, 
too, the standards of education within the administrative 
and supervisory service have been substantially raised, 
but it is true that there are still large numbers of super- 
intendents, principals, and supervisors who have not 
reached the status represented by college graduation. 
On the other hand, school psychologists, statisticians, 
and physicians usually represent very high standards of 
general and professional education. 
Summary. — In the light of the facts regarding the 
various groups that comprise the personnel of the public- 
school service, we may now proceed to a picture of this 
personnel as a whole. We shall unite the various groups 
and assume that each person among these 680,000 teach- 
ers is just as important as any other person. This is not, 
after all, an absurd assumption, for we cannot discrim- 
inate among teachers as to their importance without at 
the same time discriminating among the pupils for whose} 
training these teachers are responsible. Is there anyone} 
who would maintain that a country boy in Oklahoma i 
either more or less important than a city boy in Buffal 
or Seattle? Is there anyone who would maintain that

  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 293 
seven-year-old girl in the second grade is either more or 
less important than a seventeen-year-old girl in the 
eleventh grade? Is it not just, then, in attempting an 
evaluation of the teachers of American public schools to 
consider them all of equal importance and of equai 
potentiality for good or evil? It is true, of course, that 
we are also including the 31,000 administrative and 
supervisory officers whose dealings are with teachers 
rather than directly and intimately with children; but 
it is also true that they constitute a very small propor- 
tion of the total number. For all practical purposes, 
the American public school can be best evaluated in 
terms of its teachers. 
In constructing the picture of the teaching personnel, it is well to 
imagine these 680,000 teachers forming a long, single-rank line. 
First, let the line form on the basis of age. The youngest teacher 
is at the right of the line; the oldest teacher at the extreme left; 
the others are arranged in the order of their age. We shall “inspect” 
this line as in a military review by passing along the front from the 
right flank to the left flank. The very youngest need not concern us, 
but we shall probably pass nearly a thousand before we come to the 
seventeen-year-old group. Two or three thousand of these must 
be passed before we come to the first teacher who has attained to 
the age of eighteen; and five or six thousand of these before the 
nineteen-year-old group is reached. Then the numbers in the age- 
groups begin to stretch out almost interminably. Forty thousand 
of the nineteen-year olds we must pass, and then fifty thousand of 
the twenty-year olds,—one hundred thousand in all before we 
reach the first teacher who is old enough to vote. Fifty thousand 
twenty-one years old, and about the same number twenty-two years 
old; and then the age-groups for each year gradually grow smaller. 
Somewhere toward the end of the twenty-five year or the beginning 
of the twenty-six year group we strike the middle of the long line, 
we reach the “median” teacher as to age; half of the entire number

       are behind us, half are still ahead. But now the age-groups become 
substantially smaller. At about the thirty-seven-year-old group we 
have passed three fourths of all the teachers; we have only the fourth 
“quartile” left, and these distribute themselves in ever smaller and 
smaller age-groups. At the fifty-year-old group we have passed nine 
tenths of all the teachers. There are only two or three thousand 
now in each age-group; a little later the numbers dwindle to the 
hundreds; then to the tens, — and we are at the end of the line. 
We redistribute the 680,000 teachers, — this time on the basis of 
experience. Those just beginning their work are on the right; those 
who have served the longest are on the left. Again we pass the line 
in review. It is a veritable host of beginners that constitute the 
first segment of the line. As a matter of fact, no one has yet been 
able to say with any reasonable degree of certainty just how many 
teachers begin their work of teaching in American schools each year. 
Some students of the problem assert that one fifth of the entire 
teaching population must be recruited anew each year; others place 
the proportion at one sixth. We shall be within a conservative esti- 
mate if we assume one eighth. This means that we should pass 
by about eighty-five thousand teachers before we came to the first 
teacher who had taught for a period longer than one year. The 
group with two years of experience is about the same in size, but 
the three-year and four-year groups drop off sharply. We pass by 
the fifth-year group and are well into the sixth-year group before 
we have reached the “median” teacher with respect to experience, — 
in other words, before we have reached the middle of the long 
line of 680,000 teachers. And now, as in the age-distributions, the 
groups diminish in size. Half of all of these teachers have taught 
during a period covering six years or less; but the half that have 
taught for the longer period (more than six years) are distributed 
over periods of service ranging from seven to sixty years. At least 
two hundred thousand teachers now serving in our elementary and 
high schools have taught for ten years or more. More than one! 
hundred thousand have taught for twenty years or more. The 
thirty-year-service group, however, falls to about 30,000; the forty- 
year-service group to fewer than 4000; and the fifty-year group 
eight or nine hundred at the most.  
-P-A-G-E-307
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 295 
The alignment is next made on the basis of training. Passing 
from the teacher who has had the briefest education to the teacher 
whose education has been the most extensive, we first pass by some 
twenty thousand teachers whose educational equipment for their 
important work has been limited to what the elementary school 
provides. A few, indeed, have not progressed beyond the sixth 
grade; a much larger group have been limited to seventh-grade 
attainments; while nearly thirty thousand are left behind before 
the first of the ninth-grade contingent is reached. 
The segments representing those whose schooling stopped with the 
ninth, tenth, or eleventh grades take us well beyond the first sixth 
of the line; we have passed in all about 120,000 before we come 
to the first high-school graduate. The next segment, consisting of 
those who have had high-school education but no more (except, in 
some cases, a Summer term in a normal school) is the largest of all. 
It stretches out until, in passing it, we have also passed the middle 
of the line. Then comes the group with one year of training beyond 
high school, which brings us nearly to the last third of the line. Of 
the 680,000 teachers, not more than 250,000 are in the group that 
have had for their work ‘“‘standard”’ training or better. 
It is instructive to reinterpret these facts regarding 
the teaching population in terms of the number of pupils 
that these various groups of teachers have under their 
charge. Upward of a half million boys and girls are 
taught by teachers who themselves have no more than 
an elementary education and many of these boys and 
girls receive all of their schooling at the hands of such 
teachers. At least three million children have teachers 
that have not attained to the level represented by high- 
school graduation. Between two and three million are 
1The figures are approximations only. It is very difficult to assemble 
accurate data regarding the education of teachers in terms of the amount of 
schooling that they have had beyond the eighth grade. It is only recently 
that ‘‘standard” normal-school training has demanded two full years beyond 
the high school. Hence a teacher who reports that he or she is a normal- 
school graduate may have had anywhere from three to seven years of educa- 
tion beyond the eighth grade. 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  296 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
in charge of teachers who are just beginning their work, 
and the majority of whom have no adequate supervision 
to direct them. Between two and three million are 
taught by teachers who are too young to be intrusted 
with the ballot. No fewer than twelve million have 
teachers who are below the standard of training recog- 
nized as the minimum in most civilized countries. 
Measures and policies looking toward the improve- 
ment of the teaching population. — It is not to be in- 
ferred from the preceding discussion that efforts have 
not been made to raise the standards of the teaching 
profession. As a matter of fact, conditions have im- 
proved markedly within the past fifty years. The prob- 
lem is so huge, however, that the rate of improvement 
is necessarily slow. It is subject, also, to temporary 
setbacks, —as at the time of the World War, when 
teachers left the service in large numbers because of the 
keen demand for intelligent workers in other occupa- 
tions, and when in consequence untrained teachers were 
necessarily employed in large numbers. The War, 
too, has been followed by a period of high prices and 
a reduced purchasing power for the dollar. As a result, 
taxes of all sorts have had to be increased in order to 
support the various activities of the local, state, and 
national governments, and there has been a growing 
complaint because of the “‘rising costs” of public enter- 
prises, especially education, although relatively speaking 
(that is, taking into account the diminished value of 
the dollar) the public schools are costing little more in 
proportion to the number of pupils enrolled than they 
did before the War and we are spending now no larger

_EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 297 
proportion of the aggregate income of the nation on 
the public schools than we spent a decade ago.' It is, 
then, greatly to the credit of those in charge of the 
public schools that the standards of training for public- 
school teachers have been substantially advanced during 
this period. Many of the states have made rapid 
strides toward bringing all of their teachers up to 
“standard training,” although no single state has yet 
achieved this distinction. The principal agencies that 
have been employed to this end are the summer sessions 
and the extension courses of normal schools and teach- 
ers colleges. (See Chapter I.) 
The student who is to-day making an extended and 
serious preparation for the public-school service should 
recognize that, other things equal, he or she will be in 
a fortunate position both for securing a good appoint- 
ment and for rendering good service. With the steady 
advance in standards, the demand for the well-trained 
teacher increases apace. And with the increased demand 
come larger rewards, both in the way of better salaries 
and in the way of increased recognition. Many forces 
are now operating to lift the work of teaching to the 
plane of a true profession. These forces had their origin 
and to-day have their center within the profession itself. 
As better trained recruits enter the work of teaching, 
the strength of these forces is steadily augmented. This 
is one of the reasons why, even in an introductory book 
like this, so much space is given to the problem of im-

The total annual investment in education. — Inti- 
mately related to the problem of raising the standards 
of the teaching personnel is the question of financing 
education. Taken in the aggregate, the money cost of 
supporting public schools in our country reaches a 
huge sum each year, —in 1920 almost a billion and a 
quarter dollars.| This includes only the actual money 
expended from public funds for the support of public 
education, for payments made during the year on new 
buildings and equipment, and for interest on borrowed 
money. It does not include the interest on the total 
investment in public-school buildings and equipment. 
While it includes the cost of higher education in tax- 
supported institutions, it takes no account of the ex- 
penditures of church, endowed, and private schools; nor 
does it, of course, include the expenditures made by 
parents for the books, supplies, and other equipment 
which pupils must have, or for their expenses for board, 
lodging, and transportation when they do not live a 
home. If we were to make a rough approximation t

all of these unrecorded costs, we should find that the 
total investment of the American people in education 
each year can be scarcely less than two billion 
dollars. 
On the other hand, it should be remembered that 
our population is a huge population, and that the sum- 
total of the nation’s wealth has a corresponding magni- 
tude. Even though we are investing some two billion

wealth;! and it means only about three per cent of our 
total yearly income.? 
Education essentially an investment. — It should be 
remembered, too, that the money expended for educa- 
tion is essentially an investment. The outlay is returned 
to society with ever-increasing dividends. Generally 
speaking, the states that made the largest per capita 
expenditures for schools a generation and two genera- 
tions ago are to-day the most prosperous states; the 
states that were backward educationally a generation 
or two generations ago are to-day the least prosperous 
states. These facts in themselves do not prove that 
the investment of public money in public schools brings 
a return in kind, but when this evidence is considered 
in the light of a multitude of other facts, the testimony 
is overwhelming.* Good schools and material prosperity 
stand to one another as cause to effect. 
The sources of school funds. — The public schools of 
the United States are supported chiefly by taxation 
within the local unit. In many of the states, the ‘‘unit”’ 
is the school district; in other states (particularly in 
New England) it is the town; in a few states, it is the 
Congressional township;* and in most of the southern 
states it is the county. All of the states provide some- 
1 According to Miss Newcomer’s monograph (op. cit., p. 36)) the total 
state and local educational expenditures in 1920 amounted to 0.4 per cent 
of the nation’s wealth. 
2 The national income for 1922 has been estimated at $59,000,000,000 and 
the total national wealth at $320,803,862,000. 
3See an article entitled, ‘‘Do Good Schools Pay?” in the Journal of the 
National Education Association, June, 1923. 
«The Congressional township is typically an area six miles square, and is 
so called because Congress in providing in the Land Ordinance of 1785 for 
the survey of the western lands found this a convenient unit of area with which 
to deal. The ‘‘towns” of the New England states are similar areas, but they 
vary in size and in shape. As units of school taxation and control, however, 
the “town” and “township” are practically identical in their significance.

as a whole, 78 per cent of the cost of maintaining public 
schools is met by taxation within the local unit (whether 
district, town, township, or county); 14 per cent is 
borne by general state taxation; 2.7 per cent comes from 
interest on permanent funds and the rental of school 
lands;! and 5.2 per cent from various other sources. 
Until very recently, the Federal government has not 
contributed from its tax-revenues to the annual expense 
of maintaining public schools, although from the outset 
it has donated public lands to newly admitted states as 
an endowment for public schools and since 1890 it has 
made money-grants for the support of State agricul- 
tural colleges. Under the terms of the Smith-Hughes 
Act, passed in 1917, a maximum? of $7,000,000 may be 
distributed among the states each year to encourage 
vocational education in the high schools. Thus a very 
small part of the cost of maintaining public schools is 
now met from Federal tax-revenues. 
Inequalities and inequities in school support. — The 
American public school, then, depends chiefly upon 
1 One of the most interesting chapters in the history of American education 
is that which concerns the school lands and the permanent school funds of 
the several states. In the Land Ordinance of 1785, Congress provided that 
one section (640 acres) in each township should be set aside for the support 
of schools. In every state that has been created from the public domain 
(that is, from the lands owned by the United States as a whole), this provision 
for public schools has been made. An additional section was provided in the 
states admitted from 1848 on, and in the case of Utah four sections in each township were reserved as school lands. The permanent state school funds 
of most of the western states have been formed chiefly from the sale of these 
lands, while states that have not sold their school sections derive part of their 
school revenues from the rental of the lands. For a brief account of this 
and of other sources of permanent public-school funds, see Keith and Bagley’s 
The Nation and the Schools, Macmillan, 1920, chs. ii, iii, iv, vi, and vii. 
much more detailed and comprehensive study of the problem will be found in 
Swift’s Permanent Public Common-School Funds, Holt, 1911. The author of 
the latter volume, Fletcher H. Swift (born 1876) has made several important contributions to the study of the history of education. He has been a pro- 
fessor in the University of Minnesota since 1909.

local support for its maintenance and its progress. This 
means that there will be striking inequalities among the 
schools not only throughout the country but within 
each state. Writing in 1922, George D. Strayer! made 
the following contrasts: 
“The states vary greatly in their ability to support education, 
From the latest available data the true wealth per capita is found 
to vary in the several states from $726 to $5038. The contrast 
is quite as startling if the true wealth per pupil enrolled in schools 
is taken. Here the variation runs from $2561 to $19,377.” 2 
The variations in taxable wealth in a single state are 
typically illustrated by the diagram*® (page 304), which 
compares fifteen counties in Pennsylvania with reference 
to the amount of wealth that can be taxed for school 
purposes in proportion to the number of children in 
each county. 
Within a county, too, there are obvious inequalities 
of taxable wealth. Generally speaking, the cities and 
towns will have larger resources in proportion to the 
population than will the open-country districts. Be- 
tween adjoining open-country districts, indeed, there 
may be wide differences in taxable wealth, — as when, 
for example, one district has within its borders rich 
alluvial lands, mineral deposits, coal mines, oil wells, or

1 The inequities involved in the wide variations among communities with 
respect to their ability to support schools were first clearly pointed out by 
Dr. E. P. Cubberley in his monograph, School Funds and Their Apportionment 
(1905). Dr. Cubberley (born 1868) is one of the most, distinguished contem- 
porary students of education. For more than twenty-five years he has been a 
teacher in Leland Stanford, Jr., University. He is the author of Public School 
Administration, (Houghton Mifflin, 1915), Public Education in the United 
States (same publishers, 1919), and numerous other books.

EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 305 
communities for the support of schools have led to vari- 
ous proposals aimed toward an “equalization of educa- 
tional opportunity.’ These proposals are based on the 
belief that a democracy which depends for its safety 
and progress upon the trained intelligence of all of its 
citizens cannot afford to let any child within its borders 
suffer from inadequate schooling. Under this theory, 
the child in a remote and isolated rural school is just as 
significant to the welfare of the state as a whole as is 
the child in a rich and prosperous town or city. In 
short, every child is either an asset or a liability to 
society as a whole. In so far as education can change 
liabilities into assets, it is to the advantage of society 
as a whole to make the investment. 
The solution of the problem is best sought, it is gen- 
erally believed, through the establishment of larger 
taxing units for school purposes. A town or township 
tax tends to equalize educational opportunities among 
the school districts of the town or the township; a 
county tax tends toward a similar equality among all 
the schools of the county; a state tax tends to equalize 
educational opportunities within the state. This is as 
far as the equalization theory has as yet been carried 
in this country (except for the provisions of the Smith- 
Hughes Act) but it is clear that a Federal tax would 
likewise tend to equalize educational opportunity among 
the several states. 
1 Probably the clearest expression of the principle of equalization is to be 
found in G. D. Srraymr and R. M. Hata: The Financing of Education in the 
Staie of New York (report of the Educational Finance Inquiry Commission), 
p. 173. Macmillan, 1923. “There exists to-day and has existed for many years a movement which 
has come to known as the ‘equalization of educational opportunity’ or 
the ‘equalization of school support.’. .. In its most extreme form the in-

Units of control: The local unit.— Just as the sup- 
port of public schools is largely provided by the local 
community, so the control of schools is chiefly in the 
hands of local school boards the members of which are 
usually chosen by the voters of the community, except 
in some cities, where school-board members are ap- 
pointed by the mayor. In most of the southern states, 
the control of all schools within a county is delegated 
to a county board of education. 
The state as a unit of control. — Legally, the control 
of public education in our country is one of the ‘“‘sov- 
ereign powers”’ reserved to each of the states, and the 
local control which actually operates does so merely 
because most of the states have delegated this sovereign 
power to the smaller units. Gradually certain elements 
of control are being brought back to the state as such. 
In most instances to-day the educational authorities 
representing the state as a whole license or certificate 
the teachers, — sometimes all of the teachers, more fre- 
quently only those desiring the higher grades of certi- 
ficates. The states, too, as a rule make certain uniform 
requirements with regard to the minimal length of 
school term. In some cases, the educational authorities 
of the states have the power to condemn school buildings 
terpretation is somewhat as follows: The state should insure equal educational 
facilities to every child within its borders at a uniform effort throughout the 
state in terms of the burden of taxation; the tax-burden of education should throughout the state be uniform in relation to tax-paying ability, and the 
provision for schools should be uniform in relation to the educable popula- 
tion desiring education. Most of the supporters of this proposition, however, 
would not preclude any particular community from offering at its own ex- 
pense a particularly rich and costly educational program. They would insist 
that there be an adequate minimum everywhere, the expense of which should} 
be considered a prior claim on the state’s economic resources.’

when these are unsafe or insanitary, to provide for 
courses of study that will be uniform throughout the 
state, and (more rarely) for uniform textbooks. All of 
the states have laws requiring the compulsory atten- 
dance at school of all children between certain ages, 
usually between eight and fourteen. These laws vary 
widely with regard to length of time that such children 
shall attend school each year, and they also vary widely 
in the rigor with which they are enforced. Generally 
speaking, compulsory-attendance laws throughout the 
country are well enforced in the large cities; except 
in a few states the enforcement of these laws in the 
villages and rural districts is extremely lax. 
The relation between support and control. — The in- 
terest of each local community in the schools that are 
provided for its children is obviously an important 
factor in determining the efficiency of the schools, and 
it is clear that some measure of local responsibility for 
schools is one important means of insuring local interest 
in schools. Throughout our national history, however, 
the principle of local or neighborhood autonomy has 
been in conflict with the ever-increasing need for stronger 
state governments. At the present time, the conflict is 
erhaps most in evidence in the field of education. 
e traditions and prejudices of the people are in favor 
f the local support and local control of schools; but 
he local support of education results in glaring inequali- _ 
ies of educational stimulus and opportunity, as we have 
ust seen. Poor schools anywhere in a state impede the 
rogress of the state as a whole; poor schools in any 
tate impede the progress of the nation as a whole.

  308 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
How shall the problem be solved? Is it possible to 
have larger units of school support which will tend to 
equalize educational opportunity and still retain the 
virtues that lie in the local control of schools? 
The solution: Relatively smali units of control; large 
units of taxation. — There is a general conviction among 
students of the problem that this adjustment is thor- 
oughly feasible. It is not seriously proposed in any 
state to have the control of public schools entirely cen- 
tralized in the state education department. This would 
mean that the state authorities would not only license 
teachers, but also appoint them; that they would build 
and own all school buildings; that they would control 
the courses of study and the textbooks; and that the 
people of each local community would have nothing 
to say about their own schools except through their 
representatives in the governing bodies of the state. 
There is a general belief that so extreme a form of 
centralization would mean a deadening uniformity that 
would stifle the interest of the people in the schools 
that their children attended; and that consequently 
whatever improvements centralized control might bring 
would be more than counterbalanced by this negative 
factor. And if this is true of state control, it is clear, 
that anything even remotely approaching a national 
control of education in this country is unthinkable.    
     
                             
   
   
     
   
   
    
      
     1 Anything approaching the control of public-school education by th 
Federal government would be impossible without an amendment to th 
Constitution. The Federal government has only those powers that ar 
explicitly granted to it by the several states, and the Tenth Amendment. 
adopted in 1791, makes the following provision: ‘The powers not delegate 
to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, 
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” The Constitutio: 
nowhere contains a reference to education; not even the word is mentione
-P-A-G-E-321
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 309 
The policy that the states have adopted is to con- 
tribute through general state taxation to the support 
of local schools, still leaving the local communities free 
to control the schools except as to fulfilling a few fun- 
damental standards such as have already been referred to. 
The policy of the Federal government in so far as its 
recent small cash contributions to the support of edu- 
cation are concerned has been to require that the 
states, as a condition of accepting the Federal money, 
appropriate from their own funds a similar amount for 
the same purposes. Thus participation in the support 
of local education has been established by most of 
the states without involving a measure of centralized 
control that will check in any way local initiative and 
local responsibility, and the precedent has been set for 
a similar participation by the nation that will in no 
way encroach upon the sovereignty of the several states. 
       
    
               
   
     
   
       
     
     PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OF TEACHERS 
No account of American educational systems would be 
even relatively complete without a reference to the work 
hat is being done by voluntary organizations of teachers. 
‘hese organizations have increased very remarkably in 
umber and in influence with the development of a rela- 
ively permanent teaching-personnel for the public 
chools and with the progress of professional education

me cases the association enrolls a large proportion of 
e public-school workers of the state. Many of the state
-P-A-G-E-322
  310 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
associations employ full-time secretaries and publish 
their own journals.!. Almost without exception, the 
state associations have legislative committees which pro- 
pose laws for the betterment of the schools and carefully 
scrutinize all proposed measures that affect education. 
Many of the state associations are now so large that 
the members can no longer hold a single annual meeting 
(chiefly for the reason that few cities have hotel accom- 
modations or auditoriums sufficient for the numbers 
attending). As a result the tendency is to divide the 
association into sections representing various areas of 
the state. Each sectional organization or division elects 
delegates to attend the state meeting, which thus be- 
comes a representative body concerning itself largely 
with the consideration of' general policies related to the 
welfare and progress of education in the state as a whole. 
In some cases this division is carried still further, and 
branches of the state association are organized in coun- 
ties and in local communities. Often, too, county and 
local organizations are formed quite independently of 
the state associations. 
1The development of educational periodicals has been an importan‘ 
chapter in American education. The progress of the public-school movemen‘ 
in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was profoundly influenced b; 
The American Journal of Education, which was established in 1855 by Henr: Barnard (1811-1900), and which was edited by him and published largely aj 
his own expense over a period of twenty-five years. WHarlier in his life, Barnard 
had been Secretary of the Connecticut State Board of Education, and rendere: to that state services quite analogous to those that Horace Mann (see foot] 
note, p. 11) rendered to Massachusetts. In 1867 he became the first Feder: 
commissioner of education. By far the most notable figure to-day in America 
educational journalism is Albert Edward Winship (born 1845), who becam 
editor of the New England Journal of Education (later the Journal of Educatio 
in 1888. Dr. Winship has made it a practice to keep in close touch with schoo! 
throughout the country, and undoubtedly has a far more extensive first-hai 
acquaintance with American education than has any other person. He 
been a powerful factor in welding the teachers of the country into a uni 
profession and in discovering and recognizing meritorious work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-323

National organizations. — The fact that public edu- 
cation in America is almost entirely under state and 
local control (see pp. 306.) would suggest at first glance 
that there is little unity of educational effort among the 
several states. This inference is in many ways unwar- 
ranted. While there is no official system! of education 
for the nation as a whole, there is a large measure of 
unified action which has brought about a desirable uni- 
formity in aims and materials without involving the 
deadening uniformity which often goes with a highly 
centralized official organization.2. This has been one of 
the most notable achievements of American education, 
and it has been made possible chiefly through the 
national organizations of public-school workers. 
The National Education Association. The largest 
organization of teachers in the world is the National 
Education Association of the United States. This was 
founded as the “‘National Teachers Association’’ in 
1857, and assumed its present name in 1907 when it was 
incorporated under a special act of Congress. Originally 
an annual gathering of a few educational leaders, it has 
during the past thirty years extended its membership to 
include larger and larger representations of classroom 
t Note that the title of this chapter is not “The School System,” but 
“School Systems.” Legally, there are forty-eight school systems, each repre- 
senting a state. 
? The advantage of a certain measure of uniformity will be apparent from 
sions in the earlier chapters (especially chs. ii, ili, and iv) which »mphasized the importance of a “community of culture” as a basis for estab- 
lishing the “social binders” which hold large groups together in a unit. The 
belief of most American students of education is that this essential uniformity ican be attained without identical programs and policies in all of the states, and 
ithout what would be in any official way a national school system. The 
ublic-school workers of the country, however, are overwhelmingly in favor 
f such a degree of official national leadership in education as would be pro- 
ided by the creation of a Federal department of education the head of which ould be a Secretary of Education who would have a seat in the President’s 
Jabinet.

Other national organizations. — A large number of 
national organizations devoted to education are inde- 
pendent of the National Education Association, although 
many of them coéperate with the Association in its efforts 
to promote educational progress. In some of the larger 
cities, the classroom teachers are organized in unions and 
these unions form a national organization, the American 
Federation of Teachers, which is affiliated with the 
American Federation of Labor.' College and university 
teachers have a national organization which likewise 
excludes the administrative personnel, but which is not 
affiliated with organized labor. Of very large importance, 
too, are: the National Society for the Study of Educa- 
tion, which meets annually and publishes a series of year- 
books which have had a marked influence on educational 
development; the national associations of teachers of 
English, of science and mathematics, and of history; 
and the national organizations for the promotion 
of various specific types of education, such as rural 
education, vocational education, physical education, 
art education, and the like. Many of these organ- 
izations publish monthly journals devoted to the prob- 
lems of their respective fields.2 In spite of the official 
decentralization of education, then, many forces work 
together to unify educational efforts.

is a federation of this kind. It enrolls upward of 100,000 teachers. In the 
United States as well as in England, organized labor has given powerful support 
to the movement for better public-school facilities. 2 For example, The English Journal, School Science and Mathematics, The Historical Outlook, The Journal of Vocational Education, The Journal of Rural

  314 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
QuzsTIoNs, Tat AND PROBLEMS 
1. Classify the schools and colleges with which you are familiar 
according to the scheme outlined in this chapter. 
2. Make a list of the arguments for and against the provision 
of free, tax-supported schools for liberal education on the secondary 
level. On the collegiate level. 
3. All of the states offer professional education for prospective 
teachers without making a charge for tuition. Tuition is also either 
free or very low in the State agricultural colleges. On the other 
hand, some of the State niversitiad dias substantial tuition-fees 
in their colleges of medicine and law. What, if any, is the justifica- 
tion for these distinctions? 
4. Find how much it costs to maintain each year the institution 
that you are attending. Divide by the number of students enrolled 
and find the per capita cost of maintenance in terms of each student. 
Add to this an estimate of the personal expenses (tuition, books, 
supplies, board, lodging, travel, etc.) that you incur each year be- 
cause of your attendance at the school. What proportion of the 
total is being borne by you and your parents, and what proportion 
is being borne by the public in its support of your school (whether 
through taxation or voluntary gifts)? 
5. How would you answer a person who objected to paying school 
taxes on the ground that he had no children of his own and that 
consequently he received no benefit from public money spent on 
free schools? How would you justify taxing all of the communities 
of a state in proportion to their wealth for the education of all the 
children of the state? Would it be just to tax all of the states of 
the Union in proportion to their wealth for the education of all of 
the Nation’s children? 
6. Find where your state stands in comparison with other states 
as to the proportion of children of school age enrolled in public 
schools, the average length of the school term, the average daily 
attendance, the proportion that high-school enrollment bears to 
total enrollment, and the public expenditures for school per capita 
of the total population. (All of these data will be found in the 
annual reports of the United States Commissioner of Education, and]

PERSONAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR | 
TEACHING 
Problem of the chapter. — One who enters a field of 
professional service will wish to understand, not only 
the functions that the profession attempts to discharge 
‘in the complicated organization of raodern society and 
the way in which it proceeds to discharge these func- 
tions, but also the personal qualities that are essential 
to good work in the field that has been chosen. In the 
chapters that have preceded, the former problems have 
been our chief concern; we have now in two concluding 
chapters to consider as helpfully as we can the personal 
qualifications of the teacher. 
Importance of the problem. — This problem is both 
important and difficult. It is important because teach- 
ing is essentially a personal process involving very in- 
timate personal relationships, and this is especially true 
of the teaching of boys and girls in the elementary and 
high schools. In spite of all that has been done in the 
provision of aids and devices for facilitating learning, — 
textbooks, pictures, maps, diagrams, models, apparatus, 
libraries, laboratories, shops, and gardens, — the essen- 
tial features of a school still remain the living teacher 
and the living learner. The actual contact of mind| 
‘with mind is still the fundamental factor in the edu- 
cative process.

disagreement as to the powerful and positive influence 
that a strong character may exert in the classroom. 
Difficulties presented by the problem. — The problem 
of the personal element in teaching is difficult to solve 
in part because of its complexity. Our inherited tenden- 
cies, our early environment, our school training, the 
men and women with whom we associate, the sermons 
that we hear, the books and newspapers that we read, 
and a host of other factors all combine in varying pro- 
portions and with varying degrees of influence to make 
us what we are. It is difficult in the second place be- 
cause some of the most potent of these influences strike 
very deep into impulses that we ourselves may be un-

conscious of, and into experiences that we have forgot- 
ten or do not like to recall or would never tell anyone 
else about for the world even if we did recall them; the 
facts, then, are difficult to get at, and as we have seen 
(Chapter VI) anything in the way of a scientific solu- 
tion of a problem must start with facts. A third diffi- 
culty lies in the highly resistant character of many of 
those factors in personality that can be recognized and 
the importance of which is unquestioned; we may not 
know whether these are due to heredity or to experi- 
ence, but there can be no doubt that they are pretty 
firmly fixed by the time that the individual reaches 
maturity, and that they can be changed only with the 
greatest effort if at all. 
It is well to have all of these difficulties in mind, but it 
would be most unfortunate to be permanently discour- 
aged by them. The difficulty of a problem must always 
be looked upon as a challenge to a more vigorous attack 
rather than as a summons to surrender. Scientific in- 
vestigation has not as yet given us thoroughly depend- 
able precepts and principles regarding the elements of 
personality that make for success in the work of teach- 
ing, but it has made a start and its efforts are being 
continued. It is for us to take whatever meager results 
are now available from these investigations, and — 
pending further light — “piece them out” as best we 
may through careful reflection guided by ‘‘commor 
sense” (if we possess this important exemplification of 
the very thing that we are talking about!) It is in this 
spirit and under these limitations that we shall discuss 
in this chapter the general personal qualifications of the

teacher, and in the following chapter the specific personal 
qualifications that are important in the specialized fields 
of the teaching service. 
Personal qualifications loom large in the selection and 
appointment of teachers. They are also frequently 
referred to by superintendents, superviscrs, and princi- 
pals in their efforts to “rate” teachers, — that is to as- 
sign to each teacher under their supervision a grade or 
mark that will indicate roughly his or her value to the 
school, the community, and the profession.! 
Little significance attaches to the order in which these 
qualities are listed_in the following discussion,“ exéept 
that those which seem to be the more readily amenable 
to improvement appear first.

1A pioneer study of the qualities that go to make up a ‘‘good teaching 
personality” was made by Dr. F. L. Clapp in 1913. He first secured from 
one hundred experienced superintendents and principals a list of the ten 
qualities that each judged to be the most important constituents of a good 
teaching- RPE aay He combined these judgments on the basis of the 
frequency with which each quality was mentioned, and thus obtained a list 
of the ten qualities that had, so to speak, the highest number of “vote: 
He then submitted this list to one hundred forty superintendents and princi- 
pals, and asked them to rank their five best teachers, first in the order of their 
“general teaching personality,’ and then in the order of their standing with 
refere: to each one of the ten specific qualitie: He thus secured, not only 
a combined judgment as to what successful supervisors believe ought in 
theory to make up a good teaching-personality, but also the order in which 
these qualities actually appeared in a group of teachers recognized as superior

personal appearance is mentioned on rating cards and in 
the studies that have b ‘i sonal 
qualifications. Generally speaking, the expectation is 
not that all teachers zs d-

ties, however, are justly considered to detract from a ste 
teacher’s personal influence, particularly if they are of 
such a character that the pupils become irritated or 
distracted irom, observing them. 
More important in many ways, and chiefly because 
it is relatively simple to improve them, are the factors of 
personal neatness and of good taste in dress.) Again it is 
the distracting influence either of untidiness in the person

the normal schools and teachers colleges are coming to 
give explicit attention to these factors through their

through personal conferences with student-teachers in 
the training schools. 
Health, vitality, and physical control. — The signifi- 
cance of sound health jo good work is obvious enough in 
all human callings. We are concerned here particularly 
the effect of health upon the qualities that go to 
make up a good ‘‘teaching personality,” and it is clear 
that all of the factors listed in this chapter may be 
markedly weakened by poor health. Fortunately we are 
living in an age that recognizes good health as a funda. 
mental asset, not only to the individual, but to society 
and the attention that is being given to health educatio

in all professional schools for teachers makes unneces- 
sary an extended treatment of the topic here. 
A related factor, however, is entitled to high rank 
as one of the most important qualities of an effective 
teaching-personality. One may haye perfect health and 
still fail to express ’s self i 
vigor, energy, and “‘vitality.’’ There can be little a 
that these outward indications of health and strength 
are often important in determining the subtle influence 
that personality exerts. A heavy, impassive, immobile 
countenance: is likely to be a serious handicap in any 
calling which involves direct personal relationships. 
Carriage and posture are important for the teacher in 
part because the example that is set for imitation is 
especially significant in learning to coérdinate move- 
ments. There is, too, an undefined but clearly recog- 
nized relationship between physical attitude and mental 
activity.  A&sured and confident physical control as 
expressed in the erect posture and the alert movement 
suggests mental strength and mental alertness just as’ 
clearly as the slouchy posture and the slow, uncertain 
movement suggests a lazy mind; while jerky, nervous, 
and useless movements suggest undirected or “flighty” 
mental activity. It is true that the suggestion may be 
deceptive, but its effect is in no way mitigated by its 
deceptive character. 
The voice. — Ttewould bewdificult tooverestimate.the

is well to know that such a voice can be developed by a 
great many teachers who, without attention to this 
important item in their professional equipment, would

of meaning and emphasis. The principal evils to be 
avoided or corrected are: (1) the shrill, high-pitched, 
rasping voice; (2) the unnecessarily loud or “noisy” 
voice; (3) the inarticulate voice which fails to enunciate 
distinctly; (4) the thin, feeble voice which lacks vigor 
and force; and (5) the monotonous, colorless voice which 
lulls the listener to somnolence through lack of emphasis. 
Speaking too loudly, too rapidly, and too indistinctly 
are common teaching faults. The “‘noisy’”’ voice is es- 
pecially unfortunate, for, by suggestion, it almost 
always gives rise to noise and confusion in the classroom. 
The feeble voice, the inarticulate voice, and the monot- 
onous voice are usually amenable to treatment through 
appropriate exercises a schedule of which the voice

the brightest men and women who achieve the most 
notable success in life, especially in fields that demand 
frequent and important social contacts. There are some 
recognized qualities making for success in teaching that 
ean clearly be classed as factors of social intelligence, 
and most of these have a close bearing upon the problem 
of personal qualifications. 
Address. — This quality stands first among the ten 
constituents of a good teaching personality studied by 
Dr. F. L. Clapp.’ It refers to the way in which one 
meets people, and has been found (as one would expect)

Tact. — This seems to be one of the prime qualities of 
social intelligence. While tact is a term that can 
scarcely be ome in a helpful way, it seems to be at 
basis the ability to put one’s self in another’s place, — 
a sensitiveness to the situation as it appeals to others.

4. Firm, decisive, businesslike, and strict. (59)

\ Leadership. — A most important quality under the 
general head of -BoaEl tatelcenes 4 lecdenchin Ee 
speaki e socialized recitation (pp. 206 f.) we 
noted the change from the older conception of the 
teacher as an autocrat ang ade kkmaster to the modern 
conception of the teacher’as leader, a counselor, and a 
guide. Back of this change is a fundamental transfor- 
mation in the attitude of the profession and of many 
laymen toward the pressures that should be used to in- 
cite pupils to the mental effort that learning involves. 
Compulsion and coercion in any form are coming more 
and more clearly to be discredited in school work, and 
many things that could formerly be exacted from pupils 
merely by arbitrary command must now be gained in 
another way. A favorite characterization of the ap- 
proved method is to refer to it as the “leadership” of the 
teacher. ‘Leadership,’ however, may be of various 
sorts. Just as one may simulate the fine qualities that 
rue sympathy implies, so one may very easily get others 
o do what one wishes by flattery, cajolery, or the judi- 
ious distribution of personal favors (which is one form — 
nd a most reprehensible form — of bribery). Coercion 
nd compulsion are thereby avoided, but it is very 
uestionable whether something infinitely worse has not 
aken their place. The type of leadership that the 
leacher personifies must clearly be of another sort if the

transformation of the modern school.is not to represent 
an involution backward rather than an evolution for- 
ward. It must be a leadership that depends for its 
force and effectiveness upon real strength of character 
and upon a mastery of the situation that others will 
inevitably respect, — a mastery, too, that is shot through 
with a deep and true sympathy. To achieve “leader- 
ship” in the sense of a superficial “‘popularity” is not at 
all difficult — but it is to play a game that in the end 
will not be worth the candle. 
Moral qualities. — We come, then, to the personal 
qualifications for teaching that must always be recog- 
nized, we believe, as the deepest and the most signifi- 
cant. We shall call these the “moral qualities,” but 
we have in mind something far more fundamental than 
that which is usually included under the term ‘‘good 
morals.”’ It goes without saying that the teacher should 
respect and reflect the simple but basic standards that 
have been recognized and refined through the ages as 
constituting the “‘minimal essentials” of a decent and 
refined life. But important as are these basic standards, 
to live consistently with them may involve no more than 
the absence of evil rather than the presence of a positive 
and creative virtue. It is the latter quality that we are 
emphasizing, and to some of the expressions of this| 
quality we shall now turn. 
Sincerity. — One difficulty with the qualities that wei 
listed under ‘‘social intelligence” lies in the fact tha 
they may be deceptive indices of what lies underneath. 
An engaging way of meeting people may make a goo 
impression but it may also express an apparent interes

in other people that has no fundamental reality. A tact- 
ful person, too, may let his desire to be tactful go so 
far that he has no positive convictions or opinions of 
his own; he simply finds out what other people expect 
to have said to them, and then he says it regardless 
of its truth or falsity. Sympathy, as we have seen, may 
be simulated, and a certain kind of “leadership” may 
be purchased by the bribe of flattery or favor. All of 
these arts may make for a certain kind of success in 
life, for modern civilization is highly socialized, and al- 
most every field of effort demands frequent contacts 
with others. All of these arts may make for a certain 
kind of success in teaching. The very encouragement 
that is thus given to hypocrisy, however, suggests that 
the attitude which is called sincerity should have a 
basic recognition. Of all the virtues that are important 
in life, is not this the one that strikes deepest? Cer- 
tainly of all of the virtues that are important in the 
teacher no other is so fundamental and far-reaching. 
Loyalty. — This is another sterling virtue that de- 
serves a high rank among the personal qualifications 
of the teacher. The importance of personal loyalty to 
the family, the tribe, and the clan has been recognized 
almost from the outset of social life, and the most 
primitive forms of education have sought to instill such 
loyalty in the minds of the young. It is another of those 
“social binders’? which we haye already found to be so 
important as educational objectives. It lies at the basis 
of that mutual trust and interdependence which are the 
very soul and essence of group life. Without a wide- 
spread inculcation of the ideal of loyalty, social codpera-

tion would be limited to those critical occasions when 
the need of working together is clearly necessary to 
individual survival. But a continuing society must be 
held together, not only on these critical occasions, but 
also during the intervals that separate them if the crit- 
ical occasions themselves are to be met successfully. 
The attention that has been given to the develop- 
ment of loyalty in all forms and systems of education 
suggests that this trait in all probability must be ex- 
plicitly developed if its existence is to be insured. In 
other words, even if there be an instinctive impulse 
which makes for loyalty,! this is not apparently strong 
enough or pervasive enough to be depended upon. It 
must be reinforced and strengthened by definite instruc- 
tion, training, and inspiration. It is also probable that 
loyalty is not to be regarded as a “‘general”’ trait, but 
that the real need is for the development of specific 
types of loyalty. 
What are some of these specific loyalties that are 
needed in teaching? Quite obviously, the first and fore~ 
most is a whole-hearted devotion to those for whom one 
is responsible. The primary duty of the teacher is to 
his pupils or students. Their needs and their best 
interests must receive his first consideration. This 
loyalty, too, must be just as impartial as it is possible 
to make it. 
_ There are many ways in which this specific kind of loyalty ex- 
presses itself. Many if not most teachers take a deep, personal 
interest in their pupils, and desire earnestly and sincerely to help 
them. Sometimes, however, this desire seems to be thwarted on 
1See the discussion of “social instincts,” Chapter VII.

QUALIFICATIONS FOR TEACHING 329 
every side, and the teacher becomes cynical and depressed, perhaps 
giving an unfortunate expression to his or her feelings in sarcasm 
and ridicule. At other times, individual pupils may resent just and 
reasonable demands and thus cultivate a marked dislike for the 
teacher which the latter is tempted to return in kind. It is in situa- 
tions akin to these that the ideal of loyalty must be consciously and 
explicitly directed toward the control of the teacher’s conduct and 
feelings. Above all, it is necessary to keep the personal element 
from operating in a negative way. Personal devotion there must be, 
but personal dislikes and prejudices must be ruthlessly read out of 
the problem. 
Another important expression of the ideal of loyalty is in the care 
with which the teacher avoids “gossiping” about his or her pupils. 
The knowledge that a teacher has of the weaknesses of those who 
are intrusted to his or her care is a privileged knowledge, quite akin 
to the knowledge that the physician has regarding the physical con-~ 
dition of his patients, or the knowledge that the lawyer has regarding 
the business affairs of his clients. It is a fundamental ethical prin- 
ciple of the professions of medicine and law that such knowledge 
must be held inviolate, and physicians or lawyers who are unfaithful 
to this trust are not only discredited but may even be denied the. 
right to practice their professions. Equally rigorous standards are 
clearly applicable to the profession of teaching. 
A second specific type of loyalty is that which safe- 
guards the integrity of the system in which the teacher 
works. This includes, first, loyalty to duly constituted 
authority as this is represented in the officers of the 
school system. Such loyalty may be personal, but it 
is essentially something more than personal, and is ur- 
gently necessary even when personal loyalty for one 
reason or another has been sacrificed. It should never — 
be interpreted to mean that the teacher should silently 
acquiesce in policies and practices that he or she knows 
to be wrong; it does mean, however, that a refusal to 
   
-P-A-G-E-342
  330 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
| 
work in harmony with the system should be open and 
above-board and not silent and insidious. 
Expressions of a most unfortunate type of disloyalty are some- 
times found among teachers who otherwise may be not only very 
efficient but thoroughly high-minded. The local control of most 
American schools distinctly encourages some most unfortunate prac- 
tices of this sort. Recognizing the power that certain members of 
the community may exert in school affairs, the teacher is often 
tempted to secure advancement in the system by cultivating the 
favor of these influential people. Sometimes he will ‘go over the 
heads” of his principal and superintendent and gain the ear of a 
member of the school board. This is a quite different thing from 
appealing to the school board against some ruling or policy that the 
school officials have set forth. The latter is a thoroughly legitimate 
step to take, but it should be taken in accordance with regularly con- 
stituted procedure. Members of school boards have no authority 
over the schools as individuals, and for teachers to deal with such 
members as individuals is a direct violation of the plainest ethical 
principles. The offense is compounded if such dealings are carried 
on ‘in the dark,’”’ so to speak. 
Another frequent expression of disloyalty is in yielding to the 
temptation to curry favor with one’s pupils by taking their side in 
little conflicts with those in authority. The principal or the super- 
intendent may find it necessary, for example, to make some rule 
or restriction which the pupils do not like. The teacher in announe- 
ing the fact or in commenting upon it may say that this is not his 
rule and imply that, if he were in the position of authority, he would 
not make it. The element of disloyalty in action of this sort is 
obyious enough when one stops to consider it, and the function of 
a well-developed ideal of loyalty is to insure that one will consider it.    
   
                           
      
             
   
     Loyaity to one’s fellow-workers is an indispensable 
factor in a smoothly working social order. Effective 
codperation, as has been suggested; depends upon mutual 
trust, and anything that promotes envy, suspicion, or|
-P-A-G-E-343
  
QUALIFICATIONS FOR TEACHING — 331 
other forms of distrust is likely to play havoc with an 
enterprise that depends upon codperative effort. 
Conspicuous examples of the spirit of loyalty to one’s fellow- 
workers are found in the readiness with which teachers recognize 
good work in other teachers, especially in speaking of such work to 
their pupils or to members of the community. On the other hand, 
there is strong temptation sometimes indirectly or even explicitly to 
call attention to one’s own efficiency by contrasting it with what one 
considers the inefficiency of others. As classes pass from grade to 
grade, their weaknesses are likely to be attributed to the teachers 
who had charge of them last year or the year before last. In some 
instances, this claim may have some justification in fact, but so many 
other factors may have entered into the situation, and the human 
tendency to blame others for one’s own shortcomings is so strong, 
that the best course is plainly one that avoids most circumspectly 
anything that smacks of gratuitous criticism. 
A final type of specific loyalty is that which is repre- 
sented by fidelity to the ideals of the profession and a 
firm faith in the cause that it serves. Educational prog- 
ress is coming to depend in an increasing measure upon 
the plans and policies that the profession of teaching 
constructs, indorses, and sets forth clearly to the public. 
The profession cannot impose its plans and policies upon 
the public, and it should not if it could. It must con- 
struct and propose educational policies, however, for 
it comprises the men and women who have the most 
‘intimate acquaintance with educational problems, — the 
men and women whose experience and training qualify 
them to recognize these problems and to devise methods 
for their solution. A real responsibility rests upon 
teachers as a group, then, to work steadfastly and in- 
telligently toward the improvement of schools and the 
betterment of conditions under which school work is done. 
         
                                       
    
          
-P-A-G-E-344
  332 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
| 
A corresponding duty rests upon each member of the pro- 
' fession to do his share in this great collective enterprise. 
Loyalty to the profession, however, strikes deeper 
than active participation in professional councils, im- 
portant as this is. As has just been said, the public 
must acquiesce in the decisions of the profession if these 
decisions are to be fully effective. Acceptance by the 
public of the proposals that the profession makes will 
depend in part upon the clarity with which the pro- 
posals are set forth and upon their inherent reasonable- 
ness and value. It will depend just as much upon the 
confidence that the public has in the profession, and the 
work of every teacher is important in determining the 
measure and strength of this confidence. Professionally- 
minded teachers recognize this responsibility. They 
know that good work wherever done contributes to the 
good repute of their profession. They know, too, that 
the individual teacher’s faults and shortcomings are 
likely to be charged up against the profession as a whole. 
What the average citizen thinks of the teaching pro- 
fession is almost certain to be determined by what he 
thinks of Miss A, and Mr. B, and Mrs. C, who happen 
to be either the teachers of his children or persons whom 
for other reasons he has come to know personally. Ina 
great many cases, they are the teachers whom he knew 
in his own school days. The “public estimate”’ of the 
teaching profession is nothing but the combined and 
collective opinion of some millions of average citizens 
each of whom is thinking of the teaching profession in 
terms of these concrete personalities. Whenever two 
thirds or three fourths of the teachers in our schools   
-P-A-G-E-345
QUALIFICATIONS FOR TEACHING — 333 
do work that commands the respect and commendation 
of two thirds or three fourths of the “average citizens” 
with whom they come in contact, especially through 
their pupils, there will be no question regarding the 
willingness of the public to acquiesce in any reasonable 
proposal that the profession may make. 
It should be insisted upon that the greatest service that the indi- 
vidual teacher can render his or her profession is to do passing well 
the work that he is employed to do. It is sometimes said that teachers 
must be “good mixers” and through this quality achieve social 
popularity to the end that they may enhance the respect that the 
public has for the profession. That teachers will find it to their 
professional advantage to know people outside of their own group 
and to have social contacts with these people is obvious enough, 
for this will keep their experience from becoming too narrowly cir- 
cumscribed, and it will tend in a measure to offset whatever dis- 
advantage there may be in continually dealing with immature minds. 
It is also advantageous to the school system to have its teachers 
mingle in the social life of the community. But the kind of trust 
that the teaching profession needs most is not of the extrinsic kind 
that might be purchased by personal popularity and good-fellow- 
ship. The kind of trust needed is that which rests upon the re- 
cognition of good work well done. No amount of “jollying” 
on the part of engineers, let us say, could compensate for a bridge 
that “buckled and broke” or for a dam that gave way to the first 
flood; and no amount of personal popularity on the part of physi- 
cians could offset professional inefficiency. If the public respects the 
professions of engineering and medicine, it is primarily because indi- 
vidual engineers and physicians by the thousands have convinced - 
individual “average citizens” that they know their business and 
ean do well the work that they are expected to do. 
The adjustment of conflicting loyalties, and the resulting 
importance of standards of professional ethics. — In meet- 
ing the complicated situations which the work of teach- 
   
-P-A-G-E-346
  
o AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
ing involves, there will be occasions when one is in 
ceo doubt as to the course that one should follow. 
Loyalty to one’s pupils may seem to conflict with loyalty 
to the school system or to one’s fellow-workers, while 
one or another of these specific types of loyalty may 
seem to conflict with more general loyalties, — loyalty 
to one’s friends, or to one’s family, or to the state, or 
to the nation, to say nothing of such fundamental 
standards as loyalty to truth, or to democracy, or to 
humanity. While decisions on these important ques- 
tions will almost always rest with the individual, the 
profession as a whole can be of real service to all of 
its members by formulating definite standards of pro- 
fessional conduct based upon a careful study of the 
- situations in which fundamental conflicts most frequently 
appear. These standards form the “codes of profes- 
sional ethics” typical examples of which have been 
worked out and published by several teachers’ organi- 
zations. Their careful study should be an important 
part of the professional education of all teachers. 
_ Summary: the cultivation of the general personal 
qualifications for teaching. — The foregoing discussion 
emphasized the personal qualifications for teaching 
somewhat distinct from the qualifications that are 
involved in a mastery of materials and a mastery of 
technique. The importance of the personal qualifica- 
tions is attested by the almost invariable custom of 
those employing teachers to inquire first of all as to 
e ‘“‘personality”’ of the candidates. It is also attested 
y the frequency with which these personal qualifica- 
ons appear on the rating-scales that are used to judge

    the success of teachers. The basie significance of the 
personal qualifications, however, lies in the fact that 
teaching and learning involve at their best the direct 
contact of mind with mind; they are essentially and 
fundamentally social and personal processes. It is pos- 
sible in theory to consider educational materials as if 
they existed in and for themselves. It is possible in 
theory to consider the technique of teaching as an 
impersonal art. In actual practice, however, neither 
the subject-matter of instruction nor the technique of 
imparting this subject-matter to the learner can be 
easily separated from the actual, concrete personality 
of the teacher. It is through the living teacher that 
the subject-matter becomes for the learner something 
that is alive and growing rather than something that 
is dead and inert;! and even though the teacher may be 
“letter-perfect”’ in his technique of presentation, the 
effectiveness of his teaching will depend in very large 
part upon the human qualities that have been discussed 
in this chapter. 
In how far these personal qualities are amenable to 
improvement through conscious instruction and train- 
ing, through self-discipline, and through the inspiration 
of example is an open question; but there are innu- 
merable evidences that teachers can and do grow in 
1 Learning from books is not a complete exception to this rule. The books 
that wield the greatest influence are unquestionably those that reveal. most 
faithfully the personality of their writers. One may easily recognize in books 
many of the personal qualities that we have found to be important in teaching, 
— tact, sympathy, sincerity, and loyalty. In writing as in teaching, the “col- 
orless’’ personality is handicapped no matter how comprehensive may be 
the knowledge that is revealed and no matter how thoroughly well the “‘style”’ 
of revealing it may conform to the standards of technique. The most suc- 
cessful writers are those who in their writings are best able to create the 
illusion of direct, personal contact with the reader.

the ‘‘power of personality.’”’ The qualities that were 
discussed under the head of personal appearance, phys- 
ical control, health, and vitality can in many cases be 
very definitely influenced by appropriate training. Re- 
garding the elements that make up the important com- 
plex that we have called ‘‘social intelligence”’ there is 
less certainty, although such qualities as address and 
tact are not entirely beyond one’s control. Regarding 
the moral qualities there is abundant room for hope. 
Even upon so fundamental a quality as sincerity, a 
positive influence may be exerted by precept, example, 
and self-discipline. 
Improvement through “ self-rating.’’ — Perhaps the most 
definitely helpful suggestion that has been made up to 
the present time with reference to the improvement of 
personality is one which recommends a “self-rating” 
plan. This was first seriously proposed a few years ago 
by Dr. Harold Rugg.! and its possibilities have been ex- 
plored and extended with a marked degree of success 
by Dr. Charters? in connection with his study of the 
problems of training for salesmanship. The procedure 
is relatively simple. The individual makes a list of the 
desirable qualities of personality, and then compares 
imself with others of his acquaintance, giving himself 
“grade” or “‘mark” which indicates his own estimate 
f his relative standing as equal to, better than, or 
orse than the average in respect to each quality. If

  338 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
he wishes to do so, it will be helpful for him to “check” 
the reliability of his own estimates by conferring with 
one or more persons who know him well, and who are 
in a position to make a frank and fair judgment. By 
thus analyzing his weaknesses and points of strength, 
he will be in a position to work far more intelligently 
than would otherwise be possible toward a correction 
of the weaknesses and a further strengthening of those 
qualities in which he already excels. 
Whether or not the student who is planning to enter 
teaching adopts this self-rating plan, he will do well to 
seek frank advice with reference to the improvement of 
the personal qualifications for teaching, and to enter 
hopefully and resolutely upon the program of train- 
ing and self-discipline that his counselors may suggest. 
Such advice, it is clear, must be largely individual in 
its character, and based upon as careful an analysis as 
can be made of the elements of strength and weakness 
that the individual reveals. The importance of this 
personal service is now distinctly recognized by the pro- 
fessional schools for teachers, and with the intensive 
study of the problem that is going on throughout the 
country, there is every prospect that this important 
phase of the teacher’s equipment will receive adequat 
attention. What we wish especially to urge here is th 
active interest of the student in the problem and hi 
codperation in the measures that are being taken fo 
its solution. 
The misuse of a “strong personality.” — This sectio 
should not be concluded without a word of warnin

    vasive personality may be used for unworthy ends, — 
and especially for ends the unworthiness of which is 
not at all apparent at first glance. Miss Frances More- 
house in her book, The Discipline of the School,' calls 
attention to the pitfalls that beset the teacher who, 
through a generous endowment of personal charm and 
other likable qualities, finds it easy to win very quickly 
the affections of his or her pupils. The strong tempta- 
tion is for such a teacher to depend exclusively upon 
this factor both in matters of discipline and in securing 
from the pupils the effort essential to effective learning. 
The results may seem to be most commendable as long 
as the personal influence of the teacher remains to sus- 
tain the good order and the interest; their disastrous 
vharacter is revealed only when this influence is with- 
drawn, — when the teacher leaves the school or when 
the pupils pass on to a higher grade. When that time 
comes, it is usually clear enough that the ‘‘strong per- 
sonality” of the teacher has actually weakened the 
pupils. They have become so thoroughly dependent 
upon this stimulus that they are unable to stand alone. 
The interest that they displayed in their lessons turns 
out to be only a borrowed interest and their good order 
is seen to have been purchased by smiles and kind words. 
The very ease with which such a teacher may misuse 
personal influence is likely to blind him to an inexor- 
able criterion of true success in teaching, — namely, the 
development of an attitude upon the part of one’s pupils 
that will make it easier and not harder for one’s suc-

that he has taught so well that those who follow him 
simply cannot ‘‘control’”’ the pupils or ‘‘interest”’ them 
is paying himself a very poor compliment.    
    
    
    
   
     
       
   Questions, Exercises, AND PROBLEMS 
1. In terms of the “personal qualifications” that are set up in this 
chapter, evaluate your previously made summary of the qualities of 
a good teacher. (See exercises suggested at end of Chapter I.) 
2. Evaluate yourself by making an estimate of your qualities on the 
rating-card reprinted on page 335. In which of these qualities have 
you within yourself the power to improve? 
3. What extracurricular activities in the life of the school which you 
attend made for or marred the development of these personal qualifi- 
cations? 
4. What cases of disloyalty among teachers have you known 
about? 
5. Reéxamine your earlier analysis (Chapter I) of the best teacher 
you have known and of the poorest teacher you have known with 
the purpose of setting forth clearly the causes for success or failure. 
6. Secure, if possible, a copy of the Rating Card of the Training 
School of the institution in which you are a student or the one used in 
some school system. Study it carefully with the idea of determining 
whether it is fair and adequate.

SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS FOR SPECIALIZED 
FIELDS OF THE TEACHING SERVICE 
In Chapter I, attention was called to the fact that 
the professional education of teachers is now specialized 
with reference to certain distinct fields or divisions of 
the teaching service; and in discussing the organiza- 
tion of school systems in Chapter X, the more impor- 
tant of these divisions were referred to. The specific 
preparation that each of these fields demands is reflected 
in the corresponding curriculum of the professional 
school. Each field, too, makes its own specific and 
peculiar demands with regard to the personal qualifi- 
cations of the teachers who are to enlist in its service. 
These may usually be regarded as intensified expres- 
sions of certain of the general qualities that have been 
discussed in Chapter XI. In some instances, however, 
qualities that have not been emphasized previously in 
our discussions will deserve attention here. 
A liking for the work of a’specific field may be a good 
index of one’s personal fitness for it.— Probably the 
best way to choose a field of work is carefully to study 
the range of possibilities that are offered, to note the 
equirements of each, and frankly to appraise one’s 
ualifications in the light of these requirements. This 
nvolyes something more than merely deciding that 
341  
-P-A-G-E-354
342 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
one is ‘‘interested’’ in a certain type of work. An em- 
ployment may interest one for reasons that are quite 
extraneous to the character of the work itself, — the 
rewards that it offers, the people with whom it brings 
one in contact, the prestige that it gives to those 
engaged in it. Young people are often attracted, too, 
by superficial characteristics behind which they do not 
see a deeper and perhaps a quite different meaning 
in terms of exacting responsibilities to be faithfully 
met, disagreeable duties to be discharged day after 
day, personal slights to be borne in silence, and irritating 
personalities to be dealt with patiently and smilingly. 
One needs, then, to ask one’s self most frankly whether 
the favored field attracts because of its extraneous 
and its superficial characteristics, or whether its attract- 
iveness is really inherent and fundamental. Only under 
the latter condition can interest be regarded as a trust- 
worthy criterion in selecting an occupation. 
Observation of and participation in the work of dif- 
ferent fields will lessen the chances of a wrong choice. 
—In most of the professional schools for teachers, care- 
fully organized courses in the observation of classwork 
will give to the student an opportunity to study the 
conditions under which the work of the various fields 
is done. In a few schools, each student serves for a 
brief period as a “‘cadet”’ in each grade or department 
of the training school:and thus, before making a final 
choice, supplements the observation by actual partici-| 
pation in the duties that each of the larger fields of th 
service demands. 
As a supplement (and perhaps to some extent as

guide) to such observation and participation, a brief 
reference may be made to the specific problems that 
each of the important fields presents. In doing this, 
it will be profitable to consider briefly the distinctive . 
function of each field of service in the general scheme 
of education, and to set forth a few of the outstanding 
characteristics of children at different stages of their 
development in so far as these suggest the specific per- 
sonal qualifications that are needed by the teacher in 
meeting the peculiar problems that each stage of devel- 
opment involves. 
The kindergarten-primary service.1— The period 
of childhood that is represented by the kindergarten and 
the first two grades of the elementary school normally 
covers the years from four or five to seven or eight. 
There are of course important differences between chil- 
dren who are four years old and children who are seven 
years old; some authorities maintain, indeed, that the 
period of life from three to six with normal children 
is fairly unique in its characteristics, while others ascribe 
distinctive characteristics to the years between six and 
eight. School practice in this country, however, has 
not tended toward a sharp division between the kinder- 
garten and the first grade; on the contrary, the recent 
developments have been toward a blending of the two 
1The development of the kindergarten in the United States received its 
first nificant impetus from Miss Susan Blow, who in 1873 accepted the 
invitation of Dr. W. T. Harris, then superintendent of the St. Louis schools, 
to establish a kindergarten in that city. The recent movement toward fusing the work of the kindergarten and the primary grades has found one of 
its strongest advocates in Miss Patty Hill, formerly supervisor of kindergar- 
tens in Louisville and, since 1905, associated with Teachers College, Co- 
lumbia University. A’prominent. student of the psychology of the kinder- garten and primary years is {Arnold Gesell (born 1880), professor of child 
hygiene in Yale University.

fields of service, in the belief that many of the methods 
employed by successful kindergartners can with profit 
be extended to the first grade and even to the second 
grade, and that some of the work formerly reserved for 
the first two grades can be undertaken earlier. 
The significance of the kindergarten-primary service 
lies in the fact that it is responsible for starting aright 
the processes of formal education. Both in its difficul- 
ties and in its opportunities, it has more than merely a 
temporal precedence as compared with other branches 
of the teaching service. The kindergarten-primary 
teacher is something more than a teacher in the usual 
sense of the term. To a far greater extent than her 
colleagues in the intermediate grades, the junior high 
school, and the senior high school, she must assume 
responsibility for the personal and physical care of her 
pupils, and when these number as many as forty or 
fifty, this responsibility in itself is likely to be a most 
serious burden. 
Interest in details. — Beyond this is the necessity for 
jnitiating a veritable host of habits, — moral and social 
habits as well as those that will form the basis of later 
attainments in the work of the school. This means an 
unremitting attention to a wide range of details, and 
the teacher who has naturally or is able to create not 
merely an interest but what one might almost call a 
passion for this detailed work of habit-building will 
find here a most fascinating field of work. 
Interest in the individual. — A marked characteristic 
of expert teachers in this field is the keen knowledge 
of individual pupils that they seem to acquire very

  SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS 345 
quickly after taking charge of a new class. Often, 
within a week’s time such teachers are able to give 
one a clear-cut description of the outstanding charac- 
teristics of every pupil. There is little doubt that the 
skill and insight necessary to this achievement grow 
with experience, but it is also clear that a deep and 
abiding interest in the individual child plays an impor- 
tant part in the development of such skill and insight. 
Intelligent patience. — Another striking characteristic 
of successful teachers of little children is their patience, — 
we qualify the term by adding the adjective “‘intelli- 
gent,” for a dull, routine, plodding patience sometimes 
masquerades in the cloak of this prime virtue. To guide 
learning in its first slow and halting steps is very far 
from an easy task for an alert adult mind, — and the 
primary teacher must have an alert mind, and this 
mind must be disciplined to patience. This again is a 
phase of the fine art of teaching that must be grown 
into, but those who are choosing a special field of serv- 
ice will do well to understand pretty thoroughly what 
this important qualification demands. It is difficult and 
exacting work — but it is doubtful whether any work 
in the entire range of human activities can surpass it 
in fundamental significance. 
A clear head and an even temper. — These qualities are 
important assets for any teacher to possess, but for the 
teacher of little children they are indispensable. A 
teacher who cannot ‘‘keep her head” when dealing with 
a large number of children who have had as yet no ex- 
perience in working together in groups, or a teacher who 
is likely to become flustered and irritable under these

conditions, cannot well succeed in this work. Further- 
more, children in this stage of their development respond 
very quickly to the emotional characteristics of parents 
and teachers. A quiet, calm, and unruffled demeanor, 
and a hopeful, happy disposition are fortunately just as 
contagious as are their opposites; and the first of these, 
at least, can be cultivated with a goodly measure of 
success. 
The emphasis of personal qualifications does not mean 
that intellectual qualifications are unimportant. — Because 
personal qualifications are so important in the kinder- 
garten-primary field many people have inferred that 
the intellectual qualifications resulting from a keen in- 
telligence richly informed through wide study are much 
less significant here than in other departments of the 
teaching service. This conclusion is far from justified. 
Many women of rare intellectual gifts and of broad 
training find the work of this field fascinating in the last 
degree, and it is not too much to say that the best kinder- 
garten-primary teachers represent this type. The very 
complexity of the problems involved demands intelli- 
gence just as clearly as the relative helplessness and 
dependence of the pupils demand sympathy; and not 
only is the technique of teaching in this field more intri- 
cate and difficult of mastery than in any other, but the 
materials of teaching, as we have already seen,' are far 
from narrow in range or limited in scope. 
The intermediate-grade service. — The ‘middle 
grades’’ of the elementary school cover what we have 
termed the ‘“‘juvenile years” of child life. Relatively

less attention has been given either to the characteristics 
of children during these years or to the educational 
problems involved than to the study of early childhood 
on the one hand and adolescence on the other hand. 
One reason for this neglect may lie in the fact that, to 
most adults, the child between the ages of eight and 
twelve is less interesting — perhaps less attractive — 
than are the younger and older children. Another reason 
for the neglect may be traced to the general belief that 
the educational problems of this period are less intricate 
and difficult than are those of the preceding and follow- 
ing periods. Whatever the reason may be, however, 
there can be no doubt that these years have. been 
seriously neglected both in educational theory and in 
school practice. 
There are good grounds for maintaining that this 
neglect is unjustified and that the intermediate grades, 
far from constituting the least important and the least 
difficult field of the teaching service, should claim a 
status second only to that of the primary grades, and in 
some respects a coérdinate rank even with these. It is 
in the intermediate grades that the largest opportunities 
for an effective mass education lie. Only a bare majority 
of the pupils who enter the first grade pass beyond the 
sixth grade, and while this proportion will undoubtedly 
be increased in the future, there is every evidence that 
the four middle grades must bear the chief burden of 
equipping each generation with those elements of the 
social heritage that will be the common possession of all. 
Nor are the juvenile years devoid of an intrinsic in- 
terest. While this may not be at the outset so appealing

  348 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
to the adult as is the interest that one so readily takes 
in little children or in adolescents, it is perhaps even 
more fascinating to those who make an intensive and 
intimate study of the juvenile child. It is during these 
years that children live a life that is more distinctly 
their own than at any other time. The more thorough- 
going dependence upon others that characterizes infancy 
and early childhood has passed. In a certain measure 
the child now stands alone, and he rejoices in his inde- 
pendence. Miss Norsworthy and Miss Whitley, in their 
Psychology of Childhood,! characterize children in the 
latter part of this period as follows: —    
   
                                                    
   “Socially, children of eleven are moving in a world made up 
mostly of their own kind, vaguely peopled with adolescents and 
younger children, occasionally touched by the orbits of adults. 
True, grown-ups are borne with in such necessary spheres as indus- 
trial and school life, are tolerated as providers of food, money, 
and other things; but on the whole they are regarded as amazingly 
far from the interests, occupations, plans, and motives of the boy 
or girl of eleven. Many adult actions and points of view are in- 
comprehensible, at best foolish, at worst unjust, and generally 
most uncomfortably non-predictable. At no [other] time may there 
be such complete mutual impatience or even misunderstanding, such 
falling foul of each other’s inclinations and guiding principles.” 
A similar reference to the outstanding characteristic 
of boys and girls in this period of their development has 
been made by G. Stanley Hall: * 
1 Naomr Norswortuy and Mary T. Wurtiey: The Pscyhology of Child- 
hood, p. 292. Macmillan, 1918. Miss Norsworthy (1877-1916) was one of 
the most remarkable teachers that America has produced. After several 
years’ experience in the public schools of New Jersey, she became a teacher 
of psychology in Teachers College, Columbia University, where she served 
from 1901 until her death in 1916. 
2Granville Stanley Hall (1848-1924) was a dominant figure in Ameri 
can education for nearly fifty years. In 1888, he became the first presiden 
of Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, and for more than a decad

“The world we live in is not theirs. We are ‘Olympians’ and 
can enforce our will because we are stronger. We must be toler- 
ated and respected ...; but the interest of children at this age 
is almost exclusively in each other, and in each other’s ways, not 
in adults. [The latter] breaks out suddenly, but just later.” 
It is because of this detachment of the juvenile child 
from the adult world that he is so difficult to understand. 
The teacher who can the most accurately reconstruct 
the attitudes and feelings of his or her own childhood 
days is probably the teacher who can get on best with 
the boys and girls of the intermediate grades. Some of 
the characteristics of such a teacher may be briefly 
referred to. 
The intermediate-grade teacher must be objectively 
minded. — This is, indeed, an awkward expression but 
it has reference to a very important trait. The teacher 
who would deal successfully with the problems of this 
period must not expect a direct and immediate return 
in the way of gratitude and regard upon the part of the 
pupils. As Dr. Hall says, ‘‘There is little sentiment and 
much selfishness bound up in the hearts of children at 
this age,”” and Miss Norsworthy and Miss Whitley,! in 
speaking of eleven-year-old children, call attention to 
some of the difficulties that the teacher must meet: 
. though the sense of ownership is well developed so far as 
their own versus their friends’ belongings are concerned, the sense 
      
    
       this institution was the leading center (really the only center) for the ad- 
vanced study of educational problems. Dr. Hall was the founder of the 
Child Study movement, a very important development in education and a 
forerunner of the present-day interest in educational science. His most 
important work is his two-volume treatise, Adolescence, published in 1904 
(Appleton). The quotation in the text is from a paper, “The Ideal School 
Based on Child Study,” published in the Proceedings of the National Educa- tion Association, 1901, pp. 474 fi.

350 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
lof honor is not yet sufficiently generalized to make them keep from 
meddling with the property of older members of the family, adults 
in general, or the public at large. Their impulsiveness, imperfect 
reasoning abilities, wide-awake energy, eagerness to be experi- 
menting, investigating, making things happen, lead them into all 
sorts of situations which to the unsympathetic adult smack of 
sheer perversity or willful mischief. Since they are not yet ad- 
vanced enough to generalize principles of conduct, orders or direc- 
tions have to be specific; these cannot usually be sufficiently 
numerous to cover all the possibilities that will suggest them- 
selves to a healthy, active child. Hence the wail from the injured 
adult, ‘Who would suppose that they would ever think of that?’ 
and from the children-culprits, ‘We weren’t ever told not to do 
that’; or, ‘How was I to know they’d object to that? Whatever 
a feller does seems wrong.’”’ 
     
     
                                         
   
   
   
    To take personally or too seriously all of the ex- 
pressions of this vibrant life of the juvenile child is 
likely to interfere very sadly with the success of the 
teacher. On the other hand, to surrender before them, 
to relax all control, and to let the spontaneous impulses 
work themselves out unhindered no matter how disas- 
trous the results, is only to seize the other horn of the 
dilemma. There is a nice balance to be maintained 
here — a balance that can be maintained only when the 
teacher is in full command of himself or of herself. 
Easily hurt feelings and an easily ruffled temper are 
scarcely conducive to such self-command. 
A good-natured and sympathetic firmness especially 
important at this time. — What has just been said sug- 
gests that the teacher who is successfully to solve the 
problems of the juvenile years must be both sympathetic 
and firm. In dealing with younger children and with) 
adolescents the gentler qualities of personality may per-

haps de something to compensate for a deficiency in 
firmness and strength of will upon the part of the teacher. 
But sentiment or any form of sentimentality is likely 
here to have a quite negative effect. Good-nature and 
good temper there must be always; but there must also 
be on the part of the teacher a real control. If it is true 
that he must have a large measure of self-command it 
is primarily because he ‘must always be in complete 
command of the situation. 
Varied interests and abilities are distinct assets to the 
intermediate-grade teacher. — Dr. Hall sums up the ideal 
qualifications of the teacher of boys and girls during 
the juvenile period in the following words: 
“Lastly, the ideal teacher at this age will be the captain of the 
child’s soul; will be able to do some things with his or her body 
that the child cannot; will be able to answer most of the questions 
suggested by the field, the forest, the beach, the street, and their 
denizens; will suggest plays and umpire games; will perhaps 
know a little of coaching, but will be a stern disciplinarian, genial 
withal, but rigorous and relentless in his exactions, and intolerant 
of all seamped work; will love occasional excursions and expedi- 
tions; will perhaps sing, play, and draw a little; will be able to 
do something expertly well; and, as perhaps the culminating qual- 
ity, will have a repertory of the greatest stories the human race 
has ever told or heard... . 
“|. Finally, the teacher should have good manners, a uniform 
disposition, much joy of life, and sympathy with just this age. 
Some persons are made to lave children in this stage most of 
als 47? 
This is truly a large order, and perhaps all of its de- 
tails should not be taken too literally. But it sets forth 
an ideal toward which one who has that final character- 
istic, “sympathy with just this age,’ may well cirect

s or her ambitions, and with results that Miss Nors- 
orthy and Miss Whitley suggest, —      “The adult who can appreciate the real motives at work in 
children, who does enter into the sport, who is serious and respect- 
ful at the right time, who is inventive enough to ‘play up,’ may 
cross a bridge over the gulf into charmed land of boy and girl 
trust, love, even adoration.” 
The upper-grade and junior-high-school service. — 
The typical child in the upper grades is in the initial 
stages of the period of adolescence. It should be remem- 
bered, however, that we are speaking only of the typical 
or normal child. In many children the changes that 
mark the beginning of pubescence do not come before 
fourteen or fifteen; in others, the changes come at 
eleven, ten, or even nine. In general northern races 
mature more slowly than southern races, and boys usually 
mature a year or two later than girls of the same race. 
Every teacher who works in the upper grades or the 
junior-high school should remember, then, that some of 
his pupils are likely to be pre-pubescent, and to have 
many of the juvenile characteristics that we described 
in the preceding section. It should also be emphasized 
that, while the physical changes coming at the outset of 
adolescence are relatively abrupt, the intellectual and 
emotional changes are probably more gradual.! 
From the point of view of the questions at issue in 
the present chapter, the most significant characteristic 
1 Among the students of adolescence and its problems may be mentioned 
G. Stanley Hall (see footnote, p. 348); M. Vincent O’Shea (born 1866), 
since 1897 a professor in the University of Wisconsin; Edwin A. Kirkpatrick 
(born 1852), since 1898 director of the department of child study in the State 
Normal School at Fitchburg, Massachusetts; Edwin D. Starbuck (born 
1866), a professor formerly at Stanford University and since 1906 at the 
State University of Iowa.

of adolescence is the transformation that takes place in 
his attitude toward life in general, and especially toward 
the adult world which he is just entering. A compact 
summary of these important changes has been prepared 
by Dr. B. C. Gruenberg! for the Federation for Child 
Study, an organization of teachers and parents associated 
with the Ethical Culture School of New York City: 
“The child’s general satisfaction with himself and his surround- 
ings gives way during adolescence under the pressure of a host 
of problems, difficulties, and maladjustments. From indifference 
to matters not immediately related to pleasures and pains, he 
plunges into intense curiosity and self-consciousness, and into real 
though spasmodic concern with the standards of adults. Curiosity 
may show itself in a great variety of normal activities; but it is 
also subject to ready perversion under unwholesome surround- 
ings. ... 
“Satisfaction with routine and drill is replaced by restlessness, 
leading often to truancy and erratic action; by doubts givi 
to religious disturbances, and by inability to concentrate for one 
upon any pursuit or undertaking. 
. The interest in other people becomes focused in friendship, 
and in loyalties to companions of his own choosing. In the same 
way the more or less habitual obedience and compliance with rules 
is replaced by a spirit of criticism and revolt against authority, 
which usually means a selection of his own leaders and his own 
ideals of conduct.” 
Miss Norsworthy and Miss Whitley also emphasize * 
learly the profound nature of this transformation: 
“Rapid physiological changes take place, and these, together 
with the probable changes in home life and the sharing of wider 
community activities, make the period peculiarly difficult to live 
through with poise. Though there is already a large system of

rganized personal habits, yet strong, intense new impulses from 
vithin, fresh customs and standards without, the new feeling of 
ndividuality and the immaturity of the will combine to provide 
rdeals that test the adolescent in all sorts of ways. . . . The whole 
boing is likely to be in a ferment from twelve to sixteen, though 
the temperamental differences are an important factor in deter- 
mining the length and intensity of the emotional activities of the 
period. The social nature is being born, as it were, at a psychic 
crisis, so that at no time is there apt to be greater disparity be- 
tween insight and power to act, between judgment and moral 
control; at no time is the moral equilibrium more easily upset.” 
     
   
    
   
                                 
    
   The development of the junior-high-school movement. — 
Educationally the years of life normally covered by the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth grades are now recognized 
as a period so significant as to demand a “unit organi- 
zation”’ for this division of the school. This recognition 
has come chiefly during the past twenty years, and may 
be traced in part to the widespread interest aroused in 
the phenomena of adolescence by the work of Dr. G. 
Stanley Hall and his associates, and especially by the 
publication of Hall’s Adolescence in 1904. For more 
than a decade before this, however, the advisability of 
recognizing the seventh and eighth school years as inte- 
gral parts of the secondary school rather than of the 
elementary school had been seriously proposed on the 
ground that many of the high-school studies, especially 
the foreign languages, are best begun at an earlier age' 
than fourteen. The question was explicitly raised in 
the famous report of the ““Committee of Ten,’’ pub. 
lished in 1893. This committee had been appointed b 
the National Education Association to investigate th 
high-school studies and make recommendations for thei:

    SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS 355 
improvement. One of the great figures in American 
education was chairman of the committee, — Dr. C. W. 
Eliot,' then President of Harvard University. 
With the awakened interest in adolescence these pro- 
posals to give more time to the high-school studies took 
another form. It now became a problem of so reorgan- 
izing the school system that the school years constitut- 
ing the adolescent period should form a separate unit.? 
As the discussion proceeded, it seemed desirable to 
recognize the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades as con- 
stituting the first stage of secondary education under 
the designation ‘‘junior high school,” leaving the tenth, 
eleventh, and twelfth grades as the “‘senior high school.” 
While this ‘‘six-three-three” plan, as it is sometimes 
called, has not yet entirely superseded the older ‘‘eight- 
four” * plan, the movement during the past ten years 
has been steadily in this direction. 
1 Charles William Eliot was born in 1834. He became president of Har- 
vard University in 1869 after several y vice as a teacher of chemistry. 
He remained im the office of president for forty years, instituting during that 
time some of the most significant forward movements in higher education, 
the most notable of which was the plan of having the students, under certain 
restrictions, choose or ‘‘elect”’ their own studies instead of following a closely 
prescribed curriculum. He was also greatly interested in elementary and 
secondary education, and was especially active in adv ing a type of educa- 
tion that would lay greater emphasis upon the direct study of nature and 
ss emphasis upon the study of records. Throughout the period of his active 
ce his “retirement” in 1909, he has shown an unflagging inter- 
t questions of the day and untirin I of public 
problems. On the occasion of his ninety, hday in 1924, he was 
ce throughout the country as the mos nguished living ‘American.

and Secondary Education Been Drawn at the Proper Point?” in The Elemen-

as for several years superintendent of schools in Saginaw, Michigan, and who

In many of the southern states, the older plan was on the “seven-four”’ 
asis, and the newer plan is either a “‘six-two-three”’ or a “‘six-five’”’ division.

  356 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The distinctive functions of the junior high school. — 
ile the desire of the Committee of Ten to have the 
high-school subjects begun earlier has found some meas- 
ure of satisfaction in the development of the junior 
high school, the movement has actually been guided by 
a more fundamental need. Psychologically, as we have 
seen, the early pubescent period is marked by a widen- 
ing of interests, a veritable expansion of the mental 
horizon. Educationally, it may profitably be recog- 
nized as an “exploratory’’ period. The school studies, 
it is believed, should stimulate and satisfy these new 
and wider interests.!_| While there may well be some 
measure of differentiation in the school program, — 
some room for choice of studies and activities, — the 
proposal sharply to classify the pupils according to 
their future occupations and to provide specialized 
training for the various groups has not gained much 
headway. It is rather felt that there is still need for 
courses that are common to all, especially in those sub- 
jects that will lay the important bases of a “common 
culture” (see Chapter IV). The distinctive functions 
of the junior high school are, then, (1) to provide a 
broad and rich foundation for the common life that all 
must lead, and (2) to discover special interests and capac- 
ities that later (and to some slight extent during this 
period) may be more fully developed through specialized 
forms of education.2. The ideals that have inspired the 
junior-high-school movement are to be realized in part

through an enlarged, enriched, and otherwise modified 
curriculum, but chiefly through a new vision and a 
keener insight upon the part of the teacher, — a vision 
and an insight that will depend primarily upon a clear 
understanding of the potent forces which the onset of 
adolescence sets free, and an appreciation of the rela- 
tion of these forces both to the development of the 
individual and to the welfare and progress of society. 
In the light of these possibilities and problems, it is 
small wonder that the early adolescent period has proved 
so fascinating a field of study, or that the school years 
represented by this period form so attractive a field of the 
teaching service. It is small wonder, too, that this field 
of service demands on the part of teachers qualifications 
that differ in important ways from those demanded in 
the preceding period. It is difficult to formulate these 
requirements in a concrete and helpful fashion, but there 
are some suggestions that follow almost as corollaries 
from the characteristics of the period itself. 
Again the need for an abiding interest and faith in the 
individual. —It is needless to say that the individual 
pupil must always be the object of chief concern to the

teacher, and we have already emphasized the intimate, 
personal knowledge that good primary teachers have 
concerning each of their charges. During the early 
adolescent years, the need for a deep personal interest 
and sympathy is no less real, but it takes a somewhat 
different form. It is the spiritual and the mental needs 
especially that must be ministered to. It is the adjust- 
ment to social forces and pressures now just beginning 
to be felt that must be directed. The newly developed 
self-consciousness of the individual, which expresses 
itself so often in awkward, incodrdinated movements, 
is paralleled on the mental side, now by bashfulness 
and reticence, and again by misdirected explosions of 
confused thinking and uncontrolled emotion. At no 
period are real encouragement and sincere appreciation 
so fruitful of good results; at no period are insensitive- 
ness and bluntness on the part of adults so poignantly 
felt and probably at no period is the lack of sympathy 
and understanding likely to be so disastrous in its 
after-effects. 
The qualities of social leadership especially significant 
at this time. —'The awakening of the social impulses 
now opens large possibilities for replacing competition 
with codperation (pp. 172 ff.) and it is here that what- 
ever capacities the teacher may have for leadership will 
find room for full play. Deftly to guide pupils in the 
formulation of collective problems and in the coépera- 
tive solution of such problems requires skill and insight 
which will accumulate and ripen only through the dis- 
cipline of experience; but even to make a fair start in 
the right direction one must probably have at least al

certain quantum of innate capacity for leadership, an 
unquestioned lack of which should make one think 
twice before undertaking service in this field. 
Breadth of outlook and of interests. — The character- 
istics of early adolescence clearly indicate that the 
teacher who is best able to “serve youth” at this time 
cannot be a narrow specialist. Knowledge there must 
be of the subjects that one essays to teach, but while 
there is a grave danger always in minimizing the im- 
portance of an intensive and thoroughgoing mastery of 
a narrow field of scholarship, it would be equally unfor- 
tunate not to recognize that the junior-high-school 
teacher needs more than this. One of the arguments 
advanced against the junior-high-school movement in 
its earlier stages was that the transfer of the seventh 
and eighth grades to the high school would tend to 
overemphasize in these grades the “teaching of subjects” 
at the expense of the ‘‘teaching of children.”’ At basis, 
of course, there should be no conflict between these two 
functions, and it is unfortunate to set one over against 
the other, as if “‘teaching children” could proceed inde- 
pendently of ‘‘teaching subjects.” On the other hand, 
it is sometimes true that the teacher’s primary interest 
is so exclusively in his subject that he completely loses 
sight of the fundamental problem of teaching, — which 
is to build his subject into the experience of the learner. 
In this sense, one may be too completely immersed in 
his subject to be a good teacher. 
Beyond this, too, is the need of a catholicity of in- 
terests that will enable the teacher to see his subject 
in the large and in its relation to other subjects.and to

human life and human problems. A most effective 
approach to any subject or topic, especially during the 
junior-high-school period, is through its applications to 
problems which appeal to the learner as significant. 
As we have seen,! it is sometimes possible to organize 
around such problems much of the knowledge and skill 
that is to be mastered, and it is clear that the teacher 
who is to utilize effectively this “project method” of 
organizing educational materials will need an equip- 
ment that extends far beyond the limits of his own 
special field. 
Coéperation with fellow-teachers. — What has just been 
said suggests that the teachers of the junior high school, 
who are in some respects specialists in their own sub- 
jects, must be able to work together each with a fairly 
complete understanding of what the others are doing. 
In the primary and intermediate grades, the pupils in 
most cases will have been in charge of ‘‘room teachers,” 
each of whom is responsible for practically all of the 
instruction that the group receives. A teacher who 
works under these conditions can readily adjust the 
various subjects to one another, and keep the program 
well balanced. When the pupils pass to the junior high 
school and are suddenly thrown into a ‘“‘departmental- 
ized” system, there is serious danger either that this 
balance will be lost or that the pupils in their attempts 
to keep up with the requirements of each subject-matter 
teacher will be confused, worried, and perhaps over- 
worked. The junior-high-school teachers must counter- 
act this danger by a kind of ‘‘team-work’’ that is needed

badly enough in all departmentalized schools, bue 
especially here. 
Willingness to share in the responsibility for extra- 
curricular activities. — The importance of the early ado- 
lescent years as a period of social awakening has led 
to a recognition in the school of the educational values 
inherent in clubs, societies, and pupil-organizations of 
various types. To direct and supervise these ‘extra- 
curricular” activities as they are called makes large de- 
mands upon the time, energy, and resourcefulness of the 
junior-high-school teacher, as well as upon the capacities 
for leadership to which we have already referred. The 
teacher who looks toward this field of service, then, 
should remember that the duties involved are likely to 
extend beyond the classroom, beyond the regular hours 
of the school day, and far beyond the limits of the sub- 
jects that he or she will teach. 
The senior-high-school service.:— The senior high 
school representing the middle and later adolescent 
years demands personal qualifications upon the part of 
the teacher that are not essentially different from those 
of the junior high school. The principal difference lies 
in the degree of specialization which the differentiated 
curricula of the senior high school permit. There is 
still, however, the problem of maintaining a proper bal- 
ance among the several subjects that each pupil pursues, 
1 In addition to the persons mentioned in connection with the development, 
of junior high schools, the following have won distinction as students of the general problems of secondary education.

an the consequent need of codperation on the part of 
the various teachers concerned. There is still the need, 
too, of directing toward worthy educational ends the 
social impulses that express themselves in clubs and 
organizations. 
The qualities of leadership particularly significant. — 
The qualities that make the teacher a ‘‘natural leader” 
are perhaps more important in the senior high school 
than in any other field of the teaching service. For a 
great many if not for most adolescents, the years between 
fifteen and nineteen are by far the most critical from the 
point of view of moral development. It is during this 
period that the experience of religious conversion (see 
p. pas) most frequently occurs; and it is during these 
years, too, that the initial steps are usually taken which 
1 to lives of vice and crime. The period of middle 
adolescence has always been regarded as peculiarly sig- 
nificant to religion, even in its most primitive forms; 
and more and more clearly, with the advance of civili- 
zation, society has recognized its responsibility to safe- 
guard youth during these formative and impressionable 
years. The rapid growth of the high school is multiply- 
ing each year both its possibilities of rendering a great 
service in the solution of the problems of moral educa- 
tion ' and its responsibilities for undertaking the task in 
a fundamental way. To this end no other factor can 
surpass in significance the qualities for leadership which 
the high-school teachers as a group represent. 
The rural-school service. — The open-country schools, 
whether “‘one-teacher”’ or ‘‘consolidated”’ (see pp. 272

f.), make certain demands upon the personal qualifica- 
tions of the teacher that are not made in anything ap- 
proaching the same degree by the town and city schools, 
and for two reasons: (1) because the school in the open 
country can be and frequently is much closer to the 
people and much more thoroughly a center of com- 
munity life than is the urban school; and (2) because the 
open-country environment represents unique educa- 
tional opportunities which the teacher can turn to good 
account if he has the right qualifications, while at the 
same time this environment represents some very definite 
educational handicaps which only the right kind of 
teacher can overcome. 
The community functions of the rural school. — The 
wide range of opportunities for constructive work which 
the rural-school service involves have been summarized 
by Miss Mabel Carney ' in her discussion of the com- 
munity functions of the rural school, which she conceives. 
to be as follows: 
“1, To educate those for whom it was established, that is, 
children and youth of legal school age. 
“This is the chief community service of the school as well as 
its fundamental educational function. The best service of the 
school to the community, in other words, must always be found 
in the proper discharge of its educational function. ...

education. After serving for four years as a rural-school teacher, she be-— 
came successively a critic teacher in the normal schools of Illinois and Wash- 
ington, supervisor of high-school training classes for rural-school teachers in Minnesota, and head of the department of rural education in Teachers Col- lege, Columbia University. She is the author of Country Life and the Country

“2. To...make provision for extra-curricular or outside ac- 
tivities for children, and thus indirectly effect the improvement 
of home and community life. 
“These socialized activities may be provided either directly by 
the school itself or indirectly through its codperation with other 
related agencies, as Boys’ and Girls’ Clubs, Junior Red Cross, 
Boy and Girl Scouts, and Camp Fire Girls. 
“3. [To encourage in the community] an adequate apprecia- 
tion and support of education. 
“This may be done either through the maintenance of separate 
organizations for adults giving primary attention to school affairs, 
as parent-teacher associations and school improvement leagues; 
or through the close codperation of other organizations, as granges, 
farm and home bureaus, or general community clubs, organized 
primarily for non-school purposes but willing to devote special 
attention to the study and advancement of educational needs. . . . 
“4, To codperate with other agencies in such of their activities 
as are educative to children of school age. 
“Practically all country-life organizations for adults-:make some 
provision for the education of the young in the fields of their 
major interest, and as long as these plans are in harmony with the 
underlying principles of education they should be cordially assisted 
and supported by the school. 
“5. To stimulate the establishment or regeneration of other 
community activities or agencies . . . designed to supplement the 
school and minister directly to the welfare of children. 
“Included here especially should be such interests as health, 
recreation, and cultural advantages, including travel, library priv- 
ileges, and opportunities to become acquainted with the world’s 
best music and art. 
“6. To furnish information for putting adults of the community 
in touch with the public and private agencies of county, state, 
and national scope which will contribute to their cultural or voca- 
tional welfare. 
“By this it is not meant that the school should supplant other 
agencies in the rural community, but only that rural teachers . . . 
 
-P-A-G-E-377

should be able to tell country people where to get needed help 
and service. ... 
“7, To...encourage the use of the school plant, when the 
people so choose, as a general community center or common meet- 
ing place for other agencies and activities of the community. ... 
     
     
        
   
                 
   
   
      
           “8, When the essential needs of the children have been prop- 
erly met. the school may extend its community function to include 
the post-school education of adults, both cultural and vocational, 
“But this obligation should not be assumed until children and 
youth of school age have been adequately’ provided for, and it is 
not ordinarily possible to the rural elementary school as now 
organized and handicapped. . . .” 
Miss Carney’s clear statement of the precedence that 
should be accorded to the primary function of the rural 
school — the education of the children of the community 
— is timely and salutary. This is the outstanding obli- 
gation of elementary and high schools whether they 
serve rural communities or urban communities. The 
opportunities for a wider service are most significant, 
however, for if these opportunities are wisely utilized, 
the primary function of the school will be all the better 
discharged. 
The unique educational opportunities of the rural en- 
vironment and its educational handicaps. — From the 
teacher’s point of view, the problems of rural education 
differ from the problems of urban education, not because 
f essential differences in aim, but because of real and 
undamental differences in environment. The work of 
he school is profoundly affected by its environment, for 
his determines in large measure the first-hand experi- 
nces of the pupils, and upon these experiences education 
we have seen (Chapter II) must always build. The

‘skillful teacher also uses the out-of-school experiences 
of the pupils to give point, meaning, and vitality to the 
school instruction. The rural environment provides a 
rich variety of experiences that the teacher, if he knows 
this environment intimately and has acquired the neces- 
sary skill and insight, can readily turn to educational 
account. 
     
                     
   
                                A certain one-teacher rural school, for example, operates a poultry 
yard. It operates also a productive school garden. Pure-bred 
poultry is its specialty in the one case; pure-bred seed-corn in the 
other. Its profits come from the selling of settings of eggs and from 
the selling of corn for seeding. With these profits the school plant 
is improved. A large community-room has been added to the school 
building. An attractive fireplace gives a homelike atmosphere not 
only to the community-room but to the classroom into which it opens. 
Comfortable chairs, a small library, and a library table contribute 
to this homelike atmosphere. In another part of the building is a 
kitchen where the children prepare their warm lunches. 
Now it is clear enough that a school might realize the aims of 
rural education without operating a poultry yard or a seed garden; 
it is equally clear that it might possess these and other adjuncts 
without being a good school; but, other things equal, it is likely 
to be a better school than it would be otherwise if it makes an intelli- 
gent use of the environment that surrounds it and of the dominant 
interests of the pupils in the life of this environment. In this partic- 
ular school, the poultry yard and the garden are sources of educa- 
tional materials and educational methods. They are. centers from 
which radiate studies in arithmetic, in geography, in elementary 
seience, and in language. In part, they are ends in themselves, but 
only in part; of far greater importance is their service to larger ends, 
They are starting-points from which the pupils are led into a wide 
world. 
There has been a lively discussion among the student: 
of rural education as to the measure in which the rura

4 school should aim to “‘keep the children on the farm. 
A reasonable position to take provisionally with regard 
to this problem is to assume that the right kind of rural 
education can and should encourage in the pupils an 
understanding of their environment, an appreciation of 
its advantages, and a wholesome respect for the occu- 
pation of farming. On the other hand, the frequent 
charge that rural education fails to make country chil- 
dren ‘‘content’’ with farm-life carries with it an unfor- 
tunate and a most unworthy implication, — namely, 
that the rural school should itself be content with a 
narrow curriculum based on the principle of keeping 
country people in happy ignorance of everything except 
the details of their daily work. To direct any form of- 
education toward the specific purpose of keeping people 
“contented with their lot” is obviously inconsistent with 
the plainest principles of democratic justice. One may 
go even farther and say that the rural school should 
make a distinct effort to acquaint its pupils with occu- 
pations other than agriculture, with their advantages 
and their handicaps, and with the kind of life that urban 
people live. An honest setting forth of the relative 
advantages and disadvantages of urban and rural life 
1 Among the leaders in rural education, the view that the rural school 
as a distinctly vocational function in preparing pupils for farming and other 
jpen-country occupations has been stoutly tained by Dr. Harold W. 
‘oght (born 1869). Dr. Foght has made exte: e studies of rural education 
in the Scandinavian countries, especially Denmark, where the possibilities of special education for the farming ses have been developed in a remark- 
ble degree. He is now President of the State Teachers College at Aberdeen, 
jouth Dakota. 
Ernest Burnham, who is head of the department of rural ate 
the Western State Normal School, Kalamazoo, Michigan, Dr. O. G. Brim, 
professor of education in Ohio State University, Miss Mabel Carney (see 
otnote, p. 363), and others have held that the function of rural education is t essentially different from that of urban education, but that the problems the two fields are in many ways sharply differentiated because of the 
mtrasts between rural and urban life.

368 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
would be vastly better than the distorted ideas that 
country children are otherwise likely to develop; and 
even if, after a frank discussion, some children conclude 
to cast their lot with the city, the catastrophe will not 
be comparable with the crime that the school would 
commit if it deliberately withheld the facts. The city- 
folk may need food, and may protest against the ‘‘depop- 
ulation” of the open country; but this scarcely justifies 
one in being a party to the exploitation of the country- 
folk, — and to limit the country child to a narrow cur- 
riculum on the ground that he must be kept on the farm 
is about the last word in the deliberate exploitation of 
one class for the benefit of another.' 
On the other hand, for the rural school to be blind to 
the rich educative materials that lie all about it is equally 
inexcusable. While it should not aim to ‘‘keep children 
on the farm” through a deliberately narrowed curricu- 
lum, it should clearly not go to the other extreme and 
imitate blindly the procedures of urban education. Cer- 
tainly no one could quarrel with a policy of rural educa- 
tion that aimed to reveal and interpret to the country 
child the wealth of interesting things that surround him. 
We have already emphasized (pp. 119 ff.) the need of 
1The cry against the city-ward movement of the population has lost 
to-day much of the force that it had a few years ago. It is now clear that 
this movement has been determined very largely by economic factors. There 
are relatively fewer farmers in the United States than there were a generation 
ago, and yet much more food is being produced. During the past few years, 
indeed, there has been so serious an overproduction that hundreds of thou- 
sands of farmers have been unable to dispose of their crops at a profit. They 
have literally been driven to the town and city, not because of any defects 
in their early education which failed to adjust them to coun’ life, but, 
because the supply of farmers exceeded the demand. This shifting of the| 
economic balance will doubtless go on for some time to come, and thousands 
of boys and girls now living in the open country and attending rural schools| 
  will become city-dwellers. It would be shortsighted, indeed, for rural educ: 
tion not to recognize this clear probability.   
-P-A-G-E-381

a conception of culture that will recognize the deep and 
fundamental meanings that inhere in the common things 
of life. Rural education offers by far the largest oppor- 
tunities of dealing in a broad and liberalizing way with 
these common things. The simplest implements of hus- 
bandry, — the axe, the spade, the hoe, the sickle, and 
the plow, — have had a long and honorable history. 
What iron has meant to the race can be far more clearly 
illustrated here than in the study of modern industry 
and transportation because of the very simplicity of the 
tools, and the readiness with which their advantage over 
stone and wooden implements can be shown. Prac- 
tically every cultivated plant, too, owes to human in- 
genuity its adaptation to human needs. These are but 
meager samples of the almost infinite possibilities that 
well-trained and enthusiastic rural-school teachers are be- 
ginning to explore and to turn to educational advantage. 
The educational assets of the rural environment, how- 
ever, are counterbalanced in some measure by liabilities 
and disadvantages. The frequent and intimate con- 
acts with nature and the direct, personal experiences 
f the country child with the basic processes of meeting 
uman needs are offset in part by the relative isolation 
f the life and the narrow range of human contacts. 
hese gaps and deficiencies in the life of the country 
hild the rural school must try to bridge and meet. As 
r. Brim has said, the school must “‘teach the child those 
sential things he does not learn outside of school”; 
d the need of the country child for those subjects that 
ere discussed in Chapter IV — the “‘liberal” studies — 
particularly significant in this connection. Because

his contacts with people are likely to be relatively few, 
there is all the more reason why he should be introduced 
to a group of people with whom he may continue a 
growing friendship throughout his life, — people who, 
when they become tiresome, can be placed on the shelf 
without hurting anyone’s feelings. .These really great 
people of literature and history may compensate in no 
small measure for the social isolation of the open coun- 
try. And if country life is peculiarly conducive to pro- 
vincialism, there is an antidote in geography, — not, 
perhaps, in geography as it is too often taught, but in 
real “‘human”’ geography through the study of which a 
competent teacher may take a group of boys and girls 
to every part of the globe, giving them in almost every 
lesson the feeling that they have actually “‘been there,” 
that they know how the region looks and how the peo- 
ple live and what they do that we might do; — intro- 
ducing them too, perhaps, to that fascinating literature 
of travel and exploration and government through the 
independent study of which the most isolated country- 
dweller may become in a very real sense a “‘citizen of th 
world.” 
The type of teacher that the rural service needs. — Ir] 
Chapter. X, it was pointed out that the typical rural 
school teacher to-day is immature, relatively untrained 
and a,transient in the service. There is a distinct nee 
in the rural schools for a teacher of another sort, and w] 
believe that competent young people who wish to ent 
a field where good work will be of the very largest valu 
and who are willing to pay the price of a careful traini 
for its important responsibilities, will be warranted j

assuming that this need will be recognized, and that 
their services will be in demand. A few words will de- 
scribe the type of teacher that is needed: a mature man 
or woman; well-grounded in the fundamentals of ¢le- 
mentary and secondary education, with the additional 
equipment provided by two, three, or better four years 
of a broadly conceived specialized education pointed 
directly toward this work; fired with a love of country 
life, familiar with its problems, competent to the difficult 
task of making the rich environment that lies all about 
the school yield up its valuable lessons; competent as 
well to open to the country child the world that lies be- 
yond his horizon; living in the community as a part of it, 
perhaps as its very soul and center; proud of his profes- 
sion but humble with a sense of its responsibilities; not 
ambitious to attain ‘‘promotion” in the current mean- 
ing of that term, but finely ambitious to grow in a work 
in which the possibilities of growth have no limit. 
Special types of teaching. — In addition to the large 
fields of service dealt with in the preceding sections of 
this chapter, there are smaller fields, all of which are 
significant, and for some of which specialized curricula 
are provided in the professional schools. We can do 
ittle more in the present volume, however, than to list 
ome of the more important of these fields. This re- 
stricted treatment is justified by the fact that these more 
ighly specialized teachers deal as a rule with -pupil- 
roups and social groups that do not differ essentially 
irom those that we have already discussed. The essen- 
ial differences, then, are in the education and technical 
iquipment of the teachers rather than in their personal

qualifications. Some of these fields, too, recruit their 
teachers from those branches of the service that we have 
already discussed; hence they are not ordinarily fields 
which one may enter immediately after graduation 
from the professional school. 
Teachers of atypical children. — This field is repre- 
sented by the schools and classes for the blind and deaf, 
for the feeble-minded, for exceptionally gifted children, 
and for moral delinquents. For each of these cases 
except the last, a highly specialized type of training is 
demanded, — and it should be, of course, for all of them. 
In each case, too, experience in teaching normal children 
is almost always a prerequisite to an appointment. 
Teachers of vocational subjects under the terms of the 
Smith-Hughes Act. — The Smith-Hughes Act, passed by 
Congress in 1917, provides for Federal participation 
with the states in the support of vocational education 
“of less than college grade” (see pp. 302 f.). In this 
connection, money grants are made for training teachers 
of agriculture, the household arts, and the artisan trades, 
who will serve in the high schools that avail themselves 
of the state and Federal appropriations. In most of the 
states, this work in vocational teacher-training is as- 
signed to the “land-grant” colleges, — that is, the col- 
leges of agriculture and mechanic arts that have been 
developed as a result of the Morrill Land-Grant act’ of 
1862. In a few of the states some of the work has been| 
delegated to the normal schools and teachers colleges

technical curricula in agriculture, household economics. 
and engineering, and for teachers of the artisan trade

       actual experience in the trade itself is regarded as an 
essential prerequisite. 
Teachers of “special subjects.” — The successive intro- 
duction of music, drawing, manual training, and domes- 
tie science as parts of the elementary-school curriculum 
led to the development of a group of “special” teachers 
who took the place of the ‘‘regular”’ teacher when one 
or another of these subjects was to be taught. Where 
shops and laboratories were required, as in manual 
training and the household arts, the special teachers 
usually worked in “centers” to which groups of pupils 
from the neighboring elementary schools went for in- 
struction; in the case of music and drawing, the special 
teacher passed from school to school and from room to 
room taking each class for the period. In many school 
systems, the duties of the special teacher became almost 
exclusively supervisory in character, — the regular class- 
room teacher giving the actual instruction, the special 
teacher ‘checking’ the work, making suggestions for 
its improvement, and meeting the regular teachers at 
frequent intervals in group-conferences. As the “‘spe- 
cial” subjects increased in number, the complications 
and irritations involved in this system were multiplied. 
Special teachers and supervisors were appointed for 
nature study, for penmanship, for physical training and 
health education, for “visual education,’”’ and even for 
some of the “regular” subjects such as arithmetic, 
English, and the social sciences.

  rather complete reorganization of the elementary school. 
From the first grade on, the program is divided into three 
parts, — ‘‘work,” ‘play,’ and ‘‘study,’—and the 
pupils move by groups or “‘platoons” from the ‘‘home 
room”’ (where most of the “regular” school work is car- 
ried on under the ‘‘home-room”’ teacher) to the shops, 
gardens, or laboratories for industrial arts or nature 
study, each under a special teacher; thence to the gym- 
nasium or the playground for directed play or other 
forms of health education under a special teacher; thence 
to the music room or the auditorium for singing under a 
special teacher; thence back to the home room for work 
on the “regular” subjects or for directed study under 
the supervision of the home-room teacher. In this way, 
each teacher, whether “regular” or “‘special,’’ has his 
or her own allotment of work to do with the pupils, and 
the time for doing it is part of the stated program. The 
“platoon plan” requires a somewhat larger proportion of 
“special” teachers than the older system, and a some- 
what longer school day, but it has obvious advantages 
in providing a balanced program of varied activities for 
the pupils, it makes it possible to teach the special sub- 
jects in such a way that a real value can be derived from 
them, and it enables the home-room teacher to concen- 
trate on the “regular” subjects without constant inter- 
ruption from a more or less continuous procession of 
special teachers and supervisors. 
1 The organization of the school on the ‘work-play-study” basis which is 
the essence of the platoon system was first conceived and put into operation 
by William Wirt (born 1874), who has been since 1907 superintendent of the Gary, Indiana, schools. This plan and other innovations introduced by Mr. 
Wirt gave the Gary schools a wide reputation, especially during the decade, 
1910-1920.

If this type of organization is generally adopted, much 
more of the teaching in the elementary school will be 
specialized than has been the case in the past. The 
policy in the school systems that so far have put the plan 
in operation, however, is to make successful work as a 
home-room teacher a prerequisite to appointment as a 
special teacher, the necessary special training for the 
work being secured either through in-service education 
or during a leave of absence. 
The research service. — The rapid development of 
objective measures for testing mental ability and edu- 
cational achievement (pp. 188 ff.) has led during the past 
ten or fifteen years to the opening of a new and important 
branch of service which may be called the research field. 
Practically every large city school system now has its 
staff of clinical psychologists and statisticians whose 
business it is to devise and adapt mental and educational 
tests, administer them or instruct teachers in this tech- 
nique, assemble and interpret the results, and suggest 
improvements in school organization, curriculum mate- 
rials, and methods of instruction based upon their find- 
ings. Similar bureaus of research have been established 
m connection with some of the state departments of 
ducation, and‘they are sometimes attached to teachers 
olleges and university schools of ‘education. Taken 
ogether,' the bureaus of research constitute the most 
      
                        
    
       
      
       
      1The research workers are united in a flourishing national organization, 
e Educational Research Association. Its official organ is the Journal of 
iducational Research (Bloomington, Illinois) founded and edited by Dr. B. R. 
juckingham (born 1876), himself one of the pioneers in the measurement 
lovement, and now Director of the Bureau of Educational Research at 
io State University. Other iraportant leaders in this field are S. A. Courtis

powerful single factor now working toward the improve- 
ment of education. The service requires a specialized 
and highly technical preparation which is now provided 
by the larger universities. Previous experience as a 
teacher is regarded as desirable, but it is not a sine qua 
non to appointment. 
The administrative and supervisory services. — The 
administrative phases of public education have become 
increasingly difficult and important as school systems 
have become larger and more complicated. The ‘‘busi- 
ness” side of school organization and management can 
be looked after readily enough by the school board in a 
small district with a one-teacher school, or with at most 
three or four such schools. As the schools are multiplied 
and the teachers increase in number, the oversight of 
buildings, the purchasing of supplies, the selection and 
appointment of teachers, the evaluation of their work, 
the adjustment of misunderstandings between parents 
and teachers, and a host of similar duties become too 
heavy a burden for a small group of laymen to carry in 
addition to their regular business. With the growth of 
school systems, then, the school boards came to depen 
more and more upon an employed executive to do this 
work. Inasmuch as the school building was a conve 
nient unit of administration, one of the teachers in thi 
building was usually recognized as the ‘‘head master’ 
“principal teacher,” and to him administrative ri 
sponsibilities were delegated which he discharged as we' 
as he could in the intervals of his teaching or after scho

hours. City school systems had grown to a considerable 
size before the office of the school “superintendent” 
gradually evolved through relieving one of the principals 
of all teaching duties and delegating to him the oversight 
and administrative control of the several schools con- 
stituting the system. The relative recency of this 
development is evidenced by the fact that the first 
city-school superintendency was established in Buffalo 
less than a century ago (in 1837), or nearly two hundred 
years after the initial development of the public school 
in America. 
As at present constituted, the administrative service 
comprises state superintendents of schools (usually 
elected by the people, but in many cases appointed by the 
governor or by a state board of education, in which case 
they are usually designated state “commissioners of 
education”); county superintendents (usually elected by 
the people, but sometimes appointed by state or county 
boards of education) whose duties are commonly limited 
to the oversight of rural and village schools; city superin- 
tendents (appointed by city boards of education) with 
their associate and assistant superintendents; and prin- 
cipals of schools, who have in most cases direct responsi- 
bility for the work of all of the teachers employed in the 
building, for the care of the building and its equipment, 
for the discipline of the pupils, and for the relationships 
with parents and other members of the community. 
Very few school administrators are merely business 
executives. The most important duties of superin- 
tendents and principals, indeed, are in connection with 
the supervision of teaching, including not only an in-    
-P-A-G-E-390
    378 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
spection of the teachers’ work to determine whether it 
is good or poor, but also constructive efforts toward its 
improvement. The coérdination of the work of the 
various schools and teachers which constitute the system 
is also an important phase of the superintendent’s duties. 
In increasing measure, too, he is being looked upon 
as the ‘“‘liaison officer’? who keeps the schools and the 
public in close touch with one another. He is not only 
the official representative of the school board in its deal- 
ings with individual teachers and pupils; he is also the 
spokesman for the schools, the teachers, and the pupils 
in their relationships to the school board and the public. 
The rapid growth and development of public education 
have given to the administrative and supervisory phases 
of school work an outstanding importance, and it is 
small wonder that some of the best known names in the 
history of American education are the names of men and 
women! who have won distinction as organizers and 
administrators of educational institutions and systems. 
First appointments to administrative and supervisory 
posts are made, almost without exception, from the 
ranks of the classroom teachers, although it often hap- 
pens that young men on entering the public-school 
1In addition to such men as Horace Mann, Henry Barnard, W. T. Harris, 
Charles W. Eliot, and others mentioned in the preceding pages, the following are among those ‘that deserve special recognition: Cyrus Peirce (1790-1860),

Francis W. Parker (1831-1902), once superintendent at Quincy, Massachu- 
setts, and later principal of the Chicago and Cook County Normal ‘School (now 
the Chicago Normal College); Edward A. Sheldon (1832-1897), founder and until his death principal of the Oswego State Normal School; James B. Angell (1829-1916), for many years president of the University of Michigan; James M. Greenwood (1837-1914), who made a distinguished record as superintend- 
ent of schools, Kansas City, Missouri; and William H. Maxwell (1852-1920), 
who was for several years superintendent of schools in proce ay and who 
became the first superintendent of the schools of Greater New York.

service will combine teaching and administration at the 
outset, especially as principals of small high schools. 
Superintendents and assistant superintendents are usu- 
ally recruited from the principals’ group. College and 
university presidents have usually served as deans, and 
to the deanships they were earlier “promoted” from 
professorships. Within recent years, while the policy of 
demanding teaching experience as a prerequisite for ad- 
ministrative and supervisory appointments has been 
retained, there has been a growing tendency to require 
specialized and technical training for administrative and 
supervisory work. The graduate students in the teach- 
ers colleges and university schools of education to-day 
are very largely mature men and women who have served 
successfully as teachers and principals, and who are now 
preparing themselves for the ‘‘more advanced”’ admin- 
istrative and supervisory posts. 
Recent movements toward a larger recognition of the 
direct teaching services. — There is a general conviction 
that the contrasts between teaching on the one hand and 
administration and supervision on the other hand have 
been too sharply drawn. In many cases, indeed, there 
has been no way in which to reward exceptionally meri- 
torious teaching except to take the successful teacher 
from the classroom and from actual daily contact with 
boys and girls, and make of him or her a supervisory or 
administrative official. Especially unfortunate, and rec- 
ognized as such by administrators and teachers alike, has 
been the tendency toward the “‘factory system” in school 
organization, — toward a “‘hierarchy”’ of authority and 
responsibility which makes the school board a “board of 
   
-P-A-G-E-392
  380 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
directors,” the superintendent a “general manager,” the 
assistant superintendents so many ‘‘foremen,” and the 
principals equivalent to “‘bosses,’”’ while the teachers, to 
eomplete the picture, have the status of “hands” or 
routine workers. The protest against this tendency of 
the modern highly-organized school system to follow 
the pattern of industrial development has led to several 
plans and proposals for reducing the danger and for in- 
suring to the teacher a status that will be consistent with 
the responsibility which always rests upon him and which 
no devices of ‘“‘overhead”’ organization can significantly 
diminish. A brief reference to some of these plans and 
proposals may form a fitting conclusion to this volume. 
The good work of professional organizations. — In the 
first place, the development of a clear-cut professional 
consciousness on the part of teachers is proceeding apace 
with the rapid growth of teachers’ organizations which 
make no distinctions as to “rank” in the service and 
which aim to bring the collective judgment of the whole 
profession to bear upon the solution of its problems. 
(See pp. 309 ff.) 
Teachers’ councils. — Another important movement 
is reflected in the organization of teachers’ councils 
which represent the classroom teachers (usually by dele- 
gates elected from the various schools) in the determina- 
tion of the larger policies concerned with the organiza- 
tion and administration of the system. The tendency, 
it should be noted, is to give to these councils a real re- 
sponsibility for proposing educational policies and. for 
evaluating and passing upon the policies initiated by the 
administrative staff or the board of education. In this 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
  
SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS 381 
way, the judgment and opinions of those who are closest 
to the problems of the school will have an authorized 
channel for effective expression. 
A recognzied status for the successful teacher. — A pro- 
posal of far-reaching significance is to do away with the 
distinctions that have heretofore been drawn among the 
several branches or ‘‘levels” of the teaching service, — 
distinctions between “rural” and ‘‘urban” teachers; 
among “primary” and “‘upper-grade”’ teachers, ‘ele- 
mentary,” ‘“‘high-school,’”’ and ‘“‘college” teachers; and 
among “‘teachers,” “supervisors,” and “administrators,” 
— and to institute distinctions of another kind, based 
not upon the age of the pupil taught, nor the type of 
community served, but upon preparation for, growth in, 
and success in one’s work, wherever that work may lie. 
Some definite suggestions toward this end have been re- 
cently proposed by Dr. Charles Russell.!. Under Dr. 
Russell’s plan, all teachers entering the service would be 
recognized as “‘Novices,’’ and whether they taught in 
rural schools or urban schools, elementary or high schools 
or colleges, they would be held to a period of apprentice- 
work under close supervision. He assumes that during 
this period, too, they would be continuing their education. 
After an appropriate “novitiate,” the successful teacher 
would pass to the grade of “‘Journeyman.” On this level 
the supervision would be less intimate, and the teacher 
would have a larger measure of freedom, but the stimu- 
lus of further education would still continue, and the 
teacher would reach the stage where he or she would

     have completed an advanced course of professional study 
and thus be qualified for the next advancement to the 
status of ‘‘Graduate teacher.’’ On this level, the super- 
vision is still further relaxed, but again the stimulus for 
growth is ever-present. With evidences of growth and 
clearly demonstrated success in classroom work, the final 
grade of “‘Master-teacher” may be attained. It is Dr. 
Russell’s proposal that appointments to important ad- 
ministrative and supervisory posts be limited to Master- 
teachers, but that a large proportion of those who reach 
this status be also retained in the classroom service as 
“Master training-teachers,”’ ‘‘Master teachers of chil- 
dren,” and the like, and that no essential distinctions 
either in rank or in salary be drawn between such teach- 
ers and the administrative and supervisory officers. 
In the great work of teaching nothing is trivial.— 
What these movements and proposals have in view is 
that the actual work of teaching may afford for devoted 
and successful service rewards and recognitions that will 
not suffer by comparison with the rewards and recogni- 
tions offered by other occupations. There are in reality 
no ‘‘humble posts” in the teaching service. In the broad 
range that this service covers there is no item or activ- 
ity, however small and apparently unimportant, that 
does not call insistently for keen thought, clear vision, 
abundant resourcefulness, ready initiative, penetrating 
sympathy, and self-sacrificing effort. Shot through 
with fundamental meaning are the words of William 
Lyon Phelps, — ‘‘ Nothing is too minute or trivial that; 
concerns the great art of teaching.”!

Questions, EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
1. If you have already made a choice of a specialized field of 
service, write out very clearly the reasons that led you to this choice. 
If you are still considering the choice, what considerations are upper- 
most in your mind? 
2. Recall any particular difficulty or misconception which you have 
had in school and describe the teacher’s method of dealing with it and 
with you. 
3. When were you most unlovable as a child? What things helped 
you to rid yourself of unlovable traits? If you have younger brothers 
or sisters or both, where are they in the process of growing up? What 
are their lovable and unlovable traits? 
4, What are your individual objections to those specialized fields of 
teaching which you have decided not to follow? 
5. Taking the various service fields as outlined in the text, find 
how many persons are engaged in each field in your home com- 
munity, in your county, in your state. In how far have the chances for 
employment influenced your choice of a specialized field of teaching? 
6. Interview some school administrator known personally to you 
to find out specifically about his or her education and experience. 
Why has he or she succeeded? 
7. Glance back at the chapter headings of this book, calling to mind 
the main points of each chapter. In how far has it been successful 
and in how far has it failed to introduce you to teaching?

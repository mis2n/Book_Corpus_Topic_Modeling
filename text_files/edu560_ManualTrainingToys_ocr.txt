INTRODUCTION. 
The wise man learns from the experience of others. That is the 
reason for this introduction—to tell the boy who wants to make the 
toys described in this book some of the “tricks of the trade.” It is 
supposed, however, that he has had some instruction in the use of 
tools. 
This book is written after long experience in teaching boys, and 
because of that experience, the author desires to urge upon his 
younger readers two bits of advice: First, study the drawing care- 
fully,—every line has a meaning; second, printed directions become 
clearer by actually taking the tool in hand and beginning to do the 
work described. 
BENCH. 
If he buys the vise-screw, an ambitious boy can make a bench 
that will answer his needs, provided, also, that he can fasten it to 
floor or wall. It should be rigid. A beginner will find a hard wood 
board, 10”’x2”x14”, fastened to the forward end of the bench, a 
more convenient stop than the ordinary bench-dog. If he has a 
nicely finished bench, he should learn to work without injuring the 
bench. <A cutting board should always be at hand to chisel and pound 
upon and to save the bench-top from all ill use. The bench-hook 
should have one side for sawing and one for planing, the former 
having a block shorter than the width of the board so that the teeth 
of the saw, when they come thru the work, will strike the bench-hook 
rather than the bench-top. 
Marxine Toots. 
To measure accurately, hold the ruler on its edge so that the 
divisions on the scale come close to the thing measured. Let the 
pencil or knife point make a dash on the thing measured which would 
exactly continue the division line on the ruler. If it can be avoided, 
never use the end of the ruler; learn to measure from some figure on 
the ruler.
-P-A-G-E-10
8 MANUAL TRAINING TOYS. 
  
The spur of the gage should be filed like a knife point. It seldom 
stands at zero of the scale, hence, when setting the gage for accurate 
work, measure from the block to the spur with a ruler. The gage 
is a rather difficult tool for a boy to use but it will pay to master it. 
It may be used wherever square edges are to be made, but chamfers 
and bevels should be marked with a pencil. 
In laying out work, the beam (the thick part) of the trysquare 
should always be kept on either the working-face or the working-edge. 
(See page 13, Directions for Planing.) Let the blade rest flat on 
any surface. Hold the trysquare snugly to the work with the fingers 
and thumb acting much like a bird’s claw. 
For accurate work (e. g. joints), lines should be drawn (scored) 
with the sharp point of a small knife blade, held nearly straight up 
from the edge of the trysquare blade. 
Circles are located by two lines crossing at the center. 
Saws. 
The teeth of a rip-saw are like so many little chisels set in a row; 
they pare the wood away. The teeth of a crosscut-saw are like knife 
points, they score two lines, and the wood breaks off between them. 
Large sawing should be done on a saw-horse so that the worker is 
over his work. If it is necessary to hold work in the vise to rip it, 
hold it slanting, so that the handle of the saw leads the line, as it 
uaturally does when the work is on a saw-horse. 
The back-saw, tho a crosscut-saw, may be used in any direction 
of the grain. 
Any saw should be in motion when it touches the wood it is 
to cut. To guide it to the right place, a workman lets his thumb 
touch the saw just above the teeth, the hand resting firmly on the 
wood. A little notch, cut in the edge right to the line where the saw 
is to cut, will help a beginner to start accurately. Saws are rapid 
tools, and it pays to go slowly enough with them to do accurate 
work. Plan the work so as to make as few cuts as possible. 
Turning-saws are best used so that the cutting is done on the pull 
stroke, keeping the two hands near together. When one handle is 
turned, the other must be turned equally.

  INTRODUCTION. 9   
PLANES. 
Generally being in a hurry to get work done, boys are apt to take 
big shavings with a plane. This results in rough work. Fine shav- 
ings are better. If the plane is allowed to rest level on the work, 
it will find the high places without continual adjusting. The first 
two inches of a stroke are the hardest to plane; to plane these, press 
harder on the forward end of the plane. Start the plane level. 
Usually it is best to keep the plane straight, or nearly so, in the di- 
rection of the push. 
The block-plane is properly used to plane the end of wood. (See 
page 12 on Holding Work.) On other small surfaces, however, it is 
often more convenient than a large plane. 
Bits. 
Auger-bits are numbered by the number of sixteenths in the dia- 
meter of the hole they bore, e. g. No. 4 bores a 4/16” hole. Gimlet- 
bits are numbered by thirty-seconds. 
Whenever boring with an auger-bit, stop as soon as the spur 
pricks thru the other side, turn the work over, start the spur in 
the little hole it made, and finish boring. It will always split the 
wood, if the bit is allowed to go way thru. It is difficult to bore a 
hole straight thru a piece of wood, because to tell whether the bit 
is held straight when starting the hole, one must look at it from two 
directions If someone else can stand a quarter circle away from the 
worker and watch the bit, that is the best help; otherwise, the worker 
himself must hold the brace steady while he walks around a quarter 
circle and judges whether the bit is straight. Care should be taken 
to hold the work level in the vise. 
Nats. 
The words, “nail,” “brad,” and “nailing” are used somewhat in- 
terchangeably in this book; “nailing” may mean driving a brad. 
Brads have smaller, thicker heads, nails have larger, flat heads. 
To drive a nail straight, start it straight. The hole cannot be
-P-A-G-E-12
    10 MANUAL TRAINING TOYS.   
straightened by bending the nail so that it looks straight after it is 
partly driven. Many gentle blows with the hammer will often drive 
a nail where heavy blows would fail. The fingers pinching the nail 
often prevent its bending. If possible, keep nails away from the 
corners of boards. Several nails joining two boards hold them 
stronger if the nails are driven at different angles. Nails are usually 
“set,” that is, the heads are driven with a nail-set below the surface. 
They must always be set below surfaces which are to be planed. It 
is often wise not to drive the first nail or two way in until the work 
is examined. In withdrawing nails, a block under the hammer will 
often aid greatly, and also protect the surface of the work. 
Screws. 
Screws usually need holes properly bored to receive them; a large 
hole first, the size of the screw above the threads, a small hole next, 
the size at the roots of the threads (in hard wood somewhat larger), 
and a place for the head made with a counter-sink. Usually the 
screw should slip easily thru the first piece of wood and be tight in 
the second. The screwdriver should always be held in the line that 
the screw is going, and it ought fairly to fit the slot in the head. In 
hard wood, one must be careful not to twist screws off, especially 
brass screws, which are easily broken. 
GLUE. 
A. beginner often wonders why things stick to his fingers instead 
of to their proper places; it is because he has ai little glue on his 
fingers and usually a lot on the article; therefore, don’t use too much 
glue. It is best, especially in holes and their pegs, to put glue on 
both surfaces of contact. Good glue will hold two surfaces, making 
good contact, stronger than the wood. Wipe off excess glue as soon 
as possible, using hot water for hot glue. Much labor is thus saved. 
Allow glue plenty of time to become dry. The moisture has to work 
its way thru the wood itself, and this takes hours; six to ten hours 
is not too long.

INTRODUCTION. ‘Lt 
  
SANDPAPER. 
Sandpaper varies in coarseness from No. 00 to No. 3, every sheet 
being stamped. It should not be used on a given piece until all work 
with edge tools is finished. The particles of sand left in the surface 
would quickly dull an edge tool. When using sandpaper on flat sur- 
faces, wrap it closely about a rectangular block of wood. Try to 
keep all corners as sharp as they are left by the edge tools so that 
there will be a crispness of appearance which always marks good work- 
manship. Often the same care in holding work while sandpapering 
it must be taken as was taken when shaping it. Always sandpaper 
with, or lengthwise the grain. 
DoweELs. 
Sticks that are planed nearly to size can be made round and 
smooth by driving them thru a hole in a block of hard wood or iron; 
such sticks are called dowels. Two holes may be used if the second 
is only a little smaller than the first. Drive gently with a mallet 
rather than with a hammer. In many of the models in this book 
such dowels are used. Dowels, (made by a different process, how- 
ever,) can often be bought at hardware stores. 
DRILLxs. 
For ease in making small holes, a hand-drill is essential. For some 
holes a headless nail will answer. To make better drills, break a needle, 
a knitting-needle, umbrella rib, or other piece of hard wire to suit- 
able length; on a grindstone, flatten it near the point on two sides; 
then, putting it in the chuck of the hand-drill, try to hold it on the 
grindstone at the proper angle to form the two cutting edges; or it 
may be held against the edge of the bench and sharpened with an 
oilstone resting on top of the bench. Very convenient long drills 
can be thus made of knitting-needles. 
SHARPENING. 
To work with dull tools is altogether unsatisfactory. A boy should 
learn to sharpen his own edge tools. To grind a good bevel on a tool 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  
  12 MANUAL TRAINING TOYS.   
like a chisel, it must rest upon something steady. The reflection of light 
on the newly ground surface will indicate whether the surface is flat 
or not. This process of grinding makes what is called a feather- 
edge, or wire-edge, and the tool must be whetted on an oilstone to 
remove this wire-edge. The flat side must be kept flat on the stone; 
the bevel may be lifted just a trifle. When whetting the. bevel, try 
to avoid a rocking motion, for this would round the edge. After 
the wire-edge is completely removed, a still keener edge can be ob- 
tained by stropping the tool on a piece of leather, much as a razor 
is stropped. A piece of leather glued to a wooden mount and 
sprinkled occasionally with the finest emery powder will help much 
in keeping the edge tools keen. 
Hotpine Work. 
The way work is held in the vise often makes the difference be- 
tween success and failure. Small surfaces are easily planed true if 
held almost flush with the jaws of the vise so that the top of the 
bench serves to guide the plane; for example, the wheel-center, page 
20, or the crank, Plate 33, are easily planed in this manner. Some- 
times articles, like spools, can be held endwise with safety when they 
might be crushed if squeezed sidewise. 
A good way to hold the paddles of the sand wheel, Plate 21, Fig. 
4, to saw the lines A B is to put the paddles about half-way down the 
end of the vise so that the back-saw can be held near the end of the 
vise jaws. 
The bench-hook is the best device for holding a great deal of 
small work for sawing and for planing sides, corners, and ends. 
When planing ends, to avoid splitting the far corner, another piece 
of equal thickness may be put behind the first. The better way, 
however, is never to plane over the far corner, but turn the work and 
plane always towards the center; in other words, plane half way - 
from each edge. Where a corner can be whittled off to form a but- 
tress, there is practically no danger of splitting that corner. For 
planing thin boards, see page 19.
-P-A-G-E-15
  INTRODUCTION. 13 
DiREcTIONS FoR PLANING. 
1. Plane one broad surface. Test it crosswise, lengthwise, and 
cornerwise. This surface is called the working-face, and should be 
marked with a pencil line near the edge to be planed next. On a 
short board the cornerwise test can be made with a straight-edge; on 
a long board winding-sticks are needed. These are straight sticks 
with parallel edges. Near the ends of the board, stand them on edge 
across the board. With the eye some distance away, sight from one 
stick to the other, if one end of the farther stick seems elevated, that 
corner of the board must be planed more. 
2. Plane one edge. Test it crosswise with the trysquare on the 
working-face, and lengthwise with a straight-edge. This is called 
the working-edge. Mark it with two pencil lines, drawn near the 
line on the working-face. 
These two surfaces are of great importance. From them all 
measurements are made and all tests applied. The trysquare and the 
gage should always be kept on one of these two surfaces. 
3. Square the ends. With the trysquare, test them from both the 
working-face and the working-edge. 
4. Gage the width from the working-edge. Plane to the line. 
With the trysquare on the working-face, test this edge. 
5. Gage the thickness from the working-face. Plane to the line. 
Sometimes, of course, the above order needs to be changed. It 
is well to think ‘out the best order of work.

DART—P ate 1. 
A dart like the first one shown on Plate 1 will stick into a soft 
wooden target. Two or more boys, each with three darts, might have 
a contest in making the highest score. Number three rings of a tar- 
get 5, 10, and 15, and the bull’s eye 25. 
The dart consists of two parts, a round stick and a paper rudder. 
To make the round stick, 7” long 14” diameter, it will be well to 
start with a stick about 9” long so as to be able to hold it easily while 
planing it round. First plane the stick square, 14”, and straight 
To plane such a small stick straight, it should be laid on the top of 
the bench. While planing it, test it frequently by looking at it end- 
wise. When it is the right size, grasp one end with the left hand, 
lay it on the bench with the forefinger touching the bench, and, with 
a small-plane, plane away the corners so as to make a true octagonal 
(eight sided) stick. Next make it sixteen sided, taking very fine 
shavings, then sandpaper it well. Saw off the extra length, leaving 
the best part of the stick 7” long. 
Bind one end with fine (screen) wire. To bind it well, make a 
square corner 1” from one end of the wire and lay this 1” lengthwise 
the stick. Hold it firmly with the left thumb while winding the long 
part of the wire smoothly around the stick and wire. Twist the two 
ends together, and cut off what is not needed. Gently pound down 
smooth the end of the wire that is left. 
In this end of the stick, drill a hole for a 1” brad. File the head 
entirely off, and drive the brad in backwards, leaving 3/16” out; then 
file the point real sharp. Carefully split the other end of the stick 
1”. To do this, stand it upright in the vise, place a knife on the end, 
and tap the knife with a hammer. Into this split, insert the paper 
rudder bent as shown in Plate 1. The rudder should be cut the 
shape and size shown in the working drawing and then bent into 
shape.

SPOOL DART—P ats 1. 
An easier dart to throw can be made of a spool as shown on Plate 
1. Three feathers which curve the same way will give the dart a 
whirling motion when it is thrown. 
Make a stick about 7” long to fit tightly into the hole of a spool 
about 1” in diameter at its end. (See Dowels, page 11, also Glue, 
page 10.) A stick like this can be forced into a hole quite far by 
screwing it around, but if it is driven much with a hammer the 
spool will split easily. After the stick is glued into the spool, hold 
the spool upright on the jaws of the vise, and squeeze the stick 
extending below; then with the back-saw make four slanting cuts to 
sharpen the spool. File a 234” nail square off, 1” long; drive it 
backwards into a suitable hole drilled for it in the center of the 
spool; and sharpen it well with a file. One-half inch from the other 
end of the spool saw the stick off, and drill three holes in the spool 
end, into which glue three feathers about 4” long.

DART FOR WHIP-BOW. Puate 1. 
This dart is best made of a shingle. Lacking that, plane a 14” 
board thin* at one end to 4%”. Draw the center line lengthwise and 
lay out the shape of the dart with the broad part at the thin end. 
Saw crosswise from each edge of the shingle to the place where the 
curve begins, then lengthwise to that point. Holding the thin end 
in the vise, pare the curves with a knife, spokeshave, or draw-knife. 
Make the point at each end with a plane. To plane to slanting lines 
such as these, it is very important to place the work in the vise at 
such a slant that the line is parallel with the top of the bench and 
quite close to the jaws of the vise. Find the point where the dart 
balances by testing it on the finger, and make the little notch for the 
string, using a back-saw first, then a knife. 
A whip-bow consists of a string 20” long tied to the end of a 
stick 20” long. A knot is tied at the free end of the string. To 
throw the dart, catch the string in the notch, hold the wide end of 
the dart in the left hand and the stick in the right, throw the right 
hand forward, and let the dart fly from the string. 
*To hold a board while planing it very thin, fasten it to another flat 
board with four wooden pegs. 
For several of the models in this book, a flat board about 9''x4!’x%"’ 
with a cleat nailed to one end and extending \%"' above its upper surface 
will be found most convenient for holding thin boards while planing. If 
the cleat is a little wider than the height of the block on the bench-hook, 
the bench-hook serves well to hold it.  
-P-A-G-E-22
  20 MANUAL TRAINING TOYS.   
BUZZER—P.ateE 2. 
The buzzer consists of a wheel and two handles, connected with 
string. To make the wheel draw a 3” circle on a piece of wood 3/16” 
thick. Draw a line thru the center the way the grain goes and 
another at right angles to it, thus dividing the circle into quarters, 
Fig. 1. Notice, now, that to avoid splitting the circle, the four quar- 
ters must each be cut in a different direction. Lay the model flat 
on the bench-hook and saw off the corners of the square. Now, hold- 
ing it in the vise with one quarter up, with the 
spokeshave, pare the corners in the direction of the 
arrow in this quarter until the circle is reached. 
H Be careful not to pare away any part of the line. 
B eS It will be observed that paring can be done safely 
ESS on the end grain beyond the arrow-head in this 
“Fig. 1 quarter, but this is not at all possible on the 
side grain where the arrow begins. The spokeshave should be held 
rather lightly so as to allow it to follow the curve. Observing care- 
fully the direction of the arrows, proceed with the other quarters in 
this same manner. The last few chips should be very fine ones. Drill 
two small holes for the string 44” each side of the center. Sandpaper 
the model nicely. (See Sandpaper, page 11.) 
The two handles can be planed best if held in the bench-hook and 
the plane turned with its side on the top of the bench. After the 
corners are planed in this way, the ends can be planed without dan- 
ger of splitting. Drill the holes for the string. The edges and ends 
of the handles will look better not sandpapered. 
String the model by passing one end of a 3 ft. string thru a hole 
in one handle, then in the wheel, then in the other handle, then back 
thru the other holes, tying it to the other end of the string. To make 
it go, take one handle in each hand, swing the wheel over and over, 
and gently pull the handles apart for an instant. A little practice may 
be necessary to make it go well. To make it buzz louder, bore two 
5/16” holes on opposite parts of the wheel 14” from the rim. (See 
Bits, page 9.) To avoid splitting, bore backwards till the bit marks a 
deep circle in the wood.

FLYING TOP—Puare 3. 
Like anything that flies, this top should be made as light as 
possible. Bass, cotton-wood, or soft pine are good woods to use. 
After the wood for the top is planed to size, a 3/16” hole should be 
bored straight thru the center. (See Bits, page 9.) Make the draw- 
ing on the top and whittle to line. Considerable care must be taken 
in whittling not to whittle away the two corners which should be 
saved; this is especially true if the grain is not straight. See page 
16 for suggestions about making the handle. Glue the handle in 
the top. To make it fly, hold it between the two hands, and push the 
right one quickly. (See Plate 3.)

FLYING TOP—PuateE 4. 
This form of flying top requires accurate work to make a good 
joint. (See Directions for Planing, page 13.) After planing the 
two vanes to size, the joint must be laid out with knife and gage 
lines and cut out with back-saw and chisel. Two important facts 
should be learned: The length of one notch equals the width of the 
other piece; the lines marking the depth of the notches must be 
gaged from the working-face of each piece. After the joint is laid 
out, hold the work in the bench-hook while sawing the depth of the 
notch, and be sure to saw in the notch, not outside the line. With a 
chisel held flat side down, pare between the saw cuts from each side 
of the wood towards the middle. When the joint is fitted, lay out 
the curves on each arm of the wheel, remembering that it is always 
the front corner of the right-hand arm, as the wheel turns around, 
that is to be whittled away. When all these curves are drawn, take 
the joint apart, and whittle to the lines. Glue the joint next, and 
bore a 3/16” hole straight thru its center. Make the axle of hard 
wood. (See page 16 and Dowels, page 11.) Perhaps a skewer can 
be used. 
After the handle is planed to size, draw pencil lines 4” from each 
edge for the chamfers. The curve of the chamfer may be drawn 
freehand. It should end 1 1/16” from one end of the handle. A good 
chamfer is flat crosswise. If the grain of the wood is straight, the 
chamfers can be whittled easily ; if it is crooked watch that it does not 
split over the line. After the chamfers are made, pare another one 
1%” wide around the end of the handle. After the two blocks are 
planed, bore a 14” hole 34” from one end. Glue and nail them 1” on 
the handle.

TOP—P.ats 5. 
A variety of sizes, shapes and colors of tops, spinning on a plate, 
is a lively sight. The one suggested is perhaps as large as it should be 
made for such sport. Smaller ones are easily made of spools without 
making a disk, or wheel, for them. The more slender the spindle is, 
the faster one can spin the top. First make a stick about 6” long to 
fit the hole in the spool. Plane 1” of it tapering as small as 1%”, 
then glue the spool on 114” below this small end. Now hold the 
spool in the vise endwise, and make, with the back-saw, a saw cut 
half thru the spool on the same slant as the slanting part of the 
spool; then saw straight down to the end of this slanting cut. Turn 
the spool nearly over and repeat this operation; then saw it com- 
pletely off, and whittle the spool to a good point. 
Draw a 2” circle on a piece of wood 14” thick. Draw other circles 
just as desired for coloring. Observe the directions on page 20 for 
making a wheel. When the wheel is round, bore a 5/16” hole in its 
center, sandpaper it, and glue it in place on the spool and spindle. 
It can be colored with crayons or water colors.

TOM-TOM DRUM—Piar 6. 
As in a violin, the sounding qualities of this drum depend upon 
the quality of the wood used and the thickness of the sounding-board. 
Spruce is a good wood to use, though the drum-stick may well be 
harder. 
A good way to make two pieces the same length and thickness is 
to plane one piece, which is wider than the two pieces combined, to 
the right length and thickness, and then saw it in two lengthwise; 
so, to make the top and between pieces it will be best to start with 
one piece about 6”x7@"x5/16”. If no wood ¥%” thick for the sounding- 
boards is at hand, plane a thicker piece nicely on all surfaces 
3”x2"x5/16". Then gage a line 1%” from each broad surface all 
around the piece and saw between these lines. To plane these two 
pieces, lay them on the board described in the foot-note on page 19. 
Glue and nail the parts together with very small brads, or pins 
cut off 14”. Allow the glue to dry six to ten hours before twisting 
the drumstick in the strings. Cut a small notch near the ends of 
the top pieces in which to wind two or three strands of string. Twist 
the drumstick in the opposite way from which it should strike the 
sounding-board. To play it, hold it in the left hand, and let the 
fingers of the right hand slide over the end of the drum-stick, thus 
making the drum-stick strike the sounding-board.

POP-GUN—PLatTE 7. 
The part of this model difficult to make is a nice, smooth hole. 
The surest way is to start with a thick piece of wood for the barrel, 
6"x14"x1%". Draw a 7” circle on one end; then bore the 7/16” 
hole as straight as possible, starting at the center of the circle. Stop 
boring as soon as the spur of the bit pricks thru the other end, and 
draw another 7%” circle, setting the needle-point of the compass in 
the tiny hole made by the spur; then finish boring. Next plane the 
piece round the size of the circles. The ramrod should be made as 
directed on page 16. The hole should now be sandpapered by wrap- 
ping a long, narrow piece of sandpaper snugly about the ramrod, 
and tying it securely at each end with string. Make the handle, be- 
ing careful to bore the hole straight 1” deep, and glue the ramrod 
into it. 
Cut off 34” of that part of a cork which fits tightly in the barrel. 
Drive a slender nail or brad thru a piece of hard leather (or zine 
or copper) and trim it round 14” diameter. Drill a small hole ex- 
actly in the center of the end of the ramrod, then drive the nail thru 
the center of the cork and into the ramrod. 
To make the hole in the barrel still better, let a few drippings 
from a candle fall into it and quickly insert the ramrod and push it 
back and forth rapidly. A sudden push of the ramrod will blow the 
other cork out with a loud pop. To keep this cork, tie one end of a 
string around it and the other end around the barrel.

WHISTLE—P.atz 7. 
The size of the chamber, of the notch, of the inlet for air, the 
force with which air is blown in,—these are some of the conditions 
which affect the tone of a whistle. 
Plane a piece of close-grained wood 6"x34"x34”. This length is 
suggested so that two trials at boring can be made. Bore a 14” hole 
21%4” deep. To help in boring this straight, clamp a straight-edge 
(the ruler may do) in the vise together with the square stick. Have 
one edge of the straight-edge on the center of one side of the stick. 
After boring a straight hole, draw pencil lines 3/16” from the long 
edges on all four sides. A good way to draw such lines is to rest the 
middle finger-nail on a side of the stick as a guide and hold the 
pencil closely over this nail while sliding it along. The hand must 
be held rather rigid. Practice will enable one to draw lines quite ac- 
curately this way. Place the stick in the vise so that one edge is 
straight up, and plane the corner off to the line. Plane all four cor- 
ners so as to make a good octagonal stick. Make a dowel (see page 
11) about 114” long to fit nicely in the hole. Do not crowd it so 
hard as to split the whistle. It might well be fitted first in a 4” 
hole bored in a waste piece of wood. Plane off a side of this dowel 
till a flat place is made 3%” wide. Push the dowel into the whistle 
and saw the straight end of the notch about 3/16” deep. Pare the 
rest of the notch with knife or chisel, testing the whistle by blowing 
it occasionally as the paring proceeds. When it sounds best, glue the 
dowel in place and allow it to dry before sawing it off and cutting 
the slanting part. When this is done saw the whistle to a length of 
2%". If a rolling sound is desired, put in a pea before gluing the 
dowel in place.

ARROW—P.ateE 8. 
The old saying, “Straight as an arrow,” suggests an arrow’s most 
important quality: it must be straight. Saw a strip 20’x}4” from 
the edge of a straight-grained spruce board and plane it according to 
directions on page 16. To make the notch for the bow-string, first 
file a notch in the smaller end, then saw it 14” deep, and smooth it 
with the folded edge of a piece of sandpaper. Bind the larger end 
tightly with rather small, soft wire. (See page 16.) Pigeon feath- 
ers are easiest to use because the quills are soft and straight. Turkey 
and goose feathers are good, and hen feathers will do if they 
are nearly straight. The quill should be split with the point of a 
small, sharp knife, the feather being held on a cutting board. About 
3” of quill are needed. With scissors, trim the feather. about 5/16” 
wide; then glue and pin it in place 114” from the smaller end of the 
arrow. Indians use three feathers, but two will do for a boy. When 
the feathers are in place, the ends of the quills must be bound very 
smoothly and tightly with thread. Notice the position of the feathers 
in Plate 8: the bottom feather on the arrow having three feathers is 
called the cock-feather and should be of a different color from the 
other two. It is always placed or t) 2 bowstring away from the bow.

BOW—PL ate 8. 
Almost any tough stick that will bend to a good curve will answer 
for a bow, but white ash such as is used in hoe- and rake-handles is 
probably best and easiest to get. A brittle wood like hemlock can be 
used, if used with great care; indeed, some Eskimos, who can get 
only dry, brittle driftwood, still make a splendid bow by wrapping it 
completely with sinew. The bow should be shorter than the archer. 
Plane each end tapering, first on the bottom, then on the two edges. 
Leave 6” in the middle straight for a handle. Notice the shape, 
   Timber- hitch knot Fig. 2 Bowline-knot 
Plate 8, of the three steps in the planing of the bow. Be especially 
careful to get the second step right, then the third will come easily. 
File notches near each end somewhat the shape of the loop on the 
bowstring. Before the bow can be finished, it must be strung and 
pulled a little to test it—to see if both ends bend the same good 
curve,—not the curve of a circle, but that of the broad side of an 
ellipse. The ends should’ curve more than the middle. When it bends 
true, smooth it well with a coarse file, or glass, and sandpaper. Do 
not be tempted to pull the bow too far and so break it; one that bends 
easily is less apt to break than one that is too strong. When the bow 
is strung, the center of it and of the bowstring should be marked with 
thread or color. 
A piece of strong fish-line makes a good bowstring. A good one 
can be made of Jinen thread on the string machine shown on Plate 34. 
Tie knots as shown in Fig. 2. The timber-hitch should be kept 
in place on the bow, and the bowline-knot slipped back on the bow 
when it is unstrung. The best way to string a bow is to place the end 
having the timber-hitch on the ground against one’s left foot, then to 
pull the middle of the bow with the left hand, and to push the upper 
part with the right hand, allowing this hand to slide upward so as 
to shove the bowline-knot into the upper notch. When finished the 
bow can be improved by rubbing it well with grease.

SWORD—P.ateE 9. 
Plane the blade to size, then draw a center line on each side, and 
lay out the curves for the point and handle. Shape these ends with 
the draw-knife, spokeshave, or block-plane. Now measure 5” for the 
handle, and draw a line along the center of each edge to mark the 
cutting edges of the sword. A workman would do this with his pen- 
cil resting over his finger-nail as mentioned on page 32. Use the 
spokeshave to pare off the four corners (to sharpen the sword), and 
finish them with a plane. Try to take broad, flat chips so as to make 
the blade a good diamond shape. Where the blade and handle meet 
a good square shoulder must be made. A boy can do this best, per- 
haps, with a wide, flat file, though a workman would use a back-saw 
and chisel. 
Saw out the guard 5”x3”x14""; then draw the diamond 114” long 
and 14” wide. It is not easy for a boy to cut this out, so be careful 
and guard against splitting the board. First drill small holes at each 
end of the diamond, then bore other holes as large as will go within 
the diamond, Plate 9. With a thin chisel pare straight thru the 
board onto a cutting board. When the diamond will fit the blade, 
draw the shape of the guard freehand and pare the edges as explained 
for the buzzer on page 20. Sandpaper both parts of the sword, and 
fasten the guard with glue and two 2” brads, driven from each edge 
of the guard in holes drilled for the purpose.

MAGIC BOX—P ate 10. 
This is truly a magic box to those who do not understand how it 
works. Who would ever think that these little bits of people would 
hop up and down inside their house just because their window was 
rubbed with a piece of leather? Try it and see how excited they get. 
If the worker can cut glass, make the box first, otherwise he must 
get a piece of glass 514”x3” and build the box to fit it. It requires 
careful work to make a good box, so be sure that all ends and edges 
are square and that corresponding parts are the same size before nail- 
ing it together. Plane all such small boards in the bench-hook. Make 
the ends first 1” wide and as long as the glass is wide. Make the 
sides the same width and as long as the glass, plus the thickness of 
the two ends. Glue and nail these to the ends, keeping the bottom 
edges flush. Set all nails with a nail-set. 
One edge and one end only of the bottom should now be planed 
square, the other edge and end being left to plane after the bottom i 
nailed in place. Cut a piece of tin 1/16” smaller than the glass, o: 
glue some tinfoil on the inside of the bottom. If tinfoil is to be used, 
smooth it on a piece of paper carefully with the fingers; then spread 
some glue thinly over the bottom, and lay the tinfoil on it. The 
squared edge and end of the bottom are to be nailed first, ae 
them fit nicely; then the other edge and end. Never drive a nail 
too near the corner of the bottom lest it strike the nails driven 
thru the sides of the box. Now plane the end and then the side o 
the bottom to fit. If tin is used instead of tinfoil put it inside th 
box after the bottom has been nailed in place. Make the two sup- 
ports fit inside the box lengthwise and just wide enough to hold the 
top of the glass flush with the top edges of the box. To hold the sup- 
ports, drive nails thru the ends of the box into them. 
Everything about electrical apparatus should be clean and dry, so 
as this is really an electric box, have the glass and tin clean before 
using it. Put some bits of charcoal, paper, straw, or sawdust int 
the box, have it warm and dry, rub the glass with a piece of leathe 
(glove, shoe), and then see how the little people jump! The ex

planation is as follows: Rubbing glass with leather, fur, woolen, or 
silk generates electricity; this electricity attracts non-electrified 
bodies, thus lifting the little people to the glass; as soon as they be- 
come charged with the electricity on the glass, they are repelled and 
thrown down to the tin; the tin conducts their charge of electricity 
away, and they are ready to begin their circus over again.

PENCIL-BOX—Puare 10. 
To make this box, saw out one long piece for the sides and ends, 
22”x174"x14”, or two shorter pieces, 12”x174"x4". The reason for 
having them so long is because it is difficult to make the groove nicely 
to the end of the board; and they are wide enough to try twice to 
make the groove. 
File a nail (about 3/32” in diameter) sharp like a chisel, and 
drive it tightly into a small hole, drilled in a block of wood which 
  has one corner rabbeted, that is, sawed away as shown in Fig. 3. The 
outside of the nail, measured from the shoulder of the rabbet, must 
be exactly 14” away, so that the lower edge of the groove will be 
¥4" from the top of the box. Practice with this tool till a good groove 
can be made in waste lumber, then make the groove along one edge 
of the board. When well done, plane the board 13%” wide, and saw 
it to the proper lengths for sides and ends. In the front end there 
is no groove, so plane it away from one piece just sawed. Sandpaper 
the flat sides before gluing and nailing them together. Prepare the 
bottom as directed for the magic box, page 38, then sandpaper, glue 
and nail it in place. Set all nails. Plane the bottom to fit. Pre- 
pare the cover somewhat too long but exactly the width between the 
grooves. As in making the whistle, page 32, so here draw pencil 
lines for the bevel 34” wide on the cover. Practice planing a bevel 
on waste wood first. The bevel at the further end of the cover can be 
planed by holding the cover upright in the vise. When it slides 
smoothly in the grooves, saw it the right length. For the notch, make 
a deep cut with a gouge, and cut the chip straight across with knife 
point or small chisel. Hold it in the bench-hook while doing this.

    42 MANUAL TRAINING TOYS,   
TELEPHONE—P ate 11. 
In these days when even boys are using wireless telegraphy, this 
may seem a humble telephone, but it is a surprisingly good one, and 
it is very easily made and operated. The drum should be hard and 
tight, the string should be a small, hard cord (tho the common pink 
cord thoroly waxed with paraffin will do), and the cord should be 
supported by nothing but the drums when the telephone is being used. 
After preparing the eight sides, observe in Plate 11, the method o 
nailing four boards of equal width together to form a square,—each 
one is nailed to another one. The ends of the boxes should be well 
rounded with sandpaper before the drum is stretched over them. 
The best material for the drum is rawhide,—the dried skin of an 
animal. The skin of a small animal like the cat, rabbit, or wood- 
chuck is best. Country boys will not have much difficulty in secur- 
ing such rawhide, but city boys may. To remove the hair, or fur, 
from a skin, slack a lump of lime as large as a hen’s egg in a basin 
of water and soak the skin in it until the hair can be pulled off read- 
ily (usually a few minutes) ; then thoroly wash the skin, stretch it 
over one end of a box, and tack it every 34” with 2 oz. tacks. When 
thoroly dry it will be “tight as a drum” and ready to use. A good 
drum can also be made of an old (dressed) kid glove or shoe. yh 
a piece 4” sq. in water a few minutes then stretch it while still wet, 
tightly over the box. When dry, coat it on both sides with melted 
paraffin. Fasten the cord to the drum simply by a knot on the in- 
side. If common pink cord is used, drive the paraffin in with a hot 
flat-iron. 
To use the telephone, a boy at each end of the line holds his box 
so that the string will not touch anything, then one talks into ti 
box while the other listens in his. The telephone may be stretched 
from one house to another if the houses are within several hundred 
feet of each other and have a free space between. If two telephones 
were provided, a person could talk and listen at the same time.

HAPPY JACK WINDMILL.—Ptare 12. 
On a windy day “Happy Jack” will be a whole circus out on 
clothes-line post. If he can be painted in bright colors so much th 
better, otherwise he should be decorated with colored pencils. 
The body is drawn on a board, 9”x2”x14”, by measuring all th 
figures from the hat down, and at these points drawing lines sn 
across the board; also, draw a center-line from head to heel. The 
toes and hat rim split easily, so be careful of these parts. If no 
scroll-saw is at hand, saw every 3¢” with the back-saw straight across 
from the edge of the board to the outline of the body; then pare thes 
little pieces away with a knife or chisel. The curves at the neck are 
best made with a No. 6 bit before sawing. The curves may be fin- 
ished with half-round file or sandpaper. Take great care in ee 
the hole up the legs and across the shoulders; if a hole is starte 
crooked, glue in a dowel of the same wood (see Dowels, page 11), 
let it dry, and then try again. Use a straight-edge as a guide, as 
for the whistle, page 32. A No. 3 bit is used thru the shvuulders, 
and a No. 4 bit up the legs. To make the arms, use a 14” hard woe 
dowel 6” long. Bore 14” holes for the vanes 14” each side the center 
of the dowel and file the wrists, before sawing it in two. Round the 
ends some with sandpaper. Flatten the 4” wire which goes thru th 
shoulders enough to keep it from turning in the arms. Drill hol 
in the arms to hold the wire firmly. To plane the vanes thin at the 
broad end, use the board mentioned at the bottom of page 19. When 
gluing and nailing the vanes in the arms, remember that one lies fla 
and the other nearly edgewise; also remember to make them bal: 
ance. Bore a 3/16” hole in the center of the base and glue the dowel 
into it. Before trying to fasten “Happy Jack” to a post drill hole 
in the base for nails or screws.

The drawing is made on squares so that it may be enlarged easily 
to any size. Keep the same number of squares but make them any 
size desired; 34” is a good size. The hat, being made separate from 
the body, should not be drawn on the same board. | 
To make the hat without a lathe, make two wheels of soft ha 
round one edge of the larger, and glue and nail the smaller one o 
it. Saw the head slanting to make a flat place for the hat, as sho 
in side view of hat, Plate 13. The space between the legs should 
cut out with a turning or key-hole saw, tho it can be worked out a

ent shapes.* Kites have been made large enough to carry a man high 
in the air. The adjustments of a kite are so subtle that muc 
patience is sometimes needed to make it fly. That is why the rather 
elaborate bridle is suggested for the paper covered kite with tail. It 
will require a little longer stay in the workshop, but it will save time 
outdoors. 
To make the spine and crosspiece, saw a 14” strip from the edge 
of a 7%"straight-grained spruce board 3 ft. long; then saw this strip 
again lengthwise, and plane the two pieces 3 ft.x3¢"x™%4". Mark the 
center of the crosspiece and a point 8” from the top of the spine, and 
plane each end tapering thinner to 3/16”. In each end saw a slo 
3/16” deep, Plate 15. Glue and bind securely the middle of the 
crosspiece to the 8” point on the spine. Notice that the last few 
strands go around the others. Test the sticks to see that they are 
square with each other. This can be done by measuring from on 
end of the spine to each end of the crosspiece. Put a cord that will 
not stretch around the ends of the sticks, in the slots, and tie it 
tightly. Bind this cord into each slot in such a manner that it wil 
not slip, and at the same time wind the sticks so that they will mi 
split beyond the slot. While doing this, one must measure agai’ 
from each end of the spine to the ends of the crosspiece so that the 
two halves of the kite will be equal. 
Cover the kite with strong, light paper. Glue the paper to the 
sticks, and fold it over the string 14". Try to have the string bs 
in the crease of the fold. Strengthen the corners with another piec 
of paper, 2” wide. 
To make an adjustable bridle, wind a cord twice around the spine 
near its top and tie it tightly on the front side, keeping the knot i 
the middle. Little holes will, of course, have to be made in the pape r.

Cut the cord about 2” long and tie bowline-knot, Fig. 2, p. 34. 
Measure on the crosspiece 10” from the center, and down the spine 
12” from the crosspiece, and tie three more such knots. Double 
two cords, about 40” long, and tie them in one big knot, called 
the flying-knot, to make a loop about 1” long to which to fasten 
the anchor line. Mark a point on the spine 10” below the cross- 
piece. Hold the flying-knot here, and fasten two cords to the loops 
on the crosspiece with two or three half-hitches, Plate 15. Now 
bring the flying-knot 2” above the crosspiece and out from the kite 
far enough to make these two cords taut. Fasten another cord to the 
loop at the upper part of the spine. Adjust the remaining cord as 
taut as the others. | 
A flat kite like this always needs a tail, and the most bothersome 
tail ever made is that familiar kind made of paper and string. To 
make a convenient, serviceable, and easily-made tail use strips, 3” 
wide, of bunting, cheese-cloth, or any soft, light cloth. 
In a high wind a longer tail is needed than in a light wind. If 
the kite seems too unsteady, pull it down, and try to adjust the bridl 
or the tail, before an accident occurs. If the kite dives, let go tnd 
string just before the kite reaches the ground so that it will not 
strike the ground with force enough to smash the kite. When let- 
ting out string rapidly, always protect the hand with a cloth or glove 
lest the string cut thru the skin. If in doubt about the strength of 
the anchor-line, two boys can very quickly test it 100 ft. or so at a 
time as it is being let out; one does not want the string to break 
when the kite is high in the air.

TAILLESS KITE—P tare 15. 
If one has to fly a kite amid many obstructions of trees, wires, 
and houses, one will appreciate the advantage of a tailless kite. Such 
a kite has to be more accurately made, however, and should be cov- 
ered with cloth. 
When making the bow, file notches near the slot at each end 
in the same manner as for the bow, Plate 8, in which the twisting 
string will be fastened later. Lash the middle of the bow to a point 
Y” from the top of the spine. In the slots, put the cord which 
goes around the kite, measuring carefully to keep the two sides the 
same size. Sew a piece of colored cambric over the kite. Tie the 
middle of a strong cord 6% feet long to the filed notch at one end 
of the bow with three half-hitches, as shown in Plate 15. Pass one 
part of this cord around the other notch, and fasten it in the same 
manner; then tie the two ends together with a square knot. Make 
the dowel for twisting the two cords on the back of the bow so as 
to bend the bow as desired. Into one end of the dowel drive a small 
brad and file it sharp. How much to bend the bow can be determined 
only by trying the kite. As the bow bends, the cloth becomes looser, 
and it is this looseness of the cloth which so holds the wind that the 
kite will fly without a tail. After twisting the cords enough, slip 
them towards the end of the dowel away from the spur, and rest the 
spur in the back of the spine. 
Tie a string around both the top and the bottom. ends of the 
spine for the bridle. The flying-knot should come as far as the end 
of the bow; or, some tie the lower end of the bridle about 14” from 
the lower end of the spine, and make the flying-knot about 9” in 
front and 2” above the bow.

BOX KITE—P ate 15. 
In a gale too strong for other kites, a box kite will fly safely. The 
bridle is very easy to adjust, and the kite, tho somewhat more elab- 
orate than the others, is not difficult to make. Thin sticks like these 
can be sawed from the edge of a straight-grained board. An easy 
way to make the notches in the ends of the braces is to clamp them 
all in the vise at once, flat surfaces together, and then saw them out 
with a back-saw. This method presupposes that the uprights are 
all planed the same thickness. If they are unequal in thickness, saw 
the notches.as wide as the thinnest upright and pare the others each 
to fit its proper upright. In any construction like this, which has a 
number of parts fitting together, it is well to number the adjacent 
parts so that they may be put together again, each in its place. Tiit- 
tle nicks are cut with a knife on the four edges of the braces where 
the lashing is to be wound. When all the sticks are fitted together, 
glue the braces to the uprights 434” from the ends; two frames 
are thus made just alike. The lashing is done with large thread. 
Start it with two turns around the brace, then once around the up- 
right, then once around the brace, then again around the upright, 
and so continue. The last few turns should be around the brace. 
See that the thread goes from the brace to the upright in the way 
most favorable for holding. When all the lashing is done, measure 
the center of each brace. Put one frame thru the other, and drive a 
pin thru the two centers. Now the frames must be brought to a 
1414” square by means of strong thread. Near the top of one 
upright tie a 6 ft. thread, leaving a short end. Simply wind the 
long end twice around each upright, and tie the end with a bow-knot 
until all sides of the square can be measured and adjusted. When 
all sides are equal, make the bow-knot into a square knot. Wind 
some thread around each upright, except the first, in such a manner 
as to hold the long thread securely. Now adjust the other end of the 
kite in the same way. Measure 834” from the ends of each up- 
right and put other threads around the square. These can be fast- 
ened at each upright after the first by three half-hitches.

The kite may be covered either with cloth or paper. If cloth is 
used, the edges should be hemmed. If paper, lay it on the floor, put 
glue on each upright, then press the paper to one upright. Wrap the 
paper around the kite and wind string around it several times to hold 
it while adjusting and pressing each corner. Glue the ends of the 
paper next, pulling them as tight as possible. Two flat-irons will hold 
the ends while drying. After the paper is on, its edges should be 
strengthened with a narrow ribbon of cloth glued to it. 
Tie the bridle strings just above and below the upper cell and 
have the flying-knot 5” in front of the end of the brace.

KITE-STRING SAILBOAT—Puare 16. 
To send messages up to his kite, many a boy has made a hole in 
a piece of paper and watched that go sailing up his anchor line. This 
sailboat will do that, and other things too, and come spinning down 
again to take another message. A parachute, made of a paper nap- 
kin, having a 12” thread running to each corner and a nail for 
ballast tied where the four threads are knotted together, can be sent 
up by this messenger, released, and allowed to float down from a 
great height. Paper gliders sent up this way will do many “stunts” 
before they reach ground. Fold a flimsy paper napkin in such a 
way as to hold a bunch of confetti with a pin thru only three or four 
thicknesses of the napkin. This can be tied to the keel and the 
pin withdrawn by the release and fall of a nail, and, behold, a shower 
of confetti! Be sure the falling nail will do no injury where it 
strikes. (See Frontispiece. ) 
A light, frail model like this will require considerable time and 
patience to make and adjust so that it will work. Make the hull and 
posts from a stick about 13” long. Bore the 3/16” holes for the 
mast and keel, the former a little to the left (port, a sailor would 
say) of the center and 214” from the bow, the latter in the cen- 
ter 2” from the stern. Make the wheels of the ends of spools by 
sawing them off just where the straight portion begins, and glue- 
ing them together on a hard dowel. Very accurately find their cen- 
ters and drill holes for 1” brads which form their axles. Drive 
these into the post so that the wheels run very freely. Do not nail 
the posts to the hull till the wire parts have been put in place. Make 
three staples of pins and drive them in the bottom of the hull so that 
a fine wire will just slide thru them easily. Three are used so that 
the wire will always be held straight. Next make the two eyes which 
hold the kite-string under the wheels. Coiled around once and a 
half, the coils must be separated enough to allow the string to slip 
between. The safety of the model, swinging violently high in the 
air, depends upon these eyes. They can be driven thru small, tight 
holes and bent on the under side to make them secure. They must 
be just high enough to allow the string to run free. The forward

one is elongated because the kite-string slants upward so much. 
Bend the 4” wire trigger three times around a brad driven in a 
piece of wood for convenience. To handle wire readily for such work 
as this, two pliers will be found useful. Saw a notch in the bow 
just wide enough for this coil. Now glue and nail the posts in 
position. 
Make the mast, all the spars, in fact, smaller at the outer end. 
Rig it completely before gluing the mat in place. Be sure that the 
booms will swing over the forward wheel, so as not to interfere with 
its easy running. The sails should be of light cloth. The booms 
and the gaffs (see Plate 30 for names of parts) must swing freely 
on the mast, so as to fold together when the trigger is released. For 
the main-sheets, use thread tied with a long loop to slip over the 
fine wire part of the trigger. A cork 114” in diameter, slit to the 
center, can be put on the kite-string far enough from the kite to be 
safe from any entangling. On the keel, fasten ballast enough (about 
1 oz.) to make the sailboat ride upright.

THE HYGROSCOPE OR WEATHER COTTAGE—Ptate 17. 
This model serves to indicate the humidity (dampness) of the 
air. It consists of the house, turntable, and figures, the turntable 
being suspended on a violin string. The violin string absorbs moist- 
ure from the air and untwists, thus causing the man to come out; 
when the air become dry the string twists tighter, thus causing the 
woman to come out. The model should be placed out doors but not 
exposed to rain or sun. 
The arches of the doorways may be made with a big bit (134”) 
or a scroll saw. If a bit is used, bore a hole for the spur first, lest 
it split the board. While boring hold the board vertically in the vise. 
The portion cut off between the doorways can be sawed with the tip 
of the back-saw if the board is laid flat on the bench-hook. The 
slanting lines at the top, also, can be sawed while held down on the 
bench-hook. After the front, back and sides are made, nail the back 
to the sides, but screw the front. When this is done, put the 
house in the vise in an upright position and plane the tops of the 
sides slanting. Notice that one roof is wider than the other. Nail 
the narrower one first, with the grain running from front to back. 
Do not drive nails into the front but nail it securely at the back 
and side. Letting the plane rest on the other side of the house, 
plane the upper edge of this roof slanting, so that the other roof will 
fit. Nail this in place; set all nails; and plane the upper edge of 
this roof slanting, letting the plane rest on the first roof. Two brads 
may now be driven near the center of the ridge-pole to hold the roofs 
together. After making the floor, place the house in position on it 
(14” from back, 14” from ends) and draw a line around the house. 
Remove the house; drive three brads straight down thru the floor; 
pull them out and start them from the under side in the same 
holes; then put the house in place again and drive the brads home. 
Put in more brads to hold the house securely. 
To make the chimney, saw a notch. 3/16” deep in the end of a 
34” square stick. If it fits on the roof, bore a 5/16” hole thru 
its center, and saw the chimney off 34” long. Glue it 34” from 
the front end of the roof. When dry, bore the hole thru the roof.

The chimney top with the dowel attached to it below is made to 
revolve so that the Hygroscope may be adjusted. To make the chim- 
ney top, bore a 14” hole into the end of a 4” dowel; then saw 
it off 14” and glue in the upper dowel. Make the turntable some- 
what round at each end. In the center of it, glue and nail the lower 
dowel. Next, paint the house if desired. The violin string is glued 
and wedged into holes in the upper and lower dowels so that the 
turntable will swing 3/16” above the floor. 
The man and woman may be made of cardboard, wood, clay, chalk 
or plaster of Paris; or they can be bought at a toy store. Painted in 
bright colors and shellacked or varnished, they look well. They can 
be made to balance on the turntable by adding a piece of lead. Of 
course, neither they nor the turntable should touch any part of the 
house as they swing around.

ELECTROPHORUS—Puare 18. 
The electrophorus consists of two parts, a pan filled with a resin- 
ous mixture, and a cover which has been completely covered with tin- 
foil. Under favorable conditions, a spark of electricity 14” long 
can be obtained from this electrophorus. The favorable conditions 
are these: The air should be dry; both parts of the electrophorus 
should be warm, dry, and clean; and the tinfoil and rosin should be 
perfectly flat, so as to come in close contact with each other. 
Make the pan and its sides as shown in Plate 18. Glue and nail 
the sides in place and round their upper edges well with sandpaper. 
To make the resinous mixture, melt a half teacup of rosin with two 
teaspoons of turpentine and about the same of paraffin in a rather 
deep dish, and pour the mixture into the pan. As all these materials 
are inflammable, perhaps the safest place to melt them is in the oven. 
After the pan is cold, test the surface of the rosin to see that it is 
flat every way. If it is not flat, sandpaper the high parts slowly with 
coarse sandpaper. 
When making the cover, observe the directions on page 20, then 
round the edge to a good half-circle. Test the cover also to see that 
it is flat, especially on its under side, for to get good sparks, the 
tinfoil and rosin must come just as close together as possible. Cut 
two circles of tinfoil 414” in diameter. Smooth them carefully 
on a piece of paper, spread glue thinly on the cover, lay the tinfoil 
on the glue, and smooth it with the fingers. Press the edges as smooth 
as possible because electricity escapes easily from sharp corners. Cover 
the larger open spaces with bits of tinfoil. Hard rubber (ebonite), 
being a non-conductor of electrity, makes the best handle. A piece 
of an old rubber comb or a fountain pen can be used for this purpose. 
To get a spark of electricity, rub the rosin with soft leather, 
fur, or woolen; place the cover on it; touch the top of the cover with 
the finger (to remove the negative electricity) ; lift the cover by the 
top of the handle; bring the edge of the cover near a finger, or other 
conductor, and a spark will fly off with a snap. It is a miniature 
flash of lightning. Some books on electricity describe many other 
experiments which can be tried.

WATERWHEEL—P uate 19. 
This waterwheel is designed to be placed in a flowing stream. A 
longer trough might well lead the water into this one so as to get 
greater speed. 
Make the trough first, being careful to make a good fit where the 
sides nail to the bottom. Nail the top 5” from the end where the 
wheel is placed. The upper corners of the axle blocks are to be cut 
off 1”. The center of the 5/16” hole for the axle is 7%” from 
the lower edge. When nailing the axle blocks in place, put a dowel 
or lead pencil thru the holes to help in nailing the blocks exactly op- 
posite each other. 
After sawing a board for the wheel 414” square, draw the diagon- 
als and diameters (cornerwise and crosswise, that means) to di- 
vide it into eight parts. Draw a 4” circle for the wheel and a 
3%” circle to mark the depth of the notches for the paddles. Shape 
the wheel. (See page 20 for directions.) Test it with the try- 
square to keep the edge square with the flat surface. Bore a 4” 
hole in the center with the greatest care, or the wheel will wobble 
sidewise. The notches are cut with the back-saw alone. One-eighth 
of an inch to one side of the eight lines across the circle, saw straight 
down to the inner circle. Be careful to hold the saw square with the 
wheel. After this saw cut is made, measure the width of the notch 
by holding the edga of a paddle so as just to cover the saw cut, and, 
with a knife point make a dot at the other side of the paddle. Hold- 
ing the trysquare against one side of the wheel and the inner edge of 
its blade over the dot, score a knife line across the edge of the wheel. 
Then saw straight down again inside this knife line. Saw cornerwise 
a few times and the wood will be removed sufficiently. The notches 
may better be too small than too large, for the paddles can be planed 
thinner to fit. Clean the wheel with the plane before nailing the pad- 
dies. All these paddles except one can be nailed with the wheel held 
in a corner of the vise. To nail that one, put a thin board upright 
in the vise and rest the wheel on its top. All nails should be started 
in the paddles, not in the wheel.

Make the axle of hard wood. Push it thru the axle blocks and 
wheel, and lock it to the wheel with a brad, Plate 19. The axle is 
made long so that a pulley (spool) can be put on and a belt (string) 
run from this to other pulleys. A leather washer outside each axle 
block keeps the wheel in the center. If the work has been carefully 
done, the paddles will not strike; if they do strike, they must be 
pared off.

WATER MOTOR—PLATE 20. 
his motor is a waterwheel designed for an ordinary hose faucet. 
Under a stream of water no bigger than a large needle, it will fairly 
buzz. If the wheel does not run exactly true on the axle, the motor 
will need legs screwed on the outside of the box. 
Make the wheel of soft wood just as true as possible. (See page 
20.) For the axle a small brass rod or a large knitting needle may 
be used. In the center of the wheel, drill a hole smaller than the 
axle so as to make a tight fit. Be very careful to bore this hole 
straight. Force the axle thru the wheel, and if the wheel wobbles 
only slightly drive wooden wedges beside the axle to force it square 
with the wheel. If it wobbles too much, plug the hole and try boring 
again. Resting the axle on the jaws of the vise, revolve the wheel 
rapidly to see where it is out of true, and patiently pare it down. 
The flat side of the wheel which wobbles only a little can be planed 
off. The strip of screen wire netting should now be tacked on the 
wheel. It is long enough to go twice around the wheel, and should 
be tacked on with a dozen small tacks. 
For suggestions about the pulley see page 56. 
Prepare a block of soft wood for the coupling. From its bottom, 
gage a line marking the height of the dovetails in which the blocks C 
and D fit 3%” on each side. Saw these dovetails 3/16” deep, 
and pare them slanting with a chisel. In the center of the top, bore 
a 1” hole, 34” deep; continue the hole thru the block with a 
¥%" bit. Bore holes 34” from the top, 14” from the ends for the 
two 114” screws which are shown in the small drawing, Plate 20. 
Gage and saw out the left-hand half of the block (as shown in the 
plate) as deep as the 1” hole. The purpose of this is to permit a 
squeezing fit on the threads of the faucet. When first trying it on 
the faucet, squeeze it hard with a hand-screw to jamb the threads 
into the wood; after that, the screws can be put in and the coupling 
attached at pleasure. A 14” hole is bored in the 14” dowel, which 
serves as a nozzle, until the spur just shows. Without allowing the 
bit to bore any farther, turn it around enough so that the spur will 
wear the wood and thus make a tapering hole as shown in the sec- 
tional drawings.
-P-A-G-E-70
68 MANUAL TRAINING TOYS. 
  
Prepare the sides, ends, and top of the box, the three blocks, the 
key wedge, and the two stops. The wedge should be 1/16” wider 
at one end than the other and should fit the dovetail. Block C 
should fit the other. In the top piece, bore a 34” hole in the mid- 
dle 1%” from the end. This hole is larger than the nozzle to al- 
low for adjustments. All these parts must now be thoroly soaked 
with paraffin. Melt the paraffin, apply it with a brush to all sur- 
faces, and drive it in with heat. During the process, the nozzle can 
be made fast in the coupling, using plenty of paraffin to make it 
water tight. See that the tiny outlet occupies the best position for 
directing the water onto the wheel. After the nozzle is cold again, 
the outlet should be carefully worked out again with the warm point 
of a big hat-pin or wire, filed to a good point. 
Put the parts together as follows: Nail one side (the right in 
the plate) to the ends; screw the other side to ends; nail top to ends 
and first side only ; nail block B to A; then A to the top. Unscrew the 
side and bore holes in the center of the sides for the axle. Make 
them fit nicely, then soak them with paraffin. Put the wheel, the 
side, the pulley, and the stops in place. Put the coupling in such 
position that the nozzle comes over the rim, of the wheel and nail 
block C. After putting two or three soft leather washers in the 
coupling screw it to the faucet, lock it to the motor, and the motor 
is ready. 
Better bearings for the axle can be made of two pieces of solder 
screwed to the inside of the sides. If these are made, the holes in 
the sides should be large enough not to touch the axle. The wheel 
and pulley can be locked to a brass axle by boring a hole thru the 
axle with a drill made of a needle. (See Drills, page 11.)

SAND WHEEL—P.ate 21. 
Fine sand will make a wheel like this spin around lively. Most 
of the parts are easily made, the wheel offering the most difficulties. 
As shown in the drawing it consists of two boxes, uprights con- 
necting the two, and a wheel with paddles swung on an axle be- 
tween the uprights. 
To make the curves on the uprights, lay them edge to edge in 
the vise and start the spur of a large bit in the crack, 114” from 
each end. If a big spool cannot be obtained for the wheel, plane out 
an octagonal block 13%” long, 1” in diameter. The slanting part of 
the spool must be whittled away. Divide one end into eight equal 
parts and drawn lines lengthwise the spool at each division. On 
  
  
  
    
  these lines, measure very carefully 11/16” from one end. Then, 
holding the spool level in the vise bore 3/16” holes half thru the 
spool at each of these dots. The easiest way to lay out the paddles 
is in one long piece as shown in Fig. 4. If lines A and B are sawed 
carefully (see page 12) they will fit the spool well enough to 
glue. The stems of the paddles go into the holes bored in the spool. 
They are easily made round by paring the corners a little, and then 
screwing them around in a 3/16” hole in a piece of hard wood. 
The ends of the paddles where the sand strikes are bevelled on the 
under side. The holes in the uprights, thru which 114” brads are 
pushed into the center of the spool, must be exactly opposite each 
other, 314” from the bottom. Little leather washers should be

put between the spool and the uprights. Now make the boxes. To 
nail the boxes to the upright follow the suggestions on page 59 for 
nailing the floor of the weather cottage. Keep the brads near the 
center of the uprights lest they split the curves. A 5/16” hole for 
the sand is bored in the upper box in such a position that the sand 
will strike near the middle of the ends of the paddles. The peg is 
tapered to fit this hole.

RUNNING WHEEL—Puate 22. 
It is fine fun for several boys to race down the street with run- 
ning wheels. Each boy can have a different kind of wheel by fol- 
lowing the suggestions on Plate 22. 
The wheel may be made any convenient size. Saw a board off 
square and plane it flat. To be sure that it is flat, it must be tested 
with a straight-edge from corner to corner, crosswise, and lengthwise. 
Draw the circle with a string pinned to the center, if a large com-

pass is not at hand. Saw it with a turning saw and finish it as sug- 
gested on page 20. Bore and countersink a hole in the center for 
a 134” flat-head screw. Make the handle and drill a small hole 
in it where the wheel is to be screwed on. Round off the upper end 
and edges of the handle so that it feels good to the hand grasping it. 
The screws used in the connecting rod should slip easily thru the 
holes at each end. Altho one arm will do, two look better. To draw 
the boy, draw as many 34” squares on the board as there are in 
Tig. 5, then sketch the outline one square at a time. To cut it out,  
-P-A-G-E-76
  74 MANUAL TRAINING TOYS.   
a scroll-saw or turning-saw is almost surely needed, tho a patient 
boy can do it with auger-bits, back-saw, knife, and file—the bits to 
be used first at all the inside angles. On the handle, must be put a 
block on which to screw the boy. To fasten the two arms loosely at 
the shoulders, the screw should be loose in the shoulder and first arm, 
and tight in the second arm. The same is true of the hands and 
flagpole. In the top of the flagpole, bore a hole to fit a small flag. 
Paint of bright colors makes the model look much more pleasing. 
An easy way to make the sliding part of the lower right-hand 
running wheel, Plate 22, is to cut out with bit and chisel a narrow 
slot thru the handle, wide enough for two screws, with washers on 
them, which screw into the block holding the flag.

RATTLE—P1iarteE 23. 
This is a noisy toy and will make a safe substitute for fire-crack- 
ers on the Fourth of July. Some of the dimensions may be changed 
to suit such a spool as can be obtained. It should be a rather deep 
spool, that is, one that held a lot of thread. 
The noise is made by the spring snanping off the slats in the spool 
as the head of the rattle is swung round and round. Draw lines 
across one end of the spool to divide it into eight equal parts. Place 
the spool endwise in the vise and, with the back-saw, cut eight notches 
a little more than 1/16” wide straight towards the opposite side of 
the spool. By sawing twice at each notch, the wood which remains 
can easily be removed with the saw held slanting. There are several 
ways of making the eight little slats which fit into these notches; 
the easiest, perhaps, is to split them from a block (156”x134’’x- 
5/16”) of a straight-grained wood, and plane them on the jig de- 
scribed at the foot of page 19. Glue them in the notches. Plane 
the back and the spring this same way. Square both ends of the back 
but do not plane it quite to width until it is glued and nailed in 
place. In the two sides, bore a 5/16” hole for the dowel, 34” from 
the end and a little over 34” from the back edge. (Holes are al- 
ways located by their centers.) This dowel must fit tightly in the 
handle and spool, and loosely in the two sides. Plane the spring 
thinner at the narrow end. It should be narrow enough and its cor- 
ners cut off enough so as not to touch the spool when it snaps. The 
handle might well be octagonal rather than round. ; 
The parts may now be put together as follows: Glue and nail 
the sides first to the thick end, second to the thin end. The dis- 
tance between the ends inside is 3 5/16”. Keep these four parts flush 
on the back edges so that the back will fit. Glue and nail the back. 
Glue the dowel in the handle. Put glue inside the spool and on 
the middle portion of the dowel, then, with the spool between the 
two sides, push the dowel thru all three holes. Glue and nail the 
spring in place. It should be as far towards the spool as it will go 
without snapping the next slat when it snaps off one slat.

CART—PLatTE 24. 
The important features of a cart are the wheels and axle and the 
tongue; if these are strong and the tongue securely fastened, almost 
any box will do for the body. Two tongues, nailed or screwed to 
the sides of the body, probably make the strongest handle, but they 
are not so good looking as the one shown in Plate 24. If this one 
is screwed to the box with six 1” screws, two in the tongue and 
two in each block, it will be strong enough. Some of the nicer boxes 
to be secured of a grocer will do for a body, tho it is better to make 
one one’s self. 
Four wheels of 14” hard wood should be made (see page 20) and 
then each two of the four glued and nailed together very securely 
with the grain crosswise. For this purpose, 134” clout, or clinch 
nails are best. Do not drive them too near the center nor the rim. 
To clinch nails, they should be driven onto a piece of iron. After 
this is done, a 7%” hole (or larger if you can get a larger stick 
for the axle) is bored straight thru the center. To cut the cylindrical 
ends of the axle, first draw a 7%” circle at the center of each end, 
then lay out and saw out two rectangular pieces, one on each side of 
the circles so as to leave a 7%” square pin, 2%4” long. Proceed 
to make these pins; first, eight sided; then, sixteen sided; then, 
round; using knife or chisel and a coarse flat file. Make the hole 
in the washers before cutting off each corner 9/16”. These wash- 
ers are to be fastened to the axle when held rather snugly against the 
wheel with two 1” screws put crosswise the grain. Before putting 
the wheels on the last time, rub the axles and holes well with hard 
soap to make them run easier. Draw a line across the bottom of the 
body 5” from the back end, and bore four screw holes thru the bot- 
tom; countersink them well on the inside of the body, and put 1” 
screws thru into the flat side of the axle. The axle is planned so that 
the wheels run within 14” of the body. 
With a curved lower edge, the tongue is 214” wide at one end 
and 134” at the other. To get the correct slant at the wide end, 
block up the cart level, have some one (or the vise) hold the tongue 
in the position wanted when finished, then with a strip of wood

about 2” wide placed upright against the front of the body, draw a 
line on the tongue. From the lowest corner of the tongue, draw an- 
other line parallel to the first, and saw off. After making the two 
blocks and fastening them securely to the tongue, saw the lower ends 
flush with! the curve of the tongue. Place the tongue in position, 
draw a line around it on the body, then bore holes where screws will 
go best into the tongue and blocks. Six 1” screws well countersunk 
will hold the tongue securely. Since the tongue is fastened to the 
front, the sides and bottom must be well nailed to it; or, the corners 
may be strengthened with a piece of tin inside and outside each cor- 
ner, tacked or riveted together. Each piece of tin should be about 
3” square. 
A piece of old bicycle frame forced tightly into the hole of a 
wheel, makes it very durable. Such a hole would doubtless have to 
be bored with an expansive bit. A bicycle frame is easily filed in two 
at some distance from the reinforced joints. Such a piece should be 
longer than the thickness of the wheel to allow filing it flush after it 
is driven in. To force it in, use a strong vise, or, after protecting it 
with hard wood, drive it slowly with a heavy hammer. 
Small carts can be made with wheels made of spools like thcse 
of the cannon. (See Plate 25.)

CANNON—P tate 25. 
This cannon will shoot small marbles very well. The force of it 
depends, of course, on the strength of the rubber bands. Because the 
ramrod and handle are rather heavy, a strong dowel is put thru the 
handle and ramrod. The rubber washer absorbs some of the shock. 
For the barrel draw a 144” circle on one end of a stick 6%4”x 
14%4"x1%”". From the center of this circle, bore a 9/16” hole straight 
thru the stick endwise, stopping as soon as the spur comes thru. Set 
the needle of the compass in this spur hole and draw a 1” circle and, 
if possible, a 114” circle; then finish boring. 
Plane the stick round to the 144” circle. To hold the stick 
while doing this, put a rod thru the hole, open the vise 614” and 
let the barrel rest endwise in the vise. Two and one-half inches from 
the breech end of the barrel, draw a line around it to limit the taper 
of the muzzle end. Plane the muzzle to the 1” circle. Two inches 
from the breech, bore a 34” hole straight thru the barrel; and into 
this hole glue the axle. After the glue is dry, bore out the barrel 
again, and sandpaper the hole well. 
Make the ramrod fit loosely in the barrel. (See directions for 
Dart, page 16.) Make the handle in the same manner as the bar- 
rel was made, except that, after drawing the 114” circle at the 
end where the spur just appears, the hole is not bored further. Glue 
the ramrod in place, and fasten it with the 3¢” dowel. The curved 
notch into which the rubber bands are tied, can be worked out 
patiently with a round file, first cutting a V-shaped notch with a 
knife. Pare the corners and sandpaper all parts well. 
The rubber washer can be made of an old rubber heel. To bore 
a hole in it, squeeze it between two boards and bore thru both to- 
gether. 
At least one of the uprights must be screwed to the base. The 
first one may be nailed. Glue and nail this one 14” from the 
edge of the base. Hold the other in place and draw a line around it. 
Bore holes for the screws, put the screws in the holes, and press the 
upright on them to mark where to bore in the upright. After boring 
in the uprights, put the cannon and upright in place, and tighten the 
screws. The wheels can be made of the ends of large spools, well 
counter-sunk for a short, large screw.

AUTOMOBILE—PLateE 26. 
Tho the motor (an elastic band) which makes this automobile go 
is a short-winded affair, still, if the wheels are easy running, it will 
go alone for a short distance on a wooden floor. A stronger elastic 
can be used if the automobile carries a load. If the parts are painted 
with bright colors before they are entirely put together, the automo- 
bile will look very well. 
First, make the body, then 414” from the front end and 34” 
from the right side, bore a 1/4” hole in the body for the steer- 
ing post. This should fit tightly so as to hold the wheels in any 
position desired. Leather washers are nailed to the post close to the 
body. The steering post must be put in place before any other parts 
are fastened to the body. 
The ends of the rails which are later fastened to the bottom of 
the body, slant %4”. The center of the holes for the axles is 34” 
beyond this slanting line and 14” above the lower edge of the 
rails. When boring these 44” holes, the rails should be clamped to- 
gether so that the holes will be exactly opposite each other. The 
forward holes are made long to allow the axles to swing back and 
forth. To make this hole, two 14” holes are bored side by side and 
the top and bottom smoothed with a 14” chisel. When nailing 
the body to the rails, put the rear axle thru the holes to aid in keep- 
ing them opposite each other. 
The forward axle is made in one piece and kept so until after the 
steering “rope” is in place. The axle must be held carefully in place 
while the brad holes are bored 14” from the outer edge of the rails 
and straight thru the center of the axle. A tight fitting brad is 
driven into this hole. The steering rope must not stretch; large, 
hard thread is suitable. Wind a piece about 18” long tightly 
around the axle about 14” from one rail and tie it. Pass one end 
thru the small screw-eyes shown in the lower drawing, and wind it 
around the axle near the other rail leaving no slack in the screw- 
eyes; then wind six to eight turns smoothly around the steering post, 
and fasten the end to tho beginning with several half-hitches. (See 
Plate 15.) A separate thread should be tied around the axle and
-P-A-G-E-87
  MANUAL TRAINING TOYS. 85 
steering rope at the second place. Should there be any slack, it can 
be taken up by laying a V-shaped thread over the steering rope near 
the axle and passing the two ends over the upper side of the axle, 
and tying them across the steering rope on the other side of the axle. 
This tends to pull the steering rope together on top of the axle. 
The wheels can be sawed from short lengths of curtain poles, ob- 
tained at a furniture store. The 14” holes for the axle, must be 
bored exactly at the center. The wheels must turn freely on the 
front axle, but be glued to the rear axle, which must itself turn freely 
in the rails. After the wheels are in place, the front axle can be 
sawed in two with a back-saw, using very short strokes, and sawing 
two cuts nearly thru before either is sawed completely. 
Nail the wind-shield to the engine, then glue both to the body. 
Nail the seat-back to the seat so that the top of the seat will be 
%" above the body, then nail the two sides to the end and to the 
seat-back and seat. Glue the whole to the body. Nails can be driven 
up thru the body into the engine, the seat back, and the end, if care 
is used in locating them. 
One end of the elastic band (motor) is tied with a bit of string 
to a brad driven in the forward end of the body of the automobile. 
On the other end of the elastic band ‘is tied a piece of string about 
8” long. This is put just under the body and above the steering 
rope and wound two or three times tightly around the rear axle 
and tied. The string and elastic band should be simply straight, the 
elastic neither stretched nor loose. To wind up the motor, move the 
automobile backwards on the floor and hold the rear wheels until 
ready to let the automobile go.

  86 MANUAL TRAINING TOYS.   
BOW PISTOL—P.ateE 27. 
For target shooting in the house, this is a fine toy. With nicely 
made arrows and a good bow, it will shoot very well. 
Make a good bow of rattan, or other tough wood. An old spoke 
of a carriage wheel could doubtless be obtained of a blacksmith or 
wheelwright, and such a hickory spoke would make a good bow. 
Make the bow much like that shown on Plate 8, 
except that it should be round at the center to 
fit the 3%” hole in the pistol. The bow-string 
should be a hard cord so that it will slip easily 
from the notches in the barrel when the trigger 
is pulled. 
Before shaping the pistol, make the groove 
in the center of one edge of the board. This 
should be made with a 3%” round plane. It can be made, however, 
with the tool shown in Fig. 6, a gouge, and a round file. This tool is 
much like the one described on page 41 tho a larger nail is used. 
Make the groove 7/32” deepgage a line 3/16” from each side of the 
board; then use the gouge inside these lines and as deep as the groove. 
When the gouging is well done, smooth the groove with a round file 
or coarse sandpaper wrapped around a pencil. 
Draw and shape the pistol. Make the lower edge of the barrel 
half round. Sandpaper it well. Make the trigger of hard wood and 
screw it on the pistol. The shape of the notch next to the trigger is 
very important but the shape of the other one is not so. Both 
notches, however, must be so smooth and well rounded as not to in- 
jure the bowstring. They should be not deeper than one-half the 
depth of the groove. 
Arrows are quickly made by sawing long strips of straight-grained 
wood, 3/16” square, planing the corners, and sandpapering; then 
cutting them 5” long, splitting the ends (see page 16), inserting a 
paper 1”x}4” and tying the end with thread.

ELASTIC GUN—PLatE 28. 
If cash carrier elastic cord about 5/16” in diameter and 18” 
long is used on this gun, it will shoot buckshot, peas, small arrows, 
ete., with considerable force; in fact, if the cord is fastened far 
enough forward, it will require all a boy’s strength to pull the rider 
back to the hook. The gun may be made of pine, whitewood or clear 
spruce. 
  
  
  Fig. 7 
To lay out the gun (see Fig. 7) first draw A\ B, then A C, then 
measure B D and draw C D; next measure the width of the barrel 
and draw E F; add 3%” below this for the gun-stock, and finally 
draw the curves freehand. To saw it out, first rip it along E F, 
then cross cut it at H F, then rip it as far the curve along C D, 
and then along the lower side of the gun-stock to meet C D, finally 
along A B. Of course, none of this sawing should quite touch the 
lines. Plane to these lines wherever possible, then use the spoke- 
shave. The curve and corner at F should be pared with a chisel. 
The lower edge of the gun-stock and barrel is made half-round, but 
the upper edge, especially where the spring is screwed, is only slightly 
round. The curve at the butt of the gun-stock should be cut out with 
the turning-saw, and rounded with a half-round file. The groove can 
be made as in the bow pistol. (See page 86.) 
All parts of the gun should be well sandpapered, especially where 
the elastic will rub on the barrel. 
Make the trigger of tough wood.

Bore a %4” hole for the trigger post about 34” from the 
back end of the groove, making it slant forward about 34”. Make 
this hole smooth as possible. Where the hole comes thru the gun- 
stock, start the mortise in which the trigger belongs. This should 
be 3%” deep and an easy fit for the trigger. Put the trigger in 
place, and drill a small hole straight thru the gun-stock and trigger. 
Consider carefully where to bore this hole so that it will not come too 
near the edge of the trigger. Insert a good-fitting brad and see if the 
trigger post will move up and down about 14”. Do not make the 
mortise so long that the trigger post will slip by the trigger. 
Now make the spring of hard wood. Pare the curve from each 
end with a chisel, holding the spring endwise in the bench-hook. The 
holes for the screw and the hook must be large enough so that the 
spring will not be split, and yet the hook must be screwed in strongly 
to hold the elastic. The hook must be filed off enough, and slanting, 
so that the screw-eye in the rider will slide under it and be caught. 
The rider is the hardest part to make because it is small and 
must be of hard wood; also, the block must be nicely fitted into the 
long piece. Make the lower edge of the long piece round so as to 
slide well in the groove. Bore a 5/16” hole thru the block endwise 
the grain, countersink the ends, and smooth them so that they can- 
not injure the elastic. Next lay out, saw, and chisel a notch 5/16” 
deep in the long piece in which the block will fit snugly. Glue it 
and nail it from the under side, or put in a 14” screw. Holes will 
have to be bored carefully for either brads or screw. Bore a hole, and 
put the screw-eye in such a position that it will slide under the hook 
with a snap. Be careful not to twist the eye off in this hard wood. 
The back end of the eye might well be filed somewhat slanting so 
as to slip under the hook better. 
Put the elastic thru the rider, snap the rider on the hook, and 
pull the ends of the elastic as far as seems best,—don’t have it too 
strong! Where the ends of the elastic are pulled, bore two 14” 
holes thru the barrel one above the other. Bind the elastic securely 
between these holes; to make it doubly secure, wind a string between 
the elastic and the barrel to pull the first strings closer together.

Now saw off the ends of a spool about 14” and screw them to 
the barrel in such a place that they will hold the elastic, without 
stretching, against the sides of the barrel. These spools should turn 
easily. They cannot be placed exactly opposite because the screws 
will interfere. : 
Snap the rider to the hook, pull the trigger, and notice that the 
rider goes up with the trigger post. To hold it down, put a slender 
34” screw on each side of the groove in such a place that the screw 
heads will come over the outside of the screw-eye; or, 1” brads may 
be bent over the screw-eye. When everything is in working order, 
drive a 1” brad on each side of the spring to keep the hook always in 
place.

RATTLE-BANG GUN—P ate 29. 
For boys who want to play soldier, here is a gun which will make 
a big noise but will not hurt anybody. 
First, make the rattle of maple. The slot in it can be made with 
the rip-saw. The solid end must be nicely squared to fit the for- 
ward end of the pocket cut out of the gun-stock. Here it must be 
held firmly in place by glue and two screws. One screw is put 
slanting from the top of the gun-stock; the other is put straight 
from the bottom. That the rattle may sound the loudest, it must 
not touch anywhere else than this solid end. When putting the 
knocker and trigger in place, see that they also do not touch the 
rattle. The gun-stock is made like that of the elastic gun (Plate 28) 
except that it has to be 23%” wide in that portion which holds 
the, rattle. The pocket is 314” from the forward end and 114” 
deep where the solid part of the rattle fits. To put the slanting 
screw in nicely, a place must be cut out with a small chisel for its 
head, 34” deep and 14” away from the pocket. Clamp the rattle in 
position, bore a hole for the screw, then glue and screw the rattle in 
place. Before the glue is dry, see that the rattle is straight, then 
put the lower screw into it. 
Make the knocker of maple. The reason for the triangular notch 
in its bottom edge will be evident when the trigger is turned around. 
The stiffer the spring is, the harder, of course, it will strike the rat- 
tle, and also, the harder the trigger will turn; 1%” will be thick 
enough for the thinnest place. 
The trigger should also be of maple. Join it with a cross-lap 
joint. (See page 24.) Then, holding each end successively up- 
tight in the vise, draw the slanting lines and saw for 3%” length- 
wise in such a way as to leave 1/16” flat on each of the two 
adjacent surfaces. After sawing endwise, saw the little corner pieces 
off crosswise. The trigger has to withstand considerable pulling, so 
it should fit nicely, yet easily, a 1” screw in its center. Before 
screwing either the knocker or the trigger in place, lay both on the 
gun-stock so that they will engage properly; then mark the place for 
the screws, drill holes, and screw them on. If the knocker touches

the rattle, take it off and plane a slanting chip or two where it is 
screwed to the gun-stock. A thin leather washer 54” in diameter 
will prevent the trigger touching. A little soap will make the trig- 
ger turn easier.

The barrel may well be made of a broomstick. To make it fit on 
the top of the gun-stock, saw it down the middle and cut off the lower 
half. Before fastening it in place, be sure that it will not touch the 
sounding part of the rattle. 
A still louder and more difficult rattle to make is shown in Fig. 
8. Most boys would find it impossible to a bore a 1” hole endwise in 
maple. The knocker and trigger would both have to be set out from 
the gun-stock.

BOAT—P ate 30. 
This boat is designed rather heavy to insure good service. It has 
ballast and beam enough to right itself even tho the sails do get wet. 
If a better looking boat is desired, draw the deck more slender; hol- 
low the hull with bit and gouge; pare the gunwales with the spoke- 
shave to give it some sheer; and nail on a thin deck. Soft pine is 
the best wood for the hull and spruce for the spars. 
To lay out the hull, draw a center-line lengthwise on top, bot: 
tom, and ends of the block of wood. Make all the measurements 
given on the deck; (top of the hull, Plate 30) first lengthwise, then 
crosswise. Square with the deck, the curve should be worked out 
with rip-saw and spokeshave. The stem should next be undercut 
with the saws (rip and crosscut) so as to make place for the rudder. 
On the bottom leave a flat place 7%4”x14” for the keel to fit; then 
round the hull as suggested by the sectional drawings at AB and CD. 
Make the keel and nail it securely in place. From the under 
side of the boat and slanting the same as the keel and under-cut, 
bore a 54” hole for the stem of the rudder. 
Make the rudder and tiller of 14” wood. The little mortise in 
the tiller can be cut with a small chisel after a 3/16”. hole is bored 
at its center. For the wheel, make a dowel about 2” long and into 
one end of it bore a hole about 1” deep for a 114” screw. Saw a 
piece from this end 5%” long and screw it to the deck about 14” in 
front of the hole bored for the rudder. The wheel should turn rather 
hard so as to stay in any position desired. 
To make the spars, (mast, boom, etc.,) follow the directions on 
page 16. Use large screw-eyes in the gaff and boom (or see Plate 
16, “method of swinging booms to mast”) and a very small one at 
the top of the mast. To nail the bowsprit securely, place it 1” back 
of the prow, drive a 1” brad thru it near the prow, and one on each 
side of it 34” back. Bend these latter over the bowsprit before they 
are driven in their full length. An upward slant is given to the 
bowsprit by planing its larger end slanting to fit the deck. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  96 MANUAL TRAINING TOYS.   
The rudder is hung on two staples made of pins. Two headless 
pins are driven into the rudder and bent down at right angles to slip 
into these staples. In order that the stem of the rudder may turn 
enough, ‘the rudder must be hung close to the hull. Each “rope” 
of the rigging should have its own screw-eye (or staple) and cleat on 
the deck. The cleat (a device for fastening a “rope” in any position, 
by winding it back and forth) is simply two slender brads driven 
slanting. 
The mainsail should be 9” on the mast and 11” at its outer edge. 
It should be hemmed and properly fastened to the spars. On the 
mast, fine wire rings or loops of thread may be used. The jib should 
extend 9” up the stay (the “rope” from the end of the bowsprit to 
the top of the mast) and be either sewed to it or made to slide on 
it with small rings of wire. 
Ballast can be cut (with tin-shears or saw) from lead pipe and 
>ailed to the keel. To drive brads thru lead, pinch them between 
the thumb and finger, and drive them gently. 
For convenience in holding the boat when it is out of the water, 
make a dry dock as shown in the drawing.

PILE-DRIVER—P.ateE 31, 
In wet, soft soil, wherever any building operations are to be un- 
dertaken, long, straight logs called piles have first to be driven to 
support the foundation. In wet soil they never rot; those driven 
for the building of Venice centuries ago are still solid. If holes 
are bored in the weight of this toy pile-driver, it is made more ef- 
fective. 
This is not a difficult model if each part is well made. It is im- 
portant, however, to nail it in the following order: Runs to up- 
rights, uprights to sides, sides to base, top to uprights, braces to up 
rights, then to base. The ends of the braces are mitered, that is, 
sawed, like the corner of a picture-frame, on the diagonal of a square. 
The axle of the little spool is made by two 1” brads, and it rests in 
notches as near the end of the top blocks as is convenient to file 
them. It is held in place by little brads, or pins crossed over it, or 
by a staple made of a pin. A crank for the big spool (called the 
drum) is made of a 3” piece of stiff wire. It should be flattened 
enough not to turn in the drum. Fasten the string to the drum thru 
a little hole drilled thru its rim. If the string comes off the upper 
spool, put a large screw-eye into the top piece and pass the string 
thru it.

WINDMILL—PrateE 32. 
On a hilltop, exposed to every wind that blows, one of these 
windmills made by a boy has been spinning around for four years. 
The windmill in this form serves also as a weathervane. Pine is the 
best wood for this model. To withstand the weather, the model 
should be painted. 
After planing the post to size, lay out the chamfers (see page 
82) with a pencil on all four sides. The curve should be cut with 
a knife; the upper part may be planed if the square part is not 
squeezed in the vise. Plane the two pieces for the vanes as accurately 
as possible so as to be able to make a good joint. Lay out and cut 
this joint as directed on page 24. After it is well fitted, draw 
the curves where the edges are to be whittled away. There are six- 
teen of them. Open the compass 34” and place the needle point al- 
ways on the front right-hand edge as the wheel turns around. The 
curve begins 4%” from the joint and ends 1%” from the back edge 
(one also goes towards the lower edge). From, this point draw a 
straight line to the end of the vane. Draw such lines as explained 
on page 32. Take the joint apart and whittle the edges away to 
these curves. 
On the beam, make chamfers 134” long. At the rear end, on the 
top and bottom, draw a center-line and two lines on each side of the 
center-line 4” apart. Between the first two, nearest the center- 
line, make the V-shaped groove in which the rudder fits. The sides 
of the beam are to be pared away to the other two lines, leaving this 
end ¥%” wide. 
The curves at the rear end of the rudder can be sawed best with 
a scroll saw. Lacking that, proceed as follows: First, bore a 14” 
hole near the short straight line in the middle. Resting the rudder 
on a cutting board, pare to this line with a chisel. Next, saw straight 
from the end of the rudder to this straight line; then saw the cor- 
ners, and pare to the curves. The width of the notch at the front 
end of the rudder is equal to the space left between the roots of the 
V-shaped notches in the beam. Measure this space, lay out the

notch, saw, and chisel it; then pare the corners so as to fit the V- 
shaped notches in the beam. Beware of crowding the rudder, for it 
will split easily. When fitted, glue and nail it in place, slanting a 
1” brad thru the curve into the beam. 
Put the wheel on the beam with two washers and a large screw 
(2” No. 12 round head is a good one). For this screw bore a 4” 
hole thru the center of the wheel, and a smaller hole in the beam. 
Now balance the windmill on the top of the post, and put the beam 
and post together with washers and screw in the same manner.

KITE-STRING REEL—Ptare 33. 
A boy who flies kites will appreciate this reel for hauling in his 
kite quickly and keeping the string in order. The axle is made long 
for the purpose of putting on a brake when letting out a kite. The 
brake is simply a strong cord, fastened to a screw in the lower part 
of the further upright, (as viewed in Plate 33) wound several times 
around the axle, and the other end held in the hand. A 1” hole is 
bored in the base so that the reel can be anchored to the ground with 
a stake. With a loop of string fastened to the upright below the 
crank, the crank can be kept from turning, if one does not wish to 
let out all of the kite-string. 
Make the base first, then the uprights. In the uprights, it is 
more convenient to bore the 9/16” holes before the sides are planed 
slanting. After the wheel pieces are joined in the manner explained 
on page 24, lay out the slanting lines on each arm while the 
joint is still together; then take it apart and plane to the slanting 
lines. Hold each piece securely slantwise in the vise, because one 
pair especially is apt to split from the notch outward. When this 
planing is finished, glue the joint and bore a 34” hole straight thru 
the center. If convenient, make the cross pieces in one long piece, 
20”, planing off one corner flat (see sectional drawing, Plate 33) 
within 4” of the two adjacent corners. Being careful to drive no 
brad into the 34” hole, glue and nail these four cross pieces to one 
wheel. Then glue them to the other wheel and wind some string 
around tightly enough to hold this wheel while adjusting and nail- 
ing it. It will require care to get the cross pieces square with the 
first wheel, and the second wheel parallel with the first. After the 
string is wound around to hold the second wheel, measure the dis- 
tance from wheel to wheel at the ends of all the arms. The nail- 
ing can be done while one arm of the wheels is held in the vise. The 
axle and handle should be glued and nailed to the crank. Now put 
the reel together, not forgetting the washers inside the uprights, and 
lock the wheels to the axle by drilling a hole for a 2” nail thru cross 
piece, wheel, and axle. (See illustration on page 55.)

STRING MACHINE—P tate 34. 
On a machine like this, one can twist bowstrings, topstrings, fish- 
lines, silk cord for fancy work, and any similar cord. Tho designed 
to be held on the floor or table with flat-irons, clamps, of course, will 
hold it better. 
Make the tail piece first. In the cross pieces of the tail piece are 
two screws 74” from the ends; be careful to bore the holes large 
enough so the screws will not split them. The edges of the lower 
cross piece must be sandpapered enough not to cut the elastic bands. 
In order that the belt shall run on the center of the wheels in 
the head piece, it is important to have the three axles parallel. To 
make them so, the two uprights must be clamped together while 
boring the 3g” holes for the axles. Lest the spur of the bit split 
the uprights, drill small holes at each center first. Do not nail 
the longer upright to the base until the belt runs well in both direc- 
tions. On a lathe, the wheels and axles could easily be made of one 
piece; lacking a lathe, a big spool or curtain pole must be used. Plug 
the hole of the spool with a dowel, then very accurately find its cen- 
ter and bore a 3%” hole thru it. Saw it into three 5@” pieces for 
the wheels. Glue these to the axles so that 1” extends thru the taller 
upright. A belt runs better on a wheel that is “crowned,” that is, 
slightly larger in the middle; so the edges of these wheels must be 
pared 1/32”, making a gentle curve. Put the washers each side of 
the wheels, then put the wheels in place in the taller upright, and 
nail this to the triangular block. Pull a 5%” leather belt tightly 
around the three wheels and sew the ends so that they butt together. 
* Clamp the shorter upright in position and turn the upper axle to 
see if the belt runs well in both directions. It will run true when 
all three axles are parallel, so keep knocking the shorter upright 
from side to side or up and down until the belt does run true; then 
bore holes for three screws to hold it to the triangular block. Make 
the crank and lock it to the upper axle with a 14” screw. 
To twist a string, set the two parts of the machine somewhat 
farther apart than the finished length desired. put on as moanv

threads, from hooks on the tail piece to corresponding hooks on the 
head piece, as will make the finished string the desired size. Ob- 
serve how these separate threads were twisted, and start the machine 
in the opposite way. Twist until the three strands kink readily when 
the head piece is brought nearer the tail piece. The tighter these 
are twisted, the harder the string will be. (Soap rubbed on the in- 
side of the belt may make the belt carry more power). When these 
three strands are twisted enough, remove the two lower ones from 
their hooks on the head piece to the upper hook. Twist in the op- 
posite direction until the string kinks again, and it is made. If the 
three strands are waxed, a stronger string will be made.

WINDMILL FORCE-PUMP—PuiareE 35. 
If this pump is properly connected with an air chamber, as ex- 
plained later, it will send a small stream of water some ten feet. In 
a gale, the windmill is strong enough, in fact, to force the valves 
from the glass tubes. Like any model of considerable mechanism, 
this will require patience to get it in working order. The post is 
made short for stability. If it can be held in place firmly, a trestle- 
work tower like a real windmill might be built of stock 14”x14” for 
the corner posts and 1%4”x%” for the braces. 
The post is slanting on two sides to fit the journals at the top. 
It is fastened to the base with two 2” screws. Make the wheel cen- 
ter 214” square, and thru its center bore a 44” hole. If it does not 
revolve true, make another block and try again. Make the block 
octagonal by cutting off each corner 54”. On each of the eight faces 
saw notches 4%” wide and 5/16” deep into which the vanes will fit. 
(See page 64 on cutting notches.) Make and glue the vanes in place 
and lay the wheel flat to dry. 
Procure three pieces of water-gage glass 2” long, 7/16” to 14” 
inside diameter. Glass tubes can be broken apart by filing a slight 
notch, grasping the tube firmly each side of the notch, and pulling 
and bending the tube away from the notch. If the file starts a little 
break, this will be comparatively easy, if it does not, file some more. 
Into two tubes little valves must be cemented. These can be made 
of a firm piece of leather. Sole leather that is not too hard is best. 
With knife or chisel, pare two pieces on the cutting board to fit in 
the tubes. The cement will make them water tight later. Push the 
sharp point of a penknife into the smooth side of the leather disk 
and make a circular cut, as one would remove a speck from an apple, 
but do not cut the flap completely out, because it must be left hinged 
to the disk. Turn this flap up straight out of the way so as to be 
able to work a 14” hole thru the disk. This can be punched, drilled, 
or cut out with a 1%” chisel, and finished with a penknife. Of 
course, the edges of the flap should cover this hole completely. The 
valve in the lowest tube should be cemented about 14” from the lower

end with the flap up, that in the horizontal tube about 34” from the 
outer end with the flap out. To make sealing-wax sticky enough to 
cement these valves in the tubes, melt one teaspoon of wax with one- 
half teaspoon of turpentine in a large spoon, and allow it to cool. 
Break it in pieces small enough to go in the tubes. Put the valve 
in the tube a little to one side of its final position; put in some of 
the wax mixture; heat the tube in an alcohol flame, rolling the tube 
till the wax begins to melt; remove from the flame; and when the 
wax is all melted, push the valve to its final position with a pencil. 
While it is cooling, see that the wax does not flow into the valve. 
All three tubes must have a piece of rubber tubing on the outside 
to serve as packing in the wooden block. With an expansive bit, 
holes can be bored in the block so that the rubber tubing will fit 
tightly. Lacking that, bore a smaller hole and enlarge it with a 
round file. The center of the vertical hole is somewhat to the left 
(as viewed in Plate 35) of the center of the block to allow the hori- 
zontal tube more support. This will require the notch in the upright 
also to be to the left of the center. After the holes are bored, the 
pores of the wood must be filled with paraffin. In a little dish, melt 
some paraffin and put it into the holes with a rag tied to a stick. 
When the holes are well covered, drive the wax into the wood with 
an alcohol or candle flame held in the hole till the wood is fairly hot. 
The outside of the block might well be treated in like manner. It 
will be best to cement these tubes in their places. Melt a tablespoon 
of sealing wax with about as much turpentine. With this, not too 
hot, build up a good fillet over the rubber tubing 14”, perhaps, on 
the glass tubes. 
Make a good fitting piston for the upper tube; it must not slide 
hard (oil it) and yet it must be air tight. To make the piston file 
two grooves %4” apart around and near the end of the piston rod. 
Wind a hummock of yarn between these grooves till it almost fills 
the tube, then wrap a piece of soft cloth (knitted underwear) 
smoothly over the hummock, tying it in each groove with thread.

Lock the crank to the axle with a 14” screw. Adjust the axle 
and keep it in position with two leather washers locked to the axle 
just outside the journals. Clamp the block to the base, adjust it in 
line with the crank, and fasten it with two 114” screws up thru the 
base. The last connection to make is between the crank and con- 
necting-rod. To make this, raise the piston to its highest position, 
and turn the crank to its lowest; choose what seems the best point 
for the screw, marking the point on crank and connecting-rod; now 
lower the piston and raise the crank; if the two points do not come 
together, the screw should be placed half way between them. This 
screw should be tight in the crank. ‘The wheel can now be glued to 
the axle or locked with a brad slanting from the front of the wheel 
center. 
Before they will work, the valves must be made limber with 
water, and to start the pump, water may have to be put on each side 
of the valves. Water may be pumped to any height by fastening a 
pipe to the horizontal tube. To obtain a steady stream, like a fire- 
engine, connect the horizontal tube with an air-tight bottle. The 
pipe which goes into this bottle should reach just below the stopper. 
The outlet pipe should nearly reach the bottom of the bottle, and it 
should have a nozzle smaller than any other opening in the whole 
apparatus. The bottle should be partly full of water. Quarter-inch 
glass tubing can be melted and shaped in an alcohol flame, and, if 
some rubber tubing is used as a connection, the nozzle can be played 
anywhere.

PREFACE 
In these days of confusion as to the real ends of education and con- 
tention as to the meaning of terms employed in defining them, one fact 
at least is clear and beyond any question of dispute, namely, that the 
modern world is insisting upon a definite answer from educators as to 
the value of various studies now in the curriculum of schools and col- 
leges. It is asking from teachers in clear and unmistakable terms 
such questions as these, “Of what use is your subject?” ‘What is its 
bearing upon the affairs of practical life?’’? And however foolish the 
questions may seem and despite the difficulties of answering them in 
terms of the “practical’”’—a word that has as many meanings as there 
are ideals of life—every teacher must be ready to respond. 
The supporters of vocational studies looking directly to commercial 
ends have long had their answer ready, and in a form so striking and 
concrete that the modern world has no difficulty in understanding it. 
For various reasons, also, teachers of the sciences, history, English, 
mathematics, and modern languages have had comparatively little 
difficulty in convincing the world that their subjects are useful. But 
the task has been harder for the teacher of the classics, not because he 
had a less “useful” contribution to make to the cause of education, but 
because it lent itself less readily to definition in terms which the man in 
the street would regard as in any sense “practical.”” And so in many 
cases he has not answered it at all, preferring rather to take the attitude 
of the pagan worshipers at Ephesus who met the claims of the new 
religion by gathering around the statue of their goddess and shouting 
in the ears of the Christians, ‘‘Great is Diana of the Ephesians!” without 
stopping to answer the questions, “Just how is she great?” “What can 
she really do for those who follow her?” 
The writer has felt for a long time that failure to give a direct answer 
in a striking and concrete form to this question, “Is there any relation 
between the study of Latin and practical life?”’ or as the high-school 
boy puts it, “What’s the use of Latin anyway ?”’ has been at the basis 
of much of the discontent concerning Latin. The Exhibit as outlined 
in the following pages was begun as a pedagogical experiment to prove 
or disprove this theory. It took the present form because of the assump- 
tion that a few concrete illustrations arranged in a way to strike the 
eye and to hold the attention are better than any number of abstract 
statements ineffectively presented. 
ix
-P-A-G-E-10
Because of the wealth of material and the many sides from which 
the question may be viewed, it has been difficult in many cases to select 
matter for illustration. In general the writer has kept in mind the needs 
and interests of the average high-school boy and girl. However, many 
other points and devices for illustrating them will at once occur to the 
skilful teacher as being quite as much worth while as those chosen. It 
will be noted that the testimony of classical teachers has been almost 
entirely disregarded in favor of that from other sources. 
While the Exhibit as a whole is concerned with Latin, it has been 
impossible in many cases to separate it from Greek. Hence the latter 
term appears in several of the headings and in some of the illustrative 
matter. 
As regards the spirit of the Exhibit, the writer has aimed to keep it 
entirely free from any invidious reflection on other subjects of the 
curriculum. Nothing is further from the purpose of the Exhibit than 
to extol Latin at the expense of other studies, nor is it to be understood 
that all the advantages claimed for the study of Latin are the exclusive 
possession of that study. 
The author cannot adequately express her gratitude for the kindly 
appreciation and material assistance of the Classical Association of the 
Middle West and South in promoting the publication. Sheis especially in- 
debted to Mr. Frank J. Miller, one of the editors of the‘‘Classical Journal,” 
and to the following committee appointed by the Association at its 
meeting in Cincinnati in April, 1912, to consider plans for putting the 
Exhibit in printed form: Benjamin L. D’Ooge, Ypsilanti, Michigan, 
chairman; Walter Hullihen, Sewanee, Tennessee; Frank J. Miller, 
Chicago; Moses S. Slaughter, Madison, Wisconsin; and H. L. Senger, 
Cincinnati, Ohio. 
The author also wishes to express her thanks to Mr. Arthur Chenoweth 
of the Oak Park High School for very material assistance in first prepar- 
ing the Exhibit and for hearty sympathy in the work of publication.

THE PURPOSE OF THE MANUAL AND DIRECTIONS 
REGARDING ITS USE 
The purpose of this Manual is to afford material for making an 
Exhibit which shall answer in concrete form the high-school boy’s 
question, ““What’s the use of Latin?” It aims, not to afford new 
information in connection with the subject of the Latin language and its 
usefulness, but rather to present information already known through 
abstract statements, in so striking and concrete a form that it will 
arouse the interest of the pupil and hold his attention. To this end, the 
chief ways in which an intelligent man may actually “use” his Latin 
have been worked out in graphic form for transference to cards of bristol 
board (22 in.X28 in:) which when completed in accordance with the 
directions given in the Manual,‘ are to be arranged in order and dis- 
played on the walls of some room in the school building suitable for 
the purposes of such an Exhibit. In most cases the Manual will furnish 
more material than the teacher is able to transfer to the cards. Thus, 
while each page technically represents a card, it will often be found 
necessary to select parts of the material, omitting the rest entirely or 
mounting it in typewritten form. In choosing material for illustration, 
the teacher should be governed very largely by the personal interests of 
the pupils and the needs of the community. In some cases, indeed, it 
may be better to disregard many of the illustrative devices of the book 
and to work out the idea with original material especially adapted to the 
situation. But in either case the teacher should work it out with the 
pupils. In fact, the pedagogical value of the idea is very largely depend- 
ent upon the success the teacher has in winning the co-operation of the 
pupil in the labor of collecting and arranging the material and thereby 
arousing a real interest and enthusiasm for the idea back of it. The 
finished Exhibit should not be the product of the teacher’s zeal alone but 
should embody in varying degrees the personal effort of every pupil. 
His convictions on the value of Latin are, after all, the chief point; and 
the more they spring from his personal experience in actually verifying 
for himself by his own discoveries the statements made in the headings 
to the cards, the deeper and more lasting they will be. In other words, the 
pupil should not feel that the conclusions have been thrust upon him, 
but that he has arrived at them himself in following out the suggestions 
of the cards. 
THE CARDS 
The edition of sixty cards with printed headlines formerly sent out 
with the Manual is now exhausted. Blank cards, however, may easily 
be secured from any large paper house, such as Dwight Brothers Paper 
Co., 626 South Clark St., or Bradner, Smith & Co., 175 West 
Monroe St., Chicago, Illinois. The latter furnish gray and white cards 
to purchasers of the Manual at the following rates:

  any card of bristol board, not too heavy, will serve the purpose equally 
well. The teacher will need from sixty to one hundred in order to 
prepare the Exhibit satisfactorily. 
RUBBER STAMPS 
The material is best transferred by rubber stamps. These can be 
secured from any large stationery store. Special rates are given to 
purchasers of the Manual by the Netherwood Printing Company, 
Madison, Wisconsin. A catalogue showing sizes of letters, prices, etc., 
is enclosed with the Manual. For general purposes Nos. 120 and 11 
are very useful. It is desirable to have the headlines large enough to 
be seen easily from any part of the room, and the choice of type should 
be governed by this consideration. The signs should be in larger type. 
SIGNS 
The divisions of the subject should be clearly distinguished by signs 
in large and striking type. The following are most important: 
1. The title of the Exhibit. f 
2. The nine divisions of the subject as given in the Outline. 
3. Such subdivisions under IT as seem necessary to a clear presenta- 
tion of the subject. 
4. The headings of the various professions under VII. 
The Dennison Paper Co., 16 East Randolph St., Chicago, 
Illinois, furnish gummed-paper letters in various sizes, which make very 
effective signs. This part of the lettering may also be done by hand to 
great advantage in the case of boys studying mechanical drawing. 
METHOD OF HANGING THE CARDS 
The cards may be pinned or attached by hooks to mosquito netting 
hung from the molding of the room or to rings on brass rods suspended 
by wires. Small hooks suitable for this purpose may be obtained 
from the Dennison Paper Co. 
A DEVICE IN PLACE OF THE CARDS 
In case the teacher does not wish to undertake the task of filling 
out the cards, very good results may be obtained by asking pupils 
to keep large scrapbooks in which certain headings of the Manual are 
copied and the illustrations prepared as in the case of the large Exhibit, 
handwriting or typewriting taking the place of the printing used on the 
cards. This device has the advantage of being easier to manage and 
more personal in its results, although it is far less striking in its appeal 
to the school as a whole.

THIS ENGLISH DICTIONARY SHOWS BY ITS COLORING 
THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF WORDS OF CLASSICAL 
ORIGIN IS VERY LARGE 
“The fact that what is called a complete English dictionary 
contains three Latin or Greek derivations to one word from a 
Saxon or any other Gothic source, shows us that to the edu- 
cated man the livest part of his language, so far as science and 
the higher order of things are concerned, is the Latin and Greek 
contingent.” —Dr. W.T. Harris, late Commissioner of Education, 
article on What Kind of Language Study Aids in the Mastery 
of Natural Science? ‘‘The School Bulletin,”’ December, 1907. 
“Two-thirds of the words which we have at our command (that 
is, the words found in a dictionary) are Latin; while, in our ordinary 
daily speech, half the words we use outside of what we may call the 
“small change” of language, such as and, we, to, on, of, are Latin. 
The little boy who says in the street, ‘please give me a cent, Mister,’ 
is speaking just one-half Anglo-Saxon English and one-half Latin 
English (‘give,’ ‘me,’ and ‘a’ have come down from Anglo-Saxon, 
and ‘please,’ ‘cent,’ and ‘Mister’ from Latin).”—William Gardner 
Hale, Professor of Latin, University of Chicago, Introduction to “A 
First Latin Book.” 
“There is no doubt that if we were to include all compounds and 
all scientific terms . . . . the Graeco-Latin element of words in our 
dictionary enormously outnumbers the Teutonic.’””—Sir James Mur- 
tay, Editor of the “New Oxford Dictionary.” Letter to author, 
February 3, 1913.

Ignorance of the above sometimes places one in a very un- 
pleasant position, as is shown in the following story related by 
Miss Mendenhall of the New York Public library: “The other 
day a student came into the library for help on a list of references 
in history which he was to read before writing a thesis. He 
said, ‘I have found most of the books in the Columbia library, 
but there is one author I can’t find anywhere, and I have spent 
a good deal of time looking. He has a strange name and I 
have never heard of him as a historian, but he has written a 
good many of the books on my list; his name is “Ibid.” ”—

“Tf, to your twilight land of dream,— 
Persephone, Persephone, 
Drifting with all your shadow host,— 
Dim sunlight comes with sudden gleam, 
And you lift veiléd eyes to see 
Slip past a little golden ghost, 
That wakes a sense of springing flowers, 
Of nestling birds, and lambs new-born, 
Of spring astir in quickening hours, 
And young blades of Demeter’s corn; 
For joy of that sweet glimpse of sun, 
O goddess of unnumbered dead, 
Give one soft touch,—if only one-— 
To that uplifted, pleading head! 
Whisper some kindly word, to bless 
A wistful soul who understands 
That life is but one long caress 
Of gentle words-and gentle hands.”

“See yon glad lover piping there 
To Amaryllis sweet ? 
He hears the hum of golden bees 
Soft murmuring in the blossoming trees; 
He hears the tinkling of the bells 
Where feed his flocks in grassy dells; 
From out his lithe throat, glad and strong, 
He breathes a lover’s joyous song, 
And pours it at her feet. 
Mark you this lover, thin and white, 
Beneath these somber skies ? 
He sees a narrow, paven street 
At whose high top tall factories meet; 
He hears the shrill, metallic roar 
That shakes the trembling wall and floor. 
She toils beside him. He lifts high 
His passionate heart, with voiceless cry, 
To her young, patient eyes. 
Arcadians both—young Corydon 
At dalliance in the grassy grove, 
And he, with drudgery wan and worn, 
Whose soul is big with pain and love.”

THE KNOWLEDGE OF MYTHOLOGY GAINED THROUGH 
LATIN SOURCES IS MORE INTIMATE AND MORE 
LASTING THAN THAT GAINED THROUGH ENGLISH 
ALONE; THEY SHOULD BE STUDIED TOGETHER 
The original sources often contain many personal touches, 
omitted in the ordinary textbook of mythology, which add 
very greatly to the interest of the story. For example, by com- 
paring the accounts of ‘‘Atalanta’s Race” as given in Ovid and 
Gayley’s ‘‘Classic Myths,” or the story of the Trojan Horse, 
as given in Virgil and Gayley, it will be seen not only that 
much has been omitted in the latter but that these very passages 
are the ones that contribute most to the vividness and charm 
of the story.

that given in Gayley’s ‘‘Myths,” with the parts of the story

than they are in the English, underlined in green.)

(Virgil’s description of the Trojan Horse, and side by side 
with this, with corresponding passages opposite, the account 
as given in Gayley, showing how much of the story is left out 
in the English rendition, and how much less vividly the details 
that are not omitted are related.) 
In answer to this question put to him by a student, “Do 
you feel that the study of Ovid and Virgil should form a back- 
ground for a high-school student’s study of such a book on 
Mythology as your ‘Classic Myths’?” Mr. Charles Mills 
Gayley, author of Gayley’s “Classic Myths,” writes as follows: 
“Tt is a thousand times better for a student to read the 
Virgil and the Ovid in the original with my ‘Classic Myths’ 
than to read the ‘Classic Myths’ without a first-hand knowl- 
edge of the original.” —Letter to student, February 12, 1913.

“Midsummer-Night’s Dream” to show that the enjoyment of the ‘‘Pyramus and

GENERAL STATEMENTS 
“The modern literatures have so grown up under the 
influence of the literature of Greece and Rome that the forms, 
fashions, notions, wordings, allusions of that literature have 
got deeply into them, and are an indispensable preparation for 
understanding them.””—Matthew Arnold, “The Great Prophecy 
of Israel’s Restoration,” p. ix (Macmillan and Co., 1872). 
“The thorough study of English Literature, as such—litera- 
ture, I mean, as an art, indeed the finest of the fine arts, is 
hopeless unless based on an equally thorough study of the litera- 
ture of Greece and Rome. When so based, adequate study will 
not be found exacting either of time, or labor. To know 
Shakespeare and Milton is the pleasant and crowning consum- 
mation of knowing Homer and Aeschylus, Catullus and Vergil. 
And upon no other terms can we obtain it.”—F. T. Palgrave, 
University of Oxford, Province and Study of Poetry, “Macmil- 
lan’s Magazine,” LIII (1886), 334. 
“Every great English writer of prose or poetry from the 
time of King Alfred to the time of Alfred Tennyson has—almost 
without exception—been schooled in the Latin language, has 
known well some of the Latin masterpieces, and, consciously 
or not, willingly or not, has written under the influence, some- 
times indistinct, sometimes overmastering, of the Latin models.”

  C. THE STUDY OF LATIN AND GREEK DE- 
VELOPS POWER IN THE USE OF ENGLISH 
TRANSLATION AFFORDS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DAILY 
PRACTICE IN THE USE OF PRECISE AND VIGOROUS 
\ ENGLISH ii 
Because a Latin word often has many meanings and shades 
of meaning in English, it is sometimes a very difficult matter in 
translating to choose the right one. For example, the very 
common word “magnus” does not always mean “great,” but, 
as the following diagram shows, has a very large number of 
meanings whose choice calls for a keen literary sense and a 
feeling for exactness in the use of words. The exercise of this 
critical faculty may be made a very practical training in the 
way of English expression. 
io; D gouspjue> 
ONO 
  Nore.—The above illustrations of the various meanings of “magnus” are taken 
from an article in the ‘Classical Journal,” February, 1910, by H.C. Nutting, entitled The 
Translation of Latin. In the same way work out the meanings of “res” and “ratio.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  
OPINIONS AS TO THE VALUE OF TRANSLATION FROM 
GREEK OR LATIN AS A TRAINING IN ENGLISH 
EXPRESSION: 
Macaulay thus testifies to the value of the exercise of trans- 
lation in the training of the great English orator, William Pitt: 
“But the classical studies of William Pitt . . . . had the effect of 
enriching his English vocabulary and of making him wonderfully 
expert in the art of constructing correct English sentences. His prac- 
tice was to look over a page or two of a Greek or Latin author, to make 
himself master of the meaning and then to read the passage straight 
forward into his own language. . . . . It is not strange that a young 
man of great abilities, who had been exercised daily in this way during 
ten years, should have acquired almost unrivalled power of putting 
his thoughts without premeditation into words well selected and well 
arranged.”—Biography of William Pitt, Whitehall Ed. of “Mis- 
cellaneous Works of Lord Macaulay,” VII, 121. 
‘Tt is still an open question whether any direct method of teaching 
English really takes the place of the drill in the niceties of style 
that can be derived from translation, especially the translation of 
Latin; whether a student, for example, who rendered Cicero with 
due regard for the delicate shades of meaning would not gain more 
mastery of English (to say nothing of Latin) than a’student who 
devoted the same amount of time to daily themes and original 
compositions.” —Irving Babbitt, “Literature and the American 
College,” p. 242. 
“Translation compels us to such a choosing and testing, to so 
nice a discrimination of sound, propriety, position and shade of mean- 
ing, that we now first learn the secret of the words we have been using 
or misusing all our lives, and are gradually made aware that to set 
forth even the plainest matter as it should be set forth, is not only a 
very difficult thing calling for thought and practice, but an affair 
of conscience as well.”—James Russell Lowell, Study of Modern 
Languages, “Latest Literary Essays,” p. 140 (Houghton Mifflin Co., 
1892).

                                SOME OF THE STRONGEST CHAMPIONS OF LATIN 
ARE TEACHERS OF ENGLISH 
   “To the serious student of English some acquaintance with 
Latin is not merely convenient, not merely valuable, but quite 
literally indispensable. At every onward step toward the 
mastery of his own language and literature, he must use his 
Latin lamp if he have one, or stumble and go astray in the dark- 
ness if he has not . . . . a man may as well try to reach Eng- 
land without a boat as to attain proficiency in English without 
Latin.”—Dr. S. P. Sherman, Professor of English, University 
of Illinois, “English and the Latin Question,” a pamphlet pub- 
lished by “Home and School Education.” 
   “As a teacher of English I have found students trained in 
Latin better than others for at least two obvious reasons: 
Until very lately, and I should say still, hardly anybody has 
written in the English language memorably who has not studied 
Latin at school; and nothing but a‘tolerable familiarity with 
Latin roots can prevent stupid misuse of words derived from 
Latin, such as ‘prominent identity.’ History and common 
sense, then, combine to make Latin the only sound foundation 
of literary English.”—Barrett Wendell, Professor of English, 
Harvard University. Letter to student, March 10, ror3. 
      “We like to have our girls trained in the classics. There is 
an observable fineness of fibre and intellectual discrimination in 
students so trained.”—Head of the English Department in a 
leading college for women. Quoted in Latin as a Practical 
Study, by Albert S. Perkins, “Classical Journal,” April, 1913. 
“T cannot say strongly enough how much I value a classical 
training in the study of English. ‘There is no question in my 
mind that ‘entrance Latin’ should be required for all students 
making English their major subject in College.”—Maud 
Bassett Gorham, Instructor in English, Swarthmore College.
-P-A-G-E-45
+ “Every English-speaking ‘student should give himself at 
least one year’s honest trial in the study of Latin. Latin is the 
best available training in general grammatical concepts. The 
grammatical dexterity slowly acquired through Latin study is 
of direct and immediate use in English. Latin also widens 
English vocabulary and makes for accuracy and truth of state- 
ment. Latin literature furnishes the key to the understanding 
of the great body of English literature. The ideas embodied in 
Latin literature are the ideas that engaged the attention of 
those who wrote English literature up to very recent times. 
Acquaintance with some of these ideas in the language in 
which they were originally expressed enables the student to get 
the right feeling for them.””—J. V. Denney, Professor of English, 
Ohio State University. Letter to author, February 10, 1913. 
“T am the fullest believer in the study of Latin for him who 
seeks the best sort of education. So far as my own observation 
has gone, whenever the acceptance or rejection of the language 
has lain in the choice of students, those taking it have invari- 
ably included far the larger proportion of the best students. It 
is one of the best instruments to train educated men. It will 
even train them to make money, which some people seem to 
regard as the main object for which education was devised.” 
—T. R. Lounsbury, Emeritus professor of English, Yale Uni- 
versity. Letter to student, January 29, 1913. 
“The Department of English of the University of Wis- 
consin welcomes the opportunity to affirm the importance of 
secondary-school studies in Latin, not only as affording valu- 
able training in the principles common to all languages and 
literatures, but especially as furnishing the specific backgrounds 
indispensable to a complete knowledge of the English language 
and literature in their historical development and in their 
essential nature.”—Karl Young, Chairman of the Depart- 
ment of English (April, 1916). :

“Popular Latin has never ceased to exist. It is the language

tries of today. Its history has been unbroken from the found- 
ing of Rome to the present time.’”—Professor Frank Frost 
Abbott, “The Common People of Ancient Rome,” p. 73. 
“Their original progenitors (Roumanian) were a colony cf 
Roman soldiers established on the banks of the Danube by the 
Emperor Trajan in A.D. 106. Their language descends from the 
rustic Latin of these soldiers, and in spite of long isolation, 
surrounded by Slavonic tongues, it retains its Latin characteris- 
tic to a remarkable extent, so much so that anyone reasonably 
familiar with Latin will be able to read a Roumanian newspaper 
with but little difficulty.”—Kenneth McKenzie, “National 
Geographic Magazine,” December, 1912. 
“Tn our Romance department here we should not think of 
accepting a student for graduate work who has not studied Latin. 
For intelligent advanced study of either the languages or the 
literatures, it is indispensable, and the wider and deeper the 
Latin preparation, the better the chance that the student will 
develop into a sound and effective Romance scholar.” —Edward

temps al’avance. Mais quand on s’embarque dans une grosse 
entreprise, il faut au moins considérer “la suite.” I] est mani- 
feste aujourd’hui que le gouvernement italien s'est engagé dans 
Vaffaire tripolitaine sans prévoir, ni l’étendue des difficultés qu’il 
rencontrerait pour s’établir dans sa conquéte, ni l’obstination 
de la Turquie 4 maintenir ses droits sur la derniére province 
quelle possédait en Afrique. 
Le contraste entre la bonne organisation militaire de 
Vexpédition, la brillante activité de la flotte italienne, l’emploi 
judicieux des forces mises en mouvement, et l’absence d’un plan 
d’action tenant compte d’éventualités qu’on devait tenir pour 
probables, reste inexpliqué. Ce contraste est d’autant plus 
frappant que l’Italie ayant choisi son heure et se sachant a 
Vabri des entreprises de son adversaire, avait, tout en préparant 
Pouverture des hostilités, le loisir de songer aux moyens par   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Cependant, aprés plusieurs mois d’hésitation cédant 4 la 
pression de l’opinion publique énervée par de si longs retards, 
le cabinet de Rome s'est décidé, d’abord a faire une sorte de 
démonstration contre les défenses de Kum Kaleh, 4 V’entrée des 
Dardanelles, le 18 avril dernier, puis 4 s’emparer successivement 
des iles de Parchipel des Sporades méridionales, situé entre les 
Cyclades (qui sont grecques), la Créte et l’Asie mineure, Rhodes, 
la principale, a été occupée sans résistance sérieuse, le 4 de ce 
mois. Dans les journées suivantes, le pavilion italien a été 
arboré sur les tles Tasos, Karpathos, Naxos et une demi douzaine 
d’autres. Le 1g avril, un cuirassé et un torpilleur avaient bom- 
bardé Samos, abattu le drapeau turc, et y avaient coulé un 
yacht, mais sans effectuer de débarquement. L’ile de Samos 
étant une principauté autonome, ne dépendant guére que 
nominalement de la Turquie, ces exercices de tir étaient au moins 
inutiles.—‘“ Revue des Francais,” May 25, 1912, pp. 12-13.

The following illustrations from the “Inferno” show that 
the greatest poem in the Italian language, Dante’s “Divine 
Comedy,”’ is saturated with the influence of Virgil: 
1. The idea of the journey to the lower world is taken 
from Virgil. Dante thus testifies to the fact that Virgil is his 
master: 
“O honor and light of the other poets! May the long study 
avail me and the great love which has made me search thy 
volume! Thou art my master and my author; thou alone art 
he from whom I took the fair style that has done me honor!” 
2. Virgil himself is Dante’s guide. 
3. Ninety-five of the characters whom Dante meets are 
classical. 
4. The topography is partly classical, e.g., the rivers Ache- 
ron, Styx, Phlegethon, and Cocytus, the city of Dis, etc. 
5. The category of sins resembles that of Virgil. 
6. Many details of the journey are like those given by Virgil, 
e.g., the meeting with Charon, Cerberus, Minos, the Furies, 
the Harpies, etc. 
7. The style is often strikingly similar to that of Virgil.

THE STUDY OF LATIN IS OF GREAT ASSISTANCE TO 
THE STUDENT OF GERMAN FOR THE FOLLOWING 
REASONS: 
I. Since Latin and German are both highly inflected languages, the student 
who has been trained to observe carefully the various case- and verb-endings in the 
Latin with a view to seeing the relations between the words of the long and involved 
Latin sentence and to hold his judgment in suspense until the significant word 
is met, is likely to master the German text with far less difficulty than the student 
without this training. 
II. A striking similarity exists in certain instances between Latin and German 
syntax, thus making it easier for the student of Latin to understand the German 
construction. The following examples will illustrate this point: 
1, THE Dative Case: 
1) Indirect object. 
Ger. Er gibt mir das Buch, He gives me the book. 
Lat. Mihi librum dat, He gives me the book. 
Reference. 
Ger. Das ist mir nicht erinnerlich, I do not remember that. 
Lat. Mihi ante oculos versaris, You hover before my eyes. 
With verbs meaning favor, help, injure, please, etc. 
Ger. Es gefillt mir nicht, Jt does not please me. 
Lat. Mihi non placet, I¢ does not please me. 
4) With adjectives meaning pleasing, near, friendly, like, etc. 
Ger. Es ist mir angenehm, It is agreeable to me. 
Lat. Mihi gratum est, I¢ is agreeable to me. 
THE GENITIVE CASE: 
1) With verbs of remembering. 
Ger. Ich erinnere mich meines Bruders, I remember my brother. 
Lat. Fratris mei memini, J remember my brother. 
With certain verbs of feeling (commonly impersonal in Latin and sometimes 
so in German). 
Ger. Mich dauert seiner, I pity him. 
Lat. Eius me miseret, I pity him. 
3) With expressions of plenty and want. Ger. Die Mutter bedarf des Geldes, The mother is in want of money. 
Lat. Mater pecuniae eget, The mother is in want of money. 
4) Quality. 
Ger. Waren erster Giite, Goods of the first quality. 
Lat. Vir magnae virtutis, A man of great virtue. 
5) Subjective and Objective. 
Ger. Der Gesang der Vogel, The song of the birds. 
Die Erziehung der Kinder, The education of the children. 
Lat. Timores liberorum, The fears of the children. 
Amor liberatis, Love of liberty. 
. THE AccusATIVE CasE: 
1) Two accusatives with certain verbs of asking. 
Ger. Ich fragte ihn das, I asked him that. 
Lat. Eum id rogavi, I asked him that. 
2) Duration of Time and Extent of Space. 
Ger. Er blieb ein ganzes Jahr, He remained an entire year. 
Lat. Duos annos mansit, He remained two years. 
4. THE SUBJUNCTIVE: 
Striking points of similarity exist between the Latin and German use of the 
subjunctive, especially in the case of conditional sentences, subordinate 
clauses in indirect discourse, indirect commands and questions, expressions 
of purpose (commonly), and wishes. 
ILI. Many likenesses exist in word formation. Compare, for example, the 
composition of the Latin and German verbs, proscribere and vorschreiben, excla- 
mare and ausrufer, convenire and mitkommen, subscribere and unterschreiben. 
Note, too, the similarity in the formation of such nouns as satisfactio and Genug- 
tuung, benefactor and Wohlidter, etc.

LATIN AFFORDS 
EXCELLENT 
MENTAL TRAINING 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
LATIN DEVELOPS THE CRITICAL SENSE AND A FEEL- 
ING FOR RELATIONS, A TRAINING WHICH IS OF 
THE GREATEST POSSIBLE VALUE 
“Ability to write decent Latin prose, with dictionary at 
elbow, simply cannot be acquired without at the same time 
inducing the kind of mental organization which at length 
enables a man to go anywhere and do anything, as-a great 
general... . phrased it. And I draw the proof from my 
own experience. The most effective masters of the ‘positive’ 
sciences known to me personally are invariably the men who 
have first acquired the mental organization which the culture 
studies confer; of this fact they are quite aware themselves. 
A creed was impressed upon them in these early years; not 
simply work, and still work, but work in a certain fashion. 
They gained connective processes; thereafter the rest is, not 
only easier, but immensely more efficient.”—R. M. Wenley, 
Head of Department of Philosophy, University of Michigan, 
“Nature of Culture Studies” (quoted on p. 71 of F. W. Kelsey’s 
“Latin and Greek in American Education”). 
“But this truth appears clearly—namely, that if we think 
of the study of language not merely as the search for a tool, but 
the striving for a bracing exercise of the mind and a discipline 
of the perceptive and reasoning powers, the classical courses 
offer a robuster training than can be got by the ordinary boy 
out of any modern grammar.”’—Article, Utility and Discipline, 
“The Nation,” January 23, 1913. 
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia Uni- 
versity, recently said in a letter regarding the value of the 
study of the classics that no discipline in attention or in logical 
analysis had been so effective in his training as that gained 
from the study of Latin and Greek.—Quoted in “The Classical 
Weekly,” December 13, 1913.

  LAW 
  OPINIONS OF PROMINENT LAWYERS AS TO THE 
VALUE OF A CLASSICAL TRAINING FOR THE WORK 
OF THEIR PROFESSION 
“A lawyer must needs study uninteresting old statutes, dry and 
ancient blue books, stupid, antiquated ordinances, early black-letter 
precedents, to find out what the law is and what his client’s rights are. 
Unless he can study alertly, patiently, and discriminately all these 
uninteresting, hard, and dry sources of the law and bases of rights, he 
will never reach the higher walk of his profession. Many men have 
natural aptitude for this. Many men have such superior ambition 
and industry that they will learn how to do this work when the neces- 
sity for it overtakes them. Of them we do not speak. ( But for the 
average youth who aims to become a lawyer there is great need that 
he be given special training in the interpretation of documents which 
are uninteresting, hard, and dry. He will have no end of it to do 
in his profession.) He should conquer this preliminary difficulty 
before he enters“upon his work. And while hard work for hard 
work’s sake is a solecism, hard work in something worth while, for 
the strength and skill to be gained thereby, is the essence of all dis- 
ciplinary education. {And this applies to the study of the classics 
by the would-be lawyer.’’>-Merritt Starr, of the Chicago Bar. 
“Latin and Greek in American Education,’ by F. W. Kelsey, 
pp. 127-28. 
“In my opinion, everyone entering upon the profession of law 
should be a’ proficient Latin scholar.”—John J. Healy, formerly 
state’s attorney for Cook County, Illinois. Letter to author, January 
10, 1913. F 
“. . . . Preparation for the law should be made by the study 
of such subjects as will train a man to acquire easily and rapidly, 
and to think logically and independently. And, in my judgment, 
the subjects, the study of which tends to the development of these 
qualities, are those which require of the student strenuous, pains- 
taking, and persistent effort for their mastery. If I could regulate 
the preparation of law students, I would eliminate from the course 
all predigested and specially prepared foods, and I would give the 
young man something that would demand earnest effort on his part 
to assimilate... . . q am frank to say that the young man who has 
a thorough old-fashioned classical and mathematical preparation for 
college is, in my judgment, much better fitted for the study of law 
than is the man who, during four years in college, has dissipated his 
   
-P-A-G-E-77
  
  energy and weakened his power to think clearly and logically by 
desultory and pointless work in ‘snap’ courses that require little or 
no effort on his par 
“For the prospective lawyer there can be no better discipline than 
that which comes from the discriminating effort involved in careful 
translation. The lawyer’s professional life must largely be devoted 
to the interpretation of legal instruments; and the greater his skill 
in the use of language and in discovering shades of meaning, 
the greater his effectiveness.” —H. B. Hutchins, president of the 
University of Michigan, “Latin and Greek in American Education,” 
by F. W. Kelsey, pp. 143-44. 
“T have taught law in four different Law Schools and, with some 
care and much interest, have looked into the pre-legal education of 
students in each of the Schools wherein I have taught. What I have 
learned in this way has produced a strong impression that students 
who come to the Law School with a good linguistic training, espe- 
cially those who have had good training in the Classics, other things 
being equal, have an advantage and do better work from the begin- 
=) The law demands a clearness and accuracy in thinking which 
is only to be attained in connection with accuracy in the use and the 
interpretation of language. While courses in economics, sociology, 
politics and related subjects undoubtedly have great value for the 
student of law, those who come solely or chiefly with this preparation 
do not show to advantage as a rule in comparison with those who 
have been trained to examine a written text critically and to express 
themselves clearly and accurately ina strange tongue. Consequently, 
when a Committee of the Association of American Law Schools was 
called upon some years ago to recommend a standard course for 
those preparing for law, while the desirability of courses in history, 
economics and social and political science was recognized, there was 
a general agreement on the part of members of the Committee in the 
wish that law students might all be trained, first in languages, espe- 
cially the Classical languages, and mathematics, with as much of the 
subjects more directly related to law as could be filled in.’”’—Roscoe 
Pound, Professor of Law, Harvard University. :

are various kinds of capiases, e.g.: 
capias ad respondendum—a, writ issued to take and bring 
the defendant before the court to answer. 
capias ad testificaondum—a writ to bring a disobedient wit-

capias ad satisfaciendum—a writ issued after judgment to 
take and hold the party named therein for the satis- 
faction of the judgment rendered. 
writ of subpoena—a writ requiring a person to appear at a 
certain specified time and place, or pay a penalty 
(sub poena), or suffer punishment for default. 
subpoena duces tecum—a writ commanding a person to 
appear in court and bring with him (ut duces tecum, 
“that you bring with you”) certain designated docu- 
ments or things. 
writ of fieri facias—or fi fa, as it is commonly called— 
a writ of execution commanding the sheriff to cause to 
be made of the goods and property of the defendant 
the amount of the judgment rendered against the 
defendant. 
retorno habendo—a writ issued in favor of a defendant com- 
manding the sheriff to cause the plaintiff to “make

MEDICINES AND REMEDIES IN GENERAL ARE APT 
TO HAVE NAMES COINED FROM LATIN OR GREEK 
The scientific or Latin designation of a drug is the same the 
world over, while the common name may vary, even in different 
sections of the same country. The medical student, well 
prepared in Greek and Latin, has an advantage over one who 
has not studied these languages.

on the shelves of the drug store 
    
These labels show you that the names of drugs are coined from Greek or

A sedative, from Latin sedo, to quiet. 
A narcotic, from Greek vapxwrixés, benumbed. 
Morphine, from Greek Mop¢eis, son of the god of sleep. 
“You cannot understand the language of medicine unless you 
know some Latin, so work hard at it: the time spent will never be 
regretted.”—William Osler, Regius Professor of Medicine, Oxford

“Tt not infrequently happens that an earnest medical student comes to 
me with the statement that he cannot find a certain word—galactotoxis- 
mus,’ for instance—in his dictionary. If such a student had had a funda- 
mental training in Greek, he would not have needed to consult a dictionary 
in order to ascertain the meaning of this word. Besides, I am of the opinion 
that the best dictionary, frequently consulted, cannot give to one wholly 
ignorant of Greek the correct, clear, and full appreciation of the meaning 
of such a word as ‘sitotoxismus’ as comes unsought to the one versed in 
Greek. ”’ Victor C. Vaughan, Dean of the Department of Medicine 
and Surgery, University of Michigan, “School Review,” June, 1906, p. 392. 
“T have been asked to express my opinion regarding a f 
Latin and Greek by the medical man. My answer is thatfit has been a 
constant wonder to me how anyone can undertake the study of medicine 
without previously acquiring these languages, and that anybody should 
advise a student that he can get along without the key to a Latin and 
Greek terminology is to me astounding. For with a fair working knowledge 
of Latin and Greek the student of medicine has his pathway made much 
easier; his machinery is lubricated at every point, while without stich help 
his life is a hard uphill climb.”"—James H. Jackson, M.D., Madison, Wis.

ENGINEERING 
OPINIONS OF MEN WHO ARE EMINENT IN THEIR 
PROFESSION AS TO THE VALUE OF A CLASSICAL 
TRAINING FOR THE WORK OF THE ENGINEER: 
“Education is not the learning of a trade or profession but is 
the development of the intellect and the broadening of the mind 
For ages the classics, comprising the study of the Latin and Greek 
languages and the literature of these languages, have been the founda- 
tion of all education, but in the last two generations they have been 
more and more pushed into the background by the development of 
empirical science, and its application, engineering. It is my opinion 
that this neglect of the classics is one of the most serious mistakes 
of modern education, and that the study of the classics is very impor- 
tant and valuable, and more so in the education of the engineer 
than in most other professions, for the reason that the vocation 
of an engineer is specially liable to make the man one-sided.” — 
Charles F. Steinmetz, General Electrical Company, Schenectady, N.Y., 
quoted from an article in “‘The American Institute of Electrical 
Engineers,” XXVIII (1909), 1103 f. 
“The study of engineering demands definiteness and concise- 
ness of thought As a means of inculcating ideas of exactness, 
the study of Greek and Latin is ‘facile princeps.’”—H. C. Sadler, 
Professor of Engineering, University of Michigan. 
“There is nothing in which engineers of today are so lacking as 
in the ability to express their thoughts; and there is nothing that 
will so surely give one such an ability as the translation from a foreign 
tongue; .. . . Nor can one properly understand English without 
an understanding of the Latin Grammar, I believe, though he should 
study it until he were gray. There are features of language which 
the study of English in itself does not bring out, and which cannot/__ 
be brought out until one goes back to its parent tongue; and it is 
in these distinctions of meaning that the engineer must ultimately 
become versed Take such simple words as ‘affect’ and 
‘effect.’ I venture to say that 95 per cent of the students of the 
senior class of this University who have not had a classical training 
will fail to distinguish the difference between those two verbs; and 
yet the difference is quite essential, and it is especially essential to the 
engineer.”—Gardner S. Williams, Professor of Engineering, Univer- 
sity of Michigan, quoted in F. W. Kelsey’s ‘Latin and Greek in 
American Education,” p. 116.

  THE MINISTRY 
THE MINISTER MUST BE FAMILIAR WITH BOTH THE 
LANGUAGE AND THE THOUGHT OF THE GREEKS 
AND ROMANS 
The New Testament was written in Greek and the writings 
of the early church were in Greek or Latin. Latin was the 
only ecclesiastical language during the middle ages, and it still 
remains the official tongue of the Catholic church. Moreover, 
the Christian religion arose in a world whose intellectual life 
was Greek and Roman. The minister who is familiar with the 
thought of those times has a great advantage over one who is 
not a classical scholar. 
OPINIONS OF EMINENT TEACHERS REGARDING THE NECESSITY 
OF A CLASSICAL TRAINING FOR MINISTERS : 
“The man who looks forward to the ministry ought to take 
the broadest and strongest college course which is possible. 
I believe that Latin and Greek ought to be studied by such men 
through the whole four years of their college course.’’—A. D. 
Mackenzie, President of Hartford Theological Seminary, in 
F. W. Kelsey’s “Latin and Greek in American Education,” 
p- 169. 
“Apart from the absurdity of a man’s dealing in any pro- 
found way with a book whose language he is ignorant of, it 
ought to be remembered that practically all learned commen- 
taries are unreadable to the man who does not know Hebrew and 
Greek. Whatever place is given to other methods of train- 
ing for special work, Latin and Greek will remain as a necessary 
part of the equipment of the theological scholar.’”—Hugh 
Black, Professor at Union Theological Seminary, New York,

THE IMPORTANCE OF A CLASSICAL TRAINING 
A LETTER FROM MR. PAUL ELMER MORE, EDITOR OF “THE 
NATION,” JANUARY 5, 1912: 
“Certainly I regard the ability to read Virgil and Homer as 
one of the most enduring luxuries a man can take from school 
into the world It has seemed to me in my editorial 
work that I have often observed the beneficial results of classical 
training in the orderliness of mind of contributors and the ill 
effects of its absence. I am more and more convinced every 
year that there is nothing that can take the place of the disci- 
pline of Latin and Greek.” 
“Tn a recent address at Madison, Wis., Dr. Talcott Williams 
of the School of Journalism of Columbia University, emphasized 
the importance of the study of the ancient classics and uttered a 
warning against the neglect of these bulwarks of the old educa- 
tion.” —“ Wisconsin State Journal,” May 13, 1912. 
M. Francis Maynard,.editor of the Figaro, one of the leading 
papers of France, prepared himself for his brilliant editorials 
from day to day by reading the classics. ‘‘The most successful 
and competent French journalist of his time really thought 
that a constant perusal of the great classics was the best prepa- 
ration for his work in journalism. From them he drew his 
inspiration; they taught him to write; they were his com- 
panions day and night.”—-Mr. George W. Smalley, “Studies 
of Men,” p. 361 (Harper and Bros., 1895). 
“A striking proof of what can be done by the scholar in journalism was 
given by the career—unhappily cut short by fever during the Siege of 
Ladysmith—of Mr. G. W. Steevens, who went on the daily press after win- 
ning several high distinctions in classics at Oxford. In his accounts of the 
Diamond Jubilee procession, of the Dreyfus court-martial, . . . . he beat 
the descriptive reporter on his own ground, while he could deal adequately 
with literary and philosophical subjects which the mere reporter could not 
even approach. His skillin the craft of the special correspondent so im- 
pressed itself upon his contemporaries, that a London literary weekly, 
commenting on the lack of any notable descriptions of the coronation of the 
present King, remarked that ‘the absence from among us of the late G. W. 
Steevens was severely felt.’ ”’—Herbert W. Horwill, The Training of the

LETTERS FROM EDITORS OF LEADING AMERICAN 
NEWSPAPERS: 
“Your inquiry of March 5 can be answered, I think, in only one 
way by any person who has taken a college course. A knowledge of 
Greek and Latin, but especially of Latin, is emphatically of ‘prac- 
tical’ value to anyone who hopes to make a living by writing the 
English language. The ‘Record-Herald’ appreciates what you say 
about classical illustrations in its editorial columns. The real value 
of knowing Greek and Latin, however, is not in enabling one to 
make learned references but in the power it gives to use simple words 
with aptness and a nice appreciation of their shades of meaning. 
Any college man who has become a writer will tell you that in this 
respect he finds even his half forgotten scraps of Latin useful every 
day of his life. Training in Latin also is of permanent value as a 
help in understanding the grammar of our own language. Most 
of our everyday words come from the Anglo-Saxon; these are of 
the first importance, but we learn them in childhood. Most of our 
scholarly or technical words come from the Latin, and these can be 
learned best by becoming acquainted with the original roots. Both 
kinds are necessary. A person can make a living, of course, and even 
be quite happy, without knowing a word of Latin or Greek; but 
nothing can so surely give a full appreciation and mastery of our own 
beautiful language as a knowledge of the tongues from which it is 
derived.” —Edwin L. Shuman, Literary Editor, ‘Chicago Record- 
Herald,” March 17, 1913. Letter to a student. 
“T am very strongly myself for the humanities in education, and 
feel that my classical training was a very great advantage. But I 
know that good writers come up under other systems.”’—Rollo Ogden,

CITY BANK OF CHICAGO, ILL., JANUARY 3, 1913: 
“Tn reply to yours of the 6th instant I would say that I know of 
nothing more useful to a business man than to be master of his own 
mother tongue, and as Latin is the proper foundation for accurate 
knowledge of English, I am thoroughly in favor of the teaching of 
Latin to our high-school boys.” 
Mr. Forgan thus expresses his idea of the kind of training 
that is really “practical” for success in the business world: 
“Tf a boy is to achieve great success he will need a well-trained 
mind. A mind trained to concentrated study, to careful analysis of 
the subject in hand, and to be content with nothing short of the com- 
plete mastery of it, is the best equipment for business life a young man 
can possess.” —“ Chicago Tribune,” 1912. 
A LETTER FROM H. B. THAYER, PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN 
ELECTRIC COMPANY, NEW YORK, MARCH 18, 1913: 
“Tn reply to yours of the 13th instant, it has always been my 
opinion that the chief value of education is not in what is left in the 
memory, but is in the training of the mind and that either in business 
or in the professions, a general training of the mind should precede 
specialization. The comparison between education and the plough- 
ing of a field is an old one but a good one. Education prepares the 
mind for the work of after life as the ploughing prepares the field. 
Different kinds of studies as mathematics, languages, and philosophy 
furnish different kinds of training. In my opinion they are equally 
valuable. Of what is left in the mind or memory the simple processes 
of mathematics are, of course, essential in all walks of life. In busi- 
ness or in the professions, on account of the large number of words 
in ordinary use derived from the Latin, such a knowledge of Latin 
as is retained is very valuable. In my opinion the study of Latin to 
the extent that it is carried on in a high school is of more practical 
benefit than many of the studies of the common schools.” 
  Note.—See an investigation by Professor Harris Hancock of the University of Cin- 
cinnati in 1915 showing that a surprisingly large number of prominent business men of 
that locality were in favor of mathematics and the classics as required subjects in the 
high-school course. Note also the success of such experiments as that at Dorchester, 
Mass., where Latin forms a part of the commercial course in the high school.

       THE INTELLIGENT BUSINESS MAN WILL ANTICIPATE 
THE TIME WHEN HE NO LONGER NEEDS TO MAKE 
MONEY. A LIBERAL EDUCATION IN HIS YOUTH 
WILL PREPARE HIM TO SPEND HIS LEISURE 
WITH PLEASURE AND PROFIT 
A quotation from an article by Mr. Emory J. Haynes in the 
“New York Evening Mail”: 
“. ... The deprecation of college education in which some 
men indulge is not to be taken at face value. Those splendid ages 
called classic are a passage in the world’s history. Not to know 
Greece and Rome is not to know what man is on this globe. Not to 
know Homer and Shakespeare may not count in a shop, but it does 
count as an immense gap in honest self-consciousness when a man 
measures himself from the mind side of existence. 
“Why do many rich and burdened men in advanced years con- 
tinue in the galling harness? Not a little because ‘business’ consti- 
tutes all they know of human life. The costly libraries in their 
palatial homes do not attract them, for they do not know books. 
They have never met the great, world-long line of authors. They 
cannot find, within themselves, the sources of happy leisure. 
“But it is precisely these sources of happiness that compensate 
countless college-educated men for a daily life of a small salary and a 
poor wage. Once away from the office of a humble clerkship, these 
men are rich in the exquisite companionship of their books. They 
prize the store of polite learning that they possess. They are more 
than content. 
“A great corporation pays them a small clerical salary for certain 
daylight hours. But ouce free, at evening, they are princes. They 
know the poets and philosophers of all ages. They are never at a 
loss when left alone. Money to them is a servant, not a master—a 
means, not an end. 
“Who will dispute that this is an ideal life? The college-trained 
man, just graduated, realizes two things. He knows how little 
he really knows. But he knows exactly where any kind of human 
knowledge is to be had. Again, is not that the ideal position of a 
human mind? .... And this very day the college would do vastly 
more in such training, if trained teachers had full control. It is 
allowing immature boys to elect their own studies that makes the 
college training of today less valuable than of old.” — The Classical 
Weekly.”

   THE TESTIMONY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN OF AFFAIRS 
AS TO THE PRACTICAL HELP HE HAS DERIVED 
FROM HIS CLASSICAL EDUCATION 
A “CrassicaAL FounDATION” as A “PRacticaL EqQuip- 
MENT FoR Lire’s JouRNEY” may to the “practical” man sound 
too absurd even to laugh at. And yet so strenuously active 
and wide-awake and unvisionary a person as Mr. James O. 
Fagan, railroad man, telegraph operator, traveler in two hemi- 
spheres, and “self-made” (as the saying goes) from boyhood, 
deliberately acknowledges his supreme indebtedness to classical 
study as the groundwork of his training for the work he was to 
find to do in the world. In the August instalment of his Auto- 
biography of an Individualist in the ‘Atlantic Monthly,” 
dwelling on that part of his storm-and-stress period that was 
passed at East Deerfield, Massachusetts, he says: “In present- 
ing an argument, stating a case, or pleading a cause, other things 
being equal, I always attributed my intellectual advantage to 
the fact that in my youth I had received a thorough drilling in 
Latin and Greek, while my companions as a rule, in my line of 
life, had not. (As asimple, practical equipment for life’s journey, 
what may be called my classical foundation seems to me now to 
be worth all the other features of my school education put to- 
gether.”)-“The Dial,” September, 1912.

KNOWLEDGE OF CLASSICAL BUILDING IS ESSEN-

UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE THAT SUCH COLLEGE 
COURSES IN ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY AS A 
CLASSICAL STUDENT MUST PURSUE BROADEN 
AND DEEPEN THE KNOWLEDGE HE GAINS 
THROUGH ENGLISH SOURCES 
“There can be no question that a thorough knowl&dge of the 
architecture of the Greeks and the Romans is vital to every modern 
architect. We can hardly imagine any education in art or architec- 
ture worthy of the name that does not commence with a study of 
these ancient forms which are still unexcelled for dignity, purity, 
proportion, and refinement.”—George B. Post and Sons, Architects, 
New York City. Letter to student, February 3, 1913. 
“Tn answer to your letter of May 13, we write to state that in 
our opinion the value of classical studies cannot be overestimated. 
The Committee on Education of the American Institute of Archi- 
tects is on record as recommending that the study of Latin be required 
as a preparation for the profession of architecture. The best archi- 
tectural schools in the country accept only holders of the degree of 
A.B. as candidates for entrance.’—McKim, Mead and White,

THE WOMAN AT HOME 
IS A TRAINING IN GREEK AND LATIN “PRACTICAL” 
FOR THE GIRL WHO IS PREPARING FOR A LIFE 
IN THE HOME? 
Yes. It is even more important for her than for a boy, because 
competition in the business world is so keen in America that the 
average business man of today has almost no time for reading outside 
the daily paper and a few magazines. It is the wife and mother, 
then, in the average well-to-do family, who has the leisure for looking 
after the literary training of her children and the cultivation of their 
tastes for the finer things of life. For such duties she will need the 
most liberal education. And just as it would be a mistake for her to 
omit from her preparation such practical matters as learning how to 
cook, sew, and the details of housekeeping generally, it would be a 
much greater mistake to neglect the preparation for meeting the 
higher needs of herself and her children. 
Moreover, in these later years, so many of the functions of the 
housewife have been taken outside the home through the invention of 
machinery and the organization of modern industry that the woman 
at home often finds that she has time, not only for her family, but for 
serving the community outside as well. She is rapidly finding out, 
too, that to be a good housekeeper and a good homemaker necessi- 
tates a broader vision and a deeper insight into the conditions of the 
modern industrial and political world than was needed by the wife 
and mother of even fifty years ago. And if she sees clearly, she will 
perceive that the torch of learning and the more spiritual ends of 
civilization are being left to her more and more in the rush of the 
business man and the politician for the material rewards of life. 
Under these circumstances, her classical training with its broad per- 
spective of human life, its gift in the way of developing an ability to 
estimate values and to see clearly the real issues of life, will serve her 
well. i 
_ ee 
“Tf the study of Latin gave only training in the power of concen- 
tration, I should think it of great practical value fora woman. The 
distractions of modern life, the numberless demands upon the time 
and thought of the earnest woman, whether her life is lived within 
the home or outside of it, make this mental habit invaluable. © 
“T might add that Latin is a ‘practical subject’ because of the help 
which it gives as preparation for other studies, such as French, Italian, 
English and History. It seems to me one of the ‘basic’ subjects, a 
good foundation for the education of any woman in whatever sphere 
her life may be lived.”—Mary E. Woolley, President of Mount 
Holyoke College. Letter to student, April 11, 1913.

THE BEGINNINGS OF OUR MODERN CIVILIZATION 
GO BACK TO CLASSICAL TIMES 
“All the great intellectual impulses begin in Greece; the 
modern world only grows crops from the Greek seed. All the 
great political ideas come from Greece or Rome; the very 
notions of law and empire are theirs, and without them a mod- 
ern empire is only an organized horde, like Gengis Khan’s, or 
an organized shop, a gigantic trust, greed, blood, and iron. All 
poetry and philosophy has its roots there. Your very books 
and newspapers are full of allusions to Greece and Rome: cut 
them out and it would be like a world without the electric 
force.”—Dr. W. H. D. Rouse, Cambridge University, England, 
in “Classical Weekly” for January 11, 1913, IV, 82. 
“The History of Greece and Rome is the foundation of our 
modern culture in almost every direction. To understand our 
own life, our own ideas of state and law, of world and human 
tasks, of knowledge and art and philosophy, we must turn to 
those nations which influenced most strongly the whole further 
development of mankind.”—Hugo Miinsterberg, Professor 
of Psychology at Harvard University, “Psychology and the 
Teacher,” p. 294. 
“Notice first, then, that culture studies link man principally 
with the past; their roots strike deep into history. Rome 
attached the glorious heritage of centuries; Carthage, Syra- 
cuse, Athens, Thebes, Sparta, Alexandria, Jerusalem, were 
swallowed successively. Then she proceeded to annex the 
hopes of the future—Gaul, Spain, Germany, Britain. On these 
she stamped her language, her laws, her institutions, for a mil- 
lennium; thus we, their latest heirs, live bosomed in her still. 
Try as we may, we cannot rid ourselves of the long, triumphant 
list of emperors, popes, kings, jurists, philosophers, theologians, 
ecclesiastics, and saints who led mankind always within the 
framework of her civilization. Nay, in proportion as we 
attempt to shake her off, to free us from all knowledge of the 
tongue that preserves her unmatched achievement, we dedicate 
ourselves once more to a new barbarism, different in degree, 
mayhap, from that of our blue-clayed ancestors, but nowise 
different in kind.”—R. M. Wenley, ‘‘The Nature of Culture 
Studies,” quoted on p. 63 of F. W. Kelsey’s “Latin and Greek 
in American Education.”

THE INFLUENCE OF ROMAN LAW IS STILL FELT IN 
THE MODERN WORLD 
ROMAN LAW IN EUROPE 
“The influence of the Roman law has been continued in modern 
times in Europe through the Code Napoleon which was based in 
part on the law of southern and eastern France which was Roman by 
direct descent. Through this Code the Roman influence has been 
perpetuated in central and southern Europe generally, especially in 
Holland, Belgium, a part of Switzerland, in Italy, Spain and France.” 
—Clifford Moore, Professor of Latin at Harvard University. Letter 
to student, January 10, 1913. 
ROMAN LAW IN AMERICA 
“Although the Romans held Britain from the first century to the 
beginning of the fifth, the Roman civilization was practically swept 
off the face of the earth by the coming of the Anglo-Saxon in 449 and 
afterward. There is therefore practically no Roman law in the 
present English law that has had a continuous existence on English 
soil from the time of the Roman occupation. . . . . From the time 
of the Conquest, however, there have been frequent infusions of 
Roman law into English law through the influence of the lawmakers, 
the decisions of the courts and the writings of scholars, and this 
process is still going on both in England and America. In the early 
part of the last century, when hatred of England was so strong in 
this country, the American frequently borrowed from the French 
(modern Roman) law to aid them in their decisions. An interesting 
case of such borrowing from Roman or Romanic sources is found in 
Nebraska vs. Iowa, 143, U.S. 359, decided in February 1892. (See any 
large city library or law office.) . . . . The most important point 
of contact of the two systems for Americans is in our own Louisiana 
and in our island dependencies, Porto Rico and the Philippines. 
The laws of Mexico, of Central America and of all of the South Ameri- 
can states are direct derivatives of the classical Roman law. Any 
trouble that we may have with these countries which would bring us 
into their courts would necessarily have to be settled in accordance 
with the rules of their modernized Roman law.”—Joseph H. Drake, 
Professor of Roman Law, University of Michigan. Letter to student, 
January 5, 1913. 
“The great service rendered by the Romans was the way in which 
they worked out a very complex and refined system of law which 
has been in many countries the base of legal development and legal 
practice ever since.”"—Hon. James Bryce, formerly British ambassa- 
dor to America. Letter to student, January 10, 1913.

CERTAIN FEATURES OF ROMAN RELIGION STILL 
‘SURVIVE IN A MORE OR LESS CHANGED FORM 
1. The plan of the Christian cathedral with the nave and 
side aisles is derived from the Roman basilica (the exchange and 
law courts in ancient Rome). 
2. Certain Christian festivals show traces of Roman influ- 
ence. For example, the ritual procession around the fields, 
called “beating the bounds,” which survives in some parishes. 
in England, is really a survival of the Roman festival of the 
Ambarvalia. The Carnival, also, a festival preceding Lent 
which is celebrated with much merry-making in some countries 
in Europe, has many points of contact with the Roman Satur- 
nalia. 
3. In some cases the early Christians, while changing the 
name and nature of a Roman festival that was popular with 
the masses, retained its date for a festival of their own. This 
is illustrated by the fact that they selected the feast day of 
Aurelian’s Sun god as the day for the celebration of the birth of 
Christ, who, as they pointed out, was the true sun of righteous- 
ness. 
4. Ceremonial processions, bearing many points of resem- 
blance to those that may still be seen in some cities in Europe, 
were a feature of some of the Roman religious cults as was the 
use of holy water and incense. 
5. The vestments worn in some churches of today are sug- 
gestive of Roman times; so, also, is the custom of making votive 
offerings and the wearing of amulets.

Guglielmo Ferrero, an Italian professor of Roman history, 
considers that ancient Rome and America of today have many 
points in common. In the “Atlantic” for July, 1910, he writes 
as follows: ‘Now I think that a journey to the New World is, 
above all, intellectually useful to a historian of the Ancient World, 
and that in order to understand the life and history of Greek or 
Roman society, it is quite as useful, if not more so, to visit the 
countries of America as to visit Asia Minor or North Africa.”

effective in bringing out the similarity. For an illustration of this method see the 
treatment of the topic “suffrage” on the following page. The present European 
war offers many opportunities in the way of comparison, which may be made to serve 
the interests of the classical teacher.

WHEN YOU READ THESE SPEECHES CONCERNING 
SUFFRAGE FOR WOMEN, DELIVERED IN ROME IN 
THE SECOND AND FIRST CENTURIES B.C., YOU 
WILL ALMOST THINK YOU ARE READING THE 
MODERN NEWSPAPER 
A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SENATE BY CATO on the occasion 
of a vigorous protest on the part of Roman women to a law limiting 
expense in dress, when, as Livy, the Roman historian, says, the 
matrons could be kept at home neither by persuasion, nor by a sense 
of modesty, nor by the authority of their husbands. They blocked up 
all the streets of the city and the approaches to the Forum, impor- 
tuning men as they came down to the Forum to vote for the 
restoration of their rights. 
“Are your ways more winning in public than in private and with 
other women’s husbands than your own? And yet not even at home 
ought you to concern yourselves with the laws which are passed or 
repealed here. Our fathers have not wished women to manage even 
their private affairs without the direction of a guardian; they have 
wanted them to be under the control of their parents and their 
brothers and their husbands. We, by our present action, if the gods 
permit it, are letting them go into politics even; we are letting them 
appear in the Forum, and take a hand at public meetings and in the 
voting booths. Pray, what will they not assail, if they carry 
this point ? Call to mind all the principles governing them by which 
your ancestors have held the presumption of women in check, and 
made them subject to their husbands. Though they have been re- 
strained by all these, still you can scarcely keep them in bounds. 
Tell me, if you let them seize privileges and wrest them from you one 
by one, and finally become your equals, do you think you can stand 
them? As soon as they have begun to be your equals they will 
be your superiors.” —Frank Frost Abbott, ‘Society and Politics in 
Ancient Rome,” pp. 46-47. 
Norte.—‘‘Two of the tribunes had announced their intention to veto the 
repeal bill and in their final tactics the Roman women seem to have antici- 
pated political methods which are not unknown today. They beset the 
doors of these officials in a solid phalanx, and did not give over their demon- 
stration until the tribunes promised not to oppose them.”

as would be required. 
“Let war with the Gauls or Parthians come and we shall 
not be inferior to our mothers in zeal for the common safety; 
but for civil wars may we never contribute, nor even assist you 
against one another. . . . . Why should we pay taxes, when we 
have no part in the honors, the commands, the state-craft, for 
which you contend against one another with such harmful 
results?”—Frank Frost Abbott, “Society and Politics in

     IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE SIMILARITY 
BETWEEN CERTAIN FEATURES OF ROMAN AND 
AMERICAN METHODS OF ELECTIONEERING     
    
              
      
        I. The honest candidate made every legitimate effort to 
win the favor of voters just as the honest modern candidate 
does, while the unscrupulous one attained his end in much 
the same fashion as does the corrupt politician of today. 
II. Our political posters are not different in spirit from those 
found at Pompeii and are often similar in expression. 
Compare, for example, the following posters:

       Such statements as these, easily paralleled today, were 
often expressed about the candidate: 
dignum re publica, worthy of public office. 
iuvenem probum, an upright young man. 
hic aerarium conservabit, he will be the watchdog of the 
treasury. | 
et ille te faciet, (clect him) and he will do as much for you. 
III. Our campaign speeches are strikingly similar in spirit to 
those of Cicero and Catiline. A Roman politician, for 
example, would be quite at home in reading some of the 
speeches of the recent campaign in which personal invective 
was a conspicuous feature. In this connection see news-

THE MODERN WORLD MAY PROFIT MUCH BY THE 
EXPERIENCE OF THE ROMANS; IT CANNOT 
AFFORD TO DISREGARD THE LESSONS THEY 
LEARNED 
“A sober reflection on the history of the ancient republics 
might put us on our guard against many of the dangers to which 
we ourselves are exposed.”—Irving Babbitt, “Literature and 
the American College,” p. 171. 
“Moreover, I believe that the deeper one has delved into 
the past, and particularly the past as represented by Greece and 
Rome, the keener will be his interest in the coming lot of his 
fellow-men. The Greeks faced many of our problems and 
have much to tell our own generation as it stands before the door 
of tomorrow.”—Fred B. R. Hellems, ‘The Dial,’ March 1, 
1913, pp. 176-78. 
“They [the classics] contain a body of human experience and 
tried wisdom by which we may still guide our steps as we stumble 
upon the dark ways of this earth For, frankly, if a man 
is not convinced that the classics contain a treasure of practical 
and moral wisdom which is imperatively needed as a supple- 
ment to the one-sided theories of the present day, and as a 
corrective of much that is distorted in our views, he had better 
take up some other subject to teach than Greek or Latin.” — 
Paul Elmer More, The Paradox of Oxford, ‘‘School Review,” 
June, 1913. 
“‘We should have scant capital to trade on were we to throw away 
the wisdom we have inherited and seek our fortunes with the slender 
stock we ourselves have accumulated. This, it seems to me, is the 
teal, the prevalent argument for holding every man we can to the 
intimate study of the ancient Classics Your enlightenment 
depends on the company you keep. You do not know the world 
until you know the men who have possessed it and tried its wares 
before you were ever given your brief run upon it. And there is no 
sanity comparable with that which is schooled in the thoughts that 
will keep. ”’.Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States.

WIDE READING IN THE CLASSICS GIVES A PERSPEC- 
TIVE FOR A CORRECT JUDGMENT OF THE PRES- 
ENT. MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS IS THE 
MOST “PRACTICAL” FEATURE OF A CLASSICAL 
TRAINING 
“Without a knowledge of the thought of Greece and Rome, 
you cannot estimate the thought of your own or any other 
generation, because you do not know how to distinguish its 
peculiar quality from the common inheritance.’’—Paul Shorey, 
The Case for the Classics, ‘School Review,’’ November, 1910, 
p. 612. P : 
“The average American has come to have an instinctive 
belief that each decade is a gain over the last decade, and that 
each century is an improvement over its predecessor; the first 
step he has to learn in the path of culture is to realize that the 
advance in civilization cannot be measured by the increase 
in the number of eighteen story buildings. The emancipation 
from the servitude to the present may be reckoned as one of 
the chief benefits to be derived from classical study.”—Irving 
Babbitt, ‘Literature and the American College,” p. 165. 
“A man who does not understand Latin is like one who walks 
through a beautiful region in a fog; his horizon is very close 
tohim. He sees only the nearest things clearly, and a few steps 
away from him the outlines of everything become indistinct or 
wholly lost. But the horizon of the Latin scholar extends far 
and wide through the centuries of modern history, the Middle 
Ages and antiquity.”—Schopenhauer.

TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PAST 
CIVILIZATION DEPENDENT UPON THE STUDY OF 
LATIN? CAN IT NOT BE OBTAINED WITHOUT IT? 
The knowledge of this ancient civilization, while not depend- 
ent upon the study of Latin, is undoubtedly more lasting and 
more significant to the man of classical training who has read 
the original sources as well as the English. For any intimate 
acquaintance with the thought and the life of the people, any 
thorough appreciation of the influence of Greece and Rome, 
requires a considerable period of time for the leisurely absorp- 
tion of the details and such close association with them as the 
effort of translation throughout the years of high school and 
college entails. In no other way can these details of classical 
life become a permanent possession. It is almost impossible, 
in the first place, for one not familiar with Latin literature to 
succeed in feeling the full force of such words as ‘omen,’ 
“portent,” “piety,” “religion,” “inaugural,” “auspices,” 
“vow,” “Rome,” etc., and to gain an adequate conception of 
the importance of the ideas back of these words in any con- 
sideration of Roman life. The English dictionary gives him 
the facts but not the atmosphere which in some way or other 
has come to surround these words in the mind of the classical 
student during his years of reading in Greek and Roman 
literature. Except in rare cases he must be satisfied with a 
superficial understanding of such points. In the second place, 
what he does get is likely to’be transitory. Nothing is more 
common than to hear a non-classical student say about some 
point in mythology, for example, “I have looked that name 
up dozens of times but I can’t seem to remember it.” His 
knowledge on this point has been too easily and hastily acquired 
to be lasting. These two disadvantages, then, inability really 
to grasp the full significance of certain facts in connection with 
the life of the past and a tendency to forget or confuse them, 
are the penalty, except in unusual cases, for a neglect of classical 
training.

  LATIN PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT PART IN THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH OF TODAY 
There are more than 300,000,000 people in the Catholic 
church, all of whom sing hymns in Latin, listen to a Latin ritual, 
and use Latin prayers. There are 500,000 priests whose use of 
Latin in the ritual averages two hours a day. Many of these 
speak Latin. Moreover, since Latin is the official language of the 
church, all formal documents, correspondence, and edicts are 
written in this language. It was not an unusual thing under 
the late pope, Leo XIII, to see one of his Latin letters in our 
newspapers.

   ANSWERS TO SOME COMMON OBJECTIONS TO THE 
STUDY OF LATIN 
         
   1. “It’s too hard” 
   Perhaps it’s not so hard as you think. Perhaps you are 
lazy and do not like to do anything that does not immediately 
interest you and so calls for an effort of your will. Anyone 
who has had much experience in life will tell you that very few 
things that are really worth while come easily. Do you know 
Herbert Spencer’s famous definition of education: ‘‘to accus- 
tom myself to do the thing I know I ought to do at the time 
when I ought to do it, whether I feel like doing it or not”? 
                     
  2. “It takes too much time”           This depends upon how much-you think it is worth and the 
price in time and labor that you are therefore willing to pay. If. 
you believe in it, you will not grumble at spending a fair amount 
of time upon it. Ifyou are putting an exorbitant amount upon 
it, it is likely that you are not well prepared for it and ought to go 
back, or that you have not really learned how to concentrate 
your mind when you are studying. 
          
        
  3. “You forget it all, anyway”    This really is not an argument against Latin, unless you 
believe that education is solely a matter of learning facts which 
may be used in after life. Whether you remember the facts 
you learn in high school or college does not really matter. 
Very few men and women in middle life could pass an examina- 
tion on the facts of physics, chemistry, or mathematics which 
they studied in school. (Ask the teachers on your faculty how 
much they remember about the actual facts of work in other 
departments.) But they may be none the less “educated” 
people because, while they were receiving ‘‘information,” they 
were really going through a process of “formation,” e.g., their 
faculties Avere being so trained that they can not only acquire 
knowledge when necessary, but make the most intelligent use 
of their powers in the various situations of life.

this book.

      oe Mr “Tt’s a ‘dead’ language; nobody speaks it now” 
You mean that nobody actually speaks it in the form used by 
the Romans of Caesar’s day. But does anyone today speak the 
English as it was used in the time of King Alfred? If you read 
the Lord’s Prayer in the English of that day you could only 
understand six words.! We do not speak the English of Chau- 
cer’s time either. And yet English today is not called a “dead” 
language. We only say that it has changed greaily since the 
days of King Alfred and Chaucer. In the same way Latin has 
changed since the days of Caesar, but in its modern form (now 
called Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Roumanian— 
the latter a direct survival of the language of the Roman legions 
quartered in that country)—it is still 90 per cent Latin. More- 
over, it is actually spoken to some extent in the Catholic Church 
of today. It is a much greater fallacy, of course, to say that 
Greek is a “‘dead’”’ language when modern Greek is still so 
largely spoken. 
5. “It isn’t practical; it doesn’t help you to earn money”    This sounds as though you thought that only the things 
which have a money value are worth having. But if you were 
to make a list of the things in life which are really fine, such, for 
example, as matters of character—loyalty, bravery, honesty, 
reliability, right habits of work, etc.—or a liking for beautiful 
music, a taste for good books, an admiration for great deeds or 
a reverence for things that are holy, you would at once realize 
that money plays a very small part, after all, in the real “riches” 
of the world; for some of the men who have had almost no 
money have had these treasures. The mere fact, then, that you 
cannot trade Latin for money, would not be an argument against 
it except in the case of the boy or girl who is pressed by immedi- 
ate necessity of earning a living. If you are in this position, you 
are right about thinking that Latin is not a ‘“‘practical’’ study 
for you.

    6. “I haven’t time to take much Latin and a little of it isn’t 
worth while’”’ 
But even a little will help you to guess the extent to which 
English words are indebted to Latin; it will give you, too, a 
training in grammatical relations which will help you in English 
expression and other language work and start you in habits of 
accurate thinking which are universally valuable; it will make 
Rome more than a mere name in your mind and will make you 
better able to profit by reading English translations since you 
will have some slight knowledge of the original language as 
a basis for your understanding. 
7. “It’s easier to read the translation and it’s just as good” 
Do you think the wrong side of a piece of embroidery is as 
effective as the right, or that you get as much from hearing 
Caruso on the Victrola as when you listen to him at the opera ? 
Do you enjoy looking at a photograph of your friend as much as 
you do seeing him? And yet, except in a few cases, there is 
about the same difference in vividness between the translation 
and the Latin original. But you will not realize this until 
you have learned to know Latin well.

       LETTERS TO HIGH-SCHOOL BOYS AND GIRLS IN 
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, “IN YOUR OPINION, 
IS THERE ANY PRACTICAL VALUE IN STUDYING 
GREEK AND LATIN?” 
      
     “Tn my opinion the study of the Latin language and litera- 
ture, if pursued in a living way, is an admirable training for the 
powers of perception, judgment, andimagination. It makes one 
of the best possible foundations for higher culture or for a pro- 
fessional education. I think that the change in the conditions 
and tone of modern life has made classical study not less but 
more important for everyone who wishes to have a well dis- 
ciplined and efficient mind.”—Henry van Dyke, Professor_at_— 
Princeton University, February 3, 1913. 
          
         
       
      
  “T wish sincerely that my engagements made it possible for 
me to discuss the relation of Greek and Latin to practical life, 
but it is literally impossible for me to do so. I can only say that 
I have always felt that Greek and Latin underlay all genuine 
culture.””—Woodrow Wilson, Princeton, N.J., February 5, 1912. 
             
    
  “Tn my judgment, a classical training is as important today 
in fitting a man for the affairs of life as it has been at any time 
since the sixteenth century: in some respects, I believe it to 
be more important.”—Bliss Perry, writer and literary critic, 
formerly editor of the “Atlantic Monthly,” February 5, 1913. 
          
    
  “Replying to your favor of 6th instant, I have a very strong 
belief that a thorough knowledge of elementary Latin is of much 
practical value to everybody in whatever walk of life he may be 
engaged. My own observation and experience has confirmed 
that impression very strongly. As a matter of fact, I very 
frequently have occasion to regret that I did not keep my own 
knowledge of the classics more actively brushed up.’’—George 
W. Wickersham, Attorney-General of the United States, 
Washington, D.C., January 18, 1913.

question by telling you a little of my own experience. I ama 
writer, and naturally have found a knowledge of Latin very useful

as I have with literature it is indispensable. I have traveled 
somewhat in the Mediterranean countries, and there, too, 
I found my Latin of great practical value. Then, again, in 
acquiring a knowledge of Italian and French, I found my Latin 
schooling was like an elementary training for modern Roman 
languages, and made my mastery of vocabulary, especially, 
very much easier and more rapid. These are the practical 
advantages that I have personally experienced from the eight 
years that, as a boy, I gave in part to continuous Latin study. 
But, after all, what I most value in the general result is the 
lifelong pleasure I have had in Latin literature and the sense of 
indebtedness I feel to the classics for that formative power both 
over my thought and its expression, which has been insensible 
in its operation. The classics are a part of my heredity—of my 
intellectual blood and bone. 
“But I am only one man, and my profession as a writer sets 
me rather more apart from the. body of educated men than 
usually happens in life; and, though I think a classical educa- 
tion great good fortune for a writer and indispensable to anyone 
who would live much in the past and realize the old tradition of 
wisdom and beauty in his own life and spirit, yet I should not 
think a man necessarily lost without it; I think it is the best of 
all educations for the free soul; but, on the other hand, I do 
not look on any education as essential to either human dignity 
or service, and there have been admirable forms of education 
without Latin. 
“Tn brief, I think a classical education most serviceable in 
forming the mind and tastes of a boy who is to have the happi- 
ness of an intellectual or artistic life, or of some part in such a 
life by reading or travel or sympathy; but for technical or 
vocational training, or for purely commercial ends, and generally 
for what is sought as a thing of material use, I should not think 
that Latin mattered. On the other hand, I do not think that 
either translations, or the modern languages themselves, are a 
substitute for direct acquaintance with the older training. 
“So I send you these few words, in lieu of any discussion; 
just to express my own view, as you ask it, based on my own 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
experience, and observation; but I should be far from wishing 
to impose my view on others or from seeming to give a decision. 
You and the other boys who have such matters to decide must 
look to your own natures and likes and aims, and then, with 
the help of older friends, perhaps, do the best you can. Latin 
is not the bread of life—one can live without it very well; 
but for the man of letters and for boys of that temperament, 
it is a good ration in the early barrack-years.”—George E. 
Woodberry, writer, critic, and professor of English at Yale 
University, February 2, 1913. 
“Unless one’s estimate of life is entirely upon the basis cf 
dollars and cents, there can be no question as to the advisa- 
bility of pursuing such studies as tend to culture intellectual 
development. The study of the classics qualifies one to enjoy 
the fine things that this, as well as other ages have produced. 
It is also a useful training in the development of capacity for 
achievement, which, in short, is the end and aim of all educa- 
tional instruction.” —Herbert E. Hadley, ex-Governor of Mis- 
souri, April 9, 1913. 
“Personally, I believe that the striving for immediate ends 
is a poor conception of education and that we ought to have 
faith enough to look ahead and educate for the larger life to 
come. Least of all do I think that young people can be judges 
of what is advantageous in the long run.”—J. M. Taylor, 
President of Vassar College, May 23, 1913. 
“Speaking for myself, I should look upon life without the 
memories and the pleasures that gather around and grow out 
of a study of the Classics as existence in an intellectual desert.” 
—Nicholas Murray Butler, President of Columbia University.

  120 THE LARGER MEANING OF THE TERM “PRACTICAL” 
AS APPLIED TO EDUCATION * 
There are two ideas of the meaning of education current 
today in America. According to one, education should be 
concerned with immediate usefulness; it should prepare a boy 
to earn money at once. From this viewpoint the practical 
studies are those that give him the information which he is to 
use immediately in his business. These are known as “‘voca- 
tional” studies, of which bookkeeping and stenography are 
examples. According to the other view, education should not 
be concerned primarily with preparation for earning money, 
though it must include this ultimately, but rather with the 
developing of the individual so that he may know how to live 
as well as how to make a living. Looked at in this way, all 
studies that tend to “form” a man rather than “inform” him 
are practical. It is upon this broader idea of the word that the 
claims of Latin as a practical study mainly rest. However, as 
this Exhibit shows, it is really practical, to a certain extent, in 
the narrower sense also. For not only does it not prevent one 
from making money, but on the contrary, it actually makes his 
chances better in the long run, while at the same time affording 
him a training which will make his life apart from his business 
career far richer and broader than it would otherwise be. 
  “TI am profoundly convinced that the only practical educa- 
tion is the one which aims directly to the training and enlarging 
of the mind. The most practical gift we, as teachers, can pre- 
sent to our students by means of which they may be able to 
win their way in the world is the power of thought. If we can 
teach our students how to think, we have taught the secret of 
‘practical’ success.”—John G. Hibben, President of Princeton 
University. Letter to student, February 12, 1913. 
“T will preface what I have to say in regard to the term 
‘practical’ as applied to education with the observation that 
in each of our conscious moments we are engaged in one of three 
kinds of activity: namely, those of (1) our work, (2) our social

and Home Education” for March, 1914, entitled Fundamental Distinctions between 
Vocational and Liberal Education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  
       relation, (3) our leisure. Education that does not make an 
effective workman is defective, but equally so is education that 
does not produce an intelligent and effective citizen and neigh- 
bor, and again, equally so is education that does not prepare one 
to make an appropriate use of his leisure. The term ‘practical’ 
should be interpreted in the light of that observation. It is 
an obvious mistake to hold that the only practical aims of edu- 
cation are those that are expressed in economic terms. To 
put it in another way, the production of a skilled workman 
is not the only practical end of education.’”-—Nathaniel Butler, 
Professor in the School of Education, University of Chicago. 
Letter to author, March 19, 1913. 
“There is no word more grotesquely misused in educational 
discussion than the word ‘practical.’ In any proper sense of 
the term, ‘practical education’ is that which does most for 
the enlargement of life by extending its interests, intensifying 
its powers, and deepening its sympathies. For these ends, 
the pursuit of historical and literary studies is incomparably 
more ‘practical’ than any other. In my opinion, the study of 
Greek and Latin stands in the very front rank of ‘practicability,’ 
and it is enough to make the angels weep to see such things 
as bookkeeping and cooking and carpentry seriously considered 
as being of anything like equal importance with classical and 
other humanities.”—William Morton Payne, LL.D., Writer 
for “The Dial.” Letter to student, February 15, 1913. 
“What kind of education makes people most efficient for 
general purposes? Honestly answering this, though I am my- 
self professor of a radical and practical subject, I am bound to 
say that purely practical considerations go far to justify the old 
system of classics and mathematics in comparison with anything 
newer.”’—Barrett Wendell, Professor of English, Harvard Uni- 
versity, “The Privileged Classes,” p. 168. 
“As a time-saver and as a sure road to the topmost round 
of all things that require strong, critical, and clear thinking, 
I would urge the patient and untiring study of the Greek and 
Latin languages.”--James R. Day, Chancellor of Syracuse 
University.

A “PRACTICAL” END OF EDUCATION LIES IN ENJOY- 
MENT OF THE POWER OF THINKING 
President Meiklejohn of Amherst College in defining the 
aim of a liberal education says that the man who has been trained 
to think has a constant source of joy and satisfaction. May this 
not be quite as “practical”? an end of education for the boy 
removed from immediate necessity for earning money as one 
that looks mainly to utilitarian ends? He writes as follows: 
“When the man of the world is told that a boy is to be trained 
in thinking because of the joys and satisfactions of thinking 
itself, just in order that he may go on thinking as long as he lives, 
the man of the world has been heard to scoff and to ridicule the 
idle dreaming of scholarly men. But if thinking is not a good 
thing in itself, if intellectual activity is not worth while for its 
own sake, will the man of the world tell us what is? -There are 
those among us who find so much satisfaction in the countless 
trivial and vulgar amusements of a crude people that they have 
no time for the joys of the mind. There are those who are so 
closely shut up within a little round of petty pleasures that they 
have never dreamed of the fun of reading and conversing and 
investigating and reflecting. And of these one can only say 
that the difference is one of taste, and that their tastes seem to 
be relatively dull and stupid. Surely it is one function of the 
liberal college to save boys from that stupidity, to give them an 
appetite for the pleasures of thinking, to make them sensitive 
to the joys of appreciation and understanding, to show them how 
sweet and captivating and wholesome are the games of the mind. 
At the time when the play element is still dominant it is worth 
while to acquaint boys with the sport of facing and solving prob- 
lems. Apart from some of the experiences of friendship and 
sympathy I doubt if there are any human interests so perma- 
nently satisfying, so fine and splendid in themselves, as are those 
of intellectual activity. To give our boys that zest, that delight 
in things intellectual, to give them an appreciation of a kind of 
life which is well worth living, to make them men of intellectual 
culture—that certainly is one part of the work of any liberal col- 
lege.” —‘‘ Amherst Graduate Quarterly,” November, 1912, p. 61.

WHAT IT MEANS NOT TO KNOW LATIN 
“But to have had no Latin at all practically means that you 
do not know the logic or understand the categories of general 
grammar and those forms of language which are at the same time 
forms of thought; that you do not know and cannot safely 
learn from a lexicon the essential and root meanings of English 
vocables, and can therefore neither use them with a conscious- 
ness of their prime sensuous force nor guard yourself against 
mixed metaphor; that you are mystified by the variations 
of meanings in like Latin derivations in Shakespeare, the 
Romance languages, and modern English; that you have no 
historic feeling for the structure of the period which modern 
prose inherited from Isocrates through Cicero; that the diff- 
culty of learning French or Italian is tripled for you, and the 
possibility of really understanding them forever precluded; 
that you have no key to the terminology of science and. phi- 
losophy, to law and international law Latin, and Latin maxims, 
druggists’ Latin, botanists’ Latin, physicians’ Latin; that you 
cannot even guess the meaning of the countless technical 
phrases, familiar quotations, proverbs, maxims, and compendi- 
ous Latin formulae that are so essential a part of the dialect 
of educated men that the fiercest adversaries of the classics 
besprinkle their pages with misprints of them; that you cannot 
study the early history of modern science and philosophy, or 
read their masterpieces in the original texts; that Rome is as 
remote for you as China; that Virgil, Horace, and Cicero are 
mere names; that French literature is a panorama without 
perspective, a series of unintelligible allusions; that travel in 
Italy loses half its charm; that you cannot decipher an inscrip- 
tion on the Appian way, in the Catacombs, in Westminster 
Abbey, on Boston Common, or on the terrace of Quebec, or 
verify a quotation from St. Augustine, the Vulgate, the Mass, 
Bacon, Descartes, Grotius’ On War and Peace, or Spinoza’s 
Ethics, to say nothing of consulting the older documents of 
English law and institutions, the sources of the civil law, on 
which the laws of Europe and Louisiana are based, the Monu- 
menta Rerum Germanicarum, or Migne’s patrologia, or reading 
123

a bull of the Pope or a telegram of the German emperor; that, 
not to go back to Milton and the Elizabethans, who are unin- 
telligible without Latin, you cannot make out the texts from 
which Addison’s Spectator discourses, you do not know half 
the time what Johnson and Boswell are talking about; that 
Pope and all of the characteristic writers of the so-called Golden 
Age are sealed books to you; that you are ill at ease and feel your- 
self an outsider in reading the correspondence of Tennyson and 
Fitzgerald, or that of almost any educated Englishman of the 
nineteenth century, and even in reading Thackeray’s novels; 
that half of Charles Lamb’s puns lose their point; and that 
when “Punch” alludes to the pathetic scene in which Colonel 
Newcome cried ‘‘absit omen!” for the last time, you don’t

  FOREWORD 
Wuart consequences for religious education follow from the 
now widely accepted social interpretation of the Christian mes- 
sage? The present work is an attempt to answer this question. 
The answer is not simple. For the social message does not 
require us merely to insert this or that new duty into our present 
scheme of living, but also to judge every detail of conduct from 
a higher point of view. We are required to organize the whole 
of life upon a different level. 
It would be strange indeed if the new meaning that this gives 
to every-day affairs did not change our outlook upon child life. 
If we are to be logical and practical in our social Christianity, 
we must revise our policies with respect to children at least as 
much as our policies with respect to adults. The chapters 
that follow undertake to show the directions that this revision 
will need to take. 
As we proceed, it will appear that the whole perspective of 
religious education undergoes a change. The central purpose, 
to begin with, grows more specific because the nature of good- 
ness is seen to be as concrete as the neighbor who lives next 
door. Christian experience comes out of the clouds, because 
in our dealings with our brother whom we have seen we are deal- 
ing with the Father whom we have not seen—yes, we here come 
into relation with what is deepest in his character and purposes. 
To Christian ears these statements do not sound strange, per- 
haps, yet when they are applied to the religious life of the 
young they do sing a new melody. A profounder significance 
attaches to the will of a child, and especially to his relations 
with persons, whether children or adults. 
All the plans and methods of religious education have now 
to be reorganized with reference to these social relations and

experiences. A new measure is provided for the material 
that goes into the curriculum of instruction. Organizations 
that undertake to educate, whether the family or the church, 
meet a different test from that which has been traditional. 
Theological and ecclesiastical types take on new meaning, and 
they encounter demands that they have not always foreseen. 
The educational relations between state and church, likewise, 
have a different look when we approach them from the stand- 
point of a thoroughly socialized religion. Not less true is it 
that emphasis now shifts from one part of educational psychology 
to another. 
Through my whole discussion there runs a conviction that 
within Protestantism there is, or is coming to be, a distinctive 
religious principle, that of a divine-human industrial democracy. 
“My Father worketh even until now, and I work.” I believe 
that here the Christian religion contains a permanently progres- 
sive element, and therefore a motive for self-criticism as well 
as for criticism of “the world.” Religious education, conse- 
quently, is here thought of not merely as a process whereby an- 
cient standards are transmitted, but also as having a part in 
the revision of standards themselves. 
Another conviction that controls my discussion is that educa- 
tional organization and methods are not static tools, like 
saws and hammers, which are indifferent to the structures that 
they build, but living and moving parts of the collective life. 
A democracy cannot afford to use in its public schools the 
methods that an autocratic state finds adapted to its purposes. 
When the purposes of society are transformed, education must 
be made over. Protestantism cannot make Protestants of its 
children by the methods of Catholic teaching. A divine- 
human democracy cannot grow up through educative processes 
that have in their nostrils the breath of autocracy. 
These are themes of high intellectual interest. They are 
also religious issues of the greatest import. They have a direct 
bearing upon even the ordinary duties of religious educators. 
The humblest worker will do better work if he knows the why 
and the whither of it than he will if he merely follows some

prescription. Therefore I hope that this book of mine will be 
found practically helpful by those who bear the heat and the 
burden of the day in the schools of the church, as well as by 
those who guide congregations or whole communions. 
As my study of this theme has progressed, I have been more 
and more conscious of the magnitude of the problem, and of 
its unending ramifications. I cannot hope to have said the 
last word, nor to have escaped error, but I dare to hope that 
others will be stimulated to face the issues and to declare their 
own convictions. I trust also that my faults will be judged in 
the light of the fact that this is the first attempt to work out in 
a systematic way the consequences that will follow for religious 
education when it is controlled by a fully social interpretation of 
the Christian message. 
While these chapters have been in progress the wail of chil- 
dren in the lands at war has been in my ears, a wail for the 
fathers of whom they have been bereft, a wail for bread, a wail 
for a decent world in which to grow up. To my thinking it is 
a cry from all the children of the world for the sort of education 
that faces, and understands, the great madness that is abroad, 
and not only understands, but also knows the resources of 
human nature and of religion. Even while I have been writing 
about educating children in the love that loves to the utter- 
most, I, as a citizen of the United States, have gone to war! 
I am so bound into one with my neighbors that I cannot, if I 
would, act as a mere individual; and my neighbors and I, who 
constitute the United States of America, are so bound up with 
neighbors beyond our national boundaries that our moral 
destiny is intertwined with theirs. We and they must rise to- 
gether, or we shall not rise at all. Forward, out of nationalism, 
with its limitations upon brotherhood, into world society! But 
we are partly of the past, “red in tooth and claw,” and only 
partly of the ideal future. With our hands we fight our broth- 
ers; with our hearts we abhor fighting. ‘Wretched men that 
we are! Who shall deliver us out of the body of this death ?’ 
The future of society depends upon the sort of social education 
that we think it worth while to provide.

  x FOREWORD 
Any reader who is familiar with present movements in educa- 
tional thought will perceive, as this work proceeds, how much 
I owe to writers who have had in mind the public school rather 
than religious education. I am indebted most of all to John 
Dewey, who is foremost among those who have put education 
and industrial democracy into a single perspective.

CHAPTER I 
WHY SO MUCH THEORIZING? 
Have we theory enough already? Whoever makes a re- 
flective choice between educational ends, and then determines 
by systematic analysis what are in general the means whereby 
the chosen ends can be most certainly and most economically 
reached, has a theory of education in the sense in which the 
term “theory” is used in this work. A theory of education, 
then, is simply knowledge of what we as educators want and 
how to get it. 
A committee was discussing plans for a training institute for 
workers in religious education. “What we want,” said one 
member of the committee, “is something practical. We don’t 
want theories.” To this another committeeman replied: 
“What have you against theories? We have practice already, 
and practice is what makes all our trouble. Theory is the thing 
we need. We're perishing for want of it!” Doubtless the 
first of these men meant to stand for applied knowledge as 
against ineffective thinking, while the second meant to stand 
for applied knowledge as against ineffective practice. Both 
really wanted theory in the present sense of the term. 
Of theory in this sense we can never have too much. That 
we have, in fact, altogether too little of it—that our workers 
do not discriminate with sufficient care either ends or means, 
do not think enough upon what they are about—is certain. 
An enthusiastic young student of religious education, upon a 
visit of observation to a certain Sunday school, asked the super- 
intendent: “What is the purpose of this school?” The super- 
intendent hesitated, requested that the question be repeated, 
3 , 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
4 THE NEED OF THEORY 
hemmed and hawed, and finally replied: “Well, what do you 
think it ought to be?” The simple fact is that we are doing a 
great many things because they have been done before rather 
than because we have a reason for doing them. If we are 
asked for a reason we commonly give one that is so general as 
to be without point. We say, for example, that our aim is to 
make our pupils Christians, but if we are then required to say 
whether we aim to make all of them Christians immediately, 
on the present Sunday, or only by and by, and just what we 
mean by a pupil-Christian, it turns out that our apparently 
clear end is foggy after all. 
Nor is the case any better with our notions of the means to 
be employed. Which is the most certain and the most eco- 
nomical way to produce such or such a change in this or that 
Sunday-school class? Are you pursuing your present methods 
because you have any reason to suppose that they are the most 
effective possible? And when the work of a year or of a series 
of years is done, how do you definitely know to what extent 
you have attained your purpose? Questions like these answer 
themselves. Our work is famishing, and our pupils are perish- 
ing, because we have not enough theory. 
Ineffective practice produces defective theory, and per- 
petuates ineffectiveness thereby. It is no more true that a 
poor theory leads to poor practice than that poor practice 
leads to poor theory. Theories of education have all arisen 
within practice; they are attempts to think out what already 
exists. The reason why we stop to think is, indeed, that we 
are not altogether satisfied with things as they are, but yet 
we do not invent a better state of things “just out of our heads.” 
No, we make improvements by mixing a little that is new 
with much that is old, and this mixing occurs in our thinking 
as well as in our practice. ‘That is, more or less of yesterday’s 
practice is always taken into to-day’s thinking as a presupposi- 
tion, or not-yet-analyzed premise, and then this thinking is 
used to justify the very practice from which it is derived. Now, 
some of yesterday’s faults always escape attention; some of them 
are ever being accepted as virtues. For example, methods of 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE NEED OF THEORY 5 
family discipline that defeated their own aims have dominated 
theories of such discipline. Many a parent has conscientiously 
made goodness unattractive to his children, and then recom- 
mended that all parents go and do likewise! Many a progres- 
sive-minded Sunday-school worker unconsciously bends his 
standards to fit Sunday schools as they are. He has a theory, 
but it is not sufficiently critical. 
The consequence of this is that the cause of religious educa- 
tion requires the repeated reopening of matters that seem to 
be already settled. The reason is not that revolutions are 
desirable, but that our thinking, being under the influence of 
our own defective past, never reaches a point where it can prop- 
erly say: “Here I have reached finality; here revision will 
never be necessary.” This is the pride that goes before a fall. 
The spirit of true theorizing is humble. It says to itself: “In 
all probability my present views ofreligious education are a 
mixture of truth and error. Let me, then, scrutinize them once 
more, and may the succession of scrutinizers never fail !”’ 
The main problem is how to make Christian education 
sufficiently, as well as efficiently, Christian. We should stum- 
ble into a total misconception if we were to think of a theory 
of religious education as an attempt to control religion from 
outside itself, as, for example, by mere speculation. No, it 
is an attempt to judge our religious performances from within 
religion. Christian education is to be thought of as through 
and through the Christian religion in operation. Its methods 
are to be scrutinized and revised from the sole point of view 
of religious effectiveness. Its aims also are to be weighed in 
religious scales, and no others. 
Not only do old methods come to us bringing hay, wood, and 
stubble along with precious metal, but the same is true of old 
purposes. They, also, as well as methods, have to be “trued 
up” from time to time, partly because we forget something 
that came to us in the hour of spiritual vision, partly because 
insight into the meaning of life does not attain fixity in any 
generation. There are depths in the Christian message that 
our fathers’ plummets did not sound; there are depths that will
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 THE NEED OF THEORY 
remain unknown until generations yet to be born shall ask their 
own fresh questions. Accordingly, when we reflect upon the 
existing aims of Christian education with a view to revising 
them, we are engaged in an attempt to make them more Chris- 
tian. We are not satisfied to become more efficient upon yes- 
terday’s religious level; we aspire to raise the level itself. Our 
problem is to make Christian education as Christian as possible. 
The application of this remark to the situation of the churches 
to-day is unmistakable. The aims and methods of Christian 
education, as of church life in general, that this generation 
inherited were predominantly individualistic. We have been 
so taught as to think of the great salvation as a rescuing of in- 
dividuals, each by himself, from the guilt and the power of sin, 
and of establishing them, each by himself, in the way of right- 
eousness. When Canon Fremantle gave us the phrase “the 
world as the subject of redemption” we had to think twice be- 
fore we could see just what it meant. For most Christians 
were still thinking of the increase of Christ’s kingdom in terms 
of a mere census, a mere count of individuals rescued out of an 
evil world. But our generation has come to see that the re- 
demptive mission of the Christ is nothing less than that of 
transforming the social order itself into a brotherhood or family 
of God. We are not saved, each by himself, and then added 
to one another like marbles in a bag or like grains of sand in 
a sand pile. A saved society is not made by any such external 
process. We are members one of another in our sins, and we 
are members one of another in the whole process of being saved 
from sin. I cannot go alone either toward or away from the 
kingdom, for it is my relation to some one else, a relation of 
help or of hinderance, that determines the direction that my own 
character is taking. “In this the children of God are manifest, 
and the children of the devil: Whosoever doeth not righteous- 
ness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that 
we should love one another.”’ For us of the present generation 
the duty of making Christian education sufficiently Christian 
will mean bringing it into line with this social message.
-P-A-G-E-19
    THE NEED OF THEORY 7 
Love as an inclusive law for education has not been worked 
out in theory or tried in practice. This is an astonishing 
thing to say, but it is strictly true. We have endeavored to 
include love within education as one item among many, but we 
have not taken it as the higher and inclusive conception by 
which to determine our aims and by which to test our methods. 
We have been accustomed to start the educative process out- 
side of the act of loving, say in some dogma or religious rite, 
expecting somehow to get inside love at some later time. We 
have not thought of method as systematized love producing 
its like, that is, as the divine social order, already started on 
earth, and here and now giving children a place and an incentive 
to grow within itself. We have not conceived religious educa- 
tion as itself a part of the campaign for the social righteousness 
that the law of love requires, or as an actual initiation into the 
social relations that belong to the citizens of the kingdom. 
Rather, we have assumed that the campaign for social righteous- 
ness is an affair of adults exclusively. We have even hesitated 
to bring it to church with us lest it should disturb reposeful 
contemplation of God. As if we could contemplate the Father 
without thinking about that upon which his heart is set, or as 
if he himself could have peace of mind only by taking a vaca- 
tion from the rest of the family ! 
Here and there, in fragmentary ways, we have begun, it 
is true, to experiment with lessons that touch upon love in action. 
Social-service activities, moreover, have here and there be- 
come a regular part of the educative procedure. But as yet 
these are additions to presocial religious education, or pallia- 
tives of it, rather than an attempt to socialize the whole con- 
trol. Thorough socialization will require a fresh approach to 
the curriculum as a whole. It will require us to re-examine 
the organization of religious education in order to see whether 
the social relations in which the child is here already placed 
do themselves train him in active love and in methods of 
co-operation. It will require us to scrutinize every de- 
tail of teaching method to see what sort of social relation 
it involves between teacher and taught, and between pupil 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 THE NEED OF THEORY 
and pupil. Here, surely, is need for a theory of religious edu- 
cation. 
The theory of public education is undergoing a trans- 
formation that is of the utmost significance for the churches. 
The old assumptions of public education, like those of religious 
education, were individualistic. The day school was expected 
to put the pupil into possession of certain tools (as reading 
and writing), and to impart a certain minimum amount of 
useful knowledge (as geography), all of which was thought of 
as preparing him to live as an individual. To-day we cannot 
think of the public schools as having any smaller task than 
that of preparing young citizens for living together. Moreover, 
we are engaged, in both theory and practice, in bringing school 
training closer and closer to the every-day occupation of a citi-— 
zen, his labor for a livelihood. 
The growth of the social idea and of the industrial idea in 
public education is significant for the churches in several ways. 
In the first place, humanitarianism is getting a new organ, one 
that promises to become immensely efficient. The state can 
hardly train its citizens in the art of living together without 
teaching, more or less, the brotherhood that is of the heart. 
Nor can this teaching go very far before it awakens thought 
upon the ancient injustices that persist in society. Moreover, 
when the school, with this growing social outlook and inlook, 
is brought close to the industries, it is bound, sooner or later, 
to interpret to our whole people, either intentionally or other- 
wise, the meaning of “the food which perisheth,”’ the significance 
of labor, of income, and of wealth. All these are ancient in- 
terests of the Christian preacher, and they are present, vital 
concerns for Christian teaching, whether of adults or of chil- 
dren. 
What shall the churches do, then, with respect to these new 
developments in the theory of public education? How can 
we be unmoved by what is going on? If we really believe in 
the axioms of Christian living, we cannot be indifferent. Nay, 
we whose consciences are just now being pricked by the neglected 
social elements in our religion, if we have even a moderate
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE NEED OF THEORY 9 
amount of practical sense, must take our place as citizens be- 
side those who have seen a social vision in public education. 
We must try to understand what the vision saith; we must 
support and encourage the reformers in their hard task, and we 
must gladly tax ourselves for public education as we have never 
taxed ourselves before. 
But we shall not empty out of the church into the state 
school the whole function of social education. Rather, we shall 
define and realize more definitely than ever before the educa- 
tional implications of the old faith that God himself is love. 
Gladly co-operating with every one who endeavors to put the 
love of one’s neighbor into education, we shall go on to probe 
the educational significance of the two great commandments 
. in the Christian faith. For us there must be a theory and a 
practice in which the love of God to us and our love to him are 
not separated from, but realized in, our efforts toward ideal 
society, the family or kingdom of God. Such a theory of 
Christian education we have not as yet. 
Four components of educational theory. The divisions 
adopted by each writer upon this subject are likely to depend 
more or less upon his notion of convenience in exposition. 
But the following components will be found in one or another 
form in any broad analysis: 
(1) An indication of the kind of society that is regarded as 
desirable. 
(2) A conception of the original nature of children. 
(3) A conception of the sorts of individual experience that will 
most surely and economically produce in such children the kind 
of sociality that is desired. 
(4) A statement of at least the more general standards and 
tests by which one may judge the degree to which these sorts 
of experience are being provided by any educational institu- 
tion or process. 
All four of these parts of a complete theory will be found in 
the following pages, though not in this precise order. In a 
general way, Chapters II to V, inclusive, concern the first 
point; Chapters X to XIII, the second; Chapters VI to IX and 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 THE NEED OF THEORY 
Chapter XIV, the third, and the remainder of the book the 
fourth. But I have made no effort to schematize my treat- 
ment. Rather, I have endeavored to be concrete, even though 
thereby problems crowd together somewhat, and even though 
the same problem appears more than once.

THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT IN MODERN 
EDUCATION 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
 
-P-A-G-E-25
CHAPTER II 
GENERAL EXPOSITION OF THE SOCIAL 
STANDPOINT 
Various uses of the term education. Education, in the 
broadest sense of the term, takes place wherever a plastic 
mind acquires a set of any kind. It is often said, for example, 
that a child receives much of his education from contact with 
nature—from falls and bruises, obstacles and achievements, 
and the beauty of natural scenery. 
In a less broad sense, education lies in the contribution made 
by society to the set of a mind. Again and again has it been 
pointed out that only through association with his elders can a 
child attain to civilized life at all. The total difference that 
such association makes in the organization and outlook of 
his mind may be regarded.as the education that he receives. 
The ways in which society forms an individual are, however, 
in large m unsystematic and even unintended. The 
“social inheritance” of an American child, for example, in- 
cludes the influence upon him of all such things as sights and 
sounds upon the street; newspapers; public amusements; 
political contests; business and social customs; waves of public 
opinion; home conditions—indeed, the influence of every man 
and of every “man way”’ that he meets. 
As far as these things—any of them—are controlled for the 
purpose of giving a set to young minds, we have education in 
the third and strictly technical sense. 
It is with education thus technically understood that the 
present book is primarily concerned. Often, indeed, we shall 
find ourselves analyzing the unintended influence of men and 
women upon children, but always for the sake, ultimately, of 
more clearly defining our deliberate purposes. Deliberate 
13
-P-A-G-E-26
  14 THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 
educational purpose underlies many undertakings besides 
schools. A family is an educational institution. The same 
can be said of certain phases of the public library, the art mu- 
seum, and the natural history collection of to-day. For they 
arrange their possessions and advertise them in part with the 
young in mind, and they even provide trained instructors. 
The children’s room, the children’s adviser, and the story 
hour in the modern library are educationally eloquent. The 
playground movement likewise is educational in the strict 
sense, for it accepts the axiom that facilities for play should 
be so organized that the players will form socially valuable 
habits. 
The position of the churches in this constellation will have 
our attention after a time. But even this partial and merely 
representative list of the educational institutions of modern 
society would be defectively representative if it did not men- 
tion juvenile courts and new types of law concerning children 
and youth. When a child violates a law or an ordinance, an 
enlightened legal system no longer merely inflicts pain and 
deprivation upon him because of his past, but considers how to 
form him into a good citizen. To this end, physical, mental, 
and social diagnosis is employed to discover - causes of the    
    delinquency, and then the offender is sente to be educated 
by the most skilful methods that science can devise! This 
blending of the conception of justice with that of education is 
extending itself to various parts of law. The abolition of child 
labor, and the restriction of labor in the adolescent years, have 
an avowedly educational motive, as have ordinances that 
regulate the relations of children to the streets and to public 
amusements. We are, in fact, moving toward the notion that 
society, wherever it is in contact with children and youth, 
should be a consciously educational force—in short, that the 
young should be constantly at school merely by virtue of 
their presence in our civilization. 
Society is not merely one educator among many; it is the 
prime educator within all educational enterprises. If teach- 
ers, parents, librarians, story-tellers, playground directors,
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 15 
judges in juvenile courts, and legislators who press for child- 
labor laws will but reflect upon their educational enterprise, 
they will perceive that it is not their own. They act as agents 
for society. This means not only that they labor toward social 
ends, but also that the power that does the work is one or 
another social influence operating through them. This is 
obvious in the case of all who are employed by state or church, 
but it is true of the others also. A parent teaching his child 
a grammatical form, or manners at table, or a standard of 
moral conduct, is himself at the moment under the control of 
his group in respect both to what he teaches and to the fact that 
he teaches anything at all. Moreover, the effectiveness of his 
teaching depends in large measure upon the existence of a social 
environment that backs it up. In a profound sense, then, 
the educator in all education is society. This proposition is 
not invalidated by the incompleteness of our social integration 
—our divisions into parties, social classes, and churches— 
with the resulting ambiguity of the term “society.” For in 
each of these groupings the educational worker is moved by 
his group consciousness, and he endeavors to give effect to the 
things that bind him to his fellows, be the fellowship narrow or 
broad. 
“Unfoldin owers of the child” is an inadequate con- 
ception of the work of education. Since society is the educa- 
tor, we may ask next, What is society about when it educates? 
It is dealing, of course, with unfolding powers or growth. But 
every child has many powers, better and worse. It is the 
essence of education to discriminate between them, and while 
promoting the growth of some, to prevent the growth of others. 
The same distinction has to be made when we meet the state- 
ment that the aim is to help children toward “self-realization,”’ 
for behind this statement lies the unexpressed assumption that 
there are different sorts of self that an individual may become, 
and that education must give the advantage to some of these 
as against others. 
What education does is, in a word, to bring the child and 
society together. It increases one’s participation in the com-

  16 THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 
mon life. It puts a child into possession of the tools of social 
intercourse, such as language and numbers; opens his eyes to 
treasures of literature, art, and science that society has grad- 
ually accumulated through generations; causes him to appre- 
ciate such social organizations as the state, and develops habits 
appropriate thereto; prepares him to be a producer in some 
socially valuable field of labor, and evokes an inner control 
whereby he may judge and guide himself in the interest of 
social well being. 
Education aims at “social adjustment and social effi- 
ciency.”? This phrase represents the strong reaction of re- 
cent years against all formal conceptions of education, that is, 
conceptions that involve no notion of guiding the young in the 
social application of the powers that education brings out. To 
define the aim of education as the unfolding of children’s 
powers is like saying that the purpose of a railroad is to cause 
cars to move from one place to another. What the cars carry 
and whither they are going are the important considerations. 
The strains that have developed within our industrial and civic 
life since the coming of machine manufacture, steam transporta- 
tion, and the massing of the populace in cities have compelled 
us to see that the attitudes and the outlook of children with 
respect to their fellow men are the prime rn of schools. 
At the same time, poverty on the one hand, and the increas- 
ing specialization of occupations and of industrial and commer- 
cial processes on the other, have convinced educationists—that 
is, those who investigate education and promote educational 
standards—that every child ought to receive assistance in the 
selection of his occupation, and also specific preparation for 
skilful work in it. The more democratically minded among 
us are coming to think of the future in terms of industrial de- 
mocracy, an organization of producers governed by producers. 
Hence it comes to pass that progressive schoolmen are largely 
occupied at the present moment with problems of occupational 
training and vocational guidance. 
Scarcely more than twenty-five years ago educationists were 
still disavowing industrial ends, which they distinguished from
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 17 
those of “general” culture. Manual training was in some of 
the schools for the sake of formal mental discipline and the 
teaching of numbers, but avowedly not as an introduction to 
fundamental processes in manual industries. I remember a 
time when college heads turned up their noses at “ bread-and- 
butter education.” If the blindness of some efforts at the “ prac- 
tical”’ partly justified this scorn, it in turn was blind in that it 
saw not the social-ethical significance of earning one’s living 
by daily toil in one’s trade or profession. 
To-day we think of education as a way of getting the human 
energy of each new generation effectively applied to the main- 
tenance and the-increase of human welfare of whatever sort. 
Keeping children well, and teaching them how to keep them- 
selves and their community well; showing them how to manage 
a home, with its need for many sorts of skill; introducing them 
to the civic, industrial, and philanthropic institutions of their 
community; acquainting them with the machinery of govern- 
ment and with the duties of citizens; opening the way to skill 
in an occupation, and revealing the riches of play as well as of 
literature and the fine arts—all this, which the schools of 
yesterday left largely to chance, is being incorporated into an 
education that deserves to be called “ new.” 
The reason for mentioning these things in a discussion of 
religious educa will appear fully in later chapters. Al- 
ready, however, it must be evident that the relations of the 
church to the child as well as to the adult are going to have 
their setting in a new world. Religious education is bound to 
be judged from fresh standpoints. “Imparting”’ certain “sub- 
jects of instruction” is becoming thin and threadbare as a 
conception of teaching. “Inciting” to “virtue” in general will 
seem flat to children who are accustomed in their daily school- 
ing to the enrichment of concrete social experience and to par- 
ticipation in important specific social enterprises. Moreover, 
when the schools become an agency for applying human en- 
ergy, instead of providing a merely general or unapplied cul- 
ture, they move in the realm of life purposes in which religion 
has a vital interest. In particular, education that aims to pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 
duce devotion to the social weal touches at its very heart the 
religion that has set out to change society into a brotherhood. 
Education aims also at the progressive reconstruction of 
society. Adjustment of a child to society just as it is does not 
satisfy the educational conscience, or even the conscience of 
society in general. Our social conservatives themselves would 
condemn an educational system that sought to preserve our 
social organization unchanged. No; education selects some 
parts for preservation, while it condemns other parts, and 
toward still others is silent lest children should find out how 
bad we are. What a confession society makes in every school 
that it supports! It says, in substance: “Here are a few things 
of permanent worth that we have already achieved; here, in 
addition, are our many unfulfilled aspirations, our unsolved 
problems. Try to be wiser and better than we have been.” 
Thus, education is not only society’s supreme act of self- 
preservation; it is also society’s most sincere judgment upon 
its own defects, and its supreme effort at self-improvement. 
These statements do indeed outrun most of our educational 
practice. Our dealings with the young, especially our insti- 
tutional dealings, have no immunity from the inertia of tradition 
or from the ansesthesia of self-interest; and our thinking, as 
was indicated at the beginning of Chapter I, grows within 
practice, not in a different world. Actual education is a mix- 
ture of points of view. Nevertheless, the idealization of life, 
which implicitly if not explicitly condemns our actual life, is of 
the essence of educational practice. At the present moment, 
far more than yesterday, this idealizing takes on the social hue 
of almost all intense ethical reflection in our day. If, then, I 
have myself idealized the social aim of education, I have merely 
used with respect to education its own method of viewing life. 
The basal process in education is social interaction. To 
bring society and the individual child together is the aim. 
This means that what we have to teach the child is humane and 
just living in the various relationships, and also active, well 
directed labor that contributes to the common life of the pres- 
ent and likewise to the improvement of it. It might seem
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 19 
superfluous, but the history of schools proves that it is not, to 
point out that, in the last analysis, social experience is the only 
thing that can thus socialize any one. The first concern of 
education is not a text-book or anything that printer’s ink can 
convey, but the persons with whom the pupil is in contact, and 
the sort of social interactions in which he has a part. On the 
face of the matter, how could any one become adjusted to society 
in the absence of society, or become socially efficient without 
social practice ? 
Some applications of this principle appear as soon as we 
begin to reflect upon it, but others are less obvious and more at 
variance with tradition. In respect to the more obvious per- 
sonal relations between pupil and teacher, and between pupil 
and pupil, the principle is already in operation in progressive 
schools. Thus: 
(1) The conduct and the personality of the teacher are generally 
recognized as of prime wmportance. It must be admitted, never- 
theless, that present methods for training teachers do not 
luminously suggest any theory as to how the desired personal 
qualities can be developed. Moreover, neither the economic 
status of teachers, nor methods of appointment and dismissal, 
nor provisions for growth and for social practice after entering 
the service, can be quite reconciled, as they stand to-day, 
with the universal emphasis upon personality. 
(2) In the organization and management of a school, and of 
each schoolroom, every enlightened teacher sees an opportunity 
to train children in co-operation and self-government. The term 
“self-government” should not be restricted to experiments in 
which pupils have been organized in imitation of the State, 
with its legislative, judicial, and executive officers. Self- 
government is more than social mechanism of any pattern. 
It is first of all socialization of the teacher’s attitude toward 
pupils, that is, recognition of the present value of the pupil’s 
personality. From this recognition will flow encouragement to 
free action, to free reflection, and to specific methods for the 
organization of freedom, with its inevitable social pleasures and 
pains. It is not the elaborateness of these methods that 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
20 THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 
counts, nor yet the absence of influence from the teacher. 
There can be, and in some experiments in pupil-government 
there appears to have been, an artificial sociality—artificial be- 
cause created merely ad hoc and isolated from the larger society. 
What is needed is the development of freedom, initiative, and 
co-operation within the existing relations not only between pupil 
and pupil, but also between pupils on the one hand and their 
teachers, the local community, and the State, on the other. 
Self-government in this sense is the sure touchstone of school 
discipline. 
(3) In the modern school, the play of pupils, which is made 
up almost altogether of social interactions, comes under supervision. 
The least reason for supervision is the prevention of abuses; 
the primary function is the promotion of social and socializing 
play. Hence, the supervisor of the playground teaches the 
children games adapted to their respective social capacities, 
and assists in the management of-contests, all with a view to 
the discipline of social joys through the enrichment of them. 
(4) Studying and reciting also are a field for social experience. 
Instead of trying to isolate each pupil with his book, and then 
instead of stimulating each one in the recitation to selfish 
emulation, or to purely self-regarding avoidance of discomfort, 
the teacher treats the subject-matter as a social possession, and 
as a sphere for a co-operative enterprise in learning, so that 
each pupil “contributes to the recitation.” 
(5) The school of to-day introduces the pupil to community life, 
and gives him real functions in it. Around elections, holidays, 
civic anniversaries and festivals, much instruction in the ideals 
and the ways of society is made to centre. Historical incidents 
are dramatized, and community pageants are produced. The 
pupils are made acquainted at first hand with the machinery of 
the local government. They meet the policeman face to face, 
and learn from his lips how they can co-operate with him in 
the maintenance of laws and ordinances. Children are organ- 
ized to keep streets and alleys clean, and to combat disease. 
A few hours before these words were written, there passed under 
my window a squad of children (“squad”’ is the name that they 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 3 21 
used for the group) all equipped with paraphernalia for removing 
cocoons of the tussock moth from the shade-trees of a city. It 
is significant of the educational organization of this campaign 
that the squad was under the command of an elder pupil. 
(6) It now becomes evident that if the basal process in educa- 
tion 1s social interaction, the ancient isolation of school experience 
from other experience must be overcome all along the line. This, 
I take it, is the fundamental idea of a new type of boarding- 
school that has appeared in the German and Swiss Landerzieh- 
ungsheim, and in the Bedales School in England. Children, 
both boys and girls, ranging in age from the primary to the 
mid-high-school grades, are placed in a country home under 
conditions that reproduce as far as may be the life of a family 
that supports itself upon the land. Here, in connection with the 
traditional “studies,’”’ the pupils sow and reap, manage domestic 
animals, construct and repair buildings, and make apparatus 
for their games and plays, all in the continuous society of their 
teachers. These groups are necessarily small, but the same 
principle appears in the large public schools of Gary, where 
pupils repair the furniture, keep the accounts, and even pay the 
teachers. 
The same principle is determinative of the subject-matter, 
the order, and the use of the curriculum. The procedures 
that have just been described have general approval because 
they provide for social training through social experience. 
But they are almost altogether outside the pupil’s experience 
of the contents of the curriculum as something to be learned. 
Can the curriculum, too, be brought under the head of social 
experience, or must it, in the nature of things, remain, as it is 
in most schools, a thing that contrasts with practice, a prelimi- 
nary to social experience rather than a part of it? The answer 
has been given by Professor Dewey. Organized and stated in 
my own way, it is this: 
(1) The claim of any sort of knowledge or of skill to a place 
om the curriculum must meet the test of social fruitfulness. It must 
be something that enriches the common life. The content of 
instruction is to be drawn primarily from the area of social 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  22 THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 
experience in the strict sense, that is, experience that men 
have of one another, and specifically from experiences that 
society has an interest in reproducing and developing. Sub- 
ject-matter that is not thus directly social, as parts of mathe- 
matics and of the physical sciences, is to be treated as social 
in the sense of being a common interest of society. 
(2) The “knowledges” and “skills” thus selected are to be 
taught in an order that is determined by the pupil’s own growing 
social needs and functions. In his relations within the family, 
the play group, the school, the city, a child has from the be- 
ginning problems of social adjustment, social efficiency, and 
social reconstruction of his own. Grading the subject-matter 
of instruction consists primarily in introducing him, in each of 
these social situations, to the material that he can use and 
enjoy. This genetic-social order cuts across and to some 
extent supplants the old logical classification or linear arrange- 
ment of studies (reading, arithmetic, history, etc.). What has 
to be mastered at each turn is a function or enterprise—a term 
that applies equally to learning a trade, learning the duties of 
a voter, and mastering the processes involved in playing at 
storekeeping or with dolls. In the strict sense, the curriculum 
is a succession of these enterprises, not a succession of “subjects 
of instruction.” These subjects will now come along in order 
and amount as they are needed, and they will draw their vitality 
as instruments of education from the fact that need for them 
has arisen. 
(3) Each piece of subject-matter is to be approached through a 
motive that is, in this very act, in process of social growth. The 
ideal is that no pupil should ever have a purely individualistic 
attitude toward any item or toward the labor that is required 
to master it. To develop self-centred individuality first, as 
traditional methods tend to do, with the intention of subse- 
quently transferring its strength to social enterprises, is a double 
blunder. On the one hand, it tends to defeat its ultimate social 
purpose by forming individualistic habits that are hard to break; 
on the other hand, it makes no provision, or inadequate provi- 
sion, for the growth of social purpose, but assumes that it can
-P-A-G-E-35
  
  THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 23 
spring into being fully formed. The social approach to subject- 
matter that is only indirectly social may be conveniently illus- 
trated by one of the present approved methods of teaching 
certain numerical processes. Instead of merely drilling the 
pupil upon printed tables and imaginary problems, the play 
of storekeeping is introduced, with its demand for measuring 
and weighing, making change, and keeping accounts. 
(4) All this means that the old separation between living and 
preparing to live is to be done away with even in studies. The 
separation is to disappear from the mind of both the pupil 
and the society that educates him. Just as play, which is so 
large a part of real life from the pupil’s point of view, is being 
incorporated also into the adult’s interests, so, on the other 
hand, the occupations of adults, and their civic ideals and enter- 
prises, instead of being withheld from the pupil until he shall 
in some mysterious way pass from education into life, now be- 
come material of education, a sphere in which the child and his 
seniors live an unbroken community life. In short, in their 
entire life in the public schools, pupils are to be thought of as 
simply fulfilling their functions as members of the State. 
An important corollary, or more properly part, of this move- 
ment to identify education with life, is the transformation that 
is taking place in our notions of what constitutes a school. 
We are beginning to see that a school is not a thing to be grad- 
uated from and left behind. Within a mile or two of the desk 
at which I write these words there are school buildings and 
grounds at which the people provide for themselves the follow- 
ing facilities for their common life: Evening classes in wood- 
working and cookery; classes in citizenship for immigrants, 
and a reception to new citizens upon their naturalization; free 
baths for young and old; match games of baseball for the young 
men; dancing-classes and dancing-parties under wholesome 
supervision; a forum for political discussion; art exhibitions; 
entertainments of various kinds, as on the evening of election 
day, when the returns are received by a special wire. 
A brief formulation of this theory of school organization, 
methods, and curriculum is as follows: Social character and 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
    24 THE SOCIAL STANDPOINT 
efficiency are to be achieved through social experience; social 
experience is to be had primarily through the performance of 
social functions, but it may be extended through imagination 
in the use of well-selected and well-graded subject-matter 
that represents the social experience of the race; school experi- 
ence is most effective educationally when the pupil experiences 
the least break between it and the life of the larger society.
-P-A-G-E-37
CHAPTER III 
THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING OF THE NEW 
SOCIAL IDEALS IN EDUCATION 
The general relation of education to philosophy. The 
tendencies to which the last chapter called attention may be 
summed up as the social idea in education. Because of its 
depth or comprehensiveness, this idea may be called philosophi- 
cal, and as far as it controls educational practice we may say 
that education is applied social philosophy. We do not stum- 
ble any longer at the notion that life and philosophy may be 
one. To the old saying that “Philosophy bakes no bread,” 
the reply is, What but philosophy can bake bread? Wheat 
does not make itself into loaves; fire and oven are breadless 
without the baker, and he is a baker because of the ideas that 
guide his hands. These ideas, because they concern the ends 
and means of living, represent, as far as they go, a philosophical 
interest. To philosophize is to open one’s eyes and gaze all 
around the horizon so as to see whence and whither one’s steps 
are tending. Neither by its subject-matter, nor by its methods 
of analysis, nor by any aloofness of aim is philosophical thinking 
set off from any other. It is distinguished as philosophical by 
its comprehensiveness, thoroughness, and persistence. 
A glance at the setting of the movement for socializing educa- 
tion will show that we are dealing with no split-off part of 
thought or of social life, but with the whole moving social mass, 
and with its growing awareness of the meaning of its own move- 
ment. 
The educational ideals that this generation inherited. 
If the question “What is the ideal of modern education?” 
had been asked thirty years ago, the most probable answer 
would have been somewhat as follows: “The mark of moder- 
25 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 
nity is recognition of education as falling within mental growth, 
which proceeds from within outward by unfolding, not by accre- 
tion. This implies that the freedom of the child is respected, 
and that the great function of teaching is to assist him to ade- 
quate free self-expression.”’ If one had asked to see a dis- 
tinctly modern school, a kindergarten would have been pointed 
out, and the progressiveness of other schools would have been 
measured chiefly by their responsiveness to the great message 
of the movement that bore the name of Froebel. 
In the ideal of freely unfolding individuality two closely 
related influences are discernible, that of philosophical idealism 
and that of the movement for popular government. On the 
philosophical side the greatest single impulse came from 
Kant. In his Kritik der reinen Vernunft (1781) he maintained 
that mind does not come upon its world as something ready 
made, but builds it forth out of mere raw materials of the senses. 
We have a coherent world at all, it was said, only because we 
impose upon these materials certain forms and categories that 
are of the nature of our mind. Otherwise stated, the structure 
of our mind is the organizing principle of any world that we 
could possibly know. In a sense, then, the meaning of all 
experience is preformed in us. Kant’s great idealist successors, 
Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, labored to show, each in his own 
way, what this meaning is and how we become aware of it. 
The educational corollary of this idealistic movement is 
that we should not impose ready-made ideas or rules upon 
the child mind, but rather provide conditions favorable for 
spontaneous mental growth whereby what the child already 
implicitly is will become explicit both as world-outlook and as 
ethical self-guidance. ‘Thus it was, in part, that teacher-wis- 
dom took on forms like these: Adjust your procedure to the 
child mind, not the child mind to some preconceived method 
(hence the necessity of child study and of child psychology); 
to teach is not to impart ideas, but to develop the ideas that 
the pupil already has; no impression without expression; 
we are not to mould the child, but to provide material for him 
to mould; we learn by doing; utilize, do not repress, the child’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 27 
curiosity, his imagination, and his impulses to play and to con- 
struction; the end of the whole is not information or skill, but 
a free personality at home in its world; the ideal teacher is not 
a taskmaster, much less a mechanic, but a friend, a revealer, a 
protecting divinity. 
We cannot stop to inquire what specific part Pestalozzi, 
Froebel, and Herbart had respectively in making such educa- 
tional ideas convincing, or in devising methods for applying 
them. Nor is there space to show how far these ideas ever 
prevailed in the schools. But the essentially religious pre- 
suppositions that are here involved should be noted. Mind has 
the primacy in the universe; experience has meaning that we 
can discover, and even be a part of; duty is the voice of God. 
Hence, if teaching becomes a prophetic office, none the less the 
child himself becomes a “prophet of the soul.”’ To the rever- 
ence for their elders that had been demanded of children, the 
nineteenth century added reverence of adults for childhood 
itself. Every birth was a fresh incarnation of the ultimate 
meaning that pervades things. To invade the personality of a 
child was more heinous than to rob a householder of his goods. 
The second great factor in this educational ideal is the 
aspiration for political freedom that came to partial expres- 
sion in the French Revolution and in the early stages of the 
American experiment in popular government. Consider the 
extraordinary value attributed to the individual by the Decla- 
ration of Independence: Freedom is the natural right, the in- 
alienable inheritance of every man; all just government de- 
rives its powers from the consent of the governed. These 
conceptions belong in the same thought-sphere as idealism, and 
they reinforce its educational corollaries. Into the phases of 
this reinforcement, from Rousseau’s demand for education that 
shall protect the child from social conventions to Horace Mann’s 
labor in behalf of schools for all the people controlled by all 
the people, we are not permitted, in this discussion, to enter. 
What characterizes the whole is insistence upon opportunity 
for the individual, and emancipation for him. As far as the 
schools were interested in good citizenship, it meant, pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 
dominantly, individual competency, particularly intellectual 
competency, for the use of the ballot. 
Why religious education has been slow to assimilate 
the educational doctrines of the nineteenth century. At 
the beginning of the present century we behold in religious 
circles an awakening of educational consciousness that takes 
the form, to a large extent, of self-criticism for the formalism 
of religious teaching, and for its failure to appreciate growth 
and free self-expression. Here was educational twilight after 
a whole century of essentially religious ideals in educational 
thinking. ‘The explanation lies partly in the slowness of schools 
and colleges generally to respond to the newer ideals. The 
practical problems with which the present generation of educa- 
tionists had to start were still those of a curriculum imposed 
upon growing minds rather than expressive of their growth, 
and of formalism in method rather than free self-expression. 
But the main reason for the backwardness of religious educa- 
tion lies elsewhere, namely, in the control of ecclesiastical ma- 
chinery by belief that the meaning of life was fully and authori- 
tatively revealed in ancient times, so that the central function 
of religious teaching is to pass on a completed, unchanging de- 
posit of faith. It is true that in the latter half of the nine- 
teenth century some attention was given to methods in the 
Sunday school. Efforts to train teachers were by no means 
altogether lacking. It is true, also, that in large ecclesiastical 
areas the conscious aim of the Sunday schools was religious 
life, not merely orthodox belief. Yet religious living was 
prescribed, imposed, added to the child; under the ruling as- 
sumptions, spiritual life could not be treated as a free forth- 
living on his part. In Protestantism, then, as well as in 
Catholicism, our century inherited a hiatus between appre- 
ciation of free individuality and the content and the methods of 
religious teaching. 
How the ideals of the scientific movement modify the 
notion of education. Regulated observation and experiment; 
the resultant discovery of laws; new control of natural forces 
as an end result—these are the marks of the scientific movement. 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 29 
Its progress during the nineteenth century constitutes perhaps 
the most momentous, as it certainly does the most rapid, change 
that has ever taken place in the method and the content of 
thought. The already accomplished increase in man’s control 
of nature is astonishing; the possibilities that it suggests are 
fascinating. But the scientific movement has bearings upon 
the relations of man to man that are solemnizing, in some 
cases terrifying, as when we contemplate the present industrial 
conflict and the clash of nations. 
The most obvious educational effects of the movement are 
the introduction of various sciences into the curriculum, and 
increase in the number and the thoroughness of technical courses 
and of technical schools that have as their aim fitness for an 
occupation. A cultivated individual, valued for what he is 
in and of himself, is less and less the standard of educational 
success. The purpose is shifting toward increase of human 
efficiency. 
The notion of efficiency or scientific control is modifying our 
approach to educational processes as well as our ideals of cul- 
ture. Psychology, having become an experimental science, is 
bringing back into educational theory the concept of definite 
control of pupil by teacher—not control in the old school- 
masterish sense of command and compulsion, yet something 
different from the “protecting divinity” attitude, which as- 
sumes that the proper control for the child is already implicitly 
within him, and in need of nothing but adequate encouragement 
to self-expression. What psychology offers to-day is such in- 
sight into details of the teaching process as teachers never 
before possessed or dreamed of as possible. Just as agriculture 
is moving from control by the traditional wisdom of generations 
of farmers to “scientific farming,” with its analysis of soils, 
its tests of seeds, and its plant pathology, so the generalized, 
largely incalculable, and partly intractable “human nature” 
of school traditions is being replaced by measured relations of 
antecedence and sequence. 
We are beginning to control certain factors of inheritance 
also. The upspringing of eugenics brings within sight a time 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  30 THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 
when congenitally defective individuals, who produce the 
least educable of children, will be estopped from reproduction, 
and the better-endowed strains will deliberately control the 
choice of mates, the number of offspring, the conditions of birth, 
and the care of children, all in the interest of an improved human 
stock. Thus education and eugenics, working together, will 
place in somebody’s hands unprecedented power over our 
social destinies. A humanly guided development of racial 
quality, and a humanly guided application of human energy 
in the mass—foresight of these things must be included in any 
comprehensive philosophy of education.1 
Scientific education requires a political philosophy. Scien- 
tific control of nature, which is now an end in education, is 
not separable from scientific control of men and of society. 
It is true that when we arrange the parts of the universe in the 
order of their significance or value, as when we rank them 
under the category of means and end, we contrast man with 
nature. But when we think of the world as an orderly proc- 
ess, as when we ask under what conditions this or that change 
occurs, we include man within nature and its laws just as we 
include the winds and the clouds. Consequently, the sciences 
of man, revealing the specific conditions of specific human acts, 
become a means for controlling men, and scientific education 
puts this control into the hands of specific members of society. 
Mental hygiene and therapeutics, the psychology of advertis- 
ing and of salesmanship, analysis of vocational aptitudes, the 
movement for “scientific management,” and various parts of 
sociology—all are recent advances in this direction. 
We are confronted, then, even as educationists, with the 
question: In what part of society is control to be lodged? And 
to what ends shall control be guided? By educational proce- 
dures we can make an aristocratic or a democratic attitude 
1Control that approximates this already existsin Germany. Reproductionis 
consciously guided, as respects the size of families, by a national ideal, and the 
same ideal permeates education from top to bottom, Back of the amazing ef- 
ficiency that the German nation has displayed in the present war is something 
more than military training and scientific organization of material resources; 
there is also a mobilization of feeling and thought that was made possible by 
previous regimentation of the mind by educational processes.

toward one’s fellows habitual. We can produce submissive- 
ness or self-assertion. We can fix the assumptions of our 
pupils’ social thinking. The paramount question, therefore, 
is this: What social likes and dislikes—that is, habits of feel- 
ing with respect to the regulation of human life by human 
beings—shall we cultivate? For what kinds of authority shall 
we secure respect? We should flatter our day and generation 
unduly if we assumed that educational philosophy has kept pace 
with the multiplying needs for reconstruction of our social 
controls. Yet, all in all, the political philosophy that has the 
greatest influence with American educationists looks forward 
to democratic rather than aristocratic control of the resources 
of both nature and man. ‘That is, the trend is toward industrial 
democracy. 
The educational significance of the doctrine of evolution. 
The evolutionary view of nature, man included, has not only 
provided fresh matter of instruction, it has also placed the whole 
educational enterprise in a new perspective. 
(1) A genetic view of the human mind has been achieved. 
When Kant lectured upon the categories of the understanding, 
or upon the pure practical reason, he referred to mind as he 
thought he found it in himself, an adult human being. Such 
was to him “the” human mind. He felt no necessity for 
asking how it had acquired the traits that he attributed to 
it. The moral imperative—to take the point in his thinking 
that is of greatest social importance—could be understood, he 
thought, by mere introspection, without reference to the moral 
growth of the child, or to the moral development of the race. 
But present thought is convinced that exactly the contrary is 
the truth. We cannot understand the fact of a moral imperative 
without examining the genesis and growth of the sense of duty. 
Mental faculties, or better, processes, of whatever kind have a 
history that connects the adult mind with the child, and the 
human mind with animal minds of all grades. Therefore mental 
beginnings and growth processes in both the human and the 
subhuman realm become significant determiners of economical 
educative processes.
-P-A-G-E-44
o2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 
(2) The instincts acquire a fundamental place in educational 
psychology. 'The older treatments of the learning or the teach- 
ing process were occupied with perception, ideation, and reason- 
ing; to-day we include as fundamental a mass of unlearned 
tendencies to action, and also the constant influence of plea- 
sures and pains. A teacher must now be ready to answer the 
following question concerning each part of his dealing with 
children: Upon what habits already formed, and upon what 
original or instinctive tendencies do you rely for securing the 
reaction that you desire the pupil to make? ‘This question 
applies in the same sense to the learning of arithmetic and the 
learning of courtesy and upright conduct. 
(3) The doctrine of evolution, which contemplates the indi- 
vidual in his relations to a species, leads us to think of education 
in terms of racial processes and of racial betterment. Individual- 
istic notions tend to be crowded out of our minds even by our 
attempts to follow nature. For the inclusion of education 
within the notion of natural history looks both forward and back- 
ward—backward from the human toward the brute, forward 
from the brute toward the human, and from the human that 
is toward that which may be. The idea of progress, it is true, 
has no place in the definition of evolution as a mode of change. 
Yet the actual history of life cannot be contemplated in its 
entirety without seeing that progress does occur under natural 
law. Each stage of this history has for us a forelook that gives 
it poetic coloring. Says Emerson: 
‘And the poor worm shall plot and plan 
What it will do when it is man.” 
Thus in its own way evolutionism reinforces idealism. If 
from the natural-history point of view children belong to na- 
ture, from the same point of view nature belongs to them. In 
their education nature takes possession of herself and reaches 
consciously toward goals that are only dimly foreshadowed in 
prehuman species. Whether or not acquired characters can 
be inherited, Davidson is right in regarding education as con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 33 
scious evolution.1. For, in the first place, eugenic control 
of the stock through education concerning reproduction and 
racial interests is already in sight, and in the second place, 
education organizes and directs the actual use of the instincts, 
which are so large a part of our mental inheritance.’ 
The influence of industrial conditions upon educational 
philosophy. Machine manufacture, the factory system, great 
cities, steam and electric transportation, electric communica- 
tion, the massing of capital, and mass movements of laborers— 
these, joined with popular suffrage, Lave produced not only our 
characteristic social strains, but also a type of social thinking 
that is comprehensive enough to be called philosophical. 
Those who say that our problem is to determine the place of 
the human factor in industry do not go deep enough. We are 
really working at the problem of the place of industries in human 
life. Here the question that underlies all others is this: Shall 
there be a permanent servile class? 
The outlook with respect to social stratification has immediate 
and far-reaching educational bearings. 'The so-called laboring 
classes have cherished the public schools largely as a means of 
lifting their children above the necessity of manual labor, or 
if possible out of the class of employees into that of employers. 
On the other hand, industrial training in the schools, with its 
correlate of vocational guidance, constitutes in effect the actual 
predetermination of masses of children to manual pursuits and 
the rank of employee. Labor leaders have been apprehensive 
lest capital should secure control of industrial training, and 
make it not only a means of supplying skilled labor, but also of 
strengthening capitalistic control of the terms and conditions 
of labor. 
That the wage-workers carry an undue proportion of the 
social burdens has become clear. The wage system itself is 
competition in getting the most out of men for the least return. 
Those who receive the least wage are the ones who bear the 
heaviest burden of unemployment, industrial accidents and dis-

eases, and the support of children and of the aged; and this 
condition coexists with unprecedented fortunes amassed by 
applying the labor of these very men to the freely given re- 
sources of the earth. This situation is producing a demand 
that the entire maintenance of the laborer and his family in 
health and disease throughout life be included in the cost of 
production, so that it shall be paid for by those who consume 
the product. But the sense of justice, having gone thus far, 
does not stop. Once take the point of view of a life in its whole- 
ness, especially a life in which father, mother, and child count 
as one, a life therefore that entails itself upon the future without 
known limit—once take this point of view, and you will go on 
to ask why the human factor in industries should not be the con- 
trolling factor; why the conditions under which human energy 
whether of hand or of brain is expended should not be determined 
by those most immediately concerned; whether all the producers 
should not determine the distribution of all the product of their 
joint expenditure; further, in view of the inextricable inter- 
meshing of the industries with commerce, finance, and politics, 
whether the whole economic mechanism must not be taken over 
by organized society as an instrument of the common life. 
When we commit ourselves to a genuine popular franchise 
and to humanitarianism, we commit ourselves against social 
stratification. Education, under such presuppositions, is bound 
to undermine whatever makes for the permanence of a servile 
class on the one hand, and a leisure class on the other. How- 
ever long the road that leads to industrial democracy, popular 
education has entered upon it and cannot turn back. 
Educational bearings of the pragmatic movement in 
philosophy. I shall assume that the reader has some familiar- 
ity with the fresh philosophical doctrines called pragmatism. 
It is a river into which four streams that are of immediate in- 
terest to us have poured themselves. First, psychology, moving 
away from intellectualism toward voluntarism, away from mind 
as contemplation of a world to mind assisting in the struggle for 
existence, provoked the question: Why, then, look for the con- 
stitution of reality in intellectual structure? Why not look 
   
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 30 
for it in the direction of will and action? Second, theology, 
largely because of the results of historical study, found a shift 
of position necessary. The shift was partly toward mysticism, 
but far more toward an ethical grounding for faith. To this 
the Ritschlian movement, which gave the first position to 
value judgments, had already made a large contribution be- 
fore pragmatism as an inclusive philosophy appeared. Third, 
the scientific movement, emphasizing active experimentation 
as the supreme method of discovery, and leading on to the 
notion of indefinite extension of the control of nature in the 
interest of human welfare, secures a completely generalized 
expression in the pragmatic doctrine that the very notion 
of truth is to be assimilated to that of active experimentation 
and its results. Fourth, the fascination that an age of machin- 
ery experiences in its unprecedented enterprises and in its 
immense efficiency crystallizes into the thought that life as a 
whole is enterprise within a universe that contains nothing 
eternally finished and final, but rather invites us to be part 
creators of its flowing destiny. 
Metaphysical idealism had bequeathed to educational phi- 
losophy the notion of a predetermined human nature moving 
toward an eternally predetermined goal, which is the same for 
all individuals. Pragmatism reverses all this as far as possible. 
It undertakes to carry out the notion of cosmic becoming, 
plasticity, potentiality. The glory of human life, it teaches, 
lies not in the faithful repetition of any prescribed program, 
but in fresh impulses that have the vigor to test themselves in 
action. 
Some specific educational tendencies of this mode of thought 
may be formulated as follows: (1) Dissolution of the traditional 
generalized ideal of the cultivated man. Each man is now 
defined by his purposes and what comes of them. (2) Con- 
sequently a drastic criticism of traditional curricula and 
methods of teaching on the ground that they are removed 
from the world’s work, that they lack definiteness of purpose, 
and that they are unable to develop the spirit of enterprise 
or to test the results of it when it is present. (3) Demand 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 
for definite standards and tests of school efficiency. Measure- 
ments in education are stimulated—measurements of the in- 
go at every point in terms of space, time, dollars, and persons, 
and of the outcome in terms of health, amount and accuracy 
of work done, rate of improvement, extension of interests, and 
persons equipped for specific functions in society. This in- 
sistence that we shall know how costly and how efficient each 
factor is tends to displace the notion that faithful teaching is 
patient persistence in prescribed methods. (4) The unifica- 
tion of the school with the enterprises of the community, 
among which making one’s living is frankly included. In a 
farming population the old break between the school and the 
farm will be done away with by bringing agriculture into the 
school. A shoe-manufacturing community will be recogniza- 
ble as such from its schools. This principle has many applica- 
tions, some of which, especially those that involve conflict 
between social ideals, are far from being easy. 
The pragmatic movement takes as reality that which 
works, or has positive results, satisfactory or otherwise. It 
invites us to measure the world and men in these terms, and 
to steer our further enterprises accordingly. But in view 
of the multiplicity of satisfactions, the various levels of de- 
sire from instinct upward, and the conflicts between under- 
takings that are equally natural, some principle of discrimina- 
tion is necessary. It does not appear that we guide ourselves 
altogether by the satisfactions that we have found achievable 
in the greatest amount and with the greatest certainty. Some 
enterprises that achieve just what they go after, and are there- 
fore successful from their own point of view, are nevertheless 
regarded as in reality dismal failures. What pragmatism 
might conceivably do with this “in reality” I shall not stop to 
inquire. The query is raised merely for the sake of indicating 
the chief difficulty in the pragmatic control of education, 
namely, how to avoid a shallow pragmatism of immediate ends. 
Pragmatists are in general convinced that social enterprises 
and social satisfactions have validity that individualistic 
ones do not. Thus far pragmatism reinforces the social 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE PHILOSOPHICAL SETTING 37 
philosophy that we have seen forming itself within the theory 
of education. Moreover, the forward look of pragmatism, its 
expectation of the unprecedented, its readiness to press onward 
into the unknown, relate it closely to religious faith and to 
the practical influence of idealism itself. 
These various lines of thought converge toward social 
idealism as a philosophy of life. The metaphysical ideal- 
ism that underlay the educational aspirations of the last 
century offered an inspiring view of human nature. Enfolded 
in the personality, or coming to consciousness in human ex- 
perience, was infinite reason, absolute moral law, the ultimate 
good. Men shared in the very life of God. From such con- 
victions there could but grow concern for common welfare, as 
when, under the stimulus of Thomas Hill Green’s teaching, 
Arnold Toynbee started the social-settlement movement. 
What happens to this reverential regard for man when em- 
pirical science proclaims that there is continuity between him 
and the brute; when philosophy denies the existence of finished 
and eternal principles in his mental structure; when man as 
he is, not as he ought to be, has the franchise; when teeth and 
stomach take seats at council tables where heretofore intellect 
and conscience only had conferred together in solemn dignity; 
and when education takes into its hands the grimy tools of 
industry? What has already happened is an unprecedented 
convergence of conviction that experience finds meaning, and 
aspiration finds scope, in social welfare and social progress. 
This is not the place for raising the question whether this con- 
viction can be reached from so diverse starting-points by rigor- 
ously logical processes. For our purpose it is enough to note 
that attention, in so many types of reflection, does as a matter 
of fact focus upon man as of supreme significance, and upon 
social good as the one adequate sphere of man’s endeavor. 
Social idealism is the philosophy of life that prevails among 
reflective persons, and it constitutes the corner-stone of pro- 
gressive educational theory.

CHAPTER IV 
THE PLACE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN A SOCIALIZED 
EDUCATION 
Ambiguity of the terms “social” and ‘individual.’ 
Shall we assume, even in our use of terms, that life can be- 
come “individual”’ without reference to society, or that “so- 
ciety”? implies of itself nothing as to individuality? Are the 
two merely antithetical, or may they be complementary phases 
of the same experience? The term social is sometimes applied 
to mass action simply as such. In this sense of the term, 
social action might be the blindest sort of conduct, and it 
might have no regard for other human masses, or even for the 
individuals who constitute the acting mass. On the other 
hand, the term individual is sometimes used in a way that 
suggests, if it does not assume, that individuality can be con- 
strued without reference to any human interrelatedness. Yet 
action might conceivably be most highly individualized pre- 
cisely where it is most highly social, and because it is so. In- 
dividual welfare might be individual just because it is shared. 
For separatistic self-regard we already have a special term, 
“individualistic,” but we have no corresponding term for 
mass action that disregards either individuals or other masses.! 
The crowd versus the deliberative group. When we 
speak of the movement to socialize education we should under- 
stand, not increase of mass action merely as such, but increase 
of effective regard for one another—regard of individual for 
individual, reciprocal regard of the individual for his group 
and of his group for him, and regard of one group for another. 
1 ‘* Nationalism,’’ however, is coming to mean something of the sort. 
38
-P-A-G-E-51
THE INDIVIDUAL 39 
Now, social living in this sense involves as a basic function in 
education the disengaging of the individual from the mass, 
both in the consciousness of the teacher and in that of the pupil. 
Social education as such individualizes men. 
It is sometimes assumed that if we only induce children to 
act together in groups we shall thereby socialize them. To 
forget oneself, and gladly to expend one’s energy upon something 
that brings no private profit has, in the statement of it, an ethical 
sound. And the sound is not altogether misleading. When 
a small child is allured beyond the solitary plays of infancy 
into even the planiess romping of an unorganized group of chil- 
dren he unquestionably makes a social gain. It comes by the 
way of simple mental contagion or imitation. But soon his 
play, if it is to continue to be educational, will require some 
planning, and especially “rules of the game” and keeping the 
score, all of which must develop in the players a sharper and 
sharper realization of one another as individuals. Again, 
adults as well as children find it wholesome to relax now and then 
by “letting themselves go”’ for a while with some crowd that is 
bent upon innocent enjoyment. But the complementary 
truth is that in the background even of “letting go” there can 
and should be some “choosing of our crowd,” and some trained 
tastes with respect to what constitutes fun. 
Within mass action we must therefore discriminate two main 
types, that of the crowd and that of the deliberative group. A 
crowd is made up of persons who in the process of forgetting 
self forget others also. What so heedless of individual welfare 
as a mass that is consolidated by forgetting or failing to take 
notice? What so incapable of appreciating other groups, and 
therefore so ready for partisanship? We observe this not only 
in primitive society, but also close at home, as in the senseless, 
lawless, sometimes cruel conduct of student crowds and school- 
boy gangs. It is a trite remark of social psychology that with- 
out any compunctions of conscience the members of a crowd 
often conduct themselves as nothing would induce them to do 
when they act singly. 
In a deliberative group, on the other hand, mass action—
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 THE INDIVIDUAL 
so far is it from the crowd type—stimulates rather than sup- 
presses reflectiveness and regard for others. In fact, we have 
here mass action that arises and maintains itself precisely by 
promoting individuality. This is seen most distinctly, perhaps, 
in groups that have formal rules of order. Here, preliminary to 
each common act, the entire mass “pauses, the chairman say- 
ing: ‘Are there any remarks?’ Then, as if challenging each 
individual to full self-expression, he asks: ‘Are you ready for 
the motion?’ This procedure has been devised so as to pre- 
vent action under suggestion. Individual inhibitions are not 
avoided or suppressed, but invited, spread out for inspection, 
often acted upon separately by dividing the question or by 
voting upon proposed amendments.”! The same social prin- 
ciple appears in many groups of a less formal character. Thus, 
a kindergartner offers to retell the story that is best liked, 
whereupon one child says: “I like this one best,” and another 
child: “I like that one.” “How many like this one best?” 
says the kindergartner, “And how many that one? Why do 
you think it the best?” and then she acts according to the 
deliberate preference of the majority. Similarly a recitation 
can often take the form of a mass opinion of the deliberative 
sort on what “we should do next.” In this way classes are 
led, in actual practice, to assign their own lessons and to agree 
upon one another’s proper grade. 
Let it be noted, now, that children of school age act in crowds 
without any assistance or training from their elders, but 
that without such assistance the deliberative type of sociality 
lags. The needs of the situation are not met by merely guiding 
crowd action toward worthy ends—the group’s mode of action 
must be transformed into co-operative deliberation. There is 
no security for worthy ends short of the habit of considering 
others’ points of view. Without such consideration party 
government becomes tyrannical. Therefore, education for 
society must consist in no small measure in replacing crowd 
action, and susceptibility to crowd influences, by deliberative 
1T have discussed these distinctions more at leagth in chap. VIII of The 
Psychology of Religion (Chicago, 1916). 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
THE INDIVIDUAL 41 
groupings and by habitual readiness for reflective co-opera- 
tion. 
Motive, as well as knowledge and skill, must become 
a conscious possession of the pupil. A socialized education 
will have four immediate aims: (1) That the pupil shall ac- 
quire control of the tools and methods of social intercourse, 
such as language, number, and various social forms afid con- 
ventions. (2) That he shall be favorably introduced to 
society through happy acquaintance with the sciences, liter- 
ature, and the arts, and through participation in the present 
social life. (3) That he shall be trained for an occupation. 
(4) That the motives of his conduct, that is, his own individually 
appreciated and chosen ends, shall be intelligently socialized. 
All four of these aims are included in the educational aspira- 
tions of the day, but the putting of aspiration into articulated 
theory and practice has not proceeded equally in the four 
directions. The problem of scales of values, of inmost loyalties, 
of life purposes—of this germinating centre of every growing 
character—this is the educational problem that teachers are 
taught least about, and it is the one with respect to which 
their plans and methods are least definite and consistent. 
Along with constant proclamation of the ethical or social pur- 
pose of the schools there goes disagreement, as well as much hazi- 
ness, as to the particular ends and processes of moral education. 
In practice there are corresponding hesitation, delay, frag- 
mentariness, and opposition of methods. Some phases of the 
problem of “direct or indirect” methods in moral education 
must be postponed to a later chapter. But we cannot complete 
our present sketch of the social conception of education without 
a preliminary statement upon the point. 
The social aim in education includes the purpose to produce 
individual self-guidance toward the social good. Now, such 
self-guidance implies both knowledge of social causes and 
effects, and preference for certain effects as against others. 
Preference for social good implies resistance to natural, in- 
stinctive selfishness. How, then, can we train children to open- 
eyed social conduct unless we train them in social motives or 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 THE INDIVIDUAL 
preferences; and how can there be discrimination of social 
ends unless one thinks about one’s own relation to the social 
whole and recognizes one’s own tendencies to selfishness? 
Self-conquest is an inevitable phase of social education. 
This point of view implies, of course, that the ethically 
good has some reference to the consequences of conduct. Ethi- 
cal theories that deny this, holding that duty and the good will 
are something in themselves regardless of satisfactions of any 
sort, or that the goodness of an act is measurable by some 
quality of the impulse whence it springs—a quality that can 
be defined without any reference to the foreseen results of the 
act—are largely responsible for the confusion that prevails in 
educational thinking and practice with respect to moral growth. 
Though these types of ethical philosophy are generally giving 
way before others that define the good, and duty, and the good 
will in terms of social satisfactions and social progress, the 
educational significance of the change has not fully dawned 
upon the schools. We may sum up the matter by saying that 
the pupil must be led to form conscious life purposes, not by 
comparing himself with some abstract ideal of duty or of per- 
fection, but by considering the consequences of conduct, espe- 
cially in the welfare or illfare of others. 
The educational use of rules and of authority. What has 
just been said gives us a clew to the proper and the improper 
use of rules and of authority in the school. At least four theories 
of the matter exist in various mixtures: (1) Rules are necessary 
because a school cannot do its work without them. True; 
but how did the teacher become competent to prescribe rules, 
and how shall these children in their turn be worthy to control 
the system of education? Parental authority, it is often said, 
should be so exercised as to make itself unnecessary in the life 
of the child as early as possible. Does not the same principle 
apply to schools? (2) We know what is good for children 
better than they can know; therefore we prescribe for them. 
No doubt we do know better; but wouldn’t it be worth while 
to bring them up so that they will ultimately know even better 
than we do what is good for children? If so, what about simply 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE INDIVIDUAL 43 
imposing our present ideas? (3) Human experience has settled 
some things, and to these the children simply must conform. 
Let us have no ifs or ands here, especially a child’s. Yes, we 
have learned some things by experience. But does it seem 
likely that a child can learn them by the utterly different sort 
of experience that the mere enforcement of rules brings him? 
How are you to make him see and know that the foundations 
of existing social customs and institutions are sound? And if 
he does not see, but instead is confronted with what seems to 
him to be mere power, what is likely to happen? (4) Some 
things are eternally right, and they simply must be. But is 
the eternally right actually realized in anything short of the 
free loyalty of the heart? Moreover, who determines what is 
eternally right? Do you maintain that capacity for apprehend- 
ing it has disappeared from the earth never to return? Do 
you hold that this capacity belongs to one class or set of individ- 
uals exclusively ? 
Unless we intend to have a permanent cleft in society be- 
tween those who command and those who obey, we must, 
it is now evident, so employ rules and authority that they 
shall be continuously passing into something else as the child 
grows. ‘The primary function of some rules, as those that con- 
cern firearms and explosives, may be simply protection of life. 
But the educational use of any rule lies essentially in furnishing 
the conditions that are most favorable for deliberative group 
action. What is required in one case may be postponement of 
action until reflection can set in, or until other individuals can 
be heard from. In other cases rules and authority may so 
dispose satisfactions and dissatisfactions that difficult social 
conduct is made easier and unsocial conduct less easy. This 
is not an approval of either anarchy or the sugar-coating of duty 
so as to conceal its real nature. What is here insisted upon is 
that pupils shall be able as individuals to find present social 
meaning and value in their contacts with society in the person 
of the teacher. Whatever confronts the child at first as a sheer 
necessity (the occasions for which are far less frequent than we 
ordinarily suppose) must, even as he faces it, melt into stimulus 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 THE INDIVIDUAL 
to the use of his own judgment in ways that are social and 
pleasurable.! 
A social interpretation of the sacredness of personality. 
Something fine, and in its way social, is represented in the 
phrase, “the sacredness of personality.” It means at least 
this, that we are to place some checks upon our conduct sim- 
ply because other persons are affected by it. But the “sacred” 
or “set apart” may be more or less closely related to taboo. 
Does an exalted view of the rights of persons imply that there 
is in each individual something that belongs to him in such an 
exclusive sense that it ought to be kept to himself, forever un- 
shared? Shall we not hold, rather, that personality is sacred 
precisely because in free individuality, and in it alone, can soci- 
ety fully realize itself? Personality is sacred, not from society, 
but to society. Therefore nothing over which the individual has 
control is to remain unshared. ‘There is to be no purely private 
affair.2 Society, if it is wise, will, indeed, encourage individual 
initiative, and also the reticence that keeps the common good 
in the foreground, and not-yet-socialized impulse in the back- 
ground. Moreover, intimacies that only a few can share, 
as in the family, will be encouraged, but only as far as their own 
happy realization makes also for the wider social good. The 
right of private property will be understood, not as a natural 
right with which one’s fellows must not interfere, but as an in- 
strument of society for the nourishment and education of its 
members, particularly in families. 
The educational applications of this conception of person- 
ality are direct and vital. First, it tends to take officialism 
1On the playground of a certain elementary school the penalty for foul 
playing and for lying is a week’s exclusion from the plays. But the whole 
management of the playground is such that even this drastic rule expresses 
the social consciousness of the players. Result: Remarkable objectivity 
of judgment concerning both one’s own play and that of others, gentlemanly 
acceptance of one another’s word, correct scoring, and relative absence of dis- 
putes. I have witnessed true sportsmanship, and unclouded happiness in it, 
among boys of eight and nine years who were thus privileged. 
2? The evils of self-involution have been made strikingly evident by various 
branches of the psychotherapeutic movement. Merely to open one’s whole 
mind to another, whether physician or priest, often brings relief, inner eman- 
cipation, and fresh social capacities.

out of the pupil-teacher relation, as it does also out of parental 
government. Only a part of the teacher’s business can be put 
into a schedule of specific tasks to be performed, such as sub- 
jects to be taught with this or that degree of efficiency. No 
interest of a pupil or phase of his life is foreign to the true 
teacher, for.everything in every child—everything—is sacred to 
society. On the other hand, everything in the teacher also is 
sacred, and therefore to be shared in due season. The teacher 
and the man are not two. The teacher-pupil relation is that 
of reciprocal self-realization by the sharing of experience. 
Happy the teachers—there are many of them—who through 
their occupation have obtained not only a living but also life! 
Education, being an agency of justice, looks beyond 
social averages. In the juvenile court, as we saw, justice to 
the offending child takes the form of education. Why should 
this be considered exceptional? Is not education as a whole 
the bringing home to each child of what is his due in view of 
the upbinding of his life with that of his fellows? Therefore 
the exceptional child, whether a backward pupil or an unusually 
gifted one, is entitled to exceptional teaching. In the end this 
will mean, of course, adaptation to every individual, and 
therefore important modifications of class teaching. We 
shall thus discover that talent exists in certain “classes’’ of 
the population in greater measure, and in other “classes” in 
smaller measure, than has been supposed. Education will 
discover favorable variations, and bring them to social fruitage. 
Enormous social waste exists at present because individual 
talent goes undiscovered through childhood, and then is 
smothered by too early entrance into the industries. And 
there is ground for more than a suspicion that the students 
who attend our institutions of higher education, where the 
expenditure per pupil is highest, are not being selected for this 
post out of the whole people by rigorous demonstration either 
of superior talent or of superior social spirit in the use of talents.* 
1 Emancipation of the schools from the fallacy of social averages would 
help to rid us of it in other directions. What is the social significance of suc 
statements as that the average wealth of the United States is so or so mucn 
per person? Or that the average wage ina given industry or industri estab

46 THE INDIVIDUAL 
Shall the individual exist for the state? The concept of 
national efficiency, which the present war has brought to our 
attention with unprecedented force, is a challenge to educa- 
tional theory and practice in every land that boasts the free- 
dom of its citizens. Can efficiency of the mass be achieved by 
education that disengages the individual consciousness, and 
puts it into the attitude of mutual deliberation? Must not 
national policies be settled long before the people can arrive 
at a deliberate social judgment? Must not minorities be 
ignored and even repressed lest they draft off energy from the 
main purpose? Must not even majorities be circumvented 
at times because they are clumsy and not overwise? In short, 
does not national efficiency ultimately depend upon applying 
human energy approximately after the manner of a machine? 
Will not the advantage always be on the side of a mechanized 
group as against any group in which the members have ideas of 
their own and a will of their own with respect to the work that 
they do? 
Thoughts like these, which are now in the air, put in jeopardy 
what is most vital to our educational progress. If national 
and international groupings are not to be of the deliberative 
type; if society is to consist, even for a part of the time, of masses 
of men regimented in body and mind, the result will be that in 
times of excitement, when deliberation is most necessary, the 
group will become a mere crowd with its impetuous and ruth- 
less mode of action. This view of national efficiency implies, 
of course, corresponding regimentation within the industries. 
Signs are not lacking that this implication is at least partly 
understood by some of the “captains of industry.’”’ They 
lishment is so or so much per piece, per hour, or per day? Or that the general 
level of wages has risen a certain amount in a given period? An industrial 
commission recently listened to an argument for seven-day labor in a certain 
steel-mill on the ground that the average time off is, or will be, as much 
as one day in seven anyway. Shall we base a minimum wage for men upon 
the average family, or for women upon the average cost of decent living for 
a woman upon whom no one is dependent? There is no room for doubt that 
we are concealing social truth from ourselves by thinking of mankind as 
made up of masses, classes, and averages. The average man, or pupil, or 
welfare, is a mental construct of statisticians. To govern education or the 
conditions of social welfare by mere averages is to render our dealings with 
actual men and actual pupils more or less fictitious and unjust. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE INDIVIDUAL 47 
should reflect that regimentation of labor means ultimately 
crowd action by laborers. 
It is possible to cling to the semblance of freedom when the 
soul of it has departed. Not all submission is irksome. The 
members of any crowd feel emancipated when unrefiective 
contagion is at its height; at the moment when a designing 
leader makes tools of them, they imagine that he leads by 
virtue of their free choice. This is the pseudofreedom of 
irresponsibility. It may easily seem preferable to the birth- 
pangs of real liberty. Let us not be blind to the possibility 
that, under the influence of some nation-wide emotion, our 
public schools, instead of going steadily forward toward de- 
mocracy, which must be deliberative, may be made instruments 
for fastening upon the people one or another class control 
concealed under such specious concepts as efficiency, patriot- 
ism, and self-sacrifice.! 
The cost of a socialized education. We have reached 
the conclusion that socialized education, precisely because it 
is social, must be individualized. The alternatives that have 
to be considered are not “social vs. individual,” but “social vs. 
individualistic,” and “society vs. a class within itself.” In- 
1 Do we realize the import, as respects our liberties, of the recent merciless 
hazing of militiamen to compel them to enter the military service of the 
United States, the hazers and the hazed both being under military command 
at the time? In the free land to the north of us a newspaper was suspended 
by military order because of an editorial opinion that Canada had already 
furnished her proper quota of soldiers for the European war, and that en- 
listments should cease. In the same land a recruiting officer may accost 
a citizen upon the streets, and tease him any number of times, but if a citizen 
replies disrespectfully he subjects himself to legal penalties. It is a fair 
question whether war can be engaged in by any free people without sacrifice of 
liberty within its own borders. For, must not military control extend not 
only to industries and to consumption, but also to communication between 
men, which is a fundamental process in any popular government? Is it not of 
the essence of war to repress criticism of military acts and policies? Repres- 
sion begins by egging on those who are willing to hurl disrespectful epithets 
at their fellow citizens. This of itself interferes with conditions that are 
necessary to the life of a deliberative group. But this informal censorship, 
which is of the crowd type, is crowned by a legalized censorship which, what- 
ever its conscious purpose, has the effect of party government maintaining 
its policies and perpetuating its control by force. The inference to be drawn 
from this is that government by the people has a vital interest in discovering 
some way to end war forever. There will be no security for democracy until 
peace is assured. This truth has educational consequences the full considera- 
tion of which must be postponed to another chapter, 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 THE INDIVIDUAL 
dividualistic education need not be costly, but individualized 
education must be. For, first, it will require educational diag- 
nosis, and educational adaptation, with respect to each pupil, 
and therefore a larger budget; second, it will undertake the hard- 
est of educational tasks, which is the production of self-sacrifice, 
and therefore will call for the highest training of teachers; 
third, it will make the new generation discontented with the 
social-economic order. Let us consider for a moment the third 
of these items, and in a subsequent paragraph return to the 
second. 
To make children deliberately social implies in the first place 
that impulsive good-heartedness must be transformed into 
steady, reflective good-will. It implies, further, that mere 
rules of conduct toward others, as giving money or goods to the 
unfortunate, are to be supplemented by a habit of reflection 
upon the situation of others as individuals, that is, a habit of 
putting oneself in their place. This will lead straight to the 
question, Why should their situation be what it is? Why need 
there be poverty? Why is there so much sickness? Is there 
sufficient knowledge, and are there anywhere sufficient re- 
sources to remove in any large measure the causes of poverty 
and of disease? If so, why are not knowledge and resources 
applied to these primary human necessities? What is it that 
stands in the way of the widest distribution of human welfare? 
When we teach the young to think socially they will not re- 
gard social classes and economic class conditions as naturally 
predetermined and static, but rather as a sphere for the de- 
liberate justice that values human life supremely, and that 
values things and even rights only as they actually minister to 
life. Moreover, such teaching, with its tendency to produce 
deliberative group action, will lead the inheritors and the dis- 
inherited to sit together in calm judgment upon the justice of 
their respective situations, and upon the possibility of a more 
just, that is to say humane, distribution of opportunities for 
adequate living. 
The result is bound to be discontent with the existing social 
order. It is futile to think that any effective teaching of de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
THE INDIVIDUAL 49 
mocracy, or of the supreme value of human life, will leave un- 
challenged the present control which a few exercise over the 
conditions of life—mental and moral as well as bodily life—of 
the many. The outcome must be, not alone increased doing 
for others, but also surrender into their own hands of the means 
to do for themselves. Not less than this will be the cost of a 
really socialized education. 
Consequences with respect to the theory of interest. 
The doctrine of interest in education, stated most generally, 
runs to the effect that the material of instruction must be 
chosen and graded, and methods of teaching devised, so that 
the activities of the pupil in the learning process will produce 
spontaneous pleasure, and therefore be performed from free 
internal impulsion rather than from external pressure emanating 
from the teacher. The pupil is not to be driven, but led; and 
he is not to be led by any and everything but by the inherent 
value of the material or of the enterprise from his own 
point of view. At first sight this may seem to imply “soft 
pedagogy,” which follows the whims of the child, letting him 
do what he likes instead of seeing that he does what is good 
for him. This would be the consequence if children were shut 
up by nature to a single interest at each period of time. But 
as a matter of fact diversity and mobility of interest are prime 
characteristics of childhood. ‘The educator always has several 
possible interests between which to choose, and therefore it is 
possible to feed one repeatedly while allowing another to 
atrophy from lack of exercise. This is not the same as following 
a child’s whims, nor is it equivalent to indulging him in doing 
what is easy and avoiding what is hard. On the contrary, the 
theory of interest requires us to put before the pupil what is 
inherently so attractive that he will work hard with a feeling 
that the enterprise belongs to him as a part of himself. This 
individualizing of what one is doing as one’s very own is essen- 
tially what we mean by interest. 
In point of technic the first requirement for social education 
is socialization of the habitual interests of the pupil with re- 
spect to his school work. ‘This implies, first of all, choosing 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 THE INDIVIDUAL 
material of instruction and arranging the conditions of schooi 
life so that instinctive social satisfactions shall be the basal 
ones. But this is not all. The pupil must be helped to ad- 
vance beyond the unreflective level of instinct. He must be 
led up to the point of self-denial. He must be initiated into the 
great paradox of personality, which is, ability, after facing an 
easier and a harder alternative, to choose the harder as one’s 
very own, and thus determine where one’s satisfactions shall 
lie. The social way is not that of smug self-security through 
canny control of others, but of self-sacrifice for them. We shall 
never stabilize human relations by playing off one selfish in- 
terest against another, but only by freely sacrificing selfish 
interest, only by taking into one’s individual will the very thing 
that opposes it. 
Here is where the teacher’s view of interest in education 
will meet its severest test. Shall the last appeal to the pupil 
be addressed to selfish interest, or to unselfish? Can the teacher 
reveal in his own conduct, and demonstrate to the pupils by 
their own guided experiments in living, that to live we must 
lose our individualistic life?

RECONSTRUCTION IN RELIGIOUS 
EDUCATION

-P-A-G-E-65
CHAPTER V 
THE AIMS OF CHRISTIAN EDUCATION 
Traditions as to the aim of Christian education. The 
aim has been conceived in all of the following ways: 
(1) That the purpose is to instruct the child in the things 
that a Christian ought to know. Back of this purpose lies an 
assumption that our religion consists primarily of a completed, 
authoritative revelation concerning God and duty that needs 
merely to be handed down from generation to generation. 
(2) That the purpose is to prepare the child for full member- 
ship in the church. This definition rests upon such assump- 
tions as that the church is the authoritative expositor and ad- 
ministrator of the fixed revelation just referred to, or that the 
will of God is to be done on earth by drawing men into a par- 
ticular society of the saved. 
(3) That the purpose is to save the child’s soul here and here- 
after. Behind this lie the dogmas of depravity, guilt, and re- 
demption out of the world as distinguished from redemption of 
the world. 
(4) That the purpose is unfoldment of religious capacities, 
or of a germinal divine life, already within the individual. 
Here we witness the influence of idealism, with its doctrine of 
the eternal within the temporal, the infinite in the finite, and 
with its maxims regarding free self-expression. 
(5) That the purpose is the production of Christian char- 
acter. This may mean any one of several different things 
according to the view that is taken of “Christian character.” 
In the statement as it stands there is, for example, no discrimi- 
nation between the notion of a merely individual goodness or 
merely individual relation to God, on the one hand, and the 
53 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 THE AIMS 
contradictory view that genuine goodness can never be merely 
individual and that the Christian God permits no merely in- 
dividual reconciliation with him. 
Without denying that in each of these aims there is some- 
thing that is worthy of permanence, we may assert that they do 
not, either singly or collectively, do justice to the social ideal- 
ism that characterizes the most vigorous Christian thought of 
the day. : 
The ideal of a democracy of God as the determinant of 
ultimate ends. I use the term “democracy of God”’ in place 
of “kingdom of God,” not because I desire to substitute a new 
social principle for that which Jesus taught, but because the 
idea of democracy is essential to full appreciation of his teach- 
ing. After making all needful allowances for the influence of 
contemporary political and religious conditions upon his modes 
of speech and the content of his thought—allowances that are 
to be determined by New Testament criticism—the fact re- 
mains that his desire for a brotherhood of men leads on with 
the inevitableness of fate to the ideal of a democratic organiza- 
tion of human society, and that his fusion of divine with human 
love presents us with a divine-human democracy as a final 
social ideal. 
Without doubt this view of the Christian life has been hast- 
ened by our experiments in popular government, and by our 
experience of social strains connected with the new economic 
order. These modern factors have contributed to Christian 
thought partly by challenging social conditions and assump- 
tions that had been accepted by Christian teaching as the very 
sphere in which the Christian life is to be lived. Instead of 
being a Christian within these limitations, we are asked why we 
should not remove the limitations. The virtue of feeding the 
hungry, for example, loses something of its impressiveness un- 
less it is combined with determination to find and remove the 
causes of poverty. A re-examination of prophetism, the teach- 
ings of Jesus included, has made it clear that thinking upon 
ethical problems, and upon the will of God, in terms of social 
causes and effects belongs within Christian teaching; it is not 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
THE AIMS 55 
merely a modern accretion or fashion. On the other hand, mod- 
ern conditions have helped to reveal the mind of Christ by dis- 
playing more significant outlets for the ancient sentiment of 
brotherly love. When the business relations of most men were 
limited to a small circle of neighbors, good will seemed, naturally 
enough, to find its circumference in the misfortunes that fell 
under one’s own eye. But the enlargement of our social horizon 
by the enormous increase of human intercourse, together with 
the realization that a man’s ballot counts simply because he is a 
man, reflects itself in a vast enlargement of meaning in the 
command that we love our neighbors as ourselves. 
Therefore such questions as the following are becoming a prime 
concern of Christian thought: If one human life outweighs a 
world, as Jesus taught, what should we do with a social order 
that stunts multitudes of human lives for the sake of money, 
and does it; not by disobedience to the laws of the state, but 
under the protection of laws and of courts? How can we really 
believe in human brotherhood if we are willing to acquiesce in 
a stratification of society into the servers and the served, the 
rulers and the ruled? Moreover, if brotherly love is, as our 
religion has always taught, the carrying out of the Father’s 
loving will in human relations, how can the Father himself be 
willing to be an autocrat, an aristocrat, or a plutocrat? Must 
not Christians think of God as being within human society 
in the democratic manner of working, helping, sacrificing, per- 
suading, co-operating, achieving? “My Father worketh even 
until now, and I work.” Divine love, it appears, cannot realize 
itself anywhere but in a genuine industrial democracy. 
Granted this social idealism as the interpretation of the 
life that now is, the aim of Christian education becomes 
this: Growth of the young toward and into mature and efficient 
devotion to the democracy of God, and happy self-realization 
therein. 
The aim is growth because there is now no separation be- 
tween human society and divine, and because the rudimentary 
conditions of human society are already provided for in our 
social instincts. . | 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 THE AIMS 
The aim is devotion to a cause, not the attainment of a status. 
Whoever thinks that Christian education has achieved its 
main end with any pupil when it has led him to cross a line 
that separates the saved from the unsaved—whoever thinks 
this misses the meaning of love. Love is active, outgoing. 
The lover accepts no security that does not include his loved 
ones. 
Moreover, because the aim is active devotion, Christian edu- 
cation does not consist primarily in the transference of a set of 
ideas from one generation to another, but rather in the cultiva- 
tion of intelligent will. When our will is in accord with the 
loving purpose of God, we have the good heart, the life that 
is from above. 
Though the goodness of such a will must be measured by its 
intent rather than by its power, the only test for the Christian 
education of the will lies in increase of the social efficiency of our 
pupils. There can be no successful Christian education that 
does not increase the amount of effective, not merely senti- 
mental, brotherhood in the world. 
Efficiency in achieving these ends must be measured by con- 
crete evidence such as health, food, laws, ballot-boxes, homes, 
streets, schools, happy children, and happy husbands and wives. 
Patience or any other virtue on a pedestal is unconvincing. 
In and through his growing participation in the creation of 
an ideal society the pupil will realize his fellowship with the 
Father. Not by release from toil or from the turmoil of social 
endeavor, not by any retirement within himself as an individual, 
wil the growing child achieve a mature Christian experience, 
but only by doing God’s social will even to the point of suffering 
with him. 
In this losing of his individualism the pupil will gain life. He 
will gain it, not in the ascetic sense of despising satisfactions, 
1 This does not deny all value to times of retirement. When they are 
not a method of evading or forgetting the issue, but of gathering up one’s 
powers to meet it, they are as Christian as hours of active labor. Moreover, 
resthetic contemplation of nature or of art is a fitting thing for a child of God 
whenever it does not separate itself from the purpose of putting all of God's 
children into possession of their proper esthetic heritage. 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE AIMS 57 
not in the mystical sense of denying value to the individual, 
but in the social sense of individual satisfactions that are height- 
ened because they are shared. Everything that is worth while, 
from health to good music, from play to scientific learning, ' 
from food to friendship, will be most worth while when the dis- 
tribution of it is most wide. Here will be found Christian peace 
because feverish calculation of benefits to one’s little self has 
ceased. Here will grow Christian joy in a fellowship of endeavor 
so profound that it can rejoice even in tribulation. Here hope 
lifts up its head unabashed by the vastness of time and the 
tragic frailty of life. This is the life of faith, which is the iden- 
tification of one’s very self with ideal good. 
Social issues of the present as determiners of the end. 
When we ask a Sunday-school teacher what he is trying to 
accomplish with his class, the reply that we commonly receive 
is that he is endeavoring to make his pupils Christians. But 
if we examine the text-book that is in use, or listen to the con- 
versation between teacher and pupil during the class session, 
or observe the general exercises of the school, how much con- 
sciousness do we find of the concrete situations wherein lie the 
issues of to-day between the love of the Father and the love of 
the world? In most cases we behold an effort to make pupils 
Christians in a general, unfocalized sense, which is almost 
certain to encourage a private, ineffective sort of goodness. 
The expression of this goodness in palliative benevolence may 
even beget self-deception as to the Christian quality of one’s 
character. Softening the inhumane results of an unjust social 
order can partially, but not adequately, represent the Christian 
purpose. Let us teach pupils to respond heartily to the call of 
distress, but let us not lull them into spiritual slumber by rep- 
resenting charitableness as the luxury of the good. 
_ We must reveal the terrible meaning of love. Suppose that 
parental love should suddenly acquire power to deal as it likes 
with everything that blasts or stunts the life of offspring; sup- 
pose that wives and husbands could deal as love would dictate 
with every human condition that tends to break up the happi- 
ness of families; suppose that a neighbor could do as a neigh- 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 THE AIMS 
bor would like to do with everything that injures one’s neigh- 
bor; suppose that welfare workers could control the causes of 
illfare; suppose that every business and business method, every 
law, all civil and criminal administration were to be halted 
until it could prove that it is an expression of human good 
will; suppose that love in all these relations should suddenly 
insist upon having its way—what wreckage of our social as- 
sumptions and standards should we witness! Religious educa- 
tion must bring to the light, discredit, undermine, attack, these 
assumptions and standards. It must be clear in its own mind 
that the vocation of the Christian is not to be as benevolent 
as an unbenevolent occupation permits, but also to re-create 
the social system that tends to restrict the sphere of good will 
in his daily occupation. The social issues of the present, then, 
must be taken as the call of God to our pupils, and as the sphere 
of entire consecration to the will of God. 
These issues may be conveniently classified under three heads: 
(1) Social welfare, which has to do with the control of the 
non-human environment in the interest of human life. Here 
belong relief work of every kind; the fight against disease, 
especially at the present moment against tuberculosis, syphilis, 
and gonorrhea; the fight against the saloon; the struggle for 
proper housing; for adequate wages; for good conditions of 
labor; for short hours of labor; for provision against accidents, 
illness, unemployment, and old age, and for facilities for cul- 
ture and for recreation. 
(2) Social justice, which has to do with each man as a factor 
in the life of some other man. Justice to the child means the 
abolition of child labor, provision for the best education, pro- 
vision for play, and protection from unwholesome influences. 
Justice as respects family relations implies a life-and-death 
fight against the disintegrating influences that are all too evi- 
dent. Justice to the citizen requires that he be enfranchised 
in fact and not merely in form, and that partisanship and civic 
corruption, both of which circumvent and depress the franchise, 
be overcome. Justice with respect to the criminal requires 
that society shall requite his evil with good—the good of oppor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  
THE AIMS 59 
tunity for a better life and help toward it—and that the mak- 
ing of criminals by social forces shall stop. Justice to each mam 
as a man commands that we find ways to rebuild our indus-- 
trial and economic system, which at present invites each man: 
to grab what he can of the free gifts of nature, and then to 
grab what he can of the products of other men’s toil. A 
brotherly economic order will be vastly different from regu- 
lated grabbing, mere selfishness made respectable by rules 
of moderation; it will be nothing less than love employing law 
as a means for securing the maximum benefit of every person 
in the industrial commonwealth. 
(3) A world society, or the regulation of the conduct of each 
social group with respect to other groups in such a way as to 
promote the integration of all mankind into a single, demo- 
cratically governed brotherhood. What justice requires from 
each individual in his relations with his neighbor is required 
also from each nation in its relations with other nations. The 
idea of the sovereignty, that is to say the irresponsibility, of 
the state may possibly represent a stage in the social integra- 
tion of men, and therefore not a fall from brotherhood but 
progress toward it. But the same is true of tribal morals. 
Like tribal society, nationalism is at best nothing more than a 
step in a stairway; to pause here as though we had reached 
finality is as unjust as to rest in prenational achievements. 
Patriotism must melt into a larger regard for men. Is it not 
monstrous to find twentieth-century Christians less cosmo- 
politan than the ancient non-Christian maxim: “Nothing hu- 
man is foreign to me”? Religious education must take up as 
one of its specific tasks the production in its pupils of a world- 
consciousness controlled by a sense of justice. 
Amelioration of the horrors of war, important as it is, is not 
enough. War does not merely happen to us, like earthquakes 
and tidal waves; it is rather a climactic expression of the selfish- 
ness, that is to say the injustice, that is organized in our legal 
systems and our national sovereignties. It is a part of the 
same economic grab that erects seizure of natural resources 
into a right to them, and then makes laborers into hirelings. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  60 THE AIMS 
The inner reality of war, of armaments, of national sovereignty, 
and of national policies that seem to render armaments neces- 
sary must all be revealed to our pupils so that they shall enlist 
—heart, conscience, intelligence—in a lifelong, never-relaxing 
crusade against the legalized injustice that underlies them all, 
and for positive measures for organizing good will on a world- 
wide scale. Nothing less than this can be the will of God, who 
is love. 
Are the social issues of the present the affair of adults 
only, or of children also? It seems to be taken for granted 
that if the specific social issues of the present are to be intro- 
duced into the Sunday-school curriculum at all, the proper 
place for them is in the adult class or at most in the later years 
of adolescence. Up to this point the instruction and training 
are directed to the formation of such good habits as obedience, 
truthfulness, and fair play; induction into such exercises as 
private prayer and public worship, and into such enterprises 
as missions; and a meagre introduction to social welfare in the 
form of relief of the poor, the sick, and other sufferers, and in 
some instances in the form of the fight against the saloon. Not 
a word is ordinarily said to children and young people with 
respect to the enormous extent of poverty and the reasons there- 
for, nor as to the reasons why preventable sickness is so prev- 
alent, nor as to the interest of fundamental justice in such 
current events as labor disputes and international friction. 
There is, probably, a sincere belief that tender minds should 
be shielded from the luridness of the contrast between Fifth 
Avenue and First Avenue, and between the multimillionaire 
and his employees. ‘These are felt to be the hard problems of 
maturity, not at all subject-matter for the instruction of 
children. 
But let us not deceive ourselves. While we thus sleep the 
enemy sows tares. From infancy the pupil is in contact with 
the social order as it is; through this contact he is forming 
habits, and not only habits, but also the presuppositions of 
his thinking with respect to men and society. He meets the 
industrial system in many cases in the family “servant,” 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
THE AIMS 61 
and in all cases in the various purveyors of the goods that the 
family consumes. He forms very early in life his notions of 
buying, selling, bargaining, and employing. The current 
ideas as to what constitutes success he takes as his own just as 
a sponge soaks up water. The unrighteous standards all about 
him constantly whisper: “This is real life; this is what hu- 
man nature is; this is what everybody does; grab your share !”’ 
He gets acquainted with newspapers and with newspaper 
morality long before the Sunday school even mentions problems 
of social righteousness. He is aware of the general run of cur- 
rent events, and he interprets them incautiously under the in- 
fluence of whatever social standard happens to get his ear. If, 
then, education postpones mentioning these great issues until 
the near approach of maturity, it has to correct social pre- 
suppositions and purposes already formed. Shall we forever 
go on making the foolish assumption that the will of the child 
remains neutral for years and years with regard to the con- 
test between justice and injustice? Shall we go on postponing 
in education what is not and cannot be postponed in the child’s 
social experience ? 
Some consequences of not focussing the pupil’s atten- 
tion upon concrete social issues. Ethical reality is found in 
social relations, and nowhere else. Here and here only are 
the issues of conscience and of character. Hence it is that, 
when the ideals that religious education seeks to inculcate 
lack social insight and breadth, results like these follow: 
(1) The pupil is led to struggle against faults conceived as 
simply his own instead of for co-operative objects that will super- 
sede his faults and help some one else at the same time. Whenever 
we lead a child to think that he alone is blameworthy for his 
faults, we err as to the facts. A’ faulty will, as distinguished 
from mere inexperience, always involves a conjoint fault in 
which adults have some share. The child: has taken on the 
selfish ways of adults, and then been blamed for doing so; or 
adults have indulged or neglected childish impulses that require 
training; or adults have misunderstood and mistrained him. 
The cure for these conjoint faults is not introversion of the
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 THE AIMS 
child mind, but enlargement of social outlook and purpose, 
particularly in co-operation with adults. 
(2) The pupil is led into unwholesome, sometimes paralyzing 
introspection of the ups and downs of his inner life, or into fruit- 
less reflection upon his status in the eyes of God. That is, 
religious education that ought to fix the pupil’s attention upon 
the things that express the outgoing, self-forgetting character 
of the Father, does exactly the contrary. Consequently pupils 
form petty and distorted notions of the divine. God is taken 
to be a taskmaster, or spy, or aristocrat instead of a worker 
with whom all workers can have fellowship, and from whom all 
can get help. 
(3) The machinery of the church, and exercises that go on - 
within church buildings acquire undue prominence as compared 
with the influence that the church has upon the world that sur- 
rounds it. Ecclesiasticism, it is true, readily associates itself 
with remedial charity even to the point of noble self-sacrifice. 
But this is not the same as devotion to justice in the broadly 
human sense, which is also the broadly divine and democratic 
sense. On this broad basis churchmanship, and all ecclesias- 
tical zeal and loyalty, have to be judged, like the love of one’s 
country, by their tendency to pass or not to pass through all 
narrower societies into world society. 
(4) The pupil is led to separate his daily occupation, the sphere 
in which he makes a living or accumulates property, from his 
Christian vocation. Instead of trying to Christianize his busi- 
ness, he endeavors to be a Christian in business. Consequently 
he imagines that he fulfils the law of love when he gives away, 
by his own arbitrary act, some part of a product that is due to 
the joint labor of many besides himself. If wealth be his, he 
is taught to think of himself as a divinely appointed steward, 
even though traces of God’s love are not obvious in the 
process whereby the wealth was accumulated. The point of 
this is not that one should blame oneself or be blamed by 
others for doing business in the only ways that are possible at 
the present time. Accumulation of property does not neces- 
sarily imply accumulation of individual sinfulness, for the fault 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE AIMS 63 
is a conjoint one. In every business that is cunducted under 
our present system of competition in profit taking, the owner 
has associated with him all the social forces that make and 
administer our laws, all those that create rigid business cus- 
toms, yes, earlier generations that have bequeathed to us their 
own ideas and ways. What is to be expected of the Christian 
business man is that he will not only be generous as generosity 
is measured under our capitalistic presuppositions, but that he 
will also be just by doing everything within his power to curb 
and ultimately make impossible the exploitation of human 
life for the sake of profits. The real function of every business 
must be held to be, not the greatest possible concentration in 
the control of goods, which are conditions of welfare, but the 
greatest possible increase and the widest possible distribution of 
welfare itself. To hold business to this function is one of the 
fundamental phases of any real Christianization of the world. 
In the daylight of a purpose like this, what a shadowy thing is 
the private goodness upon which the attention of our pupils 
has been traditionally fixed !

CHAPTER VI 
THE FIRST ESSENTIALS OF AN EDUCATIONAL 
PLAN 
We have seen that the social idealism of Christianity pre- 
scribes for religious education as an ultimate goal the trans- 
formation of a social order that is largely unjust into one that 
shall be wholly just, and that, consequently, religious educa- 
tion must enter directly, not merely by distant implication, 
into the social struggles of the present. Let us now see how this 
large purpose can become a guiding principle for determining 
the main essentials of an educational plan. It is hardly 
necessary to argue again that to socialize the group we must 
individualize the pupils, that is, lead each one to adopt justice 
as his very own desire, purpose, and practice. This involves 
four aspects of religious growth, and provision therefor. 
I. Provision for growth in knowledge of the Christian 
ideal, and of the means and methods whereby it is gradually 
securing control of social forces. ‘The function of the curric- 
ulum maker is to select and systematize such knowledge; 
the function of the text-book maker is to prepare it in some 
detail with reference to the established principles of the learn- 
ing process; the function of the teacher is to effect the assimila- 
tion of this material by particular pupils with their individual 
capacities and needs. The whole may be called instruction. 
(1) The aim of instruction is not to impose truth but to pro- 
mote growth. The whole teaching enterprise is to be brought 
under the notion of growth—of vital, not mechanical proc- 
esses. Hence the term “instruction” must be emptied of its 
traditional implication of telling pupils what to believe. To 
impose our beliefs upon a child, even though the beliefs be 
64 
   
-P-A-G-E-77
  THE FIRST ESSENTIALS 65 
utterly true, is not to promote the growth of a free personality— 
it may even be an invasion of personality; it may subject one 
individual to another instead of emancipating each and every 
one into full membership in a self-governing society, the de- 
mocracy of God. 
To argue that we already possess the truth, since it has been 
revealed, and that therefore we ought to impose beliefs upon 
children, betrays an interesting confusion. The elements 
with which the argument deals are three: The truth, the pupil, 
and the teacher who is supposed to bring these two together. 
What, now, if the teacher is unable to eliminate himself from the 
finished product? What if the teacher comes between the 
pupil’s mind and the truth, and stays there? This, in fact, 
does happen when the attempt to impose beliefs is most success- 
ful. When pupils are tractable, what is the authority to which 
they submit—what is it, that is, from their own point of view? 
It is the Sunday-school teacher, the pastor, the text-book, or 
tradition in the form of hearsay. Even if we train the pupil 
to say sincerely that it is the Pope, the church, or the Bible to 
which he submits, this say-so of his is our own handiwork; 
we have interposed ourselves between the pupil and reality, 
and we have no guarantee that the truth becomes his own 
possession. 
The whole notion of transferring ready-made thoughts to the 
mind of another is psychologically fallacious. When a pupil 
trustingly repeats our formule after us, and even when he 
sincerely believes that he grasps and holds as his own the truth 
that the formule represent, what really happens is that he is 
moved by social forces to conform to the group that surrounds 
him and to separate himself by pseudoknowledge from other 
men. What we have here is neither knowledge nor belief in 
any vital sense, but partisanship. This kind of instruction in 
childhood produces not only in Catholicism but also in Prot- 
estantism an easily recognized adult type, the man who settles. 
historical and scientific questions without historical or scientific: 
study, and by the results judges whether his neighbors are sheep 
or goats.
-P-A-G-E-78
66 THE FIRST ESSENTIALS 
(2) What is gradation of material? ‘The essence of instruc- 
tion is promotion of genuine thinking. Consequently the con- 
tent of instruction should change with the pupil’s growing 
capacity for thought. Here is the foundation for gradation 
of material as an unescapable necessity of good teaching. 
The principle goes deeper than is realized even by many who 
insist upon it. From the history of religious instruction a 
ladder like the following might be constructed: First, a fixed 
and formulated body of doctrine or of ritualistic forms is 
drilled into the pupil’s memory. Second, in order to secure 
some adaptation to the pupil, the language is simplified, or the 
formula is abbreviated. Third, still further to help the pupil 
to understand this material, stories, pictures, and analogies are 
introduced from outside. Fourth, when the fallacy of the 
attempt to transfer a whole system of doctrine to child minds 
becomes unbearably clear, the next move is to select from this 
system, or from the Scripture, or from ecclesiastical history, 
traditions, and usages, the parts that seem likely to have the 
greatest inherent interest for children of each grade, so that a 
part of theSsystem may be transferred at one age, a part 
at another, and in due time the whole. Fifth, when the re- 
ligious growth of the pupil as distinguished from the transfer 
of a system comes to be accepted as the proper aim of in- 
struction, a curriculum is constructed by picking out from 
the same presupposed body of doctrine, history, sacred story, 
and church usages the parts best adapted to help pupils live 
religiously on their own level at the different periods of growth. 
Many teachers have believed that here at last the principle 
of gradation is completely in control. But is not the ancient 
fallacy still here in the limitation of the sources when the ma- 
terial of instruction is drawn? When we have made clear 
to ourselves what sort of world the Father and we as his chil- 
dren desire, must not our next concern be that the young 
also should desire it? What boots it if they know all Scripture, 
all doctrine, all church history, and church usages, if they have 
not both the forward look and the sort of desire that can re- 
construct a world? What the pupil needs to adjust himself 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
THE FIRST ESSENTIALS 67 
to is not anything as it has been, but something as it ought to 
be. Let the curriculum be drawn from any sort of material— 
Scripture, history, church life and enterprise, the world of the 
pupil’s present experience and of his imagination—anything 
that will most surely and rapidly make him share in the Father’s 
desire and labor for society. At each point in the child’s grow- 
ing experience, the essential question is: What in all the world is 
most likely, if we turn his attention to it, to increase his active, 
intelligent devotion to the Christian purpose? 
(3) The sources of material for Christian instruction. Two 
sorts of knowledge are central in Christian instruction, knowl- 
edge of what the Christian purpose is, and of means and methods 
for making it prevail. The Scriptures are to be used as a means 
to this end, not as an end in themselves, and we must not as- 
sume in advance that they contain everything that is needful 
for this vital sort of graded instruction. As a matter of fact, 
they do not. We might guess as much from the simple consider- 
ation that nearly all parts of the Bible were written with adults 
and their problems in mind. But the limitation goes deeper 
than this. Every biblical writing reflects, to a greater or less 
extent, the social presuppositions of its own age) presupposi- 
tions that have to be examined, criticised, and revised. Ele- 
ments of our own social problems we do find there, indeed, and 
they are highly instructive, as the land problem, for example. 
But if we would master the fresh perplexities that have come 
with the advent of popular government and machine manu- 
facture, and if we would press toward a democracy of God, we 
must turn the attention of pupils to many matters that are this 
side of the biblical horizon. 
The notion that the Bible contains everything that is needed 
in Christian instruction is sometimes supported by the asser- 
tion that if we loved our neighbors as the Bible tells us to do, 
our whole social problem would be solved. This statement is 
either a paralytic truism or else it is false. If it means that 
love, intelligently exercised by all persons concerned, would 
find a way to cure the ills in question, it is a truism, and it 
is almost as ineffective as the insight that if we could keep all 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 THE FIRST ESSENTIALS 
the cells of everybody’s lungs functioning properly we could 
rid the world of pulmonary tuberculosis. On the other hand, 
if it means that our social ills arise altogether from the fact that 
men who have faced the issue of justice take the side of injus- 
tice, it is false. One of the fundamental reasons why we do 
not love one another more generally and more intelligently is 
that the conditions under which children grow up constitute a 
training in selfishness and in partisanship. We are prevented 
from seeing the real issues, and from getting sufficiently ac- 
quainted with our neighbors to know how capable they and we 
are of disinterested neighborliness. 
What we need is not merely to be advised to love men more 
regardless of conditions, but also to see clearly that we are sup- 
porting social customs and even laws that actually reward self- 
ishness with power and honor. We who would like to love our 
neighbors as ourselves are maintaining systems of social con- 
trol that actually prevent us from doing it. What ails us is not 
merely that we have grown up in ignorance of the Scriptures, 
nor that our hearts are unresponsive to the call of Jesus. How 
many men and women who are well versed in the Scriptures, 
and whose loyalty to the Master is unquestioned, nevertheless 
do not see that Scriptural principles, and particularly the mind 
of the Master, are vitally concerned in the present struggle for 
social justice. A glowing inner life of good will and tender- 
ness and aspiration, a life that feeds daily upon the manna of 
religious history, is of itself no guarantee of the kind of in- 
telligence that is necessary for the reconstruction of the world. 
To produce such intelligence, Christian instruction must turn 
the attention of pupils directly upon economic, political, and 
any other social conditions that contradict the spirit of brother- 
hood, upon successful experiments in social living, and upon 
outreaching ideals and reforms. 
This conception of Christian instruction refinues to separate 
knowledge and belief from the enterprise of living. It assumes 
that intelligence and active desire should be awakened as a single 
experience. Yet this is far from implying any narrow-gauge 
practicality or spiritual fussiness. A social conception of life 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE FIRST ESSENTIALS 69 
has room, as perhaps no other has, for high valuation of art, 
nature, literature, philosophy, and historical forms of doctrine. 
The worth of them all grows from being shared, and because 
the generations are knit together. Everything that can be 
democratically enjoyed without consequences that are undemo- 
cratic belongs within the Christian conception of the life that 
is appropriate to sons of the Highest. “All things are yours.” 
II. Practice in using the tools of the Christian enterprise. 
Just as a child’s social thinking is influenced from infancy by 
his contacts with society, so his actual practices with respect 
to others tend from the beginning to become fixed as a per- 
manent mode of life. Because this practice is constant, there 
is no neutral period during which specific training in social 
enterprises must wait. Planned or unplanned training goes 
on anyhow; the hand is being shaped to some sort of social 
tools. Habits formed now go deep in respect both to what 
they include and to what they exclude. For it is by doing some- 
thing in a given situation that particular elements of it come to 
our attention. Thus it is that we form habits of noticing or 
of not noticing the feelings and interests of others. A habit 
of not noticing is also a habit of not sympathizing. Many an 
amiable man is callous toward one or another class of his fel- 
lows, and impermeable to important humanitarian appeals, 
because in his plastic years he did not acquire the technic of 
seeing and feeling and acting in such matters. 
Nothing in Christian education can be more fundamental, 
therefore, than participation of pupils with one another and with 
their elders in Christian enterprises, that is, enterprises that 
aim at social welfare, social justice, and a world society. Re- 
serving for succeeding chapters various problems of method 
and of organization that are related to this training in the 
use of social tools, let us now guard against possible miscon- 
ceptions of its place in a total view of educational ends. Cau- 
tion is particularly necessary lest “tools” and “practice” be 
thought of as something apart from normal social living, as 
mere preparation for such living. On the contrary, the point 
is that children obtain the best social training by being a real 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
70 THE FIRST ESSENTIALS 
part of the working force of the world. They mature their 
control of tools not by merely handling them or by brandish- 
ing them in the air, but by doing some part of the world’s work. 
We as educators are not to place the child in any invented 
scheme of spiritual gymnastics—things done wholly for the 
sake of the future—but rather, recognizing the vast variety 
and scope of social need, we are to admit even little children 
to partnership with us in the enterprise of meeting it. This 
is the way for them to acquire not only the mechanics of social 
work, but also the intelligence and the trained and sympa- 
thetic perceptions of a mature Christian. What a practical 
absurdity it is that so many church members should make 
their first real acquaintance with philanthropies, social reforms, 
and missions, in mature life, and what wonder is it that inti- 
mate acquaintance under these conditions is so rare? 
Ill. Preparation for a particular place in society, first 
in the family, and second in an occupation. The inclusion 
of domestic and vocational training within religious education 
is necessitated by the fact, already pointed out, that the love 
that is justice demands the whole of a man’s social allegiance. 
To help, in his own sphere, to rebuild society is the life-work of 
every Christian. It is to be foreseen, studied, planned for in 
the true professional spirit, and with the same regard for tech- 
nical proficiency that one looks for in a lawyer, a physician, or 
a mining engineer. 
This is the spirit that should control marriage, family life, 
and the procreation and rearing of children. Domestic life 
is to be governed and tested, not by its contribution to the 
comfort of the individual members as such, but by its actualiza- 
tion of the democracy of God within itself, and then by its 
outgoing influence upon the wider society. Marriage is to be 
specifically prepared for as a calling of God, and the domestic 
habits of both husband and wife are to be lifted above mere 
conventionality, inclination, and happen-so into the sphere of 
defined social service and efficiency. The household labor_of 
women, and the bearing and care of children, are to be treated as 
_& professional, skilled occupation—a sphere for ambition, study,
-P-A-G-E-83
THE FIRST ESSENTIALS 71 
and social recognition. That women who devote them- 
selves to these duties have at present so scanty recognition as 
producers, being regarded as dependents upon their husbands, 
or as being supported by the industry of another, is a partial 
indication of the reconstructive work that has to be done by 
education. 
It is no new thing to think of all legitimate occupations as 
so many spheres for the service of God. But one does not serve 
God in one’s occupation any further than one serves human 
society. God does not require to be fed and clothed; the only 
thing that we can do for him that he cannot do for himself is 
to be brothers one to another. Every occupation is to be 
transformed into a specialized method of an effective brother- 
hood, and to this end a proper part of every occupation is to 
help in improving the social standards, including the laws, that 
apply to it. Our religion dissents profoundly from the world’s 
generally accepted standards. If we were half awake to the 
radical character of this dissent, we should not accept the cur- 
rent assumption that vocational studies concern simply the 
methods of getting certain things done; instead, we should insist 
that analysis of the human relations involved in any occupa- 
tion is the fundamental vocational study. Until such analysis 
is included in our systems of general and vocational education, 
the churches should themselves provide it for the children and 
young people who are committed to their care. In and through 
such analysis we can hope to develop a Christian vocational 
purpose, the purpose to use one’s particular position in the social 
and economic complex as a fulcrum for moving this complex 
itself toward the level of brotherhood. 
IV. Growth in social motives. Our discussion of knowl- 
edge, practice, and vocational preparation has already included 
the notion that all along the line of advance there should be a 
growing socialization of the inner life of desire. Growth in 
motives is now set down as a fourth phase of growth, not be- 
cause it is separate or separable from these three, but because 
it requires special attention. It requires attention in the first 
place because existing religious education does to a consider- 
   
-P-A-G-E-84
  72 THE FIRST ESSENTIALS 
able extent assume a separation between motive on the one 
hand, and on the other hand knowledge and practical activities. 
What is the ordinary meaning of loving God, or of accepting 
Christ, or of entire consecration? Are they not presented as 
if they could take place in a social vacuum, and as if the char- 
acter of God, of Christ, and of oneself required no reference to 
concrete brotherhood? Is it not true that children and young 
people are being taught to “get right with God” first, and be 
social-minded afterward ? 
The result of such efforts to produce an inner life, or Chris- 
tian motive, as something per se we behold in a multitude of 
church members who mean well but do not know what “well” 
means; who intend to be loyal to Christ but do not realize to 
what he is loyal; who sincerely desire the triumph of right but 
leave social technic to those who have individualistic interests 
to serve by it. We shall overcome these things, which are a 
reproach to us, only when, accepting in simple literalness our 
ancient doctrine that the supreme revelation of God is one with 
the supreme revelation of man, we teach the young that to 
know God we must be socially intelligent, that to make his will 
our own is a matter of social practice, and that entire consecra- 
tion is a strictly vocational concept. 
Another reason why motives require specific attention is 
that growth in motives is a relatively neglected notion. We 
must make clear both that change is normal and in what a 
normal change consists. Here again we are dealing with the 
forward, not the backward, look. What distinguishes a motive 
from a merely instinctive impulse is just looking ahead. A 
motive is anything in a contemplated, not yet actualized, situa- 
tion that renders it attractive and thus stimulates us to make it 
actual. The good heart is nothing esoteric, nothing merely 
inner; it can always be defined objectively in terms of that 
upon which we are actually expending our energy and our 
resources. Growth in Christian motives means, therefore, 
changes in the pupil’s outlook toward future social good. It 
means finer discrimination between relative values, and be- 
tween ends and means, and corresponding change in fineness 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
THE FIRST ESSENTIALS 73 
and breadth of appreciation, which is the beginning of fine 
and broad social conduct. 
This is the inner life that is to be cultivated; this is “ growth 
in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus 
Christ.” To this end is Christian self-discipline. To this 
end also is culture of the devotional life, whether in public 
worship or in private meditation and prayer. That we may 
be conformed to the social will of God, and enjoy being con- 
formed to it—this is the purpose and meaning of devotional 
exercises of all sorts. This does not mean substituting human 
society for fellowship with God, but rather finding God where he 
himself is pleased to dwell. Where shall the child find the 
Father? Wherever the child’s desire goes out after the things 
that the Father loves, that is, the persons who are the supreme 
objects of divine solicitude. There can be no purely private 
relation to God, for our very selfhood is conjunct. We are made 
selves by a give-and-take with others—and we are made in his 
image. 
1 This brief statement must suffice until we reach Chapter XIV. 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
  CHAPTER VII 
THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS IS RELIGIOUS 
EXPERIENCE 
Why do some persons deny that religion can be taught? 
In some types of Protestantism the following remarkable 
anomaly is to be found: Insistence upon religious teaching for 
the young, but denial that religion can be taught. The argu- 
ment for religious teaching runs to the effect that the impres- 
sionable, plastic years of childhood and youth are of crucial 
importance for adult character. The argument against the 
possibility of teaching religion bases itself upon the assertion 
that real religion, at least in the fully Christian sense, is an 
inner, intimately personal, and therefore incommunicable 
experience. The attempt to teach religion simmers down, 
according to this view, to teaching abou religion. 
That the two elements of this view have not been recon- 
ciled in practice will appear from the next section. How, in- 
deed, can one produce an educational system when in the same 
breath one asserts and yet denies the efficacy of teaching? 
Let us ask, then, how any Christian thought could manceuvre 
itself into this corner. ‘The answer is twofold: 
(1) Because they endeavor to hold at the same time to a vital or 
experiential view of the Christian life, and a dogmatic-intellectual- 
istic view of the Christian revelation. If the Christian revela- 
tion consists in certain dogmas, then the Christian life should 
consist in the intellectual act of learning and holding the dog- 
mas. In this case Christian education would be identical with 
intellectualistic instruction. But if, on the contrary, the 
Christian revelation is “made flesh,” if it is a concrete life that 
inspires and renews our life, then to be a Christian would be 
74 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE PROCESS 75 
something far more vital, and Christian education, instead of 
being instruction about dogmas, would be an initiation into 
actual living upon the plane of the Christian purpose. 
But what will be one’s view of Christian education if one 
holds at the same time to an intellectualistic view of revelation 
and an experiential view of the Christian life? What has 
actually happened in this case is this: Education has been 
viewed as essentially a means of transmitting dogmas; but, 
since even the devils can believe and still be devils (as we are 
often assured), it has been insistently claimed that religion 
cannot be taught. And indeed vital religion does not and can- 
not get into education through dogmatic-intellectualistic as- 
sumptions as to God’s approach to man. The language that 
is attributed to God is not that which the child’s heart speaks; 
the problems that are raised are those of the theologian, not 
of the child, and, besides, the whole is finished, fixed, rigid, while 
the child is all movement, all becoming. 
Yet many who hold to a dogmatic view of revelation insist 
upon an experiential or vital view of the Christian life. They 
cannot be blind, of course, to the significance of childhood 
plasticity for such a life. But, having committed themselves 
to a dogmatic type of religious education, they deny that re- 
ligion can be taught, and then they flounder in search of some 
method for religiously influencing children. All the inconsis- 
tency and all the floundering could be avoided by a whole- 
hearted acceptance of the idea that God’s revelation of himself 
is always in the form of flesh; that it is in Jesus, and in every 
human will that follows him. One could then look upon a 
child’s gradual achieving of the full Christian purpose as itself 
a growing communion with God, a gradual self-impartation of 
God to his beloved child. The educational process would then 
fuse with Christian experience. 
(2) Asecond reason for this educational anomaly is that 
this type of thought, though rt holds that religious living includes 
both relations to God and relations to men, does not fuse the two as 
Jesus did. If we can hold that the love that is toward God 
and the love that is toward men are not two, but one, and that 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  76 THE PROCESS 
this one is communion with the Father, then the social unfolding 
of a child can be luminous with divine meaning. There is 
then no antithesis between the socializing of the will and 
Christian experience. God speaks to the child, and the child 
to God in a language that both understand. But if we hold 
that one’s primary relation to God is purely private, that it has 
to do with subjective mysteries, and that only through a pre- 
liminary grasp of these mysteries is one prepared for truly 
Christian social relations, then indeed religion cannot be taught. 
Consequences of the doctrine that “religion is caught, 
not taught.” The attempt to teach religion at the same 
time that the possibility of teaching it is denied leads quite 
naturally to dualism in practice. 
(1) Unsteadiness of aim prevails, and consequent failure to 
set up definite standards. If we ask what the purpose of a 
Sunday school is, we are told that the purpose is to teach 
the Bible. But if we point out that those who avow this as 
their purpose do not teach the Bible with any thoroughness at 
all, the ground is shifted. We are now told that the purpose 
is to mould the character of the pupil by placing him directly 
under Christian influences for an hour and a half every Sun- 
day. If we go on to ask why these influences have not been 
systematized, and why recognizable standards and tests of 
their efficiency have not been set up, we are reminded that 
religion is caught, not taught! 
The virtue of this epigram is missed by some who are fond of 
using it. It is, or should be, a drive at intellectualism, or at 
the identification of instruction with education. When it is 
used to discredit system, and standards, and tests, in the 
Christward guidance of the child’s social experience, it becomes 
an arrow shot at the goose that lays the golden eggs. It is 
true that many a teacher untrained in methods, and making 
many a blunder in methods, has nevertheless had a profoundly 
educative influence upon his pupils. Shall we not assume that 
his success is due to the fact that he really conformed, though 
without realizing it, to fundamental laws of religious growth? 
Surely the life of the spirit is a realm of order, not a chaos of 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
      THE PROCESS    77 
forces. Why, then, do we not analyze the ways of teachers who 
succeed, whether with or without training, to the end that we 
may systematize the principles of their success, and thus show 
others how to succeed? In other words, the laws that underlie 
effective religious education are identical with the laws of spirit- 
ual growth. Therefore a wabbly scheme of religious education 
justifies a query as to the views of religion that underlie it. 
(2) Interruptions of the educative process are tolerated, and even 
regarded as normal. Any one who will take the trouble to 
analyze the experience of a pupil minute by minute through one 
session of an ordinary Sunday school can know for himself how 
constantly non-educative procedures mix with education. 
The opening exercises are a jumble of worship, business, and 
drill. If we ask why these exercises should be held at all, 
we may be told that the children should learn to worship. 
But if we examine the program and method, we find only a 
feeble grasp, or none at all, of the idea of education in and 
through worship. ‘The aims of the worship are indefinite, and 
both content and method are unsystematized, unadapted, and 
untested. Besides, the setting of worship—the way it is el- 
bowed by business, speechmaking (sometimes from visitors 
who can only guess what the situation demands), and crude 
disciplinary measures (banging of bells, calls for order, shouting 
above the din, scolding)—this setting is not strongly suggestive 
of a growing sense of the presence of God. And this sort of 
thing in the opening and the closing exercises occupies the 
major part of the meagre time at the disposal of the school. 
The lesson period, during which educative procedures are sup- 
posed to be entirely in control, is pared down to a minimum. 
Not only so; even this minimum is reduced through interrup- 
tions by secretaries, through encroachments of prolonged open- 
ing exercises, and through the demands of anniversaries and 
“special occasions.” 
Nor do interruptions of educational procedures end even 
here. Irruptions of child evangelism occur in various forms, 
from exhortations by preachers or teachers, through high- 
pressure “decision days’’ that are not integrated into the gen-
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 THE PROCESS 
eral educational work of the school, to mass-meetings of chil- 
dren conducted by itinerant evangelists over whom the educa- 
tional authorities of the school have no control. All this gives 
one an impression that “getting religion” is independent of 
religious education, and it leads one to wonder what, then, 
religious education is supposed to be and to do. 
The roots of these incongruities are doubtless manifold. 
We must of course give religious education time to grow up, 
and we must not make its immaturity an occasion for bela- 
boring the faithful men and women, mostly laymen without 
opportunity for technical training, who are giving the best 
that they have to the children. All honor to the workers in 
our Sunday schools! Here is massed together such an amount 
of Christian consecration, such an amount of unrequited 
labor for others, as was never before seen in the history of our 
religion. Our present question concerns the effective organiza- 
tion of this enormous energy. We need to know whether it is 
being scattered, or misdirected, or thwarted by inconsistency 
of plan and method. If so, we must know why. The conclu- 
sion that we have reached is that there is vast leakage of energy, 
enormous waste of consecrated labor, because so many persons, 
believing that “religion is caught, not taught,” counteract 
their own efforts to teach religion. 
(3) A third consequence of the doctrine that “religion is caught, 
not taught” 1s unfairness to teachers. If religion is to be spread 
among the young solely by a process of infection, it follows, of 
course, that the one thing needful is to bring the pupil within 
the area of a teacher’s personal influence. That a profound 
educational conception lies hidden in the notion of spiritual 
life as communicated from person to person by fellowship will 
appear from our next section. But dim vision of a great truth 
may give it the effect of a half-truth, and half-truths have re- 
markable power to hurt as well as to heal. The current em- 
phasis upon the teacher’s personality is a case in point. How 
often do we hear that the success of a given teacher is due to a 
“natural gift for teaching,” or to an attractive personality, 
or to intense consecration. If we should take this at its face 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
THE PROCESS 79 
value, what ugly implications it would carry with respect to 
the rank and file of earnest teachers who do not have success of 
the shining sort that brings out such remarks. Because certain 
persons have stumbled upon methods that succeed, we praise 
their personalities; because the stumbling of others has not 
turned out quite as happily, we put them in an inferior class. 
Yet within this class we shall find, if we look for it, the capacity 
to succeed if only the requirements of the work in hand can be 
pointed out clearly. Here are Christian character, zeal, faith- 
fulness, intelligence; what right have we to discount them? 
Granted the presence of these qualities, with no positively 
counteracting twist, we ought to be able to say: “We will 
show you how to succeed, and we will provide the remaining 
conditions of success.” 
(4) A fourth consequence is inertia in the matter of teacher- 
training. ‘There are several reasons why the training of Sunday- 
school teachers has been so halting an affair. We shall have 
occasion after a time to analyze the complications that are 
involved. But, running through the whole, at least in certain 
quarters, is the silent, counteracting, anesthetizing vapor of 
an educational scepticism that supposes itself to be religious 
faith. If such scepticism were not abroad, and deep seated, 
how could so many pastors give religious education only a 
secondary place, or worse, in their plans for pastoral adminis- 
tration, and how could they abandon teacher-training to the 
chance that somebody else will see its importance and do some- 
thing about it? To correct this educational scepticism we must 
proclaim not only laws of psychology, but also laws of Christian 
life and experience. We must think of Christian living neither 
in terms of a dogmatic system nor in terms of an esoteric and 
incommunicable salvation, but in terms of objective social 
relations that produce and are produced by the individually 
realized attitude and purpose called love. From this point of 
view we shall be able to see that Christian education falls under 
the head of promoting a life of deliberate purpose, a life that 
fulfils itself by methods that it itself can objectively view, 
analyze, and systematically control. How readily the elements 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 THE PROCESS 
of the educative process fall into place, and form a unified whole, 
under this conception we shall now see. 
The central fact of the educative process is a growing 
Christian experience in and through the pupil’s social 
interactions. If we really believe that “where love is, God 
is,’ and if by love we understand, as Jesus did, not a mere 
sentiment or impulse, but a purpose, a policy for self-guidance, 
a thing that does not evaporate as soon as one turns deliberate 
attention to it, then we can have a religious education that 
moves entirely within religion. It will consist fundamentally 
in providing for children conditions in which love is experi- 
enced, practised, wrought into steady and deliberate living by 
the help of both intellectual analysis and habit formation, and 
developed into a faith that illumines the crises and the mysteries 
of life. ‘To speak more in detail, such education will include 
the following part processes: 
(1) Making the pupil acquainted with persons who really 
love him and others also. The first thing in Christian education 
is not an idea, but a personal fellowship. Here is the truth that 
is confusedly contained in the current emphasis upon the person- 
ality of the teacher. The confusion lies in the substitution of 
personal attachment between pupil and teacher for attachment 
of the pupil to society through the teacher. The importance 
of the acquaintance depends upon the degree to which the 
pupil realizes that the love that the teacher has for him is not a 
merely individual attachment, and that the joy of it is all the 
richer because others have a share in it. We merely express 
this in another way if we say that the first and fundamental 
element in the Christian educative process is the introduction 
of the pupil to the specific happiness of being a member of a 
society. Here lies the measureless potentiality of the family 
as an agency of Christian education. Here, as we shall see, is 
the base-line for a theory of the church as educator. In the 
detailed work of religious teaching, the principle is already 
beginning to appear in such practices as these: The teacher of 
a new class of beginners undertakes as her first task to make 
the little children happily acquainted both with her and with 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  THE PROCESS 81 
one another; the principle of the organized Sunday-school 
class is moving downward from the adult and senior divisions 
through the whole school, effort being made to cause each class 
to feel itself as a little society, even though there be no formal 
constitution or by-laws; and effort is being made, by many en- 
richments of social joy, to obliterate the break between the 
social grouping on Sunday and that of week-days. 
(2) As far as any pupil finds satisfaction or what seems to 
him to be real life in such sharing, he experiences what is fun- 
damental in the divine purpose—he has, to this extent, a Chris- 
tian experience. But Christian education undertakes to de- 
velop this experience from such rudimentary beginnings into 
the full and large purpose of the democracy of God. There- 
fore, the next part process may be stated as causing the pupil’s 
social attachments to expand from narrower to wider groups. 
Family loyalties must be merged into humane interests of the 
widest scope. The social consciousness of a Sunday-school 
class must enlarge into a school consciousness, and this into a 
church consciousness; and the whole must flow outward toward 
the whole needy world. 
(3) This outgoing purpose can be fulfilled only by an expand- 
ing series of social activities. One’s social status, in the Chris- 
tian sense of “social status,’”’ becomes a firmly accomplished 
fact only by repeated social acts that become social habits. 
Social character means nothing less than arriving at a point 
where social conduct occurs as a matter of course. Likewise, 
the exodus from a lesser to a greater group consciousness is 
effected not merely by fresh sympathies but also by fresh acts 
out of which habits can grow. Enlargement of social conscious- 
ness does not have to precede, but to be developed in and 
through, enlarging co-operation in serious social undertakings. 
It would be a happy circumstance if the term “curriculum” 
could be understood to mean not merely an orderly succession 
of ideas or knowledges appropriate to the pupil’s expanding 
experience, but also an orderly succession of enterprises in 
and through which social appreciation, social habits, and social 
loyalties may grow into the full stature of the Christian’s faith. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  $2 THE PROCESS 
Religious education moved a step in this direction when occa- 
sional, unsystematized talks about missions, and appeals for 
missionary contributions, gave way to definite missionary 
enterprises and specific contacts with particular missionaries 
and missionary fields by a school or by a class. The movement 
is now proceeding much further by including works of mercy 
and help within the regular program of each class. Here and 
there an older class has adopted a program of investigation 
and of labor for community betterment. These are signs of 
mighty import for the future of religious education. They are 
the rosy fingers of dawn opening the portals of day. 
(4) Within this practice in loving we find the basis for a most 
vital theory of Christian instruction. For now, instead of at- 
tempting to transfer to the child mind certain truths that we 
hope will enter into his experience in a vital manner at some 
indefinite future time, we help him to define, understand, and 
improve something that he is already doing and enjoying. There 
is no longer the deadly separation of knowing from doing, or 
of Christian doctrine from Christian experience. The function 
of instruction now becomes this: To assist the child to analyze 
the situations, purposes, and activities with which he has to do, 
so that impulsive goodness shall grow into a deliberate good 
will; so that the sphere of the good will shall be better and better 
understood; so that co-operation in social causes shall be 
organized on a wider and wider scale and with ever-increasing 
efficiency, and so that all the resources of a cultivated spirit 
may be known and made available for all. 
This is not a narrower or less intellectual conception of Chris- 
tian instruction than the one that takes its starting-point 
from the dogmatic-intellectualistic notion of divine revelation. 
Stimulus for intellectual activity is here, and the interest to 
which appeal is made is as broad as the Christian ideal itself. 
Anything in history, literature, or doctrine that actually illumi- 
nates the path of active love, any kind of knowledge that can 
be turned into power for social living, anything that imagina- 
tion or discursive reason can contribute to thoroughly socialized 
satisfactions—all this belongs within Christian instruction under 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE PROCESS 83 
the social presuppositions that we have adopted. We extrude 
intellectualism, but not intellect. A mere pitter-patter of 
imposed activities would not meet this standard any better 
than a pitter-patter of imposed dogmatic formule or of memo- 
rized fragments of Scripture. In short, the Christian law of 
active, world-wide love is the foundation of Christian instruc- 
tion as well as of Christian conduct, the foundation not only 
for selecting material, but also for grading it, the foundation 
likewise of the pupil’s interest in it. 
(5) Finally, this education in the-art of brotherhood contains 
within itself the most vital of all possible methods of evoking faith 
an a fatherly God and in a human destiny that outreaches all the 
accidents of our frailty. Let it be freely granted that less social 
methods of education can induce children, and men also, to 
confess without a shadow of insincerity a belief in God and in 
the life everlasting, and even that beliefs thus acquired may 
grow, and deepen, and enter creatively into conduct. To say 
that there is a still more vital way is not the same as saying that 
all ways except one are bad. Our practical concern, however, 
is not merely to produce sincere belief in God and immortality, 
but to make our pupils yearn for God and for the complete 
triumph of his social desire. In our capacity for loving, which 
is the same as our capacity to desire complete justice, lies the 
possibility of a faith that is not merely an intellectual ante- 
chamber of the divine presence, but a faith that is one with 
divine fellowship itself. In the spirit of the writer of the First 
Epistle of John, which is the spirit of Jesus also, we may frankly 
question whether it is important to cultivate in the young any 
belief in God that can coexist in the same person with deafness 
to the human cry. Is not any such belief actually dangerous 
to society? History shows that belief in God may be used to 
sanctify and strengthen unjust social ordinances and authorities, 
and that from this possibility even belief that sincerely regards 
itself as Christian is by no means exempt. 
If it be possible thus to fuse love and faith, so that even in 
childhood the voice of God and the voice of human need shall 
be one voice, this is the path that religious education should by 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 THE PROCESS 
all means choose. It is possible. As Mrs. Mumford’s experi- 
ments show,! the small child’s first prayer can be a genuinely 
social reaction, and he can be led directly forward in the identi- 
fication of his fellowship with God with his fellowship with 
men. In a considerable number of Sunday schools the social 
approach to God already begins to control the teaching about 
him. A child compared two Sunday schools as follows: “In 
that one they teach you all about God; in this one they teach 
you to help God.” We are still in the beginnings of such in- 
struction, of course, and much experimentation, with many 
blunders, is still before us. But the way ought by this time 
to be known. It is the way of love, which is the whole law, not 
only of the deeds that are worth doing, but also of the beliefs 
that are worth holding. In religious education as elsewhere 
love never faileth, and in the triunity of faith, hope, and love, 
it is supreme.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE CHURCH AS EDUCATOR 
The religious dependence of the individual. In all our 
common human interests that which the individual achieves 
and that which society contributes to him are inextricably 
intertwined. They are more than intertwined; the relation 
is like that of a leaf to the trunk of the tree that bears it. We 
see this clearly in the political attitudes of a free citizen; how- 
ever free may be his thinking, his convictions are a result of his- 
torical processes and of association with some existing group. 
This is not less true of religion, which is historically an affair 
of groups—tribes, nations, churches, and parties—and of drifts 
within and without the churches. Our religious progressives, 
mugwumps, indifferentists, and even secularists, as well as the 
conservatives and reactionaries, are incarnations of group 
sentiments. Even the self-made man obtains material and 
design to a large extent from the social medium in which he 
moves. 
No church is made up of men and women who belong to it 
simply because of their individually reasoned-out convictions. 
No; a church makes its members more than the members 
make the church. This fact—the infusion of social sap in what 
we nevertheless rightly call individual—is the net remainder 
of the medizval realistic notion that the church is the prius of 
its- members, or the eternal “form” of which they are the 
“matter.” Here is authority in its inevitable actuality; rea- 
soned or unreasoned, intended or unintended, it is here by 
virtue of the fact that men move in groups. But, as we shall 
see, this does not imply that one part of a group must be pas- 
sively moulded by another part. 
85 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 THE CHURCH 
The church considered as an instance of “ social hered- 
ity.” The term “social heredity” has been invented to desig- 
nate the fact that acquired characters of a mental sort are 
passed on from generation to generation without any necessary 
dependence upon our prevision or planning.t They are not 
transmitted in the procreative process, of course, but by non- 
deliberative mental processes of which suggestion is the type. 
Thus it is that numberless modes of action, feeling, and thought 
that have the appearance of being instinctive, or self-evident, 
are in reality matters of habit. Our sense of propriety as to 
this or that, our conscientious feelings as to this or that con- 
duct, a mass of preferences that seem to be almost as inevi- 
table as gravitation, a large proportion of the things that we 
regard either as self-evident or as absurd, might have been other- 
wise; they are otherwise in other times and among other peo- 
ples. However they got started, they continue from genera- 
tion to generation by reason of continuous pressure from the 
set ways of older persons upon the plastic minds of the young.’ 
Our social inheritance includes a vast number of man-ways, 
from the merest trifles to the most momentous concerns of 
peoples and of humanity itself. Satire has found its happy 
hunting-ground in our subservience to conventions. Who but 
a very inferior, or else a very exalted, person, male or female, 
dares to dress as comfort and common sense dictate? The 
starched collars that plague my neck are a yoke of servitude; 
I would put them away if I were strong enough. And I would 
emancipate myself from stiff head-gear, and from coats during 
the torrid days of summer, and instead of limiting myself to 
the sombre colors of conventional male attire, I would learn 
color schemes from leaves and blossoms, from sea, sky, and 
cloud, from sunrises and rainbows—if I dared! | 
1J. M. Baldwin, Social and Ethical Interpretations (1906), chap. II, and 
Appendix A. There are disadvantages in the use of “heredity’’ in any but a 
strictly physiological sense, but I permit myself the liberty because a specific 
term is needed, and no better one has been suggested. 
2The manner in which things-as-they-are tend to become presuppositions 
of our thought as to how they ought to be is well illustrated by this incident: 
A gentleman who resides in a state that has recently granted the franchise to 
women remarked: ‘‘Now that we have actually seen women voting, it seems 
natural enough, and the wonder is that we ever thought otherwise !"’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
THE CHURCH 87 
Our religious convictions, whether they are true or not, and 
even our passionate aspirations, arise within us and become 
fixed as the meaning of life for us very largely because there 
are churches. A church is an educational institution primarily 
because of this kind of fact, because, in short, by its very pres- 
ence, it produces so largely the presuppositions of social think- 
ing, and maintains a great body of standards that are taken 
for granted. 
The interplay of social purpose with social suggestion 
inthe churches. The fact that “what is” thus easily and spon- 
taneously transforms itself in our minds into “what ought to 
be,” or at least into “what is natural,” gives rise to the need 
for some provision for an ever-recurring re-examination of stand- 
ards, with resultant revision and freshening of life’s enterprise. 
Convention, institutionalism, and vested interests are always 
ready, in religion as elsewhere, to suffocate the spirit as well 
as to serve it. The church of the spirit must therefore provide 
means and measures for continual spiritual renewal at the sources 
of spiritual life. To education in the non-technical sense of 
transmission of standards by suggestion, must be added educa- 
tion in the technical sense of deliberate choice of what shall be 
transmitted, and systematic procedures for securing effective 
transmission. But this involves, as a phase of the church’s 
educational vocation, ever-repeated re-examination of her own 
conduct. 
It is easy to deceive ourselves as to what the church is doing 
with the young. Because we put edifying words into a text- 
book or into the mouths of teachers, we imagine that we are 
putting the whole weight of the church upon the side of ideal 
goodness. Not so! What the church ts—to paraphrase 
Emerson’s epigram—speaks so loudly that the young do not 
hear what the church says. Social assumptions that are un- 
expressed in words but lived out in conduct modify and inter- 
pret every ethical formula. When we who pray to God as 
Father, and call humanity a family, and exalt the idea of ser- 
vice, nevertheless take unprotesting comfort in the anti- 
domestic, unbrotherly, caste-like inequalities of opportunity 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 THE CHURCH 
that prevail in the world, then, however unconscious we may be 
of compromising our religion, we actually become teachers of 
an anti-Christian ethic. A teacher of a Sunday-school class 
of self-supporting young women said: “Many of my working 
girls do not grasp the ideal of the Consumers League, for they 
have never consciously known persons who sacrificed their own 
comfort in commercial transactions that persons less fortunate 
with whom they were unacquainted might be benefited.”’ 
Therefore the church’s conscious selection of what is to be 
presented to the young ought to extend beyond and below all 
lesson material, all school activities, and all devotional exer- 
cises, even to the social setting of the whole in our present life. 
If the social setting of Sunday-school experience produces in the 
pupil no sense of a social contrast between the church and the 
world, no awareness that there is going on within the church 
the self-criticism through which alone it can emancipate itself 
from its limited sociality, no realization that church life means 
per se agonizing for a better social order, then the church it- 
self becomes an agency for perpetuating the unbrotherliness 
that its words condemn. There is even a possibility—a cer- 
tainty, rather—that individuals, if not whole ecclesiastical 
groups, will attach a divine sanctity to civil laws and social 
incrustations that actually hinder the love that is justice. 
The church as a fellowship of old and young. We may 
now go as far as to assert that the church, considered as educa- 
tor, is primarily a fellowship of older and younger persons, 
and that if this fellowship be rich and aspiring it will be educa- 
tionally effective, whatever be the material and the method 
of instruction. Our purpose should be, of course, to make the 
fellowship and the instruction one consistent whole, one move- 
ment toward the same point; but it is well to remind ourselves 
that fellowship on the plane of the social principles of Jesus, 
even if it be joined with defective instruction, has far more 
power to develop actual Christian living in the young than the 
best of instruction can have if it be separated from the living 
word, which is human love in actual operation. 
Thus it comes to pass that church education at its best is an 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
THE CHURCH 89 
initiation into a living fellowship, being in this respect a true 
successor of ancient tribal initiations. But wherein does a 
truly educational fellowship on the Christian plane consist? 
This deserves careful study, for good will can miss its way by 
misunderstanding itself. 
(1) Christian fellowship is, in the first place, “ good-fellow- 
ship,” or having pleasures in common, and heightening them by 
the very fact that they are enjoyed together. Pleasurable experi- 
ences are a fundamentally necessary part of the child’s acquain- 
tance with the church. They are necessary because, since 
satisfaction in any act tends toward the repetition of it, they 
help toward habit formation. Training is most effective when 
it takes place in a pervasive atmosphere of cheer, amiability, 
and happy expectancy. ‘Training in Christian living is most 
effective when its activities include the present sharing of 
pleasures, that is, present Christian living. The happiest expe- 
riences of the young should be found first of all in the family, 
but next in the church. 
(2) Good fellowship in the church is itself a process of Chris- 
tian education ; it ts not to be used as mere bait wherewith to in- 
duce the young to submit to an education that is not to their 
taste. The church has a direct interest, not merely a derived 
one, in play and frolic, in the interplay of the sexes that leads 
up to courtship and marriage, and in the cultivation of acquain- 
tance just because persons as such are worth knowing. There 
are few developments of religious life in modern times as signifi- 
cant as the little-heralded introduction of play into the churches. 
What, a church at play? What would our spiritual fathers 
say to it? Here are Sunday-school baseball-teams, with ref- 
erences thereto from the sacred desk on Sunday! Here are 
cooking-stoves and kitchens in the churches, and club-rooms, 
and gymnasiums, and swimming-tanks! Well, whatever the 
fathers might say, the voice of love declares that wherever and 
however we enrich human fellowship on the simple, democratic 
plane of regard for men as such, we do the will of the Father, 
we bring nearer the world-wide realization of the democracy of 
God. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  90 THE CHURCH 
(3) Christian fellowship, though it start on the plane of a child’s 
fondness for play, must continuously grow into community of 
purposeful labor—community not merely between children, or 
between children and their respective teachers, but between all the 
members of the church group, both old and young. “Come, let us 
live with our children,” said Froebel. We are accustomed to 
apply this to parents and teachers, but it is applicable also to 
any social institution that brings children and adults into 
contact with each other. ‘To live religiously and ecclesiastically 
with the young means to play with them, but it means also to 
let them work with us. It implies that we lay responsibilities 
upon them—real, not imitation responsibilities—that we train 
them in initiative by giving them initiative, and that we de- 
velop their judgment by letting them into the inside of church 
affairs. In many churches there exists a social stratification 
based upon age that works directly against effective training in 
church activities. 
(4) At the risk of repetition let it be said that fellowship with 
the young does not consist in giving gifts, or in providing privileges, 
or in promoting the social happiness of the young as a class by 
itself, or even in promoting good works on the part of such a class. 
These ought we to do, but not to leave the other undone. The 
elder must give themselves to the younger. “I want not yours, 
but you!” is the appeal of young life to maturity. The appeal 
is partly responded to when maturity plays with children and 
youth, but the response is not complete until the experience of 
the child in the church, from the kindergarten age onward, 
includes continuous and growing participation in the most 
serious purposes, labors, and deliberations of the mature mem- 
bers and leaders. - 
(5) All this implies, without doubt, some reversal of traditions. 
In some Protestant quarters children have been expected to 
remain outside the fellowship until some indefinite future. 
Even the formal doctrine that they are within the fellowship 
has not always produced real community life, but rather par- 
ticipation in the symbols of it, or even less than this. Some-

setter of formal lessons, or a judge and rebuker of faults, or a 
regulator of amusements, rather than a coworker. Not seldom 
the young look upon the church as an administrator of mysteries 
that are solemnly remote from social joys. Every one of these 
traditions is anti-educational. ‘To overcome them will require 
one measure in one communion, another in another, according 
to varying ecclesiastical constitutions, laws, and customs. 
(6) Finally, when fellowship of old and young in social joys, in 
purpose, and in labor becomes the basal thing in the educational 
policy of the churches, we shall lay the indispensable corner-stone 
of Christian unity. The disunion within our religion goes far 
deeper than multiplicity of independent administrations, di- 
versity of doctrinal standards, and contrasting modes of wor- 
ship. Nothing less is involved than the fundamental impulses 
and attitudes upon which society itself depends, and specifically 
those upon which alone a democracy of God could possibly be 
built. Do we not lack in all the churches a social purpose so 
profound that young as well as old can appreciate it? For in 
truth that which can produce genuine Christian unity between 
youth and maturity is the fundamentals, such as active desire 
that everybody should have enough to eat, that everybody 
should be protected from disease, that all the sick should be 
cared for, that everybody should have friends, that everybody 
should have opportunity for education and for enjoyment of the 
finest products of the human mind, that children and youth 
should everywhere be protected from vicious influences, that 
war should cease, and that the Father should be able at last to 
look upon human society and say: “ Behold, it is very good !’”4 
It is because we are not ready to unite with children in such 
fundamental, socially reconstructive purposes that we ransack 
history for a basis for Christian union. It is the future, the 
unfulfilled task, the unreserving love of men, the yearning 
1 The capacity of children to appreciate the simple justice that is profound 
has been remarked again and again. A very small boy who was eating the 
inside of his slice of bread, but rejecting the crusts, was told: ‘‘ There are lots 
of little children who would be glad to get as much as a crust of bread. They 
sometimes pick over the refuse in garbage cans in order to obtain food.’’ The 
young thinker, with a worried expression, replied: ‘‘ Why doesn't the Heavenly 
Father give them enough to eat?’’ 
     
-P-A-G-E-104

desire of the Father that all men should be one family; it is 
common objective purpose and labor, that must heal our divi- 
sions. When we have raised a generation or two of church- 
members united with one another in their various denomina- 
tions upon this basis, we shall find the barriers between denomi- 
nations very, very thin. 
The church as a worshipping society. If what has just 
been said leads to the question wherein, then, the church 
differs from any other organization of the good will, and why a 
child needs any social training beyond participation in ordinary 
philanthropies and reforms, the answer is that, in spite of 
shortcomings, the churches, and they only of all our social 
institutions, undertake to accept the radical consequences of 
Jesus’ social idealism. They have adopted—let us say it 
frankly—a point of view that leads to consequences that they 
did not at first foresee, consequences the portent of which even 
now we feel more than we can define. We Christians have a 
sad smile to-day for the simple-mindedness that could believe 
that the missionary task would be essentially completed when 
everybody on earth had been told something. We are beginning 
to face the appalling duty of building a world civilization based 
squarely, uncompromisingly, upon the proposition that all 
men are brothers; and we are beginning to see that our fellow- 
ship with the Father—the whole problem of worship—is tied 
up with our relations to this enterprise. We have, then, 
two aspects of the church as a worshipping society that are of 
the first importance for religious education. 
(1) The peculiar significance of the church as educator is found, 
in the first place, in the comprehensiveness and the radicalness of 
the principle of human fellowship that it professes. Go over in 
your mind all other groups and group activities that aim at 
the betterment of mankind, including the state, the state schools, 
the most social-minded political party that you know, the re- 
form organizations, philanthropic agencies of all kinds, institu- 
tions for research and for teaching, and for zsthetic and social 
enjoyment. What a magnificent array it is! What a tonic 
for our faith in man! No enlightened Christian but thanks 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  
THE CHURCH 93 
God for these forces that are all helping to bring us onward 
toward a real brotherhood. The function of religious education 
with respect to them is to raise up intelligent supporters for every 
effective humanitarian and socializing agency. Yet the fact 
remains that each of these group activities—wisely enough, 
no doubt—declines to contemplate man as man in his total 
need; no one insists upon complete justice, but only upon 
justice in some restricted sphere; every one puts off upon 
somebody else the declaring of what brotherhood in its uncom- 
promising wholeness means; no one proposes the radical deal- 
ing with human nature, the reconstruction of motive, that is 
involved in effective brotherhood; no one goes with men into 
and through the deepest valleys of sorrow and the poignant 
issues of destiny. 
But the churches mean to undertake this. They are, of 
course, beset with human frailty and error, but we criticise 
their defects precisely from the standpoint of their own avowed 
principles. ‘They have in fact taken into their hands a sword 
that pierces their own bosom, and it is their hold upon this 
sword that gives them a peculiar function in social educa- 
tion. The Christ-spirit within us urges us to believe in man to 
the utmost, holding that any human life outweighs all possible 
private profits; to believe in loving to the utmost, and that only 
by losing our lives as merely individual can we have fulness of 
hfe; to believe in the possibility of purifying the motives of 
men until selfishness is really eradicated; to believe that a 
divinely good social order is possible on earth; to believe that the 
apparent defeat of love by death can be swallowed up in a greater 
victory of love, and to be unabashed by the tragedy and the 
mystery before which so many social forces shrink; and in all 
this to remember that we are not going to war at our own 
charges—the charges of our imperfect wisdom, and of the pov- 
erty of our resources—but that the eternal God is herein utter- 
ing in us a love that will not be denied. The churches are called 
by their own avowed principles to carry this social radicalism 
into life. They are to be quick to provide for any unfilled social 
need, but they are also to work within all constructive social 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  
  94 THE CHURCH 
agencies, and to inspire them to believe in brotherhood to the 
utmost, that is, to be as radically social as their respective limi- 
tations permit. This spirit of loving to the uttermost, which 
is likewise the spirit of self-criticism to the uttermost, is the first 
thing that specifically Christian education adds to the other 
agencies of social progress. 
(2) The peculiar significance of the church as educator is found, 
in the second place, in its maintenance of worship of the Father, 
the source and the present inspirer of the love that, because it 
will brook no limits, is so terrifyingly just. There is no break, 
or partition, or point of transition, between the Christian’s 
friendship with men and his friendship with God. Hence the 
significance of common worship. Communion of man with 
man reaches its climax only when the human is felt to contain 
the divine. Emerson called this the experience of “the Over- 
soul.” The continuity of love with worship manifests itself 
variously. Parental and conjugal affection in their purest and 
most elevated self-consciousness feel something of awe, of 
reverence, of fulfilling a mission. Though our formulated faiths 
grow weak, duty goes on speaking to us as “Stern daughter of 
the voice of God.’”’ When our sympathy enters most unre- 
servedly—that is, with the eyes of justice—into the woes of 
the world, then in the very depths of the dark valley there de- 
scend upon us elevation of spirit, illumination of the world 
darkness, a realization of an encompassing One as rejoicing 
within us. 
The common worship of Christians is ideally, and to some 
extent actually, the fostering of this communion, which is at 
once human and divine—most human because it is divine, most 
divine because it is incarnate. When we worship together we 
remind ourselves of this God—our God; we reflect upon his 
goodness, so outgoing, self-giving, all-encompassing, and upon 
the ways in which it has unfolded itself to us, particularly upon 
Jesus; in the light of the goodness of God our pettiness and 
self-centredness are held before us until we repent and set 
about removing the inner obstacles that obstruct the utter- 
ance of divine love through us to our fellows; here, pausing from 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE CHURCH 95 
the multiplicity of affairs to seek a central, organizing principle 
for them all, and lifting our eyes from the particular stitches 
that we have been taking in the flowing garment of divinity 
in order that we may contemplate the garment itself, we find 
meaning, rationality, in our existence; rationality, however, 
not as something static, not as something to be merely gazed 
at and admired, but rationality as direction for our forces, as 
effort that is satisfied to be effort, as labor that asks for no idle- 
ness as its reward, as suffering with and for others that does not 
count itself as loss, as purpose that is large enough. 
Christian worship is thus realization of the democracy of 
God—trealization by imagination, by fresh insights, by recti- 
fication of purposes, by the coincident consciousness of God and 
our fellows—nay, the interfused consciousness of them, the 
consciousness of God as here and now incarnating himself in us 
as a society. When worship is fully Christian it is fellowship 
through and through, fellowship freeing itself from all restraints, 
and therefore continuous with everything in the world that 
makes for brotherhood. 
Such worship has tremendous educational possibilities. They 
are to be realized partly by suggestion in words reinforced by 
music, by architectural beauty, and especially by the presence 
of a whole congregation that is attending to the same things 
and performing outward acts in unison. But both method and 
content of such suggestion need careful scrutiny in order that 
the congregation may be led away from the crowd type of 
consciousness into that of the deliberative group. How is this 
to be done? By ever fresh applications of the ancient Chris- 
tian doctrine that God is made manifest in human life. To 
see life objectively, discriminatingly, and to reflect upon what 
we, with God, want it to be—this is of the essence of Christian 
worship. When we resort to the church to escape from the 
problems and the perplexities of human society, we do not fol- 
low the Christ who ever takes upon himself the form of man, 
ever becomes the servant of man. Worship as escape from this 
degenerates into non-Christian crowd estheticism or else into 
non-Christian clubdom. 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
96 THE CHURCH 
Again, when worship has its centre in priestly manipulation 
of supernatural mysteries, it uses suggestion as an instrument 
for keeping the many obedient to the few, and for repeating 
the past instead of using the past as material wherewith to 
build fairer structures of the spirit of brotherhood. The 
methods of suggestion can be used either to hold children at the 
crowd level, or to produce the sort of pause that leads to reflec- 
tion, and to bring to attention objective material upon which 
a deliberate social will can be formed. In short, true to the 
meaning of incarnation, worship can develop communion with 
God in and through growing social intelligence and growing 
social purpose, as these, conversely, can be developed through 
communion with God.

  CHAPTER IX 
A NEW THEORY OF THE CURRICULUM 
The elements of the problem. At one point and another 
our discussion has already touched upon the curriculum, either 
explicitly, or by way of implication. But not until now have 
all the elements of the problem been before us. Broadly con- 
sidered, the problem to which our discussion has led us is this: 
How to plan a progressive order for the pupil’s social reactions— 
progressive in the sense of moving toward and into the full, 
intelligent, active sociality of Christian maturity. Such a 
plan would constitute a curriculum. 
This social and functional conception of a “course of study” 
is fundamentally at variance with our traditions. Until very 
recently “curriculum” has implied that we formulate a body of 
ideas that we wish to impose upon the pupil, arrange an order 
in which they are to be learned, and plan ways for inducing him 
to attend to them. This, which may be called the “imposition 
theory” of the curriculum, grew out of and expressed the 
individualistic view of salvation, which was at the same time an 
intellectualistic view of the faith that saves. Not that any 
consistency was achieved in practice. Quite the contrary. 
After telling the things that must surely be believed unto salva- 
tion, the teacher still felt and knew that the task of Christianiz- 
ing the heart remained over. Hence the assiduity with which 
“applications”? were appended to every piece of curriculum 
material. Hence also the overemphasis upon the personality 
of the teacher, and the resort to beguilements, persuasions, and 
emotional pressure to induce pupils to be religious, all of which 
testifies to a cleft between curriculum and life. 
The point of view that we have now reached in the present 
discussion bases the very notion of curriculum upon the vital 
97 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 THE CURRICULUM 
reactions that the older scheme merely appended to the course 
of study. The new theory unreservedly accepts the truth that 
out of the heart are the issues of life, and that consequently a 
curriculum is not primarily a systematic set of ideas, but a 
progressive order of motives actually at work, actually fruiting 
here and now. The elements that have to be considered may 
be stated in a chain as follows: 
(a) To help the pupil to experience growing communion with 
God. 
(6) In and through growing human fellowships in the family, 
the church, and elsewhere. 
(c) Fellowship in the act of worship, with the help of music 
and the other arts. 
(¢) And in constructive and remedial social activities. 
(e) Which include the missionary enterprise, but expand it. 
(f) All of which requires constant and growing discrimination, 
foresight, and deliberation. 
(g) And for this reason calls for illumination from Scripture, 
history, doctrines, science, current events, and the creations of 
imagination. 
Under the concept of curriculum we are to think of the pupil 
us moving thus through social experiences; of these experiences 
as arising in active dealings with real situations of the present; 
as including the rise of intelligent social purposes; as coming in 
a prearranged order that is governed by the growth of the pupil’s 
social capacities, and as including human and divine fellowship 
in a single whole. Fundamentally, then, the curriculum is a 
course of living, not a course in supposed preliminaries to real 
life. 
The pre-social view of the curriculum. Before going on to 
further exposition of the implications of such a socialized curric- 
ulum, let us pause to realize just where the defects lay in the 
conception that prevailed in the church’s educational yester- 
day. Here is a wee book entitled Our Daily Guide, or Wise 
Words for Young Disciples,! which consists of a text of Scripture 
1 Published by T. Nelson and Sons. It has been in circulation recently, 
I believe, and very possibly is still on the market. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
THE CURRICULUM 99 
and a meditation for each day of the year. “ Enter not into the 
path of the wicked,” reads one of the Scripture selections, and 
the meditation attached to it runs thus: 
“Why should I join with those in play 
In whom I’ve no delight; 
Who curse and swear, but never pray, 
Who call ill names and fight?” 
Associated with the command, “Remember the Sabbath day, 
to keep it holy,” is this resolution: 
“T’ll leave my sport to read and pray, 
And so prepare for heaven; 
Oh, may I love this blessed day, 
The best of all the seven.” 
A third specimen is this: “The dead were judged out of those 
things which were written in the books, according to their 
works,” 
“Then let me always watch my lips, 
Lest I be struck to death and hell; 
Since God a book of reckoning keeps 
For every lie that children tell.” 
We are accustomed to dismiss documents like this with a 
comment upon their dreadful theology. But something more 
is revealed, even the affinity of individualistic religion, with its 
worship of an incompletely socialized god, for an educational 
method that consists in telling and commanding, but not in the 
growth of motives. The method, as well as the content, 
isolates the pupil from his fellows and from divine fellowship. 
The last thing thought of here is that a child might appreciate 
love or justice or real fellowship of any kind. 
How ingrained the individualistic notion of teaching was, 
how mechanical were the methods to which it led, and how 
remote it was from the pupil’s real life, may be seen from the

  following questions and “applications,” which are quoted from 
nineteenth-century question-bdooks for use in the Sunday school. 
Date, 1832. Lesson material: Paul and Silas at Thessalonica 
and Berea (Acts xvii, 1-16). ‘It was Paul’s halnt to attend pub- 
lic worship, ver. 2;—learn, That wherever we are, it is our duty 
to do the same, nothing can excuse it, but sickness, or some un- 
avoidable calamity.” ... ‘‘Pauwl reasoned with the Jews, out of 
the Scriptures, ver. 2;—learn, That the Scriptures are the only 
sources from which we can draw correct and weighty arguments.” 
. “Some of them who heard Paul believed, ver. 4 ;—learn, 
That truth affects different persons differently.” ... It is 
pleasant to record that this dreariness is not altogether unre- 
lieved by references to matters that really concern children. 
Thus, when the text-book reaches the story of the shipwreck, we 
read: “‘Many were saved by swimming, ver. 43;—learn, That it is 
useful to learn to swim; our own lives, under God, may some- 
times be indebted to it; and, besides this, if we know how to swim, 
we may assist others.” ! 
Date, 1845. A whole lesson is given to the two verses, Matthew 
xiii, 51 and 52. A few of the questions are as follows: 
“12. How should children treat their religious teachers? Heb. 
xiii, 7, 17; 1 Thes. v, 13. 
13. What danger is there in refusing to receive instruction? 
Mat. x, 14, 15; Pr. v, 23.      
  15. Why should you desire to be taught in the truths of the 
Gospel? II Tim. iii, 15. 
16. What is your duty in the Sabbath school?” 
In a lesson on “‘The Barren Fig Tree,” questions like this are 
asked: ‘‘What divine attribute is exhibited in granting to all 
persons a sufficient reason, and all necessary means of grace?” 
and the parable of the Prodigal Son is pointed with, “‘To what 
great end should all the blessings of providence and grace be de- 
voted?” ?

Date, 1862. Here are fifty lessons on the books of Joshua and 
Judges alone. One lesson is given to Caleb’s inheritance, another 
to Judah’s inheritance, and so on. The lesson on the inheritance 
of the Levites occasions these ‘‘Practical Questions”: ‘‘ Where 
in this lesson do we learn, that: The living of the ministry is not 
often so great as to tempt men into it for the sake of the compensa- 
tion? It is the will of God that the ministry be comfortably sup- 
ported? I Cor. ix, 13, 14. This support cannot be withheld 
without displeasing God? ... It is for the convenience of the 
ministry and the good of the people that they live near the sanc- 
tuary in which they minister?” ! 
Date, 1884. ‘‘What have I learned ?” is asked in connection with 
a lesson on The Thessalonians and Bereans (Acts xvii, 1-14), and 
the answer is given as follows: 
“1. That the Scriptures tell us what we are to believe and what 
we are to do. 
2. That it is ignoble to reject and oppose the Scriptures. 
3. That it is noble to receive and study the Scriptures. 
4. That we should search the Scriptures with earnest desire 
to find out just what they teach. 
5. That if we thus study the Scriptures we will be led into the 
truth.” 2 
Date, 1894. “Practical Lessons Learned” from the story of 
Cain and Abel are as follows: 
“1. We should bring our best gifts to God. 
2. We should offer them in faith in Christ. 
3. We should beware of envy, jealousy, and anger. 
4. Passion in heart leads to sin in life. 
5. We should seek pardon through Christ, the only Savior.” ® 
What a valley of dry bones is this! How wmnreligious it 
is! The reform of the curriculum that set in early in the 
present. century was fundamentally a religious reform. It 
was an attempt to remove paraphernalia, mistakenly supposed 
to be educational, that had been interposed between the child 
and religion. The spirit of the new movement is dominated 
by faith in the possibility of child religion and of growth in

religion. Let us have religion itself, it says, not these deaden- 
ing reiterations about it; let us help children to be Christian 
now, each in his personal world, however narrow it may be, and 
let us understand that herein the teaching of religion con- 
sists. This is the direction in which the reform of religious 
education is going. Many steps will have to be taken before 
our courses of talk about religion are wholly transformed into 
courses in religious living, we may be sure. Therefore let us 
go a little farther into the theory of the matter. 
The primary “‘content of the curriculum” is to be found 
in present relations and interactions between persons. The 
curriculum, we have agreed, is to be a scheme of growth in 
social motives that are actually in operation as the pupil goes 
along. The essence of teaching, then, will lie in leading the 
pupil to make experiments in social living whereby he shall 
know for himself, not merely by the hearing of the ear, the 
meaning and the validity of the ancient law of love which is 
also the law of justice. With children as with adults the doing 
of God’s will is the true way to insight. How, then, can the 
pupil be led to make experiments in the organization of his 
little social world upon the principle of good will and justice? 
Not by the old method of telling and commanding, but pri- 
marily through the attraction that he finds in persons who 
already live socially in his own environment. It is “living 
epistles,’’ known and read in family, church, or Sunday school 
that first make Christian fellowship a reality to him. This 
initial, pleasurable experience is what produces the momentum 
for carrying the principle of fellowship into other groups. In 
order to lift this process above mere imitation, mere good- 
natured drift, which lacks aggressiveness and power of achieve- 
ment in difficult situations, the pupil’s attention must be turned 
to these situations so that he shall discriminate differences, 
recognize problems, and see causal relations. That is, to study 
“the way” is primarily to notice the differences that exist here 
and now between social relations that are governed by active 
love and those that are not thus governed. 
This proposition does not ignore or minimize the significance
-P-A-G-E-115
THE CURRICULUM 103 
of historical material, but points, rather, to the vital, experiential 
way of using it. How, indeed, can the past be anything to us 
but a “dead past” until we discover by our own experiments 
that there is continuity between the living and the dead? As 
a matter of fact, the Bible, even parts of it that quiver with 
imperishable human interest, are to-day dead and inert things 
to multitudes because their approach was that of the old- 
fashioned curriculum. The very attempt to exalt the Bible 
devitalized it, concealed it, by making it a thing per se, to be 
first known apart from experience and only afterward applied 
in experience. The sparkle of its high lights, and the gloom of 
its shadows were missed alike, because it was all there merely 
to be learned, all on a dead level. Similar waste of precious 
power for living will always occur when “curriculum” means 
facing the pupil toward the far-away, the inexperienced, instead 
of toward present demonstrations of the meaning and the 
power of love. The word that gives life is always that which 
is made flesh, and dwells among men. “I in them, and thou 
in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world 
may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even 
as thou lovedst me.” 
When we thus transform the curriculum into a graded series 
of experiments in social living, making the present relations 
and interactions between persons the primary objects of study, 
not only shall we vitalize the parts of history that are of real 
religious importance, we shall also have a corrective for the 
present abstractness of much of our teaching. A notion is 
abroad that almost identifies the teaching of morals and re- 
ligion with inducing pupils to analyze qualities of character 
or to discriminate the virtues one from another. “What sort 
of man was Abraham?” asks the teacher, and the pupil replies: 
“He was a man of faith,” or “He was generous.” Sometimes 
the questions run: “ What do we call a man who conducts him- 
self in this way? Yes, we call him generous,” etc., etc. Ex- 
tended plans have been made for moving on from one such 
quality or virtue to another until a whole galaxy of virtues has 
been telescopically viewed and mapped. 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
  104 THE CURRICULUM 
We need not deny all value to such study. The pupil’s 
imaginative contact with good men is not likely to be altogether 
useless, and the acquisition of an ethical vocabulary is cer- 
tainly desirable. Yet the fact remains that the really important 
thing about Abraham is his contribution to a certain social- 
religious movement. The American boy who moves in imagina- 
tion with Abraham should move with him toward defined 
social objectives, should be made to realize the difference that 
the life of the patriarch made for other persons. Studying 
virtues is not the same as studying men in their social relations. 
We may glorify a virtue at the very moment that we forget men. 
Dissecting virtues, moreover, does not necessarily make 
them attractive, even in their abstractness. Some inkling of 
further need is revealed in questions like these: “ What do you 
admire in Abraham?” and “ Which is your favorite character 
among all those that we have studied this quarter, and why?” 
Even if a virtue is made attractive, toward what, in terms 
of concrete living, is the pupil drawn? Suppose that we have 
produced admiration for generosity; there remains the question: 
In what way have we modified the pupil’s purposes? Have we 
merely caused him to desire a share in the praise that is due to 
the generous? The desire to be “good” may be a subtle form 
of self-seeking. ‘The desires and purposes that are worth awak- 
ening are those that consciously connect others with oneself 
in some scheme of objective good, such as welfare, justice, or a 
broader fellowship. 
As long as one keeps one’s attention upon inner and private 
qualities, instead of keeping it upon the effects of this or that 
conduct upon specific human beings, one can escape the sense 
of responsibility for the social order of which one is a member. 
Who does not know that fine personal qualities may be wide- 
spread in a socially lethargic community or church? When 
has “good man”’ had the connotation of caring for even rudi- 
mentary justice? A community in which, in spite of an abun- 
dant food-supply, many children lack sufficient nourishment 
to enable them to do their school work may contain any num- 
ber of kindly, comfortable citizens to whom such a glaring in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  THE CURRICULUM 105 
justice never comes home as having anything to do with their 
character. They are “good” men, they have “virtues” many 
and genuine, they are not hypocrites; yet something funda- 
mental is lacking. ‘This lack will not be made good by adding 
another “virtue”’ to their private stock. The whole method 
of their ethical thinking must be reconstructed. They must 
approach duty by a different route. The question of con- 
science should be: What persons are affected by my acts, or by 
my failures to act, and how are they affected? I am a part of 
a system of ethical nerves that reaches every member of the 
community, and binds all into an interdependent whole. 
It requires no great acuity of vision, but only pausing and 
looking, to see that economic interdependence is at the same 
time ethical relatedness. In every bargain that I make, in 
every article that I use or consume, I traffic in human energies 
as well as in things, I relate myself to the health and happiness 
of men and women whom I have never seen, I take part in 
making their children what they become. To assume full re- 
sponsibility for these acts of mine, to form a habit of seeing so- 
ciety as it is, and of tracing social causes and effects, and to 
think my very own moral life in community terms—these are 
the rudiments of an awakened, mature Christian conscience. 
The road toward such maturity is, obviously, training in analysis 
and in appreciation of human life in its present interrelated- 
ness, and practice in making human relations those of a genuine 
fellowship.! 
The changing social situations incident to the pupil’s 
growth, with their inevitable problems of social adjustment, 
furnish a basis for the order and the use of the material. 
<The social life of a child begins in a narrow circle, widens into 
larger and larger circles, and becomes a complex of interpene- 
trating circles-} What but this movement of social enlarge- 
ment and complication could determine the order of the ma- 
terial in a really socialized curriculum? Family life, play life, 
school life, civic life, occupation, marriage—here is a progressive

Chapter XIV.

order that is also a natural social order. A brief analysis of 
the educational problems presented by one or two of these situa- 
tions will serve to make clear the principle of arrangement and 
af use. 
Under normal conditions a child begins his social experi- 
ence in a family Here parental love, starting in instinct, 
but going on to reflective devotion, becomes the first revela- 
tion of the law of love. It does so by the utterly concrete 
method of attaching the child, by means of his pleasures, to 
his parents and to the other members of the household. Here 
is presented the first material for systematic religious educa- 
tion. The objects for study are father and mother, the other 
children, the domestic helpers, and the purveyors to the fam- 
ily’s needs, in their respective activities as these affect the mu- 
tual happiness. The inclusion of the divine Father in this 
group comes naturally as expressing a fellowship of obedience 
in which the older and the younger share. In a group in which 
the full enfranchisement of some of the members is‘not yet 
possible, there is danger of undemocratic rule and undemocratic 
subjection. The common Fatherhood here serves as a democ- 
ratizing principle. It is to be referred to and wrought into 
the child’s daily consciousness, not as an importation from 
outside the daily family life, not as an individual possession of 
the child, or as an imposition upon his will, but as adding rich 
meaning to “our” in “our family.” 
The child’s life in the family extends outward into play 
groups of members of various families. In a short time the 
play group buds off and becomes an almost autonomous social 
life of children with children. Games and plays are handed 
down from one such group to another for centuries without 
plan, or record, or adult participation. With the games go 
codes of conduct. Rather, the rules of each game do of them- 
selves prescribe one or another sort of self-controlled act in 
the interest of co-operation, and not seldom penalties for non- 
co-operation. 
Moreover, children erect standards, sometimes but not al- 
ways unreflectively, for the conduct that is due from them- 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
THE CURRICULUM 107 
selves to various classes of persons. There are standards with 
respect to competitors in games as compared with team-mates; 
strange children as contrasted with acquaintances; children of 
a different economic “class”; older children and younger 
ones; the school-teacher;? the janitor; the street-car conduc- 
tor;? the policeman; persons of other nationalities;4 and per- 
sons occupying different positions in the industrial scale, as 
domestic “servants,” “common” laborers, and capitalists. 
We adults often fail to realize that in the child world a child 
public opinion sustains and even enforces these standards. 
Here a child finds social reality. Compared with it the advice 
of an adult is likely to seem cold, unreal, unappreciative. 
We cannot deal adequately with this child society by merely 
proclaiming better standards, or by appending prohibitions and 
penalties to the proclamation. Rather, through our fellowship 
with children we must help child society to find its own possi- 
bilities of greater happiness. Children’s codes will not be the 
same as those of Christian maturity, in any case, for the range 
of human relations that can be attended to, and the range of 
1 Ask boys who are competing in running races what they think of starting 
ahead of the pistol. You are likely to find, as I have done, approval of such 
evasion of rules provided only that one can succeed in it. 
2 I know of a secondary school in which at one time the maxim, ‘A lie to 
the faculty is not a lie,’’ expressed a common attitude of the boys, even of the 
more serious minded ones. Even in a well managed elementary school grade 
steps have been necessary to prevent pupils from altering report-cards sent to 
parents—‘‘raising’’ them as a forger raises a check. The point of these 
instances is not the badness of children, but only their constant tendency to 
form standards and a public opinion of their own upon the basis of their own 
too narrow experience. What the teacher has to do is to enlarge the basis 
for the children’s judgment upon social relations. 
3 Using one’s wits to get something for nothing has the attraction of ad- 
venture, of contest, and of conquest. Boys, at least, trade and bargain 
with one another with a fierceness of cupidity, and sometimes with a tricki- 
ness, that represent in miniature some features of their elders’ system of 
competitive profit getting. It is not always easy to make a child realize 
that cheating an impersonal entity like a street-railroad corporation is on the 
level of plain stealing. 
4 Race prejudices on the part of adults find a fruitful soil in the child mind, 
which is struck by differences in costume, speech, and manner, rather than 
by the less obvious, underlying identities of human nature. One of the 
fine, and likewise pressing tasks of Christian teachers in many of our centres 
of population is to help children who already look down upon ‘“‘sheenies”’ 
and ‘‘dagoes’’ (the latest term, I believe, is ‘‘guineas'’) to discover the fine 
human qualities that these races are contributing to our American life.

  108 THE CURRICULUM 
possible adjustment acts, change with growing years. Never- 
theless, within the range of childish capacities, immense dif- 
ferences of code are possible, most important shifts in social 
pleasures. Here, precisely, is where religious education has 
its opportunity and its cali. Its central function will be to 
stimulate social experiments of certain kinds within the chil- 
dren’s own world—experiments in which situations will be 
analyzed as they would not be without adult help, in which 
acquaintance of children with one another will be deepened, 
and in which thereby the joys of co-operation, helpfulness, fair 
play, and justice will be multiplied." 
These two examples, the family group and the play group, 
are sufficient to make clear how the grades or other divisions 
of a socialized curriculum can grow directly out of the pupil’s 
expanding social experience. It is not necessary to continue 
this analysis into the child’s school life, with its fresh prob- 
lems of work, of systematized co-operation, and of authority; 
nor into his growing contacts with the political, industrial, 
commercial, philanthropic, and cultural institutions of the com- 
munity; nor into his relations to a life-occupation, nor into his 
preparation for marriage. It is, however, important to notice 
that a progressive course in social living takes the form, as far 
as instruction is concerned, of a series of problems to be solved 
—problems, let it be noted, not imported into the child’s world 
by the teacher, but already in the enterprises and the joys and 
sorrows of childhood. Let it be noted, finally, that under 
this conception of education the teacher does not give the 
pupils solutions for their problems, but induces the pupils to 
analyze and experiment so that they reach convictions of their 
very own. 
How the “social situation”’ order Of the curriculum differs 
from others. The significance of this new theory of the curric- 
ulum may be pointed still further by a brief résumé of other 
principles, either practised or proposed, for the arrangement of 
material. 
1 Compare what was said in Chapter IV concerning the necessity of help- 
ing children out of the crowd type of association into the deliberative type. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
THE CURRICULUM 109 
(1) The part-and-whole arrangement, whereby the Bible or 
the catechism is simply cut up into a number of parts to corre- 
spond with certain periods of time, or an abbreviated and sim- 
plified form (as of the commandments or of the catechism) 
precedes the complete one. 
(2) The historical arrangement, whereby the pupil first thinks 
about earlier times, then about later ones, and at last arrives— 
if, indeed, he ever does arrive—at his own times. 
(3) The supposedly psychological arrangement, whereby spon- 
taneous interests that are believed to arise in a serial order 
are to have each its own kind of food in its season. In a later 
chapter we shall have to touch upon the most extreme form of 
this theory, which bases the order of the material upon the re- 
capitulation doctrine of mental growth.! Here we may point 
out that in whatever form the supposedly psychological ar- 
rangement appears it misses or underrates an important factor 
in children’s interests. The fact that some instincts ripen later 
than others does bring it to pass, indeed, that spontaneous 
attention shifts in certain matters by reason of a purely in- 
ternal impulsion. It is true, too, that the mere presence of 
powers not yet fully employed is a determining factor. 
On the other hand, however, children’s characteristic interests 
are not, on the whole, spontaneous demands for this or that 
object or for this or that result, but rather for participation in 
processes of certain types. One of the simplest examples is the 
interest that is supposed to underlie the voracious hearing and 
reading of blood-and-thunder tales. Superficial observation 
may make it appear that suffering and cruelty as such are at- 
tractive, or that strength applied to immoral ends is what the 
child most likes to contemplate, whereas the thing that he is 
really after is imaginative participation in action that involves 
rapid changes, stirring contrasts, and simple motives, with 
the sense of living that such action brings. The action may be 
cruel or heroic, and the motive and outcome may be noble or 
base; the interest is there in either case. 
Moreover, the particular material that attracts the child’s 
1 See Chapter XII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
110 THE CURRICULUM 
attention, the particular application of his impulses toward 
participation, is determined in each case in large measure by 
what the habitual environment offers, and by the kinds of 
active, overt participation that are open to him. Here, for 
example, is an only child who has had little contact with other 
children. When he is brought to the kindergarten he shrinks 
at first from the very objects and occupations that fascinate 
the other children. Again, keep a child amused by toys that 
perform in his presence while he remains little more than a 
spectator, and you create demands, interests, of a particular 
kind; pursue the opposite policy from the beginning, provid- 
ing him with material for self-expression, construction, and 
initiative, and you create an opposite set of interests. The 
truth is that there is no serial order of underived interests upon 
which a curriculum could be organized. We must conform, 
rather, to the serial order of situations that develop with growth, 
striving always to develop interests, not merely to feed those that 
happen to be present already. 
(4) The ecclesiastical arrangement, whereby religious educa- 
tion is made to consist in a gradual initiation into the worship, 
the activities, and the beliefs of the church, and into full con- 
formity to its authority. This is like the part-and-whole prin- 
ciple of arrangement except that active participation in insti- 
tutional life is added to “learning about.’ It is like the 
“social situation” principle in that it causes the pupil to attend 
to persons and what they do, and to take for himself a part in 
the doing. It is unlike it in two respects: It induces the child 
to conform rather than to experiment, and it introduces him to 
ready-made solutions instead of introducing him to problems. 
There is likewise a difference, of emphasis at least, with respect 
to the relation of the pupil’s fellowship in the church to his 
fellowships in other groups. This point is of so great import 
that we must pause to consider it for a moment. 
The place of the church in a curriculum of social living. 
If the content of the curriculum is to consist of the relations 
between persons in a series of social situations—family, play 
group, school, etc.—where, it may be asked, does the church 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
THE CURRICULUM 111 
group come in? Where does the curriculum introduce the child 
to the sacred fellowship and the common worship of the avowed 
disciples of Jesus Christ? 
The main alternatives that need to be considered may be 
indicated by these questions: Shall the child’s ecclesiastical 
experience be treated as a particular social sphere co-ordinate 
with others, as the family and the state, but having a different 
principle of fellowship or a different set of problems to work 
out; or, shall the child experience the church fellowship as a 
specially earnest, co-operative effort to work out the very prob- 
lems that arise in the family and in the other social situations 
that have been named? Again, shall the child experience the 
“sacred” or “set apart” as something inhering in the church 
group as such but not in others; or, shall he experience all love, 
all justice, binding men together anywhere, as the sacred? 
Shall his initiation into common worship take him out of the 
social consciousness of the work day and of the play day into 
a new and separate communion; or, shall the fellowship of 
prayer be continuous with all good fellowships, even a confirm- 
ing of them and an inspiration within them? Where shall the 
child be taught to look for God? 
Underneath all these chapters on the new religious education 
is a particular assumption. It has been vividly phrased by 
the writer of the First Epistle of John: “This is the message 
that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one 
another. ... Love is of God; and every one that loveth is 
begotten of God, and knoweth God. ... But whoso hath 
the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and 
shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of 
God abide in him?” 
If the Christian ideal were a divine autocracy, or a divine- 
human aristocracy, then indeed it could promote itself by mak- 
ing attractive to children a common worship that by its solemn, 
majestic, and overawing mysteries should seem to tower above 
and apart from the associations of the common day. If the 
fellowship of the avowed disciples of Jesus were a particular 
species of love, and not just plain, unreserved good will, then    
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 THE CURRICULUM 
the child’s introduction to the church would be, indeed, an in- 
itiation into a society of the peculiarly good, the favorites of 
heaven. But if we grant that the fellowship of Christians is 
rooted in a kind of divine love that desires to enfranchise 
every man into democratic society, a love so divine that it knows 
no favored class on the one hand, and no undivine goodness on 
the other, then we shall induct children into common worship 
and the communion within the church as a heightened conscious- 
ness of what we are about in our every-day social relations. 
The presence of God will be made manifest in united prayer, 
not as something done in a church building, not because it is 
uttered by a privileged person or group, or according to any 
formula, but because the content of it brings to a focus the so- 
cial problems of the common day, and gathers together the 
children’s powers of aspiration after the good will that is the 
solution. Where is God? Wherever a mature man or a little 
child faces the problem of the mutual adjustment of two or 
more human lives to each other, there he meets God. 
Love that is so divine as to be utterly democratic makes a 
church aspire to be, not so much a superi rt of society, as 
an exponent of society in the large as dwelling place 
of God. Ecclesiastical ambition now runs, not toward cen- 
tralization of power in the ecclesiastical organization, but 
toward diffusion of the light of love through the whole social 
complex. The church itself now becomes a living exegesis of 
the great paradox that only by losing our life do we gain life. 
Such a church will be quick to minister to any human need 
that is not otherwise provided for—any need, from food to fun, 
and from athletics to art—but it will stimulate the family, 
the school, community institutions, and the state to take upon 
themselves every social function that they are adapted to per- 
form. 
Z The church of the spirit of love seeks thus to infuse itself into 
the whole social body, not to maintain eternal separateness 
therefrom.) It does not find a competitor in any philanthropic 
institution that efficiently organizes good will. It does not 
depreciate as nrerely secular the social enthusiasm of any one     
     
   
 
-P-A-G-E-125
THE CURRICULUM 113 
who loves men as men, for God so loves them. It does not 
grow apprehensive lest the social movement should substitute 
the sacredness of humanity for the sacredness of worship. It 
is apprehensive, rather, lest men may not hold life sacred 
enough, may not love deeply enough to satisfy divine justice, 
may not make the happy discovery of themselves as work- 
fellows of the great Lover who is in all love, may never know 
that love itself is worship. 
The position of the church in a socialized curriculum is that 
of a present fellowship that runs through all the developing 
fellowships, inspiring them to fulfil themselves, and urging them 
on toward the deep love of men that is also the conscious wor- 
ship of God. 
The place of the Bible in the curriculum. I have said, in 
substance, that the theory of the curriculum is to be based 
squarely upon the idea of incarnation—that God makes him- 
self known to us in concrete human life; that we obey him and 
commune with him in any and every brotherly attitude that 
we take toward any of his children, and that this experience 
of God does not occur merely once or twice in history, but con- 
tinuously. The realization of God on the part of the prophets 
and of Jesus is transmitted to us primarily in the human lives 
that have already come under its influence. We are linked 
with God in ancient history by nothing less than God himself 
within the intervening generations. Life is continuous. The 
generations are not separated from one another like the banks 
of a stream over which a bridge must be built. No non-living 
thing could communicate the divine life to us, but only this 
life itself. The consequence for religious education is that 
it consists primarily in the awakening of religious experience 
in children through their contacts with persons who already 
have such experience. The Bible then takes its place as a 
means that mightily assists in promoting, illuminating, and 
confirming these contacts, and in extending the Christian fel- 
lowship backward to Jesus and the prophets, and forward 
toward the fulfilling of the prophetic ideals. 
From of old it has been a custom among Christians to go       
     
-P-A-G-E-126
  114 THE CURRICULUM 
to the Bible for specific help for specific needs. Does the 
shadow of death menace us? We turn to the Twenty-third 
Psalm or to the fifteenth chapter of First Corinthians. Do 
the uncertainties of life’s struggle tempt us to compromise 
with evil? The sixth of Matthew comes to our aid. Does 
our prayer life require refreshing? We restudy the Lord’s 
Prayer. Do we desire to think straight on the social question? 
We ponder the profoundly simple words of Jesus and of the 
prophets concerning justice and brotherly love. In short, 
we take our start from needs involved in our present situation, 
and we then select from the multitudinous wealth of the Scrip- 
tures the part that gives us the greatest help. 
We shall discover the true place of the Bible in the curricu- 
lum by applying to childhood the same principle of using the 
Scriptures in the interest of present living. If the curriculum 
is fundamentally a course in Christian living, the Bible will be 
used at each turn of the child’s experience in such a way as 
to help him with the particular problem that is then upper- 
most. We as teachers shall then select for the child just 
as we select for ourselves, leaving unconsidered for the time 
anything in the Bible that does not feed 
The result will be that the progressive social 
child will be reflected in the successive passages that are chosen, 
and if need be repeated from time to time. That is, we shall 
have a truly graded scheme of biblical lessons. It will begin 
with stories topically arranged, but as the pupil’s outlook 
grows, it will deal with whole periods, whole books, and finally 
the whole movement of the religious consciousness that the 
Bible reflects. 
On precisely the same principle so-called extra-biblical 
material will be used as it is needed. When | as an adult Chris- 
tian meet the problem of how large my missionary contribution 
shall be, I seek information concerning the missions of to-day. 
When I want to know what my duty is with respect to the 
liquor traffic, I study its baleful effects and also the methods 
of fighting it. When the preacher asks me to support a pro- 
posed child-labor law, I want him to give me the facts with     
   
   
-P-A-G-E-127
THE CURRICULUM 115 
regard to children in industry and with regard to the laws on 
the subject. If loyalty to the church is in question, I must know 
something of the history of the church, something of its actual 
position in present society, and something concerning the more 
effective forms of church life. This is the way that we adults 
study to be Christian. The way for children is not different in 
principle but only in the application. Extra-biblical material 
for study is just as necessary for them as for us because their 
problems, like our own, have to do with enterprises and adjust- 
ments concerning which the Bible gives no whit of information 
—nnissions in lands unknown in ancient times; philanthropic en- 
terprises under conditions and by methods not so much as con- 
ceived of by any biblical writer; social adjustments in the 
home, on the playground, at school, in the choice of an occu- 
pation, in the conduct of one’s occupation, in the use of the bal- 
lot, which must be studied directly if they are to be understood 
at all. 
Such extra-biblical factors in the problems of Christian living 
are bound to have a large place in the socialized curriculum. 
But they will not supplant the Bible, or derogate from its unique- 
ness as an instrument for social education. For the Bible 
contains a body of social literature of unique power for the stim- 
ulation and criticism of social motives and ideals. It is in 
and through the use of the Bible that we come into fellowship 
with the greatest of our social leaders, meeting God in them. 
No mystical introduction to the Christ who dwells in the heart 
of every believer can be substituted for fellowship with the 
historical Jesus and with the great Old Testament characters 
who influenced his own social education. The fellowship of a 
common social purpose is, indeed, the foundation of Chris- 
tian education, and this foundation is laid in the pupil’s present 
acquaintance with persons in whom God’s presence shines out 
as love. But this fellowship, this social experience, can be 
extended by imagination. It is thus extended through memory, 
for how often does one become better acquainted with the real 
character of a loved one by separation from him. Similarly, 
imagination extends our fellowship to persons whom we have     
 
-P-A-G-E-128
    
  116 THE CURRICULUM 
never seen, whether they are separated from us by oceans or 
by centuries. “Whom, not having seen, we love.” 
The educative power of such imaginative association depends 
partly upon the law of suggestion. Merely associating with 
persons of positive goodness tends to habituate us to the ex- 
pectation of goodness in ourselves. Likewise emotional re- 
actions against imagined badness can have a part in forming 
habitual attitudes. But this is only atmosphere or background 
for something far more specific, namely, the use of imagined 
persons, events, and situations in the analysis of present issues 
and of universal laws of living. The uniqueness of the Bible 
as a source of material for social education lies, in large measure, 
in the sharpness with which it presents issues without abstract- 
ing them from persons and events. Here is the truth of life 
presented in the form of life, a form so characteristically drawn 
that he who runs perceives the ethical meaning. There are 
many biblical tales that one can hardly read or listen to in a 
naive manner without, in the very act, criticisimg one’s own 
conduct. There are aphorisms and formule without number 
that become tools for mastering our own experience. 
Nevertheless, the history of religio cation shows that 
even this magnificent body of concrete ean be so taught 
as to seem far away and unrelated to us. We must therefore 
assume, on this ground also, the necessity of the living teacher, 
and of art in teaching. Thus the literary material of the curric- 
ulum finally becomes, not something per se, but ideas actually 
performing their function. Material and method become in- 
dissolubly one.

CHAPTER X 
THE SOCIAL NATURE OF MAN 
The problem of Part III. We come now to the nature 
of the human material that religious education undertakes to 
modify. What, for the purpose of the present discussion, is 
a child? That is, what is there in children that justifies any 
expectation that they will make a favorable response to the 
social principles of the Christian religion? Does child nature 
include any obstacle to such response? What is child religion 
as compared with the religion of adults? Are there any laws 
of growth that condition a child’s religious experience? What 
sorts of situation, controllable by the educator, are most con- 
ducive to religious growth? And what is the process whereby 
a social purpose grows mature? 
These questions are different from the ones that text-books 
for Sunday-school teachers ordinarily undertake to answer. 
Child study for teachers of religion abounds in discussions of 
children’s imitativeness, their imagination, their memory, 
their activity and changeability, their play, their constructive- 
ness; all of which is important, but little of which touches 
upon the religious capacities of childhood. It fails to touch 
upon these capacities because it concerns the general form of 
children’s reactions rather than interests and motives. As a 
consequence, a teacher who understands all these formal char- 
acteristics of children, and guides the teaching process in the 
light of them, may nevertheless appeal to either social or in- 
dividualistic motives, and therefore may start the child either 
well or ill. Therefore, with our eyes upon the content of the 
Christian purpose, the democracy of God, we must go on to 
ask what capacities children have for being interested in any 
such thing, or for responding to any part of such an ideal. 
119 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 HUMAN NATURE 
Some of these questions have already been touched upon 
in our sketch of the new religious education, particularly in 
Chapters VII, VIII, and IX. The general conception of a 
child’s religious progress there presented is that of the con- 
tinuous achievement of intelligent good will in his growing social 
relationships, and the enlargement of these relationships them- 
selves in the church and in its worship. We assumed that 
children respond to social incentives, and that worship of a 
Father who loves us can be a vital experience in childhood as 
truly, though not necessarily in the same degree or form, as 
in adulthood. 
These assumptions are not violent ones. . Perhaps they 
do not need defense, but they do need further analysis in the 
interest of specific control of particular sorts of reaction. Rel- 
atively simple as a child’s interests and motives are, they are 
nevertheless sufficiently complicated to make the understand- 
ing of children, and skill in teaching (as distinguished from 
knack) something of an achievement. We shall presently see 
some evidence of the ease with which we misinterpret children, 
and it will grow increasingly clear that the misplacing of a mo- 
tive in teaching is a most serious matter. _ 
What is meant by “the psychological background of a social- 
ized religious education,” then, is this: The social and the anti- 
social impulses of a child, and particularly how social instincts 
can grow into social purposes of ideal scope. ‘This is back- 
ground only. If middle ground and foreground also were to 
be presented, practically the whole of educational psychology 
would have to be reviewed. For the teaching of religion, as 
of anything else, involves such matters as sense-perception, 
imagination, memory, habit, attention and interest, judgment 
and inference, the laws of transfer and the laws of fatigue. 
For topics like these the reader is referred to the general works 
on educational psychology. 
Instinct-factors in the conduct of one human being toward 
another. By instinct is meant, in this discussion, any readi- 
ness to act in a specific way in a particular sort of situation with- 
out having learned to do so, or (as it is often put) the first time 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  HUMAN NATURE 121 
that a situation of the sort is presented. This definition, it 
will be noted, refers to specific kinds of action rather than to 
broad tendencies in either the race or the individual. There 
are such broad tendencies. The evolution of the race exhibits 
movement toward refinement in various directions, and toward 
the organization of conduct into social institutions of increas- 
ing scope. Similarly, growth of an individual mind consists, 
in large measure, in the achievement of organized self-conscious- 
ness and self-control. These tendencies are of course to be 
included in the concept of man’s social nature. They will 
have our attention in subsequent sections. But first it is im- 
portant, for the purpose of effective control through teaching, 
to see that human nature is not merely a few general tendencies 
that are to be promoted or resisted by appealing to general 
motives, but also a vast complex of readinesses to act in this 
or that specific way under specific conditions. What the 
teacher has to do is to secure particular social reactions and to 
prevent particular antisocial ones, to the end that social habits 
and social thinking may grow with the pupil’s increasing con- 
tacts with his fellows. ‘The effectively good will is more than 
a benevolent sentiment toward mankind in general; it is also 
a will trained to meet particular human situations. 
In the following summary of instinct factors in social and 
anti-social conduct I shall follow chiefly Thorndike, who has 
carried the analysis of the instincts farther than any other 
psychologist, but I shall subsequently make use also of certain 
analyses by McDougall. The list summarizes factors only, 
treating each one in its simplicity and in isolation, and without 
reference at this point to the integral life of individual self- 
control or of social organization. We are to notice, as it were, 
certain bones of the human skeleton, rather than the living 
body performing its functions.1 
1 Even if limitations of space permitted me to describe in detail the situa- 
tion that evokes each sort of response, and the muscular and physiological 
features of each response, I could do little more than reproduce the sub- 
stance of Thorndike’s descriptions. The reader is advised by all means to 
read them for himself. See E. L. Thorndike, The Original Nature of Man 
(which is vol. I of his three-volume Educational Psychology). New York, 1913,

(1) Simple gregariousness, or pleasure in the mere presence 
of other members of the species, and discomfort in their absence. 
(2) Special interest in what is being done by human beings, as 
distinguished from all other objects in the environment. 
(3) Wanting to be noticed by other human beings. 
(4) Craving for approval from other human beings, and discomfort 
from their disapproval, whether the grounds of it be ethical or not. 
(5) Approval or admiration not only for those who are useful 
to us, but also for those who exhibit strength, daring, or beauty; and 
disapproval, scorn, or disgust for persons of the opposite sorts, even 
though they have not injured us. ‘This instinct is primarily directed 
toward qualities that are important for savage society, but the 
sphere of its application grows with the growing standards of 
society. Thus it is that moral strength (what is ‘‘moral” being 
determined by the then existing standard) is an object of instinc- 
tive admiration. 
(6) Effort to master others, particularly weaker animals and hu- 
man beings, and to subdue them if they resist; but also readiness to 
submit to the strong or self-assertive individual. ‘Thorndike classes 
instinctive display or showing off as a partial manifestation of 
the instinct of mastery, and shyness as a partial manifestation of 
the instinct of submission. Both are prominent in courtship, 
but they play a part also in much other conduct. 
(7) Rivalry (attempting to get something for oneself rather 
than let another get it), greed (getting for oneself regardless both 
of the need of others and of oneself), and jealousy (annoyance 
with, and perhaps attack upon, another who receives attention 
or benefits that one desires for oneself). « 
(8) Hunting. Though primarily related to the securing of 
food, the hunting instinct does not stop here, but goes on to kill- 
ing for sport, mastering and tormenting animals, bullying weaker 
human beings, callous pursuit of persons whom we dislike, and 
some forms of warfare. 
(9) Anger and pugnacity. The primary instinctive response 
to situations like being physically restrained, thwarted, or attacked 
is (unless submission intervenes) struggling, or screaming, or 
kicking, or striking back, or counter-attack, commonly with more 
or less of the emotional commotion called anger. Secondarily, 
pugnacity applies to any kind of thwarting, as in argument, and 
it becomes pleasure in combat as such, whether with weapons or 
in sport, whether with muscles or with wits.

(10) Sex attraction. The social significance of the sex instinct 
far outruns the mere perpetuation of the species. ‘‘It is true 
that sex attraction as such does not seem to include regard for 
another’s interests; nothing can be more ruthless than the sex 
instinct, in some of its manifestations, at least. Yet it does not: 
generally exist ‘in and by itself’ in the human species. The fixa- 
tion of attention upon another, the vivid realization of his presence: 
as chis particular individual, which is characteristic of sex attrac- 
tion, has an important consequence. We individualize another 
by Einfiihlung—that is, by imaginative putting of oneself in 
another’s place—so that we reciprocally feel one another’s satis- 
factions and discomforts. Now, sex attraction, as well as pa- 
rental instinct, strongly individualizes its object. Therefore we 
may assume that sex makes a direct contribution to the apprecia- 
tion of benevolence and justice. Something very like the parental 
attitude also appears between lovers—the attitude of protection, 
intense response to every sign of pain, cuddling.”! It is a matter 
of great social import, moreover, that sex attraction influences 
conduct toward persons with whom sexual union is out of the ques- 
tion, as in the attitudes of the two sexes toward each other in the 
family, in social gatherings and diversions, in friendships, and in 
the many respects in which we treat the two sexes differently. 
The emotional accompaniments of the adolescent sex awakening 
affect even the attitudes of males toward males and of females 
toward females; yes, the fresh ssthetic, idealizing, and compan- 
ionship-seeking state of mind often modifies one’s whole social 
attitude, and even one’s attitude toward nature. 
(11) Parental regard. It is most obvious and most tender in 
mothers, being related in origin to sensations connected with 
suckling and with other close and frequent physical contacts. 
But it is instinctive in both men and women. Undoubtedly the 
attachment of the father for the mother has much to do with the 
attention that he gives to their children, and thus with the activity 
of paternal affection. Possibly self-giving maternal affection is 
the evolutionary link that has united the father with the child, 
and thus given rise to the permanent monogamous family. Yet 
the father’s regard for his children is, conversely, an added bond 
between him and their mother. In any case, whatever was first 
in origin, the spontaneous readiness of both parents to feed, pro-

tect, and succor their offspring through the extraordinarily long 
human infaney is a prime psychological foundation of what is 
finest, and most difficult, in the larger social integrations of men. 
Its relation to the larger society grows out of two circumstances: 
a. In the family, which rests upon parental instinct, and spe- 
cifically through the intimate domestic manifestations of this in- 
stinct, children receive social training that is in some measure 
transferred to their life in the larger society. 6. The parental 
instinct is not limited to parents, nor are small children the only 
objects that stimulate it. This matter is so involved and its 
social bearings are so important that detailed attention will be 
given to it in a subsequent section. 
(12) The kind of imitativeness that produces crowd action. 
The unique social significance of the parental instinct. 
‘Two groups of facts will indicate how broad and deep is the 
influence of this instinct in the evolution of society, particularly 
of democratic society. 
(1) Parental attitudes arise spontaneously long before physi- 
ological capacity for parenthood arrives; they live on through 
life, even though one never has children of one’s own, and they 
attach themselves not only to children, but to adults as well. Noth- 
ing less than parental are the relations that small children, 
boys as well as girls, assume with dolls, animal pets, smaller 
children, and toys. This is not mere imitation of older per- 
sons, for the activities are clearly different from those of adults 
in many respects, and the emotional fervor and tenacity are 
too obviously original with the child. There is no escaping 
the conclusion that this is actual parental instinct. Its instincs 
tive character is proved by: (1) Its universality. (2) The 
possibility of identifying its primary objects as a class, namely, 
smaller things thought of as living, especially those that are 
helpless, lonely, or suffering. (3) The specific nature of its 
motor discharges, such as taking into one’s arms, keeping near 
one (as at night), providing food (real or imaginary) and other 
objects to meet particular assumed needs, patting, stroking, 
laying the cheek against. (4) A surprising confirmation of 
this theory that has been brought to my attention by one of 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
HUMAN NATURE 125 
my students. The evidence consists of photographs of two 
half-grown bluebirds, one of which is in the act of feeding a 
worm to the other. One of the pictures shows the two facing 
each other, one with the worm, the other with open mouth; 
the other picture shows the bill of the first bird well down the 
throat of the other. Here the instinct to swallow whenever 
a worm is in the mouth is inhibited exactly as it is when a 
mother bird has her first brood; it is inhibited, obviously, by 
another instinct. 
That this instinct lives on through life, especially if it re- 
ceives frequent indulgence either in affectionate acts toward 
one’s own offspring or toward other objects, hardly needs argu- 
ment. The parental petting of animals does not cease with 
childhood; with the childless it is often a substitute for literal 
parenthood. A baby, too—anybody’s baby, white, yellow, or 
black—is an object of peculiar interest. I have seen the tired 
faces of a whole group of men and women in a New York sub- 
way car relax and mellow as their eyes all sought the face of a 
baby playing in its mother’s lap. Austere men, hard men, boys 
who are ready to bully those only a little younger than them- 
selves, all are gentle, all take the attitude of protection toward 
very small children. The teaching profession, education as a 
whole, is permeated by a truly parental interest in the young. 
When parents reach the weakness of old age, then the chil- 
dren, in their turn, assume the parental attitude toward those 
who bore them. A gentleman who was showing exquisite 
tenderness toward an aged parent remarked: “I have had no 
children of my own, you know.” In general, too, does not 
reverence for gray hairs contain this instinct as one of its con- 
stituents? And why is it that everybody is ready to help a 
blind man find his way upon the street? No doubt the im- 
pulses that underlie our relations to our fellows are complex, 
and to some extent contradictory. Some of them become 
dominant, others are smothered, or contradictory impulses 
1 Without doubt males would be more demonstrative in this direction but 
for a social tradition of sex inequality, and but for that other baleful tradi- 
tion, that manliness is demonstrated by fighting rather than by tenderness. 
These, too, rest back upon instinct, of course.

alternate. But any one who has eyes can see continually com- 
ing to the surface, in fragmentary ways at least, spontaneous 
helpfulness of the parental type. 
(2) The parental instinct is the chief source, probably the 
exclusive source, of tender regard for indinduals as such, that is, 
taking another’s happiness or woe as one’s very own. Thorn- 
dike is, on the whole, inclined to regard the pitying response 
to signs of weakness, fright, and pain, as an instance of, or 
derivative from, “motherly behavior.”’! Whatever be the 
fact in this matter, pity is only one aspect of mothering, and 
it is only one aspect of regard for individuals as such. The 
major manifestation of this regard is demand for justice for 
all men simply as men, and readiness to suffer actively with 
them in the struggle to obtain it. There is something in us 
that makes us individualize our fellows, think of them one by 
one apart from possessions, apart from their age and social 
status, apart even from their individual defects, and believe in 
them. The one point at which we can indisputably discern an 
instinctive tendency to do this is the relation of parents to 
their children. We follow the line of probability, then, when 
we look upon the sacrifice of one’s own welfare that others 
may have their rights (welfare, that is, as measured by any less 
social standard) as being, on the large human scale, the same 
thing as a parent’s insistence that each of his children shall 
have life, and liberty, and happiness. 
Our problem here, it will be perceived, concerns the instinc- 
tive basis of the love of mankind that is required by the second 
of the two Great Commandments. We call it brotherly love, 
and speak of its goal as the brotherhood of man. But what is 
brotherly love, even within the limits of the family? Is the 
bond between brothers and sisters a specific fraternal instinct ? 
The existence of such an instinct is by no means proved by the 
obvious naturalness of the affection. Consider the closeness of 
the association between brothers and sisters, then consider the 
long period through which it lasts, and finally ask what, under 
these conditions, is to be expected from the instincts nnmbered 
1 Pp, 102 f.

  HUMAN NATURE 127 
1 to 6 in our list. From these alone, under the laws of habit 
formation, we should expect a rather close group life which is 
likely to make a lifelong distinction between one’s own brothers 
and sisters and other persons. What we have to account for 
in addition is positive outgoing affection, which far transcends 
the habitual accommodations to one another that grow out of 
the instincts just referred to. That is, we have to account for 
affection like that of parent for child. What if fraternal affec- 
tion, in its most intimate phase, is the exercise of parental in- 
stinct? We cannot be mistaken in seeing this instinct in cer- 
tain attitudes of older children toward brothers and sisters who 
are much younger. We are not likely to err when we interpret 
in the same way all the rest of the sympathetic fraternal loyalty 
that springs up in domestic intimacies. Finally, the parents’ 
own instinctive attitudes act as a constant suggestion to the 
children to take the same attitudes toward one another. The 
sum of the matter is that the fraternal relation in the family 
is a highly somplex thing, and that it gets its quality of justice 
or feelingly taking the brother’s interests as one’s own, from 
the factor of parental instinct. 
From what quality of original nature comes the affectionate 
response of a child to a parent’s affection? Love begets love, 
no doubt, but how? If we had to rely upon antecedent proba- 
bilities we should guess that there is a filial instinct that answers 
to the parental. But when we analyze an infant’s earliest 
reactions to maternal care, we discover that they fall chiefly 
under the first six heads of our list together with the twelfth. 
What remains to be accounted for is filial affection or love in 
the strict sense already defined in the last two paragraphs. 
But this is the same sort of attitude that distinguishes parental 
affection. What, then, if filial affection, like the corresponding 
phase of fraternal affection, is an early manifestation of parental 
instinct? What but this is the attitude of protection and of 
succor toward a father or a mother who is weary and heavy 
laden, sick, in sorrow, injured by others, or suffering reverses 
and disappointments? Family intimacies provide precisely 
the opportunity, scarcely existent elsewhere, for small children 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 HUMAN NATURE 
to play the parent to mature persons. Small children pat and 
stroke a parent’s face or hand, and when is a little one as happy 
as when he can play parent to the whole family? A boy of 
about four years, when his mother was nursing him through 
the croup, said: “Show me just what you do for me, mother, 
so that when I have little boys and girls with croup, I will 
know what to do for them.” About six weeks later, when his 
mother had a headache, he assumed the attitude of physician 
and parent to her just as he had done to his own prospective 
children. Nothing seems to evoke filial affection as surely as 
being permitted to help father and mother. Doing things for 
a child does not touch his heart half as much as permitting him 
to do things for you !!. The conclusion is that our love for our 
fathers and mothers is of the same instinctive quality as their 
love for us. We can be good sons and daughters by letting 
free in ourselves the very thing that makes a good parent. 
A side-light upon this question may be discerned in the com- 
mon chivalric devotion of sons to their mothers, to which noth- 
ing in the ordinary relations of sons to fathers corresponds. 
This devotion probably has one of its roots in some obscure 
response to sex differences, but another part of the explanation, 
without doubt, is that the more frequent manifestation of weak- 
ness or of distress by the mother has called out, ~ by habit 
confirmed, the son’s parental instinct. 
It is not less true that love for mankind as such, to the ex- 
tent that it is anywhere realized, is an exercise of parental 
instinct. We see this clearly in child-welfare movements. 
The parent mind in us is what yearns over sick babies. This 
it is that insists, even at great expense to ourselves, upon giving 
to the next generation, through education, a better and larger 
life than we have had. It is the same impulse that hastens to 
the relief of sufferers from famine, flood, and war, and that 
takes pure joy in seeing others well fed and happy. To this, 
in the end, must we appeal for the community spirit that puts 
sanitation, education, civic beauty, and diffused happiness 
upon the plane of simple humanity, that is above all consid- 
1 Cf. Patterson Du Bois, Beckonings from Little Hands (1900).

  HUMAN NATURE 129 
erations of private advantage, either immediate or ulti:nate. 
What makes us struggle for democracy, too, is that, putting 
ourselves imaginatively in the place of the narrowed, thwarted, 
stunted lives about us, we feel toward them as we would if they 
were our own children. What we democrats demand, in fact, 
is that all men everywhere should have opportunity to grow up. 
Because all men are potentially parent-minded, the world is 
capable of being won to democracy. We can make the sacri- 
fices that this will require—sacrifices of our substance, of our 
labor, and of our aristocratic and plutocratie privileges—for 
the same reason that we can do it for our natural offspring. 
Social education requires that some instincts be sup- 
pressed. When the term instinct is used for broad, general 
qualities of human nature rather than for readiness to act in 
a specific way in a specific situation, it is possible to claim that 
no instinct should be suppressed. If, for example, we classify 
all spontaneous getting under an “acquisitive” instinct, we 
shall hold that it has some permanent value. But when we 
come to details we discover that some acquisition is just a grab- 
bing that increases in intensity if another person is seen to get 
or to be likely to get any part of the desired objects. Grabbing 
away from others goes on, too, until one accumulates more than 
one can use. In such rivalry and greed one’s relation to per- 
sons is exactly contrary to parental instinct, which delights in 
seeing another feed himself. What must be done with rivalry 
and greed in the interest of society is to suppress them if we 
can. Similarly, scorn for those who are weak, physically de- 
fective, or lacking in good looks, seems to serve no present social 
ends, but to hinder them only. 
Likewise, instinctive mastery and submission seem, though 
not quite as certainly, to be at least needless, and possibly 
without exception a hinderance to the growth of society toward 
democracy. What democracy requires is co-operation. Lead- 
ership is of course necessary, but leadership that is itself co- 
operation, a fulfilling of the will of the led, not mastery of them. 
Curbing of individual will also is required, but this again is, 
ideally, not submission to the arbitrary will of another, but. 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  130 HUMAN NATURE 
one’s contribution to a common will from which arbitrariness 
has been eliminated by making it truly a common will. These 
remarks apply to sex relations as well as to others. Instinctive 
mastery by the male, and instinctive submission by the fe- 
male, are a social evil because of their effect upon the character 
of both the man and the woman, and because of the support 
that they lend to social inequalities beyond the conjugal rela- 
tion. Conjugal affection must be democratized along with the 
other social relations. 
The instincts of hunting, anger, and pugnacity, in many 
instances, though scarcely in all, have an antisocial tendency. 
The tormenting of animals, or the killing of them for other 
purposes than food and protection, the hunting down of men in 
partisanships, persecutions, and wars, and all the purely 
destructive forms of anger and pugnacity, are obviously un- 
social in fact and in tendency. But most persons suppose that 
these instincts are sometimes useful socially, not for purposes 
of destruction, but as constituents of a rationally controlled 
good will. There can, it seems, be anger and pugnacity toward 
evil without hating the evil-doer. But how much reflectiveness, 
how much self-restraint are required to maintain this distinc- 
tion in practice! We need to be cautious lest the undeniable 
pleasure of destroying living things that we dislike be indulged 
under the specious name of “righteous indignation,” or “hatred 
of wrong,” or “standing for righteousness.” When anger or 
pugnacity separates me from any human being so that he ceases 
to have value for me, or so that the value that I theoretically 
attribute to him does not control my conduct toward him, social 
ends are not promoted, they are hindered only. If I must fight 
against something that you fight for, I must herein fight for you, 
for a better and happier you, yes, for a fellowship with you that 
is yet to be. 
The deep depravity of war, just as of enmities between in- 
dividuals, lies in the implied denial that my enemy is still my 
brother, and that I am his keeper—all the more his keeper if 
he has faults that I can help him to overcome. Herein con- 
sists the profound difference, the impassable gulf, between war 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
HUMAN NATURE 131 
and the exercise of police power. If a policeman discovers 
me in the act of picking your pocket, he does not dispose of my 
case by clubbing me. No, he brings me before a court in which, 
though I have done wrong, I still have rights which society 
protects, the very society that I have wronged. Here, in the 
calmness of reason, my relations to the welfare of society are 
determined, and also, in any enlightened penal system, my re- 
lations to my own welfare. What modern penology aims at 
is not to separate me from my fellows, but by separating me 
from my evil ways to unite me closer to my fellows. If, now, 
the policeman undertakes to settle my relations to society with 
a club, if he assumes that I am nothing as against the offended 
will of the state, if he is not my policeman, acting for me as 
well as my neighbors, he exemplifies the tooth-and-claw con- 
ception that underlies war. War, which endeavors to impose 
one national will upon another by force, must be supplanted by 
a system of world-law, world-courts, and a world-police, which 
will seek the welfare of offender and offended alike, and work 
always toward the maintenance, and if need be the restoration, 
of fellowship. This implies educational measures for suppress- 
ing our socially destructive instincts, for stopping war at its 
source in our own minds.! 
The socially constructive instincts, all of them, require 
training. Even the best natural impulses, taken by themselves, 
are uneconomical; they are not sufficiently fine for the work 
that has to be done. Maternal affection prompts mothers to 
give to infants coffee and beer as well as milk; and until this

commit the paragraph to the typesetter I have opportunity to review my 
words in the light of the actuality of the dreaded conflict. It is clear that the 
purpose of our war as defined by President Wilson takes the standpoint of 
what I have called above ‘the exercise of police power.’’ There is, in fact, a 
remarkable parallel between my conception of ‘“‘ world-law, world-courts, and 
world-police,”’ and the requirements of world-decency as he defines them.

instinct is trained it reacts in the same way to pure and to im- 
pure milk. Thorndike remarks that “the irrational impulse 
to get the sick to eat seems to prevail the world over.”! These 
examples would of themselves be convincing. The full pro- 
portions of the task of positive social training should, however, 
be faced. ‘This can be done by going carefully through our list 
of instincts, noting how, from beginning to end, they consti- 
tute the basis of possible social conduct, noé at one level only but 
at any one of many levels. This is most often recognized in 
respect to sex attraction, which underlies conduct that ranges 
all the way from brutality to saintliness. The same sort of 
analysis will show that, in the sphere of the gregarious instinct 
also we may habituate ourselves to pleasure in one type of 
society as against another. We have an instinctive interest in 
what other human beings are doing; yes, but we may acquire 
a habit of being more interested in important than in unim- 
portant doings. Here is the possibility of growing out of gossip 
into conversation! We want to be noticed by others; yes, 
but we may learn to take more pleasure in being noticed by one 
sort of persons than another. We instinctively like to be 
approved, but by training we can make ourselves unresponsive 
to praise and blame from certain quarters, and we can concen- 
trate our claims to approval upon that in us which we can our- 
selves approve. We spontaneously admire beauty, but upon 
our training it depends whether or not we notice beauty of 
spirit. We instinctively go with the crowd, but we can form a 
discriminating taste with respect to crowds, so that some of 
seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices 
we shall freely make.’’ We are ‘‘seeking nothing for ourselves but what we 
shall wish to share with all free peoples.””’ We are to work toward ‘the 
ultimate peace of the world.’’ Weare to make the world “safe for dem 
by “‘setting up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world 
such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth insure the observ- 
ance of”’. . . “‘peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and 
autocratic power.’’ ‘“‘We are at the beginning of an age in which it will be 
insisted that the same standards of conduct and of responsibility for wrong 
done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are ob- 
served among the individual citizens of civilized states.”’ 
The implication of all this is that we have before us the task of establishing 
a genuine world-police power. |

HUMAN NATURE 133 
them we do not enjoy. In short, there is not a single point at 
which our instincts are sufficient of themselves to provide for 
social progress. Blind impulse makes happy hits, of course, 
as it makes unhappy ones. What we have to do is to raise 
above chance the proportion of hits and misses. An inevitable 
part of our ethical calling is to bestow sight upon even the best 
of our instinctive qualities. 
Popular confusion between what is instinctive and what 
is acquired. How often do we hear it said of one child that 
he is “naturally” amiable, and of another that he is “ naturally” 
self-willed, the implication of “naturally”’ being that the quality 
in question is a matter of original endowment, and therefore 
unchangeable. No doubt the amiability and the self-will are 
both natural. But the popular mind does not realize that 
habit-formation (which is as spontaneous, as “natural” as 
anything else), intertwining with instinct, fixes some of the 
early instinctive responses so that they will be repeated there- 
after to the exclusion of other responses that are equally possible 
at the beginning. One’s instinctive endowment is not a walled 
lane that offers no alternatives to one’s feet, but an open trail, 
with many forks and branches, some leading into life’s swamps 
and quagmires, some onto the meadows of conventional good- 
ness, some upward to the bright peaks and the dark valleys of 
social idealism. 
Children’s dispositions are complexes of what is native and 
what is acquired. The acquired part is the habits whereby 
certain impulses, specialized by experience, are given a per- 
manent and specific direction, while other native impulses, 
unused or repressed, remain in the background, or decrease 
toward complete atrophy. Favorable or unfavorable nervous 
conditions (whether they are determined by health and disease, 
or by such hygienic matters as proper and improper feeding) 
are one fundamental factor. When nerves are irritated, and 
vitality is depressed, the range of possible happiness is limited, 
and the particular narrow range of satisfactions tends to be- 
come permanent in its narrowness. If peevishness, obstinacy, 
or screaming is what brings the child his satisfactions, of course

it becomes a habit. It is then called the child’s disposition, 
and is attributed to the stepmotherliness of nature! On the 
other hand, granted favorable nervous conditions, plus con- 
stant and abundant opportunity for mutual pleasures (the child 
with his parents and with other children), plus steady, unrelaxing 
arrangements whereby individualistic reactions are prevented 
from bringing pleasure—granted these things, any child will 
acquire an amiable disposition. Unthinking persons will attrib- 
ute it to some mystery of original nature, whereas, as settled 
disposition it is a result of habit formation, a product of social 
training, whether intended or unintended. 
The superinstinctive factors of our social nature. The 
inventory of man’s original social capacities includes, as was 
noted a little way back, certain general tendencies toward the 
organization of a self, and toward the increasing integration of 
men in social institutions. The special instinct-factors that 
have just occupied our attention are not a mere collection of 
zoological specimens—odd forms, odd voices, odd ways—each 
living its own life without regard to others. Our instincts are 
more like the multiplicity of a city. 
When we look from the upper stories of a tall office-building 
far down into streets thronged with incessantly moving men, 
our first impression is likely to be that of the utter irrationality 
of what we behold. It seems to be a meaningless coming and 
going, like dust particles carried in air currents hither and 
thither. Yet what we see is not a chaos of impulsive acts, but 
acts organized into great systems—systems for feeding and 
clothing the people, for teaching the children, for distributing 
news, for healing the sick, for protecting the public health, 
for restraining those who lack self-restraint. Moreover, if we 
look into each of these moving particles of humanity, we find 
its own diverse elements at least partly organized, each man be- 
ing an individual self, not walking at random, but going some- 
whither that he desires and approves. There is not a man 
in the throng who has not to some extent taken notice of his 
instinctive impulses; there is not a man who is not holding some 
of these impulses in leash.

HUMAN NATURE 135 
To become individual selves is a part of our original nature. 
It is a part of our original nature to form societies not merely 
on the basis of instincts that flow in the same direction but 
ako on the basis of recognized selfhood. Now, these two, the 
formation of a definite self and the formation of societies, are 
not in reality separate processes, nor are the results separate; 
rather, we have here two phases of a single process, two phases 
of a single achievement. For the achievement of a self is possi- 
ble only in and through recognition of other selves, and what is 
distinctively human in society is precisely the organization of 
regard for individual selves as finalities. 
Movement, effort toward this achievement, is natural to 
man—as natural as fleeing from a lion or pursuing a deer. Here 
is something in human nature that is superinstinctive, some- 
thing that reflects upon, regulates, and uses instinct, and this 
something is in the profoundest possible sense both individual 
and social.' 
The notion that human nature does not change. What 
has now been said as to the variability of habit within the scope 
of the instincts, and with respect to the naturalness of the 
correlative growth of self and society, has an important bear- 
ing upon that ogre’s castle of social pessimism: “ Your ideals 
won’t work as long as human nature remains what it is.””, For 
now we can answer: “ What do you mean by human nature?” 
The problem is by no means ended when we have recognized 
the fact that the instincts are hereditary, permanent, and fun- 
damental to character. We must bear in mind, in addition, 
first, that no instinct is strictly univocal, but that every one has 
indefinitely many possible modes of expression that vary through 
a large scale; second, that habit forming is also human nature, 
and that it makes possible the fixing in human life, in an individ- 
ual and through the generations by training, of either better 
or worse instinctive ways; and, third, that to become a self- 
criticising self, and to form self-criticising societies, are also a 
1T content myself with this brief statement here because I touch upon 
it in other places in the present work, and because I have discussed it in my 
Psychology of Religion (see Index under “ Social Aspects of Religion,"’ and 
chap. XIV). 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
    
136 HUMAN NATURE 
part of human nature, so that nature herself provides for 
taking the side of social aspiration as against what is unsocial 
in our instincts. “As long as human nature remains what it is,” 
therefore, we may expect indefinite transformation of social 
life toward the highest ideals that we can conceive. The in- 
dividual who in full health and vigor lies down under the weight 
of ancient wrong, saying that it is just human nature, does 
thereby make himself a critic of that nature, does thereby justify 
the opinion that he could hate ancient wrong a little harder, and 
that he could summon his neighbors not to surrender but to 
keep up the fight. 
What if, moreover, self-conscious contemplation of our de- 
sires should give rise to new desires? How often, as a matter of 
fact, something like this certainly does occur. When I was a 
boy I thought it would be sport to shoot a meadow-lark—Il 
thought so until a dead lark lay in my hands. I can see even 
now how its head hung limp when I lifted the beautiful body. 
At that instant one desire died and another was born. I saw 
myself having my desire, but defeated just because I had 
succeeded. I advanced to a new point of view, a new standard 
of values, a new arrangement of instinctive likes and dislikes. 
It makes little difference whether or not the new attitude can 
be classed under one of the instincts, for | came to myself, to a 
new self, to an unprecedented desire. 
Society attains new mass desires in similar ways. When, 
rising above crowd action, and holding up our social habits to 
relentless scrutiny, we say: “This is our work, the result of 
what our community has done or neglected to do. Is this 
what we desire?”’ then we cringe before our old community 
self, or, as the case may be, we are inspired to excel ourselves. 
In increasing instances a community survey awakens community 
self-consciousness, and then and there men begin to support 
one another in having desires that they simply did not have 
before. 
Social reconstruction is provided for in the nature of man. 
This is the reason why the likes and dislikes of men change so 
markedly between savagery and civilization. We simply could 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  
HUMAN NATURE 137 
not enjoy some of the things that brought intense satisfaction 
to our early ancestors unless in some way we could be gradually 
trained backward. We are sunk enough, God knows, yet 
wants are better than they were. By giving attention to what 
we really want, and by training the impulses that we really 
prefer, we shall develop still other wants and the ways of satis- 
fying them.! 
1In chap. XIII of my Psychology of Religion, I have discussed this question at 
ereater length.

CHAPTER XI 
CHILDREN’S FAITH IN GOD 
Children’s notions of God are acquired as other notions 
are. To the question, How do little children get their notions 
of God? there is a simple, obvious answer: By instruction and 
hearsay, just as ideas of angels, fairies, hobgoblins, Santa Claus, 
and of historical personages are acquired. This “acquiring” 
of an idea includes, of course, a complex reaction. Language 
has no power to transfer a thought from one mind to another, 
but only to stimulate a mind to think. The meaning of the 
term God, and of any affirmation about him, has to be con- 
strued by imaginative combination of thought materials derived 
from the child’s previous experiences. Nor does the idea, 
once started, continue “in one stay,” but items from the child’s 
growing experience are read into it and out of it. 
The idea of God varies, therefore, from child to child, and 
from day to day, according to instruction or hearsay, the mean- 
ings that words (such as father) have already acquired, the 
characteristic experiences of the child (especially his experience 
of persons), and his usual methods of association and of infer- 
ence. A boy not yet four years old who had had difficulty 
with “bad boys” in his back yard arranged there a house for 
God, saying: “He'll keep the bad boys out; nobody else can.” 
This “house of God”’ was merely a large doll-house with some 
additions of the boy’s own devising. When he was four years 
and eight months old he spontaneously made a drawing, in 
which God and Santa Claus, a Christmas tree, flags, home, and 
toys, which include a locomotive engine on a railroad-track, 
all figure. It is evident that this child, putting his own con- 
struction upon the words of others, had built up a notion of 
God far different from what his elders intended. On the other 
138 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
CHILDREN’S FAITH 139 
hand, the direct influence of instruction seems to appear in his 
argument with a playmate who had asserted that “If you do 
anything in a dark room God can’t see it.” “Yes, he can!” 
was the reply, “ He can see you even in a dark room. He looks 
down through the stars, and I’m not going to do anything to 
get caught!” 
Another boy of about the same age gave the following ob- 
jective evidence of the Christmas story that he had recently 
heard. Of his own motion he devised for the entertainment of 
his parents and some guests a dramatization of the Star in the 
East. First, extinguishing other lights, he lighted a candle, 
which was to represent the sun. Then he placed an apple for 
the moon, and extinguished the candle in order to show that 
night had come. Finally, announcing that he was God, and 
was going to bring in the Star of Bethlehem, he marched into 
the room, bearing some sticks crudely fastened together with 
the apparent purpose of representing the conventional picture 
of a star’s rays. 
As an illustration of how the child’s own social experience is 
read into his thought of God, the following case is instructive. 
“Mamma,” said a boy a little older than those just mentioned, 
“do you know what I’m going to do the first thing when I get 
to heaven? I’m going to run up to the Heavenly Father, and 
give him a kiss!”’ Obviously this feeling-reaction to the idea 
of a Heavenly Father is due in part to experience in a human 
family. 
Suggestion and imitation in childhood religion. Thus, 
both the fact that children have ideas of God, and the varia- 
tions of these ideas from our adult notions are easily accounted 
for. That children really believe in God thus conceived is also 
obvious enough. They believe what they are told, and in this 
respect no difference is discernible between belief in God, in the 
Sand Man, or in the Black Man. The influence of mere sug- 
gestion upon children’s beliefs is possibly more extensive and 
more prolonged than we ordinarily suppose. On a certain occa- 
sion, having told to a group of children a story of how I had seen 
a chipmunk store food, which included a muscat grape, upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  140 CHILDREN’S FAITH 
the branches of a fir-tree, I remarked: “So there was a green 
grape growing upon an evergreen tree!’’ One of my listeners, 
a girl of about eight years, came to me some days afterward 
to inquire whether the grape really did grow upon that tree! 
Just as children readily accept our instruction, so they will- 
ingly imitate our religious acts. The evening prayer, grace 
before meat, participation in public worship—these, under 
favorable conditions, are well liked; they require no com- 
pulsion. But they cannot, without further evidence, be re- 
garded as clear signs of piety. Nevertheless, even such imita- 
tive acts may have immediate social value, and ultimate relig- 
ious value. In a certain family that was accustomed to have 
brief devotions at the breakfast-table there was a girl who was 
still too young to commit the Lord’s Prayer to memory. One 
morning, just after she had triumphantly learned to count up 
to eight, she joined her voice with the others when the Lord’s 
Prayer was repeated by saying loudly: “One, two, three, four, 
five, six, seven, eight. ... One, two, three, four, five, six, 
seven, eight!”’ I would hesitate to deny that even this crude 
participation in social worship contributed to religious growth. 
For the social situation was a religious one, and the girl’s re- 
action, bare though it was of definite religious ideas, enriched 
her membership in the group, and brought her mind nearer to 
the meaning of the function then being performed. 
These facts—the credulity of children’s beliefs, the desultory 
associations that cluster therein, and the imitative origin of 
children’s religious acts—go far toward accounting for the am- 
biguous or even negative attitude that largely prevails among 
adults with respect to the religious life of children. Besides, 
we are just now reacting against two types of religious work 
with them, the formal or catechetical type, and the revival or 
conversion-experience type. If these are the only practicable 
ways of promoting spiritual life in children, then indeed we must 
look for skepticism as to genuine spiritual life much before 
adolescence. It is not enough to show that children accept 
the idea of God, join in religious practices, and make an emo- 
tional response to revivalistic suggestion. The deeper question 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  CHILDREN’S FAITH 141 
concerns a life of faith properly so called. This implies not 
merely belief and imitation, but also emotional satisfaction, 
and motivation of conduct without feverish excesses—in short, 
a personal realization or experience in a natural life. Does this 
exist in the small child? 
Is there a special religious instinct? If children—adults, 
too, for that matter—are to have vital religious experience as 
distinguished from doctrinal assent, imitation, and emotional 
forcing, it must doubtless have a basis in instinct. Religious 
educators therefore have compelling reason to inquire whether 
there is a specifically religious instinct, that is, a universal in- 
born readiness to respond in some specific religious manner to 
particular, definable situations. If there is, then the work of 
religious education consists fundamentally in creating just 
these situations and placing children in them. On the other 
hand, if there is no specific religious instinct, but if religious 
response consists rather in a particular direction and organiza- 
tion of the various instinctive capacities for social living, then 
religious education does not have to create situations or invent 
special stimuli, but to utilize in appropriate ways the every- 
day human relations of the child. The alternatives may be 
roughly suggested by asking whether religious experience is 
apart from, or a part of our experience of one another.! 
It is not possible in this place to go farther toward answering 
this question than merely to recite conclusions from the general 
psychology of religion. Of the naturalness of religion there is 
of course no question. It is not an invention; it is not an im- 
position of some upon others; its early appearance in the race, 
its universality, its persistence, and the way in which it is 
interfused with all sorts of human affairs, are conclusive on this 
point. This interfusion gives us, in fact, a clew to the sense 
in which religion is natural. It appears historically as a living 
out, intensely and insistently, of the interests that seem im- 
portant, particularly the interests that gather about the life 
1If my purpose were not merely to identify the thing, but also to define 
{t with philosophical precision, I should of course suggest that our religious 
experience may possibly be, not a part of our experience of one another, but a 
whole, of which our human fellowships are parts or phases. 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  142 CHILDREN’S FAITH 
of men in societies, and as a tendency to organize and unify 
these interests. It is not an aside, or a luxury, or any other 
sort of addition to the common life, but just life most deter- 
mined to fulfil itself to the utmost. There is here no trace of 
an instinct that functions by itself, but only of a tendency 
within the instincts taken as a whole.! 
This general conclusion can be made more specific by reverting 
to the analysis of man’s social nature in the last chapter. What 
is most characteristic of the religious consciousness is closely 
related, on the one hand, to the general tendency to become 
personal selves in a society of such selves, and on the other 
hand to the parental instinct, which plays such a distinctive 
part in individuating us and socializing us. Faith in God has 
impulsive roots in desires for a sufficient and certain supply of 
the things that men want, in the instinct that causes a man to 
identify his own wants and welfare with those of another, and 
in the human way of taking our ultimate values as our ultimate 
reals. What is most significant for our present discussion is 
that gods have been to their worshippers not only a security 
for goods of all kinds, but particularly a security for the goods 
that are socially sought and enjoyed, and that gods have been 
likewise a spontaneous and last term in fellowship or social 
unity. In the divine the social principle itself achieves such 
objectivity and finality as the existing level of social life can 
appreciate. The tribal god, the national god, and the Universal 
Father, all have this relation to our fundamental social impulses. 
The child’s own parental instinct furnishes a natural 
basis for early appreciation of divine fatherhood. On the 
surface of the matter it is plain that whatever capacity a child 
has for responding to the Christian evangel of the fatherhood of 
God is at least parallel to filial attitudes toward one’s earthly 
parents. We are now ready, in view of the last section, to say 
that it is not parallel, but identical. Moreover, in view of our 
analysis of filial affection in the last chapter, it now appears 
that children can make a vital response to the Christian God 
1 Readers who desire to pursue these considerations further will find them 
fully developed in my Psychology of Religion, especially chaps. [V and XIX. 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
CHILDREN’S FAITH 143 
because they themselves possess parental instinct. The yearn- 
ing of the father toward the child, and the child’s appreciation 
of this yearning are qualitatively the same. It is in the im- 
pulse to father somebody that the child’s Christian experience 
begins. We love God only when we take his point of view, 
and we can take his point of view only through some experience 
of our own in which we actually exercise godlike interest in 
another. 
In order to teach children of kindergarten age the love and 
care of the Heavenly Father, the Sunday-school teacher of 
to-day is likely to use as a part of her material the care of 
father-bird and mother-bird for their offspring. How does 
bird lore lead toward religion? Does the mind of such small 
children construe divine fatherhood analytically, by means of 
an analogy with feathered parenthood? Or, does an induction 
from different instances of parental care lead the heart up to 
universal fatherhood? Far different from either of these is 
the emotional logic of the kindergarten age. What happens is 
that the child instinctively assumes a parental attitude toward 
the helpless birdlings that have been brought to his attention, 
and thereby, nascently entering into the fatherhood purpose, 
he grasps the meaning of divine love. 
It is easy, and educationally most appropriate, to awaken 
in small children a sentiment of gratitude to the Heavenly 
Father. What, then, is gratitude? Since it is an attitude 
that one can take toward another who is older, stronger, and 
not suffering, it appears at first sight to have no connection with 
the instinct that leads a child to fondle dolls and pet animals 
and smaller children. But A. F. Shand has shown that gratitude 
involves some realization of what the kindness of a benefactor 
has cost him, together with desire to requite this cost.! Grati- 
tude is not mere jubilation; it contains also a tender element. 
This tenderness, as our discussion has shown, and as McDougall 
holds,? originates in parental instinct. McDougall is of the 
opinion that moral indignation originates at the same point.

-P-A-G-E-156
144 CHILDREN’S FAITH 
No doubt it will seem odd to trace pity, gratitude, indigna- 
tion, longing for justice and equality, and a child’s fondness for 
dolls and pets to one and the same source, even that in us that 
makes us see worlds in the smile of our own offspring. But 
thither the facts lead. They are of immense consequence for 
all moral and religious education. For in them we find not only 
evidence of capacity for moral and religious life in early child- 
hood, but also the particular kinds of seed for which the young 
mind is ready. 
Other instincts, of course, have a part. Fears drive the child 
to sheltering arms. Curiosity blends with the rest. G. E. 
Dawson infers from children’s questions that the “instinct for 
causality ”’ is a principal factor in child-religion,’ and Earl Barnes 
looks upon the insistent who’s and why’s of the young mind as 
signs of a theological interest.2 This interpretation seems, 
however, to be made under the influence of the outworn dogmat- 
ism that confuses religion with doctrine or philosophy. When- 
ever the causal interest is central in the child mind, the appro- 
priate category is science rather than religion. This is the 
parent’s opportunity to start the young intellect upon a cor- 
rectly scientific analysis of the world. Religion gains nothing, 
but loses much, through the well-intentioned answer, “God 
did it,” to questions that we adults answer to ourselves in terms 
of science.’ 
It has been said that children must first think of nature 
after the fashion of mythology. Dawson even makes animism 
an instinct of childhood.‘ If this be so, the precept, “Never 
1 The Child and His Religion (Chicago, 1909), p. 38. 
2 Studies in Education, I1, 1902, p. 287. 
* To Professor Dawson's precious collection of children’s questions, I should 
like to add this one from a boy of about five: ‘‘ Mother, who was my mamma 
before you were?"’ Lack of space prevents me from discussing the incau- 
tious use of the term “‘instinct’’ in Dawson's book, as “‘instinct for causality’’ 
and “instinct of immortality.'’’ The naturalness of child religion, moreover, 
seems to mean for him that religion is preformed, even to specific beliefs, 
whereas the growth of mind is not primarily from one set of definite ideas to 
another but from the indefinite toward the definite. On this point, see Irving 
King, The Psychology of Child Development (Chicago, 1903), p. 243. An 
analysis of Dawson's cases will show that, though the children in question re- 
ceived little or no formal religious instruction, they were nevertheless under 
the influence of the religious ideas of their elders. 
‘Op. cit., pp. 32 ff. 
   
-P-A-G-E-157
CHILDREN’S FAITH 145 
teach as true anything that must afterward be unlearned,” 
is unwise, perhaps impossible of application. But I find no 
adequate evidence that small children are incapable of employ- 
ing the causal category in the same manner as adults. Least 
of all do the facts indicate that there is a definite stage of 
spontaneous animistic belief in Tylor’s sense of animism. 
Rather, we find a continuous mental movement from indefinite 
toward definite ideas, and from emotional thinking toward 
abstraction and objectivity. Not, then, from experience of 
nature, mythologically conceived, but from the experience of a 
present social reality in the family, should we expect the Chris- 
tian idea of God to grow. 
A child can, to use Bushnell’s words, “grow up a Chris- 
tian, and never know himself as being otherwise.’”’ What- 
ever be the case with other religions, the Christian religion, 
which finds the whole meaning and destiny of man in divine 
fatherhood and human brotherhood, is the flowering of a par- 
ticular instinct that is active from infancy onward. To Ter- 
tullian’s argument that the soul is naturally Christian we may 
now add that the child is naturally Christian. To the Chris- 
tian idea of the All-Father the response (unless the child has 
already been wounded and scarred by the unparental conduct 
of others) is positive, free, and vital. Children love and trust 
him; they struggle to obey him by kindly conduct; they desire 
to help him in his work; they are grateful for his gifts. This 
is Christian experience. 
It is a tender thing, easily distorted, easily blighted. It 
must have human fellowship in order to flourish. Only in and 
through some human godlikeness that sustains what is parental 
in us does any of us know the Father. Here is the deep meaning, 
for childhood as well as for maturity, of the surpassing love 
wherewith Jesus faced an unloving world. The spirit, the acts, 
many of the words of Jesus appeal to little ones, to what is 
elemental in them. Just as the Jewish children who heard him 
say: “Let them come to me, for the kingdom of heaven belongs 
to such as they are,” must have clung to him and nestled in 
his arms, so the children of to-day, imaginatively realizing him, 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 CHILDREN’S FAITH 
make him their actual leader, their helper, who saves them from 
their own unsocial impulses. The church, as far as in its re- 
lations to children it is really the church of Christ, makes the 
same appeal to children and receives the same kind of response. 
The church belongs to children just as their fathers and mothers 
belong to them; and children belong to the church just as they 
belong to families. That is, ideally they belong to the church, 
from the standpoint of Jesus they belong to it, from the stand- 
point of their own social capacities they belong to it. But 
these capacities are as sensitive as they are beautiful; and there 
are contrary capacities, too; and habit-forming begins at 
birth. In order that a child may grow up a Christian and never 
know himself as being otherwise he must have co-operation from 
those who have the spirit of Christ. That is, the child must 
have social education upon the Christian plane. 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
CHAPTER XII 
THE RELIGIOUS LIMITATIONS OF CHILDREN 
The respective educational consequences of a theory of 
moral continuity in child growth and a theory of moral dis- 
continuity. The view of child nature that has now been 
sketched is different from certain opinions that are widely held 
at the present moment. ‘The last two chapters have shown that, 
though antisocial instincts are active in the early years, socially 
constructive ones also are present, and that even the par- 
ticular instinct out of which spring the finest and most difficult 
things in social progress begins its functions in infancy. Here 
we found natural capacity for entering into the great and fun- 
damental motives of the Christian religion, fatherhood and 
brotherhood, and therefore a natural basis for Christian educa- 
tion. 
If this view is well founded, there is no necessary break, in 
moral quality, between the life of an adult Christian and that 
of a child who receives Christian nurture. The necessary dif- 
ference between them concerns their respective range of experi- 
ence, firmness of habit, and extent of foresight. An adult who 
is already well trained knows better how to be kind to a dog, a 
baby, a tuberculous family, a foreigner, a laboring man, a capi- 
talist, a wife. With this wider knowledge of human relations 
there goes, of course, the possibility of profounder emotional 
appreciation of the character of God. Moreover, the well- 
trained adult Christian has so many times resisted his unsocial 
instincts, and indulged his social ones, and he has so often ex- 
perienced the joy of Christian fellowship, that habit forming 
has borne its fruit in the weakened power of some temptations, 
the actual extinction of others, and relative ease in carrying 
147 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
148 CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 
high impulses into effect. This difference between childhood 
and maturity is great, but it is not a moral break. To attain 
Christian maturity, a child needs only to go on exercising more 
and more broadly, steadily, and intelligently certain impulses 
of childhood itself. 
But some voices are saying that childhood is essentially ego- 
istic, and that genuine unselfishness must wait for adolescence. 
If this be true, we must postpone religious education in any vital 
sense until adolescence, while through childhood we allow 
motives to grow that must later be counteracted. This would 
be a saltatory education—education by a leap into society as 
contrasted with continuous growth within society as a member 
of it. The widest-spread doctrine of this type is the recapitula- 
tion theory that is taught by G. Stanley Hall and his pupils. 
Another instance, which it will be convenient to discuss first, 
is Ames’s chapter on “ Religion and Childhood.”’? 
Taking religion to be identical with “the fullest and most 
intense social consciousness,”? which is about equivalent to 
the consciousness of the socially maturest persons, Ames finds 
children profoundly deficient in capacity for religion. He 
asserts: (1) That up to two and a half or three years human 
beings are non-religious, non-moral, and non-personal; (2) That 
it is impossible for a child under the age of nine to pass in any 
considerable degree beyond the non-religious and non-moral 
attitude;*> (3) That the child has no “religious nature”; 
(4) That “The social feeling of adolescence is original, inner, 
and urgent,’’’ and that in adolescence “Keligion arises nat- 
urally, being an inherent and intimate phase of the social 
1In some of my earlier writings I emphasized the notion that a child is not 
a diminutive adult, but something qualitatively as well as quantitatively dif- 
ferent. Doctrinal systems, I said, even though abbreviated and expressed 
in words of one syllable, do not fit. A small child’s spontaneous interest 
does not go out to the Trinity, but to dolls, dogs, hobby-horses, or a game 
of tag. Moreover, some human relations, as that of conjugal affection, 
one does not appreciate until the sexual instinct ripens. Finally, adult stand- 
ards of right and wrong do not fit children, and attempts to make them fit 
do injustice by reason of the gap between rewards and punishments and 
anything that the child can understand. In this sense I still maintain that 
a child is not a diminutive adult, but qualitatively different. But this does 
not imply the kind of break in instinctive social capacities, and in socia} 
education, that is in question in the above paragraph.

consciousness.” “For the individual, religion originates in 
youth.’’? 
If all this be true, man has a religious nature, original, inner, 
and urgent, which clearly makes its appearance with adoles- 
cence. It is denied of young children because of their sup- 
posed lack of capacity for social response.* If, now, we should 
discover that childhood is not set off from adolescence by any 
such social incompetence, it would follow that children also, 
in their measure, are religious by original nature. In a subse- 
quent section I shall endeavor to show that the instinct of sex, 
which is the distinctive basis of adolescent phenomena, is not 
equal to the social task, which is nothing less than the social 
transformation of the mind, that Ames and others lay upon it. 
Meantime I would set over against the doctrine of the social 
incapacity of childhood the evidence, already adduced, of the 
early appearance of parental instinct. 
The recapitulation theory is a special and recent form of an 
idea, long held, that there is some sort of parallel between child 
life and the “ childhood of the race.” That there is a consider- 
able degree of similarity between them is clear. Both the race 
and the individual show a movement of mind from immediate 
ends toward remote ones; from immediate data of sense toward 
thought structures of greater and greater complexity; from 
the impulsiveness of instinct and of crowd action toward self- 
control and social deliberation; from a narrower to a broader 
range of social regard. A consequence for education is that 
young children take the freshest interest in, and are best trained 
by, objects and processes that correspond in simplicity and in 
sensuous appeal to the objects and processes with which early 
man occupied himself, and that as children grow older their 
ability to be interested in the complexities of civilization grows 
also. A child of six takes voraciously to Bopp’s descriptions 
of primitive man’s struggles with dangerous beasts; how old 
must one be, the teacher has to ask, before the struggles of the 
Roundheads with the Cavaliers arrest and hold attention?

’ Ames’s overcaution, not to seem to attribute a religious ‘‘instinct’’ to 
primitive men, suggests the possibility that I have taken too literally his state- 
ments concerning adolescence. See pp. 49, 50. 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
    150 CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 
The special form that the recapitulation theory gives to this 
old idea is as follows: (1) The theory asserts that the growth 
of the individual mind shows a succession of definite forms that 
correspond in motive, content, and order of emergence to defi- 
nite stages in racial evolution; (2) That this succession in the 
individual is not determined by anything in his environment, 
such as his associations, but is predetermined as a set of suc- 
cessively ripening instincts; (3) That the proper mental and 
moral food for each period of child growth is to be gathered 
from the level of the instinct then in action, not from later and 
higher levels of culture.! 
The popular, and here and there the literary, interpretation 
of recapitulation runs to the effect that children, or at least 
boys, are different from adults in the same way that savagery 
is different from civilization, savagery being interpreted in terms 
of its coarseness and of its relative disregard for the pains and 
the pleasures of men and of animals. 
Before examining the grounds for this theory, let us note 
its educational implications. At each period of growth, says 
the theory, feed the particular instinct that is then dominant. 
The child’s goodness at the time, and his progress toward 
mature goodness, are to be measured by the fulness with which 
he enters into the spirit, the aims, and the characteristic activi- 
ties of the lower order of society that his then dominant instinct 
refiects. That is—if we press the point to the utmost—we 
are to educate children for family, church, and state, not by 
enlarging as much as we can children’s present participation 
in them, but by withholding and postponing common life on 
these levels. Social segregation of children with children, and 
of adults with adults, would then be the preliminary condition 
of educational efficiency. If we ask how, then, children are 
ever to acquire an interest in the higher social organizations 
and standards, and how adjustment to these standards is to 
be effected, the answer is that adolescence brings a spontaneous 
impulse to something like a conversion from egoism to altruism. 
This leap into the new life will take place through the innate,

  CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 151 
internal forces of the individual, it is assumed, if only appro- 
priate material for these forces to act upon is present. 
If nature has provided for social continuity in the growth of 
a child, then the process of social education can be sketched as 
follows, with the contrasting consequences of the recapitulation 
theory stated point by point. 
(1) Theory of continuity: Social education first sees to it that 
the child is provided with wealth of human association, association 
with adults as well as with children. To this kind of experience 
various instinctive responses are made by the child, one or more 
of them social in a finally valid sense, that is, in the same sense 
in which the best conduct of adults is social. The teacher picks 
out these socially valid responses, and endeavors to give them such 
a distinctive place in the child’s experience (by means of satisfac- 
tions associated with them) that they will have a permanent in- 
fluence upon his character. 
Theory of recapitulation: Provide the child with plenty of things, 
animal pets, and other children; this is the chief and essential 
educational service that adults can render at the beginning. 
(2) Theory of continuity: 'The teacher now has the task of pro- 
moting repetition of these particularly wholesome responses, and 
of preventing repetition of the contrary ones. Therefore condi- 
tions are so arranged that discomfort accompanies the latter, and 
satisfaction the former, especially shared satisfactions, and these 
conditions are steadily repeated as often as the situations that 
tend to call out the responses recur. The result is the forma- 
tion of certain social habits, and suppression of unsocial instincts 
by lack of exercise. 
Theory of recapitulation: The instincts are given right of way, 
with no such careful selection by the teacher. For it is held that 
the exercise of an instinct on its own plane makes it not more 
attractive, but less so, at the next stage of growth. Let the 
teacher provide plenty of material for the expression of the in- 
stincts that are dominant. 
(3) Theory of continuity: As the child’s social contacts widen, 
his social responses become more and more complicated, and his 
capacity for continuity in social relations increases. The teacher 
carries into each fresh situation the same principle of selection 
and of habit forming as before, but attempts to organize the whole- 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 
some responses in the form of more and more systematic and broad 
co-operation—co-operation of children with children, and of 
children with adults. Therefore the policy of the teacher is to 
admit the children to a part in adult social enterprises. 
Theory of recapitulation: Organizations of children with chil- 
dren on their own plane are sufficient for social education. Let 
children settle their social relations to one another by the clash 
of opposing instincts. 
(4) Theory of continuity: Since the problem of society is to 
produce free individuality rather than mechanized conduct, and 
also to improve society itself rather than repeat its own perform- 
ances, the teacher does not stop with a set of habits that con- 
form to a set of ethical rules, but goes on to awaken reflective 
intelligence with respect to what one is doing, why it should or 
should not be done, and how it can be improved, that is, made 
mutually more satisfactory. Thus, to instinct and habit, analyti- 
cal reason is added, and genuinely voluntary purposes are formed. 
Material for this analysis, which proceeds by comparison, is drawn 
not only from child life and from cruder stages of adult society, 
but also from the best that is in contemporary social institutions. 
Thus, intellectually as well as affectively (in respect to satisfac- 
tions and dissatisfactions) the child is kept in growing fellowship 
with his elders. 
Theory of recapitulation: The child’s social insight will grow 
most certainly and normally if he is kept in rich intellectual 
fellowship with culture epochs of a lower order until the middle or 
later years of adolescence bring him face to face with the society 
that he is about to enter as a full member. 
(5) Theory of continuity: The analysis of situations and of 
responses is so guided that it not only transforms instinct acts 
already habitual with the pupil into voluntary purposes, but also 
leads the pupil to ask what he himself really wants, and so to 
imagine and desire ideal good. An ideal is a more distant goal by 
reference to which we judge our particular purposes, and correct 
them. The process of idealizing, when it is not arrested in mere 
sentimentality, goes on to the identification of one’s own weal 
and woe with the fate of the ideal, and thus makes the purpose 
of progress a constituent or modifier of all other purposes. Society 
thus trains her pupils to re-create their educator. 
Theory of recapitulation: The upspringing of moral self-con- 
sciousness will be a part of the broad emotional agitation that 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 153 
ushers in the maturity of the sexual instinct. Youth will dream 
dreams, and see visions, and acquire reforming fervor as a phase 
of instinctive adolescent longing. 
The contrast between these two conceptions of the attainment 
of moral self-consciousness is not slight. One of them makes 
it an achievement, the other makes it an eruption of volcanic fire; 
one makes it a discriminating attitude that accompanies analysis, 
the other makes it an emotional unrest that has yet to become 
acquainted with its appropriate objects; one puts at its dis- 
posal, in the whole gradual process of its upspringing, the moral 
experience of the race, the other lets the individual meet himself 
in the isolation in which fears, and conceits, and hasty choices are 
born. 
This is the logic of the contrasting theories. To what extent 
the practice of teachers follows the logic of either theory is 
anuther matter. Let there be no misunderstanding as to the 
purpose of this analysis; it aims merely to make the elements 
of the problem stand out unmistakably. Another possible mis- 
understanding may grow out of the fact that the analysis is 
presented in the form of a numerical series. These five points 
in the theory of continuity do not represent so many successive 
steps, to be taken at successive periods of the child’s growth, 
but five aspects of the sort of stimulus that society would 
continuously provide under the supposition that the social 
growth of the child can naturally be continuous rather than 
broken. ‘The recapitulation theory implies that at each stage 
of growth the child leaves behind the self-and-society that was 
his at the preceding stage. But the theory of continuity, 
holding that the social growth of mind consists in defining 
what was at the outset relatively indefinite, in stabilizing what 
was relatively unstable, in differentiating what was relatively 
simple, and in bringing impulse under the control of permanent 
choices, implies that the child carries his self-and-society along 
through the years, enriching it as he goes. 
The positive service that the theory of recapitulation 
has rendered to social education. There is no mistaking the 
fact that, coincident with, and under stimulus from, the spread- 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 
ing doctrine of recapitulation a great awakening began with 
respect to methods in the moral training of boys, and to a slight 
extent of girls. In the boys’ departments of Young Men’s 
Christian Associations, in Sunday-school classes and clubs, 
in the general boys’ club movement, and in camps and schools 
for boys, we witness something that has not only the zest of 
newness, but also the zest of an obvious reality, or corre- 
spondence with life itself. I shall raise a question by and by 
as to the validity of some of the tendencies that have appeared, 
but without doubting that the new training is better than the 
old in point of freedom and spontaneity, in point of initiative 
and constructiveness, in the number of its contacts with nature, 
in its care for physical well being and for play, and in point of 
co-operation and of training therein. 
Moral training of the individual through present group 
life on the natural level of the pupil—this is now axiomatic 
among educators of boys. It has become axiomatic with the 
practical workers largely because, under the influence of the 
glittering recapitulation theory, they undertook, as perhaps no 
teachers had ever undertaken before, to get the pupil’s point 
of view, see through his eyes, feel with him, act with him. 
There was nothing new, to be sure, in the doctrine that the 
teacher must bend himself to the pupil’s natural interests. 
But here was proclamation of a supposed law of the child’s 
successive interests, a law that implied that children’s social 
interests are even, for the time, opposed to those that are habit- 
ual with the teacher. Here was a challenge to the teacher 
to stretch his imagination and his sympathies as nothing in 
the general doctrine of interest and apperception had hereto- 
fore required him to do. Moreover, the study of boys’ gangs 
as an instance of the supposed recapitulation results in an 
attempt to use the gang type of sociality as an educational 
agency. In order to use it, the leader had to become a member 
of it, and be obedient to laws not of his own devising. 
This is too brief a statement to represent all the wide-spread 
effort to enter actively and sincerely into the realities of chil- 
dren’s social motives, but it is sufficient to indicate ways in   
-P-A-G-E-167
  
CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 155 
which the recapitulation theory has had an unquestionably 
vitalizing effect upon moral training. We need not stint our 
recognition of this effect if we go on to inquire whether we have 
reached the end of the matter. Is it not possible that if we 
rigorously apply the recapitulation theory we shall fix children 
in immature social motives? Granted that fellowship is the 
basis of social education, does it follow that fellowship is possible 
only on the basis of children’s crude instinctive social inter- 
actions, and not also on the basis of adult enterprises? The 
teacher must reach down, no doubt; is it certain that children 
should not be expected to reach up? 
Does the social life of children instinctively recapit- 
ulate the social evolution of the race? The only sense in 
which an answer can here be attempted is that of an enumera- 
tion of points involved, with some indication of sources in which 
the positions here taken are discussed at greater length. 
(1) The theory took its start from supposed traces of bodily 
recapitulation in the embryo. But “‘the view ... that em- 
bryonic development is essentially a recapitulation of ancestral 
history must be given up.’’# 
(2) With reference to the brain in particular it does not hold. 
*“Man’s brain in general follows in its growth a course enormously 
unlike that by which it developed in the race.”? 
(3) Where comparison of the two mental series, racial and men- 
tal, can safely be made, ‘‘what little is known is rather decidedly 
against any close parallelism of the two.” ® 
(4) The sex instinct, which presents in its late ripening the su- 
preme case of a social acceleration of the individual that is both 
marked and fairly universal, ripens early in the race, but late in 
the individual. 
(5) Further—and this has peculiar weight against those who 
have relied upon adolescence for evidence of recapitulation— 
whereas in the race the sex instinct does not appear until it is physi-

ologically employed, in the individual it appears, and begins to 
influence social groupings, long before reproduction is possible. 
(6) Parental instinct, as we have seen at length, does not co- 
incide, in its appearance and growth, with procreation or with 
capacity therefor. Here again an instinct that has tremendous 
social significance appears earlier in the individual series than in the 
racial series. 
(7) If any one should hold that, even though other evidence for 
recapitulation be leaky, common observation of boys shows them 
to be little savages anyhow, whereas in adolescence they attain to 
something like civilization, the following answer could be made: 
“The” boy, who figures so largely as the living demonstration to 
the popular mind, is a socially neglected boy. He is the boy on 
the street; or the boy in a boys’ school, removed from normal 
family relationships; or the boy who goes to extremes because he 
has been misunderstood and mishandled; or the boy who has 
simply lacked sufficient fellowship with older persons to show 
what he is socially capable of. Social capacities do not sprout 
in a vacuum, much less under thumb-screws. Nor does a child’s 
possible social reach appear until he has something to reach 
toward. We need sorely to realize that what to reach toward can 
be revealed to a boy only through acquaintance with those who are 
further advanced. A boy who lives in a good house surrounded 
by wholesome things, the roof of which covers also refined and 
affectionate parents, may nevertheless be socially neglected, that 
is, lack opportunity to take the part that he is capable of taking 
in the doings of his elders. Over against the results of all these 
kinds of neglect stands a multitude of boys who have grown up 
in co-operative fellowship with adults, and as a consequence have 
conducted themselves in such a civilized way that they have not 
attracted attention to themselves. In short, the argument from 
current observation unintentionally picks its cases, and then attrib- 
utes to original nature social limitations that arise from deficien- 
cies in boys’ social opportunities. 
(8) The evidence from current observation that is adduced 
in support of the theory of recapitulation is derived almost ex- 
clusively from boy life, scarcely at all from girl life. Why? In 
part, we need not doubt, because girls, being kept in closer con- 
tact with adult life in the home, and having more opportunity 
to co-operate with a parent in important duties, develop earlier 
the social capacities that are common to boys and girls. 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 157 
The social significance of adolescence. That adolescence 
brings changes in the child’s social capacities and spontaneous 
interests, and that these changes are of momentous consequence 
for social education, no one will question. But that undue 
reliance has been placed upon the socializing influence of the 
instinct that now ripens may be asserted without hesitation. 
Adolescence offers fresh, unique opportunity for social educa- 
tion; but instinct does not do the’ work of educating. The 
opportunity is unique because: (1) There is instinctive effort 
to please persons of the opposite sex. This regard for others 
may be extended beyond the courtship process.!. (2) The fact 
of loosing oneself from dependence upon parents to begin in- 
dependent life is of itself an assertion of individuality; it may 
become an incentive to reflective weighing of life’s ethical 
alternatives; it may be the occasion of great choices. (3) The 
general state of restlessness, excitement, and general emotional 
susceptibility (as for beauty in nature and in art) makes it 
comparatively easy to acquire new interests and enthusiasms, 
which may ibe highly idealistic and social. Adolescence tends 
to make the human soil mellow, but mellowness of soil does 
not determine whether the harvest shall be wheat or tares. 
(4) More or less parental tenderness, obviously instinctive, 
mixes with sexual instinct in the attitudes of lovers toward each 
other. On this compound instinctive basis family life on the 
highest ethical plane may be built, and this life may radiate into 
community organization and into world society. 
What an opportunity is this for social education! But 
the same thing that makes it an opportunity for education 
makes it also an open road to evil. The period of adolescence, 
and the magnetism of its characteristic instinct, fasten upon the 
individual the worst faults that the race has developed. That 
criminality here gets its chief entrance into the mind is a serious 
enough fact, but it is not the most serious one. The profound- 
est and the most prolific of all evils in the world is the selfish 
use of the sex instinct. 
1 Under the term ‘‘courtship process’’ I include not only the consciously 
intended preliminaries to marriage, but also the preceding years of taking an 
interest in, and making oneself interesting to, persons of the opposite sex. 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 
There is no need to dwell upon the phases of this evil that 
are prominent in the public mind. There are in addition mo- 
mentous phases of it that the public thinks nothing about. 
Even aside from all question of social vice, social idealisms 
that sprout in childhood and blossom in youth are largely 
shrivelled by conjugal experience following an undisciplined 
adolescence. Selfishness in this relation means arrest of 
social capacity, a hardening of the personality that is likely 
to affect all the relations that one has with one’s fellows. It 
inevitably affects the children in the family, though they know 
nothing of its existence. For selfishness in the conjugal rela- 
tion is per se the drying up of tender regard for the personality 
of another, and tender regard springs from parental instinct. 
One cannot henceforth be a whole parent to one’s children, 
much less train them for future parenthood. 
The canker of this selfishness spreads directly also, not merely 
through one’s children, to relations between persons in the larger 
social units. Tender regard for the personality of another, 
which is none other than justice in one’s soul—sthis, wrought 
into habit by self-discipline in the most intimate association of 
husband and wife, forms an excellent background and prepara- 
tion for the recognition of personality in business and in civic 
affairs, while absence of this soul’s justice at home bodes ill for 
the world outside. Granted that there is no absolute guarantee 
that a social quality that is habitual in one human relation 
will be transferred to different relations; granted that we are 
bundles of inconsistencies; nevertheless it is a safe assump- 
tion that what my family is to me can easily affect my valuation 
of the family life of my employees, and that in the by-and- 
large this effect will occur frequently in a large society. Justice 
in the conjugal relation will tend, in the long run, to inject 
domestic considerations into the wage problem, the problems 
of civic betterment, the problem of industrial disputes, and 
the problem of war. 
When we consider all this in addition to the vice and criminal- 
ity that get their impulse from the adolescent condition of 
mind, we shall see that incalculable evil and incalculable good 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 159 
depend upon the direction that is given to the instinct that 
comes to maturity in this period. The sex instinct is not self- 
directing toward the ends of just society—this is evident. 
Like all other useful instincts, it requires training. It requires 
training more, possibly, than any other, and not merely in the 
way of restraint because of its possibilities for evil, but also 
in the way of positive development into a defined and noble 
social purpose. Reliance for the right social fruitage of adoles- 
cence is not to be placed upon even the fine spontaneities of 
youth, but upon educational foresight and skill. 
The social limitations of adolescence appear, too, from the 
fact that it accomplishes its full instinctive work under various 
social systems, under any system, in fact, that permits be- 
tween the sexes the relations of courtship and marriage. The 
primary impulses of youth find outlet under any form of govern- 
ment; at every level of social organization, from the savage 
tribe to the great modern state; under social institutions that 
range through the Mole scale from slavery to industrial democ- 
racy. What kind of society we shall have depends in no appre- 
ciable degree upon instinct as such, but upon the place 
it occupies in a gr lex of instincts, habits, assumptions, 
and ideals. 
The relation of adolescence to childhood’s social habits. 
The irruption of a fresh instinct that profoundly stirs the whole 
psychophysical organism offers a specially favorable oppor- 
tunity for the basal educational process of habit making and 
habit breaking. One notices things not noticed before, reacts 
to them, experiences satisfactions and dissatisfactions of new 
varieties, and presto! the youth has “taken to” fiction, poetry, 
history, pictures, natural scenery, sport, good clothes, educa- 
tion, business, politics, or what not. Most certainly of all, 
he takes to some social circle, which may easily be one unknown 
and undreamed of in his childhood. 
So rapid and so radical are the shiftings of adolescence from 
the personal groupings of childhood, and so positive is the de-      
        
   
1 The significance of adolescence for religious conversion will be considered 
in the next chapter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 
sire not to be a child any longer, that the observer can easily 
get an impression that what occurs is not only a social quicken- 
ing but also a social break with the individual’s past. This 
impression is deepened by reactions made by youths who en- 
counter parental opposition to the laying aside of childhood’s 
dependence and subordination. 
Before we commit ourselves to the opinion that adolescence is 
such a break, however, we should remind ourselves that a peace- 
ful river, if it is obstructed by a dam, may break the barrier 
and become a destructive flood. Many a parent, blunderingly 
preferring that his child should remain a child, and resenting 
the individuality and the new social attachments that youth 
brings, produces the social refractoriness that he blames upon 
the hot blood of youth. That is, the break in such cases is 
not brought about by growth into adolescence any more than 
by resistance to such growth. 
Educators, moreover, should have no .illusions as to the 
relation of the laws of habit to the adolescent period. It is 
a truism when one speaks it, and yet it needs to be said, that 
provision must be made for forming, cial habits (for some 
social connections will be made an but the particular 
sort of social habits that is required b democracy toward 
which the Christian purpose aspires. Adolescence can produce 
snobbery more easily than democracy. In fact, no small part 
of social education at this period consists in widening out the 
purposes of groups already formed upon the basis of a narrow 
and exclusive regard of a few for a few. Here again the in- 
dicated educational method is admittance of the young to social 
groups and to social practice that are more mature than youth 
itself would spontaneously devise. 
The theory of recapitulation, when it asserts that childhood 
is essentially egoistic, and that genuine altruism must wait 
for adolescence, seems to assume that selfish habits, made 
strong by exercise through the whole of childhood, somehow 
become null and void when one passes from childhood to youth. 
Is this true? We have already seen that the sexual instinct 
is not, of itself, unambiguously social except in a narrow sense;    
    
   
 
-P-A-G-E-173
CHILDREN’S LIMITATIONS 161 
it can easily mingle with itself other impulses so as to form a 
complex whole that is tender and beautiful as well as strong; 
but it can also be cruel, hard, blind, savage, weak. The par- 
ticular complex of social attitudes that are henceforth to prevail 
is not at all predictable from anything in this one instinct. 
Just as in childhood, so here, the personality is formed by a 
multitude of particular experiences that bring multiform in- 
stinctive satisfactions and dissatisfactions. The bonds that 
are now formed with one’s fellows are bonds of habit as well as 
of instinct. 
Not only must habit forming still go on; the whole of it 
will be affected by preadolescent social experience. Nothing 
occurs that can at a stroke wipe old selfish habits off the slate. 
On the face of the matter, how can one suppose that instinctive 
attraction for the opposite sex will reverse an already firm habit 
with respect to one’s own sex? Even a youth’s attitudes toward 
the opposite sex are like the householder’s treasure, which con- 
tains things new and old. The kind of mother a boy has 
associated with for mo an a dozen years; the way his father 
has treated her, and ay she has responded to this treat- 
ment; the sort of sex. ctions that have been current in the 
boy’s social enviro ; the amount and the qualities of the 
comradeship that he has had with girls; the treatment of women 
to which he has been witness everywhere, all these leave in his 
mind a sediment so firm that it seems to him to be bed rock, 
nature itself. 
These social assumptions are not necessarily affected by his 
new emotions toward girls and women. He can adore a female 
without stopping to ask whether women should be treated as 
equals or as inferiors; and he can actually treat the adored one 
as an inferior without ceasing to adore. He can even magnify 
the virtue of his affection on the ground that he, a superior 
creature, bestows himself upon an inferior! By the comple- 
mentary process, too, girls can come to prefer such male atten- 
tions to any other. The whole instinctive adolescent process 
can run its course between the fences of almost any social 
svstem. To change the figure, the social attitudes of a youth     
   
     
   
 
-P-A-G-E-174

are not like a garden bed of plants just breaking through the 
soil, and all springing from freshly planted seeds of one and the 
same variety, but like a bed in which annuals, biennials, ana 
perennials mix, the tender shoots standing side by side with 
plants that are fibrous and stiff from years of growth. 
It follows that educational methods that segregate children 
in such a way as to narrow their social experience tend toward 
permanent arrest of social growth. It may well be that for 
particular purposes boys should practise co-operation with boys, 
and girls with girls, but a general policy of sex segregation, 
placed within the actual historical setting of the present, can- 
not fail to leave permanent marks of social impoverishment 
upon both sexes, an impoverishment that makes both of them 
unready for certain essentials of democracy. Again, the segre- 
gation of younger children from older ones, and the segregation 
of children of any age from adult companionship and from 
adult thought and enterprise, leave some social capacities un- 
developed, and harden the remaining ones into a dominant life 
attitude. : 
Of course gradation of pupils 
for certain purposes, but the nature of r gradation is easily 
misconceived. Pupils are often grad wn to that which is 
easy for them instead of being graded up toward the most 
advanced of their interests; or the average performance of an 
age group is taken as a satisfactory standard for each member 
of it, whereas there are wide variations within such groups; 
or an assumption is made that the interests and capacities of 
an individual go up like an elevator, all at once, whereas their 
ascent is uneven, like that of a band of children frolicking up a 
stairway. If the possibilities of co-operation between younger 
and older are found in a given case to cover only a narrow area, 
we must not conclude that co-operation within this narrow area 
is educationally unimportant. This particular readiness of a 
child may be an open road toward a valuable social habit; ex- 
perience at this point may awaken further interests; the joy 
of achievement here may raise the level of all his work.

  CHAPTER XIII 
THE STRUGGLE WITH SIN 
“Sin” is a social conception. When I was a boy I was 
taught that sin is a relation, not between me and my neighbor, 
but between me and God. Subsequent reflection has led me to 
regard the distinction here made as not valid. The intimacy of 
the two Great Commandments to each other is too close. The 
dwelling place of the Highest is not apart from, but within, 
the brotherhood, which is the family of God and the kingdom of 
God. I find neither psychological, nor ethical, nor meta- 
physical footing for the idea that I can have relations with God 
in which he and I are isolated from all other society. My 
very being as a conscious individual is bound up with that of 
my fellows; a divine judgment upon what I am and upon what 
I will to be is per se a judgment upo reciprocal human re- 
lationships. Nor can I judge God o ise. The only mean- 
ing that I can give to his supreme goodness, the only ground that 
I can assign for bowing my will to his, is that he enters into the 
human social process more fully, more constructively, than I do. 
The need for any such term as sin lies in the fact that we men, 
in addition to constructing the human society in which God 
and men are both sharers, also obstruct it and in some measure 
destroy. We must now as educators face the fact that we do, 
individually and collectively, oppose, resist, and undo our own 
work of social upbuilding. We must inquire into the ground in 
human nature for the slowness, the delays, the backsets, and 
the defeat of ourselves by ourselves that are so obviously a 
part of the process of establishing the democracy of God. 
The lodgment of sin in the individual and in society. 
In the light of our previous analysis it is possible to go at once 
to an inventory of the negative factors with which we have to 
reckon. 
          
    
  164
-P-A-G-E-177
SIN 165 
(1) We have anti-social instincts. 'They have been enumerated 
already. What needs to be noted in addition is that they are 
not so many isolated impulses, but factors that by various men- 
tal processes are built into the personality and into the struc- 
ture of society. 
(2) The exercise of anti-social as well as of social instincts is 
pleasurable. The satisfaction of grabbing; of greedy possession; 
of venting envy, jealousy, and wrath; of hunting, fighting, and 
mastering, as well as of sexual license—this satisfaction is what 
makes all of them hard to resist. Only psychological blindness 
and educational folly could teach that the pleasures of sin are 
a delusion. Some sinful pleasures are evanescent, it is true, 
but not all. Some bring pain in their wake, but not all, and 
there are great possibilities of foresighted calculation and pre- 
vention of disagreeable consequences. Social impulses have a 
way of disturbing the dreams of selfishness, it is true, but then, 
social impulses can be quieted ! 
(3) The laws of habit formation are indifferent to social values ; 
therefore a child who | vences satisfaction in his anti-social 
acts has in himself no zon from anti-social habits. A par- 
ticular child may be so situated that the constructive social 
instincts, being called out oftener and yielding greater pleasure 
than the anti-social ones, counteract them. Such situations 
the educator deliberately arranges, and he also attaches dis- 
satisfactions to the anti-social reactions. But there is nothing 
in the child’s own habit-forming mechanism that does this for 
him. In the absence of help from others, or of some fortunate 
chance mixture of conditions, he forms anti-social habits as 
spontaneously as social ones. As a matter of fact, education 
has not yet perfected its control of the habits of even one 
child. Every one makes anti-social instinctive reactions, ex- 
periences pleasure from them, as a result repeats them with 
added vigor, and thus becomes a victim of habits which educa- 
tion has to devise methods for breaking. 
(4) One’s habits of conduct reflect themselves in one’s social 
thinking, sometimes as a formulated premise the truth of which is 
assumed, sometimes as a control of attention whereby social facts 
     
   
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 SIN 
of some sorts are eoticed and evaluated, while social facts of other 
sorts are not. Thus, in a perfectly natural way, anti-social prin- 
ciples and rules of conduct mix with social ones. A thing tends 
to be defined in our thinking by that which we habitually notice 
init. A pine-tree is not the same sort of thing to a lumberjack 
as toa John Muir. Just so, “human nature” is, in the thinking 
of each of us, that which we habitually notice in our fellows. 
Now, what we habitually notice is that which we have to take 
account of in carrying out our own purposes and lines of con- 
duct. Many of us not only initiate our plans from our own self- 
ishness, but in the execution of them awaken self-regarding 
impulses in others. Thereupon we judge that human nature 
is rootedly selfish! You will find no one so doggedly certain of 
this as the man who makes profits by stimulating other men’s 
cupidity. On the other hand, you will find no one so certain 
- of the inherent nobility of human nature as those who make 
opportunity for such nobility to show itself. 
Thus it is that anti-social instincts, confirmed by habit, be- 
come a basis of anti-social thinking. | Probably most persons 
suppose that the order of psychologieal dependence is the re- 
verse of this, at least in part. Justifying their habits by their 
thinking, they imagine that their habits are a product of rea- 
son. Socrates, indeed, held that the reason that we do wrong 
is that we do not clearly see what is right. Aristotle, on the 
other hand, took the position that practice is itself one of the 
sources of insight. Without going into some fine questions 
thus raised, we may say that psychology justifies, on the whole, 
the tendency of Aristotle’s thought at this point. Thoughts 
about what is worthy of approval do not begin until we have 
already approved and condemned many things. It is by reflec- 
tion upon these judgments, already made, and by reaffirming 
some of them, that we arrive at principles for future conduct. 
Sin gets control of our thinking, then, as follows: First we 
experience enjoyment in some anti-social reaction; the enjoy- 
ment stimulates to repetition of the act; a habit is thus started; 
we cherish the memory of the experience; then relate it in 
thought to other things so as to make a system, and to provide 
      
    
   
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  
SIN 167 
for unlimited repetition; this thought system in turn becomes 
a habit, and now, behold, the unsocial principle that has been 
derived from instinct is henceforth taken as an axiom of social 
life. 
(5) Anti-social instincts, habits, and ways of thinking are 
intrenched in socval institutions, in customs, and in public opin- 
won. Society expects. selfishness from individuals, and to some 
extent actually rewards zt. If we look at society in historical 
perspective, we perceive that it is, on the whole, an evolu- 
tionary process in which we are working out the beast, and 
training ourselves to have regard for what is humane. ‘The or- 
ganized faults that are in society did not, of course, originate 
in any fall from a perfectly organized common life; they are 
simply parts of our instinctive endowment that, confirmed by 
habit and by being made premises for thought, restimulate 
themselves from generation to generation by informal education. 
The social conditions into which a child is born actually train 
him, though unintentionally for the most part, to be selfish 
within these conventional limits. It is true that society praises 
unstinted generonitys Ht admires, though with more reserve, 
the fine and sturdy justice that asks for only a democrat’s share, 
and endeavors to secure as much for others. But it takes for 
granted that these will be exceptional. A general low average 
of self-seeking is socially expected. Success, in common par- 
lance, connotes getting something for oneself, and the mass 
pays homage to success. At the crucially important point of 
sex morality, young men who are willing to make the fight 
for character cannot yet count upon effective social support 
from either men or women. 
When a morally thoughtful parent or teacher witnesses the 
generous and trustful. impulses of childhood, or the glowing 
idealism of youth, he sighs to think of the disillusionment that 
is to come when, “ getting into the world,” one meets its hard- 
ness, and is in turn hardened. The withering of ideals as the 
dews of life’s morning are dried up by the heat of competition, 
of greed, of political self-seeking, and of licentiousness, is the 
continuous tragedy of education. Sin, that is to say, has social 
     
   
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 SIN 
organs by which it is transmitted through the generations, 
positively preventing the young from even attempting to follow 
out in maturity their best social impulses. Generation after 
generation social capacities that are certainly here are wasted 
by society itself. 
Sin, then, is rooted in instinct, confirmed by habit, and prop- 
agated by informal social education. Let us have no illu- 
sions with respect to the cost of democracy. Education for 
democracy has to face, not only unsocial traits in the child’s 
original nature, but also a social system that brings them out, 
sustains them, justifies them in popular thinking, and rewards 
them when they “succeed.” 
The possibility of success in educating for democracy lies in 
the fact, first of all, that in our selfishness we are not at one 
with ourselves, but are stirred to unselfishness also by instinct, 
and by the habits and institutions that have arisen therefrom, 
and second, that selfishness and brotherliness do not have 
equal capacity for organizing themselves. Love of one another 
produces a degree of co-operation, which is the massing of hu- 
man energy, that is impossible to ered Hcensousness and the 
lust of power. Selfishness tends to disorganization and in- 
effectiveness in the long run. Temporary equilibrium may be 
attained in some cases by balancing the selfish interest of one 
person against that of another, but permanent stability is not 
attained in this way. Have we not learned the lesson that 
the massing of individual self-interest into a group selfishness is 
the way of class struggles within a nation, and of wars without? 
Massed selfishness tends thus to be anarchic, and to pull itself 
down in the ruin of its competitors. But love builds and de- 
stroys not. Unwise love may destroy, but it is the unwisdom, 
not the love, that is responsible. What the friends of democ- 
racy have to do is to put administrative experience and scientific 
analysis into the service of the brotherly purpose, and to train 
children in the resulting concepts and methods as well as in the 
love motive. 
The psychological approach to children’s faults. What 
has just been said as to the extent and the firmness of the lodge-    
     
   
-P-A-G-E-181
  SIN 169 
ment of sin awakens echoes of the old controversy over total 
depravity. Echoes only; for our problem is different, and our 
approach to facts is different. Belief in total depravity was a 
dogmatic belief, that is, one accepted upon authority that was 
supposed to be that of divine revelation. The procedure was 
a priori, the conclusion being first accepted, and facts then being 
used merely to illustrate and confirm it. Illustration and con- 
firmation, too, consisted, not in analyzing children’s conduct, 
or in tracing it to its causes, but in contrasting it with a fixed 
standard of adult or even divine perfection, and then taking all 
deviation from the standard en bloc as defect of child nature. 
Even though less deviation had been found, or none at all, 
the doctrine would have stood nevertheless. 
The whole landscape is changed as soon as we go at the 
facts in the spirit of science. We recognize in children multi- 
tudes of reactions that are social in the same sense in which 
some of our maturest Christian conduct is social. We perceive 
other reactions that are anti-social in the same sense in which 
some of our mature badness is anti-social. But we perceive 
also that neither sort of reaction has as yet the woody fibre of 
adult character. Moreover, we see that children’s ways are not 
simple, as the theory of depravity makes them out to be. We 
do not have just “good children” and “bad children” to deal 
with, but personalities already complex because of the influence 
of preceding experiences as well as because of the variety of the 
instincts that are always at work. If we are to understand these 
personalities, we must analyze their conduct into its elements; 
we must see the relations of these elements to one another and 
to the particular stimulus that awakens each of them on each 
occasion; and in all this we must persistently trace each specific 
item to an equally specific cause. The following questions, 
which may appropriately be raised when faulty conduct, or con- 
duct that seems to be faulty, occur, will illustrate this psycho- 
logical approach. 
  How much in the conduct that is regarded as faulty is a resuit 
of physiological conditions such as imperfect nutrition, digestive 
disturbances, adenoids and mouth-breathing or other diseased 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
170 ° SIN 
conditions that lower the vitality, defective sense-organs, and 
nervous instability produced by fatigue, lack of sleep, over- 
stimulation, or other causes? 
How much of the faulty conduct is an imitative reproduction 
of the conduct of others, whether children or adults? How much 
of it constitutes an attempt to adjust oneself, protectively for 
example, to persons who are stronger? 
How much of it is a matter of habit, and how did this habit 
arise? Note the distribution of the child’s pleasures heretofore. 
Has he repeatedly experienced pleasure in acts of this kind, and 
if so could his elders have controlled conditions so as to deprive 
such acts of their pleasurable quality? What satisfactions have 
been provided for conduct of opposite social quality? In short, 
have his elders arranged conditions heretofore so that social acts 
on his part have regularly brought satisfaction, and anti-social acts 
discomfort ? 
What is the situation that called out this particular unsocial 
act? Our reactions do not occur in a vacuum, but in response to 
specific incitement. What are the specific elements in the situa- 
tion that the child was reacting fo, and in particular what was 
each of these elements to him at the time? Do not define the 
situation merely as it looks to an adult; do not define it in merely 
general terms, but make sure how the particular features of it 
looked to this child at this time.! 
What are the instinctive roots of the reaction? Avoid for the 
time being all such blanket or cover-up terms as badness, naughty 
child, selfishness, wilfulness, obstinacy, disobedience, heedless- 
ness, untruthfulness, cruelty, and guilt and innocence. Find what 
specific impulses were in play at the moment and immediately 
before it, and see how each responds to some particular incitement 
in the situation. 
1A child of six was told by his mother to perform a certain small service 
that would take him temporarily from the room. Hoe started to comply, 
but paused inside the room, and he remained unmoved even by the second 
command. A third command brought this rejoinder: ‘‘But, mother, I 
shall miss the story!’’ For at the moment he was a member of a conversa- 
tional group in which a story was just then in progress. The mother, promptly 
perceiving that she, rather than the boy, had strained the mother-child re- 
lation, gave permission to remain to the end of the story, whereupon the 
child cheerfully performed his duty. What would have been the educa- 
tional effect if the mother had insisted upon instant compliance regardless 
of the elements in the situation to which the child was at the moment respond- 
ing? How can we expect to make children social minded by insisting that 
xe are right when in fact we are blundering? 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  SIN 171 
It will then at last be time to ask which of these impulses, 
if any at all, needs to be suppressed. We shall often find that the 
chief difficulty is in an immature application of an instinct that 
has permanent value. 
Analysis like this usually discovers that the chief factor in 
the faulty conduct is some physiological condition or else some 
previous and continued failure of the child’s elders to provide 
conditions favorable for the growth of social habits and of 
social intelligence. Even the nervous causes of children’s 
unsocial conduct are most often a product of adult neglect. 
The “depravity” that the child exhibits, therefore, is com- 
monly not that of his own heart, but that of remediable faults 
of adult individuals and of adult society. 
Educational guidance of self-approval and self-condem- 
nation. Though the causes of a child’s misconduct be thus 
traced to us his elders, the misconduct is nevertheless his own, 
and he needs emancipation from it. His act is bound to leave 
some deposit in the self that he is now forming. The educa- 
tor’s task is to see that childish faults, whatever their cause, 
are so handled as to leave a socially constructive deposit. The 
fact that a child is not “really bad” does not imply that he 
should be let alone. In some instances, doubtless, the best 
thing that can happen is that his misconduct should be mini- 
mized and forgotten, especially misconduct that involves no 
immediate danger to others, and misconduct that is not in 
serious danger of becoming habitual. But in the by-and-large 
some realization on the part of the child himself that something 
is wrong, and that it must be corrected, is most important both 
for constructive social habits and for constructive social think- 
ing. Ifa child who is already able to communicate by language 
is merely wheedled or coddled into being amiable, the best 
that can result is a blind habit, probably a habit of waiting for 
the wheedling or the coddling, whereas he needs to grow in self- 
reliance, in self-guidance, and therefore in discriminative judg- 
ment upon his own conduct. This implies that: 
(1) Things to be done and things to be avoided must be defined 
an the child’s own mind with sufficient clearness to enable him to 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 SIN 
know whether or not he has acted correctly. This means that 
there must be rules, but it does not imply that rules are to be 
imposed by authority that to the child must seem arbitrary. 
In some matters, especially those that concern health and physi- 
cal safety, rules must be enforced whether the child understands 
the necessity of them or not. But every effort should be made 
to have every requirement, as far as possible, a mutual under- 
standing between the child and his elders. Moreover, rules 
must not be so difficult as to discourage efforts to obey. Rather, 
rules should be made so easy that the child will have the joy of 
meeting the standard and of triumphing over his own weakness. 
To children, as to adults, the consciousness that one knows 
just what is expected, and just how to meet the expectation, 
gives a sense of power.! 
(2) The child must be made aware that other persons, if possible 
both children and adults, approve acts of his that comply with the 
standard, and disapprove acts of his that violate it. Every child 
is entitled to such social support and correction for his judg- 
ments upon himself. Social approval and disapproval hold 
his attention to the point, enable him to look farther ahead, 
and to some extent help to keep the mind objective and to 
counteract self-sophistication and self-importance. The power 
that others thus have over us by strictly psychological means 
is elemental. Our response to the approvals and disapprovals 
of others is instinctive and emotional. Here is natural educa- 
tion, the power of which is little less than marvellous. Chil- 
dren as young as four years who persist in passionate attacks 
upon playmates in spite of repeated physical chastisement by 
parents have been known to struggle for self-control and to 
achieve it as soon as their playmates unitedly expressed their 
attitude by withdrawing from the passionate children’s so- 
ciety. 
Here lie the instinctive roots of the sense of guilt, and in 
general of what is popularly called conscience. Whatever 
1**How do you do, M.?"’ said some neighbors to a very small boy who 
was playing in the front yard. He answered: “ Pretty well, thank you,’’ and 
instantly ran into the house to ask his mother whether he had made the cor- 
rect reply. 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  
SIN 173 
gensitiveness we attain toward abstract right, or duty, or ideals, 
or God, takes its rise in sensitiveness toward the approvals and 
disapprovals of human beings. The range of this influence 
has no natural limits. The most exalted sense of obligation 
is psychologically continuous with the inner impulsion that 
makes us conform to social expectation in such trivial matters 
as the style of our shoes; and the self-approval of a good con- 
science is similarly related to the puffing up of ourselves when we 
learn that one of our thousand ancestors ten generations back 
was distinguished for something or other! Obviously a power 
like this needs to be used by the educator with discrimination. 
Both the objects that are to receive social approval and dis- 
approval, and the emotional intensity of the experience of 
social opinion must be regulated. Hence: 
(3) These approvals and disapprovals must be so expressed 
that the attention of the child is kept upon the grounds thereof, 
that is, the thing that is good or bad, and why it 1s 30. What he 
needs is to form a like opinion, or to see some fact in a new light, 
yes, even to desire something that he did not desire before. 
If, when he is condemned, he fixes his mind upon the disapprov- 
ing persons, he may resent their attitude because it hurts him. 
He then condemns their condemnation instead of condemning 
the act that they disapprove. He may even stiffen himself 
in his misconduct by associating his discomfort with the dis- 
approval instead of with his own fault. Moreover, the emo- 
tional effect of condemnation, especially if it is not tempered 
to the child’s individual sensitiveness, may easily be depres- 
sion and discouragement, paralysis of action, the withering of 
initiative. Here, again, the persons who condemn get them- 
selves between the child and his proper goal. 
When he meets approval, as well as when he meets dis- 
approval, something depends upon the direction of his atten- 
tion. If he does not think of the grounds of the approval, but 
rather forms a mental association between his own enjoyment 
and the approvers, he will indeed be drawn to them in a sort of 
fellowship, but the attachment will be that of the clique, not 
that of a generous sociality. Cliquism consists essentially in 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 SIN 
admiration for persons without discriminating what is admi- 
rable or otherwise in them. If discrimination were practised, 
the traits that are really likable in the members of the clique 
would be found outside as well as inside it, and unlikable traits 
would be found inside. 
The sum of the matter is that the educational effect that 
is to be sought from social approvals and disapprovals, whether 
from other children or from adults, should not be the strength- 
ening of purposeless social likes and dislikes, but increase in the 
child’s intelligent co-operation with other children and with 
adults for specific objective ends. 
(4) Condemnation must not be administered so often or made so 
emphatic, and approval must not be so rare, that the child becomes 
convinced that he is really and rootedly bad, and accepts himself 
as such, or concludes that misconduct is not a serious thing after all. 
The approvals and disapprovals should be of such a kind, and 
so distributed, as to awaken in him a discriminating judgment 
upon the tendencies of his conduct, a realization that there is 
something for him to struggle for, and a hopeful attitude in 
the struggle. Joy is the handmaid of vigor; depression con- 
spires with weakness. If frequent repetition of condemnation 
does not bring depression, it brings nevertheless another evil. 
As the skin defends itself from undue pressure by becoming 
thick and callous, so constant fault-finding renders the mind 
insensitive to its faults. The child must be trained to notice 
differences; therefore his elders must do so. They must ex- 
press their appreciation of even feeble efforts toward improve- 
ment, and they must so habitually show their confidence in 
him that his habitual notion of himself will be that of improve- 
ment. ‘This policy fits the spontaneous interests of children. 
They know that they are children; they aspire to grow; they 
know that they are faulty; they like change; they are proud to 
become stronger both mentally and physically, and they are 
quite capable of the joy of self-conquest. What a pity that our 
own insensitiveness to the child’s capacities for changing him- 
self should create conditions that dull these capacities instead 
of using them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  
SIN 175 
(5) In order to educate for democracy, there must be free reciproc- 
aty of approvals and disapprovals between children and their elders. 
We cannot make democrats of children by treating their judg- 
ments as of no account. Merely beating down another will, or 
flattening it down by constant pressure, whether the will of a 
nation, or of a man, or of a child, is the mark of an autocracy 
that is bent upon perpetuating itself. A child does not increase 
in virtue by absolute submission to anybody or anything. Not 
training in such submission, but practice in intelligent, volun- 
tary co-operation, is the thing that will make democrats of 
children. 
This principle is violated in self-governing groups of children 
whenever the public opinion of the group suppresses individual 
judgment, or leaves no scope for making it effective. The prin- 
ciple is violated by adults whenever, in their relations with a 
child, they assume to be infallibly right. The assumption is 
grotesquely untrue anyway; it is always untrue; the wisest 
parent or teacher is wise only in spots, and no one is competent 
to locate with precision the boundaries between his own com- 
petence and his own incompetence. 
Even when the judgment of an adult is precisely right, it 
should not be merely imposed upon a child. The way to make 
the child a democrat is to make him a convinced and therefore 
free participant in true judgments. Children must be encour- 
aged, then, to weigh what the educator says and does. Amend- 
ments proposed by children are always in order; that is, the 
educator must be sincerely willing (not merely make a pretense 
of being willing) to reconsider and modify his own plans. The 
formation of a genuinely common will by deliberation—this is 
the problem of democracy not only in election campaigns and 
in the halls of legislation, but also in every schoolhouse, in 
every home, and in every church school. 
This will involve children’s approval and condemnation 
not only of what we invite their judgment upon, but also of 
what they take it into their heads to have a judgment upon. 
One of the things in which they will take the keenest interest 
is our own personal conduct. Here, as well as in child life, they 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
176 SIN 
will find objective material in which they can discover and de- 
fine moral differences. Here they will find fellowship in their 
faults as well as in their virtues—that is, if we adults have the 
truly democratic humility, the high educational wisdom, to 
let children help us in our moral struggle even as we help them. 
This is democracy in moral education, and it is moral education 
toward democracy. 
Socialization by means of punishment. What has been 
said of social disapproval, which is a kind of punishment, con- 
tains almost everything that is essential in a general theory 
of punishment except certain warnings as to what it is not. In 
the strict and proper sense of the word, to punish is to express 
disapproval by means more emphatic and generally more pain- 
ful (though not always so) than words. The disapproval, the 
personal relationship, is of the essence of it. Punishment, then, 
is the use of pain as a means of improving the child’s social 
attitudes. The test of it in any instance is the contribution 
that it makes to the formation of a genuinely common will of 
the deliberative type. If it puts persons farther apart instead 
of bringing them closer to one another, it not only fails to be 
socially educative, it becomes anti-social education. 
Much that is called disciplinary punishment is condemned at 
once by this test. Here belong: 
Punishing in anger or as a means of relieving one’s own irrita- 
tion. 
Punishing to even up things, under the barbarous theory of 
retaliation—if you hurt us, we will hurt you. A refined form of 
this theory holds that abstract justice requires that wrong be ex- 
piated by pain, and that right be rewarded by happiness. Here 
the presupposition is that each individual will act upon purely in- 
dividualistic motives. Such punishment tends to intensify such 
motives. It separates the punished from the punisher instead 
of uniting them. 
Punishment that compels to the performance or the avoidance 
of a particular act without regard to the relations between per- 
sons that are involved in the whole matter. When the punisher 
steps into the situation he makes the personal factor prominent,

whether he intends to do so or not. He may imagine that he is 
merely adjusting the child to the proper use of material things, 
or to playmates, whereas he is also changing the relation of the 
child to himself and to other adults. Unless this change in per- 
sonal relations is a wholesome one, the punishment is to be con- 
demned. 
In view of these strictures one may well ask whether, then, 
any punishment can be socially constructive. Must not the 
deliberate infliction of pain inevitably separate persons even 
though it secures the performance or the avoidance of a par- 
ticular act? The disciplinarian, whether parent or teacher, 
should not flinch at this point. The cement that binds individ- 
uals into society is ultimately the satisfactions that they have 
in one another’s presence. Something to be enjoyed in common 
is the genuinely constructive factor, and the only one, in any 
part of social education. All that the infliction of pain can 
possibly do is to clear the way for increased social enjoyment. 
Here, then, is the proper test and control of all punishments. 
Under some conditions pain deliberately inflicted can, as experi- 
ence shows, heal a child’s mind of one or another social defect 
just as truly as the painful process of filling a tooth may stop 
toothache. Let us note some of these conditions: 
When a child is carried away by some excitement of the moment 
so that he is unable to use his judgment, as when hilarious play 
becomes dangerous or cruel, a moderate pain inflicted in good 
nature may break the spell, “‘clear the air,” and restore him to 
himself, a self that he actually approves and prefers. 
Young children often produce pain in others without quite 
realizing the fact. Inflicting some similar, but harmless, pain, 
with appropriate explanation, may be the most effective cure.! 
What is past and gone cannot be corrected; it can only be used 
to secure some future good. ‘The reason for punishment is not 
past misconduct or present perversity of will, but the happier

future that punishment may bring nearer. The amount of pain, 
and the method of administering it, must be determined with a 
view to turning the child’s attention toward this better future. 
Pain that draws attention to itself only can hardly promote self- 
control or social self-guidance. The consequence of this remark 
with respect to the severity of the infliction is obvious enough. 
Not to stop reflection, but to help it, is the proper purpose; not 
to compel or crush, but to assist toward the realized freedom of 
self-control. In short, punishment is good when it actually guides 
the child’s attention toward a possible good, the desirability of 
which he himself sees. If at the moment of the smart he cannot 
see, the smart must be preceded and followed by deliberative 
processes that assist him to do so. Many a child has found, and 
promptly, the sweetness of clarified insight and improved self- 
control produced by an attention-arresting pain accompanied 
by calm and friendly discussion of its purpose. 
But increased pleasures of a social sort, that is, shared pleasures, 
must be provided by the very hand that inflicts the pain. It is 
a terrible thing for a child to think habitually of any human being 
as a pain-bringer. Not fear, but love is what does all the con- 
structive work. The punisher and the punished must have so 
many pleasures that they share with each other that the child 
himself will realize that the pain is only an incident of an unbroken 
fellowship. 
As soon as we reach this point we see that we must go one step 
further if punishment is to be socially constructive in the highest 
measure. As the ordinary relation of the punisher to the punished 
is that of pleasure-sharing, so their relation, when occasion for 
punishment comes, is that of pain-sharing, and this must be real- 
ized by both. The only way by which the punisher can avoid 
separating himself from the child is to cause the child to know that 
the two suffer together. The punisher is not to triumph over the 
child, is not to be happy while the child is in woe, but to main- 
tain at-one-ment alike in pleasures and in pains. 
Turning-points in character. We have seen in preceding 
chapters why the educator should aim at continuous moral 
growth rather than rely upon any breaks provided by original 
nature. In the present chapter we have dealt with another 
sort of continuity, for again and again we have come upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
SIN i79 
fact that the conduct of the young is bound up, in a remarkably 
close way, with that of their elders. But neither sort of con- 
tinuity implies either that moral growth can be equally rapid 
at all times, or that all parts of the complex moral experience 
can grow at the same rate, or that it can be free from crises, 
that is, such collocations of internal and external conditions 
that the child’s particular reaction at this time gives a perma- 
nent direction to future conduct, or in other words a “set” to 
character. As a matter of fact, all these kinds of unevenness 
occur. At one time we find acceleration of moral intelligence 
and of social motives, at another time slowing down; interest 
now in this phase of conduct, now in that; the costliest errors 
at critical points, and also decisive and permanent victories 
for right character. Let us consider the educational significance 
of the most marked of these deviations, the crises. 
The turning-points that one can remember as one’s own are 
almost exclusively those of adolescence or of maturity. Con- 
sequently we form a habit of thinking of crises of character in 
terms of issues defined at the time and involving decisions of 
greater or less deliberateness. But a set toward or away from 
a particular human relationship, or a particular mode of reac- 
tion, may be established whenever an overwhelming emotion 
occurs in connection with it. Shocks occur in childhood that 
produce permanent timidities of one sort or another, with their 
paralysis of action and of initiative. Set revulsions or attrac- 
tions toward individuals, or set attitudes toward the opposite 
sex, are also started now and then in childhood. Moreover, 
the ground tone of one’s subsequent social existence may be 
determined by early experiences that awaken trust or distrust. 
Thus we come up from childhood sometimes with permanent 
scars upon the mind, sometimes with a permanent outreaching 
impulse toward some social good, neither of which we recognize 
the source of. With respect to these things the wisdom of the 
educator will consist not only in providing abundance of whole- 
some social relationships, but also in the habit of noting chil- 
dren’s emotions, and of preventing children from being isolated 
and merely self-involved upon the occasion of any overwhelm- 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 SIN 
ing experience. The sharing of one’s emotions with a sym- 
pathetic, steady, and social minded friend is the surest road 
to balance. Moreover, if the passing of the years reveals the 
presence of an unfortunate set, again the task is to induce the 
victim to share this particular side of his nature and experience 
with such a friend, to share memories, hopes, fears, victories, 
and defeats.! 
That adolescence has a peculiar relation to the establish- 
ment of the final set of character is evident from a variety of 
facts. 'The general psychophysical condition renders the forma- 
tion and reorganization of habits relatively easy for a few years, 
after which there comes the relative non-plasticity of maturity, 
and its absorption in the compelling grind of existence. In 
this period the new capacity for affection makes possible fresh 
and profounder ethical appreciation. The general maturing 
of self-dependence opens the way for a final commitment of 
one’s purposes to some life principle or ideal. Hence the 
tribal custom of adolescent initiation; the custom, in various 
denominations, of confirming children just as adolescent inter- 
ests begin to be pronounced; the great relative frequency of 
adolescent conversions in denominations that cultivate this 
experience, and the frequency with which a lifelong interest or 
ambition takes its rise in this period. On the other hand, the 
significance of adolescence for character is equally clear from 
the great number of criminal careers that have their rise here, 
and from the vastly greater number of persons who are pur- 
sued through life by vicious habits, such as alcoholism and 
licentiousness, that are formed at this time. 
i We are here at the edge of the morbidities that require psychotherapy. 
We should find, if it were possible to go into them in this work, that social 
Jducation and psychotherapy are at many points continuous with each other. 
Two points in particular may be mentioned. Less reliance is placed than 
formerly upon the corrective power of mere suggestion, and more upon a re- 
education of the will in which the patient deliberately co-operates with the 
suggestions of the physician. Here habit formation assisted by the social 
support of the physician is the essence of the healing. The other point con- 
cerns the value of bringing one’s secrets to the light and sharing them with 
another. Psychoanalysis has many aspects and angles that cannot here 
be mentioned. But its relation to social education appears in its method 
of establishing normal attitudes toward society at large by first securing 
complete co-operation between physician and patient.

SIN 181 
When, alongside these considerations the recapitulation theory 
placed its doctrine of the natural and necessary egoism of child- 
hood, the inference was drawn in certain circles that conver- 
sion in the sense of a reversal of character, or in the sense of the 
begmning of genuinely personal religion, is a standard religious 
experience for adolescents. We have already seen, however, 
how the theory that childhood is doomed to egoism, and that 
adolescence is spontaneously altruistic, overlooks, oversimpli- 
fies, and distorts facts. A policy of religious education that 
postpones the beginning of personal religion of a social sort till 
adolescence, relying upon the chance that a conversion experi- 
ence will reverse the set that childhood has given to the char- 
acter, is a fatal policy. It has not worked in practice. For 
parallel with the stream of adolescent conversions are two other 
streams that issue from the Sunday schools, a stream of youths 
who come into full church-membership without a conversion, 
and a stream of those who go on into mature life without tak- 
ing any religious stand at all. The constant aim of elementary 
religious education should be to make conversion unnecessary.! 
Nevertheless, the peculiar plasticity of adolescence does 
make it the scene of many a decisive experience. It contains 
the main turning-point of many a character. Social educa- 
tion has here a distinctive work to do. On the positive side it 
is threefold: To meet the spontaneously enlarging social crav- 
ing by providing wholesome social experience both with one’s 
own sex and with the opposite sex; to guide this experience 
toward intelligent ideals of marriage and of the larger society, 
the democracy of God; and to train the individual specifically 
for the attainment of his “majority,” the assumption of full 
and independent citizenship, and entrance upon a life occupa- 
tion. 
On the other hand, here is opportunity, such as will never

is normal is weakening and confusion in the term ‘‘conversion.”” It should 
not be used for any and every sign of religious interest, but only in the New

recur, for correcting unsocial sets that the personality may have 
acquired. These sets are of many kinds. In one case a par- 
ticular anti-social habit has: to be conquered; in another case 
there is needed an awakening from indifference, or from mere 
drifting with a social current; or the thrall of an unwholesome 
social connection may have to be broken; or an already or- 
ganized self-centredness may have to be undone; or one may 
have the problem of consecration to a particular life work. 
In this list we have youths who require conversion in the strict 
sense of the word, but we have also cases of a milder sort to 
which the term conversion cannot be applied without confusion. 
But in all these cases alike educational methods are required— 
the making and the breaking of habits, the practice of co- 
operation, the enlargement of ideals, the culture of worship, 
the increasing control of conduct by knowledge. That is, 
even turning-points in character that involve a profound re- 
versal are to be included under the notion of religious education, 
and they are therefore to be planned for, controlled, and tested, 
by educational standards. 
Considerable unsteadiness and confusion exist at this point. 
Many persons persist in thinking of education as identical 
with instruction—persist in it to the point of perversity. Even 
some who know that education has to do with the forming of a 
will, do not clearly see how much it involves besides habit 
formation. The most fundamental thing in education is its 
constant reconstruction of purposes. Christian education, 
when it is really social, is through and through an incoming of 
the higher life, a renewing of the mind, a laying aside of lower 
selves. If, then, one of our pupils has already formed such 
perverse purposes that his present need is conversion, we are 
still to proceed as educators. We should never turn an adoles- 
cent over to uneducational evangelism. 
Evangelism is uneducational to the extent that it is char- 
acterized by any of these things: Separating the act of surrender 
to God from devotion to men; inducing a decision so general 
or so indeterminate in its content as to separate it from the 
specific decisions involved in the previous and the subsequent

immediate outlet for it in social living; separating conversion 
from habit formation on the one side and from intelligent 
analysis on the other; occasionalism, or postponing specific 
dealing with the adolescent’s purposes to a particular occasion, 
and then crowding this occasion with appeals so that mental 
assimilation is impossible; finally, such use of suggestion and 
of emotional incitements as prevents rather than promotes the 
self-controlled organization of purposes.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE LEARNING PROCESS CONSIDERED AS 
THE ACHIEVING OF CHARACTER 
Various senses of “moral character.” In the present 
chapter certain questions that are fundamental to the problem 
of method in social education will be opened, particularly ques- 
tions that have to do with the pupil’s awareness of social issues, 
and with his self-consciousness as related thereto. What are 
the effects, on the one hand, of shielding a child from knowledge 
of the issues that we are training him to meet, and on the other 
hand of letting him know what he is moving toward? What is 
the educational value of moral self-consciousness as compared 
with unreflective adjustment to social situations? How shall 
we conceive social character in individual terms, and what 
sort of individual consciousness is involved in the achieving 
of such character? In order to clear the ground for these ques- 
tions, it is necessary to note that each of the main terms in- 
volved—character, learning process, and self-consciousness— 
_ has several senses. Let us begin with the concept of moral 
character. 
To have a good character means, of course, to be steady 
rather than merely impulsive in one’s conduct, and to pursue 
lines of conduct that have, or are worthy to have, social approval. 
But both the steadiness and the worthiness may be of different 
kinds. Good character may mean, and actually does mean, 
any one or more of the following things: (1) Negative goodness, 
or abstaining from acts that are forbidden by the code that is 
acknowledged by the society in which one moves, whether this 
society be a club, a church, one’s profession, or the world of 
business. (2) Conventional goodness, or habitually doing the 
184 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
       ACHIEVING CHARACTER 185 
acts that. are positively prescribed in such a code. (3) The 
inner determination that involves self-discipline in addition to 
habit. This keeps one true to standards in difficult situa- 
tions. (4) Steady devotion to a cause or social ideal that outruns 
the conventional social code, and perhaps requires that it be revised. 
If we are to establish the democracy of God, we must, it is 
obvious, cultivate character in the fourth sense. Just at this 
point religious education finds its peculiar function and its 
peculiar difficulties in respect of method. Society as it now 
exists is quite willing to support an educational policy that 
makes for negative goodness and for conventional goodness; 
society would go as far, if it knew how, as to produce in its 
children the “rock-ribbed”’ fidelity to principle that constitutes 
character in the third sense. Up to this point religious educa- 
tion includes, or fuses with, whatever there is in “general” 
education that effectively socializes children. But beyond 
this point there lie, not the highways of social conformity, but 
the mountain trails of social reconstruction. Not the will 
that is conformed even to what is good in conventional social 
standards, but the will that is transformed into the likeness of 
the divine democracy that is far beyond and far above, is the 
character that Christian education has to produce. 
From many points in the valley of conventionality men are 
blazing trails up the steeps of social idealism. The love of man- 
kind, confidence that human nature contains high possibilities, 
the gleam of a universal justice that may yet be—these are 
alluring many men of many minds toward the heights. With 
these men religious education that is based upon the ideal of 
a democracy of God has a special affinity. We may agree 
or not with this or that program of social reform; we must 
doubtless make many experiments before we shall secure con- 
trol of essential conditions of democracy, and some of these 
experiments will fail; but through all the give-and-take of 
debate upon social programs, and through all the practical 
measures that succeed or fail, religious education will have the 
distinctive task of producing men whose motives steadily and 
uncompromisingly reflect the will of the Father that we should 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 ACHIEVING CHARACTER 
make ourselves brothers. The democratizing of the heart is 
the fundamental and the most difficult part in creating effective 
democratic institutions. Democratic character will be formed, 
of course, only by participation in specific purposes of democratic 
quality, and it will go on to require democratic institutions for 
the fulfilment of itself. No esoteric goodness will suffice. 
But our specific mission will be to put sufficient heart, and a 
sufficiently radical character, into this work, even the heart 
and character of God. 
Various senses of “to learn.” ‘To learn means either 
(1) To form a habit; or (2) To acquire information; or (3) To 
attain skill in a particular operation or occupation; or (4) To 
become wise. No one can mistake the fact that we have to 
learn wisdom, or the further fact that learning to be wise, 
though it depends upon and includes the three other sorts of 
learning, is not quite the same as either of them or as all of 
them together. Becoming wise implies acquiring better desires, 
reconstructing one’s purposes, self-conquest, and placing one- 
self effectively within some foresighted scheme of society 
that awakens social approval. Wisdom is more than intelli- 
gence; more than craftiness, however successful. It is more 
than good habits, which reproduce good life but do not trans- 
form the good into the better. It is more than skill, for one 
can be skilful in getting what one wants, and yet be unwise 
in wanting it. Social education, then, must somehow, at some 
time, or perhaps through all periods of the child’s growth, in- 
duct him into this individual relation to ideals. It must in- . 
spire in him an original foregrasping of social good, even the 
faith by which alone we can be saved to our highest possibilities. 
Various senses of ‘‘moral self-consciousness.” Everybody 
is familiar with, and everybody who reflects disapproves, the 
following forms of moral self-consciousness in children and 
youth as well as in adults: (1) Moral priggery, or habitually 
thinking about one’s own goodness, habitually bringing it to 
the attention of others, and conforming to standards for this 
self-centred reason. (2) Moral snobbery, or looking down 
upon others because of their supposed moral inferiority. (3) 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
ACHIEVING CHARACTER 187 
Moral hypersensitiveness, which shows itself in scruples, hesi- 
tations, and doubts when action is required; in self-condemna- 
tion so intense or so prolonged as to interfere with moral vigor;, 
in longings for an abstract and contentless perfection; or in 
failure to co-operate in practical affairs because of the imper-- 
fections that inhere in all social adjustments (which is, prac— 
tically, insistence that others should always adjust themselves: 
to me). . 4: 
In contrast to all this, we admire a child who does his duty as 
a matter of course; doesn’t cry too much over spilled milk, 
but goes ahead, endeavoring to do better next time; and 
doesn’t bother his head about the degree of his virtuousness. 
This is sometimes called moral unconsciousness, which is then 
contrasted with moral self-consciousness. No one will ques- 
tion the justice of this judgment, but the grounds for it are not 
always clearly seen. 
What is the precise nature of the evil in the moral self- 
consciousness that has just been described? It is that the 
child obscures the moral goal by looking at his moral self. Just 
as a golfer is required, in the act of driving, to fix his attention 
upon the ball and not upon his club, so moral conduct is in 
general most effective when one’s attention is upon what is to 
be accomplished, and not upon one’s faults and virtues. It is 
this objectivity of mind that we praise in one child and deplore 
the absence of in another. We praise objectivity of mind 
because it is a condition of objective efficiency. Moral self- 
consciousness in the sense thus far defined connotes in the end 
moral clumsiness, actual defects in objective social relations. 
But a distinction has to be made, and the possibility of an- 
other sort of moral self-consciousness has to be considered. 
Does the misfortune of the children whom we have in mind 
lie in the fact that they judge themselves to be good or bad? 
Hardly, for the so-called morally unconscious child, too, is by 
no means unaware of his proper classification. If my fellows 
approve me, especially if I am approved by those who are 
older and wiser than I, how can I help approving myself? The 
trouble lies partly in misjudging oneself, and partly in failure 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
188 ACHIEVING CHARACTER 
to organize one’s judgments of oneself into a social scheme. To 
be good, to achieve a moral status, is not a moral finality. 
I am a good boy, or a good man, am I? Or perhaps a bad one? 
Well, what of it? What difference does it make? That is, 
what persons are affected by it, and how are they affected? 
How is the social world in which I move either better off or 
worse off because I am what I am? When I thus make my 
judgment upon myself a part of a more general judgment 
upon social welfare, social justice, or the progress of world so- 
ciety, my self-consciousness is healthily objective. The self- 
consciousness that stops short of this objectivity becomes 
self-involution, and “foozles the ball.” 
Self-involution is, in fact, a better name than El naciouas 
ness for that which is common to moral priggery, moral snob- 
bery, and moral hypersensitiveness. Self-consciousness, in 
the stricter and more proper sense of the term, is present when- 
ever what is actually desired is distinguished from something 
else as an alternative or contrary object of desire. That is, 
self-consciousness is inseparable from the facing of any live issue, 
in other words, one that involves mutually exclusive or mutually 
limiting satisfactions. This statement is not intended as a 
general definition of self-consciousness in distinction from any 
other sort of consciousness, but only as an indication of the 
route that is taken in the progress of a mind from instinctive 
reactions toward those that are required by membership in a 
deliberative group. 
Moral self-consciousness and deliberative group conscious- 
ness are correlative—they are two aspects of the same experi- 
ence. There can be no deliberative group the members of which 
are non-deliberative. The weighing of alternatives takes place 
within each individual, who then compares his scales and his 
results with those of other members. Thus each has to be 
aware both of himself as this particular self and of others as 
those particular selves, each self being characterized by the 
alternative that it cleaves to. Self-consciousness is thus an 
essential factor in the evolution of society. Social education, 
accordingly, must bring children to moral self-consciousness. 
   
-P-A-G-E-201
ACHIEVING CHARACTER 189 
Neither instinct, nor any mere drifting into social habits, is 
sufficient for the life of deliberative society. 
It is true that much, very much, that is socially valuable is 
acquired by imitation or in response to verbal suggestion. 
Moreover, constant social pressure by the massing of pleasures 
in one direction and of pains in the opposite direction produces 
a large measure of conformity without deliberation. Such 
conformity is natural, is economically produced, and is admi- 
rably “unconscious.” It is an essential part of moral education. 
But its educational capacity has several limitations: 
First, Even in the fundamental matter of habit formation 
self-consciousness plays a most important réle. In many 
spheres habits are most easily formed, and are most accurately 
adjusted to specific needs, when at the beginning contrasts are 
noticed, alternatives faced, and the first acts in the series are 
fully voluntary rather than imitative or otherwise suggestive 
in origin. ‘This is the way to acquire skill. It is the best way 
to acquire various social habits, such as punctuality at school, 
neatness in this or that work, proper self-control in eating and 
drinking, and constructive charitableness. 
Second, Imitation and other forms of social suggestion, taken 
by themselves, transmit the imperfections of society as well as 
its virtues. 
Third, Imitation and other forms of social suggestion contain 
within themselves no provision for situations in which society 
is divided against itself. Shall one go with the majority or 
with the minority? “Unconscious tuition,” valuable as it is, 
makes little contribution to a problem like this. Non-conform- 
ists, stubborn minorities, are vital organs of progressive society. 
How, then, shall the pupil be trained to deal with them? By 
the use of suggestion we can make him a partisan, often an active 
and efficient partisan, of any party with which he has happened 
to associate during his growing years. But partisanship does 
not solve the problems of society. A genuine social solution is 
never merely a resultant of moving bodies that collide. Society, 
because it is co-operation, can resolve its strains only by mak- 
ing individual minds feel both of the opposing interests that 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 ACHIEVING CHARACTER 
cause the strain. When any citizen does this, he becomes so- 
cially self-conscious. Now, this part of a citizen’s duty does 
not fulfil itself by any fresh impulsive outburst upon the day 
that one becomes qualified to vote. Nay, it requires long, 
persistent, preliminary training—training, that is to say, in 
social self-consciousness. 
But self-consciousness of this kind is the precise opposite of 
self-involution. Self-involution sets me in the centre of a 
group every member of which is gazing at me; wholesome moral 
self-consciousness, on the other hand, consists in so control- 
ling my eyes that they shall surely see some object other than 
myself toward which the eyes of my fellows are looking—shall 
see it because they are looking that way. Selfhood of this type 
is objective-minded because it is social-minded, because it sees 
through other eyes as well as its own.' In the end, then, moral 
self-consciousness is not so much a preliminary to democracy, 
or a part of the machinery of democracy, as it is democracy it- 
self realized in an individual will. 
Ambiguities in the debate upon “direct’’ versus “indirect” 
methods in moral education. The conclusion that follows 
from the last three sections is, in a word, that,~‘though the 
guidance of instinctive action by deliberate prearrangement of 
pleasures and pains, and the development of wholesome instinc- 
tive conduct into habits without premeditation on the part 
of the child are fundamental essentials in moral education, 
sound method requires also specific measures for promoting 
premeditation, the weighing of social standards themselves, 
and the fully conscious taking of one’s position with respect to 
these standards. If, now, any one asks whether this conclusion 
supports “direct” methods in moral education, no simple yes 
or no can be given in reply. For the terms “direct” and “in- 
direct”’ have no single or uniform meaning in the writings of 
those who have debated this question now for several years. A 
veritable medley of conceptions, some expressed, others im-

children upon the grounds of social approval and disapproval rather than

plied, gathers particularly around the “direct methods.” Thus, 
one or another writer thinks that: 
The direct method consists in telling children what is right and 
what is wrong, or how to act. 
It consists in ethical instruction as distinguished from moral 
training. 
It consists in setting aside a particular period in the school pro- 
gram for morals as a subject of instruction. 
It consists in causing children to single out and define the 
ethical aspect of situations as distinguished from causing children 
to deal with each situation in its concrete totality. 
It consists in causing children to reason about ethical principles, 
and trying to make them act from ethical reasons rather than from 
simple and wholesome impulses. 
It consists in inducing children to dwell upon their own moral 
excellences and defects. 
It is an attempt to secure good conduct by exhortation or by 
emotional pressure. 
It is moralizing, or contemplating goodness by itself, in the 
absence of any occasion for exercising the kind of goodness that 
is under contemplation. 
It consists in imposing our moral notions upon children, or in 
securing good conduct from them by pressure from without as 
distinguished from action from within in response to a situation 
that the child himself appreciates. 
On the other hand, the designation “indirect” is given to 
methods that are variously characterized as follows: 
The use of suggestion, rather than either compulsion or reason- 
ing, to secure good conduct. 
Reliance upon school organization, classroom management, 
playground supervision, and the personality of the teacher, as 
supplying both material and method for moral education. 
Getting moral reactions by means of actual moral situations as 
distinguished from the imaginary situations of mere instruction. 
More fully expressed, moral growth through solving the problems 
that arise in one’s own social experience. 
Discussing moral problems when they arise in the pupil’s actual

conduct rather than according to a systematic plan—that is, 
“incidental” moral instruction. 
Training for the larger society by bringing the school curriculum 
into closer relation therewith, and in general by getting the school 
out of its social isolation. 
That there is some fundamental difference between these two 
bundles of conceptions one easily feels. But just what the dif- 
ference is when it is traced downward to its psychological 
assumptions, or upward to details of practice, is not always so 
obvious. In respect to practice, we find ambiguities like this: 
An argument against direct instruction is coupled with an 
argument for training the pupil to analyze situations so as to 
pick out the moral element in them. As an example of correct 
method an instance is given in which a principal dealt with 
cheating in school work by explaining to the pupils that they 
were dishonest, and that cheating is stealing. Where lies the 
indirectness in this case? The principal went directly at the 
pupils and at the ethical problem, and he did it analytically, 
not by suggestion. Some writers treat story-telling as an in- 
stance of direct method; others classify it as indirect. 
What is needed here is a more strictly psychological ap- 
proach; that is, we need to ask what happens in the pupil’s 
mind. What are the two things that are to be either directly 
or indirectly related to each other in the pupil’s experience? 
Himself and his teacher? Or himself and another pupil? Or 
himself and the larger society of which he is to become an adult 
member? Or his ideas on the one hand and his acts on the 
other? And what is it for any of these to be either directly 
or indirectly related to the other? It is directness as compared 
with indirectness in the pupil’s own mind that we have to deal 
with. 
Method in moral education follows the general principles 
of good teaching. The polemic against “direct”? methods in 
moral instruction and training is at bottom a part of the general 
campaign for better teaching. The defects of the old practice, 
whether in the teaching of arithmetic or of morals, have their 
roots in these assumptions: 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  ACHIEVING CHARACTER 193 
(1) The intellectualistic assumption with respect to the 
relation of knowledge to life, namely, that thought first grasps 
reality and then adjusts life to it. The new education reflects 
the contrary view, that the adjustment process and the cogni- 
tive process are not two but one. Jesus intimated that up- 
reaching conduct is a condition of knowing the higher things— 
those who put something divine into their acts are the ones who 
know the things of God. Just so, modern educational reformers: 
in a long procession have proclaimed that we learn by doing, 
that experience of the real world is the basis of vital instruction 
about it, that participation in the elements of industrial processes 
is essential to education;’and that character grows by fulfilling 
one’s functions in some social group. 
(2) The undemocratic assumption that to teach is to im- 
pose the teacher’s thought and will upon the pupil. Here is 
social bias of the most serious import. It ever seeks to justify 
itself by considerations drawn from the incapacity of children 
for self-guidance. But it is ever self-condemned because there 
is lacking in it any provision for bringing pupils to genuine self- 
guidance, especially to the union of co-operation and liberty 
that are essential to popular government. The old type of 
teaching assumed that the use of authority is simply to control 
others for any good end; the new type assumes that the use of 
authority is to bring others to self-control, emancipating them 
from external controls. The only authority to which the 
teacher has any right is that which is continuously extinguish- 
ing itself. 
Accordingly, the reform that is now demanded in school 
practice insists not only that pupils shall be active rather than 
passive, but also that they shall act from within, and shall 
organize their activities through their own reflection. Instruc- 
tion in the natural and physical sciences, for example, now aims, 
not merely to transfer a given amount of biology or of physics to. 
the pupil, but to bring him up to perform scientific processes. 
himself, and if possible, to make him an independent investi- 
gator. Just so, the moral aim of the school requires that the 
pupils be led, not only to hold correct views of conduct, not only  
-P-A-G-E-206
194 ACHIEVING CHARACTER 
to accept loyally and to act upon the superior wisdom of their 
elders, but also to perform among themselves, each for himself, 
here and now, the actual processes of social living under free- 
dom. 
These processes are not to be mere applications of what the 
teacher tells or prescribes. The teacher, instead of giving solu- 
tions, which are then to be merely illustrated by pupil experi- 
mentation, engages the pupils in a genuine trial-and-error 
method of learning to live. This is the method by which 
society as a whole has evolved. Education is able to make the 
process a short one, abbreviating it into the score or so of years 
during which the school has the child, "by making available the 
rich social materials that have been deposited by the experi- 
ence of the race. The art of the teacher consists, in no small 
measure, in making obvious, at the right moment, the applica- 
bility of this or that part of the social inheritance to the present 
purposes of the pupils. In this way waste of time and of effort 
is reduced, and conformity to social standards is most cer- 
tainly produced. Conformity, that is, from the heart, because 
it is self-induced. But by this method conformity is secured 
through freedom, and it carries with it the training in objective 
moral criticism that is necessary to social progress through 
revision of social standards. 
Sound method in moral education, then, will cause children 
to face, directly and analytically, their relations to one an- 
other, to their teachers, and to the larger society. It will not 
build up a structure of moral ideas apart from moral action, 
nor will it be content, on the other hand, with conduct, however 
appropriate, that does not grow into reflective self-control and 
weighing of standards. Just as the best teaching of arithmetic, 
or of manual processes, or of physics causes the child to realize 
what he is doing, why he does it, what the results are, and how 
it can be improved, so in morals it is open-eyed, forward-looking, 
and in this sense self-conscious, practice that counts most for 
the formation of a democratic character. 
The relation of ethical thinking to virtuous action. From 
every point of view the lines of our discussion converge upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  ACHIEVING CHARACTER 195 
conclusion that the learning process with which moral educa- 
tion is chiefly concerned is an achieving process—the process of 
achieving character. But character, not as something static, 
already accomplished; rather, character conceived as making 
oneself count for objective ends. Here we find a touchstone 
for the curriculum aspect of any scheme of moral or religious 
education. 
What value does this touchstone reveal in curricula that 
divide and subdivide and arrange lesson material according to 
a schedule of the virtues into which good character can be 
analyzed? If we ask what a good man is like, we get from such 
curricula the answer that a good man is truthful, industrious, 
persevering, kind, and so on. Therefore the pupil is made to 
study in succession, the virtues of truthfulness, industry, and 
all the others. There are curricula that appear actually to 
assume that if a pupil thi about: industry he will become 
industrious. But the profession as a whole condemns 
the implied method on the ground that it separates thought 
from life, substitutes ethical instruction for character forma- 
tion, and tends, by reason of its abstractness and its dryness, 
to create actual dislike for moral standards. If, in order to 
create like instead of dislike, admiration-awakening examples 
are used, the objection is made that such separation of ethical 
emotion from moral action creates a habit of feeling rather than 
of action, and actually substitutes sentiment for character. 
In order to avoid these pitfalls, suppose that, in connection 
with the study of each virtue, we provide opportunity for the 
practice of it. There is going on, in fact, considerable hunting 
up of things that children can do in the way of, shall we say, 
practice work in goodness? That this search will uncover some 
really vital things in the moral reactions of children we need 
not doubt. But the artificiality of the point of view is at 
best only alleviated thereby. For any such practice is merely 
added to life. What is added to life can be subtracted upon 
occasion. It is too like an excursion in a captive balloon; the 
balloon returns to earth. 
The whole scheme rests upon the fundamental fallacy that       
   
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  196 ACHIEVING CHARACTER 
virtuous character is made up by combining virtues, whereas, 
the virtues, one and all, are abstractions, mere thought-things, 
and therefore static only. Our concern is not that the pupil 
should possess virtues, but that he should have virtue, that is, 
strength in right causes. Here two conceptions are essential, 
firmness of action, and discriminated, objective ends. Now, 
objective moral ends or “causes” are those that arise in inter- 
actions between individuals. In fact, only through social give- 
and-take do ends of any sort—whether wealth, science, or artis- 
tic production—become anything more than self-involution. 
Ethical ends, such as charitable relief, follow the same law. 
As long as my charitable act is simply an outlet for me, a mere 
doing for another, it contains a fatal ethical defect. Real 
charity, or love, is doing with another. Moral character im- 
plies, then, that one has found something important to do that 
requires the union of several wi it implies also that one 
is firmly devoted to getting this e. 
The consequences for moral educa are these: 
(1) The primary material for moral analysis is to be derived 
from the child’s experienced relations with persons, that is, from 
his ordinary, every-day social contacts with both children and 
adults, whether in the school, on the playground, on the street, 
at home, in church, in buying and selling, or wherever. 
(2) Imaginative material, whether historical or other, is to 
be selected on the basis of its continuity with what the child 
has already experienced in his relations with living persons, and 
it is to be so used as to assist in the analysis of these relations. 
To this point I shall return in a subsequent section. 
(3) The natural growth of these contacts from the family 
hearth outward yields a principle for the gradation of material. 
Home, church, school and playground, local community, 
national community, world community—these form a natural 
ascending order of social contacts and of social interests and 
functions. But this is an order of increasing complication; 
it is not a stairway in which each step is left behind in the act 
of reaching the next higher. We are not to graduate from the 
home, but deeper and deeper into it, nor from the school, but 
      
   
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  ACHIEVING CHARACTER 197 
further and further into the system of education until we take 
upon ourselves full responsibility for the schooling of others. 
(4) In all this material the centre for the pupil’s attention 
is men and women, particularly what they do, why they do it, 
what the results are, and how perhaps something better might 
have happened. What father and mother do, and why it needs 
to be done; what each family helper does; what the grocer, the 
postman, the physician, the policeman does; what the mayor, 
the councilman, the police judge does; what a school, a fire de- 
partment, a library, an art museum, a natural history collec- 
tion does; how charities are organized and what they accom- 
plish; why the Child Labor Association exists and what it is 
doing—it is unnecessary to finish this inventory, for already it 
must be clear that in the actual organization, work, and pur- 
poses of persons as social agents, all the way from preparing 
the family breakfast tog ting world peace, we have the 
concrete material for a the pupil to form definite social 
purposes of his own. In subsequent chapters we shall see how 
this principle applies to the child’s relation to the church. 
With a large proportion of the persons involved in this in- 
ventory children can have some personal contact. The most 
significant thing about a grocery is the grocer, not his goods. 
Guide the child’s knowledge of the goods so that it shall include 
acquaintance with the purveyors of them, and let buying and 
selling be guided so that it shall be mutual service between buyer 
and seller. Treat institutions in the same way. ‘The library 
clerk and the doorman at the museum, for example, are to be 
discriminated from the things that they handle, and are to be 
recognized as persons with whose acts the child’s own life is 
bound up. 
(5) The irreducible factors in a morally educative situation, 
whether it is encountered in experience or only in imagination, 
are persons in their concrete individuality. The presence of 
persons is what makes a situation ethical. Because they are 
individual, irreducible, present as persons or not at all, a child’s 
moral progress consists, not in achieving one sort of moral good- 
ness now, another next year, but in increasing control of whole    
     
-P-A-G-E-210
    198 ACHIEVING CHARACTER 
personal situations. Thus, in abiding relations like the family, 
he will show a firmer will to co-operate (ability to act socially 
under greater strains), and ability to co-operate in more ways. 
In addition, as his social relations grow more complicated, he 
will put into them one after another the same intelligent, con- 
structive good will. Progress like this is not likely to corre- 
spond with any possible serial order of virtues or qualities of 
character. Progress does not consist in any increase of a qual- 
ity, but in achieving ends in “real life.” One phase of such 
progress can be measured by testing the changes that occur 
“in the pupil’s ideas concerning social relations, but only one 
phase. The full measure of any method of moral education is 
the part played by the pupil in actual social relations. 
Imagination and character. Social education by conscious 
effort at adjustment to social reality describes the platform 
that we have now reached. W n, of story-telling, and 
what of the world’s treasure of i tive literature? What 
relation has imagination to the realistic educational processes 
that are fundamental? This problem, looked at from the 
psychological angle, is wider than it is ordinarily supposed to 
be. For the contents of imagination are not at all restricted 
to what is called imaginative. Historical characters and events 
are made concrete to me by the same process that enables me to 
grasp a fairy-tale. When I read the morning paper, too, 
imagining events that the paper describes is what puts me 
into touch with the real world. Yes, it is imagination that 
puts me into touch with myself and with my immediate environ- 
ment. It does it by holding before me my own yesterday, 
or my own hour-ago, and also by holding before me the picture 
of some possible future good. Here, moreover, we have not 
only a reproductive, but also a productive, inventive, creative 
process, and it is productive most of all where fresh adjustment 
to reality is taking place. 
A child’s imagination is a stage upon which programs of 
possible action are rehearsed, with himself always as one of the 
actors, albeit he is also a spectator. Small children do their 
thinking largely in story form, their thinking even of situations       
 
-P-A-G-E-211
ACHIEVING CHARACTER 199 
that to grown-ups are prosily literal. This is a necessary part 
of the trial-and-error method of learning to live. The trial- 
and-error method, when it is educationally used, is no mere 
lunging about until one happens to hit upon success, but the 
following of programs of action previously discriminated from 
other possible programs, and then noting the results. [In 
the imaginative rehearsals that are so characteristic of chil- 
dren, particular parts are assigned, distinctions of social quality 
are recognized, relations of social cause and effect are to some 
extent noted, and the wmaginer himself assumes a character. 
This assumed character may, under favorable conditions, per- 
sist as an attitude or special readiness for action after the dra- 
matic rehearsal is over. An attitude is an initial stage in ac- 
tual conduct; there is momentum init. Thus it is that the im- 
aginary can control the actual with children and with adults. 
This rehearsing can ta ce in a story that a child is listen- 
ing to as truly as in on he invents. It is safe to assume 
that any child, when he listens to a story in which the actors dis- 
play contrasting social characters, takes one of them as himself. 
In a certain kindergarten a story was told of a wild duck that 
protected her ducklings from a pursuer by hiding them among 
rocks along a shore, saying: “Don’t one of you stir, don’t one 
of you make a sound, don’t even whisper.” ‘Then the story 
went on: “Not one of them stirred, not one of them made a 
sound, not one of them even whispered.” At this point a boy 
was heard to gasp: “I couldn’t do that!” The child who made 
this remark was the one of all the group who was having the 
hardest time learning to think twice and to await his turn. 
Obviously this listening child was at work upon his own social 
problem, upon realities, and it is equally obvious that to arrive 
at such a true judgment upon one’s faults is a natural step toward 
correcting them. 
The social experience and experimentation that produce 
social growth can be extended, then, by imagination. There 
is no necessary break between a fairy-story, an incident in the 
life of a historical personage, and to-day’s playground experi- 
ence. It is the teacher’s business to select and to use imagina-    
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 ACHIEVING CHARACTER 
tive material, fiction as well as history and current events, so 
that there shall be in it no break with real life. The match- 
less power of Jesus as a teller of educative stories lies in part in 
the utter continuity of the life process in his tales with that of 
his hearers. If only the actors in stories for children are made 
to act from simple motives in situations that are not too com- 
plicated or far-fetched, continuity with child life is possible in 
material that is derived not only from child life, but also from 
adult life, animal life, and the realm of myth, folk-lore, and fairy- 
tale. Plant life, too, and even inanimate objects can be used by 
endowing them with human motives. Mountains can break 
forth into singing, and the trees of the field can clap their hands. 
Parents and teachers of very young children have the special 
problem of helping their pupils to grasp the difference between 
fiction and history. The clew to this problem lies in the truth 
that there is no necessary break between fiction and “real” 
life. The distinction is not that en stories that are true 
and stories that are not true. There is nothing in any language 
more true than, say, the fictitious narratives that Jesus told. 
The difference between one of his tales and history lies in the 
sphere in which the event takes place. The story sphere is 
human motive; the historical sphere adds the full, socially com- 
plicated bodily expression of motive; both spheres are real, 
and they are continuous with each other. “Thou,” said Nathan 
to David, “art the man.” The Priest, the Levite, and the 
Samaritan are realities within our own breasts. Santa Claus, 
the spirit of Christmas giving, is a blessed reality, and so are 
the other good fairies. 
Under favorable conditions, I have said, an imaginatively 
assumed character may persist as an attitude in overt action. 
Probably the part that one plays in one’s imagination invariably 
has some tendency toward conduct of like quality. But the 
tendency may be greater or less, and it may be more or less 
thwarted by the setting that it has in the imaginary event. 
The teacher has the task, not merely of causing the pupil to 
rehearse imaginatively some sort of good act, but also that of 
arranging the other factors in the rehearsal so that a particular     
  
-P-A-G-E-213
  ACHIEVING CHARACTER 201 
attitude shall persist and pass on into the child’s relations with 
some actual human being. Before stating what this positively 
requires, we may well pause to consider some methods that fail, 
and why they fail. 
Moralizing, or telling children what the application of the 
story is, interferes with the educative process by drawing atten- 
tion away from the concrete and particular to the abstract and 
general. It interferes likewise by injecting the teacher’s per- 
sonality into the situation. If the story is an appropriate one 
appropriately told, connection with life is already there as the child 
listens. To introduce a new vehicle to carry him over from the 
story into life is to create distraction. Nor is this the worst of 
it. For moralizing creates a new attitude of the pupil toward 
the story as a whole. A moment ago he was living in the story; 
now he sees that the story has no reality to the teacher, but is 
only an extended way of uttering an abstraction; so the i imaginary 
becomes for him the unreal ; and the goodness and the badness in 
the story cease to be live issues. A healthy child is very likely, 
under these circumstances, to form a habit of regarding moral 
rules as prosy impositions upon life, dull things. 
A method much in vogue in sermons to children is teaching by 
analogy. A sensible object is presented, or a physical or chemical 
experiment is performed, or an event in external nature is de- 
scribed, and the attention of the children is then invited to the 
similarity between this thing or process or event and life issues of 
right and wrong. The method is apparently an attempt to take 
advantage of children’s spontaneous interest in sense-objects and 
in sensible happenings, and to move the child mind on from the 
sense-level to the level of ethical thought and appreciation. But 
the device rests upon a fundamental misunderstanding. Ana- 
logical thinking is not characteristic of children. They must have 
a larger range of identities between the things that they compare, 
going from person to person, say, with ease, but not from the 
properties of physical things to qualities of character. When 
children hang upon the preacher’s words as he expounds an anal- 
ogy they are likely to be attending to the physical side of the 
analogy only. A minister once illustrated “‘Thou desirest truth 
in the inward parts” by holding up a watch and calling attention 
to the effects that would follow if the little wheels inside it got 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  202 ACHIEVING CHARACTER 
rusty. A small boy reported the minister as having said that 
“Tf you tell lies you’ll get rust in your stomach.” In such cases 
the child’s attention fixes upon the symbol so intently as not to 
move on with the preacher from the symbol to the thing sym- 
bolized. In short, the imaginative material by means of which 
children get control of actual social situations is that which has 
a large rather than small number of elements, and particularly 
motives, that are continuous with those of the child’s social experi- 
ence. 
The positive conditions under which a dramatically assumed 
moral attitude is most likely to pass on into conduct are in 
general those that favor “transfer of training.” The fact that 
a child has been trained to neatness in his arithmetic papers 
does not of itself guarantee that he will be equally neat in his 
map-drawing; the fact that a man is truthful in certain relations 
or with certain persons does not prevent him from being untruth- 
ful in a different set of relations or with a different set of persons. 
The transfer of neatness, or of truthfulness, or indeed of any 
habit, from one situation to another depends upon such condi- 
tions as the number of points in which the two situations are 
identical with each other, and the definiteness with which one 
has faced and understood and accepted as one’s ideal the prin- 
ciple that is involved in the good habit in question. A large 
part of the present chapter has a bearing, as a matter of fact, 
upon the transfer of moral training. For we have been occupiec 
with the difference between particular good habits on the one 
hand and readiness for moral discrimination on the other, and 
between the exercise of good will upon conventional levels on 
the one hand, and on the other hand the carrying forward of 
good will into reconstruction of standards. The particular 
application of the principles of transfer to the use of stories, his- 
tory, current events, or other material of the imagination, is as 
follows: 
There must be many rather than few elements in the imagined 
situation that are identical with elements in social situations 
already experienced by the child. By identical elements in social 
situations I mean, not the externals of life, but persons, their char- 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
   
     
ACHIEVING CHARACTER 203 
acteristic interactions, and consequences of conduct as they are 
determined by laws (natural laws and laws of the state) and cus- 
tom. 
The imagined situation should be so constructed and presented 
as to contain a social problem of a type that the child has already 
encountered, together with at least some steps toward the solu- 
tion. Something unsettled, suspense, light coming from the 
consequences of conduct, these consequences occurring not ar- 
bitrarily or by chance but in accordance with the actual laws of 
life—all this should be in the imagined situation itself, so that 
the teacher does not need to translate anything into a different 
language. | 
It is not enough, however, that the material should represent 
important laws of life; these laws must be made to seem impor- 
tant. There must be perspective. This is to be had, not by 
telling the child what is important but by the selection and ar- 
rangement of details, as in climaxes, and by such methods as 
emphasis, repetition of key-phrases, and tone of voice. Discus- 
sion of the story by the pupils under suggestive guidance from the 
parent or teacher, and dramatization under such guidance, add 
still further to the production of perspective as well as to depth 
of impression. 
Whatever be the proportions of pleasure and pain, joy and sad- 
ness, in the personal experiences portrayed in the story, these 
experiences must be so organized and presented that the child 
who listens will imaginatively side with the right against the 
wrong, and get pleasure from doing so. Not, indeed, pleasure 
without cost, not the pleasure of passivity, for this would be 
untrue to the realities of the moral life. Struggle, pain, failures, 
sacrifice must not be slurred in the content of the story, or in the 
pupil’s imaginative participation in it. He must be led at times 
to take sides with what is hard and disagreeable, and even this 
taking of sides in imagination will cost him an effort. Yet there 
should be here also the joy of winning, some realization that the 
socially right alternative is more agreeable than its opposite. It 
is easy to dislocate the pleasure of the listening child; the story 
may be very different to him from what it is to the teacher. ‘‘Chil- 
dren,” said a clergyman in a talk to a Sunday school, ‘‘when you 
get to heaven, whom do you want to see first?” A ten-year-old 
boy, being pressed for an answer, replied: ‘‘Goliath.” 
When an actual situation subsequently arises that involves a  
-P-A-G-E-216
204 
  ACHIEVING CHARACTER 
problem that has already been at least partly solved in a story, 
the skilful use of a phrase from the story, or a mere allusion to an 
event in it, may help. But not if reminding constitutes nagging, 
and whether it does constitute nagging or not depends upon the 
pupil’s attitude toward it, not upon the teacher’s intention. But 
we must not forget that a normal child who lives in wholesome social 
relations desires to be helped. He wants to achieve. No conceal- 
ment is necessary, no subterfuge. The effective reminder is the 
one that brings him this help, and makes him feel that doing right 
is made easier. Here is another instance of the law that in moral 
training the major keys of pleasure must predominate. This is 
the reason why humor is so valuable both in story material and in 
direct relations between teacher and pupil, humor, that is to say, 
that enables the teacher to laugh with the pupil, not at him.

CHAPTER XV 
THE CHRISTIAN REORGANIZATION OF 
THE FAMILY 
The family as a determiner of the social type. When does 
a human being make his début into society? When he is born 
into the common life of mother, father, and child. A family is 
a society, and it is an educational institution of the very first 
significance. “Where was he educated?” is often asked, and 
the answer is given: “In such or such a college,” or perhaps: 
“In the public schools of his State,” whereas the most that 
school and college are likely to have contributed to him is some 
sort of superstructure built upon foundations of social char- 
acter already laid. Just as it was said of Peter, “Thou also 
art one of them, for thy speech maketh thee known,” so any 
observant teacher sees in a student’s manners and in his use of 
language an index of his home life. And deeper than words 
and accents, deeper than manners, is a substratum of social 
presuppositions and social attitudes that home life has already 
made firm. 
The reason why family life has peculiar influence in respect 
to the social substratum of the character is this: The long de- 
pendence of the child for so many of his satisfactions upon the 
same few persons, and the intimacy and continuity of his rela- 
tions with them. In this intimacy with persons he deals with 
what is elemental and final in the ethical and the religious life. 
Many parents believe that the social experiences of small chil- 
dren are insignificant, mere time-fillers that are to pass away 
with the time that they occupy, whereas these experiences form 
firm notions of what a person is, of what is due from one person 
to another as a person, and of what concerns in life are im- 
207 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 THE FAMILY 
portant or unimportant. These notions beeome the presupposi- 
tions of future thinking on social relations. They are wrought 
into habits, too, and are bound up with whatever life purpose 
or ambition a child or youth forms. 
The family, moreover, is not an isolated society, for into and 
out of it flows the life-blood of civilization in the large. Through 
his parents the child is under the tutelage of the traditions, cus- 
toms, and economic conditions that have made his parents to 
be what they are. Thus it is that a social standpoint, high or 
low, Christian or un-Christian, may, through the personal in- 
trmacy of parent and child, become to the child a self-evident 
and even sacred thing. No child merely plays around the out- 
side of society. In the intimacy of the family every member, 
younger or older, is a feeling part of social processes. He is 
included within a network of concrete relations between per- 
sons—between the stronger and the weaker, between male and 
female, between buyer and seller, between the employer and the 
employed. The child is not prepared to weigh these relations. 
He knows not how to sift out the wheat that is always there. 
He may even accept injustice to himself as something that be- 
longs within natural and proper social relations.? 
It is the fundamentals of social justice that are at stake 
in the child’s experience in his father’s family. Family 
government, to begin with, tends to fix one’s ideas as to the 
basal rights of men. Consider the educational difference be- 
tween a family in which each child, however young, has rights 
that the older and stronger members respect, and a family in 
which no child is aware that he has any rights that are respected 
by his own father and mother, or by older brothers and sisters. 
Genuine parental affection can be mixed with caprice and self- 
1'The educational power of family intimacies is well illustrated by the 
almost universal regard for family honor. There are few things that awaken 
anger and resentment as uniformly as opprobrious remarks about one’s family. 
A still more remarkable illustration is the rarity of incest. There is nothing 
in our instinctive endowment to make incestuous relations unattractive. 
Yet a traditional standard, passed down from generation to generation merely 
as a presupposition about which almost nothing is said, holds instinct in 
complete control, nay, has all the force of a negative instinct or impossibility 
of desire. 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  
THE FAMILY 209 
will, and genuine self-sacrifice may lack real respect for the per- 
sonality of the one on whose behalf the sacrifice is made. Even 
a firm, steady, and genuinely benevolent family government 
may fail to produce in the children any heartfelt respect for law 
simply because the government to which they are subjected is 
an autocracy. ‘Thus it is that out of the same domestic spring 
may come water both bitter and sweet—regard for some rights, 
disregard for others equally basal; respect for persons in one 
classification, disrespect for persons in another; tenderness in 
some human relations, callousness in others; sincere belief in 
the Christian ideal of brotherhood, sincerity in conduct that 
obviously defeats it. 
Here is the explanation of the paradox in a rather common 
attitude of men toward women. Almost every child experi- 
ences tender maternal affection; hence almost every man re- 
tains through life some capacity for noble emotion with respect 
to his own mother and with respect to motherhood in general. 
Men who have this emotion commonly assume that they hold 
an exalted view of womanhood. Yet many of them regard 
marriage as properly the subjection of a woman to a man. 
Many of them are willing to accept profits that depend upon 
risks to the health and the morals of working women. Men 
glorify motherhood in one breath, and in the next buy from 
a hundred girls their capacity for competent motherhood ! 
Moreover, how is it that reverence for womanhood “because 
one has had a mother” can exist in the same breast with accep- 
tance of prostitution as a matter of course? The key to this 
situation is this: Boys—and girls too—acquire in the family a 
second sort of presupposition with respect to womanhood, a 
presupposition based upon the habitual attitude of the males 
in the family to wife, daughter, or sister. How far would one 
overshoot the truth if one should assert that rarely does a boy 
acquire in his own family a firm presupposition that girls are 
his equals? It is because boys grow up as intimate parts of 
actual sex inequality that men fail to see the grotesqueness of 
the assumption that one sex has an inherent right to determine 
the “ proper sphere”’ of the other. Is there not, in fact, a trace 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  210 THE FAMILY 
of condescension or patronage even in the common glorification 
of “mother”? Admiring tenderness is easier, too, than justice. 
Thus it is that fundamental social assumptions and habits— 
those that concern the valuation of the individual, personal 
liberty, social classifications, the relations of the sexes, the right 
of property, the nature of law, and the sphere of government— 
flow from the large society into the small family society, and 
thence back into the large society. 1f we desire to reform any 
one of them, there can be no more effective measure than to 
induce parents to reorganize family life. If the Christian 
churches really believe in universal brotherhood, with its 
inevitable corollary of a world-democracy, let them begin now 
to form democratic presuppositions and habits at the source. 
On what conditions can family life educate for democracy? 
The general answer is, By being, in its measure, a co-operative 
group of the deliberative type. The family is to prepare chil- 
dren for democracy by being itself a democracy. On the 
face of the matter, is it not absurd to think that inequality and 
arbitrary rule within the society in which an individual spends 
his most plastic years can prepare him to labor toward a society 
that is based on exactly contrary principles? 
It will be objected, of course, that any attempt to make the 
family into a deliberative group will hit upon the rock of chil- 
dren’s incapacity for deliberation, the discontinuity of their 
attention, the fact that it is child nature to act immediately in 
one way or another. Does not the practical impossibility of 
suspense and postponement render it necessary for the father 
and the mother to make decisions for the child, blocking the 
way to harmful acts, and moving him by their power rather 
than his own into wholesome ways? ‘To argue thus, however, 
is to miss the main point of the problem, and to act thus is to 
miss an opportunity for the social education of the young. 
The main question is, What sort of experience tends to make the 
child into a socially deliberative individual? What is the most 
certain and the most rapid way to enfranchise him? To pro- 
vide the conditions for this sort of experience is the base-line of 
social education. Upon this basis the family must present to 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
      THE FAMILY 211 
the child opportunity for fellowship in fundamental, outgoing 
brotherhood. An outline of some of these conditions will in- 
dicate the direction in which the Christian reorganization of 
the family has to move. 
(1) Abandon the doctrine and the practice of the inequality of 
the sexes. If children are bred in the assumption that even 
among the persons with whom they have the most intimate and 
affectionate relations nature itself has established a permanent, 
impassable division between the rulers and the ruled, the served 
and the servers, if children go into the world saturated with any 
such assumption, the males, already accustomed to the in- 
dividualistic satisfactions of a superior caste, will tend to lord 
it wherever they can, and the females, unaccustomed to free 
initiative, will withhold from society services that they are by 
nature well qualified to render. It is hard to imagine a way in 
which Christianity could more decisively promote appreciation 
of humanity as such, which is the spirit of brotherhood, than 
the abolition of the sex caste in Christian families. 
Tender, admiring, reverential affection, ennobling though 
it be to the one who feels it, is no proper substitute for the 
recognition of equality. Not seldom tenderness contains in it- 
self the unrecognized but cruel poison of wanting to keep its 
object, whether wife or child, permanently dependent and in- 
ferior. On the other hand, the recipient of such regard is often 
pampered thereby into selfish receptivity, or else beguiled into 
a narrow, almost slavish devotion which in turn pampers the 
man who accepts it. Thus, love itself, acting under the assump- 
tion of permanent inequality between the lovers, arrests the 
growth of the social capacities of both. Even within the family 
this arrest often manifests itself in hypertrophied demands of 
either lover upon the other. Whether or not children witness 
such marital infelicity, they have no experience that enables 
them to see the social significance of the inequality in the midst 
of which they live. They take this inequality as a matter of 
nature, as something self-evident. They accept the satis- 
factions that it brings, or accommodate themselves to the limi- 
tations involved, and so go into the world with a fundamental    
-P-A-G-E-224
  212 THE FAMILY 
defect in their faith in man and in their preparation for a world 
brotherhood. | 
(2) Develop capacity for deliberative group life by respecting 
and effectively utilizing any such capacity, however slight, that 
any member already possesses. 'The right to be heard, the right 
to have one’s ideas and desires weighed by others, is the re- 
verse side of the duty to listen and to be ready, when the com- 
mon good requires it, to waive one’s wishes. The reciprocal 
relation between rights and duties holds not only as between 
adult and adult, but also as between adults and children. Par- 
ents who do not listen and weigh ought not to be surprised if 
their progeny is heedless and stiff-necked. Parents who never 
“own up” to a fault, and never make open amends, may expect 
to encounter the same sort of infallibility in their children. The 
difficulty of developing a democratic family organization lies 
Jess in children’s limitations than in the stiffness and unadap- 
tability that are fostered by current conceptions of parental 
dignity and authority. Children like to talk things over seri- 
ously when they know that the outcome of the conversation has 
not been arbitrarily predetermined. An artificial class-dis- 
tinction exists in many a family because parents underestimate 
the thought-capacity of their children. What surer way can 
there be to create in children a class-consciousness that is un- 
sympathetic and impervious to parental authority? Any- 
thing that prevents the honest, serious, and effective utilization 
of childish capacities tends to stunt them. To be a listening 
parent implies much more than giving attention to com- 
plaint or clamor when it arises; it means also consulting chil- 
dren, sharing with them the really important problems of the 
family, and letting them participate in working out solutions. 
It means, too, that this consultative relation between parent 
and child is to be extended and developed as fast as the child’s 
mental grasp increases. 
(3) In a democratic family each member will perform regular, 
defined, personal services for the maintenance of the common life. 
This innocent-looking proposition is full of sharp points. Each 
member will contribute personal service, which is a thing that 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
    THE FAMILY 213 
money cannot buy and that cannot be done by proxy. Personal 
service may take the form of earning money for family use, but 
there is much “supporting one’s family” that does not include 
giving oneself. Providing plenty of “servants” is not at all the 
same as contributing personal service. Every member of the 
family will be in his own person a servant of the family, being 
made thereby conformable to the Great Servant who has re- 
vealed in his own person the great God. Here child and 
parent will meet on the truly democratic plane of industry, 
useful labor, done co-operatively for the common weal, and with 
no compensation except the common weal. Finally, the ser- 
vice that is required of each individual will have a defined 
sphere, beyond which one may indeed give but no one may de- 
mand. When the service of love, freely given, becomes sub- 
serviency to unregulated, and hence unsocialized, calls for 
service, the result is little more than slavery. Its undemocratic 
character is not relieved by the fact that the slave loves the 
master and willingly obeys. 
(4) In a democratic family each member will have a defined 
sphere in which he is entitled to initiative, and likewise one in 
which his own judgment is final. Dependence of a child upon the 
decisions of others is to be reduced as rapidly as is consistent 
with physical safety, health, and the continuance of his educa- 
tion. Doing for oneself all that one is competent to do is a 
significant contribution to the common weal, and it is highly ed- 
ucative. Self-reliant experimentation must be encouraged even 
though we are certain that errors will be made, and from the 
uncomfortable effects of his errors a child must not be too much 
shielded. The important thing is not to get the most perfect 
possible immediate result, but to promote growth, to develop 
individuality that is both independent and co-operative. A 
good example of the principle is presented by certain parents 
who grant each child a regular allowance of money, require 
open and accurate accounting, increase the amount with 
growth, and require each child increasingly to purchase his own 
clothing from his own income, first with aid from the parent in 
the way of explanations as to colors, durability, style, etc., but
-P-A-G-E-226
  214 THE FAMILY 
later without consultation. What a blunder it is to keep on 
deciding everything for a child up to young manhood or young 
womanhood, under the expectation that then, by some hocus- 
pocus of benevolent nature he will suddenly acquire good judg- 
ment! And the worst thing about this policy is not that it 
puts upon young men and young women tasks for which they 
have not been prepared, but that it leaves their social capacities 
uncultivated. To keep children dependent-willed as long as 
possible is to isolate them into a social class even under their 
father’s own roof. Denying them the experience of progressive 
co-operative judging, it fits them for none but arbitrary social 
relations thereafter. 
(5) Democracy in the family is to be promoted by providing 
common pleasures. Not long ago I learned of a family in which 
the father as well as the mother takes part regularly in the chil- 
dren’s daily story hour preceding bedtime. In another instance 
a father and mother provided a combination dining-table and 
billiard-table, and evening after evening played interesting 
matches with their children. It is a sinister sign if father, 
mother, adolescent boy, and adolescent girl must all go out of 
the home and away from one another in order to have a good 
time. The sign is sinister even if the diversions that are sought 
are unobjectionable in themselves, for the absence of common 
pleasures is the absence of a most important social cement. 
When a parent and a child frolic together they become ac- 
quainted with each other. Each finds in the other personality 
riches that would otherwise, perhaps, be unsuspected. Family 
life is famishing for want of deep acquaintance between parents 
and their own offspring. And not only do common pleasures 
reveal one to another, but—under the basal law of habit forma- 
tion that satisfaction in an act tends to prolongation and repeti- 
tion thereof—they help toward the deep and permanent attach- 
ments that hold through adversity as well as through happiness. 
Thus it is that playing together; enjoying literature, music, 
and pictures together; making family excursions into the open; 
going together to places of amusement, and even common in- 
dulgence in jolly nonsense have the deep ethical value of join- 
ing person to person in a society of reciprocal good will. 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE FAMILY 215 
(6) The unity of the family cannot be made perfect until family 
consciousness is fused with a wider social consciousness, particu- 
larly through participation by all members of the family in remedial 
and constructive social enterprises. The mere fact that the 
children, when they marry, and in the social acquaintanceships 
that precede marriage, link their own family with others is of 
itself sufficient to prove that regard for one’s own flesh and blood 
is an expansive principle. The weal of my family is inextri- 
cably bound up in a thousand ways with that of others. Chil- 
dren of different families play together, go to school together; 
infect one another with disease germs, with smutty ideas, with 
bad habits; later they employ one another or are employed, 
they bargain with one another, they vote for or against one an- 
other, they determine the sanitary and moral conditions of 
the community. The child of wealth who was infected with a 
fatal disease by wearing a garment made in a sweat-shop illus- 
trates a solidarity that no individual or family can escape. 
There is simply no possibility of fulfilling love in a narrow circle 
except by treating the circle as a section of the total social 
sphere. The exclusive family is the self-undermining family. 
Therefore the building up of deliberative group living in the 
family must be continuous with the building forth of the same 
thing in the community. It is not enough that the father 
should contribute of his substance and of his energy to the out- 
going social enterprises of the church or of the neighborhood— 
the family as a family should talk them over, weigh the needs, 
form a united purpose, and work together for the fulfilment of it. 
Even young children can participate from the heart in great 
social enterprises because the greatness of a social enterprise 
grows out of the elemental character of the human need that it 
seeks to meet. ‘There is perhaps no defect of society that does 
not inflict hunger and sickness upon children, and this appeals 
to any child. Moreover, children’s imaginations easily seize 
upon some point of difference between better and worse social 
conditions—between good and poor school buildings and 
grounds; clean and unclean streets and alleys; sanitary fac- 
tories and unsanitary sweat-shops; humane and inhumane 
conditions in industries and in housing; war and peace, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  216 THE FAMILY 
much more. When the missionary enterprise is clearly con- 
scious of its social calling, it comes home to children with the 
force of reality, and not as an abstract propaganda. ‘The par- 
ticipation of children in the social movement should, of course, 
be graded; new enterprises will allure as power of analysis and 
continuity of purpose grow. But this does not mean that 
small children can have a vital part in none but small enter- 
prises. The elemental character of their social attitudes joins 
them directly and simply with their elders in great undertak- 
ings. And besides, fellowship with a parent in doing some- 
thing that the parent feels to be important brings its own de- 
light, its own sense of the reality of the matter. 
Finally, a noble common purpose, and united labor and if 
need be suffering for another, are essential to the full realiza- 
tion of intimate affection. If we go back far enough in the 
evolution of marriage we find that mating is a temporary 
affair, not yet marriage in the proper sense. How is it, then, 
that such fleeting sex attraction has grown as far as it has 
already done toward lasting conjugal affection? In spite of 
prevalent defects in marriage, and of the great underworld of 
infidelity on the part of both the married and the unmarried, 
the world already contains numberless instances of unsullied, 
lifelong affection between one man and one woman, and, more- 
over, in the presence of a standard like this the world does not 
condemn the standard but itself, or at most seeks excuses for 
the despite that it still does to such love. What has brought 
this about is the presence of children who needed long years 
of care. Thus, historically considered, conjugal affection is 
not the prius of parental love, but just the reverse. It is the 
child who binds the parents together. Love grows rich enough 
to defy time and the fluctuations of sexual desire because there 
is common work for the lovers to do, yes, because their fondness 
for each other goes out and takes in a third. This is not an 
isolated fact, but a law of life. Idle affection grows stagnant. 
Our friendships, our social circles, our churches, and our fam- 
ilies find life for themselves only as they bestow life upon 
others. 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
THE FAMILY 217 
(7) These conditions cannot be met without the domestication 
of private property. Family life is psychophysical. Affection 
between its members is embodied, incarnate. The family 
table is not only its symbol, but also one of its important in- 
struments. In the fellowship of eating and drinking the domes- 
tication of private property is taken for granted. “If any pro- 
videth not for his own. . . household, he hath denied the faith, 
and is worse than an unbeliever.” But if this is so obvious, 
why do we not see that upon the same principle all the property 
that any member of the family has should be domesticated ? 
For what is property if not means for human life? And what 
is the right of property if not a call to the enlargement of life? 
And what is the family but partnership in life and in the pro- 
motion of living? And how can there be the supreme fellow- 
ship of a common, outgoing purpose if one member of the 
group is the autocratic master of the means whereby the group 
itself lives and of the means whereby the group might enrich 
other life than its own? The reservation of such mastership 
as a right, even though its actual exercise be liberal, is simply 
incompatible with the thorough domestication of the master’s 
will. 
Christian teaching has long recognized that there is a cleft 
between property as a legal right and property as a moral 
obligation. ‘The law sustains me absolutely if I withhold my 
goods while my neighbor starves; it protects the sharp bar- 
gains whereby I accumulate goods at the expense of others; 
and, as to the family, it lays upon me only the mild obligation 
of feeding, clothing, and sheltering wife and children, leaving 
to my sense or my whim the feeding or the starving of their 
other capacities. Our religion constantly admonishes us to 
be better in these respects than the law requires us to be. But 
at the centre of the problem of private property, which is the 
family hearth, there is as yet no clear interpretation of the 
Christian law of brotherhood. The common assumption is that 
God requires nothing more of the individual in whom the legal 
title inheres than a certain arbitrary benevolence toward the 
members of his own family. The admonition to even this 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  218 THE FAMILY 
modicum of virtue is not vociferous! This assumption lacks, 
too, the definiteness of the legal right to withhold—a right that 
individualistic love of power guards with jealousy, and even 
confuses with moral right. 
Here, in short, is an ancient wall of division within the family 
itself, a class distinction, a fundamental denial of brotherhood. 
Property comes between persons. It is, to be sure, a wall of 
glass only; any member of the family may look through it at 
the good deeds wrought by the member who is on the other 
side, but one may not reach one’s hands through so as to share 
in the doing of the good deeds. In how many churches do hus- 
bands and wives make contributions as equals? How many 
holders of the purse escape being infected with the silent as- 
sumption that those whom one “supports” are dependents, 
inferiors, persons to be controlled by giving and withholding, or 
perchance favorites who are to be attached to oneself by lar- 
gesses ? } 
This is not the atmosphere of democracy, and children who 
are brought up in it are not being adequately prepared to take 
the full part of a Christian in the great and growingly acute 
economic struggle. To be merciful and to be moderate will 
not be sufficient to reconstruct our social order. Something 
far more sacrificial will be required of us if the distribution of 
goods, which is the distribution of power and opportunity to 
live, is to become brotherly. Even if we are not yet certain 
which of several forks of the road to take in the legal! revision 
of economic inequalities and injustices, there is no reason why 
we should not set to work at once to give love full sway in family 
education. This will involve, first and foremost, the beginning 
of economic enfranchisement for married women by the volun- 
tary act of husbands. It would be a great step if a stated 
amount were to be received by each married woman as her 
earnings, to be disposed of with freedom equal to that of the 
1 What unconscious irony there is in the frequent boast of men who insist 
upon the inequality of the sexes, ‘‘We hold women to be our superiors.”’

makes Kumo’s husband say, but she replies: ‘‘No, no, no! Iam not going

-P-A-G-E-231

husband in the disposition of his own earnings or income. 
But beyond this will come partnership between husband and 
wife as equals in stewardship of the entire family income. 
The constant problem will be how to do the most good with 
what we have, and not seldom there will be the added problem 
of how we shall increase this our power to do good—that is, 
the wife will not be an outsider to any of her husband’s business 
concerns. What this implies in the training of girls and young 
women isevident. It will make for a sturdier domestic character 
in women—and in men, too. And—here is our present con- 
cern—it will introduce the children, both boys and girls, to the 
democratic spirit in actual operation, and it will furnish a stand- 
ard whereby they will be able to detect the various tyrannies 
that creep, under other titles, through modern society. 
Finally, the domestication of property will include the gradual 
economic enfranchisement of each child. That is, he will be 
given control of property, but held to social responsibilities. 
By “social responsibilities” is meant not only one’s share of 
domestic labor, but also one’s share in studying (which should 
have economic recognition as productive labor), and one’s share 
in social enterprises in church and community. The whole 
should be treated from the beginning of the child’s experience 
of money, not as private gain from being good, but as participa- 
tion in the family’s enterprise, and thereby as participation 
in the life of the community. In short, in the family the child’s 
experience of property can and should be an experience of some- 
thing that binds men together, not of something that keeps them 
apart. CN 
The interest of religion in the economic status of the 
family. What has just been said assumes the existence of 
what may be called well-to-do living conditions such as: 
Housing that is not only sanitary, but also adequate, in space 
and in furnishings, for happy group life, and for distributed 
home duties. 
Culture material, such as books and music and pictures. 
Opportunity for each child to have schooling as far as his 
abilities and his interests can carry him. 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  220 THE FAMILY 
Sufficient leisure on the part of parents to enable them to 
spend considerable time in the company of their children. 
Sufficient freedom from fatiguing labor to make it possible 
for parents to play with their children. 
Sufficient income to enable the family to take part in com- 
munity affairs, such as religious, philanthropic, recreational, 
cultural, and civie enterprises. 
Every one of these conditions is important for the religious 
education of children in the family. Yet families whose place 
in the economic scale is below that of the “middle class” are 
ipso facto excluded from one or more of these conditions, in 
multitudes of cases from all of them. 
That many beautiful characters bloom out of domestic dep- 
rivation; that suffering itself sometimes brings the sufferers 
close to one another; that much improvement of home training 
is possible even under the conditions that prevail below the 
“middle class family”’—all this is true and important. But it 
is not an appreciable offset to the economic depression that is 
upon multitudes of families, upon them not merely as an 
occasional emergency, but upon them permanently as the un- 
escapable grip of an economic fate. Our glorification of the 
higher life—the life of persons united with one another by 
good will—is ignorant mockery if we do not see that depriva- 
tion of nutrition, of the company of parents, of the physical 
things whereby knowledge and beauty and good will are com- 
municated from man to man, is deprivation of opportunity to 
be a person, deprivation of opportunity to form a good will. 
Therefore the cause of social education in the family is all 
one with the demand for improving the economic status of the 
family as such. Every Christian church and every Christian 
family may be expected to identify themselves, as a matter that 
involves their own life or death, with such movements as these: 
To abolish child labor; 
To shorten the hours of labor for men and for women; 
To improve the sanitary and moral conditions of labor; 
To increase the income of most families; 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
THE FAMILY 221 
To forestall unemployment, and to provide for accident, sickness, 
and old age; 
To improve housing conditions; 
To provide playgrounds, wholesome amusements, and cultural 
opportunities for every community; 
To remove the saloon, the haunts of vice, and degrading amuse- 
ments; 
To keep the organs of the community life—local and other govern- 
mental officials—responsive to the needs and views of the masses; 
To improve the human stock by adequate supervision of health, 
by preventing the propagation of obviously unfit strains, and by 
inducing wiser mating; 
To provide a diversified education that, keeping close to the 
people, shall be adapted on the one hand to their industrial 
needs, and on the other hand to bringing out and developing 
to the full whatever special talent individuals may possess. 
There are various ways of putting on the harness of a cause 
like this. Three of these ways that have a particularly close 
relation to religious education may be mentioned: (a) Religious 
education in the Sunday school may well include participation in 
these movements at the points where they most obviously touch 
child life. (6) The family can reinforce the Sunday school at 
these points, feeding during the week the interests that are 
aroused on Sunday, or even anticipating the Sunday school by 
taking social problems to it. (c) Most communities contain 
families that are depressed by the conditions that have just been 
analyzed. Here pastoral visitation may well include an in- 
quiry into the child life of the community, and groups of adults 
may well undertake community surveys, and then adopt such 
community programs as the conditions seem to require. 
The problem of family worship. For some years there 
have been complaints that family religion is declining. The 
old customs of family prayer, catechizing, and direct, personal 
religious appeal from parent to child have largely disappeared. 
The reasons for this disappearance are found partly in industrial 
and other conditions of modern society that separate the mem- 
bers of the family for many hours of the day, and partly in sheer 
parental neglect. ‘The remedy that is most often attempted is 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 THE FAMILY 
mutual incitement of ministers by one another to arouse parents 
to re-establish “the family altar.” In spite of untoward con- 
ditions, it is said, time can be found for devotions, and if neces- 
sary some sacrifice of other interests should be made in order 
that children may grow up in the knowledge and the practice of 
religion. 
That agitation of this kind has had little practical effect 
would probably be admitted by all. The so-called seculariza- 
tion of the family—even of church families—goes on apace 
even though we continually declare that the issue is a vital one 
for our religion. Is it not possible that some elements of the 
problem have been left out of the account? For example, has 
not the accusation of parental neglect covered, in addition to 
infirmity of purpose, a certain bewilderment for which parents 
are not responsible? ‘Two generations back there was relatively 
little question as to the sort of religious ideas that should be 
presented to children. Almost any part of the Bible might be 
read at family worship, for it was all alike the word of God. 
No caution was necessary as to the impression made upon chil- 
dren by a biblical passage, for a particular interpretation, im- 
posed by authority, was the sovereign antidote for all errors. 
How to pray was clear, for the outline of the dogmatic system 
needed only to be rephrased in order to appear as worship. 
Catechizing was the simple process of drilling certain finished 
ideas or verbal formulas into the memory. Even personal relig- 
ious appeal could follow an easy and uniform tradition as to the 
lost estate of man and the conditions of salvation. 
It is scarcely necessary to say that neither the content nor 
the method of such family religion can be restored. The duty 
that is before us is not restoration, but revision and reconstruc- 
tion from the foundation upward. Parents are bewildered be- 
cause they do not see what sort of reasonable religious life can 
be shared in any vital way by parents and children. The preach- 
ing of religion as life in distinction from dogma, and the proc- 
lamation of the social content of the gospel, have not made 
sufficiently clear as yet what these things imply with respect 
to the domestic circle. 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
THE FAMILY 223 
Let us come at once to the core of the matter. The recon- 
struction of fireside religion will require the formation within 
the family of common social purposes so deep that they reach 
the level of worship. The principle that underlies the discussion, 
in an earlier chapter, of the church as an organization of worship 
applies to the family also. Not by saying: “Lord, Lord”’ shall 
we introduce children to Christ, but rather by giving them 
a share in Christly enterprises, and then letting the motive 
thereof come to full consciousness as fellowship with Jesus and 
with the Father. Here will be found a guide for the selection of 
biblical passages that are really appropriate for family worship, 
passages that will be luminous to children as well as to adults. 
Here, too, will be found a language for prayer that parents and 
children can use in the same sense. The common joys of the 
family will utter themselves in gratitude, and so will the joys 
of others with whom the members of the family feel their unity. 
Conjoint confession of sin will have meaning because the con- 
trasts of life will be revealed in the enterprise of social living. 
From the same vital source will spring the inextinguishable social 
aspiration that is the heart of intercession, namely, the identi- 
fication of our claim upon life itself with the claim of others. 
Children will realize the presence of God, just as their parents 
will do, in the “love that will not let us go,’’ the love that is 
at once command, and condemnation, and reconciliation, and 
the power of a higher life. 
Education for married life and for parenthood. The sort 
of sex-consciousness that refuses to face the conditions essential 
to the rational—that is, socially foresighted—control of one of 
the primal factors in social weal or woe is an immodest “ mod- 
esty.”’ ‘The essence of the immodesty lies in making self promi- 
nent in the thought of sex. Once we take the social point of 
view with respect to it, the whole perspective changes. Frank- 
ness then becomes natural and wholesome wherever discussion of 
the physiological and the ethical laws involved in the sexual life 
can contribute anything to a better society. Specific prepara- 
tion for marriage and for parenthood then becomes a funda- 
mental interest of religious education. In the divorce evil we
-P-A-G-E-236
224 THE FAMILY 
are reaping tares that were sown while Christian education was 
asleep to its social calling. While it distributed among the 
youth maxims of private goodness and of individualistic salva- 
tion, the conditions of modern life were loosing the family from 
its old moorings, but providing it with no chart or compass for 
its voyage. The prevalence of divorce, moreover, is only 
an acute symptom of a general failure to reorganize the family 
upon a higher social plane when the old, semi-patriarchal basis 
began its inevitable crumbling.! The churches have before 
them the task of transforming life in church families in accor- 
dance with the social principles of the gospel. ‘This implies 
far more than fresh legislation on marriage and divorce, far more 
than palliation of strains that arise in a family that lacks a 
clear, outgoing social purpose; it implies nothing less than in- 
structing and training children specifically for marriage and 
parenthood as the first and foremost sphere for the deliberate 
organization and control of society as a democracy of God. 
Not only is sex-instruction necessary as a part of religious 
education, but the level of this instruction must be made utterly 
social. The avoidance of harm to oneself must be simply a 
phase of a positive purpose of good for others. All the “Thou 
shalt nots,” which have been presented hitherto as laws of 
one’s own individual perfection or righteousness, are to be trans- 
formed into parts of an ambition to marry, to contribute to the 
happiness of a spouse, to have healthy, happy children, and 
through them to contribute to the larger society. Here is the 
point of view that should prevail with respect to prostitution. 
A purpose to keep oneself uncontaminated is not enough. 
There is needed the truly Christian identification of one’s own 
interests with those of others, with the interests of every har- 
lot and of every girl who may yet be tempted, of every male 
victim and of every boy who is in danger. 
1It would be interesting if one could arrange in parallel columns the resolu- 
tions of ecclesiastical assemblies with regard to marriage and divorce, and the 
sermons and Sunday-school instruction upon the same subject within the same 
communions. It would be found, I surmise, that as yet the churches have 
scarcely begun to use the power that they possess for preventing the evils that 
they urge the state to rectify by legislation. 
   
-P-A-G-E-237
    THE FAMILY 225 
Thus it is that problems of personal purity open out into a 
wide social perspective. They open out toward the family, 
and toward all the economic conditions that depress its life; 
they open out toward the causes that unduly postpone marriage; 
to those that keep white slavery going—both the social and 
economic causes that add to the force of instinct, and the polit- 
ical causes that give power to the organization of vice. The 
question is truly as wide as one’s outlook for the race. The 
question of the eugenic regulation of mating is, with all the rest, 
a part of the problem of a possible democracy of God. In short, 
religious education must deal with the whole sexual life as a 
sphere for deliberate, constructive, social purpose. It must 
instruct parents as to their part in unfolding these high and holy 
things to their children. It must support the state and other 
agencies in every enlightened effort to spread knowledge and 
social standards. It must itself instruct, inspire, and train 
the young with marriage and parenthood frankly in view, and 
it must be ready to assist inexperienced parents with the best 
knowledge that is anywhere available.
-P-A-G-E-238
CHAPTER XVI 
THE CHURCH SCHOOL 
Popular education is the central function of a church. 
If the church were simply a purveyor of spiritual goods, a sort 
of “general store” of the soul, its educational work would not 
necessarily involve much more than the training of the ministry. 
But if the church is an agency for developing in the people a 
certain sort of self-control, especially one that is difficult of 
achievement, then popular education becomes a fundamental 
ecclesiastical necessity. It is a necessity because of the inerad- 
icable difference between the plasticity of childhood and the 
relative fixity of maturity. True, maturity is only relatively 
rigid; modifications of character occur at any age, and conver- 
sions that reverse the whole current of life are scattered through 
the history of the church. Our religion glories, and should 
glory, in its power to rescue shipwrecked characters. But the 
supreme test of its power lies in the prevention of wrecks. To 
put the matter in terms of construction rather than in terms of 
disaster, the predominant function of the church is to get 
Christian motives into control of the growing powers of chil- 
dren and youth. This function predominates in religion pre- 
cisely as sanitation and hygiene predominate in matters of 
public health. More than this, the educational function must 
predominate in Christianity because of what Christianity is. 
For: 
(1) The church can maintain the spirit of prophecy within 
aself only by educating the people. The priestly function of 
dispensing benefits can be handed on from priest to priest with- 
out intervention of the people, but prophetic insight into life’s 
problems, and prophetic zeal for truly divine justice come 
226 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
THE CHURCH SCHOOL 227 
, 
“up from the burning core below,” up from the “common” 
people, not down from any privileged class. If the ministry 
desires to avoid stagnation, let it keep close to the people; 
yes, let it train the people to make great demands upon the 
church. If the church is not to be a belated follower of the social 
conscience, a sort of “me too” among philanthropic societies 
and organizations for reform; if the church is to be a perpetual 
inspiration to the human longing for a humane life, a perpetual 
organ for the manifestation of the God of love—if this is to con- 
stitute the very life of the church, then it must continuously 
stimulate the fresh spirits of the young to make greater and 
greater demands upon life. Not to keep human vitality in 
prearranged grooves, but to enlarge its desires, widen its out- 
look, make it more critical of things as they are, and more ready 
to pay the cost of social reconstruction—this is religious educa- 
tion upon the prophetic level. It involves of necessity ever- 
renewed criticism of the church and of its ministry from the 
standpoint of human need, and ever-recurring necessity for 
inner reconstruction of ecclesiastical life and purpose. This 
is what it means to maintain the spirit of prophecy. This 
spirit is the divine love-impulse circulating upward from the 
needs of the people, and pouring itself wherever it can into the 
hearts of those who can help.! 
(2) Education of the people is an indispensable means for cor- 
recting the faults of the church. Errors of learning, defects in 
standards, and inefficiencies in methods, all require as their cor- 
rective one or another sort of democratic judgment. Errors 
in learning are corrected by the methods of science, which is 
the democracy of the intellect. Scientific method spreads be- 
fore the whole world every esoteric doctrine. Here hoary pre- 
rogative has no standing; here every one must become as a 
little child who gazes unabashed upon anything whatever, and 
‘10 Is Christianity Practicable? (New York, 1916), William Adams Brown 
has given striking evidence of this spiritual law of the church's life. The 
powerlessness of the churches everywhere to avert the present world calamity, 
and the dominance of church consciousness by nationalistic assumptions in 
all the warring countries, point back to failure to educate the commonalty 
in the world outlook that is inherent in the Christian principle of brotherhood. 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  228 THE CHURCH SCHOOL 
tells without reserve what he has seen. The emancipation of 
the church from its chief ancient errors with respect to the 
Scriptures, for example, came about, not by exercising any self- 
sufficient ecclesiastical prerogative, but by opening ecclesiastical 
doors to democratic scientific methods that were already preva- 
lent outside. 
This represents a general law. The church can save itself 
only by the help of those to whom it is sent; it has a vital in- 
terest in stimulating them to the largest use of their native ca- 
pacities. Even in respect to standards of conduct ecclesiastical 
self-sufficiency is self-delusion. That the church’s officially pro- 
claimed standards can fall behind those of church members and 
of outsiders we all know right well. It is necessary time and 
again to convert the church as one step in a social reform. 
Nor is this anomalous; it represents a law of the growth and 
decay of institutions. Self-involution on the part of any insti- 
tution involves decay of its social value. Granted that the 
church is the inheritor of imperishable truth; does it follow 
therefrom that she always understands and uses the riches that 
are under her hand? Nothing, in fact, but the cry of the people 
for a richer life can keep her awake to the exhaustlessness of 
the treasure that she carries. 
If this is true of standards of conduct, how much more true is 
it of methods of work. It is a trite remark that institutional 
procedures that arise in response to a particular situation tend 
to perpetuate themselves regardless of changes of situation, 
and therefore regardless of efficiency. Institutions tend to 
measure their duty by their own past performances. Hence 
the necessity of popular judgments, unhampered by habit, by 
vested interests, or by pride of official consistency. 
Thus, on all accounts, the church needs a policy of unreserve 
in religious education. Does some one suggest that the churches 
are embarrassed at the present moment by popular criticism? 
Or that religious education should therefore adopt a defensive 
policy? The reply is that the danger to the churches from 
the prevalent popular criticism arises from the fact that it is 
not thoroughgoing enough; it demands too little of us, not too 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
THE CHURCH SCHOOL 229 
much, it tends to beget in us a multitude of insignificant accom- 
modations instead of a more fundamental, more creative, pur- 
pose. The social deficiences of the religious education of the 
past are thus returning upon our own heads through the pal- 
try demands that the people make upon the church. 
(3) Through popular education the church makes its chief con- 
tribution to the community life. What has just been said con- 
cerns the maintenance and the improvement of the church itself 
as an organ of divine inspiration. The conclusion that we have 
reached may be summarily stated as follows: As it is the char- 
acter of God to give himself forth into human life, and as self- 
forgetting service is the great law of individual vitality, so ecclesi- 
astical institutions can escape institutionalzsm only through the 
influence of an awakened commonalty. The church must 
educate the people, then, for the sake of its own perpetuity and 
self-improvement. 
The power that the church should desire to have is power 
to transform the common life, and this means the community. 
Religious education must be outgoing as truly as foreign mis- 
sions. “Come unto me,” said Jesus, but when men had come 
to him he said to them “Go.” This is the spirit of enlightened 
Christian education. It seeks to lay upon pupils a mission. 
It does, indeed, say: “Come into the church fellowship,” but 
it adds: “Let us go.” There is no denying, however, that the 
“Come” has been far more in evidence than the “Go.” Re- 
ligious education has had too prominently in mind membership 
in the church, and not prominently enough membership in the 
community. Both the church and the community have suf- 
fered as a consequence. 
But an awakening is upon us. As never before, proclama- 
tions of the Christian religion as social reconstruction issue 
from pulpits and from ecclesiastical assemblies. But these 
proclamations are addressed for the most part to mature men 
and women whose social habits are already formed, and whose 
occupations and stations in life have already enmeshed them in 
social unrighteousness. ‘The most that can be expected directly 
from these persons is some amelioration of bad conditions. 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
  230 THE CHURCH SCHOOL 
To their children will be left the more basal parts of social re- 
construction. Just here is where the church will make its chief 
contribution to the common life—by providing a constant and 
increasing supply of young people who have social outlook and 
purpose before they cast their first vote, and before they enter 
upon their life-occupations.! 
The idea of a department of education in the local religious 
society. The clergy of to-day, if we may judge by conditions 
that are prevalent in the churches, commonly look upon educa- 
tion as an adjunct of the church, an appendix of the ministry, 
which requires only such strength and such means as may be 
left over after other things are attended to. If this looks like 
a harsh judgment, test it by instituting a survey of the twenty 
churches nearest to you, a survey that will compare expendi- 
ture for religious education with expenditure for other things 
in three respects: (a) Hours per week given to religious educa- 
tion by salaried officials as compared with hours given to other 
interests; (b) A similar comparison of annual fiscal expenditure, 
salaries included; (c) A comparison of the space used for re- 
ligious education with that used for other purposes, a compari- 
son that shall include both amount of room and degree of adap- 
tation. 
It would doubtless be unjust to charge any one with stupidity 
in this matter. Ministers, like the rest of us, are made what 
they are by social conditions. It is impossible, too, not to 
sympathize with pastors upon whom there falls such a multi- 
plicity of burdens that no strength is left for the improvement of 
parish education. Yet it must be said that this heaping of 
1 From the sporadic attempts at whirlwind reforms that one witnesses here 
and there, one might suppose: (1) That social wrongs like the saloon, white 
slavery, unemployment, seven-day labor, child labor, poverty. and war, are 
discontinuous parts of the social complex, each of which might be cleaned 
up by itself once and forall. Itisnotso. Social wrongs not only intertwine, 
they are continuous with one another, like teeth, ssophagus, and stomach. 
(2) That, after certain reforms are accomplished, the church will be able to 
devote itself wholly to its more particular work. Again, it is not so. The 
particular work of the church is the radical transformation of society. The 
fundamental difference between the church and other institutions is the 
radical character of its social principle, a principle within which is included 
Christianity 's limitless hope for each individual. 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  THE CHURCH SCHOOL 231 
miscellaneous duties upon one another occurs because of the 
lack of an adequate organizing principle for the pastoral office. 
The question that needs to be answered is not, “How can I 
possibly do more things?” but “What is my perspective? 
Which things are large, and which ones small? What is funda- 
mental, and what accessory? Which sort of labor brings the 
largest returns?” 
In view of present insight into the church’s duty to the com- 
munity, and in view of the agitation for religious education 
that has been going on for years, one might say, without un- 
charitableness, that the minister of the future will indeed be 
stupid if he permits himself to be made a pack-horse, or an all- 
‘round handy man, when he is called of God to be a prophet. 
The spirit of prophecy, when it comes among us, will doubtless 
manifest itself in many ways, but one of them will surely be the 
organization of genuine departments of religious education. 
As a rule, departments of religious education do not yet exist 
in our churches. Instead, we have a heap of unrelated organiza- 
tions and activities—a Sunday school, a young people’s society, 
a junior society, clubs of boys and of girls, mission-study classes, 
week-day religious instruction, classes of catechumens, sermons 
to children, and, apart from them all, the isolated efforts of 
church members at religious education in the home. The re- 
sults are: 
(a) Overlapping and duplication, as in Bible study or study of 
missions. 
(b) Gaps, such as: Lack of social or other activities appropriate 
to a particular age, or to one sex at a particular age; lack of regular 
educational procedures for inducting the young into full member- 
ship in the church; lack of missionary training for one or another 
group; lack of connection between all these activities and the 
ordinary functions of laymen in the local society. At present the 
fact that one has been trained in a Sunday school rarely guarantees 
that he is fit for skilful churchmanship. 
(c) Indefiniteness of purpose, and consequently lack of stand- 
ards. Because the young people’s society doesn’t quite know 
what place belongs to it in an educational scheme, the upper age 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  232 THE CHURCH SCHOOL 
limit is often left undefined, so that men and women of almost 
any age are found among the ‘‘young”’ people. Moreover, many 
a young people’s society, instead of training its members in church- 
manship, has become a competitor of the church. Similarly, 
clubs of various sorts pursue their way, according to chance con- 
ditions or chance leadership, with little or no vital connection 
with the church or with any distinctly religious purpose. The 
Sunday school, in turn, not seldom assumes that it is efficient sim- 
ply because the school machinery hums. That is, it compares 
itself with itself instead of judging itself by the ascertained prog- 
ress of its pupils toward some defined goal. The lack of a defined 
goal subjects the school, further, to the whims of individuals. 
For the same reason there is much jumping at fads, or standing 
‘‘pat” on already discredited methods. 
(d) In a word, there is no guarantee that any person will re- 
ceive genuine, continuous pastoral care through his childhood 
and youth. 
The gaps and the overlappings in a local society, or in a 
denominational programme, can be graphically presented by 
making a table like that shown on the opposite page. 
The respective provisions for the two sexes may be made 
still more graphic by using black ink for one, and red ink for 
the other. The table here given is only a suggestion. In many 
churches additional items would have to be inserted, and in 
some cases a different division would be advisable. Thus, 
church doctrine might be separated from church usages, or 
usages and worship might be combined. If the conditions in 
any church were adequately presented in the present table, the 
following queries would arise: Why duplicate Bible instruc- 
tion for just these ages; in fact, why duplicate at all? Does 
instruction in church doctrine and usages begin early enough 
and continue long enough? Does mission study begin early 
enough, and why is there so much more for women than for 
men? Why does training in worship stop while the capacity 
for worship is little more than infantile? Why is there train- 
ing in giving for women and not for men, and why doesn’t this 
training run all the way through the Sunday school? Why do

men receive instruction and training in social righteousness 
while women do not, and why are the socially important years 
of early and middle adolescence left blank? In general, why 
is middle adolescence less richly provided for than other ages? 
Finally, is this church promoting and supervising home instruc- 
tion and training? 
A department of religious education, on the other hand, 
would provide all-round pastoral care for children. For, in 
contrast to the present jumble of agencies, and the hit-or-miss 
methods that are so common, it would have the following 
features: 
(a) It would include as pupils all the children and youth over 
whom the church has oversight. 
(b) It would include, and unify, everything done by the church 
with these pupils. Labor would be economized by omitting use- 
less activities and duplications, and by increased specialization 
within the activities that remain. Every class, club, or society 
that might be needed would then become a real organ of the cen- 
tral purpose. 
(c) Such a department would have for the whole a definite 
plan, out of which, in connection with accumulating experience, 
would grow definite standards and tests of the various organs and 
procedures. Of the nature of standards and tests more will be 
said presently. 
(d) Because of this definiteness of purpose, of functions, of 
standards, and of tests, specialized training would be provided 
for the workers, and they would be appointed, transferred, pro- 
moted, and relieved, on impersonal, educational grounds, not, as 
happens so often at present, for personal considerations, some- 
times even irrelevant ones.! 
(e) Such a unified whole would have unified supervision that 
reaches to every part and to every activity. Somebody must 
1The smart that so many Sunday school teachers and officers now feel 
when they cannot have their own way is due in large measure to the fact that 
irresponsibility has become a presumption of one’s office. When there is 
neither standard, nor test, nor supervision for my work, how can I help being 
hurt when anybody else assumes authority over me? The way out of this 
medley of arbitrary prerogatives, with the touchiness that results, is not 
increase of arbitrary power, or more decisive use of it, as by a superintendent,

know just what is happening, and must be competent and ready 
to assist any and every worker to do his best. 
Wherein supervision consists. The proposal to establish 
thorough supervision in religious education, and to appoint, 
transfer, promote, and relieve teachers and officers solely on 
the ground of efficiency will seem to many persons to involve 
extreme difficulty. For supervision is popularly supposed to 
imply one or more of these disagreeable things: Secret spy- 
ing upon my work; concocting plans with respect to me behind 
my back; subjecting myself to a boss who may not understand 
my problems, or difficulties, or limitations; encountering fault- 
finding, and possibly sarcasm, when I have done the best I 
know how. If such fears were well founded, supervision would 
be essentially anarchy—the anarchy that lurks in every autoc- 
racy. ‘Teachers are justified in being sensitive at this point; 
no foreign invasion of their work or of their personal dignity 
can be justified. But supervision, properly understood, is the 
exact opposite of the wrongs that are feared. Thus: 
(1) Swpernsion is sharing the burdens, and the blame, that 
might otherwise fall upon an isolated individual. One of the 
worst vices of the traditional Sunday school is that it isolates 
the worker with his work. How few teachers and officers 
can say: “There is one person who understands my problems 
and difficulties, is ever ready to help me with them, and if 
things go wrong will share with me the responsibility for the 
error’! As a matter of fact, the gibes to which Sunday school 
teachers have been subjected in recent years have been made 
possible, for the most part, by lack of supervision. If a pastor 
or a director of religious education were known to be impli- 
cated in the faults that seem worthy of castigation, he would 
but the exaltation of impersonal educational standards—standards sufficiently 
technical to do honor to those who attain them, without dishonoring those 
who do not. Besides, when a church as a whole takes religious education 
in a sufficiently serious way, the very largeness of the problem sobers those 
who realize what is happening. It is then possible to appeal to the deeper 
religious motives of the workers—motives that will make one glad to have 
the best possible work done, and even, out of loyalty, to acquiesce in decisions 
the wisdom of which one doubts.
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 THE CHURCH SCHOOL 
be the more shining mark for the darts of scorn, or at least his 
share in the chagrin would make the teacher’s share easier to 
bear. Simple fairness requires some stated provision whereby 
each worker may talk over his problems with some other person 
who will take the trouble to understand them and to assist in 
solving them. This conception of the matter puts upon the 
supervisor, on the other hand, an obligation to co-operate 
understandingly and sympathetically with each worker—to 
make him succeed if this is possible. The supervisor is not to 
be a slave-driver, or a mere task-setter, or a mere measurer and 
appraiser; he is not to be outside the work at all, but inside it; 
he is to be “touched with the feeling of our infirmities,” having 
been “in all points tempted like as we are.” 
(2) Supervision limits the arbitrariness of every worker, the 
supervisor himself included. Supervision does imply that I 
surrender my arbitrary will in every detail of my work, but that 
to which I surrender is not another arbitrary will, but the com- 
mon cause. Moreover, every other worker does the same, so 
that we meet one another upon a truly democratic basis. Every 
one is to take this humble position. 
Probably no workers receive less supervisory assistance than 
Sunday school superintendents, though in the nature of their 
work no one needs it more. Their duties are complicated, to 
begin with. Administration, conduct of worship, selection and 
supervision of teachers—all these fall to their lot. For lack of 
supervision the best powers of many a superintendent are 
never called into use. Lack of supervision means isolation. 
Having no one to go to with his problems, and no one to show 
him his faults or how to improve, he stumbles along, forms 
habits of stumbling, becomes set in his ways, and very likely 
arbitrary. There are many superintendents who think of 
themselves as specialists in Sunday school work, whereas they 
are merely mechanized. Again, the many superintendents who 
assume that they have a sort of prescriptive right to their office, 
those who are ready to make a row if they are deposed, most 
of the martinets and the autocrats, are victims of the injustice 
that is inherent in every unsupervised school. ‘They have been 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
    THE CHURCH SCHOOL 237 
made what they are by the situation in which the votes of others 
have placed them. Gradually, gently, irresponsible superin- 
tendents must be made over into responsible cnes, or else dis- 
placed. The same principle applies to the pastor and the 
director of religious education. 
The fundamental idea in supervision is intimate sharing in 
burden-bearing. ‘This implies that the group of workers is of 
the deliberative sort. Every one has a right to be heard. 
Every one has the duty of making available the facts that only 
he knows; every one’s experience contains some illumination; 
every one must form judgments of his own as a part of his con- 
tribution to the common enterprise, and these judgments must 
concern, in some measure, the acts of the supervisor himself. 
He will make a serious blunder if he assumes to be a self- 
sufficient fountain of either wisdom or executive power. For 
he will almost certainly discredit himself by his obvious falli- 
bility, and even if, by personal attractiveness or by sheer energy, 
he gets himself accepted at his own valuation, the result will be 
a mechanized school which, lacking the unity and the self- 
perpetuating capacity of a living organism, will fall to pieces 
when his hand is withdrawn. The way of the wise supervisor 
is that of humble seeking for light; it is that of openness of pur- 
pose, and great frankness with every worker; it is that of spread- 
ing his own policies and acts before the staff of workers so that 
they may not only be instructed but also become his instructors. 
(3) Supervision implies that there is a definite organ for main- 
taining the unity of the school. The present isolation of the 
worker not only increases his own burdens, it adds to the 
burdens of others also. Take as an example the problem of 
cultivating reverence in pupils. The conduct of a pupil in the 
common worship of the school often depends upon the attitude 
and the habits of his teacher. The thoughtless influence of 
many a tardy, inattentive, disorderly teacher pulls against the 
superintendent’s efforts to lead the children into a worshipful 
frame of mind. On the other hand, cases are not lacking in 
which a superintendent’s slam-bang ways in the assembly of 
the school beget irreverence that the teacher cannot over- 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  238 THE CHURCH SCHOOL 
come. Consider, likewise, the burdens that teachers must 
bear because of poor work done in lower grades. The fact is 
that the parts of a school are interdependent, whether we plan 
to have them so or not. But interdependence is not the same 
as unity. Nor is unity achieved even by having a common 
purpose in al! the parts unless the community of the purpose be 
specifically represented in some official who acts upon every 
part from the standpoint of wholeness. The supervisor is, in 
fact, the organ whereby the school assures itself of a system of 
religious education. 
(4) Supervision develops standards of educational efficiency 
for every office. The very fact that a school has a supervisor 
should mean emphasis upon results, or efficiency, as distinguished 
from going through certain movements. For example, the office 
of secretary will involve not only filling in certain blank spaces 
in record books, but also such use of the records as helps to 
educate the pupils. The secretary will be, in his own way, an 
educator. A long vista of attractive possibilities opens up for 
this ordinarily prosaic offiice—a vista of analyses that shall 
show the strong and the weak points in the school; reports that 
shall stimulate pupils, teachers, parents, and the church board; 
exhibits that shall be a tonic for everybody. Similarly, the 
office of the teacher in each grade will consist primarily in pro- 
ducing certain ascertainable results in pupils—not in saying 
certain things, not in “going over” certain pages in a text- 
book. So it will be through the whole school. The superin- 
tendent, as well as his colleagues, will be answerable for pro- 
ducing definable educational effects in pupils. Not “What have 
you done?” but “What have you got done?” will be the 
primary question for each. 
When each office comes to be defined thus by its educational 
function, then and then only the person who holds the office 
is put into true perspective. We have then the antidote for 
the substitution of personal attractiveness for skill; we have 
the corrective for both faddishness and traditionalism; and we 
undermine every claim to hold an office as a personal perquisite. 
Here is the beginning of the cure for discontinuity of work 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
THE CHURCH SCHOOL 239 
through changes of personnel. As long as the present fogginess 
of standards prevails, we must expect that, as workers come and 
go, there will be interruptions and disruptions of function. But 
clearly understood standards, administered by a recognized 
supervisor, will tend to stabilize the whole school, and to pro- 
duce continuity of life at every point. 
(5) Supervision develops tests of efficiency. A standard is 
some point that we set out to reach within a given time; a test 
is any fact by which we can judge whether we have moved 
toward this point, and how far we have moved. If the standard 
is that every teacher should be on time every Sunday of the 
year, the test is the facts of attendance counted one by one 
each Sunday. If a standard for the fourth grade is that each 
pupil should by the end of the year know the Bible stories up 
to the David cycle, then the test is some piece or pieces of work 
done by each pupil in which he uses these stories.1_ If a standard 
of the secondary department is that every pupil, as far as pos- 
sible, should be brought into full or confirmed membership 
in the church by the age of sixteen, then the test will include, in 
addition to counting those who are and those who are not in 
this relation to the church by the age of sixteen, such a study 
of each remaining outsider as will reveal why he remains out- 
side. Only so can we judge whether the obstacle was or was 
not removable by our efforts. 
The distinction between standards and tests is important. 
For high standards do not of themselves prove much as to the 
effectiveness of the work that is actually done. Many a worker, 
in fact, deceives himself by measuring the quality of his work by 
the motives with which it is done, or by the hopes that are en- 
tertained for it. There is no end to the possibilities of bungling 
on the part of those who mean well. Generally the standard 
itself is somewhat hazy until tests are devised, so that standards 
1 This is not the same as saying that an examination is necessary, at least 
if ‘‘examination’’ is used in the ordinary sense. The formalistic examina- 
tion that still lingers in day schools and colleges bears witness, not to thorough- 
ness of teaching in these institutions, but to a low level of teaching methods. 
Here and there a Sunday school needs to be warned against adopting in 
religious teaching the defective methods that progressive educators are sirug- 
gling to put an end to in other schools, 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
240 THE CHURCH SCHOOL 
and tests, though they are distinct, are practically reciprocal. 
The tabular view on the oppsite page will suggest the rela- 
tions here involved, and also some general notions of the sorts 
of standard and of test that will be found appropriate in a 
church department of education. 
Most of the theory that underlies this table has already been 
stated. The proposal to utilize in administration all the avail- 
able powers of pupils may, however, need a word of explana- 
tion. Let us recall, then, two features of the outlook that we 
have already reached. The first is that the basal process in 
the teaching of religion is social experience on the Christian 
plane, or common purposeful life on the part of teacher and 
pupil. The second is that we are to educate for democracy. 
These two principles taken together imply that the ideal school 
is not the one in which there is an impervious governing class 
placed over the class of the governed, but the one in which 
there is no plane of separation at all between the governors and 
the governed. That is, though diversity of function must 
exist, so that one person uses his judgment in one sphere, an- 
other in another, children themselves at all ages have real func- 
tions in school management. Alternatives are constantly to 
be provided, and the choice of pupils between such alternatives 
is to be final. 
By the time pupils reach the secondary school age they are 
experienced enough to form a student council made up of 
representatives from their various classes. Such a council, as 
experience has already shown, may well consider, and in many 
cases settle, serious problems. When such a body is not a 
make-believe one, devised by adults simply for getting pupils 
to accept what has already been decided, but a body that is 
seriously consulted and really used for improving policies and 
methods, the members of it show surprising capacity—surprising 
to any one brought up under a contrary type of education— 
for appreciating the purposes of the school and for contributing 
a valuable element to the administration of it.

tion, or church school, as though it comprised only the activi- 
ties that have their centre in the church building. But a 
broader conception is possible and necessary. All members of 
the church who have growing children should be accounted 
members of the staff of instructors, accounted so not merely in 
sentiment, but also administratively. Upon the birth of the 
first child the parents’ names should be recorded as teachers, 
just as the child’s name should be recorded as a pupil in the 
Cradle Roll or Font Roll department. And not until all their 
living children have graduated from the church school should 
the names of such parents be dropped from the roll of teachers. 
In the meantime they should be given continuous supervision; 
they should make annual reports just as other teachers and all 
officers should do; and training classes and departmental staff 
meetings should be provided.! 
The evils of isolation are nowhere more in evidence than in 
the semichaotic condition of religious education in church 
families. Here are multitudes of parents who would like to 
know how to rear their children to be Christians, but no one 
tells them how. ‘The chief trouble is not that knowledge on this 
point is limited (as it certainly is), but that there is no organized 
method of spreading the knowledge that is available. And 
one reason why our knowledge on this point is so limited is that 
there is no organized method of observing and recording the 
experience of families. Beginnings of the right kind have been 
made in the distribution of material by the superintendents of 
1In my own thinking, what is here suggested has its place in a compre- 
hensive conception of a working church. The notion of a church as a con- 
gregation to be talked to, or as a fellowship in anything that does not include 
co-operative labor, does not of itself go far enough. What does it mean to 
the people themselves that they are members of churches? Doubtless it 
means refraining from certain sorts of wrong conduct, going to church, and 
leading a life of prayer. It ought to mean, in addition, a specific, defined, and 
supervised sphere of labor for the promotion of the democracy of God. Is it 
too much to hope that the time will yet come when every member will be 
recorded in the books of the church as a worker in a certain department; 
when each of these departments will have plans and policies that bear speci- 
fically, not in any merely generic and hazy way, upon actual conditions that 
confront its members; when businesslike supervision will be provided for 
every worker; when every worker will render regular reports of his activities, 
and when progress or decline in his department will be annually ascertained 
and recorded? This, I conceive, fairly represents what the church is here for.

THE CHURCH SCHOOL 243 
Cradle Roll and Font Roll departments, and in the holding 
of parents’ meetings and parents’ classes in various Sunday 
schools. But these are only a drop in the bucket; they are 
only a mild palliation of an enormous waste. 
The problem of getting time enough for effective religious 
education. When present inefficiencies are pointed out, few 
remarks are more common than this: “ Well, how much can you 
expect from a half-hour’s instruction once a week? We must 
have more time.” Thereupon there is casting about for either 
some method of getting religious instruction into the public 
schools, or for establishing week-day religious instruction by the 
churches themselves. The problem is a real and pressing one, 
and it is not less serious than it seems to be; yet the time- 
situation as a whole has never yet, I believe, been correctly 
analyzed in print. Reserving for a subsequent chapter the 
relations of state education to religion, let me describe in blunt 
fashion the present situation within the churches. 
(1) The churches are wasting a large proportion of the precious 
half-hour for religious instruction on Sunday. They are wasting 
it by curtailing it for trivial causes, such as speeches by strangers, 
@ superintendent’s dawdling, the intervention of unimportant 
“special occasions’’; by interruptions, as by the secretary; by 
unnecessary distractions; and by failure to supervise the teacher 
or to train him so as to get the best possible work from him. 
(2) It is not true that only a half-hour is available for religious 
anstruction on Sunday. In most Sunday schools the period 
for class instruction could be lengthened fifteen minutes by 
adding to it the time that is now wasted or ill used. The school 
begins late, protracts the opening exercises without reason, 
makes clumsy transitions because system and team-work are 
weak, and takes the time of the general session for various 
things that could be attended to at least as well otherwise. 
To test the applicability of this analysis to your school, take 
your watch in hand for a few Sundays, and write down the 
number of minutes spent upon each procedure, being sure to 
include any items like those mentioned in the preceding sen- 
tence; then write out your judgment as to the time needed, 
   
-P-A-G-E-256
  244 THE CHURCH SCHOOL 
on educational grounds, for each of these procedures. Was 
the prayer too long, or not long enough? Did the super- 
intendent do any unnecessary talking? Etc., etc. 
(3) Every minute of the Sunday school, not merely the class 
period, should be made educationally effective. Why talk as if 
church education were shut up to a bare half-hour, when per- 
haps thrice this time is already available? Our greatest weak- 
ness is not lack of time, after all, but lack of effectiveness in the 
use of what we have. 
(4) It has not been demonstrated that a longer Sunday session 
is umpracticable. We need experiments with, say, a two-hour 
session, which shall include, besides a period for worship and 
one for recitation, a period for study (under supervision), and 
a period for planning and administering enterprises of social 
helpfulness. 
(5) When week-day instruction is entered upon, as it must 
probably be sooner or later, it should be an organic part of a general 
plan for the church school, and there should be unified administra- 
tion. ‘That is to say, the time problem is not an isolated one. 
The question whether we ought to have more time is bound 
up with the question of what we would do with it if we had it. 
Agitation for week-day instruction has only too often proceeded 
as if, granted the time, we would be ready to go ahead, whereas 
such matters as the content and method of instruction and the 
relation thereof to the Sunday instruction, and the whole prob- 
lem of administration have hardly begun to be considered. 
Nor has the problem of securing competent teachers for week- 
day classes even approached a solution as yet.!. I would not 
imply that these problems must all be worked out in advance of 
experiment, but only that any experiment that is made should 
proceed from a competent grasp of educational principles. We 
should hesitate, we should refuse, to establish another isolated, 
falsely self-sufficient agency. 
(6) The problem of securing a sufficient proportion of the pupil’s 
1I have presented concrete instances of these problems in ‘‘A General 
View of the Movement for Correlating Religious Education with Public In- 
struction.'’"—Religious Education XI (1916), 109-122. 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
THE CHURCH SCHOOL 245 
time is bound up with that of securing a sufficient proportion of the 
teacher’s time, and this problem is bound up, wn turn, with the in- 
justices of our economic order. We should not put ourselves in 
the position of asking for additional time in which to do poor 
teaching; but when we ask for more of the teacher’s time in 
order that he may fit himself for more skilful work, we confront, 
in a great proportion of cases, the grim fact of economic pressure 
so great as to leave insufficient time and energy for the necessary 
study. A large part of the work of religious education is being 
done at the present moment with only the fag ends of human 
energy. All honor to the housekeepers, the factory operatives, 
the stenographers, the salespeople, and the bookkeepers who are 
giving a considerable proportion of their free time to uncom- 
pensated and often unhonored labor in the Sunday school. 
Many of them are bravely, but with great handicaps, struggling 
to secure adequate training for their work. The spectacle is 
more noble than it is pathetic. But most of all it is a challenge 
to the church to realize how her very life is being drained by 
the economic order against which she has only feebly protested. 
The long working day, and the high-pressure methods that now 
prevail are not necessary to feed, clothe, house, and educate 
all the people, nor are the products of the people’s industry 
distributed upon any such principle. Let us face the fact that 
the great problem of time in religious education is identical 
with the problem of the consumption of the time of the many 
in heaping up possessions for the few. 
The financial support of the church school. That the 
church school should be supported by the church should be 
rather obvious from the principles that have been stated. 
There are two great objections to the common practice of pay- 
ing the expenses of the school by collections of money from its 
pupils: First, the pupils’ contributions can be made far more 
educative by a different plan, and, second, when the school pays 
its own expenses the church lacks an important reminder of its 
function as religious educator, and is practically invited to let 
the school go its own way. Let us consider these two points 
in reverse order. 
   
-P-A-G-E-258
246 THE CHURCH SCHOOL 
Having the school regularly in the church budget is more 
than a matter of paying bills. It is an outward and visible 
sign of the church’s inward and spiritual comprehension of its 
central task. Something is gained when the school merely 
appears along with the minister, the janitor, the choir, the coal 
man, and the insurance agent. But the relative amounts 
appropriated for these various items reveal something of im- 
portance. Here is a church with a budget of twenty thousand 
dollars for local expenditures that appropriates for its Sunday 
school the same amount that it pays to one janitor, namely, 
seven hundred and fifty dollars. This is one-fifth of the amount 
appropriated for church music. A budget like this is a veritable 
window into the local ecclesiastical mind. Well-to-do churches 
are buying for their Sunday schools printed matter that is 
educationally as well as commercially cheap. There are 
wealthy churches that “cannot afford” to employ a director 
of religious education, and when the payment of teachers is 
suggested ask: “ Will not paying the teacher interfere with the 
spirituality of his work?” We need, then, for the sake of the 
church as a whole to keep the Sunday school in the church 
budget, and to keep on increasing the appropriation until the 
church wakes up to the greatness of its task. 
On the other hand, the pupils in the school need to be trained 
in giving. Ordinarily, it appears, the “authorities of the 
school”’ decide where the pupils’ money shall go, and then 
approach the pupils with little more than “Give, give!” One 
child is reported to have been under the delusion that he was 
giving to his teacher! Real training in giving requires: (a) 
Intelligence as to the object for which money is solicited. 
(6) Comparison of one object with another so as to judge how 
money should be apportioned between them. (c) Free choice 
11t is to be assumed, of course, that a part of the salary of both pastor and 
janitor, and a part of the expenditure usually listed under lighting, heating, 
insurance, repairs, etc., are devoted to religious education. But even when 
these are added to the item for the Sunday school the total bears no fitting 
relation to the fundamental place and the proper cost of religious education. 
It would be well for every church to make a budget that would show for whom 
(children or adults) all moneys are appropriated.

between alternatives. (d) The development of co-operation 
in judging causes and in supporting them. (e) Continuity, 
the habit of giving, sustained loyalty to a cause. (f) A report 
to the giver as to what has been done with his contributions, 
and what they have accomplished. 
The pupils in the church school should be led, in accordance 
with these principles, to support the local church, to give to 
missions and other church enterprises, and to support philan- 
thropies. To exploit a school in the interest of a financial 
need, to “work” it as a source of increased revenues, to play 
upon children’s untrained sympathies and impulses—this is 
degradation. Every financial transaction in which a _ pupil 
takes part should be educative to him. If we seek first this 
educational righteousness, we need have no fears that the 
contributions of the pupils will be niggardly, but if we do not 
train them thus to intelligent, discriminating, systematic giv- 
ing, we need not be surprised if they make crotchety and un- 
generous givers in maturity.! 
1 These principles may be worked out by various methods. The dupli- 
cate envelope system offers a great advance over traditional ways, but much 
more than the envelope is needed. I look forward to a time when every 
church will report all its receipts and expenditures to the pupils in the Sunday 
school, and when the great church societies also will give an account of their 
stewardship to the learners. In the Union School of Religion each class has 
its own treasury, out of which it votes its contributions after studying various 
causes. These contributions fall into two classes, those made to causes that 
the school as a whole is helping to support, such as a missionary enterprise 
and a local philanthropy, and those which the class itself, with the help (but 
never the dictation) of the teacher, chooses as its particular sphere of help- 
fulness. When a class gives a contribution to one of the general causes, 
the class treasurer pays over the amount to the school treasurer.

CHAPTER XVII 
EDUCATIONAL RELATIONS BETWEEN STATE 
AND CHURCH 
The social significance of the modern secular state. 
The term “secular state” is here used as the most convenient 
designation for a political society in which organized religion 
as well as individual religious attitude is an altogether vol- 
untary matter. This implies, of course, that the financial 
support of organized religion is voluntary, not a matter of 
taxation, which is a form of legal compulsion. 
The tendency of modern states to become secular is unmis- 
takable. First, the civil power, refusing to accept dictation 
from the ecclesiastical power, holds itself to be co-ordinate 
therewith. Next, the state takes over ecclesiastical functions 
of many kinds, such as charities and education. Disestablish- 
ment follows, and finally even patronage is withdrawn. Only 
“free churches” then remain—free in the same sense as a 
literary society or a golf-club. 
This growing separation of church from state is a phase of 
the growth of popular government. The necessity that such 
government should have an intelligent electorate has caused it to 
assume the duty of educating all the people. Here, more than 
anywhere else, we shall find the nerve of the secular state. 
Here civil society procreates itself, so to say, in the thought and 
the conscience of children. Just here is where the separation of 
the churches from the taxing power is most difficult in both 
theory and practice. Long after disestablishment occurs, the 
two powers remain entangled in the matter of education. 
If we desire a disentanglement that shall be in the interest 
of a socially adequate education, we must look at the state 
school itself (which we of the United States commonly call the 
248 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
STATE AND CHURCH 249 
“public” school) as an expression of certain great social aspira- 
tions. We must realize, to begin with, that the secularization of 
the state, and therefore of state schools, has been necessitated 
chiefly by the social inadequacy of ecclesiastical traditions and 
practices. The state, not the church, has been the decisive 
defender and guarantor of fundamental liberties, such as the 
right to think, to speak, to associate with one’s fellows, and 
to Stand before courts of law as the equal of any citizen. The 
conception of indefeasible rights, which no authority, whether 
it speaks in the name of man or of God, may abridge—this 
conception may almost be said to have given birth to the modern 
state. 
The free state, moreover, rather than any church, has been 
the chief practical realization of the unity and the solidarity 
of men. The Jews, for example, becoming free citizens, find 
in the state a human recognition that the dominant religion of 
the western world had never, in any of its main branches, 
accorded to them. The great mixer of races in this country 
has been the civic rather than the ecclesiastical community, 
and: before all else the public school. 
Without doubt what is humane and democratic inthe 
modern state owes a large part of its inspiration-to—religion. 
Within Christianity from the days of Jesus there has been 
the leaven of democracy. ‘Though this leaven has been for the 
most part, to use Jesus’ own word, “hidden,” there has ap- 
peared from time to time evidence that the germ is not dead. 
Not only have individuals here and there seen and declared the 
incompatibility of the spirit of Jesus with all oppression, ex- 
ploitation, and denial of equality of opportunity, but minor 
groups of many sorts have endeavored to live the brotherhood 
that they professed, and some phases of liberty have been 
espoused by whole denominations. On the other hand, many 
a prophet of the rights of men has been an “infidel,” and cer- 
tainly the secular state has actually brought men together as 
no religious organization has done. 
One might maintain, with considerable show of reason, that 
the socially integrative power of religion has passed to the state, 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
250 STATE AND CHURCH 
even the secular state. During the rise of popular government, 
the populace has been divided on religious grounds, divided 
not only as respects the great historic religions of the world— 
Christianity, Judaism, etc.—but divided also into apparently 
irreconcilable parties within the dominant religion. Indeed, 
so bitter has been religious partisanship at times that the civil 
power has had to step in to preserve the peace. Religion has 
had to be protected from religion by the secular arm. On the 
other hand, the secular power has had to guard against allow- 
ing its prerogatives or its funds to come under the control of 
one or another religious party. 
In short, then, the secular state, particularly in its schools, 
is our highest social achievement in these two respects: (1) 
The securing of freedom and equal rights for individuals, and 
(2) The organization of authority upon the basis of manhood 
rather than upon the basis of hereditary or other class privilege. 
That we are still at the beginnings in both these matters is 
clear enough. Even fundamental rights are not too secure as 
yet, and the spirit of democracy is still engaged in the struggle 
against privilege. But we have definitely entered upon the 
struggle, and we have entered upon it specifically as members of 
the secular state. 
Why the public schools in the United States are increas- 
ingly secular. In the District of Columbia, the territories, 
the Indian reservations, and the insular possessions, public 
education comes under the provision of the Federal Constitu- 
tion that forbids the Congress to make any law concerning an 
establishment of religion. The full force of this prohibition was 
not at first recognized, for government funds were appropriated 
for the support of Indian schools under the control of religious 
bodies, some Catholic, some Protestant. From this patronage 
of churches, however, the government has already partly with- 
drawn, and complete withdrawal is in sight. 
In the States of the Union public education is under State 
control, and is therefore not subject to the federal prohibition 
of an established church. Some of the oldest States had ai: 
the outset of their history what amounted practically to a State 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
           251 
  STATE AND CHURCH 
church. But they have moved away from such entanglements, 
and the younger States have commonly begun their career with 
constitutional bars against them. At the present time the. 
separation of the state from the church is axiomatic through- 
out the Union. 
But the application of the axiom to the public schools has 
not been easy or uniform. The constitutions, the statutes, the 
court decisions, and the administrative precedents of the differ- 
ent States differ greatly from one another. Nevertheless, a 
general trend, an unambiguous one, is discernible: The States 
participate less and less in anything that is specifically recog- 
nized by the people as religion. 
Before we ask for the reasons of this trend, let us glance at a 
single specimen of the change in question. The Ordinance for 
the Government of the Northwest Territory, promulgated in 
1787, that is, the territory northwest of the Ohio River, con- 
tains this clause y Religion, morality, and knowledge being 
necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, 
schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.” 
Here, it is clear, the state has the distinct intention of teachin 
religion, or of seeing that it is taught. But the constitutions 
of the States that were carved out of this territory show a pro- 
gressive modification of this intention until, in some instances, 
no trace of it is left. 
The first modification is in the constitution of Ohio, which 
was adopted in 1802: “Religion, morality, and knowledge be- 
ing essentially necessary to the good government and happiness 
of mankind, schools and the means of instruction shall forever 
be encouraged by legislative provision, not inconsistent with the 
rights of conscience.” In 1851 the statement is changed still 
further: “Religion, morality, and knowledge being essential 
to good government, it shall be the duty of the general assem- 
bly to pass suitable laws to protect every religious denomination 
in the peaceable enjoyment of its own mode of public worship, 
and to encourage schools and the means of instruction.”” Thus, 
first the rights of conscience are brought in as a limitation; 
then the ground of the provision is narrowed to the needs of
-P-A-G-E-264
252 STATE AND CHURCH 
good government, no reference being made to any other value 
in religion; finally, the duty imposed changes from encouraging 
schools in which religion shall be promoted to protecting re- 
ligious denominations in their own modes of worship. 
Indiana puts into her constitution in 1816 only this shred 
of the original statement in the Ordinance of 1787, “ Knowl- 
edge and learning generally diffused through a community be- 
ing essential to the preservation of a free government,” fol- 
lowed by regulations respecting school lands. In 1851 the 
statement is changed to read as follows: “Knowledge and 
learning generally diffused throughout a community being 
essential to the preservation of a free government, it shall be 
the duty of the general assembly to encourage, by all suitable 
means, moral, intellectual, scientific, and agricultural improve- 
ment.” Michigan in 1850 makes the list still briefer: “The 
legislature shall encourage the promotion of intellectual, scien- 
tific, and agricultural improvement.”’ The various constitu- 
tions of Illinois have no trace of the original declaration of 1787. 
The Minnesota constitution, 1857, declares: “The stability 
of a republican form of government depending mainly upon 
the intelligence of the people, it shall be the duty of the legis- 
lature to establish a general and uniform system of public 
schools.”” Here at last not even morality is mentioned, and 
intelligence is declared to be the main support of republican in- 
stitutions. 
Though these items cover only one phase of the movement 
in a limited part of the country, the impression that they con- 
vey of a change toward secularism correctly represents a general 
shift in most of the States of the North and West. What is the 
explanation? Not any general decline of religion during this 
period, but the clash of competing religious bodies between 
which the States determined to be neutral. If the teaching of 
religion in the public schools produces a wrangling community 
or school district, the State follows the clear dictate of practical 
wisdom when it removes the divisive object out of the schools. 
The whole experiment in popular government would be im- 
perilled if the schools should become class schools. They must 
be, at all cost, schools of the whole people. 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
STATE AND CHURCH 253 
_. cuuvenient example of the practical logic that has just 
been referred to is the contest between Catholics and Protes- 
tants over public school funds in the State of New York in the 
forties. In the law of 1813, which established a system of pub- 
lic instruction, there was a clause that provided for distributing 
the funds for the City of New York among benevolent, religious, 
and educational associations that maintained charity schools. 
As a result, some eight or ten religious societies received sub- 
sidies. In 1824 the legislature gave to the common council 
of the city authority to designate the societies that should 
thus share in the public funds. The scheme produced con- 
stant friction, particularly because the Catholics felt that 
they did not secure their proper share. A chief Protestant 
beneficiary was the “Public School Society,” which maintained 
what amounted to a chain of public schools without public 
supervision. The Catholics desired to be put substantially 
upon a parity with this society. A petition addressed to the 
common council failed after a long debate. An attempt to 
secure relief through the legislature likewise failed. At last 
the question was carried to the electorate itself. The result 
was a law that no school shall receive any portion of school 
moneys in which the religious doctrines or tenets of any Chris- 
tian or other religious sect shall be taught, inculcated, or prac- 
tised.? 
Another specimen of friction and of the way of removing it 
comes from within the original Northwest Territory. As early 
as 1842 Cincinnati was agitated by complaints that text-books 
used in the schools contained passages that were obnoxious to 
Catholics, and that Catholic children were required to read 
passages from the Protestant Bible. This agitation kept up 
for twenty-seven years, when Catholic members of the board of 
education, aided by certain liberals called “freethinkers,” 
passed a resolution that prohibited the reading of the Bible 
in the schools. Some citizens applied to the superior court 
for a permanent injunction to prevent the enforcement of this 
regulation. The court, by a divided vote, granted the petition, 
1 For the history of this most interesting case see the classified Bibliography, 
Division G, first and third paragraphs. 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
    254 STATE AND CHURCH 
but an appeal was had to the supreme court, which reversed the 
decision and upheld the right of the board of education to make 
the regulation in question. 
This right had been attacked on the ground of the Ohio con- 
stitutional provision of 1851, which has already been quoted: 
“Religion, morality, and knowledge being essential to good 
government.” This, argued the petitioners, not only requires 
religious instruction in the public schools, but specifically 
Christian instruction based upon the Bible. This was inferred 
from the historic connection of this clause in the Ohio constitu- 
tion with the Ordinance of 1787. The framers of this Ordi- 
nance, it was said, could have had in mind none but the Chris- 
tian religion. Opposing counsel pointed out that the Christian 
religion as thus understood is the Protestant religion, which is 
essentially sectarian, and that the use of the Bible contemplated 
by the petitioners is a distinctly Protestant use. Consequently, 
it was argued, the petitioners practically maintain that Ohio has 
a state religion. Therefore counsel for the board of education 
labored to show that the State of Ohio, like the United States, 
has no religion, Protestant or Catholic, Christian or other. 
In the superior court, two of the three judges assented, each 
in his own way, to the proposition that the State of Ohio has 
a religion. “We are led to the conclusion,” says one of them, 
“that revealed religion, as it is made known in the Holy Scrip- 
tures, is that alone that is recognized by our constitution.” 
The dissenting judge, however, declares that the only way in 
which neutrality between the sects can be maintained in the 
schools is by excluding religious instruction altogether. “To 
hold that Protestants have a right to have their mode of worship 
and their Bible used in the common schools, against the will of 
the board of education . . . is to hold to the union of church 
and state, however we may repudiate and reproach the name.” 
The opinion of the supreme court coincides with that of the 
minority member of the superior court. It denies that the 
Christian religion is a part of the law; it denies altogether 
that the state hasareligion. It is true, runs the reasoning, that 
religion is necessary to good government, as the constitution 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
STATE AND CHURCH 255 
says, and the state must have the best religion, but the best 
religion is to be had, as the constitution indicates, by keeping 
hands off—by protecting all forms of religion, so that, through 
their own interactions and conflicts, the best may come to light.' 
The difficulty of maintaining in law the distinction be- 
tween religion and sectarian religion. There is a large 
mass of opinion among religionists and educators to the effect 
that since church and religion are not the same, the separation 
of the state from the church does not imply that the state or 
its schools must be non-religious. The warring sects hold much 
in common; why should it not be taught in the schools? 
Some court decisions support this conclusion. For example, in 
the celebrated Edgerton case, the supreme court of Wisconsin 
held that the use of any version of the Bible as a text-book in 
the public schools is sectarian instruction, yet one of the judges 
took pains to say that the decision of the court does not hinder 
the use of passages of the Bible for the purpose of moral in- 
struction, or even for inculcating the broad principles of re- 
ligion that are common to all the sects.? 
As a matter of pure theory the distinction between religion 
and sectarianism can doubtless maintain itself. In the ad- 
ministration of schools, however, there are factors other than 
those contemplated by the theory. These additional factors are: 
(1) The teacher, who is almost certain to have received his 
religious training from a sect. No teacher, it may be said, 
can teach with conviction what is common to the sects with- 
out more or less leaning toward or away from something in 
some of the sects. By the position of an emphasis, or by silence 
with regard to some point, if not by positive assertion, a particu- 
lar tint is sure to be given to the instruction. As a matter of 
fact, is there, or can there be in real life any such thing as a 
colorless religion? Is not the notion an abstraction? Actual

religion, the sort that one feels and acts out, is always a product 
of particular historical conditions, and it always involves par- 
ticular social relations over which conflict is likely, even certain, 
to occur. How, for example, can any actual religiousness be 
entirely indifferent to priests? How can one steer a middle 
course between reverence for them and hostility toward them ? 
If one assumes an attitude of simple non-recognition, is not 
this itself hostility ? 
(2) The parents and the board of education that represents 
them. We must reckon with the possibility of religious sensi- 
tiveness on the part of persons who have not studied the phi- 
losophy of religion, and are not trained to see or feel the religious 
affinities between sects. The control of the schools rests ul- 
timately in plain citizens like these. One group of them easily 
becomes distrustful toward religious teaching by a teacher who 
belongs to a competing group. Moreover, the most strictly 
non-partisan teaching that can be achieved is likely to be un- 
satisfactory by reason of what it omits. 
(3) The ecclesiastical organizations. Most of them main- 
tain a ministry that is jealous for the doctrines of its particular 
church, and likewise apprehensive of encroachments from some 
other church. Moreover, several churches claim to be the 
church. The direct consequence of the claim to exclusive 
authority as teacher of religion is this: Insistence that any 
religious teaching that is given in the public schools be super- 
vised by the authority-possessing church, the only alternative 
being the exclusion of all such teaching. Many Protestants, 
accustomed to think of the content of a doctrine without special 
regard to the problem of doctrinal authority, fancy that the 
public schools might teach in peace the doctrines that are held 
in common by Catholic and Protestant. But this would be 
Protestant teaching! It would be so because it would assume 
the Protestant position of liberty in teaching and in learning. 
Catholics will not aecept any such plan. From their point of 
view any religious teaching whatever that is done without 
Catholic authorization contains an implied denial of the Catholic 
doctrine of authority. 
     
-P-A-G-E-269
  STATE AND CHURCH 257 
tt is conceivable that Protestantism, because of its tendency 
toward religious liberty, that is to say, toward appreciation of 
common humanity as against all sectarianism, might, if left to 
itself, unite upon some plan for teaching religion in the public 
schools. But under existing conditions the law has to regard 
Protestantism in its totality as a sect over against Catholicism 
as another sect. If it seems anomalous, even absurd, that a 
state that is built upon liberty and equality should forbid itself 
to teach religious liberty, we should remind ourselves that our 
loyalties are manifold, that they are not matters of logic merely, 
and that they win many of their greatest victories not by might 
nor by power, but by spirit. 
Catholic dissatisfaction with the public school system. 
The doctrine of infallibility, as formulated by the Vatican Coun- 
cil, declares that the Pope, when he speaks with authority, is 
infallible in all matters of faith and morals. The Catholic 
Church as teacher, accordingly, claims exclusive prerogative in 
everything that is included under the category of character- 
formation. In strictness, then, the state has no right to teach 
morals. But can the teaching of morals, or can character- 
formation be separated from the ordinary instruction of an 
elementary curriculum? The Catholic answer is that the 
young pupil, knowing that his schooling is intended to prepare 
him for life, gets from his school experience an impression of 
what is important in life. If the school is silent upon the great 
issues of religion and morals, this silence itself tends to give 
religion and morals a secondary place in the child’s outlook. 
Therefore the Catholic contention is that religion and morals. 
must be taught in continuous connection with the usual common 
school branches. 
Two things follow: First, the parish school, and second, dis-. 
satisfaction toward the public schools. This dissatisfaction 
manifests itself in various ways. In repeated instances the read-. 
ing of the Bible in the schools has been complained of on the: 
ground of its sectarianism. In some cases, after the use of the 
Bible has been discontinued, the schools have been condemned as: 
“godless.” But the most common complaint is that Catholics
-P-A-G-E-270
258 STATE AND CHURCH 
are obliged to pay taxes for the support of schools to which they 
cannot conscientiously send their children. Hence the oft- 
renewed agitation for a division of the school funds whereby 
parish schools shall be compensated for teaching the common 
school branches. 
Premising as before that something more than logic is in- 
volved in the adjustment of our differences (as witness the 
very great extent to which Catholics find it possible to use 
the public schools, after all), we may well notice that, in strict 
logic, there is a profound contrast, which amounts to opposition, 
between the theory of education that prevails among Catholic 
thinkers and that which underlies education in the modern 
secular state. The theory of the modern state is that it has a 
right to educate the children as a necessity for its own safety 
and progress, and as a means of promoting the common wel- 
fare. Hence compulsory education laws. On the Catholic 
side, when the right to educate is in question, the emphasis is 
upon the parent rather than the state. Inasmuch, however, as 
the parent is required to obey the church, the Catholic theory 
may fairly be said to be this: That the church alone has a right 
to control the culture of mind and of character. That is, from 
the standpoint of theory alone, accommodations and adjust- 
ments in actual practice being ignored, Catholicism has not yet 
assimilated the educational philosophy of the modern state. 
The demand for division of public school funds with parish 
schools. The argument for partial support of parish schools 
by taxation runs to the effect that these schools, while accom- 
plishing their religious purpose, fulfil also the ends of the state 
by teaching such subjects as reading, writing, arithmetic, etc., 
and that the state may properly pay the parochial school for 
teaching these subjects, especially as Catholic taxpayers are de- 
barred by conscientious scruples from using the public schools. 
If the problem could be reduced in reality to such simple 
terms as buying a certain amount of knowledge of this or that, 
it would be easy enough; the state would simply examine in 
certain subjects, and pay a stipulated amount for every pupil 
who reaches a prescribed grade. But the educational purpose 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  STATE AND CHURCH 259 
of the state is not as meagre as this. The state desires to ex- 
press itself to its children. A democracy must transcend class 
consciousness, must support and develop the sense of human 
equality, must train the different elements of the population to 
co-operation by early habituation of children, and by early 
awakening a consciousness of citizenship, of common citizenship, 
and of what it means. Can a parish school, which is a class 
school, accomplish this? The very purpose of a parish school is, 
primarily and predominantly, to cement together a particular 
group within the state. It causes children of this group to 
associate with one another, not with children of other popula- 
tion-groups. And within this closed society the state never 
speaks in its own person, least of all with its own authority. 
It is an obviously sound axiom of administration that wher- 
ever public funds go, public control should go also.{ But a 
practicable method of public control within a parish school has 
never been devised. Nor is one likely to be discovered. For 
the teacher in such a school is appointed by and is answerable 
to the ecclesiastical power—is an agent of this power and not 
at all of the state. The act of teaching is here an act of the 
church, not the joint act of state and church, nor a mixture or 
alternation of acts first by the church and then by the state. 
There is, in short, no sphere within a parish school in which 
the state could act of its own authority; it would be able to 
act at all only by invitation, permission, or compact. 
Public appropriations for parish schools would therefore 
mark a sort of one-sided union of church and state, one-sided 
because, though it would assure the church of its sectarian aims, 
it would not assure the state that its children will receive a 
broadly social training. That any large number of citizens 
should be conscientiously unable to use the public schools 
is deeply to be regretted. That these citizens have shown 
their faith by paying, here and there, for a second set of day 
schools is a matter for admiration. But this is the cost to them 
of religious conditions that divide citizens instead of uniting 
them. The public should not pay the cost of that which 
separates citizens from one another. Not only so; it shouid 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
    260 STATE AND CHURCH 
be a settled part of public policy to keep the public schools so 
richly attractive, so broad, humane, and responsive to com- 
munity need, that they will continue to be, but in growing mea- 
sure, schools of the whole people, the great mixer and democ- 
ratizer of our heterogeneous population. 
How some Protestants would have religion taught in the 
public schools. The dissatisfaction of the Catholics touches 
the public school system as such, the basal principles of it. 
Protestants, as a rule, accept these principles, but there is con- 
siderable Protestant unrest over the way in which non-sectarian- 
ism works in actual practice. Many claim that the schools can 
teach religion and yet remain unsectarian, and the point is 
made again and again that, though the necessity for religious 
education is as broad as the nation, the present provisions for 
it are relatively narrow. In the first place, a considerable pro- 
portion of the children receives no religious instruction at home 
or through Sunday schools. In the next place, the amount of 
instruction given by the Sunday school to its pupils is piti- 
fully small. In the third place, the quality of the teaching in 
Sunday schools is unsatisfactory. Are we not, then, actually 
in danger of becoming a non-religious people? 
Moved by such considerations, many Protestants are strenu- 
ous to retain or to introduce Bible reading in the public schools. 
A smaller number calls for specific religious instruction in these 
schools. The nature of these proposals requires careful 
scrutiny. 
(1) The ground for demanding Bible reading in the schools is 
ambiguous. The argument shifts back and forth between the 
value of the Bible as literature, and its value for religious 
guidance. It might seem ungracious to suggest that effort is 
being made to introduce religious teaching under the head of 
merely literary study. Yet one can hardly help seeing in the 
background of this whole agitation the distinctly Protestant 
emphasis upon the Bible as the authoritative word of God. It is 
unlikely that the agitators for Bible reading would be satisfied 
to have the Bible treated in the schools exactly like other 
literature. No; a distinctive, unique reverence is expected, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
STATE AND CHURCH 261 
even worship in direct connection with the Scripture reading. 
In short, it is proposed to make the state schools an agency for 
propagating a distinctly Protestant attitude toward the au- 
thority of the Scriptures. 
(2) Protestant agitation for religion in the schools has not 
sufficiently considered that in the eyes of the law Catholic and 
non-Catholic versions of the Bible alike, and Protestant as well as 
Catholic worship, are coming to be regarded as sectarian. The 
crux of the matter is the Catholic claim to exclusive religious 
authority. This claim is, of course, sectarianism. But, justly, 
or unjustly, Catholic citizens take the ground that to deny this 
authority, or even to practise religion without recognizing it, is 
also sectarianism. Here, in fact, the population is cut in two, 
and the courts, quite naturally, attempt to keep the schools 
neutral as between them. Therefore any version of the Bible 
whatever will have only a precarious standing in the schools if a 
parent chooses to object to it as sectarian. The same is true 
of worship. It must be either Catholic or non-Catholic, and 
therefore open to objection from one side or the other. Objec- 
tion is not always made, to be sure. In communities that are 
fairly homogeneous in religious population, the schools often 
practise religion and teach it without producing friction. But 
growth of a community in size and in heterogeneity of race and 
of religion commonly puts an end to the old acquiescence in a 
particular type of religion in the schools, whereupon we face 
the alternative of introducing more types upon a plane of mu- 
tual equality, or else of excluding all. 
(3) Undue hopes are entertained as to the religious effect of 
listening to the reading of Bible passages. Again we hear a faint 
echo of the old Protestant conviction that in the very words of 
the Scriptures God speaks directly to each individual. Without 
doubt mere listening to elevated sentiments well phrased. has 
some effect upon the listener, especially if the words reinforce 
something that the pupil learns in other ways also. That is, 
Bible readings might be significantly fitted into a genuine plan 
for religious education, and such readings in the day school might 
happen to add something to the effectiveness of religious teach- 
   
-P-A-G-E-274
  262 STATE AND CHURCH ” 
ing in home or in Sunday school. But of themselves, as mere 
fragments, by chance related or not to other parts of a system, 
they cannot be regarded as having the educational significance 
that the vehemence of the agitation often seems to assume. 
(4) Plans are lacking for the preparation of public school 
teachers for the teaching of religion. No one can think that re- 
ligion can be taught by mere words regardless of the religious 
character and convictions of the teacher. No one who thinks 
in educational terms can suppose that the effective teaching 
of religion requires no specific preparation therefor. How, 
then, shall we assure ourselves of the personal and professional 
fitness of public school teachers in this matter? What shall be 
the tests? What shall the normal schools add to their curricu- 
lum? Merely to state these questions is to expose the educa- 
tional shortsightedness of the agitation for teaching religion in 
the schools. Imagine the state undertaking to prepare, test, 
and supervise teachers of religion! In the interest of religion 
itself we should deny that the state is competent to teach it. 
What a democratic state can contribute to a socialized 
religious education. The considerations to which we have 
just attended may seem at first sight to isolate the state from 
religion, and to strip and impoverish the human spirit, instead 
of enriching it, in the schools. It would be so if religion were 
identical with either dogmatism or ecclesiasticism. For both 
are in their inmost nature sectarian; they have always divided 
Christians from one another. If we should identify religion 
with them the schools would have to be secular not only in the 
sense already defined (that is, that they leave the organization 
of religion altogether to private initiative), but also in the sense 
that state education and religious education would pursue 
divergent rather than convergent aims. The schools, giving 
ultimate value to the broadly human, would have a tendency 
to promote a secularistic life in distinction from the religious 
life as thus conceived. But nothing of the kind will be implied 
if we advance from dogmatic and ecclesiastical standpoints in 
religious education to a fully social position. When we bring 
religious education under the conception of the democracy of 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
    STATE AND CHURCH 263 
God, we have a socially unifying aim to which everything that 
is truly democratizing and humanizing in state education con- 
tributes. For example, a public school that causes pupils of 
several racial groups to mingle with one another as neighbors, 
and to realize their unity in a common devotion to the flag as 
a symbol of liberty, promotes thereby the precise aims that 
socialized religion would have in a similar situation. In a 
certain school upon the Pacific coast the pupils of Caucasian 
extraction, though their daily life is surrounded by prejudice 
against Mongolians, have become convinced disciples of equal 
opportunity for Chinese pupils, and have even become protec- 
tors of Chinese children against aggression from “ Americans.” 
If an exactly parallel phenomenon were to occur in a Sunday 
school we should spontaneously think of it as a triumph of 
Christian education. 
The interest of a socialized religious education in the public 
schools is not that they should teach religion in addition to read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic, but that they should teach de- 
mocracy, and that they should do it thoroughly. To “teach” 
democracy, it need hardly be argued at this stage of our dis- 
cussion, means to develop intelligent democratic attitudes, 
activities, habits, and purposes—in short, to make the pupils 
democrats. 
Here lies the acutest part of the problem of moral instruction 
and training in the public schools. Real educators are chary 
of proposals to “introduce moral education” into the schools. 
It is there already in every piece of work that the pupils are led 
to do thoroughly; it is there in everything that produces loyalty 
to the reasonable rules of the school; it is there in the co-opera- 
tive life of schoolroom and playground; it is there in customs 
and measures that make for community consciousness and for 
political idealism—it cannot be introduced, it can only be im- 
proved. The improvement for which we most need to strive, 
about which anxiety is most-nearly justified, concerns, not a set 
of standard virtues that are the same under tyranny and under 
liberty, but measures for leading pupils to have as their own the 
great purposes of democracy, which are not only humane, but
-P-A-G-E-276
264 STATE AND CHURCH 
also constructive and aggressive. The problem of morals in the 
schools melts into the problem of creating ambition for a sort 
of society that is partly prefigured in our historic national 
ideals, but is still for the most part unachieved. Give us public 
schools that develop active interest in human welfare, passion 
for the basal rights of man as man, faith in the capacity of men 
for unselfishness, and the habit and purpose of co-operation— 
give us public schools like these, and social religion will look 
upon them as doing God’s will even though they do not name 
his name, but only that of his children. 
The appropriate policy for socialized religion with respect to 
the state schools, then, is neither to curb their influence be- 
cause they are secular, nor to induce them to take over worship 
or instruction in religion as such, but to get them to realize more 
and more the possibilities of government of the whole people, 
by the whole people, and for the whole people, and to provide 
ever better and better training of intelligence and of will with 
reference thereto. Ultimately all the schools may be expected 
to provide, as some do now, training in both remedial and pre- 
ventive philanthropy. In addition they will become nurseries 
of political progress, not indeed by being tools of political par- 
ties, but by constantly recalling attention to the human values 
that furnish the only ground for the real settlement of political 
questions. 
The specific educational functions of free religion in 
afree state. To organized religion there will remain the edu- 
cational privilege of inclusiveness and of prophecy. How long 
states will assume that national selfishness and self-will are 
politically legitimate, no one can say, but as long as they do, as 
long as the sociality of the state is arbitrarily limited to a race 
or to a territory, religious education will have the function of 
humanizing the state. In the name of the God of the whole 
earth, who is the Father of all men, the church must reveal the 
large sociality that takes in the self-governing state but tran- 
scends it. 
Just so, the great social problems of individual destiny, the 
destiny of friendship and love, and the destiny of the race it- 
   
-P-A-G-E-277
  STATE AND CHURCH 265 
self—problems of the meaning of life that call for the unflinch- 
ing eye and the resolute heart—will remain to the churches as 
voluntary associations. ‘There are depths of human need that 
the state does not undertake to sound. There are valleys of 
experience for which it provides no companion or guide. There 
are heights of self-sacrifice to which it does not venture to point. 
Through every social problem, moreover, whether it falls 
under the purview of the state school or not, there runs the com- 
mon human need for inspiration, for the divine inbreathing of 
hope, for uncompromising love, for far-sight, for letting go the 
half-gods in a great and ultimate faith in Fatherhood and 
Brotherhood. 
To the churches that have caught a glimpse of this educa- 
tional horizon falls the task of experimenting and agitating 
with a view to a permanent system of democratic religious in- 
struction and training for the children of the whole nation. Re- 
ligious education for the whole people must be provided by the 
churches at their own expense. Buildings, equipment, trained 
teachers, scientific supervision—all these must be had. No 
mere spurt or spasm will accomplish all this; we must enter 
upon a long campaign, only the beginnings of which we our- 
selves can live to see. The campaign will be expensive in point 
of financial cost, of loyal labor for a distant goal, of hard study 
and patient experiment, of disappointments, of deferred hopes, 
of strains between friends. But no one who knows the genius 
of the Christian religion will imagine that the love that loves 
to the uttermost can be otherwise than costly either to God or 
to those who would be godlike.

  CHAPTER XVIII 
THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF 
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 
The emergence of religious education within denomina- 
tional consciousness. The fact that Sunday schools are uni- 
versal in a denomination, or that improvements in them are 
actively labored for, does not of itself prove the presence of the 
idea of religious education in the denominational consciousness, 
much less of thought-out standards and policies for education 
as distinguished from other operations. As long as Sunday 
school teaching is controlled by the tacit assumption that it is 
a branch of expository preaching or of evangelistic appeal, there 
is little about it that is distinctive of education. Under these 
conditions such a simple, rudimentary educational process as 
habit-formation—to take a single example—is scarcely under- 
taken at all. Habits may be talked about, exhortations about 
them may be plentiful, but the actual habit-forming process is 
not under conscious control. This example may stand for 
many facts. The Sunday school, under these conditions, is a 
school chiefly in a germinal sense, practically all that is specifi- 
cally and technically educational not yet having come to clear 
consciousness. 
The lack of denominational educational consciousness in the 
immediate past is revealed and typified by the fact that in 
several large denominations the functions of a department of 
religious education are only now being differentiated from those 
of a denominational publishing house or society. That a de- 
nomination should have educational principles and policy; 
that the duty of carrying them into the whole denominational 
life should be committed to a corps of educational specialists; 
and that the Sunday-school publications should become organs 
266 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
      THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT — 267 
for such principles and policy under the guidance of these 
specialists—this is new to the old-line publisher, and it is new to 
the Sunday schools that are his patrons. 
As each of our cities has a department of education that 
is not confused, say, with the police department, or with the 
street department, and as every enlightened board of education 
seeks the services of an expert educator as superintendent of 
schools, so the unmistakable trend in the religious denominations 
is toward a distinct educational consciousness expressed in a 
department that employs expert and technical service. The 
idea of the “technical,” with its basis in the “scientific,” has 
come only slowly, it is true, into control even of the public 
schools; in many parts of the country it has not yet arrived at 
clear consciousness, but is subordinated to office-holding de- 
signs, or to ignorant economy. We must not be surprised when 
we meet like inertia in the churches. Official positions and 
financial costs will create problems and difficulties. But al- 
ready the movement of specializing toward the expert and the 
technical has begun on a denominational scale in several of the 
bodies. We may confidently expect that advances in religious 
education will be made in the future not merely school by 
school, but also denomination by denomination, thousands of 
schools going forward simultaneously. 
Unifying the educational work of a denomination. A sure 
sign of the infancy of educational consciousness on the denom- 
inational scale is our habit of identifying departments of re- 
ligious education with departments of Sunday schools. What, 
then, of young people’s societies and other organizations of the 
young, and what of denominational academies and colleges? 
The purpose of all these, as far as it is defined at all, is educa- 
tional in a broad, if not a technical, sense. The specific ground 
of their existence is expectation of religious results. But clarity 
of purpose, policies appropriate to the purpose, and efficiency in 
executing it, have been generally lacking. We have already 
noticed the waste in local societies through overlapping, dupli- 
cating, and scattering. This evil could be cured through whole 
denominations if they had a unified educational department. 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  
268 THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT 
That the general board of a young people’s society should be an 
independent department of a denomination, or even an outside 
body without responsibility to the educational authorities of 
the denomination, is as anomalous as would be, in the public 
schools, a department of physical culture that is not responsible 
to the superintendent of schools or to the board of education. 
As to denominational academies and colleges, it is not unfair 
to say that, though they are interested in both education and 
religion, they have rarely conceived of education in religion as 
their central function and the reason for their existence. There 
has been lack of a definite conception of religious education as 
a specialized undertaking based upon laws of growth and there- 
fore requiring both continuity and technical care. Adminis- 
trators who sincerely desire to promote Christian character 
have believed in technical proficiency and continuity anywhere 
but here, and they have rarely been ready to pay the cost of 
it. Instead, they have added inexpensive non-educational 
religion to expensive non-religious education. The most usual 
methods of doing this are the maintenance of unsystematized, 
discontinuous preaching; supporting either shoddy Bible study 
- because of its religiousness, or a sound department of Bible 
under the supposition that instruction in the Scriptures is re- 
ligious instruction or even religious education; transferring the 
religious functions of the institution to student Christian 
associations, with their immature leadership; and resorting 
to occasionalistic, high-pressure revival meetings. 
One element in the situation is, of course, the increasing 
difficulty of meeting the educational standards of state institu- 
tions. Imto new courses, new buildings, and new laboratory 
equipment, money and thought have been forced to go. Relig- 
ion has had no like force that it could bring to bear upon 
administrators. Hence it has tended to become, as far as 
administration is concerned, an appendage of education, or an 
accompaniment of it, and not a too expensive one. 
A final reason why the educational resources of each de- 
nomination have not been unified into a scheme of religious 
education is the inherent difficulty of constructing such a 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT — 269 
scheme upon the basis of a pre-social interpretation of the 
Christian religion. How can a college that awakens its students 
to the liberty of science advise the same students at the same 
time to take the intellectual attitudes of dogmatic religion? 
How can a college that opens the eyes of its students to law and 
growth and continuity in nature, in history, and in the mind of 
man, represent the religious experience as a separate, indepen- 
dent, and discontinuous thing? If an attempt is made to cul- 
tivate both, it is practically certain that two different sets of 
men will do the cultivating, that the religious work will be set 
off by itself and isolated, and that the religious appeal will 
tend toward occasionalism and toward emotions split off from 
academic interests. 
But when the Christian religion is conceived as the purpose 
to co-operate with God in building democracy, it offers a uni- 
fying and organizing, not dividing, principle for education. 
All the legitimate work of a college can be brought under this 
purpose. All of it will be vivified when it receives this baptism. 
The dawdling of students in our colleges; the childishness that 
clings to them after they have become grown men and women; 
the dilettanteism of alumni associations; the lack of positive 
content in college loyalty; the administrative drifting, and the 
atrophy of social will in the professor’s marooned specialty— 
this is our academic tragedy. This is the educational worldli- 
ness from which we must be converted. 
Here is the unique opportunity of the college that is willing 
as an institution to confess Christ. Let it conceive its whole 
mission in terms of the democracy of God. Let it test its cur- 
riculum, its administration, its budget, its alumni by their con- 
tributions to social welfare, social justice, and world society. 
Let it dare to be different from other colleges by having a focal- 
ized social purpose, whereas their purposes are dispersed and 
foggy. Let it consciously serve a cause, a radical cause that 
appeals to the idealism of youth. And in all this let it not 
assign God to any compartment of the mind, but assuming that 
“where love is God is,” let it teach its students to find com- 
munion with him precisely in social relations with men, in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-282
  270 THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT 
social task, in all the study that prepares for it, and in the in- 
spiration that impels to it. 
One can imagine the entire educational machinery of a de- 
nomination coming under the control of this unifying purpose. 
One would then behold a sight as inspiring as it would be new— 
the Sunday school, the societies, the academies, and the colleges 
all marching together toward a single goal. What an immea- 
surable, unprecedented contribution to society would accrue 
if even one Christian body should thus organize its educational 
powers. But to do it an educational department would be 
necessary, a2 department that could command the services of 
experimenters, writers, editors, promoters, and administrators; 
that could have access to all the educational agencies of the 
denomination, and that could be to each of them a medium 
of denominational stimulus and of denominational support. 
Producing teachers and leaders. In a denominational policy 
like this nothing is more vital than to provide real educators, 
and nothing is more difficult. For the push is toward specializa- 
tion, the technical, the ascertainably efficient, not toward mere 
proclamation, exhortation, or agitation, which are far easier. 
The task that is before us is nothing less than to provide a con- 
tinuous supply of skilled workers through the whole depart- 
ment, from the humblest lay teacher in a Sunday school to the 
corps of professional experts who guide the entire denomina- 
tion. 
(1) Training the unpaid lay workers in the parish. “Teacher 
training” is too narrow a term for what is here intended. For 
officers of a Sunday school, as well as teachers, require help. 
Nor is the Sunday school all. The church school must include, 
as we have seen, all the work for children and youth, and there- 
fore the work of parents and of various leaders of groups. 
Hence, the training division or department of the school will 
touch perhaps the major part of the adult active members of the 
parish. ‘To suggest that this mass of laymen should be trained 
by the church for genuine skill as educators will perhaps cause 
some persons to smile at the visionariness of the proposal, and 
others to frown in dismay at the crushing responsibilities that 
would fall upon church administrators. I have no desire to
-P-A-G-E-283
THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT 271 
conceal the degree to which church life will have to be trans- 
formed if this vision is to be realized. Sunday and week-day 
meetings to which church members are now invited for their 
own spiritual refreshment will to a large extent be converted 
into periods for instruction and drill in the specific duties of 
church workers. Instead of “attending the church service,” 
one will give the church service, and study how to give the best. 
Worship, as a result, will have more point, and more firm 
attachment to daily living. The desultoriness of miscellaneous 
sermonizing, too, will give place to continuity, system, and the 
urgency of immediate needs. 
To convert a listening church into a working church is not the 
matter of a day or of a season but of a generation. Many an 
experiment must be made, not every one of which will succeed. 
Advance will not be steady or even all along the line. We 
must use half-measures as a means to better ones. We must 
honour any layman’s best, however imperfect it may be. But, 
granted this spirit of tolerant, patient practicality, a policy of 
constant pressure toward skilled churchmanship will in one 
generation produce a new type of churchman. 
The content and the methods of training courses for different 
sorts of lay workers in religious education cannot here be dis- 
cussed in any detail. The most that is permitted is a hint or 
two as to some fundamental conditions of efficiency. 
First, The possibility of developing a body of skilled non- 
professional religious educators grows out of the fact that 
both the motive for study and the material that most needs to 
be studied lie within the sphere of the domestic instincts, par- 
ticularly the parental. Between instinctive fondness for 
children and Christian love for mankind there is entire con- 
tinuity. Training in the motive to teach, then—and this is the 
corner-stone of the whole enterprise—will consist in bringing 
the parental instinct into action, whether one is a parent or 
not, and in developing instinctive attachments into an intelli- 
gent Christian purpose to transform society into a family of God. 
Stated in another way, the basis of the best training is the in- 
telligent focussing of one’s Christian experience upon the social 
will of God as it applies to children and youth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  272 THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT 
Second, This experience of God in an intelligently develop- 
ing fondness for children is to be had primarily through one’s 
own interactions with particular children, not through child- 
study generalizations made by other persons. The material for 
study is first of all living beings, and only secondarily books. 
Many a training class, reversing this order, has gotten as 
far as the book, and then stopped, Labor was put upon defini- 
tions and laws under the supposition that somehow the knowl- 
edge of them would constitute knowledge of children, but in the 
end these formule did not even introduce the student to real 
children, but remained mere lumber in the attic of the mind. 
No; observation of children is fundamental. It needs to be 
guided, of course, for the most effective observation, as has 
been said, is that which puts definite questions to nature. But 
in this case the questions that most need to be asked are not 
the critically analytical ones of the theoretical psychologist 
(such as the precise number and the classification of the instincts, 
the precise nature of imitation, or the part played by motile 
images in the growth of intelligence), but broader questions as 
to children’s conduct, particularly how they act in given social 
situations. For the objective point throughout is to be able to 
make such changes in social situations as will produce desired 
changes in children’s social attitudes, purposes, and habits. 
Not that we need to be shy of academic generalizations, but 
that we should follow the rule of good teaching that formule 
are to be brought in when the pupil already has something that 
needs formulating. The end of our teaching in the training 
class, moreover, is not the achievement of a sound generaliza- 
tion, as it is in much academic teaching, but ability to regulate 
the social relations of children so as to get certain social results. 
Of course the professional educators who are back of this train- 
ing of laymen will control their own thinking in some measure 
by finer distinctions and more details of a technical kind, but 
what the rank and file of the lay educators require is the more 
homespun sort of wisdom. 
Third, In accordance with the well-worn maxim that we learn 
by doing, practice in educational processes or part-processes 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
    THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT — 273 
is fundamental in the training of lay educators. We must rid 
our constituency of the naive superstition that teacher training 
consists in Jaying in a stock of ideas about teaching. Ideas 
are, of course, essential to skill, which is ability to get a specific 
result by means of knowledge. But skill is achieved by the 
fusion of doing and thinking into one. ‘Training for the church- 
school worker, then, will not be isolated from the actual work 
of the school. The school itself will be his immediate object 
of study, and his relation to it as a student will be that of an 
apprentice. Observation and practice, then, which we may call 
the laboratory method, will assume the primacy that the text- 
book now holds. 
Fourth, The fallacy of outline courses must be exposed and 
abandoned; that is, the attempt to cover a wide area in a short 
time by making the instruction very thin. This is not the way 
to gain even abstract knowledge, much less to gain skill. 
“One thing at a time, and this done well.” The acquisition of 
firm control in a single process is not only important in itself; 
it has also an outreaching influence. It is almost fascinating 
to witness the general transformation in the attitude of a teacher 
who, having conquered his faults in a particular process, now 
knows that he can deliberately get the results that he aims at. 
Such an experience carries a teacher a hundred times further 
toward general skill than committing to memory abstract formu- 
lee for the whole of good teaching. 
Therefore, if the time available for training during any one 
season happens to be short, we must not on this account dilute 
the contents of the course. Whether the time be long or short, 
let the work be intensive, and let the standard be demonstrated 
improvement in some actual educational process, whether story- 
telling, preparing lesson plans or schemes of questioning, keep- 
ing records, making reports, conducting worship, teaching one’s 
own child his first prayer, or merely discovering the cause of 
inattention on a particular occasion. 
(2) The opportunity of the college to produce lay leaders of parish 
education. Granted the social view of collegiate education, as 
outlined in a preceding section, there are three points at which
-P-A-G-E-286
  274 THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT 
the college may be expected to touch the problem of religious 
education in a positive way. First, the college will promote 
by educational methods the immediate religious growth of its 
students. Second, it will include in its curriculum a study of 
the church as a social institution. This study will concern 
both the aims and the methods of a socialized church, and its 
general result will be to send the students back to their home 
churches qualified to support progressive measures, and to in- 
itiateandleadthem. Third, this elementary study of the church 
will awaken some of the students to the possibilities and the 
attractions of the ministry as a life-work, professional specializa- 
tion in religious education being included. Though a college 
offers no specifically professional training, it may nevertheless 
perform the extremely important service of a selective agency 
for the ministry. Such colleges, however, as offer professional 
training in preparation for high school teaching may not un- 
reasonably be asked to lay the foundations for the profession of 
religious education also. 
Postponing for a moment the problems of professional train- 
ing for religious education, however, let us glance at the possi- 
bilities suggested under the second of the just-mentioned heads. 
There is a common complaint that college experience, even 
high school experience, not only does not increase the loyalty of 
young people to the church but actually cools their ardor. The 
usual interpretation of this cooling process is that the intellec- 
tual life has been cultivated at the expense of the religious 
life. The remedy that is usually offered, accordingly, is the 
cultivation of a personal religious life alongside the intellectual 
life. 
Underlying this prescription and the diagnosis that precedes 
it are several assumptions that require scrutiny. On what 
ground can we assert that the churches, as they now are, fur- 
nish the one natural sphere for the religious life of educated men 
and women? Is it certain, then, that growing indifference to 
his church on the part of a collegian connotes decline in his 
personal religion? Is it not just possible that some part of the 
difficulty grows out of the fact that while his religious outlook 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT = 275 
widens and his religious capacities increase, the church seems to 
him to be static? What does the church do to show him that 
it is not so? What assurance have we that students really 
understand what the church is and does? Should we expect 
them to come back to their home churches to repeat over and 
over the things that they did when they were just emerging 
from childhood? If not, what church work is there that calls 
for the collegian’s trained powers, and how can he learn what 
this work is and what it requires? 
The answer to these doubts is this: First, a large part of the 
trouble grows out of the student’s sheer ignorance of the 
churches, neither the churches nor the college having provided 
him with the information that his growing mind requires. 
Rather, when he famishes for information he is given exhorta- 
tion. Second, least of all has the college or the church revealed 
to him the place and the possibilities of the church as a social 
institution that has a contribution to make to the general social 
movement. Third, personal religious life has been cultivated 
too much upon the plane of individual status, and not enough 
upon the plane of a social purpose held in common. A purpose 
to build a democracy of God, rather than dogma or emotional 
experiences, should be the basis of religious fellowship in the 
college. Fourth, the particular church work in which by far 
the largest number of laymen is systematically engaged, namely, 
religious education, calls most naturally for educated leader- 
ship, yet the college student, instead of having his eyes opened 
to the nature of religious education and to the possibility of 
skilful service in it, is allowed to think of it in terms of the poor 
teaching that he himself received in the Sunday school when 
he was a child. 
The obvious way to deepen the religious life and the church 
ioyalty of college students, then, is to give them opportunity 
to study religion as social purpose, the church as an instrument 
of possible social advance, and religious education as an oppor- 
tunity for educated laymen to help transform the church it- 
self! At the present moment our real problem is less that of 
adjusting the student to the church than that of opening in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  276 THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT 
church a highway for the social aspirations that are already 
present in the minds of the thoughtful. 
There are the best of academic reasons why a course on church 
life or on religious education should include not only general 
principles, but also sufficient details of process to enable the 
student to judge a specimen of teaching and to begin teaching. 
If the college of yesterday cherished the notion that close con- 
tact with particular facts is non-essential if only generalizations 
are well defined, the college of to-day assumes that, even in the 
interest of a vital grasp of general principles themselves, speci- 
men facts, at least, need to be observed and analyzed by the 
student himself, not merely described by the professor or by 
the text-book. ‘Therefore a consciously close relation of a col- 
lege study to a life purpose or a foreseen duty reinforces the 
study itself. Hence, collegiate study of religious education 
should make the student acquainted with the actual materials 
used in the church school, with the actual processes employed, 
with the actual problems of administration. He should see 
them ail with eyes that are wide open to the great social princi- 
ples that are involved, and to the general underlying laws of 
teaching. That is, the best college teaching of religious educa- 
tion, even if no specific professional training is undertaken, will 
nevertheless prepare the student to be a leader in the actual 
educational work of the church. 
That insight into the principles and the methods of a social- 
ized religious education will bring inspiration to do the work 
itself, let no one doubt. Our idealistic young people bless us 
when we show them a way in which to make idealism effective. 
The hard part of the problem is not with them, but with college 
administration on the one hand, and with church administration 
on the other. Without uncharitableness, and without blame 
for limitations for which historical excuses can be made, we 
may say that the inertia of institutionalism in the administra- 
tion of both college and church is the chief obstacle that stands 
in the way of a supply of lay leaders in religious education. 
There are notable instances of colleges that have already be- 
gun to follow the gleam, but many are faltering, compromising, 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
    THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT — 277 
or delaying. Too many of our college authorities have not half 
freed themselves from the pre-social view of the functions of a 
college. Most administrative officers are half paralyzed by the 
sleeping sickness of educational conventionality. Even relig- 
ious colleges have not taken pains to relieve the individualistic 
squint with which students interpret to themselves the meaning 
of the Christian religion. Otherwise more, many more, of the 
colleges would be eager, would vie with one another, to intro- 
duce students to such an intensive study of religion and of the 
church as would produce intelligent and aggressive laymen. 
On the other hand, what is more certain to rob the church of 
skilled lay service than the discovery on the part of collegians 
that their minister is cold toward their progressive ideas, their 
fresh enthusiasms, their discontent with things as they are, 
and warm only toward repetition of things as they have been? 
There are ministers, and the number is growing, who really 
lead their people forward and not merely ’round and ’round a 
circle. But there are others who neither lead forward nor sup- 
port laymen who are willing to take burdens of leadership upon 
themselves. Concerning these ministers the greatness of the 
cause calls for plain speaking. I speak not of hypothetical possi- 
bilities but of repeated occurrences when I say that it is folly, 
if it is not treason to the church, for a minister so to receive a 
young collegian who is eager to take part in aggressive religion 
as to make him feel isolated, not understood, suspected of being 
“unspiritual,” religiously suppressed. It should be regarded 
as a clerical scandal for a minister to discourage such reforms in 
the Sunday school as are universally approved by competent 
authorities. If we can excuse in the aged some inability to 
desire change, we can also retire the aged from leadership. 
But what shall we say of the minister who, before the age for 
retirement comes, will neither take the trouble to become a 
competent leader in parish education, nor seek out competent 
leaders, nor welcome the services of those who, having caught 
a vision of better things, desire opportunity to serve? 
(3) Producing professional workers in religious education. 
It is obvious that the unpaid parish workers whom we have
-P-A-G-E-290
  278 THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT 
thus far considered must have guidance from professional 
leaders, that is, those who receive pay for their service on the 
ground of its expert quality and on the ground of the time, 
labor, and expense required to become and to remain an expert. 
The term “expert”? must be interpreted liberally. In the in- 
fancy of the reform of religious education it cannot mean the 
finished craftsman, but only the one who, using such oppor- 
tunities for study and for experience as actually exist, is more 
ready than others to make wise experiments in reconstruction. 
In this class we must place, or be able to place, the pastor, the 
parish director of religious education, the employed lay parish 
worker, the writers and editors of lessons and of material for 
teachers, the secretarial force of the denomination’s central 
department of religious education, and teachers of religious 
education in colleges, theological seminaries, and _ training- 
schools for professional lay workers. 
First, A denomination that does not trifle with its own 
spiritual life will pursue the policy of producing as quickly as 
possible a generation of pastors who are competent when they 
enter upon their ministry to lead their parishes in religious edu- 
cation. More than one denomination already requires every 
candidate for the ministry to pass an examination in this 
subject. This shows which way the wind is blowing. But it is 
of itself little more than a straw, for a meagre smattering of 
information suffices to meet the present requirement. The 
theological seminaries are somewhat generally increasing the 
amount of their instruction in this subject. But if we ask 
whether they are now ready to supply the churches of the coun- 
try with pastors who are competent to guide their parishes in 
the reconstruction of religious education—competent, not in the 
sense of accomplished and mature craftsmanship, but in the 
sense of knowing how to begin and how to keep on learning— 
we must confess that no denomination has yet brought its semi- 
naries to this standard. 
The seminaries, like the colleges, are hampered by pre- 
social views of their educational function. They are divided in 
their curriculum and in their methods between a desire to make
-P-A-G-E-291
  THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT — 279 
their students accomplished and a desire to make them efficient. 
Much, very much, has still to be done, too, upon the theory both 
of Christian experience and of the church as a social agency. 
But certain parts of the issue are clear. It is fair to put these 
two questions to any seminary: Are you ready, and are you 
equipped in faculty and in library, to utilize the church’s ex- 
perience in religious education, and the resources of educational 
science as these bear upon education specifically in religion? 
If so, have you so organized the requirements that you make 
of your students, and the motives that you bring to bear upon 
them, that your graduates go out, as a matter of fact, equipped 
as beginners in the professional guidance of religious education 
in a parish? 
Second, A denomination that is educationally awake will 
apply the same principle to the curriculum and the methods of 
training-schools for professional lay workers, such as deacon- 
esses, pastor’s assistants, parish visitors, Sunday-school super- 
intendents, and missionaries. These schools, in fact, having 
fewer educational traditions to hamper them, have outstripped 
the seminaries in this respect. Great possibilities of specialized 
professional lay service are appearing upon the horizon. If 
a really scientific training in the educational branch of Chris- 
tian work gets a footing in the training-schools three things are 
likely to happen: Much unspecialized and relatively ineffective 
parish work will give way to specialized and effective reconstruc- 
tion of parish education; professional standards in this depart- 
ment will react upon other departments, so that they too will 
require and receive specialized skill; and opportunities thus 
opened will attract into the ranks of the professional lay workers 
a larger number of able, ambitious, and well educated candidates. 
Third, A denomination that sees the full truth that religious 
education is properly a specialized operation, to be guided by 
scientific insight as well as inspired by religious motives, will 
have to put the training of its directors of religious education 
and of its editors and secretaries in this department upon a foot- 
ing corresponding to the best practice in the preparation of 
superintendents of public education. It is true that most of 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  280 THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT 
our superintendents of public education have not had the best 
preparation; boards of education are still obliged to employ the 
effectively handy man, the faithful routine man, or the one- 
sidedly progressive man where a real educator is needed. Just 
so, the denominations must utilize in positions of educational 
power many a man who, though facilities for adequate pro- 
fessional training are still very scarce, and only yesterday did 
not exist, has demonstrated in semi-technical ways a capacity for 
leadership. But meantime men of this type see, and the de- 
nominations must see, that these positions are bound to become 
more and more technical. The ministry is to become differenti- 
ated into at least three specialties, the pastorate, missionary 
service, and education, and each will require, say, three years 
of training governed strictly by foresight of the particular func- 
tions of each. Already events have occurred in more than one 
denomination that make it practically certain that the editorial 
and administrative branches of Sunday school departments will 
yet be put wholly upon this technical basis. As to the direc- 
torate of religious education, one sign of the times is that the 
men and women who form the Department of Church Directors 
in the Religious Education Association have adopted as a qual- 
ification for active membership a three years’ theological course 
that includes religious education, or else a two years’ course in 
an approved school of religious pedagogy. 
Fourth, A denomination that commits itself to these policies 
will discover that one of its chief difficulties concerns a supply 
of competent teachers of religious education in colleges, theo- 
logical seminaries, and training-schools. It goes without say- 
ing that a college or seminary professorship of religious educa- 
tion implies capacity for research as well as for teaching. Large 
library facilities, and a school of religion in which principles 
may be practised, demonstrated, and discovered by experiment 
also loom before us as ultimately indispensable. In all these 
respects we are in the first beginnings. We have to make our 
way without precedents; heavy costs have to be added to in- 
stitutional budgets; correlations with other departments of 
instruction and research have to be created, and meantime the
-P-A-G-E-293
  THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT _ 281 
field is calling aloud for results. Some of these problems will 
be opened still further in the next chapter. Already, however, 
it should be plain that the denominational problem reaches all 
the way from the Sunday school to the theological seminary 
and the university. 
The denominational department of religious education as 
an agency for social reconstruction. The conception that we 
have now reached is that, just as the present denominational 
department of foreign missions reaches its hand down to every 
local society, outward to every mission field, and upward to the 
recruiting and training of missionaries, so the denominational 
department of religious education should stimulate the think- 
ing of layman and minister alike, and should guide and organ- 
ize practice in both the teaching of children and in the teaching 
of their teachers. But there are various possible ambitions for 
such a department within the scope of this general statement, 
as: Ambition to be the exclusive purveyor of printed matter 
for the Sunday schools of the denomination; ambition to fix 
a particular curriculum upon the whole denomination; ambition 
to develop denominationalism by drilling children in it; or, 
in contrast to all these, and in necessary opposition to them, 
ambition to make of the entire denomination a devoted and 
trained force for the Christian reconstruction of society in the 
large. An intense, firmly knit denominational consciousness 
can be neither approved nor disapproved until we know to what 
it devotes its energies. If it merely feeds itself, and then uses 
its ensuing strength to feed itself again; if its great contribu- 
tion to the world is an invitation to join the denomination, then 
the best that can be said for it is that it represents social develop- 
ment, but arrested development. When the great social de- 
votion comes, these half-gods will go. And the central function 
of a department of religious education is to awaken the great 
devotion herefore denominational consciousness will be 
quickened into interdenominational consciousness, community 
consciousness, world consciousness.) This will be done through 
the social content of lesson material; through provision for the 
practice of social service; through community religious enter-

  282. THE DENOMINATIONAL DEPARTMENT 
prises, such as teacher training, in contrast to merely denomina- 
tional enterprises; through encouragement to experimentation 
and variety as against uniformity; through participation of 
denominational leaders in great non-denominational move- 
ments for educational and social advance. Such a department 
of religious education makes for denominational strength, but 
not for denominationalism. It makes, rather, for the democracy 
of God. co

  CHAPTER XIX 
BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 
The value of denominational variety in religious educa- 
tion. We are now to consider the need of organizing religious 
education upon a basis broader than that of the denomination. 
The implication will be that there are some important things 
that denominations as such are not best qualified to do. Lest 
this implication should be interpreted as depreciation of active 
denominational loyalty, let it be said in advance that some im- 
portant ends are best attained through free variation. We 
may think of the history of each religious body as an experi- 
ment in social religion, and of the educational work of each as 
an experiment in religious education. Now, in a matter as 
complicated as this, a variety of experiments, each bringing 
some particular factor or method into the foreground, has its 
own value. At a later point in our discussion, Part V, we shall 
see how, as a matter of fact, several types and tendencies in 
Christian education have sprung up, each having something to 
contribute toward the effective socialized type that is the ob- 
jective point of our present aspiration. It is not to be supposed 
that we can invent education any more than we can invent 
family life. In both matters we have, rather, to reflect upon 
what already exists in order to find elements worthy to be built 
into a fairer structure, as well as to discover what to avoid. 
We learn to educate by educating. It is by following out vari- 
ous ideas that their value or their lack of value is demonstrated. 
In fact, the “trial-and-error method”’ of learning applies not 
only to a rat that is finding out how to get the cheese, not only 
to a child who is adjusting himself to the laws of family life, but 
also to educators who desire to know how best to educate. 
283 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  284 BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 
The verdict of history upon the denominational phase of the 
Christian religion is likely to be that in the narrower loyalties 
men received a training in free co-operation that was an essen- 
tial preliminary to the wider co-operations that lead on to a 
just world organization. Hence, the part of wisdom is not to 
lower the intensity of denominational loyalty, but to socialize 
its content ever more and more. The reform of religious educa- 
tion needs a background, not of denominational sloth or half- 
heartedness, but of active devotion to whatever educational ideal 
seems vital from the denominational point of view. “ Devotion 
to an ideal” means, of course, something more than speeding 
up the machinery of a routine, something more than a prej- 
udice charging into battle, something more than conceited com- 
placency; it means, rather, the sort of conviction and of earnest- 
ness that goes with the open eye, the eye that discriminates 
between ideals, that recognizes Christliness beyond the pale, 
yes, that looks ever for discrepancies between one’s social prac- 
tice and the Christian ideal. Denominational loyalty like this 
will contribute to the wider organization of men, not hinder it. 
But such devotion will draw upon extradenominational re- 
sources. ‘To these let us now turn. 
A common social purpose tends to create common organs 
for itself. ‘To the extent that any denomination teaches the 
Christian principle of social justice and of world society, it 
creates a psychological necessity for organizations of the Chris- 
tian consciousness more broad than the denomination. An indi- 
vidualistic religion, whether of the sacerdotal, or of the dog- 
matic, or of the experiential type, can express itself fully within 
the walls of a sect. Its interest in the world at large is to get 
men inside the same walls. But when one has the social mind 
of Christ one’s ambition is to give effect to it wherever and how- 
ever one can in all the world by combining with any man who 
is willing to go any distance, great or small, in the same direc- 
tion. The achievement of a social interpretation of the gospel 
leads right on toward the achievement of interdenominational 
union of effort. Love has to produce organization, both be- 
cause love makes men want to be in one another’s company, 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 285 
and because it gives them a common purpose to do a large work. 
One can easily witness in the Federal Council of the Churches 
the contrast between the inhibiting effect of doctrinal sensitive- 
ness and the emancipating effect of social purpose. ‘The dele- 
gates can heartily agree, for example, to work for a weekly rest 
day, though they cannot agree upon the scriptural basis for 
Sunday observance. 
A social theory of religious education is bound to have its 
eyes turned toward the wide organization of religious educa- 
tion itself. Without at all overestimating the clarity or the 
unity of social purpose in the Religious Education Association, 
one can nevertheless see that the fundamental source of its 
peculiar influence is its social spirit and outlook. Here is a 
society that does not publish text-books, that does not control 
any curriculum, that founds no schools, that has no authority 
over or official entrance into any school, that was not founded 
by the denominations, and is not supported by their funds but 
chiefly by contributions from individuals belonging to the 
underpaid salaried classes; yet this society has touched with a 
quickening hand almost the whole of Protestant religious educa- 
tion in this country and to some extent in foreign lands. It has 
been able to do this, in the first place, because of the social, 
co-operative spirit that was growing within the denominations. 
The organization was a practical necessity because, scattered 
through the religious bodies, there was a large and growing num- 
ber of educators who had begun to conceive education in more 
social terms than those of dogma or of ecclesiasticism, even in 
terms of the needs of modern society. Hence it comes to pass 
that the deliberations that have taken place under the auspices 
of the Association have almost constantly placed side by side 
problems of social advance and problems of educational organ- 
ization, method, and material. If nothing more had been ac- 
complished than to furnish a clearing-house of ideas for all sorts 
of workers in religious education, the social significance would 
have been large. But there is here, in addition, nothing less 
than the forerunner of a unified educational consciousness 
among the Protestant bodies.
-P-A-G-E-298
  286 BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 
What administrative organs this consciousness will produce 
cannot be said as yet. The Sunday School Council of Evangeli- 
cal Denominations, founded by the voluntary action of de- 
nominational editors, publishers, and secretaries, may possibly 
become a sort of federal legislative council for determining com- 
mon policies, standards, and methods within a restricted group 
of denominations. Inasmuch, however, as each body that is 
represented in the Council has what amounts to a veto power 
upon all acts, the policies that can be agreed upon will be 
shaded toward an average or toward a mimimum; they will not 
represent the best that the more progressive denominations 
are already prepared to do. 
Another interdenominational body, the Federal Council’s 
Commission on Christian Education, has begun to consider 
important special problems. Here is an agency that might 
conceivably do much to promote the socializing of religious 
education, particularly through some close connection with the 
other social activities of the Council. Yet we have to recognize 
the significance of the fact that socially hesitant denominations 
have equal rights with socially progressive ones in the Federal 
Council, and that religious education is the point at which 
social hesitancy is most likely to become social obstruction. 
The oldest of all the interdenominational societies in the 
field of religious education, the American Sunday School Union, 
is devoting its energies chiefly to founding new Sunday schools 
of an entirely conventional type. The International Sunday 
School Association, which touches directly the largest number 
of schools, and could conceivably lead in reform, is not only 
subject to the same limitations upon progressiveness as the 
Sunday School Council, but its policy has been so distinctly 
and for so long a time controlled by religious conservatism that 
does not think in either social or educational terms, that the 
Association, instead of leading in the reconstruction of religious 
education, has had to be painfully won to the cause. The 
momentum of this conservatism has been lost, and the engine 
has now been caught upon a dead centre. Yet here is a vast 
amount of machinery for interdenominational co-operation,
-P-A-G-E-299
  BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 287 
machinery that is too valuable to be thrown upon the scrap- 
heap, or to be kept at the less significant operations. It used 
to be the proud boast of Association leaders that under its 
guidance nearly all the Protestant Sunday schools of the coun- 
try, and many in foreign parts, studied the same lesson on Sun- 
day. ‘This was interpreted as a marching together of the forces 
of Protestantism. The bursting of this fancy through more 
careful analysis of the educative process does not rebuke the 
notion that Protestantism might really march together, nor does 
it forbid the International Association to organize the marchers. 
But concrete social goals are necessary. Bible study is not the 
goal, but only a means thereto. If the religious earnestness 
that has always characterized this old society should turn to 
the social significance of the gospel, and the social ends of 
religious education, there is no knowing what contributions to 
the wider organization of Christian forces might result. 
The basis for the wider organization of religious education is 
a common purpose to do the will of God in establishing the de- 
mocracy of God upon earth. Without denying social value to 
unions formed upon a narrower platform than this, and without 
impatience with ancient shibboleths that say nothing of mercy, 
or of justice, or of world society, we must nevertheless see that 
nothing but love is a sufficient organizing principle—not our 
reasonings about love, but the act of loving, and the purpose to 
go on loving to the uttermost. When we conceive religious 
education as having the function of inspiring the young with 
this Christian purpose, and of training them in methods of 
making it effective in the world, then religious education will 
create for itself organs as broad as the purpose. 
This principle is illustrated in the Missionary Education 
Movement. Here is an organization that is doing educational 
work for and in many denominations as their common organ. 
If I mistake not, this is the nearest approach that has yet been 
made to an effective, working union of several denominations. 
It has come to pass almost silently, and now that it is here it 
has the “feel” of a natural and simple part of every-day life. 
What has made this possible? The clarification of the mis-
-P-A-G-E-300
288 BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 
sionary motive as that of outgoing, sacrificial love. Denomina- 
tional differences do not keep us apart when we ask, What are 
the conditions of child-life or of the life of women, or of the life 
of men in central Africa or in western China, and what can we 
do to improve these conditions? In short, the foundation for 
a wide and effective organization of religious education is pre- 
cisely the socializing of the content and purpose of our religion. 
The wholesomeness of independent criticism and propa- 
ganda, and the unwholesomeness of anything like a de- 
nominational educational trust. Anthropologists tell us that 
one great reason of the backwardness of the native tribes in the 
interior of Africa is that they have had so little intercourse with 
other peoples. Historians are accustomed to point out the 
quickening of the mind that comes from contact of one civiliza- 
tion with another. It is not less true that every religious 
denomination requires for its own health plentiful contact with 
standpoints and practices other than its own. Religious in- 
breeding connotes, in the natural order of things, religious 
deterioration. There is not a denomination to which inde- 
pendent agitation and propaganda of religious education reaches 
that has not cause to be thankful for it. This is true even from 
the standpoint of denominationalism except when it assumes the 
position of infallibility. Independent criticism, independent 
publications, fresh experiments—these enable me to see, as I 
could not by looking at myself, just what I am doing, and how 
I can better attain my present ends. But independent agitation 
has the added value of helping me to revise my ends. Unless I 
claim infallibility, I must be ready to revise them, and I ought to 
be thankful for stimulation to clear thinking and deep feeling 
with respect to them. 
A denominational department of religious education that en- 
deavors to be self-sufficient is bound to injure its own cause. 
Any combination of denominations that undertakes to build 
walls that shall keep out everything that has not been produced 
within the enclosure will fail, of necessity, to provide the best 
possible. Love must keep open house to ideas as well as to 
persons. It must receive as well as give. No group of denom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
    BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 289 
inational leaders is wise enough to prescribe the uniformly best 
course of lessons, or the uniformly best lesson publications, 
or the uniformly best schemes for teacher training for even one 
denomination. There is no uniformly best for schools and 
conditions that are not uniform. And if the uniformly best for 
to-day could be discovered, to-morrow it would no longer be 
so, but would be at some point or other a hinderance to the best. 
Beyond all this we need to keep in mind the history of pub- 
lishing houses that have enjoyed a monopoly, or anything ap- 
proaching it, within a given ecclesiastical market. When busi- 
ness processes and religious officialism blend, the possibilities 
of confusion are immeasurable. Such a combination is, on 
the whole, as deceptive as desire for riches. Not that religion 
and business should be kept apart from each other. The crux 
of the matter is in the monopolistic tendency; it is in the pur- 
suit, in ecclesiastical business, of economic policies that are 
socially objectionable anywhere. If we unite such policies 
with religious education, we must curtail its social purpose from 
the outset, and we subject it to the necessity of endless com- 
promises. 
The inference, which is confessedly harder to put into prac- 
tice than is the policy of the closed market, is that religious 
education will get on most rapidly toward its social goal when a 
variety of influences has access to every church school. The 
problem of adaptation to particular local conditions should be 
kept constantly alive. The study of what other schools are 
doing should be steadily encouraged. The habit of openness 
toward new ideas and methods and materials, from whatever 
source appearing, and some capacity for judging them, should 
be one of the aims in the training of teachers and of leaders. 
Such a policy will not only enable schools here and there to do 
more excellent work; it will react favorably upon the denomi- 
national or interdenominational publishing enterprise itself. 
Greater acuteness and foresight in the securing of material, 
greater attractiveness in the presentation of it, and greater 
business skill in manufacturing and selling will be the effects. 
The participation of universities in the making of religious 
 
-P-A-G-E-302

290 BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 
educators. When religious education acquires the purpose of 
taking a definite part in the evolution of society as a whole, and 
when, in order to fulfil this purpose, we undertake to lift the 
teaching of religion from the plane of traditional routine to that 
of a scientifically controlled process, we obligate ourselves to 
cosmopolitanism of intellect as well as of heart. To make it 
effective, we must go on to assume the university attitude 
of freedom, of scientific method, of eagerness for new knowl- 
edge and for the widest organization of knowledge. In the 
preparation of leaders the top round of the ladder will not be 
the training-school (under whatever name it goes), but the school 
or combination of schools (under whatever name) that has the 
university’s range of instruction, together with the spirit of 
research and facilities therefor. 
The course of recent events leaves no ambiguity as to the 
manner in which this requirement is to be met, namely, by com- 
bining the work of a department or school of theology with the 
work of a university department of education. The school of 
theology will contribute, in general, an intensive study of 
religion and of its works; the university department of educa- 
tion will contribute to outlook upon education and to inlook into 
the psychology of it. To be more specific, the range of oppor- 
tunity for one who desires to become a technically accomplished 
specialist in religious education may be expected to include the 
following: 
(a) The history of religion. 
(b) The psychology of religion. 
(c) The philosophy of religion. 
(d) The sociology of religion. 
(e) The general history of education. 
(f) The special history of religious education. 
(g) The psychology of education. 
(h) The religious life of children and youth. 
(t) Observation and analysis of the teaching process in the day school. 
(7) Observation and analysis of the teaching process in the church 
school or school of religion. 
(k) The general principles and methods of school administration. 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 291 
(1) The special methods of administration in religious education. 
(m) Closely supervised practice in religious education. 
(n) Provision for experimental study of religious education. 
(0) The philosophy or general theory of religious education. 
All these courses, it is assumed, will be on the university level 
both with respect to standards of admission and of study, and 
with respect to standards of scientific thoroughness. The order 
in which the items are named is not intended to indicate any- 
thing as to the arrangement of a student’s program, but only 
certain relations between the department of education and the 
theological school. The relation here suggested between the va- 
rious courses is that of close intertwining, or even of something 
still more intimate. They are all related to one another as are 
the organs of the human body when it lives and breathes. We 
have here no mechanical juxtaposition of pieces of knowledge, 
but the unity of a single purpose realizing itself in a complex 
world. In the light of this purpose, it would be incorrect to 
think of the courses in the department of education as funda- 
mental, while those in the school of theology are accessory. 
The courses in religious education, and in the study of religion, 
not only make a direct attack upon data that are unconsidered 
in the department of education (note, for example, b, d, and h), 
but the practical methods in religious education, being con- 
trolled by the all-pervasive aim of promoting religious growth, 
do not merely apply what has been learned in day-school experi- 
ence. The impossibility, too, of ranking religious education as 
a particular under a general conception of education that makes 
no analysis of the religious life might seem to be obvious enough. 
In addition, the theory of religious education tends, on the whole, 
to be more inclusive than educational philosophy that lives in 
constant contact with the restrictions of state education. 
From all this it will appear that the whole curriculum for the 
advance of learning and for the preparation of the highest ex- 
perts in religious education must be lifted above denomina- 
tionalism. Our task is never that of making merely denomina- 
tional applications of non-religious educational theories and 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  292 BEYOND THE DENOMINATIONS 
methods. We must carry the unsectarianism of science into 
our analysis of what is specifically religious. Psychology, 
sociology, and experiment must speak in their own tongue with 
respect to the most intimate things in religious experience, often 
with respect to matters upon which denominations are sensitive. 
If a denomination chooses to maintain a theological school in 
which these things are promoted with hearty unreserve, this de- 
nomination proves thereby that it is passing into the larger 
society; it is losing its life and gaining life.

CHAPTER XX 
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC TYPE 
The purpose, scope, and spirit of Part V require a word of 
advance explanation. The purpose is to set in high relief the 
theory that has already been expounded. In accordance with 
the principle, expressed at the beginning of the first chapter, 
that theory arises within practice and is continuous with it, 
I intend to show that the new educational point of view is, as 
a matter of fact, arising within the churches. Like other new 
inspirations, it has to struggle for utterance, oppose traditions, 
and be opposed. It has to be refined in the furnace of experience 
before it fully reveals its own nature. Into the ecclesiastical 
furnace, then, let us take a look, seeking there for facts that 
illustrate, either by similarity or by contrast, tendencies toward 
a social view of religious education. 
Some differences between Christian bodies will have to be 
mentioned, and in some instances discrimination will have to 
be made between tendencies that co-exist in the same body. 
But no general survey of denominational types or tendencies 
will be offered, nor will our evaluation of a particular educa- 
tional thread constitute a judgment upon any church as a whole. 
Indeed, the spirit of this analysis is not that of seeking to give 
or to withhold credit, but rather that of seeing facts simply as 
facts. Of course I shall make no concealment or even pretense 
of reticence as to my own attitudes; in view of what precedes, 
any such attempt, even if there were a motive for it, would be 
futile. But I trust that to be possessed of a conviction will 
not debar either author or reader from the recognition of facts 
or of typical tendencies within facts.

Presuppositions of Roman Catholic education. No Chris- 
tian body is more insistent upon education as a primary func- 
tion of the church, and no one has proved the depth of its educa- 
tional convictions by greater sacrifice, than the Catholic Church 
in the United States. No other church holds with such una- 
nimity a definite, logically articulated theory of religious educa- 
tion, nor exhibits greater consistency in practice. This utter 
coherence is due primarily to a firm grasp by the entire hier- 
archy upon certain presuppositions. They may be conveniently 
expressed as follows: 
(1) Education is the transmission of a completed faith, not 
participation in the evolution of a faith. In Catholic education 
changes in method may occur within limits presently to be in- 
dicated, but the purpose and the content are assumed to be 
fixed and uniform for the whole world to the end of time. Rep- 
etition, reproduction, prevention of change within the scope 
of religion—this rather than experiment, new enterprise, or dis- 
covery, is the spirit. 
(2) The basal process in this transmission is intellectualistic. 
The term “intellectualistic”’ is here used because dogma is made 
to precede and govern life. The processes of intelligence are 
not employed primarily for defining an experience or a purpose 
that the pupil already has or is in process of forming, but for 
defining something entirely antecedent to such experience and 
purpose, and intended as a control thereof. Archbishop Ire- 
land puts the matter thus: “ Nor is mere intellectual instruction 
sufficient for the religious education of the child. Intellectual 
instruction is necessary; wz is the fount from which all else will 
flow. But the child must be led as by the hand to put into daily 
practice the truths with which its mind has been saturated.” ! 
How intellectualistic this notion of a preliminary mental sat- 
uration is we shall see vividly when we examine the methods 
employed for accomplishing it. 
(3) Both dogma and rules of conduct are to be imposed upon 
the pupil by authority. This authority, moreover, 1s lodged in

living men who announce and administer penalties for non- 
conformity.! Authority as teacher, authority to command what 
is to be believed and done, descends in orderly gradation from 
the Pope to every priest. There is always a living voice 
that can declare the end of the matter in everything that 
concerns faith and morals.? This authority is not limited to 
the declaration of general principles, but it goes on to hearing 
confessions, imposing penance, and granting or withholding 
absolution; to permitting or forbidding participation in sa- 
cred rites held to have the greatest potency; finally, to con- 
trol of the keys of eternal life. Whatever the method of teach- 
ing employed, then, however gentle, however free from painful 
restrictions, round about the whole are the adamantine walls 
of psychic compulsion. Within these walls whatever is said 
and done has within it the implication, the atmosphere, of 
a government that is in no sense responsible to the gov- 
erned. 
Much Protestant education, too, has attempted to impose 
the Christian faith by authority, but with an educationally 
important difference. When authority is lodged in the Bible 
rather than in a living teacher, variant interpretations of the 
authority itself are possible. The Bible is powerless to prevent 
them, or to punish, even so much as by a threat of withdrawing 
spiritual privileges, any person who falls into error. Conse- 
quently, Protestant teachers, all in all, instead of wielding power, 
use persuasion, or seek a rational and essentially free assent. 
As a rule, children know that inside the velvet glove there are 
no fingers of steel. 
Within Protestantism, consequently, there is more unreserved 
i“Tf.. . by ‘independence of mind’ is understood unrestrained liberty 
of thought in religious matters, it must be admitted that the Ratio Studiorum 
and the whole Institute of the Society [of Jesus] are uncompromisingly op- 
posed to it, and that the Jesuits always endeavored to suppress it. For they 
are bound by their profession, and fully determined to uphold, defend, and 
propagate revealed religion, as taught and interpreted by the Catholic Church. 
In this they do not differ from other religious orders, nor from any consistent 
Catholics.’’ Article, ‘‘Jesuits'’ by R. Swickerath in Monroe’s Cyclopedia of 
Education.

morals at all.

lodgment for the educational doctrine of interest, and there is 
readier assent to conforming material as well as method to needs 
that appear in the pupil’s own experience. The position of 
Catholicism is that the child must be conformed to the material 
and to the teacher who officially transmits it. “The position 
which the director holds in the Sunday school is supreme. 
- He is the prime mover in everything. All that is done is in- 
augurated by him. He is the ‘forma totius gregis.’ The whole 
machinery is guided by his touch, or rather, the entire mecha- 
nism is in a manner of his creation. He is not only the rudder, 
but his at the same time is the firm hand thereon.”! “As to 
the director, and this is as it should be, a step cannot be taken 
in any path without confronting him. The children, to use 
the scholastic phrase, are the prime matter; the director and 
the teacher the substantial form which gives the Sunday school 
its individual existence.’’? 
Such a Sunday school, considered as a society, is an autoc- 
racy, a benevolent one no doubt, but yet an autocracy, and 
by this primarily must its capacity for social education be 
determined. It is the purpose of Catholic education, the very 
kernel of it, to perpetuate and make universal an autocratic 
government of religious and ethical thinking and of religious 
and moral conduct. That this is the very antipodes of the 
aspiration for a democracy of God is obvious enough. And the 
opposition does not cease at any supposed boundary between the 
spiritual and the temporal. Such boundaries are mere conven- 
tions; the facts show no such separation. For no laws of spiri- 
tual life are clearer than the interconnectedness of soul and 
body, the continuity of the ethical with the political, the suffoca- 
tion of the higher life by economic injustice. Moreover, even 
if the existence of these spiritual laws should be denied, the fact 
would remain that autocratic authority over matters of faith 
and morals includes the authority to determine autocratically 
what constitutes a matter of morals. In short, Catholic educa-

   tion not only cannot be education for democracy; it cannot fail 
to educate against democracy. 
The particular aims of Roman Catholic education. The 
characteristic aims follow so directly from the presuppositions 
that little more than an enumeration is necessary. 
(1) To fix in the mind of the child church doctrine and tradition. 
“The modern Sunday school, they say, was originated in 1781 
by Robert Raikes. That is, of course, the Protestant Sunday 
school. Non-Catholics have imposed the name on us all, yet 
the difference between their work and ours is exceedingly great. 
Our Sunday schools should be called catechism schools or 
classes. We teach catechism. They teach, or explain, or— 
God knows what—the Bible. Their Sunday school is a Bible 
class. Ours is a catechism class. ... The Bible holds a 
place in our schools, but not that which belongs to the cate- 
chism.”’! 
(2) To produce observance of particular rules with respect to 
religious devotions and with respect to conduct. Children are told 
just what to do in church and elsewhere, and they are minutely 
drilled in doing it. They are not left with general principles or 
ideals, the applications of which they must work out by their 
own thought and experiment, but with rules that specify the 
very thing that is to be done or avoided, and with the habit 
of doing it already formed. Thus it is that the Church seeks 
to perpetuate itself unchanged. 
(3) To fix the spirit and habit of full, unquestioning obedience to 
the Church. In view of what has been said of the autocratic 
character of Catholic education, it will be sufficient at this point 
merely to indicate that the subjects of autocratic rule can be, 
and are, trained to believe in, obey, and support it with unwaver- 
ing conviction. How to produce such obedience was one of the 
great and successfully solved problems of the founders of 
Jesuit education. Loyola the soldier did not abandon militarism 
when he turned from war to the Church; he merely transferred 
the sphere of his militarism to the human spirit. In the Society 
of Jesus he raised an army of perfectly regimented minds. They, 
1 Halpin, p. 2.
-P-A-G-E-312
  300 CATHOLICISM 
in turn, have found in teaching their supreme opportunity for 
producing a like regimented Church. 
The fundamentals of method in Roman Catholic education. 
It is not by any subtle trick, or ingenious device, or mysterious 
influence that Catholicism secures these results, but by the per- 
sistent and organized use of simple and obvious methods. 
(1) Halbit-formation by drill processes 1s the pervading essence 
of the whole. The laws of habit, let it be remembered, apply 
to much more than overt acts. Attitudes as well as particular 
acts can become habits, and attitudes include shades of feeling. 
We can acquire an habitual interest in one thing, so that we 
notice it when it is present, and an habitual indifference to an- 
other, so that its presence goes unnoticed. We can acquire hard 
and fast associations of ideas, so that A always brings up P, 
which is agreeable, while B always recalls Q, which is disagree- 
able. In this way we can go on to form a habit of thinking thus 
or so of anything, and such an intellectual habit may become 
so firm that the habitual conclusion has the force of a self- 
evident presupposition. Conscience, taste, and in fact stand- 
ards of judgment in every sphere can become petrified as habits. 
A habit of self-limitation—or of submission to the will of an- 
other, can become so ingrained as to seem second nature. It 
is by the continuous use of this principle that Catholic educa- 
tion gets its results. It is a system of habit-formation. Let 
us, then, glance at two or three phases of the process. 
(2) Hence the great prominence of memory drill upon verbal 
formule. ‘The great propositions of the faith are not reserved 
1 Now and then the question is asked how the Roman priesthood is kept 
in intellectual subservience to the papacy. How came it to pass that modern- 
ism, for example, was so easily suppressed? Why were there not more martyrs 
to it, at least? Especially, what kept modernism from raising its head at all 
in this country, where freedom of thought is supposed to be breathed in the 
very atmosphere? How can educated men who have come into contact 
with modern historical and scientific knowledge remain so unaffected by it? 
What can induce them to abjure the right to think for themlseves? The 
major part of the answer is that the Catholic system of education is organized, 
from the infant class to the theological seminary, under the all-pervading 
aim of producing obedience as a permanent frame of mind. On the whole, 
the system secures what it seeks. It produces genuine obedience, not merely 
the pretense of it; actual conformity in thinking, not duplicity or self-division 
except now and then; submission so complete as to be practically painless.
-P-A-G-E-313
CATHOLICISM 301 
until the child has a religious experience that requires them for 
its expression; they are not reserved even until the child can 
understand them. A beginning of habituation and of con- 
formity is possible even in advance of understanding and of 
experience. “In the primary Sunday school grades, the main 
object is to indelibly fasten on the memory the truths of faith, 
and to impart such explanation as the young mind is capable 
of receiving. It might be said that it is mere surface work. 
The chief task lies in giving the child a memory grasp of Catholic 
doctrine. It is an all-important achievement. It is essential. 
One need not care, for the very young, how parrot-like may be 
their knowledge; a pervading familiarity with the text is the 
beginning of all after knowledge, and without it there is danger 
of inaccurately obtaining it, which is pernicious in the extreme, 
and which is worse than ignorance. It is better not to know 
in these momentous matters than to misstate.”! Since exact 
conformity is the end sought, the stress is never removed from 
the verbal forms in which the Church has clothed her teachings. 
That is, habit-formation, not independent judgment, remains 
the essence of the method to the very end. “Children, unless 
they know their catechism verbatim may be said to have no 
knowledge of it whatever. They have not laid that foundation 
without which any superstructure, durable or fair to look upon 
is, if not absolutely impossible, at least so difficult as to demand 
superhuman effort.” ? 
(3) Expression from the pupil takes the form of reproduction 
of what he has been told rather than that of “free self-expression.” 
If we desire free self-expression from the pupil, we place him 
in a situation that is likely to call forth a spontaneous reac- 
tion that is of worth, one that will help him to find himself, and 
then we let the reaction come—we do not prescribe it, require it, 
or even tell the pupil in advance what we hope for. Hence pu- 
pils’ opinions, likes and dislikes, approvals and disapprovals, 
become a part of the learning process. Or, if the situation 
presents a problem for solution, rather than an object to be 
appreciated, the pupils’ work will show doubts, guesses, tenta- 
1 Halpin, p. 19. 2 Ibid., 24.
-P-A-G-E-314
  302 CATHOLICISM 
tive inferences, very likely dissent from the teacher, but also 
the joy of discovering something for oneself. This brief and 
partial statement is sufficient to illustrate the methods of self- 
expression. Now, when we examine the work books of pupils 
from carefully managed Catholic Sunday schools, we find little 
of this, but much telling back of what the teacher or the text- 
book has told. The purpose, in fact, is not discovery, not train- 
ing the pupil to see for himself whether or not the truth is as 
it is said to be, not the solution of problems by the pupil. 
The Church has already solved his problems, and she now un- 
dertakes to transfer ready-made solutions to him. Hence the 
pressure of the school upon him is toward the most accurate 
possible reproduction of what he has been told.* 
(4) Gradation of material, in the proper sense of “ gradation” 
does not exist, but rather fuller and fuller treatment of the same 
outline, with some change from sensuous to logical modes of 
impression. Pupils are graded to the extent of being arranged 
in five, six, or eight age groups. The grouping is determined to 
some extent by the pupil’s changing relations to the Church, 
as his first communion and his confirmation. But for all ages 
the essential content of instruction is, as has been indicated 
already, the catechism. The catechism is the curriculum. It 
is, of course, not at all a transcript of a child’s spiritual growth, 
but a thought structure built by adults to meet certain strains 
felt by adults. Moreover, the order in which it is presented is 
not determined by freely picking out the parts that have the 
closest relation to experience at this or that age, for the main 
outline of the whole is presented at every age. One writer, 
after saying that during each year of his Sunday school life each 
child should study or review in regular succession “at least all 
the fundamental truths” of his religion, recommends that in 
all the grades the same topic be studied each Sunday, the dif- 
1 That this is characteristic even of higher classes is clear from Halpin’s 
description of a class in Higher Catechism. The same principle of method 
prevails in the specific training for the priesthood also. When we act upon 
the assumption that the function of reason is to confirm conclusions already 
held as final, we may, indeed, grow in logical nimbleness, but it is the nimble- 
ness of habitual co-ordinations that have merely extended their range and 
thereby solidified themselves.
-P-A-G-E-315
    CATHOLICISM 303 
ference between the grades being simply one of simplicity and 
extent of the material. This is called a “graded system,” 
whereas it is in fact a uniform system.! 
At first this abstract material is presented to a considerable 
extent as something to say in connection with a particular re- 
ligious act which the teacher takes pains to have the child per- 
form, or as a statement of the meaning of some sensible object 
connected with worship. Later the catechism meets the pupil 
as a system to be grasped as one interconnected whole. 
The early, and in fact never-ceasing association of dogmas 
with sensible objects and with particular acts of devotion 
is undoubtedly effective for the purpose for which it is used. 
The sense of reality that attaches to the impressive sights and 
sounds within the church, and to the acts that one does there, 
attaches also, under the laws of habit, to the formule that are 
used in connection therewith. What I and the other wor- 
shippers are doing, what the priest is doing, what the pictures, 
statues, and vestments signify—as far as I think of this at all 
(and the teacher sees to it that I do think of it) I think of it 
in the terms that are drilled into my mind by repetition. This 
is what it allis to me. To a considerable extent, even methods 
that are relatively external and mechanical have this result. 
But when spiritually minded teachers, by personal example, 
and by careful control of conditions, produce in their pupils 
the emotions of awe and of mystery, some real penitence, some 
real joy in forgiveness, some fear of penalty and some sense of 
security from it, and withal the comfortable realization that we 
know how to be safe in life and in death, then pupils tend to 
identify their very selves with the system that imposes itself 
upon them.

  CHAPTER XXI 
THE DOGMATIC PROTESTANT TYPE 
Within Protestantism various educational types coexist. 
It is not possible to speak of “the’’ Protestant type of religious 
education as we have done of the Catholic type. For not only 
are there many sorts of Protestantism, but within each Protes- 
tant body, at least within the larger bodies, variety, ferment, 
fresh experimentation are characteristic, and consequently at 
times the strain of conflicting convictions. Catholic education 
is a close-knit system; Protestant education is a conglomerate, 
several different types being found side by side, even within the 
same denomination. To speak of “the dogmatic Protestant 
type,” therefore, or of the other types that will engage our 
attention in the following chapters, is not to characterize any 
denomination by a single educational tendency. It will be 
necessary to draw examples from the practices or from the official 
utterances of this or that body, it is true, but the reader should 
bear in mind that in each instance a single item has been taken 
from a group of jostling tendencies. It should be noted, more- 
over, that such terms as “dogmatic,” “ritualistic,” “evangel- 
ical,” and “liberal” are intended to be descriptive only; they 
are not epithets that carry either approval or opprobrium. For 
the purpose is not to judge theologies or forms of ecclesiastical 
life as such, but only to understand the educational tendencies 
and affiliations that belong to them. 
Comparison of the dogmatic Protestant type of religious 
education with the Catholic type. Protestant education is 
dogmatic when it is controlled by these presuppositions: That 
there is a finite, historical organ that exercises divine authority 
upon earth; that this authority imposes upon men a change- 
less faith which it is the function of religious education to 
304 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  DOGMATISM 305 
transmit; and that education transmits it primarily in the form 
of certain propositions. That this educational point of view 
exists in large Protestant areas needs no argument, nor is the 
affinity with Catholicism at all obscure. 
(1) There is affinity with Catholic education to the extent that 
external authority 1s propagated by intellectualistic drill processes. 
As in Catholicism, so in much Protestantism, we find drill upon 
set formule, as of a catechism; the persistent use of doctrinal 
rather than descriptive terms for experience, both the experi- 
ences recorded in the Bible and those of present-day Christians; 
and a tendency, which will be exhibited in some detail in a 
subsequent section, to bend the curriculum as a whole to the 
outlines of a dogmatic system. If this were the end of the mat- 
ter, an educational appraisement of it would be easy. But 
Protestant dogmatism, even of the most rigorous sorts, includes 
in its doctrines certain views of the church, of the Bible, and of 
the religious life that involve decisive modifications. 
(2) But the Protestant abnegation of all claims to infallibility 
on the part of the church changes the relation between teacher and 
pupil from that of commanding and obeying to that of helping and 
being helped, which makes for democracy. The Protestant teacher, 
just because he is Protestant, obligates himself to regard the 
pupil’s interests and modes of mental assimilation. If Prot- 
estantism tends to prize unduly a winsome personality in a 
teacher, nevertheless the social tendency even of this is toward 
friendliness between equals. 
(3) The ascription of authority to the Bible rather than to the 
church turns attention to a literature that 1s predominantly a tran- 
script of life rather than a body of doctrine. Therefore Protestant 
emphasis upon Bible study tends to counteract Protestant dogma- 
tism. ‘The Catholic writer, quoted in the last chapter, who con- 
trasted the teaching of catechism with the teaching of the 
Bible, did not exaggerate the difference. The Bible is education- 
ally as different from catechisms as the affection of a mother 
toward her baby is different from the law of the state that for- 
bids a mother to let her offspring starve. And the more objec- 
tive our study of the Bible becomes, the more it gives the pupil
-P-A-G-E-318
306 DOGMATISM 
an impression of moving among men like himself. The desire 
of a teacher to make a passage interesting or vivid lures him 
toward precisely the features of it that the pupil can appre- 
ciate through his own experience and observation. It is true 
that dogmatism, phrasing in its own way whatever it touches, 
and insistent upon illustrating its own convictions by ancient 
life that was unconscious of them, tends constantly to depress 
the vitality of Bible study. But its insistence upon the Bible 
as the very word of God in due time reacts in the interest of life. 
(4) The intellectualism of dogmatic teaching is further modified 
by efforts to induce a personal religious experience. The most 
dogmatic Protestant teaching, in the same breath in which it 
assumes that certain beliefs are essential to the Christian life, 
warns the pupil that he can be spiritually dead even though 
his beliefs are perfectly correct. The Catholic child is taught 
that he can be saved by conformity; the Protestant child is 
told the exact contrary. The Catholic child is told that God 
is present in the mass; the Protestant child is told that God’s 
presence is to be discerned in the heart. We shall presently dis- 
cover that dogmatic Protestantism is restrained from reaping the 
whole educational advantage of its belief in Christian experience. 
But we can see at once that to teach the pupil to establish a 
direct relation between himself and God, a relation the nature 
of which the pupil himself judges, is to turn attention once 
more away from dogma and authority toward life that can easily 
take a democratic form. 
Protestant dogmatism cannot accept whole-heartedly the 
principle of gradation of the material of instruction. We 
have seen that Catholic education repeats the main outlines of 
Catholic dogma from department to department of the Sunday 
school. This is necessary because the end to be attained is 
utter habituation of the mind. Protestant dogmatism tends 
in the same direction, but for the reasons that have just been 
given, is not so thoroughgoing. Here is the meaning of the half- 
acceptance, half-rejection of graded lessons by certain Protes- 
tant bodies. The fundamental idea of gradation is that the 
pupil is to grow from within; dogmatism desires the pupil to 
     
-P-A-G-E-319
  DOGMATISM 307 
conform increasingly to something that is without. Growth from 
within presupposes freedom, and it invites variation. To pro- 
vide for growth is to furnish changing sorts of food as capacity 
for assimilation changes; it is to feed spontaneous interests 
as they arise. Habit-formation is involved here, of course, but 
also the free variation toward which dogmatism is necessarily 
apprehensive. True gradation of material aims to call into 
play whatever capacity for judgment and discovery the pupil 
has, and by exercising this capacity at its various levels of 
growth to bring it finally to maturity. Whole-hearted dogma- 
tism like that of the Catholic Church will have none of this; 
the modified dogmatism of some Protestants fears and opposes 
it, but from no defined or definable educational standpoint that 
can satisfy the other demands of Protestantism even of the 
dogmatic type.! 
No official body has been at greater pains to state the issues 
here involved than certain committees that reported to the Gen- 
eral Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States 
of America, in 1913. Let us ask, then, what conceptions of 
education are here expressed or implied, first premising on our 
own part that our quest is not to determine the educational 
status of an ecclesiastical body, but solely to understand educa- 
1The Sunday-School Committee of the General Synod of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in the United States of America, in a report made in 1913 
criticises ‘‘the forced pedagogical theory that the child itself is the centre 
around which the teaching of the Bible must adjust itself at no matter what 
sacrifice of truth. We strongly advocate a system of graded lessons,”’ the 
report continues, ‘‘but the whole spirit and the doctrinal position of our 
Church is against a system of grading which seeks merely to interest the child 
by fanciful and far-fetched interpretations of Scripture, by attempting to catch 
the child by making the stories of the Bible simple myths, by extra-biblical 
lessons from nature, from life, from history. ... We are persuaded that in 
the Church, as in the family, strong Christian men and women are made of 
the children, not by giving them always what they want and what will enter- 
tain them, but what they need.’’ See Proceedings of the General Synod, 1913, 
pp. 114-117. The real issues here involved would have been far more sharply 
drawn if the report had been a little more accurate and a little more thorough 
in its contrast between the theory that ‘‘the child itself is the centre” and the 
theory that children are best educated by ‘‘giving them what they need.”’ 
What we have here is first, a misleading caricature of the doctrine of interest, 
with no recognition of any truth at all in it, and second, an ambiguous ref- 
erence to what children need. If the ambiguity were cleared up, ‘‘ what the 
children need’’ would turn out to be, of course, some adult point of view 
to which the children are expected to conform.
-P-A-G-E-320
  308 DOGMATISM 
tional tendencies that are inherent in a certain type of Prot- 
estant thought and practice. First, then, we find approval 
of graded lessons. The Standing Committee on the Board of 
Publication and Sabbath-School Work “heartily approves of 
the general plan of graded lessons for use in churches preferring 
them to the Uniform Series.”! But a conviction is expressed 
that “the present lesson helps in the graded system may be 
substantially improved,” and the following principles are offered 
for guidance in a proposed revision of certain parts and new 
publication in others: 
(1) Simplicity of expression and clearness of definition. (2) 
Complete harmony, in all exposition and definition, with the sys- 
tem of evangelical faith accepted by our Presbyterian Church; 
and especially with regard to the divine inspiration of the Scrip- 
tures as the supreme revelation of God, the deity of Jesus Christ 
as God in the flesh, coequal with the Father and coeternal, the in- 
herent sinfulness of human nature and the consequent need of a 
spiritual regeneration, and the atoning merit of Christ as a Saviour 
from sin. And, further, that in the use of extra-biblical lessons, the 
honor of the Scriptures be maintained in this way: Where so-called 
“nature studies” or “‘stories” are used in the earlier grades (be- 
ginners, primary and junior) they are to be used in connection 
with definite selections of Scripture, and then only in the form 
of pictures or emblems to illustrate moral or spiritual truths; 
and that in the use of biography or history, or ethics or social 
science, a definite portion of Scripture be used as a basis of the 
lesson, the biography or historical event or principle of ethics 
or of social science being used to illustrate the Word of God and 
confirm its fundamental teachings. 
The last clause is an almost exact reproduction of the scho- 
lastic conception of education. Each study is conceived of, 
not as an unforced exercise of intelligence and conscience upon a 
given piece of human experience, not as a means of developing 
judgment and power to discover, but as a means of illustrating 
1 Report presented to and approved by the General Assembly at Atlanta, 
May 21, 1913. 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  DOGMATISM 309 
and confirming certain fixed teachings—in this case certain in- 
terpretations of Scripture. 
The relation between “complete harmony” with the ac- 
cepted system of evangelical faith and the theory of gradation 
is revealed more distinctly in another report made to the same 
General Assembly by a Special Committee on Graded Lessons. 
We recommend the revision of the Beginners’, Primary, and 
Junior Lesson Helps so as to express with greater clearness the 
fundamental Scripture doctrines. ... (1) The Scriptures as an 
authoritative revelation from God. (2) The sinfulness of human 
nature and the need of regeneration. (3) The atonement offered 
by Jesus Christ. 
Here we have a perfectly explicit proposal to teach the in- 
dicated dogmas to children from four to twelve years of age. 
The child is to be bent to the material by a process of reiteration 
as in Catholic education. 
The committee goes on to express dissatisfaction with the 
view of religious growth that is stated in one of the books for 
teachers; the view, in a word, that the child’s spiritual life may 
be made continuous, so that conversion, as it is ordinarily 
understood, will not be necessary. Inasmuch as the committee 
intimates that this may occur under favorable conditions, though 
only through the regenerating work of the Spirit of God, we 
might expect the committee to indicate some possible conception 
of how the divine Spirit might use the educative process as a 
whole. Instead the committee desires to have incorporated in 
the “Forewords” and in the instructions to teachers “sugges- 
tions on the best methods of leading scholars to Christ.”” The 
tendency here manifested to add religious appeal to educative 
processes instead of making these processes themselves, all of 
them, religiously vital, is an inevitable corollary of the in- 
tellectualistic, because dogmatic, approach to the curriculum. 
When teaching is conceived primarily as instruction in dogmas, 
something has to be added, of course, in the interest of religious 
living. To this dualism in religious education it will be neces- 
sary to return in a later section.

  310 DOGMATISM 
The dogmatic Protestant type tends to separate religious 
life from religious instruction. We have just now touched 
upon an instance in which, after recommending that certain dog- 
mas be taught to children of four to twelve years, a committee 
advises also that the teachers be instructed in “the best methods 
of leading scholars to Christ.”” Here “coming to Christ” is 
treated as a thing by itself, and not involved in religious instruc- 
tion as such. This type of educational thinking goes on, more- 
over, to separate training in the duties of the Christian life 
from both instruction and coming to Christ. “Surely,” says 
the committee, “the prime object of the Sunday school is to 
lead the scholars to Christ the Saviour, and then to train them 
in the Christian life with its privileges and duties.” “And 
then”’ to train them in the practice of religion. The entire 
scheme includes, it now appears, three stages or parts: First, 
drill in the dogmas; Second, leading to Christ; Third, training 
in Christian living. Here we have simply one thing added to 
another—first beliefs that are not acts of consecration, then a 
kind of omnibus surrender to Christ, then Christian living in the 
world. 
In the background of this scheme is the fundamental assump- 
tion that knowledge or thought is a thing per se that is to be 
applied by the will, which is another thing per se. Moreover, 
the will is taken as a general or abstract entity apart from the 
particular desires and purposes that spring up in one’s experi- 
ence of human society. Hence the great choice of Christ, the 
major loyalty that is aimed at, is treated as an event or experi- 
ence by itself, and duties to one’s fellows as a distinct and sub- 
sequent thing. 
If these underlying assumptions of dogmatic religious educa- 
tion are mistaken; if thought itself is a phase of active adjust- 
ment to the conditions of life, so that religious beliefs held ante- 
cedently to religious living are only pseudo-thinking; if, further, 
the will comes to itself in and through particular social inter- 
actions, not antecedently thereto, then, if we are to have a vital 
and organically unified religious education, we must begin with 
the formation of a social will through the performance of par-
-P-A-G-E-323
  DOGMATISM 311 
ticular social acts out of which may grow Christian social 
habits; we must go on to make these practices thinking reac- 
tions—a discriminative, foresighted, information-seeking Chris- 
tian faith; through practice of the lesser consecrations we must 
develop power for the larger ones, and through the experienced 
validity of the Christian purpose in social action, we must reach 
the heights and the depths of Christian belief. Leading pupils 
to Christ will then no longer be separated from, but fused with, 
leading them into Christlike social living. Thus the pupil’s 
social experience under the leadership of Christ will be no “and 
then,” no department of religious education, but the very lungs 
with which religious nurture draws in the breath of its life. 
Social tendencies of the dogmatic Protestant type of 
religious education. Any complete inventory of the social 
tendencies of the type of religious education that has now been 
described would have to include a survey of the social content 
of the systems of doctrine that are in control in various de- 
nominations or Sunday schools. What level of sociality is 
reflected in the idea of God that is taught to the children? 
In the conception of sin? In the notion of the kingdom of God? 
In the particular duties that are inculcated? In the standards 
of church life? Obviously such a survey is impossible in this 
place. The most that can be done is to analyze social tendencies 
that are inherent in the dogmatic point of view as it is held in 
common by various sorts of Protestants, and in practices that 
are common. 
(1) Teaching the child that he stands in direct relations to God, 
that is, relations not necessarily mediated by priest or by church, 
tends to liberate the mind from all tyrannies, spiritual and political. 
This teaching as to the accessibility of God is, of course, not dis- 
tinctive of any single type of Protestantism; it is a common 
Protestant conviction. It is mentioned here in connection with 
the dogmatic type of Protestantism because, as a matter of 
fact, dogmatism here limits itself, actually renounces the ab- 
solutism, which in practice is the autocratic rule, that character- 
izes Catholic education. When we tell a child that he can carry 
everything in his own way directly to a God who will fully under- 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
  312 DOGMATISM 
stand, we invite a human being to think of everything from the 
divine point of view that develops in his own mind as he prays. 
From the judgments that thus arise the church and its dogmas 
have no ultimate immunity. To peoples and classes that have 
been touched by this Protestant teaching, God is a refuge and 
strength against all oppression. The struggle for liberty, re- 
ligious, political, or economic, is sanctified; it becomes, not the 
impiety of mere revolt against social order, not the letting loose 
of class hatred, but a solemn consecration to the eternal purpose 
of the world. The possibilities that lie open in this direction 
are, however, seriously limited by other parts of the dogmatic 
scheme. 
(2) But the lack of social deliberation tends to isolate the in- 
dividual, and to open the way for individualistic conceptions of 
duty. The dogmatic type of education causes the pupil to be- 
come orthodox by a process of habituation, not by the give-and- 
take of a group of inquiring minds. Real deliberation of a social 
sort upon doctrine was finished in some council of long ago. ‘The 
individual of to-day can make his complete response to instruc- 
tion, can become and remain orthodox, without a single act of 
co-operation with anybody. 
This tendency to isolation does not stop with beliefs. For 
dogmatism teaches duties also by authority, either the authority 
of a command that is supposed to have been directly revealed, 
or that of an inference drawn from an authoritative doctrine. 
The result is a set of rules or of sentiments where there should 
be training in the analysis of social relations and in co-operative 
work for improving them. One can hold the rule or feel the 
sentiment in isolation. Hence, in part, the amount of non- 
cohesive, non-co-operative, socially ineffective goodness among 
church members. 
Nor is this the end of the matter. In the absence of social 
deliberation upon the meaning and the ends of life, there is 
no adequate check to self-deception with respect to the issues 
involved ia our social conflicts and in our social aspirations. 
Many a man who is devotedly religious is stiff-necked in social 
relations simply because in early life he was taught rules when
-P-A-G-E-325
DOGMATISM 313 
he should have learned the lesson of conferring with one’s fel- 
lows whenever their interests are involved. Christians of this 
sort are accustomed to stand upon their rights, that is, upon 
precedents that give them some individualistic advantage; 
therefore such Christians let social wrongs also follow precedent. 
It is not uncommon—s it not in the natural order of things ?— 
for stiff economic and political conservatism to be united in 
the same person with intense dogmatic religion, and to find sup- 
port therein. 
(3) To make the Bible the practically exclusive source of ma- 
terial is to keep the attention of pupils fixed upon predemocratic 
social conditions. Through the material of the curriculum we 
lead the pupil to notice and appreciate standards of human 
goodness, and to think of these standards as the will of God. 
If, now, the curriculum takes its instances of goodness from 
tribal relations, and from life under monarchical nationalism; 
if the virtues of the warrior are often to the fore, while the vir- 
tues of a free citizenship have not as yet even dawned upon the 
horizon of the good man’s hopes; if loving-kindness must still 
express itself almost exclusively in the narrower personal re- 
lations and in relief, while causes of wide-spread woe remain un- 
guessed and unsought for; if social justice, though hot against 
those who profit by the exploitation of human beings, sees no 
way to endow the exploited with civil authority to control the 
conditions of the common life; if the democratic spirit, as far 
as it is present at all in individuals, finds no way to organize 
itself politically, or even to conceive of a civil state through 
which it could utter itself—if the curriculum has such a limited 
outlook upon Christian character, how can it present, without 
stammering and without ambiguity, the fully Christian ideals 
of a democracy of God? 
It is true that even the crude social conditions of early He- 
brew history and legend yield nuggets of gold for the religious 
teacher. Nothing, perhaps, more effectively assists in the 
analysis of certain simple relations between individuals, and of 
certain relations within the family, than some of the Old Testa- 
ment stories. There is, moreover, no absolute break between
-P-A-G-E-326
  314 DOGMATISM 
the virtues of a hospitable sheik, or those of a generous-hearted 
mountain chieftain, and the virtues of a citizen when he votes 
to tax himself for the improvement of the public schools. 
Nevertheless there are two unescapable limitations upon the 
Old Testament as curriculum material for the development of 
intelligent Christian purpose: 
(a) The characters and the incidents of the Old Testament 
that can be used to advantage have to be selected out of a mass 
that contains, because of the level of the whole, much unusable 
material. Even in circles that are controlled by the doctrine 
that every word of the Bible is infallible divine revelation, such 
selection has already gone far. There is discreet hesitation to 
take upon Christian lips many a word and sentiment that are 
said to be the word and the sentiment of God. There is a 
tacit understanding that tender minds shall be shielded from 
much of the moral crudity from which Yahweh is not repre- 
sented as shrinking at all. But the selection must be much more 
rigorous than it is at present if the formation of really Christian 
standards of life and really Christian conceptions of God is to 
be our dominating purpose. 
(6) Even the Old Testament worthies with whom we are 
glad to have the children keep company, will have to be used 
negatively, as well as positively, that is, to point what is not 
Christian as well as what is. So will their notions of Yahweh 
illuminate the character of God by contrast. Their virtues and 
their faith in God both reflect the social assumptions of their 
time. It is by measuring these men by the standards of their 
time, in fact, that we learn how great they were. When we 
idealize them as though they were true Christians we gain noth- 
ing, and we lose an opportunity for making Christian standards 
clear by contrast with these earlier and lower levels of society. 
It is necessary to be on our guard lest pre-Christian conceptions 
of God become a part of a child’s faith when he listens to the 
beautiful Old Testament stories. In fact, only in the greatest 
utterances of the greatest of the prophets do we find the dis- 
tinctively Christian consciousness of God emerging. 
The spirit of Jesus, in short, is the social standard by which
-P-A-G-E-327
DOGMATISM 315 
everything else in the Bible is to be weighed and measured. The 
spirit of Jesus. Here a distinction is necessary with respect 
to the educational use of the New Testament. Jesus, too, died 
without having witnessed a single instance of political enfran- 
chisement in the democratic sense. Apparently he did not 
foresee the possibility that brotherhood should achieve a non- 
paternalistic expression in the civil state. We look to him in 
vain for political wisdom—that is, guidance with respect to 
how to organize the good will in an effective social order. So 
obvious is this that our leaders have many times warned us that 
Jesus was not a teacher of economics or of politics or of sociology, 
just as they have warned us also that following Jesus is not the 
same as imitating him, as with respect to celibacy, for example. 
The social leadership of Jesus resides in his spirit of social good 
will, his simple appreciation of every one as a neighbor, his trust 
that God, who is love, will not let us go until we have become a 
brotherhood. Here brotherly love is all one with faith and hope. 
The most daring and the most unflinching social teaching will 
never cease to look back to Jesus. But if it sees Jesus it will 
look, with him, to the future. It will breathe his spirit, but it 
will not stop with his words. “I have yet many things to say 
unto you,” the Fourth Gospel reports him as saying, “but ye 
cannot bear them now.” ‘The spirit of Jesus is so forward- 
looking, so creative, so inexhaustible that the Bible cannot 
possibly be a sufficient text-book of Christian living. To tie 
religious education down to it, as dogmatism desires to do, 
would make us like those who are ever learning but never able 
to come to the truth—ever learning to love, but ever permitting 
the social order to defeat love.

CHAPTER XXII | 
THE RITUALISTIC PROTESTANT TYPE 
Fundamental characteristics of the type. By the ritualistic 
type of Christian education is meant that which lays particular 
emphasis upon the pupil’s relation to the church as a society 
that worships by prescribed forms. Though this characteriza- 
tion lacks the precision of an exact boundary-line, and though 
it does not suffice to describe the whole educational life of any 
Christian body, it does, nevertheless, identify a particular ten- 
dency that exists in various bodies. In the Protestant Epis- 
copal Church, to take the most obvious example, we find relig- 
ious education conditioned fundamentally by the fact that every 
baptized infant is, by virtue of his baptism, a member of the 
church. It follows as a matter of course that the aim of relig- 
ious nurture is to help the child to realize increasingly the mean- 
ing of this already existing relation, and to perform more and 
more the acts that it entails, until the full stature of a churchman 
is reached. The meaning of the whole is set forth briefly in 
the creed, and it is expanded in the catechism. The acts are 
predominantly those of worship as it is prescribed in the prayer- 
book. Acts of churchmanship broaden out, of course, into 
ecclesiastical enterprises like missions, and the part of the creed 
that refers to the church expands into an interpretation of 
ecclesiastical history. Here, then, are two currents that flow 
side by side—training in a definite set of religious acts, and 
instruction in a definite set of beliefs. Rather, here are two 
phases of a single process for leading the pupil into greater and 
greater participation in a religious fellowship. For doctrine 
is presented specifically as church doctrine, not as a reasoned 
philosophy, not even as exegesis of the Bible. 
316
-P-A-G-E-329
    RITUALISM 317 
Let us call these two phases of churchmanship doctrine and 
worship. Each is susceptible of variant interpretations that 
lead to variations in educational practice. Thus, on the side 
of doctrine there may be a close approach to the dogmatic type 
of religious teaching, or there may be wide divergence from it. 
Teaching of catechism that insists upon the literal truth of 
traditional doctrines moves toward dogmatism; but when 
doctrines are treated as symbols of the church fellowship, or as 
mental pictures that assist in producing a devotional frame of 
mind, the movement is away from the dogmatic type. All in 
all, the ritualistic type tends to exalt the organic life or fellow- 
ship of the church, and for this reason great latitude with re- 
spect to theological thought becomes natural. Therefore the 
educational tendency that we are now considering takes far 
less concern for the orthodoxy of the pupil than for his religious 
practices. 
On the side of worship the variations range all the way from 
the mass, an act wrought by the priest for the people, to the 
cultivation of the evangelical type of conversion, in which the 
individual realizes God without priestly intervention. The 
church as teacher, accordingly, may take the attitude of an 
authority that requires conformity because it is the official 
agent of God upon earth, or that of a group of friends who would 
share their treasures with children, or it may take an interme- 
diate position like that of the family, a group with common in- 
terests that are pursued in common, a group that educates pre- 
cisely by the community of the younger and the older members. 
Some educational advantages of the ritualistic point of 
view. (1) The church and its services offer material of instruc- 
tion that the pupil can experience as present and concrete. The 
church building and its furniture, to begin with, meet the pupil 
as a visible expression of religion. Here is the font at which he 
was baptized, for example. It becomes, in due time, a means of 
teaching him that he is a member of the church and a child of 
God. Here is the sanctuary that contains the cup out of which 
he will drink at his first communion; here is where the bishop 
will sit when he comes to confirm you. So with a large number 
   
-P-A-G-E-330
  318 RITUALISM 
of objects. In this way the church building and its furniture 
can be used also for introducing some analysis of the parts of 
the morning and the evening service. The prayer-book itself 
then becomes another piece of concrete material, interesting, if 
for no other reason, because it is associated with pew and kneel- 
ing-stool and chancel, but interesting also because it now be- 
comes a guide to things that are to be done by the child himself. 
Next comes the use of the Christian festivals—the Christian 
year—as concrete teaching material. The day schools have 
only begun to realize the educational possibilities of our na- 
tional festivals, but the Christian festivals have been effectively 
used for centuries as a method of popular instruction in Scrip- 
ture story and church doctrine. 
(2) Small children are fond of action and of repetition. When 
to the sensuous impressiveness of a churchly interior, music, 
vestments, processional, and responsive actions of priest, choir, 
and congregation, we add opportunity to take an active part in 
the whole, important conditions of a child’s interest are met. 
This is true even if the part be nothing more than standing or 
kneeling or saying “ Amen”’ at the right point. Here are pray- 
ers to be committed to memory because they are to be used. 
One must learn to find the place in the prayer-book because it 
too is to be used. Repetition also fits in with children’s spon- 
taneous ways. Children are sometimes said to be little ritual- 
ists by nature. They want the favorite story told again and 
again, and they prefer to have it unchanged.t They enjoy 
repeating nonsense rhymes. ‘They invent and hand down from 
one generation of children to another essentially ritualistic ways 
of conducting parts of their plays, as “counting out.” They 
devise secret symbols and artificial languages to be used among 
themselves. They like to repeat the same evening prayer, 
and to turn it into a singsong. The explanation of this fond- 
ness for ritualism is to be found chiefly in the fact that the re- 
currence of a familiar thing to which one has been able to make 
1I was once telling to two children, aged respectively three and five, a story 
that they had already heard, when I inadvertently changed the word ‘“‘kind”’ 
to “good.” Instantly the younger child interposed “kind’’ with some 
vehemence, and the five-year old seconded the amendment vociferously.
-P-A-G-E-331
  RITUALISM 319 
adjustment in the past produces a sense of being equal to the 
occasion. In a small child’s world there are so many things 
that are uncontrollable and unpredictable, so many confusing 
situations, that there is positive satisfaction when he can know 
“just what comes next.”’ To master a religious ritual, conse- 
quently, brings satisfaction even regardless of the particular 
significance of the content. 
(3) Many adolescents welcome symbols for longings that they 
are not as yet able to understand. When adolescence approaches, 
one may react from that which is familiar and ordinary, desir- 
ing something different and fresh. But now an entirely con- 
trary tendency is likely to set in, a tendency which, though it is 
the opposite of childhood’s liking for the familiar, nevertheless 
reinforces the influence of the ritual. For adolescence not 
seldom brings idealistic longings that crave expression though 
they cannot as yet define themselves. Symbols offer one mode 
of expression, especially symbols that are stately and sounding, 
but not too literal. What is ancient, somewhat apart from the 
common day, to be used in common but not to be too familiarly 
talked about—this offers, so to say, a large and dimly lighted 
room in which the adolescent self can walk forth with other 
souls without being too closely interrogated as to who or what 
it is. 
(4) The assumption that the pupil is already a member of an 
amportant group that includes adults can be used as an incentive 
to study and to social growth. Under ritualistic presuppositions 
the pupil will not be treated as a mere individual, or merely as 
one of the social class “children.”” Teaching will rarely if ever 
consist exclusively in bringing together a child mind and a piece 
of abstract information. Interfused with every process and with 
every piece of material will be some relation that is to be ful- 
filled between the pupil and the group to which he belongs. A 
direct motive for fulfilling it will grow out of the fact that he 
belongs to the same society as the most dignified adult. The 
church is “our” church, the pastor is “my” pastor as much as 
anybody’s. The creed is what “we” believe much more than it 
is what “I” believe. If this did nothing more for a child than 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
  320 RITUALISM 
give him some little sense of his own dignity, or produce a little 
genuine reverence, it would be worth while. But it can be 
used by the teacher as an interesting approach to various parts 
of the subject-matter. Just as the expectation of going on a 
journey next week through a given part of the country makes 
the geography of it all alive to a child, so the prospect of hav- 
ing a new part with grown-ups in their enterprises makes the 
enterprises themselves significant, even enables a child to feel 
motives that might have had no other entrance into his feelings. 
But more than this; the teacher can use the child’s social con- 
nection with adults in the church as specific material for the 
teaching of social relations and for the development of partic- 
ular social habits. Much of the peculiar power of the family 
in social education might conceivably be achieved by a warm 
and well organized church fellowship. 
Some pitfalls of ritualistic education. We have seen that 
ritualistic tendencies in education have two phases, teaching of 
creed and catechism, and training in worship. In both direc- 
tions dangers appear. 
(1) When the meaning of the church fellowship is found in an 
ancient symbol instead of in a common, forward-looking purpose, 
there 1s danger that instruction will be either dogmatic, or else 
of the shallow, memoriter sort. Before me lies A Fundamental 
Catechism,‘ intended for children from six to twelve years of age, 
which has precisely the marks, already stated in earlier chapters, 
of the dogmatic type of teaching. Here is what purports to be 
knowledge, but it is pseudo-knowledge as far as it enters at all 
into the minds of children of six to twelve years. “How did 
God make all things? Ans. God first thought about making 
things, and then willed to make them, and then he made them. 
What do we call making things out of nothing? Ans. 
Making things out of nothing we call creating.”? Again, there 
is the dogmatic inability to accept the principle of gradation of 
material, the same dogmatic formule being offered for children 
all the way from six years to twelve. Finally, there is the 
characteristic dogmatic insistence upon particular words. ‘The 
1 By W. H. Oberly. Published by Thomas Whittaker, New York, 1908. 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  RITUALISM 321 
teacher should see that the lessons are learned according to the 
exact words.” ‘That is, instead of using words because one has 
something to say, the child employs them in such a way as to 
produce a verbal mental habit that prevents thinking. 
One might go on to ask: What in general is understood by 
“learning” the Ten Commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, and 
the Apostles’ Creed in any of our churches? What is the educa- 
tional significance of finding a class of catechumens letter-per- 
fect in them all? How much does it assure in the way of 
an intelligent Christian purpose held in common? In short, 
under dogmatic and ritualistic auspices alike the very form of 
catechetical instruction and its intellectualistic presuppositions 
prove to be inadequate for Christian education that has as its 
dominating motive the inculcation of a forward-looking, world- 
transforming social purpose. Without doubt the incorporation 
of the missionary interest into church education is enlarging the 
mental horizon and stimulating the social will. But the rela- 
tion between missions and the ancient creeds is rather tenuous 
at the best, so that the tendency is to add giving to catechizing 
rather than to regenerate the catechizing itself. Moreover, as 
long as the exposition of the Christian faith retains the dogmatic 
form, the missionary purpose itself will lack social breadth, 
missions themselves being a measure for propagating the cate- 
chism, and for getting men into churches as sectarian as ours 
at the home base. 
(2) Training a child in prescribed, indefinitely repeated acts 
of worship as the main constituent of churchmanship provides for 
the perpetuation of the church as a particular society in the com- 
munity and the world, but not for the reconstruction of the com- 
munity or of the world. In non-ritualistic circles the training of 
children in precise forms of worship is looked upon with con- 
siderable distrust. What is desired, it is said, is inner life, 
not outward ceremony, however seemly. There is fear that 
the ceremony, being punctiliously insisted upon, will be sub-. 
stituted for the states of heart and will that it is supposed to. 
express. Ritualistic education can easily reply that the chil-. 
dren under its care show at least as convincing signs of rever- 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  322 RITUALISM 
ence and of real appreciation of the content of church worship 
as children otherwise trained. Moreover, psychology is likely 
to be called as an expert witness to the truth that outward “ex- 
pression of the emotions” may actually help to produce the 
emotions themselves. Finally, it may be said that the com- 
mon worship of every organized communion sooner or later 
takes on definite, characteristic forms, to which children, as a 
matter of fact, become habituated, so that the real issue is not 
that of inner life versus outer form. We have to choose, rather, 
between different sorts of inner life, and between different sorts 
of outer form. 
Neither the pro nor the con in this debate reaches quite to 
the bottom of the problem of social education in and through 
the churches. A ritual has direct social significance. For a 
liturgy does not merely relate the worshipper to some particular 
idea, or merely remind him of God. Even when it does these 
things ineffectively it nevertheless relates the worshipper to 
other worshippers, binding them all together in a common social 
consciousness. It does this, not only or chiefly by bringing 
them together within four walls, but by causing them to do and 
to say many things in unison. ‘There are fraternities, like the 
Freemasons, that appear to maintain their existence chiefly 
by the unifying power of a ritual. There is no room for doubt 
that training in ritual worship is an effective method for produc- 
ing in children a genuine group consciousness, each child being 
carried beyond self-regard and self-will by each common act. 
Of social training, as of learning arithmetic, it may be said that 
we “learn by doing” more than by listening. We learn “to- 
getherness” by doing some particular thing together over and 
over again. 
The ritualistic type of religious education thus furnishes 
a means for the perpetuation of the church as a particular so- 
ciety within the community. A distinctive form of worship, 
repeated every Sunday, produces in the worshipper a sense 
of being himself religiously distinct from the mass outside 
his church. This sense of distinctness easily passes into a posi- 
tive sense of obligation, and into firm loyalty. It would be
-P-A-G-E-335
  RITUALISM 323 
difficult to discover an educational instrument that is better 
adapted for producing a close-knit, self-perpetuating ecclesi- 
astical consciousness. 
But the point of its social strength is also the point where 
danger of social limitation and defect appears. For the problem 
of the Christian religion is that of transforming the community’s 
whole social life into a brotherhood. A particular religious 
fraternity within the community, though its doors be wide open 
to everybody, is not, and cannot be, the solution of this prob- 
lem. The social education of the child must have a horizon 
that reaches far outside of church consciousness. He must be 
trained to community “togetherness”’ not merely ecclesiastical 
“togetherness.”” Loyalty to the church must fuse in his con- 
sciousness with loyalty of the church to the cause of social wel- 
fare, social justice, and world society. 
This might conceivably be accomplished in part through a 
ritual. But the content of it would have to be rich in social 
suggestiveness. To be thus rich, it would have to approach the 
problems of to-day and of to-morrow in terms that are not too 
ancient. The simple truth is that we cannot adequately express 
our own sense of the social will of God in terms derived from the 
outworn social standards of centuries ago. How, for example, 
can we bring ourselves to pray heartily for “the poor” in the 
ancient terms? ‘The existence of poverty suggests to us, or 
ought to, a different line of reflection, a different sort of stimulus. 
We need modes of worship that will make it uncomfortable for 
us to carry “the poor” to the Lord when we the worshippers are 
carrying the product of the laborer’s industry in our own 
pockets! Nor will the offering of our worldly substance as a 
part of the ritual suffice. Into worship itself must go the sword 
of the Spirit, the sword of the social justice that is love.

  CHAPTER XXIII 
EDUCATIONAL TENDENCIES OF EVANGELICALISM 
Personal religion as experience of reconciliation with God. 
The term “evangelicalism” will be used in this discussion in 
the restricted sense of promoting personal religion conceived 
as experience of one’s reconciliation with God. Evangelicalism 
takes the standpoint of personal experience as distinguished 
from doctrinal correctness, from correct church relations, 
from ritualistic performances, and from correct acts or “good 
works.”’ Reconciliation is thought of, not as our achievement, 
but as divinely wrought for us and within us, and requiring of 
us only surrender of self-will and acceptance of the will of God. 
The emphasis is upon an experienced reversal of one’s status be- 
fore God, and a corresponding reversal in one’s course of life. 
To produce contrast-effects like this the conditions of stirring 
emotions must be created. The people have been gathered 
into great assemblies where the arts of social suggestion have 
been employed, often with skill. The dreadfulness of sin, the 
hopeless outlook for the sinner, the sufferings of Jesus on our 
behalf, the readiness of the Father to forgive, the happiness of 
the pardoned sinner, and his release from the thraldom of evil 
desires and habits—these are the most characteristic themes. 
They have been reinforced by appealing music, personal testi- 
mony of converts, individual urging, and the sight of others 
yielding to these persuasives. So much has religious emotion 
been focussed upon this one point that “having a personal 
Christian experience” has been understood in large circles as 
meaning “having a conversion experience.” The remainder of 
life has anchored itself in the assurance that at some particular 
point in time “the great transaction” has been completed. 
The impossibility of continuously maintaining the emotione. 
324
-P-A-G-E-337
  EVANGELICALISM 325 
exaltation of the revival, and the limited response to the revival 
appeal, have necessitated much softening down of these con- 
trast-effects in the every-day life of the churches. The typical 
appeal now becomes to “decide for Christ,” and highly colored 
emotions are declared to be non-essential. Here we find a shift 
of emphasis from God’s acts in us and with respect to us, to our 
acts with respect to him and his purposes. What here remains 
as characteristic of evangelicalism is little more than the teach- 
ing that to be a Christian one must at some particular instant 
cross a line that separates the saved from the unsaved. 
Some social consequences of this point of view. Looked at 
as an abstract theory, the standpoint of such a personal religious 
experience, as far as it is held out as a privilege of every one, and 
not as an arbitrary divine bestowal, may be said to contain a 
germ of religious democracy. As a matter of fact, insistence 
that all men are sinners, that all are subject to the same con- 
demnation, that all must meet the same conditions of salvation, 
and that the attitude of God is “ Whosoever will,” has been an 
appreciable social leveller. Revival meetings are notably demo- 
cratic in tone. If wealth or privilege retains any aristocratic 
prerogative in them, it must be by some subtle rather than overt 
control. Moreover, the thought that each of us stands in direct, 
indefinitely modifiable relations with God, not merely in seme 
fixed social status, has been an immeasurable inspiration to 
self-development. It has brought out the innate powers of 
multitudes of plain men. It has stimulated education. Long 
before our States reached a conviction that the public school 
system should reach all the way to the university, or even to the 
high school, ministers were successfully appealing to farmers, 
mechanics, and shopkeepers to found and support academies 
and colleges and to send their sons thereto. 
Theoretically evangelicalism transcends also certain other 
tendencies to spiritual aristocracy that have long had a place 
within Christianity. No longer are the favors of the divine 
presence regarded as a prerogative of a few saints who can 
give themselves to contemplation and to austerities while the 
mass of the people walks upon the lower level of formal com-
-P-A-G-E-338
  326 EVANGELICALISM 
pliance with a few external requirements of the church. No; 
the plain man, too, can walk in heavenly places in this life, 
and he can converse out of his own experience upon the highest 
themes. 
All this is true theoretically, and to some extent in practice. 
But the tendency toward democracy that is unquestionably 
here is partly defeated by the effort of evangelicalism to pro- 
mote a uniform experience among human beings who are not 
uniform. Attempts to standardize religious emotion have 
failed even in religious bodies in which these attempts have been 
unresisted. But in the meantime, individuals who by virtue 
of temperamental traits or of a favorable conjunction of cir- 
cumstances happen to have had the standard evangelical ex- 
perience, have become a spiritual aristocracy. They are the 
ones who have indubitably “got religion”; they are the ones 
who have something to talk about in the experience meeting; 
and consequently a tacit discount is placed upon experience of 
other types. ‘Thus we have a superior religious class alongside 
the religious commonalty, and between the two there often 
exists an emotional difference that interferes with the formation 
of unified group purposes. 
The place of children in the thought of evangelicalism. 
Not only are adults not all capable of the experience that evan- 
gelicalism has prized; this experience is also practically inacces- 
sible to young children without forcing them toward religious 
morbidity. The conversion experience is distinctly a thing of 
adolescent and adult life. Here, then, is another tendency to 
religious stratification. If church membership is reserved for 
those who have had the standard evangelical experience, then 
what is the religious and ecclesiastical status of young children 
who are under the church’s care? Unmodified evangelicalism 
has no workable conception of a present Christian life for them, 
or of membership in the Christian communion. 
A movement that exalts the love of God as evangelicalism 
has done is bound, of course, to take a warm interest in children. 
It is bound to find ways to teach religion, whether consistently 
or not. In fact, the churches that have been foremost in the
-P-A-G-E-339
  EVANGELICALISM 327 
Sunday school movement are the ones that have been most 
strongly impregnated with evangelicalism. They have looked 
upon the Sunday school theoretically as an agency for convert- 
ing the young. But they have stretched the term “ conversion.” 
Their observation of children has shown the inapplicability of 
the term in its strict evangelical sense to the younger pupils, 
and to a large extent even to adolescents. The churches have 
been forced by realities to conceive the Sunday school more 
and more as an educational enterprise. The acclimating of the 
term “religious education” during the last twenty years is an 
interesting index of this movement. Religious thought with 
respect to the young is crystallizing, even in evangelical circles, 
around the idea of religious growth—growth that does not 
necessarily presuppose an antecedent conversion. 
Wherein, now, can such religious growth be conceived to con- 
sist? Can it be included within the notion of religious experi- 
ence, and if so, how? ‘The close association of evangelicalism 
with dogmatism produced as a first conception of the pupil’s 
growth that of increase in his knowledge of the Scriptures. 
But this did not satisfy the presupposition that religion is an 
experience of God. Evangelicalism, with all its emphasis 
upon the Bible, could not rest here. The child’s knowledge, 
even of the Scriptures, must not be left as a thing by itself; it 
must somehow be wrought into an integral life that can move on 
from level to level as the child’s years increase. Again and again 
effort has been made to meet this demand by adding evangelism 
to religious education. But this has not met the situation be- 
cause it ignores the principle of growth. Child evangelism is 
itself something per se interjected into the course of teaching 
and training, and entirely independent of the principle of 
growth. 
Gradually there is dawning a realization that our social ex- 
perience is a sphere for communion with God, that here children 
can share religion with adults, and can grow in religion without 
any forcing whatever. Here the bond of union between adults, 
and between them and children, is the same; it is neither uni- 
formity of doctrine, nor yet the emotional experience of recon- 
   
-P-A-G-E-340
  328 EVANGELICALISM 
ciliation, but rather the experience of a purpose of reconciliation, 
the purpose to live a common life as brothers, and in so doing to 
live a common life with the Father. 
This is not only an inclusive conception, inclusive of indi- 
viduals old and young, inclusive of all churches as far as they 
are really brotherhoods, inclusive of all the good will beyond the 
churches; it is also a theologically reconciling conception. The 
notion of sin and of release from it, the notion of individual 
reconciliation with the Father, and the notion of a life that is 
from above, are not only not smothered; they are filled with the 
most poignant content. The waste of life because we are not 
brothers, the waste of health, the poverty, the broken homes, 
the stunted and distorted minds, the quarrels, the oppression 
of class by class, the riots, the wars, the pessimism—all this in 
the midst of which we live, a part of which we are, is the world 
sunken in iniquity. When in such a world we take as our 
own God’s purpose of reconciliation we do not escape the ex- 
perience of condemnation and of repentance, or the necessity 
for a saving faith. For we have natural tendencies to selfish- 
ness, greed, and revenge, all of which must be overcome; we 
have to extricate our will from a social complex in which we 
profit at the expense of our fellows; we have to face the suffering 
of the world as a consequence in part of our own neglect; we 
find necessary not only stern self-discipline, but also faith that is 
robust enough to face unflinchingly this, the most stupendous, 
the most oppressive, the most tragic problem that the mind of 
man has conceived. 
This social experience of God in his world—God in all love, 
and in all that wins us to the love way—makes the love of the 
Father and the love of the neighbor one experience. This is a 
religion of the heart. It will tax all the emotional resources of 
evangelicalism. It will still single out each individual, and it 
will go on utilizing the values of mass suggestion. But it will 
not separate emotion from study or from action. And because 
it will maintain these three in vital unity, it will obliterate the 
gulf that has existed between child and man, between religious 
education and religious experience.
-P-A-G-E-341
  EVANGELICALISM 329 
The Sunday school as an evangelistic agency. What has 
just been sketched might be called a socialized evangelicalism. 
It conceives religion as experience, and specifically as experi- 
ence of reconciliation, but it holds that reconciliation lies in the 
purpose to reconcile, and that three parties are involved, my- 
self, my neighbor, and God. It holds, further, that the inner 
rectification of the heart, and the outer act of establishing a just 
society, are phases of one and the same reconciling process. 
Religious experience is here no longer separated from the social 
relations and enterprises that a child can appreciate. On this 
basis the Sunday school can still be—it must be—an evangel- 
istic agency. But its effectiveness as such an agency will de- 
pend to some extent upon reconstructing existing conditions 
and methods. 
(1) Unambiguous standing within the religious communion 
should be made possible for every child. This cannot be done 
until child religion is conceived in terms of a growing purpose. 
A recent writer in a magazine that is published in the interest 
of the religious life of boys treats the Christian experience as 
if it must have its beginning in the bluntness of a conscious 
life choice. He speaks of a day when we choose to take religion 
in earnest, of an hour when the gospel must be deliberately 
accepted or deliberately rejected. “The choice of life,” he 
says, “cannot be broken up into little bits.”! Here we have 
a mechanical rather than a vital mode of thought concerning 
the things of character. The successive acts in which a will 
grows are thought of, not in terms of growth but of accretion, 
or as so many mutually external bits which are merely juxta- 
posed or heaped up. The same type of thought appears in 
those who hold that every child must be on one side or the 
other of a fixed line that separates the saved from the unsaved. 
Parents whose affection makes it impossible for them to set 
up any such mechanical division between their own offspring, 
especially between young children, often fail to see the in- 
congruity of ascribing anything of the kind to God. 
A social conception of God and of our reconciliation with him

-P-A-G-E-342
  330 EVANGELICALISM 
will recognize every affectionate pulse-beat as divine. Re- 
ligious education will seize upon every impulse to generosity, 
to justice, and to co-operation as an occasion to make the pupil 
realize that just here he is in fellowship with the church and 
with the Father. This fellowship will involve mutual recogni- 
tion, the child recognizing the church as a society in which he 
must grow, and the church recognizing children as already 
within itself, yes, as its very self in process of growth. This 
recognition, to be most effective, will need outward signs and 
specific methods of calling to remembrance. Just what 
changes this will imply in the rules of various denominations 
need not here be specified, nor is it necessary to suggest par- 
ticular occasions on which adults and children may well cele- 
brate together their unity in the Christian purpose. It is 
enough to point out that overt acts of co-operation, and overt 
recognition of one another, are essential alike to the child and 
to the adult. 
(2) The undue extension, and consequent weakening, of the 
term “conversion,” should be resisted. When the religious 
life of small children is thought of in terms of status rather 
than in terms of growth, the tendency is to extend and dilute 
the meaning of the conversion whereby the status is supposed to 
be established. If the term is to be applied to persons whose 
will is still relatively inchoate, lacking sharp edges and definite 
moral attitudes, what shall it mean when adults are called upon 
to repent and be converted? Obviously, if adults and young 
children are both included under the term, its essential and 
irreducible meaning will be found in the infantile mind that 
shows signs of piety. Have we not here a large part of the 
explanation for the indefiniteness that has come to characterize 
the evangelistic appeal to adults? And of the degradation of 
statistics of conversions—as though one who holds up a hand, 
or signs a card, or shakes hands with an evangelist is to be 
counted as a converted man! In the interest of child religion 
and of adult religion alike, this tendency should be resisted. 
Small children are simply not capable of viewing life’s problems 
in the perspective that is implied in an intelligent life choice.
-P-A-G-E-343
  EVANGELICALISM 331 
But they are capable of responding to love, and of sharing with 
adults in the work of reconciliation—they are capable of grow- 
ing in the love way. 
(3) If a “decision day” is observed, it should respect the prin- 
ciple of growth, with its corollary of gradation. The reductio 
ad absurdum of Sunday school evangelism is found in Sunday 
schools that once a year interrupt and lay aside the educational 
process in order to make an appeal to all pupils above seven 
years of age to make an immediate decision for Christ. There 
are schools in which the same little children sign decision cards 
year after year. The trouble with this is not that there is too 
much evangelism, but too little. For the meaning of the sup- 
posed decision is washed out and faded by the indiscriminate- 
ness of the method. It should require no great depth of either 
psychological or religious insight to perceive that when the 
same appeal for decision is put before a child of eight and one 
of sixteen before whom the vista of life is opening emotionally 
and intellectually, there is religious incongruity that is likely 
to interfere with the vital processes of both. The will grows; 
it, as well as the intelligence, requires gradation of educational 
process and material. 
Moreover, to ignore on decision day the growth of will that 
has been going on through the regular processes of instruction 
and training is to run the risk of making personal religion 
abstract or sentimental or bafflingly mysterious. Why ask a 
child to begin the religious life when he has already taken many 
steps in it? How can teachers assume that Christian purpose 
is lacking when the whole tendency of the preceding Sunday 
school experience has been to produce and clarify such purpose ? 
The most that decision day can be expected to do is to produce 
more or less of a climax in a process that has been going on for 
years. This climax, too, will differ from department to de- 
partment. If decision day could be changed in substance and 
in name to “fellowship day,” the purpose of which should be 
realization of our fellowship with one another, with Jesus, and 
with the Father in a common purpose of social reconciliation, 
then every grade in the school could celebrate the festival in
-P-A-G-E-344
  332 EVANGELICALISM 
its own way. The social longings of adolescence could be met 
by confirmation or its equivalent in the way of public con- 
fession by the pupil and recognition by the church. A parallel, 
but simpler and narrower, declaration of standpoint could be 
made by each earlier department or grade, and recognition by 
the church through the department could correspond to the 
recognition of adolescents as full members. The whole would 
constitute a joyous-solemn calling to mind of what it is that 
unites these pupils and their teachers to one another in the 
church and in the school, with appropriate measures for ena- 
bling each pupil, in a manner appropriate to his age, to realize 
that this is my purpose, and that this is my church. 
There is reason for questioning the social tendency of de- 
cision-day methods that cause pupils to exaggerate the dif- 
ferences that exist between them. There are schools in which 
certain pupils, whose expressions of religious interest have 
been more prompt or more free than those of other pupils, 
have been put forward until they have become “forward.” 
The worst of it is not that these few children become priggish, 
but that religion is misrepresented to the mass of the pupils. 
It is misrepresented because their own religiousness goes 
relatively unrecognized, and because religion itself here be- 
comes sponsor for a kind of aristocracy. 
The sum of the matter is that every day should be a day of 
decision for every pupil according to his capacity for dectsion. 
That is, the whole of religious education should have its roots 
in social acts, relations, and purposes that grow from more to 
more continuously. Not that the socializing of the will can 
be expected to proceed with even pace through all stages 
of growth. The curve of mental as well as of physical growth 
is irregular, and so is the curve of social interest. We are to 
expect rapid increase here, slower increase there, with only 
approximate conformity of the individual to any age scale. 
‘The general growth of social interest that comes with adoles- 
cence may well be taken advantage of to secure the crystalliza- 
tion of social purpose that has long been forming, that is, to 
cause the pupil to realize, as never before, the fellowship of
-P-A-G-E-345
  EVANGELICALISM 333 
purpose that constitutes the church. But the realization 
of this fellowship should be part and parcel of the whole scheme 
of religious instruction and training in all the grades. 
(4) Whatever zs vital in the “evangelistic department” of 
Sunday school organizations should be taken up into the regular 
plan of instruction and training, and “child evangelism”’ should 
cease. The reason for an evangelistic department, a child 
evangelist, and evangelistic mass meetings for children grows 
out of the presupposition that the Sunday school, in its regular 
and systematic work, will teach Bible or catechism rather than 
develop Christian purpose in children. Let us make the pre- 
supposition untrue! When we do so, we shall realize that 
evangelistic meetings for children, especially those conducted 
by strangers who use high-pressure methods that ignore the 
laws of growth, are not only unnecessary, but also injurious. 
They are injurious because the impression that they make upon 
children as to the nature of the Christian life is untrue. It is 
as untrue as would be the presentation to healthy children of a 
bottle of medicine to make them grow. The Christian life 
cannot be truthfully separated, with either child or adult, from 
the social issues that constitute the difference between the mind 
of Christ and the love of the world. To draw the child’s mind 
away from these issues as they appear before him in his own 
inch-by-inch experience, and as the faithful Sunday school 
teacher has to recognize them, into a relatively abstract or 
sentimental contemplation of himself or of Christ, is to counter- 
act, not to supplement the sound work of religious education. 
(5) Greater emphasis should be placed upon the content of the 
Christian purpose. In morals and religion alike we are under 
the influence of traditions that unduly exalt the form of life as 
against the content. We are not seldom urged to be con- 
scientious, or to be true to duty when if we followed the advice 
we should obey an ignorant and sometimes injurious sense of 
duty. We are advised to surrender to God before there has 
been adequate inquiry into our idea of God. The value of sur- 
render to God depends upon the character of the God to whom 
we surrender. We are invited to come to Christ when it is not
-P-A-G-E-346
  334 EVANGELICALISM 
decisively clear what this means in terms of actual social living. 
The nature of God and the mind of Christ must be expressed in 
these terms in all our teaching. The divine presence and the 
divine nature are to be discerned in the love between men that 
the pupil can actually witness and take part in. Here is the 
application within religious education of evangelicalism’s in- 
sistence that religion is an experience. Children can have the 
experience because they can appreciate love and form a per- 
sonal will to love. But this will to love must learn to discrim- 
inate. It must be trained to take notice of the conditions of 
human life; it must learn what are the causes of welfare and 
of illfare; it must define social issues as they arise, but always 
with eyes for the distant as well as the immediate good. This 
is evangelistic teaching, the teaching of the good news that is 
for all the world, the pressing home to the individual pupil of 
the insistent love of God.
-P-A-G-E-347
  CHAPTER XXIV 
EDUCATIONAL TENDENCIES OF LIBERALISM 
The notion of religious freedom. For the purposes of the 
present discussion religious liberalism may be defined as the 
attempt to incorporate freedom into religion. Not freedom 
from religion, but freedom in religion, is the idea. As religious 
repression has taken the two main forms of control of thought 
and control of worship or of ecclesiastical life in general, so the 
effort at liberation has been directed chiefly toward untram- 
melled thinking and a rationally regulated life, worship included. 
The demand for religious subjection has always presented 
itself as a command of God addressed to men, whereas it has 
always been a command of some men addressed to others in the 
name of God. The essence of dogmatism is its demand that I 
shall take as divine revelation what other men have already 
judged to be revelation. ‘To submit to this demand is to sub- 
mit to men, not God. Just so, when the church prescribes 
exclusive modes of worship or rules of conduct, what happens 
is that some men presume to decide these things for others. 
Hence the central tendency of liberalism has been to clear up 
the confusion of mind whereby human opinions have been given 
the force of divine revelation, and human judgments the force 
of divine commands, and to show, instead, the inherent natural- 
ness and reasonableness of religion. This clearing-up process 
is going on actively in many ecclesiastical circles, orthodox as 
well as heterodox. 
The result of resisting sectarian restrictions upon the mind, 
and of falling back upon what is broadly human as the sphere 
in which to trace the thoughts of God, varies according to the 
position of the emphasis. When liberalism places its emphasis 
upon sound knowledge, how to maintain religious zeal becomes 
a problem. The very narrowness of dogmatism seems at times 
335
-P-A-G-E-348
336 LIBERALISM 
to produce religious intensity that has power with men, whereas 
the liberal thinker tends not seldom to become an onlooker 
rather than a doer. On the other hand, however, breadth of 
thought tends with some persons toward a more or less mystical 
realization of the all-encompassing divine life. Here is warmth 
of feeling, not mere pointedness of thought. But, all in all, 
the attempt to incorporate freedom into religion tends to re- 
place the rejected authority not so much by sound knowledge, 
or by mystical delights, as by the affirmation of ethical princi- 
ples as the mind of God. When liberalism insists upon being 
positively religious as well as open-minded, it has nothing that 
it can substitute for simple goodness. Dogmatism encounters 
the danger of substituting orthodoxy for kindness, and ritualism 
the danger of substituting institutional conformity for social 
breadth. But liberalism has no cloak with which to conceal 
the irreligion that is in all unkindness, all neglect of human needs. 
Liberalism instills ethical principles, not by authority, but 
through reflection. Hence the tendency to habituation by drill 
processes is less in evidence than it is in either the dogmatic 
or the ritualistic type of education. Moreover, since reflection 
is a process in which one acts as an individual, a process in which 
one must resist gregarious tendencies, for the time being at least, 
liberalism is less inclined than is evangelicalism to mass move- 
ments that sway men by suggestion rather than by inciting them 
to think for themselves. 
Here, then, are three points in which liberalism has obvious 
significance for a theory of religious education: The effort to 
develop in each person an individual or independent attitude 
in all religious matters; the awakening of thought as contrasted 
with mental habituation; and the fusion of rightness toward 
God with rightness toward men. Before we attempt to weigh 
the social significance of all this, let us pause to consider some 
phases of the relation between religious freedom and the general 
cause of human liberty. 
Can there be religious emancipation within aristocratic 
or plutocratic society? It is possible to think of liberal relig- 
ion in terms of the individual rather than of society. If the 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
LIBERALISM 337 
civil state protects me from distraint of person and of property 
on account of religion, and if I use my own ability to think, re- 
sisting all ecclesiastical dictation, am I not then free indeed? 
What is religious emancipation if not just release from ancient 
ecclesiastical restraints ? 
The youth of our colleges are often warned not to think 
of freedom as merely negative, the mere absence of restraint. 
We say to them: “You cannot be really free until, first, you 
acquire ability to resist your impulses and to organize yourself 
upon a plan that you deliberately approve, and until, second, 
you acquire purposes large enough to furnish outlet for your 
powers.” With equal truth a third thing might be said: “You 
cannot be free until you are enlisted in the cause of freedom for 
all. For the you that requires to be organized, and that requires 
outlet for its powers, is social in nature, fundamentally so. 
Moreover, as long as you remain an acquiescent, non-protesting 
member of a society that oppresses your fellows, you must either 
close your eyes to injustice or else bribe your heart by the ad- 
vantages of silence. In either case the wheel of inequality 
passes over your soul, grinding it into the dust. Oppression 
makes its beneficiaries as well as its victims unfree.” 
It is quite possible to exercise negative religious freedom with- 
out finding adequate religious self-expression. The negatively 
free mind may be most conventional, most swayed by the in- 
terests with which it is socially and economically bound. It 
may be a contented member of a religious set or clique. It may 
be so tied to the past as to resist the truly free religion of social 
justice. As a matter of fact, the era of our attempt to unfetter. 
religion finds various fundamental rights of man as yet un- 
achieved, and as yet there is no sufficiently clear demonstration 
of the essential relationship between the different kinds of free-. 
dom. Inasociety that does not yet secure to masses of children 
the health that the community possesses the means to bestow— 
in such a society what is religious freedom after all, even for: 
one whose own children are healthy ? 
The right to think, and to worship according to the dictates: 
of one’s own judgment does indeed occupy a basal position. 
 
-P-A-G-E-350
338 LIBERALISM 
in the general emancipation of man. But the structure of 
liberty consists of much more than foundation-stones. Release 
from restraint is release of power that insists upon giving effect 
to itself. In this case, what effect? To throw off the yoke 
of spiritual subjection must ultimately mean getting into 
action for larger, deeper spiritual ends. It must mean that 
we are ready to wrestle as never before with the god of this 
world. 
In short, within a social system of aristocratic or plutocratic 
privilege, positive religious emancipation is possible only on 
condition that we enter into the divine purpose to do away with 
privilege and set up democracy. Religious liberalism has not 
failed to give signs that this is the law of its inner life, for it 
has been foremost in opposition to slavery. In general, too, 
the liberal mind can be relied upon to see through the obfusca- 
tions whereby autocracy of many kinds constantly strives to 
justify irrational force by reason. Going forward in the same 
path, emancipated souls will find still fuller religious life, still 
fuller realization of God, in the struggle for social justice and a 
world society. Emancipated souls must find this, or else, their 
freedom being merely negative, their religious life will be bound 
hand and foot by social orthodoxy. 
The educational problems of liberalism. All the queries 
that have just been raised as to the relations within liberalism 
between reflection and action on the one hand, and between 
individual independence and social justice on the other, are 
educational problems. I shall now set them forth as such, 
with a hint or two toward solutions. 
(1) Liberalism opens the way to the most vital materials and 
methods of instruction, but it encounters the danger of intellectual- 
asm. It is of the essence of external religious authority to dis- 
courage too curious prying into facts with respect to the human 
bearers of the supposed divine prerogatives. History is rel- 
atively non-essential, at least history as inquiry, for dogmatism 
is fully ready to formulate all that is religiously essential in the 
past. Similarly, dogmatism is satisfied with a relatively narrow 
range of subjects for study. Why, for instance, should one 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
    LIBERALISM 3SY 
study religions other than one’s own? Why should one be 
religiously concerned to understand the world movements of 
the present, since a completed faith was once delivered, and only 
once, to the saints? This intellectual attitude liberalism exactly 
_ reverses. It is interested in the human as such, partly for the 
sake of avoiding human error, partly because the human as 
such is looked upon as revealing divine guidance and meaning. 
Therefore, the further we can trace down the human elements in 
history the better; the more we know about other religions the 
better for our own. 
This spirit meets the interests of pupils without reservation, 
for it brings human action into the foreground, and encourages 
curiosity. There is less tendency to flatten out things in the 
interest of a formula. Moreover, methods of pupil self-expres- 
sion can be adopted with less reserve. For, whereas dogmatic 
teaching fails of its purpose unless it gives the pupil’s mind a 
particular set, liberalism is most concerned that the pupil 
should weigh facts, and do some real thinking of his own, even 
if his thoughts do not reproduce those of his teacher. 
On the other hand, so much of the struggle for religious free- 
dom has centred around the right to think, and the adoption of 
sound methods of investigation has necessitated so much revi- 
sion of biblical interpretation, that liberalism has formed an 
intellectual habit that, carried into religious life, becomes in- 
tellectualism. The place that intellectuality occupies in the 
campaign against restraints and against historical errors is 
different from the place that it holds in the promotion of vital 
religion. The mental operation that is chiefly required for 
religious growth is the discriminative appreciation of values. 
This involves, of course, observation of facts, some understand- 
ing of the past, and some rational foresight; it involves some 
generalization of the standpoint from which one judges life and 
duty; but here the main work of intelligence is to clarify one’s 
desires and purposes so that revision may be made, and to 
discover means whereby one’s life purposes may be carried 
out. The achievement of a broad outlook, then, or of ability 
to prove or defend one’s position by sound knowledge is at
-P-A-G-E-352

most a single part, and that not the central part, of religious 
instruction.! 
(2) Inberalism makes for ethical clarity and breadth, but it 
easily fails of ethical fervor. Holding to the ideal of a rationally 
ordered life, as distinguished from one that is ecclesiastically 
prescribed, the liberal would avoid, on the one hand, drifting 
with the currents of conventionalism and, on the other hand, 
being swept off his feet by floods of mass emotion. The atti- 
tude of ethical reflection has the value of contributing to 
clarity and breadth of purpose, and not seldom to steady loyalty 
to a principle through thick and thin. But, on the other hand, 
reflection has the effect of inhibiting impulses, and of postponing 
or resisting rather than of initiating action. Now, a locomotive 
engine must of course have a throttle, but it must have steam 
also. Human impulses must be regulated and redirected, but 
yet the inner fire is what moves life up the grade of progress. 
Religious education must include provision for cultivating re- 
ligious fervor. 
1Some years ago a liberal-minded clergyman of orthodox affiliations, con- 
vinced that catechetical instruction should be revived in Protestantism, and 
finding no printed catechism that suited him, undertook to write one. Here are 
some of the questions and answers that resulted: 
“1. Q. Apart from the things which you believe, hope, or imagine to be true, 
what do you know ? 
A. I know that there is a world, and that I live in it, 
2. Q. How do you know that there is a world ? 
A. I know that there is a world because I can touch, taste, smell, see and 
hear. 
3. Q. How do you know that you live ? 
A. I know that I live because I think, feel and will. 
23. Q. Since God made you to love these things, does he compel you so to do ? 
A. No; though God has made me in order that I might love the good, the 
true, and the beautiful, He made me able to love or to hate, to choose or to 
refuse, that so my love may be my own free offering to Him. This liberty 
is God's highest gift to me, and I must take heed that I do not prove unworthy 
of His trust. 
24. Q. How may we know God ? 
A. We may know God through our own moral character, our conscience, 
and our best aspirations and hopes; through nature and the beauty of the world 
which he has made; through the better impulses of all men, and the enlight- 
ened understanding and holy living of the best men; through the Bible; and 
through the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.” 
This was intended for pupils from ten to fifteen years of age. The obvious 
assumption is that what the clergyman regards as fundamental in his own 
thought-system is fundamental in religious instruction and therefore should 
come first.
-P-A-G-E-353
    LIBERALISM 341 
(3) Liberalism cultivates respect for man as man, but it does 
not so readily appreciate institutional organizations of the good 
will, such as the church. It is not to be wondered at that those 
whose liberties were wrested from the church by hard struggle 
should show little inclination toward ecclesiastical harness. 
But respect for man must go on to become love for man, and 
love must go on from being a sentiment to become a policy of 
action, and love as a policy of action requires machinery for 
co-operation and for continuity. Liberalism should go on to 
free men’s hands and feet as well as heads—free them not only 
in the sense of getting them loose, but also in the sense of getting 
them into exercise. It would seem as though the next step 
is to transform ecclesiastical institutions into organs of a free- 
dom that is more complete than free speech, even the freedom 
of love in co-operative action.! 
(4) These three positive educational tendencies of liberalism 
can be reinforced, and the correlative defects avoided, by rdentrfy- 
ing religious freedom with the positive purpose of the democracy of 
God. When religious instruction has as its definite goal the 
formation of an intelligent and thoroughly Christian social will, 
the menace of intellectualism will be removed. It will be 
removed, not by letting down intellectual standards, not by 
putting fences around inquiry, but by putting knowledge into 
its natural and proper relation to life. It is, I believe, the uni- 
form experience of teachers and of educational institutions that, 
all in all, students show the greatest intellectual zeal when they 
are conscious that the knowledge that they seek has a bearing 
upon their wider purposes. 
Ethical clarity and breadth, moreover, can best be promoted 
1 The ecclesiastical limitations of negative freedom are clearly apparent in 
the following words of ex-President Eliot: ‘‘The genuine Unitarian values 
so highly his liberty of thought and his freedom from all bonds of traditional 
and gregarious opinion that, as a rule, he is not willing to attempt the imposi- 
tion of his own opinions on anybody else, not even on his children. He is 
rarelyvinterested in foreign missions except on their medical and anthropologi- 
cal side, and he makes a poor propagandist at home; for he is apt to hold that 
mobody ought to be or become a Unitarian except a person whose own mind 
and will work in such a way that he cannot help being or becoming a Unitarian.’’ 
(From a pamphlet, The Education of our Boys and Girls, published by the Amer- 
ican Unitarian Association.)
-P-A-G-E-354
  
342 LIBERALISM 
in the presence of live social issues. There is, to be sure, a more 
or less popular notion that in order to see a moral issue clearly 
one must be outside it, must be able to look at it without feel- 
ing it. But this is at most only a half-truth. There are mat- 
ters, such as music and poetry, in which we do not even begin 
to understand until our feelings are engaged. So, in moral 
instruction nothing so effectively shakes pupil and teacher 
out of moral conventionality as to face the actual, present strug- 
gle of men for justice, and especially to take some part in it. 
“T never thought of this before”’ is the common experience when 
moral reflection steps out from the social aloofness of generalities 
into the concreteness of a moral world now in process of crea- 
tion. When we get into the struggle to put love into effective 
action, when we insist upon getting results, then two things hap- 
pen: We love with a new fervor, and we see the nature of the 
issue as we never saw it before. 
It is then that the necessity and the possibilities of the 
church fully dawn upon us. The church is necessary as a 
preacher of radical good will, which is human participation in 
a divine love that, though it may be repulsed, will not be 
defeated. The church is necessary as a fellowship of those 
who, aspiring to this radical good will in their own conduct, 
need the support of like aspiring souls. The church is necessary 
as a champion of the “forlorn hopes” of society, the social causes 
that the “practical”? man regards as visionary. The church is 
necessary, finally, as an educator of children in these ideals 
and practices. It is the only institution of large scope that we 
can have any hope of inducing to teach democracy in this thor- 
oughgoing fashion. Liberalism needs the church for the 
achievement of liberty itself.

CURRENT PROGRESS IN THE ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF RE- 
LIGIOUS EDUCATION IN CHURCH, DENOMINATION, AND COMMUNITY 
A reform movement in the organization and methods of religious 
education is more or less manifest in a multitude of publications, both 
books and periodicals. The present short list is intended simply to 
indicate the general direction of this movement. ‘The reader should 
not fail to consult the files of Religious Education for articles not here 
listed. Whoever desires a complete picture of the situation in Protes- 
tant circles in the United States should consult in addition the reports 
of the Sunday School Council of Evangelical Denominations; the 
Sunday-school magazines published by the different denominations; 
the proceedings and the various circulars of the International Sunday 
School Association; the reports of the Sunday School Commission of 
the Federal Council; the reports of denominational commissions and 
departments of religious education or of Sunday schools; the teachers’ 
books in each of the graded lesson series; the newer text-books for 
teacher training, such as the “Modern Sunday School Manuals” 
(published by a Methodist and Congregational syndicate), ‘The 
Worker and His Work” series (published by the Methodist Book Con- 
cern), and the handbooks on ‘Principles and Methods of Religious 
Education” (published by the University of Chicago Press); finally, 
the constantly enlarging lists of the denominational and other pub- 
lishers of religious literature.

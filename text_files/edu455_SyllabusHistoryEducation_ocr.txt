PREFACE 
Tue present volume is the outgrowth of several years’ 
experience in the use of the syllabus method in teaching the 
history of education. The syllabi were originally prepared 
in a somewhat elaborate form for use in graduate classes at 
Yale University. The teaching method used in the course 
at Yale combined extensive library reading with lectures. 
Subsequently the syllabi were revised and to some degree 
abridged for my classes in the Brooklyn Training School for 
Teachers, where they have been of service in directing and 
organizing the students’ reading. They are now published 
in the belief that they will fill a wider field of usefulness in 
normal school and college classes. 
The student of the history of education is confronted by 
two serious obstacles. First, there is the difficulty of amass- 
ing and retaining a foundation of fact sufficient to support 
the broad generalizations that are needful if a course in the 
subject is to fulfill its function of emancipating the peda- 
gogical mind from petty prejudices and schoolroom idols. 
Second, there is the difficulty of organizing the facts, when 
once they are acquired, into a useful system of applicable 
knowledge. No one knows the extent of these difficulties 
until he has had the responsible office of guiding untraveled 
footsteps through the labyrinth constituting the history of 
education, within the time-limits imposed by the average 
normal school course. Yet unless a full array of facts 
is presented and adequately organized, such a course does 
not measure up to its educational possibilities.

Iv PREFACE 
It is as an adjunct to reading and an aid to logical organi- 
zation that this syllabus will prove most useful. In order 
to encourage as wide a range of reading as possible, page 
references to the most accessible text-books and reference 
books have been cited. The thought is that where a teacher 
prefers the text-book method, and relies on only one book, 
references to his favorite text will be found. But in case 
the teacher refers to several books, —the better method, in 
the author’s judgment, —a sufficient number of references 
will be available to meet his needs.

ORIENTAL EDUCATION 
The Oriental nations were alike in the following 
respects: first, they were isolated; second, they were 
exclusive; third, they adhered to hard and fast social 
distinctions ; fourth, they held that wisdom comes either 
from the past or from a higher power that reveals itself 
through inspired persons; fifth, they were ruled by a 
special class whose authority was sanctioned by tradition 
or a power higher than man; sixth, religion and govern- 
ment were closely related.

ROMAN EDUCATION 
The Romans were the second Aryan race to develop 
a high type of civilization upon European soil. Ina 
considerable measure they took up the work of develop- 
ing European culture where the Greeks left it. Their 
most important characteristics were as follows: first, 
they were practical rather than idealistic; second, they 
were remarkable social organizers ; third, they respected 
law and social order; fourth, they exhibited unusual 
talent in assimilating other races to their own institu- 
tions, and in availing themselves of the best features in the 
institutions of conquered peoples ; fifth, though imitative 
rather than original in art, literature, and philosophy, 
they nevertheless contributed to the development of 
these fields by the selective assimilation of the efforts of 
other nations.

MEDIAZVAL EDUCATION 
This period represents the efforts of the Celtic and 
Teutonic branches of the Aryan race to develop a type 
of culture the fundamental principles of which were bor- 
rowed from the Hebrews. The religious and moral 
conceptions of the Middle Ages were of Jewish origin. 
These conceptions were, however, transmitted to the 
Celts and Teutons through the medium of the Grzeco- 
Roman civilization. Hence many elements derived 
from classical culture modified the pure Hebraism in 
the process of transmission. The dominant thought 
throughout the period was that culture should take the 
form of moral and religious discipline. There was also 
another important conception: that society is an organi- 
zation under the control of a religious hierarchy having 
the prerogative of absolute jurisdiction over all cultural 
forces.

MODERN EDUCATION 
The modern period in education exhibits the develop- 
ment of the European nations which resulted from their 
assimilation of the chief contributions of antiquity and the 
Middle Ages. From the Hebrews had come the religion 
—pby the beginning of the modern period pretty well 
modified to the Aryan race-temperament; from the 
Greeks the sense of proportion and the feeling for 
beauty; from the Romans the legal and institutional 
aspects of civilization; from the Middle Ages the view 
that life is disciplinary and preparatory, — therefore a 
trying of moral issues. The great nations of Europe 
had pretty definitely determined their boundaries. At 
the dawn of the modern period a new continent was dis- 
covered. The situation was propitious for the manifes- 
tation of the genius of the Aryan people — progress. 
Hence our study of modern education will bring us into 
a swift-moving current of progressive change.

placed by the modern conception of the 
responsibility of government to the 
governed.

determined by the natural cleavage con- 
sequent upon the development of modern 
languages and literatures.

the unfolding of the child’s physical and 
mental powers. 
6. Self-development is the result which the 
teacher should secure. This begins with 
sensations ; these develop into percepts; 
the percepts are organized into concepts. 
Hence early education must rely largely 
upon objects, sense symbols, and other 
objective aids. 
c. The child’s power of receiving impres- 
sions must be appealed to first, then his 
power of elaborating these impressions 
into concepts. 
d. In learning the child’s mind naturally 
moves on in the following order. 
a. From near to remote. 
8. From concrete to abstract. 
y. From particular to general. 
6. From known to unknown. 
e. The principal means of education are 
number, form, and language. 
G. Though disclaiming indebtedness to the 
earlier reformers so far as acquaintance 
with their writings is concerned, yet 
Pestalozzi absorbed much from them in 
an indirect way. Both Locke, whose 
conception of the mind he follows, and 
Comenius influenced him somewhat. 
But especially did he follow the concep- 
tion of naturalism held by Rousseau.

mind’s most important function is its  
-P-A-G-E-77
MODERN EDUCATION 67 
power to assimilate new experience to 
old, —to which is given the name of 
apperception. 
c. Herbart’s metaphysics of mind—an 
heritage from Locke’s empiricism—is as 
follows: mind is in the beginning a 
simple and unitary entity which has 
merely the power of receiving impres- 
sions (presentations) through the senses ; 
these impressions elaborate into ideas 
(experiences); out of the interaction of 
these mental contents the whole life of 
mind arises. This is a doctrine of a 
mechanics of ideas. 
d. The elaboration of the ideas as well as 
the presentations may be controlled by 
an external agency, z.e. the teacher. 
e. “Presentations” come to the mind in two 
forms: first, experiences with nature, 
elaborated into knowledge; and second, 
experiences with one’s fellows (“social 
intercourse”), elaborated into permanent 
forms of sympathy. 
J. The aim of education is ethical. The 
basis of experience necessary to realize 
this aim is acquired partly through 
the home relationships, but mainly 
through school instruction. A harmoni- 
ous organization of experience is pro- 
ductive of a state of moral approval 
resembling taste in matters of art or the 
perception of harmony in music. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  
HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
g. Since ideas are organized out of experi- 
ences or presentations, the pleasure or 
moral approval to which they give rise 
becomes a motive to (ethical) action. 
h. “Educative instruction” is possible 
through the fact that any new presenta- 
tion or experience is modified by its 
apperceptive mass of ideas (“circle of 
thought’’), and that these ideas as thus 
organized determine conduct. 
z. Proper apperception is possible only on 
the supposition that an interest is estab- 
lished in the pupil’s mind. This in- 
terest must reach out in many directions, 
so that it may aid in the apperceiving of 
manifold presentations or experiences ; 
it must be, to use Herbart’s phrase, 
manysided interest. 
Jj- Method of instruction involves certain 
steps or stages, known as the formal 
steps, viz. clearness (sensing an individ- 
ual presentation), association (the com- 
bining of the new presentation with the 
apperceptive basis), system (the organi- 
zation of the general notion as part of 
the mind’s permanent fund of knowl- 
edge), and method (the application of 
the general notion). 
&. Educative instruction is to take place: 
through an organized curriculum, involv- 
ing both a “concentration” of teaching 
about certain subjects of the course, 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
MODERN EDUCATION 69 
and the “correlation” of the different 
branches one with another. 
£&. Herbart was chiefly influenced by Locke 
~ in his psychology, by Kant in his under- 
lying philosophical principles, and by 
Pestalozzi in his pedagogy. 
¥. Herbart’s influence has been strongest in 
Germany and (within the last fifteen 
years) in the United States. His most 
influential doctrines are manysided in- 
terest, the formal steps, and correla- 
tion. .

D. Educational philosophy: , “ Education 
should lead and guide man to clearness 
concerning himself and in himself, to peace 
with nature, and to unity with God.” 
(Froebel, Education of Man.) 
. This conception implies four things: 
first, self-development; second, estab- 
lishment of social relations on an ethical 
basis; third, harmonious intercourse with 
nature; fourth, an understanding of God 
as the unity back of man and the world. 
. This end can be realized only by a sys- 
tem of education which gives free play 
to self-activity. 
a. Self-activity defined: “ Se/factivity 
ts activity determined by one’s own mo- 
tives, arising out of one’s own interests, 
and sustained by one’s own power... . 
Such activity is in a way compelled, since 
it ts in response to the inherent nature of 
being and of the individual; but as the 
individual responds only in obedience to 
the force felt within his own nature, and 
not to one from without, such activity is 
Sree—it is self-activity.’” (Monroe, A 
Brief Course in the History of Education, 
P- 337-)

a. Its precursor was Comenius’ Mother 
School. 
F. Froebel’s principles are most definitely 
connected with the ideas enunciated 
by Comenius, Rousseau, and Pesta- 
lozzi. 
G. The Kindergarten idea is so much a part 
of the educational spirit of the age that 
it is difficult to estimate it. Suffice it to 
say that its methods and spirit seem des- 
tined to extend far beyond what is 
technically kindergarten instruction. 
VI. The Utilitarian Movement (19th century). 
Te The utilitarian movement defined: The utili- 
tarian movement asserts that nature, in- 
cluding both the child’s mind and the 
environment out of which it has evolved 
and to which it responds, makes the “ use- 
Sul” the criterion of education.

-P-A-G-E-83
1 a a SRI Rik a A RN as ih a ea i en seta ef 
MODERN EDUCATION 73 
conception of method by Pestalozzi. His 
utilitarianism reflects the spirit of Eng- 
lish empiricism from Locke onward. 
#f. Spencer has been influential in placing 
science in the curriculum — especially 
throughout the English-speaking world. 
The great development of science within 
the last half-century has proved favor- 
able to his reputation. He has also done 
much to popularize the utilitarian stand- 
ard in education. Here again he has 
been assisted by modern commercialism. 
He has likewise been influential in sug- 
gesting the sociological conception of edu- 
cation, which is just now so prominent. 
TuirD: CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL THEORY 
Recent educational thought is eclectic ; that is, it pays 
due regard to the lessons of past experience as repre- 
sented in both theory and practice, while at the same 
time responding to the suggestions that come from recent 
scientific theory. This eclecticism makes classification 
of tendencies difficult, for to a certain degree it produces 
blending of outlines rather than cameo-like distinctness. 
However, certain dominant conceptions manifest them- 
selves clearly enough for classification. 
I. The Sociological Conception. 
1. Meaning of this conception: Education is the 
means of preparing the child through the 
agencies furnished by the miniature social

world of the school for the larger social life 
of the community. 
2. Literature presenting this conception : Monroe,

and Soctety ; Dutton, Social Phases of 
Education; Henderson, Education and 
the Larger Life ; Dutton and Snedden,

3. Auguste Comte, the founder of the science of 
Sociology. 
4. Lester F. Ward’s conception of the social func- 
tion of education (cf. quotation from So- 
cial Dynamics in Monroe, supra). 
5. Professor John Dewey’s conception of the pur- 
pose of education as defined in social 
terms: “ Zhe process of remaking expert- 
:
-P-A-G-E-85
“MODERN EDUCATION 75 
ence, giving tt a more socialized value 
through individual experience, by giving 
the individual better control over his own 
powers.” 
6. Sociological ideas of Pestalozzi and Froebel. 
II. The Evolutionary Conception. 
1. Meaning of this conception: Education is con- 
scious evolution, that ts, it ts the attempt 
to control the process of developmental 
change in human society through an insight 
into past processes, a foresight of ends, and 
an adaptation of means. 
2. Literature presenting this conception: O’Shea, 
Education as Adjustment; Bagley, The 
Educative Process; Horne, The Philoso- 
phy of Education, Ch. ii (aside from these 
more systematic statements of the rela- 
tion between biological and social evolu- 
tion and education are the host of indirect 
contributions to educational theory, es- 
pecially from the field of psychology, 
that are decidedly colored by evolution- 
ary concepts). 
3. Principles flowing from this conception. 
A. Civilized man is the highest but not the final 
product of evolutionary progress. 
B. Civilized man is the result of psychological 
rather than physiological evolution. 
C. Civilized man has in a measure substituted 
conscious for mechanical evolutionary pro- 
cesses.
-P-A-G-E-86
76 
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
D. Civilized man thus substitutes for the uncon- 
scious “adaptation” of lower life-forms 
conscious processes of “ adjustment.” 
E. Civilized man adapts sub-human means to 
his needs tn inventive activities, thus pro- 
ducing an artificial evolution of brute 
Sorces, inorganic and organic; and also 
adjusts to physical and social environ- 
ment. 
F. The period of most advantageous adjustment 
zs the period of plasticity — the educative 
period or youth. 
G. But since youth is also the period of inex- 
perience, maturity, that of acquired and 
classified experience (science), the adjust- 
ments of youth must be made in accordance 
with the experience of maturity; hence 
the need of teaching and education. 
HI. Through the process of evolution all per- 
manent needs become institutionalized ; 
hence the school, which is the most de- 
veloped instrument of conscious evolution. 
Close connection between the sociological and 
the evolutionary conceptions. 
. A. As man increases his mastery over nature 
by invention and discovery, evolution for 
him will tend to become more and more 
a process in social adjustment. 
a. It follows asa corollary that the specific 
adjusting agency, the school, must antici- 
pate and fulfill social ends.

APPENDIX A 
SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL INFLUENCES 
IN EDUCATION BEGINNING WITH THE 
RENAISSANCE 
I. Leading humanists (14th, 15th, and first half-of 
16th centuries). 
A. Italy. 
1. PETRARCH (1304-1374), who popularized 
the classics and wrote Italian. 
2. Boccaccio (1313-1375), a Greek student 
and writer of Italian tales. 
3. VirrorIno DA FELTRE (1379-1446), who 
incorporated the classics in the curricu- 
lum and adopted the best features of clas- 
sical method. 
B. Germany and the Netherlands. 
1. Ruporpw AcricoLa(1443-1485), a brilliant 
classical scholar. ; 
2. Joun REvcHLIN (1455-1522), who intro- 
duced Hebrew study and Bible criticism 
into Germany, thus preparing for the 
Reformation. 
3. Dresmerius Erasmus (1467-1536), who 
was the most remarkable classical scholar 
of his day, translated from Greek, edited 
the Greek New Testament, and satirized

-P-A-G-E-114
  104 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the pedantry of the medizval educa- 
tion. 
C. England. 
1. Joun CoLer (1466-1519), who studied in 
Italy, introduced the humanistic move- 
ment at Oxford, and founded St. Paul’s 
School (1512). 
2. RoGEer AscHAM (1515-1568), a celebrated 
tutor of Lady Jane Grey and Queen 
Elizabeth, author of “The Scholemas- 
ter,” and advocate of gentler measures 
in discipline, and a new method of teach- 
ing Latin. 
II. Popularizers and organizers of education among 
the adherents of the Reformation; in- 
fluences chiefly humanistic and religious 
(16th century). 
A. Martin LuTuer (1483-1546), who started the 
Protestant Reformation in Germany, and 
advocated state supervision for educa- 
tion (to be compulsory) in circular let- 
ters to public officials and in sermons to 
the people. His plan contemplated pri- 
mary schools for the people, Latin 
schools, and universities. 
B. Purie MELANCHTHON (1497-1560), the lieu- 
tenant of Luther in furthering his edu- 
cational projects, and the first great 
organizer of German schools. He be- 
came official school inspector and drew 
up the Saxony School Plan (1528), the
-P-A-G-E-115
APPENDIX A 105 
first step toward a state school system in 
Germany. Therewere to be three classes 
— elementary, secondary, and advanced ; 
and mathematics, music, religion, rheto- 
ric, dialectic, and the classics were 
among the branches taught. Melanch- 
thon also did important work as pro- 
fessor, editing classics and writing text- 
books. 
C. Jouann Sturm (1507-1589) made his contri- 
butions to educational history as rector of 
the Strasburg Gymnasium, which he de- 
veloped into the best classical school of his 
day. He developed a thoroughly organ- 
ized curriculum consisting of a gymnasial 
course of ten years, and an academic 
lecture course of five years. Piety, 
knowledge, and eloquence were his 
aims, and religious study, the classics, 
grammar, rhetoric, and logic, and some 
mathematics were the means of realiz- 
ing them. 
III. Teaching congregations (16th and 17th centu- 
A. THE ries), organized for the furtherance of 
education and missionary work within 
the Catholic Church. 
Jesuits, organized in 1540 at the insti- 
gation of Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556), 
were originally called the Society of 
Jesus. They provided carefully organ- 
ized collegiate instruction, given by
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
specially trained teachers. Sturm was 
the model for their Inferior Course of five 
grades (Lower, Middle, Upper Gram- 
mar, Humanity, Rhetoric), which was 
followed by a Superior Course of two or 
three years in philosophy, supplemented 
by four to six years of theology. All 
parts of their work were outlined in 
great detail in the Ratio Studiorum, 
issued in 1599. The organization was 
inelastic, the supervision close. Rote 
study, emulation, and mere learning re- 
ceived too much emphasis. At the same 
time, the discipline was relatively mild, 
the lessons were short and definite, and 
the singleness and clearness of aim of the 
system secured remarkably accurate re- 
sults; hence the Jesuit schools were 
unquestionably superior to other con- 
temporary forms of education in France. 
They are worthy of serious attention as 
a study in thoroughness and organization, 
as well as an example of the dangers of 
overemphasizing routine and emulation. 
As in the Strasburg Gymnasium under 
Sturm, religion, the classics, and the art 
of elegant expression were the chief ob- 
jects of their curriculum. 
B. Tue Port Royatists (1643-1660), also called 
Jansenists on account of their adherence 
to the anti-Jesuit reaction led by the 
Catholic bishop Jansen, were organized
-P-A-G-E-117
C. THe   
APPENDIX A 107 
under the leadership of St. Cyran, in the 
belief that education is able to regenerate 
society. Their schools were called the 
Petites Ecoles (Little Schools). They 
provided education for any who might 
give signs of ability, emphasizing espe- 
cially primary training. They incorpo- 
rated in their practice many of the 
suggestions advocated by the educa- 
tional reformers. Classes were kept 
small, discipline was mild yet strict and 
effectual, the vernacular (French) was 
emphasized both by teaching in it and by 
texts written in it. Reading was taught 
by giving the sound-equivalents of the 
pronounced letters of words (“ phonic” 
method), and the work was rendered 
pleasant by open-air lessons. Amuse- 
ments were used in instruction with good 
effect, but systematic physical training 
was neglected. Many of the Port Royal 
teachers wrote text-books, and their con- 
tributions to logic are particularly note- 
worthy. 
BRETHREN OF THE CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS 
(1684) was a teaching society founded 
by La Salle (1651-1719), who formulated 
the rules for its guidance in The Conduct 
of Schools. His purpose was to develop 
the order into a teaching body for the 
poor, and he provided both elementary 
instruction and technical training for com-
-P-A-G-E-118
108 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
mercial and industrial pursuits. Silence 
was observed as far as possible, all 
method was prescribed by rigid rule, but 
corporal punishment gave way to pen- 
ances. Simultaneous teaching of pupils 
arranged in grades was invented by La 
Salle. He followed the Jesuits in de- 
manding special preparation for his 
teachers, and to this end he opened a 
Seminary for Schoolmasters in 1685. 
Though the Brethren are subject to 
criticism for overemphasizing religious 
instruction, they deserve commendation 
for being among the first to give serious 
attention to practical branches, such as 
drawing, history, geography, bookkeep- 
ing, architecture, and physics. 
IV. The educational reformers (innovators) (16th-18th 
centuries). 
A. France. 
1. Francois RABELAIS (1483-1553), the satir- 
ist of scholastic pedantry, the champion 
of the educational fruits of the renais- 
sance, and the forerunner of educational 
reform, wrote the Life of Gargantua and 
Fleroic Deeds of Pantagruel (written 
about 1534-1535), in which he draws a 
graphic contrast in the education of 
Gargantua between the futility of scho- 
lastic educational methods and the wiser 
pedagogy of a natural method with the
-P-A-G-E-119
    
APPENDIX A 109g 
Greek and Latin classics as the basis of 
instruction. Rabelais was the first of 
the school, of educational realists, and 
had an undeniable influence on Mon- 
taigne, Locke, and (indirectly) Rousseau. 
His demands included the use of the 
senses, the influence of nature in early 
training, gradual substitution of an im- 
proved method instead of sudden revo- 
lution (“ Mature does not endure sudden 
changes without great violence.” — Rabe- 
lais), the use of suggestion and emula- 
tion, interest in physical environment, 
open-air exercise, the emphasis of the 
principle of self-activity, and gentle 
measures in discipline, fortified by a 
sympathetic relation between teacher 
and pupil. In a word, naturalism was 
to take the place of pedantry; sympathy 
and understanding, that of harsh sup- 
pression. 
2. MonTAIGNE (1533-1592) wrote the Educa- 
tion of Children. In it he imitates Rab- 
elais in many points, among them being 
his contempt for scholastic pedantry. 
He had come under the influence of the 
renaissance respecting the subject-matter 
of the curriculum, but he took a decided 
step in advance in his advocacy of more 
rational method. He was a realist, as is 
shown by his emphasis of things before 
words, by his appeal for practical results,
-P-A-G-E-120
  IIo HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
and by his hearty recommendation of 
travel. He attributes great importance 
to history and biography as means of 
moral education, and cautions the teacher 
to study and sympathize with child na- 
ture. Language is to be learned by 
actual use rather than grammatical 
rule. The judgment is to be cultivated. 
Many other wise suggestions are urged, 
some of them but a reiteration of posi- 
tions taken by Rabelais. (See /ntroduc- 
tion to Rector’s Montaigne's Education 
of Children, pp. 7-18.) 
3. JEAN JacquEs RoussEau (1712-1778) was 
an apostle of a principle already in the 
minds of some of his predecessors in 
educational reform, but never previously 
so vigorously emphasized nor so consist- 
ently developed, —the principle, namely, 
that nature must play the chief réle in a 
proper scheme of education. This is 
the central theme of the Emile, and by 
it the feasibility of Rousseau’s project of 
educational reform, taken in its entirety, 
must be judged. ousseau lays particu- 
lar stress on the training’ of the senses in 
observation, upon a careful insight into 
child nature, upon starting with the 
pupil’s immediate environment in the 
natural sciences, and on a careful educa- 
tion of girls for the duties of wifehood 
and motherhood. Punishment is to be 
~\
-P-A-G-E-121
  
APPENDIX A Ill 
by the natural consequences, a certain de- 
gree of hardening is recommended, and 
the tutor is to direct and guide the pupil 
with a concealed hand, bringing him un- 
obtrusively into contact with nature in a 
manner that will secure the most benefit. 
During infancy (up to 5) there is to be 
little interference; during childhood (5 
to 12) the vegetative and animal func- 
tions are allowed free scope for devel- 
opment; during boyhood intellectual 
acquisition is to go on and a trade to be 
learned ; and during youth (15 to 20) the 
sentiments, the religious and the ethical 
impulses are to mature. Principles set 
forth by the earlier reformers (especially 
Montaigne and Locke) are in evidence on 
almost every page of the Emile; but the 
exuberance of a vivid and logically un- 
trammeled imagination distorts many 
of them almost past recognition. Rous- 
seau may be classified as both naturalist 
and realist. 
B. England. 
1. RicHARD MuLcAsTER (1531-1611) embod- 
ied the results of a long educational 
experience in two works of considerable 
merit, the Posztions (1581) and the £/e- 
mentarie. Though recognizing three 
stages in education, viz. elementary 
training, the grammar school, and the 
university, he confines his remarks to
-P-A-G-E-122
  
HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the first in the belief that good pedagogi- 
cal methods are most important in the 
formative period. Hesuggests the early 
determination of the child’s natural apti- 
tudes, and instruction with this in view. 
He insists on the supreme importance of 
the mother tongue, and includes drawing 
and music as branches of the early cur- 
riculum. He makes a plea for education 
of girls, and, still more remarkable con- 
sidering his early date, adduces many 
cogent arguments for institutions for the 
professional training of teachers. Alto- 
gether Mulcaster is a fitting herald of a 
new era in education. 
2. Joun Mirton (1608-1674) acknowledges 
the influence of Comenius in his 7vac- 
tate on Education (1644). He criticises 
conditions in the England of his day, 
proposes to reform them by an institu- 
tion which shall embody the whole range 
of education from elementary training 
to university. He defines the purpose 
of education to be “to repair the ruines 
of our first Parents by regaining to know 
God aright.” Studies, exercise, and 
diet are the matters over which education 
is to have jurisdiction. Latin should be 
studied more for its content and less 
from the dry, linguistic standpoint. The 
Italian pronunciation should be used. 
It is largely through the classics that
-P-A-G-E-123
  
APPENDIX A 113 
other branches of the curriculum are to 
be mastered. Physical training is to be 
largely in the open air, and somewhat 
martial in character. Milton is a verbal 
realist. 
3. Joun Locke (1632-1704) published his 
Thoughts concerning Education in 1693. 
He was influenced by Montaigne and in 
turn influenced Rousseau (see Quick’s 
edition of the Thoughts, pp. xlviii-liii 
and Rector’s Montaigne’s Education of 
Children, pp. 13-18). He advocated 
tutorial instruction, and wrote his book 
to bring about reform in the education of 
the English gentleman. He advocated 
the hardening process to extremes. His 
treatment of moral training is in the 
main good, and he makes a plea against 
the severe punishment too often found in 
the schools of his time. Locke devotes 
much attention to the subject of habit, 
as we should expect in view of his theory 
that the mind is at birth like a blank 
sheet of paper, and gets its form entirely 
through experience. Both corporal pun- 
ishment and rewards are unjustifiable. 
Manners are to be inculcated by example. 
There is relatively little that advances 
upon Montaigne in Locke’s suggestions 
regarding intellectual education. Words 
are to be related with things as their 
symbols, —a position which classifies him
-P-A-G-E-124
  1I4 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
among the realists. The English should 
receive the first attention, then French, 
then Latin. He advocated trade edu- 
cation even for the nobility. 
C. Germany. 
1. WoLFGanGc RatKeE (Ratichius; Ratich) 
(1571-1635) does not interest us because 
of his absurd claims to have discovered a 
means of accomplishing unheard-of edu- 
cational results, but because he asserted 
some excellent truths along with much 
that was inexpedient. In his Methodus 
Nova and elsewhere are to be found the 
following principles: 1. Follow nature. 
2. One thing at atime. 3. Assure the 
results by repetition. 4. Use the mother 
tongue as the subject of early instruction 
and in presenting the other branches of 
later instruction. 5. Do not use con- 
straint. 6. Do not learn by rote, but 
train the reasoning powers. 7. Primary 
instruction is a universal right. 8. Teach 
pupils to rely on personal experience 
rather than authority. 9. Rules must 
be verified by examples. 
2. Joun Amos ComeEntus (1592-1670) can 
be compared only to Pestalozzi in his 
influence in determining the theory upon 
which modern elementary education is 
based. This theory is that the child can 
be educated only by bringing him into 
first-hand contact with things, or at least
-P-A-G-E-125
APPENDIX A II5 
with the symbols which come nearest to 
representing them (pictures). It is thus, 
he holds, that the child is to acquire his 
language, which should always be the 
mother tongue first and foremost. Co- 
menius’s most influential works are the 
elementary text-book called Orbis Pictus 
(1657), which associates words, corre- 
sponding pictures, and related ideas in 
a very ingenious way (this is the first 
children’s picture book, —the original of 
the long line of A B C-books and early 
readers which have followed); and the 
book on method called Didactica Magna 
(Great Didactic), published in 1657, 
which gives us in detail his educational 
theory. Education is to begin at birth 
and end at twenty-four. The first six 
years are to be spent in the mother school 
(home), where accurate use of the senses, 
correct speech, and moral lessons are to 
be the pupil’s acquirements. The time 
from seven to twelve is to be devoted to 
the vernacular school (elementary), where 
reading and writing the mother tongue, 
drawing, arithmetic, civil government, 
history, and geography are in the curri- 
culum. From thirteen to eighteen is to 
be devoted to the Latin-school (gymnas- 
ium), where grammar, geometry, astron- 
omy, physics, rhetoric, logic, and ethics 
receive the chief attention. The univer-
-P-A-G-E-126
116 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
sity course is to complete the student’s 
career, offering an education that fits for 
the various professions or provides gen- 
eral culture. Aside from his important 
work in showing the way to proper 
elementary text-books, and in defining 
the broad principles of educational 
organization, we owe to Comenius the 
most lucid enunciation of the method 
and principles of modern elementary 
education made by any of the reformers. 
Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that 
modern elementary education is but the 
expansion and practical application in 
elaborate detail of principles that he 
advocated. The most important of these 
are as follows: 1. Education aims to 
prepare for complete living; hence it 
should be universal. 2. Education 
should follow nature, and be adapted to 
the child’s psychological development. 
3. The condition of the mind depends 
upon that of the body; hence there 
must be provision for physical training. 
4. The mother tongue should be first 
acquired, and then made the medium of 
all other instruction. 5. Nature must 
be studied that the child may learn to use 
his senses properly and to acquire knowl- 
edge at first hand. 6. Since early 
training of the instincts-and habits is of 
supreme importance, the mother must be
-P-A-G-E-127
    
APPENDIX A PE7, 
educated that her early work in this line 
may be good. 7. The curriculum must 
be enriched by practical branches such 
as geography and history. 8. The 
branches must be correlated into a single 
unit of thought (classification, etc.). 
9. Teachers need _ special training. 
10. Schools need better grading and 
supervision. 11. Languages must be 
taught for use, not as the basis of gram- 
matical study. Of these several princi- 
ples the teaching of the mother tongue, 
the use of objects and pictures, and the 
need of school organization and public 
support are the ones that speak most 
prominently of Comenius. It hardly 
need be said that realism was his educa- 
tional creed. Comenius was chiefly 
influenced by Ratke and Bacon, and was 
himself influential either directly or in- 
directly in shaping the views of Francke, 
Rousseau, Milton, Pestalozzi, and Froebel. 
V. Early experiments in educational organization 
dominated by reform principles (18th 
century). 
A, Aucust HERMANN FRANCKE (1663-1727) isa 
unique figure in the history of education 
on account of the remarkable organizing 
ability which he displayed. Convinced 
of the soundness of the main contentions 
of the reformers, and keenly alive to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
118 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
deplorable condition of the poor, he 
started with nothing but his vast energy 
and resourcefulness as a leader, and 
built up a philanthropic educational 
institution which is even to this day a 
monument to his name in the famous 
university town of Halle (Germany). 
Francke began in 1694 with a capital of a 
few thalers which he had collected in 
alms, and built out of this slender pittance 
an establishment hat included.at the 
* time of his death the following: 1. A 
school for the poor. 2.’ A Latin school for 
the more prosperous. 3. A school for 
the nobility called ‘the -Pedagogium. 
4. An orphans’ home. 5. A training 
school for teachers. 
B. Jouann BERNARD BASEDOW (1723-1790) re- 
calls Ratke in the absurdity of his claims 
and his inability to substantiate them. 
He was a disciple of Rousseau’s doctrine 
of naturalistic education, though he did 
not push it to the full logical extreme in 
the way that Rousseau did. After having 
tried the experiment of educating his 
daughter as is suggested in the Emile, he 
inaugurated the experiment in a far more 
elaborate way in the institution given the 
grandiloquent title of Philanthropinum. 
The project soon came to grief, perhaps 
more owing to the unwarrantable claims 
and unsuccessful management of its
-P-A-G-E-129
y 
APPENDIX A 119 
founder than to the inherent unsoundness 
of the principles that it strove to carry 
out. Its service consisted in calling 
attention to the artificial rearing of the 
average child of the better classes, and 
in pointing the way to a practical appli- 
cation of the best teachings of Rousseau. . 
Basedow wrote a Book on Methods, and 
an Elementary Book, in the latter of which 
the influence of Comenius is shown on 
every page. 
VI. Educational reform from the psychological stand- 
point (last quarter of the 18th and first 
half of the 19th centuries). 
A. Joun Henry PeEsratozz1 (1746-1827), to 
whom modern elementary education 
owes its existence, entered upon a 
career dedicated to regenerating the 
peasantry of Switzerland. After try- 
ing to accomplish this result by in- 
dustrial reforms (improved farming, 
industrial school, etc.) with no marked 
success, he came to the conclusion that 
a combination of industrial, moral, and 
intellectual education was best adapted 
to the needs of the poorer classes. As 
an agency for social regeneration su- 
perior even to the school, he deter- 
mined to seek the codperation of the 
home, and when he organized schools 
connected with his various establish-
-P-A-G-E-130
120 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
ments, he planned them after the 
home.~ This central thought is espe- 
cially emphasized in his most influential 
work, the Leonard and Gertrude (1781). 
Pestalozzi began his experimental farm- 
ing at a small estate to which he gave 
the name of Neuhof. The experiment 
lasted from 1771 to about 1775, when 
the farm was converted into an indus- 
trial school in which he began his actual 
teaching. His connection with this 
project covered a span of only five 
years. The eighteen years between 
1780 and 1798 were devoted to author- 
ship on educational subjects. Pestalozzi 
was in charge of the orphanage at Stanz 
during 1798 to 1799, and we see here 
the first traces of the pedagogical 
method which he was later to mature. 
From 1799 to 1804 he was assistant 
in a school at Burgdorf, and here he 
carried out his ideas even to the extent 
of arousing the jealousy of the head- 
master. The best part of his life, that 
in which his most influential work oc- 
curred, was passed at a school at Yver- 
don, established according to his own 
ideas. He taught here from 1805 to 
1825, and was visited by officials from 
Germany and elsewhere, who inspected 
his plans with a view to national adop- 
tion. Pestalozzi was no_ organizer; 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  APPENDIX A 121 
hence we can derive no lessons in 
school administration or school economy 
from him. His work, nevertheless, 
changed the whole face of primary 
education. His supreme purpose was 
to prepare men to be social and moral 
beings. The plain corollary of such any 
educational aim is state provision of 
schools. Another principle for which 
he stood is that the school must have 
about it more of the spirit and atmos- 
phere of the home, less of that of the 
barn. But the reason why Pestalozzi 
is the first of the line of reformers to 
base his contentions on a keen psycho- 
logical insight is that he maintained 
at all’ points, both in theory and in 
practice, that knowledge’ begins in 
sense-impressions (Anschauungen),- and 
develops into general truth through 
mental elaboration. Aside from the 
principles just mentioned, the most 
important are as follows: 1. Connect 
language with sense-objects. 2. Pro- 
ceed from the simple to the complex, 
developing steps that are psychologi- 
cally related. 3. Opportunity must 
be allowed after each step for the 
pupil to assimilate the knowledge. 
4. The pupil’s individuality must be 
preserved. 5. Education should aim 
not to cram the mind with information,
-P-A-G-E-132
122 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
but to develop character and power. 
It will be remarked that none of these 
propositions is absolutely novel. Hence 
Pestalozzi’s claim to our gratitude lies 
not so much in their enunciation, as in 
his having shown the way to their 
concrete application. Comenius and 
Rousseau were perhaps the strongest 
influences in determining Pestalozzi’s 
thinking, but he transcended both be- 
cause of the possession of that rarest 
of endowments, a great and sympa- 
thetic heart which pulsated instinctively 
to the weakness and dependence of 
childhood. 
B. Frieprich WILHELM FROEBEL (1782-1852) 
systematized the educational ideas that 
Pestalozzi had left in more or less chaotic 
form, emphasizing the latter’s theory of 
the connection between the home and 
the school. This he was especially com- 
petent to do not only by reason of native 
fitness for the task, but also because he 
had the unusual opportunity of having 
spent some time as disciple of Pestalozzi 
at Yverdon. Froebel’s mystical philoso- 
phy, expounded in the Education of Man, 
is of less interest to the general student 
of education than his practical work in 
developing the Kindergarten. One con- 
siderable section of this work, however, 
is devoted to a discussion of the topic of
-P-A-G-E-133
  
APPENDIX A 123 
the relationship between the school and 
the family. It is this point, systemati- 
cally developed, and combined with the 
notion that play may be used by the 
teacher as an educative agency, that has 
furnished the groundwork of the whole 
Kindergarten movement. Froebel em- 
ployed certain systematic exercises in 
elaborating his ideas. The so-called gifts 
were devised for the acquirement of 
knowledge, the so-called occupation (in- 
cluding songs and games) for its motor 
expression. Among the former are the 
simple geometric solids (sphere, cube, 
etc.), which aid in analysis, synthesis, 
contrast, etc.; among the latter the 
various forms of mat-weaving. 
C. Jouann Frreprich HERBART (1776-1841) ap- 
plied psychology to the development of 
method. He is hence regarded by many 
as the father of scientific pedagogy. He 
delivered lectures on this subject at the 
University of K6nigsberg, where he 
founded a famous practice-school and 
pedagogicalseminary. Aside from many 
works on psychological and philosophical 
subjects, he wrote a number on educa- 
tion, chief of which is the General 
Pedagogy (Allgemeine Pidagogik). The 
moral side of education is most important 
for Herbart, and to secure the end of 
character or moral will he relies on his
-P-A-G-E-134
124 
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
two fundamental principles of appercep- 
tion and interest. Apperception means 
that the new presentation shall get its ex- 
planation and elucidation by bringing it 
into connection with that part of past 
experience which has some likeness to 
it. As this part of experience is probably 
. that which has greatest interest for one 
(as is shown by the very fact that it per- 
sists), it becomes evident that the new will 
gain meaning and interest (motive-power) 
by this association with the old. 
VII. Famous educators of the 19th century. 
A. Tuomas ARNOLD (1795-1842) became head 
master of Rugby in 1828, and it is his 
work in administration and discipline in 
this famous English public school which 
has brought him prominently before the 
educational world. He expressed his 
educational views in sermons and in 
letters to friends. It was his belief that 
character is fully as much an aim of 
education as letters, and it was this view 
which shaped his administrative policy. 
Though a thorough advocate of the 
English notion that the education of a 
gentleman involves his careful training 
in the classics, he yet maintained that 
the pedantry that too often characterized 
Latin and Greek in the teaching at the 
English public schools should yield to a
-P-A-G-E-135
APPENDIX A 125 
more interesting method. He would 
have geography taught as an adjunct to 
history. Itwas Dr. Arnold’s personality 
that made him a power, and he illustrates 
the need of this rare quality in the 
teacher. 
B. HERBERT SPENCER (1820-1903) was the most 
famous philosophical writer of England 
during the century just passed. Though 
he had little practical knowledge of 
education, either on its theoretical or its 
practical side, he was not backward in 
expressing his disapproval of the state of 
education in England during the middle 
decades of the last century. His contri- 
butions to the literature of education con- 
sist of four essays, originally published as 
magazine articles, and later printed in 
book form under the title, Education, 
Intellectual, Moral, and Physical. The 
most significant of these discussions, 
considering the time that it was written, 
is the first, which attempts to determine 
the relative value of the several branches 
of human knowledge, in order to see 
which should be given the chief place in 
the curriculum. The worth of a thing is 
regarded by Spencer as fixed by its power 
to satisfy human needs. And these needs 
are those which contribute to self-preser- 
vation, which aid in_rearing offspring, 
which minister to social relations, and
-P-A-G-E-136
  126 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
which furnish occupations for leisure, — 
named here in the order of their impor- 
tance. Hence the several branches of 
human knowledge are important as they 
satisfy these needs. The trend of the 
argument is to put the sciences in place 
of the classics, which at one time usurped 
so much of the student’s time. In moral 
education Spencer has some good sug- 
gestions, as when he advocates punish- 
ment by consequences. Nor can one 
quarrel with his views on physical edu- 
cation. Many of the views stated by 
Spencer are now accepted as common- 
places of school economy, and hence his 
work is no longer so influential as it once 
was. Nor can we find much that was 
really original. 
C. Horace Mann (1796-1859) would be gener- 
ally selected as the most prominent figure 
in American education. His work was 
that of a pioneer. His efforts aimed at 
two things, viz. better oganization and 
supervision of the elementary schools, 
and a more efficient and professionally 
trained teaching force. Born in Massa- 
chusetts, the son of poor but upright 
parents, making his graduation from an 
unusually successful college course at 
Brown University by his indomitable 
energy, Horace Mann’s early life sug- 
gests to us the typical American charac-
-P-A-G-E-137
  
APPENDIX A 127 
teristics of self-reliance and self-help. 
He chose law for his profession, and 
soon became interested in public affairs, 
serving from 1827 to 1837 in the Massa- 
chusetts Legislature. As President of 
the Massachusetts Senate during the 
session of 1837, he signed a bill consti- 
tuting a State Board of Education, whose 
duties were to collect returns from 
schools, to study the best methods, and 
to make reports on the condition of pub- 
lic elementary education in the Common- 
wealth, and to suggest means for its 
improvement. Mr. Mann at once be- 
came secretary of this Board, and served 
in this capacity until elected to the 
Lower House of Congress in 1848. It 
is to this period that we are indebted for 
his most significant services to the 
American public school. Mr. Mann’s 
work in Massachusetts had several im- 
portant results: 1. He aroused the 
public toa feeling of the need of schools 
supported by the people for the people. 
2. He pointed to the necessity of the 
expansion of the schools both in num- 
bers and in curriculum. 3. He empha- 
sized the necessity of better organization 
and supervision, and did much to indi- 
cate the lines along which improvement 
was to be made. 4. He helped to edu- 
cate the taxpayer to the idea that it is  
-P-A-G-E-138
128 
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the best economy to provide wisely and 
liberally for public education. 5. He 
called attention to the backward state of 
American schools in methods, as con- 
trasted with contemporary European 
education. 6. Hechampioned the main- 
tenance of special schools for the pro- 
fessional training of teachers, and was 
the chief force in securing the first in 
this country for his native state. 7. He 
was almost a pioneer in creating Ameri- 
ca’s distinctive contribution to educa- 
tional literature, viz. public school re- 
ports. 
D. Henry BarnarpD (1811-1900) was first sec- 
retary of the Connecticut State Board of 
Education. He called together the first 
body of American teachers ever assem- 
bled asa teachers’ institute in 1839. He 
was the first United States Commissioner 
of Education, appointed when the Na- 
_ tional Bureau of Education was estab- 
lished in 1867. But Mr. Barnard’s most 
permanent and widely useful work is 
founding and editing The American 
Journal of Education, founded in 1855, 
and running through thirty-one volumes 
up to 1881. The journal has collected 
and rendered accessible an immense store 
of material, from all sources, and on all 
subjects from history of education to 
method.

APPENDIX B 
SUMMARY OF THE LEADING FACTS IN THE 
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF NEW 
YORK. STATE 
I. In colonial times. 
A. Under the Dutch, the pioneers in elementary 
common school education in America. The 
first official act (1629) related to ways and 
means of supplying a minister and school- 
master. First public school opened in 1633 ; 
a second one in 1652. Private schools also 
flourished during the 17th century. Schools 
supported by gifts, general taxation, and rat- 
able tuition fees. Towns reserved lots for 
school purposes (Flatbush, Brooklyn). 
B. Under the English, the governors, being aristo- 
cratic in training, generally opposed popular 
education. They required, (1) that instruc- 
tion be given in the English tongue, and (2) 
that all licenses to teach be obtained from the 
Archbishop of London, the Archbishop of 
Canterbury, or of themselves. Whatever was 
done for the schools seems to have been the 
result of the Dutch influence. Only three 
legislative acts were passed between 1664 and 
1775, and all these referred to secondary and 
129
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
higher education. King’s College (now Co- 
lumbia University) was founded in 1754. 
II. Under independence and statehood, New York 
claims primacy in two particulars, (1) the 
establishment of the first elementary common 
free schools, and (2) the development of an 
adequate state system of education. The fol- 
lowing agents and factors have been promi- 
nent in both particulars : — 
A. The Board of Regents (of the University of the 
State of New York) was created in 1784 by an 
act reorganizing King’s College. In 1787 the 
duties of the Board were changed and en- 
larged. The Regents’ Examinations began 
in 1828. Examinations in the preliminary 
branches began in 1864; in the advanced 
subjects in 1878. In 1889 the supervision of 
training classes and schools was transferred 
from the Regents to the Department of Public 
Instruction. In 1904 the Board was reor- 
ganized. 
B. Governor George Clinton (1) secured the reor- 
ganization of King’s College and the crea- 
tion of the Board of Regents; (2) obtained 
anact creating the “ Gospeland School Lands” ; 
and (3) secured the passage of an act in 1795, 
appropriating $100,000 annually for five years 
for the support of common schools. This act 
became the corner stone of the state educa- 
tional system. 
C. Governor DeWitt Clinton (1) aided in the found-
-P-A-G-E-141
  
APPENDIX B 131 
ing of the Public School Society in New York, 
and was its first president ; (2) favored legis- 
lation in behalf of the common schools; 
(3) recommended the establishment of a 
teachers’ seminary; (4) advocated the adop- 
tion of the Lancastrian system of instruc- 
tion; and (5) secured an appropriation in 
1827 amounting to $150,000, for the “ Litera- 
ture Fund,” established the same year. 
D. Gideon Hawley, the first State Superintendent 
of Schools (1813-1821), produced order out 
of chaos by providing for the proper manage- 
ment of the school fund, by organizing the 
state into districts for better supervision, by 
lengthening the school year, by increasing 
the school attendance, and by setting in 
motion the intricate machinery of the State 
School System. 
E. Extent and manner of supervision. 
1812 — office of State Superintendent and Town 
Commissioner of Gommon Schools created. 
1814 — inspectors from among the citizens ap- 
pointed to aid Town Commissioner. 
1821— State Superintendency abolished and 
duties performed by the Secretary of State. 
1841 —deputy-superintendents (later called 
county superintendents) created. 
1843 —town commissioners and _ inspectors 
abolished and Town Superintendent of Schools 
created. 
1847 — county superintendents abolished. 
1854 — Department of Public Instruction estab-

lished, the executive officer being the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
1856—town superintendents abolished and 
commissioners reéstablished. 
1904 — Department of Public Instruction abol- 
ished, and a State Board of Education and 
office of Commissioner of Education estab- 
lished. 
School funds. 
1. The Permanent School Fund, founded in 
1805, obtained from the sale of public lands, 
etc. 
2. The Literature Fund, established in 1827, 
maintained by annual appropriations by the 
State Legislature. 
3. The United States Deposit Fund, established 
during Jackson’s administration as President. 
New York’s share was $4,014,520.71. 
4. Free School Fund (money raised by public 
taxation), established about 1867. 
Professional preparation of teachers. 
1826 — Teachers’ Seminary recommended by 
Governor DeWitt Clinton. 
1827 —establishment ,of the Literature Fund 
for the preparation of teachers. 
1834— Regents authorized to expend part of 
Literature Fund, resulting in the establish- 
ment of “training classes.” 
1843 —first State Teachers’ Institute held at 
Ithaca. 
1844 — first State Normal School opened at Al- 
bany (became State Normal College in 1890).  
-P-A-G-E-143
APPENDIX B 133 
1863 — Oswego Normal School opened. 
1870— New York Normal College opened. 
1889—training classes transferred from the 
Board of Regents to the Department of Public 
Instruction. 
1904 —training schools put in charge of the 
Third Deputy Commissioner of Education.

Leonard and Gertrude 
Principal characters of the story and what they typify. 
A. Gertrude: the idea that socialj reform is to spring from 
woman's activity within the sphere of the home. 
&. Leonard: the idea that a naturally weak moral character 
may gather strength from feminine influence, even though 
the bonds of habit are pretty well forged. 
C. Leonard and Gertrude’s children: the influence of good 
moral instruction on the young. 
D. Arner: the beneficent arm of just government mitigating 
the hardships of the poor. 
£. Hummel: the element of evil in human society and the 
harm it does. 
Scene: the village of Bonnal typifies human society, first in the 
state in which Pestalozzi found it, and second, after re- 
generation through industry, moral order, and practical 
education.

A. Culture (ornamental) vs. utility, pp. 1-12. 
B. Order of value of kinds of knowledge: self-preservation 
(13-27); gaining a livelihood (27-39); rearing of off- 
spring (40-51) ; citizenship (51-59) ; ornamental knowl- 
edge (59-63). 
C. Supreme value of science, pp. 63-87. 
II. The question of method (problem of pedagogical procedure). 
A. Contemporary methods criticised, pp. 88-101. 
B. Value of the following Pestalozzian principles: simple to 
complex (115); concrete to abstract (116-117) ; race de- 
velopment in knowledge the cue to individual’s develop- 
ment (117-119) ; empirical to rational (119-120) ; educa- 
tion to be by self-development, ze. self-instruction or 
self-evolution (120-122, 155-157); pleasurable excite- 
ment of happy activity in the pupil (122-124, 157-161). 
C. Order of education in infancy and early childhood: sense- 
culture (124-128) ; object-lessons and observation (128- 
138) ; drawing (138-147); elementary geometry (147- 
153). III. Moral education (Ch. III), emphasizing natural as opposed to 
artificial punishment (punishment by consequences).

        INTRODUCTION. 
EAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU’S book on education has had a 
powerful influence throughout Europe, and even in the New 
World. It was in its day a kind of gospel. It had its share in 
bringing about the Revolution which renovated the entire aspect 
of our country. Many of the reforms so lauded by it have since 
then been carried into effect, and at this day seem every-day 
affairs. In the eighteenth century they were unheard-of daring; 
they were mere dreams. 
Long before that time the immortal satirist Rabelais, and, after 
him, Michael Montaigne, had already divined the truth, had 
pointed out serious defects in education, and the way to reform, 
No one followed out their suggestions, or even gave them a 
hearing. Routine went on its way. Exercises of memory,—the 
science that consists of mere words,— pedantry, barren and vain- 
glorious,—held fast their “bad eminence.” The child was treated 
as a machine, or as a man in miniature, no account being taken 
of his nature or of his real needs; without any greater solici- 
tude about reasonable method — the hygiene of mind — than’ 
about the hygiene of the body. :

  2 INTRODUCTION. 
This romance, when it appeared in 1762, created a great noise 
and a great scandal. The Archbishop of Paris, Christophe de 
Beaumont, saw in it a dangerous, mischievous work, and gave 
himself the trouble of writing a long encyclical letter in order 
to point out the book to the reprobation of the faithful. This 
document of twenty-seven chapters is a formal refutation of the 
theories advanced in “Emile.” 
{The archbishop declares that the plan of education proposed 
by the author, “far from being in accordance with Christianity, 
is not fitted to form citizens, or even onl He accuses Rous- 
seau of irreligion and of bad faith ;) he denounces him to the 
temporal power as animated “by 4 spirit of insubordination 
and of revolt.” He sums up by solemnly condemning the book 
“as containing an abominable doctrine, calculated to overthrow 
natural, law, and to destroy the foundations of the Christian 
eligion} establishing maxims contrary to Gospel morality; hav- 
Ung a tendency to disturb the peace of empires, to stir up sub-- 
jects to revolt against their sovereign; as containing a great 
number of propositions respectively false, scandalous, full of ha- 
tred toward the Church and its ministers, derogating from the 
respect due to Holy Scripture and the traditions of the Church, 
erroneous, impious, blasphemous, and heretical.” 
In those days, such a condemnation was a serious matter; its 
onsequences to an author might be terrible. Rousseau _had 
barely time to flee. His arrest was decreed by the parliament 
of Paris, and his book was burned by the executioner. A few 
fears before this, the author would have run the risk of being 
rea with his book. 
‘As a fugitive, Rousseau did not find a safe retreat even in 
his own country. He was obliged to leave Geneva, where his 
book was also condemned, and Berne, where he had sought

refuge, but whence he was driven by intolerance. He owed it 
to the protection of Lord Keith, governor of Neufchatel, a 
principality belonging to the King of Prussia, that he lived for 
some time in peace in the little town of Motiers in the Val de 
Travers. 
It was from this place that he replied to the archbishop of 
Paris by an apology, a long-winded work in which he repels, 
one after another, the imputations of his accuser, and sets forth 
anew with greater urgency his philosophical and religious prin- 
ciples. This work, written on a rather confused plan but with 
impassioned eloquence, manifests a lofty and sincere spirit. It 
is said that the archbishop was deeply touched by it, and never 
afterward spoke of the author of «“Bmile” without extreme . 
reserve, sometimes even eulogizing his character and his virtues. 
The renown of the book, condemned by so high an authority, 
was immense. ZScandal, by attracting public attention to it, 
did it good service. What was most serious and most sugges- 
tive in it was not, perhaps, seized upon; but the “craze” of 
which it was the object had, notwithstanding, good results. 
Mothers were won over, and resolved to nurse their own infants; 
great lords began to learn handicrafts, like Rousseau’s imagi- 
nary pupil; physical exercises came into fashion; the spirit of 
innovation was forcing itself a way. 
It was not among ourselves, however, that the theories of 
Rousseau were most eagerly experimented upon; it was among 
foreigners, in Germany, in Switzerland, that they found more 
resolute partisans, and a field more ready to receive’ them. 
Three men above all the rest are noted for having popularized 
the pedagogic method of Rousseau, and for having been inspired » 
in_their labors by « Emile. » These were Basedow, Pestalozzi, 
and Froebel. 
 
-P-A-G-E-4
    4 INTRODUCTION. 
‘| Basedow, a German theologian, had devoted himself entirely 
to dogmatic controversy, until the reading of “Emile” had the 
effect of enlarging his mental horizon, and of revealing to him 
his true vocation. He wrote important books to show how 
Rousseau’s method could be applied in different departments of 
instruction, and founded at Dessau, in 1774, an institution to 
bring that method within the domain of experience. ( 
This institution, to which he gave the name of “ Philanthro- 
pinum,” was secular in the drue sense of the word; and at that 
time this was in itself a novelty. It was open to pupils of 
every belief and every nationality, and proposed to render study 
easy, pleasant, and expeditious to them, by following the direc- 
tions of nature itself. In the first rank of his disciples may 
be placed Campé, who succeeded him in the management of the 
Philanthropinum. 
Pestalozzi of Ziirich, one of the foremost educators of modern 
times, also found his whole life transformed by the reading of 
“Emile,” which awoke in him the genius of a reformer. He 
himself also, in 1775, founded a school, in order to put in 
practice there his progressive and professional method of teach- 
ing, which was a fruitful development of seeds sown by Rous- 
seau in his book. Pestalozzi left numerous writings, —romances, 
treatises, reviews, —all having for sole object the popularization 
of his ideas and processes of education. The most distin- 
guished among his disciples and continuators is Froebel, the 
founder of those primary schools or asylums known by the 
name of “kindergartens,” and the author of highly esteemed 
pedagogic works. 
These various attempts, these new and ingenious processes 
which, step by step, have made their way among us, and are 
beginning to make their workings felt, even in institutions most

stoutly opposed to progress, are all traceable to Rousseau’s 
“Emile.” ” 
It is therefore not too much for Frenchmen, for teachers, 
for parents, for every one in our covy* who is interested in 
what concerns teaching, to go bac¢« to the source of so great a 
ovement. : 
(Tt is true that “Kmile” contains pages that have outlived 
their day, many odd precepts, many false ideas, many disputable 
and destructive theories; but at the same time we find in it so 
many sagacious observations, such upright counsels, suitable 
even to modern times, so lofty an ideal, that, in spite of every- 
thing, we cannof read and study it without profit.) There is no 
one who does not know the book by name and by reputation ; 
but how many parents, and even teachers, have never read it! 
This is because a large part of the book is no longer in 
accordance with the actual condition of things; because its very 
plan, its fundamental idea, are outside of the truth. We are 
obliged to exercise judgment, to make selections. Some of it 
must be taken, some left untouched. This is what we have 
done in the present edition. 
We have not, indeed, the presumption to correct Rousseau, or 
to substitute an expurgated “Emile” for the authentic “Emile.” 
We have simply wished to draw the attention of the teachers 
of childhood to those pages of this book which have least grown 
old, which can still be of service, can hasten the downfall of the 
old systems, can emphasize, by their energy and beauty of lan- 
guage, methods already inaugurated and reforms already under- 
taken. These methods and’ reforms cannot be too often recom- 
mended and set in a clear light. We have desired to call to 
the rescue this powerful and impassioned writer, who brings to 
bear upon every subject he approaches the magical attractiveness 
of his style.

     ® INTRODUCTION. 
‘ There is absolutely nothing practicable in his system. It con- 
sists in isolating a child from the rest of the worla; in creating 
  expressly for him a tutor, who is a phcenix among his kind; 
in depriving him of father, mother, brothers, and sisters, his 
companions in study; in surrounding him with a perpetual char- 
     
                                    
       
   latanism, under the pretext of following nature; and in showing 
him only through the veil of a factitious atmosphere the society 
in which he is to live. And, nevertheless, at each step it is 
sound reason by which we are met; by an astonishing paradox, 
this whimsicality is full of good sense; this dream overflows 
with realities; this improbable and chimerical romance contains 
the substance and the marrow of a rational and truly modern 
treatise on pedagogy. Sometimes we must read between the 
lines, add what experience has taught us since that day, trans- 
pose into an atmosphere of open democracy these pages, written 
under the old order of things, but even then quivering with the 
new world which they were bringing to light, and for which 
they prepared the way. 
Reading “Emile” in the light of modern prejudices, we can 
see in it more than the author wittingly put into it; but not 
more than logic and the instinct of genius set down there. 
“To unfold the powers of children in due proportion to their 
ge; not to transcend their ability; to arouse in them the sense 
of the observer and of the pioneer;. to make them discoverers 
rather than imitators; to teach them accountability to them- 
selyes and not slavish dependence upon the words of others; to 
address ourselves more to the will than to custom, to the reason 
(rather than to the memory; to substitute for verbal recitations 
\ lessons about things; to lead to theory by way of art; to assign

4 principles scattered broadcast in this book, and forming a happy 
counterpoise to the oddities of which Rousseau was perhaps most 
| proud. 
‘He takes the child in its cradle, almost before its birth; he 
desires that mothers should fulfil the sacred duty of nursing 
them at the breast. If there must be a nurse, he knows how 
to choose her, how she ought to be treated, how she should be 
fed. He watches over the movements of the new-born child, 
over its first playthings. All these counsels bear the stamp of 
good sense and of experience; or, rather, they result from a 
power of divination singular enough in a man who was not 
willing to take care of his own children. In this way, day 
by day, he follows up the physical and moral development of 
the little being, all whose ideas and feelings he analyzes, whom 
he guides with wisdom and with tact throughout the mazes of 
a life made up of convention and artifice. 
We have carefully avoided suppressing the fictions of the 
gardener and of the mountebank; because they are characteristic 
of his manner, and because, after all, these pre-arranged scenes 
which, as they stand, are anything in the world rather than 
real teaching, contain, nevertheless, right notions, and opinions 
which may suggest to intelligent teachers processes in prudent 
education.. Such teachers will not copy the form; they will 
not imitate the awkward clap-trap; but, yielding to the inspi- 
ration. of the dominant idea, they will, in a way more in 
accordance with nature, manage to thrill with life the teaching 
of facts, and will aid the mind in giving birth to, ‘its ideas.

within the domain of pedagogy. They contain admirable pages, 
which ought to be read; which occupy one of the foremost 
places in our literature; which deal with philosophy, with 
ethics, with theology; but they concern themselves with the 
manner of directing young men and women, and no longer 
with childhood. The author conducts his Emile even as far as 
to his betrothal; he devotes an entire book to the betrothed 
herself, Sophie, and closes his volume only after he has united 
them in marriage. | 
We will not go so far. We will leave Emile upon the con- 
fines of youth, at the time when he escapes from school, and 
when he is about beginning to feel that he is a man. At this 
difficult and critical period the teacher no longer suffices. Then, 
above all things, is needed all the influence of the family; the 
father’s example, the mother’s clear-sighted tenderness, worthy 
friendships, an environment of meritorious people, of upright 
minds animated by lofty ideas, who attract within their orbit 
this ardent and inquisitive being, eager for novelty, for action, 
and for independence. 
Artifices and stratagems are then no longer good for any- 
thing; they are very soon laid open to the light. All that 
can be required of a teacher is that he shall have furnished 
his pupils with a sound and strong education, drawn from the 
sources of reason, experience, and nature; that he shall have 
prepared them to learn to form judgments, to make use of 
i faculties, to enter valiantly upon study and upon life. It 
‘seems to us that the pages of Rousseau here published may be 
vf a useful guide in the pursuit of such a result.

  TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. 
JULES STEEG has rendered a real service to 
* French and American teachers by his judicious 
selections from Rousseau’s Emile. For the three-volume 
novel of a hundred years ago, with its long disquisitions and 
digressions, so dear to the heart of our patient ancestors, 
is now distasteful to all but lovers of the curious in books. 
«<Fimile” is like an antique mirror of brass ; it reflects the 
features of educational humanity no less faithfully than one 
of more modern construction. In these few pages will be 
found the germ of all that is useful in present systems of 
education, as well as most of the ever-recurring mistakes of 
well-meaning zealots. 
The eighteenth century translations of this wonderful 
book have for many readers the disadvantage of an Eng- 
lish style long disused. It is hoped that. this attempt at a 
new translation may, with all its defects, have the one 
merit of being in the dialect of the nineteenth century, and 
may thus reach a wider circle of readers.

especially of early infancy; of the first years of life; of the care to 
be bestowed upon very young children; of the nursing of them; of 
laws of health. 
Ci: makes education begin at birth; expresses himself on the sub- - 
ject of the habits to be given or to be avoided; discusses the use and 
meaning of tears, outcries, gestures, also the language that should 
be used with young children, so that, from their tenderest years, 
the inculcating of false ideas and the giving a wrong bent of mind 
may be avoided. 
GENERAL REMARKS. 
The Object of Hducation. 
       
  OMING from the hand of the Author of all things, 
everything is good; in the hands of man, everything 
egenerates. Man obliges one soil to nourish the productions 
of another, one tree to bear the fruits of another; he mingles 
and confounds climates, elements, seasons; he mutilates his 
dog, his horse, his slave. He overturns everything, disfig- 
“~ures everything; he loves deformity, monsters; he desires 
that nothing should be as nature made it, not even man him- 
self. To please him, man must be broken in like a horse; 
an must be adapted-to man’s own fashion, like a tree in 
iis garden." 
1 Tt is useless to enlarge upon the absurdity of this theory, and upon the 
flagrant contradiction into which Rousseau allows himself to fall. If he is

Were it not for all this, matters would be still worse. No 
one wishes to be a half-developed being; and in the present 
condition of things, a man left to himself among others from 
his birth would be the most deformed among them all. 
Prejudices, authority, necessities, example, all the social 
institutions in which we are submerged, would stifle nature 
in him, and would put nothing in its place. In such a man 
nature would be like a shrub sprung up by chance in the 
midst of a highway, and jostled from all sides, bent in every 
| direction, by the passers-by. - 
V€ Plants are improved by cultivation, and men by education, 
If man were born large and strong, his size and strength 
would be useless to him until he had learned to use them. 
They would be prejudicial to him, by preventing others from 
- thinking of assisting him ; and left to himself he would die of 
wretchedness before he had known his own necessities. We 
pity the state of infancy; we do not perceive that the human 
race would have perished if man had not begun by being a 
child. 
e are born weak, we need strength; we are born dosti) 
tute of all things, we need assistance ; we are born stupid, ‘ 
e need judgment. All that we have not at our birth, and 
that we need when grown up} is | given “us by education. 
r This education comes to us from nature itself, or from 
“other men, or from circumstances. (The internal develop- 
ment of our faculties and of our organs is the education 
nature gives us; the use we are taught to make-of this devel-, 
fusca is the education ‘we get from other ‘men; and what 
we learn, by our own experience, about things that interest 
us, is the education of circumstances. : \ 
right, man ought to be left without education, and the earth without eultt- 
vation. This would not be even the savage state. But want of space forbids 
us to pause at each like statement of our author, who at once busies iene 
in nullifying it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
THE OBJECT OF EDUCATION. 13° ky / 
Each of us is therefore formed by three kinds of tiactewl, 
The pupil in whom their different_lessons_contradict_one a 
another is badly ¢ lncated, at and will never be in harmony with _ 
himself ; the one in whom they all touch upon the same 
points | and tend toward the same object..advances toward 
that_goal only, and lives accordingly. He alone is well edu- 
cated. 
Now of these three different educations, that of nature does 
not depend upon us; that of circumstances depends upon us 
only in certain respects; that of men is the only one of 
which we are really masters, and that solely because we 
think we are. <For who can hope to direct entirely the oo ; 
and conduct of all who surround a child? 
As soon, therefore, as education becomes an art, its suc- 
cess is almost impossible, since the agreement of circum- 
stances necessary to this success is independent of personal 
effort. All that the utmost care can do is to approach 
more or less nearly our object; but, for attaining it, special 
good fortune is needed. 
What is this object? That of nature itself, as has just . 
been proved. Since the agreement of the three educations 
is necessary to their perfection, it is toward the one for which 
we ourselves can do nothing that we must direct both the 
others. But perhaps this word ‘‘nature’’? has too vague a 
meaning ; we must here try to define it. ; 
In the natural order of things, all men being equal, the~ 
yocation common to all is the state of manhood ; and who- 
ever is well trained for that, cannot fulfil badly any vocation 
which depends upon it. Whether my pupil be destined 
for the army, the church, or the bar, matters little to me.

14 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
C not, I admit, be a magistrate, a soldier, or a priest; first of 
all_he will be-a-man. All that a man ought to be he can 
be, at need, as well as any one else can. Fortune will in 
vain alter his position, for he will always occupy his own. 
Our real study is that of the state of man. He among us 
who best knows how to bear the good and evil fortunes of | 
- his life is, in my opinion, the best educated ; whence it fol- 
ows that true education consists less in precept than in prac-\) 
tice. We begin to instruct ourselves when we begin to live i} 
ur education commences with the commencement of our 
life; our first teacher is our nurse. For this reason the word 
“education” had among the ancients another meaning which 
we no longer attach to it; it signified nutriment. 
We must then take a broader view of things, and consider 
in our pupil man in the abstract, man exposed to all the acci- 
dents of human life. If man were born attached to the soil 
of a country, if the same season continued throughout the 
.year, if every one held his fortune by such a tenure that he 
could never change it, the established customs of to-day 
would be in certain respects good. The child educated for 
his position, and never leaving it, could not be exposed to the 
inconveniences of another. 
But seeing that human affairs are changeable, seeing the 
restless and disturbing spirit of this century, which over- 
turns everything once in a generation, can a more senseless 
method be imagined than to educate a child as if he were 
never to leave hisroom, as if he were obliged to be constantly 
surrounded by his servants? If the poor creature takes but 
one step on the earth, if he comes down so much as one stair, 
he isruined. This is not teaching him to endure pain; it is. 
training him to feel it more keenly. 
We think only of preserving the child: this is not enoug! 
We ought to teach him to preserve himself when he is a man;

ness ; to live, if need be, among the snows of Iceland or upon * 
the burning rock of Malta. In vain you take precautions 
against his dying,—he must die after all; and if his death be 
not indeed the result of those very precautions, they are none / Be 
the less mistaken. It is less important to keep him from *~ 
dying than it is to teach him how to live. To live is not_ 
merely to breathe, it is to act. It is to make use of our 
organs, of our senses, of our faculties, of all the powers 
which bear witness to us of our own existence. He who has 
lived most..is..not..he.who-has-numbered..the.most..years, but 
he who has. been most. ‘truly conscious of what life is> A man 
may have himself buried at the age of a hundred years, who 
died from the hour of his birth. He would have gained 
something by going to his grave in youth, if up to that time 
he had only lived. 
The Now-born Child. 
Tue new-born child needs to stretch and to move his limbs 
so as to draw them out of the torpor in which, rolled into a 
ball, they have so long remained. We do stretch his limbs, 
it is true, but we prevent him from moving them. We even 
constrain his head into a baby’s cap. It seems as if we were 
afraid he might appear to be alive. The inaction, the con- 
straint in which we keep his limbs, cannot fail to interfere 
with the circulation of the blood and of the secretions, to 
prevent the child from growing strong and sturdy, and to 
his constitution. In regions where these extravagant 
precautions are not taken, the men are all large, strong, and 
roportioned. Countries in which childrén are swaddled 
with hunchbacks, with cripples, with persons crook- 
tunted, rickety, deformed in all kinds of ways. For 
i the bodies of children may be deformed by free

aco 16 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
movements, we hasten to deform them by putting them into 
a press. Of our own accord we cripple them to prevent 
(their laming themselves. 
Must not such a cruel constraint have an influence upon 
‘their temper as well as upon their constitution? Their first 
feeling is a feeling of constraint and of suffering. To all 
their necessary movements they find only obstacles. More un- 
fortunate than chained criminals, they make fruitless efforts, 
they fret themselves, they cry. Do you tell me that the first 
sounds they make are cries? I can well believe it; you 
thwart them from the time they are born. The first gifts 
they receive from you are chains, the first treatment they 
/ undergo is torment. Having nothing free but the voice, why 
should they not use it in complaints? They cry on account 
of the suffering you cause them; if you were pinioned in the 
same way, your own cries would be louder. 
Whence arises this unreasonable custom of swaddling ebil- 
dren? From an unnatural custom. Since the time when 
mothers, despising their first duty, no longer wish to nurse 
their own children at the breast, it has been necessary to in- 
trust the little ones to hired women. These, finding them- 
selves in this way the mothers of strange children, con- 
cerning whom the voice of nature is silent to them, seek 
only to spare themselves annoyance. <A child at liberty 
would require incessant watching; but after he is wel! 
swaddled, they throw him into a corner without troubling 
themselves at all on account of his cries. Provided there are 
no proofs of the nurse’s carelessness, provided that the 
nursling does not break his legs or his arms, what does it 
matter, after all, that he is pining away, or that he continues 
feeble for the rest of his life? His limbs are preserved ah 
the expense of his life, and whatever happens, the nurse is _ 
held free from blame.

   THE NEW-BORN CHILD. 
It is pretended that children, when left free, may put them- 
selves into bad positions, and make movements liable to 
injure the proper conformation of their limbs. This is one 
of the weak arguments of our false wisdom, which no experi- 
ence has ever confirmed. Ofthat multitude of children who, 
among nations more sensible than ourselves, are brought up 
in the full freedom of their limbs, not one is seen to wound 
or lame himself. They cannot give their” movements force 
enough to make them dangerous; and when they assume a 
hurtful position, pain soon warns them to change it. 
We have not yet brought ourselves to the point of swad- 
dling puppies or kittens ; do we see that any inconvenience 
results to them from this negligence? Children are heavier, 
indeed; but in proportion they are weaker. They can 
scarcely move themselves at all; how can they lame them- 
selves? If laid upon the back they would die in that 
position, like the tortoise, without being able ever to turn 
themselves again. 
[This want of intelligence in the care bestowed upon young chil- 
dren is seen particularly in those mothers who give themselves no 
concern about their own, do not themselves nurse them, intrust 
them to hireling nurses. This custom is fatal to all; first to the 
children and finally to families, where barrenness becomes the rule, 
where woman sacrifices to her own convenience the joys and the 
duties of motherhood.] 
Would you recall every one to his highest duties? Begin 
with the mothers ; you will be astonished at the changes you 
will effect. From this first depravity all others come in suc- 
cession. The entire moral order is changed ; natural feeling 
is extinguished in all hearts. Within our homes there is 
less cheerfulness ; the touching sight of a growing family 
no longer attaches the husband or attracts the attention 
of strangers. The mother whose children are not seen is

exhibition of maternal tenderness. This affectation died out, but in most 
families the good and wholesome custom of motherhood was retained.

from the outset we are beyond the pale of nature. 
There is an opposite way by which a woman goes beyond 
it; that is, when, instead of neglecting a mother’s cares, she 
. carries them to excess; when she makes her child her idol. 
She increases and fosters his weakness to prevent him 
from feeling it. Hoping to shelter him from the laws of na- 
ture, she wards from him shocks of pain. She does not 
consider how, for the sake of preserving him for a mo- 
ment from some inconveniences, she is heaping upon his 
head future accidents and perils; nor how cruel is the cau- 
tion which prolongs the weakness of childhood in one who 
must bear the fatigues of a grown-up man. The fable says 
that, to render her son invulnerable, Thetis plunged him into 
the Styx. This allegory is beautiful and clear. The cruel 
mothers of whom I am speaking do far otherwise; by plung- 
ing their children into effeminacy they open their pores to 
ills of every kind, to which, when grown up, they fall a cer- 
tain prey. 
Watch nature carefully, and follow the paths she traces out 
for you. She gives children continual exercise ; she strength- 
ens their constitution by ordeals of every kind; she teaches 
them early what pain and trouble mean. The cutting of 
their teeth gives them fever, sharp fits of colic throw them 
into convulsions, long coughing chokes them, worms torment 
them, repletion corrupts their blood, different leayens fer- 
menting there cause dangerous eruptions. Nearly the whole 
of infancy is sickness and danger; half the children born 
into the world die before their eighth year. These trials 
past, the child has gained strength, and as soon as he 
tan use life, its principle becomes more assured.

This is the law of nature. Why do you oppose her? Do you 
not see that in thinking to correct her you destroy her work 
‘and coxinteract the effect of all her cares? In your opinion, 
to do without what she is doing within is to redouble the 
_ danger. On the contrary, it is really to avert, to mitigate 
that danger. Experience teaches that more children who are 
delicately reared die than others. Provided we do not ex- 
ceed the measure of their strength, it is better to employ it 
than to hoard it. Give them practice, then, in the trials they 
will one day have to endure. Inure their bodies to the 
inclemencies of the seasons, of climates, of elements; to 
hunger, thirst, fatigue; plunge them into the water of the 
Styx. Before the habits of the body are acquired we can 
give it such as we please without risk. But when once 
it has reached its full vigor, any alteration is perilous to 
its well-being. A child will endure changes which a man 
could not bear. ‘The fibres of the former, soft and plia- 
ble, take without effort the bent we give them; those of 
man, more hardened, do not without violence change those 
they have received. We may therefore make a child robust 
without exposing his life or his health; and even if there 
were some risk we still ought not to hesitate. Since there 
are risks inseparable from human life, can we do better than 
to throw them back upon that period of life when they are 
least disadvantageous ? 
A child becomes more precious as he sibs in age. 
_To the value of his person is added that of the cares he has 
\ cost us; if we lose his life, his own consciousness of death is 
added to our sense of loss. Above all things, then, in watch- 
ing over his preservation we must think of the future. We 
must arm him against the misfortunes of youth before he has 
reached them. For, if the value of life increases up to the 
age when life becomes useful, what folly it is to spare the child

some troubles, and to heap them upon the age of reason! 
Are these the counsels of a master? 
In all ages suffering is the lot of man. Even to the cares 
of self-preservation pain is joined. Happy are we, who in 
childhood are acquainted with only physical misfortunes— 
misfortunes far less cruel, less painful than others; misfor- 
~ tunes which far more rarely make us renounce life. We do 
not kill ourselves on account of the pains of gout; seldom do 
any but those of the mind produce despair.’ 
We pity the lot of infancy, and it is our own lot that we 
ought to pity. Our greatest misfortunes come to us from ; 
ourselves. 
At birth a child cries ; his earliest infancy is spent in ery- 
ing. Sometimes he is tossed, he is petted, to appease him ; 
sometimes he is threatened, beaten, to make him keep quiet. 
We either do as he pleases, or else we exact from him what 
we please; we either submit to his whims, or make him sub- 
mit toours. There is no middle course; he must either give 
or receive orders. Thus his first ideas are those of absolute 
rule and of slavery. Before he knows how to speak, he 
commands ; before he is able to act, he obeys; and some- 
times he is punished before he knows what his faults are, or 
rather, before he is capable of committing them. Thus do 
we early pour into his young heart. the passions that are 
aiterward imputed to nature; au, after having taken pains 
to make him wicked, we complain of finding him wicked. 
A child passes six or seven years of his life in this manner 
in the hands of women, the victim of his own caprice and of 
theirs. After having made him learn this and that,—after 
1This remark is not a just one. How often have we seen unhappy 
creatures disgusted with life because of some dreadful and incurable mal- 
ady? It is true that suicide, being an act of madness, is more frequently

up to the point of insanity.

having loaded his memory either with words he cannot under- 
stand, or with facts which are of no use to him,—after having 
stifled his natural disposition by the passions we have created,

his unfitness, by his pride, and by all his vices, makes us de- 
plore human wretchedness and perversity. We deceive our- 
selves; this is the man our whims have created. Nature 
makes men by a different process. 
Do you then wish him to preserve his original form? 
Preserve it from the moment he enters the world. As soon as 
he is born take possession of him, and do not leave him until 
he isa man. Without this you will never succeed. As the 
mother is the true nurse, the father is the true teacher. 
Let them be of one mind as to the order in which their func- 
tions are fulfilled, as well as in regard to their plan; let the 
child pass from the hands of the one into the hands of the 
other. He will be better educated by a father who is judi- 
cious, even though of moderate attainments, than by the 
most skilful master in the world. For zeal will supple-

his task. To the human race he owes men; to society, men 
fitted for society; to the State, citizens. Every man who

  CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
The Harliest Education. 
Children’s first impressions are purely those of feeling; 
they perceive only pleasure and pain. Unable either to 
move about, or to grasp anything with their hands, they 
need a great deal of time to form sensations which represent, 
and so make them aware of objects outside of themselves. 
But, during all this time, while these objects are extending, 
and, as it were, receding from their eyes, assuming, to them, 
form and dimension, the constantly recurring sensations 
begin to subject the little creatures to the sway of habit. We 
see their eyes incessantly turning toward the light; and, if it 
comes to them from one side, unwittingly taking the direc- 
tion of that side; so that their faces ought to be carefully 
turned toward the light, lest they become squint-eyed, or 
accustom themselves to look awry. They should, also, early 
accustom themselves to darkness, or else they will cry and 
scream as soon as they are left inthe dark. Food and sleep, 
if too exactly proportioned, become necessary to them after 
the lapse of the same intervals; and soon the desire arises 
not from necessity, but from habit. Or rather, habit adds a 
new want to those of nature, and this must be prevented. 
The only habit.a.child.should be.allowed-to-form is.to.con- 
t no habits whateyer..Let him not be carried upon one 
more than upon another; let him not be accustomed to     
him for this. The ideal of those who assume the noble and difficult office 
of a teacher of childhood cannot be placed too high. As to the pupil, 
Rousseau imagines a child of average ability, in easy circumstances, and of 
robust health. He makes him an only son and an orphan, so that no fam- 
ily vicissitudes may disturb the logic of his plan. 
All this may be summed up by saying that he considers the child in him- 
self with regard to his individual development, and without regard to his 
relations to ordinary life. This at the same time renders his task easy, and 
deprives him of an important element of education.

  put forth one hand rather than the other, or to use it oftener; 
nor to desire to eat, to sleep, to act in any way, at regular 
hours ; nor to be unable to stay alone either by night or by 
day. Prepare long beforehand for the time when he shall 
freely use all his strength. Do this by leaving his body 
under the control of its natural bent, by fitting him to be 
: always master of himself, and to carry out his own will in 
*” everything as soon as he has a will of his own. 
-— Since the only _kinds-of- “objects presented to him are likely 
to make him either timid or courageous, why should not his 
eaten begin before he speaks or understands? I would 
abituate him to seeing new objects, though they be ugly, 
repulsive, or singular. But let this be by degrees, and from 
a distance, until he has become accustomed to them, and, 
from seeing them handled by others, shall at last handle 
< himself. If during his infancy he has seen without * 
ear frogs, serpents, crawfishes, he will, when grown up, see 
‘without shrinking any animal that may be shown him. For 
one who daily sees frightful objects, there are none such. 
All children are afraid of masks. I begin by showing 
Emile the mask of a pleasant face. By and by some one 
puts the mask upon his own face, so that the child can see 
it. I begin to laugh; every one else laughs, and the child 
with the rest. By degrees I familiarize him with less comely 
masks, and finally with really hideous ones. If I have man- 
aged the process well, he will, far from being frightened at 
the last mask, laugh at it as he laughed at the first. After 
that, I shall not fear his being frightened by any one with a 
mask. 
When, in the farewell scene between Hector and Andro- 
mache; the little Astyanax, terrified at the plume floating 
from a helmet, fails to recognize his father, throws himself, 
crying, upon his nurse’s breast, and wins from his mother a

smile bright with tears, what ought to be done to soothe his 
. fear? Precisely what Hector does. He places the helmet 
> on the ground, and then caresses his child. At a more tran- 
quil moment, this should not have been all. They should 
have drawn near the helmet, played with its plumes, caused 
the child to handle them. At last. the nurse should have 
lifted the helmet and laughingly set it on her own head — 
if, indeed, the hand of a woman dared touch the armor of 
Hector. 
If I wish to familiarize Emile with the noise of fire-arms, 
I first burn some powder in a pistol. The quickly vanishing 
flame, the new kind of lightning, greatly pleases him. I 
repeat the process, using more powder. By degrees I put 
into the pistol a small charge, without ramming it down; 
then a larger charge ; finally, I accustom him to the noise of 
a gun, to bombs, to cannon-shots, to the most terrific noises. 
Ihave noticed that children are rarely afraid of thunder, 
unless, indeed, the thunder-claps are so frightful as actually 
to;wound-the-organ-of hearing. Otherwise, they fear it only 
hen they have been taught that thunder sometimes wounds 
or kills. When reason begins to affright them, let habit 
eassure them. By a slow and well conducted process the 
an or the child is rendered fearless of everything. 
In this outset of life, while memory and imagination are 
still inactive, the child pays attention only to what actually 
affects his senses. The first materials of his knowledge are 
his sensations. If, therefore, these are presented to him in 
suitable order, his memory can hereafter present them to his 
understanding in the same order. But as he attends to his 
sensations only, it will at first suffice to show him very 
clearly the connection between these sensations, and the 
objects which give rise to them. He is eager to touch every- 
thing, to handle everything. Do not thwart this restless

THE EARLIEST EDUCATION. 27 
desire; it suggests to him a very necessary apprenticeship. 
It is thus he learns to feel the heat and coldness, hardness 
. and softness, heaviness and lightness of bodies; to judge of 
their size, their shape, and all their sensible qualities, by 
looking, by touching, by listening; above all, by comparing 
the results of sight with those of touch, estimating with the 
eye the sensation a thing produces upon the fingers. 
¢By movement alone we learn the existence of things which 
aré not ourselves; and it is by our own movements alone 
that we gain the idea of extension. 
Because the child has not this idea, he stretches out his 
hand indifferently to seize an object which touches him, or 
one which is a hundred paces distant from him. The effort 
he makes in doing this appears to you a sign of domination, 
an order he gives the object to come nearer, or to you to 
bring it tohim. It is nothing of the kind. It means only 
that the object seen first within the brain, then upon the eye, 
is now seen at arm’s length, and that he does not conceive 
of any distance beyond his reach. Be careful, then, to walk 
often with him, to transport him from one place to another, 
to let him feel the change of position, and, in this way to 
teach him how to judge of distances. When he begins to 
know them, change the plan; carry him only where it is 
convenient for you to do so, and not wherever it pleases him. 
For as soon as he is no longer deceived by the senses, his 
attempts arise from another cause. This change is remark- 
able and demands explanation. 
The uneasiness arising from our wants expresses itself by 
signs whenever help in supplying these wants is needed ; 
hence the cries of children. They cry a great deal, and this 
is natural.! Since all their sensations are those of feeling, 
children enjoy them in silence, when the sensations are 
pleasant ; otherwise they express them in their own language, 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
28 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
and ask relief. Now as long as children are awake they 
cannot be in a state of indifference ; they either sleep or are 
moved by pleasure and pain. 
All our languages are the result of art. Whether there is 
a natural language, common to all mankind, has long been a 
matter of investigation. Without doubt there is such a 
language, and it is the one that children utter before they 
know how to talk. This language is not articulate, but it is 
accentuated, sonorous, intelligible. The using of our own 
language has led us to neglect this, even so far as to forget 
it altogether. Let us study children, and we shall soon 
acquire it again from them. Nurses are our teachers in this 
language. They understand all their nurslings say, they 
answer them, they hold really connected dialogues with 
them. And, although they pronounce words, these words 
are entirely useless; the child understands, not the meaning 
of the words, but the accent which accompanies them. 
To the language of the voice is added the no less forcible 
language of gesture. This gesture is not that of children’s 
feeble hands ; it is that seen in their faces. It is astonishing 
to see how much expression these immature countenances 
already have. From moment to moment, their features 
change with inconceivable quickness. On them you see the 
smile, the wish, the fear, spring into life, and pass away, 
like so many lightning flashes. Each time you seem to see 
a different countenance. They certainly have much more 
flexible facial muscles than ours. On the other hand, their 
dull eyes tell us almost nothing at all. 
Such is naturally the character of their expression when 
all their wants are physical. Sensations are made known by 
grimaces, sentiments by looks. 
As the first state of man is wretchedness and weakness, 
so his first utterances are complaints and tears. The child 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE EARLIEST EDUCATION. 29 
feels his need and cannot satisfy it; he implores aid from 
others by crying. If he is hungry or thirsty, he cries; if he 
is too cold or too warm, he cries; if he wishes to move or to 
be kept at rest, he cries; if he wishes to sleep or to be 
moved about, he cries. The less control he has of his own 
mode of living, the oftener he asks those about him to 
change it. He has but one language, because he feels, so to 
speak, but one sort of discomfort. In the imperfect condi- 
tion of his organs, he does not distinguish their different 
impressions; all ills produce in him only a sensation of 
pain. 
From this crying, regarded as so little worthy of attention, 
arises the first relation of man to all that surrounds him; 
just here is forged the first link of that long chain which/ 
constitutes social order. oe 
When the child cries, he is ill at ease; he has some want 
that he cannot satisfy. We examine into it, we search 
for the want, find it, and relieve it. When we cannot find 
it, or relieve it, the crying continues. We are annoyed by 
it; we caress the child to-make-him.keep quiet, we rock him 
and sing to him, to lull him asleep. If he persists, we grow 
impatient ; we threaten him; brutal nurses sometimes strike 
him. These are strange lessons for him upon his entrance 
into life. 
e first crying of children.is.a prayer. If we do not 
eed it well, this crying soon becomes a command. They 
gin by asking our aid; they end by compelling us to serve 
em. Thus from their very weakness, whence comes, at first, 
their feeling of dependence, springs afterward the idea of 
ire, and of commanding others. But as this idea is 
awakened less by their own wants, than by the fact that we 
are serving them, those moral results whose immediate cause 
is not in nature, are here perceived. We therefore see why, 
  >
-P-A-G-E-30
  80 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
even at this early age, it is important to discern the hidden 
purpose which dictates the gesture or the cry. 
When the child stretches forth his hand with an effort, but 
without a sound, he thinks he can reach some object, be- 
cause he does not properly estimate its distance; he is 
mistaken. But if, while stretching out his hand, he com- 
plains and cries, he is no longer deceived as to the distance. 
He is commanding the object to come to him, or is directing 
you to bring it to him. In the first case, carry him to the 
object slowly, and with short steps; in the second case, do 
not even appear to understand him. It is worth while to 
habituate him early not to command people, for he is not 
eir master; nor things, for they cannot understand him. 
Ie when a child wants something he sees, and we mean to 
ive it to him, it is better to carry him to the object than to 
Phich the object to him. From this practice of ours he will 
iearn a lesson suited to his age, and there is no better way 
of suggesting this lesson to oe) 
Maxims to Keep us True to Nature. 
Rzason alone teaches us to know good and evil. Con- 
science, which makes us love the one and hate the other, is 
independent of reason, but cannot grow strong without its 
aid. Before reaching years of reason, we do good and evil 
unconsciously. There is no moral character in our actions, 
although there sometimes is in our feeling toward those 
actions of others which relate to us. A child likes to disturb 
everything he sees; he breaks, he shatters everything within 
his reach; he lays hold of a bird just as he would lay hold of 
a stone, and strangles it without knowing what he is doing. 
Why is this? At first view, philosophy would account for 
it on the ground of vices natural to us— pride, the spirit of 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  MAXIMS. 31 
domination, self-love, the wickedness of mankind. It would 
perhaps add, that the sense of his own weakness makes the 
child eager to do things requiring strength, and so prove to 
himself his own power. But see that old man, infirm and 
broken down, whom the cycle fuman life brings back to 
the weakness of childhood. Not only does he remain 
immovable and quiet, but he wishes everything about him 
to be in the same condition. The slightest change disturbs 
and disquiets him; he would like to see stillness reigning 
everywhere. How could the same powerlessness, joined to 
the same passions, produce such different effects in the two 
ages, if the primary cause were not changed? And where 
ean we seek for this difference of cause, unless it be in the, / 
physical condition of the two individuals? The active prin-\ 
ciple common to the two is developing in the one, and dying 
out in the other; the one is growing, and the other is wear- 
ing itself out; the one is tending toward life, and the other 
toward death. Failing activity concentrates itself in the 
heart of the old man; in the child it is superabounding, and 
reaches outward ; he seems to feel within him life enough to 
animate all that surrounds him. Whether he makes or 
unmakes matters little to him. It is enough that he changes 
the condition of things, and that every change is an action. 
If he seems more inclined to destroy things, it is not out of 
perverseness, but because the action which creates is always 
slow; and that which destroys, being more rapid, better 
suits his natural sprightliness. 
While the Author of nature gives children this active prin- 
ciple, he takes care that it shall do little harm; for he leaves 
them little power to indulge it. But no sooner do they look 
upon those about them as instruments which it is their 
business to set in motion, than they make use of them in 
following their own inclinations and in making up for their
-P-A-G-E-32
    
  82 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
own want of strength. In this way they become disagree- 
able, tyrannical, imperious, perverse, unruly ; a development 
not arising from a natural spirit of domination, but creating 
such a spirit. For no very long experience is requisite in 
teaching how pleasant it is to act through others, and to need 
only move one’s tongue to set the world in motion. 
As we grow up, we gain strength, we become less uneasy 
‘and restless, we shut ourselves more within ourselves. The 
soul and the body put themselves in equilibrium, as it were, 
and nature requires no more motion than is necessary for our 
preservation. 
But the wish to command outlives the necessity from 
which it sprang; power to control others awakens and 
gratifies self-love, and habit makes it strong. Thus need 
gives place to whim; thus do prejudices and opinions first 
root themselves within us. 
The principle once understood, we see clearly the point at 
which we leave the path of nature. Let us discover what 
we ought to do, to keep within it. 
Far from having too much strength, children have not 
even enough for all that nature demands of them. We 
ought, then, to leave them the free use of all natural strength 
which they cannot misuse. First maxim. 
We must aid them, supplying whatever they lack in intel- 
ligence, in strength, in all that belongs to physical necessity.

personal freedom and _less.authority; to let them do more’ 
for themselves, and exact less from others. Thus accus- 
tomed betimes to desire only what they can obtain or do for 
themselves, they will feel less keenly the want of whatever is 
not within their own power. 
Here there is another and very important reason for leay- 
ing children absolutely free as to body and limbs, with the 
sole precaution of keeping them from the danger of falling, 
and of putting out of their reach everything that can injure 
them. 
Doubtless a child whose body and arms are free will cry 
less than one bound fast in swaddling clothes. He who feels 
only physical wants cries only when he suffers, and this is a 
great advantage. For then we know exactly when he 
requires help, and we ought not to delay one moment in 
giving him help, if possible. 
ut if you cannot relieve him, keep quiet; do not try to 4 
soothe him by petting him. Your caresses will not cure his 
colic; but he will remember what he has to do in order to be 
petted. And if he once discovers that he-can, at-will, busy

they would not cry so much; if we were less annoyed by 
their crying, we would take less pains to hush them; if they 
were not so often threatened or caressed, they would be less 
timid or less stubborn, and more truly themselves as nature 
made them. It is not so often by letting children cry, as by 
hastening to quiet them, that we make them rupture them- 
selves. The proof of this is that the children most neglectea

are less subject than others to this infirmity, Iam far from 
wishing them to be neglected, however. /On the contrary, 
we ought to anticipate their wants, and not wait to be noti- 
fied of these by the children’s crying. Yet I would not have 
them misunderstand the cares we bestow on them. Why 
should they consider crying a fault, when they find that it 
avails so much? Knowing the value of their silence, they 
will be careful not to be lavish of it. They will, at last, 
make it so costly that we cau no longer pay for it; and then 
it is that by crying without success they strain, weaken, and 
kill themselves. 
/ The long erying fits of a child who is not compressed or 
‘ill, or allowed to want for anything, are from habit and 
obstinacy. They are by no means the work of nature, but 
of the nurse, who, because she cannot endure the annoyance, 
multiplies it, without reflecting that by stilling the child to- 
day, he is induced to cry the more to-morrow. 
The only way to cure or prevent this habit is to pay no 
attention to it. No one, not even a child, likes to take 
unnecessary trouble. 
They are stubborn in their attempts ; but if you have more 
firmness than they have obstinacy, they are discouraged, and 
do not repeat the attempt. Thus we spare them some tears, 
and accustom them to cry only when pain forces them to it. 
Nevertheless when they do cry from caprice or stubborn- © 
ness, a sure way to prevent their continuing is, to turn their 
attention to some agreeable and striking object, and so make 
them forget their desire to cry. In this art most nurses 
excel, and when skilfully employed, it is very effective. But 
it is highly important that the child should not know of our 
intention to divert him, and that he should amuse himself 
without at all thinking we have him in mind. In this all 
nurses are unskilful.

All children are weaned too early. The proper time. is 
indicated by their teething. This process is usually p: . 
and distressing. By a mechanical instinct the child, at that p 
time, carries to his mouth and chews everything he holds. 
We think we make the operation easier by giving him for a s 
plaything some hard substance, such as ivory or coral. I 
think we are mistaken. Far from softening the gums, these 
hard bodies, when applied, render them hard and callous, 
and prepare the way for a more painful and distressing lac- 
eration./ Let us always take instinct for guide. We never 
see puppies try their growing teeth upon flints, or iron, or 
bones, but upon wood, or leather, or rags,— upon soft mate- 
rials, which give way, and on which the tooth impresses itself. 
We no longer aim at simplicity, even where children are 2 
concerned. Golden and silver bells, corals, crystals, toys 
of every price, of every sort. What useless and mischiev- 
ous affectations they are! Let there be none of them, — 
no bells, no toys. 
— A little twig covered with its own leaves and fruit, — a 
poppy-head, in which the seeds can be heard rattling,— a stick 
of liquorice he can suck and chew, these will amuse a child 
quite as well as the splendid baubles, and will not disadvan- 
tage him by accustoming him to luxury from his very birth. 
Language. 
From the time they are born, children hear people speak. 
They are spoken to not only before they understand what 
is said to them, but before they can repeat the sounds they 
hear. Their organs, still benumbed, adapt themselves only 
by degrees to imitating the sounds dictated to them, and it 
is not even certain that these sounds are borne to their ears 
at first as distinctly as to ours.

ft F do not disapprove of a nurse’s amusing the child with 
_ASongs, and with blithe and varied tones. But I do disap-

useless words, of which he understands only the tone she 
gives them.

clothes the child hears his nurse’s babble, he hears in class 
the verbiage of his teacher. It strikes me that if he were to 
be so brought up that he could not understand it at all, he 
would be very well instructed.’ 
Refiections crowd upon us when we set about discussing 
the formation of children’s language, and their baby talk ~ 
itself. In spite of us, they always learn to speak by the 
same process, and all our philosophical speculations about it 
are entirely useless. 
They seem, at first, to have a grammar adapted to their 
own age, although its rules of syntax are more general than 
ours. And if we were to pay close attention to them, we 
should be astonished at the exactness with which they follow 
certain analogies, very faulty if you will, but very regular, 
that are displeasing only because harsh, or because usage 
does not recognize them. 
It is unbearable pedantry, and a most useless labor, to 
  1No doubt this sarcasm is applicable to those teachers who talk so as to 
say nothing. A teacher ought, on the contrary, to speak only so as to be, 
understood by the child. He ought to adapt himself to the child’s ca-| 
pacity; to employ no useless or conventional expressions; his language 
ought to arouse curiosity and to impart light.

' ‘they are never so happy with any oneas with you; and rest assured their language will insensibly be purified by your 
own, without your having ever reproved them. 
But another error, which has an entirely different bearing 
on the matter, and is no less easy to prevent, is our being 
over-anxious to make them speak, as if we feared they 
might not of their own accord learn to do so. Our injudi- 
© cious haste has an effect exactly contrary to what we wish. 
On account of it they learn more slowly and speak more 
indistinctly. The marked attention paid to everything they 
utter makes it unnecessary for them to articulate distinctly. 
As they hardly condescend to open their lips, many retain 
throughout life an imperfect pronunciation and: a confused 
manner of speaking, which makes them nearly unintelligible. 
Children who are too much urged to speak have not time 
sufficient for learning either to pronounce carefully or to 
understand thoroughly what they are made to say. If, in- 
stead, they are left to themselves, they at first practise using 
the syllables they can most readily utter; and gradually 
attaching to these some meaning that can be gathered from 
their gestures, they give you their own words before acquir- 
ing yours. Thus they receive yours only after they under- 
stand them. Not being urged to use them, they notice 
carefully what_meaning you give them; and, when they are 
sure of this, they-adopt it as their own. 
The greatest evil arising from our haste to make children 
speak before they are old enough is not that our first talks 
with them, and the first words they use, have no meaning 
to them, but that they have a meaning different from ours, 
without our being able to perceive it. Thus, while they seem

to be answering us very correctly, they are really addressing 
us without understanding us, and without our understanding 
them. To such ambiguous discourse is due the surprise we 
sometimes feel at their sayings, to which we attach ideas the 
children themselves have not dreamed of. This inattention 
of-ours to the true meaning words have for children seems to 
me the cause of their first mistakes, and these errors, even 
after children are cured of them, influence their turn of mind 
for the remainder of their life. 
/ The first developments of childhood occur almost all at 
once. The child learns to speak, to eat, to walk, nearly at 
the same time. This is, properly, the first epoch of his life. 
Before then he is nothing more than he was before he was 
born; he has not a sentiment, not an idea; he scarcely has 
sensations ; he does not feel even his own existence.

  Tux second book takes the child at about the fifth year, and con- 
~ducts him to about the twelfth year. He is no longer the little 
child; he is the young boy. His education becomes more impor- 
tant. It consists not in studies, in reading or writing, or in duties, 
but in well-chosen plays, in ingenious recreations, in well-directed 
experiments. 
There should be no exaggerated precautions, and, on the other 
hand, no harshness, no punishments. We must love the child, and 
ge his playing. To make him realize his'yeakness and the 
limits Within which it can work, to keep the child depend- 
ent only on circumstances, will suffice, without ever making him 
feel the yoke of the master. 
The best education is. accomplished in the country. Teaching by

  Avoid taking too many Precautions. 
HIS is the second period of life, and the one at which, 
properly_speaking, infancy ends; for the words infans 
and puer are not synonymous.! The first is included in the 
second, and means one who cannot speak: thus in Valerius 
Maximus we find the expression puerum infantem. But I 
shall continue to employ the word according to the usage of 
the French language, until I am describing the age for which 
_ there are other names. 
1 Puer, child; infans, one who does not speak.

  40 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
When children begin to speak, they ery less often. This 
step in advance is natural; one language is substituted for 
another. As soon as they can utter their complaints in 
words, why should they cry, unless the suffering is too keen 
to be expressed by words? If they then continue to cry, it 
is the fault of those around them. After Emile has once 
said, ‘It hurts me,” only acute suffering can force him to 
cry. 
If the child is physically so delicate and sensitive that he 
naturally cries about nothing, I will soon exhaust the foun- 
tain of his tears, by making them ineffectual.” So long as 
he Gries, I will not go to him; as soon as he stops, I will 
run to him. Very soon his method of calling me will be to 
keep quiet, or at the utmost, to utter a single cry. Children 
judge of the meaning of signs by their palpable effect; they 
have no other rule. Whatever harm a child may do himself, 
he very rarely cries when alone, unless with the hope of 
being heard. 
If he fall, if he bruise his head, if his nose bleed, if he 
cut his finger, I should, instead of bustling about him with 
a look of alarm, remain quiet, at least for a little while. 
The mischief is done; he must endure it; all my anxiety 
will only serve to frighten him more, and to increase his sen- 
sitiveness. After all, when we hurt ourselves, it is less the 
shock which pains us than the fright. I will spare him at 
least this last pang; for he will certainly estimate his hurt 
as he sees me estimate it. If he sees me run anxiously to 
comfort and to pity him, he will think himself seriously hurt ; 
but if he sees me keep my presence of mind, he will soon 
recover his own, and will think the pain cured when he no 
longer feels it. At his age we learn our first lessons in cour- 
age; and by fearlessly enduring lighter sufferings, we grad- 
ually learn to bear the heavier ones.
-P-A-G-E-41
  AVOID TAKING TOO MANY PRECAUTIONS. 41 
Far from taking care that Emile does not hurt himself, I 
shall be dissatisfied if he never does, and so grows up unac- 
quainted with pain. To suffer is the first and most neces- 
sary thing for him to learn.Children are litt fe and weak, 
apparently that they may learn these important lessons. If 
a child fall his whole length, he will not break his leg; if he 
strike himself with a stick, he will not break his arm; if he 
lay hold of an edged tool, he does not grasp it tightly, and 
will not cut himself very badly. 
Our pedantic mania for instructing constantly leads us to 
teach children what they can learn far better for themselves, 
and to lose sight of what we alone can teach them. Is there 
anything more absurd than the pains we take in teaching 
them to walk? As if we had ever seen one, who, through 
his nurse’s negligence, did not know how to walk when 
grown! On the contrary, how many people do we see mov- 
ing awkwardly all their lives because they have been badly 
taught how to walk! 
Emile shall have no head-protectors, nor carriages, nor go- 
carts, nor leading-strings. Or at least from the time when 
he begins to be able to put one foot before the other, he 
shall not be supported, except over paved places} and he 
shall be hurried over these. / Instead of letting him suffocate 
in the exhausted air indoors, let him be taken every day, far 
out into the fields. There let him run about, play, fall down 
a hundred times a day; the oftener the better, as he will the » 
sooner learn to get up again by himself. The boon of free- 
dom is worth many scars. My pupil will have many bruises, 
but to make amends for that, he will be always light-hearted. 
Though your pupils are less often hurt, they are continually 
thwarted, fettered; they are always unhappy. I doubt 
whether the advantage be on their side. 
The development of their physical strength makes com-

plaint less necessary to children. When able to help them- 
selves, they have less need of the help of others. Knowledge 
to direct their strength grows with that strength. At this 
second stage the life of the individual properly begins; he 
now becomes.conscious of his own being. Memory extends 
this feeling of personal identity to every moment of his ex- 
istence; he becomes really one, the same one, and conse- 
quently capable of happiness or of misery. We must there- 
fore, from this moment, begin to regard him as. a moral 
being. 
Childhood is to be Loved. 
Aurnovex the longest term of human life, and the proba- 
bility, at any given age, of reaching this term, have been 
computed, nothing is more uncertain than the continuance of 
each individual life: very few attain the maximum. The 
greatest risks in life are at its beginning; the less one has 
lived, the less prospect he has of living. 
~ Of all children born, only about half reach youth; and it 
is probable that your pupil may never attain to manhood. 
What, then, must be thought of that barbarous education 
which sacrifices the present to an uncertain future, loads the 
child with every description of fetters, and begins, by mak- 
ing him wretched, to prepare for him some far-away indefi- 
nite happiness he may never enjoy! Even supposing the 
object of such an education reasonable, how can we without 
indignation see the unfortunate creatures bowed under an 
insupportable yoke, doomed to constant labor like so many 
galley-slaves, without any certainty that all this toil will ever 
be of use to them The years that ought to be bright i |

and the death thus summoned will seize on him unperceived 
amidst all this melancholy preparation. Who knows how 
many children die on account of the extravagant prudence of 
a father or of a teacher? Happy in escaping his cruelty, it 
gives them one advantage; they leave without regret a life 
which they know only from its darker side.! 
O men, be humane! it is your highest duty; be humane 
to all conditions of men, to every age, to everything not 
alien to mankind. What higher wisdom is there for you 
than humanity? Love childhood; encourage~its-sports; its 
pleasures, its lovable instincts. _Who among us has not at 
times looked back with regret to the age when a smile was 
continually on our lips, when the soul was always at peace? 
Why should we rob these little innocent creatures of the 
enjoyment of a time so brief, so transient, of a boon so 
precious, which they cannot misuse? Why will you fill with 
bitterness and sorrow these fleeting years which can no more 
return to them than to you? Do you know, you fathers, the 
moment when death awaits your children? Do not store up 
for yourselves remorse, by taking from them the brief 
moments nature has given them. As soon as they can 
appreciate the delights of existence, let them enjoy it. At 
whatever hour God co them, let them not die without 
having tasted lif all.

them will have to be encountered during the age of reason.” 
But who has told you that it is your province to make this 
arrangement, and that all these fine instructions, with which 
you burden the tender mind of a child, will not one day be 
more pernicious than useful to him? ‘Who assures you that 
you spare him anything when you deal him afflictions with 
so lavish a hand? Why do you cause him more unhappiness 
than he can bear, when you are not sure that the future will 
compensate him for these present evils? And how can you 
prove that the evil tendencies of which you pretend to cure 
him will not arise from your mistaken care rather than from 
nature itself! Unhappy foresight, which renders a creature 
actually miserable, in the hope, well or ill founded, of one 
day making him happy! If these vulgar reasoners confound 
license with liberty, and mistake a spoiled child for a child 
who is made happy, let us teach them to distinguish the two. 
To ayoid being misled, let us remember what really ac- 
cords with our present abilities. Humanity has its place in 
the general order of things; childhood has its place in the 
order of human life. Mankind must be considered in the 
individual man, and childhood in the individual child. To 
assign each his place, and to establish him in it—to direct 
human passions as human nature will permit —is all we can 
do for his welfare. The rest depends on outside influences 
not under our control.

to the case of ner all the rules of education will

A wise man understands how to remain in his own place; 
but a child, who does not know his, cannot preserve it. As 
matters stand, there are a thousand ways of leaving it. 
Those who govern him are to keep him in it, and this is not 
an easy task. He ought to be neither an animal nor a man,

child to do what is of no use to him whatever. 
Accustom the child to depend only on circumstances, and 
as his education goes on, you will follow the order of nature. 
Never oppose to his imprudent wishes anything but physical 
obstacles, or punishments which arise from the actions them- 
selves, and which he will remember when the occasion comes. 
It is enough to prevent his doing harm, without forbidding it.

him free and not imperious, so that, accepting your aid with 
a kind of humiliation, he may aspire tc the moment when he 
can dispense with it, and have the honor of serving himself. 
For strengthening the body and promoting its growth, nature 
has means which ought never to be thwarted. A child ought 
not to be constrained to stay anywhere when he wishes to go

     CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
away, or to go away when he wishes to stay. When their 
will is not spoiled by our own fault, children do not wish for 
anything without good reason. They ought to leap, to run, 
to shout, whenever they will. All their movements are ne- 
cessities of nature, which is endeavoring to strengthen itself. 
But we must take heed of those wishes they cannot them- 
selves accomplish, but must fulfil by the hand of another. 
Therefore care should be taken to distinguish the real wants, 
the wants of nature, from those which arise from fancy or 
from the redundant life just mentioned. 
I have already suggested what should be done when a 
child cries for anything. I will only add that, as soon as he 
can ask in words for what he wants, and, to obtain it sooner, 
or to overcome a refusal, reinforces his request by crying, it 
_ Should never be granted him. If necessity has made him 
“speak, you ought to know it, and at once to grant what he 
demands. But yielding to his tears is encouraging him to 
shed them: it teaches him to doubt your good will, and to 
believe that importunity has more influence over you than 
your own kindness of heart has. 
If he does not believe you good, he will soon be bad; if 
he believes you weak, he will soon be stubborn. It is of 
great importance that you at once consent to what you do 
not intend to refuse him. Do not refuse often, but never 
revoke a refusal. 
Above all things, beware of teaching the child empty for- 
mulas of politeness which shall serve him instead of magic 
words to subject to his own wishes all who surround him, 
and to obtain instantly what he likes. In the artificial edu- 
cation of the rich they are infallibly made politely imperious, 
by having prescribed to them what terms to use so that no 
one shall dare resist them. Such children have neither the 
tones nor the speech of suppliants; they are as arrogant
-P-A-G-E-47
NEITHER SLAVES NOR TYRANTS. 47 
when they request as when they command, and even more 
80, for in the former case they are more sure of being obeyed. 
From the first it is readily seen that, coming from them, ‘If 
you please’? means ‘‘It pleases me”; and that ‘I beg” 
signifies ‘I order you.” Singular politeness this, by which 
they only change the meaning of words, and so never speak 
but with authority! For myself, I dread far less Emile’s 
being rude than his being arrogant. I would rather have 
him say ‘‘ Do this” as if requesting than ‘I beg you” as 
if commanding. I attach far less importance to the term he 
uses than to the meaning he associates with it. ‘ 
~Over-strictness and over-indulgence are equally to be 
avoided. If you let children suffer, you endanger their 
health and their life; you make them actually wretched. If 
you carefully spare them every kind of annoyance, you are 
storing up for them much unhappiness; you are making 
them delicate and sensitive to pain; you are removing them 
from the common lot of man, into which, in spite of all 
your care, they will one day return. To save them some 
natural discomforts, you contrive for them others which 
nature has not inflicted. 
‘You will charge me with falling into the mistake of those 
fathers I have reproached for sacrificing their children’s hap- 
piness to considerations of a far-away future that may never 
be. Not so; for the freedom I give my pupil will amply 
supply him with the slight discomforts to which I leave him 
exposed. I see the little rogues playing in the snow, blue 
with cold, and scarcely able to move their fingers. They 
have only to go and warm themselves, but they do nothing 
of the kind. If they are compelled to do so, they feel the 
constraint a hundred times more than they do the cold. Why 
then do you complain? Shall I make your child unhappy if

vice now; by arming him against the ills he must encounter, 
I do him service for the time to come. If he could choose 
between being my pupil or yours, do you think he would 
hesitate a moment? 
Can we conceive of any creature’s being truly happy out- 
side of what belongs to its own peculiar nature? And if we 
would have a man exempt from all human misfortunes, would 
it not estrange him from humanity? Undoubtedly it would ; 
for we are so constituted that to appreciate great good fortune 
we must be acquainted with slight misfortunes. If the body 
be too much at ease the moral nature becomes corrupted. 
The man unacquainted with suffering would not know the 
tender feelings of humanity or the sweetness of compassion ; 
he would not be a social being; he would be a monster

Man is naturally disposed to regard as his own whatever is

tyrant; that is, the vilest of slaves, and at the same time the 
most miserable of beings. I have seen children thus reared 
who wanted those about them to push the house down, to give 
them the weathercock they saw on a steeple, to stop the 
march of a regiment so that they could enjoy the drum-beat 
a little longer; and as soon as obedience to these demands 
was delayed they rent the air with their screams, and would 
listen to no one. In vain everybody tried eagerly to gratify 
them. The ease with which they found their wishes obeyed 
stimulated them to desire more, and to be stubborn about 
impossibilities. Everywhere they found only contradictions, 
impediments, suffering, and sorrow. Always complaining, 
always refractory, always angry, they spent the time in 
erying and fretting ; were these creatures happy? Authority 
and weakness conjoined produce only madness and wretched- 
ness. One of two spoiled children beats the table, and the 
other has the sea lashed.'| They will have much to beat and 
to lash before they are satisfied with life.

If these ideas of authority and of tyranny make them 
unhappy from their very childhood, how will it be with them 
when they are grown, and when their relations with others 
begin to be extended and multiplied? 
Accustomed to seeing everything give way before them, 
how surprised they will be on entering the world to find 
themselves crushed beneath the weight of that universe they 
have expected to move at their own pleasure! Their insolent 
airs and childish vanity will only bring upon them mortifica- 
tion, contempt, and ridicule ; they must swallow affront after 
affront; cruel trials will teach them that they understand 
neither their own position nor their own strength. Unable to 
do everything, they will think themselves unable to do any- 
thing. So many unusual obstacles dishearten them;-so much 
contempt degrades them. They become base, cowardly, 
cringing, and sink as far below their real self as they had 
| agined themselves above it. i 
*./ Let us return to the original-erderof things. Nature has 
' © msde children to be Toved and helped; has she made them to 
be obeyed and feared? Has she given them an imposing air, 
a stern eye, a harsh and threatening voice, so that they may 
inspire fear? I can understand why the roar of a lion fills 
other creatures with dread, and why they tremble at sight of 
his terrible countenance. But if ever there were an unbecom- 
ing, hateful, ridiculous spectacle, it is that of a body of mag- 
istrates in their robes of ceremony, and headed by their chief, 
prostrate before an infant in long clothes, who to their pompous 
harangue replies only by screams or by childish drivel !+ 
  1 The feeling of a republican, of the “ citizen of Geneya,”’ justly shocked 
by monarchial superstitions. Louis XIV. and Louis XV. had had, in fact, 
from the days of their first playthings, the degrading spectacle of a univer- 
sal servility prostrated before their cradle. The sentiment here uttered 
was still uncommon and almost unknown when Rousseau wrote it. He did 
much toward creating it and making it popular.

Considering infancy in itself, is there a creature on earth 
more helpless, more unhappy, more at the mercy of every- 
thing around him, more in need of compassion, of care, of 
protection, than a child? Does it not seem as if his sweet 
face and touching aspect were intended to interest every one 
who comes near him, and to urge them to assist his weakness ? 
What then is more outrageous, more contrary to the fitness of 
things, than to see an imperious and headstrong child order- 
ing about those around him, impudently taking the tone of a 
master toward those who, to destroy him, need’ only leave 
him to himself! 
On the other hand, who does not see that since the weak- 
ness of infancy fetters children in so many ways, we are 
barbarous if we add to this natural subjection a bondage to 
our own caprices bystaking from them the limited freedom ; 
they have, a freedom they are so little able to misuse, and 
from the loss of which we and they have so little to gain? 
As nothing is more ridiculous than a haughty child, so noth- 
ing is more pitiable than a cowardly child. 
Since with years of reason civil bondage! begins, why 
anticipate it by slavery at home? Let us leave one moment 
of life exempt from a yoke nature has not laid upon us, and 
allow childhood the exercise of that natural liberty which 
keeps it safe, at least for a time, from the vices taught by 
slavery. Let the over-strict teacher and the over-indulgent 
parent both come with their empty cavils, and before they 
boast of their own methods let them learn the method of 
Nature herself. 
1 Civil bondage, as understood by Rousseau, consists in the laws and 
obligations of civilized life itself. He extols the state of nature as the » ideal 
condition, the condition of perfect freedom, witho Se eeing that, on “the 
contrary, true liberty cannot: exist without the protection of ° while the 
state of nature-is only the enslavement of the weak by the strong—the

Reasoning should not begin too soon. 
Locke’s great maxim was that we ought to_reasi ith 
children, and just now this maxim is much in fashion. I 
ink, however, that its success does not warrant its reputa- 
es and I find nothing more stupid than children who have 
been so much reasoned with. Reason, apparently a com- 
pound of all other faculties, the one latest developed, and 
with most difficulty, is the one proposed as agent in unfolding 
the faculties earliest mst The noblest work of education 
is to make a reasoning man, and we expect to train a young 
child by making him reason! This is beginning at the end; 
this is making an instrument of a result. If children under-. 
stood how to reason they would not ‘be educ eduecateds 
But-by-addressing them from their Pairest years in a 
language they cannot understand, you accustom them to be 
satisfied with words, to find fault with whatever is said to 
them, to think themselves as wise as their teachers, to wrangle 
and rebel. And what we mean they shall do from reasonable 
motives we are forced to obtain from them by adding the 
Motive of avarice, or of fear, or of vanity. 
( Nature intends that children shall be children before they 
\ are men. If we insist on reversing this order we shall have 
‘trnit early indeed, but unripe and tasteless, and liable to 
early decay; we shall have young savants and old ¢hildren. 
Childhood has its own methods of seeing, thinking, and 
feeling, Nothing shows less sense than to try to substitute 
our own methods for these. I would rather require a child 
ten years old to be five feet tall than to be judicious. Indeed, 
what use would he have at that age for the power to reason? 
It is a check upon physical strength, and the child needs 
none.

    REASONING SHOULD NOT BEGIN TOO SOON. Bs) 
In attempting to persuade your pupils to obedience you 
add to this alleged persuasion force and threats, or worse 
till flattery and promises. Bought over in this way by 
ili, or constrained by force, they pretend to be convinced 
by reason. They see plainly that as soon as you discover 
obedience or disobedience in their conduct, the former is an 
advantage and the latter a disadvantage to them. But you 
ask of them only what is distasteful to them; it is always 
irksome to carry out the wishes of another, so by stealth they 
carry out their own. They are sure that if their disobedience 
is not known they are doing well; but they are ready, for 
fear of greater evils, to acknowledge, if found out, that they 
are doing wrong. As the reason for the duty required is 
beyond their capacity, no one can make them really under- 
stand it. But the fear of punishment, the hope of forgive- 
ness, your importunity, their difficulty in answering you, 
extort from them the confession required of them. You think 
you have convinced them, when you have only wearied them 
out or intimidated them. 
What results from this? First of all that, by imposing 
upon them a duty they do not feel as such, you set them 
against your tyranny, and dissuade them from loving you; 
you teach them to be dissemblers, deceitful, willfully untrue, 
for the sake of extorting rewards or of escaping punishments. 
Finally, by habituating them to cover a secret motive by an 
apparent motive, you give them the means of constantly 
misleading you, of concealing their true character from you, 
and of satisfying yourself and others with empty words when 
their occasiondemands. You may say that the law, although 
binding on the. conscience, uses constraint in dealing with 
grown men. fi grant it; but what are these men but children / 
spoiled by their education? This is precisely what ought to” 
be prevented. With children use force, with men reason ;,\

GS Treat your pupil as his age demands, From the ot.   
ign him to his true place, and keep him there so effectually 
that he will not try to leave it. Then, without knowing what 
wisdom is, he will practise its most important lesson. 
Never, absolutely never, command him to do a thing, what- 
ever it may be.’ Do not let him even imagine that you 
claim any authority over him. Let him know only that he 
is weak and you are strong: that from his condition and 
yours he is necessarily at your mercy. Let him know this ~ 
learn it and feel it. Let him early know that upon his 
haughty neck is the stern yoke nature imposes upon man, 
the heavy yoke of necessity, under which every finite being 
must toil. 
Let him discover this necessity in the nature of things; 
never in human caprice. Let the rein that holds him back 
be power, not authority. ‘Do not forbid but prevent, his 
doing what he ought.not and Ti thus preventing him use no 
explanations, give no reasons. What you grant him, grant 
at the first asking without any urging, any entreaty from 
him, and above all without conditions. Consent with pleas- 
ure and refuse unwillingly, but let every refusal be irrevo- 
cable. Let no importunity move a the ‘¢ No”? once       
     
  1In this unconditional form the principle is inadmissible. Any one who 
has the rearing of children knows this. But the idea underlying the para- 
dox ought to be recognized, for it is a just one. We ought not to command 
merely for the pleasure of commanding, but solely to interpret to the child 
the requirements of the case in hand. To command him for the sake of 
commanding is an abuse of power: it is a baseness which will end in disas- 
ter. On the other hand, we cannot leave it to circumstances to forbid what 
ought not to be done, Only, the command should be intelligible, reason- 
able, and unyielding. This is really what Rousseau means-

uttered be a wall of brass against which the child will have 
to exhaust his strength only five or six times before he ceases 
trying to overturn it: 
In this way you will make him patient, even-tempered, re-, 
signed, gentle, even when he has not what he wants, For ii . 
is in our nature to endure patiently the decrees of fate, but \ 
not the ill-will of others. ‘+There is no more,” is an answer 
against which no child ever rebelled unless he believed it 
untrue. Besides, there is no other way; either nothing at 
all is to be required of him, or he must from the first be - 
accustomed to perfect obedience. The worst training of all 
is to leave him wavering between his own will and yours, 
and to dispute incessantly with him as to which shall be 
master. I should a hundred times prefer his being master 
in every case. 
It is marvellous that in undertaking to educate a child no 
other means of guiding him should have been devised than 
emulation, jealousy, envy, vanity, greed, vile fear, — all of 
them passions most dangerous, readiest te ferment, fittest to 
corrupt a soul, even beforethgebody is full-grown. For each 
instruction too early put into a child’s head, a vice is deeply 
implanted in his heart./ Foolish teachers think they are 
doing wonders when théy make & child wicked, in order to 
teach him whee peogane ss is; and then they gravely tell us,

ought not to undertake a child’s education unless we know 
how to lead him wherever we please solely by the laws of the 
possible and the impossible. The sphere of both being alike 
unknown to him, we may extend or contract it around him as 
we will. We may bind him down, incite him to action, re- 
strain him by the leash of necessity alone, and he will not

murmur. We may render him pliant and teachable by the 
force of circumstances alone, without giving any vice an 
opportunity to take root within him. For the passions 
never awake to life, so long as they are of no avail. 
Do not give your pupil any sort of lesson verbally: he 
ought to receive none except from experience. Inflict upon 
him no kind of punishment, for he does not know what being 
in fault means ; never oblige him to ask pardon, for he does 
not know what it is to offend you. 
His actions being without moral quality, he can do nothing 
which is_morally bad, or which deserves either punishment or 
reprooft) 
zi Alréady I see the startled reader judging of this child by 
/those around us; but he is mistaken. The perpetual con- 
/ straint under which you keep your pupils increases their 
| liveliness. The more cramped they are while under your eye 
| the more unruly they are the moment they escape it. They 
| | must, in fact, make themselves amends for the severe re- 
straint you put upon them. Two school-boys from a city 
will do more mischief in a community than the young people 
of a whole village.

Gris is not strictly true. The child early has the consciousness of right 
“and wrong; and if it be true that neither chastisement nor reproof is to be 
abused, it is no less certain that conscience is early awake within him, and 
that it ought not to be neglected in a work so delicate as that of education: 
on condition, be it understood, that we act with simplicity, without pedan- 
try, and that we employ example more than lectures. Rousseau says this 
admirably a few pages farther on.

thwarted, are still very far from the condition in which I 
should wish to keep them. 
Proceed Slowly. 
May I venture to state here the greatest, the most impor- 
tant, the most useful rule in all education? It is, not to 
gain time, but to lose it. Forgive the paradox, O my ordi- 
nary reader! It must be uttered by any one who reflects, 
and whatever you may say, I prefer paradoxes to prejudices. 
The most perilous interval of human life is that between birth 
and the age of twelve years. At that time errors and vices 
take root without our having any means of destroying them ; 
and when the instrument is found, the time for uprooting them 
‘is past. If children could spring at one bound from the 
mother’s breast to the age of reason, the education given 
them now-a-days would be suitable ; but in the due order of 
nature they need one entirely different. They should not 
use the mind at all, until it has all its faculties. For while 
it is blind it cannot see the torch you present to it; nor can 
it follow on the immense plain of ideas a path which, even 
for the keenest eyesight, reason traces so faintly. 
The earliest education ought, then, to be purely negative. 
It consists not in teaching truth or virtue, but in shielding 
the heart from vice and the mind from error. If you could 
do nothing at all, and allow nothing to be done; if you 
could bring up your pupil sound and robust to the age of 
twelve years, without his knowing how to distinguish his 
right hand from his left, the eyes of his understanding would 
from the very first open to reason. Without a prejudice or 
a habit, there would be in him nothing to counteract the 
effect of your care. Before long he would become in your 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
hands the wisest of men; and beginning by doing nothing, 
you would have accomplished a marvel in education. 
Reverse the common practice, and you will nearly always 
do well./ Parents and teachers desiring to make of a child 
not a child, but a learned man, have never begun early enough 
to chide, to correct, to reprimand, to flatter, to promise, to 
nstruct, to discourse reason to him. Do better than this: 
be reasonable yourself, and do not argue with your pupil, least 
of all, to make~himrapprové what he dislikes... For if you 
persist in reasoning ‘about disagreeable things, you make 
reasoning disagreeable to him, and weaken its influence 
beforehand in a mind as yet unfitted to understand it. Keep 
his organs, his senses, his physical strength, busy; but, as 
long as possible, keep his mind inactive. Guard against all 
“sensations arising in advance of judgment, which estimates 
their true value. Keep back and check unfamiliar impres- 
sions, and be in no haste to do good for the sake of preventing 
evil. For the good is not real unless enlightened by reason. 
Regard every delay as an advantage; for much is gained if 
the critical period be approached without losing anything. 
Let childhood have its full growth. If indeed a lesson must 
be given, avoid it to-day, if you can without danger delay 
it until to-morrow. 
Another consideration which proves this method useful is 
the peculiar bent of the child’s mind. This ought to be well 
understood if we would know what moral government is best 
adapted to him. Each has his own cast of mind, in accord- 
ance with which he must be directed; and if we would suc- 
ceed, he must be ruled according to this natural bent and no 
other. Be judicious: watch nature long, and observe your 
“pupil carefully before you say a word to him. At first leave 
the germ of his character free to disclose itself. Repress it 
as little as possible, so that you may the better see all there 
is of ‘it.
-P-A-G-E-59

Do you think this season of free action will be time lost to 
him? On the contrary, it will be employed in the best way 
possible. For by this means you will learn not to lose a sin- 
gle moment when time is more precious; whereas, if you 
begin to act before you know what ought to be done, you 
act at random. Liable to deceive yourself, you will have to 
retrace your steps, and will be farther from your object than 
if you had been less in haste to reach it. Do not then act 
like a miser, who, in order to lose nothing, loses a great deal. 
At the earlier age sacrifice time which you will recover with 
interest later on. The wise physician does not give direc- 
tions at first sight of his patient, but studies the sick man’s 
temperament, before prescribing. He begins late with his . 
treatment, but cures the man: the over-hasty physician kills 
him. 
member that, before you venture undertaking to form a 
Coat you must have made yourself a man; you must find in 
yourself the example you ought to offer him. While the 
child is yet without knowledge there is time to prepare every- 
thing about him so that his first glance shall discover only 
what he ought to see. Make everybody respect you; begin 
by making yourself beloved, so that everybody—will try to 
please you. You will not be the child’s master unless you 
“are master of everything around him, and this authority will 
not suffice unless founded on esteem for virtue. 
There is no use in exhausting your purse by lavishing 
money: I have never observed that money made any one 
beloved. You must not be miserly or unfeeling, or lament 
the distress you can relieve; but you will open your coffers 
in vain if you do not open your heart; the hearts of others 
will be forever closed to you. You must give your time, 
your care, your affection, yourself. For whatever you may 
Jo, your money certainly is not yourself. Tokens of interest

and of kindness go farther and are of more use than any 
gifts whatever. How many unhappy persons, how many 
sufferers, need consolation far more than alms! How many 
who are oppressed are aided rather by protection than by 
money ! 
Reconcile those who are at variance; prevent lawsuits ; 
persuade children to filial duty and parents to gentleness. 
Encourage happy marriages ; hinder disturbances ; use freely 
the interest of your pupil’s family on behalf of the weak who 
are denied justice and oppressed by the powerful. Boldly 
declare yourself the champion of the unfortunate. Be just, 
humane, beneficent. Be not content with giving alms; be 
charitable. / Kindness relieves more distress than money can 
reach. Iyove others, and they will love you; serve them, 
and they will serve you; be their brother, and they will be 
your children. , 
Blame others no longer for the mischief you yourself are 
doing. Children are less corrupted by the harm they see 
than by that you teach them. 
Always preaching, always moralizing, always acting the 
pedant, you give them twenty worthless ideas when you 
think you are giving them one good one. / Full of what is 
passing in your own mind, you do not see the effect you are 
producing upon theirs. 
In the prolonged torrent of words with which you inces- 
santly weary them, do you think there are none they may 
misunderstand? Do you imagine that they will not comment 
in their own way upon your wordy explanations, and find in 
them a system adapted to their own capacity, which, if need 
be, they can use against you?

taken in his mind. He confounds one thing with another ; 
he reverses everything ; he tires you, sometimes worries you, 
by unexpected objections. He forces you to hold your 
peace, or to make him hold his. And what must he think of 
this silence, in one so fond of talking? If ever he wins this 
advantage and knows the fact, farewell to his education. 
He will no longer try to learn, but to refute what you say.

you can, for fear of conveying a bad one. On this earth, 
meant by nature to be man’s first paradise, beware lest you 
act the tempter by giving to innocence the knowledge of 
- good and evil. Since you cannot prevent the child’s learning 
from outside examples, restrict your care to the task of 
impressing these examples on his mind in suitable forms. 
Violent passions make a striking impression on the child 
who notices them, because their manifestations are well-de- 
fined, and forcibly attract his attention. Anger especially 
has such stormy indications that its approach is unmistakable. 
Do not ask, ‘‘ Is not this a fine opportunity for the pedagogue’s 
moral discourse?” Spare the discourse: say not a word: let’ 
the child alone. Amazed at what he sees, he will not fail to > 
question you. It will not be hard to answer him, on account’ 
of the very things that strike his senses. He sees an in- 
flamed countenance, flashing eyes, threatening gestures, he 
hears unusually excited tones of voice ; all sure signs that the 
body is not in its usual condition. Say to him calmly, un- 
affectedly, without any mystery, ‘‘This poor man is sick; he 
has a high fever.” You may take this occasion to give him, 
in few words, an idea of maladies and of their effects ; for 
these, being natural, are trammels of that necessity to which 
he has to feel himself subject. Zz
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
From this, the true idea, will he not early feel repugnance 
at giving way to excessive passion, which he regards as a 
disease? And do you not think that such an idea, given at 
the appropriate time, will have as good an effect as the most 
tiresome sermon on morals? Note also the future conse- 
quences of this idea; it will authorize you, if ever necessity 
arises, to treat a rebellious child as a sick child, to confine 
him to his room, and even to his bed, to make him undergo 
a course of medical treatment; to make his growing vices 
alarming and hateful to himself. He cannot consider as a 
punishment the severity you are forced to use in curing him. 
So that if you yourself, in some hasty moment, are perhaps 
stirred out of the coolness and moderation it should be your 
study to preserve, do not try to disguise your fault, but say 
to him frankly, in tender reproach, ‘* My boy, you have hurt 
me.” 
I do not intend to enter fully into details, but to lay down 
some general maxims and to illustrate difficult cases. I be- 
lieve it impossible, in the very heart of social surroundings, 
to educate a child up to the age of twelve years, without giv- 
ing him some ideas of the relations of man to man, and of 
morality in human actions. Alt will suffice if we put off as 
long as possible the necessity for these ideas, and when they 
must be given, limit them to such as are immediately appli- 
cable. We must do this only lest he consider himself master 
of everything, and so injure others without scruple, because 
unknowingly. There are gentle, quiet characters who, in 
their early innocence, may be led a long way without danger 
of this kind. But others, naturally violent, whose wildness 
is precocious, must be trained into men as early as may be, 
that you may not be obliged to fetter them outright. nN

He comes everyday to water the beans, and rejoices to

‘* belongs,” I make him feel that he has put into this plot of 
ground his time, his labor, his care, his bodily self ; that in 
it is a part of himself which he may claim back from any 
one whatever, just as he may draw his own arm back if 
another tries to hold it against his will. . 
One fine morning he comes as usual, running, watering-

of my labor, the sweet reward of all my care and toil?

of its first feeling of injustice. His eyes overflow with tears ;

gardener has done the deed: we send for him. 
But we find that we have reckoned without our host. 
When the gardener hears what we are complaining of, he 
complains more than we. 
‘What! So it was you, gentlemen, who ruined all my 
labor! I had planted some Maltese melons, from seed given 
me as a great rarity: I hoped to give you a grand treat with 
them when they were ripe. But for the sake of planting your 
miserable beans there, you killed my melons after they had 
actually sprouted; and there are no more to be had. You 
have done me more harm than you can remedy, and you 
have lost the pleasure of tasting some delicious melons.” 
Jean Jacquzs. ‘‘ Excuse us, my good Robert. You put 
into them your labor, your care. I see plainly that we did 
wrong to spoil your work: but we will get you some more 
Maltese seed, and we will not till any more ground without ‘ 
finding out whether some one else has put his hand 9* be-

Enz. ‘¢Mr. Robert, do you often lose your melon- 
seed?” 
Rosert. ‘‘ Pardon, my young master: we don’t often

Nobody touches his neighbor’s garden; everybody respects 
other people’s work, to make sure of his own.”

won’t let you walk in it any more; for you are to under-

In this essay on the manner of teaching fundamental no- 
tions to children it may be seen how the idea of property 
naturally goes back to the right which the first occupant 
acquired by labor. This is clear, concise, simple, and always 
within the comprehension of the child. From this to the 
right of holding property, and of transferring it, there is but 
one step, and beyond this we are to stop short. 
’ It will also be evident that the explanation I have included 
in two pages may, in actual practice, be the work of an entire 
year. For in the development of moral ideas, we cannot 
advance too slowly, or establish them too firmly at every step. 
I entreat you, young teachers, to think of the example I have 
given, and to remember that your lessons upon every subject 
ought to be rather in actions than in words; for children 
readily forget what is said or done to them. 
As I have said, such lessons ought to be given earlier or 
later, as the disposition of the child, gentle or turbulent, 
hastens or retards the necessity for giving them. Inem- 
ploying them, we call in an evidence that cannot be misun- 
derstood. But that in difficult cases nothing important may 
e omitted, let us give another illustration.

be vexed, but put out of his reach whatever he can spoil./

him night and day. Have no fear of his taking cold; he 
had better take cold than be a fool’ 
Do not fret at the inconvenience he causes you, but make 
him feel it first of all. Finally, without saying anything 
about it, have the panes of glass mended. He breaks them 
again. Change your method: say to him coolly and without 
anger, ‘‘ Those windows are mine ; I took pains to have them 
put there, and I am going to make sure that they shall not 
be broken again.” Then shut him up in some dark place 
where there are no windows. At this novel proceeding, he 
begins to cry and storm: but nobody listens to him. He 
soon grows tired of this, and changes his tone; he complains 
and groans. A servant is sent, whom the rebel entreats to 
set him free. Without trying to find any excuse for utter 
refusal, the servant answers, ‘‘I have windows to take care 
of, too,” and goes away. At last, after the child has been 
in durance for several hours, long enough to tire him and 
to make him remember it, some one suggests an arrangement 
by which you shall agree to release him, and he to break no 
more windows. He sends to beseech you to come and see 
him ; you come; he makes his proposal. You accept it im- 
mediately, saying, ‘‘ Well thought of ; that will be a good 
thing for both of us. Why didn’t you think of this capital 
plan before?” Then, without requiring any protestations, 
or confirmation of his promise, you gladly caress him and 
take him to his room at once, regarding this compact as 
sacred and inviolable as if ratified by an oath. What an idea 
of the obligation, and the usefulness, of an engagement will 
he not gain from this transaction! Iam greatly mistaken if 
there is an unspoiled child on earth who would be proof 
against it, or who would ever after think of breaking a win~ 
dow purposely. :

Falsehood. The Force of Example. 
WE are now within the domain of morals, and the door is 
open to vice. Side by side with conventionalities and duties 
spring up deceit and falsehood. As soon as there are things 
we ought not to do, we desire to hide what we ought not to 
stronger one may urge us to break the promise. Our chief 
concern is how to break it and still go unscathed. It is natu- 
ral to find expedients ; we dissemble and we utter falsehood. 
Unable to prevent this evil, we must nevertheless punish it. 
Thus the miseries of our life arise from our mistakes. 
~ I have said enough to show that_punishment, as such, 
should not be inflicted upon children, but should always. hap- 
~pen to them as the natural result of theirown wrong-doing. / 
Do not, then, preach to them against falsehood, or punish them 
confessedly on account of a falsehood. But if they.are guilty 
of one, let all its consequences fall heavily on their heads. 
Let them know what it is to be dishelieved.even when they 
speak the truth, and to be accused of faults in spite of their 
earnest denial. But let us inquire what falsehood is, in 
children. 
There are two kinds of falsehood; that of fact, which 
refers to things already past, and that of right, which has to 
do with the future. The first occurs when we deny doing 
what we have done, and in general, when we knowingly utter 
what is not true. The other occurs when we promise what 
we do not mean to perform, and, in general, when we 
express an intention contrary to the one we really have. 
These two sorts of untruth may sometimes meet in the same 
case; but let us here discuss their points of difference. 
One who realizes his need of help from others, and con-

stantly receives kindness from them, has nothing to gain by 
deceiving them. On the contrary, it is evidently his interest 
that they should see things as they are, lest they make mis- 
takes to his disadvantage. / It is clear, then, that the false- 
hood of fact is not natural/to children. But the law of obe- 
dience makes falsehood necessary ; because, obedience being 
irksome, we secretly avoid it whenever we can, and just in 
proportion as the immediate advantage of escaping reproof or 
punishment outweighs the remoter advantage to be gained by 
revealing the truth. / 
Why should a child educated naturally and in perfect free- 
dom, tell a falsehood? What has he to hide from you? You 
are not going to reprove or punish him, or exact anything 
from him. Why should he not tell you everything as frankly 
as to his little playmate? He sees no more danger in the ‘ 
one case than in the other. 
The falsehood of right is still less natural to children, 
because promises to do or not to do are conventional acts, 
foreign to our nature and infringements of our liberty. 
Besides, all the engagements of children are in themselves 
void, because, as their limited vision does not stretch beyond 
the present, they know not what they do when they bind 
themselves. . It is hardly possible for a child to tell a lie in 
making a promise. For, considering only how to overcome 
a present difficulty, all devices that have no immediate effect 
become alike to him. In promising for a time to come he 
actually does not promise at all, as his still dormant imagi- 
nation cannot extend itself over two different periods of ® 
time. If he could escape a whipping or earn some sugar- c 
plums by promising to throw himself out of the window to- 
morrow, he would at once promise it. Therefore the laws 
pay no regard to engagements made by children ; and when 
some fathers and teachers, more strict than this, require the
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
fulfilling of such engagements, it is only in things the child 
ought to do without promising. : 
As the child in making a promise is not aware what he is 
doing, he cannot be guilty of falsehood in so doing: but this 
is not the case when he breaks a promise. For he well 
remembers having made the promise ; what he cannot under- 
stand is, the importance of keeping it. Unable to read the 
future, he does not foresee the consequences of his actions; 
and when he violates engagements he does nothing con- 
trary to what might be expected of his years. 
_ It follows from this that all the untruths spoken by chil- 
dren are the fault of those who instruct them; and that 
endeavoring to teach them how to be truthful is only teach- 
ing them how to tell falsehoods. We are so eager to regu- 
late, to govern, to instruct them, that we never find means 
enough to reach our object. We want to win new victories 
over their minds by maxims not based upon fact, by unrea- 
sonable precepts; we would rather they should know their 
lessons and tell lies than to remain ignorant and speak the 
truth. 
As for us, who give our pupils none but practical teaching, 
and would rather have them good than knowing, we shall 
not exact the truth from them at all, lest they disguise it ; 
we will require of them no promises they may be tempted to 
break. If in my absence some anonymous mischief has been 
done, I will beware of accusing Emile, or of asking ‘Was 
it you?”! For what would that be but teaching him to deny 
it? If his naturally troublesome disposition obliges me to 
1Nothing is more injudicious than such a question, especially when the 
child is in fault. In that case, if he thinks you know what he has done, he 
will see that you are laying a snare for him, and this opinion cannot fail to 
set him against you. If he thinks you do not know he will say to himself, 
“* Why should I disclose my fault?’’ And thus the first temptation to false- 
hood is the result of your imprudent question. — [Note by J. J. Rousszav.]

make some agreement with him, I will plan so well that any 
such proposal shall come from him and never from me. Thus, 
whenever he is bound by an engagement he shall have an — 
immediate and tangible interest in fulfilling it. And if he 
ever fails in this, the falsehood shall bring upon him evil re- 
sults which he sees must arise from the very nature of things, 
and never from the vengeance of his tutor. Far from need- 
ing recourse to such severe measures, however, I am almost 
sure that Emile will be long in learning what a lie is, and 
upon finding it out will be greatly amazed, not understanding 
what is to be gained by it. It is very plain that the more 
I make his welfare independent of either the will or the 
judgment of others, the more I uproot within him all interest 
in telling falsehoods. 
When we are less eager to instruct we are also less eager 
to exact requirements from our pupil, and can take time to 
require only what is to the purpose. In that case, the child 
will be developed, just because he is not spoiled,/ But when 
some blockhead teacher, not understanding what he is about, 
continually forces the child to promise things, making no 
distinctions, allowing no choice, knowing no limit, the little 
fellow, worried and weighed down with all these obligations, 
neglects them, forgets them, at last despises them; and con- 
sidering them mere empty formulas, turns the giving and the 
breaking of them into ridicule. {If then you want to make 
him faithful to his word, be discreet in requiring him to give 
it. 
he details just entered upon in regard to falsehood may 
apply in many respects to all duties which, when enjoined 
upon children, become to them not only hateful but imprac- 
ticable. In order to seem to preach virtue we make vices 
attractive, and actually impart them by forbidding them. If 
we would haye the children religious, we tire them out taking i. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
    2 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
them to church. By making them mumble prayers inces- 
santly we make them sigh for the happiness of never praying 
at all. @ To inspire charity in them, we make them give alms, 
as if we disdained doing it ourselves. It is not the child, 
but his teacher, who Ought todo the giving. However much 
you love your pupil, this is an honor you ought to dispute 
with him, leading him to feel that he is not yet old enough 
to deserve it. 
Giving alms is the act of one who knows the worth of his 
gift, and his fellow-creature’s need of the gift. A child who 
knows nothing of either can have no merit in bestowing. 
He gives without charity or benevolence: he is almost 
ashamed to give at all, as, judging from your example and 
his own, only children give alms, and leave it off when grown 
up. Observe, that we make the child bestow only things 
whose value he does not know: pieces of metal, which he 
carries in his pocket, and which are good for nothing else. 
A child would rather give away a hundred gold pieces than 
a single cake. But suggest to this free-handed giver the 
idea of parting with what he really prizes—his playthings, 
his sugar-plums, or his luncheon; you will soon find out 
whether you have made him really generous. 
To accomplish the same end, resort is had to another expe- 
dient, that of instantly returning to the child what he has 
given away, so that he habitually gives whatever he knows 
will be restored to him. I have rarely met with other than 
these two kinds of generosity in children, namely, the giving 
either of what is no use to themselves, or else of what they 
are certain will come back to them. 
‘Do this,” says Locke, ‘‘ that they may be convinced by 
experience that he who gives most generously has always the 
better portion.” This is making him liberal in appearance 
and miserly in reality. He adds, that children will thus ac- 
quire the habit of generosity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
SE ap ee a ee ee 
FALSEHOOD. THE FORCE OF EXAMPLE. 73 
Yes; a miser’s generosity, giving an egg to gain an ox. 
But when called upon to be generous in earnest, good-bye 
to the habit; they soon cease giving when the gift no longer 
comes back to them. We ought to keep in view the habit of 
mind rather than that of the hands. Like this virtue are all 
others taught to children; and their early years are spent in 
sadness, that we may preach these sterling virtues to them! 
Excellent training this! 
Lay aside all affectation, you teachers; be yourselves 
good and virtuous, so that your example may be deeply-—— 
graven on your pupils’ memory until such time as it finds 
lodgment in their heart. Instead of early requiring acts of 
charity from my pupil I would rather de them in his pres- Lb 
ence, taking from him all means of imitating me, as if I con- 
sidered it an honor not due to his age. For he should by no 
means be in the habit of thinking a man’s duties the same as 
achild’s. Seeing me assist the poor, he questions me about 
it and, if occasion serve, I answer, ‘‘ My boy, it is because, 
since poor people are willing there should be rich people, the 
rich have promised to take care of those who have no money 
or cannot earn a living by their labor.” 
** And have you promised it too?” inquires he. 
‘* Of course; the money that comes into my hands is mine 
to use only upon this condition, which its owner has to 
carry out.” : 
After this conversation, and we have seen how a child may 
be prepared to understand it, other children besides Emile 
would be tempted to imitate me by acting like arichman. In 
this case I would at least see that it should not be done osten- 
tatiously. I would rather have him rob me of my right, and 
conceal the fact of his generosity. It would be a stratagem 
natural at his age, and the only one I would pardon in him. 
The only moral lesson suited to childhood and the most 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
74 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
GX: important at any age is, never to injure any one. Even the 
principle of doing good, if not subordinated to this, is danger- 
ous, false, and contradictory. For who does not do good? 
Everybody does, even a wicked man who makes one happy 
at the expense of making a hundred miserable: and thence 
arise all our calamities. | The most exalted virtues are nega- 
tive: they are hardest to attain, too, because they are unos- 
tentatious, and rise above even that gratification dear to the 
heart of man, —sending another person away pleased with 
us. If there be a man who never injures one of his fellow- 
creatures, what good must he achieve for them! What fear- 
lessness, what vigor of mind he requires for it! Not by 
reasoning about this principle, but by attempting to carry it 
into practice, do we find out how great it is, how hard to 
fulfil. 
The foregoing conveys some faint idea of the precautions 
I would have you employ in giving children the instructions 
we sometimes cannot withhold without risk of their injuring 
themselves or others, and especially of contracting bad habits 
of which it will by and by be difficult to break them. But 
we may rest assured that in children rightly educated the 
necessity will seldom arise; for it is impossible that they 
should become intractable, vicious, deceitful, greedy, unless 
the vices which make them so are sowed in their hearts. For 
this reason what has been said on this point applies rather to 
exceptional than to ordinary cases. But such exceptional 
cases become common in proportion as children have more 
frequent opportunity to depart from their natural state and 
to acquire the vices of their seniors. Those brought up among 
men of the world absolutely require earlier teaching in these 
matters than those educated apart from such surroundings. 
Hence this private education is to be preferred, even if it do 
< no more than allow childhood leisure to grow to perfection.

Exactiy contrary to the cases just described are those 
whom a happy temperament exalts above their years. As 
there are some men who never outgrow childhood, so there 
are others who never pass through it, but are men almost 
from their birth. The difficulty is that these exceptional 
cases are rare and not easily distinguished ; besides, _ all

“igy, have no doubt_that.-their-own-are-such: They go even 
farther than this: they take for extraordinary indications the 
sprightliness, the bright childish pranks and sayings, the 
shrewd simplicity of ordinary cases, characteristic of that 
time of life, and showing plainly that a child is only a child. 
Is it surprising that, allowed to speak so much and so freely, 
unrestrained by any consideration of propriety, a child should 
occasionally make happy replies? If he did not, it would be 
even more surprising ; just as if an astrologer, among a hun- 
dred false predictions, should never hit upon a single true 
one. ‘They lie so often,” said Henry IV., ‘‘ that they end 
by telling the truth.” To be a wit, one need only utter a 
great many foolish speeches. Heaven help men of fashion, 
whose reputation rests upon just this foundation ! 
The most brilliant thoughts may enter a child’s head, or 
rather, the most brilliant sayings may fall from his lips, just 
as the most valuable diamonds may fall into his hands, with- 
— out his having any right either to the thoughts or to the 
diamonds. At his age, he has no real property of any 
kind. A child’s utterances are not the same to him as to us; 
he does not attach to them the same ideas. If he has any 
ideas at all on the subject, they have neither order nor cohe- 
rence in his mind; in all his thoughts nothing is certain or 
stable. If you watch your supposed prodigy attentively, you

will sometimes find him a well-spring of energy, clear-sighted, 
penetrating the very marrow of things. Much oftener the 
same mind appears commonplace, dull, and as if enveloped 
in a dense fog. Sometimes he outruns you, and sometimes 
he stands still. At one moment you feel like saying, ‘‘ He is 
a genius,” and at another, ‘‘ He isafool.”” You are mistaken 
in either case: he is a child; he is an eaglet that one moment 
beats the air with its wings, and the next moment falls back 
into the nest. 
In spite of appearances, then, treat him as his age demands, 
and beware lest you exhaust his powers by attempting to use 
them too freely. If this young brain grows warm, if you 
see it beginning to seethe, leave it free to ferment, but do 
not excite it, lest it melt altogether into air. When the first 
flow of spirits has evaporated, repress and keep within 
bounds the rest, until, as time goes on, the whole is trans- 
formed into life-giving warmth and real power. Otherwise 
you will lose both time and pains ; you will destroy your own 
handiwork, and after having thoughtlessly intoxicated yourself 
with all these inflammable vapors, you will have nothing left 
but the dregs. 
Nothing has been more generally or certainly observed than 
that dull children make commonplace men. In childhood it 
is very difficult to distinguish real dullness from that mislead- 
ing apparent dullness which indicates a strong character. At 
first it seems strange that the two extremes should meet in 
indications so much alike; and yet such is the case. For at 
an age when man has no real ideas at all, the difference 
between one who has genius and one who has not is, that the 
latter entertains only mistaken ideas, and the former, encoun- 
tering only such, admits none at all. The two are therefore 
alike in this, that the dullard is capable of nothing, and the 
other finds nothing to suit him- The only means of distin-

guishing them is chance, which may bring to the genius some 
ideas he can comprehend, while the dull mind is always the 
same. 
During his childhood the younger Cato was at home con- 
sidered an idiot. No one said anything of him beyond that 
he was silent and headstrong. It was only in the antecham- 
ber of Sulla that his uncle learned to know him. If he had 
never crossed its threshold, he might have been thought a 
fool until he was grown. If there had been no such person 
as Cesar, this very Cato, who read the secret of Czesar’s fatal 
genius, and from afar foresaw his ambitious designs, would 
always have been treated as a visionary.1_ Those who judge 
of children so hastily are very liable to be mistaken. They 
are often more childish than the children themselves.

he ended his own life. When a child, he was often invited by his brother 
to the house of the all-powerful Sulla. The cruelties of the tyrant roused 
the boy to indignation, and it was necessary to watch him lest he should 
attempt to kill Sulla. It was in the latter’s antechamber that the scene 
described by Plutarch occurred.

about all day long? Never in all his life will he be so busy 
as now. Plato, in that work of his considered so severe, the 
‘‘ Republic,” would have children accustomed to festivals, 
games, songs, and pastimes ; one would think he was satisfied 
with having carefully taught them how to enjoy themselves. 
And Seneca, speaking of the Roman youth of old, says, 
‘« They were always standing ; nothing was taught them that 
they had to learn when seated.” Were they of less account 
when they reached manhood? Have no fear, then, of this 
supposed idleness. What would you think of a man who, in 
order to use his whole life to the best advantage, would not 
sleep? You would say, ‘‘ The man has no sense; he does 
not enjoy life, but robs himself of it. To avoid sleep, he 
rushes on his death.” The two cases are parallel, for child- 
~ hood is the slumber of reason. 
Apparent quickness in learning is the ruin of children. We 
do not consider that this very quickness proves that they are 
learning nothing. Their smooth and polished brain reflects 
like a mirror the objects presented to it, but nothing abides 
there, nothing penetrates it. The child retains the words; 
the ideas are reflected ; they who hear understand them, but 
he himself does not understand them at all. 
Although memory and reason are two essentially different 
faculties, the one is never really developed without the other. 
‘Before the age of reason, the child receives not ideas, but 
images. There is this difference between the two, that images 
are only absolute representations of objects of sense, and 
ideas are notions of objects determined by their relations. 
An image may exist alone in the mind that represents it, but 
every idea supposes other ideas. When we imagine, we only 
see; when we conceive of things, we compare them. Our 
sensations are entirely passive, whereas all our perceptions 
or ideas spring from an active principle which judges.

/I say then that children, incapable of judging, really have 
aio memory, They retain sounds, shapes;-sensations;—but 
rarely ideas, and still more rarely the relations of ideas to 
one another. If this statement is apparently refuted by the 
objection that they learn some elements of geometry, it is not 
really true; that very fact confirms my statement. It shows 
that, far from knowing how to reason themselves, they cannot 
even keep in mind the reasonings of others. For if you 
investigate the method of these little geometricians, you dis- 
cover at once that they have retained only the exact impres- 
sion of the diagram and the words of the demonstration. 
Upon the least new objection they are puzzled. Their 
knowledge is only of the sensation ; nothing has become the 
property of their understanding. Even their memory is 
rarely more perfect than their other faculties: for when 
grown they have nearly always to learn again as realities 
things whose names they learned in childhood. 
However, I am far from thinking that children have no 
power of reasoning whatever.!_ I observe, on the contrary, 
that in things they understand, things relating to their present 
and manifest interests, they reason extremely well. We are,

all the terms, and substitutes the definition for the term, is fine, but im- 
practicable ; for how shall we then avoid travelling in a circle? If defi- 
nitions could be given without using words, they might be useful. Never- 
theless, I am convinced that, poor as our language is, we can make our- 
selves understood, not by always attaching the same meaning to the same 
words, but by so using each word that its meaning shall be sufficiently 
determined by the ideas nearly related to it, and so that each sentence in 
which a word is used shall serve to define the word. Sometimes I say 
that children are incapable of reasoning, and sometimes I make them 
reason extremely well ; I think that my ideas do not contradict each other, 
though I cannot escape the inconvenient contradictions of my mode of 
expression. 4

however, liable to be misled as to their knowledge, attribut 
ing to them what they do not have, and making them reason 
about what they do not understand. Again, we make the 
-mistake of calling their attention to considerations by which 
they are in no wise affected, such as their future interests, 
the happiness of their coming manhood, the opinion people 
will have of them when they are grown up. Such speeches, 
addressed to minds entirely without foresight, are absolutely 
unmeaning. Now all the studies forced upon these poor 
unfortunates deal with things like this, utterly foreign to 
their minds. You may judge what attention such subjects 
are likely to receive. 
On the Study of Words. 
Prepacocuss, who make such an imposing display of what 
they teach, are paid to talk in another strain than mine, 
but their conduct shows that they think as I do. For after 
all, what do they teach their pupils? Words, words, words. 
Among all their boasted subjects, none are selected because 
they are useful; such would be the sciences of things, in 
which these professors are unskilful. But they prefer 
sciences we seem to know when we know their nomencla- 
ture, such as heraldry, geography, chronology, languages ; 
studies so far removed from human interests, and particu- 
larly from the child, that it would be wonderful if any of 
them could be of the least use at any time in life. 
(It may..cause surprise that I account the study of lan- 
(guages one of the useless things in education. But remember 
I am speaking of the studies of earlier years, and whatever 
may be said, I do not believe that any child except a prodigy, 
will ever learn two languages by the time he is twelve or 
fifteen.1

another language as perfectly as their own. There are three different

I admit that if the study of languages were only that 
of words, that is, of forms, and of the sounds which express 
them, it might be suitable for children. But languages, by 
changing their signs, modify also the ideas they represent. 
Minds are formed upon languages; thoughts take coloring 
from idioms. Reason alone is common to all. In each 
language the mind has its peculiar conformation, and thig 
may be in part the cause or the effect of national character. 
The fact that every nation’s language follows the vicissi- 
tudes of that nation’s morals, and is preserved or altered 
with them, seems to confirm this theory. 
Of these different forms, custom gives one to the child, 
and it is the only one he retains until the age of reason. In 
order to have two, he must be able to compare ideas; and 
how can he do this when he is scarcely able to grasp 
them? Each object may for him have a thousand different 
signs, but each idea can have but one form; he can there- 
fore learn to speak only one language. It is nevertheless 
maintained that he learns several; this I deny. I have 
seen little prodigies who thought they could speak six or 
seven: I have heard them speak German in Latin, French, 
and Italian idioms successively. They did indeed use five 
or six vocabularies, but they never spoke anything but Ger- 
man. In short, you may give children as many synonyms 
as you please, and you will change only their words, and not 
their language ; they will never know more than one. 
objects to be attained in studying languages. First, this study is meant to 
render easy by comparison and practice the knowledge and free use of 
the mother tongue. Second, it is useful as intellectual gymnastics, devel- 
oping attention, reflection, reasoning, and taste. This result is to be 
expected particularly from the study of the ancient languages. Third, 
it lowers the barriers separating nations, and furnishes valuable means 
of intercourse which science, industries, and commerce cannot afford 
to do without. The French have not always shown wisdom in ignoring 
the language of their neighbors or their rivals,
-P-A-G-E-82

To hide this inability we, by preference, give them prac- 
tice in the dead languages, of which there are no longer any 
' unexceptionable judges. The familiar use of these tongues 
having long been lost, we content ourselves with imitating 
what we find of them in books, and call this speaking them. 
If such be the Greek and Latin of the masters, you may 
judge what that of the children is. Scarcely have they 
learned by heart the rudiments, without in the least under- 
standing them, before they are taught to utter a French 
discourse in Latin words; and, when further advanced, to 
string together in prose, phrases from Cicero and cantos 
from Virgil. Then they imagine they are speaking Latin, 
and who is there to contradict them ?? 
In any study, words that represent things are nothing 
\ without the ideas of the things they represent.” We, however, 
limit children to these signs, without ever being able to make 
them understand the things represented. We think we are 
teaching a child the description of the earth, when he is merely 
learning maps. We teach him the names of cities, countries, 
rivers; he has no idea that they exist anywhere but on the 
map we use in pointing them out to him. I recollect seeing 
somewhere a text-book on geography which began thus: 
‘What is the world? A pasteboard globe.” Precisely 
such is the geography of children. I will venture to say that 
after two years of globes and cosmography no child of ten, 
by rules they give him, could find the way from Paris to 
St. Denis. I maintain that not one of them, from a plan of 
his father’s garden, could trace out its windings without 
going astray. And yet these are the knowing creatures who 
can tell you exactly where Pekin, Ispahan, Mexico, and all 
the countries of the world are. 
1 From this passage, it is plain that the objections lately raised by intel- 
ligent persons against the abuse of Latin conversations and verses are not 
of recent date, after all.
-P-A-G-E-83
ON THE STUDY OF WORDS. 88 
I hear it suggested that children ought to be engaged in 
studies in which only the eye is needed. This might be true 
if there were studies in which their eyes were not needed ; 
but I know of none such. 
A still more ridiculous method obliges children to study 
history, supposed to be within their comprehension because 
it is only a collection of facts.1 But what do we mean by 
facts? Do we suppose that the relations out of which historic 
facts grow are so easily understood that the minds of children 
grasp such ideas without difficulty? Do we imagine that the 
true understanding of events can be separated from that of 
their causes and effects? and that the historic and the moral 
are so far asunder that the one can be understood without 
the other? If in men’s actions you see only purely external 
and physical changes, what do you learn from history? 
Absolutely nothing ; and the subject, despoiled of all interest, 
no longer gives you either pleasure or instruction. If you 
intend to estimate actions by their moral relations, try to 
make your pupils understand these relations, and you will 
discover whether history is adapted to their years. — 
If there is no science in words, there is no study especially 
adapted to children. If they have no real ideas, they have 
no real memory ; for I do not call that memory which retains 
only impressions. Of what use is it to write on their minds 
a catalogue of signs that represent nothing to them? In 
learning the things represented, would they not also learn 
1 There is indeed a faulty method of teaching history, by giving children 
adry list of facts, names, and dates. On the other hand, to offer them 
theories upon the philosophy of history is quite as unprofitable. Yet it is 
not an absurd error, but a duty, to teach them the broad outlines of history, 
to tell them of deeds of renown, of mighty works accomplished, of men 
velebrated for the good or the evil they have done; to interest them in the 
past of humanity, be it melancholy or glorious. By abuse of logic Rous- 
seau, in protesting against one excess, falls into another.

the signs? Why do you give them the useless trouble ot 
learning them twice? Besides, you create dangerous preju- 
dices by making them suppose that science consists of words 
meaningless to them. The first mere word with which the 
child satisfies himself, the first thing he learns on the 
authority of another person, ruins his judgment. Long must 
he shine in the eyes of unthinking persons before he can 
repair such an injury to himself. 
No; nature makes the child’s brain so yielding that it re- 
ceives all kinds kinds of impressions ; not that we may make his child- 
‘hood a distressing burden to him by engraving on that brain 
dates, names of kings, technical terms in heraldry, mathe- 
matics, geography, and all such words, unmeaning to him 
and unnecessary to persons at any age in life. But all ideas 
that he can understand, and that are of use to him, all that 
conduce to his happiness and that will one day make his 
duties plain, should early write themselves there indelibly, to 
guide him through life as his condition and his intellect 
require. 
The memory of which a child is capable is far from inac- 
“ tive, even without the use of books. All he sees and hears 
impresseshim,and_he remembers it. He keeps a mental register of people’s sayings and doings. Everything around 
him is the book from which he is continually but uncon- 
sciously enriching his memory against the time his judgment 
can benefit by it. If we intend rightly to cultivate this chief 
faculty of the mind, we must choose these objects carefully, 
constantly acquainting him with such as he ought to under- 
stand, and keeping back those he ought not to know. In 
this way we should endeavor to make his mind a storehouse 
of knowledge, to aid in his education in youth, and to direct 
him at all times. This method does not, it is true, produce 
phenomenal children, nor does it make the reputation of their   
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  ON THE STUDY OF WORDS. 85 
teachers; but it produces judicious, robust men, sound in 
body and in mind, who, although not admired in youth, will 
make themselves respected in manhood. 
Emile shall never learn anything by heart, not even fables- 
such as those of La Fontaine, simple and charming as they 
are/ For the words of fables are no more the fables them- 
selves than the words of history are history itself. How can 
we be so blind as to call fables moral lessons for children? 
We do not reflect that while these stories amuse they also 
mislead children, who, carried away by the fiction, miss the 
truth conveyed ; so that what makes the lesson agreeable also 
makes it less profitable. Men may learn from fables, but 
children must be told the bare truth; if it be veiled, they do 
not trouble themselves to lift the veil. 
ince nothing ought to be required of children merely in 
proof of their obedience, it follows that they,can learn noth- 
ing of which they cannot understand the actual and immediate 
advantage, whether itbe pleasant or useful/ . Otherwise, what 
motive will induce them to learn it? The art of conversing 
with absent persons, and of hearing from them, of communi 
cating to them at a distance, without the aid of another, our 
feelings, intentions, and wishes, is an art whose value may 
be explained to children of almost any age whatever. By 
1 Rousseau here analyzes several of La Fontaine’s fables, to show the 
mmorality and the danger of their “ ethics.”” He dwells particularly upon 
he fable of the Fox and the Crow. In this he is right; the morality of the 
greater part of these fables leaves much to be desired. But there is noth- 
4ng to prevent the teacher from making the application. The memory of a 
child is pliable and vigorous; not to cultivate it would be doing him great 
injustice, We need not say that a true teacher not only chooses, but by his 
jnstructions explains and rectifies everything he requires his pupil to read 
or to learn by heart. With this reservation one cannot but admire this 
aversion of Rousseau’s for parrot-learning, word-worship, and exclusive 
cultivation of the memory. In a few pages may here be found a complete 
philosophy of teaching, adapted to the regeneration of a people. eae

    @tonishing process has this useful and agreeable art 
become so irksome to them? They have been forced to learn 
it in spite of. themselves, and to use it in ways they cannot 
understand. A child is not anxious to perfect the instrument 
used in tormenting him; but make the same thing minister 
to his pleasures, and you cannot prevent him from using it. 
Much attention is paid to finding out the best methods of 
teaching children to read. We invent printing-offices and 
charts; we turn a child’s room into a printer’s establish- 
ment.’ (Locke proposes teaching children to read by means 
of dice ; a brilliant contrivance indeed, but a mistake as well.

a printing-office, and was intended to teach, in an agreeable way, not only 
reading, but even grammar and spelling. There may be good features in 
all these systems, but we certainly cannot save the child all trouble; we 
ought to let him understand that work must be in earnest. Besides, as 
moralists and teachers, we ought not to neglect giving children some kinds 
of work demanding application. They will be in better spirits for recrea- 
tion hours after study. 
2 It is well to combine the two methods; to keep the child occupied with 
what immediately concerns him, and to interest him also in what is more 
remote, whether in space or in time. He ought not to become too positive,

tion becomes active, it acquires discernment suited to its 
powers, and the surplus of strength needed to preserve it 
is absolutely necessary in developing that speetlative faculty 
which uses the same surplus for other ends. If, then, you

strength it is intended to ony Give him constant physi- 
eal exercise ; make his body sdund and robust, that you may 
make him wise and reasonable. Let him be at work doing 
something ; let him run, shout, be always in motion; let him 
be a man in vigor, and he will the sooner become one in- 
reason. 
You would indeed make a mere animal of him by this 
method if you are continually directing him, and saying, 
“Go; come; stay; do this; stop doing that.” If your 
head is always to guide his arm, his own head will be of no 
use to him. But recollect our agreement; if you are a mere 
pedant, there is no use in your reading what I write. :

running to others for advicey Still less does he make a dis- } 
play of his knowledge. Ox the other hand, he judges, he 
foresees, he reasons, upon everything that immediately con- 
cerns him ; he does not prate, but acts. He is little informed 
as to what is going on in the world, but knows very well what 
he ought to do, and how to do it. Incessantly in motion, 
he cannot ayoid observing many things, and knowing many 
effects. He early gains a wide experience, and takes his les- ‘

sons from nature, not from men. He instructs himself all 
the better for discovering nowhere any intention of instruct- 
ing him. Thus, at the same time, body and mind are exer- 
cised. Always carrying out his own ideas, and not another 
person’s, two processes are simultaneously going on within 
him. / As he grows robust and strong, he becomes intelligent 
~ and judicious. | 
In this way he will one day have those two excellences, — 
thought incompatible indeed, but characteristic of nearly all 
great men,—strength of body and strength of mind, the 
reason of a sage and the vigor of an athlete.

‘the art of governing without rules, and of doing everything 
by doing nothing at all,7T grant, that at your age, this art 
is not to be expected of you. It will not enable you, at the 
outset, to exhibit your shining talents, or to make yourself 
prized by parents; but it is the only one that will succeed. 
To be a sensible man, your pupil must first have been a 
little scapegrace. The Spartans were educated in this way ; 
not tied down to books, but obliged to steal their dinners ;* 
and did this produce men inferior in understanding? Who 
does not remember their forcible, pithy sayings? Trained 
to conquer, they worsted their enemies in every kind of en- 
counter; and the babbling Athenians dreaded their sharp 
speeches quite as much as their valor.

can buy a week’s indulgence. At every moment you have 
, to make terms with him. These bargains, which you pro- 
pose in your way, and which he fulfils in his own way, 
always turn out to the advantage of his whims, especially 
when you are so careless as to make stipulations which will 
be to his Soar whether he carries out his share of the

while the latter, having no immediate interest in knowing the

for thus the will itself is made captive. Is not the helpless, :

is concerned, control everything around him? Have you not 
power to influence him as you please? Are not his work, his 
play, his pleasure, his pain, in your hands, whether he knows 
it or not? 
Doubtless he ought to do only what he pleases; but your 
choice ought to control his wishes. He ought to take no 
step that you have not directed; he ought not to open his 
lips without your knowing what he is about to say. 
In this case he may, without fear of debasing his mind, 
devote himself to exercises of the body. Instead of sharp- 
ening his wits to escape an irksome subjection, you will ob- 
serve him wholly occupied in finding out in everything around 
him that part best adapted to his present well-being. You 
will be amazed at the subtilty of his contrivances for appro- 
priating to himself all the objects within the reach of his

understanding, and for enjoying everything without regard 
to other people’s opinions. 
By thus leaving him free, you will not foster his caprices. 
Tf he never does anything that does not suit him, he will 
soon do only what he ought todo. And, although his body 
be never at rest, still, if he is caring for his present and per- 
ceptible interests, all the reason of which he is capable will 
develop far better and more appropriately than in studies 
purely speculative. 
As he does not find you bent on thwarting him, does not 
distrust you, has nothing to hide from you, he will not 
deceive you or tell you lies. He will fearlessly show him- 
self to you just as he is. You may study him entirely at 
your ease, and plan lessons for him which he will all uncon- 
sciously receive. 
He will not pry with suspicious curiosity into your affairs, 
and feel pleasure when he finds you in fault. This is one 
of our most serious dissdvaniages/ As I have said, one of 
a child’s first objects is to discover the weaknesses of those 
who have control of him. \/This disposition may produce ill- 
nature, but does not arise from it, but from their desire to 
“escape an irksome bondage. Oppressed by the yoke laid 
upon them, children endeavor to shake it off; and the faults 
hey find in their teachers yield them excellent means for 
doing this. But they acquire the habit of observing faults 
in others, and of enjoying such discoveries. This source of 
evil evidently does not exist in Emile. Having no interest 
to serve by discovering my faults, he will not look for them 
in me, and will have little temptation to seek them in other 
people. 
This course of conduct seems difficult because we do not 
reflect upon it ; but taking it altogether, it ought not to be so.

stand the business you have undertaken; that you know the 
natural progress of the human mind; that you understand 
studying mankind in general and in individual cases; that 
among all the objects interesting to his age that you mean to 
show your pupil, you know beforehand which of them will 
influence his will. 
Now if you have the appliances, and know just how to use 
them, are you not master of the operation? 
You object that children have caprices, but in this you are 
mistaken. These caprices result from faulty discipline, and 
are not natural. The children have been accustomed either 
to obey or to command, and I have said a hundred times that 
neither of these two things is necessary. Your pupil will 
therefore have only such caprices as you give him, and it is 
just you should be punished for your own faults. But do 
you ask how these are to be remedied? It can still be done 
by means of better management and much patience. 
Physical Training. 
Man’s first natural movements are for the purpose of 
comparing himself with whatever surrounds him and finding 
in each thing those sensible qualities likely to affect himself. “ 
His first study is, therefore, a kind of experimental physics 
relating to his own preservation. From this, before he has 
fully understood his place here on earth, he is turned aside 
to speculative studies. While yet his delicate and pliable 
organs can adapt themselves to the objects upon which they 
are to act, while his senses, still pure, are free from illusion, 
it is time to exercise both in their peculiar functions, and to NS 
__learn_the perceptible relations between ourselves and out- 
“ward things. Since whatever enters the human understand- 
ing enters by the senses, man’s primitive reason ig a reason

       ~~ of the senses, serving as foundation for the reason of the 
~~ intellect. / Our first teachers in philosophy are our own 
feet, hands, and eyes. / To substitute books for these is 
teaching us not to reason; but to use the reason of another ; 
to believe a great deal, and to know nothing at all. 
In practising an art we must begin by procuring appar- 
atus for it; and to use this apparatus to advantage, we 
must have it solid enough to bear use. |In learning to 
think, we must therefore employ our members, our senses, 
our organs, all which are the apparatus of our understanding.’ 
And to use them to the best advantage, the body which 
“furnishes them must be sound and robust. Our reason is 
therefore so far from being independent of the body, that 
a good constitution renders mental operations easy and 
accurate. In indicating how the long leisure of childhood 
ought to be employed, I am entering into particulars which 
may be thought ridiculous. ‘‘ Pretty lessons,” you will tell 
me, ‘‘ which you yourself criticize for teaching only what 
there is no need of learning! Why waste time in instruc- 
tions which always come of their own accord, and cost neither 
care nor trouble? What child of twelve does not know all 
you are going to teach yours, and all that his masters 
have taught him besides?” 
Gentlemen, you are mistaken. I am teaching my pupil 
a very tedious and difficult art, which yours certainly have 
not acquired, — that of being ignorant. For the knowledge 
of one who gives himself credit for knowing only what he 
really does know reduces itself to a very small compass. 
You are teaching science: very good ; I am dealing with the 
instrument by which science is acquired. All who have 
reflected upon the mode of life among the ancients attribute 
to gymnastic exercises that vigor of body and mind which 
so notably distinguishes them from us moderns. Montaigne’s

support of this opinion shows that he had fully adopted it; 
he returns to it again and again, in a thousand ways. 
Speaking of the education of a child, he says, ‘/We must 
make his mind robust by hardening his muscles; inure him 
to pain by accustoming him to labor; break him by severe 
exercise to the keen pangs of dislocation, of colic, of other 
ailments.” , The wise Locke,! the excellent Rollin,? the 
learned Fleury,? the pedantic de Crouzas,4 so different in 
everything else, agree exactly on this point of abundant 
physical exercise for children. “It is the-wisest lesson they 
ever taught, but the one that ig and always will be most |

Clothing. 
As to clothing, the limbs of a growing body shoud be }-—

their growth ; nothing should fit too closely or bind the body ; 
there should be no ligatures whatever. The present French 
dress cramps and disables even a man, and is especially 
injurious to children. It arrests the circulation of the humors ; 
they stagnate from an inaction made worse by a sedentary 
life. This corruption of the humors brings on the scurvy, 
a disease becoming every day more common among us, but 
unknown to the ancients, protected from it by their dress and 
their mode of life. The ‘hussar dress does not remedy this

ot take better care of your clothes, you shall be dressed 
like that little rustic.” This is saying to him, ‘‘ Rest assured 
that a man is nothing but what his clothes make him; your 
(_»wn worth depends on what you wear.” Is it surprising 
7 that sage lessons like this so influence young men that they 
care for nothing but ornament, and judge of merit by outward 
pebpentnnce only? 
Generally, children are too warmly clothed, especially in 
their earlier years. They should be inured to cold rather 
than heat; severe cold never incommodes them when they 
ncounter it early. But the tissue of their skin, as yet 
yielding and tender, allows too free passage to perspiration, 
and exposure to great heat invariably weakens them. It has 
been observed that more children die in August than in any

other month. Besides, if we compare northern and southern 
races, we find that excessive cold, rather than excessive 
heat, makes man robust. In proportion as the child grows 
and his fibres are strengthened, accustom him gradually to 
withstand heat; and by degrees you will without risk train 
him to endure the glowing temperature of the torrid zone. 
Sleep. 
} 
| Curpren need a great deal of sleep because they take a .\ 
great deal of exercise. /The one acts as corrective to the 
other, so that both are necessary. As nature teaches us, 
night is the time for rest., Constant observation shows that 
sleep is softer and more profound while the sun is below the 
horizon. The heated air does not so perfectly tranquillize 
our tired senses. For this reason the most salutary habit is 
to rise and to go to rest with the sun. In our climate man, 
and animals generally, require more sleep in winter than in 
summer. But our mode of life is not so simple, natural, and 
uniform that we can make this regular habit a necessity. 
We must without doubt submit to regulations ; but it is most 
important that we should be able to break them without risk 
when occasion requires. Do not then imprudently soften 
your pupil by letting him lie peacefully asleep without ever 
being disturbed. At first let him yield without restraint to 
the law of nature, but do not forget that in our day we must 
be superior to this law; we must be able to go late to rest 
and rise early, to be awakened suddenly, to be up all night, 
without discomfort. By beginning early, and by always 
proceeding slowly, we form the constitution by the very 
practices which would ruin it if it were already established. 
It is important that your pupil should from the first be 
accustomed to a hard bed, so that he may find none uncom: 
fortable.

     Generally, a life of hardship, when we are used to it, gives 
“us a far greater number of agreeable sensations than does a 
life of ease, which creates an infinite number of unpleasant 
ones./ One too delicately reared can find sleep only upon a 
bed of down; one accustomed to bare boards can find it any-

slumber. 
—“ Exercise of the Senses. 
vA A cup has not a man’s stature, strength, or reason; but 
he sees and hears almost or quite as well. His sense of taste 
is as keen, though he does not enjoy it as a pleasure. 
~~ Our senses are the first powers perfected in us. They are 
the first that should be cultivated and the only ones forgotten, 
or at least, the most neglected. 
To exercise the senses is not merely to use them, but to 
” learn how to judge correctly by means of them; we may say, 
to learn how to feel. For we cannot feel, or hear, or see, 
otherwise than as we have been taught. 
There is a kind of exercise, purely natural and mechanical, 
that renders the body robust without injuring the mind. Of 
this description are swimming, running, leaping, spinning 
tops, and throwing stones. All these are well enough; but 
have we nothing but arms and legs? Have we not eyes and 
ears as well? and are they of no use while the others are em- 
ployed ?/ Use, then, not only your bodily strength, but all 
the senses which direct if. Male-as-much of ach” as ‘POSsi=—=

| after you have calculated the resistance it will meet. Be 
careful to estimate the effect before you use the means. In- 
terest the child in never making any useless or inadequate 
trials of strength. If you accustom him to forecast the 
effect of every movement, and to correct his errors by expe- 
rience, is it not certain that the more he does the better his 
judgment will be? 4 
If the lever he uses in moving a heavy weight be too long, 
he will expend too much motion; if too short, he will not 
have power enough. Experience will teach him to choose 
one exactly suitable. Such practical knowledge, then, is not 
beyond his years. If he wishes to carry a burden exactly as 
heavy as his strength will bear, without the test of first lift- 
ing it, must he not estimate its weight by the eye? If he 
understands comparing masses of the same material but of 
different size, let him choose between masses of the same 
size but of different material. This will oblige him to com- 
pare them as to specific gravity. Ihave seen a well-educated 
young man who, until he had tried the experiment, would 
not believe that a pail full of large chips weighs less than it 
does when full of water.   
The Sense of Touch. 
We have not equal control of all our senses. One of 
them, the sense of touch, is in continual action so long as 
we are awake. Diffused over the entire surface of the body, 
it serves as a perpetual sentinel to warn us of what is likely © 
to harm us. By the constant use of this sense, voluntary 
or otherwise, we gain our earliest experience. It therefore 
stands less in need of special cultivation. We observe how- 
ever, that the blind have a more delicate and accurate touch 
than we, because, not having sight to guide them, they 
flepend upon touch for the judgments we form with the aid

of sight. Why then do we not train ourselves to walk, like 
them, in the dark, to recognize by the touch all bodies we | 
can reach, to judge of objects around us, in short, to do by 
| night and in the dark all they do in daytime without eye- 
sight? So long as the sun shines, we have the advantage of 
them; but they can guide us in darkness. We are blind © 
n during half our life-time, with this difference, that the really 
blind can always guide themselves, whereas we dare not 
take a step in the dead of night. You may remind me 
that we have artificial light. What! must we always use 
machines? Who can insure their being always at hand when 
we need them? For my part, I prefer that Emile, instead 
of keeping his eyes in a chandler’s shop, should hye them 
at the ends of his fingers. 
s much as possible, let him be accustomed to pty about 
at night. This advice is more important than it would seem. 
For men, and sometimes for animals, night has naturally its 
terrors. Rarely do wisdom, or wit, or courage, free us from . 
paying tribute to these terrors. I have seen reasoners, free- 
thinkers, philosophers, soldiers, who were utterly fearless in 
a, daylight, tremble like women at the rustle of leaves 
by night. Such terrors are supposed to be the result of 
S nursery tales: The real cause is the same thing which makes 
S 
v   
the deaf distrustful, and the lower classes superstitious ; and 
that is, ignorance of objects and events around us. 
The cause of the evil, once found, suggests the remedy. 
In everything, habit benumbs the imagination ; new objects 
alone quicken it again. Every-day objects keep active not 
the imagination, but the memoty; whence the saying ‘‘ Ab 
assuetis non fit passio.”1 For only the imagination can set 
on fire our passions. If, therefore, you wish to cu any one 
of the fear of darkness, do a7 with him. i Take him 
1 «Passion is not pen yf familiar things.’ of

  THE SENSE OF TOUCH. 99 
into the dark often, and you may be sure that will do him 
more good than philosophical arguments. When at work on 
the roofs of houses, slaters do not feel their heads swim ; 
and those accustomed to darkness do not fear it at all. 
There will be one advantage of our plays in the dark. 
But if you mean them to be successful, you must make them 
as gay as possible. Darkness is of all things the most > 
gloomy ; so do not shut your child up in a dungeon. When 
he goes into the dark make him laugh; when he leaves it 
make him laugh again; and all the time he is there, let the 
thought of what he is enjoying, and what he will find there 
when he returns, protect him from the shadowy terrors which 
might otherwise inhabit it. 
I have heard some propose to teach children not to be 
afraid at night, by surprising them. This is a bad plan, and 
its effect is contrary to the one sought: it only makes them 
more timid than before. Neither reason nor habit can 
accustom us to a present danger, the nature and extent of 
which we do not know, nor can they lessen our dread of 
unexpected things however often we meet with them. But 
how can we guard our pupil against such accidents? I think 
the following is the best plan. I will tell my Emile, “If 
any one attacks you at night, you are justified in defending 
yourself ; for your assailant gives you no notice whether he 
means to hurt you or only to frighten you. As he has, 
taken you at a disadvantage, seize him boldly, uo matter 
what he may seem to be. Hold him fast, and if he offers 
any resistance, hit him hard and often. Whatever he may 
say or do, never let go until you know exactly who he is. 
‘The explanation will probably show you that there is nothing 
to be afraid of; and if you treat a practical joker in this 
way, he will not be likely tory the same thing again.” 
Although; of all our senses, touch is the one most cons

  stantly used, still, as I have said, its conclusions are the 
most rude and imperfect. This is because it is always used 
at the same time with sight; and because the eye attains its 
object sooner than the hand; the mind nearly always decides 
without appealing to touch. On the other hand, the decis- 
ions of touch, just because they are so limited in their range, 
are the most accurate. For as they extend no farther than 
our arm’s length, they correct the errors of other senses, 
which deal with distant objects, and scarcely grasp these 
objects at all, whereas all that the touch perceives it per- 
ceives thoroughly. Besides, if to nerve-force we add muscu- 
lar action, we form a simultaneous impression, and judge of 
weight and solidity as well as of temperature, size, and shape. 
Thus touch, which of all our senses best informs us concern- 
ing impressions made upon us by external things, is the one 
oftenest used, and gives us most directly the knowledge 
necessary to our preservation. 
The Sense of Sight. 
Tue sense of touch confines its operations to a very nar- 
row sphere around us, but those of sight extend far beyond ; 
this sense is therefore liable to be mistaken. With a single 
glance a man takes in half his own horizon, and in these 
myriad impressions, and judgments resulting from them, 
how is it credible that there should be no mistakes? Sight, 
therefore, is the most defective of all our senses, precisely — 
because it is most far-reaching, and because its operations, 
by far preceding all others, are too immediate and too vast 
to receive correction from them. Besides, the very illusions 
of perspective are needed to make us understand extension, 
and to help us in comparing its parts. If there were no false 
appearances, we could see nothing at a distance; if there
-P-A-G-E-101
    THE SENSE OF SIGHT. 101 
were no gradations in size, we could form no estimate of dis- 
tance, or rather there would be no distance at all. If of two 
trees the one a hundred paces away seemed as large and dis- 
tinct as the other, ten paces distant, we should place them 
side by side. If we saw all objects in their true dimensions, 
we should see no space whatever; everything would appear 
to be directly beneath our eye. 
For judging of the size and distance of objects, sight has 
only one measure, and that is the angle they form with our 
eye. As this is the simple effect of a compound cause, the 
judgment we form from it leaves each particular case unde- 
cided or is necessarily imperfect. For how can I by the 
sight alone tell whether the angle which makes one object 
appear smaller than another is caused by the really lesser 
magnitude of the object or by its greater distance from me? 
An opposite » method must therefore be pursued. Instead 
of relying on one sensation only, we must repeat it, verify it 
by others, subordinate sight to touch, repressing the impetu- 
osity of the first by the steady, even pace of the second. 
For lack of this caution we measure very inaccurately by the 
eye, in determining height, length, depth, and distance. 
That this is not due to organic defect, but to careless use, 
is proved by the fact that engineers, surveyors, architects, 
. masons, and painters generally have a far more accurate eye 
than we, and estimate measures of extension more correctly. 
Their business gives them experience that we neglect to 
acquire, and thus they correct the ambiguity of the angle by 
means of appearances associated with it, which enable them 
to determine more exactly the relation of the two things pro- 
ducing the angle. 
Children are easily led into anything that allows uncon- 
strained movement of the body. There are a thousand ways 
of interesting them in measuring, discovering, and estimating
-P-A-G-E-102
102 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
  distances. ‘‘ Yonder is a very tall cherry-tree ; how can we 
manage to get some cherries? Will the ladder in the barn 
do? There is a very wide brook; how can we cross it? 
Would one of the planks in the yard be long enough? We 
want to throw a line from our windows and catch some fish 
in the moat around the house; how many fathoms long 
ought the line to be? I want to put up a swing between 
those two trees; would four yards of rope be enough for it? 
They say that in the other house our room will be twenty- 
five feet square; do you think that will suit us? Will it be 
larger than this? We are very hungry; which of those two 
villages yonder can we reach soonest, and have our dinner?” 
As the sense of sight is the one least easily separated from 
the judgments of the mind, we need a great deal of time for 
learning how to see. We must for a long time compare sight 
with touch, if we would accustom our eye to report forms 
and distances accurately. 
Without touch and without progressive movement, the 
keenest eye-sight in the world could give us no idea of 
extent. To an oyster the entire universe must be only a 
single point. Only by walking, feeling, counting, and meas- 
uring, do we learn to estimate distances. 
If we always measure them, however, our eye, depending 
on this, will never gain accuracy. Yet the child ought not 
to pass too soon from measuring to estimating. It will be 
better for him, after comparing by parts what he cannot 
compare as wholes, finally to substitute for measured aliquot 
parts others, obtained by the eye alone. He should train 
himself in this manner of measuring instead of always 
measuring with the hand. I prefer that the very first 
operations-of this kind should be verified by actual meas- 
urements, so that he may correct the mistakes arising from 
false appearances by a better judgment. There are natural 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
     
    DRAWING. 103 
measures, nearly the same everywhere, such as a man’s 
pace, the length of his arm, or his height. When the child 
is calculating the height of the story of a house, his tutor 
muy serve as a unit of measure. In estimating the altitude 
of a steeple, he may compare it with that of the neighboring 
houses. If he wants to know how many leagues there are 
in a given journey, let him reckon the number of hours 
spent in making it on foot. And by all means do none of 
this work for him; let him do it himself. 
We cannot learn to judge correctly of the extent and size 
of bodies without also learning to recognize their forms, and 
even to imitate them. For such imitation is absolutely de- 
pendent on the laws of perspective, and we cannot estimate 
extent from appearances without some appreciation of these 
laws.

would make him draw from drawings only. He shall have 
no teacher but nature; no models _but_real things. He shall 
have before his eyes the originals, and not the paper which 
represents them. He shall draw a house from a real house, 
a tree from a tree, a human figure from the man himself. In 
this way he will accustom himself to observe bodies and their 
appearances, and not mistake for accurate imitations those 
  sake of the art itself, but to render the eye true and thed i

that are false and conventional, “I should even object to mms 
drawing anything from.memory, until by frequent observa- 
tions the exact forms of the objects had clearly imprinted 
themselves on his imagination, lest, substituting odd and 
fantastic shapes for the real things, he might loose the 
knowledge of proportion and a taste for the beauties of 
nature. I know very well that he will go on daubing for a 
long time without making anything worth noticing, and will 
be long in mastering elegance of outline, and in acquiring 
e deft stroke of a skilled draughtsman. He may never 
learn to discern picturesque effects, or draw with superior 
skill, On the other hand, he will have amore correct eye, a 
truer hand, a knowledge of the real relations of size and 
shape in animals, plants, and natural bodies, and practical 
experience of the illusions of perspective. This is precisely 
what I intend; not so much that he shall imitate objects as 
that he shall know them. I would rather have him show me 
an acanthus than a finished drawing of the foliation of a 
capital. 
Yet I would not allow my pupil to have the enjoyment of 
this or any other exercise all to himself. By sharing it with 
him I will make him enjoy it still more. He shall have no 
competitor but myself; but/I will be thas-competitor-con=~ 
tinually, and without risk /of jealousy between us. It will 
only interest him more deeply in his studies. Like him IT 
will take up the pencil, and at first I will be as awkward as 
he. If I were an Apelles, even, I will make myself a mere 
dauber. 
I will begin by sketching a man just as a boy would sketch 
one on a wall, with a dash for each arm, and with fingers 
larger than the arms. By and by one or the other of ug 
will discover this disproportion. We shall observe that a 
leg has thickness, and that this thickness is not the same

everywhere ; that the length of the arm is determined by its 
proportion to the body; and soon. As we go on I will do 
no more than keep even step with him, or will excel him by 
so little that he can always easily overtake and even surpass 
me. We will get colors and brushes ; we will try to imitate 
not only the outline but the coloring and all the other details 
of objects. We will color; we will paint; we will daub; 
but in all our daubing we shall be continually peering into 
nature, and all we do shall be done under the eye of that 
great teacher. 
If we had difficulty in finding decorations for our room, 
we have now all we could desire. I will have our drawings 
framed, so that we can give them no finishing touches; and 
this will make us both careful to do no negligent work. I 
will arrange them in order around our room, each drawing 
repeated twenty or thirty times, and each repetition showing 
the author’s progress, from the representation of a house by 
an almost shapeless attempt at a square, to the accurate 
copy of its front elevation, profile, proportions, and shading. 
The drawings thus graded must be interesting to ourselves, 
curious to others, and likely to stimulate further effort. I 
will inclose the first and rudest of these in showy gilded 
frames, to set them off well; but as the imitation improves, 
and when the drawing is really good, I will add only a very 
simple black frame. The picture needs no ornament but 
itself, and it would be a pity that the bordering should 
receive half the attention. 
Both of us will aspire to the honor of a plain frame, and 
if either wishes to condemn the other’s drawing, he will say 
it ought to have a gilt frame. Perhaps some day these 
gilded frames will pass into a proverb with us, and we shall 
be interested to observe how many men do justice to them: 
selves by framing themselves in the very same way.

Geometry. 
I wave said that geometry is not intelligible to children; 
but it is our own fault. We do not observe that their 
method is different from ours, and that what is to us the art 
of reasoning should be to them only the art of seeing. 
Instead of giving them our method, we should do better to 
take theirs. For in our way of learning geometry, imagina- 
tion really does as much as reason. When a proposition is 
stated, we have to imagine the demonstration; that is, we 
have to find upon what proposition already known the new 
one depends, and from all the consequences of this known 
principle select just the one required. According to this 
method the most exact reasoner, if not naturally inventive, 
must be at fault. And the result is that the teacher, instead 
of making us discover demonstrations, dictates them to us; 
instead of teaching us to reason, he reasons for us, and 
exercises only our memory. 
Make the diagrams accurate; combine them, place them 
one upon another, examine their relations, and you will 
discover the whole of elementary geometry by proceeding 
from one observation to another, without using either defi- 
nitions or problems, or any form of demonstration than 
simple superposition. For my part, I do not evenpretend to 
teach Emile geometry ; he shall teach it to me. I will look 
for relations, and he shall discover them. J will look for 
them in a way that will lead him to discover them. In 
drawing a circle, for instance, I will not use a compass, but 
a point at the end of a cord which turns on a pivot. After- 
ward, when I want to compare the radii of a semi-circle, 
Emile will laugh at me and tell me that the same cord, held 
with the same tension, cannot describe unequal distances. 
‘When I want to measure an angle of sixty degrees, I will
-P-A-G-E-107
GEOMETRY. 107 
describe from the apex of the angle not an arc only, but an 
entire circle; for with children nothing must be taken for 
granted. I find that the portion intercepted by the two sides 
of the angle is one-sixth of the whole circumference. After- 
ward, from the same centre, I describe another and a larger 
circle, and find that this second arc is one-sixth of the new 
circumference. Describing a third concentric circle, I test it 
in the same way, and continue the process with other concen- 
tric circles, until Emile, vexed at my stupidity, informs me 
that every arc, great or small, intercepted by the sides of this 
angle, will be one-sixth of the circumference to which it 
belongs. You see we are almost ready to use the instruments 
intelligently. 
In order to prove the angles of a triangle equal to two right 
angles, a circle is usually drawn. I, on the contrary, will 
call Emile’s attention to this in the circle, and then ask him, 
“* Now, if the circle were taken away, and the straight lines 
were left, would the size of the angles be changed?” 
It is not customary to pay much attention to the accuracy 
of figures in geometry; the accuracy is taken for granted, 
and the demonstration alone is regarded. Emile and I will 
pay no heed to the demonstration, but aim to draw exactly 
straight and even lines; to make a square perfect and a circle 
round. To test the exactness of the figure we will examine 
it in all its visible properties, and this will give us daily 
opportunity of finding out others. We will fold the two 
halves of a circle on the line of the diameter, and the halves 
of a square on its diagonal, and then examine our two fig- 
ures to see which has its bounding lines most nearly coinci- 
dent, and is therefore best constructed. We will debate as 
to whether this equality of parts exists in all parallelograms, 
trapeziums, and like figures. Sometimes we will endeavor 
to guess at the result of the experiment before we make it,
-P-A-G-E-108
  108 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
and sometimes to find out the reasons why it should result as 
it does. 
Geometry for my pupil is only the art of using the rule and 
compass well. It should not be confounded with drawing, 
which uses neither of these instruments. The rule and com- 
pass are to be kept under lock and key, and he shall be 
allowed to use them only occasionally, and for a short time, 
lest he fall into the habit of daubing. But sometimes, when 
we go for a walk, we will take our diagrams with us, and talk 
about what we have done or would like to do. 
Hearing. 
Wuar has been said as to the two senses most continually 
employed and most important may illustrate the way in which 
I should exercise the other senses. Sight and touch deal 
alike with bodies at rest and bodies in motion. But as only 
the vibration of the air can arouse the sense of hearing, noise 
or sound can be made only by a body in motion. If every- 
thing were at rest, we could not hear at all. At night, when 
we move only as we choose, we have nothing to fear except 
from other bodies in motion. We therefore need quick ears 
to judge from our sensations whether the body causing them 
is large or small, distant or near, and whether its motion is 
violent or slight. The air, when in agitation, is subject to 
reverberations which reflect it back, produce echoes, and 
repeat the sensation, making the sonorous body heard else- 
where than where it really is.) / Jn a plain or valley, if you 
put your ear to the ground, you can hear the voices of men 
and the sound of horses’ hoofs much farther than when stand- 
ing upright. As we have compared sight with touch, let us 
also compare it with hearing, and consider which of the two 
impressions, leaving the same body at the same time, soonest
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE VOICE. 109 
reaches its organ. When we see the flash of a cannon there 
is still time to avoid the shot; but as soon as we hear the 
sound there is not time; the ball has struck. We can esti- 
mate the distance of thunder by the interval between the 
flash and the thunderbolt. Make the child understand such 
experiments ; try those that are within his own power, and 
discover others by inference./ But it would be better he 
should know nothing about these things than that you should 
tell him all he is to know about them. 
We have an organ that corresponds to that of hearing, that 
is, the voice. Sight has nothing like this, for though we can 
produce sounds, we cannot give off colors. We have there- 
fore fuller means of cultivating hearing, by exercising its 
active and passive organs upon one another. 
The Voice. 
Maw has three kinds of voice: .the-speaking or articulate 
voice; the singing or melodious voice, and the pathetic or 
accented voice, which gives language to passion and animates 
song and speech. A child has these three kinds of voice as 
well as a man, but he does not know how to blend them in 
the same way. Like his elders he can laugh, cry, complain, 
exclaim, and groan. But he does not know how to blend 
these inflections with the two other voices. Perfect music 
best accomplishes this blending ; but children are incapable of 
such music, and there is never much feeling in their singing. 
In speaking, their voice has little energy, and little or no accent. 
Our pupil will have even a simpler and more uniform mode 
of speaking, because his passions, not yet aroused, will not 
mingle their language with his. Do not, therefore, give him 
dramatic parts to recite, nor teach him to declaim. He will 
have too much sense to emphasize words he cannot under 
stand, and to express feelings he has never known.
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
Teach him to speak evenly, clearly, articulately, to pro- 
nounce correctly and without affectation, to understand and 
use the accent demanded by.grammar and prosody. Train 
him to avoid a common fault acquired in colleges, of speak- 
ing louder than is necessary; have him speak loud enough 
to be understood ; let there be no exaggeration in anything. 
Aim, also, to render his voice in singing, even, flexible, and 
sonorous. Let his ear be sensitive to time and harmony, but 
to nothing more. Do not expect of him, at his age, imitative 
and theatrical music. It would be better if he did not even 
sing words. If he wished to sing them, I should try to 
invent songs especially for him, such as would interest him, 
as simple as his own ideas. 
The Sense of Taste. 
Or our different sensations, those of taste generally affect 
us most. We are more interested in judging correctly of 
substances that are to form part of our own bodies than of 
those which merely surround us. We are indifferent to a 
thousand things, as objects of touch, of hearing, or of sight; 
but there is almost nothing to which our sense of taste is 
indifferent. Besides, the action of this sense is entirely 
physical and material. Imagination and imitation often give 
a tinge of moral character to the impressions of all the other 
senses ; but to this it appeals least of all, if at all. Gener- 
ally, also, persons of passionate and really sensitive temper- 
ament, easily moved by the other senses, are rather indiffer- 
ent in regard to this. This very fact, which seems in some 
measure to degrade the sense of taste, and to make excess 
in its indulgence more contemptible, leads me, however, to 
conclude that the surest way to influence children is by 
means of their appetite. Gluttony, as a motive, is far better 
'

THE SENSE OF TASTE. 111 
than vanity; for gluttony is a natural appetite depending ~ 
directly on the senses, and vanity is the result of opinion, 
is subject to human caprice and to abuse of all kinds. 
Gluttony is the passion of childhood, and cannot hold 
its own against any other; it disappears on the sight 
occasion. 
Believe me, the child will only too soon leave off thinking * 
of his appetite; for when his heart is occupied, his palate 
will give him little concern. When he is a man, a thousand 
impulsive feelings will divert his mind from gluttony to 
vanity; for this last passion alone takes advantage of all 
others, and ends by absorbing them all. I have sometimes 
watched closely those who are especially fond of dainties ; 
who, as soon as they awoke, were thinking of what they 
should eat during the day, and could describe a dinner with f 
more minuteness than Polybius uses in describing a battle ; ae 
and I have always found that these supposed men were ( 
nothing but children forty years old, without any force or \ 
steadiness of character. Gluttony is the vice of men who | 
have no stamina. The soul of a gourmand has itsseatin | 
his palate alone; formed only for eating, stupid, incapable, 
he is in his true place only at the table; his judgment is 
worthless except in the matter of dishes. As he values 
these far more highly than others in which we are interested, 
as well as he, let us without regret leave this business of the 
palate to him. 
It is weak precaution to fear that gluttony may take root 
in a child capable of anything else. As children, we think 
only of eating ; but in youth, we think of it no more. Every- 
thing tastes good to us, and we have many other things to 
occupy us. 
Yet I would not use so low a motive injudiciously, or 
reward a good action with a sugar-plum. Since childhood is

or should be altogether made up of play and frolic, I see 
no reason why exercise purely physical should not have a 
material and tangible reward. If a young Majorcan, seeing 
a basket in the top of a tree, brings it down with a stone 
from his sling, why should he not have the recompense of a 
: good breakfast, to repair the strength used in earning it? 
A young Spartan, braving the risk of a hundred lashes, 
| stole into a kitchen, and carried off a live fox-cub, which 
concealed under his coat, scratched and bit him till the blood 
came. To avoid the disgrace of detection, the child allowed 
the creature to gnaw his entrails, and did not lift an eyelash 
or utter a cry.! Was it not just that, as a reward, he was 
allowed to devour the beast that had done its best to devour 
him? 
/ A good meal ought never to be given as a reward; but 
/ why should it not sometimes be the result of the pains taken 
' to secure it? Emile will not consider the cake I put upon a 
stone as a reward for running well; he only knows that he 
cannot have the cake unless he reaches it before some other 
person does. 
This does not contradict the principle before laid down as 
to simplicity in diet, For to please a child’s appetite we 
need not arouse it,/but merely satisfy it; and this may be 
done with the most ordinary things in the world, if we do 
not take pains to refine his taste/ His continual appetite, 
arising from his rapid growth, is an unfailing sauce, which 
supplies the place of many others. With a little fruit, or 
some of the dainties made from milk, ora bit of pastry rather 
more of a rarity than the every-day bread, and, more than all, 
with some tact in bestowing, you may lead an army of children 
to the world’s end without giving them any taste for highly - 
spiced food, or running any risk of cloying their palate.

  / Besides, whatever kind of diet you give children, provided 
‘they are used only to simple and common articles of food, 
let them eat, run, and play as much as they please, and you 
may rest assured they will never eat too much, or be trou- 
bled with indigestion,” But if you starve them half the time, 
and they can find a way to escape your vigilance, they will 
injure themselves with all their might, and eat until they are 
entirely surfeited(’ 
Unless we dictate to our appetite other rules than those of 
nature, it will never be inordinate. Always regulating, pre- 
scribing, adding, retrenching, we do everything with scales 
in hand. But the scales measure our own whims, and not 
our digestive organs. 
To return to my illustrations ; fo among country folk the 
larder and the orchard are always open, and nobody, young 
or old, knows what indigestion means. / 
Result. The Pupil at the Age of Ten or Twelve. 
Supposine that my method is indeed that of nature itself, 
and that I have made no mistakes in applying it, I have now 
conducted my pupil through the region of sensations to the 
boundaries of childish reason. The first step beyond should 
be that of aman. But before beginning this new career, let 
us for a moment cast our eyes over what we have just tray- 
ersed. Every age and station in life has a perfection, a 
maturity, all its own. We often hear of a full-grown man ; 
in contemplating a full-grown child we shall find more noy- 
elty, and perhaps no less pleasure. 
The existence of finite beings is so barren and so limited 
that when we see only what is, it never stirs us to emotion. 
Real objects are adorned by the creations of fancy, and 
without this charm yield us but a barren satisfaction, ex-
-P-A-G-E-114
114 CONCERNING EDUCATION, 
  tending no farther than to the organ that perceives them, 
and the heart is left cold. The earth, clad in the glories of 
autumn, displays a wealth which the wondering eye enjoys, 
but which arouses no feeling within us; it springs less from 
sentiment than from reflection. In spring the landscape is 
still almost bare; the forests yield no shade; the verdure is 
only beginning to bud; and yet the heart is deeply moved 
at the sight. We feel within us a new life, when we see 
nature thus revive; delightful images surround us; the 
companions of pleasure, gentle tears, ever ready to spring at 
the touch of tender feelings, brim our eyes. But upon the 
panorama of the vintage season, animated and pleasant 
though it be, we have no tears to bestow. Why is there this 
difference? It is because imagination joins to the sight of 
spring-time that of following seasons. To the tender buds 
the eye adds the fiowers, the fruit, the shade, sometimes 
also the mysteries that may lie hidin them. Into a single 
point of time our fancy gathers all the year’s seasons yet to 
be, and sees things less as they really will be than as it 
would choose to have them. In autumn, on the contrary, 
there is nothing but bare reality. If we think of spring 
then, the thought of winter checks us, and beneath snow 
and hoar-frost the chilled imagination dies. 
The charm we feel in looking upon a lovely childhood 
rather than upon the perfection of mature age, arises from 
the same source. If the sight of a man in his prime gives 
us like pleasure, it is when the memory of what he has done 
leads us to review his past life and bring up his younger 
days. If we think of him as he is, or as he will be in old 
age, the idea of declining nature destroys all our pleasure. 
There can be none in seeing a man rapidly drawing near 
the grave; the image of death is a blight upon everything. 
But when I imagine a child of ten or twelve, sound,
-P-A-G-E-115
RESULT. 115 
vigorous, well developed for his age, it gives me pleasure, 
whether on account of the present or of the future. I see 
him impetuous, sprightly, animated, free from anxiety or 
corroding care, living wholly in his own present, and enjoying 
a life full to overflowing. I foresee what he will be in later 
years, using the senses, the intellect, the bodily vigor, every 
day unfolding within him. When I think of him as a child, 
he delights me; when I think of him as a man, he delights 
me still more. His glowing pulses seem to warm my own; 
I feel his life within myself, and his sprightliness renews my 
youth. His form, his bearing, his countenance, manifest 
self-confidence and happiness. Health glows in his face; 
his firm step is a sign of bodily vigor. His complexion, 
still delicate, but not insipid, has in it no effeminate softness, 
for air and sun have already given him the honorable stamp 
of his sex. His still rounded muscles are beginning to show 
signs of growing expressiveness. His eyes, not yet lighted 
with the fire of feeling, have all their natural serenity. 
Years of sorrow have never made them dim, nor have his 
cheeks been furrowed by unceasing tears. His quick but 
decided movements show the sprightliness of his age, and 
his sturdy independence ; they bear testimony to the abund- 
ant physical exercise he has enjoyed. His bearing is frank 
and open, but not insolent or vain. His face, never glued to 
his books, is never downcast; you need not tell him to raise 
his head, for neither fear nor shame has ever made it droop. - 
Make room for him among you, and examine him, gentle- 
men. Question him with all confidence, without fear of his 
troubling you with idle chatter or impertinent queries. Do 
not be afraid of his taking up all your time, or making it 
impossible for you to get rid of him. You need not expect 
brilliant speeches that I have taught him, but only the frank 
and simple truth without preparation, ornament, or vanity.

When he tells you what he has been thinking or doing, he 
will speak of the evil as freely as of the good, not in the 
least embarrassed by its effect upon those who hear him. 
He will use words in all the simplicity of their original 
meaning. 
We like to prophesy good of children, and are always 
sorry when a stream of nonsense comes to disappoint hopes 
aroused by some chance repartee. My pupil seldom awakens 
such hopes, and will never cause such regrets: for he never 
utters an unnecessary word, or wastes breath in babble to 
which he knows nobody will listen. If his ideas have a 
limited range, they are nevertheless clear. If he knows 
nothing by heart, he knows a great deal from experience. 
If he does not read ordinary books so well as other children, 
he reads the book of nature far better. His mind is in his 
brain, and not at his tongue’s end. He has less memory 
than judgment. He can speak only one language, but he 
understands what he says: and if he does not say it as well 
as another, he can do things far better than they can. 
He does not know the meaning of custom or routine. 
What he did yesterday does not in any wise affect his 
actions of to-day. He never follows a rigid formula, or 
gives way in the least to authority or to example. Every- 
thing he does and says is after the natural fashion of his 
age. Expect of him, therefore, no formal speeches or 
studied manners, but always the faithful expression of his 
own ideas, and a conduct arising from his own inclinations. 
You will find he has a few moral ideas in relation to his 
own concerns, but in regard to men in general, none at all. 
Of what use would these last be to him, since a child is not 
yet an active member of society? Speak to him of liberty, 
of property, even of things done by common consent, and he 
may understand you. He knows why his own things belong

to him and those of another person do not, and beyond this 
he knows nothing. Speak to him of duty and obedience, 
and he will not know what you mean. Command him to do 
a thing, and he will not understand you. But tellhim-that —~ 
if he will do you such and such a favor, you will do the same 
for him whenever you can, and_he will readily oblige you; 
for he likes nothing better than to increase his power, and to 
lay you under obligations he knows to be inviolable. Per- 
haps, too, he enjoys being recognized as somebody and 
accounted worth something. But if this last be his motive, 
he has already left the path of nature, and you have not 
effectually closed the approaches to vanity. 
If he needs help, he will ask it of the very first person he 
meets, be he monarch or man-servant; to him one man is as 
good as another. 
By his manner of asking, you can see that he feels you do 
not owe him anything ; he knows that what he asks is really 
a favor to him, which humanity will induce you to grant. 
His expressions are simple and laconic. His voice, his look, 
his gesture, are those of one equally accustomed to consent 
or to refusal. They show neither the cringing submission of 
a slave, nor the imperious tone of a master; but modest con- 
fidence in his fellow-creatures, and the noble and touching 
gentleness of one who is free, but sensitive and feeble, ask- 
ing aid of another, also free, but powerful andkind. If you 
do what he asks, he does not thank you, but feels that he 
has laid himself under obligation. If you refuse, he will not 
complain or insist; he knows it would be of no use. He will 
not say, ‘‘I was refused,” but ‘‘It was impossible.” And, 
as has been already said, we do not often rebel against an 
acknowledged necessity.

word, watch what he does, and how he does it. Knowing

perfectly well that he is free, he will do nothing from mere 
thoughtlessness, or just to show that he can doyit; for is he 
not aware that he is always his own master? He is alert, 
nimble, and active; his movements have all the agility of his 
years; but you will not see one that has not some definite 
aim. o matter what he may wish to do, he will never un- 
ertake what he cannot do, for he has tested his own strength, 
and knows exactly what itis. The means he uses are always 
adapted to the end sought, and he rarely does anything with- 
out being assured he will succeed in it. His eye will be 
attentive and critical, and he will not ask foolish questions 
_sbout everything he sees. Before making any inquiries he

this age, with his bright expression of serene content, and 
laughing, open countenance, playing at the most serious 
things, or deeply occupied with the most frivolous amuse- 
ments? He has reached the maturity of childhood, has lived 
a child’s life, not gaining perfection at the cost of his happi-

robbed him of nothing that nature gave him.” 
In regard to this early education, the chief difficulty is, 
that only far-seeing men can understand it, and that a child 
so carefully educated seems to an ordinary observer only a 
young scapegrace. 
A tutor usually considers his own interests rather than ° 
hose of his pupil. He devotes himself to proving that he 
loses no time and earns his salary. He teaches the child 
fp such accomplishments as can be readily exhibited when re- 
quired, without regard to their usefulness or worthlessness, 
so long as they are showy. Without selecting or discerning, 
he charges the child’s memory with a vast amount of rubbish. 
, When the child is to be examined, the tutor makes him dis- 
\ play his wares; and, after thus giving satisfaction, folds up 
his pack again, and goes his way. 
“My pupil is not so rich; he has no pack at all to display ; 
he has nothing but himself. Now a child, like a man, can- 
not be seen all at once. What observer can at the first 
glance seize upon the child’s peculiar traits? Such observers 
there are, but they are uncommon; and among a hundred 
thousand fathers you will not find one such.

Tux third book has to do with the youth as he is between the 
ages of twelye and fifteen. At this time his strength is proportion- 
ately greatest, and this is the most important period in his life. It 
is the time for labor and study; not indeed for studies of all kinds, 
but for those whose necessity the student himself teas Te prin- 
ciple that ought to guide him now is that of utility. All the master’s 
talent consists in leading him to discover what is really useful to 
him. Language and history offer him little that is interesting. He 
applies himself to studying natural phenomena, because they arouse 
his curiosity and afford him means of overcoming his difficulties. 
He makes his own instruments, and invents what apparatus he 
needs. 
He does not depend upon another to direct him, but follows 
where his own good sense points the way. Robinson Crusoe on 
his island is his ideal, and this book furnishes the reading best 
suited to his age. He should have some manual occupation, as 
much on account of the uncertain future as for the sake of satisfy- 
ing his own constant activity. 
Side by side with the body the mind is developed by a taste for 
reflection, and is finally prepared for studies of a higher order. 
With this period childhood ends and youth begins. 
The Age of Study. 
LTHOUGH up to the beginning of youth life is, on the 
whole, a period of weakness, there is a time during this 
earlier age when our strength increases beyond what our wants 
require, and the growing animal, still absolutely weak, becomes 
relatively strong. His wants being as yet partly undeveloped, 
his present strength is more than sufficient to provide for those
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
of the present. As a man, he would be very weak; as a 
child, he is very strong. 
Whence arises this weakness of ours but from the inequal- 
ity between our desires and the strength we have for fulfill. 
ing them? Our passions weaken us, because the gratification 
of them requires more than our natural strength. 
If we have fewer desires, we are so much the stronger, 
Whoever can do more than his wishes demand has strength 
to spare; he is strong indeed. Of this, the third stage or 
childhood, I have now to speak. I still call it childhood for 
want of a better term to express the idea; for this age, not 
that of puberty, approaches youth. 
At the age of twelve or thirteen the child’s physical strength 
{develops much faster than his wants. He braves without 
‘inconvenience the inclemency of climate and seasons, scarcely 
feeling it at all’ Natural heat serves him instead of clothing, 
appetite instead of saucef When he is drowsy, he lies down 
on the ground and falls asleep. Thus he finds around him 
pagrrsne he needs; not governed by caprices, his desires 
extend no farther than his own arms can reach. Not only is 
fhe sufficient for himself, but, at this one time in all his life, 
SQhe has more strength than he really requires. 
What then shall he do with this superabundance of mental 
and physical strength, which he will hereafter need, but 
endeavor to employ it in ways which will at some time be of 
use to him, and thus throw this surplus vitality forward into 
he robust child shall make provision for his 
weaker manhood. But he will not garner it in barns, or lay 
it up in coffers that can be plundered. To be real owner of 
this treasure, he must store it up in his arms, in his brain, in 
himself. The present, then, is the time to labor, to receive 
instruction, and to study; nature so ordains, not I. 
Human intelligence has its limits. We can neither know 
      
  7 
   
-P-A-G-E-123
THE AGE OF STUDY. 123 
everything, nor be thoroughly acquainted with the little that 
other men know. Since the reverse of every false proposi- 
tion is a truth, the number of truths, like the number of 
errors, is inexhaustible. We have to select what is to be 
taught as well as the time for learning it. Of the kinds of 
knowledge within our power some are false, some useless, 
some serve only to foster pride. Only the few that really 
conduce to our well-being are worthy of study by a wise man, 
or by a youth intended to be a wise man. The question is, 
not what may be known, but what will be of the most use 
when it is known. From these few we must again deduct 
such as require a ripeness of understanding and a knowledge 
of human relations which a child cannot possibly acquire ; 
such as, though true in themselves, incline an inexperienced 
mind to judge wrongly of other things. 
This reduces us to a circle smal! indeed in relation to 
existing things, but immense when we consider the capacity 
of the child’s mind. How daring was the hand that first ven- 
tured to lift the veil of darkness from our human understand- 
ing! What abysses, due to our unwise learning, yawn around 
the unfortunate youth! Tremble, you who are to conduct 
him by these perilous ways, and to lift for him the sacred 
veil of nature. Be sure of your own brain and of his, lest 
either, or perhaps both, grow dizzy at the sight. Beware of 
the glamour of falsehood and of the intoxicating fumes of 
pride. Always bear in mind that ignorance has never been 
harmful, that error alone is fatal, and that our errors arise, 
not from what we do not know, but from what we think we 
do know. : 
1 This might be carried too far, and is to be admitted with some reser- 
vations. Ignorance is never alone ; its companions are always error and 
presumption. No one is so certain that he knows, as he who knows 
nothing ; and prejudice of all kinds is the form in which our ignorance 
{s clothed.

The Incentive of Curiosity. 
The same instinct animates all the different faculties of 
man. To the activity of the body, striving to develop itself, 
succeeds the activity of the mind, endeavoring to instruct 
itself. Children are at first only restless; afterwards they 
are inquisitive. Their curiosity, rightly trained, is the in- 
centive of the age we are now considering. We must always 
distinguish natural inclinations from those that have their 
source in opinion. 
There is a thirst for knowledge which is founded only 
upon a desire to be thought learned, and another, springing 
from our natural curiosity concerning anything which nearly 
or remotely interests us. Our desire for happiness is inborn ; 
as it can never be fully satisfied, we are always seeking 
ways to increase what we have. This first principle of 
curiosity is natural to the heart of man, but is developed 
only in proportion to our passions and to our advance in 
knowledge Call your pupil’s attention to the phenomena of 
  ‘Ss nature, and you will soon render him inquisitive., But if 
you would keep this curiosity alive, do not be in/haste to 
satisfy it. Ask him questions that he can comprehend, and 
let him solve them. Let him know a thing because he has 
found it out for himself, and not because you have told him 
of it. Let him not learn science, but discover it for himself. 
If once you substitute authority for reason, he will not 
reason any more ; he will only be the sport of other people’s 
opinions. 
When you are ready to teach this child geography, you 
get together your globes and your maps; and what machines 
they are! Why, instead of using all these representations, 
do you not begin by showing him the object itself, so as ta 
let him know what you are talking of?

THE INCENTIVE OF CURIOSITY. 125 
On some beautiful evening take the child to walk with you, 
in a place suitable for your purpose, where in the unob- 
structed horizon the setting sun can be plainly seen. Take 
a careful observation of all the objects marking the spot at 
which it goes down. When you go for an airing next day, 
return to this same place before the sun rises. You can see 
it announce itself by arrows of fire. The brightness in- 
creases; the east seems all aflame; from its glow you’ 
anticipate long beforehand the coming of day. Every 
moment you imagine you see it. At last it really does 
appear, a brilliant point which rises like a flash of lightning, 
and instantly fills all space. The veil of shadows is cast 
down and disappears. We know our dwelling-place once 
more, and find it more beautiful than ever. The verdure 
has taken on fresh vigor during the night; it is revealed 
with its brilliant net-work of dew-drops, reflecting light and 
color to the eye, in the first golden rays of the new-born 
day. The full choir of birds, none silent, salute in concert 
the Father of life. Their warbling, still faint with the 
languor of a peaceful awakening, is now more lingering and 
sweet than at other hours of the day. All this fills the 
senses with a charm and freshness which seems to touch our 
inmost soul. No one can resist this enchanting hour, or 
behold with indifference a spectacle so grand, so beautiful, 
so full of all delight. 
Carried away by such a sight, the teacher is eager to 
impart to the child his own enthusiasm, and thinks to arouse 
it by calling attention to what he himself feels. What folly! 
The drama of nature lives only in the heart; to see it, one 
must feel it. The child sees the objects, but not the rela- 
tions that bind them together; he can make nothing of their 
harmony. The complex and momentary impression of all 
these sensations requires an experience he has never gained,
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
and feelings he has never known. If he has never crossed 
the desert and felt its burning sands scorch his feet, the 
stifling reflection of the sun from its rocks oppress him, how 
ean he fully enjoy the coolness of a beautiful morning? 
How can the perfume of flowers, the cooling vapor of the 
dew, the sinking of his footstep in the soft and pleasant turf, 
enchant his senses? How can the singing of birds delight 
him, while the accents of love and pleasure are yet unknown? 
How can he see with transport the rise of so beautiful a day, 
unless imagination can paint all the transports with which it 
may be filled? And lastly, how can he be moved by the 
beautiful panorama of nature, if he does not know by whose 
tender care it has been adorned? 
Do not talk to the child about things he cannot under- 
stand. Let him hear from you no descriptions, no elo- 
quence, no figurative language, no poetry. Sentiment and 
taste are just now out of the question. Continue to be 
clear, unaffected, and dispassionate; the time for using 
another language will come only too soon. 
Educated in the spirit of our principles, accustomed to 
look for resources within himself, and to have recourse to 
others only when he finds himself really helpless, he will 
examine every new object for a long time without saying a 
word. He is thoughtful, and not disposed to ask questions. 
Be satisfied, therefore, with presenting objects at appropriate 
times and in appropriate ways. When you see his curiosity 
fairly at work, ask him some laconic question which will 
suggest its own answer. if

How can that be so?” Say no more; if he asks questions, 
do not answer them: speak of something else. Leave him A

deeply with any truth affecting the senses, let him<pass_sey# 
_eral restless days before he discovers that truth. If the one Z 
‘in question does not thus impress him, you may make him 
see it more clearly by reversing the problem. If he does not 
know how the sun passes from its setting to its rising, he at 
least does know how it travels from its rising to its setting ; 
his eyes alone teach him this. Explain your first question 
by the second. If your pupil be not absolutely stupid, the 
analogy is so plain that he cannot escape it. This is his 
first lesson in cosmography. 
As we pass slowly from one sensible idea to another, 
familiarize ourselves for a long time with each before con- 
sidering the next, and do not force our pupil’s attention ; 
it will be a long way from this point to a knowledge of the 
sun’s course and of the shape of the earth. But as all the 
apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are upon the same 
principle, and the first observation prepares the way for all 
the rest, less effort, if more time, is required to pass from 
the daily rotation of the earth to the calculation of eclipses 
than to understand clearly the phenomena of day and night. 
Since the sun (apparently) revolves about the earth, it 
describes a circle, and we already know that every circle 
must have a centre. This centre, being in the heart of the 
earth, cannot be seen; but we may mark upon the surface 
two opposite points that correspond to it. A rod passing 
through these three points, and extending from one side of 
the heavens to the other, shall be the axis of the earth, and 
of the sun’s apparent daily motion. A spherical top, turning
-P-A-G-E-128
    128 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
on its point, shall represent the heavens revolving on then 
axis; the two extremities of the top are the two poles. The 
child will be interested in knowing one of them, which I will 
show him near the tail of Ursa Minor. 
This will serve to amuse us for one night. By degrees we 
shall grow familiar with the stars, and this will awaken a 
desire to know the planets and to watch the constellations. 
We have seen the sun rise at midsummer; we will also 
watch its rising at Christmas or some other fine day in 
winter. For be it known that we are not at all idle, and 
that we make a joke of braving the cold. I take care to 
make this second observation in the same place as the first: 
and after some conversation to pave the way for it. One or 
the other of us will be sure to exclaim, ‘‘ How queer that is! 
the sun does not rise where it used to rise! Here are our 
old landmarks, and now it is rising over yonder. Then there 
must be one east for summer, and another for winter.” 
Now, young teacher, your way is plain. These examples 
ought to suffice you for teaching the sphere very understand- 
ingly, by taking the world for your globe, and the real sun 
instead of your artificial sun. 
Things Rather than their Signs. 
In general, never show the representation of a thing unless 
it be impossible to show the thing itself; for the sign ab- 
sorbs the child’s attention, and makes him lose sight of the 
thing signified. 
The armillary sphere? seems to me poorly designed and in 
bad proportion. Its confused circles and odd figures, giving 
1The armillary sphere is a group of pasteboard or copper circles, to 
illustrate the orbits of the planets, and their position in relation to the 
earth, which is represented by a small wooden ball.

THINGS RATHER THAN THEIR SIGNS. 129 
it the look of a conjurer’s apparatus, are enough to frighten 
a child. The earth is too small; the circles are too many 
and too large. Some of them, the colures,! for instance, are 
entirely useless. Every circle is larger than the earth. The 
pasteboard gives them an appearance of solidity which 
creates the mistaken impression that they are circular masses 
which really exist. When you tell the child that these are 
imaginary circles, he understands neither what he sees nor 
what you mean. 
Shall we never learn to put ourselves in the child’s place? 
We do not enter into his thoughts, but suppose them exactly 
like our own. Constantly following our own method of 
reasoning, we cram his mind not only with a concatenation 
of truths, but also with extravagant notions and errors. 
In the study of the sciences it is an open question whether 
we ought to use synthesis or analysis. It is not always nec- 
essary to choose either. In the same process of investigation 
we can sometimes both resolve and compound, and while the 
child thinks he is only analyzing, we can direct him by the 
methods teachers usually employ. By thus using both we 
make each prove the other. Starting at the same moment 
from two opposite points and never imagining that one road 
connects them, he will be agreeably surprised to find that 
what he supposed to be two paths finally meet as one. 
I would, for example, take geography at these two ex-/ 
tremes, and add to the study of the earth’s motions the 
measurement of its parts, beginning with our own dwelling- 
place. While the child, studying the sphere, is transported 
into the heavens, bring him back to the measurement of the, 
earth, and first show him his own home. 
The two starting-points in his geography shall be the town ~

armillary sphere by metallic circles, are called colures.

in which he lives, and his father’s house in the country. 
Afterward shall come the places lying between these two; 
then the neighboring rivers ; lastly, the aspect of the sun, and 
the manner of finding out where the east is. This last is the 
point of union. Let him make himself a map of all these 
details; a very simple map, including at first only two 
objects, then by degrees the others, as he learns their dis- 
tance and position. You see now what an advantage we 
have gained beforehand, by making his eyes serve him 
instead of a compass. 
Even with this it may be necessary to direct him a little. 
but very little, and without appearing to do so at all. When 
he makes mistakes, let him make them; do not correct them. 
Wait in silence until he can see and correct them himself. 
Or, at most, take a good opportunity to set in motion some- 
thing which will direct his attention to them. If he were 
sever to make mistakes, he could not learn half so well. 
Besides, the important thing is, not that he should know the 
exact topography of the country, but that he should learn 
how to find it out by himself. It matters little whether he 
has maps in his mind or not, so that he understands what 
they represent, and has a clear idea of how they are made. 
Mark the difference between the learning of your pupils 
and the ignorance of mine. They know all about maps, and 
he can make them. Our maps will serve as new decora- 
tions for our room.

him from errors he might learn, I furnish his mind with 
truths only. Reason and judgment enter slowly ; prejudices 
crowd in; and he must be preserved from these last. Yet if 
you consider science in itself, you launch upon an unfathom- 
able and boundless sea, full of unavoidable dangers. When 
I see a man carried away by his love for knowledge, hasten- 
ing from one alluring science to another, without knowing * 
where to stop, I think I see a child gathering shells upon 
the seashore. At first he loads himself with them; then, 
tempted by others, he throws these away, and gathers more. 
At last, weighed down by so many, and no longer knowing 
which to choose, he ends by throwing all away, and return- 
ing empty-handed. 
In our early years time passed slowly; we endeavored to 
lose it, for fear of misusing it. The case is reversed; now 
we have not time enough for doing all that we find useful. 
Bear in mind that the passions are drawing nearer, and that 
as soon as they knock at the door, your pupil will have eyes 
and ears for them alone. The tranquil period of intelli- 
gence is so brief, and has so many other necessary uses, that / only folly imagines it long enough to make the child a

but to give Him a love for it, and a good method of acquiring ~ xf 
it when this love has grown stronger. Certainly this is a_ ‘ 
fundamental principle in all good education. — 
Now, also, is the time to accustom him gradually to con- 
centrate attention on a single object. This attention, how- 
ever, should never result from constraint, but from desire 
and pleasure. Be careful that it shall not grow irksome, or 
approach the point of weariness. Leave any subject just 
before he grows tired of it; for the learning it matters less 
to him than the never being obliged to learn anything / 
against his will. If he himself questions you, answer so as<=

to keep alive his curiosity, not to satisfy it altogether, 
Above all, when you find that he makes inquiries, not for the 
sake of learning something, but to talk at randon and annoy 
you with silly questions, pause at once, assured that he cares 
nothing about the matter, but only to occupy your time with 
himself. Less regard should be paid to what he says than 
to the motive which leads him to speak. This caution, here- 
tofore unnecessary, is of the utmost importance as soon as 
a child begins to reason. 
There is a chain of general truths by which all sciences 
are linked to common principles and successively unfolded. 
This chain is the method of philosophers, with which, for 
the present, we have nothing to do. There is another, 
altogether different, which shows each object as the cause of 
another, and always points out the one following. This 
order, which, by a perpetual curiosity, keeps alive the atten- 
tion demanded by all, is the one followed by most men, and 
of all others necessary with children. When, in making our 
maps, we found out the place of the east, we were obliged 
to draw meridians. The two points of intersection be- 
tween the equal shadows of night and morning furnish an 
excellent meridian for an astronomer thirteen years old. 
But these meridians disappear ; it takes time to draw them ; 
they oblige us to work always in the same place’ so much 
care, so much annoyance, will tire him out at last. We 
have seen and provided for this beforehand. 
I have again begun upon tedious and minute details. 
Readers, I hear your murmurs, and disregard them. I will 
not sacrifice to your impatience the most useful part of this 
book. Do what you please with my tediousness, as I have 
done as I pleased in regard to your complaints.

THE JUGGLER. 133 
The Juggler. 
For some time my pupil and I had observed that different 
bodies, such as amber, glass, and wax, when rubbed, attract 
straws, and that others do not attract them. By accident we 
discovered one that has a virtue more extraordinary still, — 
that of attracting at a distance, and without being rubbed, 
iron filings and other bits of iron. This peculiarity amused 
us for some time before we saw any use in it. At last we 
found out that it may be communicated to iron itself, when 
magnetized to a certain degree. One day we went to a fair, 
where a juggler, with a piece of bread, attracted a duck 
made of wax, and floating on a bowl of water. Much sur- 
prised, we did not however say, ‘‘ He is a conjurer,” for we 
knew nothing about conjurers. Continually struck by effects 
whose causes we do not know, we were not in haste to 
decide the matter, and remained in ignorance until we found 
a way out of it. 
When we reached home we had talked so much of the 
duck at the fair that we thought we would endeavor to copy 
it. Taking a perfect needle, well magnetized, we inclosed 
it in white wax, modelled as well as we could do it into the 
shape of a duck, so that the needle passed entirely through 
the body, and with its larger end formed the duck’s bill. 
We placed the duck upon the water, applied to the beak 
the handle of a key, and saw, with a delight easy to imagine, 
that our duck would follow the key precisely as the one at 
the fair had followed the piece of bread. We saw that 
some time or other we might observe the direction in which the 
duck turned when left to itself upon the water. But absorbed 
at that time by another object, we wanted nothing more. 
That evening, having in our pockets bread prepared for 
the occasion, we returned to the fair. As soon as the mounte-
-P-A-G-E-134
  134 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
bank had performed his feat, my little philosopher, scarcely 
able to contain himself, told him that the thing was not hard 
to do, and that he could do it himself. He was taken at his 
word. Instantly he took from his pocket the bread in which 
he had hidden the bit of iron. Approaching the table his 
heart beat fast ; almost tremblingly, he presented the bread. 
The duck came toward it and followed it; the child shouted 
and danced for joy. At the clapping of hands, and the 
acclamations of all present, his head swam, and he was almost 
beside himself. The juggler was astonished, but embraced 
and congratulated him, begging that we would honor him 
again by our presence on the following day, adding that he 
would take care to have a larger company present to applaud 
our skill. My little naturalist, filled with pride, began to 
prattle ; but I silenced him, and led him away loaded with 
praises. The child counted the minutes until the morrow 
with impatience that made me smile. He invited everybody 
he met; gladly would he have had all mankind as witnesses 
of his triumph. He could scarcely wait for the hour agreed 
upon, and, long before it came, flew to the place appointed. 
The hall was already full, and on entering, his little heart 
beat fast. Other feats were to come first; the juggler outdid 
himself, and there were some really wonderful perform- 
ances. The child paid no attention to these. His excite- 
ment had thrown him into a perspiration; he was almost 
breathless, and fingered the bread in his pocket with a hand 
trembling with impatience. 
At last his turn came, and the master pompously announced 
the fact. Rather bashfully the boy drew near and held forth 
his bread. Alas for the changes in human affairs! The 
fluck, yesterday so tame, had grown wild. Instead of pre- 
senting its bill, it turned about and swam away, avoiding the 
bread and the hand which presented it, as carefully as it had
-P-A-G-E-135
THE JUGGLER. 185 
before followed them. After many fruitless attempts, each 
received with derision, the child complained that a trick was 
played on him, and defied the juggler to attract the duck. 
The man, without a word, took a piece of bread and pre- 
sented it to the duck, which instantly followed it, and came 
towards his hand. The child took the same bit of bread; 
but far from having better success, he saw the duck make 
sport of him by whirling round and round as it swam about 
the edge of the basin. At last he retired in great confusion, 
no longer daring to encounter the hisses which followed. 
Then the juggler took the bit of bread the child had 
brought, and succeeded as well with it as with his own. In 
the presence of the entire company he drew out the needle, 
making another joke at our expense ; then, with the bread 
thus disarmed, he attracted the duck as before. He did the 
same thing with a piece of bread which a third person cut off 
in the presence of all; again, with his glove, and with the 
tip of his finger. At last, going to the middle of the room, 
he declared in the emphatic tone peculiar to his sort, that the 
duck would obey his voice quite as well as his gesture. He 
spoke, and the duck obeyed him; commanded it to go to the 
right, and it went to the right; to return, and it did so; to 
turn, and it turned itself about. Each movement was as 
prompt as the command. The redoubled applause was a re- 
peated affront to us. We stole away unmolested, and shut 
ourselves up in our room, without proclaiming our success 
far and wide as we had meant to do. 
There was a knock at our door next morning ; I opened it, 
and there stood the mountebank, who modestly complained of 
our conduct. What had he done to us that we should try to 
throw discredit on his performances and take away his liveli- 
hood? What is so wonderful in the art of attracting a wax 
duck, that the honor should be worth the price of an honest
-P-A-G-E-136
  186 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
man’s living? ‘Faith, gentlemen, if I had any other way 
of earning my bread, I should boast very little of this way. 
You may well believe that a man who has spent his life in 
practising this pitiful trade understands it much better than 
you, who devote only a few minutes toit. If I did not show 
you my best performances the first time, it was because a man 
ought not to be such a fool as to parade everything he knows. 
I always take care to keep my best things for a fit occasion ; 
and I have others, too, to rebuke young and thoughtless peo- 
ple. Besides, gentlemen, I am going to teach you, in the 
goodness of my heart, the secret which puzzled you so 
much, begging that you will not abuse your knowledge of 
it to injure me, and that another time you will use more 
discretion.” 
Then he showed us his apparatus, and we saw, to our sur- 
prise, that it consisted only of a powerful magnet moved by 
a child concealed beneath the table. The man put up his 
machine again; and after thanking him and making due 
apologies, we offered him a present. He refused, saying, 
‘*No, gentlemen, I am not so well pleased with you as to 
accept presents from you. You cannot help being under 
an obligation to me, and that is revenge enough. But, you 
see, generosity is to be found in every station in life; I take 
pay for my performances, not for my lessons.” 
As he was going out, he reprimanded me pointedly and 
aloud. ‘I willingly pardon this child,” said he; ‘‘he has 
offended only through ignorance. But you, sir, must have 
known the nature of his fault; why did you allow him to 
commit such a fault? Since you live together, you, who 
are older, ought to have taken the trouble of advising him ; 
the authority of your experience should have guided him. 
When he is old enough to reproach you for his childish errors,
-P-A-G-E-137
THE JUGGLER. 187 
he will certainly blame you for those of which you did not 
warn him.” ! 
He went away, leaving us greatly abashed. I took upon 
myself the blame of my easy compliance, and promised the 
child that, another time, I would sacrifice it to his interest, 
and warn him of his faults before they were committed. 
For a time was coming when our relations would be changed, 
and the severity of the tutor must succeed to the complai- 
sance of an equal. This change should be gradual; every- 
thing must be foreseen, and that long beforehand. 
The following day we returned to the fair, to see once 
more the trick whose secret we had learned. We approached 
our juggling Socrates with deep respect, hardly venturing to 
look at him. He overwhelmed us with civilities, and seated 
us with a marked attention which added to our humiliation. 
He performed his tricks as usual, but took pains to amuse 
himself for a long time with the duck trick, often looking at 
us with a rather defiant air. We understood it perfectly, and 
did not breathe a syllable. If my pupil had even dared to 
open his mouth, he would have deserved to be annihilated. 
All the details of this illustration are far more important 
than they appear. How many lessons are here combined in 
one! How many mortifying effects does the first feeling of 
vanity bring upon us! Young teachers, watch carefully its 
first manifestation. If you can thus turn it into humiliation 
and disgrace, be assured that a second lesson will not soon be 
necessary. 
‘¢ What an amount of preparation!” you will say. True; 
and all to make us a compass to use instead of a meridian 
line! 
1 Rousseau here informs his readers that even these reproaches are ex- 
pected, he having dictated them beforehand to the mountebank; all this 
scene has been arranged to deceive the child. What a refinement of artifice 
in this passionate lover of the natural!

Having learned that a magnet acts through other bodies, 
we were all impatience until we had made an apparatus like 
the one we had seen, —a hollow table-top with a very shallow 
basin adjusted upon it and filled with water, a duck rather 
more carefully made, and so on. Watching this apparatus 
attentively and often, we finally observed that the duck, when 
at rest, nearly always turned in the same direction. Follow- 
ing up the experiment by examining this direction, we found 
it to be from south to north. Nothing more was necessary ; 
our compass was invented, or might as well have been. We 
had begun to study physics. 
Experimental Physics. 
Tue earth has different climates, and these have different 
temperatures. As we approach the poles the variation of 
seasons is more perceptible, —all bodies contract with cold 
and expand with heat. This effect is more readily measured 
in liquids, and is particularly noticeable in spirituous liquors. 
This fact suggested the idea of the thermometer. The wind 
strikes our faces; air is therefore a body, a fluid; we feel it 
though we cannot see it. Turn a glass vessel upside down in 
water, and the water will not fill it unless you leave a vent 
for the air; therefore air is capable of resistance. Sink 
the glass lower, and the water rises in the air-filled region of 
the glass, although it does not entirely fill that space. Air 
is therefore to some extent compressible. A ball filled with 
compressed air bounds much better than when filled with 
anything else: air is therefore elastic. When lying at full 
length in the bath, raise the arm horizontally out of the 
water, and you feel it burdened by a great weight: air is there- 
fore heavy. Put air in equilibrium with other bodies, and 
you can measure its weight. From these observations were
-P-A-G-E-139
  
EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS. 189 
constructed the barometer, the siphon, the air-gun, and the 
air-pump. All the laws of statics and hydrostatics were dis- 
covered by experiments as simple as these. I would not 
have my pupil study them in a laboratory of experimental 
physics. I dislike all that array of machines and instruments. 
The parade of science is fatal to science itself. All those 
machines frighten the child; or else their singular forms 
divide and distract the attention he ought to give to their 
effects. 
Iwould make all our own machines, and not begin by mak- 
ing the instrument before the experiment has been tried. 
But after apparently lighting by chance on the experiment, 
I\should by degrees invent instruments for verifying it. 
These instruments should not be so perfect and exact as our 
ideas of what they should be and of the operations resulting 
from them. 
For the first lesson in statics, instead of using balances, I 
put a stick across the back of a chair, and when evenly bal- 
anced, measure its two portions. I add weights to each part, 
sometimes equal, sometimes unequal. Pushing it to or fro as 
may be necessary, I finally discover that equilibrium results 
from a reciprocal proportion between the amount of weight 
and the length of the levers. Thus my little student of phys- 
ics can rectify balances without having ever seen them. 
When we thus learn by ourselves instead of learning from 
others, our ideas are far more definite and clear. Besides, if 
our reason is not accustomed to slavish submission to au- 
thority, this discovering relations, linking one idea to another, 
and inventing apparatus, renders us much more ingenious. 
If, instead, we take everything just as it is given to us, we 
allow our minds to sink down into indifference ; just as a man 
who always lets his servants dress him and wait on him, and 
his horses carry him about, loses finally not only the vigor 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
140 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
but even the use of his limbs. Boileau boasted that he had 
taught Racine to rhyme with difficulty. There are many ex- 
cellent labor-saving methods for studying science ; but we are 
in sore need of one to teach us how to learn them with more 
effort of our own. 
The most manifest value of these slow and laborious re- 
searches is, that amid speculative studies they maintain the 
activity and suppleness of the body, by training the hands to 
labor, and creating habits useful to any man. So many in- 
struments are invented to aid in our experiments and to sup- 
plement the action of our senses, that we neglect to use the 
senses themselves. If the graphometer measures the size of 
an angle for us, we need not estimate it ourselves. The eye 
which measured distances with precision intrusts this work to 
the chain; the steelyard saves me the trouble of measuring 
weights by the hand. The more ingenious our apparatus, the 
more clumsy and awkward do our organs become. If we 
surround ourselves with instruments, we shall no longer find 
them within ourselves. 
But when, in making the apparatus, we employ the skill 
and sagacity required in doing without them, we do not lose, 
but gain. By adding art to nature, we become more in- 
genious and no less skilful. If, instead of keeping a child 
at his books, I keep him busy in a workshop, his hands labor 
to his mind’s advantage: while he regards himself only as a 
workman he is growing into a philosopher. This kind of 
exercise has other uses, of which I will speak hereafter ; and 
we shall see how philosophic amusements prepare us for the 
true functions of manhood. 
I have already remarked that purely speculative studies are 
rarely adapted to children, even when approaching the period 
of youth; but without making them enter very deeply into 
systematic physics, let all the experiments be connected by
-P-A-G-E-141
  NOTHING TO BE TAKEN UPON AUTHORITY. 141 
some kind of dependence by which the child can arrange them 
in his mind and recall them at need. For we cannot with- 
out something of this sort retain isolated facts or even rea- 
sonings long in memory. 
In investigating the laws of nature, always begin with the 
most common and most easily observed phenomena, and ac- 
custom your pupil not to consider these phenomena as reasons, 
but as facts. Taking a stone, I pretend to lay it upon the 
air; opening my hand, the stone falls. Looking at Emile, 
who is watching my motions, I say to him, ‘‘ Why did the 
stone fall ?” 
No child will hesitate in answering such a question, not 
even Emile, unless I have taken great care that he shall not 
know how. Any child will say that the stone falls because 
itis heavy. ‘* And what does heavy mean?” ‘* Whatever 
falls is heavy.” Here my little philosopher is really at a 
stand. Whether this first lesson in experimental physics 
aids him in understanding that subject or not, it will always 
be a practical lesson. 
Nothing to be Taken upon Authority. Learning from 
the Pupil’s own Necessities, 
As the child’s understanding matures, other important con- 
siderations demand that we choose his occupations with more 
care. As soonas he understands himself and all that relates 
to him well enough and broadly enough to discern what is to 
his advantage and what is becoming in him, he can appreciate 
the difference between work and play, and to regard the one 
solely as relaxation from the other. Objects really useful 
may then be included among his studies, and he will pay 
more attention to them than if amusement alone were con~ 
cerned. The ever-present law of necessity early _teaches_us

to do what we dislike, to escape evils we should dislike even 
more. Such is the use of foresight from which, judicious or 
injudicious, springs all the wisdom or all the unhappiness of 
mankind. 
We all long for happiness, but to acquire it we ought first 
to know what it is. To the natural man itis as simple as his 
mode of life; it means health, liberty, and the necessaries of 
\ life, and freedom from suffering. The happiness of man as a 
moral being is another thing, foreign to the present question. 
I cannot too often repeat that only objects purely physical 
can interest children, especially those who have not had their 
vanity aroused and their nature corrupted by the poison of 
opinion. 
‘When they provide beforehand for their own wants, their 
understanding is somewhat developed, and they are beginning 
to learn the value of time. We ought then by all means to 
accustom and to direct them to its employments to useful ends, 
these being such as are useful at their age and readily under- 
stood by them. The subject of moral order and the usages 
of society should not yet be presented, because children are 
not in a condition to understand such things. To force their 
attention upon things which, as we vaguely tell them, will be 
for their good, when they do not know what this good means, 
is foolish. It is no less foolish to assure them that such 
. things will benefit them when grown; for they take no inter- 
est in this supposed benefit, which they cannot understand. 
Let the child take nothing for granted because some one 
says it is so. Nothing is good to him but what he feels to 
be good. You think it far sighted to push him beyond his 
understanding of things, but you are mistaken. For the 
sake of arming him with weapons he does not knew how to 
use, you take from him one universal among men, common 
sense: you teach him to allow himself always te be led,

never to be more than a machine in the hands of others. If 
you will have. him docile while he is young, you will make 
him a credulous dupe when he is a man. You are continu- 
ally saying to him, ‘‘ All I require of you is for your own 
good, but you cannot understand it yet. What does it 
matter to me whether you do what I require or not? You 
are doing it entirely for your own sake.” With such fine 
speeches you are paving the way for some kind of trickster 
or fool, —some visionary babbler or charlatan, — who will 
entrap him or persuade him to adopt his own folly. 
A man may be well acquainted with things whose utility a 
child cannot comprehend; but is it right, or even possible, 
for a child to learn what a man ought to know? Try to 
teach the child all that is useful to him now, and you will 
keep him busy all the time. Why would you injure the 
studies suitable to him at his age by giving him those of an 
age he may never attain? ‘‘ But,” you say, ‘‘ will there be 
time for learning what he ought to know when the time to 
use it has already come?” I do not know; but I am sure 
that he cannot learn it sooner. For experience and feeling 
are our real teachers, and we never understand thoroughly 
what is best for us except from the circumstances of our 
case. A child knows that he will one day be a man. All 
the ideas of manhood that he can understand give us op- 
portunities of teaching him; but of ‘those he cannot under- 
stand he should remain in absolute ignorance. This entire 
book is only a continued demonstration of this principle of 
education.

Things! things! I cannot repeat often enough that we 
attach too much importance to words. Our babbling educa- 
tion produces nothing but babblers. 
Suppose that while we are studying the course of the sun, 
and the manner of finding where the east is, Emile all at 
once interrupts me, to ask, ‘‘ What is the use of all this?” 
What an opportunity for a fine discourse! How many 
things I could tell him of in answering this question, espe- 
cially if anybody were by to listen! I could mention the 
advantages of travel and of commerce ; the peculiar products 
of each climate; the manners of different nations; the use 
of the calendar; the calculation of seasons in agriculture ; 
the art of navigation, and the manner of travelling by sea, 
following the true course without knowing where we are. I 
. might take up politics, natural history, astronomy, even 
ethics and international law, by way of giving my pupil an 
exalted idea of all these sciences, and a strong desire to 
learn them. When I have done, the boy will not have 
understood a single idea out of all my pedantic display. He 
would like to ask again, ‘‘ What is the use of finding out 
where the east is?” but dares not, lest I might be angry. 
He finds it more to his interest to pretend to understand 
what he has been compelled to hear. This is not at all an 
uncommon case in superior education, so-called. 
But our Emile, brought up more like a rustic, and care- 
fully taught to think very slowly, will not listen to all this. 
He will run away at the first word he does not understand, 
and play about the room, leaving me to harangue all by 
myself. Let us find a simpler way; this scientific display 
does him no good. 
We were noticing the position of the forest north of 
Montmorency, when he interrupted me with the eager ques- 
tion, ‘‘ What is the use of knowing that?’’ ‘* You may be

right,” said I; ‘‘ we must take time to think about it; and 
if there is really no use in it, we will not try it again, for we 
have enough to do that is of use.” We went at something 
else, and there was no more geography that day. 
The next morning I proposed a walk before breakfast. 
Nothing could have pleased him better; children are always 
ready to run about, and this boy had sturdy legs of his own. 
We went into the forest, and wandered over the fields; we 
lost ourselves, having no idea where we were ; and when we 
intended to go home, could not find our way. Time passed ; 
the heat of the day came on; we were hungry. In vain did 
we hurry about from place to place; we found everywhere 
nothing but woods, quarries, plains, and not a landmark 
that we knew. Heated, worn out with fatigue, and very 
hungry, our running about only led us more and more astray. 
At last we sat down to rest and to think the matter over. 
Emile, like any other child, did not think about it; he cried. 
He did not know that we were near the gate of Montmorency, 
and that only a narrow strip of woodland hid it from us. 
But to him this narrow strip of woodland was a whole forest ; 
one of his stature would be lost to sight among bushes. 
After some moments of silence I said to him, with a 
troubled air, 
‘My dear Emile, what shall we do to get away from here?” 
FEaore. [In a profuse perspiration, and crying bitterly.] I 
don’t know. I’m tired. I’mhungry. I’m thirsty. I can’t 
do anything. 
Jean Jacqurs. Do you think I am better off than you, or 
that I would mind crying too, if crying would do for my 
breakfast? ‘There is no use in crying; the thing is, to find 
our way. Let me see your watch; what time is it? 
Emme. It is twelve o’clock, and I haven’t had my break- 
fast.

come here to find me. Twelve o’clock? it was just this time 
yesterday that we noticed where Montmorency is. Could we 
see where it is just as well from this forest? 
Eaorz. Yes; but yesterday we saw the forest, and we can- 
not see the town from this place. 
Jean Jacqurs. That is a pity. I wonder if we could find 
out where it is without seeing it? 
Emer. Oh, my dear friend! 
Jean Jacques. Did not we say that this forest is— 
Emuex. North of Montmorency. 
Jean Jacques. If that is true, Montmorency must be — 
Eaorx. South of the forest. 
Jean Jacques. There is a way of finding out the north at 
noon. \ 
Eante. Yes; by the direction of our shadows. 
JEAN Jacques. But the south? 
Enz. How can we find that? 
JEAN Jacques. The south is opposite the north. 
Ewe. That is true ; all we have to do is to find the side 
opposite the shadows. Oh, there’s the south! there’s the 
south! Montmorency must surely be on that side; let us 
look on that side. 
Jean Jacques. Perhaps you are right. Let us take this 
path through the forest.

life forget this day’s lesson. Now if I had only made him 
imagine it all-indoors, my lecture would have been entirely 
forgotten by the next day. We should teach as much as 
possible by actions, and say only what we cannot do.     
   Robinson Crusoe. 
In his legitimate preference for teaching by the eye and hand 
and by real things, and in his aversion to the barren and erroneous 
method of teaching from books alone, Rousseau, constantly carried 
away by the passionate ardor of his nature, rushes into an opposite 
extreme, and exclaims, ‘‘I hate books; they only teach us to talk 
about what we do not understand.” Then, checked in the full tide 
of this declamation by his own good sense, he adds : — 
Since we must have books, there is one which, to my mind, 
furnishes the finest of treatises on education according to 
nature. My Emile shall read this book before any other ; it 
shall for a long time be his entire library, and shall always 
hold an honorable place. It shall be the text on which all 
our discussions of natural science shall be only commentaries. 
It shall be a test for all we meet during our progress toward 
a ripened judgment, and so long as our taste is unspoiled, 
we shall enjoy reading it. What wonderful book is this? 
Aristotle? Pliny? Buffon? No; it is ‘‘ Robinson Crusoe.” 
The story of this man, alone on his island, unaided by his 
fellow-men, without any art or its implements, and yet pro- 
viding for his own preservation and subsistence, even con- 
triving to live in what might be called comfort, is interesting 
to persons of all ages. It. may be made delightful to chil- * 
dren in a thousand ways. Thus we make the desert island, 
which I used at the outset for a comparison, a reality. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
148 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
This condition is not, I grant, that of man in society; and 
to all appearance Emile will never oceupy it; but from it he 
ought to judge of all others. The surest way to rise above 
prejudice, and to judge of things in their true relations, is to 
put ourselves in the place of an isolated man, and decide as 
he must concerning their real utility. 
Disencumbered of its less profitable portions, this romance 
from its beginning, the shipwreck of Crusoe on the island, to 
its end, the arrival of the vessel which takes him away, will 
yield amusement and instruction to Emile during the period 
now in question. I would have him completely carried away 
by it, continually thinking of Crusoe’s fort, his goats, and 
his plantations. I would have him learn, not from books, 
but from real things, all he would need to know under the 
yame circumstances. He should be encouraged to play 
Robinson Crusoe ; to imagine himself clad in skins, wearing 
a great cap and sword, and all the array of that grotesque 
figure, down to the umbrella, of which he would have no 
need If he happens to be in want of anything, I hope he 
will contrive something to supply its place. Let him look 
carefully into all that his hero did, and decide whether any of 
it was unnecessary, or might have been done in a better way. 
Let him notice Crusoe’s mistakes and avoid them under like 
circumstances. He will very likely plan for himself sur- 
roundings like Crusoe’s, —a real castle in the air, natural at 
his happy age when we think ourselves rich if we are free 
and have the necessaries of life. How useful this hobby 
might be made if some man of sense would only suggest ié 
and turn it to good account! The child, eager to build a 
storehouse for his island, would be more desirous to learn 
than his master would be to teach him. He would be anx- 
ious to know everything he could make use of, and nothing 
besides. You would not need to guide, but to restrain him.

JUDGING FROM APPEARANCES. ~-<s 149 
Here Rousseau insists upon giving a child some trade, no matter * > 
what his station in life may be; and in 1762 he uttered these pro- \ 
phetic words, remarkable indeed, when we call to mind the disorders 
at the close of that century : — | 
You trust to the present condition of society, without re- 
flecting that it is subject to unavoidable revolutions, and that 
you can neither foresee nor prevent what is to affect the fate 
of your own children. The great are brought low, the poor 
are made rich, the king becomes a subject. Are the blows \ 
of fate so uncommon that you can expect to escape them? \ 
We are approaching a, crisis, the age of rovolutions. Who 
can tell what will become of you then? All that man has 
done man may destroy. No characters but those stamped 
by nature are ineffaceable; and nature did not make princes, 
or rich men, or nobles.     
    This advice was followed. In the highest grades of society it | 
became the fashion to learn some handicraft. It is well known that 
Louis XVI. was proud of his skill as a locksmith. Among the exiles 
of a later period, many owed their living to the trade they had thus 
learned. 
To return to mile: Rousseau selects for him the trade of a 
joiner, and goes so far as to employ him and his tutor in that kin 
of labor for one or more days of every week under a master who 
pays them actual wages for their work. 
Judging from Appearances. The Broken Stick. 
Ir I have thus far made myself understood, you may see 
how, with regular physical exercise and manual labor, I am 
at the same time giving my pupil a taste for reflection and 
meditation. This will counterbalance the indolence which 
might result from his indifference to other men and from the 
dormant state of his passions} He must work like a peasant 
and think like a philosopher,/or he will be as idle as a —— 
as me!

   ) Fhe great secret of education is to make physical and menta,_ 
* exercises serve as relaxation for each other./ At first our 
pupil had nothing but sensations, and now/he has ideas. 
Then he only perceived, but now he judges. For from com- 
parison of many successive or simultaneous sensations, 
e with the judgments based on them, arises a kind of mixed or 
complex sensation which I call an idea. 
The different manner in which ideas are formed gives each 
mind its peculiar character. A mind is solid if it shape its 
ideas according to the true relations of things; superficial, if 
content with their apparent relations ; accurate, if it behold 
things as they really are; unsound, if it understand them in- 
correctly; disordered, if it fabricate imaginary relations, 
neither apparent nor real; imbecile, if it do not compare 
ideas at all. /Greater or less mental power in different men 
consists in their greater or less readiness in comparing ideas 
and discovering their relations. 
From simple as well as complex sensations, we form judg- 
ments which I will call simple ideas. In a sensation the 
judgment is wholly passive, only affirming that we feel what 
feel. /In a preception or idea, the judgment is active; it 
brings together, compares, and determines relations not de- 
termined by the senses. This is the only point of difference, 
. | but it is important. Nature never deceives us; it is always 
NS we who deceive ourselves. 
~~ “Ysee a child eight years old helped to some frozen custard. 
Without knowing what it is, he puts a spoonful in his mouth, 
and feeling the cold sensation, exclaims, ‘‘ Ah, that burns!” 
He feels a keen sensation ; he knows of none more so than 
heat, and thinks that is what he now feels. He is of course 
mistaken ; the chillis painful, but does not burn him; and 
the two sensations are not alike, since, after encountering 
both, we never mistake one for the other. Jt is not, there-      
-P-A-G-E-151
JUDGING FROM APPEARANCES. 151 
fore, the sensation which misleads him, but the judgment 
based on it. 
It is the same when any one sees for the first time a mir- 
ror or optical apparatus; or enters a deep cellar in mid- 
winter or midsummer ; or plunges his hand, either very warm 
or very cold, into tepid water; or rolls a little ball between 
two of his fingers held crosswise. If he is satisfied with 
describing what he perceives or feels, keeping his judgment 
in abeyance, he cannot be mistaken. But when he decides 
upon appearances, his judgment is active; it compares, and 
infers relations it does not perceive; and it may then be 
mistaken. He will need experience to prevent or correct 
such mistakes. Show your pupil clouds passing over the 
moon at night, and he will think that the moon is moving in 
an opposite direction, and that the clouds are at rest. He 
will the more readily infer that this is the case, because he 
usually sees small objects, not large ones, in motion, and 
because the clouds seem to him larger than the moon, of 
whose distance he has no idea. When from a moving boat 
he sees the shore at a little distance, he makes the contrary 
mistake of thinking that the earth moves. For, unconscious 
of his own motion, the boat, the water, and the entire 
horizon seem to him one immovable whole of which the 
moying shore is only one part. 
The first time a child sees a stick half immersed in water, 
it seems to be broken. The sensation is a true one, and 
would be, even if we did not know the reason for this 
appearance. If therefore you ask him what he sees, he 
answers truly, ‘‘A broken stick,” because he is fully con- 
scious of the sensation of a broken stick. But when, de- 
ceived by his julgment, he goes farther, and after saying 
that he sees a troken stick, he says again that the stick 
really is brokea, he says what is not true; and why?

CO Because his judgment becomes active ; he decides uo longer 
from observation, but from inference, when he declares as a 
( fact what he does not actually perceive ; namely, that touch 
\would confirm the judgment based upon sight alone. 
The best way of learning to judge correctly is the one 
hich tends to simplify our experience, and enables us to 
ake no mistakes even when we dispense with experience 
altogether. / It follows from this that after having long veri- 
ed the testimony of one sense by that of another, we must 
further learn to verify the testimony of each sense by itself 
without appeal to any ot Then each sensation at once 
becomes an idea, and an idea in accordance with the truth. 
With such acquisitions I have endeavored to store this third 
period of human life. 
To follow this plan requires a patience and a circumspec- 
tion of which few teachers are capable, and without which 
a pupil will never learn to judge correctly. For example: 
if, when he is misled by the appearance of a broken stick, 
you endeavor to show him his mistake by taking the stick 
quickly out of the water, you may perhaps undeceive him, 
but what will you teach him? Nothing he might not have 
learned for himself. You ought not thus to teach him one 
detached truth, instead of showing him how he may always 
discover for himself any truth. If you really mean to teach 
him, do not at once undeceive him. Let Emile and myself 
serve you for example. 
In the first place, any child educated in the ordinary way 
would, to the second of the two questions above mentioned, 
answer, ‘‘ Of course the stick is broken.”” I doubt whether 
Emile would give this answer. Seeing no need of being 
learned or of appearing learned, he never j dges hastily, but 
only from evidence. Knowing how easily appearances de- 
ceive us, as in the case of perspective, he is far from    
    
 
-P-A-G-E-153
JUDGING FROM APPEARANCES. 153 
finding the evidence in the present case sufficient. Besides, 
knowing from experience that my most trivial question 
always has an object which he does not at once discover, he 
is not in the habit of giving heedless answers. On the con- 
trary, he is on his guard and attentive; he looks into the 
matter very carefully before replying. He never gives me 
an answer with which he is not himself satisfied, and he is 
not easily satisfied. Moreover, he and I do not pride our- 
selves on knowing facts exactly, but only on making few 
mistakes. We should be much more disconcerted if we ~ 
found ourselves satisfied with an insufficient reason than if 
we had discovered none at all. The confession, ‘*I do not 
know,” suits us both so well, and we repeat it so often, that 
it costs neither of us anything. But whether for this once 
he is careless, or avoids the difficulty by a convenient ‘I 
do not know,” my answer is the same: ‘‘ Let us see; let us 
find out.” 
The stick, half-way in the water, is fixed in a vertical 
position. To find out whether it is broken, as it appears to 
be, how much we must do before we take it out of the water, 
or even touch it! First, we go entirely round it, and 
observe that the fracture goes around with us. It is our 
eye alone, then, that changes it; and a glance cannot moye 
things from place to place. 
Secondly, we look directly down the stick, from the end 
outside of the water; then the stick is no longer bent, 
because the end next our eye exactly hides the other end 
from us. Has our eye straightened the stick? 
Thirdly, we stir the surface of the water, and see the stick 
bend itself into several curves, move in a zig-zag direction, 
and follow the undulations of the water. Has the motion 
we gave the water been enough thus to break, to soften, and 
to melt the stick? 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 CONCERNING EDUCATION. 
Fourth, we draw off the water and see the stick straighten 
itself as fast as the water is lowered. Is not this more than 
enough to illustrate the fact and to find out the refraction? 
It is not then true that the eye deceives us, since by its aid 
alone we can correct the mistakes we ascribe to it. 
Suppose the child so dull as not to understand the result 
of these experiments. Then we must call touch to the aid 
of sight. Instead of taking the stick out of the water, leave 
it there, and let him pass his hand from one end of it to the 
other. He will feel no angle; the stick, therefore, is not 
broken. 
You will tell me that these are not only judgments but 
formal reasonings. True; but do you not see that, as soon 
as the mind has attained to ideas, all judgment is reasoning? 
The consciousness of any sensation is a proposition, a judg- 
ment. As soon, therefore, as we compare one sensation 
with another, we reason. The art of judging and the art of 
reasoning are precisely the same. 
If, from the lesson of this stick, Emile does not under- 
stand the idea of refraction, he will never understand it at 
all. He shall never dissect insects, or count the spots on the 
sun; he shall not even know what a microscope or a tele- 
scope is. 
Your learned pupils will laugh at his ignorance, and will 
not be very far wrong. For before he uses these instru- 
ments, I intend he shall invent them; and you may well 
suppose that this will not be soon done. 
This shall be the spirit of all my methods of teaching 
during this period. If the child rolls a bullet between two 
crossed fingers, I will not let him look at it till he is other- 
wise convinced that there is only one bullet there.

Result. The Pupil at the Age of Fifteen. 
I rar« these explanations will suffice to mark distinctly 
the advance my pupil’s mind has hitherto made, and the 
route by which he has advanced. You are probably alarmed 
at the number of subjects I have brought to his notice. / You 
are afraid I will overwhelm his mind with all this knowledge. 
But I teach him rather not to know them than to know them. 
I am showing him a path to knowledge not indeed difficult, 
but without limit, slowly measured, long, or rather endless, 
and tedious to follow. I am showing him how to take the 
first steps, so that he may know its beginning, but allow him 
to go no farther. 
Obliged to learn by his own effort, he employs his own 
reason, not that of another. Most of our mistakes arise less 
within ourselves than from others; so that if he is not to be 
ruled by opinion, he must receive nothing upon authority. 
Such continual exercise must invigorate the mind as labor 
and fatigue strengthen the body. 
he mind as well as the body can bear only what its 
strength will allow. When the understanding fully masters 
thing before intrusting it to the memory, what it afterward 
draws therefrom isin reality its own. But if instead we load 
the memory with matters the understanding has not mastered, 
we run the risk of never finding there anything that belongs 
to it. 
Emile has little knowledge, but it is really his own; he 
knows nothing by halves ; and the most important fact is that 
he does not now know things he will one day know; that 
many things known to other people he never will know; and 
that there is an infinity of things which neither he nor any 
one else ever will know. He is prepared for knowledge of 
every kind; not because he has so much, but because he
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 CONCERNING EDUCATION. ees 
knows how to acquire it; his mind is open toit, and, as Mon- 
taigne says, i is at le: e.| I shall be 
satisfied if he knows how to find out the ‘‘ wherefore” of 
é everything he knows and the ‘‘ why”’ of everything he be- 
/ \slieves. I repeat that my object is not to give him knowledge, le but to teach him how to acquire it at_need; to estimate it at 
_ its true value, and above all things, to love the truth. By 
"this method we advance slowly, but take no useless steps, and 
re not obliged to retrace a single one. 
j Emile understands only the natural and purely physical 
/ sciences. He does not even know the name of history, or the 
meaning of metaphysics and ethics. He knows the essential 
relations between men and things, but nothing of the moral 
relations between man andman. He does not readily gener- 
alize or conceive of abstractions. He observes the qualities 
common to certain bodies without reasoning about the quali- 
ties themselves. With the aid of geometric figures and al- 
gebraic signs, he knows something of extension and quantity. 
Upon these figures and signs his senses rest their knowledge 
of the abstractions just named. He makes no attempt to 
learn the nature of things, but only such of their relations as 
oncern himself. He estimates external things only by their 
relation to him; but this estimate is exact and positive, and 
in it fancies and conventionalities have no share. He values 
most those things that are most useful to him ; and never de- 
viating from this standard, is not influenced by general 
opinion. 
Emile is industrious, temperate, patient, steadfast, and full 
of courage. His imagination, never aroused, does not exag- 
gerate dangers. He feels few discomforts, and can bear 
pain with fortitude, edlase he has never learned to contend 
with fate. He does not yet know exactly what death is, but, 
accustomed to yield to the law of necessity, he will die when

: he must, without a groan or a struggle. Nature can do no 
more at that moment abhorred by all. Te live free and to 
have little to do with human affairs is the best way of learn, 
ing how to die. 
In a word, Emile has every virtue which affects himself, 
“To have the social virtues as well, he only needs to know the | 
relations which make them necessary; and this knowledge ! 
his mind is ready to receive. He considers himself independ- : 
ently of others, and is satisfied when others do not think of 
“him at all. He exacts nothing from others, and never thinks 
of owing anything to them. He is in human society, 
and depends solely upon himself. /He has the best right of / / 
all to be independent, for he is all that any one can be at his 
age. He has no errors but such as a human being must 
have; no vices but those from which no one can warrant him- Sa 
self exempt., He has a sound constitution, active limbs, a 
fair and unprejudiced mind, a heart free and without passions. 
_Self-love, the first and most natural of all, has scarcely mani- 
fested itself at all. Without disturbing any one’s peace of 
mind he has led a happy, contented life, as free as nature 
will allow. Do you think a youth who has thus attained his 
fifteenth year has lost the years that have gone before?

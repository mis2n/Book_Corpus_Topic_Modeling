    PREFACE 
Tuts book is designed to serve as a guide for laboratory 
experiments in educational psychology. Only those ex- 
periments have been selected which: have a more or less 
direct bearing upon educational problems. It is intended 
to be a laboratory manual for experimental work done 
parallel with an introductory course in educational psy- 
chology, or in other introductory educational courses in 
which the psychological aspect is emphasized. 
No previous training in experimental work is necessary. 
The directions are so given that in most experiments 
relatively simple apparatus is used. For many experi- 
ments the material is contained in the book, for others it 
may easily be constructed, and for the rest it must be 
obtained from the sources indicated in each case. 
In pursuing the laboratory work the order of the chap- 
ters permits of considerable flexibility. All chapters 
except V and VI are independent of one another and any 
desired order may be adopted. The work is intended to 
occupy two hours weekly through one semester. It is 
best to divide the class into groups of not more than eight 
or ten, in charge of an instructor who shall see that the 
experiments are done accurately and the notes written up 
carefully. BA \

  vi PREFACE 
In order to emphasize the practical aspects of the prin- 
ciples brought out in the various experiments, a brief set 
of exercises is placed at the end of each chapter which 
should be worked out and handed in as a part of the 
laboratory notes. Additional references are given to 
excellent practical problems which may best be assigned 
for discussion during the recitation hour. 
I wish to express my obligations to Professor V. A. C. 
Henmon, who suggested numerous changes in the manu- 
script, to Dr. B. Q. Morgan, who read the manuscript, 
and to Professor W. F. Dearborn, with whose coéperation 
several experiments, particularly those in Chapters V, 
VII, and VIII, were planned

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION 
  Tue chief changes in this revision consist in the addition 
of three short chapters (II, III, and IV), several tables of 
results for various tests, and a number of questions on the 
results of experiments. Verbal changes have been intro- 
duced here and there, with a view to making the directions 
for experiments or the interpretation of the results more 
definite. The writer has found it profitable to introduce 
into the work of his own classes the use of educational 
scales and tests for school subjects. In that case it is 
necessary to omit certain experiments in this book in order 
to make room for such additional tests within a semester’s 
time. Such omissions will depend necessarily upon the 
plan of the course and upon the facilities available. The 
writer has omitted the following experiments in the order 
named: d, page 140; and c, page 142, in Chapter XIII; 
Nos. 2 and 3 in Chapter XV; Chapters XVI, XII, and 
XIV. The number of these experiments to be omitted 
depends necessarily upon the amount of other work 
introduced.

CHAPTER I 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
Problem. The experiments in this chapter are intro- 
duced with a threefold purpose: first, to show the nature 
and amounts of differences in mental abilities between in- 
dividuals; second, to determine to what extent mental 
ability in one direction is accompanied by ability in other 
directions; and third, to demonstrate some simple and 
accurate means of measuring mental functions. In order 
to gain scientific insight into these problems, four types 
of mental functions or abilities will be selected for measure- 
ment, namely: memory, perception, controlled associa- 
tion, and arithmetical ability. 
Procedure. 1. Memory. a. Auditory Memory Span. 
The purpose of this test is to determine the largest number 
of unrelated words that can be recalled immediately after 
one hearing. This test should be conducted by the in- 
structor in charge and performed simultaneously by the en-

tire class, as follows: Be prepared with pencil and paper. 
The person conducting the experiment will read the follow- 
ing groups of words at the rate of one word per second. 
Immediately after each group is read, write in correct 
order all the words remembered. Then the next group 
will be read, and soon. Do not read the test words given 
below until the experiment is finished. 
Tree, box, chair, ice. 
Floor, book, house, pipe, lake. 
Fence, card, pin, lamp, coal, horse. 
Wood, dog, stone, nest, ink, nail, leaf. 
Wall, fork, glass, board, hat, cup, lead, cat. 
Bench, snow, watch, man, rose, heart, gold, king, nose. 
Girl, plant, bread, skate, roof, corn, boy, door, face, key. 
Compare your results with the lists as read and find the 
largest number of words remembered in correct order from 
any one group. This is your memory span in the auditory 
field. The use to be made of this measurement will be 
pointed out below. 
b. Memorizing. Learn the following stanza by esailti 
it through entirely, not by parts, and record the exact 
time in minutes and seconds. Consider it memorized as 
soon as you can repeat it without consulting the text. 
A wanderer is man from his birth. ; 
He was born in a ship 3 
On the breast of the river of Time; 
Brimming with wonder and joy, ¢ 
He spreads out his arms to the light, 
Rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream, .

Results. In order to show the bearing of these experi- 
ments upon the question of individual differences, it is 
necessary to obtain the data of the tests from a consider- 
able number of persons and to compare them with one 
another. For this purpose the results in Table I are to be 
used. This table gives the actual measurements of fifty 
adult students in the eight tests here used. 
Draw a curve of distribution for the results of each test 
showing how ‘many individuals belong to each grade of 
ability. For example, in the memory span test, let the 
abscisse represent the different numbers of words recalled 
and the ordinates the number of persons possessing these 
different spans. See. the curves in Figs. 1 and 2. In the 
other tests, the intervals of time should be graded by ten- 
second steps. Thus, for the E test, find how many persons 
finished in from 20-29 seconds, 30-39 seconds, etc. Use 
the data in Table I plus your own personal measurements. 
1 If the instructor is pressed for time, it may be sufficient to have 
the class construct distribution curves for only a part of the tests, say 
four instead of eight, in order to acquire familiarity with the mean- 
ing and use of the principle of these curves. é

  Make a free-hand drawing of a curve to show what you

2. To which grade of ability do the majority of individ- 
uals in these tests belong: superior, medium, or inferior? 
If you divide the entire range of abilities indicated on the 
base line of the distribution curve into three equal parts 
and designate these thirds as superior, medium, and inferior 
respectively, what proportion of individuals belong to 
each part? For example, what percentage of persons have 
a memorizing ability, Fig. 2, of from 40 seconds tor: 59, 
from 2:00 to 3:19, and from 3:20 to 4:39? In this 
manner make a composite table of all the curves to show 
the percentage of persons in each third.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES It 
  The normal distribution curve is a symmetrical, bell- 
shaped curve, like the one in Fig. 1, and is considered 
for most mental traits to conform fairly closely to the 
mathematical probability or chance curve. If the base 
line of the symmetrical curve is divided into three equal 
distances, approximately 2 or 66% of individuals belong 
to the middle or medium group, 4 or 17% of persons belong 
to the upper or superior group, and } or 17% belong to 
the lower or inferior group. The purpose of the present 
problem is to determine what percentage of persons in 
these tests belongs to each group. 
3. On the basis of these distribution curves, would it 
be fair to divide a group of persons into, for example, two 
distinct groups, bright and dull? Why? 
4. How much better are the superior individuals 
than the inferior ones? For example, in the E test 
in Table I, the best record is 25 seconds, while the 
lowest is 1 minute and 30 seconds. That is, the best 
one is 3.6 times as fast as the slowest one. Construct 
a table to show a comparison for all the tests. This 
table will have 4 columns. In the first column put the 
name of the test, in the second column put the poorest 
record of the 50 in Table I for that test, in the third 
column put the best record, and in the fourth put the 
ratio of the poorest’to the best. This ratio for the E 
test would be 1:3.6. Place at the bottom of the fourth 
column the average ratio which will indicate how much 
better on the average the best individual in any test is 
than the poorest. C

What does it show with regard to the nature, range, and

CHAPTER II- 
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN ABILITIES IN SCHOOL 
SUBJECTS 
Problem. One of the most significant facts discovered 
by the recent tests and measurements of the abilities of 
pupils is the enormously wide range of ability shown by 
the pupils in the same class or grade. The purpose of the 
experiment in this chapter is to show how wide this range 
is in one school subject, namely, reading. The immediate 
purpose of the experiment is to measure three elements 
in reading ability, speed, comprehension, and size of 
vocabulary. 
Procedure. The speed and comprehension of reading 
will be measured by the test passages printed on. the 
next two pages. Do not read them or examine them until 
you are ready to do the test. At a signal from the in- 
structor you will be asked to turn to the first passage, 
known as number 7, and asked to read as rapidly as you 
can, consistent with grasping the thought content as fully 
as possible. Do not read over anything a second time, but 
read on continuously. At the end of the 30 seconds, the 
instructor will give the, signal to stop. Stop immediately 
and draw a line around the last word read. Then imme- 
diately write out in your own words, as fully as you can, 
the thought content of the amount that you read. 
After this has been finished the test will be repeated in 
exactly the same manner with passage number 9. The 
purpose of two tests is merely to obtain a more correct

. determination of the speed and comprehension of reading 
than is possible by means of a single test. 
The range of vocabulary is determined by a test designed 
for that purpose on later pages. Follow the directions 
given at the head of the test. 
No. 7. 
Captain John Hull was the mint-master of Massachusetts, and 
coined all the money that was made there. This was a new line 
of business, for in the earlier days of the colony the current 
coinage consisted of gold and silver money of England, Portu- 
gal, and Spain. These coins being scarce, the people were often 
forced to barter their commodities instead of selling them. 
For instance, if a man wanted to buy a coat, he perhaps ex- 
changed a bearskin for it. If he wished for a barrel of molasses, 
he might purchase it with a pile of pine boards. Musket-bullets 
were used instead of ,farthings. The Indians had a sort of 
money called wampum, which was made of clam-shells, and this 
strange sort of specie was likewise taken in payment of debts by 
the English settlers. Bank-bills had never been heard of. 
There was not money enough of any kind, in many parts of the 
country, to pay the salaries of the ministers, so that they some- 
times had to take quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or cords of 
wood instead of silver or gold. 
As the people grew more numerous and their trade one with 
another increased, the want of current money was still more 
sensibly felt. To supply the demand the general court passed 
a law for establishing a coinage of shillings, sixpences, and 
threepences. Captain John Hull was appointed to manufac- 
ture this money, and was to have about one shilling out of every 
twenty to pay him for the trouble of making them.

To an American visiting Europe, the long voyage he has to 
make is an excellent preparative. The temporary absence of 
worldly scenes and employments produces a state of mind pe- 
culiarly fitted to receive new and vivid impressions. The vast 
space of waters that separates the hemispheres is like a blank 
page in existence. There is no gradual transition, by which, 
as in Europe, the features and population of one country blend 
almost imperceptibly with those of another. From the mo- 
ment you lose sight of the land you have left, all is vacancy 
until you step on the opposite shore, and are launched at once 
into the bustle and novelties of another world. 
In traveling by land there is a continuity of scene and a con- 
nected succession of persons and incidents, that carry on the 
story: of life, and lessen the effect of absence and separation. 
We drag, it is true, “a lengthening chain,” at each remove. of 
our pilgrimage; but the chain is unbroken: we can trace it 
back link by link; and we feel that the last still grapples us to 
home but a wide sea voyage severs us at once. It makes us 
conscious of being cast loose. from the secure anchorage of 
settled life, and sent adrift upon a doubtful world. It inter- 
poses a gulf, not merely imaginary, but real, between us and” 
our homes — a gulf subject to tempest, and fear, and uncer- 
tainty, rendering distance palpable, and return precarious. 
Such, at least, was the case with myself. As I saw the last 
blue line of my native land fade away like a cloud in the hori- 
zon, it seemed as if I had closed one volume of the world and its 
concerns, and had time for meditation, before I opened another.

18 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
The comprehension of reading is determined by compar- 
ing your written reproduction of thought with the original 
passage to see if you have expressed any ideas incorrectly 
or ideas not in the test passage. If you have, cross off all 
such words or sentences or parts of sentences. Then count 
the number of words that you wrote which represent a 
correct statement of thought. The emphasis is not on the 
verbatim reproduction. In the case of adults, usually 
very little needs to be discarded. In the case of children, 
not more than 7% of the words written need on the 
average to be discarded. 
Present your results in the form of a table having three 
columns, one each for speed, comprehension, and vocabu- 
lary respectively. Place under each heading the score 
made in the first and second test, and the average at the 
bottom. Compare these averages, which represent your 
own reading ability, with the following standard scores:

  20 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
In plotting the curves for speed of reading, use on the base 
line the following steps of words read per second: 2.0-2.4, 
2.5-2.9, 3.0-3.4, etc. In the curve for comprehension, 
use the following intervals: 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, etc. In 
the curve for vocabulary, use the following intervals: 4o- 
44, 45-49, 50-54, etc. 
Discuss the following questions : 
1. How does the range of individual differences in 
reading ability compare with the range of ability in 
the tests of the preceding chapter? What percentage 
of the persons in Table II fall below the eighth grade 
standard in speed, comprehension, or both? In vocab- 
ulary? This may be determined from your distribution 
curves. 
2. Similar wide ranges of differences in ability of the 
pupils in a given class exist in all school subjects. What 
should schools do in order to take account of these differ- 
ences? Suggest as many different possible plans as you 
can. What would be the most feasible plan? 
3. On the basis of the data in Table II, formulate as 
definite an answer as you can to the question as to whether 
the rapid reader grasps, relatively or absolutely, as much 
of what he reads as the slow reader. To make a definite 
comparison, select the five most rapid readers and the five 
slowest readers and compute the average speed of reading 
and the average score for comprehension of each group. 
What does your comparison show? Suppose that two 
pupils, a rapid reader and a slow reader, have one hour 
in which to prepare a history lesson involving a consider-
-P-A-G-E-31
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 21 
able amount of reading, which of the two pupils will have 
the advantage? Why? 
4. Would it be advisable to encourage, either in pupils 
or in yourself, an effort to increase the rate of reading? 
Why? How might it be accomplished ?

  CHAPTER III 
THE DISTRIBUTION OF MARKS 
  Problem. One of the useful applications of the principle 
of the distribution curve is to the assignment of marks. 
The purpose of the work in this chapter is to determine 
how different teachers in a given school actually assign 
marks to their classes, how much they differ from one 
another and from the normal distribution curve.., 
Procedure and Results. a. The Distribution of Marks 
in a Single Large Class. The following are the grades of a 
class in psychology. The passing grade in this institution

obtained from the experiments of the preceding chapters? 
Why? 
2. What criticisms of this set of grades can you suggest ? 
Were enough marks below 70 given? Above 93? What 
explanation can you give of the fact that certain marks 
are used far more frequently than ‘others, for example, 86, 
88, go, etc. ? 
3-- How small differences or steps do you think a teacher 
can distinguish on the marking scale? 
b. Distribution of Marks by Different Teachers in the 
Same School. The following marks were assigned by six 
teachers to their respective classes in the first year in a 
certain high school :

  THE DISTRIBUTION OF MARKS 25 
Plot a distribution curve for each set of grades, using along 
the base line from left to right the individual marks as 
follows ¢ NSP P, P+, F—, F, F+, etc. 
1. Criticise each set of marks and point out whether 
you think the marks are too high or too low, or approxi- 
mately correct.. 
2A theory, held by many investigators of marks and 
supported by good reasons, is that marks of large groups 
of pupils should be ‘digeributed according to the normal 
distribution or probability curve, similar to the curve in 
. Fig. 1. According to this assumption, when five divi- 
sions on the marking scale aré used, the marks should be 
distributed approximately to the following percentages 
of pupils: 
‘ A, gr excellent, 93-100, to 7% 
B, or good, 85= 92, to 24% 
C, or fair, 77- 84, to 38% 
D, or passable, 70- 76, to 24% 
E, or failure, below 70, to .7% 
Prepare a table to show to what percentage of pupils 
each teacher assigned each of the 5 steps. For example, 
what percentage of pupils in the English class received 
the gfade of N, P, F, etc.? Compare each teacher’s dis- 
tribution with the above theoretical distribution. 
3. Discuss now the general proposition that marks 
should be assigned in conformity with the normal distri- 
bution or.probability curve. What reasons in ;support 
of this theory can you give? Would you expect abilities 
in school subjects to be distributed in the same manner 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
26 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
as mental traits generally are, such, for example, as are 
measured in the tests in Chapter I. What objections to 
the proposition can you mention? 
4. If you grant that marks on the whole should be dis- 
tributed in approximate conformity with the probability 
curve, in how small classes would you expect reasonably 
close conformity ? 
5. What value would there be in having the teachers in 
a school try to bear in mind an approximate or reasonably 
close conformity to the normal distribution curve in mak- 
ing out their grades?

CHAPTER IV 
  THE COEFFICIENT OF CORRELATION 
Problem. The coefficient of correlation is an expression 
used so widely in educational and psychological work that 
the student ought to have some definite conception of its 
meaning and application. The problem of the present 
exercise is to learn how this coefficient is computed and 
how it is used. Suppose we wish fo discover to what 
extent pupils in general have similar amounts of ability 
in different school subjects, the-exact amount of this simi- 
larity or correlation is expressed by means of the coeffi- 
cient of correlation. Specifically, the question involved 
would be this: *To what extent are the good pupils in one 
subject also good in other subjects, to what extent are the 
poor pupils in one subject also poor in other subjects, and 
to what extent are the average pupils in one subject also 
average in other subjects? Or, suppose we wish to dis- 
cover to what extent speed of reading is accompanied by 
complete comprehension, whether the fast reader compre- 
hends less than the slow reader, and vice versa, we can 
express this relationship by means of the coefficient of 
correlation between these two elements in reading ability. 
The value of the coefficient of correlation ranges from 
+ 1.00 through o to — 1,00. A coefficient of correlation of 
+ 1.00 means a complete agreement. If the coefficient of 
27
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
correlation between ability in Latin and ability in German 
were + 1.00, it would mean that the best pupil in Latin 
is also the best pupil in German, the second best in Latin 
is also the second best in German, etc., down to the poorest 
pupil in Latin, who would also be the poorest in German. 
As the correlation drops farther and farther below + 1.00 
toward o, the closeness of this agreement becomes cor- 
respondingly less until o is reached. If the coefficient 
of correlation between ability in Latin and ability in 
German were — 1.00, it would mean that the best pupil in 
Latin would be the poorest pupil in German, the second 
best pupil in Latin would be the second poorest in German, 
etc. As the correlation rises above — 1.00 toward o the 
reversal becomes less and less until o is reached. A 
coefficient of o would mean that no relation exists. A 
pupil might have any amount of ability in one subject and 
any other amount of ability in the other subject. 
Procedure and Results. The coefficient of correlation 
may be computed by several methods. For the present 
exercise the formula known as the Pearson rank method, 
_ 6 Sum (a) 
: n (n2 — 1)’ 
will be used. In this formula 7 stands for the coefficient, 
d stands for the numerical difference in rank between the 
corresponding measurements, and n stands for the number 
of cases considered. A more concrete conception of the =e 
method may be obtained from a sample computation. 
The following numbers are the actual grades of ten pupils 
in Latin and Algebra:

In assigning ranks, it will be noticed that whenever “Z;o5 
29VO several numbers are tied for the same position, they are 
all given the middle rank. For example, in the Algebra 
grades there are two 90’s. Instead of giving them either 
4 or 5, they are given 4,5. In the Latin series there are 
three 88’s which are all given the rank of 6. 
Table IV gives the actual marks received by 22 eighth 
grade pupils in the subjects mentioned at the head of the 
table. Each mark is the average of all the marks received 
in these subjects in grades 5-8. These 22 pupils are all 
the pupils in a certain school from whom complete records 
for the upper four grades could be obtained. 
Compute the coefficient of correlation between as many 
of these subjects as may be designated by the instructor. 
The coefficients derived from these data will represent the 
actual amounts of correlation among school subjects so 
far as these can be determined from the limited number of 
pupils. Since the marks are averages covering four suc- 
cessive years, the results ought to have a rather high de- 
gree of reliability.

1. On the basis of these coefficients, what is your impres- 
sion as to the extent to which a pupil has similar ability 
in all school subjects? A general inspection of the marks r¢ 
in Table IV will give an approximate conception of the ex- 
tent of this similarity. The coefficient of correlation sim- 
ply expresses this similarity in exact terms. 
2. Is it true for a great majority of pupils that they 
may be good in one subject and rather poor or mediocre 
in other subjects and vice versa? What do the figures 
in Table IV actually show with regard to this point?

  CHAPTER V 
VISUAL TESTS AND DEFECTS 
  THE eye is the most important avenue of information. 
The need of care in preventing abuse and in correcting 
defects is patent to everyone. Every teacher should know 
something of the common types of visual defects, and how 
to detect them. 
1. Far- and Near-Sightedness. In order to see an 
object distinctly the rays of light from that object must 
come to a sharp focus upon the retina. If not, the object 
appears blurred. 
a. The Function of Accommodation. Accommodation 
is the change in the shape of the crystalline lens in order 
to focus the image upon the retina. \ For a distant point 
the lens flattens and for a near point it bulges. 
Set the end of a ruler against the cheek below the right 
eye so that it points in the direction of sight. Close the 
left eye. Hold a pin (point upward) at a distance of 
about thirty centimetres so that the point can be seen 
distinctly. Then gradually slide it along the edge of the 
ruler toward the eye until it comes to the place where the 
point begins to blur. Slide it outward until the point 
again appears distinct. This is the near point of vision. 
Care should be taken not to strain the eye by trying to 
see the point distinctly at a closer range than is natural for 
31

  the eye. Measure and record the distance from the eye. 
Make five measurements for the right and five for the left 
eye. Put your results into a table to show the separate 
readings and the average for each eye. For the normal 
eye, at the age of twenty, this distance is about twelve 
to fifteen centimetres. For the near-sighted eye it is less, 
and for the far-sighted eye it is more. 
~ Hold the pin at the distance just determined and set 
a page of print about twenty centimetres beyond the pin. 
Notice that as you focus on the pin the print appears 
blurred. As you focus on the print the pin appears 
blurred. Notice also the feeling of effort or strain in the 
eye as you shift from the print to the pin. 
In myopia, or near-sightedness, the eyeball usually is too 
long. The image is formed at a point in front of the retina. 
In hyperopia, or far-sightedness, the eyeball is ordinarily 
too short and the image would be formed at a point back 
of the retina. In the latter case it requires constant 
strain of the ciliary muscles to see near objects distinctly. 
Defects of accommodation are accentuated in large part 
by the effort and strain in the ciliary muscles which con- 
trol the lenses when looking at objects near by, as, for 
example, in reading. They may also be due to loss of 
elasticity in the lens or lack of responsiveness in the ciliary 
muscles. When the eyes are at rest they are focussed for 
distant points. Demonstrate this by closing your eyes 
for a few seconds, and then opening them. Notice that 
they are adjusted for distant objects and that it requires 
special effort to focus them upon the page in front of you.

VISUAL TESTS AND DEFECTS 33 
b. Snellen’s Test.1_ Hang the chart on the wall in good 
light, but not in direct sunlight. Be seated directly in 
front of it at a distance of twenty feet. Test each eye 
separately. Hold a card in front of one eye while the other 
eye is being examined. Do not press against the eyeball. 
Begin at the top of the chart and read aloud down as far 
as you can. The experimenter stands near the chart 
and takes note of the errors. Record the results of each 
eye separately in terms of a fraction in which the num- 
erator is twenty and the denominator is the number at 
the right of the last line read correctly. Thus, if the 
fraction is #$, it means that the last line read correctly 
is the one marked twenty feet, the distance at which the 
normal eye should be able to read it. If the fraction is 
4, or less, the eye is probably near-sighted. If the 10 
or 15 feet lines can be read the eye is probably far-sighted. 
In either case, it should receive the attention of a phy- 
sician. 
It is well to use several different vision charts so that 
the letters may not be memorized. If only one chart is 
at hand the results should be verified by covering with two 
cards all the letters in a given line, except the one to be 
read. Expose the letters in irregular order. 
2. Astigmatism. Use the chart which has the radiating 
lines. These are numbered like the figures on a clock. 
Hang the chart in good light and sit at a distance of twenty 
  Snellen’s Vision Charts, Cogan’s Prism Chart, and Holmgren’s 
worsteds can be obtained from F. A. Hardy & Co., 131 Wabash 
Ave., Chicago.

  feet. Cover one eye with a card, while the other eye is 
being tested. Look at the chart and notice whether any 
of the radii appear darker. Record these by their num- 
bers. To the normal eye the radii should appear equally 
distinct. If they appear considerably different the eye is 
astigmatic. 
3. Strabismus, or Heterophoria. This includes all those 
defects which are due to the lack of proper coérdination 
of the two eyeballs so that the two eyes do not converge 
simultaneously upon the same point. This condition is 
due to the fact that the external muscles of the eyes are 
not properly counterbalanced. The extreme form is 
commonly called cross-eyes. There are, however, many 
slight degrees of strabismus which can scarcely be noticed 
and yet have a very detrimental effect upon vision. The 
unbalanced eye receives a distorted image and the bur- 
den of sight falls upon the other eye. Demonstrate this 
by looking at some object, say a book, and pressing your 
finger against the lower side of one eyeball. Notice the 
distortion of vision. 
To detect the presence of strabismus, make the follow- 
ing test: Hang the Cogan Prism chart about six inches 
away from the wall. Place a lighted candle or lamp just 
back of the small opening at the centre of the chart. 
Take a position twenty feet from the chart so that the 
eyes are on a level with the aperture. The light must be 
seen directly through the opening. 
Close one eye and hold the red glass close before the 
other eye, so that the red image can be seen. Then look 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  VISUAL TESTS AND DEFECTS 35 
  with both eyes at the flame and notice the location of the 
red image. Does it coincide with the yellow flame? If 
not, record its position in terms of the circles and radii of 
the chart. Shift the glass to the other eye and again 
record the position of the red image. If the eyes are in 
perfect balance the two images should coincide. If not, 
the degree and nature of the deviation will be indicated by 
the distance and direction of the red image from the 
yellow flame. 
4. Color-blindness. Take the three standard colors, 
labelled A, B, and C, of Holmgren’s worsteds and place 
them on the table a foot or more apart. Select from the 
other worsteds all those which are like or similar to each 
of the three standards. Arrange the colors in each group 
in the order of their brightness. Do this as quickly as 
you can. Record the time required and the order of the 
worsteds by writing down their numbers in the order in. 
which you arranged them. 
Defective color vision will be indicated by the long time 
required to arrange the worsteds and by the confusion 
of the colors.: The grouping of the worsteds is correct if 
they are arranged in the order in which they are num- 
bered. Red-green blindness, the most common form, 
will be revealed by the confusion of the red and the green 
yarns. 
Discuss the following questions: 
1. What use may a teacher make of the knowledge of 
the visual defects of individual pupils? 
2. How may she assist such pupils?

  CHAPTER VI 
AUDITORY TESTS AND DEFECTS 
TuE school is concerned with two auditory problems, 
acuity of hearing and discrimination of pitch. The former 
is of interest to every teacher, the latter is of importance 
primarily to the teacher of music. ; ; 
1. Acuity of Hearing. The problem is to determine 
whether an individual’s hearing is normal or whether 
there is any degree of deafness present in either or 
both ears. Several forms of tests will be used. 
a. The Watch Test. Perform the experiment in a quiet 
room. The subject is seated on a chair. Fasten the zero 
end of a tape measure to the back of the chair just behind 
the ear to be tested. The other ear should be closed with 
cotton. Hold the watch so that it can be heard readily. 
Then gradually move it outward along the aural axis 
(the line passing through the two ears) until it can no 
longer be heard. Hold the tape with the other hand and 
measure the distance of the watch from the ear. Then 
begin from a position where it can not be heard and move 
it toward the ear. As soon as it can be heard, stop and 
measure the distance. Always hold the watch in the same 
37
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
way with the same side toward the ear. Move it at the 
rate of about one inch per second. Make five “in” and 
five “out” measurements for each ear in the double fatigue 
order, that is, three on the first ear, five on the second, 
and two more on the first. Average the results for each 
ear separately. 
The advantages of this test are that it is simple, con- 
venient, and sufficiently accurate for crude measurements. 
Its disadvantages are that watches differ and that the 
sound is rhythmic, which is apt to deceive the listener 
into hearing the ticking when he actually does not. In 
order to make the records of different persons compara- 
ble, the same watch should be used.! 
b. Seashore’s Audiometer. This is an accurate, con- 
venient instrument, and on the whole the best for measur- 
ing acuity of hearing? 
Adjust the strength of the electric current by means of 
the resistance plugs and the galvanometer until the needle 
of the latter rests on the central cross bar. Connect the 
receiver with the audiometer and mount it on a tripod 
in another room. The subject is seated so that the ear 
*The Politzer acoumeter may be used in exactly the same 
manner as the watch. The sound in this instrument is produced by 
a small metallic hammer. It is superior to the watch in that the 
stimuli are uniform and can be produced at will. 
* A description of this apparatus may be found in the Univ. of 
Iowa Studies in Psych., 1898, II., 158-163. It consists essentially 
of a series of induction coils by which the stimulus can be varied 
from very weak to moderately strong intensities. The instrument 
can be obtained from C. H. Stoelting Co., 3037 Carroll Avenue, 
Chicago.
-P-A-G-E-49
  AUDITORY TESTS AND DEFECTS 39 
can be held as close as possible to. the receiver without 
touching it. A key and telegraph sounder should be 
set up, the former being placed in the hands of the subject 
and the latter in the room with the audiometer. The 
subject responds on this key whenever he hears the stim- 
ulus from the receiver. 
The sliding key on the audiometer is for the purpose 
of changing the intensity of the stimulus. To make the 
measurements, begin with a sound which can easily be 
heard. Diminish the intensity of the stimulus step by 
step until the subject no longer responds. Give the stimuli 
at irregular intervals of from three to six seconds, so that 
the subject may not tend to respond rhythmically. 
Record the last sound heard. Begin several units below 
this point and increase the intensity of the stimuli until 
the subject again responds. Record the first one heard. 
In this manner make five measurements on each ear in 
the double fatigue order. Average the results. Compare 
them with the watch test. Is the acuity of the two ears 
the same? 
c. The Whisper Test. This test may be omitted, but it 
is introduced here because it is often a serviceable method 
in the school-room. The pupil is stationed at a distance 
of fifteen or twenty feet from the examiner with one ear 
.toward him. Then a series of twenty-five words, prefer- 
ably numbers, are spoken in a whispered voice. After 
each word the child writes down what he heard. Ten or 
twelve pupils may easily be tested at one time. Then 
the pupil turns so that the other ear is toward the exam-  
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
iner and the test is repeated. After the test, the pupil’s 
list is compared with the examiner’s list, and the per- 
centage of errors determined. It requires some practice 
on the part of the examiner to whisper the words fairly 
uniformly. The results are entirely relative, and different 
pupils must be compared with one another. The pupil 
who has considerably more than the average percentage 
of errors should receive medical attention. The one great 
advantage of the whisper experiment is that it tests 
hearing of conversational speech, which is not the case 
when mechanical stimuli are used. 
2. Discrimination of Pitch. One of the essentials for 
musical training is the capacity to make fine discrimina- 
tions of pitch. A convenient and accurate method of 
testing musical discrimination is afforded by a series of 
eleven graded tuning-forks! which range in pitch from 
435 vibrations (the standard) to 465 vibrations. The 
forks between these limits are graded in the following 
order, each being so many vibrations higher than the 
standard: \, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 17, 23, 30- 
Mount a speaking-tube so that the subject may hold 
one end of it to his ear. The experimenter holds the 
1 This series can be prepared from a set of A forks whose prongs 
are approximately three and a half inches long. They can be ob- 
tained through any music dealer. One of the forks is selected as 
standard and the others are tuned according to the required interval 
above the standard by filing the ends of the prongs until they have 
the desired pitch. They can be tuned accurately by comparing each 
fork with the standard and with one another and counting the beats. 
This method of testing was first devised by Seashore. See Univ. of 
Iowa Studies in Psych., II., 55-64. Sets of these forks properly 
tuned may be obtained from C. H. Stoelting Company, 3037 Carroll 
Avenue, Chicago.
-P-A-G-E-51
   
     41 
  AUDITORY TESTS AND DEFECTS 
vibrating forks at the other end of the tube. If no speak- 
ing tube is at hand, the forks may be held close to the ear. 
Or, better, roll a sheet of paper to make a tube an inch 
in diameter and hold that to the ear. The stimuli can 
thus be given more uniformly than by holding the forks 
to the ear. 
The experimenter strikes the standard and the highest 
fork and holds them in rapid succession before the tube. 
They should be struck as uniformly as possible and held to 
the tube not longer than two or three seconds, with as 
short an interval between the two forks to be compared 
as possible. The subject indicates whether the second is 
higher or lower than the first. If the answer is correct the 
standard and the twenty-three fork are compared in the 
same manner. If that judgment is correct, the standard 
and the seventeen fork are taken, and so on until the 
subject makes a mistake. Then, with these two forks, 
make twenty trials and record each judgment as right or 
wrong. If less than seventy per cent. of the answers are 
correct, make twenty trials with the standard and the 
fork next above the one just used. If more than eighty 
per cent. are correct, make twenty trials with the standard 
and the fork next below the one used. The two forks 
with which approximately seventy-five per cent. of the 
answers are correct may then be regarded as the measure 
of the threshold of pitch discrimination. An average is 
difficult to give because individuals differ greatly in this 
respect. For university students the average is between 
five and eight vibrations.

MENTAL IMAGES 
TuE problem is to determine the relative predomi- 
nance of the different types of mental images.1 
1. The Frequency of Different Classes of Mental 
Images. Determine this by the association method in the 
following manner. The material to be used consists of 
the columns of words printed below. Cover with a piece. 
of paper all the words except the first column. With 
another piece of paper cover this column also. Slide it 
down far enough to expose the first word. Then in a 
short sentence write in your notebook an answer to this 
question, ‘‘ What do you think of as soon as you see that 
word?” For example, if the word is “ grass,” it might 
suggest at once imagery of this kind, “I think at once of 
the green appearance of a meadow.” Or, if the word is 
“shoe,” it might suggest such an answer as this, “I 
think of the pinching of my new shoe.’”’ Do not try to 
make a selection, but write down whatever comes to your 
mind first. Write your answer quickly and proceed to

mental images. Some standard text on psychology may be consulted,

  the next word by sliding the paper down to expose it. 
Answer the same question with regard to this word. 
Similarly, work through the entire list of words. Num- 
ber your answers. Keep all the columns covered except 
the one you are using. The purpose of this is to avoid 
as far as possible the associations with other words except 
the one before you.

40 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
“ This is a distinct exercise in introspection. It is best 
to keep the eyes closed as you introspect. If the observer 
does not have strong imagery he may be lost in the effort 
to create an image out of the retinal light. To avoid this, 
it is best to think of the object as in a distant place; for 
example, the rose on the bush. 
“Sometimes the image comes in the most realistic way 
when it comes without effort as a sort of a reverie image 
which passes the mental horizon. As a rule, it is best not 
to direct the attention primarily to the detail of the image, 
but rather to the effort to recall the fact; when the fact 
comes into consciousness the character of the image may 
be observed. 
“ Fix clearly in mind and use as consistently as possible 
the following scale of degrees of vividness: 
. No image at all. 
. Very faint. 
. Faint. 
. Fairly vivid. 
. Vivid. 
. Very vivid. 
. As vivid as in perception. 
“ Answer the following questions by writing after the 
number of the question the number which denotes the 
degree of vividness characteristic of your image. Instead 
of taking the questions in the order given, follow the order:

visual imagery be a distinct advantage? Motor imagery? 
2. What advantage might there be for a teacher to 
know what her dominant class of imagery is? If a

CHAPTER VIII 
THE TRIAL AND ERROR METHOD OF LEARNING 
  Types of Methods. There are three methods by which 
the doing of a definite act may be learned. 
a. By trial and error, that is, by making random 
attempts until by chance some attempts are successful. 
b. By imitation, that is, by observing the performance 
of the act and then attempting to copy it. 
c. By reasoning, that is, by attempting to think it out 
and then proceeding accordingly. 
The most fundamental of these is the trial and error 
method. The acquisition of all motor control is accom- 
plished primarily by this method. The others serve only 
as supplementary aids. For example, in learning to strike 
a ball with a bat the boy begins by attempting to strike it. 
He will probably not even succeed in touching it until 
after several attempts, when the ball and bat happen to 
meet. As he continues, the successful trials become more 
and more frequent, while the failures gradually diminish. 
Learning to strike the ball may possibly be facilitated 
by observing and imitating an expert batter, but the 
attempt to reason as to how to strike would probably be 
of little or no assistance in this particular case. 
The Problem of the Experiment is to demonstrate the 
trial and error method of learning, its nature and sig- 
nificance in learning to codérdinate perceptual and motor 
factors. To show this satisfactorily it is necessary to 
51
-P-A-G-E-62
52 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
  test the process of learning a relatively new and undevel- 
oped act. For this purpose we shall use mirror writing. 
This consists essentially in the establishment of a new 
connection between hand movements and the visual per- 
ception of these movements as seen in a mirror. 
Material and Apparatus. Prepare the following material 
for the experiment: Lay a piece of cardboard back of 
Fig. 4. Prick through the page with a pin at the apexes 
of the twelve angles of the star outline. Connect these 
points with straight lines and then trim the card to pro- 
duce a six-pointed star pattern. Lay the pattern on a 
sheet of paper and trace a line around it, making an out- 
line like Fig. 4. Insert the arrow and cross line in their 
appropriate places. Draw eleven such outlines, each on 
a separate sheet of paper.! 
Set a mirror on the table about eighteen inches ir 
you and facing toward you. Set it in a vertical position 
and at right angles to your median plane. The mirror 
must be at least six by six inches. It may be held in 
position by means of books or other convenient objects 
placed against it. The face of the mirror, however, must 
be left free. 
Procedure. Lay one of the star outlines on the table 
1In order to economize time, it is well to have a rubber stamp 
made by means of which the patterns may be prepared quickly. A 
simple and convenient apparatus for holding the mirror and for 
shielding the hand in tracing from direct view has been devised by 
Professor W. F. Dearborn and described in the Journal of Educa- 
tional Psychology, I, 374. The use of this apparatus is of distinct 
advantage in carrying out the experiment.

  just in front of the mirror so that the arrow is nearest 
the mirror. Fasten the sheet to the table with two pins. 
By means of a pencil trace with the left hand just one-half 
  Fic. 4. 
of this outline. Begin at the crossbar and go in the 
direction in which the arrow points. Record on this 
outline the exact time in seconds which it took to trace 
this half. Also label it properly as being the first half 
done with the left hand. Lay this sheet aside. Then trace 
with the right hand the remaining ten outlines, doing each 
one completely. Number them in the order in which 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
54 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
you do them. Record on each the time required to do 
the tracing of that particular outline. 
Observe your hand only in the mirror. Never observe 
it directly. To guard against this a piece of cardboard 
can easily be clamped to a tripod to intercept the direct 
view. Follow the line as closely as possible. As soon as 
you notice that the pencil is beside the line, attempt to 
get back. In doing this, do not lift the pencil from the 
paper. The first tracing will usually be difficult. It is 
therefore important to persist. 
Results. Construct a table to show (a) the time in 
seconds required for each tracing, and (b) the number of 
errors made in each tracing. By an error is meant a 
correcting movement as shown in Fig. 5. Each attempt 
to return to the line, whether successful or not, is counted 
as an error. Plot the results in two curves, placing the

          THE TRIAL AND ERROR METHOD OF LEARNING 55 
number of trials on the horizontal line and the time and 
errors on the vertical line. See Fig. 6. 
Discuss the following points: 
1. Examine the two or three places in your first tracing 
      which were especially difficul 
where a large number of random movements were made in 
all directions. Did you find in these difficult places that 
the determination to move in a certain desired direction 
resulted in movement in that direction? Or, did you find , such as are shown in Fig. 5, 
that you were about as apt to go in some other direction ? 
The experiment shows that you learn to trace the line 
by the “try, try again” method. Thinking, or making 
up your mind to move here or there gives little or no 
assistance.
-P-A-G-E-66
56 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
2. Did you notice any feeling of pleasure or satisfaction 
wher you were successful in returning to the line? If so, 
in what way would that help in the later records? 
3- In what respect is your process of learning in this 
experiment similar to a child’s learning to write? 
4. Is the latter more difficult for the child than the 
former is for you? If so, why? 
The importance of the method of trial and error in the 
development of the motor life of the child is exceedingly 
great. We can realize its significance only when we 
remember that all of the activities which involve muscular 
coérdination are acquired by this method. It is in this 
manner, for example, that the child learns to reach suc- 
cessfully for an object before him. Many random attempts 
to reach are made until the hand grasps the object. 
He learns to walk, to control his head, to move the arms 
and fingers in desired ways largely by trial and error. Of 
course, for many of these activities there are instinctive 
tendencies, but these are for the most part indefinite and 
often consist of little more than a great abundance of 
impulses to act. 
It seems, therefore, important that the teacher should 
know the nature and meaning of the trial and error method, 
that she should realize its fundamental importance in the 
development of child life, that she should understand what 
school exercises are learned wholly or largely by this 
method and which can be acquired more quickly by stim- 
ulating other modes of learning, and that she should 
appreciate something of the difficulty in acquiring accu-

rate muscular control such as is involved in, for example, 
learning to write.

theoretical bearings of this mode of learning the following 
references may be consulted: Kirkpatrick, Fundamentals 
of Child Study, pp. 81-86. O’Shea, Dynamic Factors 
in Education, pp. 110-121. Bagley, The Educative

CHAPTER IX 
THE PROGRESS OF LEARNING 
1. Rate of Improvement 
The Problem is to determine (a) the general rate of 
improvement, (b) whether improvement progresses at a 
uniform rate from beginning to end, and if not, when it 
is most rapid and when least rapid, (c) whether there 
are periods of improvement and retardation, and (d) the 
effect of a long interval of rest. 
For the investigation of these problems the type of 
learning begun in the last experiment will be continued. 
It is well adapted to this purpose for the reason that a 
considerable amount of improvement can be accomplished 
in a relatively short period of time and for the reason that 
considerable practice has already been attained in it. 
Material. Prepare twenty-five star outlines as directed 
in the last chapter. 
Procedure. Continue the mirror tracing exactly as 
directed before. Try to improve as rapidly as you can, 
both in the time and accuracy of tracing. In order to 
avoid the disturbing effect of fatigue it is well to alternate 
the preparation of the outlines with the tracing. For 
example, prepare five outlines, then trace five, etc. Num- 
ber the tracings in the order in which you do them. 
Record on each the exact time required to trace it. After 
all the tracings are done return to the one begun with the 
left hand and finish the remaining half. 
58
-P-A-G-E-69
THE PROGRESS OF LEARNING 59 
  Results. Construct a table showing the time and errors 
of each record. Plot curves from these data, making them 
continuous with the curves drawn of the ten records made 
in the preceding chapter. Indicate the points of junction 
by short cross lines. Calculate the percentage of improve- 
ment, comparing the last right-hand tracing with the first. 
This may be done by taking the difference in seconds be- 
tween the first and the last tracing and by computing the 
percentage of this difference on the time of the first tracing 
asa base. The improvement in errors is computed in the 
same manner. Make the same computations for the 
two left-hand tracings. 
State your conclusions, and in connection with these 
discuss the following points : 
1. Which part of the curve shows the most rapid im- 
provement? Would you expect, to find the same fact in 
all forms of learning ? 
2. Is there any indication of periods of more rapid 
improvement followed by periods of little or no improve- 
ment, or possibly even loss? What explanation can you 
suggest ? 
If no distinct periods or 
it is probably due to the fact that the practice has not “plateaus ”’ are recognizable, 
been continued long enough. These “ plateaus ” can 
be seen in Fig. 6, which represents one hundred tracings 
made at the rate of one a day for one hundred consec- 
utive days. 
3. Does the time curve show improvement at the same 
or at different periods from the error curve? For example,
-P-A-G-E-70
60 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
in Fig. 6 the two curves show parallel improvement during 
the first rapid period of learning. After that the error 
curve continues to improve, while the time curve actually 
shows a loss until the former has reached its “‘ dead level,” 
after which the time curve begins to drop again. This 
would indicate that a plateau shows lack of improvement 
only in the particular phase of the learning process repre- 
sented by that particular curve, and that there is more 
rapid development in some other phase of the process. 
4. Examine the individual records to see whether im- 
provement in time is more frequently accompanied by 
little or no improvement in errors than by distinct reduc- 
tion of errors. 
5. What is the effect of the long interval between the 
tenth and eleventh records, that is, the last record of the 
preceding chapter and the first of this one? 
6. Compare the improvement of the left hand with the 
right hand. How do you explain it? What significance 
might this have for the spread of practice? 
  2. Factors Affecting the Rate of Learning. Selecting 
the Successful Trials 
Problem. The progress of learning depends largely 
upon the selection of the successful acts and the corre- 
sponding diminution of the random and unsuccessful acts. 
Whatever factors condition the emphasis and selection of 
the successful trials promote the rapidity of learning. 
The problem of this experiment is to determine the 
effect of selecting the successful acts. For this purpose
-P-A-G-E-71
  THE PROGRESS OF LEARNING 61 
we shall compare a process of practice in which such selec- 
tion is present, with practice from which it is abseut. 
Material. Several sheets of paper and a pencil. 
Procedure. Close your eyes and draw with the right 
hand twenty-five circles approximately two centimetres 
in diameter. The arm should not rest upon the table, 
but should be supported entirely from the shoulder. The 
aim in drawing is to make complete circles. Attempt to 
stop as nearly as possible at the point from which you 
started. The distance between these two points will be 
considered the error. Draw slowly and carefully, taking 
from five to ten seconds for each circle. Make the circles 
in rows either across the page or down the page, in order 
that you may know later the exact order in which they 
were drawn. It is important to keep the eyes closed during 
the entire task. After you have drawn the last circle 
turn over your sheet and lay it aside, before you open 
your eyes. 
On the next sheet draw another series of twenty-five 
circles. In this series open your eyes between the con- 
secutive drawings, to see the circle just drawn, but keep 
the eyes closed while the circles are being drawn. It is 
important to draw slowly and carefully. 
Results. Measure the error in each circle by measuring 
in millimetres the distance between the beginning point 
and the ending point. Construct separate tables for the 
two series. Average the errors by groups of fives as shown 
in Table III. From these averages plot curves as shown 
in Fig. 7 and designate them as series I and II,

CHAPTER X 
THE PROGRESS OF LEARNING (ContinvED) 
  Problem. In the experiments performed thus far the 
learning process consisted mainly in the formation of 
motor and perceptual coérdinations. In the following 
experiment the learning will consist in the establishment 
of associations between two classes of visual symbols, 
both of which are perfectly familiar in themselves. The 
motor codérdinations to express these symbols are also 
well established. 
The specific problems are (a) to study the progress of 
learning in this new field and to compare it with the pre- 
ceding type, (b) to find further factors which influence 
the rapidity of learning, such as the length of different 
periods of work and of different periods of rest, mental 
and physical conditions, etc. Incidentally we shall also 
obtain data on the transference of training, which will 
be used later. 
The Material is supplied in the following pages. It 
consists of sets of pages headed with an imitation type-

  writer key-board.! Each letter of the alphabet is enclosed 
with a number in a circle. Below this “ key-board ” is 
the reading matter which is to be transcribed. This read- 
ing matter is different on the various pages. 
Procedure. The task of the experiment consists in 
substituting the numbers for the letters in the spaces 
below. In order to obtain data in regard to the influence 
of intervals and lengths of work periods, it is necessary 
to divide the class into three equal groups.? One group 
should work for ten minutes at a time twice a day with an 
interval of at least five hours between the two periods. 
The second group should work for twenty minutes once 
a day, and the third group should work for forty minutes 
every other day. Each person should continue the work 
for six days. The group working every other day should 
work on the first, third, and fifth day. The total time 
in each group will be 120 minutes. The periods of work 
should be as nearly as possible at the same time of the 
day. Record in the proper places in the margin the date 
and time of day. No effort should be made during the 
intervening intervals to memorize the numbers and their 
letters. Do not leave blank spaces between the words 
in making the substitutions. Begin a new line for each 
line of print, always using the line of spaces opposite the 
line of print. In case of those letters for which two digits 
must be written, for example 18, both digits should be

ago by Jastrow. 
? Each group should contain at least ten persons. If the class is 
small it had better be divided into two groups only.

placed in one square. Work as rapidly as you can with- 
out making errors. Do not stop to correct errors if you 
make any. Have a watch on the table before you and 
make a check mark at the end of every five minutes. In 
order that this may be done with as little disturbance as 
possible, begin work when the minute hand is on a num- 
ber. After each period of work record any observations 
that may bear upon the experiment. Note your general 
mental and physical condition. Note in particular during 
the course of the learning (a) the time when you know 
the first numbers without consulting the key-board, (b) 
the time when the first complete words can be written 
without consulting the key-board, and (c) the time when 
you know all or practically all substitutions.

In order to obtain data on the transference of practice, 
perform the following test before undertaking the above 
learning. Substitute as quickly as you can the symbols 
for the numbers on page 50. Record the exact length 
of time required to do this. After completing the reg- 
ular substitution experiment repeat the same test using 
the material on page 68. Record the time. Preserve 
these “before” and “after” tests for use in a later 
chapter.

The baseline represents from left to right the successive 
five-minute periods. The vertical distances represent the 
number of substitutions made in each five-minute period. 
The ten-minute curve is an average curve of twelve persons 
working ten minutes at a time, twicea day. The twenty- 
minute curve is an average of fourteen records, and the 
forty-minute curve is an average of nine records working 
according to their respective distributions of time. 
Results. Count the number of substitutions made 
during each five-minute period. Construct a table show- 
ing in different columns the date and time of day, the 
number of substitutions for each five-minute period, and 
brief introspective comments. Plot a curve in which the 
five-minute periods are represented on the horizontal line

and the number of substitutions on the vertical line. See 
Fig. 8. 
State your conclusions and discuss the following points : 
1. Compare your curve with the curve obtained on the 
basis of the mirror tracings, particularly with regard to 
the rate of learning, rapid improvement at first and slower 
progress after that. 
2. Does the present curve reveal any plateaus? How 
many? 
3. Can you trace any connection between these stages 
and your introspective notes? For instance, between your 
general physical and mental condition and retardation 
or rapid learning. If your curve has distinct stages, notice 
particularly whether these coincide with the times, for 
example, when you first knew all the substitutions, or 
when you were able to write complete words and phrases 
without consulting the key-board. 
4. What significance do the plateaus have in the learn- 
ing process? ; 
5. Compare your own curve in regard to rate of im- 
provement, amount done, plateaus and the like, with the 
curve in Fig. 8 which represents the same distribution of 
time as yours.

THE TRANSFERENCE OF TRAINING 
Problem. The object of this experiment is to determine 
(a) to what extent, if at all, special training in one mental 
function improves other mental functions, and (b) to find 
some of the factors in such transference. . 
The Material for this experiment is supplied on the 
following pages. Do not read or examine any of it until 
you are ready to use it, and then concern yourself only 
with that portion of it which you are about to use. In 
order to insure this condition, cover with a sheet of paper 
all material which is not used at the time. 
Procedure. The usual method of determining by experi- 
ment the transference of training is to test a variety of 
mental functions, then to undertake a long course of train- 
ing in one specific direction and finally to test again the 
same functions as were tested before the training. The 
  1The problems involved in the transference of training are 
usually discussed in educational literature under the heading of 
formal discipline, which is the doctrine that the mental discipline 
gained in the pursuance of school studies improves one’s ability to 
perform other activities.

-P-A-G-E-99
THE TRANSFERENCE OF TRAINING 89 
long practice course is called the training series, and the 
short tests performed before and after the practice are 
called the test series, or end tests. 
In this experiment the test series consists of: 
  a. A test of immediate auditory memory. 
“bp. Learning French vocabulary. 
c. Memorizing a group of ten syllables. 
d. Memorizing a stanza of poetry. 
The training series consists in learning Italian vocab- 
ulary. 
Proceed as follows: 
a. The span of immediate auditory memory is to be 
tested in the same manner as in Chapter I, except that 
the following groups of letters are to be used instead of 
words. These groups should be read to the class at the 
rate of one letter per second, reading one group at a time 
and presenting the groups in order of size, from the small- 
est to the largest. After a group has been read the class 
writes down immediately all the letters remembered of 
that group and in the order in which they were presented.

b. Look through the list of French words below to 
see if you already know any of the words. Strike out those 
you know and enough others to leave only ten words. 
If none are familiar strike out the last five words. Then 
learn the English equivalents of these ten. Record the 
exact time in minutes and seconds required for the learn- 
ing. Consider them learned as soon as you are able to 
give the English equivalents upon seeing the French words. 
Have a piece of paper at hand to cover the English words 
to find out whether you are able to do this.

From rocky cleft the torrent dashes; 
Down, down he comes with thunder-shock; 
The sturdy oak beneath him crashes, 
And after rolls the loosened rock. 
Amazed, o’erjoyed, with awe and wonder 
The traveller stops and gazes round; 
He hears the all-pervading thunder, 
But cannot tell from whence the sound. 
c. Memorize the ten syllables below so that you are 
able to repeat them from memory in the correct order. 
Record the time.

The training series consists of 180 Italian words and 
their English equivalents. They are divided into six 
groups of thirty words each. You are to learn the English 
equivalents in the same manner as the French vocabulary. 
Memorize one group a day. Record the time. Do the 
learning as nearly as possible at the same time of the 
day on six successive days. After the completion of this 
practice, repeat the tests performed before the training, 
using, however, the new material provided on later pages.

c. Stanza of poetry. 
And, as the boy, with hopeless longing— 
When stolen freedom yields no rest, 
But home-thoughts to his heart keep thronging— 
Flies to his injured mother’s breast; 
So Music has the power to charm us, 
When turned from Nature’s simple truth; 
From cold and foreign ways to warn us 
With the old feelings of our youth.

Results. Construct a table similar to Table VII, show- 
ing the learning times of the different groups of the train- 
ing series, and of the different test series. Calculate the 
percentage of improvement in the training series by com- 
paring the last day’s record with the first day’s record. 
Find the difference between these two records and calculate . 
‘the percentage of this difference on the basis of the first 
record. Similarly, calculate the percentage of difference be- 
tween the tests after the training and before the training.

The improvement in the second end tests is not entirely 
due to transference from the training series, but is due 
in a small measure to the benefit derived from the first 
end tests. This is shown by performing the end tests 
on a group of individuals with an interval of one week 
oetween the two tests and without taking the training 
tests. A test performed in this manner with eleven 
individuals showed an average improvement of 5 per cent. 
in learning French vocabulary and of 10 per cent. in 
learning poetry, and with twenty-eight subjects the im- 
provement in learning syllables was 2 per cent. These 
percentages must be subtracted from the improvement 
in the regular experiment in order to obtain the amount 
of improvement due to transference. 
Turn to the experiment in Chapter VII and compute 
the percentage of improvement in the end tests, namely 
in the substitution of symbols for numbers. Find also 
the percentage of improvement in the training series itself 
and compare it with the improvement in the end tests. 
Twenty-nine persons doing the end tests without the train- 
ing series showed a gain of 4 per cent., which must be 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
THE TRANSFERENCE OF TRAINING IOI 
deducted from the percentage of improvement shown by 
the subjects who took the training series. Compare the 
average gain, Table VII, with the average gain in the train- 
ing series, Fig. 8. How much greater is the gain in the 
training series than in the end tests? 
Turn to Chapter IX and calculate the percentage of 
gain in time and errors in the two tracings made with 
the left hand. Compare this with the improvement in the 
practice of the right hand.!_ The records of twelve sub- 
jects showed that the left hand made 90 per cent. as much 
improvement as the right hand.* 
Questions : 
1. Which experiments in the end tests are most like 
and which least like the training series? Which show the 
largest amount of improvement? What general principle 
would you formulate? 
2. In general how much improvement is transferred ? 
To answer this question definitely, compare the amount 
of gain in the end tests as given in the averages, Table VIII, 
with the average gain in the training series, Table IX. 
Deduct from the averages in Table VIII the amounts due 
to the practice in the end tests themselves as indicated 
on the preceding page. How do these residual improve- 
ments compare with the gain in the training series, Table 
IX? What inference do you make with regard to the 
amount of training that is transferred ? 
1This type of transference of practice of one organ of the body 
to its bilaterally symmetrical organ is called cross-education. Its 
bearing upon the whole problem of transference among mental 
functions is only indirect.

3. In the light of your results discuss this statement : 
“ A change in one function alters any other only in so far 
as the two functions have as factors identical elements.” 
(Thorndike, Educational Psychology, First Edition, p. 80.) 
4. What bearing have these experimental results upon 
the question of mental discipline of school studies? Would 
training derived from one study help in the pursuit of 
others? If so, to what extent? 
For further practical exercises see Thorndike, Prin- 
ciples of Teaching, 249-256; O’Shea, Education as Ad- 
justment, Chapters 13 and 14.

CHAPTER XII 
ASSOCIATION 
1. The General Law of Association 
TuE law of association simply stated is this, Things! 
experienced together tend to recur together. The appli- 
cations of this law to teaching are very obvious and very 
wide. Theymay besummed up under two principles, “ Put 
together what you wish to have go together,” and “‘ Re- 
ward good impulses.” ? 
The force of the law of association may be demonstrated 
very simply in this manner: Find the number of seconds 
required to repeat the alphabet as quickly as possible. 
Next find the time required to repeat the alphabet back- 
wards. Explain the difference. 
In the next experiment commit to memory the seven 
Spanish words printed below in Group I. While doing 
this keep the English equivalents covered with a piece of 
paper. Always repeat the words in order from the top 
of the column. Then cover the Spanish list and memorize 
the English words in their order. After you have learned 
both lists lay the book aside and find the time it will

take you to recall from memory the Spanish words in 
their order and the correct English equivalent of each. 
While you are learning do not compare the two lists. 
Memorize the words in the second group, but in this 
case read the Spanish word and the English equivalent 
together. As soon as you know them, lay the book aside 
and find the time required to recall the foreign words and 
their meanings. Explain the difference in time between 
the recalling of the two groups.

Problem. The object is to demonstrate the laws accord- 
ing to which ideas or mental states are associated. Why 
does a given idéa bring to mind a certain idea rather than 
some other? For example, why does “ December 25th ” 
bring to mind “Christmas” rather than ‘“ President 
Johnson’s proclamation of pardon”? What determines 
which one of a score of possible connections shall be made?

The Material is supplied on the following ten pages. 
It is imperative that you should not examine it except 
under strict experimental conditions. Therefore, do not 
turn to it until you are ready to do the experiment. The 
material is composed of syllables and numbers. Each 
series is composed of ten pairs of syllables and numbers 
printed side by side. Take a sheet of paper, at least 
twelve centimetres square, and cut crosswise in the centre 
of it a rectangular aperture, 5 mm. by 4cm. This will 
serve as a simple means of exposing the pairs of syllables 
and numbers for uniform intervals of time. 
Procedure. Turn to Series I and immediately lay the 
sheet of paper over the page so that the aperture exposes 
nothing but the words “‘ Series I.” Each pair in the series 
is to be exposed for three seconds. The time is indicated 
by your partner, who taps on the table every three sec- 
onds. Take hold of the sheet of paper with the right hand 
and at the first tap slide it down to expose the first pair, 
at the next tap slide it down to expose the second pair, 
and so on through the entire series. Give your entire 
attention to the particular pair exposed. Pronounce to 
yourself both the syllable and the number. As soon as 
you have finished, slide the sheet of paper down and 
expose the set of syllables (test series) on the lower 
half of the page. Be sure, however, not to uncover any 
part of the upper series (stimulus series). These syllables 
are the same ones used in the stimulus series, but they 
are arranged in different order. Your partner again taps 
at intervals of three seconds. Begin at the top and write
-P-A-G-E-120
IIO0 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
opposite each syllable the number that comes to your 
mind as the one seen with it in the stimulus series. Pass 
to the next syllable at the next tap, and so on. If no 
number is recalled leave the space blank. Work through 
the other nine series in exactly the same manner. Allow 
an interval of at least two minutes between the successive 
series. Before working out the results your partner 
should go through the experiment also.

Results. The purpose of the experiment is to demon- 
strate the four laws of association. 
a. Primacy. Other things being equal, the first asso- 
ciation is most apt to be recalled. 
b. Frequency. Other things being equal, the most fre- 
quent association is most apt to be recalled. This is 
illustrated in series 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, in which one syllable 
occurs twice with the same number. 
c. Intensity. Other things being equal, the most in- 
tense or most vivid association is most apt to be recalled. 
This is illustrated in series 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, in which one 
pair is printed in much larger type. 
d. Recency. Other things being equal, the most recent 
association is most apt to be recalled. Primacy and recency 
are illustrated in each series by the first and last pairs. 
Construct a table to show the number and percentage 
of correct associations. Follow Table VII as model. 
The results of Series I or any other series should not be 
counted if they were vitiated by incorrect performance 
of the experiment.

Questions: 
1. Give several illustrations from your own experience 
in school in which the laws of association were applied 
correctly. Several in which they were applied incorrectly. 
2. How would the laws of association apply to the 
learning of correct grammatical forms? Spelling? Para- 
digms? Dates of history? 
For a very excellent list of questions and specific exer- 
cises, see Thorndike, Principles of Teaching, pp. 112-123.

CHAPTER XIII 
APPERCEPTION 
  APPERCEPTION is the “ manner in which we receive a 
thing into our minds ” (James). It includes all the pro- 
cesses by which we read meaning into sense impressions. 
One person calls an object a useless stone; another calls 
it a fossil of the carboniferous age. The two persons re- 
ceive the object differently, they give different meanings 
to the same sense impressions. Each gives that particular 
interpretation which is most in accord with his particular 
mental make-up. 
The General Problem of the experiments in this chapter 
is to illustrate the facts of apperception, that the mind 
always endeavors to give some meaning to every incoming 
impression, whether new or old, and to find some factors 
which determine what meaning shall be given to a par- 
ticular impression. 
1. To demonstrate the meaning tendency of the mind. 
a. Turn to the ten ink blots and write into your note- 
book the first thing that each one suggests or represents 
to you, that is, the first meaning which naturally comes 
to you as you see each one. Do not study them or try 
to force a meaning into them.

  APPERCEPTION 139 
The experiment clearly demonstrates that the mind 
normally attempts to interpret every sensation. It tries 
to give meaning even to those impressions which are 
entirely without meaning and unlike anything previously 
experienced. The ink blots are in themselves without 
significance, and were not made with the intention of 
representing anything. The meaning you give to each is 
entirely imposed upon it. The mind is persistent in giving 
meaning to its sensations because meaningless things have 
no value or significance. The mental development of a 
child is largely a development of apperception. 
b. Turn to the ten syllables given below. Write in 
your note-book what each one reminds you of or suggests 
to you.

Here again the same fact is illustrated. The mind 
gives meaning even to the meaningless. These three- 
letter syllables do not constitute words or symbols, yet 
each one almost without exception stirs up some associa- 
tion or other and forthwith it has meaning.
-P-A-G-E-150
  140 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
  c. As soon as a meaning has been given to impressions 
they at once become definite according to the particular 
meaning imposed. Find the frogs in Fig. 19, and notice 
  By permission of Century Company. 
Fic. 19. 
that as soon as you have found them the blur springs into 
definite outline. The external stimulus is moulded accord- 
ing to the meaning given. 
d. In the developed adult mind the interpretative ten- 
dency is so dominant that the attention is primarily upon 
the meaning aspect, to the neglect of the actual sense 
stimuli upon which the meaning is based. Only the slight- 
est hint needs to be given to make the mind see this or 
that particular object. The mind, as it were, supplies 
the necessary material to fill out the picture. To demon- 
strate this point, ask an assistant to set the book at a 
distance of twenty or twenty-five feet from you to show 
Fig. 21, on page 130.! Do not look it up yourself, as it is

important that you should not see the figure at close range 
until after the experiment. Make a duplicate freehand 
drawing of the figure thus shown. Put in all the lines and 
details that you see. 
Compare your drawing with the figure in the book. 
Explain the difference. The mind reads meaning into 
sense impressions, supplies details and makes the external 
stimulus conform to the apperceived meaning. Fig. 26, 
on page 183, is a typical sketch drawn under experimental 
conditions. 
2. The particular meaning given to a group of sensa- 
tions is determined by the previous experiences of the 
individual. 
a. Compare your record of the ink-blot test with that of 
one other person. For this purpose make a table num- 
bering in the first column from 1 to 10, in the second col- 
umn place opposite each number the meaning you gave 
to each blot, and in the third the meanings given by the 
other person. 
b. Construct a similar table for the syllable test. In 
addition, state so far as you can why each syllable re- 
minds you of this or that word or object. Obtain similar 
statements from the person whose record you have. 
These introspective statements show, however super- 
ficially, that the same impressions are apperceived differ- 
ently by different persons because of different past 
experiences.

c. The richness of the meaning or completeness of the 
meaning which we give to a sense impression depends 
upon the number and richness of the associations con- 
nected with that sense impression. After each one of the 
following words write the names, or simply a check mark, 
of as many different actual situations or particular ex- 
periences as you can recall, in which each was involved: 
1. Midas; 2. Flatiron Building; 3. Railroad; 4. Tobog- 
gan; 5. Poetry; 6. Psychic Medium; 7. Skeeing; 8. Tel- 
escope; 9. The “L”; 10. Grain Binder. See for 
illustration Table IX. If any word calls up many asso- 
ciations, stop with ten.

present stimuli. This entire system or range of acquired 
experiences is in general equivalent to the range of in- 
formation which a given individual possesses. The total 
bulk of one’s information or experience is sometimes called 
the “ apperceptive mass.” The Australian bushmen call 
a book “ mussel ” because it opens and shuts like a shell- 
fish. Their range of information did not include expe- 
riences with books.

3. The particular meaning given to a group of sensa-

previous experiences but also by the particular system 
of past associations dominant in the mind at the time, 
that is, the meaning is determined by the present setting 
of the mind.

Fill in the missing letters to make words. The number 
and the position of the letters to be supplied are indicated 
by the dashes. Take the groups in the order in which they

the time required for each group. If a skeleton does not 
suggest the missing letters within a reasonably short time, 
say twenty to thirty seconds, leave it blank.

Find the average time required to do Groups I and VI 
and the average time for the other eight groups. How do 
they compare? Explain the difference. 
In each group, except I and VI, a specific system of 
associations is made prominent at the outset; that is, 
the mind is “ set ” in a specific way, with the result that 
(a) the meanings of the skeletons arise much more rapidly 
and (b) they are in accord with the particular set of 
associations present. This point is demonstrated by the 
fact that twenty-two skeletons are alike. Yet in each 
group a different meaning arises according to the set of 
the mind. If you noticed during the experiment that 
any skeleton was like one you had in a preceding group, 
indicate which ones.

foreign phrases the set of the mind is either ‘“‘ French ”

accordingly. The dominant set of associations makes it 
difficult to see or rather to hear the meaning of these 
“ English ” sounds.!

that the sounds are identical, or nearly so with

The principles of apperception have a very important 
application to teaching. First, link new information to 
the information, experiences, and associations which the 
learner already possesses. Second, prepare the proper 
apperceptive basis in the pupil for the reception of new 
material.

problems, see Thorndike, Principles of Teaching, pp.

  CHAPTER XIV 
ATTENTION 
Two of the main problems of attention with which the 
teacher is constantly concerned are: How to secure the 
attention of pupils to the work in hand, and how to hold 
the attention after it has been secured. What are the 
laws of attracting attention, and what are the laws of 
sustaining attention? 
1. Laws of Attracting Attention. These will be stated 
after the experiments have been performed. Proceed 
therefore at once to make the following tests. 
The Material to be used consists of groups of words. 
Each group is to be seen for only five seconds. To insure 
this condition, the material for each experiment is printed 
on a separate leaf, so that only one group can be seen at 
atime. The interval of five seconds is to be indicated by 
your partner, who will tap on the table at the beginning 
and at the end of the interval. Have the book before you 
and be ready to turn the leaf at the first tap. Look at 
the words until your partner taps again. Then turn the 
book over and write into your note-book all the words 
that you remember having noticed. Designate them as 
154

Group I. Do not attempt to memorize any of the words, 
but rather look passively at the whole group. 
In this manner continue the experiment with the re- 
maining eight groups. Have an intermission of at least 
one minute between the successive groups.

Results. The four laws demonstrated above are: 
a. The law of intensity. Other things being equal, the 
amount and degree of attention depends upon the inten- 
sity of the stimulus. Groups I and II contain each 
twenty-five words, of which five are printed in large 
capitals. These will arouse more intense sensations and 
consequently are more apt to be noticed. 
b. The law of contrast. Other things being equal, the 
amount and degree of attention depends upon the con- 
trast of the stimulus with other stimuli. Groups III and 
IV contain each twenty-five words, of which five are 
printed in italics. 
c. The law of clearness or comprehension. Other things 
being equal, the amount and degree of attention depends 
upon the ease of apprehending the impressions, or upon 
the clearness of the impressions. Groups V and VI are 
composed of Greek words with the exception of five 
English words in each group. Because of the familiar 
or clear meaning of the English as compared with the 
Greek words, they are more apt to be noticed and remem- 
bered. We attend with difficulty to the meaningless or 
to the absolutely new.! 
d. The law of counter attractions. Other things being 
equal, the amount and degree of attention depends upon 
the absence of counter attractions. That is, the smaller 
the number of objects is, the greater are the chances 
1A large element in this experiment is the fact that the English 
words will arouse more associations and so will be retained better. 
The results obtained are due partly to the attention factor and 
partly to the association factor.
-P-A-G-E-185
ATTENTION 175 
that a given object will attract attention. In Group VII 
there are only five words, all of which will ordinarily be 
noticed in the allotted time. In Group VIII there are 
ten words, of which usually not more than five will attract 
sufficient attention to be remembered. Hence the chances 
are about one in two that any particular word will be 
noticed. In Group IX, which contains twenty-five words, 
the chances are one in five that any given word will be 
noticed. 
Construct a table like the following one:

1 The word noticed in each case means of course that the words 
attracted sufficient attention to be remembered until they could be 
written down.

2. The Fluctuation or Shifting of the Attention. Our 
attention shifts continuously from moment to moment. 
Even with great effort it is impossible to keep the attention 
focussed for more than a few seconds upon the same idea 
or object. 
a. Look steadily at the central line in the “ book” 
figure below. You will notice that the figure “ flops ” in 
and out. Part of the time it looks like a book open 
toward you, and part of the time like a book with its 
back toward you. Make a two minutes’ record of these 
alternations. At the signal “now” from your partner, 
look steadily at the figure. Do not change your point of 
fixation. When the figure appears like a book open toward

  CHAPTER XV 
MEMORY 
THE practical problem in the field of memory is, How 
may we memorize or learn in the most economic manner? 
A considerable number of principles of economy in learn- 
ing have been established by extensiveinvestigations. The 
experiments that follow will deal with only a few of these 
principles. 
1. Learning in Parts or as a Whole. Is it more eco- 
nomical to memorize a given amount of material piece- 
meal, or as an entirety? For this test the following two 
selections of poetry from Lorenzo’s Laudi Spirituali are 
to be used. 
Memorize selection A part by part, making such divi- 
sions as seem convenient. Consider it memorized as soon 
as you are able to repeat it correctly without looking at 
the book. Record the number of minutes required. In 
both of the following selections work as intensively as you 
can and try to disregard any prejudice that you may have 
as to what the best method of memorizing is. 
182 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  MEMORY 183 
SELECTION A 
O let this wretched life within me die 
That I may live in thee, my life indeed; 
In thee alone, where dwells eternity, 
While hungry multitudes death’s hunger feed. 
I list within, and hark! Death’s stealthy tread! 
I look to thee, and nothing then is dead. 
Then eyes may see a light invisible 
And ears may hear a voice without a sound. 
After a few minutes’ rest, memorize selection B by read- 
ing the entire selection through from beginning to end 
each time. Continue this until you are able to repeat it 
without consulting the text. Work with maximum con- 
centration, as in the first selection. 
SELECTION B 
When, sweet and beauteous Master, on that day, 
Reviewing all my loves with aching heart, 
I take from each its bitter self away, 
The remnant shall be thou, their better part. 
This perfect sweetness be his single store 
Who seeks the good; this faileth nevermore. 
A thirst unquenchable is not beguiled 
By draught on draught of any running river. 
How do the two methods compare? The greater 
economy of the ‘‘ whole ’’ method does not always appear 
in shorter amount of time required for it, but often in the 
greater permanence which is indicated by the shorter
-P-A-G-E-194
      184 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
time necessary to relearn material acquired by the 
“whole” method. To demonstrate this point, find the 
time necessary to relearn the two selections either twenty- 
four or forty-eight hours later.

2. The Effect of Incorrect Repetition. The problem of 
the next experiment is to determine the retarding effect 
of incorrect repetitions upon the speed of learning. 
Obtain a deck of ordinary playing cards. Remove 
from it all the aces, kings, queens, jacks, and tens, leaving 
altogether thirty-two cards. Take eight pieces of paper 
and number them from two to nine. Place these on the 
table before you about six inches apart, in irregular order, 
in the form of a semicircle. Shuffle the cards well. Take 
them into your left hand with their backs turned toward 
you. Then distribute them as rapidly as you can into 
eight piles indicated by the slips of paper. That is, put 
all the fours on one pile beside the slip bearing that num- 
ber, and all the fives on one pile, etc. Try to avoid all 
mistakes. If you discover having made a mistake, do ae

not stop to correct it, as you would lose too much. time 
on account: of it. Record the exact. time required: to.make 
the distribution. In this manner make ten distributions. 
Then have your partner rearrange the eight slips of paper 
in a different: order. Before doing this, write down the 
order in which the slips are placed. Make two. distribu-

several distributions until you shall reach the speed you 
had attained before the two incorrect distributions. Be 
sure that the cards are thoroughly shuffled before each 
distribution. 
Make a table of your results similar to the sample 
records given in Table XVII. 
3. Pauses in Memorizing. The object of the following 
test is to determine the effect of a short pause after learn- 
ing. Use the following lists of words. Your partner will 
read to you each list once, reading at the rate of one word 
per second. Immediately after the first list has been 
read turn to some earlier part of the book and engage 
in rapid reading for thirty seconds. When the thirty 
seconds are over, which will be indicated by your part- 
ner, write down as many words of the list read to you as 
you remember. 
After about two minutes, list two will be read to you. 
But during the thirty seconds following that, you are 
not to work, but to allow your mind to rest or wander 
as it will. However, do not repeat the words that were

read to you. Then write down all the words you remem- 
ber. 
In like manner use the remaining lists of words. The 
odd-numbered lists are to be followed in each case by 
rapid reading for thirty seconds, and the even-numbered 
lists by rest periods of thirty seconds. 
The following lists are to be used upon your partner: 
. Here, want, your, beat, room, gold, time, rock. 
. Rear, moat, walk, hand, tell, heir, pass, mind. 
Fire, like, part, form, will, fear, clad, reef.

Find the average number of words remembered from 
the odd-numbered and the average number remembered 
from the even-numbered lists. 
4. Comprehension and System. The purpose of the 
next two tests is to demonstrate two maxims of memory. 
(a) Understand what you wish to remember, and (b) sys- 
tematize what you wish to remember. 
a. Sense versus Nonsense Material. Things understood 
clearly are remembered more readily. To show this 
experimentally, compare the length of time required to 
learn ten monosyllabic nouns with the time required to 
learn ten nonsense syllables. A list of syllables was 
assigned for memorizing in Chapter VIII, and the results 
of this test may be used for comparison, so that no new 
list needs to be learned. 
Find the time required to learn the following list of ten 
words: 
spade 
moon 
fox 
corn 
road 
town 
mink 
light 
sand 
knife 
Compare the time of this with the time needed for the 
first list of syllables in Chapter VIII. The sense material

at once arouses so many more connections that it is 
remembered much more readily.

method, that is, read the entire list each time. Work as 
intensively as you can.

  CHAPTER XVI 
WORK AND FATIGUE 
Tne object of the experiment in thischapter is to demon- 
strate some means of measuring continuous work, and to 
show the changes and, particularly, the effects of fatigue 
in continuous work. 
1. Mental Work and Fatigue. In order to measure 
mental fatigue, it is necessary to employ a form of test 
which involves the lowest minimum of muscular and 
sensory work. Many such tests have the objection of 
involving considerable muscular activity. For example, 
the cancellation test is largely a test of fatigue of eye 
muscles. The tapping tests likewise are tests mostly of 
muscular fatigue. 
The type of work which has proved most successful 
is some form of arithmetical calculation. In the pres- 
ent experiment the work will consist of mental addi- 
tion. 
Be comfortably seated in a quiet room. Your partner 
will announce to you a number consisting of two digits. 
Add six to this number, then add seven to this new sum, 
and then eight to that, then nine, and then again six, 
193
-P-A-G-E-204
    194 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
seven, eight, and nine in rotation, etc. When the sum 
has reached one hundred or more drop the extreme left 
hand digit and continue with the two remaining digits. 
For example, if the number given you were 80, then your 
consecutive sums would be 80, 86, 93, 101, 10, 16, 23, 31, 
etc. Your partner will announce a new number every 
thirty seconds. In each case add six, seven, eight, and 
nine in rotation to the sum you get after each addition. 
In order to understand thoroughly the conditions of the 
experiment, use for preliminary trials the following two 
numbers which will not occur among the numbers of the 
regular experiment, 40, and 60. 
Close your eyes and add just as rapidly as you can. 
Your partner will give you a new number every thirty 
seconds. Speak your sums aloud so that your partner 
can hear them and follow the columns below, which give 
the correct succession of answers. If you make a mistake 
he will write your number opposite the correct one. At 
the end of every thirty seconds he will make a check mark 
to indicate how many numbers you had added and at 
the same time give you a new number which will be the 
one at the top of the next column. Lose no time when a 
new number is announced, but start at once with it and 
add at your maximum speed until another number is 
given you, and so on.

Now begin with the regular experiment. The numbers 
tobe announced every thirty seconds are the ones at the top 
of the columns. It is absolutely necessary that you should 
work just as hard and as fast as you can. The entire test 
will take thirty minutes, as there are sixty columns.! 
The class should be divided into two groups. One 
should work continuously for thirty minutes, while the 
other should take a rest of two minutes after the first 
fifteen minutes of work. 
1The numbers that are used for ‘starters’ comprise all the 
numbers between 0 and 100 which will not produce sums whose right 
hand digit is 0. All these were omitted because the additions in 
such cases are decidedly easier. 
The columns are long enough so that no one is apt to go beyond any 
one in the allotted thirty seconds. If this should occur your partner 
should make a check mark for every number beyond the column.

  202 EXPERIMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
Construct a curve, similar to the one in Fig. 25, to show 
the number of additions made in every five thirty-second 
period. Also indicate whether you belong to the group 
with or without the two minutes’ rest. 
It is perhaps impossible to select an activity in which 
there is no increase in efficiency due to practice. It is 
obvious that the two factors of practice and fatigue which 
appear in all continuous work tend to counteract each 
other. The former tends to make the curve rise while the 
latter tends to make it drop. The two factors may, how- 
ever, beseparated. If we allow a period of rest of two min- 
utes at the end of every five minutes of work we reduce 
the effects of fatigue and get the natural rise of the curve 
due to practice. The upper one in Fig. 25 is the compo- 
site curve of seven persons obtained inthismanner. The 
lower one is the composite ‘of ten persons working con- 
tinuously. The former may be called the practice curve 
and the latter the fatigue curve. The average gain of the 
seven records in the practice curve, comparing the last

five half-minute periods with the first five, is 57 per cent., 
while the average gain of the ten records in the fatigue 
curve is 10 per cent. 
2. Muscular Work and Fatigue. Perhaps the best 
apparatus for measuring muscular work and fatigue is the 
Mosso ergograph, which is to be used in this experi- 
ment.! 
Fasten the fingers, hand, and forearm of the right arm 
firmly in the arm rest, leaving only the middle finger free. 
Attach the finger cap to the middle finger so that the wire 
is taut when the finger is in resting position. With this 
finger lift the weight regularly every two seconds. Follow 
a metronome which has been set to beat sixty times per 
minute. On the first stroke raise the weight as high as 
you can and on the second lower it to the resting position, 
then on the next stroke lift it again, etc. Make a maxi- 
mum pull each time and continue until the finger is com- 
pletely exhausted. After a rest of thirty seconds make 
another record in the same manner. To show the effect 
of different intervals of rest, half of the class should rest 
thirty seconds and the other half one minute between 
the two records. 
Dip the record paper in shellac and hang it up to dry. 
After it is thoroughly dry mount it upon stiff paper and 
preserve it among your notes. Compare the number and

structor in charge to see that the apparatus is properly set up.

height of the pulls made in the two records. Also notice 
whether there are any rhythmic variations in the decrease 
of strength. EDIT

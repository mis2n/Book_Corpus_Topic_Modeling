  PREFACE 
As a supervisor of teacher-training at Purdue University, the 
writer has for some time felt the need of a textbook which could 
be put into the hands of student teachers to serve as a guide in 
observing, in supplementary reading, in making lesson plans, 
and in reporting to the supervisor. With such an aid it would 
be easier to keep the class together and their attention simul- 
taneously centered upon a given problem. Students should be 
instructed in the ethics of observation ; they should be made to 
appreciate the conditions under which observation and student 
teaching are done; they should be given daily instruction bear- 
ing upon the phase of classroom activity upon which they are 
to center attention; they should be instructed how to proceed 
in making lesson plans ; they should be directed to outside read- 
ing. This routine phase of the supervisor’s activity consumes, 
in many instances, all his time, leaving none for the real busi- 
ness of making significant observations or of directing progress 
in obtaining skill in teaching. It therefore seemed desirable to 
prepare in book form such an arrangement of materials as 
would enable supervisors to direct the major part of their 
energy into professional rather than into clerical channels. 
It will be seen from an examination of the text that the writer 
has attempted to make a complete analysis of the student’s ac- 
tivity while observing and practicing, and then to arrange each 
unit of work so that it takes its proper psychological position 
with respect to the entire program. The student begins by direct- 
ing his attention to the material side of the classroom, later he 
observes the physical and mental characteristics of the teacher 
and pupils, and still later he observes the technique of instruc-

iv OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
tion. This is followed by a theoretical discussion of the making 
and utilizing of lesson plans, a few model plans of varying types, 
and a discussion calculated to prepare the student to teach 
his first lesson. The remainder of the book deals with such 
problems as arise in actual teaching situations; for example, 
teaching pupils to think, conducting drill lessons, conducting 
development lessons, effective questioning. Because the needs 
of the pupils must at all times be kept uppermost in mind, it was 
not possible to arrange the teaching projects in any rigid sequen- 
tial order. For example, the needs of the pupils alone should 
determine whether the drill or the development lesson is to be 
considered first. 
The observation lessons aim to direct the student’s attention 
in a systematic manner to classroom conditions and activities. 
Along with each observation is included a theoretical discus- 
sion of that which is to be observed, thus making the process 
more intelligible and effective. Provision is made for a daily 
report on the observing by including after each lesson a guide 
to observation and a model report upon it. It therefore be- 
comes an easy matter to know just what any student is doing 
at any given time and to check his progress day by day. At 
some time during the student’s teaching activity he should be 
required to submit a written report upon his attempt to accom- 
plish the aim of each lesson of Part IV. These reports, when 
filed with the submitted lesson plans and reports of observa- 
tions, make a complete record of the student’s activity. 
In the preparation of the book the writer has kept in mind 
also the possibility of its use in training teachers in service.

  DIRECTED OBSERVATION AND 
SUPERVISED TEACHING 
PART I 
INTRODUCTION 
In Part I we attend to the setting in which educational pro- 
cedure is to take place; that is, buildings, classrooms, instruc- 
tional equipment, teacher’s personality, library, study halls, etc. 
These are very important considerations, for the extent to which 
they are adjusted and properly codrdinated measures the extent 
to which the real business of the school is possible. They deter- 
mine also the type of schoolroom outcome that. may be ex- 
pected. The school of yesterday, for example, contained only 
recitation rooms and study halls. Such buildings would be to- 
tally inadequate to our present conception of legitimate school 
activity. Well-equipped laboratories, playgrounds, and audito- 
riums are now considered necessary. The whole school setting 
then was more suited to the getting and reciting of lessons than 
to the directing of pupil activities toward the development of 
initiative and power. Such a setting contrasts strongly with 
that of the present, in which even the decorations on the wall 
have their rdle to play in fitting the setting to the task. 
It is our purpose in the first sixteen lessons to observe care- 
fully these tools and the skill with which the teacher adjusts 
them to the task in hand. The student should bear in mind 
that the tools have their excuse for being only as a means to an 
end; they never can be justified in themselves. Their only 
I

2 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
excuse for being is that they serve the purpose of education. 
Hence it is only through outcomes that they have any meaning 
and can be justified. It is the work of the expert to keep each 
tool nicely adjusted to the task of education ; toseethat attention 
is not directed upon it as an end in itself but rather as a means 
to an end; to see that on the whole the tools do not function 
at cross-purposes, that is, to see that they are so subordinated 
that all contribute as a unit to maximum efficiency ; and finally 
to see that they operate in the attaining of desirable outcomes. 
During this series of observations the student should make 
an effort to follow the text rather closely, making only such 
deviations from it as the director of observation may prescribe. 
Each observation must be preceded by a careful reading of the 
text if the student is to get the most out of it. He will then ° 
be intelligent about the things which he sees. One cannot 
effectively observe lighting, for example, without some definite 
notions as to the requirements for good lighting. It would be 
just as effective for an uninformed individual to observe in the 
operating-room of a hospital in order to determine the suit- 
ability of its equipment as for a student whose only idea of a 
schoolroom and its needs has been obtained as a pupil to observe 
without previously informing himself as to what is needed. He 
will, of course, observe things which the outline of the day does 
not call for. Such observations should be ignored at the time, 
and the attention should be centered upon the task at hand. 
There is a great advantage in this, as the student is thereby 
focalizing his efforts upon a few things which he is prepared to 
observe. 
Lesson XIV, in which we study the instructional equipment, 
will require that the student select for study those topics with a 
bearing upon the subject under observation. The student, for 
example, who is observing in a physics laboratory will pay no 
attention to discussions that have a bearing upon other types of 
laboratory work.  
-P-A-G-E-15
LESSON I 
Aim. To become acquainted with the educational organization 
behind observation and student teaching and to become 
familiar with good procedure in the matter of observation. 
Student teaching done under various types of organization. 
In general there are three types of organization under which 
student teaching is carried on. (1) Many normal schools and 
universities set up model schools of their own, which serve as 
laboratories for practice teaching and observation. Many of 
these schools charge tuition and attract a rather highly selected 
student body. In certain schools of this class, such as the Uni- 
versity of Chicago Elementary School and the High School, 
there is a long waiting list ; hence the selection, which would be 
considerable if nothing but the ability to pay the tuition were 
taken into account, is undoubtedly added to by the influence 
exerted by parents, who are often members of the university 
faculty. The visitor is struck immediately by the fact that these 
are not average children but highly selected children. (2) Other 
institutions enter into contract with the city board of education 
to utilize certain of the neighboring public schools as practice 
schools. (3) A third and less desirable type of organization is 
one in which there is no understanding between the institution 
and the board of education. In such situations the supervisor 
must depend upon the good will of the superintendent, prin- 
cipals, and teachers, who constantly jeopardize their positions 
in the cause of education. 
The advantage of the model school is evident. The supervisor 
is free to work out the methods of procedure that are deemed 
most effective. He is not subject to the worry that comes from 
3
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
complaints of parents who continually threaten to disrupt the 
system. On the other hand the pupils, as was said above, are a 
selected group. The student teacher does not become acquainted 
with a school of the sort in which he must teach during the 
coming year. The problem of discipline is less acute than in 
most schools, as the pupils come from the best Homes. Similarly 
the problem of presenting the material effectively is much les- 
sened. The contract arrangement, on the other hand, gives the 
student teacher a very realistic situation in which to work. 
Success there is much more likely to mean success in a public- 
school situation. True, the student teacher is somewhat shel- 
tered in either case by the fact that the supervisor is ultimately 
responsible for what goes on. But the one trained in the public 
school has an opportunity at least to become more familiar with 
the problems presented in such schools. The dull children are 
more in evidence ; the problems of discipline are more frequent ; 
the equipment is more likely to be that which the student 
teacher will have when he enters the service ; and teachers must 
work in closer conjunction with the community. 
The third type of situation, under which many student 
teachers at present must work, is almost an impossible one. 
However, when teaching under those conditions the student 
teacher must bear in mind the favor granted by the classroom 
. teacher and principal and do his best to conduct his work so 
that serious consequences can never fall upon those who jeop- 
ardize their positions by giving him an opportunity to observe 
and teach. The writer believes that if the candidate for student 
teaching understands the conditions under which he is about 
to work, there will be less likelihood of failure to meet the 
situation. ; 
The following contract between Ohio University and the 
Board of Education of the city of Athens represents a very de- 
sirable situation for observation and practice teaching :*

  LESSON I 5 
AGREEMENT 
THIS AGREEMENT made this —— day of —— between the Board 
of Education of the city of Athens, Ohio, and Ohio University: 
WITNESSETH, That the parties of this agreement each in con- 
sideration of the agreements on the part of the other herein contained, 
do hereby agree, the Board of Education for itself and Ohio University 
for itself, as follows: 
1. That the Board of Education: 
(a) Permit the University to use such classes and rooms in the Athens 
School System as the University deems necessary for its practice teach- 
ing and observation, the selection to be approved by the City Super- 
intendent of Schools. 
(b) Permit the University with the advice and counsel of the Super- 
intendent of Schools to designate teachers already in the Athens School 
System as critic teachers for those rooms where the University shall 
place practice teachers. 
(c) All critic teachers, supervising principals, and superintendent shall 
be approved by both the University and the Board of Education. 
(d) The Board reserves the right to retain any teachers now in the 
schools. ; 
(e) Until the discontinuance of the University High School the Board 
agrees to continue the financial arrangements now existing between the 
Board and the University and to pay such additional critic teachers as 
may be employed the maximum salaries paid to non-critic teachers of 
the same rank during the school year 1922-1923. When the University 
High School is discontinued the University agrees to pay all salaries for 
instruction except those of teachers in the schools owned and operated 
by the Board of Education. In the event larger building facilities are 
furnished by the University, the Board of Education agrees to pay the 
additional teachers at the same rate and in the same manner as in the 
buildings provided by the City. Critic teachers in the schools owned 
and operated by the Board of Education will receive from the Board the 
maximum salaries according to the schedule, paid by the Board to other 
teachers of the same rank during the school year 1922-23, and shall have 
their salaries supplemented by the University. In the event of the em- 
ploying of critic teachers for new subjects or new grades the Board will 
pay toward the salaries of such teachers what it finds to be the usual 
salaries paid to non-critic teachers under similar conditions. In the 
event of any general reduction in teachers’ salaries at the request of the 
Board a joint committee of the Board and the University shall be ap-
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
pointed to determine what salaries shall be paid by the Board; the find- 
ings of such committee to be subject to the approval of the Board before 
adoption. Likewise, in the event of any general increase in salaries the 
above joint committee shall at the request of the University make 
recommendation to the Board relative to increase in salaries. 
(f) Permit the University to supervise and direct the teaching of the 
critic teachers and the practice teachers in the Athens School System, 
subject to the suggestions and recommendations of the City Superin- 
tendent. The Superintendent of City Schools may be called into confer- 
ence at any time by the University for discussion of matters of mutual 
interest. 
(g) Enforce all school laws relating to attendance, incorrigibles, med- 
ical inspection, records, and registrations. 
2. That Ohio University : 
(a) Supplement the salaries of those teachers designated by the Uni- 
versity as critic teachers. 
(6) Consider all members of the teaching force whose salaries are 
supplemented by the University to be members of the faculty of the Col- 
lege of Education. All such critic teachers are members of the corps of 
city teachers and as such are subject to rules and regulations of the City 
Superintendent. 
(c) Employ a director of the training who shall be approved both by 
the University and the Board of Education, who shall have charge of the 
teacher training and all instruction and materials of instruction in that 
portion of the school system which is being used by the University for 
the teacher training; and likewise such supervisors of regular classroom 
instruction as shall hereafter be deemed necessary to be selected by the 
University. The director of training may be required by the Board to 
attend any or all meetings of the Board. 
(d) Discontinue the University high school. 
(e) Operate the present Elementary Training School at the University 
as a training or a model observation school to be maintained as at pres- 
ent. This school shall conform to all arrangements in this agreement 
except that the 50% limit in practice teaching shall not apply until Sep- 
tember, 1925. 
3. All courses of study, the selection of instructional materials, and 
assignments of pupils for instructional purposes shall be made by the 
superintendent of schools and the director of training and be approved 
by both.
-P-A-G-E-19
LESSON I 7 
4. Not more than fifty per cent of the teaching shall be done by 
practice teachers. This limit shall apply both as to each particular room 
in the grades and subject in the high school. 
5. Detailed working arrangements shall be worked out by the superin- 
tendent and the proper University officials and submitted to the Board 
and the University for final mutual approval before being put into effect. 
6. This agreement is to be effective September 1, 1923, with the ex- 
ception of exceptions noted in the contract and that portion relating to 
the discontinuance of the University high school. It will be discontinued — 
when the Board of Education has facilities to take care of the students who 
would go over to the Athens high school from the University high school. 
7. This agreement may be terminated by either party to the agree- 
ment on June rst of any year, provided notice in writing is given to the 
other party on the September first preceding. 
Other institutions are less fortunate than Ohio University. 
Some departments of education find it necessary to depend en- 
tirely upon the good will of the local school superintendents, 
principals, and teachers for permission to do the required obser- 
vation and practice teaching. Such conditions seriously handi- 
cap the teacher-training institution in its effort to turn out 
well-equipped teachers. Even under these adverse conditions a 
surprising amount can be accomplished by tactful and effective 
supervision. 
Student teachers should understand conditions under which 
they are teaching. It is important that student teachers repre- 
senting institutions which have no model school be fully aware 
of the precarious conditions under which the observation and 
practice teaching is being carried on so that their every move 
may satisfy and further promote the good will of the public- 
school teachers and administrative officers and thereby make 
possible the training of those who are to follow them. Indiffer- 
ence and lack of preparation on the part of one student teacher 
may not only cause the classroom teacher to deny another 
student such privileges but may cause several of her colleagues
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
to do likewise. Consequently it behooves every student teacher 
working where such relations between the department of edu- 
cation and the public school obtain to keep in mind those who 
are to follow him, work at his maximum efficiency, and do all 
in his power to promote the good will of both the faculty and 
the pupils of the public school. 
All criticism of classroom instructors and methods must be 
confined to reports and conference. It is very important, espe- 
cially in the case of practice teaching outside of model schools, 
to discuss only with the supervisor or with the classroom in- 
structor himself what takes place in the classroom. Discussions 
at boarding-places or rooming-places on the happenings in the 
classroom reach the parents and teachers with surprising speed. 
Then, too, they are generally so distorted as to present the 
classroom in a bad light before the parents. The experienced 
teacher has learned to exercise discretion in discussing school 
problems, whether they concern the general administration of 
the system or are limited to classroom procedure. This the 
practice teacher should learn as part of his preparation for 
teaching. 
Beginning teachers must learn to adjust themselves to the 
system in which they are to teach. Whether the student teacher 
is doing his practice teaching in a model school or in a public 
school, he is about to enter a system. He will not be free to do 
as he pleases but must adjust himself to things as he finds 
them. He may have had previous experience in another system. 
In that event there is danger that by calling attention in a 
tactless manner to the way in which he is in the habit of doing 
things he will antagonize members of the system in which he 
is to do practice teaching. The practice teacher should be 
docile and open to suggestion. He is present to learn what 
he can and not to instruct. There will be times when he may 
honestly feel that the classroom teacher could improve his 
method at certain points. At such times he should discuss mat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  
LESSON I 9 
ters frankly with his supervisor, meanwhile following the direc- 
tions of the classroom teacher. He should keep in mind that 
he is soon to have a class of his own and will have freedom 
then to try out his ideas. 
Classroom teacher’s first duty to pupils. Whether observation 
and practice teaching is done in a model school or in a public 
school, the classroom teacher’s first-duty is toward the pupils.\ 
Hence the student teacher must teach effectively from the start. 
His program must be light enough to allow the most careful 
preparation of the lesson, and under no condition should he 
appear before a class without having his lesson fully prepared. 
Should he, for reasons beyond his control, be prevented from 
preparing a lesson, he must notify both the classroom teacher 
and the supervisor at once, so that other arrangements for the 
class may be made. It is very desirable that, at the beginning, 
lesson plans be made and accepted at least a day before the 
teaching of the lesson. This will enable the supervisor to cause 
necessary modifications of the plans. 
Care must be exercised not to disturb the class while observ- 
ing. Every effort should be made to observe without disturbing 
the class. This is not an easy thing to do. The very fact that 
there is a stranger in the room is bound to affect the instruction. 
If being observed does not affect the teacher directly, it is bound 
to do so indirectly by acting as a distracting element for the 
pupils. Hence it is important that the observer do all in his 
power to prevent distraction. This is equally desirable whether . 
the observer is a student observing the regular classroom 
teacher or the supervisor observing a student teacher. 
Observer should enter the room before class begins and re- 
main throughout the instruction period. It is generally very dis- 
concerting to the classroom teacher to have a visitor enter 
while the class is in progress. This is especially true if the 
visitor is to pass judgment upon the teaching. Although leav- 
ing the room attracts less attention than entering, it nevertheless
-P-A-G-E-22
  ro OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
is a disturbing element and should be avoided, especially by 
student observers, who ought to cause as little disturbance as 
possible. Then, too, it is unfair to the classroom teacher to judge 
his work after entering late, seeing a small part of the perform- 
ance, and then departing. One of America’s most famous edu- 
cators, when a young man, is said to have told his supervisor 
to enter a class at the beginning of the period and stay through 
the entire session if he wanted to gain any notion of a young 
teacher’s ability. When an observer, especially one higher in 
authority than the classroom teacher, enters the room during 
the class period, the pupils are keen to note the sensitiveness of 
the teacher to the situation. The teacher, aware of this fact, is 
sometimes made doubly sensitive. Under these conditions the 
work of even the best teacher will not appear to good advantage. 
If, however, the room must be entered while the class is in ses- 
sion, it should be entered by a rear door if there is one, and with 
as little noise as possible. 
Observer should not appear to notice the pupils’ reactions. 
The “smart Aleck” who tries to disturb the class by attracting 
attention to his clownish acts will be encouraged by the smile 
of the visitor. Encouragement of this sort must never be given. 
The proper attitude to maintain is that of completely ignoring 
the trouble-maker. Often, too, the well-meaning pupil will be 
found attending to the observer. This also can be minimized 
by the visitor’s looking in another direction and paying no 
attention to the pupil. 
Observer should avoid such reactions as would enable the 
pupils to determine his approval or disapproval of the lesson. 
Changes in the observer’s facial expression or bodily posture 
which take place simultaneously with the teacher’s variations 
in forms of procedure, especially if the teacher is meeting with 
difficulty in conducting the lesson effectively, may enable the 
pupils to detect the visitor’s approval or disapproval of what 
is going on. Situations of this kind are sure to embarrass the
-P-A-G-E-23
    
LESSON I Ir 
teacher still more and to weaken to some extent his hold upon 
the class. Hence the observer, whether he is a student observ- 
ing a regular classroom teacher or a supervisor observing stu- 
dent teaching, should maintain as noncommittal an attitude 
as possible. The more impassive he can appear to what is going 
on in the room and yet observe all that is going on, particularly 
that which he came primarily to observe, the more efficiently 
has he filled the réle of observer. 
Note-taking must be done with care. It is because of the ill 
effects, discussed in the foregoing paragraph, which may follow 
from an observer’s disclosure of his thoughts that few notes 
should be taken while observing. If the observer is seated in 
the rear of the room he may be able to take a few abbreviated 
notes without attracting the attention of the class. However, 
even this may be observed by the teacher and may cause him 
annoyance. If the student observer brings a list of prepared 
questions so constructed that a plus or minus or check will serve 
as material for reconstructing the notes later, it greatly facili- 
tates the process of nondisturbing observation. In the first 
place more time is left for observing, and in the second place 
the distracting element is greatly lessened. 
The writer’s experience in supervising student observation 
has led him to request that observers take no notes in class, but 
write rough notes as soon as possible after class. They can 
write the notes out in full after they return to their rooms or to 
the university. This requires the student to study carefully 
before entering the class the points which he is to observe. If 
any note-taking during observation is permitted, the student 
should do as much abbreviating as possible and jot down the 
notes at such times as to interfere least with observation. The 
observer who begins to write the minute he locates a point that 
he wishes to note is likely to miss the setting and full signifi- 
cance of that point. For example, let us suppose the student 
to be observing discipline. A pupil distracts the class; the
-P-A-G-E-24
12 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
teacher stops work and, looking intently at the pupil, waits for 
order. Let us suppose that the observer begins immediately to 
write. He may overlook the fact that the teacher after stopping 
work does not take his eyes off the offender until resuming 
the discussion. He is likely also to fail to observe carefully the 
effect of the disciplinary device upon the pupil. Then, too, the 
fact that the observer is writing is likely further to distract 
the class and to embarrass the teacher. If a few abbreviated 
notes are jotted down after the incident is entirely passed the 
observer is likely to have observed more effectively and with a 
minimum amount of distraction to the pupils. In general the 
better prepared the student is for the observation the less writ- 
ing will be required and the more efficiently the observations 
can be made. 
Student teacher must be desirous of becoming a good teacher. 
The student who does not intend to enter upon the work with 
the utmost seriousness should not sign up for observation and 
practice teaching. The attitude of just getting by is fatal to 
the entire program. The student teacher who is not willing to 
exert himself to the utmost, so that each day may find him 
teaching a better lesson than the previous day, is a liability to 
all concerned. The good supervisor will not tolerate indiffer- 
ence. Apart from the fact that such teachers may cause the 
public-school authorities to stop practice teaching entirely, the 
supervisor as a representative of the teaching profession should 
feel in duty bound to prevent one with such an attitude from 
obtaining a license to teach. The teaching profession, upholds 
the highest ideals of service. Timeservers are not wanted. 
GUIDE TO OBSERVATION AND REPORT 
1, If possible, enter the room before the pupils take up the work. 
2. If possible, enter the room by a rear door. 4 
3. Quietly take a seat in the rear of the room.
-P-A-G-E-25
LESSON I 1 
4, Avoid taking any notice of those pupils who would prefer to 
attend to you rather than to the work at hand. 
5. Notes should be abbreviated so that the student may give a 
maximum amount of time to observation and a minimum amount 
to writing. A prepared (preferably mimeographed) outline with 
detailed questions that may be answered by Yes or No, such as 
accompany this text, facilitates note-taking. 
6. Avoid facial expressions which might denote approval or dis- 
approval of what is going on. 
7. If it is necessary to leave the room before the class is dis- 
missed, go out by a rear door if there is one, EASES as little noise 
as possible. 
8. After observation the student should retire immediately to his 
study or the library and write up the notes in full.

LESSON II 
Aim. To become acquainted with the pupils whom the student 
is to teach later to the extent of knowing their names and 
something of their individual peculiarities which are likely 
to affect them as members of the class. 
The first consideration of the student observer is that of 
learning the names of the pupils whom he is to instruct later. 
If possible he should have prepared, previous to class, a plat 
of the room showing the seating. The position of the teacher’s 
desk should be included, as this will aid in reading the plat. 
The student should enter in the proper rectangles the names of 
pupils as rapidly as he learns them, making a conscious effort 
at the time to connect the name with the face and both name 
and face with the location. If the teacher has such a plat which 
the student can copy before the class, so much the better. He 
can then give the entire class period to connecting names and 
faces with their location. 
The making of the plat will require the student to do con- 
siderable writing while observing. Writing is not objectionable 
at this point if the teacher is aware, as he should be, of the 
student’s task on that day. 
After the lesson the student should take the plat to his room 
and study it until he is able to visualize the position of each 
pupil and at the same time to recall the name. This will not 
entirely suffice, however, and hence the plat should be taken to 
future observations until the student is in complete mastery of 
the name and location of each pupil. A duplicate of the chart 
should be made and given to the supervisor unless otherwise 
requested. It will serve as a record of this observation.

of some convenient size represent the seats occupied by the pupils. 
Let a large rectangle appropriately placed represent the teacher’s

rectangles with the pupils’ names as rapidly as you can discover 
them. After class go to the teacher and try to obtain the remain-

The class which I am observing for a short period is a group of 
eighteen juniors who are undertaking a study of the novel. The 
course includes the study of The Vicar of Wakefield, Lorna Doone, 
and The Rise of Silas Lapham. During this first observation I 
was impressed with the general atmosphere of study. The class 
seemed to anticipate with pleasure the work for the ensuing semes- 
ter. Though I have slight acquaintance with any of the members 
of the class, many of their names are familiar; it is not difficult, 
therefore, to associate their names with their faces.

LESSON III 
Aim. To understand the problem of lighting a schoolroom 
properly, with particular reference to the room in which 
the student is to teach, with a view to becoming, as a 
future teacher, more conscious of this consideration and 
better informed upon the principles governing it. 
It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of lighting 
in the schoolroom in which a large amount of time is spent in 
reading. Bad lighting, there is reason to believe, causes much 
eye trouble; and thinking is greatly impaired during eyestrain. 
Defects in lighting are of two sorts: first, the light supply 
may be insufficient ; secondly, the light may enter the room from 
such directions as to cause cross lighting or to fall directly into 
the eyes of those at work. With respect to the amount of light 
the chief danger is that there be too little of it. Under no 
conditions should the window space be less than one fifth the 
floor space. The direction from which the light comes is an 
important matter also. In order to prevent cross lighting it is 
necessary that all windows be located on one side of the build- 
ing or that the light enter the room from above. However, the 
entrance of the light at the ceiling is not so desirable as its 
entrance at the side and from the left. This is owing to the 
fact that when light comes from above the pupil is likely to 
work in his own light. Windows should be at least three and 
one-half feet from the floor and extend as meeely to the ceiling 
as possible. 
Artificial lighting is always necessary on dark days or during 
storms. There seems to be some conflict of opinion as to the 
telative merits of direct and indirect lighting (in indirect light- 
17
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
ing the light is reflected to the ceiling or a reflector and then 
back upon the floor). In direct lighting frosted bulbs and re- 
flectors should be employed. The distance which the lights 
should hang down will depend upon the height of the ceiling and 
the amount of floor space to be covered by each light. A test 
  
    
    
Fic. 2. A Badly Lighted Schoolroom 
The light enters this room from three sides. There is no blackboard space in the 
room upon which written material can be seen by all the pupils while seated. At the 
same time glares are produced which are injurious to the eyes of the children. Ob- 
serve the fact that the window shades roll down from the top, thus making it impos- 
sible at times to screen children from the direct rays of the sun without seriously 
reducing the amount of light available 
should be made by darkening the room and turning on each 
light separately, in this way determining the space covered by 
each. The color of the wall should be such as to absorb as little 
as possible of the light without presenting a glaring surface. For 
example, brown reflects about ro per cent of the light, green 
about 20 per cent, yellow about 60 per cent, and an unglazed  
-P-A-G-E-31
  
LESSON III 19 
white surface about 80 per cent. Considering only the efficiency 
of lighting, the above colors are desirable in the order in which 
      
Fic. 3. Types of Lighting Fixtures 
a, b, d, and ¢ are types of semi-indirect lighting units; that is, they give two com- 
ponents of light, one coming directly through the translucent bowl, the other passing 
upward, striking a reflecting surface, and from there being directed downward. The 
reflecting surface in @ and e is the ceiling and in } and d is a porcelain enameled 
reflector. a, b, and ¢ are subject to the criticism that dust collecting upon the interior 
of the bowls interferes with the transmission of light. This objection is not present 
in d, which is inclosed. e¢ is a modified form of a in which lighting qualities are 
sacrificed for esthetic qualities. c has an inclosing globe, the sole purpose of which 
is to diffuse the light and remove the glaring filament from the field of vision. f is 
known as a totally indirect luminaire. It is lined on its inner surface with a mirror- 
like reflector which reflects the light to the ceiling, or to a reflector, where it is dif- 
fusely reflected to the lower part of the room. It is affected by dust more than 
any of the others. On this account it is not suitable for schoolroom use. Its chief 
merit is that it gives a more perfect diffusion of light with the consequent absence 
of shadows and glare which in itself is very desirable 
they reflect increasing amounts of light ; however, cream or buff 
is considered more desirable for esthetic reasons. 
No study of the lighting of a room is complete which does 
not take into account the color, material. and arrangement of
-P-A-G-E-32
  
20 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
the window shades. The color of the shades should be similar 
to that of the walls, although somewhat darker. The material 
should be such as to make them opaque. Shades should roll 
from the bottom of the window up. This arrangement will 
make it possible to exclude the light from the level of the chil- 
dren’s eyes and allow the light from the upper part of the win- 
dow to diffuse through the room. Venetian blinds should never 
be used, for they admit the light in bands of light and shadow, 
which are very bad for the eyes.

1, Measure or, if that is impossible, estimate window space and 
floor space and determine the ratio of the former to the latter.

The room is lighted by five windows (8 x 3 feet, estimated), 
making a total of 120 square feet of window space. I estimate the 
floor space to be about 20 x 30 feet, or a total of about 600 square 
feet. The amount of window space is about right, considering the 
size of the room, if it were not for the fact that the design of the 
building has made it necessary for all the light to enter from 
the rear, which is the narrow side. The result is that artificial 
lights have to be used most of the time in order to secure effective 
lighting in the front of the room. Some light may enter the front 
of the room through a cloakroom entrance on one side. When this 
door is open all the ill effects of cross lighting result, making it 
impossible to use the front board. 
The teacher reports that she seldom uses the front board, be- 
cause the pupils cannot see the work. This is owing in part to 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  22. OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
the ill effects of cross lighting and in part to the lack of sufficient 
light. I should suggest that a blackboard reflector be placed above 
the board and that the board be lighted artificially when in use. 
The light could be turned off at other times. 
The natural light is supplemented by four electric lights sus- 
pended from the ceiling. The artificial lighting is direct. A reflec- 
tor is placed above each light. The bulbs are not frosted. As the 
lights are strong (sixty-watt bulbs) one is partially blinded by their 
glare at each chance look at them. The artificial lighting could 
readily be improved by putting in frosted bulbs or by covering the 
bulbs with reflecting globes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
LESSON IV 
Aim. To understand the problem of ventilating and heat- 
ing the room in which the practice teaching is to be done 
later, with a view to becoming, as a future teacher, more 
conscious of these considerations and better informed upon 
the principles governing them. 
VENTILATING AND HEATING 
Ventilating. Another important consideration in a properly 
designed schoolroom is the matter of proper ventilation. The 
amount of carbon dioxide in the air is no longer considered the 
chief cause of the ills of poor ventilation. Breathing and the per- 
spiring of the body increase the humidity of the air and hence 
give those in the room the feeling one has on a summer’s day 
when heat and humidity are high. The increased humidity 
lowers the rate of evaporation, which causes a rise in the body 
temperature, and the pores of the skin dilate in order to offset 
this effect. A pupil leaving the room or suddenly exposed to a 
draft while in this condition is much more likely to take cold 
than if the room had been heated and ventilated properly. The 
increasing amount of water vapor, charged as it is with the 
waste products of the body, causes very unpleasant odors. All 
this leads to conditions which are unfavorable to the learning 
process. 
The methods by which ventilation is secured are of two sorts: 
those depending upon gravity and those depending upon me- 
chanical devices. The gravity methods depend upon the fact 
that warm air is lighter than cold and tends to rise, whereas 
cold air tends to fall. At first one would think that the warm 
23
-P-A-G-E-36
  
24. OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
air should enter the room near the floor, passing out of the 
room near the ceiling. This arrangement tends to cause the air 
to pass directly from inlet to outlet, leaving large eddies of un- 
changed air in the room. The better method is to have the air 
enter near the ceiling and leave at the floor or near it on the 
same side of the room. It is important that the inlet and the 
outlet be large, from four to five square feet each in a school- 
room of average size, in order to permit thirty cubic feet of 
fresh air per child per minute without increasing the incoming 
velocity to more than four hundred feet per minute. It is con- 
sidered somewhat more satisfactory to have the inlet and the 
outlet surfaces distributed so that the incoming air enters at 
several points near the ceiling and the outgoing air likewise 
leaves at several points in or near the floor. 
The gravity system, owing to the fact that its working is 
affected by the temperature of the outside air and also by winds, 
is not entirely satisfactory; hence resort is often made to me- 
chanical means for forcing air into the room (plenum system) 
or drawing it out of the room (vacuum system). A combina- 
tion of the two is sometimes employed. The vacuum system ° 
when used alone has the disadvantage of being likely to draw 
air from openings, such as windows, in one room and to fail 
to empty properly another room. 
Heating. The heating may be carried on by means of steam, 
hot water, or hot air. Everything considered, steam seems the 
most satisfactory. When pressure is high it can be used to drive 
the ventilating force ; owing to its intense heat it warms rooms 
quickly ; it is not so subject to the danger of frost as the hot- 
water system. On the other hand, the hot-water system is 
somewhat cheaper when once installed. Hot air is often dry 
and this system has the disadvantage of not working well during 
high winds and low temperature. If the hot-air system is used 
it will suffice for both heating and ventilating. However, care 
will be necessary to insure the proper humidity of the air.
-P-A-G-E-37
    Fan Outlet       
Fic. 4. Air-Washing and Ventilating Apparatus 
This device makes it not only possible to remove the dust particles from the air but 
to raise the air to a desirable classroom temperature and humidity as well. The 
fresh air is drawn into the building by means of a fan (see ). It then passes over 
tempering coils, which raise it to a temperature at which it will take on and hold a 
desirable amount of water vapor. The air then passes into a spray chamber, in which 
many fine sprays of water remove the dust particles and add a desirable amount of 
water vapor. Owing to the fact that the air passes rapidly through the spray cham- 
ber some water is held in mechanical suspension. This is removed by eliminators, 
over which the air passes after leaving the spray chamber. The eliminator consists 
of complicated baffle plates which cause the air to change its direction suddenly and 
several times in succession, with the effect that the water particles impinge upon 
and adhere to the baffle plates. The air with its charge of water vapor next passes 
over another set of coils, which serve to raise it to the temperature desired in the 
classroom: It then passes to the fan outlet to be distributed to the various rooms 
of the building

GUIDE TO OBSERVATION AND REPORT 
VENTILATING 
1, Determine, if possible, whether a gravity system or some 
mechanical system of ventilation is being used. 
2. At how many points does air enter and leave the room ? 
3. Estimate the number of square feet of inlet. 
4, If an anemometer can be obtained, measure the rate of the 
incoming air and determine the number of cubic feet of air per 
child per minute. To obtain the number of cubic feet entering the 
room per minute multiply the velocity at which air enters per 
minute by the area in square feet of the inlet openings. 
5. Is the flow of air obstructed by the design of the screen cover- 
ing the inlets? 
6. Is any attempt made to filter the incoming air? If so, 
describe the device used. 
7. Is air drawn from a cellar or some point above the ground ? 
8. What arrangements have been made to insure proper humidity 
in the room? If hygrometer can be obtained measure the percen- 
tage of moisture. (Standard, 55 per cent saturation.) 
HEATING 
1. How is the room heated? by steam, hot water, or hot air? 
2. How many thermometers are in the room? 
3. Where are the thermometers located ? 
4, What is the temperature of the room ? 
5. Is it equal in all parts of the room? 
Norte. Only part of these observations can be carried on during the class 
period. The remainder should be done immediately after school or during the 
noon or the recess period.

The system of ventilation is inferior. Though the teacher is not 
supposed to do so, it is necessary occasionally for her to ventilate 
the room by opening the windows. A mechanical system is used, 
but the engine that drives the fan is often idle. The ventilation 
intake, which consists of one opening 1 x 2 feet, is located near 
the ceiling. There is but one outlet, which is about 24 feet square. 
The air is supposed to be washed by being driven through a water- 
soaked screen. 
The room is very evenly heated by steam, and the temperature 
on an average is about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. There is only one 
thermometer in the room, which is fastened on a door frame at the 
front of the room about 3 feet from the floor. It would be better 
to attach the thermometer to the teacher’s desk or to one of the 
pupils’ desks nearer the center of the room. The temperature at 
either of these points would be more indicative of the actual 
temperature of the room.

LESSON V 
Aim. To understand the problem of seating and blackboards 
from the standpoint of schoolroom hygiene in general and 
to evaluate in terms of this study the room in which the 
student is to teach later. 
SEATING AND BLACKBOARDS 
Seating of pupils. In schoolroom designing the question of 
seating is too often given but little consideration. The prin- 
ciples of lighting studied in Lesson III make certain seating 
requirements very important. For example, if the pupils face 
the long side of the room, too little lighting space is allowed and 
the desks on the far side of the room are poorly lighted. 
Then, too, pupils seated on either side get only a side view of 
material placed on the front blackboard or displayed by the 
teacher. Although there is, of course, a limit to conservation 
of aisle space (pupils should be able to pass each other con- 
veniently in the aisles), it is important that the space around 
the board should be ample for work. Experience demonstrates 
that the space between the desks and the board at the rear and 
side of the room should not be less than four feet. This will 
enable pupils to pass by others at work at the board without 
danger of congestion. It will also enable those sitting in the front 
and those sitting in the rear of the room to see conveniently 
what is put upon the side board and those on the sides to see 
the work on the rear board without leaving their desks. 
Pupils’ desks and seats. Since the pupils are sitting many 
hours each day it is very important that the seats be so con- 
structed as to fit the child at work. ‘However, in the effort to

meet this requirement one must not overlook certain other 
needs. It is necessary that janitors be able properly to sweep 
the floor beneath the desks and also to remove the dust from the 
desks themselves. The writer has seen desks and seats from 
under which it was almost impossible for a janitor to remove 
  
        
Fic. 5. A Poor Blackboard Arrangement 
This shows a situation in which the pupils face the long side of the room, with the 
result that those seated at one side of the room cannot see material written on the 
board at the other. When the room is full it is impossible to use the board except 
for examination purposes. It is then necessary to write the questions on the board 
at one end of the room and duplicate them at the other 
the dirt with any known instrument. Many of the old-style 
desks and seats were supported by cast-iron standards the 
design of which gave a trellis effect. These were dust catchers, 
and have been largely done away with. The tendency is to 
avoid as much as possible all desk construction that is not con- 
ducive to schoolroom sanitation.

30 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
Both desks and seats should be adjustable. If desks and seats 
are not adjustable, it is impossible properly to fit each child. 
One of the objections to adjustable seats and desks has been that 
they wear loose at points of adjustment and hence move around 
with the movements of the pupils, thus causing disturbance in 
the room and discomfort to the pupils. This objection has been 
  
  
    
Fic. 6. A Good Type of Seat and Desk 
This shows a type of seat and desk which is adjustable. Either the seat or the desk 
can be adjusted as to height with very little difficulty. The pedestals are so designed 
as to leave a minimum space upon which dust may collect. The floor may be kept 
clean with little difficulty 
rather serious. However, the remedy must be in simplifying 
and improving the mechanics of adjustment rather than in 
resorting to the old unadjustable desk. 
Adjusting desks to pupils. One of the first tasks which con- 
front the teacher in arranging for the year’s work is seeing that 
each pupil is properly supplied with a suitable desk and seat. 
If desks and seats are adjustable, the matter will not give much

LESSON V 31 
trouble, for it is then only a matter of calling in a janitor and, 
with the child present, fitting the desk and seat to his measure- 
ment. If the seats are not adjustable and are all of uniform 
size, there are, of course, no changes to be made. 
An important consideration in fitting the desk and seat to 
the pupil is the height of the seat from the floor. This should 
| be such that when the child’s feet are resting squarely upon the 
  
  
      
Fic. 7. A Poor Type of Seat and Desk 
This shows a type of seat and desk which is nonadjustable and which has the added 
bad feature of being a dust trap. The scroll design of the desk pedestals, or stand- 
ards, affords recesses into which dust can collect and from which it is difficult to re- 
move it. It is almost impossible to keep such seats in a sanatory condition 
floor the thigh bone is parallel to the floor. The thighs should 
not be raised from the seat. The height of the desk top should 
be such that the forearms may be rested easily and naturally 
upon it, as is necessary in writing. As regards the distance be- 
tween the seat and the desk, the desk should overlap the seat 
about two inches. This is called a minus distance of two inches 
between seat and desk. Under no condition should this dis-

tance be plus; that is, so that if a vertical line be dropped from 
the rear edge of the desk top and also from the front edge of 
the seat to the floor there will be a space between them not 
covered by desk top or seat. Should such a condition obtain, 
it would result in a cramping of the abdominal viscera and of 
the heart and lungs. Con- 
tinued working in this 
position causes the neck 
muscles to tire and the 
head to lower under the 
pull of gravity. This will — 
bring the book too near 
the eyes, a condition 
conducive to myopia, or 
shortsightedness.

should slant at an angle 
of about fifteen degrees.

as not to interfere with the pupil’s movements while he is en-

cave, with the lowest part where the pelvic bones rest, and 
should be about two thirds as long as the thighs and little wider ; 
greater width may tempt the pupil into unhygienic postures. Its

Movable versus im- 
movable seats and desks. 
Regarding the question 
as to whether the desks 
and chairs should be sta- 
tionary or movable, there 
is good argument both 
ways. H. E. Bennett, 
in an article entitled 
“Requirements for Good 
School Seating” (in Ele- 
mentary School Journal, 
Vol, XXIII, pp. 203- 
214), makes the follow- 
ing points: 
The greatest step forward 
in desk constructionhas been 
the introduction of the mov- 
able chair desks. Several 
types are now on the market. 
_ The advantages of these may 
be summarized as follows: 
1. Each desk is adjusted 
to its own chair rather than 
to the one in front, with 
obvious advantages other- 
wise possible only to sepa- 
rate seats and desks.   
        
Fic. 9. A Well-Adjusted Seat and Desk 
This seat and desk fit the child properly. His 
feet rest yquarely upon the floor; his thigh bones 
are parallel to the floor; his back is properly 
supported; his forearms rest easily and naturally 
upon the top of the desk; and the position of 
his torso is such that there is no cramping of 
the abdominal viscera 
2. Floors are not defaced and rendered unsanitary by hundreds of 
screw holes (from 360 to more than 1000 in a room). 
3. Floors are more easily and perfectly cleaned. 
4. The difficulty of fitting pupils by adjusting or assorting the seats in 
a room is avoided by the readiness with which the chairs may be inter- 
changed from room to room. The need for “adjustable furniture” may 
be entirely obviated by the use of assorted sizes of movable desks.
-P-A-G-E-46
  34. OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
5. The problem of lighting, which can be only partially solved by the 
architect, is met by the ease with which pupils may turn their seats and 
* move them out of the direct sunlight or nearer to the windows as oc- 
casion may require. : 
6. Pupils are readily separated for instruction in distinct groups—a 
plan of work insisted on in modern school management. 
7. Pupils may be seated in any part of the room according to the 
teacher’s discretion and without regard to size. This is a point which is 
appreciated by even the most reactionary teachers. : 
8. The entire arrangement of the room may be changed in a mo- 
ment. The pupils may be massed at the front to observe demonstrations 
by the teacher, or they may be arranged in a circle, or, with seats pushed 
against the wall, the floor may be cleared for games, calisthenics, drama- 
tizations, etc. This should result in an enormous saving in progressive 
school construction, since any room may be quickly converted into a 
playroom, social center, dancing-room, etc. 
9. The seats may be removed from the room entirely, leaving it avail- 
able for community-center work of any sort. 
to. Grades are readily interchangeable among the rooms when this 
may be desirable for administrative reasons. 
Mr. Bennett discusses the objections as follows: 
Some objections raised to movable desks are that children are tempted 
to move them too much, that lines and aisles are not kept straight, that 
they are less durable, that they are easily overturned, spilling ink, books, 
and even children on the floor, and that in case of panic the falling seats 
would increase the danger. The first and second are unimportant, easily 
controlled by the right kind of discipline, and may be advanced as ex- 
cellent arguments for movable seats in that they offer opportunity for 
right training for home and life. Children need the chance to learn to 
keep their chairs in whatever order is desirable without being screwed 
down. The last three objections are matters of construction which must 
be remedied. Movable seats can and should have the stability of a sub- 
stantial table. They should be so constructed that no movement of the 
child in the seat and no downward pressure on the desk can possibly 
overturn it. 
The teacher’s desk. The location and construction of the 
teacher’s desk is a matter of importance, but what is desirable 
in this respect depends much upon the nature of the work.
-P-A-G-E-47
  LESSON V 30 
Many teachers prefer to have their desks in the rear of the room, 
the teacher coming forward to conduct classes. There are dis- 
ciplinary advantages in this arrangement during the study 
periods. Then, too, it gives the raom the atmosphere of a place 
in which to work, rather than merely a place in which to recite. 
There is nothing about the situation which tends to set the 
  
      
    
Fic. 10. A Poorly Placed Blackboard 
This shows a room in which the only blackboard space is located in the rear of the 
room. Notice the effect of cross lighting on the board at the right 
teacher apart from the group. It at least symbolizes his task 
of working with the pupils in their mastery of problems in con- 
trast with that of merely hearing recitations. Moreover, pupils 
at work can be observed better, for it is more difficult for them 
to watch the teacher while they are planning mischief. 
The teacher’s desk should be large and should be provided 
with drawers so arranged and constructed that books and papers 
may be stored away conveniently. The desk with books and

Blackboards. The student should first observe the location 
and amount of blackboard space. This should extend around 
the three sides of the room not containing windows. The proper 
height from the floor will depend upon the grade of pupils

This blackboard is so situated that it is of almost no use. It is poorly lighted, 
and the writing on it could not be read from many seats, even though it were 
well lighted 
observed. Edward R. Shaw gives this height as 26 inches for 
primary children, 30 inches for intermediate-grade children, 
and 36 inches for grammar-grade children. Estimating upon 
this basis we can set the height for high-school pupils at about 
40 inches. 
Slate is the most desirable of the blackboard materials. It is 
not injured by washing and offers at all times an even surface.
-P-A-G-E-49
  LESSON V 37 
The color of the board should be either a dull black or black 
with a very slight tint of green; dark brown and gray are un- 
desirable.t As chalk dust is a possible source of physical ills 
its danger should be minimized by having a deep trough, cov- 
ered with woven wire, along the bottom of the board. This 
screen should be placed on hinges so that frequent cleaning of 
the trough is possible.

8. Can the seat be raised and lowered? (This is necessary both 
or sweeping and for getting in and out of the seats.)

he rear edge of the desk lids and the front edge of the seats. (This 
should be about two inches of minus distance, or, in other words, 
bout two inches of overlapping.) 
1In general the most satisfactory color is a dull black. A very slight tint of 
reen renders the blackboard a little more satisfactory and a little less con- 
ipicuous, but it is so easy to use too much green that one hesitates to recom- 
end it. A decidedly green blackboard is very trying on the eyes and

The following is a sample report of an observation accom- 
panying Lesson V: 
      
At this observation particular attention was paid to the seating 
arrangements and blackboard facilities of the room. The windows 
are on the south side of the room, and the pupils seated on the north 
side of the room do not receive as much light as they should. How- 
ever, the electric lights are placed so as to furnish equal light to all. 
The seats are arranged in five rows with six seats in a row and face 
the short side of the room. The aisles are as wide as they could be 
and leave space between the body of seats and the blackboard. 
But the space between the body of seats and the blackboard is not 
wide enough to allow the teacher to pass behind the students easily 
when they are at the board. The teacher’s desk is well constructed 
and arranged. There are large drawers on either side in which 
books and papers can be placed. The children’s desks are not 
adjustable. They certainly should be, as the size of the pupils in 
this grade varies considerably. For instance, there is one very
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
small boy in the class which I am observing whose seat is entirely 
too high for him. There is plenty of room in the desks for books 
and papers, thereby leaving the desk free on top for class work. 
The seats can be raised so as to enable the janitor to sweep 
thoroughly under them. 
The blackboards are so placed that they can be seen without 
facing the light. Writing on the board can be seen from any part of 
the room if the letters and figures are of medium size. There are 
three walls used for blackboards. The windows are on the fourth 
side. The blackboards are of black slate and are placed about thirty 
inches from the floor. There is no covering of woven wire on the 
trough at the bottom of the board to aid in preventing the circula- 
tion of chalk dust. I think such an arrangement would be very 
advisable in any room where a great deal of work is done at the 
board. The pupils’ health would be greatly safeguarded as well 
as that of the teacher.

  LESSON VI 
| Aim. To become conscious of the esthetic needs of the class- 
room and to develop ideals with respect to them. 
Training in neatness and in esthetic experience in general 
an important part of the child’s total education. Training in 
neatness and in esthetic experience in general is as truly a part 
of the total education of the child as are reading, writing, 
arithmetic, and other fundamentals. It is a part of our system | 
of reactions which either fit or unfit us for the business of living. 
Hence the teacher must be continually watchful lest undesir- 
able reactions in these fields be the outcome of school training. 
Our method is clear. We learn to be neat by being neat and 
hearing neatness applauded; we learn to like good music by 
hearing good music, and to appreciate the beautiful in art by 
observing it. Therefore it is important that the schoolroom 
floor be kept free from paper, that the books be placed neatly 
in the desks, that the pictures on the wall be well selected and 
artistically arranged. 
Ideals alone insufficient to produce reactions leading to neat- 
ness. If you have ever observed a badly trained individual mak- 
ing efforts to be neat you have no doubt wondered why that 
which seemed the result of so little effort on the part of a few 
caused so much effort on the part of others. Let us attempt to 
locate at least a part of the difficulty. Take as an example an 
untidy man working at a desk in his office. Papers are littered 
about. The contents of the desk drawers are topsy-turvy. The 
wastebasket beside him has been partially emptied and its con- 
tents scattered over the floor. He has been looking for lost 
papers. He is sitting back in his swivel chair, reflecting, when 
41
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
his eyes fall upon the neat desk of the neighbor who is work- 
ing beside him. The comparison with his own desk brings 
the ever-recurring determination to keep it looking like those 
about him. With this thought in mind he sets to work put- 
ting the waste paper back into the basket, filing letters, and 
arranging the articles upon the desk and within the drawers. 
  
  
      
Fic. 12. A Tidy Classroom 
The pupils have left everything in perfect order 
Once all is in order he compliments himself on having as neat 
a desk as there is in the office and goes about the regular routine 
of work. But in doing so he needs papers that he has carefully 
put away. These are brought forth. Others are needed, and 
in his haste he forgets to put back those which he has just used 
and with which he is through. In short, he soon finds that his 
desk is as badly littered as before. Once more he thinks of 
neatness, but this time gives up in despair.
-P-A-G-E-55
LESSON VI 43 
Now what is the difference between him and his neighbor 
whose desk is always neat? He has ideals of néatness which 
are, perhaps, stronger than those of his neighbor. He really 
desires to be neat and thinks of neatness oftener than his neigh- 
bor does. But the reactions that produce neatness in his case 
are on the conscious level. He is a busy man; his mind must

be continually thinking of neatness; and as a result he reaps 
the reward of one in whom reactions leading to neatness are 
entirely upon the conscious level. Not so with his neighbor. 
He needs to make no conscious effort, for his early training has 
been such that his more or less unconscious reactions take care 
of the matter.
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
Neatness a matter of being neat in innumerable situations. 
Another characteristic of neatness is that its basis lies in in- 
numerable specific reactions. Observing neatness in one situa-. 
tion gives but little indication of a general tendency toward 
neatness. A study carried out a few years ago showed that 
training in neatness in the written work of one subjéct gave no 
indication of improved neatness in the written work of another 
subject. Neatness in language work does not assure one of 
neatness in arithmetic. Neatness in the matter of hanging up 
one’s wraps may be accompanied by lack of neatness in the 
matter of one’s personal appearance. I have observed a peculiar 
neatness reaction in myself. I am greatly annoyed by an un- 
tidy classroom floor, so much so that, in the absence of a janitor, 
I have more than once gone about the room picking up scraps 
of paper before attempting to conduct my class. In looking for 
the source of this peculiar annoyance (for I am not generally 
observing of, or easily annoyed by, my environment) I recall 
that in the early years of my teaching experience in a one-room 
country school I had the task every evening of sweeping the 
floor. It seems that this experience had the effect of developing 
my neatness reaction with respect to classroom floors out of all 
proportion to other types of neatness reactions. It may be said 
that, while there is such a thing as a general ideal of neatness, 
one becomes neat in general by building up specific reaction 
patterns leading to neatness in innumerable specific situations. 
Neatness but one phase of esthetic training. A love for that 
which possesses orderliness, harmony, and beauty includes more 
than the neatness phase of training. Neatness is a part of one’s 
esthetic training in that it is concerned with the fitness of 
things. Of a higher order, but perhaps psychologically of the 
same nature, is response to the beautiful in nature, art, and 
literature. We learn to appreciate and enjoy fitness or harmony 
in color or tone in the same way that we learn to experience 
satisfaction in the orderliness of the physical things around
-P-A-G-E-57
  LESSON VI 45 
us. There is that in our nature which makes these satisfying 
responses possible. 
Basis for esthetic training in nature of man. Were I to 
draw a square 5 x 5 upon the board and place beside it an oblong 
of dimensions 3 x 5, the reader, upon request as to which was 
the more pleasing to look upon, without doubt would respond 
that the latter pleased him more. This cannot be explained. 
The difference may lie in the eye movements necessary to the 
complete visualization of the figures. However that may be, the 
fact remains. So it is, also, in the harmony of tones and colors. 
The basis for the pleasing and beautiful lies within us. 
Love of the beautiful an ultimate in life. Samuel Chester 
Parker, in his writings and lectures, attached considerable im- 
portance to enjoyment as an end of education, as the following 
quotation will indicate: 
The proper enjoyment of one’s leisure time deserves large consider- 
ation in a scheme of education for persons that do not have to spend 
all of their time in a struggle for existence. Certainly for a large part of 
any well-civilized community the problem presented by training for lei- 
sure is almost as pressing as the problem of training for efficiency. For 
example, consider the difficulties presented in this connection in such a 
large city as Chicago, in directing the leisure activities of boys and girls 
between fifteen and twenty-one years of age. Moreover, as we regard 
the successful effort of labor unions and publicists to get the working 
hours of employees reduced, it almost suggests that the reason for desiring 
efficiency is to secure leisure ; that the latter is the final purpose toward 
which efficiency is directed. 
Any survey of life’s values will reveal the fact that most of 
the objects for which we strive are in and of themselves of no 
worth. Many of them may be grouped under economic effi- 
ciency, which means, in the last analysis, the conquering of the 
elements that man may survive. Others may be grouped under 
civic-social efficiency, which means that men must have the ad- 
1Methods of Teaching in High Schools, pp. 17-18. Copyright by Ginn

  46 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
vantage of concerted effort in conquering environment. The 
latter is but a means to the former, which itself must be a means 
to a more worthy end, for surely otherwise man would have no 
more justification for his efforts than the lower animals. The 
remaining activities of men may be grouped under cultural 
efficiency, and these justify life and all man’s effort to attain 
them. Without them nothing would be worth the effort. They 
are the content for which all others are but form and structure. 
Hence an appreciation of the beautiful as a type of cultural 
reaction becomes very important. It is one of the ultimately 
valuable abilities for which children can be trained. 
Love of the beautiful but one type of enjoyment. There are 
many forms of enjoyment; and though they may be ranked as 
to degrees of worth, all in proper amounts which in no way 
injure others or ourselves are surely good. To enjoy a good 
meal, to feel the thrill of a game, to listen to or render a piece of 
music, to appreciate the symmetry and beauty of a work of art, 
to sit beneath evening skies and contemplate the vastness of the 
heavens, are ascending values in appreciation and enjoyment. 
Love of the beautiful one of life’s richest sources of enjoy- 
ment. As has been indicated above, there are degrees of appre- 
ciation and enjoyment; but love of the beautiful ranks high 
among them, surpassed, perhaps, only by love of wisdom and 
understanding. Like most real values it costs little or nothing 
and takes nothing from the world’s store of goods. Its posses- 
sion by one does not mean its denial to another. Nature abounds 
with beauty—mountains, plains, valleys, lakes, and sunsets. 
They are before us ; we need only observe and enjoy. However, 
this vast storehouse containing treasures of enjoyment needs 
unlocking for most of us. 
Love of the beautiful an outcome of training. At this point 
I recall early associations with a student of art who at that 
time annoyed me with many references to the beauties of sun- 
sets. For me a sunset was nothing more nor less than the sun’s
-P-A-G-E-59
LESSON VI 47 
going down. Those associations had their effect, for sunsets 
since then have been a source of real pleasure. So with other 
types of beauty: most of us must have our attention called to 
them or they forever escape our notice. Then, too, we must ex- 
perience them again and again. Beauty may have an objective 
basis, but our appreciation of the beautiful is highly subjective 
and must grow through experiencing the beautiful. 
School buildings and grounds should be as attractive as the 
best-kept homes. The days of the little red schoolhouse are 
over, and it is well that this is so. Children may learn to read 
and write in a place destitute of all beauty, but such a place is 
totally unsuited to the purpose of teaching pupils to live through 
living or to appreciate the beautiful through experiencing it. 
The architecture of a school building should conform to prin- 
ciples of art; pictures hung within should be selected with a 
view to developing taste in the pupil; the school yard should 
be well kept. The teacher and pupils are not helpless in the 
matter of beautifying buildings and grounds even though a 
thoughtless community has placed upon them the handicap of 
an unattractive building. Good pictures can be obtained, the 
yard may be cleaned, and other improvements made. 
Beautifying schoolroom and grounds should be a schoolroom 
project. It is not enough that the schoolroom and grounds be 
made beautiful; the beautifying of the premises should be 
utilized as material with which to give interest and experience 
in making things beautiful. Let the pupils participate in the 
selection of pictures and the ways and means of obtaining them. 
The experience of organizing themselves for the purpose of 
cleaning the yard will be in itself the finest sort of educational 
activity. Pupils should make judgments relative to the placing 
of pictures. Committees may be appointed by the pupils to keep ~ 
certain vases full of flowers, others to care for flower beds in the 
yard. In this way the pupils may learn to select and arrange 
flowers with a view to principles of beauty and to take interest 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
48 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
and pride in doing so. The teacher, who has more experience 
than the rest, will act as a member of the group. He will advise 
when called upon and when necessary will suggest improve- 
ments. It will often be necessary for him to initiate an under- 
taking, but as rapidly as is consistent with progress he should 
allow the pupils to take the responsibility themselves. 
Pictures should be suitable to the age of the pupils. The pic- 
tures selected should not be above the interpretation level of 
the child. Pictures of little children, of animals with which 
children are familiar, etc. are suitable to the primary grades. 
The following list is representative of those suitable: 
Feeding her Birds (Millet) 
Four Kittens (T. Adam) 
The First Step (Millet) 
Can’t you Talk ? (Holmes) 
The basis of the above selection lies in the fact that little 
children are interested in things in relation to themselves. An 
incident is told which illustrates this truth. A lamb was brought 
into the presence of primary children for the purpose of nature 
study. The questions asked by the children were about as 
follows: “Where can I get one?” “Will he bite me?” “Can 
I take him home?” No interest was taken in the purpose of 
his wool or the set of his ears. 
The following is a suggestive list of pictures suitable to 
intermediate and grammar-school grades: 
The Angelus (Millet) 
The Gleaners (Millet) 
Song of the Lark (Breton) 
Return to the Farm (Troyon) 
The custom is generally followed in high schools of placing in 
the various classrooms appropriate portraits of famous leaders 
of thought and action, for the purpose of giving a proper atmos- 
phere for the work. A picture of Euclid is commonly found in 
   
-P-A-G-E-61
  
LESSON VI 49 
rooms in which mathematics is taught; of Agassiz, Huxley, or 
Tyndall in rooms in which biology is taught ; and of Washing- 
ton, Lincoln, Napoleon, or Cromwell in rooms in which history is 
taught. This is desirable, as those pictures lend distinctiveness 
to the atmosphere of the various rooms. The assembly room, 
  
  
      
Fic. 14. Suitable Pictures Well Displayed 
The subject matter of these pictures is suited to the age of the pupils, and the 
pictures are properly hung and spaced 
however, whether upper-grade or high-school, should contain 
reproductions of the best masterpieces in painting and sculpture. 
Children should be aided in interpreting pictures. A teacher 
in commenting upon the interpretation of pictures to pupils 
said, “As a child my uncle, who cared much for the ‘Song of the 
Lark,’ in calling my attention to the picture told me its mean- 
ing. He first told me the story as follows: ‘A girl going to her 
work early in the morning is suddenly attracted by the song of 
a lark. She pauses to listen.’ He then called my attention to
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
the expression upon the girl’s face, to the harmony of coloring, 
and to fine points of the picture in general. Since then I have 
always cared much for the ‘Song of the Lark.’” There is a 
lesson in this for teachers. It is not sufficient that beautiful 
pictures hang in the room or that classical music be rendered 
before the class. The taste will develop much more rapidly if

The subject matter of these pictures is more suited to the grammar than to the pri- 
mary grades. There are too many pictures, and they are neither evenly hung nor 
properly spaced 
the teacher aids in interpreting the artist. It might be well to 
use morning exercises once in a while for the purpose of in- 
terpreting pictures in the rooms. At times it will be possible to} 
borrow pictures, which may be studied and allowed to hang| 
before the pupils for a few*days. This is good practice, as, if 
properly carried out, it will arouse a wider interest in pictures| 
than would otherwise be possible and at the same time will] 
strengthen the pupils’ appreciation of many pictures.
-P-A-G-E-63
  LESSON VI 51 
Teacher and pupils must guard against overdecoration of 
the schoolroom. The hanging of one picture often means that 
another must come down. A schoolroom is not an art gallery. It 
is an easy matter to overdecorate. Then, too, pictures must be 
selected with respect to the amount of wall space available for 
the picture. A large picture in a small space or a small picture 
in a large space may spoil the general effect of the picture as a 
schoolroom decoration.

The following is a sample report of an observation accom- 
panying Lesson VI: 
    
During this period special attention was given to the esthetic 
aspects of the classroom. The floor was fairly clean; however, 
chalk dust could be seen around the edges, and small scraps of 
paper lay in the aisles. But the condition of the floor was not 
especially offensive, considering the fact that the class which I was 
observing was a fifth-hour class, which is the last one for the day. 
If the pupils in the previous classes had been taught the importance 
of neatness, there might have been no paper on the floor. The 
teacher’s desk was tidy but rather dusty. With the windows open 
all day it would be rather difficult to keep anything dusted. The 
teacher keeps on his desk a large blotter, a card with the pupils’ 
names, and the class textbook. Most of the pupils’ desks are neat 
enough on top but are filled inside with wads of yellow paper. This 
condition of the desks makes an unpleasant effect upon anyone sit- 
ting at the back of the room. 
The pupils should be made to throw their waste paper in the 
basket and keep the inside of the desks clear, so their books could 
be placed there. There are no ink stains on the desks, probably 
due to the fact that the pupils use pencils, and there are no ink- 
wells in the desks. The tops of the desks are in good condition and
-P-A-G-E-65
  LESSON VI 53 
seem to be kept that way. The walls are very clean and look as 
if they had just been decorated before the school term ac this 
fall. There are no pictures in the room. 
On the whole, the room is well cared for, makes a pits appear-_ 
ance, and gives one the impression that the children evidently get | 
some training in neatness. The only fault is found in the untidi- 
ness of the inside of the desks. With a little training and attention 
to this fault, I believe it could be readily overcome. 
The office, corridors, and auditorium are clean and newly deco- 
rated. A large sculptured model of a piece of Greek statuary is 
placed at the head of the front stairs on the first landing and does 
much to beautify the main entrance to the building. Reproduc- 
tions of many of the best paintings are hung at properly spaced in- 
tervals throughout the corridors. These were donated by various 
graduating classes, a fact which gives the pupils added interest 
in them. The auditorium presents a pleasing appearance. It is 
well equipped and its acoustic qualities are good. This makes 
it possible for the pupils to take full advantage of musical enter- 
tainments and to put on plays and musicales of their own. 
The architecture of the building in general is pleasing from either 
an internal or external view. The building occupies an entire city 
block of ground and is surrounded by well-kept lawns.
-P-A-G-E-66
LESSON VII 
Aim. To appreciate characteristics of the teacher which have a 
bearing upon his relation to the pupils and to form ideals 
relative to a teacher’s dress, manners, voice, poise, knowl- 
edge of subject matter, etc. 
Perhaps the most important determinant in the whole school- 
room situation is the teacher himself. His dress and behavior 
either set new standards or modify for good or ill those already 
formed by the pupils. The teacher whose dress and habits are 
correct is likely to be dimly conscious of the fact and, as a re- 
sult, to be more self-possessed and at ease before his class. 
Furthermore, he is in better position to demand neatness on the 
part of the pupils. 
Voice directly related to classroom atmosphere. The teacher 
with the high-pitched, rasping voice is almost certain to irritate 
the pupils, with the result that the room becomes noisy and 
disturbing. Bagley says, on this point: 
Probably superintendents and principals would generally agree that, 
next to inability to secure respectful obedience from pupils, most of the} 
trouble in discipline has its source in the voice of the teacher. The 
temptation to speak to the children in a high-pitched, rasping voice i 
very hard to resist, especially when there is the least bit of noise or con: 
fusion in the classroom. As the teacher’s voice becomes louder an 
louder, the tumult increases in like proportions, until finally one mus 
shout in order to be heard. To one who tries, for the first time, the re 
medial measure of a low voice in such a situation, the result is a littl 
less than astounding. As the teacher lowers his voice, the hubbub gradu 
ally dies away, and almost before one is conscious of the change, quie 
and order have succeeded confusion and chaos.*

  LESSON VII 55 
Poise of teacher a factor in discipline. Let us consider the 
poise of, the teacher with respect to his bearing upon the ideal 
schoolroom situation. It is difficult to say just what factors 
enter into good poise. Yet we must analyze the complex if we 
are to attempt to cultivate it, for it is only by improving in the 
unitary elements that improvement in the ‘whole function can 
be made. ; 
One of the most important components of poise is ability to 
control the emotions. The teacher who betrays emotions of 
anger, fear, extreme sympathy, and the like is apt to find the 
pupils deliberately contriving to obtain such expressions from 
him. The ability to sympathize, for example, must be in the 
background, for when displayed in its extreme form it is likely 
to repel many and unduly excite the feelings of others. Excit- 
ability in a teacher tends to give a schoolroom an atmosphere of 
tension, which is likely to produce similar reactions on the part 
of the pupils. Irritability likewise interferes with the normal 
functioning of the school activities and tends to produce the 
same condition in the pupils. The question of self-confidence 
also comes in for its share of consideration. The shy teacher 
who lacks self-confidence has a decided handicap. He does not 
do justice to his ability, and hence would fall short of his best 
work even though there were no observable effect upon the 
pupils. But the pupils are affected. They are inspired to con- 
fidence in a teacher partly through the teacher’s confidence 
in himself. In other words, leadership is impossible where self- 
confidence is lacking. 
One is too often inclined to say that these are inherited quali- 
ties and hence may be observed but not improved. This is 
doubtful. Granting that there is perhaps an instinctive basis 
for such reaction, there is evidence that modification is possible. 
The question is how. Psychology offers a suggestion. Look 
straight into the eyes of those with whom you are speaking and, 
even though it requires a great effort, go through the outward 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
manifestations of boldness of reaction and you may expect in 
time to find timidity vanishing. Control the outward reactions 
and the inner reactions or feelings will tend to conform. 
The teacher should radiate enthusiasm. Does the teacher 
radiate enthusiasm or depression? While this matter is an im- 
portant one, its control must be got at more indirectly. It is 
impossible for one with a dark outlook on life to create enthusi- 
asm in those about him. The teacher should have those high 
professional ideals and ambitions which alone give zest to life. 
This attitude may be obtained by reading professional liter- 
ature and attending teachers’ conventions and by other ideal- 
giving activities. 
Tact a factor in discipline. With respect to tact, much has 
been written which is likely to be misleading. The teacher 
should ever bear in mind that tact does not mean playing petty 
politics. The teacher whose purposes are high and who has the 
well-being of his pupils at heart is not likely to speak a harsh 
and cutting word; neither is he likely to neglect his duty toward 
the entire student body. His dealings with pupils are likely to 
be fair and impersonal. On the other hand, the teacher must 
weigh and consider his actions, so that there can be no misun- 
derstanding of his intentions. 
Health of teacher a factor in classroom. No teacher whose 
health is at low ebb can be at his best in the classroom. School 
work entails a drain upon the vital energy, and a goodly supply 
of vitality must be at hand in the morning if one is to go 
through the day performing effectively the strenuous tasks of 
the teacher. The writer recalls an instance of a superintendent 
of schools who discovered that one of his teachers was in the 
last stage of tuberculosis. She had been concealing the fact 
in order to finish the term of school. It is needless to say that 
her work was unsatisfactory from the standpoint of accom- 
plishment ; and, what was vastly more important, she had ex- 
posed thirty children to one of the most fatal maladies. Of 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  
  LESSON VII. i 
course, such a teacher should be asked to resign immediately. 
In cases of a generally weakened condition, healthful habits, 
such as right eating and plenty of sleep, are usually all that are 
needed to fit the teacher for his tasks. 
_ Promptness of teacher in meeting and dismissing classes a 
factor in school morale. Promptness in meeting and dismissing 
classes not only saves time but enables the teacher with better 
grace to’demand promptness of the pupils. Promptness is per- 
haps needed more in our day of codperative undertakings than 
ever before. One man may delay the activity in a whole fac- 
tory. This fact makes promptness one of the vital outcomes of 
education. Another important consideration is the fact that the 
teacher who appears five minutes late before his class of thirty- 
six has wasted three hours of pupil-time. 
Teacher’s knowledge of subject matter an important factor 
in determining effectiveness. Whereas in the past we have, 
without doubt, overemphasized the importance of the knowl- 
edge of subject matter as contrasted with the pedagogical side 
of the teaching process, there is at present danger lest we over- 
look its importance. There is a certain amount of learning 
which is of necessity concerned with facts; and the teacher 
must be in possession of the facts if he is to do his work ade- 
quately. Knowledge has the added virtue of lending confidence 
to the teacher in possession of it. 
Intellectual honesty aids in creating wholesome teaching sit- 
uation. ‘“Bluffing” is sometimes resorted to by teachers whose 
knowledge is insufficient to meet the immediate demands of the 
class. This is very bad practice, for the pupils are almost cer- 
tain to be misinformed and the bluffer is commonly discovered 
sooner or later. It has been the general experience of school 
men that an honest “I don’t know” seldom imperils the pres- 
tige of the teacher. On the contrary, those who hear this once 
in a while are more likely to have confidence when the teacher 
says that so and so are the facts.

  58 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
Ability to use English fluently and correctly a valuable as- 
set. Since it is part of the teacher’s task to make the pupils 
conscious of their errors in English and to give them the desire 
to speak correctly, it is of the greatest importance that the 
teacher himself set correct standards. Although one may learn 
correct usage from grammar, the speaking of good English is 
largely a matter of imitating what we have heard.

The teacher in whose class I am observing is a fairly young man 
and dresses very neatly. There is nothing unusual or flashy about 
his clothes. He usually wears a dark suit, which is made in good 
style and which is very nice for the schoolroom. He has done very 
little work at the blackboard, and consequently I have not been 
able to judge his neatness in that line. The top of his desk is 
always neat. He has a medium-toned and firm voice. He speaks 
distinctly and rather rapidly. He is not irritable, yet at times he 
takes offense at certain things. He is not easily excited but is 
rather forward and gives one the impression that he is overseer

and boss in the room. He always looks squarely at the one to 
whom he is speaking. He always seems full of life and certainly 
radiates enthusiasm. He shows tact in dealing with the pupils. 
For example, there is a very small boy in the class who speaks very 
slowly and distinctly when explaining a problem, and he seems to 
afford amusement for the other pupils. One day after the little 
fellow had recited and there were grins on many faces, the teacher 
told the others that even if Ethan did do things that appeared odd 
to them, it might be well if they would all imitate his poise and 
deliberateness. The teacher seems to be in good health and nearly 
always cheerful. He is always self-composed, and his movements 
never indicate fatigue. He is very prompt in meeting and dismiss- 
ing his class. He seems to be master of the subject he is teaching 
and never needs to bluff. The teacher uses good English and on 
the whole seems well fitted for the work he is doing.

I consider the teacher whose class I am observing an unusually 
fine type in every respect. She displays a pleasing harmony of 
physical and mental characteristics. She is at all times neat, both 
in personal appearance and in her work ; her desk is well kept, and 
her board work is orderly. Her dress is artistic and in keeping 
with the service in which she is engaged. Furthermore, she pos- 
sesses a clear, pleasant voice which always remains even and which 
carries in it a note of enthusiasm that induces attention and in- 
‘terest. This teacher is at all times composed; her manner, which 
is direct, is characterized by a certain amount of tact and deference 
toward each individual, so that she commands the respect of the 
whole class. The pleasure she finds in her work is apparently due 
to her liking of it and probably also to her apparent good health. 
She possesses a good command of English and she quickly conveys 
the impression that she is master of her subject. There is no 
attempt to bluff on her part,—a characteristic which seems to 
have won the confidence and respect of the entire class.

LESSON VIII 
Aim. To obtain a proper concept of the purpose of routine and 
to become acquainted with effective means of establishing 
a desirable routine. 
Routine justified in adult society. If the socializing aim is a 
valuable one in our schools and if an ideal schoolroom society 
is one that approaches in citizenship principles the adult 
society into which the pupils are going after school days are 
over, then we must look to the amount and significance of the 
routine found in adult society as a guide in laying the basis for 
routine in classroom organization and control. All round us we 
find instances of routine. We put our left hand out of a car 
when slowing down, to signal to the driver behind us. We stand 
in line and await our turn when buying tickets at a railroad 
station; that is, good citizens do. We proceed in accordance 
with traffic signals at busy city crossings. So one might add 
indefinitely to the list of more or less well-routinized activities 
found in adult society. These will be needed in the schoolroom 
too, since school activities are social activities if properly 
carried on. 
Parker in Methods of Teaching in High Schools tells of an 
instance in a downtown district in Chicago in which, as an ex- 
periment, traffic policemen were removed for a few minutes from 
the crossings. The result was that in a short time traffic came 
to a standstill. This instance discloses a vital principle in all 
human organizations, be they autocratic or democratic in their 
conception ; namely, a maximum of freedom for all individually 
or collectively demands at least a minimum of restraint on the 
part of each member individually.

-P-A-G-E-74
  62 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
Routine not to curb individual initiative that is not incom- 
patible with social projects. It is true that when we set up bar- 
riers to activity in any form, by that act we limit individual 
initiative. But this is a necessary process whenever many units 
are working to one end. The direction and extent of motion of 
the pistons of an automobile are fully defined in terms of the 
rest of the machine. Only in the chaos of wreckage can the 
parts of a unit break the bounds of the functioning machine. So 
it is in human society. Complete individual initiative can exist 
only where social chaos reigns. We must adjust our activities 
to those of the group in which we are to function. 
But in the social machine—and in this it differs from the 
mechanical—the adjustment to the other units is a small, 
though important, part of the total activity of each unit. Within 
this adjustment there is a wide range for spontaneity of effort. 
Were it not for this fact human organization would be’as worth- 
less as it would be undesirable. The form here, as elsewhere, 
exists only that the content may be enhanced. It in itself is a 
tool and has no more intrinsic value than has any other tool. 
Routinized form in schoolroom to enhance individuality and 
initiative in thought and action. A question often asked is 
Will not the routinization of the schoolroom activity tend to 
check individuality and initiative in the pupils? This might 
very well be, were not routine limited to the form which must 
precede thought and action. For example, it is often necessary 
to pass out materials to a class before taking up the lesson 
of the day. Well-routinized procedure enables the pupils to 
get the material before them with the least possible loss of 
time and energy. Once the material is before the class, the real, 
or content, activity begins. Routine has for the time being ac- 
complished its work. To proceed farther on a routinized basis 
would turn routine into an end rather than a means. Routine 
should merely aid in setting before the pupils opportunities for| 
educational experience.
-P-A-G-E-75
  
LESSON VIII 63 
It is, of course, true that the routinized activities themselves, 
though their purpose is to enhance content activity, become 
educational experiences because, as was said in substance above, 
the ability to set up and conform properly to needed routine is 
itself a worth-while and necessary outcome of education. 
Restraint should result from social effort to enhance freedom 
and progress of all, individually and collectively. To one using 
surface reflection only, the traffic policeman may represent a 
despotic form of control. But further and deeper thinking re- 
veals the fact that he is only exercising a function which we as 
citizens have placed upon him as a duty. It is this considera- 
tion that distinguishes democratic from autocratic control. So 
in the classroom we shall need rules and regulations to enhance 
both individual and collective activity. We should look upon 
this fact as an opportunity to give pupils experience in exer- 
cising judgment in the making of rules and regulations and 
self-control in obeying them. Such socially made rules and 
regulations in operation in the school teach the child through 
effective living in his schoolroom society to live in adult society. 
(Conforming to the requirements of a good citizen, then, becomes 
a habit with the child. It is not a matter of an intellectual 
sanction alone, nor, on the other hand, one of blind obedi- 
lence as to an autocrat. He will appreciate more fully the need 
of regulations by having participated in the making of them 
from early childhood and will have developed habits of con- 
forming to them once they are made, though he personally voted 
in the negative. This aids preparation for living through living. 
Rules and regulations for a society of children should fit pres- 
nt needs of group. One of the objections to defining education 
las a preparation for life is that it is ambiguous as to the “how,” 
nd as a result many attempt to imitate adult society in the 
choolroom. This of course can be accomplished only by strain- 
ng the naturalness of the life of the immature group and by 
dding undue pressure from an external source. The amount 
     
    
     
     
     
    
   
    
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
and form of routine in a primary room may very well differ from 
that desirable in a high school. In the first place, little children 
need and can tolerate more easily the social restrictions placed 
about them. At any age it is not so much the following of rules 
and regulations that is likely to be obnoxious and badly suited 
to the ends of education as it is that those rules and regulations 
come from above. The teacher should lend his efforts to the 
end that the rules and regulations may come from the pupils 
asa body. The working out of the routine needed will form the 
very best possible disciplinary experience for the pupils. 
Routine as means, never as end. It is very important that the 
proposition of establishing routine should be placed before the 
pupils as a means to some desirable end. They should feel also 
that the ends justify the means. This will aid in the establishing 
of needed rules and will tend to develop in the pupils a pride and 
interest in carrying out rules. They become pupil projects, and as 
in adult society the pupils as a group will consider the violation 
of rules a blocking of group enterprise. The rules may differ from 
those of adult society, just as those of one adult group may differ 
from those of another; but the underlying principles of estab- 
lishing and carrying them out are the same. Hence the activity 
involved in routine becomes not only a means to a classroom 
end but, more important still, a curricular activity lookin 
forward to the establishing of the ideals and habits of goo 
citizenship. 
Young children and needed routine. The ability of youn’ 
children to establish and carry out needed routine may b 
learned by observing children at play. They seem capable i 
this case, even without the aid of the teacher (which is mor 
than we have recommended above), of establishing rules ani 
obeying them with the greatest of interest and exactness. W 
adults are constantly amazed at the extent to which childre 
under proper conditions are capable of organizing themselve 
into groups and carrying out activities, each playing his part. 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  LESSON VIII 65 
Breaches of established routine and means of preventing 
their recurrence. In keeping with the effort to democratize and 
socialize all schoolroom activity, all flagrant breaches of estab- 
lished rules should be placed before the social group or its 
appointed representatives for a decision as to the amount of 
injury done the group and ways and means of preventing its 
recurrence. For the teacher to take all such matters entirely 
into his own hands is to deny the group those experiences which 
it should have if the members are to learn to live in society. 
This phase of social training is quite as important as that 
involved in the socialized recitation. 
Amount of student self-government which can be introduced. 
A word of warning is in point here. I have outlined above an 
ideal of schoolroom discipline toward which I believe all 
teachers should strive, but I realize that for many communities 
it can be but an ideal for many years to come. The ability to 
exercise group autonomy in civic and social matters is not lying 
dormant in the sense that it can be awakened at a moment’s 
notice. High-school pupils, for example, who have had only 
such experience in group self-control as their unsupervised play 
and games have given are capable of but limited self-government 
in the schoolroom. Such self-government as they can exercise 
should be introduced gradually; but caution will have to be 
used lest one overestimate their trained capacity. One must 
have order ; and to get it in an autocratic manner is preferable 
to not getting it at all. Student self-control will have to be 
rought about largely through a superintendence which initiates 
it in the lower grades, thus fitting upper-grade pupils for it. 
The home training and general intellectual capacity of the 
upils are factors to be reckoned with at this point. Pupils who 
ome from homes in which discipline is either entirely lacking 
r of a low order will be at a decided disadvantage in adjusting 
hemselves to group enterprise. It may be necessary to deal 
ith a few such pupils apart from the group.

       For the most part the class activities in the room in which I was 
lobserving seemed to be well routinized. The pupils upon arriving 
lat the school might, if they wished, go to the classroom. Leaving 
their wraps in an adjoining cloakroom, they had to go directly to 
their seats and-begin work. The teacher was at her desk ready to 
elp those who asked for aid. When the time for the reading period 
rrived the teacher took the necessary number of readers from the 
ase and put as many on each front seat as there were pupils in 
hat row. The child in that seat immediately began the work of 
istributing the books, leaving one on the desk of each pupil behind 
im. This was done quietly by the pupils. The result was that 
he books were distributed and the class ready for work in less 
han one minute. Routine, however, in this room does not seem 
o be carried to the extreme of serving no purpose but its own. The 
ioment a book was placed upon the desk the child was free to pick 
t up or leave it there until a topic for reading was announced. 
me can conceive of routine being carried to the extent of giving 
signal for picking up books. This would seem to the observer to 
e carrying on form to no purpose and likely to lend a machinelike 
tmosphere to the room.

When the lesson was over, the child at the back of each row 
immediately began the task of bringing books forward. The books 
were collected with the same facility with which they were passed. 
There was no evidence that the established routine was the result 
of group enterprise. While the routine was carried out with clock- 
like efficiency it seemed to have been the result of teacher rather 
than pupil planning.

In observing a class which is studying literature there is little 
opportunity, to observe routine work, since most of the time is 
occupied with discussion. There are, however, a few little points 
in which routine serves to good advantage. At a certain time after 
the class has assembled a bell rings, which serves as a signal to 
begin work. The class responds to it and immediately directs its 
attention to the teacher. The pupils are assigned to seats alpha- 
betically. Written work is required on uniform paper in pen and| 
ink, and the teacher has requested that the notebooks be of uniform] 
size and kind. Lists of authors and books for outside reading ar 
posted on the bulletin board, to which pupils may refer in smal 
groups. At the end of a thirty-five-minute period of recitation 
bell rings as a signal to begin the study period.  
-P-A-G-E-81
LESSON IX 
Aim. To appreciate methods of discipline and to develop ideals 
of discipline. 
Discipline a function of total teaching process. One may not 
speak of a teacher as a good teacher but a poor disciplinarian, 
for good discipline is closely related to good teaching. The 
teacher who is really teaching will generally have fairly good 
order, and one may be quite certain that continuous disorder is 
the result of faulty organization and technique in the process of 
attacking the lesson. For example, the history teacher whose 
questions are largely factual, who asks too many questions, and 
who directs them to individuals rather than to the class, will 
seldom if ever have order. He does not utilize the pupils’ think- 
ing power and hence does not command their attention. He 
may, through utilizing largely the emotion of fear, compel that 
which will pass with the uninitiated as good classroom order. 
But it is on the surface only. Pupils’ attention and interest 
must be roused through the application of pedagogical principles. 
(Keeping discipline a matter of directing pupils’ energy. 
‘Whether we are considering the recitation or the study period, 
the keeping of order is a function of the teacher’s ability to 
utilize fully the energy of the pupils. They will be doing some- 
thing all the time. The teacher’s task is that of directing this 
lenergy into proper channels. He cannot and should not attempt 
to suppress its flow. If the pupils did not react to stimuli they 
vould not be teachable. Instead of looking upon this manifes- 
tation of life and energy as something inimical to teaching, the 
eacher should look upon it as his opportunity. It is to the 
eaching process what the action of water is to placer mining. 
69
-P-A-G-E-82
70 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
Nothing could be done without it, but success lies in the direct- 
ing of the stream. Hence the teacher’s task is in part that of 
attempting to keep all the pupils busy all the time. 
Individual differences in interests and capacity a source of 
disciplinary problems. It is not easy, or even possible, to keep 
all the pupils busy all the time. Even though the lesson is being 
taught perfectly, there will be exceptional instances in which 
pupils will disturb the class. There is the dull pupil who will 
not be interested in what is going on, because he does not under- 
stand. On the other hand, there is the bright pupil who will 
have seen through the problem long in advance of the rest 
and who is likely to be the center of mischief. Extra work 
can be assigned to the bright pupils during the study period, 
but during the recitation most of the,discussion must fit the 
capacities of the large middle rot Niles disciplinary de- 
vices other than that of good teaching must now and then be 
brought into playi 
General principles governing selection and use of disciplinary 
devices. The teacher must learn through experience the devices 
which he can use most effectively. Likewise he must develop 2 
technique suited to his personality. Fortunately, however 
there are principles governing the selection and use of device: 
which have considerable general validity. The beginning teacher 
can adopt these as rough tools, modifying them and refining hi: 
technique in the use of them as he gathers experience. ‘ 
, Keep disciplinary means in background. The first of these 
principles is that of keeping a considerable reserve of disci. 
plinary processes in the background. The teacher who sends 4 
pupil to the principal has lifted the curtain on the stage of hi: 
reserve. The pupils now are consciously aware that nothing 
more drastic awaits misbehavior; and, if the principal proves 
to be easy, the teacher has lost much if not all of his ability t 
bring the unruly pupil to order through the motive of fear. I 
the teacher is at his wit’s end, it is much more effective to as
-P-A-G-E-83
  LESSON Ix 71 
the pupil to remain after school ; then the pupil, principal, and 
teacher may talk the matter over, both the principal and the 
teacher keeping considerable in reserve. 
Keep eyes upon class. The teacher who watches the floor or 
his textbook while teaching greatly increases the likelihood of 
losing the attention of the class. We like to look into the eyes 
of those who are talking with us. What they say is likely to 
have more meaning. The voice of one looking at the floor is 
not so likely to carry well, and hence causes the pupils to lose 
interest because they do not understand) Then, too, the effect 
of looking squarely at the individual who is about to cause 
disturbance generally has a preventing power which only the 
experienced teacher can appreciate. 
Waiting for order. The device of stopping for a minute and 
waiting for order, meanwhile keeping the face straight and the 
eyes fixed intently upon the disturber of the peace, is often very 
effective. The writer recalls an incident which occurred while 
e was visiting a freshman class in college. Two or three girls 
egan giggling over something that amused them. The instruc- 
or stopped the discussion immediately and with a serious ex- 
ression on his face looked steadily at the girls for about thirty 
econds. The result was very effective. Even the visitor felt 
ncomfortable. All were sitting in expectancy of something that 
id not happen. At the end of about thirty seconds the lesson 
yas continued, but with no more giggling. 
Anticipating trouble. The teacher will do well to anticipate 
rouble and attempt to forestall it. Certain pupils should not 
permitted to sit near one another. John is ordinarily a well- 
ehaved boy, but he and James have too much in common. If 
hey are permitted to sit near one another the temptation to 
communicate is too great, and class disturbance is inevitable. 
Element of suspense. It is difficult to overestimate the im- 
ortance of the element of suspense in a disciplinary situation.

72, OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
the punishment which is to follow wrongdoing misses the biggest 
part of that punishment. Waiting for dad to come home is 
worse than that which follows. The child told to remain after 
school is not only likely to cause no more trouble that day but 
to remember longer and with more displeasure the punishment 
which followed the deed. This procedure will tend also to pre- 
vent the teacher’s losing his temper before the class. 
Knowing pupils and parents personally. Many a difficult case 
of discipline fades away, once the teacher really comes to know 
the pupil and his parents. An intimate acquaintance with his 
father often has a mysterious effect upon John. Let us not de- 
ceive ourselves at this point into thinking that this effect is all 
owing to the fact that John fears his father and thinks the 
teacher likely to report his actions. Because of that acquaint- 
ance the teacher understands John better, and John feels that 
the teacher takes a personal interest in him. The bond of 
friendship which should spring up between pupil and teacher 
through personal acquaintance is too valuable to be overlooked 
in discussing situations which make teaching possible. 
Use of tact. Tact is so necessary in any situation in which 
one has to deal with people that its value has no special refer- 
ence to teachers. Delicate situations are always present. The 
_ feelings of one’s fellow men can be ruthlessly trampled upon or| 
carefully considered in any social situation. It is especiall 
possible for one occupying a commanding position to do either 
The teacher may be cutting in his remarks or he may be con 
siderate. Cutting remarks get him nowhere with the individua: 
to whom they are addressed and are certain to bring him the il 
will of the class. The following remark of a college studen' 
with respect to his teacher is in point here: ‘“‘He never sai 
anything to injure the feelings of any student ; he was too muc 
of a gentleman.” Such a feeling on the part of students mean 
much in creating a situation in which learning is possible. Th 
use of tact involves the intelligence to comprehend delicat  
-P-A-G-E-85
LESSON IX 73 
situations plus the habit of giving consideration to the feelings 
of those with whom we are dealing. 
Tact does not mean the surrender of one’s authority but 
rather the use of it with consideration. The tactless teacher 
usually surrenders considerable authority in attempting to re- 
gain the good will lost during tactless moments. Bagley has 
the following to say on this point: 
One should not understand by tact a willingness to surrender a single 
increment of the authority that belongs to one. But, after all, it is the re- 
sult that is important—the fact, not the form. If the teacher can pre- 
serve his authority without vaunting it upon all occasions, his path of life 
will run smoothly. Order and respect for his authority are the salient 
points. If these are secured, it matters little what people think, so long, 
of course, as their opinion has no injurious influence upon his work. In 
other words, there is no reason for a display of authority simply to em- 
phasize the fact of authority. Those who exercise the greatest power in 
the world are the very people who keep the fact from impinging continu- 
ally upon their neighbors’ consciousness.t 
Knowledge as a factor in discipline. Other things being equal, 
the individual with the more complete mastery of his subject 
will have a decided advantage in maintaining order. Pupils 
soon lose respect for the teacher who is often found lacking in 
knowledge of subject matter. If he is fully aware of the seri- 
ousness of his weakness, the embarrassment that will follow will 
cause him to lose sight of the matter of order. He directs his 
attention from the technique of teaching to the matter of solv- 
ing the problem himself. Under such conditions pupils turn 
their attention to other things. The teacher, being irritated at 
his inability fully to perform his function because of lack of 
knowledge, is likely to say cutting things and in other ways to 
undermine the pupil’s respect for him. Then, too, knowing 
one’s subject adds poise and dignity to one’s bearing, and makes

it much easier for one to be patient, sympathetic, and kind in 
one’s dealings with the pupils. 
Many unprepared teachers take the fatal horn of the dilemma 
and attempt to bluff. The teacher who does this not only loses 
his self-respect but is sure to be found out sooner or later by 
the pupils. When once he is found to be bluffing, a certain “dis- 
count” is almost sure to be made for all that he may say hence- 
forth. Were he fully aware of the almost certainly disastrous 
effects which follow he would do no bluffing but would readily 
admit his lack of information on the point under consideration 
and strive the harder so to prepare his lessons that it should 
never occur again. This manner of dealing with the situation 
makes it possible not only to regain the ground lost but actually 
to strengthen himself, for the pupils will be more likely to take 
his future statements of fact as from one who would readily 
admit any doubt. This is a desirable situation and can be 
obtained only by frankly confessing one’s ignorance when neces- 
sary, at the same time making every effort to prevent the fre- 
quent occurrence of such necessity. 
Proper routine makes for better discipline. The confusion 
that results from lack of a proper amount of routine not only 
wastes time but lures the pupils into conversations and interests 
which tend to break down the classroom discipline. The pass- 
ing out or collecting of papers, for example, should be done 
according to form and with dispatch. This does not mean that 
all activity should be routinized. There should be plenty of 
room for initiative but at points less fatal to classroom order, 
or, in other words, less likely to lead to individual activity and 
interest which run counter to the immediate aim of the group. 
Care must be taken that only those activities are routinized 
which are in the main preparatory to educative processes. The 
passing of papers, the getting of wraps, or the passing of lines 
in the hallways are not primarily training activities; yet the 
may be routinized so as to facilitate the more properly curricula:
-P-A-G-E-87
  LESSON IX 75 
activities. On the other hand, routinization may be easily car- 
ried too far in the manual-training shop or the regular classroom 
where the processes are more truly educative and where initia- 
tive and individuality of reaction are invaluable. 
Corporal punishment. Educators are well agreed that cor- 
poral punishment should not extend beyond the elementary 
| school. Only in rare instances should it be recommended above 
‘the primary grades. One can conceive of cases in the inter- 
‘mediate grades where rightly administered corporal punishment 
might enable the teacher to keep the child until such a time as 
he can get a hold upon him through other channels. Where 
corporal punishment is used with small children, spanking has 
the fewest objections. This should be done after school, pref- 
erably in the presence of another teacher or the principal, but 
never before the class. On the matter of corporal punishment 
Professor Sears has the following to say: 
Corporal punishment is not only wise but necessary under certain con- 
ditions. A child whose home training has been coarse and brutal, and 
who has never had an opportunity to develop respect for anything except 
physical strength, is practically incapacitated for understanding any 
other type of punishment than that which demonstrates the teacher’s 
superior physical strength and her willingness to use it on offenders. Such 
a child is to be pitied, and though such punishment will be temporarily 
necessary to bring him within the reach of better influences, yet, as 
rapidly as possible it should be dispensed with, and the child should be 
made to feel himself a member of a group which is bound together not 
by force but by the spirit of codperation toward the common good.t 
Because many teachers abuse this disciplinary device and em- 
ploy it before trying others, it is with hesitancy that we suggest 
the possibility of its use. Many of the best-disciplined schools 
seem to have dispensed with it entirely. However, such schools 
are generally located in communities of the better class. The

home environment of the child has much to do in determining 
his fitness to enter the social life of the school. With but one 
or two untrained children in the room discipline is greatly 
simplified and corporal punishment may be inexcusable. 
Rules\-It follows from what has been said above that the lay- 
ing down of rules, especially when accompanied by a statement 
as to what punishment is to follow their violation, is extremely 
poor pedagogy. In the first place, the rule oftén serves as the 
stimulus to the act. In the second place, pupils will often count 
the cost and dare one another to brave it. 
Nagging. The teacher should watch himself with great care 
to see that he does not get into the habit of nagging. Once is 
enough to tell a child what is wanted. The teacher who will tell 
him three or four times may doso. The request should be made 
clearly and firmly but not repeated. If the child does not re- 
spond, the simple request that his presence is desired after 
school will be sufficient. 
Discipline of a room can be evaluated best by one who thinks 
of the group as a miniature society. The type of government 
desirable will depend much upon the society for which the group 
is preparing. One may still find cases of classroom government 
which are more suited to an autocracy than to a democracy. 
Discipline should take its rise as far as possible from the group 
itself. The child who has been punished by group disapproval 
has learned a valuable lesson by way of preparation for living. 
Age of pupils affects methods of discipline. All this does not 
mean that pupils of all ages are capable of self-government. A 
skillful teacher must be present to guide the group opinion and 
to develop the needed respect for it. Respect for group opinion, 
however, has a strong instinctive basis and hence is a powerful 
means of controlling the action of the individual. The teacher 
will not lay down rules but, with the aid of the pupils as occa- 
sion arises, will develop, social sanction for desirable ways of 
acting. 
   
-P-A-G-E-89
LESSON IX 7 
Exceptional child must be reckoned with individually. There 
is, of course, the exceptional case of the child who, owing to 
faulty early training or abnormal inheritance, does not seem 
to be subject to the laws governing social life. The teacher must 
not let this individual destroy the order of the class. Special 
punishments must be devised and made sufficiently powerful to 
restrain him until such time as he seems capable of taking his 
place as a member of the social group. This is the method em- 
ployed in the larger society. The type of punishment must 
suit the individual case, at the same time conforming to certain 
general criteria. It is a good rule to avoid any punishment 
likely later to interfere with the pupil’s becoming an active 
member of the group. Generally the most effective way is to 
call the offender tg’one side after class and point out the harm 
he is doing. Give him another trial; meanwhile visit him if 
possible at his home. Discover his interests and if possible gain 
his friendship. This the writer believes from experience will 
cure 75 per cent of the disciplinary cases. 
Discipline has a positive side. Do not forget that discipline 
has a positive side. It does not exist entirely as a propedeutic to 
instruction; it is itself a vital part of the curriculum and must 
be carried on as one of the aims of education. We do not learn 
to govern ourselves while being governed by a tyrant. And 
that teacher is the successful disciplinarian who keeps order and 
at the same time makes the schoolroom a laboratory in which 
the pupils learn to live in society as free and responsible beings. 
Discipline should build up, as far as possible, pupils’ self- 
respect. The teacher who, in the presence of the class, accuses 
a pupil of cheating in an examination, for example, has lowered 
his self-respect. If he repeats this sort of accusation many times 
he tends to lower the moral tone of the entire class. Cheating 
becomes identified with those trivial things about which teachers 
scold. In the long run it is much more effective to deal with 
such matters privately and only with individuals concerned.
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
Cheating, and other forms of social impropriety, should be dealt 
with so as to make the individual concerned feel that his offense 
is such that the teacher would not for the world mention it to 
anybody else, that the pupil is above such work, and that he has 
a chance to make good. Discipline dealing with moral problems 
in a way that does less than this is a failure.

RECITATION PERIOD 
As the pupils entered the room they quietly seated themselves 
at their desks, on which had been placed the papers from the pre- 
vious examination. Some discussion arose among them relating 
to the merits of the grades, but this ceased as the signal for begin- 
ning the recitation was sounded. The teacher lost no time at this 
point in taking up the work of the day. She began by going 
through the questions and discussing the answers. At times she 
called upon certain pupils who had answered well to read what they 
had written upon a given topic.

This part of the recitation was followed by a discussion led by 
the teacher, comparing advantages and disadvantages of England 
and America in the Revolutionary War. Her questions were such 
as to keep the pupils busy in problem solution, and there was no 
tendency to disorder. There was a slight tendency, however, for 
a few to take part in the discussion without first securing permis- 
sion. This at times caused the condition of having two talking at 
once, but little confusion resulted since the teacher recognized the 
one or the other and the one who was not recognized ceased at once. 
The two factors that seemed most effective in obtaining discipline 
were good questions well put and a completely worked-out routine 
of procedure.  
-P-A-G-E-93
LESSON IX 81 
STUDY PERIOD 
The recitation, which lasted twenty minutes, was followed by 
twenty minutes of study, the teacher having first carefully assigned 
the work. All the pupils, excepting one, began immediately to 
study. The teacher observed the fact that this one was not study- 
ing but said nothing until he attempted to attract the attention of 
a girl across the aisle, when the teacher said, ‘John, the rest of us 
are working.” This seemed sufficient, as John immediately settled 
down to his task. Communication, however, was permitted. The 
pupils felt free to go to the wall map and trace out campaigns to- 
gether or ask questions of one another while at their seats. The 
communication carried on seemed only to be that which was neces- 
sary, and it was done in a serious and orderly manner, disturbing 
no one. 
There was no evidence of any rules laid down on the part of the 
teacher. She gave the impression of taking it for granted that the 
pupils were there to work. There was no necessity for nagging, 
for the only pupil to whom it was necessary to speak obeyed 
instantly.

At this time special attention was paid to the methods of dis- 
cipline used in the schoolroom. During the study period I noticed 
that most of the pupils were busy preparing the advance assign- 
ment. There were perhaps one or two whose minds wandered from 
the work before them. One boy began tapping his desk with his 
pencil, and I noticed that some of the others resented the disturb- 
lance. The pupils are allowed to communicate during the study 
period, but they do so very quietly and do not take advantage of 
their privilege. I have noticed no specific devices used by the 
teacher to maintain discipline except that he snaps his fingers 
ccasionally and sometimes scolds one pupil in the presence of the 
thers. I have witnessed no punishment in the room, with the ex-
-P-A-G-E-94
  
82 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
ception of one case. One boy who came to class late for the second 
time was sent for an excuse to the instructor he had had the pre- 
vious hour. He returned with the excuse, and after a few remarks 
by the teacher the case was dismissed. 
I believe all school children are orderly because of the presence 
of the teacher and a fear of discipline. Such seems to be the case 
in this classroom. When the teacher is absent from the room the 
order is not so rigid as when he is present. The teacher does not 
have to nag at the students, as this class is an unusually energetic 
and studious one. There are two or three boys in the class who 
have to be prodded a bit in order to keep up with the others. The 
teacher evidently has rules of his own, which are made evident from 
time to time as occasion demands. 
Each day that I have observed in this class the recitation period 
has been used for work at the blackboard and explanations by the 
students. Therefore the attention of the students is fixed on the 
blackboard and not on the teacher. When the teacher is speaking, 
I have noticed that attention is pretty well fixed on him. His 
questions are usually directed to the entire class, but sometimes 
he surprises one of the pupils with an individual question. The 
teacher does not raise his voice to a loud, high pitch in order to 
be heard but stops talking until quiet is restored. He seems to 
treat a disturbance as an offense against the class. He seems to be 
a very competent teacher ; but he sometimes addresses the class as 
“kids,” and I consider that a very unwise thing to do.
-P-A-G-E-95
LESSON X 
Aim. To become acquainted with such activities as affect the 
school in general and to form ideals of codperation. 
Aside from classroom work the teacher is a part of a large 
organization requiring codperative ability on his part. The fac- 
tory analogy, although much overworked in discussing school 
problems, is perhaps the most in point here. The work of each 
employee must lend itself to the total functioning of the plant. 
Friction and working at cross purposes must be reduced to a 
minimum in any effective enterprise. So, too, in the school 
plant, the matter of whole-hearted codperation with executive 
officers is of the utmost importance. 
Hence the teacher must yield at points and with good grace 
work in harmony with the general administration. When for 
any reason he finds that he cannot effectively discharge this 
art of his function he should resign immediately ; for, regard- 
less of his ability as a classroom teacher, he will find his influ- 
nce tending to disrupt the organization. 
In this connection the teacher should also remember that he 
s neither an expert nor experienced in the matter of school ad- 
inistration. He will not always understand the purpose of 
uch that he is asked to do. But he must have faith that there 
s a purpose behind the task assigned him and that the one who 
is responsible for the operation of the school as a whole has this 
urpose clearly in mind. 
Because of the teacher’s inability to comprehend the function 
f the school as a whole he often magnifies the importance of 
is particular task, thus taking time from other teachers or 
rom the pupils themselves. The overanxious academic instruc- 
83

  84 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
tor may make such assignments as seriously conflict with ar 
extramural activity which is in and of itself highly educational 
The principal is more likely to see the all-round needs of the 
pupils and provide for them in a large way. 
In matters more nearly routine, such as reports, fire drills, etc. 
efficiency may make demands which a teacher from his poin' 
of view cannot fully appreciate. The principal, whose duty i: 
to provide for harmony and concert of action and who is in < 
position to observe the work of the school system as a whole 
will see most clearly the part to be played by each coéperating 
individual. Hence it is necessary that his instructions be car: 
ried out with loyalty and dispatch.

When the gong is sounded three times, the students know that 
hat means fire or fire drill. It is the duty of the teacher to see 
hat the students immediately stop work and form into twos ready 
o march out of the room. In some cases a large boy in the class 
s selected as leader, and it is his business to see that the others 
ine up. He then holds the door open while the others pass out. 
‘he teacher follows the students out of the room. The students 
the room in which I am observing go down the left side of 
lhe stairway at the front entrance. They are supposed to walk 
riskly, but no running is tolerated. One gong is sounded as a 
lignal for every one to return to the building. The students march 
ack into the building and to their rooms. At dismissal time and 
etween classes the students do not have to leave the room in line 
nd do not have to pass through the hall in line. No running is 
lowed in the halls. The halls are fairly wide, but there is some- 
imes congestion at the corners or near the drinking-fountains. 
The teachers’ meetings are usually held on Tuesdays at 3.35 P.M. 
he meetings are not held regularly at this time but are called at 
   
-P-A-G-E-98
  
86 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
least once a week. At the right as one goes into the office is a large 
bulletin board. It holds general information with which all teachers 
should be familiar, such as lists of pupils withdrawn from school, 
those to be excused for various school activities, and many other 
things. Each teacher has a pigeonhole or box for mail in a large 
mail box in the general office. 
Upon returning to school after absence the student must report 
to the principal and receive a signed “admit” slip. This slip is pre- 
sented to the session-room teacher, who signs it. The student then 
presents it to each classroom teacher from whose class he has been 
absent, and each one signs it. These slips are graded A, B, or C. 
If an excuse has a circle round the A, the teacher is required to 
permit the student to make up the work. If the circle is round the 
B, the teacher may use his or her own discretion about allowing 
the student to make up the work. If the grade on the excuse is C, 
the student is not allowed to make up the work and consequently 
receives a zero for the day or days missed. 
Tardiness is recorded and reported to parents on the grade cards. 
An absence is recorded and also placed on the grade card. Each 
teacher has a long yellow slip with small spaces, one for each class. 
The absences are recorded on this slip, which is signed by the 
teacher and sent to the office during the fifth period. A daily; 
session-attendance report is kept for each session room. Students 
who are to be excused from a class must present an excuse signed 
by the principal. Girls who are ill may obtain from the dean of 
girls a signed card which excuses them from class.
-P-A-G-E-99
LESSON XI 
Aim. To appreciate individual differences in the pupils with 
respect to physical development, and to study the question 
in general. 
At bottom, teaching is the directing of changes in the neural 
paths of individuals. We may group individuals so as to en- 
hance the process by producing those changes simultaneously 
in many. This grouping gives us the so-called class. The 
srouping is favorable to just the extent that it is truly a class 
with respect to all factors affecting the learning process or the 
changes in the neural patterns. Many physical anomalies will 
enter for consideration at this point, for they are factors likely 
to affect the learning process. We shall discuss the most im- 
ortant of them. 
Ill health. The health of the child is an important factor in the 
learning process. So important is the matter that many school 
ystems are keeping full-time medical staffs, not with a view to 
romoting health for its own sake but largely with a view to en- 
ancing the teaching process itself. Hence the teacher should 
atch for cases of ill health: first, that he may report to medical 
fficers or parents the fact that the pupil’s health needs atten- 
ion; secondly, that he may adjust the study load to the pupils. 
Then there is the case in which the pupil whose health is 
enerally good becomes temporarily ill. The teacher should 
ote these cases and in some instances excuse the pupil from 
urther participation in the lesson. Every high school should 
e equipped with a rest room for girls. This should be large, 
leasant, and well furnished, and so located that the noise from 
he corridors will be least likely to disturb the occupants. 
87
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
It is generally not difficult to determine cases of ill health 
or sudden illness. Pallor of the face, lack of luster in the eyes 
listlessness of attitude, slow movements, etc. give a fairly re 
liable index to the general health of the individual. Sudder 
illness can be told most readily by one who knows the pupils 
Changes in color, either to a pale or to a flushed face, droopins 
of the head, an unsteady walk, etc. give an index to sudder 
changes in the health. 
Abnormalities of development. The teacher should note any 
abnormalities of physical development affecting various mem 
bers of the class, for there is always the possibility of sug 
gesting remedial measures. Of course, in many school system 
each pupil will be required to submit to a physical examinatior 
given by the medical staff. In this case the teacher can refer t 
cards usually on file in the office of the principal and obtair 
full information with respect to the physical condition of any 
given pupil. This will often prove profitable. The individua 
with a sunken chest, for example, should not escape the notic 
of the teacher. If the teacher is aware of this defect, he car 
counsel the pupil alone and tell him to sit up straight, tak 
breathing exercises, stand erect, etc. In other cases nothin; 
remedial can be done in the sense of bettering the physica 
condition. The physical background, however, will often ac 
count for the mental peculiarities of the individual. The lam 
child is likely to be spoiled by his mother, who flies to his de 
fense on the slightest provocation. The experience of such ¢ 
child will probably be limited along social lines. Hence he can 
not codperate well with others. After the age of adolescenc 
such a child is very likely to become moody. The teacher shoul 
at least be aware of the origin of such mental characteristics 
in order to deal effectively with the individual pupils. 
Defective vision. Physical examinations reveal the fact tha 
on the average about 25 per cent of the grade-school populatio: 
are defective in vision. In certain European cities the propo  
-P-A-G-E-101
  LESSON XI 89 
tion runs as high as 4o and 50 per cent; and in a congested dis- 
trict in Cleveland, Ohio, where 663 children were examined, 
71.7 per cent were found to be defective in vision. Since a large 
part of the instruction is given through the eyes, these facts’ 
should be very significant to the teacher. He should inform 
himself as to the cause and do what is possible to remove it 
in his classroom. Natural and artificial lighting should be 
observed and regulated to the best advantage of the eyes. Text- 
books should be examined with respect to size of type espe- 
cially. From research made in this field, it is doubtful if type 
below 12-point should be used in school texts, even for the 
upper grades and high schools. This field has not yet been 
‘completely studied. The writer found that type below 18-point 
reduced the rate of reading below the fourth grade.* 
The vision of all the pupils should be tested at least once each 
ear. Along with this the classroom teacher should be constantly 
on the watch for signs of eye trouble, such as squinting, head- 
aches, and redness of the eyes. The difficulty when once located 
should be reported to the medical staff or to the parents. It 
may happen, and it often does, that the pupil has been properly 
fitted with glasses but has outgrown them, or is not wearing 
them because of false pride. The medical staff alone cannot 
lattend to these matters. The teacher must be alive to this 
common difficulty and be prepared to meet it. The following 
directions for testing vision were prepared by the Massachusetts 
[Department of Education :? 
        
    
    
             
   The purpose of the school test of vision is: 
1. To find out which pupils have such a defect in their acuteness of 
ision as may interfere with their school work. 
2. To be able to notify the parents of such pupils that a careful exam- 
ination of the eyes is needed to see if the vision can be improved.

DrrEctTIONS 
1. The tests will be made as early in the school year as possible, pref- 
erably in September. 
2. The tests will be made under the most favorable conditions, and as 
nearly as possible under the same conditions, preferably in well-lighted 
rooms, in the early part of the day. 
3. The testing will be done by the teacher of the class, and will be 
supervised by the principal to see that the conditions of the test are as 
uniform as possible for the different classes. 
4. Children wearing glasses will be tested with the glasses, and if found 
normal will be so recorded. 
5. Examine all children, but record as defective only those whose 
vision is 20-40 or less, in either eye. 
6. Report to the superintendent of schools the whole number of chil- 
dren examined and the number found defective according to the stand- 
ard given in No. 5. 4 
To TEST THE EYESIGHT 
Hang the test card of E symbols in a good clear light (side light pre- 
ferred) on a level with the head, and so placed that the child does not 
face a strong light. Place the child 20 feet from the card. Cover one 
eye with a card held firmly against the nose, without pressing on the cov- 
ered eye, and have him read aloud, from left to right, the smallest E 
symbols he can see on the card, stating the direction in which the prongs 
of each symbol point. Make a record of the result. Young children 
should be handed an E symbol like those on the card, and should be di- 
rected to turn the prongs of the symbol so that the prongs shall point 
in the same direction as the prongs of each E symbol on the chart. 
To RECORD THE ACUTENESS OF VISION 
There is a number over each line of the test symbols which shows thi 
distance in feet at which these symbols should be recognized by a nor- 
mal eye. From top to bottom, the lines on the card are numbere 
respectively 50, 40, 30, and 20. At the distance of twenty feet, th 
average normal eye should recognize the symbols on the 20-foot line. I 
this is done correctly, or with a mistake of one or two symbols, the visio 
may be noted as 20-20, or normal. In this fraction the numerator is th: 
distance in feet at which the symbols are read, and the denominator i:
-P-A-G-E-103
  
  LESSON XI ou 
the number over the smallest line of symbols read. If the smallest sym- 
bol which can be read is on the 30-foot line, the vision will be noted as 
20-30; if the symbols on the 40-foot line are the smallest that can be 
read, the record-will be 20-40; if the symbols on the 50-foot line are the 
smallest that can be read, the record will be 20-50. 
If the child cannot see the largest symbols, the 50-foot line, have him 
approach slowly until a distance is found where they can be seen. If 
5 feet is the greatest disfance at which the 50-foot symbols can be read, 
the record will be 5-50 (1-10 of normal). 
Test the second eye, the first being covered with the card, and note the 
result, as before. With the second eye, have the child read the symbols 
from right to left, to avoid memorizing. 
To prevent reading from memory the 
child may be required to read the sym- 
bols in irregular order. A mistake of 
two symbols on the 20 or the 30-foot 
line, and of one symbol on the 4o or the 
50-foot line may be allowed. 
    NotIFICATION OF PARENTS 
  The teacher will notify the parent or 
guardian on one of the notice cards, as Fic. 16. E Symbol 
required by law, whenever the vision in To be handed to young children 
either eye is found to be 20-40 or less. 
No notice will be sent when the vision is 20-20 in both eyes, 20-20 in one 
eye and 20-30 in the other, or 20-30 in both eyes. 
When glasses are used the vision will be tested with the glasses. A 
notice card will also be sent when the teacher finds that the eyes or eye- 
lids are habitually inflamed; when there is complaint of pain in the eyes 
or head after reading or writing, especially toward the end of school 
hours; when one or both eyes deviate from the normal position — 
squinting; when the book is habitually held at less than one foot from 
the eyes ; when there is constant scowling and evident effort in using the 
eyes. 
If the vision is as low as 20-40 in either eye, with glasses, find out, if 
possible, from the practitioner who prescribed the glasses, whether the 
child should be reéxamined, or whether his school work should be modi- 
fied so as to reduce eye strain. The school nurse may be able to secure 
this information in codperation with the parents.

LESSON XI 93 
Defective hearing. Next to eye trouble, defective hearing is 
one of the most common causes of failure to learn. As in the case 
of vision, the teacher should be ever on the lookout for audi- 
tory trouble. Failure to understand the teacher’s directions, the 
turning of the head to one side or the other when listening, 
puzzled expressions, etc. should cause the teacher to look far- 
ther for hearing difficulties. Pupils who exhibit these character- 
istics should immediately be given an auditory examination. All 
pupils should be examined at the beginning of the school year. 
The following directions for testing hearing are given by the 
New York State Department of Health:* 
All children should be examined. 
Children should be examined singly and privately. 
Ascertain whether the child has frequent earaches, has pus or a foul 
odor proceeding from either ear, suffers from frequent “colds in the 
head,” is subject to a constant catarrhal discharge from the nose or 
throat, or is a mouth-breather. 
Seat the child facing you near one end of a guiet room with the 
windows closed and begin the test of the hearing at a measured distance 
of 25 feet. The test is made by having the left ear tightly closed with 
the finger while you observe the ability of the child to repeat your mod- 
erate whispers of numbers between 21 and 9g inclusive, avoiding those 
with ciphers; as, 75, 55, 37, 22, etc. Test the left ear with the right 
tightly closed. Avoid having a wall behind you to act as a sounding 
board. The figures should have as nearly equal emphasis as possible, 
and the distance at which the child correctly repeats a series of three 
numbers gives his hearing distance for that ear. No further test is nec- 
essary if the child hears the numbers perfectly with each ear. If this 
test shows a slight defect of either ear, further tests may be made by 
observing how the child hears the tick of an ordinary watch, which 
should be heard normally at a distance of not less than 3 feet. 
The hearing is recorded by a fraction of which the numerator repre- 
sents the distance you are from the child and the denominator is 25. If 
he repeats the numbers correctly at 25 feet his hearing is 25/25 or nor- 
mal. If he only repeats the numbers correctly when you are at 20 feet 
it is 20/25 or 4/5 the normal, and at 12 feet 12/25, etc.

94 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
The teacher should observe for the following indications of 
ear defects which have been listed by Dr. L. M. Terman:* 
. Pupils often say “What?” 
. Inattention. 
. Stupid appearance. 
. Expressionless voice. 
. Poor spelling. 
. Poor progress in general. 
. Imperfect speech. 
. Complaint of earache. 
g. Running ear (discharge often being present without being easily 
observed). 
to. Peculiar postures (in attempts to hear). 
11. Difficult nasal breathing (often present with ear trouble).

General nervousness. Although general nervousness is not 
so closely related to the gathering of information as are sense 
defects, it is nevertheless an important consideration affecting 
vitally the child’s future well-being as well as his present ability 
to learn. The teacher should therefore become familiar witl 
the reactions which indicate nervousness that he may do al. 
within his power to improve the conditions under which nervous 
pupils work. 
The following are a few of the more obvious signs of nervous: 
ness for which the teacher should watch: ; 
1. Twitching of the muscles of the eyes, mouth, or fingers. 
. Shuffling of the feet. 
. Grinding of the teeth. 
. Chewing pencil or nails. 
. Jumping when spoken to or when touched. 
. Stuttering. ‘ 
. Poor muscular coérdination. 
. Outbreaks of passion. 
9. General restlessness.

For the most part the class appears to be homogeneous with 
respect to age. I should guess the oldest member to be about nine- 
teen years and the youngest member to be about fourteen years of 
age. Two of the pupils, a girl about sixteen and a boy about 
seventeen, seem to lack the proper vitality. It is possible that 
they are not getting the proper amount of sleep. However, they 
do not appear to be drowsy at present. None of the pupils are 
wearing glasses, although there is some evidence that Mary Rose 
and Ira Morse need them. They lean forward and frown when 
trying to read material written upon the board. The eyes of 
several are inflamed and indicate need of glasses. Those pupils 
should be reported to the school nurse. 
One of the girls, Nellie Smith, seems to be somewhat undersized 
for her age. However, her health appears to be good, and there 
is no evidence of nervousness. No evidence of auditory trouble 
is observable.

The students in the class in which I am observing seem to be in 
fairly good health. There is only one student who might be an 
exception. He is a very small boy whose neck seems to disappear 
into the folds of his coat when he raises his shoulders. He sits in 
a front seat, which is entirely too large for him. He wears glasses, 
but does not seem to have any auditory trouble. There are no

  LESSON XI 97 
others in the class who seem to be abnormal in development. There 
are several large boys in the class, but no doubt they are repeating 
the course. The ages of the students range from thirteen to seven- 
teen years. Three of the students wear glasses. One of these is a 
little girl who is deaf. She cannot hear any of the explanations in 
class and gets most of her work from the book. Sometimes the 
teacher keeps her after class and speaks very loudly to her in an 
effort to explain some things. He sometimes tries to help her dur- 
ing the study hour, bvt he annoys the other students by speaking 
so loudly to her. None of the students seem to be very nervous, and 
they seem composed and deliberate when explaining problems at 
the blackboard. One boy in the back of the room seems to be 
conscious of my presence, as I sit in the back of the room also. 
He glances at me in a manner which makes me think he wonders 
if I am watching him. There are no extremes in the age of stu- 
dents except possibly in the case of the small boy to whom I have 
referred before. Some of the older boys have deep voices and look 
older than the others. These are the ones I referred to as probably 
repeating the course. One of the students is a senior in high school 
and probably failed in the course when a freshman. The class as 
a whole is a very unusually intelligent one. None of the students 
are laggers, and there is keen competition among all of them. 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
  LESSON XII 
Aim. To appreciate the problem of individual differences wit} 
respect to social, moral, and temperamental characteristic: 
in general and to observe the social, moral, and tempera. 
mental characteristics of the pupils in the class which th 
student is to teach later. 
During the last lesson we have been studying and observing 
physical differences in the class constituency. We are now tc 
attend to social, moral, and temperamental differences. After 
all, the class is a social group, and each individual must be 
treated as a personality. The teacher should work with the 
grain and not against it. He should keep ever in mind the fact 
that temperaments differ. Not only this, but the pupils come 
from homes which vary widely in environmental influence 
Prejudices of religious, political, social, and neighborhood va 
rieties affect the dealings of the teacher with the pupils. A 
thorough knowledge of these social peculiarities of the indi 
vidual members of the class not only enables the teacher tc 
avoid unpleasant class discussion but also enables him to rounc 
out the social ability of each pupil by properly guiding reading 
discussion, and other activities. 
Out of this maze of temperaments, distorted allegiances, anc 
prejudices must come an intelligent and efficient citizenry. The 
nonsocial must be made social. The individualist must learn t« 
codperate. The socially warped must be made to see life in < 
large way. All these are among the tasks of the teacher. He i: 
not teaching mathematics but young people, and the bigger aim: 
of the daily lessons must be set up in terms of the pupils’ presen 
status and their future needs as members of an intelligent anc 
98
-P-A-G-E-111
  LESSON XII 99 
fficient citizenship. All this demands that the teacher know 
he social and nonsocial characteristics of each pupil. 
Shyness. The extent to which shyness has its basis in innate 
jualities or is the result of training remains unsettled. How- 
ver, we may be rather certain that a tendency toward shyness 
nay be greatly enhanced or retarded by the home and neighbor- 
ood life of the child. In many homes children are so repressed 
hat they are not allowed to express their ideas at the table or 
vhile elders are engaged in conversation. They are plainly told 
hat children are to be seen and not heard. Their ideas are 
elittled at all times. It is small wonder that timidity results 
rom such a course of action. The treatment in such cases is to 
levelop confidence in the individual by setting up the proper 
choolroom atmosphere. The pupils should be encouraged to 
xpress themselves freely on the problems brought up for class 
liscussion. A teacher may easily spoil this freedom by making 
ght of the thoughts and suggestions of the pupils. He must 
eep near their level and think with them, weighing and con- 
dering their suggestions. He must bear in mind that for 
any pupils the class affords about the only occasion in which 
ey are taken seriously and given an opportunity to develop 
itiative and self-confidence. He should even go farther than 
is and set up a situation in which the shy pupil will be re- 
ested to give his ideas or experiences and in some instances 
ovoked to defend positions taken in certain matters. Such 
mscious efforts as these on the part of the teacher will do 
uch to overcome shyness on the part of individual pupils. 
Boldness. Pupils are often inclined to be too bold. While 
is condition is possible, it seems much to be preferred to that 
extreme shyness. As far as environment has anything to do 
ith the matter, boldness in the individual is perhaps the result 
not having felt his limitations. It is no sign of mental supe- 
rity. On the contrary, it is oftener an indication of medioc- 
y. That the pupil should have this reserve of confidence in

  100 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
himself, however, is much in his favor. The teacher should no 
seek to repress it but rather use it to encourage the pupil t 
attempt useful tasks within his range. The wise teacher wil 
no more try to break down this self-confidence than the skille 
horse-trainer will break down the self-confidence of a colt b: 
hitching him to a load that is too heavy for him. Sometime 
boldness takes the form of insolence. The skillful teacher cai 
generally manage such cases by being patient and letting th 
pupil defend his position by further study and investigatior 
The teacher should never take the position of an authority. Th 
problem-solving attitude is a healthy one for all. 
Leadership. Qualities of leadership are very valuable an 
should be discovered and fostered. The natural leader ofte’ 
can be used to promote desirable classroom conditions wit! 
benefit both to himself and to the others. A well-known stu 
dent of education tells of the following incident in his earl: 
school experience. A certain boy had been giving considerabl 
trouble by disturbing the class. The teacher observed als 
that the boy’s lead was followed by many of the others. Pun 
ishing seemed of no avail. The teacher then hit upon the ide 
of making the boy a marshal whose duty it was to see that th 
room was kept orderly. The boy took the responsibility wit 
pride and soon after led his former companion to the door b 
one ear, repeating on the way the teacher’s old saying, “ 
seems to me there is a slight misunderstanding as to the purpos 
of this recitation.” It is not recommended here that such dra 
tic use be made of leaders, but their ability can be utilized i 
more subtle ways for their own good and that of all othe 
concerned. Disciplinary problems often fade away when clas: 
room leaders become interested in the work. 
Neatness. The quality of neatness is perhaps more subje 
to training than shyness or leadership. Neatness—like its opp: 
site, slovenliness—is a habit. The child becomes neat throu 
the habit of being neat, aided perhaps by observing neatness
-P-A-G-E-113
  LESSON XII IOI 
those round him. It is a mistake to assume that neatness can 
be obtained by scolding. The untidy person is no more to be 
blamed for his untidiness than for the color of his hair. The 
responsibility lies upon those who had charge of his training 
and failed to develop habits of neatness. As has been stated 
before, educational psychologists are beginning to tell us that 
neatness consists in many specific responses to situations rather 
than in a general habit of neatness. One investigator found that 
neatness in written work in one subject had little or no effect 
upon neatness in other work. Combing and brushing the hair 
is a habit by itself, and it does not follow that one who has 
developed ideals and habits with respect to combing his hair 
will keep his finger nails trimmed and cleaned. The latter is 
another specific habit and must be developed by itself. In other 
words, it is not safe to assume that neatness developed with 
respect to one activity will function in the others. It may be 
true, as Bagley suggests, that we can develop general ideals of 
neatness, but, after all, such ideals cannot function without 
many specific habits. 
The matter of neatness is too important for the teacher to 
ignore. His method of obtaining it will of course depend upon 
the age of the pupils with whom he is dealing. The teacher 
in the upper grades or in the high school can generally accom- 
plish the desired results by talking to the pupils individually 
about the importance of the matter. Grading the pupils for 
neatness or humiliating any of them before the class is both 
unpardonable and ineffective. 
Coéperation. As civilization becomes more and more com- 
plex, tasks once accomplished by individuals working alone are 
more and more being turned over to large groups, each member 
completing but a small part of the total work. The cobbler at 
one time made an entire shoe, even tanning the leather for it. 
Today many hundred men often engage in the process of shoe- 
making. The failure of one man to codperate may retard: the
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
work of all. Hence the ability to codperate takes on greater 
and greater importance as civilization advances. On the other 
hand, personality and individuality are important and must not 
be overlooked in the teaching process. A nation of men who are 
but cogs in a machine is undesirable. The individual, in the final 
analysis, represents the summum bonum of all combined effort. 
But the individual must learn to maintain his individuality and 
at the same time to codperate with others for the good of all 
concerned. Tasks should be assigned in which codperation is 
needed. Special care should be taken that those least willing to 
work with others are assigned to those tasks. Sometimes lessons 
of this type are effectively administered through athletics. If 
the individual cannot play on the team, he should at least be 
expected to lend his moral support. Getting the pupil interested 
in something larger than himself is a big step toward the ulti- 
mate goal of education. Such methods of dealing with begin- 
ning pupils as those proposed and used by Dr. Montessori have 
their greatest weakness in that they fail to provide properly for 
experience in codperating with others. 
Weakness of will. We are not to think of will as some faculty] 
of the mind but rather as a generalized ideal with respect to the 
habit of reacting. This change of conception throws some light 
upon the possibilities of improving the will and the method o 
accomplishing this. The habits of carrying out our plans an 
of forgoing our desires are probably laid quite early in life 
The child whose parents hasten to respond to his slightest whim. 
getting him everything for which he asks, is likely later t 
possess little self-restraint, which is one form of so-called wil 
power. So also with the child who never finishes tasks, eithe 
those he undertakes by himself or those assigned him. A stor: 
has been told of a father whose little son came to him askin; 
permission to use the father’s hammer and saw for the purposi 
of making a sled. The child returned them a few minute: 
later, saying he did not want to complete the sled. The fathe  
-P-A-G-E-115
  LESSON XII 103 
replied: “Son, you started to make a sled and I do not want 
to see you again until you have finished it.” Children blessed 
with such a parent are not likely to be lacking in will power. 
Temper. While temper undoubtedly has its background in 
innateness, the tendency to fits of rage is much enhanced or dis- 
couraged by the experience of the individual. Perhaps fits of 
rage have been allowed to bring satisfaction in the past. The 
teacher should see that they bring none now. The child should 
not be excused for acts committed during fits of rage. 
Disobedience. Although disobedience may be owing entirely 
to the faults of earlier training, it is often provoked and fos- 
tered by the teacher himself. The teacher who says “There 
will be no whispering this morning” is flying into the face of 
the inevitable. There will be whispering, and he knows it. 
Then why make such a statement? Again, teachers often enter 
into heated discussions with pupils over disciplinary matters. 
The teacher should seldom if ever do this. While he must al- 
ays keep individual traits in mind in disciplining, no matter of 
iscipline should ever degenerate into a quarrel between the 
eacher and a pupil. The age of the pupils with whom the 
eacher is dealing must be taken into account in matters of 
bedience. It seems desirable to recommend that, in so far as 
s consistent with pupil self-government (and this should be 
ncouraged to the extent of pupil capacity (see Lesson IX)), 
nquestioned obedience be demanded of children below the age 
f nine years ; that from nine to about thirteen exactness be les- 
ened as satisfactory group control is substituted ; and that dur- 
ng the adolescent period obedience be largely a hearkening to 
he voice of the group rather than of the teacher. The teacher, 
n other words, in dealing with children of all ages should at- 
empt to mold group opinion and, if possible, control the in- 
ividual indirectly through this medium. 
Honesty. The problem of developing honesty in pupils is one 
f the most serious which teachers of today have to face. Stu-

104 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
dents of psychology feel quite sure that it is largely a matter 
of training; that one is not born with especially inherited 
tendencies to steal, to lie, or to cheat. Since honesty, therefore, 
is a matter of training and since our more complex social and 
industrial life is causing the gradual slipping of home control, 
it becomes more and more important that teachers pay atten- 
tion to the building of moral ideals and habits. As with the 
other social qualities, moral ideals and habits should be trained 
from early infancy. Frowning upon the undesirable and prais- 
ing the desirable are very effective means of disposing the child 
to right ways of acting. A veteran educator once advised the 
writer, “Never hesitate to commend a good act in the presence 
of a child and never fail to condemn a bad one.” Dishonesty 
should always be held to be low in the eyes of the teacher. /An 
dealing with adolescents it is undoubtedly best to set up group 
ideals and then control the individual members by means of 
them. If the group will sanction petty stealing, little can be| 
done by the teacher toward reforming any given member. If 
in high schools group opinion will not prevent cheating in ex 
aminations, there is little the teacher can do except to watc 
for the crook. This may prevent his cheating; but it will no 
develop his ideals or change his habits, and its effect is alway: 
demoralizing to the remainder of the class. Perhaps one of th 
most effective ways of dealing with the problem of dishonest: 
in high schools is that of assuming that one is dealing wit 
ladies and gentlemen and then having a serious conference wit 
one who proves to be otherwise. Of course such conference 
must be private. The student’s self-respect must be maintaine 
if possible. He should be made to feel that this is a matte 
which the teacher would not expose for the world—somethin 
to be truly ashamed of. The writer believes this attitude o 
the part of the teacher to be more effective than that of 
policeman.

panying Lesson XII: 
    
    
       
   
        
      
    
    In general the class which I am observing appears to have come} 
from homes better than average. All are neatly dressed and in| 
general well groomed. Their English is for the most part abov 
the average of that used in high schools. I have not noted at an 
‘time any indication of allegiances or prejudices which would it 
any way interfere with class discussion. 
One of the pupils, Mildred, likes to be noticed and is causin; 
some disturbance by making recitations that are not cogent an 
that border at times upon the ridiculous. She is a rather attrac. 
tive girl and detracts somewhat from the class attention of th 
boys who are seated round her. I believe the girl to be somewhat 
sentimental and easily led by her likes and dislikes. As a teacher. 
I shall try to win her good will and request in a conference wit 
her that she try harder to refrain from disturbing the class. 
The following pupils appear to have outstanding leadershi 
ability: Mildred, Elgie, Fred, and George. Of these Elgie seem: 
to surpass the others. He is a power for good or evil in the class 
The pupils as a rule turn to listen when he recites, and when

remark is made by another pupil those round him observe his re- 
action to it. Elgie, however, is worthy of their respect and seems to 
take no advantage of his position in any way to disturb the dis- 
cipline of the room. Fred, on the contrary, appears to be inclined 
to stubbornness and individualism. Once he has made a state- 
ment he attempts to defend it regardless of the weakness of his 
case. ‘Even though vanquished he could argue still.” 
The incidents which I have observed would not justify my con- 
clusion that there are any representative cases of extreme temper. 
This quality is better suppressed by the factor of social control at 
this age. 
There were no instances of disobedience. However, Francis 
caused some disturbance. He twice or three times caused the 
teacher to pause for order. The disturbance caused by Mildred 
and John seemed to be due more to the play incentive than to any 
desire to disobey. 
Grace is somewhat shy, though she has exceptional ability. Her 
reactions contrast strikingly with those of Mildred, who is bolder 
than the average. 
      
     
     
    
           
         
The class which I am observing comprises a very active and 
intelligent group of students. There are only three pupils who 
ight be said to be a trifle shy. One of these is a little girl who 
is very untidy in the arrangement of her hair and dress. I believe, 
owever, that she is unconscious of her lack of neatness, for she 
omes from a family which pays little attention to personal appear- 
nce. Another of the shy pupils is a large boy who is a senior 
in high school and who has some trouble with pronunciation. The 
ther shy one is a rather large boy who is not very neat in appear- 
nce and who has a scared look on his face when he recites. There 
re none in the class who are bold. One girl is very good in her 
ork, and she is always quick to see mistakes. She is the only 
me whom I should consider a leader. Most of the others are good 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
workers, but they seem to lack the initiative which is necessary 
in one who is to lead others. 
Besides the two referred to above as being untidy in dress, there 
is still another—a little fellow whom I have spoken of before as 
seeming to disappear into the folds of his coat when he raises_his 
shoulders. He seems never to be very clean, and his books are not 
kept in order on his desk. The little fellow is only twelve years 
old and therefore much advanced for his age. Those whom I re- 
ferred to as being shy are the same ones I should say are lacking 
in self-confidence. Perhaps the shyness is due to this lack of con- 
fidence. None of them seems to be overconfident, as it is not 
likely a group of freshmen in high school would be. Every mem- 
ber of the class seems to codperate with the teacher in the work 
directed by him, each student trying to do his or her best work. 
I believe this attitude is encouraged by the fact that there are so 
many bright students and they compete for first place. I have not 
noticed any instances of extreme decision, but there is one student 
who lacks determination. He is a little behind the others in the 
work, and no doubt he would be up with the class if he had the 
will power to stick to the job. There have been no examples of 
extreme temper or disobedience. The teacher seems to have goo 
control of the group. There have been no instances of eithe 
dishonesty or deceit.

   im. To appreciate the problem of individual differences with 
respect to brightness and dullness in general and to observe 
for degrees of brightness and dullness in the various mem- 
bers of the class: 
Undoubtedly teachers have always observed the fact that 
upils differ in native ability, but it is only within the present 
lentury that these differences have been measured and given 
ecial attention. We now expect the abilities of the individual 
embers of the average class to differ according to a well- 
nown law which is expressed graphically by the curve of nor- 
al distribution. This means that in any unselected group there 
re a few who are very poor; then the number at any level in- 
reases gradually until the peak in numbers is reached with the 
verage in quality; and after the median point the number at 
my level decreases as quality rises, until at the point of highest 
uality the number of individuals is very small. Pupils are not 
ll mentally equal and should not be expected to accomplish 
qual amounts of work. Although the teacher knows this, it is 
n easy matter to forget all about it in the heat of school activi- 
ies and turn a piece of practical information into a merely 
teresting statement. 
Class teaching a new venture in schoolroom methods. Class 
leaching is a relatively new venture in schoolroom procedure. 
in the early days the teacher instructed each pupil separately. 
ence each progressed according to the talent that he or she 
jossessed. As demand was made for the more thorough instruc- 
ion of all, the possibilities of mass instruction became more 
ttractive. The venture was first made by Lancaster and Bell 
109

in the beginning of the nineteenth century. In its beginning 
class instruction took on a machinelike character in which al 
pupils of a given class were subjected to the same treatment 
The assumption was that if all had about the same schoo 
experience, they formed a class which was homogeneous witl 
respect to ability to carry any given load. With this assumptio: 
in the background the pupils were put through the same cours 
of treatment, then examine

Additional individual differences due to inherited special abil 
ities. In addition to the individual differences which come fron 
inherited general ability there are those which come from in 
herited special abilities. Here is the boy who seems able t 
draw anything he sees. He has had, as far as one can determing 
no more opportunity than another who can scarcely draw th 
simplest form so that one would recognize it. This differenc|

annot be accounted for on the basis of general intelligence, for 
oth might stand at approximately the same point if tested by a 
airly reliable intelligence test. One pupil likes literature; an- 
ther likes mathematics; another, Latin. One pupil may be 
nterested in going to college and another in learning a trade. 
\lthough it is difficult to say to just what extent inherited 
pecial abilities lie in the background of these interests and 
hese apparent special abilities, the fact remains that they are 
resent in every school situation, and provision must be made 
or them in any fully worked-out scheme of education. 
Environment an important factor in individual differences. 
Ithough individual differences are largely inherited, the en- 
ironment plays no small part. The apperceptive background 
ay be so different in different members of the class as to form 
ut little basis for a common approach to the lesson. In the 
ords of Professor Nutt: 
The range of differences in training in any high school class is usually 
uch greater than the teachers realize. The pupils in a freshman class, 
r example, may all have passed through the same elementary school 
id may have reached high school at practically the same age. Never- 
eless they are not of equal training. In the first place, they come 
om home conditions that are widely different in the opportunities 
at they offer for experiences and training that are truly educative. 
me pupil may come from a home that is a luxurious mansion artisti- 
lly designed and decorated, handsomely furnished, and supplied with 
oks, magazines, beautiful pictures, and musical instruments. This in- 
ividual has opportunity to read, to hear fine music, and to learn much 
rough spontaneous experiences. He hears refined language, discussions 
important life problems, and learns genteel manners that give him poise 
d dignity of bearing. Another pupil of this same group comes from a 
me that is very humble and almost wholly lacking in books, music, and 
her opportunities for spontaneous education. He hears crude language 
d little or no discussion of vital problems other than the primary ones 
food and clothing. This individual spends hours in monotonous rou- 
Ine tasks that have long since ceased to interest and educate him.+

  112. OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
Provisions for individual differences with respect to menta 
ability. Provisions for dealing with intellectual differences it 
the pupils may be divided into two classes ; namely, administra 
tive provisions and classroom provisions. By administrativ 
provisions we mean such as affect the homogeneity of the group 
By classroom provisions we mean such as affect the individua 
members of any given group. To illustrate: dividing the pupil 
of any given grade into three classes,—slow, medium, bright,— 
each handled by a separate teacher, is an example of adminis 
trative provision; whereas giving extra work to the bright an 
only the fundamentals to the slow is an example of classroor 
provision. 
Examples of administrative provisions for individual differ 
ences with respect to mental ability. One of the most noted o 
the administrative provisions for individual differences is tha 
known as the “Batavia plan,” which puts two teachers int 
rooms with large numbers of pupils, one to conduct recitation 
and the other to give individual help. Rooms with the averag 
number of pupils have but one teacher, who gives part of th 
recitation period over to supervised study. The danger involve 
in this plan is that the helping teacher will give most of he 
attention to the weak pupils, neglecting the brighter. 
The plan of frequent promotions has some virtues. Unde 
the old class method the failing pupil had to drop back an entir 
year. Some systems now promote pupils every ten or twelv 
weeks, thus giving the slower ones a chance to do their worl 
over again without great loss in time. The most serious defec 
in this plan is that the slower pupils sometimes are helped littl 
by being dragged twice at a too rapid pace over the same grounc¢ 
A plan with much in its favor is that of grouping the pupil 
so that group one will complete the eight grades in seven years 
group two in eight years, and group three in nine years. Th 
main objection to this plan is that the work to be accomplishe 
becomes the unit of measure rather than the change produced i

LESSON XIII 113 
he children. The maturing interests of the children are not 
aken fully into account. Some are advanced into secondary- 
chool work before reaching the adolescent period, and others 
re denied the social experience suited to adolescence owing 
o the fact that they have not as yet completed the common 
ranches. Since such a plan would necessitate twenty-four yearly 
rograms of study where we now have eight, the difficulty on 
he administrative side would be considerably increased. This 
night result in an overformalization of school work, with a 
esulting tendency to office rather than personal supervision. 
The plan of dividing the pupils of any given grade into from 
hree to five groups so as to secure a maximum of homogeneity 
ith respect to mental ability has perhaps the most in its favor. 
he bright section does the work better, prepares more outside 
ssignments, does more project work, etc. The slowest section 
ay get the fundamentals only. The transfer of pupils from 
e section to another can be accomplished without putting the 
upils with those younger or older. The maximum advantage 
class instruction can be had, for the range of individual dif- 
rence has been greatly reduced. This plan, however, is not 
lossible in a school so small that there would be too few in any 
ven grade to provide full classes of more than one section. 
The departmental plan provides very well for individual 
ifferences but has many objectionable features when applied 
low the seventh grade. The most serious of the objections to 
e departmental plan in the lower grades is that it does not 
ovide for the mothering attentions which the young children 
em to need. Then, too, they are not so capable as older pupils 
providing themselves before each recitation with the proper 
aterial equipment. However, it may be argued on the other 
nd that this practice and that of following their daily schedule 
e good training for them. 
The pupil under the departmental plan can advance in one 
bject and repeat another. This is a decided advantage. The
-P-A-G-E-126
  114 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
grade pupil who must lag in reading because of weakness i 
arithmetic is treated unjustly, yet often our lock-step organiza 
tion leaves no alternative. The departmental plan, however 
does not to any great extent, except in the case of elective suk 
jects, give greater homogeneity of either native ability or trair 
ing. At least it does not provide for this as well as grad 
sectioning does. 
Classroom provisions for dealing with individual difference: 
Regardless of the efficiency of the administrative provisions fo 
individual differences there will still be a certain amount o 
variation in ability to be dealt with by the classroom teache 
Some will have considerably more native capacity than other: 
Special work will have to be provided for the brighter pupil: 
and extra attention will be necessary for the slow. There wi 
still be the special abilities that should be brought out. Joht 
who seems to have special ability in drawing and who will dra 
most of the time if not suppressed, is a problem for the teache) 
Although the others must not be neglected, use for John’s drav 
ing should be found, and he should be given credit for his be: 
productions. The teacher must be on the lookout for tho: 
special gifts. They are precious both to John and to society. 
Provision for individual differences through assignments. | 
is possible for the classroom teacher to vary the extra assigi 
ments so as to give the capable pupils more work. In math 
matics this may mean additional and more difficult problem 
in history, outside readings and reports. The more able pu 
may often with profit be assigned to the task of aiding t! 
weaker. The attempt to explain material to another is oft 
the surest way of grasping the full significance of it onesel 
This method, however, will need to be used with care so 
not thereby to prevent the brighter pupils from extending t 
horizon of their own knowledge. Then, too, the weaker pu 
may need the skilled leadership of the teacher rather than t! 
unskilled help of his neighbor.
-P-A-G-E-127
LESSON XIII II5 
Provision for individual differences through conferences. In 
e carrying out of the conference plan the teacher remains for 
time after school, arrives at the school early, or, in the case of 
partmental teaching, sets aside a vacant period for the pur- 
se of meeting pupils who need help (this should as often in- 
ude the strong as the weak). So important is this type of 
pervision that schools have been known to set aside a class 
riod once each week, or even once each day, to add to the 
acher’s opportunities to meet each pupil in an informal con- 
rence. In the operation of the conference plan it seems 
lvisable to recommend that both appointed and unappointed 
mferences be held. If the teacher sees only those whom he 
is designated, many who should confer with him and who also 
ish to do so will be neglected. As a disciplinary device the 
pointed conference has something to recommend it. On this 
int Hall-Quest has the following to say: 
Weak pupils are asked to confer with the teacher or the principal for 
rious reasons. The request itself may savor of some penalty. There 
la presumption at the outset that the pupil has failed to meet require- 
nts. Bad news travels fast and it does not infrequently happen that 
pupils whisper the news abroad that so and so “had to see the prin- 
1 or teacher today.” Trivial as this may seem, it nevertheless de- 
es consideration in dealing with high school people. Appointments 
uld be made inconspicuously. Although they may be necessary for 
ciplinary reasons, this fact should be minimized at first. Discipline 
be effective must rest on facts carefully and justly obtained.+ 
Conduct of the conference. To be most effective the confer- 
Ice must be systematically arranged by the teacher. In case 
conference is by appointment initiated by the teacher, notes 
uld be made at that time as to the aims of the meeting. The 
e should be definitely set and the pupil expected to be there. 
hough the teacher should handle the pupil’s problems with

dispatch, it is well to show a little friendly interest in his gener 
well-being. Often in this way the teacher can bring the reb 
lious pupil to take an interest in his work. There is no bet! 
way of improving the teacher’s influence with the class th 
through individual conferences with the members. 
Rynearson, writing in School Review, Vol. XX, gives t 
following advantages of conferences: 
1. It affords a practical and efficient means of helping the first-ye 
pupil to keep up to grade. 
2. It combines happily the class and individual methods of teachii 
3. It serves the useful purpose of a general “clearing-house” peri 
for review, drill, discussion of obscure principles, and for personal w« 
with the individual pupil. 
4. The pupil understands that he can display his ignorance with ho 
of enlightenment and no fear of a poor grade for so doing. 
5. Through intimate personal contact it stimulates a feeling of mutt 
sympathy and helpfulness between teacher and pupil, and obvia' 
largely the necessity of keeping children after school to make up wo: 
Provision for individual differences through study coac 
Hall-Quest divides study coaching into two kinds; namely, t 
conducted by the unassigned teacher, and that conducted by t 
general study coach. The former plan was developed by Sup 
intendent Spaulding while at Newton, Massachusetts. The 
of the unassigned-teacher plan requires an extra teacher an 
room large enough to seat at least twenty pupils. Classro 
teachers, with small groups of pupils having special difficu 
in mastering parts of the lesson, assign them in a body, al 
with a statement of their needs, to the unassigned teac 
She may work with them for an entire period and, if need 
perhaps again on the following day. So throughout the en 
day the unassigned teacher works with groups or individ 
that have been sent to her by the regular classroom teach 
The administration of such assignments would necessarily 
upon the principal. Otherwise there would be friction am

  LESSON XIII 117 
the teachers, and between them and the unassigned teacher. 
Hall-Quest recommends that exchange cards pass between 
teacher and coach both upon sending and returning pupils. 
The plan of the general study coach differs from that of the 
unassigned teacher in being more individual and less formal. 
The pupils, upon their own initiative, go to the coach for help. 
Many objections can be raised against this form of supervision. 
In the first place, it does not assure us that the pupils who can 
profit most by help will be those who receive it. There is also 
some likelihood that a few of the conferences would degenerate 
into mere social visits. The objection that one person can 
hardly be expected to be able profitably to help in all the sub- 
jects taught is as valid here as in the case of the large assembly 
hall and the one teacher supervisor. Such a person would need 
special preparation for this work. 
Hall-Quest makes the following suggestions to study coaches:    
   
   
      
        
      
     
        1. Address the pupil kindly with a smile, with a friendly grip of the 
and. 
2. Ask him to be frank in stating the difficulty. All he says will be 
egarded as absolutely confidential. 
3. Ascertain as many details as possible bearing on the pupil’s general 
ttitude toward the subject. 
4. Begin the actual coaching by requiring the pupil to read the prob- 
em slowly with proper emphasis on important words. Then set him to 
ork as much of the problem as he can. 
5. When the pupil reaches the difficulty, analyze the situation care- 
ully for the reason of the difficulty. It has a reason—an important 
sychological one. Use analogies from common day experience. At- 
ack the difficulty by appealing to senses other than sight. Use manual 
onstruction if possible. Use blackboard together with the pupil. Shift 
he angle of attack until the pupil says, “I see it!” If after many trials 
e cannot “see it,” then tell him what to do. 
6. Prevent wasteful energy and time by stopping the pupil as soon as 
e has begun a wrong procedure. The factor of independence is pro- 
ided for in requiring a reason for every step taken and at point of dif- 
culty stating reasons for attempting this or that next step.
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
7. If there is a group of pupils facing the same difficulty, all of them 
should be given opportunity to state reasons for processes employed in 
the solution of the problem. f 
8. Do not work any problem for the pupil. He must do all the work 
under tactful suggestion by questions. But when absolutely necessary, 
supply information. 
9. Make a record of the difficulties encountered, number of visits made 
by each pupil, amount of coaching for the same kind of difficulty.+

they encouraged to take the initiative in class? 
10. Note any attempt to group for instructional purposes th} 
pupils of similar ability.

dents are not dull, but that something must be done to hold their 
ttention. Vernon and Joseph appear intelligent enough, but they 
also appear to be rather shiftless or nervous and not able to attend 
to the discussion with ease. Edna and Jack are a little dull and do 
ot seem to be able to attend easily. There are none in the class 
ho seem continually to lack interest in the work. The only 
ossible exception would be Vernon. 
Of the five students I have listed as retarded one year Edna is 
robably the only one who is really retarded. Perhaps the others 
ill not be sixteen years old until the middle of their sophomore 
ear and consequently they would graduate when they are eighteen, 
hich is the normal age. Of those whom I have listed as two 
ears retarded I know very little of their home life. I do know 
hat Gaynelle was very ill for more than a year and was forced to 
ithdraw from school. She is a very bright girl, and only her 
lIness could have retarded her. Jack, Joseph, and Vernon are of 
he type of boy who is just naturally slow in some subjects and 
loesn’t worry much about it. No doubt Joseph and Vernon have 
ore than freshman rating and are repeating this course. Faye 
eems to be quick to see things and seems to get along well in the 
ork. I cannot understand why she is retarded. 
The teacher of this class seems to pay no attention to individual 
ifferences. The same assignment is given to all the pupils. One

of the best students already had that lesson prepared. Instead o! 
giving those students some extra or advance work he told them tc 
use the study hour as they pleased. Those students were ready tc 
go on, and it was wasting their time for them to wait for the slower 
ones. The teacher could provide for these students by giving ther 
extra work not in the text, thereby keeping them interested.

Aim. To become acquainted with the instructional equipment 
to which the student is later to have access in teaching and 
to obtain an understanding of the equipment necessary in 
the classroom or laboratory. 
Recitation room (nonlaboratory subjects). The instructional 
equipment needed in a recitation room will of course vary with 
the type of work which is going on there. If the reading-room 
is well equipped (assuming that pupils study in one room and 
recite in another) the reference material in the recitation room 
may be reduced to a minimum. This minimum should consist 
of such reference books as classroom discussions are likely to 
bring into requisition. In the case of English classes this may 
well include, in addition to a set of maps, an encyclopedia and an 
unabridged dictionary. An encyclopedia from which pronuncia- 
tion may be obtained is, other things being equal, much to be 
referred. Classes in which mathematics is being taught should 
contain such mathematical equipment as compasses, yard and 
eter sticks, and models. And so through the list of subjects 
aught. Each will call for special classroom equipment. 
Recitation room (laboratory subjects). Recitation rooms in 
hich physics, chemistry, biology, domestic science, or agricul- 
ure is being taught should be equipped so as to make it possible 
0 carry out experimental demonstrations before the class. In 
uch classes raised seats are to be preferred, as they will greatly 
id pupils in viewing the demonstration. The seats should be 
rovided with writing supports of suitable size to enable the 
upils to write and draw freely during the class demonstration 
r lectures. The demonstration desk may or may not contain

a sink with a water tap. In general it is to be recommended 
especially in the case of chemistry, biology, and domestic science 
that these fixtures be attached to the desk. Water is so seldon 
used in the demonstrations in other laboratory classes that < 
tap near the demonstration desk will suffice. A storage cabine’ 
just behind the instructor’s desk will save much running bacl 
‘and forth to the storeroom for materials. Fig. 19 represents ar 
instructor’s desk suitable for both physics and chemistry. 
The student should look for the following particulars in the 
desk of an instructor in physics: 
1. The top should be of hard, close-grained wood or other materia 
suitable to withstand ordinary mechanical pressure. 
2. The desk should contain a sink with a water tap, also gas and elec 
tric fixtures if gas and electricity are available. 
3. It should contain roomy drawers and cupboards, which should be 
fitted with locks. : 
4.A toe space enables the instructor to stand near the desk whil 
working. 
5. Mercury sink is desirable, though not a necessity. 
6. Sink covers are desirable. 
7. One fireproof cupboard is desirable. 
8. The desk should be supplied with uprights and an adjustabk 
crossbar. 
9. The desk should contain a drawer about five feet in length, ir 
which glass tubing may be kept. This drawer should be so divided tha 
tubes of various sizes may be separated. 
The student should look for the following features in the desl 
of an instructor in chemistry : 
1. The top should be of hard, close-grained wood, preferably birch 
properly oiled and treated, or of soapstone or other material suitable t« 
withstand chemical action or ordinary mechanical pressure. A top 0! 
very hard material, say cement, would cause undue breakage. 
2. The desk should contain a sink with a water tap, also gas and elec 
tric fixtures if gas and electricity are to be had. 
3. It should contain roomy drawers and cupboards, which should b 
supplied with locks. +

that when the hood is removed the opening in the top of the desk ma 
be closed. 
5. A toe space enables the instructor to stand near the desk whil

6. A mercury sink is desirable, though not a necessity. 
7. Sink covers are very desirable if the desk is used by a physics in 
structor also. They give the advantage of more table space. 
8. An asbestos pad is desirable for the protection of the top in th 
immediate vicinity of the demonstration and for the support of furnace: 
g. A wire-glass shield may be used to protect pupils in the front row 
from the effects of sputtering chemicals in demonstrations. 
to. The desk should contain a drawer about five feet in length, i 
which glass tubing may be kept. This drawer should be so divided tha 
tubes of various sizes may be separated. 
A. Ashmun Kelly* speaks as follows on the matter of treatin 
table tops for use in the chemistry laboratory or lecture room 
Owing to the fact that glass vessels and other breakable things are i 
constant use on the laboratory table it is not expedient to use marble 
slate, glass, or other hard surface, wood alone answering the purpose 
But wood becomes badly disfigured in a short time, from the spilling o 
the different chemicals on it so that it becomes necessary to renovate i 
frequently, or seek some sort of coating for it that will be immune t 
the action of chemicals. Such a treatment has been discovered. Here i

These solutions are to be applied in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 1,

ou apply the next coat. This is very important. The liquids are ap- 
lied with a bristle brush, like a water stain, allowing the wood to absorb 
ll of each coating that it will take up, in order to make the work more 
ffectual and lasting. The soap suds fix the color, which is intensified by 
he sulphuric acid. After the soap solution is dry the surface is rubbed 
ith vaseline, which gives a soft and pleasing finish, besides repelling 
ater. The treatment involves a great deal of hard rubbing and time, 
ut the work is well worth the time and trouble, and the expense, out- 
ide of the labor, is small.+ 
Fig. 20 represents an instructor’s desk suitable for the biology 
lassroom. 
The student should look for the following particulars in the 
lesk of an instructor in biology: 
1. The desk should contain cupboards and drawers that afford con- 
enient storage room. 
2. The desk should contain a water tap and sink. 
3. An aquarium is a very necessary adjunct to a laboratory in the 
aintenance of healthy specimens. However, it may be placed else- 
here than upon the desk. 
4. Toe space is desirable (see Fig. 20).

LABORATORY 
Student should prepare a list of equipment necessary. Inas- 
wuch as the equipment needed will vary, depending much upon 
he manual that is being followed, it is impossible to set up 
inimum essentials for a laboratory course. The student, how- 
er, should study the extent to which the equipment is ade- 
ate to the requirements of the manual used. Some manuals 
ill contain a list of the apparatus needed, whereas for others 
will be necessary to go through the experiments and compile 
e list. This task is complicated by the fact that instructors 
ually omit a few experiments and add others. For this reason 
e student in working out this lesson should sit down with the 
structor and list the experiments to be used ; then, with the aid 
the manual and perhaps further aid of the instructor or critic 
acher in charge, he should determine the equipment needed. 
List of apparatus needed should be checked against apparatus 
laboratory and storeroom. After the student has compiled a 
t of the apparatus needed, the next task is that of surveying 
e laboratory and storeroom to determine the presence and 
ndition of the apparatus available. While the student is 
ecking over the apparatus, he should attempt to fix in mind 
e location of each piece. This will save considerable time 
en the student later has the task of setting up apparatus for 
ss demonstration or has charge of a laboratory period.

Size, construction, and arrangement of laboratory tables for 
an important item of observation. It is here that the pupils ¢ 
much of their real work. Conditions that would entirely sli 
the attention of any but the skilled observer may serious! 
handicap the pupils at work. 
Lighting is a very important consideration in all laboratorie 
In the first place, the light should enter the room from one sic 
J LU Fic. 22. Proper Arrangement of Laboratory Tables with Respect to Lightii 
Pupils should work on the sides of the tables which allow the major part of the lig 
rays to fall upon the work from the left and rear 
only. That side, however, should have considerable windo 
space, so as to flood the room with an abundance of light. 
north room is preferable because of the ill effects of the dire 
rays of the sun, especially when rhicroscopes are being use 
The arrangement of the tables with respect to the source of lig 
also is an important item. The tables should be so placed th; 
the long side projects away from the windows. This will p: 
vent one pupil’s working in the light of another. Lloyd a 
Bigelow recommend V-shaped tables for biology, the narr 
end being farthest from the windows. The main objection 
this is that if the narrow end is wide enough the other end is t 
wide. Hence the extra expense would make such an arran; 
ment undesirable. Fig. 22 shows a proper lighting condition.

In going over the apparatus and equipment at XXX High Scho

LESSON XIV 145 
any things were there which are not listed here. A few of them 
e to be used in special work at the discretion of the instructor ; 
so many are used in demonstration. On the whole this high 
hool has about the best-equipped laboratory (chemical) of any 
its size that I have ever seen. 
In examining the laboratory tables used by the students I 
scovered the following things: 
1. They are so made as to accommodate four students. A good fea- 
re about them is that the student works facing the front of the room, 
\d no one works across from him. This is an advantage as nothing that 
being done by one student can in any way hinder another facing him. 
2. On top of the tables are metal uprights holding two glass reagent 
elves. Each student is supplied with one, with the necessary reagent 
ottles. 
3. There are one gas cock and one water tap for each individual, and 
e sinks are so arranged that two students can use the same one. The 
nk is placed between the two and contains a shelf for the preparation 
‘certain gases. This in itself is a very fine feature. 
4. The top of the table is made of soapstone. There arises in one’s 
ind a question about the suitability of such material when breakage of 
ss articles is so common in the chemistry laboratory. On inquiry, 
wever, I found that only one student out of a class of twenty-five had 
loken anything on the table, and this was caused by a flaw in the prepa- 
ion of the article. A soapstone surface is suitable for several reasons: 
a. It withstands chemical action and ordinary mechanical pressure. 
b. If a gas jet is accidentally knocked over, as is done fairly often, the 
does not in any way affect the surface. 
c. Any sticky substance that tends to adhere to the surface, such as 
raffin, can easily be scraped off with a piece of metal or glass. 
5. Immediately under the top is a sliding writing-leaf. It eliminates 
necessity of writing up the experiment on the table top, and prevents 
due soiling. 
6. The body proper of the table is made of birch, and it contains six 
all drawers, each equipped with a lock, and a large cupboard. This 
board is big enough to hold such equipment as ring stands, pneumatic 
ughs, etc. for two students. The whole table contains two cupboards 
twenty-four drawers, six being on each side of a cupboard. 
7. There is no toe space at the bottom of the table. This, however, 
trivial matter, to my mind.

146 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
8. A jar for waste material stands at each end of the table. Two 
these receptacles are sufficient to accommodate four students. 
9. The one disadvantage that I saw was the distance between t 
tables. When a student is at work he takes up practically the enti 
aisle space, consequently hindering the movement of another pers 
passing through the aisle. 
to. Windows are arranged at both the south and west ends of t 
room, and sufficient light is furnished to enable the student to work wi 
ease of vision. This arrangement also might be considered a disa 
vantage, because the best lighting effect can be obtained by windows | 
one side of the room only. 
1. Stools were in the aisles but were apparently useless, for no o 
used them while at work. One reason for this is that the length of t 
work period is so short that the experiments must be done rapidly, a! 
none of the students write up their work in the laboratory owing to t 
time element. Consequently access to the writing-leaf under the tak 
is unnecessary in this case. 
12. A hood for work with poisonous gases extends along the enti 
side of the room opposite the windows. 
The instructor’s desk is not in the laboratory but in the recit 
tion room. The reason for this is to enable all the students 
witness the demonstrations, which is possible in the recitation roo 
because of the elevated seats. In the laboratory the class mu 
either crowd up in the front of the room or stay at their respecti 
tables, where they cannot see the demonstration clearly beca 
of the uprights in front of them. Consequently the reason for hi 
ing the instructor’s desk in the classroom is a logical one. 
In examining the desk I discovered the following facts: 
1. It very much resembles the tables used by the students, except t! 
the uprights and reagent shelves were missing, and the drawers and c 
board are larger. They contain different apparatus, such as electri 
mechanical, and glass articles. 
2. There is no hood on the desk, nor are asbestos pads to be se} 
The latter would not be necessary on a soapstone surface. 
Behind the instructor’s desk is located a large cabinet, in wh 
is stored such materials as are likely to be used during classro 
demonstrations. This is a very desirable feature, as it economi 
the instructor’s time and energy.

The room that I visited is not well equipped for a kindergarten. 
Ithough but few articles are needed, the equipment as a whole 
not well suited to the requirements. There is a good blackboard 
| the room, but it is too high to be used by the pupils themselves. 
he reason for this is that the room was formerly occupied by pupils 
1 the upper grades. There is no circle on the floor, as is common 
| kindergartens. This matter could be easily remedied. 
With respect to the children’s tables, there is but one table in the 
yom in which I am observing. Since the table is but four feet by 
ght feet, it does not provide the necessary room for all to work at 
e same time. Nor is it constructed to meet the needs of the chil- 
en. The top is not marked off into squares as it should be. It is 
combination of sand table and work table, the sand being kept 
derneath the table top, which is removable. As a result the 
wer part of the basin is so low that it prevents the children from 
ting up to it. Since the chairs are all too high, the situation is 
ceptionally bad. The sand table is too shallow, being only three 
ches deep. It is not lined with metal. As the legs have no 
sters, it is almost impossible to move the table. The supply case 
old but answers every purpose. There is a good piano in the 
lom. This is very desirable for use in connection with plays and 
mes. Green burlap forms a wall board upon which to pin the 
ildren’s paper clippings. 
All in all, the room is very unsatisfactorily equipped.
-P-A-G-E-160
LESSON XV 
Aim. To appreciate the provisions which the school has mac 
for study. 
The homes from which the pupils come are so varied wit 
respect to opportunities and incentives for supervised stud 
that it is very essential that schools provide in a large measu 
for it. For illustration, let us assume two pupils of the san 
age and grade taking the same assignment home for prepar 
tion. Pupil A goes to a home of considerable culture and mean 
He has a comfortable study of his own, which contains mar 
reference books. Fond parents encourage him to go there ar 
prepare his lesson. He is offered a reward for high scholarshij 
Moreover, older brothers or sisters or the parents themselv 
are ready to help him over a difficulty in the lesson at any tim 
In contrast to this, picture the home into which pupil B goes 1 
prepare his lesson for the morrow. The only comfortable roo: 
in the house is the kitchen or dining-room. He has no referen 
material. The father, who is lukewarm to anything for whi 
he does not see an almost immediate dollars-and-cents outco! 
is reading the newspaper. He wishes to read aloud and co 
ment on interesting sections for the benefit of the rest. T 
younger brothers are engaging in their daily evening quar 
over playthings, and the mother, who means well, drives all 
distraction by her incessant scolding. Pupil B gets neither a 
nor encouragement. A returns to school on the morrow with 
well-prepared lesson and B with scarcely any preparatioj 
Hence the importance of having much of B’s work done at t 
school. At least B must go home so well prepared to attack t 
lesson that he will need neither reference books nor aid.

LESSON XV 149 
While the grade schools are providing plenty of opportunity 
or study in the building, as far as the material and adminis- 
rative equipment are concerned, many of the new high schools 
re being fashioned after the higher institutions of learning 
1 this respect. Such schools generally have a library fairly 
fell equipped with reference material and supervised by one 
f the teachers during each hour of the school day. Such a 
brary often will not seat more than one hundred pupils out 
f the one thousand that are in the building. For this reason 
he pupils are encouraged to go home as soon as the morning or 
fternoon class periods are over. The pupils who go to the 
brary often arrange themselves in such groups that little 
rious study is possible. John means to work, but he has seated 
imself directly opposite Mary. The result is that while the 
ages are being turned the thoughts of both are less than 50 per 
nt on the lesson. Then, too, equipment such as books, paper, 
ncils, rulers, etc. is kept in lockers. The pupil sits down to 
ork and finds that he has not all the needed materials. All 
all, he is fortunate indeed if out of the hour he gets in more 
an twenty minutes of serious study. 
The old-fashioned study room with individual desks for all 
ems preferable. At least they help many a pupil to get the 
ace habit of study. He does not have to get accustomed to 
w surroundings every time he sits down to study. Those who 
terfere with each other’s study may be forced to sit apart. 
he study hall should not be closed immediately after school 
urs, but rather the pupils should be encouraged to remain and 
udy. The room should be well equipped for artificial lighting. 
Instead of providing one large assembly hall for all pupils it 
better to have three or more smaller ones. In the first place, 
is difficult properly to light the large room. In the second 
lace, more thoroughgoing supervision of the study hall is pos- 
ible with the more homogeneous groups. It may be objected 
at such an arrangement would require more teacher-hours
-P-A-G-E-162
  150 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
to be spent in assembly rooms. Such an objection is not vali 
unless the school is very small or one considers the teacher 
presence in the room to be more in the nature of police dut 
than of helpful supervision.

   At XXX High School forty minutes of the school hour are given 
lo recitation, and the remaining twenty-four minutes are used as 
supervised-study period. During this period the teacher some- 
imes walks around the room giving help to those who need it, and 
jometimes he remains at his desk and the pupils go to him for help 
mn the advance lesson. There are large session rooms in the build- 
g, which are used for assembly and study rooms. Each student 
as an assigned seat in one session room, or “home room,” to which 
must report in the morning and at noon. It is in his session- 
loom desk that the student keeps his books. Most of the students 
ave a schedule of four recitations a day. Since the day is divided 
to five hours an extra hour is without assignment, and at this 
ime the student reports to the session room and studies for an hour 
t his own desk. The students are permitted to go to the library 
t this time for reference work. A clerk marks on each pupil’s 
lip the time when he leaves the library. He also helps the stu- 
lents find reference books. The library is at all times in the 
harge of a classroom instructor. 
There are four large session rooms in XXX High School, and 
e students are divided pretty accurately according to their grades. 
ll the session rooms are on the east side of the building: two on 
e first floor, and two on the second. The entire east wall in each 
loom is window space. There is plenty of natural light on bright 
ays, and the electric lights are well placed. The heating and 
entilating of the room are very well arranged to produce the best

results. The seats are not adjustable, and all are of about th 
same size. This is very unfortunate, since all pupils are not o 
the same size. The desks have inkwells, pencil grooves, and place 
for books. 
At the front of session rooms are bookcases with reference mate 
rial—not a great deal, however, since most of the reference book 
are in the school library. 
There is at least one good picture on the front wall of eac! 
session room. The walls of these rooms are very clean and ar 
tastefully decorated. The rooms are very well kept, as are all th 
rooms in the building.

does not permit desirable grouping of the pupils for instructiona 
purposes. 
The building contains a “make-up” room to which pupils wh 
for various reasons are failing are sent for special coaching. Thi 
room is full most of the time. Since the group is of course ver 
heterogeneous, the teacher can give but little time to each pupil 
I have been impressed with the fact that a large majority of th 
pupils in the make-up room appear to be retarded in mental d 
velopment. The make-up room seems to me to be used largely f 
the purpose of trying to help the dull pupils keep up with t 
bright ones.

LESSON XVI 
Aim. To understand the procedure of supervised study. 
Supervised study the result of change in fundamental point of 
riew. Formerly we looked upon the school as having fulfilled 
ts purpose when the pupils knew a given number of facts or 
ould perform creditably the fundamental operations reading, 
riting, spelling, and arithmetic. It was comparatively satis- 
actory then to have much of the required drilling done outside 
lhe school, the pupils during the class period reciting upon the 
acts or producing evidence of skill attained in the performance 
f previously assigned tasks. Such learning is largely, if not 
ntirely, on the memory level and as such lends itself readily 
the recitation and unsupervised-study methods. Recently, 
owever, we have focused our attention upon other outcomes. 
it is the interpretation of the facts and the use of the skills that 
terest us. The tasks that we set before our pupils are on a 
igher level; and hence they need more supervision in their 
erformance, if much time and ultimate efficiency are not lost. 
Supervised study should develop the pupil’s initiative and 
bility to help himself. A serious defect in the method of as- 
ignment and recitation lay in the fact that bad methods of 
tudy persisted throughout the pupil’s school days. He did not 
arn how to gather the essential points and properly coérdinate 
nd subordinate them. One sentence was as important as an- 
ther; nothing stood out in his thinking. In fact reflective 
inking was seldom done. To quote Professor H. L. Miller+:

  154 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
The immature pupil in isolated home study too frequently energize 
far below his optimum. He is likely to be confused as to the purpos 
and value of his efforts. While it is no doubt true that in outsid 
preparation of lessons many pupils develop individual initiative and 
certain independence in following up assignments on their own respor 
sibility, it must be obvious that large numbers fail to make satisfactor 
progress. It is recognized further that home preparation of lessons fo 
subsequent recitation in class. has contributed to the development 
mutually interpenetrating interests between the home and the schoo 
Connections of a valuable sort are established in spite of the feelin 
which often finds expression in the charge that parents and tutors (wit 
or without compensation) are required to do the teaching, while th 
instructional staff merely assigns and hears the lessons under the recita 
tion system. The procedure suggested in the interpretation of super 
vised study in this report undertakes to reverse in a large measure th 
preparation-recitation order. In the redirected class period the pupil i 
to know at once whether he is working along fruitful lines. What h 
does is checked and evaluated not only by individual oversight but als 
through the coéperative efforts of pupils working together. He is taugh 
to examine data for himself, to think his way through by the use o 
organizing principles, to arrive at conclusions for himself, and to submi 
his results to the scrutiny of the group in which he is working. 
Teacher’s main task in study hall to supervise study. Th 
teacher is successful in the study hall largely to the extent t 
which he is able effectively to supervise and improve the pupil: 
studying. The problem of general discipline must not be ove 
looked. Effective supervision cannot go on in a disorderl 
room. However, the fact remains that the teacher’s work is n 
finished when order has been obtained. It is then that he mu 
go about among the pupils for the purpose of guiding those wh 
seem to need guidance. 
Comprehensive knowledge of subject and its special metho 
necessary. It goes without saying that the teacher cannot e: 
fectively supervise the pupil’s study in a field in which he h 
little knowledge of the content and in which no attention h 
been given to special methods. Hence it follows that the mo:
-P-A-G-E-167
  LESSON XVI 155 
ffective supervision can be carried on only by specialists in the 
ields to be supervised. Ideally, for example, only teachers of 
nathematics should supervise the study of mathematics. To 
arry this out effectively would require that the study programs 
f the mathematics pupils be so prepared as to require the study 
f mathematics at stated periods. During the periods one or two 
epresentatives of the department of mathematics should be 
resent for supervisory purposes. Aside from those who are to 
upervise the studying there should be a teather in general 
harge of the room whose duty it is to maintain order and check 
he attendance. , 
| Classroom supervision more desirable but more expensive. A 
ore desirable arrangement, but one which is still more ex- 
ensive, is that of increasing the length of theclass period and 
levoting at least half the period-to the supervision of study. 
in this way pupils spend their entire day in classrooms. This 
lan has the following advantages over the study-hall type of 
pervision : 
1. All pupils in the room are studying the same thing. Hence the 
acher can explain an important point to all at once, if desirable. 
2. There is the advantage of the place-study habit. 
3. The teacher knows the recitation difficulties of each pupil. 
4. Recitation difficulties are fresh in the minds of the pupils. 
5. The groups to be supervised are smaller. ‘ 
6. There is little outside attraction as compared with a study hall. 
7. Classroom equipment, such as maps, board, graphs, etc., is close at 
nd. 
Study-hall supervision has the following advantages over 
lassroom supervision of study: 
1. It may be so administered as to conserve floor space (utilizes space 
herwise used for auditorium). 
2. It may lessen the cost of supervision per pupil-hour by increasing 
e size of the group being supervised. 
3. The pupil is more likely to have his personal equipment with him. 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
Classroom supervision has the following disadvantages: 
1. The teacher may run the recitation over into the study period. 
2. Teachers may spend the supervised-study period in correctir 
papers or some other work of that nature. 
Study-hall supervision has the following disadvantages : 
1. Many pupils in the same room studying many different subjec 
make supervision by general teachers less efficient. 
2. Teachers do not know the recitation difficulties of the individu 
pupils. 
3. Recitation difficulties are not fresh in the minds of the pupils. 
4. The group to be supervised is large. 
5. There is more going on in the large study hall, which is likely t 
attract the pupil’s attention. 
6. There is less opportunity for motivation and problem or proje 
work. 
7. The atmosphere of the study hall is not always conducive to it 
dividual initiative. 
All in all, it seems desirable that at least half of the pupil: 
studying be done in the classroom under the direction of th 
regular teacher. The other half may be done in study halls ¢ 
at home. In case crowded conditions and lack of money dé 
mand that auditorium space be given over to a large assembl 
hall and that classroom study be abandoned, more of th 
teacher’s time being used for hearing recitations, it is necessar 
that an effective type of supervised study, such as we have d 
scribed above, be carried on in a large study hall or, preferably 
in three or four smaller ones. In case small study halls are use 
it seems advisable to recommend that students be assigned 
them as far as possible by subject rather than by grade. 
would aid materially in effective supervision if most of t 
pupils studying mathematics could be counted on to be in 
given study hall at a stated time and if their study progra: 
could be made out so that their mathematics lessons would

ber of the department of mathematics to this study hall at t

tated hour. Such a teacher would be likely to supervise studies 
1 mathematics much more effectively than an instructor in 
nglish would. 
Subjects vary in amount and kind of supervision required. 
Jthough it is impossible as yet to state accurately the amount 
f supervision necessary for effective preparation of lessons in 
ach of the various subjects, it is a fair assumption that this 
mount varies with the subject under consideration. The more 
bstract subjects necessitate more close attention to the activity 
f the individual pupil than do subjects requiring considerable 
sading but having a content less difficult to understand. The 
ibject of mathematics, for example, might well be expected to 
>quite daily supervision by the classroom teacher, each teacher 
tending only to the group which she has had during the 
evious recitation period. On the other hand, it may be a 
aste of time to attempt the supervision of history in the 
me manner. Perhaps all the pupils should be collected in 
e large assembly room that has been well equipped with his- 
rical reference material and placed under the direction of one 
more teachers. The teacher’s work in this case would corre- 
ond rather closely to that of library directing. He would 
rect the pupils to reference material, see that material is 
turned properly to the shelves, direct the pupils’ interpreta- 
ion of difficult passages, etc. This practice would correspond 
ite closely to the supervision carried on in laboratories. As 
as intimated above, there is much need for careful experi- 
entation as to both the amount and the form of supervision 
sirable in each subject. We can at best make only tentative 
iggestions. It is our purpose here to make the prospective 
acher fully aware of the fact that there are problems in this 
Id which will demand his consideration rather than to attempt 
formulate a solution.

fact he may do much to spoil good habits of study previous! 
established. Likewise the assignment that says “Take to pa; 
so and so” does nothing to set the pupil to reading with 
problem or aim in mind. Hence he does not weigh and arran; 
the facts so as to eventuate somewhere. His study is therel 
disintegrated and ineffective except as isolated facts may rema 
in consciousness long enough to be given back to the inefficier 
teacher. On the other hand, the teacher who conducts tl 
lesson and makes the assignments in an effective manner do 
much to improve the quality of the study. 
Process of supervising study must conform to canons of goc 
teaching. To begin with, as the classroom teacher must appr 
ciate the apperceptive background of the class as a whole, : 
must the supervisor appreciate the apperceptive backgrour 
of the pupil whom he is about to help. It is to no small exte: 
for this reason that the supervision of the pupil’s study by tl 
regular classroom teacher immediately after the recitatic 
period should be most effective. He most truly appreciates tl 
limitations of the individual at this time. A study-hall supe 
visor other than the pupil’s regular teacher, though he is ver 
skillful in the art of supervision and knows the subject, has th 
great limitation to his effort ; namely, he has not the backgrour 
for understanding the needs of each pupil that is possessed t 
the one who has conducted a classroom discussion of the pr 
vious lesson. A vital element in good instruction is lackin 
The element of familiarity with the pupils must also be co 
sidered. The study-hall supervisor will be more or less a strang 
and hence more difficult to approach. The teaching situati 
demands a friendly acquaintance between teacher and pupil. 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  LESSON XVI 159 
Having mentally surveyed the pupil’s apperceptive back- 
round, the teacher must next lead him by questions so to 
jarshal his experience% as to throw light upon the problem at 
and. To do this skillfully is the perfection of art as well as 
1e crowning point of effective supervision. It matters not 
ow carefully the administrative plans for supervision have 
een laid; if the teacher fail at this point, the supervision of 
struction falls to the ground. An insight that tells us to what 
xtent to help and an art that has been developed to carry out 
1e process will prevent supervised study from becoming, as 
ne educator has characterized it, “organized interference.”

At 2.30 P.M. the supervisor entered the room and immediately

m a plot of the room. After the roll was taken about twenty 
pils gathered round him for the purpose of obtaining slips per- 
itting them to go to the library. As each returned he presented 
igned slip from the librarian. 
The study hall contains a hundred and twenty-five seats. Only 
e is adjustable. They are for the most part in good order. 
e supervisor informed me that 20 per cent of the seats had 
iginally been adjustable, but the janitors had removed all but 
le of these seats to other rooms, 
About 75 per cent of the pupils were working. Eight pupils

e others were talking to.each other and wasting time in general, 
sides disturbing those around them. 
(There was no attempt at supervising the work of the pupils. In

ld hence the one in charge of the study hall is expected only to

paper and given to a girl who collects the slips from the various 
dy halls, after which she takes them to the principal’s office.

The room is well heated by steam radiators. The ventilati 
facilities are good, but the fans were not running when I was the: 
thus making the room somewhat stuffy. There was plenty of ligl 
ing space (I estimated it at one fourth of the floor space). T 
light came from the left, with the exception of that which car 
through two glass doors which opened upon the corridor at t 
right. In spite of the fact that the space for the admission 
natural light was adequate, there was need of supplementary ar 
ficial light on this day, which was dark. The artificial lighti 
was bad. There were sockets for twenty bulbs; but only ni 
were supplied, and they were not properly shaded.

Session room 214 was the one in which I observed a fourth-hc 
class at work. There are one hundred and twenty-three seats 
this room, but only about forty-four pupils were present during t 
fourth hour. Most of the pupils seemed to be very busy, but thi 
of them seemed to be idling away their time. The teacher w 
had charge of the room is a mathematics instructor, and her or 
duty is to take the roll and keep order. Of course, she can he 
those who want help in mathematics, but those who wish assistar 
in some other subject have to go elsewhere. The teacher remai 
at her desk in the back of the room, and those desiring help go 
her for it; she does not walk round the room offering aid to th« 
who need it. All pupils not in classes are expected to be in th 
respective study halls at work unless they have been excused 
take part in some school activity such as the orchestra, the weel 
paper, or the football team. There are no students to be seen lo 
ing around in the halls during the class period. The only ones in 
halls are those going to and from the library. Each pupil pla 
his name on a slip of paper and presents it to the teacher in chai 
of the session room when he wishes to go to the library.

idents must at all times ask permission to leave the study hall. 
owever, the students use the dictionary in the study room and the 
ference books without asking permission. The reference books 
the study room are used occasionally, but those in the library 
e used often. 
The study room was very stuffy the day I was there, and only 
‘0 windows were raised slightly. Both doors to the room were 
en; but the air was not as fresh as it might have been, had 
ore of the windows been lowered from the top. The window 
ades were well arranged to obtain good light in the room. It was 
very bright day, and there was no need for artificial light. The 
ntilation is the only thing I would have changed. 
CLassRooM 
The study period that follows the recitation is a twenty-four- 
inute period. The recitation helps to clear up difficult steps in 
e type of problem the class is studying and paves the way for the 
oblems attacked during the study period. In this way the recita- 
m is conducive to better study. The assignment is made with 
thought of improving the pupils’ study. A certain number of 
blems is assigned, and each student is expected to do his or her 
st with them. The teacher sometimes walks round the room 
ping those who wish to be helped, and sometimes he remains 
his desk and the students go to him for help. Very seldom does 
teacher engage in other work while the pupils are studying. 
ly one day have I noticed the teacher doing other work. That 
time he was preparing some letters to be mailed, which no 
bt referred to work on the year book, for he is helping with 
t work. Many times when helping one pupil over a difficult 
t of a problem he makes a suggestion to the entire class con- 
ning that problem. He is very observant of the light and venti- 
ion of the room, and I believe that at no time could I have 
roved on the physical condition of the room.

  PART II 
INTRODUCTION 
Part II deals with the instructional phase of classroom acti 
ity. Up to this point the student has been studying and obser 
ing the setting and tools more or less apart from the teachi 
process itself. He is now to center his attention upon metho 
of instruction. In general one may say he is shifting his atte 
tion from the form to the process. The earlier lessons, if fait 
fully carried out, have acquainted him fully with the setting 
which the immediate processes of instruction are to take pla 
He knows each pupil, including something about his strong a 
weak points. He has likewise become acquainted with t 
classroom teacher. Hence he is in a better position to evaluc 
instructional technique. 
Lessons XVII and XVIII are not accompanied by obser 
tion. The student, however, must study them with great ca 
since they form a basis for the observations that follow. 
example, one cannot use intelligently the terms ‘method 
“devices,” and “technique” without first strictly defining t 
terms. This is done in Lesson XVII. One must understa 
what is meant by goals and fully appreciate the fact that th 
must be clearly before the mind of the one who is to dire 
effectively any activity that is above the level of mere hak 
This is done in Lesson XVIII, which includes also examples 
remote and immediate aims. 
Careful attention should be given to those aims dealing wi 
the subject in which the student is observing. It is particula 
important in dealing with general or remote aims that t

ident master the thought and express the aims in words other 
an those of the text. It is conceivable that a student might 
e aims which have been copied verbatim and get no benefit 
iatever from the process. The statement of an aim is of value 
ly to the teacher who has thought it out. This demands that 
ginning teachers acquire a philosophy of education as rapidly 
possible. Method in any complete sense has its basis in 
th educational philosophy and psychology. Educational phi- 
ophy guides us in determining what we should accomplish. 
ychology guides us in determining the method of attack. 
n dealing with Lesson XXII the student should center at- 
tion upon those special devices which apply to the subject 
der observation.

  LESSON XVII 
Aim. To develop the ability to distinguish between metho 
device, and technique and to classify each. 
Distinction between method, device, and technique. Profess: 
H. W. Nutt defines “method” as “the characteristic ment 
procedure of the mind of the learner in attending to any obje 
that is brought before it for consideration.” He says: 
This characteristic mental procedure is as follows: The mind first se 
the object as a vague whole; it then analyzes the object, noting : 
prominent characteristics; it discovers some dominant characterist 
and reorganizes the object around this dominant characteristic; t 
same form of analysis and reorganization takes place whenever t 
object, or one similar to it, is present before the mind, until it becor 
the habitual form of reaction of the mind to such an object. 
It is already clear to the reader that this is not the comm 
use of the word “method.” However, it is a valuable use of t 
term and is the only one possible if one is to make a logical 
perfect distinction between methods, device, and techniq; 
This will be seen readily when we come to define “device.” 
If method is the characteristic procedure of the mind of t! 
learner, then the principles of method applied to teaching 
come the psychological laws governing the mode of presentati 
of new material. How rapidly should new material be inti 
duced? Should one proceed inductively or deductively? Is t| 
material suited to the age and experience of the pupils? Th 
are questions of method. The device is a tool by means 
which the method functions. The question is a device that m

e used in accord, or out of accord, with the principles of 
1ethod. The device has value only in so far as it aids, in bring- 
ag the material before the mind of the learner in accordance 
yith the psychological laws governing the mental processes. 
A teaching device is any means intended to facilitate the 
rocess of presenting material to the mind of the learner. 
ence we have two kinds of devices, mental and physical. 
‘lassrooms, blackboards, chalk, books, pencils, etc. afe ex- 
mples of physical devices, and lesson plans, questions, drills, 
xaminations, reviews, etc. are examples of mental devices. It 
; not always easy to distinguish sharply between the two classes 
f devices. This is owing to the fact that a physical device is 
_mental device embodied in material. Flash cards, for ex- 
mple, embody an idea relative to a means of drill. Hence 
lash cards are in a sense mental devices. We think of them as 
hysical because we turn our attention to that side of their 
ature. The question, on the other hand, is entirely mental 
n its nature. 
In distinguishing between device and technique we may 
hink of the device as the structure, or form, of the process, 
vhereas the procedure of causing, the form, or structure, to 
unction is the technique. Thus the forward pass is a football 
levice, but skill in handling the ball while the forward pass is 
ing carried out is the technique. Likewise developmental ex- 
osition is a plan of procedure adapted to increasing comprehen- 
ion. However, one has no more assurance of success because 
f its use than the quarter back has of advancing his team 
ecause he has called for a forward pass. Success will depend 
pon skilled technique. To quote Professor H. W. Nutt again, 
The asking of questions to develop a point is a device, but the 
umber of questions asked, the speed with which they are asked, 
he form of the questions, the attitude of the teacher manifested 
n asking the questions, etc., are points of technique.”

DEVICES 
MateriAL DEVICES 
Material devices classified as general and special. Devic 
may be classified on the material side as general and specic 
The general devices are those which are found in every clas 
room, regardless of what class is being taught there. TI 
textbook, for example, may be considered a general Americ 
device. The special devices, on the other hand, are those a u 
for which would be found in few, if any, other classes. 
Special devices most likely to be overlooked. It is because. 
the fact that the special device is narrow in its application th 
its presence or need is more likely to be overlooked by tl 
observer. One is more apt to note the lack of blackboard faci 
ties than the lack of a sufficient number of protractors. For tk 
reason it is desirable that the student teacher list the need 
special devices in preparing a lesson plan, or make a speci 
point of looking for them when observing. 
INTELLECTUAL DEVICES 
Intellectual devices may be classified under those applicab 
to lessons, examinations, and discipline. We shall discuss the 
in the foregoing order. 
LESSON TYPES 
Development method. The development method is a meth« 
of classroom instruction in which the new idea is obtain 
during the instruction hour through a process of questioning 
lecturing on the part of the teacher. There are two types 
development lesson: expository development and conyers 
tional development. These will generally be used together, 
though it is conceivable that one might be used to the exclusi 
of the other throughout the entire lesson period. It is tru
-P-A-G-E-181
  LESSON XVII 169 
ywever, that the amount of expository development will in- 
ease with the age and experience of the pupils. It is doubtful 
hether it should be used in classes below those of college rank 
r more than introductions to lessons and summaries of lessons. 
he teacher is tempted to overuse it because of the skill re- 
lired in successfully handling the conversational method. 
The question of approaching the lesson inductively or de- 
ictively will arise at this point. Our choice of either of those 
ethods of approach will depend upon the pupils’ present 
nowledge. If they are already familiar with the general prin- 
ple, the deductive attack will generally be most satisfactory. 
n the other hand, if the pupils are familiar with many specific 
stances, this fact should be used in developing the generaliza- 
on by means of the inductive method. In general the deduc- 
ve approach is the more rapid. 
The development method is coming more and more into com- 
on use. The class is no longer given over largely to the recita- 
mn of previously learned facts, valuable as this sometimes is. 
is educationally very desirable that pupils learn to take part 
the discovery of new truth, and the success of the teacher will 
pend much upon his ability to get them to do so. Not only 
ill the pupils retain longer the facts which they have helped 
discover, but in the process we may expect them to develop 
e habits of analysis and generalization. 
Recitation method. The recitation method was at one time 
ed almost exclusively. The pupils were assigned lessons 
hich were to be committed to memory. Generally the lessons 
nsisted of a series of factual statements that the pupils 
larned by rote. The weakness of the process in terms of edu- 
tional outcome lay in the fact that real thinking was not 
couraged. The pupils did not learn to determine the bases 
on which the assumptions rested. This method when used 
clusively is almost barren of any desirable educational out- 
me. However, there are times when the teacher must sound

  170 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
out the present knowledge of the class before going on with tl 
lesson. At such times the recitation method is needed. 
Project method. The project method increases pupil partic 
pation in the work. Under this method not only do the pupi 
participate in discovering new facts, but they aid in initiatir 
the process. The pupils in carrying out a project learn to an 
lyze problems, to locate materials, to give prolonged attention 1 
one thing, and finally to codperate in tasks of some magnitud 
The project may be limited to one lesson or it may extend ov 
weeks or even months. It develops initiative on the part « 
the pupils and gives them self-confidence and independence | 
study. The value of this result is too often overlooked. It w: 
an eventful day for most of us when we discovered that we we! 
not entirely dependent upon the teacher. Hence the proje: 
method of attack fulfills a vital aim in education. 
Experimental method. The experimental method of attack 
used oftenest under laboratory conditions in connection with tl 
physical and biological sciences. However, it is frequently 
valuable method of attacking a problem in the classroom. TI 
main difference between the laboratory method as used in tl 
laboratory and as used in the classroom is that in the forme 
instance each pupil or group of pupils actually handles tl 
materials in carrying out the experiment, whereas in the clas 
room situation the teacher demonstrates and the pupils observ 
The teacher-demonstration type of experimentation has the ac 
vantages of cheapness and timesaving. In the case of chemic: 
experimentation, safety comes in as an added argument fi

care must be taken to prevent the class exercise from becomir 
an hour of mere entertainment. This can be done by followir 
up the lesson with a quiz or with such work as will cause tk 
application of the facts developed. —

ring forth the desired response. Assuming, then, that desirable 
eural connections have been made, the teacher’s next con- 
deration is to make sure that these paths are so thoroughly 
uilt up that they will function in the future as well as in the 
resent. Of course, not all learning will demand drill; but 
ere is a certain minimum of form that is needed for orderly 
nd effective thinking, and this minimum should be drilled 
loroughly into the nervous system. For example, Spencer’s 
efinition of evolution is very useful to all who would think 
early with respect to the concept. Certain dates put back- 
one and form into history. We learn many kinds of tables 
ecause they are timesaving. 
The danger lies in the likelihood of drilling upon reactions 
hich have at best only a temporary use or no use at all. Few, 
any, now would ascribe any value to a reaction unless at 
yme future time in life that specific reaction will be needed. 
Je no longer speak of general mental discipline as an outcome 
drill. 
       
     
    
     
     
  EXAMINATION TYPES 
We may list under types of examination the final examination, 
e unexpected ten-minute written exercise, the “true-false” 
st, the multiple-choice test, and the incomplete-sentence test. 
e shall now proceed to examine into the merits of each. 
e final examination is, for the most part, only a grading de- 
ce. It is too late to use the facts gained thereby for purposes 
her than that of grading the pupils. It is generally, though it 
ed not be, a mere factual test which can be prepared for by 
e pupils, thus failing to test mental growth. Hence its value 
greatly overestimated. 
The purpose supposedly served by the final examination is 
uch better served by a short written exercise at unexpected 
es. The test can be made to cover assigned reading material, 
previous lecture, or a class exercise of the previous day and
-P-A-G-E-184
  172, OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
can be given with a view to assuring the teacher that the wo 
is being done. It is not too late to repeat the necessary wo 
or to change faulty technique. The laggard can be locat 
quickly in this manner and given remedial treatment. 
The remaining three types of test are much alike in purpo 
and method of giving. The “‘true-false” test consists in a seri 
of statements, based upon lectures and readings, which are to 
labeled “true” or “false” by the student. 
1. Columbus discovered America in 1593. True False 
2. Columbus received aid from the king and queen of Spa 
‘True False 
The multiple-choice test consists of a series of statemer 
with the choice of several words or phrases at indicated poir 
of each statement. The pupil selects the proper word or phra 
by underlining it. 
1. An example of a good conductor is glass, wood, copper, rope. 
2. A Leyden jar is a form of transformer, generator, dry cell, condens 
The incomplete-sentence test consists of a series of stat 
ments with parts omitted which are to be filled in by the pupi 
1. The sepals of a flower collectively constitute the ——. 
2. The ——, ——, and —— of a flower together constitute the pis: 
The last three tests mentioned above have the advantage 
being given and corrected quickly. Hence they enable the bu 
teacher to test the class more frequently. They also contain 
minimum of the subjective element; and this is desirable in 
test of information. They do not, however, give the student t 
practice of expressing himself effectively. They test only th 
part of the pupil’s experience which can be answered witho 
question in the form of Yes or No. They should not, therefo' 
be relied upon exclusively. 
For disciplinary devices, see Lesson IX.

  LESSON XVII 173 
TECHNIQUE 
We are now to focus our attention upon the technique of us- 
g devices. The device, though ever so well adapted to the 
urpose, if wrongly applied will fail. The golf club, though ever 
lo perfectly made, will not be effective in the hands of the 
ovice. There are ways of grasping it and of swinging it which 
re more likely to bring success to the average individual than 
lhe ways he would select were he not guided in the process by 
me who has observed those who have succeeded. At this point, 
owever, it is well to keep in mind that the technique which 
ill succeed with one will often fail with another, regardless of 
he effort put forth. And, conversely, one may succeed highly 
ith a technique generally condemned by experts. The writer 
ecalls at this point the remarks of a European expert who 
riticized the running form of the world’s fastest runner, saying 
hat he violated many of the supposed requirements for fleet- 
ess. The technique which succeeded when used by Paddock 
ould probably slow down many a less capable runner. Never- 
heless there is a body of technique worked out in all lines of 
xpertness which has chance in its favor and which merits a 
enuine effort to imitate it. 
Technique difficult to prepare for. There is a sense in which 
t is impossible to prepare in advance for the technique of 
eaching a lesson. One can determine the desired outcomes and 
the devices needed for the realization of those outcomes. But 
practice in the use of these devices can occur only while one is 
magining ‘the teaching of the lesson or when one is actually 
rarrying it on. Of course, one is indirectly preparing for tech- 
nique when one determines the outcomes to be striven for and 
the devices to be used, for one thereby outlines the form of the 
brocess of which the technique is the content. When the base- 
ball player determines upon a sacrifice hit and picks up an 
hppropriate bat for the purpose, he has taken the first two steps;      
   
         
      
      
     
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
his next step is the proper bodily activity in using the device 
He may prepare for this by imagining the approaching ball an 
going through the actions of bunting it, much as the shador 
boxer imagines his opponent and strikes and guards. This muc 
the teacher can do by way of imagining his class and thinkin 
through the process of instruction. However, as in the case c 
the shadow boxer, his opponent is not there in reality and he ca 
never become an accomplished artist except by practice in deal 
ing with a real situation. This does not mean that no goo 
comes from the mimic practice. It is very valuable, as is show 
by the great frequency of its use in other fields. The boxe 
prepares for his opponent in part by this method; the speake 
prepares in this way to deliver his oration. Hence the beginnin 
teacher may well think through the process of presentation anc 
for a while at least, actually carry out the work in his stud 
before an imaginary class. 
As technique becomes perfect it can be dropped more an 
more from consciousness. The objections to emphasizing teck 
nique in the early stages of training may be that thereby on 
brings about a consciousness of the process; and hence awk 
wardness follows. This objection comes from a failure to se 
the problem in its entirety. Any technique, effective or ineffec 
tive, must be conscious in its early stages. The teacher wh 
goes into the classroom to teach for the first tinie without hav 
ing first developed some technique through practice teachin 
must, like the student teacher, go through all the stages fror 
highly self-conscious technique to the stage of mastery in whic 
the tools are in the background of consciousness. The differenc 
is that his technique when once established is likely to be les 
effective. 
Artist not at best while technique is in foreground of con 
sciousness. It is not until one is free to devote his entire atter 
tion to the outcome that the best work is possible. The novic 
who must divide his attention between his brushes and paint

ind .the ideal which he is striving to represent will fall far 
hort of the master. A Beethoven forgets his piano and his 
buch, and is lost in his masterpiece. A writer is aware that 
le holds a pen only when it gives him trouble. Hence the 
xperienced teacher may well be expected to forget his tech- 
ique. But he will succeed only if that technique is perfect. 
t is therefore important that the technique which is being 
stablished be desirable. The unsupervised beginner is very 
kely to lose forever his chance of doing his best.

Aims. 1. To develop the idea that it is necessary for the teache 
at all times to keep before him the question of remote an 
immediate aims. 
2. Through studying examples of remote and immediat 
aims to become able to determine his aims as a teacher 
Formulation of aims. As we have stated elsewhere, it is nec 
essary that the teacher appear before the class with well-thought 
out_aims. Otherwise his selection of devices and technique wi 
be faulty. The amount of time that will be required will, o 
course, depend upon the teaching experience of the one prepat 
ing for the lesson. The teacher of considerable experienc 
especially if that experience has been in the subject for whic 
preparation is being made, can often determine the aim of th 
class while the group is convening. This, however, is not at a 
possible for the beginning teacher. His aims must be full 
thought out in terms of the general and the specific. For som 
time they should be written out also. 
Formulation of general aim. The general aim, or purpose 
for which a subject is taught should be clearly formulated i 
the mind of the teacher long before he attempts any teachings 
For, otherwise, how is he to determine the aims of the immedi 
ate lessons, select his devices, and prepare his technique? Th 
architect must know for what the building he is about to desig’ 
is to be used, and the contractor must know the plans of t 
architect, so that he may proceed step by step to the final acco 
plishment. Or to use another illustration, the woodsman mu 
know the direction in which the camp lies from his present pos: 
tion if each step is to count as one of a chain which is ultimatel

o bring him home. To fail to keep the direction of the final 
oal constantly in mind will mean wasted steps for the woods- 
nan and wasted exercises for the teacher. The following is a

Formulation of specific aims. Having determined the general 
, or the remote goal, the next step is to determine the imme- 
te goals—those which are to be striven for in the lesson of 
day. When we have determined the remote aims we have 
iented ourselves ; hence it will not be difficult to keep the im- 
diate goals so aligned that each in succession brings us nearer 
ultimate goal. Possible immediate goals that do not lead to 
desired end will not be striven for by the teacher who has 
arly in mind his ultimate goal. The teacher of a spelling 
iss, for example, who has as his ultimate aim the ability to 
11 correctly the words needed for general correspondence will 
t spend time in trying to teach unusual words or words often 
d but seldom written. 
mmediate aim generally compound. Lessons will differ with 
pect to the singleness or manifoldness of the immediate aim. 
ereas a lesson in spelling might have but one immediate aim, 
sson in history would be almost certain to have many. These 
mediate objectives, or aims, should be recognized in the les- 
plan. The following immediate aims are samples of those

LESSON XIX 4 
im. To determine by observation the immediate and remote 
outcomes of the lesson. 
  It seems a commonplace to state that the teacher should know 
hat he is about to do before entering the classroom. One will 
swer such a statement with an “Of course,” for one would 
lever think of entering any other field of activity without some 
ell-defined objective in mind. Yet that often happens in the 
resent-day schoolroom and, I think, more now than in the past. 
his situation is probably owing in part, at least, to the fact 
at at present there is some confusion among leaders of educa- 
onal thought as to just what the goals are which are possible 
d worthy of attainment. Some would strive almost entirely 
x disciplinary values; others, at the other extreme, would 
ain only for specific abilities, expecting no general transfer. 
lome greatly emphasize the vocational aim, others the civic- 
cial aim, and still others the cultural. 
With this state of affairs existing in the centers of educa- 
onal thought it is not to be wondered at that the classroom 
acher is not entirely clear on the remote aims of his efforts. 
Sut until he is clear about this matter and has some working 
hilosophy of education, be it good or bad, haziness concerning 
nmediate classroom aims is sure to result. It will help, how- 
ver, to list the possible remote outcomes as we have done in 
esson XVIII and to settle upon one or more of them as the 
oals toward which immediate outcomes of any given lesson 
re to be directed. 
Settling definitely upon an outcome has at once the advantage 
f enabling us to select appropriate devices in advance. The

  power of expression, for example, cannot be developed b 
lesson in which the pupil has no opportunity to express hims: 
The skilled workman decides what he wishes to construct 
then selects his tools with reference to the task he is about 
perform. The principle is the same in both cases. It is 
complexity of our task and the difficulty of measuring 
progress which cause us as teachers to overlook the need 
applying it here. 
Not only does the selection of immediate goals enable us 
choose our devices wisely ; it determines also, in a large measu 
the mode of applying those devices to the task at hand. 
hammer, which is a device, will be used largely for driving na 
if one is making a crate, but for drawing nails if one is taki 
acrate apart. Likewise, the technique of questioning will diff 
depending upon the outcome desired. If the outcome of 1 
lesson is the strengthening of neural bonds and the device is 
drill (by means of question and answer), the method of app 
ing the questions will differ from that used should the outco: 
be increased comprehension and the device the developmen 
question. This difference will be discussed later. It is our p 
pose here only to point out the fact that a difference of te 
nique is to be expected and that one should first have a cle 
notion of the outcome intended. 
The outcomes expressed in terms of neural changes for whi 
the student should observe were listed above as follows: 
Increased comprehension. 
Increased strength of neural bonds underlying recall. 
Increased physical skill. 
Increased mental skill. 
Increased moral insight. 
Increased strength of moral habits. 
Increased appreciation. 
Increased power of expression. ea Aan ee yo

  ocating immediate aims of teacher. If the teacher is con- 
ting a well-organized lesson, it ought not to be difficult for 
student observer to locate his immediate aims. Every device 
uses reflects some aim. There is no such thing as an aimless 
on in the sense that the teacher has no immediate objectives. 
wever, the lesson may be aimless in the sense that those 
ediate objectives are not in the direction of well-defined 
imate objectives. 
'wo criteria effective in determining immediate aims. The 
criteria most effective in determining the immediate aims 
the selection of devices and the technique of their use. To 
strate, one can tell something of the nature of the immediate 
of the workman by the tools or devices which he selects for 
day’s work. Further light may be shed upon his intentions 
observing the manner in which he employs these devices. If, 
example, he picks up a shovel rather than a spade, the on- 
ker may expect that he is going to fill a hole rather than dig. 
ywever, further observation will be necessary to determine 
th assurance his intentions. If he begins work by sinking 
: shovel straight into the ground, pressing on one side with 
: foot, we may conclude that the further evidence does not 
ystantiate our first hypothesis and that he really intends to 
-a hole. Likewise, one may postulate the intentions of the 
cher who sets forth with certain material and intellectual 
vices. The drawing down of maps or the request that the 
pils open their books is indicative of certain aims. Observing 
ether the teacher points out positions on the map or reads for 
» pupils while they watch their books, or whether some pupil 
selected to locate the desired place upon the map or to read 
: chosen selection, will aid still further in determining the
-P-A-G-E-204
  192 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
aim. As in the case of the workman one cannot determine t 
aim until the process is well under way, so in the case 
the teacher it is necessary to wait until results begin to appe 
before being certain of the immediate aim. 
After listing the immediate aims the observer is in a positi 
to locate the more remote goals toward which they are leadir 
If, in the case of the workman (to continue the analogy), \ 
find that he digs four holes twenty or thirty feet apart, arrang 
in rectangular form, we may conclude that he is going to bui 
either a garage or a poultry yard. The immediate aim of diggii 
the holes has been noted, but it alone will not in this case poi 
with definiteness to the ultimate purpose. In most cases t 
size and depth of the holes would be indicative of his furth 
intentions. Let us assume, however, that the owner builds on 
light and temporary buildings, and that he is in need of a gara 
and also of a poultry yard. We must wait until a further imm 
diate aim is discovered. We now observe that he cuts pos 
which when set protrude about four feet above the groun 
This immediate aim is more in keeping with a poultry ya 
than a garage, but it is not quite sufficient. We next obser 
that he brings forth a roll of finely woven wire. We are nc 
safe in stating that the ultimate goal is a poultry yard. 
Are immediate goals legitimate? The question of the legit 
macy of the immediate goals is an important one: it matters n 
with what skill they have been attained ; they are useless unle 
they lead to a desirable outcome. They are valuable to t 
extent to which they lead with precision to that outcome. T 
workman referred to above may waste his time by digging hol 
in the wrong place or by digging them too large or too dee 
So with the teacher. The time spent on memorizing somethi! 
that in no way affects the ends of education is time worse th 
wasted, for it gets the pupils nowhere and precludes possibiliti 
of attaining valuable goals. It is possible also that while t!

   mediate goals lead to a desirable end, they do so by a circui- 
s route, thus causing waste. For example, the ability to spell 
words needed in writing may be attained by the study of 
h words as have been found to have spelling value because 
y are used in writing, or by studying long lists of unselected 
rds. The goal attained is the same in both cases. The one 
0 accomplished the result through the roundabout course has 
ained no more in the direction of the goal than the one who 
k the direct course. The time spent in the blind alleys is 
t, for only progress toward the desired ultimate goal counts. 
mmediate goals are such as may be aimed at directly in any 
en lesson. That the student may more readily recognize the 
mediate goals of the lesson we will say that they are the 
s for which the teacher immediately strives. For example, 
spelling teacher may strive to develop in the class the ability 
spell a given list of words. This might be considered one 
he immediate aims of the lesson because it is a unit of accom- 
hment for which the teacher is directly striving and because 
leads to a more remote goal toward which the teacher may 
rk less directly, that is, social and civic efficiency.

The immediate goals in the mind of the teacher seem to hay 
been: 
1. To enable the pupils to recognize and read in context such ne 
words as were found in the story of “The Gingerbread Boy.” 
2. To create an interest in the story of “The Gingerbread Boy 
especially on the part of those who, through lack of books, cou! 
not participate in the reading. 
3. To develop the habit of observing form. 
4. To develop dexterity in codrdinating hand and eye in cuttin 
out such forms as were represented in the lesson. 
The type of lesson used was the conversational-development. 
The immediate goals were all directed upon legitimate remo! 
goals. 
The teacher’s methods were effective, as the immediate goals

im. To appreciate the selection and use of general material 
devices with a view to developing skill in the selection and 
use of them. 
Use of texts and reference materials. The most frequent 
eneral physical device employed is the book—textbooks and 
pference books. In order to use the book most effectively the 
sson must be carefully assigned each day. A certain amount 
f the teacher’s daily preparation should have this end in view. 
he part of the class period given over to the new assignment 
rill be our first consideration. Many teachers wait until the end 
f the hour is the proper time in which to make the next assign- 
nent. The teacher is’ then aware of the shortcomings in the 
resent lesson. Moreover, if the entire lesson has not been cov- 
ed in the class, the remaining part may be included in the new 
eat Inasmuch as many teachers fail to organize and 
arry out a lesson so as to leave ample time at the end of the 
eriod for making the new assignment, some have suggested 
hat it be made at the beginning of the period. This is making 
ne bad feature the pretext for another. It is just as easy for 
he teacher to save the proper time for the new assignment as it 
s to complete the lesson at the end of the period. The main 
onsideration in-deferring the assignment-is-that-the-pupils will 
ot have the background until the day’s lesson is over. Then, 
po, a. certain warming up and motivation that should take place 
uring the class period are advantageous in that, along with the 
ded background of understanding, they give a basis of in- 
203 
  f the hour and then in great haste assign to page so-and-so./ 
‘his is the least effective type of assignment. Logically thi dg 4

  204 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
terest in the new assignment. This interest is almost necessa 
if the pupils are properly to prepare the work for the followi: 
day. It is possible to assign the lesson for the following day 
reference to the coming lesson at various points throughout t 
period. This method is valuable but should be followed | 
a restatement and summary of the assignment at the end | 
the period. 
Clearness of assignment. The assignments “Take the ne 
five pages” and “Work the next ten problems” are definite on 
in the sense that they define the field of study, They are r 
definite in that they do not set up’ definite goals, give clear dire 
tions as to the way to attain those goals, or give criteria | 
eee the pupils can determine when a goal has been attaine 
Of course the age of the pupils will be a factor in determini 
the amount of detail into which it will be necessary to go 
meet these three requirements of a well-assigned lesson. T 
ultimate aims of education will demand also that more a 
more exercise of initiative and judgment be required of t 
pupils as their age and experience increase.’ Although the pu 
in an early grade should be told in detail just what to aim f 
how to attain the goal, and how to determine when he has ; 
tained it,so much explanation would be totally unnecessary wi 
the graduate student. The pupils must, however, have sho 
some ability to study before detailed supervision of this sort ¢ 
be lessened. This lessening cannot be done all at once, but mt 
come gradually as the pupils develop. We are told that ma 
German students who enter the university from the Gymnasiv 
lose a great deal because in the university they are thrown : 
most entirely upon their own ingenuity, whereas in the Gy 
nasium they were under the strictest supervision. This is 
course owing to a failure to achieve a desirable end of educati 
in the teaching process. We want to help the student to | 
effective studying, but at the same time we must keep in mii 
that it is also our duty to make him self-reliant and resourceft
-P-A-G-E-217
LESSON XXI 205 
  ecause of the lack of proper training which at present exists 
in most of our elementary schools, it is not safe to assume 
hat high-school pupils can be relied upon to study effectively 
nless fully definite and detailed assignments are made in both 
he text and the supplementary material. Bear in mind, how- 
ver, that the student is not adequately trained for future life 
until he will go to outside sources on his own initiative and 
erify and supplement the text or the discussion. This again 
means that the teacher must gradually lessen definite assign- 
ments and expect full preparation on the part of the pupils. 
he extent to which his expectations in this regard are met will 
ibe in general a function of the earlier training to which the 
upils have been subjected. The teacher may find it necessary 
to return to rigid assignments and gradually create abilities that 
will make for independence and self-reliance in the matter of 
tudy. This is one of the most important outcomes of education, 
and the teacher who can attain it and not lessen the efficiency of 
the class preparation is in this respect truly a master. 
Technique of turning over to pupils full responsibility for 
preparation of lessons. How to make the individual self- 
reliant is not so easily stated as the fact that he ought to be 
made self-reliant. There is plenty of room for experimenta- 
tion in this field. We can give here only a few general direc- 
tions. We have stated above that the process must be one of 
gradual growth. But this is only a general statement which 
would be equally applicable to all growth. Growth contains no 
gaps.\’The first specific direction with respect to this activity 
is that the student should gradually become responsible for the 
verification and elaboration of the text through locating and 
taking advantage of sources of information beyond those as- 
signed. Special credit should be given for this additional work. 
The writer suggests that A-grades be reserved for those who 
show this type of initiative. The class should be told that, 
although this additional work is not a guaranty of an A-grade,  
-P-A-G-E-218
206 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  no A-grade can be issued without it. This practice makes gra 
ing more than a mere device for stratification of the pupils; 
now becomes a teaching device as well. 
A second step in the process of developing initiative of atta 
on the part of the pupils will be to have them formulate the} 
study aims forthe coming lesson. It will tend to cause readi: 
with a purpose in mind, which is in itself a necessary and i 
portant step leading to the ultimate goals of education. Th 
stating of the aim should be accompanied by an advance coi 
sideration of the assignment with a view to evaluating the a 
vance topics. This will lead not only to reading with a purpo: 
in mind but to a critical evaluation of the material topic Db 
topic. This process might well go on simultaneously with th 
of attaining initiative in the collateral investigations. 
Another consideration is that of letting the pupils determi 
the amount of text which should be studied to meet proper! 
the aims of the coming lesson. This, of course, will deman 
developmental questioning on the patt of the teacher. He ma 
sometimes be forced to go contrary to the judgment of the clas: 
but the necessity for his doing so will probably grow less an 
less as this sort of training progresses. 
We see by the foregoing consideration of the problem tha 
the matter of lesson assignments is a very important one, for i 
offers an opportunity to advance toward some of the most im 
portant outcomes of education. It is truly a large part of th 
process of supervised study and will do much to eliminate one ¢ 
the severest criticisms launched against American educatior 
namely, that it results in intellectual docility. The teacher ma 
complain that fully to carry out such assignments would mea 
too much time taken from the discussion of the class work as h 
now knows it, but in doing so he is likely to be mistaking th 
chaff for the wheat. It is not the ground covered but the habit 
- of thinking and the skills accomplished that weigh heavily whe 
all has been said and done.
-P-A-G-E-219
  LESSON XXI 207 
Importance of making previous preparation function in 
citation. It is not enough to assign effectively lessons to be 
epared. The teacher must so conduct the class exercise that 
is preparation can be used by the student, and those who have 
t prepared will feel they have lost out. Otherwise even the 
st students will gradually give up the habit of serious prepa- 
tion. Check tests, such as are described in Lesson XVII, 
. 166-175, may be given once in a while in advance of dis- 
ssion to determine who has read the material. They should 
t be used to the exclusion of the essay tests, for they usually 
st only the facts gained and -not the ability to apply those 
cts in the thinking process. 
Lesson assignments should motivate pupils. The lesson as- 
gnment should be so made as to arouse on the part of the 
lupils an interest in the sources to be investigated. This is to 
le contrasted strongly with the former type of motivation, 
hich sprang from fear of the teacher. If, to use an illustration 
iven by Dr. Herbert H. Foster, in assigning a history lesson 
e say “What similarity do you see between the causes of the 
merican Revolution and the French Revolution ?” or in assign- 
g an English lesson, “See if you can determine the motive of 
‘ortia in demanding the ring from Antonio,” we have given a 
al motive for study. We have raised a problem to be solved 
y thoughtful reading. The pupils will attack such a lesson in 
way in which they will not attack one that has not ba’ \ 
roperly motivated. oh, 
Amount of assignment. The_length of the assignment feng des 
portant matter in developing the habit of preparation. If 
luch assignments are made as are impossible for the pupil to 
over in the time allotted, the teacher has forced an exception 
lo the regular preparation of the lesson and thereby has made 
less likely that the student will prepare properly when othe 
timuli compete with the lesson. Likewise, the e_difficulty, 
reparing’should not be beyond his ability to accomplis    
oi / 
   
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
as in the case of too long a lesson, too difficult a lesson is likel 
to interfere with the habit of lesson preparation. 
Selection of reference material. The reference materia 
assigned by the teacher should have been selected with. grea 
care. He should seldom trust his memory to the extent of mak 
ing assignments of collateral material without reading it him 
self. In this way he makes sure that it contains the ideas whic 
he thinks it contains. He has refreshed his mind and is no 
better able to determine what the student should get fro 
the selection: Reading the material before assigning it wil 
also aid him in meeting the danger of assigning too much o 
too little. : 
Use of dictionaries. The dictionary is a general device, fo 
if properly used it will have a place in all rooms in which stud: 
is going on. The pupils should be able to find the words. Th 
teacher should make sure that they are familiar enough wit 
the diacritical marks to discover readily the correct pronuncia: 
tion. They should also be aware of the fact that many usage 
of a word may be given (some of which may be obsolete), tha’ 
the meaning of a word often varies (depending upon the con 
nection in which it is used), etc. Along with a thorough famil- 
iarity with the use of the dictionary should go the dictionary 
habit, which will prevent pupils from attempting to guess from 
the context the meaning of a word. This habit results in the 
gathering of false ideas and also unfits the individual for the 
accurate reading that successful living requires. The student 
observer in making observations of the teaching should make 
special effort to determine whether or not the pupils have the 
knowledge, skills, and habits that will make them constant and 
efficient users of dictionaries. : 
Use of blackboards. The first consideration in the use of 
boards is that the material be placed, if possible, upon the part 
of the board from which all can see it easily. The material 
should be neatly arranged and should be written large. If the 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  
    
     
      
   
     
   
     
      LESSON XXI 209 
oom is improperly lighted, care will have to be taken that 
ross lighting does not obscure material which otherwise would 
e seen by all. The effective use of blackboard illustrations as 
lass discussion progresses is a valuable aid to teaching. Out- 
ines and summaries should be placed upon the board as they 
re worked out by the class. Conceptions attained through the 
yes as well as the ears are likely to be more lasting. Then, too, 
lhe use of boards has especial value in that the work of many 
an be observed at once. The student observer will do well to 
ote carefully the teacher’s technique with respect'to use of the 
lackboards. 
Use of mimeograph. Any considerable use of mimeographed 
aterial in the teaching process is questionable. In the first 
lace, outlines should be developed with the class and should 
ot be handed out fully prepared. Once they have been de- 
eloped, copying them from the board and later inserting 
hem in good form in notebooks is a further aid to fixing 
lhem firmly in the minds of the pupils. There will be many 
ccasions, however, such as rise in giving out laboratory 
irections and check tests, when the pupils’ time and energy 
ay be greatly saved with no educational loss by the use of 
imeographed sheets.

The following is a sample report of an observation accon 
panying Lesson XXI: 
      
1. The immediate aims of the lesson were: 
a. To develop ability in dealing with radicals. 
b. To review mathematical abilities previously developed. 
c. To develop interest in mathematical problems. 
2. The following material devices were used: 
a. Text, in which problems were assigned for work. 
b. The board, used considerably throughout the lesson. 
c. A book which the teacher had obtained from the library ar 
which contained interesting problems and solutions involving mar 
common fallacies. 
d. Paper and pencils, by pupils working at desks, while othe' 
’ were putting problems upon the board. 
The text seemed to me to be used effectively. The teacher fir 
called for problems that gave difficulty. When these were locate 
pupils who had solved them were asked to put them upon the boar} 
As soon as these problems were explained the teacher assigned t 
lesson for the following day. The assignment contained on! 
problems found in the text. The teacher made the assignment wi 
some care. She anticipated their difficulties and with the aid of t! 
pupils solved a few typical problems upon the board. The teach 
did the writing ; the pupils gave the steps and figures. 
All in all, the board was used very effectively. As was said b 
fore, the teacher had those problems that gave difficulty plac 
upon the board. They were placed upon the board in the rear 
the room rather than at the front. I asked her after class if the 
was any purpose in this, and she replied in the negative. I thoug} 
it would have been better to put them upon the front board. 
After the problems that gave difficulty had been explained, tl 
teacher assigned drill problems to be worked by the class as  
-P-A-G-E-223
  LESSON XXI 211 
1ole. While most of the class worked these drill exercises at their 
sks with paper and pencil, a few pupils were selected to work 
on the board. With each change of problems the group working 
the board took their seats, and others went to the board. The 
acher explained after class that this procedure broke the 
pnotony for the pupils.

1. The immediate aims of the lesson were: 
a. To give the pupils such concrete experiences as will enal 
them to develop rules for computing measurements dealing w 
the circle. 
b. To give practice in computing measurements dealing w 
the circle. 
2. The following material devices were used: 
a. Wire string. 
b. Several wooden cylinders. 
c. Paper and pencils. 
d. Textbook, in which problems were assigned for the followi 
day. 
The teacher measured the geometric forms while the pup 
observed her. She also drew the circles on the board. It mig 
have been better to have each child in the room supplied with 1 
wooden forms and to let the pupils do their own measuring. Th 
however, would have required considerable equipment and so: 
disturbance in the distribution. Miss XXX had the materials 
hand, and no time was lost in their use. 
After she had illustrated such relations as that of the circu 
ference to the diameter she called upon the pupils to work seve 
problems in which the circumference was given, to find the dian 
ter, and several in which the diameter was given, to find 1 
circumference. 
After the rules governing the measurements dealing with circ 
were fully comprehended, the teacher asked the pupils to open th 
books and check the first twelve problems for tomorrow’s assig 
ment. All in all, I should say the physical devices were w 
selected and used. I think it would have been advisable to ha

m. Along with the general physical devices will go a number 
special physical devices having special application to the 
ject at hand. We have already listed a few of these. It is 
y important that each specialist become acquainted with all 
known devices in his field and develop skill in the use of 
se which from reading or observation he expects to find 
uable. It will be our purpose here to note a few of the most 
eral, to examine their fitness for the tasks they are supposed 
ccomplish, and to describe the use of them. 
otebooks. The question might be raised, whether notebooks 
uld not have been listed and discussed under general rather 
n special physical devices. Perhaps present usage of them 
1d seem to justify the former caption ; but it is probable that 
use of notebooks is much overdone and that in many classes, 
h as history and mathematics, the time can more profitably 
spent in utilizing other channels of expression. 
e can lay down here only a few guiding principles. It would 
necessary to treat each subject separately in order to discuss 
question fully. Notebooks if rightly used have their great- 
value in arousing the pupils to activity. They offer some- 
Ing tangible in which the pupils can take pride, for they can

s greatest in the sciences, where factual knowledge plays a

  Notebooks are subject to the common danger of devices 
general: that which is only a device comes to be considered 
end in itself. Hence notebooks must be made for the direct e 
cational value that lies in preparing them and for the use wh 
they are to be to the student in later reviews. This means t 
to be of value they must be neatly written and arranged in 
orderly manner. With respect to uniformity, the paper 
covers of the notebooks of any given class should be unifo: 
' but any attempt to enforce uniformity rigidly, beyond limit 
the content, will tend to kill initiative and thus impair one 
the main outcomes which they were intended to produce. 
be of use, notebooks must be looked over frequently by 
teacher and graded carefully. To do otherwise will encour: 
the tendency to neglect them. 
As far as possible the outlines, drawings, etc. should be 
result of the pupil’s experience either in the classroom or in 
laboratory. To copy pictures and outlines from books has v 
little educational value. Systematic records and outlines 
reading done in literature may have some value in stimulati 
the pupil to increase the amount of his reading but may eas| 
become tedious and defeat the very aim of the study of literat 
itself. So with all other studies: the amount of notebook w 
required and the type of work done must be considered carefu 
with respect to its contribution to the ends of education. 
Use of maps. The value of maps as a special teaching dev: 
is confined very largely to geography, history, literature, al 
civics, and perhaps decreases in the order named. One of 
big outcomes of the study of geography is the ability to g' 
location to events as they come to mind. The soldier desti: 
for service overseas, who, after riding a day on the first lap 
the journey to a port of embarkation, wanted to know how 
they were from the German lines, represents the state of mii 
of those who have not been trained with respect to locati 
Imagine the utter chaos that must reign in the mind of the

  LESSON XXII 219 
idual who reads a daily paper, gathering news of events from 
parts of the world, with no location schemes in which to 
them. 
me of the first considerations in the use of maps as a means 
developing a location scheme is to present them so that the 
nsfer is made from the map forms and directions to those 
ich they represent on the earth’s surface. To do this the 
cher must constantly refer map directions to the real ones 
ich they represent by asking the pupils to point in the direc- 
n of England, Brazil, etc. Maps also give no idea of absolute 
le or distance. To get this the pupils must compare the long 
tances or large areas on the map with short or small ones on 
map and also with those with which they have experiences 
real life. 
ince parallels and meridians are given as curved lines, the 
tter of the location of one point with respect to another is 
en confusing. It is well to place beside such a map one in 
ich the parallels and meridians are shown as straight lines. 
e greatest danger in using the straight-line parallels and 
ridians is that they distort the apparent size of the areas in 
far north and south. This error should be corrected by 
ling the pupils’ attention to the fact and cause of the dis- 
tion, at the same time showing them the distance or area on 
urved-line map. Since distance and area are relative con- 
erations, it is desirable to devise other means of showing 
parison than the maps as now given. To draw Russia and 
Igium to scale, and then color Belgium and paste it at the 
tral point of the map representing Russia, is a very effec- 
e means of showing the relative sizes of the two countries. 
bles showing areas in terms of the same unit are often help- 
, especially as maps in the same book are often drawn on 
erent scales. 
(Detailed maps should be supplemented by outline maps on 
ich the positions are located as the lesson proceeds. The

special value in using this type of map is that it is free fr 
the maze of cities, villages, rivers, mountains, etc. and allows :

Then, too, the very act of marking and naming the locat: 
serves to fix it in mind. Outline maps of this kind, on wh 
chalk and eraser can be used as on a blackboard, may 
obtained for class exercises. For the needs of the study peri 
outline maps which fit into the students’ notebooks have spec 
value. It is very desirable to have pupils place free-hand o 
lines on the board. In the geography class itself much of t 
work should be done. The pupils should be able to ske 
roughly, in less than one minute, the outline of any continent 
One of the values that come from the making of maps by 
pupil is that this training prepares him later to read maps m 
effectively. Many teachers assume this ability when very li 
of it is present. If the pupil is able to read maps in the se] 
that he can interpret the conventional features of them, he m 
not at the same time associate these forms with the reali 
which they are supposed to represent. This ability can be 
veloped by making maps of local regions or by studying lo 
maps and noting the actual topography, cities, lakes, rivers, 
The use of relief maps aids somewhat in suggesting 
reality behind the physical features represented by maps.

However, as it is more expensive and somewhat unwieldy, 
relief map should not take the place of flat maps. It is desiral 
that there be a set of relief maps for the building, so that acc 
may be had to them from time to time. However, they sho 
not be purchased until the rooms are thoroughly supplied w' 
flat maps. 
Use of charts and models. There are many advantages to 
gained through the use of charts and models. In them 
pupils can see the relationship of parts, especially in studyij 
the biological sciences, to learn which by the study of str  
-P-A-G-E-233
LESSON XXII 221 
  ral and functional relations directly would require much more 
me, greater effort, and a technique far beyond the general stu- 
nt. A model of the brain, for example, if properly studied, gives 
very good idea of the actual brain. Pupils can take it apart 
id see clearly the main features with none of the unpleasant- 
ss of cutting into a brain. Not only this, but unless dissecting 
done by an expert, the parts are likely to be so mutilated that 
clear idea of the structure is impossible. One of the dangers 
the use of charts and models is that the size of the whole or 
a part will be distorted. This difficulty can be met by the 
acher’s calling attention to distortions of this kind. The 
ory is told of a student who received the impression that 
e brain was hollow, because the model that he studied showed 
s surface only. Hence it is important that the teacher in using 
arts and models should not take it for granted that the pupils 
ill gather by themselves the correct idea of the real thing. 
ather he should use the chart or model simply as one of vari- 
s devices valuable in giving the pupils the concept desired. 
Use of pointers. Rubber-tipped pointers should be provided 
each room for use in calling the attention of the class to 
aps, charts, models, blackboard work, etc. The advantages of 
is device are many. In the first place, putting the finger upon 
aps, charts, and models soils them, in time making them al- 
ost unreadable. Then, too, maps and charts are often hung 
0 high on the wall to be reached by the small pupils and some- 
mes even by the teacher. The use of the pointer also enables 
e person pointing to stand at one side of the material while 
plaining it. The writer has seen cases where high-school 
upils who were explaining algebra work at the board found it 
ecessary to stand directly in front of the work in order to point 
ut the individual terms. Of course, a yardstick may be used, 
ut the pointing end is blunt and the stick itself is wide and flat, 
that in use with charts and maps it frequently covers part of 
e material to be shown.

222 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  Special physical devices used in mathematics. Straightedg 
compasses, and graph paper round out the special physical dj 
vices most needed for teaching higher mathematics. It is ve 
desirable that good drawings accompany the statement of t! 
problem to be solved. The imperfectly drawn figure does mu 
to confuse the student in his thinking. Whereas with a go 
drawing he might solve the proposition, he fails with a le 
accurate figure. The concrete background furnished by dra 
ings seems necessary to the effective thinking of certain visual 
minded pupils. It seems to furnish the outline into which ide 
are to fit, the clearness of the outline being a function of t 
clearness of the thinking. A story is told of a teacher who, bi 
lieving that the purpose of geometry was to develop the pow 
to think entirely in the abstract, used no drawings at all b 
required the pupils to prove propositions from verbal descrij 
tions of them. This was only carrying to its logical conclusi 
the idea that the quality of the drawings used in solving math 
matical problems is of little consequence. 
More graphing should be done in our classrooms than i is do 
now, with a view to making the pupils proficient in readi 
graphs. One may say that the graphing of equations in algeb 
is a roundabout method of attaining this aim; yet there is litt 
doubt that this training is very valuable as a basis for unde 
standing the significance of the graph when it is met later ij 
economics or a trade journal. That is, fully to comprehend t 
material when put out in graph form, one must have a gener 
notion of the meaning of an origin and an x and y axis. It 
a mistake to assume, however, that because a student can us 
the graph in a mathematics classroom he will be able effectivel: 
and without further teaching to read graphs as applied i 
statistics. The extent to which graphs are used nowadays i 
everyday life makes this matter a very important one. 
Since the graph is valuable only if accurate, it should b 
made upon paper specially prepared. To facilitate matters, th
-P-A-G-E-235
  LESSON XXII 223 
acher should have a supply of graph paper on hand to pass 
lut to students who are not supplied. The teacher should 
lbserve the conditions of the straightedges and also note 
hether or not the pencils are long and well-sharpened. The 
encil used in drawing graphs should be at least of medium 
ardness and long enough to project above the hand while in 
se. Although the equipment used in pure geometry is usually 
mited to straightedge and compass, protractors might well be 
dded to the list, for use in preparing drawings to represent 
tuations given in algebra and physics problems. The draw- 
g dnd graph paper used in courses in which notebooks are 
ept should be of such size that it can be readily transferred 
lo the notebook.

The drill lesson which I observed today was well taught. T 
content consisted of the multiplication tables, including 
“sevens,” “eights,” and “nines.” The teacher gave the stimul 
to the class as a whole and immediately afterwards called upon 
member of the class to respond. Failure on the part of this pu 
to respond at once was followed by the raising of the hands 
those who thought they knew the answer. The teacher did ni 
wait for the lagging pupil or for one who gave the wrong respon’ 
but quickly called upon another. I believe this was good practi 
for it did not allow the pupil time to obtain the answer by a roun 
about way. The immediate association of the correct response wi 
the given multiplication stimulus was the desired outcome, and 
believe the teacher’s method was well suited to obtaining it. 
The exercise lasted about ten minutes. I asked the teacher aft 
the class as to the proper length of the drill period in such 
exercise. She replied, “While I usually allow about ten minut 
for a drill exercise in arithmetic, one cannot set any given leng 
of time as desirable. The teacher should watch the class for sig) 
of loss of interest and stop at that point.” 
The exercise was carried out in a lively manner. It seemed 
me that everybody was thinking all the time. The teacher so sc: 
tered the questions that no pupil could form any idea as to j 
when he was to be called upon.

The aim of the lesson which I observed today was to develop <

In my search for reasons for this impression on my part I conclud 
that it could be traced to the fact that the teacher hardly chang 
her position during the lesson. Her facial expression changed b 
little, and her voice was scarcely inflected. Two reports were giv 
by the pupils, and they did much to add to the interest of t! 
group. Aside from the fact that the teacher seemed to lack tl 
necessary enthusiasm, the lesson was in all respects effective 
conducted. Attention was called to Greek forms of architectu| 
in the neighboring community. This brought forth fresh inter 
in the subject. I believe the lesson would have been improved hi 
the teacher used pictures more freely to bring out the contrasts

PART III 
INTRODUCTION 
  n the study of Part III the student will learn something of 
nature and purpose of practice teaching with a view to 
eloping the proper attitude toward the work. Many student 
chers fail at first because they do not appreciate the serious 
ure of the task. They do not accept full responsibility from 
start, but instead, as in college classes, take matters lightly, 
sting to the teacher in charge to see that everything ends 
ll. This attitude is fatal to the student teacher. He is not 
dealing with inert material as in other laboratories, but 
tead with boys and girls who will test his power from the 
inning. The problem is his; and although a supervisor may 
ke suggestions or, if necessary, take over the class, there is 
hing a supervisor can do while the student teacher is actually 
charge. Hence he must come fully prepared, ready for any 
ergency. There is no dry-land swimming in practice teaching. 
everal lesson plans are included in Part III. They are of 
ious types and deal with different subjects. The student 
cher must select the type which seems best suited to the 
k, and bégin to prepare a plan for the first lesson at least one 
ek before he begins teaching. While he is preparing the les- 
plans he should be studying carefully Lessons XXIX to 
XII inclusive. Frequent conferences with the supervisor at

It is not uncommon for the supervisor to find a student 
looks upon the hours of teaching and observation as some f| 
mal requirement that must be met as part of the prescri 
course. Such a student has a wholly wrong attitude and 
likely to meet with serious difficulties in acquiring the techni 
of teaching. Only a total lack of moral sense can account fo 
student teacher’s appearing before a class of pupils with t 
timeserving attitude. Such an attitude in the student’s acade 
classes means loss largely to the student, but in the pract 
school it entails loss for pupils who by age and position are 
able to defend themselves. Each minute lost in a classroom| 
thirty pupils means a half-hour of lost time. The stud 
teacher who is inclined to take practice teaching lightly sho 
consider this. Nothing less than his greatest effort can be 
ceptable to those in charge of the training school, who have 
their first consideration the well-being of the pupils. 
Proper attitude of student teacher one of eagerness to t: 
full advantage of his opportunity. The student teacher sho 
not look upon practice teaching as a burden or a requirem 
but rather as a privilege. Once out in the profession the op’ 
tunities for receiving constructive help are, in most systems,

few. The teacher must struggle on with only his experience 
a student instructor to serve as a guide and a basis for self- 
provement. As a student teacher he is with those who are 
ious to see him improve. His improvement is a codperative 
lertaking upon which both his success and that of the super- 
or depend. Here is an opportunity for codperation in a task 
ich cannot be but interesting and profitable for both if the 
per attitude can be maintained by the practice teacher. 
mprovement in teaching has no limit. One of the most in- 
esting features of the teacher’s work is that there is no limit 
the improvement which it is possible to make. So complex 
he process of classroom teaching that perfection may be more 
rly attained in almost any other field. This fact adds zest 
the work of one whose training has developed ideals of teach- 
and criteria for recognizing one’s own improvement. Hence 
teacher does not leave the training school a finished prod- 
but, like the newly graduated surgeon, must expect to im- 
ve with experience. He can teach, however, and in this 
pect he is far above the position of the untrained beginner. 
his attitude has been right he has also developed ideals that 
ll carry him far on the road to perfection and offer him a 
er-ending source of pleasure. 
ost students can become good teachers. The old saying 
t teachers are born and not made has just enough truth in 
ito make it dangerous. It would be just as true to say that 
thematicians are born and not made. Certain innate abilities, 
course, must be present in either case; but, granting these, 
ining as a second factor must be combined with the former 
produce the finished product. The good teacher is not the 
e who is born with a teaching instinct. More likely he has 
en the product of years of effort. As there is no royal road to 
nowledge of geometry, so there is no royal road to the ability 
teach. The student must be content with the fact that there 
a road and have the patience and faith to follow it.

234 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  Formal period of teacher training necessary to meet requi| 
ments of modern schools. As civilization becomes more 
more complex, the task of utilizing the vast social inherita 
in the process of preparing individuals to meet the needs 
modern life becomes greater and greater. This fact alone wo 
indicate an increasing need of more thorough preparation 
the part of those who are to enter the profession of teachi 
Add to this, however, the fact that the home is taking less 
less part in the process of fitting the child for life, and it 
readily be seen that the training required of one preparing 
teach must expand considerably. Not only is it now necess: 
that the teacher know the subject matter; it is also necess: 
that he have a philosophy of education, a knowledge of the 1. 
governing mental development, and a developed technique 
the process of teaching. That this training is producing teach 
who can teach more effectively than the untrained teacher 
the past there is good evidence. In a study conducted 
Superintendent Spaulding at Newton, Massachusetts, a f 
years ago, he repeated an examination in a few fundamen 
subjects given to children of the same grade about forty ye 
previously. The tests revealed that although children to 
study a much richer curriculum they do better in the fun 
mentals than did the pupils of the earlier day. Of course, 
may say that part of this improvement in classroom instructi 
is owing to better texts, better-equipped classrooms, and lon: 
terms of school ; but it is very probable that much of it is owi 
to improved teaching methods. The best teachers today 
highly skilled, and even the average teacher is able to te: 
much more effectively than did the teachers in the past. | 
Development of technique important factor in preparati 
to teach. There is a saying to the effect that we learn to | 
by doing, which has a deal of meaning for those who are abo 
to end the period of their general training by teaching und 
highly supervised conditions. All the previously studied theo

ounts to nothing if it does not culminate in effective tech- 
ue in the classroom, and this culmination is brought about 
ly through the process of actual teaching. With all our theory, 
importance of which we would in no wise minimize here, 
le learns to teach by teaching. In saying that one learns to 
ch by teaching, however, we do not mean to give the idea 
t all teaching leads to improvement. The extent to which 
dent teaching may lead to improvement will depend upon 
theoretical background with which one goes into the class- 
m, the desire to improve, and the method of attacking the 
blem of teaching. For various reasons, years of experience 
not always improve the teaching process. The most com- 
m reason for this is that the teacher has no standard for 
ging his own teaching. He is not always aware of his own 
lortcomings, and, even if he were, he would have no idea of 
w to go about the task of improving himself. During the 
riod of student teaching the prospective teacher further de- 
llops his ideals of classroom instruction, learns to evaluate his 
locedure, and reduces his technique to the level of habit. 
Great care needed in reducing technique to habit, making 
e of desirable forms of procedure. As the beginning student 
the violin may acquire improper ways of holding the instru- 
ent or the bow, so the beginning teacher may develop bad 
rms of questioning, disciplining, etc. Hence it is important 
lat the teacher use the proper procedure from the very start. 
hough his procedure be stiff and formal at first, the form must 
correct. To this end he must make detailed lesson plans, have 
lem approved by the supervisor, and follow them carefully. 
Meaning of formalism in beginning stages of student teach- 
. As we noted above, the early stage of student teaching 
a of necessity be dominated by a well-formulated proce- 
ire. At this point the student’s attention must be concentrated 
rgely upon technique. He must study the fitness and order 
his questions, the manner and rate of asking them, and their

  236 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
effectiveness as judged by the response of the pupils. He 
becoming acquainted with the tools and their use. Hence mu 
of his attention must now be directed upon himself. His po 
tion in the early stage of student teaching is much like that 
the baseball player who is being trained to bat. The player 
told what should be his approximate distance from the pla 
what angle each foot should take with respect to the side of t 
plate, what should be the position of his body at various stag 
in the process of hitting, how he should grasp the bat, etc. It 
easy to see how much of his attention at this stage of his tra 
ing is directed away from the actual hitting of the ball and up 
the manner of hitting it. In time, however, this manner | 
comes habitual. Grace of movement follows, and more a 
more of his attention can be directed upon hitting the ball. 
So with the student teacher. He must go through the stage 
formalism in his training if he is ultimately to attain compl 
mastery of the art. Technique must in time be reduced to hak 
so that the teacher can give little thought to the art of questic 
ing and attend to the pupils themselves. Not until this stz 
has been reached is the student a real teacher. Professor H. ’ 
Nutt writes as follows on the meaning of the formal period: 
A final most vital point that should be noted is that it is not the f 
that one is studying his teaching performance in a training school uni 
the direction of an expert supervisor, or the fact that he is studying 
teaching performance in a public school without the help of any o 
that makes his training formal or otherwise, but it is the fact that « 
turns his whole attention to the study of the tools of teaching and mak 
for the time being, their essential characteristics his whole concern. T 
taking time off from the job of teaching, in either case, in order to mas 
the tools with which to do the job most efficiently is formal study « 
formal training. In each case the teacher studies the tools for their o 
sakes, and tries them out until he discovers how they work and why tl 
work, then practice soon puts them in the realm of habit and the teacl 
is freed from the formalism of his training.*

   Analogy between training of teacher and baseball player 
perfect. Like most analogies the one given above is good at 
ly a few points. The main discrepancy in this case comes 
m the fact that the baseball player is trained to bat pre- 
ously to the opening of the ball-playing season, whereas the 
acher must get his training during the heat of real action. He 
ust teach while learning to teach. Hence he must expect close 
d exacting supervision. He must be willing to conform to the 
ggestions of those responsible for the welfare of the pupils. 
e must take care that his plans are submitted and approved

curred by the pupils may be reduced to a minimum. 
Carefully prepared plans make good teaching possible from 
e beginning. The welfare of the pupils demands that the 
udent teachers begin teaching with plans that have been 
orked out in full detail. This method will make it possible 
r the average student teacher to teach successfully from the 
eginning. This is necessary, for even in a private training 
hool our first duty is toward the pupils. No sacrifice on their 
art should ever be expected. The beginning teacher must, as 
ar as possible, make up for his lack of experience by preparing 
etailed plans and following carefully the suggestions of his 
upervisor. Each lesson taught, even the first, must be a good 
2sson, for after all the training school is a school, and children 
a it are being fitted for life’s activities.

Aim. To develop an appreciative understanding of the natui

Desirability of preparing lesson plans. There is no questi 
about the desirability of making plans before attempting 
teach a lesson. »All projects, whether they be the leading of 
army in battle or the building of a house, require that the mail 
points of procedure be clearly outlined in advance of the actu 
activity. To do otherwise would be ruinous to the general 
the contractor. The building of a house does not proceed frot 
moment to moment according to the whims of the builder, bu 
instead the plans are fully laid in advance. The teacher lik 
wise, in preparing to teach a lesson, is getting ready for a prc 
longed and highly complicated activity. The strategy for 
successful attack on the lesson may require forethought equ: 
to that of the general. There is almost no limit to the care an 
shrewdness with which the teacher’s plans may be laid. On th 
other hand, he may make no plans at all, but his chances of reé 
success under such conditions are no greater than those «

d methods, the fact that he has planned what to do in advance will 
Ip him to change details intelligently. Further, certain main objec- 
es must be realized if he is to win the engagement at all. It is equally 
e that while no teacher can foresee all the questions that he should 
Ik in advance of the actual lesson, the teacher who goes into the class 
ithout a very definite idea of what his most important questions are to 
and how they should be framed, is not likely to formulate them well 
the spur of the moment. 
  Degree of detail in plans depends upon experience. It is 
ghly desirable, if not indispensable, that the beginner prepare 
s plans in the minutest detail; but he soon must learn to 
breviate more and more, until a few sentences jotted down 
haste serve as a plan from which a masterly lesson may be 
ught. ‘Time does not permit the classroom teacher to make 
tailed plans in every subject. His classes are too many, and 
her duties crowd in to occupy his time. The abbreviated plan 
ust serve the purpose of a more detailed one. It must stand 
r bold type in the foreground which, when in use, fades 
adually away, leaving the details of procedure to be read, 
uch as the type thrown upon the screen at the photoplay gives 
ay to that which seems to emerge from beneath it. Such plans, 
wever, are not likely to be made by one who has not at some

questions must be carefully prepared in advance, and his plan 
carried out to the letter. | However, as he develops skill an 
poise in presenting the subject matter he will be able to deviat 
slightly from the plans and yet attain the objectives of th 
lesson. Then the plans may become more and more abbreviate 
until they are reduced to a size suitable to the needs of a regula

im. To become able to orient a lesson in terms of remote and 
immediate aims. 
  The importance of a remote aim is clear to all who give the 
estion thought. The teacher who does not know what he is 
riving to accomplish day by day may be likened to the lost 
odsman who merely walks and walks. If by any chance one 
ur’s journey leads in the same direction as that which was 
ken during the preceding hour, the wanderer still has no as- 
rance that his direction of travel is not directly opposite to 
at in which the desired haven lies. On the contrary, the 
acher who is aware of the educational outcomes or the remote 
ms for which he is striving may be likened to the woodsman 
ho is guided in his travel by sun, moon, stars, or compass. 
ach step brings him nearer his objective. His step is lighter 
id quicker because he is spurred on by the thought that he is 
ying somewhere and that each step brings him nearer his goal. 
Knowledge of ultimate goals demands a philosophy of educa- 
on. If the teacher is to direct the development of those in his 
1arge he must first have answered in his own mind such ques- 
ons as Why does society set up such an institution as the 
hool? What is the purpose of education in a democracy? 
Then is an individual educated? What truly educational ex- 
riences are offered by the subjects I intend to teach? To 
hat’ extent should allowance be made for individual differ- 
ices? To be able to answer intelligently such questions as 
ese gives point to the daily lessons while they are being 
ught. The teacher who has ultimate goals in mind has criteria

Professor Stephen S. Colvin?: 
It may be objected that in a practical course philosophical consider 
tions have no place. And to this I would agree if such questions we 
merely philosophical—that is, if they issued in no practical co 
sequences. It is, however, of the utmost importance that the teach 
should have a broad and generous conception of his calling; that | 
should comprehend the relation of things; that he should have lar; 
objectives that extend his vision beyond the immediate work that he 
doing, that give him an insight into its significance, and a means | 
evaluating its details in terms of something more comprehensive at 
important. This broad point of view is particularly necessary for tl 
prospective high-school teacher, who often is content to teach his su 
ject merely as a “‘subject,” and whose greatest single fault is the “hea 
ing of lessons” ; who all too frequently does not know where he is goin 
but simply that he is “on his way.” For'the elementary teacher, th 
broader outlook may not be as essential. Instructors in the lower grad 
are held down to very definite courses of study, to be taught accordi1 
to carefully prescribed methods with definitely stated and measurab 
results. The high-school teacher, however, has large autonomy in mal 
instances, and unless he has a stock of “free ideas” to aid him, his air 
in teaching, as well as his methods, are likely to be largely of the triz 
and-error variety. 
Teacher without ultimate aim becomes interested in subje 
matter rather than in pupil’s development. The teacher wh 
owing to lack of a philosophy of education, is not strivir 
toward goals formulated in terms of pupils’ development, sox 
becomes a teacher of subjects rather than a developer of pupil

In this manner there is developed a hierarchy of outcomes ¢

us suppose that we are preparing a history lesson dealing w 
the organization of the new government after the Americ 
Revolution. Our immediate aim in the lesson may be to bri 
about an understanding on the part of the class of the relat 
between the newly created departments of government and t 
needs of the people. The attainment of this understanding v 
necessitate the discussion of many subtopics, such as the ba 
of state representation, the relation of executive, legislative, a 
judicial branches to each other, or the means of appointing 
electing to office. The discussion of each topic is a small unit 
teacher and pupil activity having an aim of its own leading 
the immediate aim of the lesson. We can describe such a less 
diagrammatically by letting a V-shaped symbol, as >, represé 
such a unitary teacher-pupil activity as the need of investi 
the three functions of government in three distinct offic 
bodies. The number of these unitary activities and their re

rectly upon the ultimate outcome of the course. In the same 
anner several courses may lead to one of the more remote 
als of education, say civic and social efficiency. This goal,

Thus we see that there is a hierarchy of aims involved 
teaching. They are related to one another, and if our cour 
and lessons are well planned they lead to some encompassi 
aim; for example, call it complete living. The remote ai 
that we have listed in the earlier part of this book under the 
rious subjects are very remote but not ultimate. They are s 
sidiary to higher aims. However, they are ultimate enough

   ing the method of attack, the immediate aim must represent 
oal and not an outlined statement of the assignment. An aim 
seless unless it serves to focus the activities of the class 
iod toward something. The teacher of history, for example, 
lo in preparing to teach a lesson on the organization of the 
ernment after the American Revolution should state as his 
ediate aim, “To discuss the coming into being of the various 
artments of government,” is merely making a summarized 
tement of the nature of the lesson. Just to discuss or explain 
never be an end. Even the most immediate aim must rep- 
ent some change in the pupils. The lesson must cause them 
appreciate something, must give added information, and 
st build up new attitudes or change old ones. 
mmediate aim must lead in direction of remote aim. It isa 
mon fault of student teachers that their immediate aims 
not lead in the direction of the stated remote aim. If, 
example, the remote aim given for a spelling lesson is to 
ive the pupils spell such words as are commonly used in writ- 
and the immediate aim is to have the pupils master the 
lling of five words, among them the word “gyneolatry,” we 
lve an example of an immediate aim that is not in line with 
remote aim. Again, the teacher who in preparing a lesson 
elementary arithmetic. gives as the remote aim the ability 
solve such mathematical problems as arise in everyday life 
d gives as the immediate aim the mastery of the method of 
tracting cube root is attempting to go north by going east. 
e student should assure himself in each lesson that the im- 
diate aim leads not only to a worthy remote aim but to the 
e stated at the beginning of the lesson plan. 
Methods and aims must not be confused. The teacher who 
ys ““My immediate aim of today is to have the pupils go to 
le board and put on the first ten problems, etc.” is confusing

  question will probably be at least part of his immediate a: 
As we said above, his aim always terminates with the py 
never with a method of bringing the material before the pu 
Teacher must limit his aims to that which he can accompl. 
in lesson. It must ever be remembered that to attempt 
many things in a lesson results in doing nothing well. The 
adage, “All that you do, do with your might; things done 
halves are never done right,” was never truer than when appl. 
to teaching. If we are trying to effect changes in our pu 
and are not merely teaching books and courses, we can seld 
afford to brush lightly over many things. It is much better 
drive home a few fundamentals than to give a smattering 
poorly organized details. The details fall easily into line if t 
fundamental elements are comprehended. 
Remote and external goals in mind of teacher and immedi: 
interests and goals of pupils should not conflict. As we ha 
said before, the teacher must never lose sight of the rem 
goals in the process of directing pupil activity. This, howev: 
does not imply that he is to force upon children the aims whi 
are external to them; that is, aims which do not grow out 
their social lives. The teacher must rather enter into t 
activities at the level of the pupils, skillfully setting such sit 
tions as will direct their experience toward goals which are 
sirable. We learn to live by living, but not by living in a 
way. It is in that subtle and skillful directing which, on t! 
one hand, does not destroy the naturalness of the chil 
activity while, on the other hand, it successfully guides ai 
directs this activity that the secret of good teaching lies. T! 
obtaining of such a condition is, however, a task for a maste 
in which the novice need not expect to succeed fully with an 
thing less than years of effort.

LESSON XXIX 
Aim. To learn to make satisfactory plans for the first 
lessons. 
  Selection of unit of material to be taught, first step in mak: 
lesson plan. The student will begin the task of preparing 
lesson plan by selecting a unit of subject matter suitable t 
class period of instruction. Since lessons should be assig! 
as far as possible by topics rather than by pages, the mate 
selected will be organized round some central’thought or ac 
ity. The amount of text material will be determined (1) by 
text treatment of the topic selected, (2) by the length of ti 
to be given to the recitation, and (3) by the degree of difficu 
offered by the subject. The student teacher should consult 1 
supervisor upon this point. 
Formulation of educational goals which unit of material 
suited to promote, second step in making lesson plan. Havi 
selected the unit of material, the student teacher ‘wilt consi 
next the reasons for giving the pupils the experiences contair 
in the subject matter. (First he will consider the major o 
comes of education to which this material may be expected 
lead. Is it economic, social, or cultural efficiency? Let us st 
pose that it is to lead to economic and social efficiency. Ea 
of these very encompassing outcomes contains many goals j 
below it in rank. For example, social efficiency is made up 
many specific adjustments, such as the ability to get the peint 
view of others, ability properly to evaluate one’s. personal soc 
experiences, due regard for the rights of others in all perso 
contacts and relationships, a proper sense of one’s social obli 
tions, and the ability to recognize the proper relationships

le group to another. Once the student determines the remote 
tcomes in terms of attitudes or abilities for which the unit of 
terial is most suited to prepare, he is in a position to formu- 
e the immediate goals which are possible and which are 
ected toward the given remote goals. 
etermining and listing devices to be used, third step in pre- 
ring lesson plan. After the student teacher has determined 
unit of instructional material and the outcomes both im- 
diate and remote for which he is to strive, he is in a position 
consider the devices most suitable to his lesson project.( The 
vices used will depend, of course, upon the content Si 
son and the nature of the outcomes to be striven for? In 
mulating the intellectual devices it is clear that the device of 
turing might be justified at one point and the use of develop- 
ntal questioning at another. The teacher while looking 
rough the material to be presented to the class should deter- 
ine the intellectual devices that he intends to use. He will 
termine also the material devices which he will need. These 
ould be listed, as then it is necessary only,to look over the list 
fore class to determine whether or not the needed materials 
e present. The supervisor also is in a position to suggest any 
sirable change in the physical equipment (see Lesson Plan, 
). 272-273). 
Relating new lesson to old, fourth step in making lesson plan. 
aving selected a suitable unit of material, determined the out- 
mes to be striven for, and listed the devices to be used, the 
udent teacher is now in a position to outline his attack upon 
ie lesson. This outline should be placed under somé such 
tion as “Description of Plan of Attack upon Lesson.” The 
rst part of this outline will come under the subcaption ‘“‘Sum- 
ary of Previous Lesson” or better perhaps “Relating Previous 
esson to Lesson of Today” (see Forms A and B, pp. 259-275). 
1 the first plans, the student teacher should state in detail what 
to be done (see pages 259-277). The method should be quite

fully expressed or implied in the description. It is not eno 
to say “Bring out such and such facts by questioning.” 
questions should be listed, fully written out. There are, 
course, various ways of summing up the previous lesson. 
some instances it may be done by the teacher’s-using the lect! 
form. At other times a series of well-directed questions bri 
ing out and summing,up the work of the previous lesson is m 
desirable. Much depends upon the time at the teacher’s d 
posal and the stage of the daily lesson in the project under w: 
It takes more time to sum up a lesson by questioning than 
lecturing, but it is generally more profitable to the pupils. 
student teacher will nofe on pages 259 and 273 the two meth 
of summing up the previous lesson. It is not enough, however, 
sum up the lesson of the previous day ; yesterday’s lesson shou 
be made to serve.as an introduction to today’s, to put the pup 
in readiness to think about and understand that which is co! 
ing (see Lesson Plan, pp. 265-266). 
Describing attack upon body of lesson, fifth step in prepari: 
lesson plan. The fifth step in preparing the lesson plan w 
come under the caption “Attack upon Body of Lesson” (see le 
son plans on pages 259-281). The form of the work at this pe 
of the plan will not differ from that under the subcaption “R 
lating New Lesson to Old.” It is while laying plans for this pz 
of the lesson that the student teacher must keep immediate ai 
remote aims constantly before him, for, as we noted in an earl 
part of this text, outcomes are the result of method as well 
of content; that is, methods employed to obtain one outcor 
will not serve in getting another. The plan of attack upon t 
lesson body should provide-for-a-summary. Jt may be ve 
short, in some instances merely an enumeration of the poir 
made. This summing up is well provided for on page 260. 
The assignment, sixth step in preparing lesson plan. Certa 
aims should govern the assigning of the lesson if it is to be | 
effective guide to the pupils in the preparation of the work 1

LESSON XXIX 253      
     
    
       
    
    
  e following day (see Form A, p. 269). The student should list 
ese aims after the caption “Assignment of Lesson” and then 
guided by them in working out the plan of assignment. 
Ithough the assignment of the lesson is one of the most im- 
rtant functions of the teacher, good assignments are seldom 
ade. The writer believes that the following of aims in making 
sson assignments will do much to improve the assignments 
d to form habits of care at this important point in the daily 
sson (see Form A, p. 260, for a well worked-out plan of 
signment). 
Submitting plan to supervisor, seventh step in preparing les- 
n plan. After the plan has been completed in preliminary 
rm, it should be submitted to the supervisor for criticism. At 
is discretion it should either be left for reading and comment 
1 be discussed in person with the teacher. The latter practice 
much preferable if time permits. The plans should be in the 
ands of the supervisor at least three or four days before the 
sson is to be taught, to allow ample time for any changes 
hich may be required. 
Separation of method and content. Up to this point we have 
een dealing with the steps in content organization. Lesson 
lans may follow this order and yet differ widely in form, de- 
ending upon the extent to which method and content are sepa- 
ated. Writers in the field of supervision differ upon this point. 
ome are inclined to the view that such a separation is an 
rtificiality and does not exist in the process of teaching ; hence 
he two should not be separated in making the lesson plan (see 
Lesson Plan, Form A). Others say that to separate method and 
content causes the teacher to attend to each by itself, thus avoid- 
ng the possibility of attention to one factor at the expense of 
the other. It requires a little more time and effort to separate 
method and content, but if such a plan (see Lesson Plan, 
Form B) is more useful we may nevertheless consider it. It is 
possible further to divide method by breaking it up into method 
     
-P-A-G-E-266
  254 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
and procedure. This plan has the added advantage of prepari: 
the teacher for the procedure by naming the procedure befoi 
\, meeting it clothed with content matter. For example, the wo 
“quiz” prepares the teacher for a question, or the word “de 
tration” for the task of demonstrating. These words stan 
ing bY themselves may be noted readily and serve to give t 
teacher the proper set (see lesson plan, Form C). 
Attention to form necessary in developing skill. The acco 
plished violinist may attend only to the notes or the theme, b 
the beginner, if he is to develop effective technique, must atte 
to his manner of holding the violin arid the bow. ‘Method, 
form, needs his special attention at this point, and devices th 
will sufficiently direct his attentien to his-method are justifie 
Of course, in the teaching process-there must be a content 
well. The outcome is important frem the beginning. On t 
other hand, as we said above, correct methods, or forms, mu: 
be established from the first if effective: technique is to be d 
veloped. For this reason, of the three lesson forms suggeste 
there is much to be said in favor of Form C for student teache: 
who are just beginning. > 
Arrangement of subject matter. The arrangement of the sub 
ject matter is equally impertant in every form which the teache 
may follow. In the first place, if subject matter is separate: 
from procedure, the material should be organized under topi 
headings, making units of a size convenient for treatment. Th 
topic headings of text material will often furnish such topics 
Care must be taken that the topics represent units of though 
and that such units are a vital part of the larger unit which i

process by studying the lesson plans that follow this discussion 
On the other hand, the arrangement of the topics is equall; 
important. In just what order should the units be presented 
If the lesson plan is based upon a lesson in some text, it wil 
often serve to follow the order of topics given there. However

     e teacher must be ever critical of the order of arrangement. 
xts are often written with the subject rather than the learner 
mind. The topics should be presented in such an order as to 
nform to the general principles of learning. 
Known to unknown. The beginning teacher commonly #takes 
e mistake of failing to consider that which the pupils bring 
the situation, or, if he considers this question, answers it in 
rms of his own apperceptive mass. Either of these attitudes 
fatal to effective presentation. To quote Dr. Herbert Foster’: 
To say that instruction must take its beginnings in the familiar implies 
at the teacher shall know what is the familiar. He must know the 
pperceptive mass” of those whom he would instruct. One of the most 
mmon as well as serious mistakes of the beginning teacher is that of 
erestimating the knowledge and experience of his students. Facts and 
dgments which are familiar to him and are mistaken by him for the 
quisitions of his childhood may represent the gradual and unconscious 
quisition of his college life and be quite unknown to the high school 
y and girl. The teacher must be able to put himself in the place of the 
udent, seeing things through the latter’s eyes, and interpreting them in 
rms of his adolescent experience. 
What a pupil will get from a given experience ‘situation will 
epend upon two factors: that which he brings to the situation, 
nd the manner in which the new experience is approached. ° 
ence the first topic in the body of the lesson plan will have as 
ts purpose the summing up of the previous lesson and the re- 
lating of it to the new. In some lessons, however, the mate- 
ial previously learned will not form a direct background for 
hat which is to follow. In this event the subject matter for 
he first of the lesson will have to do with setting up the prob- 
em and bringing to consciousness such old experiences as will 
snable the pupils effectively to attack that which is new. After 
ging the subject matter for the introduction of the lesson 
he teacher must arrange the subject matter of the lesson body.

Simple to complex. In dealing with the question of simpli

what is logically complex may be pedagogically simple. 
experience may prove very complex when analyzed and yet 
the mind appear unitary and simple. One is proceeding fro: 
the simple to the complex pedagogically when one analyzes 
flower or a social situation. The total situation is relative 
simple. It is only as one analyzes to discover the unitary par 
and their relation to one another and to the totality that t 
situation becomes complex. Multitudinous relations beco: 
apparent and complicate matters as one proceeds. On the oth 
hand, proceeding from the simple to the complex in such a su 
ject as mathematics means the following of the logical orde 
Addition should precede multiplication. Hence we see that g 
ing from the simple to the complex does not always mean goin| 
from the part to the whole but may at times mean going fro: 
the whole to the part, and that what from the standpoint 
science may seem simple and unitary may not be simple an 
unitary from the standpoint of the pupils’ thinking.. The maxi: 
“Proceed from the simple to the complex” might better b 
stated, “Go from that which is simple for the pupil to th

Concrete to abstract. The pupils must begin the study o 
qualities in their relation to the things or situations with whicl 
they are experienced. The young:child kflows two sticks o 
candy from three sticks of candy. He connects twoness anc

orts do not function until we come back to concrete situations 
d apply what we have discovered; that is, learning proceeds 
t only from the concrete to the abstract but from the abstract 
ck to the concrete. The child learns that 9 and 8 are 17, and 
0 that 12 and 5 are 17. These manipulations in the abstract 
le brought back to the concrete and tested when he takes in- 
ntory of such possessions as marbles. The tendency to test 
d the ability to make applications of the generalizations 
med are the ultimate tests of successful teaching. Hence in 
iganizing the subject matter the teacher should be careful to 
oceed from the concrete to the abstract but should also pro- 
de for application of the principles developed. 
Illustration. Foster reserves the use of the word “‘illustra- 
n” in connection with lesson development for “that concrete 
laterial which is employed in formulating the abstraction and 
owing its implication. The concrete which follows the com- 
eted abstraction is ‘properly application.”! Abstractions 
ould originate in the concrete, and the greater the number of 
od illustrations the more effective the lesson. In an excellent 
scussion of this topic Professor Foster in substance gives the 
lowing requirements of a good illustration: 
1. The illustration should be familiar to the student. 
2. The illustration should be accurate. 
3. The illustration should be as simple as is consistent with 
curacy and adequacy. 
4. Illustration should be significant; that is, the student 
10uld know what it is intended to illustrate. 
Procedure. Along with the problem of so arranging the sub- 
ct matter as to attain the aims of the lesson, there must be 
mnsidered the method of procedure, or the forms of develop-

Today we take upin order transpiration, photosynthesis, and respirat 
Who will give me first of all a definition of transpiration in plan| 
(The process of giving off water in the form of vapor, from the sto! 
of plants, is called transpiration.) 
As we go farther south we find in the damp places trees with |. 
leaves, and in the dry places trees with practically no leaves. Can so 
one explain the first fact—that trees in the damp places of the So 
have larger leaves than those up here? (Discussion: Under humid 
mospheric conditions transpiration, other things being equal, is not 
great as under dry atmospheric conditions. The size of any part of 
plant is dependent upon a continuous sugar and starch supply. Si 
there is less interference with photosynthesis by water vapor esca) 
through the stomata under humid conditions, more food is manufactu 
than under ordinary conditions. Thus the leaves, which share this f 
with the rest of the plant, grow larger. This is also true of plants gr 
ing in the shade, as the dandelion, which has larger leaves in the sh: 
and smaller ones in bright, open, sunny places.) 
Now we will go to the other extreme of which I spoke; namely, t! 
condition in which the tree has practically no leaves. (Discussion: 
dry places like the desert it is necessary to conserve the water, and t 
we find only cactus plants with tough and small leaves giving a s 
evaporation surface.) Why is it necessary to conserve moisture? W| 
is liable to happen if evaporation is too rapid? In what other wi 
does nature protect her plants from too rapid evaporation? (Hal

lely spreading roots. Explain this fact. 
The process of transpiration, or of evaporation, is not a mere drying 
but is an important function of the leaves of most seed plants and of 
higher spore plants. In such forms as the cactus, which is practically 
fless, transpiration is performed by the epidermis of the stem. Thus 
can say that other parts of the plant body may perform this func- 
n, although the leaf retains it as its own function. 
Now we know a little concerning this very important function of the 
nt body. What function of our own body takes the place of tran- 
ration in the plant body? Perspiring. Compare the act of perspiring 
th transpiration. (Air pores, cooling, taking in water.) 
We will leave transpiration for the time being, but will remember it 
id recall it time and time again in our discussion of the internal struc- 
ire of the leaf. 
The next function is not given a technical name in our book, but in 
ur outside references I am sure that someone came across the word 
hotosynthesis.” Just what is meant by photosynthesis ? 
The manufacture, by the plant, in tissues exposed to sunlight, of car- 
hydrate food from raw materials is known as photosynthesis (photo, 
ight” ; synthesis, “‘putting together”). Let us liken the whole process 
photosynthesis to the operation of a factory. Consider the leaves as 
e building, the sunlight as the heat, or power, the chloroplasts as the 
achinery, the enzymes as the workers, carbon dioxide and water as the 
w materials. Sugar and oxygen result as the finished products. 
The sugar is not stored in the leaves. Why? (Soluble in sap.) Where 
it stored and in what conditions? (In seeds, fruits, bulb stems, and 
ots. Sugar in grapes, protein in beans, starch in potatoes, fat in 
its.) 
I should think that when a plant goes on forming carbohydrates day 
and day out, so much would eventually be formed that the cells of the 
af would be full and it would be impossible to carry on photosynthesis 
1y more. Explain. 
If the plants continue using carbon dioxide as fast as our book says 
ey do, why is it that they do not use it all up? (Animals decay as well 
vegetables ; burning of fuel.) 
Did anyone find in his physiology anything in the human being to 
mpare with this function of plants? Discuss.

(1) To show how old assignment leads to new work 
(2) To create interest in new work 
(3) To point out difficulties 
b. Assignment 
We have at various times throughout the course pointed out analo; 
between the functions of plant and of animal life. We have just finis| 
the study of transpiration, called in the animal world “perspiratio: 
We have learned that both plants and animals perspire. Tomorrow 
shall take up respiration, which is another life function common to pla 
and animals. Respiration in the animal world is called breathing— 
taking in of oxygen and the giving off of carbon dioxide, CO,. 
In preparing for tomorrow’s lesson try to account for the fact tl 
animal life is not injured by the poisonous carbon dioxide which is bei 
continually given off by plants and animals. You will find the answer 
well as a discussion of respiration and its functions on pages 248-2 
of the text. 
6. Laboratory instruction 
To understand how the plant carries on these various functions 
which we have been speaking, it is necessary to know something of t 
structure of the plant body. 
I have here some prepared slides containing cross sections of leay 
from the lily of the valley. Draw one of these carefully and label all t 
parts—upper epidermis, palisade cells, spongy mesophyll, air spac 
veins, stomata, and lower epidermis. You will find a good diagram 
your book on page 139. Compare this diagram with what you see in t 
microscope, but make your drawing of what you see on the slide. 
When you have finished, take a new piece of drawing paper and dr: 
an enlarged stoma. Label the guard cells and the opening. 
7. Laboratory supervision 
Immediately after laboratory instruction I shall ask the class to go 
the laboratory for work, each taking a specimen and a microscope as 
passes my desk. In the meantime I shall have prepared the specime 
for distribution and shall have seen that the microscopes are ready. 
soon as the pupils are seated I shall go around, seeing that each pupil 
properly supplied and ready to proceed.

Description of plan of attack on lesson 
a. Summary of the previous lesson 
  Teacher. For the last two days we have been discussing two of the 
eat essayists— Addison and Steele. We decided that, as far as we can 
ll, they were fairly representative of the eighteenth century. Do you 
call what characterized their essays ? 
Pupil. A conversational tone, wit, fluency, humor. 
T. Exactly. And what do you recall about their style? 
P. Familiar, simple, polished. 
T. Yes. These two, we know, had not a little influence in the London 
f their time. They were successful writers and more or less popular 
cially. Addison died in 1719 and Steele in 1729.

b. Description of attack on today’s lesson 
  T. Just six years after Steele’s death a young man with the v 
prosaic name of Samuel Johnson came to London. Do you know 
he entered the city? Just use your imaginations. 
P. He was poor—he probably was very shabby. 
P. He probably had to walk. 
T. He very probably had to walk, and undoubtedly he was vi 
shabby. He probably had only the clothes on his back. What he acc 
plished in London, I presume you all have read in your texts. So we 
forget about that and talk about Dr. Johnson himself. It has been si 
of him that his personality was greater than his literature. How do 
account for that ? 
P. Well, nobody reads what he writes. 
P. He influenced other writers. 
T. I believe that his influence on other writers and on other men 
followed other professions—for he influenced more than merely writ 
—accounts for that statement better than the fact that no one reads 
writings. Granted then that he influenced other men, we want to fi 
out how and why and we want to know who these men were. We start 
out to talk about personality. What is personality ? 
It is everything about a man. 
It’s his education. 
It’s his bringing-up. 
Which of these answers is correct ? 
All of them. 
Then his personality is the sum total of a man, may we sa: 
ery: well, let us look at Dr. Johnson and try to find out hath is the st 
total—the personality that is so great. Tell us something about | 
life first. 
P. He was a bookseller’s son. He went to Oxford and couldn’t affo 
to stay very long. Then he tried to teach school but couldn’t get a 
pupils. Then he went to London, where he wrote for some magazir 
and published a dictionary and some other things. He never made mu 
money, and what he did make he gave away. His publishers always ¢ 
the biggest slice. He started a Literary Club and everything he said we 
P. He married a widow with several children. She was old and us 
and not very good to him, but he thought she was just right. 
T. That is the bare outline of Johnson’s life. However, I belie 
you have illustrated three of the four great characteristics of Johnson Spry te ety

at I call the four great characteristics. What have you illustrated? 
yone. 
P. His generosity. 
T. How? 
P. He gave away most of what he had. 
T. Yes, you know Johnson had a very soft heart. He was continually 
ping Goldsmith out, for Goldsmith couldn’t save anything. In a court 
ar Fleet Street, Johnson had a home that he turned really, if not in- 
tionally, into a home for anyone who might touch his heart. The 
ortment of old people he had there would have been funny if they 
d not been so pitiful—old wrecks he had picked up off the streets of 
mdon, who would have been in the poorhouse but for him. It was a 
1 spectacle to see them. It was sad, too, that they were not the least 
uteful, even in appearance, and often complained about their food. 
ww, what other characteristic was illustrated ? 
P. His loyalty. 
T. Yes. How he clung to his wife! She was a dull, shrewish person, 
seems, not very kind to him but yet attached to him. He was very 
arsighted, so he couldn’t see that she was a coarse, painted creature 
ice his age. He waited on her, idolized her as though she were a 
incess, until her death, and long after her death he spoke of her with 
ve and admiration. Do you recall any other characteristic? 
P. He always had his own way in the Literary Club. 
T. Exactly. Suppose we call that his “dogmatism.” Before we talk 
out his dogmatism and the Literary Club, suppose we list the members 
d their professions. Who were they ? 
P. Gibbon, historian. 
P. Burke, orator. 
P. Goldsmith, writer. 
T. Any others? There is Reynolds, a painter; you should know 
m. And Fox—Charles James Fox—a young Whig statesman. And 
avid Garrick, one of Johnson’s few pupils in his teaching days, later an 
tor of great genius. You should all know this of Garrick, that his re- 
val of Shakespeare took London by storm. Sheridan, the playwright, 
d Jones, the greatest linguist of the time, were also members of the 
ub. Wasn’t that a very versatile group of men? And over them 
r. Johnson maintained unquestionedrule. Howdo yousuppose he didit ? 
P. He was a good talker and a good. critic. 
P. He was honest and fearless. 
P. He had read a lot.  
-P-A-G-E-280
  268 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
T. You have given the real reasons, I believe. He was the wid 
read of all that group. He was an excellent talker. It is said that 
was a better talker than writer because when he talked he didn’t ca 
to such an extreme his long involved sentences and his use of Latini 
words. He dominated the conversation in the Literary Club. He ov 
ruled every opinion counter to his own. He had a giant intellect—p 
haps we might say that the very size of his intellect crushed his 
ponents. Those opponents didn’t agree with him always. They were 
of an independent cast of mind. But they respected him very mu 
They knew what a struggle his life had been and how, in spite of all od 
he had won. They couldn’t help but respect him. They knew his g 
erosity—some of them had profited by it; they knew his loyalty; 
did not resent his dogmatism, because they felt his real superiori' 
There was one other characteristic that they appreciated which no o 
mentioned in particular. Does anyone recall it? No? His indeper 
ence. Your text told the story of his relations with Lord Chesterfie 
Probably those men admired him most for his conduct toward tl 
nobleman. 
I think we are justified in saying, then, that Dr. Johnson was : 
spected because of his loyalty, his generosity, and his independence 
mind; that because he was respected his domination was accepted 
these members in the Literary Club. By saying his domination was < 
cepted I do not mean that they believed everything he said; I me 
they did not quarrel or dispute with him. Almost all his literary juc 
ments have been reversed now. Many of his associates were mode 
enough then to see clearer than he; but because he was what he v 
they considered his word as much as theirs. Among the nonliter 
people his word, which was really old-fashioned, was more popular, m« 
readily accepted than that of the other members of the club. That 
why his judgment on a new book could make it or ruin it. In literati 
he belonged to the age that was passing. Some of those men who we 
members of the club were of the new age—Goldsmith, for instance. 
Before we leave Dr. Johnson we want to have an idea of his perso! 
appearance. Look at this picture. Notice the massive head, the clur 
body, his general untidiness. It is said that those who loved him h 
much to forgive because he was so untidy and had such abominal 
manners. He was frequently cross and gruff, too, for all through his | 
he suffered much from an incurable disease. 
We know now what Johnson looked like, what sort of man he w 
and with whom he associated. Do any of you believe that the statem: 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
LESSON XXIX 269 
th which we began the lesson—that his personality was greater than 
work—is justifiable ? 
  P. Well, if he was respected, his opinion would be respected. Even 
ople who didn’t read his writings would know what he said, because 
was probably talked about. Everyone who liked him and knew what 
d of man he was would feel that his opinion ought to be respected. 
T. Exactly. So his opinion traveled faster by force of his personality 
an by force of his writings.

T. We’ve been spending some time, now, on the great figures in the 
ge of Classicism. There are several others whom we cannot afford to 
verlook. We mentioned some when we spoke of the Literary Club. 
Tho were they? 
P. Burke, Goldsmith, Gibbon. 
T. Yes, and one more. Whenever we mention Johnson we think of 
ymeone closely connected with him. Whom? 
P. Boswell. 
T. Yes. So tomorrow we will round out our study of this age with 
consideration of these men. You will not have any trouble with Bos- 
ell or Gibbon, I believe. Be very careful when you come to Goldsmith. 
Je said today that he belonged to the age following the Age of Classi- 
sm. Try to discover why he is included in the chapter on Johnson, 
oswell, Burke, and Gibbon. To appreciate Burke you must know some- 
ting about the history of England in this period. He was a member of 
arliament. Assuming that his manhood covered the years 1750 to 1707, 
hat world events would claim his attention ? 
P. The American Revolution and the French and Indian War. 
P. The French Revolution. 
T. Any others? No? There is one other of importance. I want all 
f you to read upon it. It is the beginning of English domination in 
ndia. Pay close attention to what your authors say about the results 
aat Burke’s oratory accomplished. That is all.

  Lesson plans to be utilized in the process of teaching. Less 
plans are made only because they result in better teaching ; th 
are means, not®ends in themselves. The student teacher has n 
been asked to make one for the sake of form or for the purpo 
of consuming his time. The making of a lesson plan requir 
a study and reorganization of the material which must be a 
complished by the one who would teach the lesson successfull 
regardless of his experience. This is the first step in afty proce 
of teaching. The difference between the lesson plan of tHe b 
ginning teacher and that of the veteran lies in the fact that tl 
beginner’s plan is more detailed and usually is written ot 
But all well-taught lessons are the result of planning. 
Although the experienced teacher may change the details 
his plans as the lesson proceeds, the beginner cannot do so wit 
out running great risk of failufe. He should make a plan car 
fully and follow it closely. As was said in a preceding less 
of this text, such a rigid following of the lesson plan will mal 
the first few lessons somewhat formal and stilted. However, 
will do much to assure correctness of procedure, which will | 
followed by ease and grace of performance as experience 
gained. 
The student teacher should study his plan with great care 
order that he may follow it with little effort during the cla 
period. If the plan can be typewritten it will be easier to rez 
and the process of following it will be much facilitated.

Pe preparations than making a lesson plan. The student 
cher should make other preparations also. Since one’s first

uld take such care in matters of dress, etc..as to feel entirely 
ease before the class. Even experienced teachers lose in ef- 
ttiveness of presentation at times when they feel that their 
less and general appearance are bad. The beginning teacher 
mnot afford this handicap. He should, moreover, arrive early 
ough to have everything in order when the class arrives: 
le shades adjusted, the material devices at hand, etc. It is 
good plan to observe the pupils as they arrive, for this will 
rve to adjust the teacher to the situation before taking up 
le work. 
Care to be taken during the first few days to build the proper 
lations between class and teacher. In regard to the matter of 
scipline it is well to avoid, if possible, the use of other than 
meral devices at this time. The pupils are likely to take the 
titude of loyalty to the group, the teacher being an out-

kely to happen unless the teacher violates the suggestions

at the beginning. For example, the teacher may have attend 
a high school in which the pupils have been spoken to 
“Mister” and “Miss.” Regardless of his own feelings on 
matter, when teaching in a school in which only the given nat 
is used, he should use the pupils’ first names. To do otherwi 
causes unnecessary distraction and possibly makes the class fe 
that he is queer. 
Since the regular staff of the school appears older and mc 
dignified than the student body, the student teacher, who 
himself in school and more akin to the student body in age a 
habits, must not make this fact too conspicuous: His dre 
should be plain and his manners dignified. Such consideratio 
are, of course, mere matters of common sense. But the | 
ginning teacher has so many other things to consider th 
he may overlook these if his attention is not specifically call 
to them.

LESSON XXXI 
Aim To avoid the classroom mistakes commonly made 
beginning teachers. 
  Many shortcomings of beginning teachers traced to lack 
self-confidence. If we can do anything to overcome lack 
self-confidence we shall, at least to some extent, have prepar| 
ourselves to teach. Confidence in ourselves begets others’ c 
fidence in us, and, other things being equal, we learn best fr 
those in whom we have confidence. Let us then consider at tk 
point means by which the student teacher may add to } 
self-confidence. 
Our first suggestion is that he take mental note of his traini 
and experience and compare them with those of the avera 
pupil in the class. He has graduated from a good high scho 
which in itself indicates training superior to that of any memb 
of the class, even though the class is advanced. Along with tl 
he has had additional academic training and also profession 
training. The self-conscious student teacher will find it helpf 
to take this honest inventory of himself at times when he fee 
timid about appearing before the class. 
Timidity, which is a form of negative self-feeling, is a mi 
emotion. James and Lange give us a suggestion at this poit 
The emotion will not arise unless preceded by certain physic 
adjustments. The student teacher can do much to overcor 
timidity by taking the proper physical attitude. If he kee

       ce mild but firm, he will tend to produce thereby feeling- 
es of a positive character, that is, to produce a positive self- 
ing. Of course the teacher must be modest, but there is a 
erence between modesty and timidity. 
ack of knowledge is another potent cause for lack of self- 
fidence. Not only should the teacher be master of the 
terial to be presented, but he should, at the same time, com- 
hend the material in its broader setting. This will give him 
leserve for any possible emergency and hence give him a feel- 
of security. Not only should the teacher know his subject 
its broader aspect, but he should be generally well read if he 
to be at home before a class. A wide reading of a general 
racter will do much to take one’s mind off the trivial, and 
o off oneself, and to center it upon larger values. Hence one 
idote for timidity before a class is study.

ugh overconfidence is less common than lack of confidence, 
asionally a student teacher’s difficulties may be traced to it. 
is is more likely to be true among students who have had a 
lar or more of experience and have been pronounced successful 
chers. Such teachers often teach well enough to “get by” 
d yet teach far below their capacity. However, overconfi- 
mce is not confined to those who have taught, but is some- 
es found among those who have never taught. The writer 
alls the case of a student teacher who, upon being told that 
le was failing to improve and that she should observe another 
cher for a while, replied, “I don’t think much of her as a 
cher.” The teacher whom she was told to observe was one 
th a long and successful experience, whereas the student 
lacher was teaching her first few lessons with all the failings 
a beginner. Overconfidence gives the wrong attitude toward 
provement and lessens the possibility of improvement. A 
rtain amount of humility is not only becoming in the student 
acher but necessary if he is ultimately to rise to his full

promptness in preparing assigned work. The pupil who is 
wed to build up the habit of putting off disagreeable tasks 
il the last possible moment and then doing the work in great

cher should be careful not to make impossible assignments 
outside work. He should consider the students’ program and

extra task for a night when the student is to rehearse for

The problem of getting pupils to speak plainly and distinc

if bitterness is not to follow, for the pupil’s pride will be

1. Failure to differentiate between motives. 
2. Failure to differentiate between minor and major offens 
3. An imperious attitude toward classroom discipline. 
4. A fear of inability to discipline. 
The beginning teacher, owing to his lack of experience, is 
a disadvantage in evaluating both the motives for breaches 
discipline and the effects. Hence each offense brings a respo1 
from him; nothing is trivial enough to be overlooked. Of cou 
he cannot prepare an elaborate Course of action suitable to ez 
offense. He finds that a well-directed rebuke leaves awe in 
wake and causes silence to reign. When the next trivial offer 
takes place he recalls the method which worked so well the fi 
time and repeats it, but with less effect. After a few repetitic

pupils take on the condition that psychologists speak of as

he beginning teacher is often incapacitated because of his 
itude toward the problem of discipline. The imperious man- 
often assumed may be occasioned by a sense of inability to 
form the task of governing the schoolroom. The teacher 
Is that the least breach of order is a questioning of his 
thority and he reacts to it as to a personal affront. Under 
se circumstances he reacts to even trivial offenses with de-

ack of humor. Many a perplexing situation will end all 
ht if the parties concerned are only able to see the humor- 
Ss side of it. There is after all much truth in the poet’s words: 
Laugh and the world laughs with you, 
Weep and you weep alone. 
  xis does not mean that the teacher should take nothing seri- 
sly, but rather that he should not magnify his troubles. 
1ings are not so bad as they seem, and the great big world will 
ll on just the same. The teacher should learn, therefore, to 
tempt to see the humorous side of many unpleasant school- 
om experiences. It is the situation about which we lose our 
mpers that causes regret later. To see the humorous side of a 
uation does not mean that one will do nothing about it. On 
e contrary, having laughed over the matter we are more likely 
deal with it objectively and to come out more successfully.

  Indistinct enunciation. The teacher who cannot be heard 
tinctly in all parts of the room encourages the attention of m 
pupils to shift to other stimuli that are playing upon them m 
effectively. The shifting of attention results in other intere 
and shortly in disturbances that make it more difficult for 
teacher to be understood. The teacher in such instances 
likely to blame the pupils, thinking of them as indiffere| 
whereas in reality the trouble goes back to his shortcoming 
the matter of distinct enunciation. He should remember at t 
point that more depends upon the way the word is said t! 
upon the force with which it is said. To raise the pitch of 
voice ruins discipline, as we have shown in an earlier les: 
(see Lesson VII, p. 54). Improvement will come by raisi 
the head, looking squarely at the class, and carefully formi 
the syllables in the words. Besides, many talk too rapid| 
thus running the words together. The teacher should gu: 
against this fault also and, if he suspects it, deliberately atte 
to talk more slowly. 
Poor teaching. Poor teaching is the greatest single cause 
poor discipline. Therefore the teacher with disciplinary prc 
lems should look first to his presentation of subject matter as 
source of difficulty. Is the work thoroughly planned? Is the 
a definite task to be accomplished at each period? Do t 
teacher and pupils accomplish task units at each period? 
there a sufficient testing of the results? Do the pupils kn 
the results of the tests? Are the pupils kept too long at 
given task? Is the presentation of the material psychologic: 
These are questions which the teacher should ask himself 
locating sources of disciplinary difficulty.

t this down as a primal law of good order.+ 
Indiscreet familiarity with pupils. Although the student 
lacher is not likely to have much opportunity to become famil- 
ir with the pupils, something should be said upon this point. 
o teacher is thoroughly trained who is not able so to direct 
is acquaintance with pupils as to exert his best influence upon 
em. The saying that familiarity breeds contempt, though 
tt a partial truth, offers much for consideration. The teacher 
lho cannot meet pupils in a dignified manner without becoming 
natural had better avoid such association, for a while at least, 
d begin a study of himself. He should, if possible, observe 
her teachers in their association with pupils. Regardless of a 
acher’s ability to associate effectively with pupils, no pupil 
ould be made to feel that he is entitled to any special con- 
deration or favors. It is in the carrying of intimacy to this 
int that the greatest harm may be done. 
‘Failure to routinize work properly. As was said several 
ssons earlier in this text, there is a point beyond which routini- 
ation should not go (see page 62). The teacher will not go 
ur astray on this point if he keeps the purpose of routine in 
iind. Only those activities which facilitate the learning proc- 
ss should be routinized. However, one often finds routine be- 
oming an end in itself and getting in the way of learning. The 
yckstep used in some prisons is not exactly an end in itself, but 
is not intended to prepare men to live in normal society. The 
rison may ignore normal life; but we, as teachers, cannot 
snore the fact that we are preparing people for life outside 
he school by teaching them to live properly within it. On the

that men live most fully in the society that contains a cert:

done early in the semester and put into the form of a rather 
ible schedule, such organization will prevent many daily 
rries as to the progress of the class. 
eeping uppermost in mind the pupils’ needs in terms of 
ends of education has the salutary effect of stabilizing the 
cher’s activities. It gives him a criterion for determining the 
ount of time that should be allotted to a given topic and a 
ling that something has been accomplished at the end of a 
en period. It takes the humdrum and daily grind out of the 
cher’s life and leaves in its place the pleasure of creating. 
der such conditions the teacher is not so easily annoyed, and 
rvous haste gives way to patient thoroughness. We would 
escribe for this situation the taking of a philosophical attitude 
ward one’s work and life in general. By this we do not mean 
indifferent attitude toward what is going on, but rather a 
ilosophy that will orient one’s activities and prevent the 
rry and useless mobility which come from not having guiding 
inciples that center one’s attention upon the really important 
complishments. 
A few suggestions are in order here by way of supplying the 
ginning teacher with the proper attitude and the necessary 
spiration. The student teacher will draw much of his needed 
spiration from the classroom, and he should, at the same time,

t much valuable conference time is lost by the failure of

dent is really desirous of improving will he be amenable to 
structive criticism. Nothing matters to him in the long run

to sacrifice any petty personal vanity regarding his present 
ility. Perhaps the thing that we are trying to say here can be 
id better through an illustration. The writer had had three 
ars of experience as a teacher before taking practice teaching.

Utilization of conference suggestions. If the conference

relative to his classroom problems, he has, no doubt, recei 
suggestions which, if properly utilized, will greatly improve 
teaching. But they must be taken seriously, and every eff 
must be made to apply them. It may be, either because t 
student has not effectively described the situation or becav 
his personality is a large factor in it, that the supervisor c

overlook the fact that a device which will succeed at one til

many similar elements, but some will differ both in amount a 
in quality, forming a total situation of a complexion that w 
differ from any previous or future one—hence the futility of gi 
ing or attempting to follow inflexible modes of procedure. If t 
supervisor can detect the violation of an established princir 
of the art of teaching, he may point out the principle and of

ct to be guided to certain success by the suggestions of the 
pervisor. Were such possible, it would only provide for the 
\mediate situation and not prepare the student for new situa- 
ms to follow. Each suggestion of the supervisor should be 
refully thought over in the light of what the student knows 
out the principles of teaching. He should in the same way 
udy his successes and failures. Merely to be satisfied to recog- 
ze one’s success or failure and accept what help can be had 
om the supervisor will not suffice. There must be a deter- 
ination to improve one’s teaching power, which results in 
oughtful effort. There is no royal road to teaching.

PART IV 
INTRODUCTION 
  The student will discover as he enters the task of teachi 
that the principles of psychology and pedagogy take on a n 
significance for him. In his earlier professional courses he hi 
read with a view to use of the material at some future time. 
possibly with a view to credit only. The situation is entire 
different now. The student is face to face with problems whi 
are very real and which must be solved. This will tend to git 
him an active rather than a passive attitude toward the theo! 
which he has studied previously. He will need not only to r 
fresh his mind on the principles of psychology and pedago; 
which have a bearing upon each problem as it arises but also | 
master them so that he may apply them. He should have 
few well-selected books at his command. At the end of eac 
lesson will be found such a list with reference to the top 
under consideration. The reading of the text along with suc 
of the selected readings as time permits should greatly he 
the student teacher in solving such problems as arise in tl 
classroom. 
Part IV will serve to guide the student through the period | 
actual instruction. It is, of course, impossible to arrange tl 
lessons to conform at all times to the order of attack in tl 
classroom. Hence it will be necessary to adjust to the classroo 
instruction the order of reading Part IV. With such an adjus 
ment it is possible to parallel the classroom activity at all tim 
with reading which has a direct bearing upon the problem und 
consideration.

    It is the purpose of the longer lesson plan to cause the student 
cher to work out the lesson procedure in every detail. These 
ns, if closely followed, will assure him of laying the proper 
ching patterns. After a few lessons have been taught with 
rrect form, even though somewhat mechanically, the teacher 
lay, with the advice and consent of the supervisor, reduce ma- 
rially the size of the lesson plan. The writer would recom- 
lend that this be done after teaching from three to five lessons, 
pending upon the success of the teaching. These reduced 
ans should be used for about ten lessons, when, if the teaching 
of average success, further reduction of the plan may be 
ade. 
Unless the supervisor wishes to inspect the plans before or 
ter teaching, it will not be necessary to place at the top of 
nally reduced plans the subject, room, date, and hour. The 
acher now may drop also a statement of the remote aims, the 
signment aims, and the general physical devices. Procedure

yuld begin using the type of lesson plan that he will be likely

Aim. To understand the characteristics of the drill meth 
and to become skillful in conducting this type of cla 
room exercise. 
  Correct form should precede practice. To understand: t 
full significance of the statement that the correct form shou} 
precede practice it may be necessary for the student to revi 
his elementary psychology. Let us go back for a moment to t 
neural basis of habit formation by studying the followi: 
diagram. 
Suppose an impulse to be traveling along the neurone A. 
us suppose that the impulse was set off by hearing “g x 8.” 
us again suppose that it is necessary for the impulse to tra 
over the neurone C through the synapse £ if the correct 
sponse 72 is to result. Let us further suppose that for so 
reason the first impulse passes through the synapse D and ov 
the neurone B, resulting in the response 54. The question 
point is, Just what effect has this initial wrong response up: 
subsequent responses? To answer we must return to the lay 
of the synapse, one of which says in effect, Each passage of ¢ 
impulse over a synapse tends to break down the synapse so th: 
subsequent impulses more readily pass. This will mean_ th 
having once made the response 54, the same response is mo 
likely to follow the stimulus 9 x 8 in the future. The mo 
frequent the response 54 results the more difficulty will be er 
countered in attempting to cause the energy ‘to pass over tk 
synapse £ and the neurone C, resulting in the correct respons 
72. Hence the importance of preceding practice with the co 
rect forms.

rills should aim to automatize. If drills have been preceded 
the correct forms, they have served to break down only the 
apses which it is desirable to break down; that is, they have 
served to break down synapses which lead to the wrong 
jponse. They have further served to break down only the 
apses that must be broken down. A chain of synapses and 
rones may lead to the correct response by a route other than 
most direct. If, for example, in teaching a child to add 
nd 4, I permit him to go through the process of breaking the 
nto equal parts and adding them individually to 3, resulting

3+2=5 and 5+2=7, I have permitted him to develop 
rcuitous paths of neural discharge and hence greatly increased 
s chances of giving the wrong response. The possibilities of 
ith accuracy and automatization have been lessened. 
Speed of response desirable as an aid to automatization. The 
ow response provides opportunity for the development or 
ntinuation of nonessential synaptic connections. Hence drills 
ould be rapid, the teacher demanding an immediate and 
rrect response to the stimulus. 
Drills should be so conducted that all members of the class 
spond to each stimulus. Imagine the waste of time in a class 
twenty pupils if the teacher so conducts the drill that the 
ily one benefiting is the one responding. This condition will 
stain unless the teacher makes a conscious effort to avert it.
-P-A-G-E-328
316 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  If the stimulus is given to the class as a whole and a meml 
is called upon immediately for a response, all have the adv. 
tage of the drill. Teachers often make the mistake, howev 
of announcing before giving the stimulus the student to 
called upon. Such a situation means time out for the majorij 
of the class. 
Stimuli and responses must not become chainlike unless su 
sequential responses are desirable in the future. An individ 
may know the nines so as to begin with 9 x 1:and continue wi 
no apparent effort to and including 9 x 12 and yet, if asked 
respond to 9g x 8, find himself unable to respond without fi 
going to a recognized part of the nines, perhaps the very fir: 
and repeating all in order until 9 x 8 is reached. This resu 
from the peculiar chain association in which the nines were ori 
naily learned. Chainlike associations, if once formed, must | 
broken down before facility in the use of the tables can be ad 
quate to practical situations. 
Such associations should not have been formed originall 
Each stimulus and response in the case of the multiplicatic 
tables should be effectively connected through drill, but shou 
be completely independent of any other stimulus and respons 
That is, 9 x 8= 72 should be no more tied up with 9 x 7 =¢ 
than 9 xX 8= 72 is tied up with 3 x 4=12. There should |

The learning of the multiplication tables, the memorizing of

words, the laws of habit formation are applicable to all. TI 
full recognition of this fact is necessary for the proper unde 
standing of drill rules.
-P-A-G-E-329
  LESSON XXXIV 317 
Memorizing poetry or prose form of drill. The difference 
tween the memorizing of poetry or prose and the learning of 
le_ multiplication tables so that instant response follows a 
en stimulus lies in the fact that the former consists of estab- 
hing a chain of connected responses of such a nature that 
sponse No. 1 becomes in turn the stimulus which brings re- 
onse No. 2. {Che learning of poetry or prose is then a mat- 
ir of breaking down synaptic connections in such an order that 
e desired responses follow in correct succession and without 
parent effort.) To obtain this result with the least effort it is 
cessary to give pupils directions for study and encourage 
em to carry out these directions. 
Pupils should memorize by wholes rather than parts. Experi- 
ental evidence relative to the comparative merits of whole and 
rt learning is not yet as conclusive as it might be, but we 
ve much to support the belief that the advantages favor the 
hole method of learning. Starch discusses the question as 
lows : 
In committing material to memory, learn by wholes rather than by 
ts. Poetry or prose can, as a rule, be memorized more quickly if the 
aterial is read through as a whole from beginning to end than if it is 
emorized in small sections of two or three lines; and what is more 
portant, when this method is employed, the retention is more per- 
anent. With many persons who are accustomed to memorizing by the 
rt method, there is frequently no saving of time in the first learning 
rtly because the whole method is new to them and partly because the 
arner often doubts the advisability of using the whole method. 
There are three reasons why the whole method proves in the long run 
be more economical: (1) Learning by parts establishes many useless 
d interfering connections. Thus in committing the first two lines of a 
joem the association is established between the last word of the second 
ne and the first word of the first line. But this is not the order in which 
he lines are to be recalled. Rather the connection should be established 
etween the last word of the second line and the first word of the third 
ine as is done in the whole method. Consequently every portion memo- 
ized by itself forms at least one detrimental connection and in a long 5

selection a very considerable number of such associations are form 
These derailing paths probably account for the fact that pupils in 
citing a poem become stalled usually between the portions learned pie: 
meal. (2) Reading the material over as a whole gives a view of t 
entire selection and will serve to give meaning and correlation of t 
parts in the whole. It will help to organize the ideas as a who 
(3) Learning by parts is apt to produce great unevenness among tl 
various portions of the material in the degree of perfection of the mem 
rizing—Some parts, especially the early ones, will be repeated needless| 
a great many times and result in much greater over-learning of tho: 
parts than of other parts. One point of caution in using the whol 
method should, however, be noted. When the learner reads over tl 
entire selection to be memorized he does not make much visible progre 
until, after a sufficient number of repetitions, he is able to reprodu 
most of the material. This situation is likely to be discouraging, partic 
larly to children. Perhaps the most effective manner of employing t! 
whole method is to learn the material in relatively large sections inste 
of as a complete whole, particularly if the selection is very long. 
Parker uses the following illustration to show one advanta 
of whole over part learning: ps

session. Of course, the reader will recognize that there is 
end to the distributions of time that could be made, and at ft 
present time educational experimentation would not justify a: 
set rule on the matter. Hence one may make the recommen 
tion in a most general way only. 
Drill period must be neither too short nor too long. It 
easily possible to prolong drill beyond the point at which 
turns justify the effort involved. Drill periods should be sh 
and intense. A part of the class period may be devoted to dr 
activity, which should cease before the point of diminishi 
returns is reached. It has been the writer’s experience that t 
beginning of the class period is most favorable for effective dri 
If the lesson consists entirely of drill material, the period shou 
be shortened accordingly. There seems to be a warming-t 
period during which the class is obtaining the proper set towa 
the work. The teacher should at no time lag with the pupi 
but should present the stimuli in rapid succession. 
Success of drill period will depend upon spirit of teache 
Much of the success of the drill period will depend upon t! 
spirit of the teacher. The teacher who steps before the cla 
with every evidence of lack of life and enthusiasm has alreac 
made a weak beginning. If, on the contrary, the teacher ste} 
briskly to his task, remains standing rather than seated, and 
every way takes an aggressive attitude toward his work, tl 
class is much more likely to respond in a desirable manner. 
Drills should be properly motivated. If the drill period is 
be most effective, the pupils must have a motive other than th 
of pleasing the teacher or merely taking part because that is t! 
expected thing to do. If, for example, the pupils discover 
their activity that they are checked because they lack respons 
which should be automatic, they are more likely to take ; 
interest in the necessary drill. Boys drill with prolonged inte 
est and effort upon football signals. Machine-like response

signals is necessary if the teamwork is to be effective. The 
blem is their problem; it is identified with their aims and in- 
ests, and hence the necessary drill will be entered into with 
the vim they can command. It is not to be inferred here 
t the writer believes that all school drill can be given as 
alistic a setting as that which takes place on the athletic 
1d. However, to the extent that such conditions do exist, to 
lat extent is motivation all that it should be for effective drill. 
ere are times when stern necessity must take a hand, and 
tives not generally recommended here must be used. These 
es, however, should be looked upon by the teacher as evi- 
nce of his failure so to direct the pupils’ interests as to lead

method and to become skillful in conducting this type

  The development method of instruction may be divid 
roughly into two classes, namely, conversational and lectur 
the former being the more suited to pupils in the grades and 
high school. The purpose of the developmental approach is 
organize the pupil’s background of experience in such a mann 
that he is led to the new problem in the best possible way. 
doing this the teacher may use a series of well-directed que 
tions, responses to which aid the pupils in organization; he m: 
lecture, or he may use a combination of questions and lectur 
It has been the writer’s experience that the latter method 3 
generally the most effective. 
All new ideas must be the result of development. Regardles 
of the intellectual devices that teachers employ, there is but on 
method by which new ideas are obtained, and that is the de 
velopmental method. We pass to the unknown by means of th 
known; that is, the new ideas take their rise from the old one 
So-called methods of teaching (intellectual devices) are bu 
means of facilitating this process. Every new idea must ¢

There is no other possible source. The teacher who forgets thi 
truth is almost sure to be guilty, sooner or later, of giving pupil 
words and formulas without corresponding ideas. Although : 
may be necessary for the teacher, through proper use of the lec 
ture method, to organize this background of experience wit 
respect to new ideas that lie just outside the pupil’s know

  rld, these new ideas can be assimilated only through the 
chic processes of the pupils themselves. 
(Developmental attack either inductive or deductive. In say- 
that the developmental attack may be inductive or deduc- 
e we mean that the teacher may begin with a stated principle 
d develop its verification, which is deductive ; or he may begin 
th specific instances and develop a general rule. The latter is 
le inductive approach. The point, however, which makes the 
thod developmental is the fact that instead of dogmatically 
forming the pupils of a given truth the teacher leads to its 
tablishment step by step. With the aid of the teacher the 
pil has made a bridge from the known to the previously 
known, which now becomes a part of his world of knowledge. 
rhaps he may have vaguely sensed the truth before; but not 
til his experience was properly marshaled and directed was 
new truth in reality his. This expansion of our world of 
leas must always come about through the process of growth, 
hich means only the working over and relating of ideas al- 
ady at hand. Whether we boldly expand the pupil’s world of 
eas at any given point and firmly establish this new boundary 
ne between his known and unknown world by bridging back 
y the known through justifiable contacts (deductive method), or 
arshal several ideas of his known world at one point and sud- 
snly burst the boundaries of previous knowledge so as to include 
new truth (inductive method), we are developing new ideas.

  become impatient and are not willing to remain with the pu 
conquering the territory as they advance. Such teachers 
usually brought to a realization of their error when, a few we 
later, a test reveals the fact that, although a few are at haili 
distance behind, the great body of the students are lost to vi 
having advanced little if any. Many teachers at this point o 
become the more impatient, attempting by means of a h 
review quickly to recover lost time. This is usually unsucce 
ful, since in all probability the first attempt was more confusi 
than enlightening. 
Exclusive use of developmental question usually wasteful 
time. As we have seen above, the exclusive use of the lectu 
method is ineffectual because the teacher usually arrives at t 
desired objective without the class, but the exclusive use of t 
developmental question usually tends to confusion with lit! 
or no advance on the part of anybody. At times the teack 
must sum up and organize the facts that questions have | 
vealed. It is also necessary at times to pave the way for t 
question by a short lecture on the part of the teacher. This, 
far as it goes, is the lecture method. Hence the attempt 
develop new ideas entirely by means of questions and answe 
is generally not feasible. 
Developmental-question method of approach to new ide 
likely to lead to discussion thatis off the topic. Althoughthedev 
opmental-question method is one of the most effective devices f 
developing new ideas in the pupil, it has the disadvantage of k

common in discussions that follow developmental questions. 
teacher who can be turned aside from his main objective thus 
ily is sure to become the victim of pupils who are not pre- 
red. Parker makes the following suggestion with respect to 
lgitimate uses of a conversational solution: 
In spite of the obvious dangers which beset the use of the conversa- 
nal method, it has certain very legitimate uses. As suggested above, 
best place is in the reflective solution of problems which the teacher 
s thoroughly mastered and for which the children possess the neces- 
ry data in their past experience. In such cases the important things 
r the teacher to keep in mind are the following: (1) To avoid being 
letracked. (2) To avoid spending too much time in an endeavor to 
t the class to discover a point. In order to preserve the balance of 
lative values the teacher should give some points outright or after a 
‘ief endeavor of the class to discover them. (3) To adapt the pace to 
dividual differences in capacities, not holding up the bright pupils too 
ng or hurrying so fast that the slow have no chance to contribute. 
Teacher must have thought through process clearly before 
ttempting to develop new ideas. Whether lecture or discussion 
; to predominate in the process of instruction, the teacher 
1ust previously think through the procedure. Owing to the 
mphasis that has been placed of late upon thinking, the unpre- 
ared teacher is likely to feel that, if the pupils are kept con- 
tantly involved in discussion through the hour, real teaching 
as been going on and the time has been well spent. This is 
mistake. Classroom thinking which results in extending the 
upils’ world of ideas is not generally brought about by hit-or- 
1iss discussion, but instead is the result of a careful organiza- 
on of material under the direction of the teacher. 
Teacher must think with pupils. In this connection it should

LESSON XXXVI 
  im. To become efficient in the presentation of those parts of a 
lesson which lead to appreciation. 
In the previous lesson we discussed the development of ideas. 
e now come to a consideration of the problem of developing 
preciations, which are no less important. It is possible to 
mceive of a philosopher’s maintaining that appreciations are, 
the last analysis, the more important, from the fact that they 
re ends in themselves rather than means to ends. Hence we, as 
achers, must ever keep in mind the need of developing appre- 
ation, and we must become skillful in the art. 
At this point we should note that the developing of apprecia- 
‘on, as the term is used in this text, differs from the developing 
f ideas in that emotional elements generally accompany appre- 
iation. The psychology of the emotions in their relation to 
e intellectual process must be understood. In the first place, 
should be noted that emotions are peculiar states of feeling 
sulting from bodily changes. They are often at war with the 
tellect, frequently owing to the fact that the neural paths 
hich set them off were established before the intellectual life 
ad reached maturity. For example, we may cling to the likes 
nd dislikes of childhood long after the intellect has condemned 
em. Hence it is important that these emotional activities be 
idwith great care, so that in later life there may be less necessity 
r radical readjustment. This means that the child’s emotional 
evelopment should be directed intelligently to the end that the 
est in art, literature, ethics, etc. shall give him pleasure. 
Enjoyment lessened by turning attention to technique of 
roduction. Not only is enjoyment possible without under-

  332 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
standing the means by which the results are produced, but t 
turning of attention to means of production may well be 
pected to lessen the enjoyment. The writer’s enjoyment 
the gridgraph, a device for graphically recording on a scre 
play by play the progress of a football game, was for a ti 
materially lessened by his being informed of the manner 
which the game was brought to the stage. He found that 
could regain some of that lost enjoyment by deliberately ref 
ing while watching a game to give attention to the means 
production. And so it is with similar forms of enjoyme 
When one becomes critical of the technique of conveyance o 
reacts upon the intellectual level and hence reduces for the ti 
being the possibility of reacting upon the emotional level. 
Knowledge of meanings not to be confused with knowled, 
of technique. Knowledge of meanings must not be confused 
this point with knowledge of technique. One may, for exampl 
study a poem intensively and gain in appreciation as one lear: 
more and more of the previously hidden meanings. The Laoco¢ 
group means much more to one who has learned the trut 
which the sculptor was attempting to relate and who has studi 
them in connection with the production. This type of know] 
edge is necessary to a full appreciation of any work of ar| 
Knowledge of technique, on the other hand, seems not to 
necessary. Many of us can enjoy a musical concert witho 
the ability to read a line of music, or enjoy a great painti 
without the least ability to paint. When this fact is couple 
with the experience common to all of us of hearing one wh 
knows something of technique complaining of the artist’s for 
of expression or lauding the most excruciating production o 
the grounds that the technique was difficult, we feel certain th: 
knowledge of technique is likely to turn one’s attention t 
technique rather than to that which it produces. 
Liking for the production should be developed before pupil 
attempt to reproduce it. If the pupils do not develop a likin
-P-A-G-E-345
  LESSON XXXVI 333 
the production before attempting to reproduce it, their own 
ak efforts are apt to become the center of attention, thus 
ering their appreciation of the masterpiece. This precau- 
mn is more necessary as one deals with more and more beau- 
ul works of art. In the case of literature the teacher should 
d a poem through several times, at intervals, in order to as- 
re enjoyment on the part of the pupils before allowing them 
read it or analyze it. If pupils are allowed to render music or 
etry, the most capable pupil should be selected for the task, 
d careful preparation on his part should be insisted upon. 
ter the pupils have learned to like a given selection, it may be 
alyzed and otherwise considered intellectually with less dan- 
r of ruining the possibility of enjoyment. 
It may be objected here that sometimes, as in the case of 
rowning’s works, analysis and study are necessary from the 
st if the pupil is ever to appreciate. The objection is valid, 
t the type of appreciation sought here is dependent more upon 
e intellect than upon the emotions. Of course, all apprecia- 
n has an intellectual background in the sense that meanings 
e being conveyed ; but the difference between intellectual and 
otional appreciation lies in the fact that the latter arises 
rgely from beauty of expression, whereas the former arises 
irgely from keenness of analysis and delineation. Such a dis- 
nction in types of appreciation is necessary, however, only in 
1e case of literature. Something somewhat akin to intellectual 
terary appreciation takes place in the case of the appreciation 
f technique. The difference here is perhaps quantitative rather 
1an qualitative. 
One learns to appreciate the best in music, art, literature, etc. 
y participating sympathetically in their outcomes. One is 
ided in learning to appreciate by taking a sympathetic atti- 
ide toward that which is being appreciated. The beauties in 
reign art or literature are not readily seen by the one who 
iews to scoff. The reason for this can be understood when one
-P-A-G-E-346
  334 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
recalls that, in the last analysis, appreciation is an emotio: 
reaction and that one emotion is blocked, in part at least, 
the simultaneous functioning of another. Hence pupils sho 
be prepared to appreciate by creating an atmosphere favoral 
to the task. Sacred music would lose much if played at a fo 
ball game, as would a waltz at a funeral. The setting must 
appropriate. 
Teacher should aim to develop appreciations recognized as 
the higher order by persons most fitted to judge. It is in ke 
ing with our natures ultimately to select that which the expe 
enced individual calls the beautiful, when we have participat 
in it long enough. One cannot go behind this. It is simply 
fact. Our natures are such that one set of stimuli pleases a 
another displeases. The teacher can set up only such situatio 
as will provide the stimuli that ultimately should give tho 
experiences which are recognized as of the higher order | 
persons fitted to judge. 
Ability to appreciate cannot be forced upon individual. Aft 
all, the pupil must learn to appreciate for himself. Any attem 
on the part of the teacher to force an expression of pleasu 
from the pupils will tend to defeat the aim and also to encou 
age hypocrisy. Such expressions should come naturally fro 
the pupils. Teachers commonly make the mistake of indulgi: 
in exaggerated expressions of their appreciation, in the hope 
hastening the process on the part of the pupils. Such cant 
quite readily detected even by young children, and its effect 
almost sure to be negative. The oversentimental artist di 
gusts many of us to such an extent that we draw ourselves aw: 
from the object of his admiration. This should be a lesson f 
the teacher. It is the sincere appreciation on his part, not ove 
drawn with words, but expressed modestly and, above all, liv 
in his actions, which is effective. 
Teacher must appreciate that which he would have pupi 
learn to appreciate. One of the greatest helps in teaching appr
-P-A-G-E-347
LESSON XXXVI 335 
  tion is a lively appreciation on the part of the teacher him- 
f. This cannot be feigned, for emotions are radiated not 
ough words but through observed emotions. An enthusiasm 
t is contagious may be detected in the voice, eyes, and pose 
the teacher who is deeply appreciative of that for which he is 
ing to develop appreciation. The teacher, for example, who 
not enter into a child’s poem with the children themselves 
andicapped to a great extent. He must, if he would improve, 
minate this defect by an effort on his part. If he does not 
ow paintings and something about the masters, he will find 
t extensive reading about them is likely to prove pleasurable 
well as profitable. All that we have said above concerning 
veloping appreciation is as applicable here as in the case of 
le pupils. 
Appreciation depends upon growth and nature of experience. 
terpretation and appreciation depend upon the fund of ex- 
rience that may be applied to a given situation. Imagine one 
0 was never outside of his home town"trying to read Rudyard 
ipling’s tales of British army life in the Orient. He could 
arn to pronounce the words, but they would lack the thrill and 
armth of meaning necessary to any true appreciation or evalu- 
ion of the scenes described. An individual who had served a 
sar in the National Guard would have a decided advantage in 
at he has experienced some of the general characteristics of 
e life of a soldier. One who had served one year with the 
ritish army in the Orient would reflect with a thrill or with 
~pression upon phrases meaningless to the guardsman. But to 
e British soldier who had served twenty years those phrases 
ould bring meanings as realistic as to Kipling himself. 
The reader may verify this. Recall your appreciation of some 
perience before and after its occurrence in your own life and 
ote its change in color. Those of us who have not yet experi- 
iced a given bitter incident do not know how to sympathize 
ith our neighbor who is undergoing it. The writer’s attention

was strongly drawn to this fact in observing the photopl

were laughing at the incidents as they occurred, youths w 
almost indifferent, and many old people were crying. The d 
ference in attitude came from the difference in experien 
Youth cannot fully understand age. 
Teacher must so organize process that pupils’ background 
experience is most effectively utilized. As in the case of develo} 
ing ideas, it is the work of the teacher in developing appreci 
tion to enhance the process of development. It is necessar 
then, in preparing for a class discussion the purpose of which 
to develop appreciation, for the teacher to formulate and o 
ganize such a battery of questions as will best bring in tl 
pupils’ past experiences. The questions should serve also to cz 
their attention to significant points which would otherwi 
escape them. These points may refer to form, for that also 
significant in interpretation. 
To quote Professor C. H. Judd?: 
The writer recalls with grateful appreciation the skill with which } 
college teacher of English literature gave him a lesson in literary inte 
pretation by compelling him to contrast two lines in Hamlet which we 
being read orally in class. In the fifth scene of the first act Haml 
replying to the Ghost’s injunction “Remember me,” says: 
Remember thee! 
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat 
In this distracted globe. Remember thee! 
Yea, from the table of my memory

The recurring exclamations “Remember thee!” had been read in t 
first instance with the same intonation. The instructor called attenti 
to the desirability of distinguishing the two phrases in the two cas 
Finally, the learner saw that the first ‘Remember thee” emphasized t 
word “remember,” the second the word “thee.” From that moment |

LESSON XXXVI 337 
effort to interpret all the lines of the drama was of a wholly different 
le. The teacher had taught discrimination. This discrimination was 
atter of form; but it reacted on content, and the content became 
ificant and illuminating from the moment the discrimination was 
rly made. 
  eacher should not attempt to develop appreciation beyond 
nt justified by pupil’s experience. It is necessary for the 
cher to be constantly on guard against attempts to develop 
reciation upon an insufficient background of experience. 
ch attempts will be as fruitless as attempts to develop 
ideas from an insufficient ideational background. The 
mentary-school pupil is about as incapable of fully appreciat- 
The Boys, by Holmes, as he is of solving a problem in 
lalytic geometry. Parts of each are entirely foreign to his 
perceptive background. As a rule the newer and better text- 
oks will have solved this problem partially as far as literary 
preciation is concerned. Even here, however, there is plenty 
room for thought on the part of the classroom teacher. Pupils 
different communities will vary widely in the kind and 
ount of experience obtained and hence will require varying 
ds and amounts of preparatory material. Compare the back- 
ound of experience of the average pupil of a New England 
port town with that of the average pupil of Columbus, Ohio, 
ir the study of Enoch Arden. Even the pupil who has visited 
e seashore has a decided advantage over one whose experience 
been limited to a river or a mill pond. Watching ships 
me and go, playing in sand on the beach, meeting coarse 
ilors on the streets, etc. are necessary units in the pupil’s 
uckground of experience for a full appreciation of this poem. 
Setting for appreciation should be prepared with care. The 
eparation of the setting for the appreciation lesson is very 
aportant and hence should be done with deliberation and care. 
1 the first place, the time of day is a factor. To attempt an 
ypreciation lesson just after the pupils have indulged in violent

338 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  exercise upon the playground or when mentally tired from p| 
longed attention in the classroom is to lessen the chances o 
successful outcome. The first hour after dinner, when 
pupil’s ability to respond is usually lowered by the work 
digestion, is likewise an undesirable time for an appreciat: 
lesson. The last hour on a Friday afternoon just before a fo 
ball game will find pupils generally too much stirred up to 
tend well to that which is to be appreciated. Owing to the f 
that pupils do not do well at purely intellectual tasks at th 
times, many teachers are likely to make the mistake of rese' 
ing these periods for appreciation lessons. Although somethi 
may be obtained at intellectual tasks, positive harm may 
done by attempting to develop appreciation when the mood 
the pupil is not suited to the task. If, as F. H. Hayward s 
gests, we are going to make appreciation lessons red-letter |

for this, only momentary preparation can be made, and no : 
tention can be paid to such matters as the time of day. T 
foregoing applies only to the lesson that is given over alm 
entirely to appreciation. 
An introductory comment, such as “This is considered 
artists to be one of the best paintings of the age in which it v 
produced,” or “This poem contains two of the most beauti 
lines in literature; try to discover them,” will often lend t 
needed immediate interest. A description of the circumstan: 
under which a poem was written will often serve to lend app 
ciation. Such an introduction might serve the purpose of prey 
ration for study of a poem, but a lesson in history might

Musk-rose. 
Well, how does he know these flowers ? 
Maybe by his feeling. 
Roy, what does that mean? 
It means that he can tell by the season. 
Yes, that is one way. May. 
I think he just sort of feels this, and he can smell the perfum 
Are there any words or phrases that suggest odors? 
“Sweet.” 
Yes, “sweet.” Is there anything else that might suggest it 
“Soft incense hangs upon the boughs.” That suggests tha 
canning is there. 
T. “Soft incense.” All right, are there any other expression 
that bring out the same idea near the last of the stanza, Helen? 
S. Well, “dewy wine,” it seems to me, would suggest the odo 
of flowers.
-P-A-G-E-355
LESSON XXXVI 
  'T. What sort of flower would that be? 
IS. Musk-rose. 
T. Can you associate odor with the violet, the musk-rose, and 
wthorn ? 
S. The violet has a very delicate odor; the musk-rose and haw- 
rn have rather heavy odors. 
S. He says in the last line that he hears “the murmurous haunt 
flies on summer eves.” Seldom does one read a description where 
le buzz of flies is agreeable, but this seems to be so. 
T. Do you suppose he means the ordinary flies, or does he mean 
sects in general ? 
S. Insects in general. 
S. Don’t you think in this whole stanza, perhaps, he is com- 
ring it to his own life? Perhaps he cannot see all these things, 
d yet he knows they are there. 
T. Yes, it may be. The next stanza. 
S. He is listening in the darkness. Many times he has longed 
r death and wanted death to come. It would be a joy for him, 
it he says all he can do is just sit there and listen to the bird’s 
nging. Death does not seem to come to him, and many times he 
s called death “soft names in many a muséd rhyme.” 
T. What does he mean by that line you quoted a minute ago? 
S. I think he is cherishing the hope that death will come soon, 
nd he calls it sweet names because he is longing to die. 
T. But where does he call it sweet names ? 
S. He calls it sweet names in his poetry. 
T. We read one line in which he called death sweet names and 
oft names. He says, ‘Now more than ever seems it rich to die.” 
le wants death to come to him upon the midnight with no pain. 
[e has not received that joy yet. He says death would now more 
nan ever be sweet because he has no pain and the nightingale’s 
ong makes it seem more wonderful. He says, “While thou art 
ouring forth thy soul abroad in such an ecstasy! Still wouldst 
nou sing, and I have ears in vain.” What does that mean? 
S. Well, he would be dead and he would be unable to hear this 
ong, and yet it would be there. 
T. Talk a little louder, please. 
S. The song of the nightingale would seem as if it was a 
uneral hymn.
-P-A-G-E-356
  344 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
T. Thoughts of his own death suggest what to him in regard 
the bird, Mary? 
S. Well, he says that the bird was not born for death. 
T. What does he mean by “immortal Bird”? 
S. The song of the bird had been heard for generations gone 
and it just compares his life to that. He knows he has not v 
long to live; and, well, it just suggests to him that the bird ha: 
longer life than he. 
T. Is it the bird itself or the song of the bird? 
S. Song of the bird. 
T. What picture is brought up here by “voice I hear,” etc. ? 
S. The song of the nightingale had been heard by all class 
of people in ancient days—‘“by emperor and clown.” He says 
was heard by the highest and the lowest classes of people. 
T. You had a suggestion, Helen. 
S. But I have forgotten it. 
S. I like the line where he says, “No hungry generations trez 
thee down.” There are many things that from generation | 
generation are lost, but it is not so with the song of the nightingal 
It lives through many generations. 
T. So, then, it is the song of the bird that is immortal, and tl 
song of the bird goes on from generation to generation. What pi 
tures are called to mind? 
S. He says that it may be “the self-same song that found a pat 
through the sad heart of Ruth, when sick for home.” 
S. It pictures Ruth in a foreign country. She is all alone amor 
strangers, and she is listening in the fields “amid the alien corn 
T. This is very poetical and very suggestive. What pictures a’ 
brought out in the next two or three lines? 
S. “The same that oft-times hath charm’d magic casements, ope! 
ing on the foam of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.” Perhay 
something like the evening as it did not refer to that nightingale. 
T. Anyone have another picture in mind? 
S. This gives a picture that is very expressive to poets, whic 
is of the cliffs overhanging the Mediterranean Sea, because it sa 
by the foaming sea. 
T. Since you have been over the death covered in the Jdyils | 
the King, is there any story connected with it in your mind? FE 
wants us to have a picture. All right.

  . Perhaps it is a little old castle with vines all over it, and 
haps his sweetheart has listened to the bird there, and the bird 
t connected his old romance with it. She has come here in the 
ht charm and is looking down, wishing for a prince to come and 
lease her. 
iT. This picture is “in faery lands forlorn.” What effect does 
word “forlorn” have upon the poet ?

lancholy. 
iT. Lucille. 
iS. It brings him back from imaginative things to earthly things. 
is far off with the flights of the song, and that word brings him 
ck to the trouble and cares of the earth. He says it “is like a 
1 to toll me back from thee to my sole self!” 
T. What does he say in the next two or three lines about fancy ? 
'S. He says that “fancy cannot cheat so well as she is famed to 
.” Although you think you can go with fancy, you are sure to be 
led back. 
T. Perhaps he refers to the fourth stanza. It is the dull brain 
t brings him back. What about the song of the bird? 
S. Well, he says that the song of the bird is getting farther 
ay, and it seems to him that the bird is going over a hill. 
T. Yes, I would like to have all of that—it is so expressive. 
e hears the song go farther away over the meadows, ‘over the 
ill stream, up the hill-side ; and now ’tis buried deep in the next 
ley-glades.”” What is the verb? 
S. “Is buried” is the verb in that line. 
T. When the poet comes to his mind he asks himself if it is “a 
sion, or a waking dream.” What answer would he like to give to 
at question, ‘Do I wake or sleep”? 
S. It has been so dark to him that perhaps he feels that he has 
en suddenly awakened. 
T. What characteristics of Keats are brought out in this poem ? 
hat would be your estimate of him? 
S. I think the song is very delicate and beautiful; most 
ople would like the song, but they would not have the words 
express it. 
T. I think the delicacy of it is one of its greatest charms. 
S. He brings beauty to everybody.

  T. Of course, that idea of beauty is one of his outstandi 
points. 
S. His selection of words and the peculiar way in which he u 
them. In fact, he uses words in places you would never think 
their being used. In that way he shows his love for color. 
T. Do you remember what he says about beauty ? 
S. He says that most of us do not recognize the beautiful thin; 
as they are generally merged into so much sadness. 
T. In fact, the saddest things of life are the most beautif 
There is the undercurrent of sadness. What does the word “mel 
choly ” suggest ? 
S. The word “melancholy” seems to mingle beauty and sadne: 
I think perhaps that it is through labor and the difficult things 
life that the beautiful and worth-while things are achieved. 
T. Has anyone else something to say about this poem? By t 
way, who is the most subjective poet ? 
S. What do you mean? 
T. The poet who puts his own feeling into his poems. 
S. Keats. 
T. Yes, he does express his own mood. Keats is probably r 
ferring to his own love affair in this poem. I think we shall n

One cannot improve quality of mental machinery. If one 
going to teach pupils to think, he must do it not through i 
proving the quality of the underlying machinery (the neu 
patterns) but through setting the machinery to work. There

of the thinking which the individual will do will depend, giv

in a large measure conducive to reflection.

  nce must be gained vicariously through reading. A part may 
attained through the exchange of experiences by classmates

me through direct contact with life’s situations. It is through 
r direct experience that we profit by that which is vicarious. 
e boy who has never played in the sand on a hot summer’s 
y lacks an important element in reflecting upon the problems

aningful only in so far as we, through our direct experience, 
n supply the needed elements: one, perhaps, taken from this 
uation, another from that, but brought to the book by the 
fader. 
Reflective thinking a habit. One who has supplied the pupils 
ith the materials of thought, that is, with the experiences nec- 
sary to reflecting, has still no assurance that the amount of 
flecting which they will do both in school and out will be 
aterially increased. A pupil may, in passing through the 
hools, absorb a vast deal of information but not acquire the 
ibit of turning it over in his mind. His reaction to this mate- 
al is purely on the level of recall. He does not weigh and 
msider. This condition, of course, may be owing in part to 
.e fact that his mentality is of low grade. It may, on the other 
ind, be owing entirely to a lack of proper training. School- 
om activity may have ceased on the information level, with 
1e result that the pupil never formed the habit of thinking. 
he teacher was satisfied when he got back on the quiz the facts 
hich he had previously taught. His attention was centered 
on subject matter rather than upon the pupils’ needs, with 
ie result that the pupils were hurried over a vast deal of 
yntent but did little reflecting upon it. 
Ideals of truth. There is still another outcome that must be 
otained if one is properly to lay the basis for effective thinking. 
he individual may do considerable reflecting but, not being 
aided by such ideals as modern science has developed, fall far

They have not learned to be objective in weighing evidence 
testing a premise. They are not willing to get the other fello

They should have been developed in the schoolroom. 
Getting pupils to think. Up to this point in the lesson 1 
have been discussing the background of experience which t 
individual must have if he is to do effective thinking. In t 
first place, he must have received from his environment a vé 
deal of experience, both direct and vicarious. This experien 
forms the materials which he rearranges during the process 
reflecting. Along with this he must have formed the habit 
reflective thinking and have developed such ideals of truth 
will cause him to leave his emotions out of the process. Fre 
this point on we will deal with the technique of causing t 
pupils to think in the classroom and of building up at the sar 
time habits of thinking and ideals of truth. 
Failure to give pupils concrete background of experien 
with which to think. As was said above, thinking is possik 
only in so far as one possesses a background of direct experien 
This fact offers an important suggestion for the classroc 
teacher. Too often the reactions of pupils are entirely on t 
verbal level. They have, for example, learned the metric tal 
of linear measure and are beginning the solution of problems 
terms of it. It is scarcely possible for them to determine 
advance what the approximate result should be. If they obta 
ten kilometers per hour as the average rate of an army on t 
march, they appear satisfied with the answer, much to t 
amazement of one who knows kilometers in terms of distan 
on the earth’s surface. Many pupils would make the sar 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
LESSON XXXVII 351 
  or in computing in terms of miles, again much to the amaze- 
nt of those who have walked miles with a knowledge of the 
tance and of the time. 
There is really nothing amazing about this. The pupils 
rely lack the background of experience with which to think. 
ry of us would make corresponding mistakes if dealing with 
loblems which outrun our experience. The pupil who thinks 
his neighboring state as a map on a given page of his geog- 
hy is one who has not traveled and mapped the region around 
is home, or has not transferred his experience in further geo- 
aphical study, or both. The effective reading of maps is an 
possibility for such a pupil. The Rocky Mountains as seen 
the map are meaningful only in so far as he has compared 
eir height and steepness to the hill which he knows and their 
ibstance to the rocks of the neighborhood. The teacher must 
er be aware of the possibilities of this lack of concrete back- 
ound and invent ways and means of supplying it. When 
lvancing to new concepts he must pave the way by marshaling 
ich elements of the pupils’ experience as can be brought to 
sar on the problems in hand. This will include using analogies, 
ferring the pupils to their former experience, giving the neces- 
iry previous experience, etc. All these factors must be at- 
nded to if the teacher is to form the proper apperceptive 
ackground for reflective thinking. 
Thinking should be done in situations akin to situation in 
hich pupils will be placed in life outside of school. Modern 
sychology teaches us that the transfer to another situation of 
1e training received in a previous situation will depend in part 
pon the presence of elements in the later situation which are 
lentical with those of the earlier situation. If, for example, 
ne has learned that 9 x 8 are 72, this bit of information or 
imulus-response ability is valuable only in a situation in which 
ne needs to know the product of 9 and 8; it is worthless on 
il other occasions. There are, of course, more general ele-
-P-A-G-E-364
352 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  ments or reactions which are not so limited in their possibili 
of transfer. These exist in the form of habits of generalizati 
and ideals. The pupil who learns to generalize his experien 
or develops ideals of truth through the study of science h 
developed abilities of the widest possible application. 
Two things at this point should be noted. In the first pla 
these more general elements should not be expected to transf 
unless they are developed with a conscious recognition by t 
pupil that their application is wider than the fields in whi 
they are being perfected. In the second place, one may expe 
transfer to weaken as one goes farther and farther from t 
situation in which the reaction was originally made. Neatne: 
in English composition might, if properly taught, be expected t 
improve the neatness of arithmetic papers. One would not e: 
pect it to improve to the same degree neatness in the matte 
of dress. 
The foregoing discussion offers suggestions on the matter « 
teaching pupils, through thinking in the classroom, to thin 
effectively outside of school. The elements to be transferre 
vary all the way from the most specific stimulus-response situ: 
tion to the most general. There is little question about tl 
specific responses which are valuable. To know 9 x 8 are 72 
perhaps needed by all. To know that Spalding is a village i 
Michigan is perhaps needed by none. As to the more gener: 
responses we are equally sure of their value but differ only o 
the method of attaining them. Can some of them be develope 
better in the study of mathematics than in the study of tk 
social sciences? If so, we still have to face the question as t 
whether or not the former is not so far removed from the situ 
tions we shall meet in life as to make the possibility of effectiy 
transfer less likely than in the case of the social sciences. Gran 
ing that one might, for example, develop in connection wit 
higher mathematics ideals of exactness of expression superior i 
quality to those developed in connection with history, it sti
-P-A-G-E-365
LESSON XXXVII 353 
  uld not follow that the exactness of expression developed in 
nection with mathematics would function more effectively 
a social situation than that developed in connection with 
tory. Most of us would be inclined to doubt it upon empiri- 
grounds. Our suggestion, then, is to train pupils to think in 
uations as nearly as possible akin to those in which they will 
called upon to think when they leave school. 
Thinking should be done in connection with live options. 
at which does not make any practical difference is not good 
terial for stimulating the average pupil to think. The use of 
le nonsense material that was placed in the older arithmetics is 
good example of this truth. The solution of its puzzles did 
mmand the efforts of the bright pupils, but it is a safe assump- 
m that the class as a whole did not take hold of the work with 
le satisfaction with which they would have taken hold of prob- 
s relating to their everyday lives. In the same manner prob- 
s of the city have not the appeal to the country boy or girl 
at problems relating to rural life have. The pupil should be 
lade to understand the significance of the problem that he is 
eparing to solve. This is true whether one is teaching arith- 
etic or history. To give purpose to a task lends it dignity with 
ildren as with adults. We like to feel that what we are doing 
of some consequence, at least that it is preparatory to some- 
ing else which is of some consequence. To study a problem 
r the sake of a grade or of pleasing the teacher is too trivial to 
ake the most effective appeal above the primary grades. 
Pupils should be put into challenging situations. Much of 
e schoolroom activity should have as its object the training of 
pils to think. The mere acquisition of facts is not enough 
d is generally of little or no value in itself. It is when we 
ilize those facts in adjusting ourselves effectively that they 
ve significance. But if we are ever to utilize them fully we 
ust learn to do so in the schoolroom. The teacher in preparing 
r lesson should ask herself, What questions can I prepare

If the pupils have reflected seriously upon a matter that 
worth while, the day is not lost, even though the lesson has 
been covered. 
Formalism of program often interferes with teaching pup| 
to think. Unless the teacher is careful in the organization of 
work, the program of procedure, demanding as it often does t 
the teacher be at a given page and chapter at a stated peri 
prevents a maximum of thinking by the pupils. The teache 
attention is centered upon the material and the orderliness aj 
rate of its presentation rather than upon its effect on the pup’ 
Although it is necessary from the point of view of school 
ministration to have programs and to cover certain materi 
during a stated period, the classroom teacher must be care 
not to let programs become ends. He must not become a sl. 
to the subject, but instead, as far as possible, let the ne 
of the pupils guide. No one needs more than the classro 
teacher to be constantly on the alert lest adherence to fo 
devitalize the worth of the procedure. The form itself is bu 
device for the furtherance of desirable outcomes and hence 
times should be pushed aside or modified. What is happeni 
to the pupils is, after all, our only concern. 
Indefiniteness on part of teachers interferes with thinki 
The teacher must, by preparing situations and asking go 
questions, cause the pupils to relate and compare. If he is 
do this, however, he must as a beginning teacher prepare a 
organize his questions carefully. Later he may with safe| 
formulate his questions as he proceeds. At all events the qu 
tions must be definite if they are to produce the best thinki 
by the pupils. The following are examples of indefinite qu 
tions: What do you observe about this specimen? What 
we know about Abraham Lincoln? The pupils must guess 
answering a question of this type. Their attention is n 
directed upon any definite point, and hence they are not bei

  LESSON XXXVII 355 
perly stimulated. Questions are often made indefinite by 
s in the teacher’s wording. For example, the teacher in 
stioning a class in geometry asks that the pupils compare 
tain angles, when he means triangles. This slip throws the 
ils into a state of confusion and breaks up the thought 
cesses, if any are started. The teacher who finds himself 
ling at this point should immediately set about schooling 
self to deliberateness. Haste is not conducive to good think- 
, and the teacher should not allow other considerations to 
erfere seriously with deliberation when teaching the pupils 
think. i 
uestions and problems are often indefinite because of the 
biguity of their wording or because words are used which 
e little or no meaning for the pupils. The following is a 
of ambiguous questions and problems: 
. If in mountain climbing one finds that since he left the base the 
perature has fallen 20 degrees, what is his approximate altitude if he 
an at 1000 feet above sea level? (It is not stated whether the de- 
es are Fahrenheit or Centigrade.) 
2. What is the capacity of a receptacle the diameter of which is 
feet and the height of which is 15 feet? (It is not stated whether the 
yacity is wanted in terms of cubic feet, or liquid or dry measure.) 
3. If he knew his forces were in bad condition, why did General Grant 
lay the attack? (There may be confusion as to whose forces are 
ant.) 
;. Compare the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi valleys. (The respect 
which they are to be compared should be mentioned.) 
In the following list of questions and problems indefiniteness 
mes from the use of words likely to be unfamiliar to members 
the class: 
What in your judgment is the most important criterion for deter- 
ning economic depression? (It would be necessary in many high- 
1001 classes to define the word criterion or substitute for the phrase 
riterion for determining” the more common phrase “means of 
asuring.””)

What in your judgment were the most salient features of Prem 
MacDonald’s introductory speech before the British Parliamer 
(Salient is not a commonly used word. Either its meaning should 
taught or a synonym should be used.) 
We are not suggesting that new words should not be int: 
duced into the vocabulary. On the contrary, the teacher shot 
make a conscious effort to increase the pupils’ understandi 
and use of words. He must be careful, however, in introduci 
them that they shall not obscure his meaning in asking qu 
tions or proposing problems for solution. Time will often 
saved by taking a few minutes from the class period to expl. 
the meaning of technical or otherwise unusual words. 
Leading and suggestive questions confuse thinking. Beg 
ning teachers often make the mistake of using leading and st 
gestive questions for the purpose of stimulating thought. T! 
form generally takes the thought-provoking qualities out of t 
questions. The following will serve as examples: 
Why was Napoleon a greater general than Cesar ? 
Why is the American form of government better than the Englis 
These questions tend to build up a conviction previous to’ 
flecting upon the problem. The pupil then begins marshali 
evidence for the purpose of defending that which he has ne\ 
carefully examined. The result is not only poor classroc 
thinking but the building up of mental habits that will handic 
the pupils in later life. 
Giving pupils time to reflect after asking question. It tak 
a certain amount of time for the pupils to get the significance 
a problem and bring their experience to bear upon it. T 
teacher who calls upon a pupil to answer immediately after t 
question is asked makes reflective thinking almost impossik 
Then, too, many of the pupils feel that the burden of thinking

There is little incentive to downright thinking.
-P-A-G-E-369
  LESSON XXXVII 357 
Attitude of teacher affects reflection. The teacher, to get the 
st results, should at least take the attitude of one thinking 
: his pupils. The question should be asked slowly and with 
arent deliberation. The teacher may ask the question in 
h a manner that the pupil feels that it is of little importance, 
rely a problem for pupils to think about. “I wonder,” with 
phasis upon “wonder,” will tend to have the effect of making 
eal problem out of the question. Of course, the teacher must 
a not to overwork this particular expression. One may, 
ending upon the question, substitute for it such expressions 
ae you see how?” “Do you think?” “Why?” “Do you 
the reason for?” 
Questions should grow naturally out of the discussion. The 
cher may have prepared the question in advance (the begin- 
ig teacher, we have said, should prepare at least the main 
es) ; but when asked, the question should not appear ready- 
ide. There should be sequence and naturalness about the 
estions. The student teacher may learn very quickly to ask 
od questions but be a long time in giving the sequence of his 
estions that grace of naturalness which does not call atten- 
n to the device itself. The questions and problems blend 
oothly into the fabric of the lesson. One of the most charac- 
‘istic things about the performance of beginning teachers is 
2 intellectual jerkiness that is caused by their questioning. 
ie following suggestions will aid in overcoming this defect: 
  t. Center questions round big topics. 
2. Carefully prepare main questions. 
3. Give pupils plenty of time for reaction. 
,. Call for many points of view upon one topic. 
Questions should not be closed too soon or with an air of 
ality. Many teachers make the mistake of drawing the dis- 
ssion to a close too soon and with an air of finality. If the 
dics selected for discussion are important—and they should
-P-A-G-E-370
358 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  be—the teacher can afford the time to get points of view fr 
many members of the class. The discussions by the pu 
should not be left in the fragmentary manner in which they 
have been contributed, but should be brought together by 1 
teacher and focused upon the problem. Otherwise the pup 
will get only the benefit of the individual discussions; they v 
not see the discussions functioning in their totality upon t 
problem at hand. 
With respect to the individual recitation, the pupil who 
the floor should be encouraged to continue until he has, if p 
sible, made a significant contribution to the discussion. T 
teacher whom I am observing as I write these lines has prepat 
very good questions but is making the mistake of not encouré 
ing pupils to carry on prolonged discussions. The pupil w 
raises his hand is given the floor at once or as soon as the pu 
who is reciting halts in his discussion. This method is havi 
a demoralizing effect upon an exceptionally good class. 
Timid pupils especially should be encouraged to take part 
discussions. The teacher is likely to forget, in the heat of ] 
activities, the timid pupil who does not volunteer. Such pupi 
when tested, often show that they have mastered the assig 
ment and would have made valuable contributions to the cla 
room discussion. When the timid pupil does recite or ta 
part in a discussion, the teacher must be careful to give h 
special encouragement and refrain from comments that tend 
belittle his contribution. If there are objections to his disct 
sion, other members of the class will detect them; or, if not, t 
teacher can point them out later. However, before this 
should have commented favorably upon the good points. T 
writer recalls the practice of a favorite teacher, W. S. Gray, w 
invariably commented on all the good points he could fi 
before presenting the defects. After a conference with Gray o 
felt at least able to do something. The problem of “drawi 
out” the timid pupil is a real one and will tax all the resour
-P-A-G-E-371
LESSON XXXVII 359 . 
t even the most experienced teacher can master. The fol- 
ing suggestions will be helpful: 
x. Observe the timid pupil’s expression after the question is presented 
call upon him when there is evidence that he is provoked into think- 
and has a contribution to make. 
2. Give dignified consideration to the pupil’s comments and discussion. 
3. Make favorable comment upon his successes. 
4. Assign special tasks, as reports, which will tend to give the pupil 
fidence in himself. 
5. Become acquainted with the pupil, getting him to talk about the 
ings of which he has special knowledge; his radio, for example. 
  Teacher should be nonpartisan in discussions and keep at all 
es the attitude of suspended judgment. One of the pitfalls 
the pathway of the beginning teacher is that of being dragged 
to an argument with one or more of the members of the class. 
ot only is this undignified, but it also tends to undermine 
cessary qualities of efficient thinking: unemotionally weigh- 
g evidence, holding suspended judgment, and willingness to 
arn the other man’s point of view. It tends to give an air 
f finality to the conclusions reached. One may reach conclu- 
ons on the basis of the evidence at hand and yet be very con- 
ious of the fact that his judgment may be wrong; that lack of 
| the evidence or a peculiar personal bias may color his think- 
g. So it is well to conclude with sentences beginning with such 
spressions as “It looks as if,” “Considering the evidence,” 
In our judgment.” These attitudes are necessary in life. 
The attitude of suspended judgment on the part of the pupils 
ill be considerably enhanced by such an attitude on the part of 
ie teacher. The teacher who is trying to get pupils to think 
10uld not pose as an authority but rather leave the impression 
f one who is himself struggling to settle the problem in hand, 
iving careful attention to all suggestions, immature as some 
f them may be. The attitude of respect for an honest effort 
ill do much to encourage thinking.

LESSON XXXVIII 
  im. To appreciate the question as a mental device and to 
become more efficient in the art of questioning. 
For the most part questions should challenge thought and 
tt mere memory. They should test the pupil’s knowledge in- 
ectly rather than directly. By testing his ability to use facts 
teacher can determine whether or not the pupil is in posses- 
nm of the facts. If the discussion provoked by the teacher’s 
estions indicates that a given pupil is not in possession of the 
ts, then the teacher may ask for a statement of the facts as 
en by the text or other sources which the pupils are supposed 
have studied. Futhermore, he can do this without making 
le class feel that his main object is to determine the extent 
which they have been dutiful in performing assigned tasks. 
e following represent factual questions on the Peninsular 
mpaign of the Civil War: 
1. Who led the Union army ? 
2. Who led the Confederate army ? 
3. How many men did McClellan have ? 
4. How many men did Lee have ? 
5. Describe the landing on the peninsula. 
6. How many days did the campaign last ? 
The following are examples of thought-provoking questions, 
hich will test the pupil’s knowledge of the facts through test- 
g his ability to use those facts: 
1. I wonder why McClellan decided to attack Richmond by way of 
le peninsula ? 
Many reasons will be given by the pupils for this decision, many of 
ich will be sound. Some will be faulty, because of inadequate knowl- 
lige of the facts. As these occur the teacher should call upon the class 
* 361  
-P-A-G-E-374
362 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
for the facts. If the class does not know the facts and they are not 
be found in the text, the teacher may supply then and there those need 
for going on with the solution of the problem. 
2. What do you think would have been the effect upon the war 
Richmond had been captured at this time ? 
This question will test many more facts which the pupils who ha 
studied well will have at their command. 
  Not only will the latter questions test the pupil’s knowled; 
of facts and his ability to utilize them, but they will emphasi: 
also the important points in the lesson. They focalize, a: 
hence help to organize, the various threads of thought into 
thought fabric. The pupils leave such a lesson with a few i 
portant thoughts in mind rather than with a mass of details th 
will soon drop out of memory. The details themselves, 
psychology tells us, are more likely to remain with us if us 
in some organization. The important facts are made to sta: 
out as they should; but they are supported by related detail 
facts, insignificant in themselves, but often weighty when ma’ 
a part of an organized group of facts. 
Questions should be prepared with a view to pupil’s exp 
rience. It must be remembered that the question which wi 
provoke thought in the mind of the teacher will not necessaril 
do so in the mind of the pupil. It will do so only in case t 
pupil’s experience is adequate. To ask why the football tea: 
did not win the game on the previous Saturday would be likel 
to result in much thoughtful discussion, but to ask why th 
word “Ideas” is capitalized in a reference to Plato would ver 
likely result in no discussion at all. On the other hand, th 
question should not be so simple as to provoke only disgust. ) T 
quote Foster, “The question must be real for the person t 
whom it is addressed.” 
Clearness as a criterion of a good question. It is a commo 
observation of those who make a practice of visiting classes the 
the teacher’s questions are often so ambiguous that a guessin 
ahr 
Tf
-P-A-G-E-375
LESSON XXXVIII 363 
  mtest ensues on the part of the pupils as to what the teacher 
nts. It is no easy matter to prepare questions so that they 
ll always be clear to the student, but much of the failure lies 
the fact that the teacher seldom makes any great effort to 
epare clear questions. While preparing these questions he 
st put himself at times in the place of the pupils, attempting 
discover reasons why the questions might prove ambiguous. 
rhaps he has used words that are not in the pupils’ vocabu- 
y. Maybe the antecedents of certain pronouns are indefinite. 
rhaps certain expressions which have clear and definite mean- 
lig for the teacher because of his momentary ideational back- 
ound will be perfectly meaningless when presented to the class 
the following day. Such directions as “Classify angles,” for 
ample, may mean for the teacher classification according to 
e size. The question is not complete until he states how he 
nts the angles classified. 
Questions are of three types. At this point the student 
acher’s attention should be directed to the fact that questions 
ay be divided into three types: factual, developmental, and 
ill questions. We have discussed the first two. The drill 
uestion, like the factual question, should not require delibera- 
on on the part of the pupil. Hence it is not as difficult to pre- 
are as is the thought-provoking question. After the teacher 
is determined the bond which he wishes to form, it is only a 
atter of asking the drill question frequently enough and at 
tervals properly timed. That is, the question should recur 
ntil the response can be made instantly. The distribution of 
me in giving it is an important consideration. Rather than 
sk question 1 over and over again, having different members 
f the class answer, it is better to insert questions 2, 3, 4, 5, 
7, etc. between 1 and its recurrence. 
Manner of presenting questions. We have discussed the prep- 
ration of the question; we are now to consider the manner of 
resenting it. Owing to the fact that many teachers have in
-P-A-G-E-376
364 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  mind the lesson rather than the needs of the pupils, questio 
are often asked in such a hasty manner that the words are 
properly enunciated and the pupils do not understand. Th 
too, the teacher may be in such a hurry to get to question 
that question 1 is neither fully discussed nor comprehended. 
The need for haste in presenting thought-provoking questio| 
is probably the result of failure to prepare the questions pr 
erly. If questions are organized with a view to leading t' 
thoughts of the pupils, fewer of them will be required than 
prepared merely for the purpose of testing the pupils’ knov 
edge of facts. The quality and inflections of the teacher’s voi 
are important. The question should be asked slowly and wi 
apparent deliberation. The pupils like to feel that the teacher 
thinking, too. The accenting of the question determines ina mez 
ure the extent to which it will provoke thinking. If in asking t 
question “I wonder why the battle of Saratoga is consider 
one of the decisive battles of history?” the teacher accents t 
word “why,” the question is more effective than otherwise. 
A bad habit formed by many teachers is that of repeating t 
pupil’s answer or replying to each answer with an “All righ 
Such a response by the teacher puts the pupil in the attitude 
one being questioned rather than that of one of a group whi 
is striving to discover new thought. The class should be « 
couraged to weigh what-is-said. The teacher’s confirmation 
rejection of the response as soon as it is made is often likely 
close the discussion. 
The following represents ineffectual and effectual methods 
questioning, as far as the stimulating of thought is concerned 
INEFFECTUAL METHOD 
Teacher. When was the battle of Antietam fought? Mary. 
Mary. September 17, 1862. 
T. Who was in command of the Union army? John. 
John. McClellan.
-P-A-G-E-377
  LESSON XXXVIII 365 
T. Who was in command of the Confederate army? James. 
James. Lee. 
T. Describe the battle. Robert. 
Robert. The battle began on September 16 with a heavy artillery 
el. While this was going on Hooker attacked Lee’s left wing. At 
mrise on the following day Hooker opened his cannon upon Lee’s left 
Inder Jackson. Hooker for a while pressed Jackson back, but Jackson 
ceived fresh troops and for a time it looked as though Hooker would 
le driven from his position. Hooker was wounded. Then Sumner 
rrossed the creek and threw his corps into the contest. The left and 
enter did not do anything until afternoon, when they attacked the 
memy. The battle was a draw, and Lee escaped across the Potomac 
luring the night. 
T. How many men were lost? Robert. 
Robert. McClellan lost 12,640 men, and Lee lost about 11,000 men. 
T. Did McClellan pursue Lee immediately? Grace. 
Grace. No. He waited five weeks. 
T. What did Lincoln think of this? Mildred. 
Mildred. Lincoln was impatient and wanted McClellan to follow Lee 
ip at once, but McClellan did not think himself ready. 
T. What happened to McClellan? Charles. \ 
Charles. McClellan was relieved of command on November 5. 
T. What event happened September 22? Edna. 
Edna. Lincoln issued his preliminary emancipation proclamation. 
T. What was this proclamation? Howard. 
Howard. It declared that the slaves in all the states or parts of states 
that were in rebellion against the government on the first of January, 
1863, should be forever free. 
EFFECTUAL METHOD 
Teacher. What in your judgment was the greatest weakness of 
McClellan as a general? Mary. 
Mary. His slowness in preparing for an attack. He wished to be so 
sure that nothing was wanting that he often lost opportunity to attack 
at the most favorable time. Had he followed up Lee immediately after 
the battle of Antietam he might have captured or destroyed Lee’s army. 
T. What were his strong points ? 
Mary. His plans were always perfectly laid. He was the safest gen- 
eral the North had in the sense that he was least likely to become 
trapped.
-P-A-G-E-378
366 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  T. Do you consider that this offset his weakness? Would you ha 
continued to use him as a leading general, had you been in Lincoln 
place? John. 
John. I don’t believe I would. He seemed to plan his campaigns 
though he were following a book of directions. Although it is true th: 
he was safe, he did not follow up his advantage because everything w 
not in perfect order. He did not seem to be willing to act upon t 
information that the enemy was even worse off than he. For exampl 
he must have known something of the condition of Lee’s army after tl 
battle of Antietam; yet because he was not perfectly organized an 
equipped he waited for five weeks, meantime giving the enemy tim 
to prepare. 
T. [James has raised his hand.] James. 
James. Lincoln had the people to satisfy, and McClellan ignored th 
impatience of the public. He had his ideals of a perfect campaign an 
refused to change. 
T. Then you would say that McClellan was a “paper” general; tha 
is, he could outline a campaign perfectly, but he failed upon the fiel 
of action. 
Pupils. Yes. 
T. Why did Lincoln wait until after the battle of Antietam to issu 
his preliminary emancipation proclamation? Robert. 
Robert. Lincoln wanted at heart to free the slaves but was afraid tha 
such a move might cause too many enemies in the North. Not every 
body in the North wanted the slaves free. Northern Democrats wer 
fighting only to save the Union. Hence Lincoln wanted some decisiv 
victory before issuing his proclamation. 
T. But Antietam was a drawn battle, was it not ? 
Robert. Yes, but it put an end to an attempted invasion of the Nortt 
and hence caused the people to take courage and have greater faith i 
the administration. 
T. What evidence have you that Lincoln did not act any too cav 
tiously in issuing the proclamation? Grace. 
Grace. A new Congress was elected about six weeks after the pre 
liminary proclamation, and the Democrats showed great gains. 
T. What advantages do you see in the freeing of the slaves at thi 
time? Mildred. 
Mildred. The South was getting much help from the negroes on th 
plantations; and, of course, this proclamation would tend to make th 
negroes disloyal and would also tend to demoralize the Southern people

any of whom would probably rather return to the Union than risk the 
ss of the slaves. 
T. Do you see any other advantage? Charles. 
Charles. Many European countries changed their attitude as soon as 
was found out that the North was fighting for the freedom of the 
aves. This was especially true in the case of England.

LESSON XXXIX 
Aim. To become efficient in teaching pupils how to study. 
  Teaching pupils to help themselves. Teachers, in their anx 
iety to forge ahead into the subject matter, often forget th 
needs of those whom they are instructing, Pupils should grad| 
ually be taught to help themselves. The pupil who has reache 
the high school and is unable to use a dictionary or Reader’ 
Guide properly, or who has no standards for the weighing o 
authority, or who reads at one half his possible rate, or wh« 
has no place-and-time study habits, is incapable of doing gooc 
work. Growth in initiative and self-confidence is impossible 
He may have amassed a great wealth of information from as 
signed readings, etc., but he has not learned to collect, weigh 
and consider evidence for himself. He has reached a giver 
destination but has not learned to walk. 
Although as an abstract principle the teaching of pupils t 
help themselves is one to which all would agree, the task o 
creating such teaching situations as will result in self-help i 
difficult, and only the master teacher can accomplish it in full 
However, the beginning teacher can do much. And with thi: 
in mind we shall attempt to make suggestions that will b 
profitable. 
Providing for proper physical background. In working ou 
Lesson XI the student teacher was asked to observe the physi 
cal condition of each pupil. The information gained at tha 
point should be of use here. It is difficult for a pupil suffer 
ing from adenoids to do his best intellectual work. Likewis 
the pupil who cannot see well or who has difficulty in hearin, 
will be at a disadvantage. Such pupils should be discovered an:

   LESSON XXXIX 369 
s far as possible should have their physical needs attended to. 
something incased within the body for safe-keeping and that 
e ideal student was one who neglected the case and at- 
nded to mental needs only. Modern psychology has brought 
light the error that lay in the background of such a concept 
f a human being. We react not as a mind in a case but as a 
nitary organism. We, as teachers, must therefore lay the basis 
r effective study by providing, if possible, the proper physical 
ackground. 
Holding pupils responsible for definiteassignments. Although, 
s we have suggested before in this text, assignments should 
ave opportunity for initiative, there should be a certain mini- 
um for which the pupil is held to strict accountability. Check 
lests that are easily graded should be given often, covering both 
ssignments and material developed in class. These tests have 
lhe advantage of holding the pupils to something definite. The 
eacher is often amazed by the ingenuity of the bright pupil who 
as not prepared his lesson and who intends to rely upon bluff- 
ng. In ordinary tests he can often so word his replies as to 
vade the point. A teacher reading such a pupil’s test paper 
annot always tell whether he knows the matter or not, but in 
mcertainty gives him at least a passing grade. If a pupil is 
eld to the response “true” or “false,” there will be less ques- 
ion in the mind of the teacher (allowing for a fifty-fifty chance 
y subtracting wrongs from rights for score) as to where 
he pupil stands. Under such conditions the pupils are forced 
o read carefully and conclude with a few things definitely 
astered. 
Assign problems rather than pages. The pupil who has a 
roblem to solve goes to his books with a definite purpose in 
ind—the solution of the problem. He is more likely to pass 
ightly over that which is not pertinent to the solution and to 
oncentrate upon that which is. The teacher should therefore it was a matter of common belief at one time that the mind was_— 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
370 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  make the assignment as a problem or series of problems. The 
should be discussed briefly by the teacher for the purpose of di 
veloping interest in them. A few well-chosen questions are us 
ful. The student teacher at this point should turn back to Less 
Plan (Form A), pp. 265-269, and study the lesson assignme 
with a view to its fitness for developing the ability to study. 
In class discussions hold pupils for significant points onl 
The teacher who lays stress in class upon irrelevant points 
doing much to unfit pupils for efficient study. The writer i 
listening to a recitation in history recently heard this questio| 
asked, “What were the names of the attorneys who defende 
the accused?” The pupils had not noted this fact, and t! 
teacher supplied the names. In discussing the recitation lat 
the teacher defended the question on the ground that thes 
attorneys later became famous men in American history. Ho 
ever, she had left the impression with the pupils that they ha 
failed on an important matter. Such emphasis is misplaced. 
Give proper rewards for successful study. The younger pupil 
especially need immediate rewards for effort. To let a pupi 
make an effective preparation and give him no opportunity t 
use that preparation or no credit for it is to neglect the law o 
effect in learning. Likewise, to give credit for prolonged an 
attenuated effort is to utilize the Jaw of effect in obtainin: 
something not wanted. Once in a while a pupil will be foun 
who will say, “I read my lesson over five times and I don’t se 
why I failed.” Such a pupil should be told that the trouble i 
probably owing to the fact that he did not really read it once 
that he merely read the words five times. On the other hand, h 
who gets the lesson with one or two readings should be warmlh 
complimented. 
Some class periods should be utilized as study periods. h 
case there are no supervised study periods the teacher can di 
something to improve methods of studying by utilizing a recita
-P-A-G-E-383
  LESSON XXXIX 371 
ion period or part of a recitation period now and then for the 
urpose of supervised study. Of course, such plans must first 
e accepted by the supervisor. During the period of study the 
sacher should announce a problem and have the pupils read 
ith its solution in mind. A short discussion of that which has 
een read will serve to show many where they have fallen short 
f efficiency in their reading. This is a good point at which to 
all pupils’ attention to the importance of the heading of the 
oe and also to the topic sentences to be found in each para- 
aph. It will be found that many pupils consider one sentence 
s important as another. They have not yet learned that the 
ppic sentence contains the gist of the thought and that the 
ther sentences have as their purpose the expansion or elabora- 
on of the topic sentence. 
The speed at which the pupils read during such periods of 
tudy may be increased by limiting the time. The writer in 
onducting reading classes for the purpose of increasing the rate 
as found it helpful in gauging the rate to watch the class as a 
hole and call upon them to close their books as soon as two 
hirds of them are through, at the same time asking all to speed 
p a little and suggesting how. Ask them to keep their atten- 
on upon the thoughts for which they are searching in problem 
plution. Drive for the main thought of a topic and read the 
est rapidly with the thought only of elaborating the main idea. 
essons of this sort conducted at intervals will be found very 
rofitable. 
In helping pupils, teach rather than tell. There is a vast 
ifference between telling and teaching. The pupil who comes 
the teacher for help is weakened by merely having his error 
ointed out to him or by being told point-blank the next step. 
he skillful teacher will ask questions that will lead the pupil 
o discover his error in procedure or the step that is to follow. 
he teacher must keep ever in mind the fact that he has a 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  372, OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
twofold duty: namely, that of increasing the pupil’s store o 
experience and that of developing habits leading to initiativ 
and self-reliance. By neglecting the latter we ultimately defea 
the former, and leave the pupil helpless when at graduation h 
is turned from the paternalistic atmosphere of the school int 
the merciless world of strife and competition. 
Call for programs of study. The teacher should ask no 
only that programs of study be prepared by each pupil bu 
that a duplicate be made. This will prevent a few from report 
ing falsely that they have such a program. The pupil is mor 
likely to follow a written program than one merely thought out 
The teacher should examine these programs carefully, so as t 
be able to suggest points of improvement. In doing this h 
will have to use caution in order to be sure that he is no 
revising a program already made out with the aid of the prin 
cipal. However, with this precaution in mind he should si 
down with the pupil and revise his program where advisable 
In a case in which a pupil is failing in his work it is ofte 
advisable to talk with the parents about the rigidity with whic 
he follows his program. Such discussions will often reveal glar 
ing discrepancies between the program for home study and th 
activities of the pupil. Parents will in general gladly assist it

Give list of directions for study. The following list of sug 
gestions for study, compiled by the writer, may be used: 
SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY 
A. Keepine Fit 
1. Get plenty of sleep. 
2. Take regular exercise. 
3. If previously you have been doing heavy manual labor, graduall: 
adjust yourself to the lighter diet of the student. 
4. Eat a light lunch if you expect to study or attend class during th 
early part of the afternoon.

LESSON XXXIX 
B. Maxtnc PuysicaAL ADJUSTMENTS FOR STUDY 
5. Make a program of work, giving time and place of study. 
6. Select as a place of study a comfortable room, one in which inter- 
ption will be least likely. 
7. Have study room well equipped with all the materials needed. 
ie room should be well lighted, heated, and ventilated. Pictures and 
her articles in the room should not be such as easily to lead the mind 
ay from studying. A baseball bat in the corner is sometimes too 
uch for a boy. 
8. If possible, study alone, that is, with nobody else in the room. 
here is no such thing as studying with others. 
g. Arrange program so as to study each lesson as soon as possible 
ter assignment is made. 
1o. If you can, study your lesson at two different times; that is, study it 
night and review it in the morning before going to class (F. M. Giles). 
11. Follow your program vigorously (use James’s laws in building up 
bits). 
12. When the study hour arrives, allow nothing to interfere with the 
siness at hand. If an unpleasant task is to be done, it is easy to find 
any other things that need doing badly. Do not let yourself be de- 
ived. Go to your study, sit down at your desk, and pick up your book 
pencil. The hardest part is over; studying will follow. 
  13. Be sure that you are physically ready to study. To have to inter- 
pt your work to adjust a window shade, get a drink, wash your hands, 
r sharpen a pencil often means the loss of the remainder of the study 
eriod. Getting ready, however, must not be so elaborate as to interfere 
vith suggestion 12. 
14. Be sure to wear glasses if you need them. 
15. Do not be afraid to take as relaxing a position as is compatible 
vith the work you are doing. Research by Dr. E. E. Jones justifies this 
tatement. 
16. Give friends due warning that certain hours belong to your study 
nd request them not to interrupt you. 
C. Maxine Attack upon LESSON 
17. Understand the lesson assignment. Learn to take notes on the 
uggestions given by the teacher when the lesson is assigned. Take down 
ccurately any references given by the teacher. Should a reference be
-P-A-G-E-386
374 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  of special importance, star it so that you may find it readily. Pick 
the important topics of the lesson before beginning your study. (T! 
University of Chicago High School.) 
18. Read over the lesson as a whole, then try to pick out the it 
portant points in each paragraph. A well-written paragraph has o 
topic. Do not try to learn everything in the lesson, but pick out t 
chief things and relate the minor topics to them. It is a good plan [wh 
using one’s own book] to underscore the most important sentence 
each paragraph. But don’t underscore four of five sentences. Too mu 
underscoring is worse than none. 
Then, having closed your book, try to give the most important fa 
about these topics aloud, or write out the material on paper. Do n 
open your book for help if you cannot recall a topic. Do the best y: 
can until you have been over the whole lesson. Then open your bo 
and see what you have failed to recall. (F. M. Giles.) 
19. When possible make practical applications of what you have learne 
20. In the proper use of a textbook the following devices will be hel, 
ful: index, appendix, footnotes, maps, illustrations, vocabulary. Lea 
to use your textbook, as doing so will help you to use other book 
Therefore understand the purpose of the devices named above and u: 
them freely. (The University of Chicago High School.) 
21. Carefully review and think over the previous lesson before b 
ginning the next (Hall-Quest). 
22. Connect important facts of the new lesson with the facts prev 
ously learned (Hall-Quest). 
23. Make comparisons and contrasts when possible (Hall-Quest). 
24. When you interrupt work, not only stop at a natural break bi 
also leave a cue for its quick resumption (Whipple). 
25. After intensive application, especially to new material, pause f 
a time and let your mind lie fallow before taking up anything el: 
(Whipple). 
26. Form the habit of working out your own concrete examples « 
all general rules and principles (Whipple). 
27. Do not hesitate to commit to memory verbatim such materials 
definitions of technical terms, formulas, dates and outlines, always pr 
vided, of course, that you also understand them (Whipple). 
28. Whenever your desire is to master material that is at all extensiv 
and complex, make an outline of it. If you also wish to retain th 
material, commit your outline to memory. (Whipple.)
-P-A-G-E-387
  LESSON XXXIX 375 
29. Take the mastery attitude. Do not let points go by you uncom- 
ehended. If in class, insist upon an explanation. You are not attend- 
ig school for your health. 
30. Study intensely while at it and then throw it all off your mind and 
t your recreation. It is easy to fall into the habit of dillydallying and 
ending hours where minutes will do. Remember, thoughts flow rapidly, 
d in general the rapid workers are the most accurate. 
31. Make up your mind that you cam learn. It has been found from 
perience that when people have the “will to learn” the mind will work 
uch more effectually. Do not say: “I can’t learn it. I am not in- 
rested in it.” When you take this attitude it is almost impossible to 
successful work. 
D. SuccESTIONS WITH SPECIAL APPLICATION TO MEMORY 
32. When the material to be learned by heart presents no obvious 
tional associations, it is perfectly legitimate to invent some artificial 
heme for learning and recalling it (Whipple). 
33. In committing to memory a poem, declamation, or oration, do not 
eak it up into parts but learn it as a whole. In finishing, however, one 
ould pay special attention to parts that offer difficulty. 
34. In committing to memory, it is better to read aloud than to read 
lently, and better to read rapidly than slowly (Whipple). 
35. If your work includes attendance at lectures, take a moderate 
ount of notes during the lectures, using a system of abbreviations, 
d rewrite these notes daily, amplified into a reasonably compendious 
tline (Whipple). 
Age and experience of pupils should be taken into account in 
reparing lists of suggestions for study. It is evident that such 
list of suggestions as the foregoing, if put in its entirety into 
e hands of even high-school pupils, would be confusing and of 
ttle use. It would be much more effective to introduce these 
ggestions in, say, groups of four, giving plenty of opportunity 
utilize one group of suggestions before introducing another. 
few of the suggestions in their present form would be useless 
grade-school pupils. When used in the lower grades they 
ould be translated by the teacher into terms and phrases that 
ill be more intelligible to the pupils. Other suggestions would
-P-A-G-E-388
  376 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
be useless in the lower grades even though put into the simples 
possible language before giving them to the pupil. 
Directions for study should take subject matter into accoun 
The teacher, in the preparation of suggestions for studyin; 
should consider the subject matter that is to be learned. A 
times this will necessitate a reorganization of the suggestions i 
terms of the subject taught. Suggestion 18, for example, wi 
have more bearing upon history than upon mathematic: 
whereas suggestion 27 will be more significant in the study « 
mathematics than of history. 
Suggestions for study should be given a few at a time an 
practiced as given. As is indicated above, it is wasted effol 
to hand out a list of suggestions for study without attendin 
further to the process of translating them into habits. In th 
first place, a long list of suggestions is confusing and formidab! 
to even the adult, and much more so to the child. The sugge: 
tions have been prepared in groups of four on the assumptio 
that four are enough to work on during any given period. Henc 
we would suggest that the teacher give out the directions fou 
at a time and make an effort subsequently to see that the 
function.

LESSON XL 
  Aim. To become efficient in developing initiative 
and responsibility. - 
Relation between initiative and ability. No amount of abilit 
to think or execute is of much value unless accompanied b! 
initiative. Too often we prepare for the first and neglect th 
latter. We assume that to know how will suffice, and at thi 
point we fail. To have the background of training for accom 
plishment is one thing; to have the initiative and drive tha 
make this background of value is quite another. And probabl 
one is about as much the result of training as is the other. It i 
no uncommon experience to find the oldest of a family posses: 
ing initiative and drive and the youngest, who was “babied, 
more or less a “baby” though an adult. There are principle 
behind the training for initiative as behind any other fort 
of training. These principles cannot be seriously violated fo 
any length of time without permanent injury to the individua 
In dealing with pupils we must keep ever in mind the matter c 
initiative. The reactions in this field are among the mo: 
fundamental. 
Lesson assignments should leave room for special contribu 
tions, which should receive considerable credit. In general th 
assignment should take the form of a series of problems wit 
accompanying suggestions for their solution. These suggestior 
should tend to arouse the pupil’s interest and carry him ove 
the most serious difficulties that he will encounter. Extr 
sources of material should be suggested, to which those whos 
time and inclination permit may go for further study. Tt 
pupil who does reading beyond that definitely assigned shoul 
378
-P-A-G-E-391
    
LESSON XL 379 
le asked to give the class the benefit of a report on it. Likewise 
e pupil who in proving a theorem in geometry shows a differ- 
t method from that found in the book should be given special 
portunity to present it before the class. He should be re- 
uested also to try to find new ways of demonstrating other 
roblems. Problems worked by the class, with the teacher call- 
g for suggestions from various members, will often start a 
upil on the road to action by giving him confidence in his 
bility to think. In other words, assignments should provide 
r initiative, and all evidence of it should result in reward for 
e pupils concerned. 
Some responsibility should be placed upon pupils in all 
trades. The amount of responsibility that can be placed upon 
upils at any given age will depend in part upon the training 
lhey have received and in part upon the seriousness of the task 
which they are engaged. In dealing with young children the 
onsequences of failure to assume responsibility are often too 
reat to justify placing the burden upon them. Then, too, the 
oung child is not likely to see the connection between his neg- 
ct and the result. Whenever he is given responsibility the result 
f his acceptance or failure to accept it should be clearly pointed 
ut to him and emphasized by appropriate rewards or penalties, 
s the case may be. Mary left her scissors at home; therefore 
he cannot help the rest in paper cutting. Johnnie forgot to get 
drink. This is not so easy to settle, as Johnnie may be very 
hirsty. To make him wait until school is dismissed would be 
little harsh and perhaps prevent Johnnie from doing his best 
vork. However, he should wait a while at least. The pupils 
ho did not forget should be complimented at the same time. 
f the lesson is well taught, Johnnie will have been placed on 
he road to assuming responsibility. Although great care should 
e taken not to overdo the matter of teaching responsibility in 
he lower grades, the teacher should have the problem in mind 
t all times.

380 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  The positive side is more effective than the negative in usi 
criticism for the purpose of getting initiative and responsibilit 
The dean of the undergraduate school of an American universi 
has recently adopted the system of commending by mail tho: 
who do work above a certain quality. Faculty and students a 
much pleased with the results. The student who does things 
as human as his brother who fails. Along with commendati 
for scholastic attainment pupils should be given responsibiliti 
of a monitorial nature and accorded the prestige that should 
with such work. These positions should be so distributed thi 
all pupils get an opportunity to develop. The practice of givi 
them entirely to the best pupils has the detrimental possibilit| 
of developing snobbishness at one extreme and a disrespect f 
social organization at the other. The bright boy who, becau: 
of a wrong attitude, is behind in his work may be the one w 
would profit most by being a monitor. Having succeeded in th 
work and having felt the thrill of being respected, he mig 
make efforts for scholastic attainment. It is not uncommo 
for a good teacher to “wake a pupil up” in one field and fin 
improvement in all that he is doing. 
As pupils become older, responsibility should increase an 
take on larger significance. Not only should the amount 
responsibility given older pupils be greater, but its qualit 
should improve. To keep the high-school boy sitting at hi 
work thirsty because he had neglected to get a drink would b 
unpedagogical and have entirely the wrong effect. His respons! 
bilities should be in keeping with the dignity that should accom 
pany his age. To be made responsible, not primarily to th 
teacher but to the student body, for a part in a play is ver 
effective in teaching responsibility. The pupil feels more keenl. 
under such circumstances the results of his neglect. In th 
first place, he has a personal interest in the project; and, in th 
second place, pressure exerted upon him by the group is fa 
more effective than anything that a mere teacher could possibl

ring to bear. It is a mistake in the upper grades and the high 
hool to make unimportant and formal demands upon a pupil, 
eglect of which is followed by what the pupil deems a punish- 
ent by the teacher. The pupil, under such circumstances, gets 
e wrong attitude toward the tasks required ; and little benefit, 
s far as developing responsibility is concerned, comes to him 
y fulfilling them. 
Punishment should, as far as possible, be a natural conse- 
uence of failure to accept responsibility. That the punishment 
lhould be such as naturally follows failure to accept responsibil- 
y becomes truer and truer as the child approaches maturity. 
he young child may not have the experience or the social 
levelopment which is necessary for having a guilty conscience. 
ence one cannot, in dealing with young children, look to this 
ntirely as a deterrent to neglect and a spur to the acceptance 
f responsibility. The ability to feel social pressure, however, 
should be built up as rapidly as possible and as rapidly as it is 
uilt up should be utilized for the purpose of developing the 
bility to assume responsibility. It may be necessary in dealing 
ith some young children to use teacher rather than social sanc- 
ion, even to the extent of using physical correction in the form 
of spanking (see page 75). 
Native ability a factor in background affecting extent to 
which a given pupil can take responsibility or assume initiative. 
In developing initiative or in training pupils for the acceptance 
of responsibility the teacher cannot neglect the factor of native 
capacity for reaction. One of the most discouraging character- 
istics of the mentally backward child is lack of capacity for 
feeling social approval or disapproval. In dealing with such 
pupils the teacher must act without one of the most powerful 
aids to which he has access in dealing with normal pupils. In 
dealing with brighter and more sensitive pupils, on the other 
hand, the teacher must be careful not to overwork social sanc- 
tion in obtaining the desired reactions. Although it is true that 
   
-P-A-G-E-394
382 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  the amount of initiative and responsibility which can be take} 
by a pupil will be limited by his native capacity and that the: 
will be periods of discouragement for the teacher, neverthele 
the teacher should attempt to have each pupil exercise thes 
qualities as rapidly as his ability will permit. He must n 
expect an equal amount from all. There will be those, even i 
high school, whose capacity for initiative and responsibilit 
will never rise above that of the average child of twelve year: 
For such a pupil ordinary social sanction will have much les| 
appeal than for the normal pupil of high-school age. He is 
problem and may have to be dealt with by tactics suitable to hi 
mental age. Such tactics are often obnoxious to the group i 
which he is found, and the teacher will have to go as lightly a 
possible in using them and still get results. Such situations ta: 
the teacher’s ingenuity to the utmost: 
Acceptance of responsibility and taking of initiative foundec 
upon background of habit. One builds up patterns of reactio1 
which result in the taking of initiative and the acceptance 0 
responsibility as one builds up other habits ; that is, through th 
laws of exercise and effect. One does not grow to maturity a: 
an irresponsible being and suddenly find himself fitted for a posi 
tion involving responsibility. Such Arabian Nights transforma 
tions do not occur except in motion-picture land. The habit o 
taking the initiative must be encouraged, and when it occurs it 
a desirable form it must have a satisfying effect upon the in 
dividual. The satisfying effect is very important if the individ 
ual is to repeat the reaction more times than chance woul 
account for. The teacher must make conscious effort to see tha 
the situation is right for encouraging initiative and that th 
proper rewards follow its occurrence. Often the pupil who suc 
ceeds, following a guide, is warmly praised, whereas the one whi 
fails after a desperate attempt ‘“‘on his own hook” is severel; 
criticized. In general such a pupil should not receive destruc 
tive criticism but rather commendation and encouragement

  Aim. To become as a teacher better able to develop in pupi 
the ability to execute. 
Teaching to execute constitutes large part of school progra 
There is a sense in which every reaction is an act of executio 
In Lesson XXXVII we discussed teaching pupils to thin 
The process of reflective thinking may be regarded as a proces 
of executing on the highest level. At the price of being somewh; 
illogical we discuss in this lesson executing as something entirel 
different from thinking. It is impossible to distinguish clear] 
on any basis between thinking and acting. However, this fac 
need not bother the student teacher, since in everyday speec! 
we speak of execution as action that can be observed. Ou 
material will include such subjects as reading, writing, funda 
. mentals of arithmetic, spelling, drawing, and manual training 
Of course, some or much reflective thinking may accompam 
the study of such a subject as arithmetic, but the primary pur 
pose of these subjects is to develop speed and accuracy of re 
action. Our problem is therefore different from that whic! 
primarily involves teaching the pupil to think. 
Correctness of procedure first consideration in teaching pupi 
to execute. The process of execution on its neural side is on 
of energy passing over neural patterns and resulting in corre 
sponding muscular activity. It is evident, then, that this patter 
must be laid correctly from the start. By being laid correct: 
we mean that it must produce the desired result when a stimulu 
is applied and do so with a minimum of neural track. If, a 
we have said before, the stimulus 9 x 8 is given, the response 7: 
should follow immediately and not after saying the nines y 
384
-P-A-G-E-397
LESSON XLI 385 
  9 X 8. In other words, the patterns must be so laid that 
e proper stimulus met in the complex of a life situation will 
roduce the desired response with a minimum of effort. The 
acher then’ will do well to look first to the correctness of the 
rm, which can rarely be too strongly insisted upon (see 
age 315). 
Proper drill second consideration in teaching pupils to 
ecute. If the energy is to pass with accuracy over the given 
eural track which is most desirable in a given situation, that 
rack, when once accurately selected, must be exercised in such 
manner as thoroughly to break down synaptic resistance, 
lowing the energy discharged by the stimulus to function un- 
ampered in producing the proper reaction. This will call for 
onsiderable exercise of the patterns after they are laid. It will 
Iso demand their exercise under varying conditions, to assure 
hat the functioning of the pattern is conditioned as little as 
ossible upon the setting of the stimulus. In other words, a 
upil should be able to use, say, his arithmetic in the complex 
f a life situation beyond the walls of the schoolhouse. To 
ssure this transfer of training he must have exercised the estab- 
ished patterns in many situations similar to those in which he 
is expected to use them later. The pattern exercised in a well- 
arried-out project will be better prepared to function in a 
ife situation than will a pattern exercised under formal and 
maginary conditions. However, when exercising a reaction 
attern largely under project conditions, one must be careful 
hat the exercise is sufficient. 
Will to accomplish important in developing ability to execute. 
The pupil should have some motive for exercising a given pat- 
tern while engaged in the activity. Studies in educational 
psychology point clearly to the fact that the will to learn is an 
important function in learning anything. Even drill of the most 
mechanical sort, such as learning the multiplication tables, 
should be supplied with a motive. The obtaining of genuine
-P-A-G-E-398
  386 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
motives will often tax the ingenuity of the teacher, but he mus’ 
if possible, provide the pupils with them. Contests, prizes, 
pleased teacher, need for use, are among the many possib 
motives. Negative motives, such as punishments, are muc| 
less effective and are undesirable from other points of view. 
See that pupils center attention upon outcome in exercisin 
complex pattern of reaction. Although, as was said above, on 
must be assured if possible of perfect form from the beginnin| 
(that is, the pattern which is being established must be perfe 
with respect to the units involved), the units should be broug 
into harmonious relation with one another through the exercis| 
of the pattern with the attention centered upon the outcom 
In spelling, for example, one learns to spell the entire word a 
a word rather than as a series of syllables. One should lear: 
also to write a word as a word rather than as a group of co! 
nected letters. In reading one should focus attention upo: 
significant phrases taken in at a glance. In learning to hit 
baseball so as to drive it into a given part of the field, one doe 
best by centering attention upon the part of the field into whicl 
he is to make the drive and accompanying this attention by 
seeing the process as a unit. The point is that one should gen 
erally keep the end in view during the process of exercising th 
neural pattern. 
Elements of complex pattern of reaction should be develope< 
in connection with largest unity possible without going beyon¢ 
pupil’s ability to execute readily. There is a point beyond whict 
one should not drill upon the elemental units of a reaction 
but throw them into the higher unit of which they are to forn 
a part, and drill upon them in this connection. The questior 
that arises here concerns the size of the pattern which is t¢ 
constitute the unit of reaction. This point need not concern th 
teacher very much, for it is determined by the responses tha’ 
we must make to situations as they appear in life. In basebal 
one goes through a unitary complex of hitting the ball, and ther

rough another unitary process of running to first base. The 
vision between the two is a natural one and is not likely to be 
erlooked. The following words of O’Shea are well to the 
int here: 
  As in linguistic symbols isolated letters have no value, so in vocal 
lusic the individual note is practically without significance. But if the 
vice be led at the outset to execute notes in isolation, giving them 
stinct individuality, they will come to occupy a more or less independ- 
it place in consciousness. This simple law is familiar to all capable 
achers of reading. The child who early is made to learn isolated 
tters tends to acquire a set in the direction of giving them independent 
lue, with the result that in his linguistic training he is likely to be 
ndicapped in the effective use of words in the gaining of ideas. At the 
me time, when the pupil is first introduced to reading, he must often 
al with separate words, because sentences may be too complex for 
sady comprehension. But he is not permitted to dwell upon the indi- 
idual words until they get a prominence which they will tend to keep 
ter on, when they really ought to lose their individuality. In the con- 
iousness of a good reader, ninety-nine out of every one hundred words 
re simply dimly apprehended elements of some larger linguistic unity.t 
May be necessary to select limited portion of neural pattern 
nd exercise it individually. As in learning a poem by the 
1ethod of wholes rather than parts it is often necessary in 
nishing the work to give a little individual attention to some 
ifficult part, so in learning to execute a complex pattern of 
eaction it may often be necessary to drill separately upon some 
lement. Such special drill should be done separately from the 
egular performance in which the total pattern is used. For 
xample, phonetic drill should be conducted apart from the 
eading class. These unitary elements must not be neglected in 
xercising the total process. They must function perfectly if 
he more complex pattern is to function perfectly. The imper- 
ectly made letter detracts from the product of handwriting;

  and, although one should develop his handwriting mainl. 
through written expression, it is often helpful to go back an 
drill upon a given letter individually. However, as we ha’ 
said above, the bulk of the drill should come in pattern units o 
a higher order. 
Some elements should be drilled in connection with mam 
pattern units. In learning to write, for example, the patter 
elements involved in making “o” as found in “boy,” “not, 
“on,” etc. are different. The making of the letter ‘“‘o” mus 
therefore be drilled upon in the various type situations. Th 
neatness reaction should accompany many reactions, such a 
writing, figuring, making a bed, etc. To be assured of this, w 
have reason to believe that it will not suffice to drill for it i 
connection with, say, handwriting only. In dealing with thos 
unitary reactions that are themselves a part of many larger pat 
terns it is not enough thoroughly to drill upon the element 
pattern in connection with one encompassing pattern but i: 
connection with several. In fact, it is necessary to drill upo: 
the elemental pattern in connection with every pattern in whic 
it is to be expected to function as an integral part; that is 
with bonds between it and the elements which with it form th 
pattern unit. 
Technique should be developed as means to an end, not a 
an end in itself. To keep the pupils for a long time exercisin; 
patterns for the improvement of technique and at the same tim 
to give them no opportunity to utilize those patterns in the pro 
duction of the end for which they are being developed, produce 
a waning in the pupils’ interest. The boy who is learning t 
play the violin is greatly encouraged and is given motive fo 
further practice if he is allowed to play simple pieces. He i 
thereby made to feel at all times the purpose of the practice 
It is not uncommon to see the novice for whom musical tech 
nique is an end and justification in itself. The teacher there 
fore should see to it that the pupil’s practice of technique i

  ‘operly motivated. This can be done, not through assurances 
at some day he will use it, but as far as possible through 
ily use of it in producing something desired. 
Distribution of exercise of neural patterns must conform to 
ws of economy in learning. Although experimental data on 
e question of the proper distribution of time in the process of 
ectively laying any given pattern are still lacking, we can 
ake certain general suggestions that should be helpful in guid- 
the beginning teacher. In the first place, exercise should 
ntinue long enough to overcome the initial drag of inertia 
hich accompanies the change from one form of exercise to 
mother. A certain warming-up period is required, during which 
e mental and physical phases of the organism are being re- 
djusted to the new activity. For example, one who has been 
mgaged in strenuous physical activity will need a few minutes 
lor readjustment before attempting the finer codrdinations used 
in handwriting. After these finer codrdinations are attempted 
It will be some time before the organism is entirely adjusted to 
he new activity. And this will be true regardless of whether 
me begins handwriting after playing baseball or after reading 
istory. Hence there is the warming-up period, the length of 
ime for which will probably vary with the type of pattern to be 
rilled upon. This required period should be taken into ac- 
ount in determining the minimum amount of time given to any 
drill period. The experimental evidence that is necessary for 
determining this period for the various subjects is not at hand; 
hence we can only caution the teacher in a general way to 
allow for it. 
There is, on the other hand, a point beyond which diminishing 
returns make drill at any given period unprofitable, considering 
the time and effort involved. Again the teacher will have to 
determine this point by signs of fatigue, such as the thoughtless 
doing of the task at hand or nervous reactions. The whole prob- 
lem of spaced learning with respect to drill enters at this point.  
-P-A-G-E-402
  390 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
How much time should elapse between periods of exercise mi: 
also be asked. Again all we can say is that there should 
every sign that the pupils are fully recuperated. The teac 
should observe for these signs, which are about the only gui 
that we can offer him at present. Some day, we hope, edu 
tional science will be able to direct him with precision.

im. To become able to measure the progress of pupils by 
means of standardized tests. 
The student will carry out this lesson by obtaining the avail- 
ble tests in his subject and selecting, with the aid of the critic 
leacher, the test or tests to be given. A booklet, “Bibliography 
f Tests for Use in Schools,” may be obtained for ten cents from 
lhe World Book Company, Yonkers-on-Hudson, New York. 
his booklet contains a classified list of the tests available for 
ach subject, together with the name of the publisher. Wher- 
ver possible, diagnostic tests should be used. The results of 
uch tests serve to locate the causes of failure as well as the fact 
hat failure exists. Hence diagnostic tests are more popular 
ith teachers than other kinds and represent the type that will 
used most frequently when the student takes charge of his 
wn classroom later. To illustrate, Freeman’s Chart for Diag- 
osing Faults in Handwriting is diagnostic, whereas Ayres’s 
easuring Scale for Handwriting is nondiagnostic or adminis- 
rative in character. Hence, if handwriting is under considera- 
ion, the Freeman scale will be preferable as a teacher’s choice 
o that of Ayres. Having given the Freeman handwriting 
scale, the teacher knows not only that the pupil’s grade corre- 
sponds, let us say, to 60 on the Ayres scale but, further, why it 
s at 60. Perhaps it is largely a matter of letter slant or of 
letter formation. If so, he may proceed intelligently in the 
natter of correcting the difficulty. 
Giving the test. The student should make thorough prepara- 
tion for the test before attempting to give it to the pupils. This 
is a very important consideration, for a standardized test must 
391
-P-A-G-E-404
392 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  be given under stated conditions if the results are to be us 
in measuring progress. It is a good plan to give the test befor 
hand to one’s roommate or neighbor. If this is not practicabl 
give it in anticipation in one’s study. Two or three repe' 
tions should suffice. In general, the test should not be ai 
nounced before the hour of giving it, as previous notice caus 
unnecessary tension on the part of most classes. 
Utilization of test results. The test results must be studi 
with considerable care if the student is to obtain a maximum 
information relative to individual and class needs. The fo 
lowing steps should be taken: 
1. Compute median, or mean. 
2. Compute deviation. 
3. Compare results with test standard. 
4. Make a graph showing individual results. 
5. Formulate plans for overcoming the weakness that the te: 
reveals. 
6. Submit the results and plans to the critic teacher for su 
gestions as to further study and possible remedial measures.

LESSON XLIII 
im. To understand the problems of examining and grading 
and to develop criteria for preparing effective examinations 
and for grading intelligently. 
  Examinations serve to tone up class. Although it should be 
eld as an ideal that pupils work for tt 2 subject itself and 
verything should be done to bring about this attitude on their 
art, the truth is that classes as we find them need to be spurred 
m by an occasional test. The teacher whose pupils seem indif- 
erent will often find that the use of a test is stimulating. Pupils 
ike the tangible evidence which an examination gives that 
omething-has been accomplished. And even if it may be true 
hat the real outcomes are not tested, as in the case of apprecia- 
tions and attitudes, nevertheless the fact that the pupil has dis- 
covered that he can answer certain questions and will be held 
in the future for others serves to give him courage and a goal. 
Examinations serve as a spur to the lazy pupil and as a source 
of satisfaction to the worker. Experienced teachers know the 
Janger of letting a class go for weeks without a test. 
Examinations should, in general, be frequent and of short 
juration. The ten-minute written exercise or oral quiz given 
with considerable frequency is to be preferred to the traditional 
nour-long test given at certain specified times. We are not 
eferring here to the term or semester examinations. Those 
ure certainly necessary for the best results especially under 
1onproject conditions. The scheduled examination periods 
end to cause the pupils to let down in their work until just 
sefore the test and then to cram. The result of such procedure 
s demoralizing to the class. 
393 
 
-P-A-G-E-406
  394 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
Short examination should, in general, have no set time limi 
Notwithstanding that we have used the term “ten-minute exe 
cise” above, ten minutes is not always a desirable length 
time for the written exercise. Much depends upon the natur| 
of the problem. It is better to set only an approximate tim 
limit, say about ten minutes or about fifteen minutes, and the 
observe the progress of the pupils as a means of determinin 
just when to call for the papers. When about three fourths o 
the class are through, the direction ‘Finish as soon as you cai 
now” will generally be all that is necessary for a rapid con| 
clusion of the examination. If one or two lag unduly, the c 
as a whole may be told to turn in the papers. 
To avoid waste of time, pupils when through in advance o 
the class should be encouraged to take up other work. It i: 
better to do this than to force unduly a part of the class 
especially if the test requires considerable organization of mate 
rials. It is not true that the best papers come in first, althougl 
this is frequently the case. The writer recalls a university 
student who required about double the time of the averag 
members of the class in which to prepare his paper. But thi 
student did not waste a moment of time. His examination 
were perfect in thought and organization. The setting of a1 
arbitrary time limit may take all the value out of a test fo 
such a student. In giving tests on the information level, how 
ever, the problem is different, as the test partakes of the natur 
of drill, and here speed is one of the most important elements 
It becomes one of the most important criteria of knowledge. 
Tests generally should not be announced. The announcing o 
tests tends, in the first place, to encourage cramming and loaf 
ing instead of a constant-mastery attitude. If the tests ar 
given unannounced and at irregular intervals, pupils soon lear 
to be prepared at all times by mastering the subject as they - 
Hence pupils should learn to expect tests at any time. In th 
second place, many nervous pupils are often unduly “keye

    pp” by the announcement of a test. It often happens that the 
upils who have the least cause for worry are just the ones to 
e most affected. This, of course, is a very undesirable condi- 
on and one of the strong cbjections to the announcing of tests. 
Examination outcomes. In general there are two examination 
utcomes, either or both of which may be sought by the one 
reparing the questions. He may make the examination a 
atter of merely testing the memory of the pupils by having 
lhem give back facts learned, or he may make it of more value 
lo the pupils by using it as an opportunity to organize and 
tilize the facts already mastered. The later form of examina- 
fen tests indirectly the pupil’s knowledge of the facts) The 
ifference between the two types of tests was well brought out 
n a discussion that followed the introduction of the examina- 
ion system into Purdue University. A study made by Dr. 
tanley Coulter had shown that the giving of mid-semester 
xaminations a few weeks previously had not materially changed 
he rating of pupils by the instructors. After the announcement 
f the fact a member of the faculty of the university asked why, 
hen, waste the paper and the students’ time. Dr. Coulter’s 
eply was to the effect that all depended upon the nature of the 
xamination. An examination that did not offer the student 
an opportunity to organize the semester’s work and that did not 
stimulate him to intellectual effort was perhaps a waste of time. 
There are occasions, however, when the teacher wishes to be 
sure that the pupils have a certain background of factual in- 
formation, and he does not wish to go through the roundabout 
method of testing facts through ability to organize and utilize 
them. 
Use of check tests. Although a knowledge of facts and the 
acquirement of elementary skills are not in themselves objec- 
tives but rather means to ends, it is necessary that they reach a 
minimum level of perfection in order that they may function in 
larger and more significant settings. Hence the teacher should 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
396 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
sound out from time to time the extent to which they have bee: 
mastered. For this purpose the check test (see page 172) is 0} 
utmost importance. With it the teacher can determine with 
minimum of effort both on his part and on the part of the pupil 
just what have been the factual and skilled accomplishments. 
Preparation of check tests. Of the three types of check 
test questions (“‘true-false,” multiple-choice, and incomplete 
sentence), the “true-false,” although generally the most used. 
is the most difficult to prepare. It is often impossible to sa 
without qualification that a statement is either true or false] 
And it is often unwise to put such a label upon a statement, 
though it is made by the author of the text pes used. The 
teacher may say, “John Smith says so-and-so.” This, in cases 
in which the truth is doubtful, is the most desirable thing to 
do. It is often difficult also to so word the statements that 
there can be no doubt as to their meaning. The writer has 
had the experience many times of preparing “‘true-false” ques- 
tions that he thought could be answered as either true or false 
without any possibility of evasion, only to find that the class 
found plenty of opportunity to use the word “if.” Hence the 
questions must be prepared with great care. 
In general, check tests should not be announced. A large part 
of their value as an educational instrument lies in the fact that 
they hold the student accountable for the major facts of every 
lesson. It is for this reason, also, that they should be applied 
to all phases of instruction. It is very effective to insert state- 
ments dealing with material given by the teacher on the previous 
day or with an article given as outside reading. The pupil who 
wishes to stand high must attend to what is going on in class, 
to outside reading, etc. Of course he will discover the results 
of his negligence in the final examination, anyway. But the 
point is, this is too late; the short written exercise or the check 
. test, if given from the beginning of the course, will stimulate 
from the first. 
 
-P-A-G-E-409
LESSON XLIII 307 
In preparing “‘true-false” tests the teacher should avoid in 
e long run an excess of true or false statements. If the pupils 
liscover that the teacher prepares many more true than false 
tatements, they will tend to take advantage of the fact and 
ence increase their score by increasing the chance of a correct 
uess where information is lacking. 
Number of statements should be few. The attempt to get a 
long list of statements for the purpose of check testing leads to 
any badly prepared statements. Ease of grading demands 
hat the number be such that the results can easily be tran- 
cribed to the scale of one hundred. All things considered, the 
eacher will find ten questions the most desirable. The pupils 
an be graded on the scale of ten for check tests throughout the 
erm, and then the average or median can be transferred to the 
ase of one hundred in getting the final grade. 
William A. McCall? gives the following suggestions for mak- 
ing “true-false”’ tests:     
      
   
        
       
  1. Have approximately the same number of true and false statements 
ind have them arranged in chance order. 
2. Avoid ambiguous statements. 
3. Avoid suggestive statements. 
4. Avoid trivial statements lest they induce wrong habits of study. 
5. Avoid use of negatives. 
6. Make the statements brief. 
7. See that one statement does not answer a preceding one. 
Giving check tests. In general, the check tests should-not_be. 
announced. On the contrary, the pupils should be made to feel 
that they are held responsible at all times for what is going on 
in class and for assignments. 
It is desirable to use ruled paper of uniform size. This will 
enable the teacher to correct the work by placing a key paper 
along the side of the one to be corrected. In this way the speed 
1How to Measure in Education, p. 126. The Macmillan Company. Re- 
printed by permission. 
 
-P-A-G-E-410
398 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
of correcting can be more than doubled. Cheap tablet paper'| 
cut into narrow strips serves very well. The pupils should be 
asked to number the lines, beginning at the top, from one to 
ten, if ten questions are given; after this the teacher will 
proceed to read the statements, the pupils writing “true” or 
“false” or + and - to indicate the correctness or incorrect- 
ness of the result. Tne statements should be read slowly and 
distinctly. A second reading of the statements should follow 
immediately. This time they should be read more rapidly. Not 
more than fifteen minutes should be consumed in giving a set 
of ten questions. ‘the pupils should be so trained that when 
the last question is read in the second reading they will begin at 
once to pass the papers forward in some orderly manner. If 
the scheme of passing in papers is well worked out, the teacher 
may take up the class work immediately after the reading of 
the last question. 
Scoring and utilizing results of check tests. If the tests have 
been given with a view to ease of grading, the results of even a 
large class can be scored in a few minutes. The papers should 
without fail be returned with the grade at the next meeting of 
the class. The average, or median, score should be computed 
and placed upon the board as the papers are being returned. 
The writer has found it desirable to have each pupil keep a 
graph of his grades and that of the average, or median, class 
grade. 
The pupil who knows nothing about the subject matter on 
which he is being tested, but merely guesses at the truth or 
falsity of the statements in a well-constructed “true-false” test, 
will, on the average, get half of them right. One can eliminate 
this factor of choice by scoring rights minus wrongs. That is, 
if on a test of ten questions the pupil should by means of guess 
get only five right, the score rights minus wrongs (5—5) will 
equal zero, or his knowledge of the subject as shown by the 
test. However, the purpose of ranking the pupils can be served
-P-A-G-E-411
  LESSON XLIII 399 
ust as well by grading the pupils on the number right, ignoring 
he question of guessing, for pupil-grading should be largely a 
elative matter. But this latter.method has educational draw- 
jacks. The pupil who finds that by guessing he can average 
© per cent right, and by general knowledge or a little study 
nswer two questions with assurance of tueir correctness, thus 
aising his grade to 70, is encouraged thereby in his indolence. 
nm the other hand, if the pupil finds that guessing brings him an 
werage grade of zero with an occasional negative grade, he 
otes that the gulf between him and the bcst.members of the 
lass is very large, and he is thereby stimulated to effort. 
Essay tests. The check tests should be accompanied by tests 
f the essay type, so that the pupils may have the experience of 
rganizing the material. Not all essay tests should consume 
all the period. Many of them should take no longer than the 
check test and, like the check test, should generally be un- 
announced. The pupils should learn to expect such a test on 
any phase of their class activity, such as assigned readings, 
classroom lectures, and class discussions. 
Distribution of grades. Two sets of criteria determine the 
grades givenaclass. In the first place, the grade is determined, 
aided or unaided by established norms or standards, by the 
instructor’s judgment of the absolute accomplishment. In the 
second place, the grade is determined by the relative accom- 
plishment of the pupil as compared with that of the other 
members of the class. In general it is easier and safer to follow 
rather largely the second criterion. As teachers we are inclined 
to rationalize to the effect that ours is an exceptional class. We 
all feel a distinct pressure bearing upon us from without, in- 
sisting that we grade higher than our judgment warrants. This 
pressure is placed upon us by both pupils and parents. We do 
not like to disappoint others, especially when we know they 
have worked long and arduously. Combined with the error in 
grading likely to arise from this source is our tendency to recall
-P-A-G-E-412
400 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
  the good recitations and neglect the failures. This is because wi 
are interested in those under our charge. There is no teache 
worth while who will not take this attitude toward the class 
However, this very human trait does not tend to accurate grad 
ing. It must be counteracted for this purpose by following ou 
a principle of distribution known as the “Normal Curve.” 
Following the Normal Curve of distribution will be accurate 
enough for the purpose of grading in the lower grades, but be-| 
cause of the selection of the student body it will scarcely do for| 
grades of high-school or college level (see Lesson XIII, p. 110). 
It is very probable here that a more just principle of distribu- 
tion would be that. represented by the upper half of the curve. 
That is, for the purposes of elementary schools, grades may be 
distributed according to the principle of the Normal Curve of 
distribution approximately as follows: A’s, 7 per cent; B’s, 18 
per cent ; C’s, 50 per cent ; D’s, 18 per cent; and F’s, 7 per cent. 
Using the upper half of the curve for purposes of high-school 
and college grading would give on this basis: A’s, 14 per cent; 
B’s, 36 per cent; and C’s, 50 per cent. Such a use of the curve 
makes no allowance for failures. These, of course, will be taken 
from the C group if any occur, thus lowering the percentage of 
C’s. Failures should be few in courses well adapted to the age 
and needs of the pupils.

the work of the other in determining the success of either. Thei 
common interest centers in the pupil, whose advancement deter- 
mines alike their success or failure. Hence supervision means 
codperation, the teacher being as much a party to the procedure 
as the supervisor. Ideally the teacher is not an inferior pro- 
fessionally, but in every sense of the word an equal. It may be 
true that, taking situations as we find them, supervisors, on the 
average, will be better trained. But it is equally true that not 
until teachers approach the status of supervisors in skill and 
understanding can supervision be at its best. 
Supervision necessary even though teachers are highly 
trained and of long experience. Teacher-training rather tends 
to make supervision more effective than to eliminate the need 
of it. We have indicated above that only well-trained teachers 
are in a position to take full advantage of supervision. Others 
are incapable of carrying out fully their share of the codperative 
undertaking involved in the process. Then, too, it is impossible 
for one to teach and to observe the process effectively at the

  ame time. The experienced teacher will recall with what un- 
ertainty of their success he has often reviewed classes he has 
aught. In general the less experienced teacher will meet with 
he greater difficulty in this task of evaluating his work, but all 
ill be at a disadvantage. How many times have I wished that 
could observe my own teaching as it is seen by my students! 
suspect that this is a common wish of every experienced 
eacher whose training has raised problems of pedagogy. The 
ympathetic supervisor supplies this need. 
Appreciation of our work by another serves as a “drive” 
o greater effort. Another consideration is the fact that it is 
lonly human to be stimulated by the attention of others inter- 
sted in our problem. This is one of the fundamental “human 
drives.” We want others to see and appreciate. Hence it is 
ittle wonder that the teacher who works alone at his task, 
though he may be enthusiastic and improve for a while, finally 
gives up and enters the realm of pedagogical stagnation. How 
different it is with the teacher who through proper supervision 
iis enabled to keep his youthful enthusiasm, always meeting and 
solving problems, always improving, and this with the assur- 
lance that growth may go on through life. 
Supervisor is generally the only observer who can appreciate 
hat which has pedagogical worth. Laymen who visit the school 
from time to time may praise or blame, but such praise or 
blame will not matter much to the teacher when he realizes 
their incapacity to evaluate teaching. Not so with the super- 
visor; he knows good teaching when he sees it. His reaction 
will be significant and at all times constructive. He is interested 
lin the teacher’s improvement, which is one with his own success 
las a supervisor. 
Common background of educational theory necessary. The 
teacher must know the goals of education and be in agreement 
with the supervisor relative to those toward which effort is to 
be made. They must also be in mutual agreement as to ways
-P-A-G-E-416
  404 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
and means of attaining the goals desired. The reason for thi! 
lies in the conception of supervision that we have outline 
above. Supervision is a codperative undertaking in whic 
teacher and supervisor work as one for the purpose of improvin, 
instruction. Hence they must necessarily be working at cros: 
purposes if there is not a large common ground of agreemen 
with respect to educational objectives and methods. 
There must be much professional reading on the part of bot 
accompanied by discussions or conferences. There must be 
lively interest in new educational movements and theories, an 
a discussion of them. In such matters the teacher may we! 
take the initiative. The teacher who stands back waiting t 
be told what to read is by that token incapable of entering mos 
effectively into the codperative task of supervision. 
Teacher must free himself from false standards of succes: 
Many teachers are incapable of supervision because of fals 
standards of success which are the result of a wrong attitud 
This attitude is the result of one of two things. Many con] 
scientious teachers are afraid that their work will not appea 
favorably when compared with that of others. Such teacher: 
will listen to discussions and will read in the field of educatio 
but cannot bear the thought of supervision, which means tha 
a second party must enter the problem. A second cause for th 
negative attitude toward supervision lies in the individual’ 
lack of ideals of teaching. Such individuals have their ideal: 
elsewhere. It is not their greatest desire to be known as goo! 
teachers or to think of themselves as good teachers. Thei 
position brings them a remuneration sufficient for their needs 
They go and return from the school much as a laboring mai 
goes to and returns from the factory—a day’s work for a day’ 
pay. Of course, such teachers will not care to work with super 
visors. This means conferences, readings, experiments, discus 
sions, and sometimes with no added recompense except th 
satisfaction that comes from improvement.

     There is but one cure for either cause of negative attitudes 
loward supervision, and that is the taking of such interest in 
leaching that little else matters compared to genuine success 
this field. The teacher must care more for ultimate success 
han for his momentary reputation. He must for the moment 
orget himself in his effort to succeed. It is not easy to build up 
uch an attitude, but it must be present if supervision is to 
ucceed completely. 
No royal road to mastery of art of teaching. The old 
aying that teachers are born and not made is but a partial 
ruth. It is true in the sense that the teacher must himself be 
n intellectually superior individual. But intellect alone never 
ade a teacher and never will. The proper presentation of 
aterial for intellectual assimilation demands skill that can 
e attained only through years of effort. It is not enough that 
he teacher merely teach, for this may mean only the fixation 
f bad habits. He must consciously attempt to teach each les- 
on better than the one before. Carrying out this purpose will 
all for much reading, thought, and ingenuity on his part. If 
e is fortunate enough to be working with a supervisor, it will 
lemand conferences in addition. It may also require his obser- 
ation of other teachers. And above all and under any con- 
itions it will require a receptive mind. This is a necessary 
rerequisite to all learning, and learning to teach is no exception 
o the rule. 
Master teachers, like great painters and other true artists, 
nd avenues for improvement opening up as experience pro- 
resses. A unique feature of our profession is the fact that as 
e proceed the vistas of opportunity for improvement seem to 
expand. And this is a blessing in one sense of the word at least, 
for the thrill in life seems to come from accomplishing rather 
than from having accomplished. It is becoming rather than 
being which gives satisfaction.

for Judging Teachers in Service and to profit by the analy- 
sis and rating. 
  Scales of two classes. In general we may divide all test and 
ating scales into two classes; namely, diagnostic and adminis- 
rative. The former provides for a final summary of results, or 
ating, through analyzing each factor into its elements. It has 
he disadvantage of being laborious and slow, but the advantage 
f forcing one to ground his judgment in the elements behind 
he subjective and unanalyzed estimate. The greatest value of 
his scale lies in the possibility of self-improvement by the user. 
he administrative scale, because of the rapidity with which it 
an be used, has its greatest value in the hands of one interested 
erely in determining present status or in classifying. The 
ugg Rating Scale combines both administrative and diagnostic 
eatures. 
Through the kindness of Professor H. O. Rugg of Columbia 
niversity the author is able to include a copy of the Rugg 
ating Scale for Judging Teachers in Service. The student 
will follow the directions carefully and, after making his scale, 
ate at least five other teachers and then himself. See page 412. 
Correction of weakness found in oneself by means of Scale A. 
[t does but little good to locate one’s weaknesses if one does not 
mmediately set about the process of correcting them. Such a 
orocess should be systematic. Merely to conclude that one is 
xoing to improve is useless. One not only must conclude that 
he is going to improve but must, at the same time, lay down a 
olan of improvement and systematically follow it out.

PURPOSES AND USE OF THE RATING FORMS FOR EITHEI 
HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE STUDENTS OR FOR TEACHERS 
(The forms for I, the teacher, and II, the high school and college student, differ onl 
in content of the groups of qualities and definitional questions. Therefore, the sam 
description applies to either.) 
i 
It is important to recognize that there are two separate an 
distinct features to this rating form. 
First—Self-improvement through self-rating. It is designed pri 
marily for the student or teacher to rate himself. The first ste 
in self-improvement is to be made critical of the extent to whicl 
one exhibits certain traits. Furthermore, clear recognition of one’ 
deficiencies can and does lead to definite self-improvement. Forn 
A, therefore, is of primary importance in improving the student, o 
the teacher in service. To bring about self-improvement, therefore 
both student and teacher should rate themselves, at least once eacl 
year, each question on the form being answered. 
Second—The rating scale. A method of giving a person : 
numerical rating (116, or 132, or 74, etc.) of which the reliabilit; 
is definitely known, and with which others’ ratings can be directl 
compared; furthermore, a rating which cannot be confused witl 
the commonly used “per cent” marking system of the publi 
schools. This scheme provides a method of direct comparison b: 
which a teacher (or student) is rated on five different groups o 
qualities, by being compared directly with five others, whose name 
have been assigned definite positions on the scale. These five per 
sons are selected so as to represent respectively (1) the best teache 
(or student) the rater has ever known; (5) the poorest; (3) th 
representative “average” teacher (or student); (2) the persor 
midway between the best and the average; (4) the one midway 
between average and the poorest. A definite number of points i 
assigned to each of these five positions on the scale; for example 
38, 30, 22, 14, 6, respectively. Thus a person is given a singl 
numerical rating by totaling the points he is given on each of th

   ve groups of qualities. In the case of teachers, this is of especial 
portance in rating for promotion. 
The scale is so constructed that a teacher who represents “‘aver- 
ge” in each will receive a score of 110; a teacher who represents 
best” in each will receive a score of 190; and the one who repre- 
nts “poorest” will receive a score of 30. 
Il. HOW TO CONSTRUCT A RATING SCALE 
Form B 
Two important facts : 
1. It is very difficult to make a rating scale properly. A scale 
annot be constructed in less than two or three hours. 
2. Once made, the scale needs but little modification from year 
O year. 
. Necessary steps in the construction of a scale. 
There are three major steps in constructing a rating scale. 
First step: Write down a list of,25-30 teachers (or students) 
‘anging from the very best to the very poorest in your acquaint- 
nce, for each of whom you can answer the questions of Form A 
f the Rating Card. 
Important: The list must not contain less than 25 names. It 
ust contain some very poor teachers, some very good teachers, 
nd a considerable number of “‘average”’ teachers. 
Second step: Arrange this list in rank order of merit from the 
“best” to the “poorest,” separately for each of the five groups of 
qualities. 
Important: In ranking persons for one group of qualities (say 
“skill in teaching”), the other groups of qualities. must be abso- 
lutely ignored. The arrangement of the list in rank order is the 
most difficult and important single step in the construction of a 
rating scale. Experimentation has shown, that to do it success- 
fully, the most effective method is as follows: 
1. Locate each person in the list in one of three groups for each 
question in each group of qualities on Form A. A study of this 
checking should enable you to rearrange the teachers, or students, 
on your original list in from three to five groups. 
   
-P-A-G-E-422
  410 OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED TEACHING 
2. Next, therefore, group the teachers on the original list in a 
least three and, if possible, five groups—say put in one group thi 
few who are markedly “‘best”’; in another, the few who are clear] 
“poorest,” and the remainder in a third group who exhibit variou 
degrees of “mediocrity.” If the large mediocre group can next b 
separated into two or three groups, it will facilitate the next step, viz. 
3. Rearrange the persons in each group so that they stand i 
exact rank order. This will be most difficult to do in connectio 
with the “average” groups. 
4. Complete the final “rank order” arrangement of the entir 
list by comparing the teachers near the limits of the adjacent 
groups, e.g., further direct man-to-man comparison may result i 
interchanging individuals from, say, a “better than average” to a) 
“average” group. 
When the original list is finally arranged in the rank order, yo 
are ready for the 
Third and last step in the construction of a rating scale: Selec 
five persons to occupy the five positions on the scale in each grou 
of qualities. Do this as follows: (1) make a final decision as t 
which of the two or three persons in the “rank order” list is reall 
the “best” one you ever knew and can now use for purposes 0 
scale-comparison; (2) select in same way the “poorest” for th 
scale; (3) from the two or three who stand nearest the middle of 
the list, decide upon the best one to represent the “average” position 
on the scale; (4 and 5) similarly with the ones to occupy the posi- 
tion halfway between the average and best, and halfway between 
average and poorest. These are called respectively “better than 
average” and “poorer than average.” 
Important : Experimentation and experience in the army have 
shown that the scale can be made properly only by carrying through 
these major steps separately for each group of qualities on the scale. 
Ill. HOW TO RATE TEACHERS ON THE SCALE 
1. The rating is to be made for one group of qualities at a time, 
giving each person a stated number of points for that quality. It is 
done by comparing the person’s qualities directly with those of the 
others whose names appear on the scale. Visualize each one as 
vividly as possible, thus locating a person at a particular point on
-P-A-G-E-423
LESSON XLV 4II 
the scale. Be sure to give him the exact number of points that you 
think represents his position on the scale. The numerical values 
38, 30, 22, 14, and 6 have been selected to give you considerable 
opportunity to assign values between these set points ; for example, 
in the long run nearly as many should receive 23 or 21, as 22, 
which is the “average” point of the scale. 
Important: In case you are unable to decide clearly between 
the person you are rating and those whose names are on the scale, 
examine the results of checking the definitional questions in that 
group of qualities in Form A. This will enable you to compare 
them more concretely. 
2. The total rating of a person is obtained by adding the number 
of points given him on each of the five groups of qualities, writing 
this in the compartment of the card left for the total rating at the 
lower right-hand corner. 
Important: Scales for the rating of students should be made in 
group conference. All teachers who know the same set of students 
should come together and construct scales which will contain rela- 
tively the same names. I[¢ is fundamentally important that names 
assigned to particular scale-positions (‘‘best,” “average,” “poorest,” 
etc.) be the same on the scales of different teachers. Otherwise the 
numerical ratings made against these scale-positions by various 
teachers may not closely agree. If teachers, in conference, can 
agree on the names of students to go on the scales, numerical rat- 
ings made against these will have very great reliability.

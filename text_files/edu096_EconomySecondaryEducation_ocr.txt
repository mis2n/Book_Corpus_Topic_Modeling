  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
THE comparative study of educational efficiency 
is one of the most fruitful means of criticism at 
the disposal of the trained educator. That it has 
not been used adequately is due to our profes- 
sional ignorance of contemporaneous educational 
practice. That it has not been used wisely is due 
to the fact that it has been most frequently em- 
ployed by fascinated travelers rather than by 
trained thinkers. 
The influence of foreign school systems on 
American educational practice has not been al- 
together fortunate. Too often we have been over- 
zealous in the imitation of European methods. 
Differences of social aims and conditions have 
not been taken into account sufficiently. We 
have copied_enthusiastically_v When we should

observed and loudly proclaimed the achievements 
of German, French, and English institutions. 
The study which follows is a sample of dis- 
criminating judgment in estimating foreign and 
domestic practice in terms of relative worth. It 
is throughout sensitive to differences of national 
purpose and condition. It suggests with rare 
power of analysis what of European practice is 
applicable to a particular problem in American 
educational life, and does it with clear under- 
standing of necessary modifications. It is a fine 
use of educational experience in the solution of 
current issues. 
The difficulties of using educational experi- 
ence, both contemporaneous and historic, should 
not deter us. In achieving true progress, that 
advance accompanied by the least waste effort, 
it is necessary to bring all available experience 
to bear. But the experiences of our historic and 
contemporaneous life never offer us direct pre- 
scriptions. They are somewhat stubborn in their 
yield of applicable truth. Success and failure 
are generally complex. A competent analytic 
mind must break them up into their constituent

elements, and weigh the relative influence of each 
component factor. An efficient adaptive mind 
will then know which elements to omit or modify, 
and how to create a new synthesis suitable to 
American life. 
In spite of a rapid introduction of the experi=, 
mental method in education, it is probable that 
we shall likewise make an increasing use of com- 
parative methods in the interpretation of our 
gross practical experience. There is a normality 
about our institutional adaptations, however de- 
fective they may be, which purely experimental 
work seldom possesses. Experiment is artificial 
at best. The conditions are prearranged to give 
ease of interpretation, but the experience itself 
is not so practical and wholesome. Our prag- 
matic, day-to-day adaptations presumably take 
into account all the factors, but we are baffled to 
know just how we get results. Here analysis and 
interpretation are exceedingly difficult. It seems 
then that the experimental and the comparative 
methods must be made supplementary means in 
the clarifying of educational theory and the im- 
provement of teaching practice. One will be

powerful in indicating the true influence of spe- 
cific factors, and the other in suggesting the way 
in which complexes operate in the face of total 
situations. The range of truth rendered by ex- 
perimentation will necessarily be limited. Its 
generalizations will often be isolated. To cover 
the intervening ground we must rely on the best 
study we can make through comparison. In no 
other way can we bring the fullest wisdom to bear 
upon practical procedure.

  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY 
EDUCATION 
I 
THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMY 
Economy in education means the transfer to the 
pupil, in the fewest years and in the most thor- 
ough manner, of a certain relatively complete 
fund of knowledge and a group of habits and 
methods of work which are likely to prove useful 
in the life he is to lead. ‘Time is not the only con- 
sideration. If our education is scattered and su- 
perficial, no matter how long studied, it is uneco- 
nomical. If the progress of the gifted is retarded 
because of the drag of the average group, it is 
uneconomical. There is no economy in a system 
of schools where there are many pupils leaving 
before graduation, whose education on that 
account is fragmentary and unbalanced. Fur- 
ther, if our education fails to leave a boy or girl 
with a fund of useful knowledge, or if it fails to 
i

  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
equip him with habits or methods of work useful 
in life, the time spent in acquiring it might better 
have been used in some other way. 
It is charged that the American secondary 
school is wasteful, that it is prodigal of the time of 
the youth of our land. This indictment is based, 
in general, upon the results of the study of for- 
eign school systems and upon thoughtful con- 
sideration and investigation of the success of 
American secondary schools in meeting the needs 
of life in a democracy. The usual arguments run 
as follows: (1) The secondary schools of Ger- 
many and France complete a boy’s cultural edu- 
cation at the age of eighteen, granting him 
immediate entrance to the professional schools 
of the universities. At this age the equivalent 
of two years of our college work has been com- 
pleted, and it is almost the universal opinion of 
observers that this work has been done in a far 
more thorough and scholarly fashion than in this 
country. (2) The German and French schools, 
through their “Cycle System,” make some pro- 
vision for the pupils who drop out, encouraging 
them to remain until certain breaking points, 
2
-P-A-G-E-11
  THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMY 
where for the time being the work comes to a 
logical end. In this country we aim our whole 
system of education at the graduate, forgetting 
completely the great majority who fail to com- 
plete the course. (3) Students of secondary edu- 
cation also maintain that our curriculum is not 
vital; that sciences, languages, mathematics, 
history, English, and even agriculture, home 
economics, and manual training, are taught with 
little bearing upon practical consequences. 
In brief, therefore, we are charged, in compari- 
son with other systems, of using more time in 
which to teach less; that much of the little which 
we. teach is given in no thorough manner, or 
worse still, has no connection with the world at 
large; and that of the small results of our educa- 
tion, only the graduates of our schools are in a 
position to benefit thereby. This is a severe 
indictment. ! 
In order to arrive at the truth of the matter, 
it is well to examine in a fair and impartial way 
our own system and certain especially successful 
features of the systems of foreign countries, keep- 
ing our attention fixed upon the ways in which 
3

  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the time and efforts of the pupils are economized, 
that we may see if some modifications of such 
practice are worthy of adoption in the secondary 
schools of the United States. 
In the first place, how much earlier do foreign 
boys actually finish their course? The usual ar- 
guments speak of the German boy graduating 
from the secondary school at the age of eighteen, 
academically two years ahead of his American 
cousin who finishes the high school at the same 
age. Eighteen years is not a fair estimate of the 
average age of the American high-school gradu- 
ate. Bright boys often finish at this age or ear- 
lier, but the average is nearer nineteen. The same 
variation is true of the German and French 
schools, although no complete authoritative 
study is available. In Germany only the bright- 
est boys are able to advance each year without 
repeating a class. Dr. Thomas Alexander, whose 
study of the German schools is soon to be pub- 
lished, found upon inquiry in the senior class of 
the Gymnasien and Realgymnasien in Stettin, 
Koenigsberg, Posen, Danzig, Hildesheim, Han- 
over, Swinemiinde, Weimar, Dortmund, Leipsic,

Mannheim, and Berlin, that less than twenty per 
cent of the boys were completing their course on 
schedule time. In the Friedrich-Wilhelms Real- 
gymnasium at Stettin, the average age in classes 
for 1913 was as follows: —

The general fact that more than one year sep- 
arates each group indicates retardation. The 
small difference between Untersekunda and Ober- 
sekunda is due to the breaking point there pro- 
vided, many of the duller and older boys remain- 
5

ing to this point merely to pass the examination 
allowing them the privilege of serving but one 
year in the army as a volunteer. 
The graduates of the same school at Michael- 
mas, 1912, were distributed as follows: One was 
eighteen; five, nineteen; three, twenty; and one, 
twenty-two. At Easter, 1913, the distribution 
was as follows: One was eighteen; three, nine- 
teen; six, twenty; two, twenty-one; and one, 
twenty-two. These data are given only to illus- 
trate a fact remarked upon by observers, that 
German boys in few instances finish at the age 
of eighteen, and that nineteen or twenty or more 
constitute the usual ages. 
In short, only the brightest boys graduate 
from the German secondary schools; the others 
fall by the way, especially at the close of Unter- 
sekunda. The average age of such graduates is 
more than eighteen, probably between nineteen 
and twenty. The academic standing of such 
graduates is approximately equivalent to that of 
a student in the American college who has com- 
pleted his sophomore year. Therefore, the bright- 
est boys of the German secondary schools, the 
6
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMY 
children of a select group, enter professional 
study at the age of twenty. So do many American 
boys. Some few German boys graduate at eight- 
een. Some few American boys may be found in 
the junior class in college at the same age. The 
economy in the German system, therefore, is not 
so much that it places all its boys in American col- 
lege junior standing ready for professional work 
at an earlier age than in this country, but rather 
that its brightest boys are encouraged to advance 
rapidly; while for the great majority the economy 
is not so much in fewer calendar years of work 
as it is in more and better work done in more 
time. 
How much work, then, has the foreign sec- 
ondary schoolboy done? Estimating in terms of 
“units” (meaning five forty-five-minute periods 
a week for one year), the German boy graduating 
from the Gymnasium has completed four units of 
religion, five units of German, thirteen units of 
Latin, seven units of Greek, four units of French, 
three units of history, two units of geography, 
seven units of mathematics, four units of natural 
science, and two units of drawing, to say nothing 
7  
-P-A-G-E-16
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of gymnastics and singing and electives in He- 
brew and English.1 In the Realgymnasium and 
the Oberrealschule quite as great a total number 
of “units” is done, the only difference being less 
emphasis on linguistic studies, and proportion- 
ately more emphasis on mathernatics and science. 
On the same basis, at graduation from the classi- 
cal course, the French boy has completed a total 
of six units in French, seven in Latin, four in 
modern languages, three in Greek, four in his- 
tory and geography, three in mathematics, two 
in natural science, two in drawing, and two in 
philosophy. In other elective courses of study a 
different distribution of units would occur, but 
the general total would remain approximately 
thirty-three. The character of the work done is 
comprehensive, and it is pursued in a scholarly 
manner. With these facts in mind, there can be 
no doubt that German and French boys cover 
1 The term “unit” is used to simplify the data. The reader 
must take into account several facts: (1) The school year in the 
German schools is two hundred and forty days, thirty-three per 
cent longer than in the United States. (2) Methods in the for- 
eign schools require much of the “home work” to be done in 
class. (3) Much of the work counted is done in classes corre- 
sponding to our elementary schools. , 8 :

more ground than do the graduates of our high 
schools; and while the average group does this 
work in no less time than the average group in the 
United States, bright boys are encouraged and 
scheduled to finish at the age of eighteen. 
There are certain distinctive features of the or- 
ganization and administration of these European 
schools that contribute to this economy. More 
time is devoted to study than in the United 
States. The curriculum is unified, unbroken, and 
designed for professional life. The methods of 
teaching point continually at the ends that the 
nation has in view. While German and French 
systems of education are designed for conditions 
much different from ours, and while it is a very 
common fallacy to advocate immediate adoption 
of foreign measures, often totally unsuited to the 
conditions and aims of education in our coun- 
try, it is probable that adaptations of these good 
features may be introduced to the betterment of 
the secondary schools of the United States. The 
following chapters consider this in detail.
-P-A-G-E-18
II 
ECONOMY THROUGH AN INCREASE OF TIME 
DEVOTED TO STUDY 
In Germany the boy or girl goes to school two 
hundred and forty days in the year, while in 
America the school year rarely exceeds two hun- 
dred days in length. As a matter of fact, few of 
our schools average more than one hundred and 
seventy working days. The German system, 
through the sixty to eighty additional days, ef- 
fects a saving of from three to four school years 
in the twelve years of attendance. The German 
boy works six days a week, beginning at seven in 
the morning in the summer and at eight in the 
winter, continuing for the morning session until 
twelve or one o’clock. There is also an afternoon 
session. Each boy is occupied during his entire 
time in school: there are no study periods. Pro- 
ceeding upon the frequent-rest theory of fatigue, 
there is a varying period, averaging fifteen min- 
utes, allowed between classes. In this country 
10 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  TIME DEVOTED. TO STUDY 
twenty to twenty-five forty-five-minute periods 
is considered a normal load. The German boy 
carries from thirty-two to thirty-six; the French 
boy, from twenty-six to thirty-eight. With more 
work done in school each day, with a clear gain 
of from seven to nine hundred working days in 
twelve years, with classes starting and stopping 
promptly, with no time wasted in study periods, 
the mere fact that more time is devoted to study 
appears as a considerable factor in enabling their 
pupils to do work in advance of our students, and 
incomparably beyond it in thoroughness. 
Shall we introduce these mechanical time- 
savers in our schools, increasing the time de- 
voted to school work? 
We should unquestionably save time if we were 
to lengthen our school year. The long summer 
vacation is not needed for purposes of efficiency. 
There is a question, indeed, if it is not positively 
harmful to take pupils out of habits of work and 
study for three months. The period of rest is 
now needed, that teachers may receive the fur- 
ther training that they should have had at the 
start; but institute work, correspondence study, 
II
-P-A-G-E-20
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
part-time work, and occasional years devoted 
to study can care for that. The pupil would be 
quite as well off with a shorter vacation, or with 
better distributed short vacations. Many of our 
secondary schools have already lengthened their 
school term through the introduction of short 
summer courses, and the encouragement of work 
at summer camps. The demand for such work is 
shown in the all-year term of business colleges 
and in the popularity of Y.M.C.A. classes. The 
difficulty with this work is that it is usually 
designed for the dullard who is seeking to satisfy 
examinations in which he has failed. Our school 
programs are rarely so arranged that able and 
ambitious pupils may do advanced work at these 
periods and receive proportionate credit. The 
simplest way in which to save time would be 
to introduce the year-round school, somewhat 
on the plan of the University of Chicago, with 
shorter and better distributed vacations. Our 
four-year course could then be completed in 
three. The expense, greater at first, would in 
reality become less, because of the greater and 
more constant use of the expensive school plant. 
12
-P-A-G-E-21
  TIME DEVOTED TO STUDY 
Why should not able-bodied boys and girls 
work six days a week? A large part of the after- 
noon is always free. German boys are glad to 
receive two afternoons a week. The West Pointer, 
at liberty for a little while on Wednesday and 
Saturday afternoons, thrives under his system. 
The application of the investigations of psycho- 
logical and physiological fatigue will result in 
spreading out the work more evenly, with short 
and frequent periods of rest, rather than in 
grouping the hard work in a few days. The prob- 
lem will lie in a selection of better-chosen in- 
tervals of rest, and in a wiser apportionment of 
work between the home and the school. 
Critics of secondary education have long sus- 
pected that something is wrong in a system where 
the class exercise consists largely in testing 
knowledge gained in unsupervised study in va- 
cant periods in school, and in homes where few 
pupils have uninterrupted opportunity quietly 
to pursue their studies. Pupils are too often 
poorly prepared for their class work. The mere 
observation of children beginning their tasks in 
the usual study period or in the home is sufficient 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to show that greater economy might be practiced 
here. The real solution probably lies in better 
teaching methods. The possibility that a better 
arranged school day may help to solve this diffi- 
culty warrants its consideration here. 
High schools have encouraged teachers in 
charge of study halls to institute more effective 
supervision. Talks on “How to Study” have 
been designed to help the student to help him- 
self. Principal Wiener, of Newark, New Jersey, 
claims conspicuous success for the plan which, 
through the lengthening of the recitation period, 
permits half the time to be used in effective study 
under the immediate direction of the classroom 
teacher. An extra period for further study is also 
provided at the close of the day. This plan in 
operation, according to Principal Wiener, has 
greatly reduced the amount of study needed at 
home through more efficient school study. It has 
also resulted in added interest and greater suc- 
cess on the part of the pupils, and consequently 
has aided in the practice of economy. The 
lengthening of the school day, admitting of more 
efficient preparation for the recitation, is thus 
14  
-P-A-G-E-23
TIME DEVOTED TO STUDY 
claimed to have beneficial results. It may mean, 
where it is efficiently applied, that it will enable 
pupils to carry more work than is now the usual 
case. 
Even under the present plan, where pupils 
recite upon four subjects each day, preparing the 
same in the noise, bustle, and divided attention 
of the study hall, and all too often under unfa- 
vorable conditions at home, it is probable that 
economy could be practiced through a more just 
distribution of work carried by pupils. High- 
school pupils vary in capacity. There must be 
certain pupils unusually gifted who can carry 
five important subjects with less strain and ef- 
fort, and more success, than certain dull pupils 
can accomplish with three. When our schools 
were less well organized, able pupils were not 
forced to keep step with the great mass. They 
were allowed to advance as their abilities allowed, 
and thus bright boys entered professional life at 
an earlier age. With our present system of uniis, 
certification, and uniformity, it is difficult for 
principals to recognize differences of ability, and 
having recognized them, to provide for them. 
15 
   
-P-A-G-E-24
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
With a better-arranged school day, with better- 
chosen intervals of rest, with programs arranged 
to provide for varying types of work, more pupils 
ought to be able to carry a larger number of 
courses than at present, while the great average 
group should be able more efficiently and more 
thoroughly to carry the normal amount. 
It is possible, therefore, even under the pres- 
ent organization, to economize time and effort, 
through the mere details of mechanical admin- 
istration. We may secure added thoroughness 
and prepare our pupils more completely at an 
earlier age, if we merely lengthen the school term, 
extend the day, and arrange it better. For pupils 
who are to drop out of school, added work can 
be covered in a given time; while the brighter 
pupils, preparing for professional life, can thus 
enter advanced work at an earlier age.

ECONOMY THROUGH THE ORGANIZATION OF 
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
In France and Germany, as well as in almost 
every important country in the world, secondary 
education designed for the children of the upper 
classes runs parallel with elementary education, 
the education of the poorer classes. The boy en- 
ters the secondary school at the age of six, in 
Germany going into the Vorschule, in France to 
the classe enfantine. There is no break in his edu- 
cation. He starts in upon one system, designed 
to prepare him for professional life or govern- 
mental service. This plan has two great advan- 
tages. It allows a child to start important sub- 
jects at an early age, and, by the cumulative 
effect of continuous application, achieves results 
far in advance of those achieved by children in 
this country. It so groups subjects that at break- 
ing points, which are provided, a pupil may leave 
17
-P-A-G-E-26
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
school before the completion of a course, and still 
receive a reasonably complete training. 
The German boy starts Latin in the class cor- 
responding to our fourth grade. He starts his 
first modern language at the same age. Plane 
geometry is introduced in the class corresponding 
to our sixth grade and the second modern lan- 
guage in our seventh grade. The chart on page 
1g shows the comparative progress in mathe- 
matics and Latin of American, German, and 
French boys of the same class, and almost of the 
same ages. That the essentials of our high-school 
course are completed in the class corresponding 
to our ninth grade or first-year high school is due 
in part to the mechanical saving of time, in part 
to better methods, but in a large degree to the 
one unbroken course of study, leading from the 
first grade to the university, and the more con- 
tinued attack at subject-matter which is thereby 
effected. 
The second economy afforded by the unbroken 
course of study deserves more extended treat- 
ment. The German Imperial Government, real- 
izing that all the Boys, even of its selected group,

will not be able to finish the course, and under- 
standing the dangers of planning the course 
solely for the graduate, when seventy-five per 
cent drop out before graduating, has introduced 
a system encouraging pupils to remain in school 
until certain points, placing a reward for the 
completion of that amount of work. The German 
boy who passes the examination at the close of 
Untersekunda at the age of sixteen or seven- 
teen is required to serve but one year in the 
army as a volunteer, a privilege which is eagerly 
sought for. 
The Arrété of 1902, reorganizing the French 
secondary schools, recognized the same principle, 
and instituted a break in the course at a corre- 
sponding place. Boys dropping out in these 
schools at this point have finished a study of the 
history of the world; have completed three and 
sometimes as much as six years’ work in two lan- 
guages; have mastered the fundamentals of arith- 
metic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, and 
have had good training in science. The work of 
those who continue is largely the supplementa- 
tion and expansion of that which has gone before. 
20
-P-A-G-E-29
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
Fifty per cent of those eliminated drop out at 
this one place. 
In order that the workings of this “Cycle 
System” may be examined in greater detail, the 
course in history in the boy’s secondary schools 
of France is given. 
The Preliminary Cycle covers the work in the 
preparatory classes, and in the eighth and sev- 
enth forms,” from the age of six to eleven or 
twelve. After two years’ work, consisting of 
“stories and familiar conversations about the

of the history of France from earliest times down 
to 1871. The point of view is largely political, 
dealing with battles and martial heroes, territo- 
rial extension and governmental changes. Occa-

of such topics as “‘Charlemagne’s relations with

the schools,” ‘the economic conditions of the 
people under Louis XIV,” “the coming of the 
steamboat and the railroad,” and “the opening 
of the Suez Canal.” This completes the prelimi- 
nary cycle, and, should a boy be compelled to 
leave at this time, being greatly retarded, he 
would already have ina small way an outline of 
the complete history of France. Should he pro- 
ceed, he has completed a course in national his- 
tory sufficient to serve as a background for the 
more intensive work to come. That he does 
build on this knowledge is shown by the fact that 
the notebooks which he prepares at this period at 
the dictation of his teacher serve as the outlines of 
the work which is to follow in the higher classes. 
The First Cycle covers a period of four years 
devoting one and one-half hours per week to his- 
tory. The sixth form covers in a thorough way 
the history of the ancient world from earliest 
times in Egypt to the adoption of Christianity as 
the official religion of the Roman Empire. The 
development of the French, Germans, English,

and Arabs to the time of the Renaissance is the 
work of the fifth form. The fourth form deals 
with the period up to the French Revolution; 
while the third spends a whole year upon the 
developments of the nineteenth century. While 
political and military terms dominate the skele- 
ton of the outline, customs, economic conditions, 
culture, education, and religion receive consider- 
able attention. Illustrations of this are a thor- 
ough economic interpretation of the results of 
the Crusades, a study of industry, commerce, 
mercantile marine, and navy under the ministry 
of Colbert, the development of transportation in 
modern times, etc. The final topic in the cycle’s 
work shows the trend of the interpretation: — 
Government of France in the nineteenth century: 
Central government; ministers and chambers. Fran- 
chise: qualification for franchise; money qualification 
for franchise on the basis of taxes paid; universal 
suffrage. The Press: the right of meeting and asso- 
ciation. The Democracy: the right of voting; popu- 
lar education; compulsory military service. Labor 
laws from 1848 onwards.

At the end of the First Cycle, therefore, at the 
age of fifteen or sixteen, the French secondary 
schoolboy has not only completed a history of his 
own country, but, building upon that, has made 
a rather careful survey of the history of the world, 
so far as it has influenced his native land. The 
point of view has been different, placing its inter- 
pretations more upon economic and social bases. 
Were the boy to drop out here, he would probably 
have a better knowledge of history that is useful 
to him than the usual American graduate of a 
high school who has elected all the history open 
to him. 
The Second Cycle, three years’ work, covers the 
field from the time of Charlemagne to the present 
day. The attack is more thorough, the interpre- 
tation broader, the character of the work, ac- 
cording to competent observers, more advanced 
than freshman or sophomore history in Ameri- 
can colleges. The final topic is quoted to show 
the type of work: — 
General features of contemporary civilization: — 
Armed peace. Alliances. Importance of economic 
interests. Imperialism. Respect for the rights of in-

dividuals. Abolition of slavery and serfdom. More 
lenient penal legislation. 
Religious liberty. Suppression of state religions. 
Political liberties; representative government; 
principal forms of government. 
Formation of democratic government; right of 
voting; universal suffrage. Popular education. Mil- 
itary service. 
Social doctrines and labor legislation.' 
Students who have elected the Latin course 
take in addition two hours a week for two years 
in the history of the ancient world. Here as 
above the interpretation is broader, and the 
work more thorough. For illustration, the topic 
following the Roman conquest of the Mediter- 
ranean is cited in full: — 
Consequences of the conquests : Introduction of Hel- 
lenism; Scipio and Cato. Transformation in social 
habits; dwellings, clothing, meals, games. Transfor- 
mation in religion, intellectual life, morals. Social 
transformation; disappearance of the middle class; 
clientship. Nobility, knights, plebeians, slaves.?

This system applied to other subjects has 
worked out in the same way. During the First 
Cycle, science is studied in an elementary and 
general way, botany, zodlogy, geology, physics, 
and chemistry being taken up. Opportunity for 
further work, and more thorough specialization 
is given later. The French boy, at fifteen or six- 
teen, has already read certain works of Nepos, 
Justin, Cesar, Curtius, Virgil, Ovid, and Livy. 
The Second Cycle broadens out practically the 
same field. In mathematics, at the close of the 
First Cycle, work has been done in second degree 
equations with one and two unknown quantities, 
graphs, logarithms and antilogarithms, com- 
pound interest, elementary surveying, geometry 
(planes and straight lines in space), and geo- 
metric drawing. 
This arrangement of courses on the Cycle Plan 
makes for great economy. Not only is the field 
covered in a very thorough fashion and added 
interest aroused through the knowledge that 
work well done one year will be advantageous in 
the next, but, more important still, the course is 
so arranged that boys who are compelled to leave 
26

THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
school before graduation will not find their time 
wasted. 
It must be admitted, however, that in France 
and Germany, as well as in this country, the 
course is planned primarily for the graduate. The 
boy who is forced to drop out is ill-prepared for 
the life he is to lead, probably less well-prepared 
than those in this country. This is due primarily 
neither to the school nor the curriculum. The 
cause lies in the greater need for efficient prepara- 
tion found in the closer competition of an older 
civilization. It is better than if there were no 
such system. Adapted to our conditions, it would 
surely prove more successful. 
Japan, Canada, and the United States, on the 
1 There is some doubt about the success or lack of success of 
the Cycle System for foreign conditions. Certainly the boy 
does not enter the life-work for which his parents intended 
him. In Prussia the boy dropping out at fifteen or sixteen, 
having passed his examinations, is eligible, along with the 
graduates of the Mittelschule, to the preparatory classes in the 
higher schools of machine construction, to the postal and tele- 
graph service, to the normal preparatory school, to the state 
horticultural schools, and as an apprentice for the career of 
expert in vine-growing. Many of these boys become clerks in 
stores, etc. (Neuordnung des Mittelschulwesens in Preussen

other hand, differ in that their secondary schools 
depend upon the elementary for preparation. In 
Canada entrance examinations are required for 
admission to the high school; in Japan only the 
brightest boys are allowed to continue. In the 
United States any graduate of the elementary 
school with the means and ambition may advance 
to the high school. Elementary education has 
always been for the masses; secondary education 
for the classes; and it is upon this as a tradition 
that our schools were founded. There is nothing 
in our tradition to foster the articulation of the 
elementary and secondary schools. Their origin 
was quite different. No wonder that the connec- 
tion is not close! Maladjustment is indicated by 
the thirty per cent that drop out during the first 
high-school year. Over a hundred principals 
gathered together agreed that the most knotty 
problem facing them was provision for that ill- 
assorted, diversely prepared, mature and imma- 
ture group of boys and girls representing the first- 
year class. Surroundings are strange. They are 
new to the type of work. They are not accus- 
tomed to being moved from class to class. They 
28
-P-A-G-E-37
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
do not know what to do with a study period, and 
often never learn. Many are accustomed to have 
the next day’s assignment written on the board. 
They are confused. There is in the United States, 
therefore, an educational waste in the transition 
from the elementary to the secondary school. 
Further, the work of the seventh and eighth 
grades too often is poorly done. Problems of 
discipline are severe. It is almost impossible for 
one teacher thoroughly to master all of the sub- 
ject-matter. The whole year of the eighth grade 
is often spent in review. The agitation for de- 
partmental work, prevocational schools, voca- 
tional schools, and part-time work, the fact that 
elimination in the sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades is very high, and the curious result often 
shown in experiment and practice that six, seven, 
or eight years of elementary-school work seem to 
show but little difference in the end, point to a 
belief that there is a waste of time and effort here. 
_ The high-school graduate who has completed 
collegiate and professional courses is, compara- 
tively speaking, a fortunate individual. He sums 
up within himself the goal of our present educa-

tional system. His algebra and geometry have 
been the gateway to higher mathematics, there 
to be applied to engineering, navigation, teach- 
ing, and thelike. His foreign languages have given 
him ready access to the treasures of other peo- 
ples, hitherto unavailable for him; while his his- 
tory, English, and sciences have shown results. 
Yet, where he has succeeded, twenty have failed, 
and in a sense they have paid for his education. 
Little thought and less consideration have been 
given to that great group of secondary pupils who 
are destined never to go to college, never to 
finish the course, never to carry their subjects far 
enough to arrive at real ends. To be sure, they 
have received their proportionate amount of 
mental discipline, but compared to that which 
they might have received, their fare is meager. 
Taking the figures from the Report of the Com- 
missioner of Education for 1913 for the secondary 
schools of the Southern States, for every one 
hundred in the first-year classes of the public 
high schools, there were seventy-four, thirty- 
nine, and twenty-one in the other classes; while 
for the private secondary schools the figures-are 
3°
-P-A-G-E-39
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
one hundred, seventy-seven, fifty-five, and forty- 
one, the inference being that if a parent has 
money enough to pay tuition for his son, he also 
has strength of purpose enough to keep him in 
school. For the country as a whole Thorndike 
estimated that with a first-year class of one hun- 
dred, the other classes would average sixty-three, 
forty-four, and thirty. Ayres’s computation was 
lower yet, being one hundred, forty-eight, tkirty- 
five, and twenty-five. Strayer’s estimate was 
similar. Over one fourth of the pupils in the sec- 
ondary schools of the United States leave the 
high school with a small knowledge of elemen- 
tary English, a little ancient history, algebra to 
quadratics, and the ability to say mensa, mense, 
mense. Not more than two fifths, and often as 
low as one fifth, pursue languages and mathe- 
matics far enough to achieve real results. There 
can never be economy in any educational system 
when seventy to eighty per cent leave high school 
with incomplete fragments before the end of the 
course, poorly equipped for the battle of life. We 
have one problem in the training of our leaders. 
We have quite as great a problem in making more 
31
-P-A-G-E-40

adequate provision for that great group which 
at present has no choice but to start a course of 
study which it will never be able to finish. 
The world blames the college for lack of econ- 
omy, the college the high school, the high school 
the grammar school, the grammar school the 
primary grades, the primary grades the kinder- 
garten, and the kindergarten the wide world that 
provides that type of children. The unfortunate 
thing is that each shifts the responsibility, and 
that there is a new start at each transition. 
Tf, therefore, we would institute greater econ- 
omy in the secondary schools of the United 
States, we must face the double problem: (1) 
How may we more closely articulate the elemen- 
tary school and the high school, improving espe- 
cially the work of the seventh, eighth, and ninth 
grades, encouraging continuity in the work, that 
there may be no effort wasted in unnecessary 
adjustment and that our future leaders may pro- 
gress with greater rapidity? and (2) How may we 
make more adequate provision, both in the high 
school and in the elementary school, for that 
great group which is forced to drop out of school? 
32
-P-A-G-E-41
  
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
There are many possible remedies. We may 
foster the introduction of departmental work in 
the upper grades, enable the teacher to special- 
ize, make for better work in class, accustom the 
pupils to a variety of teaching, and thus provide 
an easier transition from the elementary to the 
high school. We may introduce vocational and 
prevocational schools, intermediate schools, jun- 
ior high schools, and the like. After all, it makes 
but little difference what we call it. A rose by 
any name will smell as sweet. There is no real 
reason for such a great difference between the 
elementary and the secondary schools. Although 
one was traditionally for the masses, the other for 
the classes, to-day we live in a democracy. We 
believe in equality of opportunity, which does not 
mean identity of opportunity. We have but one 
type of public education for all, and the oppor- 
_tunity which the child has presented to him 
should depend upon his capabilities as he ad- 
vances in his course. Therefore, it makes but 
little difference whether we extend the high 
school downwards, or extend the elementary 
school upwards, or introduce a new type of school. 
33 ’
-P-A-G-E-42
    ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The real articulation of the elementary and sec- 
ondary school depends not so much on the name 
of the school, nor upon its administrative organ- 
ization, as upon the conformity of each to the 
standards in a democracy. 
A subject should be placed in the curriculum 
of our schools not for its traditional value, but 
for the real use to be made of it in after life by the 
particular pupils who are to study it. By “use” 
is meant anything which will contribute to the 
earning of a living, the prolongation of life, the 
performance of the duties of citizenship, moral 
and religious uprightness, and the proper spend- 
ing of the leisure period. 
Such subjects should not be classified as “ele- 
mentary” or “high-school” subjects, because in 
this country they traditionally have become a 
portion of the work of certain schools. They 
should be introduced as early in the course as is 
‘ consistent with efficient teaching, that those stu- 
dents destined to graduate may have as thorough 
training as possible, and that those who are 
forced to drop out may be better equipped. 
Some phase of the Cycle System should be 
34
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
adapted to our schools. We should so group the 
subjects that students who are forced to leave 
may at least have introduction to the essential 
elements of the course. When these standards 
are followed, we shall have gone a long way to- 
ward the solution of the problem of the articula- 
tion of the elementary and the secondary school. 
If we wish to confine ourselves to ideals and 
dream of the dim and distant future, we should 
advocate the immediate adoption of the six-and- 
six plan or one of its modifications in every school 
system of the United States. Certain changes 
would be made. We should revise the entire 
course of study, moulding the first six years to 
provide the fundamentals for all walks of life. 
At the end of the sixth grade we should turn the 
children out able to read, write, and express their 
thoughts in good English, able quickly and ac- 
curately to perform the fundamental operations 
in arithmetic, familiar with geography, history, 
nature study, and hygiene, and competent in the 
simple phases of cooking, sewing, manual train- 
ing, and agriculture. We should then differen- 
tiate the work. We should determine, through 
30 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
some at present unperfected process, the future 
vocations of these children, and to give them 
opportunity for training for their work, provide 
college preparatory, general, scientific, commer- 
cial, home economics, prevocational, industrial, 
agricultural, music and art courses, and the like, 
depending upon the needs of the community. It 
would be well to institute a break at the close of 
the ninth grade for those who are to drop out. 
We should encourage children to remain to this 
point; and that those who wish to change their 
line of work may not be too highly penalized, 
we should provide easy transition from group to 
group. Then we should have articulated the two 
schools. 
It need not be advocated that we extend the 
present high-school course over a period of six 
years. We should push it forward and complete 
it earlier. A boy or girl ought successfully to 
make twenty to twenty-two units in six years. If 
we wish to prepare for entrance to college, five 
high-school years beyond six elementary-school © 
years should be sufficient. It may be objected 
that boys of twelve or thirteen are too young to 
36
-P-A-G-E-45
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
start serious work. German and French boys at 
that age are already reading Nepos and Cesar, 
and are solving propositions in geometry. Modern 
language work is greatly facilitated by an early 
beginning. Dr. King found that of the boys who 
entered the Iowa high schools those of thirteen 
years of age had the best chance of graduation 
and Dr. Van Denburg found the same thing in 
New York City.! This argument is complicated 
by the factor of selection, a just inference being 
that pupils who were bright enough to pass all 
our barriers and enter high school at that age 
were bright enough to carry the work easily. If 
pupils are to need either a cultural or vocational 
education, why should they not start it earlier? 
A few school systems of the United States have 
already adopted the six-and-six plan, effectively 
articulating the schools. Many more have 
adopted the organization, improving the shell, 
but leaving the core much the same as before. 
In the majority of our school systems, however,

such a change will come only after long agitation 
in winning over legislators, school boards, super- 
intendents, and principals, and in a vital reorgan- 
ization of school law. Agreeing upon the princi- 
ples involved, therefore, the duty of American 
schoolmen is neither to quarrel about the ulti- 
mate end, nor, when failing to achieve the ideal in 
one great reorganization, to give up the attempt 
and settle down discouraged. There are many 
steps which may be taken this year in any system 
which will go far not only in making better articu- 
lation, but in winning public support for the ul- 
timate reform and in preparing the school system 
for real progress. It is possible to make haste too 
quickly in school reform. What are some of these 
steps which may be taken immediately? 
First, let us accept every opportunity to 
strengthen the bonds that already exist between 
the elementary school and the high school. The 
poor articulation is due not only to different sub- 
ject-matter, methods, and organization inherited 
from the past, but also to the enforced isolation 
of the two groups of teachers. Few high-school 
teachers know with any degree of precision just 
38
-P-A-G-E-47
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
the work that the pupils have previously done. 
Conversely, few elementary-school teachers know 
exactly the demands that will be placed upon 
their pupils when they enter high school. Why 
not introduce a plan of conferences of both 
groups, discuss these points, and make some pro- 
vision for visitation on the part of the teachers? 
Upper-grade science should help materially in 
high-school science. History, English, and prac- 
tical arts could be built directly upon that which 
has gone before. Each group could improve its 
methods of teaching by the incorporation of the 
good schemes of the others. Further, needless 
or useless repetition of the same subject-matter 
could be eliminated, thus saving time. The ele- 
mentary-school teacher can prepare quite effi- 
ciently for high school. The high-school teacher 
should not look down on the elementary school, 
feeling that he has to begin all anew. Under our 
present system, step by step, we may do a great 
deal toward articulation through the modifica- 
tion of methods and subject-matter which would 
come as a result of greater knowledge of other 
conditions and the consequent sympathy due to 
39
-P-A-G-E-48
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
visitation and meeting of elementary- and high- 
school teachers. 
Second, let us question ourselves very closely 
as to the value of the subject-matter to the pupils 
whom we teach. Forget, if possible for the pur- 
poses of experiment, that there ever was such a 
thing as a curriculum peculiar to the elementary 
or secondary school. If Latin is needed by a boy 
or girl who is planning for professional life, why 
not start it earlier? If business arithmetic and 
bookkeeping are more valuable for the prospec- 
tive business man or merchant than algebra or 
geometry, why should this stop with the seventh 
or eighth grade and not continue to the tenth or 
eleventh? If modern languages can be taught 
to advantage to younger children and there is 
any likelihood that they will ever need them, why 
. not begin such language study earlier in the 
course? It is not advocated that we try to change 
the whole curriculum at once. Try one so-called 
elementary-school subject in the high school, and 
one so-called high-school subject in the elemen- 
tary school. Try them on groups of children that 
will probably need them. Watch the result! It 
40
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
ought to mean increased interest and better 
teaching, and it might result in the elimination 
of useless subject-matter rather than in the elimi- 
nation of practical-minded pupils. 
Third, let us try to select from that which we 
already give, a consciously chosen curriculum for 
those who are not planning to go to college, for 
those who will in all probability leave school be- 
fore graduation. In making this selection, we 
should follow certain standards. (a) No subject 
should be included which cannot be studied with 
profit within a period of two years, the applica- 
tions of which touch in a broad way the life 
of non-professional people. This would at once 
eliminate foreign languages in most sections of 
the country and mathematics other than arith- 
metic and bookkeeping. It would also eliminate 
courses in history which come no nearer the pres- 
ent than the year 1000 A.D., science without ap- 
plications, and English which is formal and aimed 
at college entrance alone. (6) Some sort of easy 
transition should be provided from group to 
group, that those who change their minds may 
not be too highly penalized. (c) Combination of 
41  
-P-A-G-E-50
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the two courses should be made wherever pos- 
sible, since it is financially impossible for most of 
our high schools to provide two entirely separate 
and distinct courses. (d) The students of the 
high school are entering hundreds of occupations. 
It is consequently impossible, except in the larg- 
est cities, to provide specific vocational training 
for all. In the South the only vocational courses 
offered in most of the high schools would be agri- 
culture for the boys and home economics and 
teacher training for the girls. The high-school 
course should be primarily cultural, seeking to 
give the elements common to all vocations and 
to life at home, and vocational only where a large 
number of pupils are planning to enter the same 
field. 
How may we, keeping the four-year organiza- 
tion of our high school, take the next step in the 
direction of better provision for the non-college 
preparatory group? 
The college preparatory course would remain 
much the same as at present, giving work in for- 
eign languages, mathematics, English, science, 
and history. We could organize a non-college 
42
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
preparatory course running parallel, using as 
many of the same subjects as possible. History, 
English, and science would form the nucleus, the 
pupils being together in these classes. The real 
ends of mathematics and foreign languages can- 
not be achieved in two years. The applications 
of the latter, in reading and speaking, come only 
after long, hard study; while the use of algebra 
and geometry is chiefly in their application to 
higher mathematics. Consequently, these sub- 
jects would be confined to the college preparatory 
course. While one group would be occupied with 
mathematics or a foreign language, the other 
could elect agriculture, practical arts, home eco- 
nomics, business or household arithmetic, book- 
keeping, economics, or the like. Each of these 
would have a direct bearing upon the lives of 
the pupils, if properly taught. Each should be 
the means of sustaining interest in the course. 
Each should react to the betterment of the com- 
munity about the school. Such a high-school 
program would appear as follows, the courses in 
common being given in capitals: — ,

Much modification of such a program is pos- 
sible. Many such courses are given. This is ad- 
vanced merely to illustrate the principle. Extra 
teaching force would usually not be necessary. 
Most of these subjects are already given in our 
small high schools. 
Only two matters need attention to make 
the plan efficient. First, better organization is 
44 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
needed to find out the plans and capacities of 
students, that they may be more wisely directed 
at the beginning of their work. Teachers often 
feel that they are doing a service in advising a 
pupil to take Latin or algebra, when there is but 
little chance of that pupil ever going to college. 
In most cases such advice, instead of a service, 
results in a real injury. It puts the pupil into 
abstract work. It discourages interest on ac- 
count of remote ends. It too often throws a pupil 
on the world not prepared as he might have been. 
On the other hand, a pupil, wisely directed into 
the general course, may, at its completion, be 
encouraged to remain longer in school, and by 
a little extra work satisfy the college entrance 
requirements. 
Second, the teacher must apply the principles 
of the Cycle System to the work in English, his- 
tory, and science. He must keenly realize that 
he is responsible for the final education within two 
years of more than half the members of his class. 
He cannot wait four years to achieve results. 
This will cause a change in method and subject- 
matter. The science teacher will be compelled

to bring out the greatest things in his field which 
people need to know, and apply them in class. 
When history teachers realize that those pupils 
who drop out as well as those who continue will 
be voting in six years, and running the country 
in two decades, it is hardly probable that the ma- 
jority of pupils will be doomed to know ancient 
history better ;than modern problems. Civics, 
Industrial History, Community Industries, or 
Modern Political Problems will not be strange 
names for the first-year high-school work in his- 
tory in the future. In English, there will be more 
enjoyment of good literature and less dissection, 
more letter-writing and oral composition, and 
fewer treatises on “What I Saw on my Way to 
School,” or “Spring.” ‘Such a radical point. of 
view would do no harm even in the college pre- 
paratory classes. 
These steps toward the articulation of the ele- 
mentary and secondary school may be taken in 
greater or less degree in every school system of 
the United States. Many have already taken 
them. All can try them next year. It will be 
highly worth while for us to take every opportu-

nity to strengthen the bonds that already exist, 
to experiment cautiously in the adaptation of 
subject-matter to the real needs of pupils, and to 
introduce a break in the course better to serve 
the pupils who drop out. This done and the 
results of the experiments spread abroad, our 
schools will be in much better position to take the 
second step toward the adoption of the six-and- 
six plan, or the twelve plan, or whatever scheme 
may prove to be the ultimate and ideal solution 
of the difficulties of organization of the program 
of studies.

Ir would be possible for us both to lengthen the 
time devoted to study and to organize the pro- 
gram of studies on more efficient lines, and yet 
effect no great economy if our methods of teach- 
ing were to undergo no improvement. The easi- 
est source of economy, yet the most intangible, 
lies here. We should have to convince no super- 
intendent, win over no school board, change 
vitally no program of studies, and yet effect great 
economy if only our teachers were to teach in a 
more efficient way. In certain features of method 
the foreign schools excel. 
In the German secondary school the instruc- 
tion hour is divided roughly into three parts: a 
review of the previous work, consideration of the 
topic for the day, and the assignment or consid- 
eration of the next day’s lesson. The teacher 
speaks slowly and distinctly. There is no repe- 
48
-P-A-G-E-57
  
IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUCTION 
tition. But one thing is taken up at a time and 
that little is done well. In the assignment, usu- 
ally fifteen minutes in length according to the 
estimate of one observer, the lesson is covered 
carefully, mistakes guarded against, pitfalls 
pointed out, the problem carefully outlined and 
explained. Everything is made ready for close 
and efficient work at home. This, of course, saves 
a great deal of the pupil’s time, and is at bottom 
one of the reasons why the German boys are 
able to carry so many hours of work per week. 
With our present system of page assignment and 
of recitation, meaning the recitation of work at- 
tacked in blind fashion in the bustle of the study 
hall or under unfavorable conditions at home, I 
doubt if it would be possible for our pupils to pre- 
pare more work. It is not claimed that the Ger- 
man form of assignment is the best possible, but 
it is far better than the take-the-next-sixty-lines 
plan in vogue in our schools. In general, in the 
high schools of the United States there is no such 
thing as an assignment meaning the first step in 
good mental work. 
Another element in method economy effected 
49
-P-A-G-E-58
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
by the foreign schools lies in the correlation of 
subject-matter. In Germany all the work is uni- 
fied about one idea, ‘Germany is the greatest 
nation in the world, and it is going to be greater.” 
The vernacular and the modern languages, sci- 
ence and history and geography, are all tied up 
with each other and with the other subjects of 
the curriculum. The teacher of German may as- 
sign a composition upon the Latin that has been 
translated at the last hour. It is not unusual for 
a history class, for instance, to spend time upon 
the technical elements of a chemical discovery, 
the effect of which has been to advance the cause 
of the Fatherland. The teacher is so thoroughly 
familiar with all the work that the class before 
him has had, that he can draw without delay 
upon all their previous work. The teacher will 
come to a point, such as the “‘wheat industry in 
France,” in connection with a study of the geog- 
raphy of the land. ‘You remember two years 
ago you studied the wheat plant in Naturkunde. 
What conditions are favorable to its growth?” 
The class recalls the point and the lesson pro- 
ceeds. That much time, at least, has been saved. 
5° 
 
-P-A-G-E-59

It advances the lesson. It reviews previous work. 
The most striking instance of this use of previous 
work is in the history work in the French lycées 
(see above), where the basic notebooks and topi- 
cal outlines used by the advanced classes were 
prepared when the pupils were little fellows in 
the lower classes. This economy depends upon 
two factors: a highly organized course of study, 
the knowledge of which the teacher may count 
upon, and teachers sufficiently well trained to be 
familiar with more than one subject, and inter- 
ested enough to be acquainted with the work of 
the rest of the school. 
The foreign teachers are very well trained. 
The agrégation in France, the mark of the expert 
scholar and teacher, is more to be desired than 
fine gold; while the examination for the Ph.D 
degree in Germany is far less difficult than the 
teachers’ examination. There, teachers must 
qualify in four subjects, two majors and two 
minors. Versatility is a prerequisite. 
When the higher work is planned to build upon 
that already done; when teachers are masters of 
related subjects as well as their own; when they 
51 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
are thoroughly familiar with work in other and 
previous classes, — then and then only can corre- 
lation of subject-matter be more than a phrase. 
To establish it in this country will require enor- 
mous effort, better-trained teachers, a contin- 
uous curriculum, and a new point of view. It 
ought eventually, however, to effect an appre- 
ciable saving of time. 
The greatest economy in methods of teaching 
in the German secondary schools, however, lies 
in the fact that they consistently and continu- 
ally contribute to the end that they have in view. 
The tremendous efficiency of the German nation 
in industry in times of peace, and in solidarity, 
patriotism, and unity of purpose in time of war, 
rests upon an obedient, God-fearing, patriotic, 
self-supporting, unthinking proletariat guided by 
an efficient, progressive, thinking, privileged bu- 
reaucracy. The elementary schools train chil- 
dren to follow. The secondary schools train chil- 
dren to follow. It is only in the universities, free, 
lax, and undisciplined, that the boy, selected on 
account of his ability, may do as he pleases, vary 
as his capabilities, tastes, and inclinations allow, 
52
-P-A-G-E-61
  
IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUCTION 
and express his own individuality, that the na- 
tion as a whole may progress. The leaders are the 
result of constant elimination. New ideas come 
from the top. The great mass has but to follow 
and obey. The secondary schools provide the 
tools which are to be used in the pursuit of later 
work. But the secondary schoolboy “learns,” 
he does not “study”; + he follows, he does not 
lead. Wholesale adoption of German methods in 
the United States, instead of effecting economy, 
would work great harm. Such imitation — and 
indeed we have too much of it — works contrary 
to the real need of the democracy in which we 
live. Efficient teaching in the secondary schools 
of the United States will come partially as a re- 
sult of better-trained teachers, partially from a 
new idea of the function of the recitation, and 
partially from a sensible correlation of subject- 
matter; but the real economy, arising from the 
accurate arrival at the ends which our democracy 
demands, will come only when our teachers real- 
ize that the governmental experiment, started by

studieren to the university.

the founders of the Constitution for a select 
group, and extended to all the people by Jack- 
sonian Democracy, will result successfully only 
when our schools all along the line turn out men 
and women able to think for themselves, capable 
of meeting situations upon the plane of reason. 
All of us are to share in the government. All of 
us in a relative way are to be leaders. Economi- 
cal education in the United States of America 
can only be directed at such an end. 
Method, in the educational sense, is the term 
denoting the process whereby a certain portion 
of the heritage and achievement of the race is 
consciously transferred from one generation to 
another; and its fundamental factors are the child 
as he is and the child as we wish him to be. The 
economical method is the one which certainly 
and efficiently changes the former into the latter. 
Efficient method demands, upon the part of the 
teacher, (1) exact ideas of the pupil as he ought 
to be in the future, or reasonably definite aims ; 
(2) as complete a knowledge as possible of the 
pupil as he is, both as to the knowledge and hab- 
its already acquired and his ways of learning; 
54
-P-A-G-E-63
  IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUCTION 
and (3) a sensible and practical application of 
this theory to actual schoolroom conditions. We 
need progress in all three directions. 
Modern literature on the teaching of history 
in the secondary school advances, among others, 
the following purposes for its teaching: History 
is designed to strengthen the reason, to train the 
judgment, to train in the selection of essentials, 
to train the imagination, to train the memory, to 
provide culture, to give one the historical atti- 
tude of mind, to give one many-sided interests, 
to cultivate enthusiasm, to train in written ex- 
pression, to train in oral expression, to give a 
method of work, to give one the ability to use 
books, to cause intelligent voluntary action, to 
teach how to study, to organize facts, to broaden 
the mind, to explain present conditions, to give 
one the power to see into the future, to train 
morals, to set up high ideals, to build character, 
to give a basis for ethical judgment, to give one a 
love of truth, to train for citizenship, to inspire 
patriotism, to make for international peace, to 
provide for the leisure period, and to give one a 
body of facts. A similar collection is possible for 
55
-P-A-G-E-64
ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
almost every other subject. A certain lady spoke 
before the National Education Association as 
follows: — 
I dare to cherish the hope that by this earnest, 
conscientious work of making notebooks, these chil- 
dren are learning the fundamentals of citizenship; 
thoroughness, accuracy, breadth of view; the power 
of neatness; the power to analyze; the power to con- 
struct; the power of sustained expression; the power 
of system; the power to carry out a plan; the power 
to look beneath the surface of an event for its cause; 
the power of suspending judgment; the power of pa- 
tience; the power of efficiency; the power of truth. 
Each of these aims undoubtedly has value. In 
all probability some few of them may be achieved. 
Yet the very fact that we are contented to aim in 
so many directions at once, and test our success 
by asking a pupil to recite facts, indicates not only 
that we do not know where we are going, but also 
that we are not on our way. 
This is because we do not know the way in 
which children learn. Traditionally there was no 
inconsistency in aiming for all at once. So long 
as there was firm belief in formal discipline, in its 
56 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUCTION 
extreme form, it was believed that any work 
sufficiently difficult, pursued in a thorough and 
faithful way, would help to fill the reservoir of 
wisdom, to be drawn upon at will in any direc- 
tion which the individual might need. Psychol- 
ogy has not entirely disapproved of formal dis- 
cipline. It does not deny all transfer of training. 
Because work in marking A’s, typewriting, add- 
ing, solving puzzles, and formal grammar has not 
been productive of great results in other lines, it 
does not prove that Latin or mathematics or his- 
tory may not have wide transfer. It does point 
to the probability, however, that where such 
transfer has occurred, the result is due to com- 
mon elements of some sort. One can readily see, 
taking this conception, that the elements most 
likely to be common are habits of work, methods 
of attacking problems, and ability to handle evi- 
dence, rather than specific bits of subject-matter 
which as a rule have their lonely place. The old 
work-in-any-way-you-please-so-long-as-it-is-hard 
plan undoubtedly yielded habits of concentration 
and methods of work suited to bookish learning, 
and often gave in this way splendid preparation 
57 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
for bookish teaching in college. But preparation 
for translating ancient tongues in college is not 
necessarily preparation for life, particularly life 
in a real democracy where every citizen must 
bear the burden of leadership in some form, and 
where the whole philosophy of the State lies not 
in coercion by the few, but in the rational codp- 
eration of all citizens in the affairs of life. The 
greatest element, common to all walks of life, 
which our schools must give, is the ability to do 
one’s own thinking for one’s self, to analyze and 
to solve without delay the many problems which 
are continually confronting each and every one 
ofus. The old theory believed that thinking abil- 
ity was secured through any sort of work that 
was hard; and it confused ability in formal col- 
lege work with leadership in life. The new theory 
believes that thinking ability is secured by having 
problems to think about, and many of them, and 
that, curiously enough, all thinking is tied up 
either with that which arouses your curiosity or 
that which is immediately useful. We think only 
when we have a problem; a “challenging diffi- 
culty” is the purport of Dewey’s work, a problem 
58  
-P-A-G-E-67
  IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUCTION 
the solution of which is worth while to us. The 
new psychology and sociology applied to educa- 
tion turn our attention away from the dim and 
distant future to the present, away from broad 
general values to specific uses. They break down 
the walls of the classroom and let the wide world 
in. We need discipline. No economy can be 
effected without that. But no longer is there a 
dualism of general training on the one hand and 
specific training on the other. The general train- 
ing that is of worth to us comes through the 
specific. 
This in turn has led us to a questioning of the 
real value of the subject-matter which we teach. 
No matter how long we go to school, no matter how 
perfectly our curriculum is articulated, no mat- 
ter how efficient our methods in a formal sense, 
no real economy can be secured if the knowledge 
and training given ate not connected with real 
uses in the world at large. “Uses,” as shown 
above, do not mean the bread-and-butter-work- 
with-your-hands theory. Anything is useful 
which will contribute to the earning of a living, to 
the prolongation of life, to the proper perform- 
59
-P-A-G-E-68
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ance of the duties of citizenship, to moral and 
religious uprightness, and to the proper spending 
of the leisure period. 
After a survey of the number of pupils taking 
various subjects in the secondary schools of Mas- 
sachusetts, Horace Mann remarked in 1842: — 
Can any logical reason be assigned why algebra, a 
branch which not one man in a thousand ever had 
occasion to use in the business of life, should be stud- 
ied by more than twenty-three hundred pupils; and 
bookkeeping, a subject which every man, even the 
day laborer, needs, should be attended to by only a 
little more than half that number? Among farmers 
and road-makers, why should geometry take prece- 
dence of surveying, and among seekers after intellec- 
tual truth, why should rhetoric have double the 
number of followers of logic? 
Many thinkers on secondary education from 
Montaigne to the present day have expressed 
similar views. 
It is not intended here to criticize the subjects 
of our curriculum. The methods used are the sub- 
ject of attack. Formal discipline turned our eyes 
away from use in the broad sense: modern in- 
6o
-P-A-G-E-69
IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUCTION 
vestigation and theory emphasize it more than 
ever. Latin has great use for the pupil, provided 
that the teacher knows what it is, and provided 
that he approaches the subject with the firm de- 
termination to show his pupils that use. If we are 
to have Latin in the curriculum, more of it should 
be taught. The average pupil gets the tool and 
then never does anything with it, nor does he real- 
ize the by-products that he has secured. Mathe- 
matics or English or history or science can be 
taught so that something will come of them. 
When teachers adopt the modern point of view, 
and put it into practice, certain changes will 
surely come. Phases of subjects, long useless, will 
be dropped. New phases of subjects, old and new, 
will be added. It is highly necessary that we 
teachers keep our eyes and ears open to possible 
economy in this direction, never forgetting the 
unfortunate boy or girl who must leave school 
early. This will eventually prove to be the great 
economy in our education. 
Suppose, however, that the teacher has inves- 
tigated the possible values of his subject; grant 
that he has made a careful study of psychology; 
61
-P-A-G-E-70
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
assume that he is resolved to allow his pupils to 
think. He plans to search out applications of his 
subject, to approach it from the real needs of his 
pupils, to allow them to weigh values for them- 
selves, and to encourage an individual approach 
on their part. He goes back to his old school. 
There is the same unwilling, immature, apathetic 
pupil accustomed to be Jed, to be treated as a 
machine. The old course of study is still on the 
desk. The college entrance examinations hang 
darkly in the distance. The principal is likely 
to walk in at any moment. Parents are apt to 
object, useful work being ofttimes the supposed 
function of the delinquent, truant, or negro 
school. How shrunken become the theories of 
the educator! How small the investigations of 
psychology! How attractive the dictates of tra- 
dition! 
The practice of generations cannot be changed 
at once. We cannot transform our methods in a 
day. A combination of our common sense and 
our ideal must be our guide. At first we cannot 
hope to make everything immediately useful; but 
we can save a little from the wreck. Mathe-

matics teachers are beginning to tie up their work 
with modern homes and industries and are try- 
ing to meet the needs of business life. Science 
pupils are learning, and what is more, are apply- 
ing the principles of personal hygiene. The pink 
stomachs of the physiology books are giving way 
to the inspection of local food, milk, and water 
supplies; and measures are being taken by high- 
school pupils to prevent the spread of disease. 
Some high-school boys can fix electric bells. Oc- 
casional English pupils learn in class to enjoy 
Shakespeare and Burke. History pupils are be- 
ginning to read the newspapers, and can speak 
almost as intelligently of the latest presidential 
messages, or the European war, as they can of the 
progress of the Federal League or the latest fash- 
ion hints from Paris. Immediate ends give point 
to our work. We can tell where we are going and 
test for our success. If remote ends seem worthy, 
as undoubtedly they are, we are almost sure that 
immediate ends are way stations on the route. 
Our first step in the improvement of methods lies 
in knowing where we are going; the second, in 
being sure to be on our way. When the opportu- 
63

nity offers, as it will to every thinking teacher, we 
can temporarily omit the old routine, and begin 
as a group to search out the solution to the prob- 
lem which has challenged us, giving the members 
of the class opportunity to do the same sort of 
mental work that they will so often be compelled 
to do in later life. A better knowledge of facts 
should result. In addition, the class will know 
their application. This done, occasionally, we 
may proceed to further refinements of method, 
necessary for a complete program of economy in 
education in a democracy.

ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION AND 
THE COLLEGES 
For the past century the colleges and universities 
of the United States have exerted a profound in- 
fluence upon our secondary schools, and to-day, 
in a sense, the college limits and regulates the 
possibilities of the schools preparing its students. 
When the colleges demanded fourteen or fifteen 
units for preparation, the secondary schools met 
the demand. If the colleges were to encourage 
economy, the secondary schools would be much 
more likely to make provision. The colleges of 
the United States have the alternative either 
of moving forward progressively, accepting with 
good grace their share of the responsibility of in- 
stituting measures of economy in the schools, and 
encouraging high schools to do their part; or of 
hanging back, resting on tradition, waiting to have 
forced upon them reforms introduced into our 
65 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
schools by courageous and progressive secondary- 
school men. 
The system of admission to college by exami- 
nation has had the conspicuous advantage of en- 
couraging boys and girls to test their ability when- 
ever they feel prepared. The result has been thus 
to encourage exceptional pupils to enter college 
before the average group, and in this way time is 
saved in preparation for professional life. The 
system of admission by certificate, with its in- 
spection of schools and standardization of work, 
despite its many advantages, has had the oppo- 
site effect. It has tended to pour all high-school 
pupils into the same mould. Still, the colleges to- 
day are not hard and fast in their requirements. 
Able boys and girls, jealous of their time and zeal- 
ous in their search for just reward, complete their 
courses before schedule time, and receive credit 
for this extra effort by the colleges. But such 
reward comes only to the pugnacious individual 
who fights for his rights. To incorporate in the 
admission by certificate system the outstanding 
advantage of the admission by examination sys- 
tem, will require of our colleges some special em- 
66
-P-A-G-E-75
ECONOMY AND THE COLLEGES 
phasis in their requirements encouraging econ- 
omy, and in advertising credit for the adoption 
of measures pointing toward it. 
The first question which arises is: Will the col- 
leges grant increased credit for longer terms of high- 
school work, or will they still demand for their cer- 
tificates four years, regardless of length? School 
boards will hesitate to lengthen school terms on 
account of the attendant expense; but if colleges 
fail to grant recognition for such work, the hesi- 
tation will be much more justified. The problem 
is not so much one of expense as of expense with- 
out adequate return. The same question arises 
in connection with the summer high school or the 
work at camp. This should be designed, not only 
for the boy who has failed, but quite as well for 
the boy or girl who wishes to get ahead. - Dull 
pupils have elected this work in the past largely 
because they have been the only ones to receive 
recognition for it. Will our colleges, therefore, 
favor the admission of boys and girls to college who 
have done additional work of an approved nature 
im summers, no matter whether they have remained 
four years in high school or not? Will this be of 
67 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
service to the pupils? If so, how can it harm the 
schools? Or may our colleges safely grant advanced 
credit for such work? If our bright pupils are to 
enter professional life as well trained as the Ger- 
man or French boys, and at ages nearly similar, 
it is evident that either our colleges should 
encourage earlier entrance or the length of the 
pre-professional college course should be short- 
ened, possibly by the grant of advanced credit. 
Not only should the colleges allow this when it is 
forced upon them: they should encourage it! 
The usual program for high-school boys and 
girls comprises four important subjects a year 
for four years, yielding approximately fourteen 
or fifteen units. Bright pupils, dull pupils, stupid 
pupils, gifted pupils, genius, and fool, all go 
through the same grind. If, as is true in other 
aspects of human nature, there are wide varia- 
tions, is it not probable that certain highly gifted 
boys and girls may be able to carry five courses 
with less strain and effort and more success than 
certain dull pupils may be able to accomplish 
with three? Students who finally enter college 
are a select group. Is it not likely that of this 
68
-P-A-G-E-77
ECONOMY AND THE COLLEGES 
number many will be of unusual ability? Will our 
colleges frankly recognize differences of ability by 
advertising that they will accept fourteen or fifteen 
units made by exceptionally successful students in 
less than schedule time? Or is it better for the 
college to throw the whole responsibility on the 
high-school principal, who should encourage the 
pupils to try the entrance examinations at an 
early date? Some plan should be adopted where- 
by our leaders may enter professional life at an 
earlier date. 
The six-and-six plan, or one of its modifica- 
tions, will probably come in time. Its adoption, 
however, would be greatly hastened if college 
men were to stamp their seal of approval upon it. 
In the United States to-day some state univer- 
sities admit students who have completed fifteen 
units of work beyond the seventh grade; others 
admit students who have completed fifteen units 
beyond the eighth grade. Despite the full year’s 
difference, there is no distinction made between 
candidates from either type of institution in the 
graduate schools of our universities. There is an 
inconsistency here. Many advocates of the six- 
69
-P-A-G-E-78
  ECONOMY IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 
and-six plan believe, with the reorganization of 
courses in the seventh and eighth grades and the 
introduction of a continuous, unbroken course of 
study, that full college preparation can be made 
by the close of the eleventh grade. On the 
strength of this, will our colleges favor the state- 
ment that they will accept especially capable stu- 
dents who have completed five years of high-school 
work beyond the sixth grade? In most of the States 
of the Union this would effect a saving of time. 
In a few, where compulsory education begins 
with the sixth year, and where there are but seven 
elementary - school grades, the time element 
would not be changed. But the benefit to college 
preparatory work, with five years in which to do 
work now done in four, would be of great impor- 
tance in added thoroughness and in the possibil- 
ity of introducing new subjects better calculated 
to the needs of American children. Our colleges, 
favoring such a plan, and publishing their ap- 
proval, have within their hands the best possible 
instrument for moulding public opinion and con- 
vincing school boards of the worth of the scheme. 
The time has come when educators in the 
7o 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  ECONOMY AND THE COLLEGES 
United States should look beyond their own spe- 
cial institution, not to criticize or to pass the re- 
sponsibility to others, but to search out means 
of being of service. Our colleges and universities 
have within themselves, through their privilege 
of accrediting, inspection, examination, and pa- 
ternal approval, the power of profoundly influ- 
encing secondary schools, and of helping them in 
a program of economy.

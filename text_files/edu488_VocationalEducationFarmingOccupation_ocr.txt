PREFACE 
Every State in the Union now has organized into its sys- 
tem of formal education a program of vocational education in 
agriculture. The influence of the Federal Act for Vocational 
Education, passed in 1917, has tended to give such programs 
common elements of likeness. Some of those to be found are 
the following : 
1. That instruction and training in agriculture are set 
up for the purpose of preparing pupils for “ profitable 
employment in agricultural pursuits.” 
2. That such instruction and training are based upon 
the assumption that pupils enrolling for them are to pursue 
agricultural occupations. 
3. That teaching is designed to meet the needs of pupils 
of an age of not less than fourteen years who are not en- 
rolled in institutions of college grade. 
4. That the agencies of instruction are schools of sec- 
ondary grade under public control. 
5. That the course of instruction involves teaching of 
the technology of agriculture, and the direction of the work 
of pupils in vocational undertakings during six months, at 
least, of the year in which instruction is offered 
In all the programs of vocational education in agricul- 
ture, then, is implied a philosophy of social purpose in 
organization, and an organization contributing to the 
achievement of that purpose. To a discussion of that im- 
plication the following chapters are devoted. Briefly and 
plainly stated, the major questions considered are these: 
a. Why do we attempt vocational education in 
agriculture ? 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-8
  8 PREFACE 
b. What principles shall govern us in the setting up of 
an organization to select and prepare pupils who look to the 
field of agriculture for vocation? 
c. By what means shall we determine the content of in- 
struction for such pupils? ’ 
d. How shall we make such content effective in the 
lives of those pupils? 
Or stated in another way, the volume is given to consid- 
eration of the purpose, the content, and the method of 
vocational education in agriculture under rational organization 
of the public high school as the agency of education. 
It is the writer’s hope that the discussion of such prob- 
lems herein offered may stimulate the thinking of public 
administrators in the school system, of trainers of teachers of 
agriculture and their students, and of teachers in service who 
are looking to professional improvement in their field of 
teaching. Upon their well considered action depends much 
more than the survival of the agricultural schools. Through 
them chiefly can be brought to the public the significance of 
enlarged opportunity for the prospective farmer.

  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN 
FARMING OCCUPATIONS 
CHAPTER I 
AGRICULTURE AND VOCATION 
AGRICULTURAL instruction and training set up for the pur- 
pose of preparing pupils for “ profitable employment in agri- 
cultural pursuits” are classed as education for any of the 
vocations within the category of agriculture. It is certain, 
however, that among states and among agencies within states 
different interpretations are given by administrators, teachers, 
advisers, farmers, editors and others interested in the prob- 
lem, to the terms agriculture and vocation. 
It is to be remembered that though definitions “ set 
boundaries ” of meaning, yet those boundaries are in human 
affairs, at least, zonal rather than linear. It is not possible to 
define exactly human activities for the reason that viewed in 
one light they carry meanings different from those given in 
another. The merit of definition is to focus attention upon 
one or another aspect. 
Both agriculture and vocation are human activities. In 
defining either activity we may consider both the objective 
and the subjective aspects. 
The Meaning of Agriculture.—Agriculture—agricultura 
—is first of all the cultivation of the fields. As such it is an 
art composite of manipulative skills in the control of plant 
and animal life to the production of utilities for man. 
AnArt.—Objectively actual physical movement is the basis 
of agriculture. Mechanism, regardless of intelligence or con- 
13 
   
-P-A-G-E-14
    14 AGRICULTURE AND VOCATION 
sciousness, is the determiner of objective results. A self- 
active and self-adaptive mechanism, imagined as pursuing 
the operations of selection, tillage, protection, management, 
and distribution might be quite as effective in producing corn 
and beef as the most intelligent of farmers. 
But no such mechanism exists or is likely to come into exist- 
ence except as the physical and chemical determinants of life 
apart from man may be considered such. Skillsdonot reside in 
machines or in the inorganic world, marvelous as the processes 
of such mechanism may seem. Skill is predicated upon aware- 
ness, selective adaptation to purpose more or less definitely 
conceived. Even in that degree of automatization brought 
about in the simplest processes of art by long habituation, sub- 
conscious selection plays a major part. Ina complex of skills 
as broad in range as that required for effective production of 
agricultural utilities, the subjective aspect is of great 
importance. 
A Technology.—Obvious as it is that no emotion, feeling, 
thought or attitude of a human being will in itself influence 
the growth or behavior of plants or animals, yet experience in 
the art of agriculture has developed not a technic only, but an 
organized body of knowledge of causes, laws, effects, in 
short, of principles known as the technology, or sometimes as 
the science of agriculture. Strictly, this organic knowledge 
is a subjective process eventuating in the direction and guid- 
ance of the agricultural skills. Objectively it makes itself 
evident in speech, print, and action, having to do with the dis- 
semination of knowledge. Such, for instance, largely is the 
agriculture of colleges and governmental departments. 
A Life.—The pursuit of an art and the use of a tech- 
nology are forms of human experience. As such they have 
come, through the cumulative effects of tradition, formal 
education, and the actual experience of living men, to affect
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE MEANING OF VOCATION 15 
the attitudes, emotions, thoughts and behavior of groups and 
individuals to such an extent as to give character, both social 
and personal, to their lives. Thus meaning and action sig- 
nificant in human affairs apart from occupation are colored 
and given direction by character derivative of occupation. 
Such is probably the inner significance of Doctor Davenport’s 
definition of agriculture as the “ mode of life” of those who 
dwell upon the soil and from it gain a livelihood. 
Thus are pointed out three phases of that group of human 
activities known as agriculture. A rounded conception must 
include them all. Yet, assuming the necessity for education, 
each phase tends to direct attention to a different means to 
successful agricultural education. Roughly it may be said that 
the art conception is behind the “ farm and trades ” school of 
reformatory and charitable institutions, the science conception 
behind the technical school, the life conception behind the 
“ country life school,” as types of instruction. All these types 
have been or are recognized as means to vocational education. 
Plainly then, some adequate conception of vocation is neces- 
sary to the equalization of educative opportunity. 
The Meaning of Vocation.—Let us examine what ap- 
pears to be a common sense definition of vocation given by a 
college student. “A vocation is a specialized undertaking 
for the sake of a livelihood. A livelihood consists in the 
wherewithal to provide food, shelter, clothing and to satisfy 
the wants of life.” Yet we hesitate to grant vocations to the 
squirrel and woodchuck. Robinson Crusoe hunting goats, 
picking fruits, gathering staves on the beach, basking in the 
sunshine, was pursuing specialized activities to satisfy the 
wants of life. The Andaman islander rolling over stones to 
pick the grubs and lizards from beneath is engaged in an 
undertaking that satisfies the requirements of the definition. 
But if these be vocations then is the woodchuck forever en-
-P-A-G-E-16
16 AGRICULTURE AND VOCATION 
  gaged in vocation. In fact the whole life of every sensate 
being is a constant succession of specialized undertakings for 
the satisfaction of wants physiologically fundamental and 
other. Yet we distinguish vocation from other aspects 
of life, certainly; from leisure, recreation, worship, and a 
score of other categories of human activity. A farmer may 
be a farmer at the ball game, when he sleeps, at breakfast, in 
church, but he is not a farmer by virtue of the fact that he is 
engaged in his vocation. He is spectator or player, snorer, 
feeder, worshipper, in each case according to the special pur- 
suit for the satisfaction of wants in which he is engaged, but 
in no case given is he occupied with his vocation. 
The Congress of the United States in promulgating “ An 
act to provide for the promotion of vocational education ” has 
not, so specifically as did the college student quoted, attempted 
to clarify the meaning of vocation. The stated purpose of 
vocational education, according to the act, is to “ train persons 
for useful employment whether in agriculture, trade and in- 
dustry, or home economics.” Employment is not of necessity 
the activity of an employe under the act. Consequently it can 
have little more definiteness than “being busy or active.” 
Useful means contributory to the satisfaction of wants. Thus 
so far as “useful employment” helps to understanding, a 
five-year-old child engaged in swatting flies might be engaged 
in a vocation, agricultural if in his father’s barn, trade if in a 
plumbing shop, industrial if in a factory superintendent’s 
office, home economics, if in the kitchen. Even the word 
“ profitable” occasionally appearing does not clarify the 
meaning of vocation, since the housewife is admitted to voca- 
tion under the act, if not under the census regulations. 
Productive Service of Exchange Value.—From the 
objective viewpoint, vocation is not possible under an en- 
vironment not social. The beginnings of vocation appear in
-P-A-G-E-17
  
  A CALLING 17 
the division of labor in the self-dependent family unit. With 
the development of individual and group interdependence 
under tribal organization, vocation becomes clearer; in the 
highly diversified, specialized and integrated economic organi- 
zation of society to-day, definition is relatively easy, yet not so 
much so that agreement in understanding can be postulated, as 
seems to have been the assumption in the Federal act. Socially 
regarded a man’s vocation is that specialized activity or group 
of activities whereby in commodity or service he produces a 
surplus of utilities beyond his own needs in that particular 
field of wants, and through that surplus by exchange, formal 
or informal, commands the surplus of utilities produced by 
others necessary to the satisfaction of other wants of his own, 
if not completely, yet in part. Or by direct activity in produc- 
ing utilities for others his vocation satisfies indirectly certain 
or all of his needs. Thus the housewife is admitted; the 
gambler, the burglar and highwayman are excluded. Such is 
probably the nature of “ useful employment” “ for” which 
vocational education is designed. 
A Calling.—But the subjective phase of vocation seems to 
have been left out of consideration in the statement of the 
federal act, in the promulgations of federal board, and in the 
conceptions of vocational education put forward in the plans 
of some states and institutions. Elihu Burritt “made his 
living ” as a blacksmith, but put his heart, and his soul, and 
his intellect into philosophy. Socially his vocation was shoe- 
ing horses, philosophy his avocation. But psychologically his 
vocation was philosophy, blacksmithing an incidental, if 
necessary, means to the pursuit of that vocation. For vocation 
is first of all a calling, a summons of the spirit, a central 
interest motivating to activity. If socially vocation need be 
no more than work, yet psychologically it can be hardly less 
than play. 
2  
-P-A-G-E-18
    18 AGRICULTURE AND VOCATION 
Ideally, then, vocation conjoins productive social service, 
exchangeable in value, with intrinsic subjective value, satis- 
fying in itself. Conscription of labor, social and economic 
pressure may drive to the fields and factories unwilling, half- 
hearted workers, who can never in the subjective sense pursue 
vocations there. The true farmer is he who is farmer at 
heart as well as in action. 
Agricultural Vocations.—Vocations in agriculture, then, 
are intrinsically satisfying specialized undertakings in the 
control of plants and animals, instrumental directly to the 
production of utilities for society, instrumental indirectly 
through exchange to the satisfaction of needs of the producer. 
Perhaps the child swatting flies in the barn may, for the time 
being, have found a central interest, perhaps even, he may be 
engaged in production; but the element of exchange is lack- 
ing, and probably the element of surplus, since, when he has 
killed flies enough to satisfy him he will quit. 
But custom and tradition come in to limit our classifica- 
tion in agricultural vocations. The commercial florist, the 
horse breeder, are admitted, but the dealer in cut flowers, the 
livery man and the auctioneer are not. Probably we must 
come back to the soil. Agricultural industries are primarily 
extractive or have to do with the production of raw materials. 
Those raw materials may be carried to the finished state of 
consumers’ goods by the producers of them, and the activities 
of finishing be recognized as agricultural. If given final form 
value, time value, or place value by others engaged primarily 
in such work, they are not agricultural. But custom prevails. 
Cotton ginning is not an agricultural pursuit because the cot- 
ton grower sets up and mans his own gin. Delivery of milk 
is agricultural when the farmer delivers his own, but railroad- 
ing is not agriculture even when an association of farmers
-P-A-G-E-19
  
AGRICULTURAL VOCATIONS 19 
builds a spurtrack and holds title to its own refrigerator cars. 
Nevertheless the major vocations in agriculture in any given 
region are usually readily to be determined. The really 
troublesome questions in “‘ vocational agricultural education ” 
have rather to do with the classification of various skills and 
knowledges directly or indirectly contributory to success in 
those vocations. A clear conception of the meanings of voca- 
tion and agriculture will go far to help in the solution 
of difficulties.
-P-A-G-E-20
  CHAPTER IT 
THE NECESSITY FOR EDUCATION IN THE 
VOCATIONS OF AGRICULTURE 
Vocational Education as By-product.—The setting up 
of formal agencies for training and instruction in the vocations 
of agriculture—training emphasizing the acquirement and 
perfection of skills; instruction, the acquirement and ordering 
of knowledge to productive use—is predicated, of course, upon 
the necessity for such formal education. But the necessity is, 
by no means, patent to all educators, publicists, or to large 
numbers of well-meaning citizens. The majority of those 
engaged in agricultural vocations, many of whom have found 
a central interest combined with productive service, or success 
in their occupations, have never had any formal education 
designed to lead either to vocational choice or vocational pro- 
ficiency. They have been trained and instructed only in the 
“school of experience,” so far as vocation is concerned. They 
have been educated, it is true, but only through the experience 
incidental to activities organized for ends economic or other 
than educative, as the farm, the home and the community. 
Such formal educative agencies as the school, wherein the end 
is professedly educative, have modified their characters and 
directed their abilities toward objectives among which voca- 
tional choice and proficiency were not numbered. Vocational 
education for them is a by-product of economic and social 
experience, not a product of directed educative experience. 
Under such conditions they have produced throughout 
the history of civilization and still produce a surplus suffi- 
cient to tremendous social development, and in return 
20 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
THE “FELT NEED” FOR DIRECT EDUCATION 21 
have survived as significant and stable group members of 
society. Why, then, the necessity for a formalized vocational 
education in the field of agriculture? 
The “ Felt Need” for Direct Education Now formal 
education in agricultural vocations is not new by any means. 
Sporadically throughout history, it has been used. Greeks, 
Carthaginians and. Romans gave definite attention to it, the 
monastic orders of the Middle Ages preserved the teachings 
of the Romans and developed new technic, particularly in 
agricultural engineering, leaders in the Renaissance and 
Elizabethan periods often received formal instruction, and 
the English, in particular, developed and formally extended 
knowledge of the art and technology of production from the 
soil during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries. Recognition of the significance of education in the 
field culminated in the establishment of the land grant colleges 
of the United States in the latter half of the nineteenth 
century. But a program for the establishment of widespread 
and accessible agencies for vocational education in agriculture 
is new. It indicates a sense of necessity, a conscious need, 
that has not pressed upon society previously, at least in the 
same degree. The need indicates a change or changes of some 
sort. Since human activities are essentially the interaction 
between the factors, man, on the one side, and his environ- 
ment, on the other, such change or changes must have oc- 
curred either: 
A. 1. Ina shift of the incidence of physical factors, 
2. Ina change in social pressure ; 
B. 1. In changed conceptions of social purpose, 
2. In changed characteristics acquired by man, 
3. In changed characteristics of the original nature of 
man; or in one, several, or all of them, so that the 
relative significance of agricultural vocations in 
the scheme of things is not what once it was. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
22 THE NECESSITY FOR EDUCATION 
The argument for formal education here presented is based 
upon consideration of the factors following: 
The changed significance of physical factors, 
. The changed conception of social process, 
The changed demands of society upon agriculture, 
. The changed needs of the agriculturist, 
The unchanged nature of man, 
. The break-down of agencies. 
The Changing Significance of Physical Factors.—All 
human activities find their source in the expenditure of energy. 
That energy is released from stored forms of solar energy in 
part combined and accumulated through the directive efforts of 
man, in much larger part combined and accumulated through 
the ages by biological, chemical and physical agencies wholly 
apart from the control of man. In every process of human 
activity stored energy is released and lost, to the uses of man. 
Handicraft and “ machinofacture,” trade and commerce, give 
to materials new forms, new space and time relations 
appropriate to human use, but gather no new energy. Power 
expended in service, whether in manual labor or in the appli- 
cation of energy released from fuel is used irretrievably. The 
activities of leisure and business result in outgo. Civilization 
implies a tremendous undoing of the work of nature. 
That undoing is cumulative in its effects. The merely 
biologic increment through increase in population is tre- 
mendous; but the increment through development of fuel 
powers and uses of material in industry is relatively greater 
and much more rapid. If we represent by X available sources 
of. energy stored slowly and at an almost imperceptible rate 
wholly apart from the control of man, e.g., coal, petroleum, 
and natural gas; by Y the perceptibly but slowly stored 
sources in small part only controlled by man, e.g., the forests, 
fisheries, game and the organic matter of the soil; by Z the hse anges 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PHYSICAL FACTORS 23 
rapidly stored sources largely under control of man, ¢.g., farm 
crops, then the total available supply for the maintenance and 
development of civilization is X + Y + Z. X and Y certainly 
are being drawn upon at a rate far in excess of their natural 
increase. The value of X must constantly diminish; only 
through economy in use can the rate of diminution be lowered. 
The value of Y is diminishing rapidly, but, perhaps, may be 
held at or near its present level by economy and more rapid 
addition through scientific control. In Z only is there possi- 
bility of increased value. Thus Z becomes an ever more 
significant item in human affairs. 
But maintenance of the value of Z or increase of it is to be 
had only by success in agricultural vocations ; even with Y the 
increment factor is in no small part relative to successful agri- 
culture. For the work of the agriculturist is in the control of 
plant growth to the storage of energy, of animal growth to 
its conversion from crude to usable forms. It is no empty 
boast that farming is the foundation upon which civili- 
zation stands. ‘ 
In terms of energy the success of the agriculturist is 
measured by the excess stored and made available under his 
controlling skill over that expended in control or wasted in 
attempts upon it. This is that energy margin which is of 
such illimitable significance in human affairs. 
Obviously the number of those who may engage in activi- 
ties other than tillage of the soil, even the nature of their 
activities, is chiefly dependent upon the margin of return over 
expenditure in the agricultural group. Upon the ability of 
the farmer to conserve the resources of land area, soil. fer- 
tility, and the earnings of his labor—the value of Z—rests the 
continuance of present civilization. 
Upon the ability of the farmer to adjust his means of 
production to changing conditions and to increase the margin
-P-A-G-E-24
24 THE NECESSITY FOR EDUCATION 
of productivity depends that increase of diversity and 
specialization in civilized life which we call progress, and the 
increasing range of opportunity wherein men may find 
themselves. 
Individually the success of the farmer is measured not by 
the width of that margin only, but by the return in com- 
modities and service which he commands thereby—that 
income which measures the extent of his activities, his per- 
sonal freedom, apart from the demands of vocation, and 
furnishes still a prime motive to production of the energy 
margin upon which the social structure rests. 
The value of Z can unquestionably be increased by in- 
tensive agriculture, perhaps to the highest point. But intensive 
agriculture, in any given state of industry, means, by the law 
of diminishing returns, a lessening of the energy margin, if 
an increase in the energy total. If the entire population of the 
earth should devote its attention to cultivation of the soil, with 
the utmost present skill and assiduity, the total value of Z 
would reach its highest point. But with increasing yields per 
acre, yield per man would go down; the energy margin would 
decrease, and the margin of civilization disappear. It is the 
gain to Z relative to the energy cost of producing that gain, 
which is the significant factor. Yield per man, not yield 
per acre is the measure of successful agriculture in terms 
of democracy. 
A concrete example may be given in the case of the rela- 
tively self-dependent nations of China and the United States. 
In China the yield per acre is three to four fold that in the 
United States. But it requires the pursuit of agricultural 
vocations by eighty-five persons in every hundred to provide 
the energy supply (biological) necessary to the maintenance 
of the hundred. The energy margin is narrow, the margin 
of civilization fifteen per cent. In the United States some
-P-A-G-E-25
SOCIALISTIC 25 
thirty persons per hundred engaged in agricultural vocations 
supply, with relatively small yields per acre, the energy needs 
(biological) of the hundred. The energy margin is wide, the 
margin of civilization seventy per cent. The illustration is 
sufficiently accurate to show the significance of the energy 
margin. Or it will indicate that Z must be increased through 
net increases by the agricultural group rather than through 
gross increase by diversion of producers from other fields to 
the agricultural vocations. Not “back to the land” but 
“better farming ” is the superior slogan. 
The Changing Conceptions of Social Process.—So long 
as an aristocratic conception of society is dominant the sig- 
nificance of the energy margin is not great. Vast numbers 
of men, each producing but a small margin above his own 
biologic needs, can support in a life of the utmost freedom 
the little group of aristocrats who control the sum of those 
margins. Helot-fed Athens, and monarchical Russia are 
excellent examples. And there are those in the United States 
who advocate vocational education in agriculture on the 
ground that it means more farming and more farmers. 
Their conception of society is not far from that of a Romanoff. 
The processes by which the aristocratic conception of 
society have been overset, the theory of hierarchical organiza- 
tion divinely ordained replaced by a philosophy of evolution- 
ary process in society, cannot be detailed in a treatment of 
vocational education in agriculture. But the philosophy of 
society bears so definitely upon the very necessity for that 
education as to make desirable some consideration of the 
prevailing modern theories. These are two: the socialistic and 
the democratic, disregarding all the vagaries, idiosyncracies, 
and idiocies characteristic of the adherents of each. 
Socialistic.—Socialism accepts the evolutionary theorem 
wherein society is the process of individual and group adjust-

ment to environmental requirement, but it holds that this 
process as a whole can be directed and controlled by conscious 
determination of a vague entity called the state itself. This 
“state” may be in practice the “all highest ” with his asso- 
ciates or the self-chosen Lenin and Trotzky, but in theory 
the state is a self-directing unity moving to a consciously 
closer and closer adaptation to a static perfection. The indi- 
vidual and the constituent groups are utterly subordinate to 
state itself ; motive and directing intelligence are as external 
to them as they are to the parts of a linotype machine. Per- 
fect coOrdination is the work of the “ state,” harmonious 
functioning the duty of the parts, which have no rights. 
But the state so organized must have an objective. That 
objective is social happiness, and social happiness is the satis- 
faction of social wants. The means to satisfaction of wants 
lies in the production of utilities. The greater the sum and 
variety of utilities the greater the social happiness. Hence 
efficiency becomes the major factor in the social process. 
Those who set up the sole aim of efficiency are socialists, no 
matter what their profession of political faith. And they are 
advocates, ardent for the most part, of vocational education 
in all industry, including agriculture, for the reason that vo- 
cational education presumably makes for social efficiency. 
The influence of the socialistic philosophy, which is strong 
among us, in all parties political, and among social scientists, 
educators, and the run of men, is obviously toward the 
widening of the energy mafgin, and toward the rapid utiliza- 
tion of the sources of stored energy. Thus the relative 
importance of Z among those sources becomes greater than 
under the social theories of past times. 
Democratic.—Democracy, too, is predicated upon the evo- 
lutionary theorem. The theory accepts the doctrine of 
conscious direction, but with a difference. Consciousness is
-P-A-G-E-27
DEMOCRATIC 27 
an attribute of the individual, an instrument to evolutionary 
adjustment. Thus the directing and dynamic unit is the 
individual rather than the state. The state becomes a medium 
for the individual, rather than a mechanism in which the 
individual is cog, bolt, or pinion. Emphasis swings to rights 
rather than duties. 
For democracy, too, sets up happiness as its objective ; but 
individual human happiness rather than impersonal social 
happiness Individual happiness comes in self-realization 
through opportunity Choice is a factor in opportunity that 
makes placement, however wise, by external pressure or 
authority, a denial of its fulness. But for widest range of 
choice, the widest range of activity, of created wants, must be 
open to all men. Hence the watchword of democracy is 
“equality of opportunity.’ That the ideal has been no more 
realized in practice than that of the socialists is not to be 
denied, but the wide acceptance of the theory is very effective 
in the determination of social process. 
Efficiency, too, is recognized by democracy as in no small 
measure allied with equalization of opportunity, since creation 
of wants as well as the satisfaction of them, comes through 
effective increase of the range and total utilities ; but efficiency 
is not of necessity the major factor; it is a means and cer- 
tainly not an end. 
Democracy urges opening wide all the avenues of vocation, 
that men may find and realize themselves therein. Education 
in the vocations of agriculture is a corollary of democ- 
racy, then. 
But democracy also, obviously calls for the rapid use of 
stored energy in the opening up of activities; it must empha- 
size also the new import of the energy margin; set in new 
proportions the item Z. 
Betwixt these two philosophies modern society marches.
-P-A-G-E-28
    28 THE NECESSITY FOR EDUCATION 
Under their influence it makes ever increasing demands upon 
the irrestorable supply of fuel, upon the partially conservable 
resources of forest, soil, and ocean, and upon the productive 
arts of agriculture, which draw upon the inexhaustible source 
of the sun. As a resultant of new conceptions of social 
process “ better farming ” is more significant to-day than ever 
before in the history of the world. 
The Changing Demands of Society upon Agricul- 
ture.—Modern society differs so faras civilization is concerned, 
from that of earlier days chiefly in the consequences of the 
division of labor upon organization. The remarkable diversi- 
fication and specialization of activity, which characterize it, 
particularly in the economic field, the integral interdependence 
of group and individual activities, have been marked in their 
effects upon the farmer, using the word generically, both in 
terms of demands made upon him, and in terms of wants 
created in him. 
Since the beginning of civilization, society has made upon 
the farmer demands, largely economic ; but the specific nature 
of those demands has changed from generation to generation, 
even, in the latter days of our American civilization from 
decade to decade or from year to year. To list and consider 
those demands in their varying detail and consequences is the 
work of the economist. Important as that work is to the de- 
velopment of vocational education, no attempt to review it, 
except in general terms, is made here. 
It may be apparent that generalization does not indicate 
clearly the changed incidence of economic demand through de- 
velopment of civilization. The categories of economic demand 
upon the farmer are the same under a limited division of labor 
and interdependence as under a highly refined and specialized 
divisionand integration. But thoughtful attempt to givecontent 
to the categories of, say,the demands of tenth century European 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  EFFICIENCY 29 
civilization and present day civilization in the United States, 
upon the farmer, will make evident that incidence, at least, has 
changed. No more than suggestive illustration is given here 
to indicate that evident change has taken place. 
Conservation.—Society demands of the farmer that he 
shall conserve those resources, which it has given into his 
hands, undiminished in usefulness as a means of production, 
when, at any time, he may be required to give them in charge 
of another; undiminished not only in comparison with pres- 
ent demands upon them, but undiminished relatively to the 
demands that a future society may make upon them. Or, to 
borrow the sense of Dean Bailey’s statement, it is the duty of 
the farmer to leave his farm better than he found it. 
In the middle ages the exhaustion of one belt of tillage 
land was compensated by the taking up of a new belt from 
the commons, or even by the removal of the farming com- 
munity to a new location. In pioneer days a new homestead 
could be taken up upon the exhaustion of one already used. 
But aside from reclamation projects of limited extent, that 
resource is atan end. In the middle ages or in pioneer days 
it was no duty of the individual owner to maintain health 
standards among his livestock; now he is legally required to 
report the outbreak of tuberculosis, anthrax, or cholera among 
his animals, and to undertake vigorous preventive or pro- 
tective measures to the most economical preservation of 
that resource. 
Efficiency.—Society requires of the farmer that he use 
the resources of property which it allows him to the full extent 
of his ability, to produce the largest margin of return in useful 
commodities over expenditure that is consistent with conser- 
vation. It lays upon him the duty of farming profitably 
and efficiently. 
The chief means to social control, here, are economic pres-
-P-A-G-E-30
30 THE NECESSITY FOR EDUCATION 
sure, education, and public opinion. To the man who does 
not farm effectively, society denies an income; it urges upon 
him the necessity for efficiency and conservation through 
press, extension teaching, demonstration, by agencies estab- 
lished definitely to that end; in general, if not always in 
particular, it condemns and marks its disapproval of the 
inefficient or the wasteful, as, witness the connotation of 
“cracker,” “ shell back,” “land skinner,’ etc. But there are 
more institutionalized controls direct and indirect, quite in 
contrast with the lack of them in earlier days. Taxation in the 
income tax and inheritance tax forms, if not in that of the 
general property tax, exerts pressure. State and federal 
exemptions, as in the case of forest lands, and aids, as in loans, 
reclamation homesteads, and the like, are designed to further 
efficiency and conservation. Less directly feed stuff, seed, and 
fertilizer regulations, restrictions upon veterinary practice, 
are to the same ends. Aided fairs, exhibits, prize contests, are 
formally organized stimuli to efficiency and conservation. Not 
all of these are new, but in extent, definiteness, and probably 
effect, they have grown. 
Codperative Service.—As a corollary to the duties of con- 
servation and efficiency, society lays upon the farmer the duty 
of discovering and using his own abilities and resources in 
ways which most clearly correlate with the activities of his 
own group and of groups in other industries and walks of 
life. In other words, it puts upon him the obligation of in- 
telligent codperative service. 
Education is the prime means to social control in this case. 
Extension activities, junior project work, farm management 
studies, local demonstrations, “codperation ” campaigns, are 
important factors in the process. But legal control again en- 
forces the new incidence of social demand. Regulations in 
control of the production of milk, the marketing of veal calves,
-P-A-G-E-31
  
THE CHANGING NEEDS 31 
the registration of livestock, standard grades in the marketing 
of products, and scores of others, compel conformity to the 
requirements of interdependence. The range, diversity, and 
strictness of control in the field stand in marked contrast with 
those of earlier days, and emphasize clearly the fact of new 
social pressure. 
Indirect economic control through storage, transport, dis- 
tributive agencies, approaches hardship in cases not infrequent. 
The unpopularity of the so-called “ daylight saving” laws 
among farmers brings out the force of this compulsory 
codperation. The market itself is a primary factor in forcing 
farmers to selective specialization in accord with needs of 
interdependent groups. Whole regions have been made over 
in agriculture by this force alone. The development of 
market gardening in Long Island, of poultry raising in New 
Jersey, of dairying in Wisconsin, will suffice as examples. 
Certainly in degree the influence of social demand through 
indirect economic control is far in excess of that of the middle 
ages or of pioneer days. 
Environment, then looked upon as a complex of external 
determinants to the vocations of agriculture, as objective in 
its nature, has undergone very considerable and significant 
change in recent times. 
The Changing Needs of the Agriculturist—But en- 
vironment may not be successfully dissociated from man in 
the educative meaning. Apart from the life of the individual 
and its meaning to him in terms of experience, neither 
natural objects, nor technic surroundings, nor society itself 
have significance. Indeed, environment is but one aspect of 
the process of modification and adjustment to which the 
individual is the other. Thus, environment is, perhaps, as 
Dewey tells us, best defined as consisting in those situations
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 THE NECESSITY FOR EDUCATION 
which affect the conduct, thoughts, emotions and attitudes 
of men. 
Though such distinction seem at first sight over-refined, 
yet it is of very considerable importance. It is basic to a 
dynamic as against a static conception of agricultural educa- 
tion. Here it enables us intelligently to consider the acquired 
wants of farmers as factors in the determination of the 
characteristics of the agricultural vocations, as elements in 
the situations to which farmers must adjust themselves, as 
conditions in this environmental change, which predicates the 
necessity for agricultural education. 
Commodities.—For the consequences of the division of 
labor among men have not left the farmer, as man, untouched. 
Wants in the economic field have changed markedly with the 
increasing specialization and diversification of industry. Re- 
flection of industrial change appears in the fundamental 
necessities of food, clothing, shelter, as well as in multifarious 
secondary needs ranging to the line of luxury. Flour, cereals, 
sugar, meats, food products of many kinds, even such as in 
their crude form may be raised on the farm, the farm family 
may more economically obtain by devoting their labor to 
other fields than the finishing of consumers’ goods. Building 
materials, fixtures, furniture, utensils, most of the parapher- 
nalia of home may be more cheaply obtained by purchase than 
by direct expenditure of time and effort upon them. The 
day of home-spun and home-made brogans has gone. Even 
sheets, pillow cases, handkerchiefs, napkins, table cloths, rugs 
and carpets are more and more frequently “store goods.” 
On the whole, “ store goods ” and “ boughten stuff ” are better 
and more economical than home-made. The modern farm 
family cannot, literally, afford the time for such work, be- 
cause their labor can be made to count for more in 
other directions.
-P-A-G-E-33
CONTACTS 33 
Services.—In the field of personal service, though the 
farmer remains relatively self-dependent, the change is 
marked. He no longer cuts his own hair or pulls his own teeth. 
Home “doctoring” for all ailments slowly gives way to 
the more efficient and economical service of the professional 
physician and nurse. Yet it is in the felt need for a greater 
range of personal service, rather than in the means to it that 
the influence of changing standards is clearest. 
In the conduct of the farm, dependence upon others again 
stands out. In the construction of barns and outbuildings the 
farmer finds it profitable to employ the skilled mason and 
carpenter for much of the work that his grandfather, in such 
a case, would have done with the assistance of his sons or 
unskilled neighbors. He can buy tools, machinery, equip- 
ment, power, far more economically than by giving his time 
directly to the provision of them. It is cheaper to buy fence 
wire than to split rails, to hire a well driven than to dig a well. 
Seed, even, may be grown and preserved to better advantage by 
another. Though it still remains necessary for the farmer, 
as for few other men, to be a “ jack of all trades,” yet he ap- 
proaches the position of the specialist, who, by giving his effort 
to that thing or those things which he can do best, enlarges 
his command over the service of others. Production for home 
consumption is no longer the objective of farming. The 
farmer’s economy is a money economy, and production has 
become a business. The whole trend of economic development 
in farm life points to increase of dependence and specialized 
effort. The farmers’ need is profit; as that of any other 
business men. 
Contacts.—But wants growing out of the division of labor 
in production of utilities are not confined to new economic 
wants on the part of the farmer. In the categories of wants, » recreational, intellectual, esthetic, “ social ’—in the restricted 
3
-P-A-G-E-34
      34 THE NECESSITY FOR EDUCATION 
sense of need for contacts—there are large fields of new needs 
that have comeas products or by-products of economic change. 
Discussion of these is reserved for treatment under the 
broader aspects of agricultural education. But they serve to 
emphasize the new need of money income. In acquired tastes, 
desires, necessities, the farmer of to-day is not the counter- 
part of his grandfather; much less of the peasant or manor 
lord of the middle ages. 
The Unchanged Nature of Man.—Considering man in 
his original nature as a factor in the changed status of agricul- 
ture, it is agreed by all leading students of human nature: that 
there is no reason to believe that man has changed in the matter 
of native equipment within the period of recorded history.* 
One man is born into the world largely like to another in the 
categories of equipment for adaptation, if vastly different 
from another in potentiality for growth in one or many spe- 
cific characteristics. The fact of individual differences at 
birth,t however, is wholly attributable to the distribution and 
combination of genetic elements in the germ plasm and not 
to any acquired characteristics passed on from parent to 
offspring. We may feel sure that every boy who is born on 
the farm will differ in some respect in capacity from his own 
brother, from the city man’s son, from the son of any man 
born in the year A. D. 1066 or 55 B.C., but that he will not 
so differ because he is born on the farm in this age rather than 
in the city or in another age. At birth the farm boy is not, 
by the experience of his father or mother, blessed with an in- 
creased capacity for development of the attributes of the 
farmer or handicapped in capacity to develop the attributes of 
teacher, lawyer, physician, or mechanic. If he starts life with 
advantage or disadvantage in equipment it is because of 
* Thorndike, Conkling.

THE BREAKDOWN OF HISTORIC AGENCIES 35 
superior or inferior heredity, not because of difference in 
occupation, politics, or any other experience of his parents, 
except as such occupation, politics, or other way of life, has 
proved selective of innate capacity in his parents. In this 
sense every generation starts on the plane of the preceding. 
Thus the necessity for formal education in the vocations 
of agriculture must be founded upon environmental changes 
rather than upon biological variation in the racial endowment 
of intelligence. 
The Breakdown of Historic Agencies.—If the interplay 
of exhaustible resources with demands biologic and economic, 
increasing under social process that is conceived in new sig- 
nificance and directed to new ends, give new import to the 
vocations of agriculture; if new demands upon the agricul- 
turist, new wants created in him by social evolution, have 
changed the problems of vocation for him; if, in capacity for 
adaptation, in intelligence,man has not changed in ten thousand 
or a hundred thousand years, and no human agency other than 
an ideal eugenic control can by any possibility increase the 
norm of capacity; is there not an impasse? Or, if not, may 
not .those agencies of experience wherethrough the farmer 
has maintained himself and sustained civilization be sufficient 
to the present and future exigencies of demand upon him? 
No one can say as yet that the limits of demand have been 
reached ; but that existent demands have not as yet taxed to its 
limitations existing human capacity, seems certain. Develop- 
ment of individual and group abilities under stress, as in the 
great war, reveals no need for pessimism. That man can do 
what he has done is not axiomatic, but that in the present 
status of the world’s resources he can do so, is certain. On 
the other hand, repeated tests, scientifically controlled, par- 
ticularly in the field of psychology, indicate clearly that in the 
case of the normal and superior individuals of the race, who
-P-A-G-E-36
      36 THE NECESSITY FOR EDUCATION 
constitute a probable majority, maximum development of 
given capacity is seldom reached ; that between what man does 
and what he can do, there is a large margin. Thus it appears 
that, though an impasse be conceivable, it is not yet with us. 
The agencies of formative experience by which the 
capacities of men in agricultural vocations have been modi- 
fied in adaptation to the necessities of social life are of 
two sorts: 
1. The informal agencies of farm, home and com- 
munity life, wherein organized activity is undertaken for 
primary ends other than education, but of which education 
is a necessary by-product. 
2. The formal agencies of apprenticeship, school, 
church and like institutions, wherein activity is organized 
for the sake of the modification which it makes in man, or 
the primary aim is educational. 
But division of labor has changed the character of the 
informal agencies. Diversity of activity, specialization of in- 
terest, characterize them to a greater degree than ever. They 
are enriched in their intensity, impoverished through their 
extensity. More definite and more refined are the special 
technics involved, the controlling technology of each, so that 
experience in a specialized undertaking, such as the harvesting 
of grain, effects a more perfect adaptation in skill than for- 
merly was the case. But the range of opportunity within them 
is too great to be compassed under pressure of economic or 
social ends other than educative. The period of least pressure, 
youth, is far too short. A full life time on the farm can 
scarcely bring to development all the opportunities for 
education which exist there. Not all that is worth while that 
may be learned on a modern farm, in a modern home, in the 
modern community, can be mastered by the hit or miss method. 
Farm fathers and mothers used to teach much incidentally
-P-A-G-E-37
  
SUMMARY 37 
and in the course of the day’s work. They can still teach 
much, but proportionately to the need, far less. Further, the 
reduction of farm economy to the business basis makes diffi- 
cult the task of formal home teaching. The community, 
where never have activities been primarily educational, is 
even less likely to prove effective for vocational education. 
Apprenticeship as a formal agency of education never at- 
tained in the agricultural occupations the truly institutional 
status that it achieved in the mechanic trades or the profes- 
sions of law or medicine. It was never more than quasi- 
formal, in that the economic ends of occupation determined 
the activity of the learner rather than his educative needs. 
Yet historically, and up to the present, a consciously directed 
apprenticeship, such as served the cobbler, the blacksmith, 
the tailor, the young lawyer reading in the practitioner’s 
office, has in the case of agriculture, taken the form of a more 
or less rigorous experience of farm processes, wherein the 
end was accomplishment, education a by-product. Probably 
the majority of farm lads undergo a like type of training as 
chore boy, farm hand, renter, with gradual succession to 
the place of an aging father. So long as the conditions of 
farm occupations remained relatively unchanged from gen- 
eration to generation, such informal apprenticeship often 
served admirably for vocational training. But its non-selective 
character, its very informality, under the changed conditions 
of to-day, make it largely inadequate. 
The country school has given little heed to the needs of the 
prospective farmer in the vocational aspect, if in any aspect 
whatsoever. It has hardly looked upon the farmer as 
a countryman. 
Summary.—It is evident, then, that viewed statically, 
agricultural production as a resource of physical energy has 
come to a changed significance and import; that in the course
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 THE NECESSITY FOR EDUCATION 
of civilization it is more than ever a determinant; that in 
terms of social demand and individual need the pressure upon 
agricultural producers is greater than ever before. In other 
words, the environmental aspect of life for the farmer has 
greatly increased in complexity and in exigency. At the 
same time no variation in natural capacity has come about to 
enable unaided intelligence to meet the increased demands. 
Viewed dynamically, if life be regarded as an evolutionary 
process, the lesson of history is that environmental change will 
more and more outpace variation in hereditary endowment. 
Vocations, like species and individuals, can survive as long as 
they are fit; they can realize full happiness and service for 
those who pursue them only as they are fittest. The range 
from just-fit-to-survive to perfected-fitness is a wide one. 
Under a social philosophy socialistic, democratic, or social 
democratic, conscious control of the social process must main- 
tain vocation as near to the higher extreme as possible. 
Increased range and perfection of vocational abilities must be 
had. Those, according to the plan already advanced, it is the 
function of education to give. But such a plan implies a faith 
in education. That faith is founded upon conceptions of 
the nature and purpose of education which should be clear to 
him who as teacher or director would assist in control of the 
social process to the achievement of greater human happiness,
-P-A-G-E-39
CHAPTER III 
THE PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF EDUCATION 
The Significance of Aim.—Education in the largest sense 
is nearly synonymous with experience, with the modification 
of conduct, thought, emotion, and attitude that comes of meet- 
ing the situations of life. But, formally, education is ex- 
perience organized to the achievement of ends or aims so 
called. Perhaps a clear conception of his aims is the most 
important asset that the educator or teacher may have. For 
upon the aim he has in view depend the organization of his 
plans, the content and the method of his teaching. A man 
who sets up as his object the putting of a bullet through a 
knot hole in a barn door at two hundred yards is more 
accurately guided in his choice of weapon and technic than 
the man who desires only to make a hole in that door. The 
first needs a rifle of relatively high power and small calibre, 
and a decided refinement in the manipulation of it; the 
second may run to the door and accomplish his purpose with 
the toe of his boot, a handy rock, or piece of fence rail, an 
axe, auger, spike and hammer, or at a distance use spear, 
arrow, pistol, shotgun, cannon. A much larger range of 
material means and variety of physical movements is open to 
him than to the first man. But both men are much more 
definitely controlled and directed than the man who merely 
aims to “do something” to that door. At least they do not 
spit upon it, swear at it, sing to it, or paint it, as the latter 
might do. The third man again is more definitely controlled 
than a fourth who does not know whether he is concerned 
39
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF EDUCATION 
with the door or no. A consideration, then, of the larger 
aims of education is pertinent. 
In the theory of education four statements of aim have 
wide, if varying acceptance. Every formulated statement of 
these four has still a very considerable influence upon the 
organization of systems, schools, curricula, and methods of 
teaching ; every one has its influence upon agricultural educa- 
tion; every one must be used in the evaluation of any given 
plan of agricultural education, or of the generic elements com- 
mon to many plans. 
1. Education has as its aim the “adjustment of the indi- 
vidual to his environment.” 
2. Education has as its aim “ social efficiency.” 
3. The aim of education is “ self-realization.” 
4. Education has as its aim individual “ growth ”—“ the 
continuous reconstruction of experience ” in order to 
“a new and enriched experience.” 
These are by no means inharmonious conceptions of the 
aim of education. A discerning interpreter of each in turn 
will discover the common implications. But each emphasizes 
a phase of meaning not clearly brought out in the others. 
When attention is focused upon the aspect revealed in one, 
without heed to those revealed in others, organization, content, 
and method may be evolved out of harmony with a full con- 
ception of aim and of social welfare. Agricultural education 
has already suffered sometimes in just that way. 
The Aim of Adjustment.—Looking at the aim of educa- 
tion as adjustment to environment the task of the educator or 
teacher appears reasonably to be the direction and control of 
that adjustment. To do so he must first discover the sig- 
nificant features of the environment into which the learner is 
likely to come. Second, he must so organize the objective 
data of that environment as to present a skilful replica in the
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE AIM OF ADJUSTMENT 41 
present of that which may be expected in the future. He 
must make of the school a simulacrum of the life for which 
it prepares the pupil. Third, in case he recognize the sub- 
jective aspect of environment, he must study and come to 
know, so far as phenomena may reveal it, the nature of the 
interests and capacities of pupils. Fourth, he must introduce 
them to the details of this replica of their prospective futures 
in such ways as are most likely to appeal to those interests and 
develop those capacities. In other words, the educator must 
devote himself to organization, curriculum making, and the 
arrangement of equipment and subject matter. That, largely, 
is what schoolmen are doing. As aids they rely upon the con- 
tributions of the social survey, the job analysis, and the school 
survey, on the one hand; of genetic and educational psy- 
chology, tests of intelligence, scales of achievement, on the 
other. If the educator look upon environment as static, he 
may sit back in comfort with the completion of his task, as 
many schoolmen are doing; if he look upon it as dynamic he 
must continually “check up,” reorder his means and pro- 
cedure, as many schoolmen are doing. 
But in either case education tends to be looked upon as 
preparation for the satisfaction of wants to come. Agricul- 
tural education becomes education for the job or jobs of 
farming. If the educator takes the view that neither prog- 
nostication of a boy’s future in vocation nor experience in all 
the details of a complex and constantly changing agriculture 
is possible, he confines himself to the selection of principles 
applicable in the varying complex of jobs, wherever and when- 
ever farming may be carried on. Emphasis on technology, 
uniformity in equipment, content and method, determination 
by general needs, is the result. The state and county special 
schools of agriculture are excellent examples of the workings 
of that philosophy. If he take the view that prognosis of
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF EDUCATION 
particular agricultural pursuits is possible, that any such par- 
ticular vocation is a “ complex of skills ” adapted to relatively 
fixed situations, then specific job practice, variety in equip- 
ment, content and method, determination by “local needs,” is 
the result. The theoretically perfected if practically im- 
perfect, “ home project ” schools are good examples. 
The Aim of Efficiency.—Considering briefly the aim of 
education in social efficiency: In one aspect such efficiency 
consists in the harmonious functioning of the social mech- 
anism in relation to its interdependent parts; in the other it 
consists in the perfect “ functioning of the individual within 
the group.” In both, society, that “ organization” or “proc- 
ss’ which is undying in the midst of death, dominates the 
conception of education. The individual becomes a unit in a 
vast and complex machine, significant in vocation, only as 
contributing to or conditioning the effective output of 
the whole. 
The task of the educator, then, is to learn the structure 
and process of the whole, the structure and active contribution 
of each part to the movement of the whole. Vocational edu- 
cation consists in discovery of those peculiar properties of the 
learner which make him adaptable as wheel, pin, ‘cog, bolt or 
axle; the moulding, stamping out, polishing off, and lubri- 
cation of him; w trial tap or preliminary spin, and the thrust- 
ing of the part into its designated place. Industrial survey, 
job analysis, vocational “ guidance” and specific job prac- 
tice are the foundations to successful vocational education as 
so conceived. It is education “for the job.” Quite perfect 
examples of its working out are found in trade schools; cor- 
poration schools, and much of the “ part-time education ” for 
trade and industry. Agricultural education, even in its voca- 
tional aspects, nowhere as yet exemplifies this partial concep- 
tion, though influential men are working hard to cast it in 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
THE AIM OF SELF-REALIZATION 43 
the mould. The “home project school” of Doctor Snedden 
is strongly affected by this conception of education. 
The Aim of Self-realization—Whether we accept the 
“unfoldment ” theory of Froebel, wherein the perfected self 
opens as the bud into the flower under the showery skies and 
warm sunshine of spring, or the more convincing theory of an 
outreaching central self that takes form and meaning by in- 
corporation of experience with its unity, the aim of self- 
realization in education reveals a new aspect of education, 
and compels a shift in the point of view. For the educator it 
implies distinctly obligation to the individual. He must look 
with the learner rather than at him. Organization, curriculum- 
making, method, are concerned with the opening of oppor- 
tunity to the individual. We may not assign and perfect, but 
only open ways to self-discovery and self-perfection. 
In one phase only is the influence of that aim conspicu- 
ously manifest in the organization of vocational education. 
That is in the provision of a wide range of prevocational 
experience in the schools of certain cities preliminary to choice 
of vocational work in higher schools or courses. Some of the 
junior project and club work in agriculture also contemplates 
this aim. But in federal and state plans for vocational educa- 
tion, particularly in trades and industries and, hardly less, in 
agriculture, its influence is conspicuous by its absence. On the 
other hand among schoolmen, no aim is more commonly 
expressed. Some oppose vocational education of any sort 
because it appears to fail in recognition of this aim; others 
promote the establishment of industrial and manual arts 
courses, home economics and agriculture as means to achieve- 
ment of this aim. But often the resultant courses are of such 
a nature as to be denied recognition by authorities in the pro- 
motion of vocational education. The “ liberalizing” and 
“informational ” type of high school “ agriculture ” formerly 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF EDUCATION 
common in the middle west is a good example, not of what 
such education ought to be, but of what, by many schoolmen, 
it is thought to be. 
The Aim of Growth.—Within the concept of education 
as a means to growth we find an aspect still other. Not only 
is the dynamic, active character of education emphasized, the 
double aspect of environment and the obligation of oppor- 
tunity plainly implied, but that there can be no achieved, 
static, final perfection. Further, education is no longer prepa- 
ration, merely, for a life, an occupation, of the future, but 
education is life now. Education is worth while in itself as 
well as derivative of worth from ends to which in the future 
it may serve. Organization, content and method consist in the 
active pursuit of interests by the learner, the solving of self- 
determined problems by him. The work of the educator is 
to assist in these pursuits and these solutions. And he suc- 
ceeds, notin enabling satisfactions only, but in creating new 
needs for satisfaction. 
Probably no school exists wherein such aim dominates, 
certainly no school of agriculture of which the writer has 
knowledge, but numerous schools are influenced by it, or pro- 
fess so to be influenced. Among them Doctor Meriam’s school 
at the University of Missouri is worthy of note. 
Roughly stated : adjustment may satisfy all wants human; 
social efficiency, all wants social; self-realization, all 
wants individual; but to growth there is no end in the 
satisfaction of wants. To create as well as to  sat- 
isfy wants becomes an aim of education. Otherwise 
the motive to growth is destroyed and growth ceases. The 
“divine discontent ” of the educated man is as true and as 
legitimate a product of his education as his skill in the control 
of affairs to personal and social ends. 
Education in the vocations of agriculture falls of its own
-P-A-G-E-45
  EDUCATION AS TEACHING AND LEARNING 45 
weight if it fail to create needs and desires, not only those 
which it provides means to satisfy directly, but others which 
continuously unroll in the pursuit of the vocation. No school, 
or system of schools, can or should finish the education of 
the prospective farmer. 
As has been suggested, a full and thoughtful interpreta- 
tion of any one of the stated aims should reveal its essential 
implications as consonant with those of any other. Only that 
these important aspects of a common aim may not be over- 
looked in the conception of education has the preceding brief 
discussion been undertaken. Such full conception must 
constantly guide in the establishment of education in the 
vocations of agriculture that shall serve to a realization of 
democracy and human happiness. 
Education as Teaching and Learning.—In another way 
we may look upon education as a formal process of interaction 
between the conscious and purposeful manipulator of environ- 
ment, the “educator,” at the one pole, and the conscious, but 
so far as the aim of education is concerned, not purposeful 
“educand,” * at the other pole. Both are selective agents 
working upon a common medium, the “ subject matter ” ; the 
one with a view to securing action in the other which shall 
modify him in the desired direction ; the other acting according 
to his native and acquired interests, and becoming changed in 
so doing. In a narrower sense education may be regarded as 
teaching on the one hand, as learning on the other. In the 
light of the larger theory we shall direct our attention chiefly 
to that relationship. 
For practical purposes it is well that we look at education 
from still another standpoint, the scientific. Young as it is, 
and relatively small as its achievements may be, educational   
* Adams—Evolution of Educational Theory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF EDUCATION 
psychology does furnish us with at least three principles 
fundamental in an understanding of education. 
Education as Modification —(1) Education consists in 
changes} in the mode of action, thought and feelings of hu- 
man beings. Those changes occur as the accompaniments 
inevitable, if not as the results of physiological process. 
Stimulus received from the external world through any of the 
numerous sense organs with which man has been endowed is 
transmitted through the nervous mechanism to eventuate in 
action, muscular, or possibly otherwise, on his part. Man, 
through the senses, the neuronic processes, and the muscular 
organization, “ becomes aware of something and does some- 
thing about it.” He comes in contact with environment and 
“adjusts ” to it. By this reaction in movement, consciousness, 
emotion, he is changed, so as to be more likely or less likely, 
as the case may be to move, to think, or to feel in a like way 
again in the face of a like situation. The child reaching up to 
the pan on the stove and drawing from it sticky fingers that 
taste sweet when licked becomes more likely to reach for that 
pan again because of his act. If, reaching up for the pan, he 
thrusts his fingers into boiling water, it is equally certain that 
in the presence of that pan and stove another time he is less 
likely to reach up and explore with his fingers than before his 
scalding. Thus, crudely may be illustrated the nature of 
learning. In one respect at least the child is not the same child. 
All education consists in such changes. 
The Specific Nature of Education—(2) All changes 
made by reaction are specific changes. The child above is 
changed in respect to behavior and attitude towards pan-on- 
stove not towards berry-on-bush. The farm boy learns to 
milk the cow by milking her, not by pulling carrots. He learns 
to distinguish Baldwin from Ben Davis by distinguishing 
Saf Dhomdike Education, ©) 0a One oe an a
-P-A-G-E-47
  
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 47 
Baldwin from Ben Davis, not by distinguishing subjunctive 
from indicative, or genus from species. As the psychologist 
puts it, by the stimulus-response reaction “ bonds ” are formed 
between specific stimuli and specific responses. The business 
of the educator is the making of such bonds in the educand. 
What bonds it is desirable to make and how they are to be 
made become his chief problems. 
The Transfer of Training —(3) But recognition of the 
specific nature of education, of the bond unit in the complex 
of educative modification, does not wholly do away with the 
possibility of making through experience of one sort modifi- 
cation usable in experience of another sort. For, reverting 
again to the meaning of environment already discussed, every 
situation of life is a complex involving both the external fac- 
tors of the world, the source of stimuli, and the perception of 
those factors by the individual according to his nature and 
experience. Both the external world in its relations to man 
and man himself are variables, so that no two situations can 
be exactly identical. Nevertheless, since every situation is a 
complex made up of “elements,” two situations may overlap 
in the possession of “ common elements” to a greater or less 
degree ; and bonds formed by reaction to elements in the first 
are usable in the second just so far as the two include the 
same elements. That is, two or more situations may belong 
to the same genus, if not to the same species, and the bonds 
that are generic are usable in all. We know, for instance, that 
practice and improvement in the memorization of columns of 
figures is of very little help to improvement in memorizing 
lines of words, since the two situations are so far different. 
We feel certain that proficiency in swimming is of very slight 
aid to proficiency in singing. On the other hand, memorizing 
a sonnet may be of considerable aid to memorizing another 
sonnet by the some author or on the same theme because the
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF EDUCATION 
two situations have so many elements in common. We feel 
certain that learning to drive a motor truck is of considerable 
aid in learning to drive a tractor made by the same firm, for 
the reason that the two situations are of a genus. 
Briefly stated, the present day conception of “ mental dis- 
cipline” or the “transfer of training” is this: Learning 
achieved by reaction to a given situation is usable in another 
situation only in so far as the two situations are made up of 
common elements. The more definitely two fields of ex- 
perience are of the same genus, the more certainly will training 
in the one function in the other. 
The implications of the theoretical and scientific principles 
put forward in this chapter are of great importance in the 
attempt to formulate a curriculum in agricultural education, 
to the effecting and organization of it, and to indicate method 
usable in in, For there can be no rational and progressive 
growth of practice in agricultural education except it be 
guided by intelligent understanding. The function of philo- 
sophic theory, as developed from experience, the function of 
science as theory grounded in experiment is to guide and con- 
trol practice. Sound theory verified in experience of thinkers 
and scientists, is, probably the most practical asset of the 
trained educator.

CHAPTER IV 
“PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE” 
A “common element” in the organization of state plans 
for education in the vocations of agriculture is the assumption 
of pre-election or predetermination of vocation by pupils or 
for pupils. Such an assumption is undoubtedly necessary to a 
genuinely effective education in such vocations, but, unfor- 
tunately, is not at present fully justified. The effects of 
making it, upon pupils, upon the teaching program, and upon 
the social resultant of vocational education in agriculture, 
are detrimental. 
The Implications of Admission Requirements.—An 
examination of the requirements for admission to schools and 
courses will reveal obvious deficiencies in experience pre- 
requisite to any intelligent choice in terms of interest or selec- 
tion in terms of capacity. Standards of admission to schools 
and courses are by no means uniform, but certain standards 
are of wide prevalence. Among them previous schooling, age, 
physique, farm experience are the most common. 
Previous Schooling.—In the case of high schools satis- 
factory completion of the work of the elementary grades, 
seven in the South, eight in the rest of the country, as proved 
by record of attendance or certificate, is the usual requirement. 
Proof of “ equivalent preparation” through examination or 
by evidence of schooling satisfactory to the principal or 
superintendent may be accepted in lieu thereof. In the special 
schools of agriculture such requirement is not as rigidly held. 
But completion of at least six grades of elementary school 
work or the equivalent is a common requirement. In both 
51
-P-A-G-E-52
    52 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
schools of agriculture and high schools admission may be 
granted to the full curriculum in agriculture or to the course 
of study in agriculture only, to pupils, who, in the “ judgment 
of the principal give evidence of ability to profit’ by the in- 
struction. In practice, evidence of such ability consists in 
demonstration of.a certain proficiency in arithmetic, language 
and other of the “ fundamentals ” of the elementary school, 
usually to the standard of the sixth grade at least. 
Now, desirable as such requirements may be from many 
standpoints, it is obvious that, in themselves they involve no 
necessary experience, vicarious or direct, in the occupations 
of agriculture, or in the life of agriculture, no test of capacities 
or specialized abilities requisite to the pursuit of vocations in 
agriculture. They offer no basis. for intelligent choice on the 
part of the pupil, for intelligent “ guidance ” on the part of 
educators. Indeed they have “ preparatory ” value only in the 
sense that they predicate possession of certain “ instruments ” 
such as reading, writing, and the major processes of arithme- 
tic more or less frequently usable in the formal instruction in 
vocation, and even in the vocation itself. No assumption of 
vocational choice or determination is justified on the basis of 
those requirements. 
Age and its Significance.—Age is another frequent cri- 
terion of admission. The federal act for vocational education 
does not specify an age requirement ; it specifies that instruc- 
tion must be designed to “ meet the needs of ” pupils of four- 
teen or over who are not enrolled in institutions of college 
grade. In practice the effect has been to set a prevalent re- 
quirement of a minimum age of fourteen for admission to 
high school departments of agriculture. In the case of special 
schools a specific age requirement is even more common; the 
minimum set being somewhat higher than in the case of high 
schools. Fifteen, sixteen and eighteen are frequent minimal
-P-A-G-E-53
  AGE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE 53 
ages, sixteen probably the modal age requirement for 
such schools. 
Age, of course, does not determine “the needs of pupils 
of fourteen ” or over, despite the wording of the federal act. 
Age is only a rough index of experience and physique. A 
boy at five, entering into a Rip Van Winkle sleep till the age 
of fourteen, would not awaken qualified by age alone to under- 
take the work of the secondary school. The theory of the 
psychical fruition of powers of “ ratiocination,” etc., with the 
mere onset of puberty has no standing in modern psychology. 
But given two boys of “ normal” capacity, reared in like sur- 
roundings, that one who has attained the age of fourteen may 
reasonably be expected to be possessed of a much wider range 
of the data of experience and of partially developed abilities 
than the boy of six. That is all that may be predicated in that 
respect upon the criterion of age. As tending to set a norm of 
experience it is of value in a general administrative program. 
But, in view of the enormous range of individual differences 
in capacity at birth, in view of the enormous range of indi- 
vidual difference in ability due to the interplay of varying 
capacity with varying environment, its application in the case 
of any individual pupil is futility. A boy of fourteen may be 
imbecile, moron, dull, commonplace, or genius. His age does 
not determine the fact. A boy of ten may have many times 
the developed ability, many times the range of experience of 
his fellow of fourteen. Age does not tell the difference. 
But, accepting an age minimum, as index to a norm of 
experience and abilities, it yet provides no basis either for 
determination or election of vocation. The specific kinds of 
experience, of capacity, of ability, are the determining factors. 
Age gives no key to them. 
Physique and age are probably more closely correlated 
than experience, ability, capacity, and age. But, even here,
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
the range of individual differences is large. It may be that 
the establishment of a norm of physique at a minimum of that 
of the normal boy of fourteen is desirable, and that the age . 
norm may be justified in that aspect. 
Physique.—But the significance of physique either in the 
vocations of agriculture or in vocational education in agri- 
culture is not definitely known. In the entrepreneurial voca- 
tions of agriculture a subnormal physical development is not 
a serious handicap, according to general observation; a 
superior physical development is no dominant factor, accord- 
ing to observation, and to the recent statistical study of Doctor 
Higbie. In the work of the special schools and of the high 
schools no data have been assembled to show that the under- 
sized or underweight lad works at measurable disadvantage 
with his physically superior fellows. If such disadvantage 
exists it has escaped observation on the part of many compe- 
tent supervisors and students of work in the secondary schools. 
In the case of specialized mechanic occupations in agri- 
culture, such as ditching, fencing, stacking, etc., physique 
would appear to be a limiting factor. Not only strength, 
weight, hardihood, but refinement and rapidity of muscular 
control, as with budders, shearers, colt trainers, etc., all of 
which are in part dependent upon physique, appear to condi- 
tion and contribute to success in the “trade” vocations 
of agriculture. , 
Yet specific requirements in the matter of physique are 
relatively rare. In certain special schools a candidate for ad- 
mission must, at least, appear to possess the physical qualifi- 
cations necessary to the accomplishment of tasks set upon him 
in the course of the training offered. But only knowledge of 
the bearing of physique upon success in the vocations of agri- 
culture, and of his own limitations or special qualifications in
-P-A-G-E-55
  LACK OF PREVOCATIONAL EXPERIENCE 55 
physical development can serve in such case to enable the boy 
to make intelligent choice. 
Farm Experience.—More hopeful, however, is the re- 
quirement, much discussed; often advised, but in practice 
seldom used, of a term of actual agricultural occupation under 
farm conditions, or “ farm experience ” preliminary to choice 
of entrance into the vocational school or course in agriculture. 
Many schools, if not all, require, in course or apart from it, a 
certain minimal term of farm experience, but such require- 
ment is not to be confused with the prerequisite experience for 
the sake of enabling vocational choice. It serves many useful 
purposes, but not the prevocational, except, indeed, as it 
changes a professedly vocational course to one really prevo- 
cational. Such a requirement, even if the farm experience be 
uncontrolled by educators, unsupervised, does give a genuine 
experience of certain aspects of vocation, does test to some 
extent capacity and ability and interest, so that, at least, as 
between the vocation in which he has had trial, and others in 
which he may or may not have had trial, the boy can make 
choice intelligent, rather than haphazard and unintelligent 
guess. It works no hardship upon the village or city youth, 
provided opportunity for such experience be opened to him. 
Indeed it increases the likelihood of self-discovery, and a 
genuine self-realization and efficiency for him in vocational 
training. But the provision is so far from prevalent, as not 
to give justification in the case of any state to the assumption 
that the life work of the student in the vocational school is 
definitely chosen at the time of entrance. 
The Wastes Due to Lack of Prevocational Experience. 
—That the consequences of such an assumption would logi- 
cally be waste in time, effort and results, it is natural to 
conclude. No conclusive studies have been undertaken to 
show the existence or extent of such waste. But observations,
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
the conclusions of teachers, school records and administrative 
records of state departments, seem to verify the fact of wastes 
and to indicate that they are not inconsiderable. 
The almost uniform history of the early years of “ voca- 
tional agriculture” in high schools brings: out the fact that 
newly established departments frequently draw upon that 
class of boys known to schoolmen as “ dubs ” and “ drifters.” 
Two causes contribute to the result, the election of the boys 
themselves and the pressure of school authorities. On the 
part of the boys a new course offers an avenue of escape from 
the known discomforts of classes and subjects, with which 
they have experienced tribulation positive or negative, into the 
unknown and possibly hopeful. They elect the agriculture 
more or less gladly, even if they be required to acknowledge 
that they intend to be farmers. On the part of teachers and 
administrators the path of least resistance is the one likely to 
be chosen. The principal or superintendent looks over the 
record of John Robertson. John has not done well in his 
previous school work, or perhaps he is troublesome. John 
evidently doesn’t fit very well into the established order. 
Accordingly John is “ advised ” to take the agricultural course. 
Another common procedure is this : the principal announces to 
his teachers that a new course has been established; he asks 
their assistance in recruiting pupils for it. Will they, please, 
give him the names of boys, and sometimes girls, in their 
classes, who in their opinion might profit by the new course. 
The names come in. Naturally they are for the most part 
those of pupils who notably seem not to profit by the work 
of the respective teachers. This herd is then driven, if with- 
out enthusiasm, at least without reluctance, into the new de- 
partment of agriculture. Such recruiting is not often the 
result of pure evasion. It is undertaken honestly, with the 
conviction that those who have shown a lack of ability, notably
-P-A-G-E-57
  LACK OF PREVOCATIONAL EXPERIENCE 57 
for abstract thinking, will find a possible new outlet for 
energies, opportunity for development of untouched resources, 
in the study of agriculture. Particularly is it a prepossession 
of schoolmen that the student who lacks “ intellectual inter- 
ests ” must have “ mechanic interests”; and “ agriculture is, 
of course, primarily a mechanic occupation.” Thus the 
teacher of agriculture is confronted with a group, at the start, 
inferior in “‘ scholastic ability ” to the run of the school. 
Sometimes those boys, or some of them, do discover new 
interests in the agricultural course, do find there a vocational 
promise, and come through, a proud justification of the 
acumen of the principal who “advised” them to take the 
work. But, in such case, and it is by no means infrequent, 
the question may be raised as to whether the course in agri- 
culture has not been for such boys, in its beginnings at any 
rate, prevocational rather than vocational. 
In most cases, however, if the course in agriculture be of 
good rigorous vocational standard a large proportion of the 
boys so entered fail of advancement, drop out of the course, 
and perhaps out of school altogether. If they remain in 
school, it is as a nucleus of “dubs” and “ drifters” to be 
dumped upon the next teacher of a new department in 
the school. 
With the history of the special schools in this aspect the 
writer is less familiar. But he has received from parents, 
teachers, principals, and superintendents, scores of letters 
asking advice concerning agricultural schools. The purport 
is much the same. Harry is backward in his studies, he doesn’t 
like his present school, he cannot get on with his teachers, or 
there is no hope of his passing the college entrance examina- 
tions. Can you recommend a good school of agriculture? 
Directors of agriculture, in conversation, report that they 
are frequently besieged with the like type of letter. Figures 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
of enrollment in both high school courses in agriculture and 
in special schools often show a marked drop from the first to 
the second or third year of work. It is not a sign of failure on 
the part of schools; it may be a sign of efficiency in the elim- 
ination of misfits. 
Now the misfits waste their own time, and such effort as 
they make. They waste the time and effort of the teacher. 
Often he is compelled to teach two groups in the same class, 
the uninterested and incompetent and the interested and com- 
petent. He even must modify content and method in the 
attempt to find the interests and capacities of boys whose 
interests and capacities, by virtue of their enrollment in a vo- 
cational course, are predicated as already found. The 
genuine vocational pupils suffer from the divided interest, 
from mere incubus. 
Further, the records of alumni and graduates of the few 
schools which are old enough to have such records, show that 
a large number of those who have completed satisfactorily, 
part or all of the course, actually enter into vocations other 
. than agricultural. Such figures are cited by some as showing 
the inefficiency of vocational training. That they do not show 
in any sense. Only they show, either that the so-called voca- 
tional teaching has served to prevocational ends, or that there 
has been no provision for adequate selective opportunity in 
advance of vocational training; virtually, the same thing as 
regards output in terms of social waste. No problem in edu- 
cational administration is more urgent, or perhaps, more 
difficult than that of devising and putting into operation a 
range of selective opportunity for vocational choice, among 
many vocations, non-rural as well as rural, particularly in 
the open country. Prevocational education in agriculture is 
fundamental to successful vocational training in agriculture.
-P-A-G-E-59
SOCIAL FUNCTION OF ELECTION 59 
The Social Function of Election in Vocations.—But a 
basis of social determination or self-selection of vocation in 
agriculture is far more important than a mere means to 
increased efficacy in vocational education in agriculture. 
Some such selection goes on willy nilly in the process of social 
evolution. In a directed evolution, socialistic or democratic, 
a substitution of conscious determination, either external to 
the individual or of his own initiative, affords the most certain 
means to perpetuation of the fit in modes of vocational 
organization and to discovery and adoption of the fitter. For 
social process of evolution is essentially like to biologic. As 
species and varieties evolve through variation, selection, and 
inheritance, so, likewise, through innovation, sanction, tradi- 
tion, do the customs, ideals, manners, standards, conventions, 
institutions, vocations of society. 
For example: (1) Apples have been for years packed 
in barrels. The market buys the apples in quantities at prices 
sufficient to maintain the grower in his vocation. New growers, 
a new generation of growers, profit by the experience of fel- 
lows or predecessors, and pack apples in barrels. (2) Then 
some “ original” fellow dares to try packing his apples in 
bushel boxes. He launches an innovation, a variation from 
established procedure. The buying public welcomes the new 
pack,comes in to buy in increasing numbers and at more favor- 
able prices, gives sanction to the innovation, selects favorably 
the variation. Other growers learn of the method and its suc- 
cess, imitate the method, teach it to their successors ;—by 
tradition—“ giving over ”—from one man to the next, from 
one generation to the next, a new method of packing apples 
becomes a part of the vocation of the apple grower. But (1) 
in order that the barrel packing method be perpetuated, that 
an established feature of the vocation may survive, men must 
go into apple growing capable of acquiring the technic, the
-P-A-G-E-60
  60 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
technology, and the appreciation of that method sufficiently 
to its survival; (2) capacity to originate and to put into prac- 
tice a new method is required, a capacity in excess of the 
minimum for survival, in order that a new and closer adapta- 
tion to marketing needs come into being, that the vocation may 
progress. Thus, crudely, is illustrated the process by which a 
given status in vocation is maintained, a new status set up. 
Now originality, the source of innovation, consists in 
“using old things in new ways.” It implies variation in 
capacity. But no innovation comes of mere capacity. Except 
there be “taken over” the “old things,” the data of ex- 
perience, no new form can be given. We cannot make bricks 
without straw. Thus ability to originate is as truly a function 
of the social inheritance as ability to imitate. The conditioning 
factor, the selective factor so far as capacity of either sort is 
concerned, is opportunity in experience. Under a policy of 
“laissez-faire,” selection is haphazard, wasteful; under a 
policy of conscious social control, selection is purposeful, 
economical. The one implies “trial and error” experience, 
the other directed experience, formal education. (1) The 
certain maintenance of established ways of doing things, 
“standardized solutions” of recurrent problems; (2) of 
discovering and perpetuating new ways of meeting problems, 
in vocation, are the work of vocational education. But survival 
and progress through perfected abilities, are founded upon 
selection of capacities prerequisite to such abilities. 
Capacities Required in Agricultural Vocations.—The 
demands of vocations in agriculture for capacities underlying 
the abilities required for successful pursuit of them, are 
unknown in specific detail, probably never can be known in 
full detail under the postulate that such vocations are in- 
herently dynamic. Nevertheless, it is possible to suggest con-
-P-A-G-E-61
  
CAPACITIES REQUIRED 61 
siderations which may clarify thinking in the problem of pre- 
vocational selection. 
General farming,* dairy farming, fruit farming, grain 
farming, may be cited as exemplifying one class of agricul- 
tural occupations ; egg farming, bee farming, tobacco farming, 
onion farming, as a second; the occupations of stallioneer, 
herdsman, shepherd, drain builder, a third ; of budder, packer, 
shearer, thresher, a fourth. In degree of specialization they 
progress from the first class to the fourth. 
The first two classes are distinctly entrepreneurial occu- 
pations involving the assumption of responsibility, risk, and 
the control of capital. The third and fourth are of the employe 
group, dependent upon the acceptability of service to others, 
and involving less of assumption of responsibility, risk, and 
control of capital. The ability to codrdinate to a common end 
distinct enterprises in production, managerial ability, is the 
prime requisite in occupations of class one. Managerial ability 
is still dominant in class two, but is confined to a less range 
of factors wherein technical skill and technological knowledge 
play a relatively large part. In class three managerial ability 
is subordinate to technical ability, and again to specific 
knowledges. In class four, skill is the prime requisite, knowl- 
edge a less factor, and managerial ability hardly a condition 
of success. 
Or, put in another way, classes one and two are profes- 
sional in their exigencies; classes three and four trade 
occupations, in their demands upon capacity. Dealing with 
the relatively uncontrolled and unstable complexes of ideas 
and men plays a larger part in success for classes one and two 
than for classes three and four, wherein the situations involved 
in the control of “ things ” are predominant. The demand for

    62 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
abstract and social intelligence as compared with mechanic 
intelligence is inverse in the professional and trade groups of 
agricultural occupations. 
To place social intelligence as a factor is much more diffi- 
cult if we set it apart, for consideration, from abstract or 
mechanic aspects of intelligence. Although the degree of 
social intelligence required may in general run from large to 
small in the classes indicated, yet its predominance is not cer- 
tain in any one, except the specific case be examined. In farm 
management the exigencies of profession are more nearly 
those of the engineer than of the lawyer. Ideas and their use 
in the control of mechanic operations figure more prominently 
than intelligence in problems of human contact. Yet as sales- 
man, buyer, foreman or superintendent the entrepreneurial 
farmer must adapt himself skilfully to the human factors of 
vocation. And there are occupations in agriculture wherein 
the abilities dependent upon social intelligence are unquestion- 
ably primary to success. Bargaining ability is founded first 
upon intelligence in dealing with men. The livestock buyer 
and seller must know not only good stock, the possibilities of 
the market and a vast detail, but must be able to deal effectively 
with those from whom he purchases and to whom he sells. 
The foreman of a gang of threshermen much have mechanic 
abilities, to be sure, but he succeeds because he can “ handle ” 
men with skill. The foreman of a gang of pickers, ditchers, 
pruners, qualifies first in his ability to influence men. A 
director may succeed with the qualities of a Seward, a fore- 
man needs something of those of “ Big Tim Sullivan.” But 
the normal American farmer must be thinking machine and 
human being at the same time. 
The demands of occupation for abilities indicate the pre- 
requisite capacities, as they do the standards and requirements 
of vocational training.. We are far from knowing the range,
-P-A-G-E-63
  STANDARDS OF PREVOCATIONAL EDUCATION 63 
scope, or degree of abilities required in the various occupations 
of agriculture; much farther from solution of the elusive 
problems of innate capacities. But it is fairly evident that the 
selective means in use preliminary to vocational education in 
agriculture are not effectively, or even rationally, planned to 
the end of prevocational choice or determination. 
The Standards of Prevocational Education in Agri- 
culture.—An ideal scheme of vocational education would 
open up to every boy and girl lanes of discovery in all voca- 
tions, leading into smooth roads of vocational training, and 
thence into the broad avenues of vocation. To establish such 
a scheme is the task of government and administration. The 
student of vocational education in agriculture is concerned, in 
his contribution to social welfare, with the design and con- 
struction of the agricultural thoroughfares. What, first, is 
the means to prevocational agriculture? 
The entrepreneurial occupations of agriculture, the types 
of “ farming ” exemplified in classes one and two above, are 
by all odds, in America, both in numbers engaged, and in 
social significance, the dominant groups of vocations in agri- 
culture, and probably will continue to be so. Farm manage- 
ment studies reveal the economic effectiveness of the one 
family farm, setting aside any other social implications, as 
still superior to that of corporate farming on a quasi-factory 
basis, or to that of manorial dominance of tenantry, a form 
which is sometimes to be noted in certain systems of renting. 
Foremanship as a vocation is still minor with us, and, like the 
trade occupations in agriculture can hardly develop to include 
significant numbers, except in regions of uniform type of 
agriculture, as in cotton, tobacco, or fruit areas, under a 
centralized ownership or codperative control—in general 
under what is essentially a plan of manorial or cor- 
porate management.
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
Thus, by and large, the professional aspects of agri- 
cultural occupation take first place. In certain regions they 
become minor so far as the numerical factor is concerned, 
though they still maintain their economic significance. 
For the relative fixity and stability of environment which 
makes possible the agricultural “trade” is attributable to 
managerial control, in very considerable measure. An illus- 
tration is the case of fruit raising communities under asso- 
ciational management. Uniformity in orchard layout is often 
enforced as a means to effective use of specialized labor. Dis- 
tances between rows, form of trees, distribution of varieties 
according to period of ripening or blossoming, and other con- 
ditions are standardized so that spraying, pruning, and 
picking gangs may meet with approximately equal conditions 
in moving from orchard to orchard. 
But, as effective management conditions effective trade 
specialization, so mechanic skill universally conditions effect- 
ive management. There are trade aspects to the work of the 
“general farmer ” though the prime factor in his vocation be 
management. It is because of the uncontrollability of 
weather, season, life processes in plants and animals, etc., and 
of social wants, that farming types of occupation dominate. 
So far as we can now see they must for the same reason con- 
tinue to dominate. Yet the increasing extent of control which 
science and management make possible indicates that special- 
ized agricultural trades will increase in numbers and in degree 
of specialization. The specific skills of the farmer in dealing 
with the trade aspects of his occupation cannot be, and need 
not be, perfected in the degree to which those of workmen 
specialists .can and must be perfected under a quasi-factory 
process of production. Thus, by and large, the trade aspects 
of agriculture must be given second place. 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  REPRESENTATIVE PARTICIPATION — 65 
Selective experience, then, or formal prevocational edu- 
cation must involve: 
1. Responsible management. 
a. In control of production through knowledge, 
b. In control of production through dealings with 
persons. 
2. Mechanic control of : 
a. Plant life (crops), 
b. Animal life (livestock). 
Representative Participation.—The indication, then, for 
test and opportunity of self-discovery of vocational capacity 
or the lack of it in agriculture, is a specific undertaking by the 
pupil, under genuine vocational conditions, of enterprises in 
production, correlate to a common economic end. This under- 
taking must call for and develop abilities, in technic and tech- 
nology that are common, in their essentials at least, to many 
vocations in agriculture. In other words the undertaking must 
be ‘representative, or typical. Out of the undertaking will 
arise problems calling for observation and participation in 
agricultural work, for the establishment of first-hand mean- 
ings or data of experience, for practice in agricultural work 
to establish instrumental skills in the degree necessary for 
carrying out the undertaking; for technological information 
necessary to the intelligent direction of skills; for the active 
organization of data to the ends of related enterprises; and 
for managerial ‘codrdination of enterprises to the central 
economic end of the undertaking. For the sake of economy 
in time and effort the assistance of formal teaching is indi- 
cated, individual largely, but class teaching in part. By class 
teaching, discussion and codperation, not only are new sources 
of data and standards of comparison opened to the pupil entre- 
preneur, but the test of social capacity in addition to that 
5
-P-A-G-E-66
    66 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
furnished by the contacts necessary in buying, selling and the 
immediate labor of production, is amplified. 
The undertaking and the formal training and instruction 
growing out of it must, of course, be conditioned by local 
needs and opportunities. For example, let us take the case 
of a middle western community in which corn is the major 
crop, and the rotation and system of farming turn upon the 
corn crop. Hogs, steers, mutton sheep, are the common types 
of livestock. A good test undertaking would be the earning of 
one hundred dollars’ labor income through the selection, 
mating, housing, management of one or two brood sows, and 
the rearing of a litter of pigs to marketable size as pork. Such 
would not be in itself more than an enterprise in farming. 
To make it an undertaking, in the management sense, corre- 
late enterprises in crop growing, as of rape, clover, mangels, 
corn, for the feeding of the sow and litter would be neces- 
sary. The undertaking would involve experience of a full 
year of vocational work under farm conditions, full cycles in 
plant and animal production, selection of plants and animals, 
nurture of plants and animals, representative work in feeding, 
housing and protection of animals, representative work in 
crops intertilled and broadcasted, use of the common imple- 
ments of crop production, etc., so that a very considerable 
range of tests in mechanic and managerial and thinking 
capacity is furnished. Moreover, those tests are genuine and 
not artificial. The accompanying instruction in swine manage- 
ment, corn and root crop growing, growing of rape and clover, 
involves the induction of principles common to livestock and 
crop production in the region and pretty generally everywhere. 
To extend the range of discovery these principles could be 
carried over to the vicarious problems of father or neighbor 
in raising beef, or mutton, or even poultry and dairy cattle, 
to potato growing, grain growing, hay growing, etc., thus by 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
REPRESENTATIVE PARTICIPATION 67 
verification fixing the principles in usable connections, by com- 
parison and contrast making methods and standards more 
definitely meaningful than is possible through mere book 
study, or even the continual observation and intermittent par- 
ticipation of a well taught prevocational course in “ general 
agriculture ” or “ animal husbandry.” 
But working as a small scale entrepreneur on a farm for 
a year, with developmental teaching in respect to the technic 
and technology of agriculture, if it furnish the most genuine 
test of capacity and vocational interest, is not enough for pre- 
vocational purposes. We may discover in the boy capacity 
promising for this or that vocation in agriculture; he may 
discover that he likes and can carry on successfully vocational 
work in agriculture. But he has not discovered nor have we, 
that he is fitted for the life of agriculture, except there be 
developed standards of farm life. If possible the farm on 
which he works for the year must be representative of what 
is a normally successful farm home, both subjectively and 
objectively. If it is not, demonstrated vocational proficiency 
proves nothing, for the farmer or worker in agricultural 
vocations must live as well as make a living. Through obser- 
vation of farm homes, participation in rural recreations, first 
hand acquaintance with resources for physical well being, for 
intellectual and emotional enjoyments, social contacts and per- 
sonal service in the country, discrimination in choice is far 
more accurate. Here, too, books, lectures, pictures, informa- 
tion are undoubtedly of value in opening up the lanes of 
discovery as to the possibilities and limitations of a life 
vocationally centred in agricultural production. 
It is not to be doubted that in many instances boys brought 
up to share in the work and responsibility of good farms, in 
good homes, and in good and progressive neighborhoods have 
had a sufficient prevocational experience, so far as agriculture  
-P-A-G-E-68
  
  68 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
goes, to enable them to enter upon truly vocational study and 
training without loss of opportunity and with every prospect 
of profit. But because many farm boys have not had and can- 
not have, under family control alone, the chance to test their 
capacities in agriculture, to understand its opportunities, and 
to discover the implications it has as a mode of life, something 
of formal prevocational teaching in agriculture must consti- 
tute a part of a democratic system of education in the 
open country. 
The Place and Agencies of Prevocational Agricult- 
ure.—The place and agencies of formal prevocational 
experience in agriculture remain briefly to be discussed. The 
function of the elementary school is first to find and enlarge 
that common basis of experience which enables us, as con- 
scious of one another’s likenesses to communicate, in the 
second to provide and to perfect the instruments of inter- 
communication necessary to social life. These are the funda- 
mentals upon which the acquirement of prevocational or 
vocational experience must rest. How the present elementary 
school succeeds or fails in curriculum or method cannot here 
be discussed. Nor will argument as to the time necessary to 
acquirement of whatever fundamentals may be requisite be 
offered. Just what the fundamentals are and just the length of 
time required for the successful teaching of them no one but a 
confirmed bureaucrat knows. 
However, for the growing conviction among educators 
that six grades allow for proper functioning of the elementary 
school, there seems to be basis in fact and reason. We do 
know that approximately at the close of the sixth year of 
work the program of the elementary school largely loses its 
hold upon pupils and their parents. Then is the time of 
greatest “ mortality ” in the school population.
-P-A-G-E-69
  
JUNIOR PROJECTS 69 
The “Junior High School” Grades.—On the psycho- 
logical side the accentuated self-consciousness of adolescence 
and the consequent group differentiation bring forward new 
interests which further drill in the “ fundamentals ” fails to 
satisfy. The boy becomes conscious of himself as a person, a 
man in the making, and the urge of self-responsibility, of his 
new-found importance, make him less amenable to external 
authority, to benevolent direction of his activity in the same 
worn channels. 
On the social side the increasing share of the boy in activi- 
ties other than those directly controlled by authority of 
teachers or parents creates new wants and new avenues of 
satisfaction and reacts to strengthen the sense of personality. 
Economic necessity urges many directly into earning or 
brings them to the problems of occupation and service. 
For those reasons the commonly accepted period of the 
intermediate grades, seventh, eighth and ninth, seems well 
chosen for the provisions of prevocational experience 
in agriculture. 
The farm and the community of agriculture no doubt now 
furnish the informal media through which prevocational 
experience is had by those who make intelligent choice of 
agricultural occupations or go in for training preliminary 
to those occupations. The merits and weaknesses of the 
informal agencies have already been considered. A formal 
use of these agencies to secure typical experience, involving 
responsible activity and representative scope in vocational 
experience is the first requisite to prevocational selection. 
“Junior Projects.”—In the junior project work con- 
ducted in certain intermediate schools of New York State 
some recognition of the need for effective use by the school 
of farm, home, and community, is evident. That, as at present 
carried on, the work does not entail, in the confining of re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
    70 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
sponsibility to a single enterprise, sufficient managerial 
experience to be adequate as a selective method, seems prob- 
able. Probably, too, in many cases the formal instruction of 
the school is too dispersive and informational in kind to prove 
most effective in selection of capacity for knowledge. And 
it is by no means a general prerequisite to vocational training 
in agriculture. But an extension of the prerequisite and in- 
tensification of instruction seem to be the chief means to 
provision of an excellent prevocational work. 
“Elementary Agriculture.”—The required “ elementary 
agriculture ” of the seventh and eighth grades in several states 
is, at present, a very ineffective means to self-discovery in 
vocation. Because of the organization of program and 
schedule, the almost inevitable incompetency of the over- 
loaded woman teacher in this particular field, and the pre- 
scription by state manual of a dispersive and smattering 
subject content, it resolves itself naturally into formal text 
recitation sometimes accompanied by piddling efforts to the 
use of school and home gardens. 
The “ general agriculture ” of the first year of the high 
school is in like case, though a greater competency is to be 
found among teachers. 
Work of both sorts as conducted by a well-trained 
teacher of agriculture travelling from school to school under 
the title of “supervisor”? seems more promising. But here 
the dispersive content, the single enterprise, if any, remain 
fairly constant. Intermittence of instruction and the over- 
loading of the supervisor with so many “ projects ” that any 
continuous and effective supervision is impossible, are charac- 
teristic at present. 
Club Work.—Club work, so-called, has sometimes proved 
very effective. It is on the whole far less dispersive and in- 
formational than the “ general agriculture ” type of instruc-
-P-A-G-E-71
  TESTS 7 
tion. But it deals with narrow projects, often of a piddling 
and “ nursery ” sort, in which responsibility on the part of the 
pupils is largely absent. Moreover, such enterprises are mainly 
chosen, not because they are representative, but because they 
seem to be an expedient means to “ putting across” a “ pro- 
gram.” The instruction is intermittent and irregular, the 
number of projects so great that even the most diligent and 
competent leader finds his “ supervision ” confined to impulse 
to a start and persuasion to record of the few who persist to 
the end. At its best, club work is excellent prevocational edu- 
cation in agriculture; in general, it is not prerequisite to 
vocational training and has little effect in determination of 
choice of such training. So long as it remains apart from the 
public school system and sets up for a few men and women 
the vague and impossible task of educating the children of the 
countryside in “head, heart, hand and health,” it is hardly 
likely to prove effective from any prevocational or voca- 
tional standpoint. 
The Public School—To reach all the boys and girls of 
the countryside, prevocational education must be the work of 
the public schools. That, ultimately, the school system will 
take over the machinery and much of the personnel of the club 
work agency, organize it to the selection, effective supervision, 
and regular instruction of pupils in typical responsible vo- 
cational undertakings under normal and hopeful country life 
conditions, is probable and desirable for the provisions of 
lanes of discovery in agriculture. 
Tests.—Mental and physical tests of capacity, as they 
grow in scientific exactitude, may constitute useful accessory 
means to “ guidance,” if they can never be complete bases of 
self-discovery. But that they can serve in substitution for the 
actualities of experience is not to be admitted.
-P-A-G-E-72
  12 PREVOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
City Boys.—The provision of such prevocational educa- 
tion in agriculture for city pupils, who under a democratic 
conception are quite as much entitled to it as country pupils, 
is a difficult, but not an impossible matter. A part time use of 
farms accessible to the city, with continuous undertakings, 
and periodic residence requirements in group rotation, seems 
a feasibility, though it involve a breaking up of the ironclad 
schedule and program characteristic of centrally directed city 
systems and an increase in the tax allotment for transportation. 
Both in country and city the contention must be met that 
the placing of managerial responsibility upon boys of a tender 
age is ignis fatuus. (1) “ They must first be developed to 
the point of responsibility.” (2) “We cannot impose upon 
them the task of management until they have had preliminary 
training in the affairs to be managed.”’ The first objection is 
based upon an exploded psychology. There is no “ faculty ” 
of responsibility, which ripens at adolescence or any other age 
or point of development. The second ignores the facts of 
daily life, the “little mothers” of the cities, the soprano 
voiced news venders and bootblacks, the youthful “ business 
men ” of city and country who support, not themselves alone, 
but mothers and sisters, in a thousand different occupations 
involving responsibility and management, from office boy to 
dairy farmer. The boy scout leader, the play director, the 
good school principal, daily proceeds upon the theory that to 
test and develop capacity for responsibility, for management, 
he must make the pupil responsible, let him manage. And it 
works. No more is it to be assumed that “ seventh graders ” 
cannot assume responsibility, cannot manage, than that they 
cannot reason. The studies of Doctor Bonser and others have 
refuted the contention as to reasoning ; the growing acceptance 
" by experienced teachers and administrators of such standards 
of good teaching as those of McMurry carries refutation of
-P-A-G-E-73
  CITY BOYS . 73 
the contention that young pupils cannot assume responsi- 
bility, undertake real management. If they cannot now, 
according to all that modern psychology teaches us, then they 
never can. It is upon this postulate, that the test of ex- 
perience is based. These two capacities are primary determi- 
nants of fitness for the major vocations of agriculture. Except 
we open opportunities for discovery of these, then “guidance ” 
and “ prevocational education” in agriculture are verily 
ignis fatuus. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  CHAPTER V 
THE PLACE OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN 
AGRICULTURE 
The Secondary School.—It has been noted that voca- 
tional training in agricultural occupations is “designed to 
meet the needs ” of pupils of fourteen or over not enrolled in 
institutions of college grade. This fact indicates a recogni- 
tion of existing formal agencies of vocational education in 
agriculture—the land grant colleges—and of the necessity for 
vocational education among great numbers and several groups 
to whom the colleges are not or cannot be accessible. It indi- 
cates, too, recognition of the place and functions of the ele- 
mentary school ; that by common consent the period of life and 
the place in the school system set apart for secondary educa- 
tion are appropriate to the provision of vocational education 
for the mass of the people. 
Such agreement, if not founded on scientific data yet seems 
rational in the light of experience. The secondary school age 
is the period of life during which economic pressure begins 
to make itself manifest to most individuals, yet it is a period 
in which such pressure for the majority does not demand com- 
plete absorption in earning. It is the age before marriage, 
during which ability to pull his own weight in the economic 
boat or to lend a hand at the oar is all that is required of the 
normal boy. It is a period of great plasticity and of relative 
freedom from social demands and from the constraints of 
fixed habits, attitudes and interests; the age betwixt de- 
pendence upon the efforts of others, and dependence upon self 
for support, in which the parental apron strings are loosened, 
74 ;
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE DEMANDS OF AGRICULTURE 15 
the bonds of economic society are not yet drawn close. Thus 
it is the period par excellence, at which the state, for the sake 
of economic efficiency and individual growth in vocation, can 
most certainly and most safely look to the provision of voca- 
tional training. 
The Demand of Industry.—Under an ideal system of 
prevocational education, administrators would have knowledge 
of individual promise and be enabled to group and classify 
pupils according to the training by which they would most 
profit ; individuals would be guided by interest to intelligent 
choice and make demand for appropriate vocational training. 
At present, however, administrators are guided in the estab- 
lishment of schools rather by the demands of industry for 
workers, than by the demands of individuals or groups for 
training in industry. The demands of industry must always 
be an important and conditioning factor in the determination 
of vocational training. It is conceivable,in a state of ignorance, 
that more might desire training in a certain vocation than 
industry could use; but an adequate system of prevocational 
education would do away with such a possibility. Industry, 
on the other hand, might demand training for more than 
possessed either capacity or desire to fit themselves for a given 
field. What overcrowding or dearth may be in a given field, 
it is difficult, as Doctor Snedden* points out, to define. But the 
cry of “exploitation” will never die down, nor the voca- 
tional schools be filled with pupils, until a clear demand for 
certain types of vocational training is made by youth and 
harkened to by those who administer the machinery of 
the state. 
The Demands of Agriculture——At present, however, 
there is a strong trend in agricultural education toward ex- 
tending facilities for education in agricultural vocations to ,   
* Snedden—V ocational Education.  
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN AGRICULTURE 
those who may wish to profit by it. Agriculture does not 
make the specific and insistent demands for workers put forth 
by industries through manufacturers and merchants. We are 
not yet accused of attempting to fill through vocational edu- 
cation the labor needs of hiring farmers. But we see clearly 
that agriculture and society would profit by more skilled labor, 
more intelligent management, and further, that in the fields of 
farm skill and enterprise are open many ways to success and 
happiness for those who are now denied them. Agricultural 
educators, then, are looking to the discovery of needs 
existent on the part of possible learners to be satisfied 
by establishing forms and agencies of vocational education 
in agriculture. 
That, probably, is the chief reason for the number and 
variety of schools and teaching agencies to be found in the 
present development. Such, of course, must take their final 
_form according to the specific educative ends which they are 
set up to achieve. At present they may be regarded for the 
most part as agencies tentatively “reaching” for various actual 
and hypothetical groups of pupils to whom they may appeal. 
They are the “feelers” of vocational education in agri- 
culture, rather than the strong and perfected legs upon which 
it. marches. 
High School Departments.—The most wide-spread of 
agencies for the secondary teaching of vocations in agricul- 
ture is “the vocational agriculture department” of the 
public high school, which is found in country, village, town and 
city high schools. It reaches the regularly matriculated high 
school pupil, who has completed the work of the elementary 
and intermediate grades, whether from farm, village, industrial 
town, or city. In its standard four year, or occasional three, 
two, or one year courses in agriculture, it seems, from the 
records of administration, to be most successful in attracting 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
SPECIAL SCHOOLS 77 
and holding boys from the farm. Boys from the village 
enroll in numbers but fail for the most part to persist through 
the full course. Town and city boys enroll in proportionately 
less numbers and show, on the whole, a small percentage of 
stickers. New provision of means to “supervised practical 
work ” by village boys seems to promise a greater effectiveness 
in meeting their needs than has been shown hitherto, but the 
boy from industrial town or city is hardly measurably served 
by the high school department. When shop work becomes a 
minor part of instruction he tends to drop out. 
To reach boys who have not qualified by previous school- 
ing for regular instruction, and boys who have dropped out 
of high school, some “ vocational departments ”} have made 
provision by admission of “ special students” from farms to 
the regular work in technical agriculture. A small number 
have been drawn in by this means, but the effect upon class 
work is often detrimental to both regular and special groups. 
Such departments also have in many instances established 
separate short courses of a few weeks or a few days. Those 
have attracted for the most part rather mature farm boys and 
adults. For the village, town or city boy they seem to offer 
little satisfaction. 
Special Schools.—To the special schools of agriculture 
offering one, two or three years of work, in seasons usually 
accommodated to the demands of farming, and to the “ short 
horn” courses at the agricultural colleges, go many boys of 
vocational experience on farms who have the means to sup- 
port themselves through an extended period of instruction, as 
wellasadults. City, town and village boys also attend, though 
reports of directors and teachers indicate a much lessened 
effectiveness of instruction in their case.   
+ Notably in Indiana and Wisconsin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN AGRICULTURE 
Short courses in special schools and agricultural colleges 
again draw mainly, among those of secondary school age, upon 
farm boys. 
The evening school and the part-time school in agriculture 
exist mainly on paper. No opinion of their attracting power 
can be based on actualities. Short course extension teaching 
by itinerant teachers is in somewhat better case, but the writer 
can offer no factual estimate for their attractiveness. The idea 
of “ taking the school to the pupils” is appealing and results 
should be watched with interest. The all-year-round farm 
school for city boys exists, but not under public auspices. The 
work of the Jewish philanthropic schools furnishes no guide 
as to attracting power, since free board, tuition, and main- 
tenance, are factors not to be set apart from the vocational 
course itself. 
It is probable that, as the military census of New York 
State indicates, there are eight or ten boys of secondary school 
age, actually engaged in farm work, and out of school, to 
every one that is reached by all the agencies enumerated 
combined. Figures for possible pupils in village, town and 
city give no index. But surely in the aggregate the possible 
recruits to vocational education in agriculture is there large. 
So far as prevocational selection goes we have done next 
to nothing; so far as meeting probable vocational training 
requirements in agriculture among those of secondary school 
age goes, we have hardly passed the gates of a great domain. 
Public Control.—The public control of agencies of voca- 
tional education in agriculture which is characteristic of the 
present scheme is, by some, regarded as evidence of “ social- 
istic taint ” in the thinking of publicists, educators, and legis- 
lative bodies. Certainly such control is a logical outcome of 
a theory of state directed social evolution. But, like com-
-P-A-G-E-79
  PUBLIC CONTROL 79 
pulsory elementary education, it finds democratic acceptance 
as the sole and logical means to equalization of opportunity 
in education and in vocation. So long as it be viewed and 
conducted in this light—and not for long can it be otherwise— 
there is no danger of “ Prussianization or Russianization ” of 
American society through such control. The words “ public 
control” instead of “state control” are significant in 
that respect.

ORGANIZATION OF. VOCATIONAL 
TEACHING BY THE STATE DIVISION 
OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
Agricultural Regions.—Nearly every state is divided into 
regions of relative specialization in agricultural pursuits. 
New York furnishes an excellent example of regional adapta- 
tion of types of farming, There are grape regions, apple 
regions, dairy regions, bean regions, hop regions, market 
garden regions, small fruit regions. Soil, topography, climate, 
absence of competing crops, market accessibility and market 
demand are the major factors in determination of agricultural 
regions. The combination of the Dunkirk soils, prolonged 
freedom from frost, and ready accessibility to market for a 
perishable crop have made the grape region of western New 
York. Topography, the distribution of summer rainfall and 
length of season have made northern New York a hay pro- 
ducing region.* Topography, light soils, and accessibility 
have lined the banks of the lower Hudson with small fruit 
farms. A long season, the Fulton loams, and nearness to the 
metropolis have made northwestern Long Island a region of 
market gardens. Such diversity and specialization make 
the setting up of state-wide uniform requirements as to con- 
tent dangerous, even were such requirements based upon the 
requirements of-vocations found within the state. 
Information usable in the definition of regions is already   
* Here is a common type of so-called “general farming.” The 
whole system of diversified enterprises revolves about the hay crop, as 
does “general farming” about the corn crop in the middle West.

SELECTION 81 
to be had. Surveys geologic, topographic, soil surveys, 
climatic surveys, market surveys, and, perhaps most useful of 
all, farm management surveys exist in varying degrees of 
perfection and present desuetude. Census returns of occu- 
pations, farms, acreages, products are clearly usable. Political 
divisions, such as township and county, the base of farm man- 
agement, soil survey, and census returns, do not coincide with 
agricultural regions. Mapping and new statistical summariza- 
tion are necessary for the usable delimitation of regions. Such 
delimitation, it would seem, should be the first step of a state 
department of agricultural education in the undertaking of an 
intelligent development of agricultural instruction. 
Types.—Having laid off the state in agricultural regions - 
the second step, initially possible with the data already in hand, 
is the determination of the types of farming therein carried 
on, with indication of their evident survival and progress + 
values as types. (Here cumulative and historical records are 
necessary.) For the entrepreneurial vocations a good begin- 
ning is already possible; for the specialized trade and unskilled 
vocations the census furnishes but meagre guidance, and farm 
management surveys even less. 
Opportunities.—The third step is the discovery of de- 
mands and openings for participants in the regional occupa- 
tions and the relative accessibility of such occupations to 
newcomers. No exact data are here available, so far as the 
writer knows, but reasonable deductions may be made from 
surveys reporting upon size of farms, capital investment, 
owners, mortgages, renters, labor employed, etc. 
Selection.—The fourth step is the establishment of a sys- 
tem of selective prevocational education in the public 
elementary schools, a study of extension teaching returns,   
+ Using same principle as indicated in criteria of content selection.

82 ORGANIZATION OF VOCATIONAL TEACHING 
existing vocational schools, records of employment agencies, 
etc., in order to determine the numbers and locations of 
those who make demand for training for specific. agricul- 
tural vocations. 
Analysis.—The fifth step is analysis of the static and 
dynamic requirements of vocations for which learners seek 
preparation. Much careful work is to be done here. It is 
doubtful that anywhere we have sufficient accurate data for 
guidance. In the minor occupations we have none; but in the 
major farming occupations some. Farm management studies 
of small numbers of farms in the various occupational groups 
within a region are frequently to be dug out of storage in the 
files of college departments and libraries. Accounting records 
indicate the relative importance of various farm enterprises, 
the effects of managerial ability in codrdination, the frequency 
and universality of certain skill requirements in the actual 
jobs undertaken with horse and man labor, and from these, 
more remotely, carry implications of requisite technology and 
social abilities. If, for each of the regional vocations in agri- 
culture, the state division of vocational education works out 
minimum standards of specific type abilities, according to the 
criteria of content selection set forth in Chapter X, it thereby 
makes its largest legitimate contribution to the course of study. 
Agencies.—The sixth step is in the determination and 
allocation of agencies for vocational training in agriculture. 
Here, of course, the major consideration is the getting of 
teachers qualified for the specific instruction into contact with 
the greatest number in every group demanding a specific type 
of vocational training. A second important consideration is 
the making of that contact under environmental conditions 
favorable to the most effective teaching. Those conditions 
have been provided in the past very largely by an attempt at 
replication in the school of conditions prevalent in the voca-
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE COUNTRY HIGH SCHOOL 83 
tion. The special schools of agriculture, with their large 
farms, varied livestock and cropping systems, and equipment 
in machinery and buildings, are excellent examples of the at- 
tempt to create by artificial means an environment similar to 
that of farming vocations. The frequently unfortunate 
attempts of high schools to establish farm surroundings and 
their still often cumbrous mechanic equipment reflect the same 
purpose. But the conviction that successful training can be 
effected only by the formal use for educative purposes of 
agencies organized to economic ends is growing. It is con- 
firmed by the apparent success of “ part-time” and “ home 
project ” methods of instruction. In that the organization of 
the school farm is based on purposes educative rather than 
economic it tends to fail as a means to vocational education as 
compared with the use of home farms conducted on a business 
basis by the “ project” schools. It is possible to organize the 
school farm, however, on a genuine business basis, though the 
fact that directors and managers are not dependent for their 
income upon an economic organization, as the farmer is, makes 
it improbable that this will be often done. If done, it may well 
be that the school farm is actually more effective, since more 
representative of the vocational type, than any farm of a score 
from which pupils come, is likely to be. But in both its present 
and its probable future norm the special farm school can lay 
claim to no general superiority in teaching environment over 
the public high school or the itinerant school. 
The Country High School.—With boys living on farms, 
or in farming communities where the necessary vocational en- 
vironment is provided, the policy in organization of “ carrying 
the school to the boy ” is superior, in point of reaching num- 
bers, to that of “ bringing the boys to the school.” We have 
the pupil and we have the farm. To bring in the teacher is 
to make a school. A teacher is more readily to be moved than 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
84 ORGANIZATION OF VOCATIONAL TEACHING 
aclass. But there are undoubted economies in class or group 
teaching. If a teacher can by the presentation of a “ situa- 
tion ” once induce definite useful educative activity in a group 
of boys there is certainly decided gain over the repetition of 
that teaching for the isolated individuals. A demonstration 
in pruning peach trees may be desirable for each of twenty 
boys. If the teacher requires an hour to make the demonstra- 
tion, he may set free nineteen teaching hours for other and 
equally useful purposes by meeting the twenty as a class in- 
stead of meeting them as individuals on their home farms. So 
far as boys are sufficiently alike in experience and in capacity 
to respond in approximately the same manner to a teaching 
situation, the economy of class teaching is not to be disputed. 
The facts, however, of individual differences in capacity 
and acquirements make it certain that individual responses 
cannot be more than roughly approximated to one another 
under class conditions, and that in a large proportion of 
instances the human factor in the situation is so far a variant 
as to make response to the class stimulus far from appropriate 
to the teaching purpose. We can and do deal with pupils in 
class as individuals. It is the essential of good method that we 
should do so. But the class gathering is not necessary to that 
end, and may be, particularly in vocational teaching, very 
much a detriment to its accomplishment. Accordingly the 
most effective teaching agency is that which enables the 
teacher to meet his pupils in class groups, where the necessary 
loss by removal from the vocational status of being “on his 
own on a farm job” is at least compensated by the economy 
in class teaching in the particular instance. That is, there 
must be both taking of the school to the boy and bringing of 
the boy to the school. 
As furnishing the medium whereby large numbers of 
boys of capacity indicative of intellectual qualifications for
-P-A-G-E-85
  AWAY-FROM-HOME SCHOOLS 85 
farming vocations may find access to a qualified teacher and 
the teacher in turn to them, we shall hardly devise a better 
than the established country high school. It is near 
many farm boys and they are near it. Setting aside all 
considerations other than effective teaching of the largest 
number,} the present trend to further development of high 
school centres for “ home project ” instruction appears natural 
and right. 
Away-from-home Schools.—But it may happen that the 
boy must go to the away-from-home school for the reason 
that the means to effective teaching of his prospective vocation 
are not to be had close at hand. That is particularly the case 
with the town or city boy, who may from time to time de- 
termine upon an agricultural vocation, and must go to that 
place where favorable conditions for training are to be found ; 
and for the farm boy who determines upon a vocation in 
agriculture other than those pursued in his home community. 
A “home project ” organization fails to meet the requirements 
of such boys, except as they are able to acquire by renting or 
otherwise the “home conditions” necessary to the project 
organization. Candidates for training in the employe groups 
of occupations will probably increase in numbers in the more 
specialized fields, if the trend to specialization and increased 
use of capital in the farming vocations be used to deduction. 
Herdsmen, foremen, threshermen, sprayermen, tractormen, 
pruners, cow testers, etc., as against the farm hand, skilled 
or unskilled, and the more specialized “hands” of orchard, 
market garden, and berry farms, already show demand for 
vocational training. A herdsman may be trained through a

home project, but equally well or better § at a special school, 
the foreman will find the advantages with the special school, 
except in rare instances. For the cow tester, the home 
project may serve, though certification is yet more difficult 
than from the special school. For the others the itinerant 
school moving from community to community and dealing 
with groups therein gathered is probably the most effective 
means of reaching numbers, though the “ short courses ” of 
high school teachers and of the special schools undoubtedly 
have a function here. 
Itinerant Schools.—Even with the entrepreneurial occu- 
pations of agriculture, the farming vocations, large numbers 
are at present untouched and will remain untouched by any 
development of high school departments and special schools. 
Here itinerant schools on the “ home project ” basis are indi- 
cated by the success of present “ extension schools.” 
Schools for Farm Hands.—As for the “hands” em- 
ployed in agricultural occupations, the writer knows of no 
demand on the part of candidates for such jobs for formal 
vocational training. He ventures to predict that no prevo- 
cational system of education will discover any such demand. 
Schools for farm hands have been demanded by manufac- 
turers who see the desirability of cheaper food for their 
employes, by enthusiasts in vocational education who would 
educate formally every individual for the occupation in which 
the world needs him most, and by advocates of efficiency in 
all things, but never by the prospective “ hands” themselves. 
The “ by-education ” of the job itself seems sufficient to meet 
all present and prospective needs in this field. 
Short Courses.—“ Up grading” education for farm 
hands as for practicing farmers and others in agricultural

occupations is another matter. To get a better job, as to make 
better pay from the present job, is a motive to vocational edu- 
cation quite general. Short course and itinerant teaching 
organization probably furnish the means to the reaching of 
the greater number. 
Teachers.—Finally, it is the work of the state division of 
vocational education to see that teachers are selected accord- 
ing to qualifications specifically derived from the specific type 
job which they are to fill, not by mere generalizations as to 
age, farm experience and college education; to see that teach- 
ers are given adequate facilities for the accomplishment of 
the tasks before them—that the present vice to which com- 
munities, with the aiding and abetting of the division, are 
often prone, “loading to the gunwales, and then some,” is 
abolished ; to see that teachers receive frequent, just, intelli- 
gent and constructive criticism in their work; and that they 
find opportunity and encouragement to growth in profes- 
sional efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-88
| CHAPTER VII 
THE ORGANIZATION OF VOCATIONAL 
TEACHING WITHIN THE SCHOOL 
The Basis of Organization —There is frequent in pres- 
} ent school practice the habit of “ taking over ” an “ organiza- 
| tion” of teaching ready-made from another school or one 
. suggested or prescribed by authority. Organization achieves 
meaning only in terms of the end for which it is set up. A 
Hoe press is a wonderfully organized piece of machinery— 
not in itself, but in terms of printing newspapers. It has no 
organization at all in terms of mowing grass or spraying apple 
trees. To have a true teaching organization a school must 
have aims from which that organization is derived. The more 
specific those aims the more effective may the organization be 
made. A superintendent once wrote to the state supervisor : 
“We are ready to teach agriculture. I have in sight a young 
man, graduate of an agricultural college, who has for four 
years successfully managed his father’s farm. I can hire him 
for twelve months and allow him one-half of the school day 
and a room of his own. If we establish a four-year course, 
shall we have the approval of the state?” A two days’ visit to 
the school revealed the fact that but two boys were at all 
interested in taking an “agricultural course.” They were 
mildly curious to know whether there was a “ decent show in 
that game” (agriculture). The proposed “ organization” 
took its only meaning from the end of obtaining state support 
and approval. It had no meaning at all in terms of vocational 
training for boys in that community. 
Now if that superintendent proceeded to find out what 
88  
-P-A-G-E-89
THE CYCLE OF PRODUCTION 89 
boys accessible to his school planned to follow agriculture, to 
what vocations they aspired, he might reasonably call on 
the state supervisor for help in determining what skills, 
knowledges, and social abilities are required in those vocations. 
With those definite aims in view the two could make intelli- 
gent answer to the questions: What shall we teach? What 
room do we need? What time must we allow for the teach- 
ing? What kind of a teacher do we need? What shall be 
his teaching year? etc. Out of these aims might be derived a 
meaningful organization for vocational teaching. To making 
such specific aims discoverable to school superintendents and 
others, the state department should largely give attention. 
The Length of Course.—The length of course is a fre- 
quent bone of contention. “ Shall we teach two years as they 
do in Missouri, or four years as they do in New York?” 
The daily allotment of time is another equally troublesome. 
Should it be four periods, three, two, or one? Until we have 
definite content aims and a knowledge of the normal learning 
period to achieve each of those we can do little more than to 
guess at the answers. 
If the aim of a course is to teach mowing hay with a 
machine, evidently no school year is needed. If it be to teach 
pruning peach trees the same is true. If it be to teach hatch- 
ing chicks for “ day old” market, the problem of course and 
daily time allotment is quite other than in the case of dairy 
farming. Hence a hard and fast “course and day require- 
ment” of time is quite as likely to be wasteful as the 
requirement of uniform content in “the course in voca- 
tional agriculture.” 
The Cycle of Production.—But there are certain stand- 
ards which help us to judge in the matter of time requirements 
for training to particular agricultural vocations. In the farm- 
ing vocations, there is the so-called “cycle of production,”
-P-A-G-E-90
en en ee nt rm 
90 TEACHING WITHIN THE SCHOOL 
with crops and animals. From seed to sale is a variable, from 
three weeks in the case of radish and lettuce to twelve years 
in the case of certain varieties of apples. Normally the com- 
plete cycle of crop growing from plowing to sale can be 
completed in ten months. From egg to egg in poultry is a 
matter of from five to eight months ; in the case of sheep and 
swine, the cycle of vocational experience is a year. But with 
cattle and horses the period is longer. Two years completes 
the cycle with baby-beef, three years with dairy cattle, five 
years with horses. But in diversified farming, say with corn 
as a major, or dairy cattle as the central enterprise, what is a 
cycle period of production—a management cycle? Probably 
not less than that of the standard rotation, from three to seven 
years, with a norm at about four years in most regions. 
If we base our vocational teaching in the farming occupa- 
tions upon responsible carrying through of management 
occupations involving the full cycle of vocational problems, 
we shall have courses ranging from six months to ten or 
twelve years. The poultry man, swine grower, and possibly 
the sheep raiser, may complete managerial undertakings in- 
volving animal and crop enterprises within the twelve months. 
The market gardener, free from rotation, may possibly do the 
same. Two years will take care of the small fruit grower; 
two to three years of the beef raiser, according to type of 
beef raising, i.c., range and pasture, or corn feeding on the 
home farm; three to four years of the dairy farmer or the 
“general farmer.” But the “cycle” indicates a hopelessly 
long course for the horse raiser and the apple grower. 
Now may not the learner encounter all the problems of the 
vocational cycle as responsible manager without raising a colt 
to trained marketable gelding or mare; without pursuing the 
same apple from sproutling to standard four. barrel tree? 
Undoubtedly. Cannot the berry grower achieve the sequent 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  STANDARDS OF PROFICIENCY 91 
experience of two years in one? Probably. Cannot the 
“ general farmer ” and the dairy farmer meet all the manage- 
ment problems of the rotation cycle in one or two years, in- 
stead of three or four? Very likely. 
But “the cycle” does indicate for the farming occupa- 
pations that genuine vocational education must provide for 
the use of the normal growing season including the spring, 
summer and autumn, and, in the case of animals, the winter 
also. That is, the minimum standard for length of course in 
preparation for such vocations is approximately one year. 
In the trade occupations of agriculture the cycle is not one 
of seasonal creation. But it exists nevertheless. What is the 
normal period of the productive process from beginning to 
end? The answer is not easy. With the herdsman it is 
probably not less than one year. With the foreman of a fruit- 
packing gang, probably not less than one harvest season, with 
the thresherman, ditto. But with the budder and the salesman, 
what is it? The budding of one thousand or a half million 
trees? the sale of a dozen eggs?,a carload of cases? or a 
season’s output ? 
Standards of Proficiency.—Evidently we cannot wholly 
determine length of course by the cycle. What degree of skill 
is needed by the budder? Enough to get and hold a job. 
Ability to bud one thousand trees successfully in a day, per- 
haps. How long will that take to learn? That depends on the 
capacity of the individual. We must go to the nurserymen for 
anorm. If the norm is five hundred hours, probably that is a 
safe standard to set, but we cannot say yet whether the course 
shall be fifty days or two hundred. How much business ability 
must the apple salesman possess? Enough to get and hold a 
job—to sell for his employers a given quota in a given time. 
How long will it take him to acquire the necessary technology 
and command of his resources in selling situations? Again
-P-A-G-E-92
  92 TEACHING WITHIN THE SCHOOL 
the time will vary with the capacity of the individual. Per- 
haps a vague norm may be established by the experience of 
fruit growers’ associations. What degree of skill in each of 
many skills, what useful knowledge and how much of it, what 
social abilities and to what degree developed, must the dairy 
farmer in a given region possess in order to carry on his busi- 
ness? There are surely minimal norms, though we proceed 
largely by guess work at present. Having established them, 
however, how long will it take to acquire the requisites in skill, 
technology, and social abilities? Again it is a question of the 
capacity of the individual and of the point in experience at 
which he starts. Only the experience of vocational schools 
will give us a standard. As yet the schools in agriculture are 
too young, too far from specific in their aims and discrim- 
inating in their methods, to show us results very useful in the 
determination of standards of length of training. 
The writer ventures to predict that the degrees of skill and 
social ability will prove to be higher than those indicated by 
the work of the agricultural colleges, the quantity and quality 
of requisite technology much less than their courses indicate ; 
that, on the other hand, much more of technology is required 
than promoters of agricultural education experienced in the 
fields of factory, department store, ship yard, and stenographic 
training would lead us to believe. “ Six months of hard work 
on the job under competent supervision, or a year, at most, 
will teach any normal boy all he needs to know or ought, to 
know, about the job of farming in southeastern Massachu- 
setts,” is, in the writer’s opinion, as far from a true statement 
as that, “ No fact or discovery of modern science, physical, 
biological, chemical or economic but is significant for the New 
England farmer of the new day.” 
The Groups to be Taught.—In either the special school 
of agriculture or the high school department of agriculture,
-P-A-G-E-93
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION 93 
we must recognize that the normal length of course will vary 
according to the groups to be taught. For boys brought up on 
poultry farms and going back to poultry farms, four months 
of technical instruction in a school with follow-up supervision 
during the rest of the year may make a good vocational course. 
For boys brought up on market garden farms and going back 
to poultry farms such a course would by no means be of equal 
value. For boys brought up in city or town three years on a 
like plan might well fail of equal effect with the one in the 
case of pupils drawn from poultry farms. Hence a short 
course may be indicated for one group, a long one for another, 
though the vocational objectives be the same. 
High School Graduation.—In the high school we have to 
reckon with another condition. The pupil may enter the high 
school primarily for vocational training, with intent to leave 
it when that training has developed the appropriate knowledge 
and abilities. There are such cases and will be more of them. 
But such is not the normal case. Boys enter the high school 
because it is the high school; to go on with their fellows, to 
equal or better the education of their parents, to be qualified 
to go to college, and on a par with the few who really intend 
to go and the fewer who do go. The normal boy gives notice 
by entrance to the high school that it is his intention or that of 
his parents for him, that he shall go on to graduation. That 
high school “ mortality ” is great does not controvert the state- 
ment. It may indicate ineffective content and teaching, the 
futility of a four year standard, the abuse of dictatorship by 
colleges or state authorities, and a score of other things that 
need careful study in the public high school, but it does not do 
away with the fact that the high school boy is entitled to 
graduate with his class if he be possessed of capacity normal 
to that class.
-P-A-G-E-94
94 TEACHING WITHIN THE SCHOOL 
Now should that condition enter into consideration in the 
organization of the vocational teaching in agriculture for regu- 
larly matriculated pupils? Will it affect the length of voca- 
tional courses in agriculture? It should, and it will. It will 
mean that there shall be no stage previous to graduation at 
which it can be said, “ Here, we have taught you all you need 
to know of your vocation. If you stay on, it is for reasons 
other than desire for increased proficiency in vocation.” The 
organization of vocational teaching should not result in an 
invitation to quit. 
But there are always boys who must quit and some who 
ought to quit. As a possible generic plan enabling an organi- 
zation flexible enough to meet the requirements of groups of 
pupils under varying limitations in possible attendance to 
like vocational ends, the unit plan hereinafter presented 
may serve. 
Special Students——In the case of non-matriculated or 
“special students” seeking vocational training under high school 
auspices the factor of class graduation does not enter to condi- 
tion the length of course. For such students the vocational 
course is not part of a curriculum, but a means to vocational 
proficiency only. Properly, then, the course should be of the 
least length possible to the acquirement of that proficiency. 
All of the time that the student can give to formal education 
should be used to the fullest for the acquirement of the skills, 
knowledges, and social abilities requisite to success in his 
chosen vocation. Though, because of an average of capacity 
or acquirement somewhat less in such students the norm of 
hours may exceed the total in the case of regularly matricu- 
lated students, that total will be compassed in a shorter period. 
A single year for the farm boy going back to the type of 
farm from which he came, somewhat longer for the farm boy 
going back to a different type of farm, and two years or more, 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE SCHOOL DAY 95 
according to the prospective occupation for the city or town 
boy, are suggestive minima. 
The special school of agriculture, in so far as it is genu- 
inely a vocational school, is in like case. But in so far as it 
is something more than that—a school of country life—it ap- 
proaches the high school condition. There is the significant 
difference, however, that the special school is not dominated 
by any traditional length of course, supposedly appropriate 
to a “ place in the ladder of education.” That is, its courses 
may differ in length. Courses of one year for the more 
specialized farm occupations in the case of farm boys, and of 
one or two years for the broader management occupations 
seem reasonable. For city boys, again, the period may be 
doubled or more than doubled. : 
For length of courses in the trade occupations no estimate 
is given. In the case of salesmen and herdsmen a year may 
be necessary, but in most cases the length of course will be 
measured in months, weeks, or even days, rather than years. 
For supplementary instruction for farmers and others actually 
engaged in vocation the “short courses” and itinerant 
“ extension schools ” of a few weeks or a few days at definite 
seasons when prime attention can be given to learning, predi- 
cate the probable effective length of course. 
The length of the school year for farming vocations is 
inevitably that of the crop and animal cycles. The accepted 
standard of twelve months for learning must be near the actual 
norm. For the trade vocations length of school year is not 
a question. 
The School Day.—One factor in the “true vocational 
situation” of the farming vocations is the long day of labor 
—ten or twelve hours, if not the proverbial sixteen—during 
the cropping season. Therefore, argue some, in order that the 
boy may learn under actual conditions of vocation he should
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 TEACHING WITHIN THE SCHOOL 
work, in learning, the long day. A concession is made, to 
be sure, by Doctor Snedden,* who says that the learning day 
for the boy in vocation should be, on the average, six or eight 
hours. By just what process of reasoning the standard is 
reached is not plain. Presumably there is a felt, if unex- 
pressed, recognition of the fact that one condition of the nor- 
mal vocational situation, namely, adulthood, must always be 
missing in the case of the boy; that, therefore, he is not truly 
facing the normal situation when he works ten or twelve 
hours a day. But why “ six or eight hours on the average,” 
rather than nine hours, three hours, or fifteen minutes? From 
the earning day existent in normal conditions of mature man- 
hood working without direction to ends other than economic, 
it is exceedingly doubtful that any such standard may be de- 
rived for the learning day of the boy. 
For his educative activities are selected in types like 
to those of the adult in the occupation. The activities 
are restricted by the native and acquired limitations, 
physical and mental of the boy himself. A boy can learn 
to milk more economically by beginning with the task 
of drawing all fromm one cow, than from ten or twelve, 
the normal stint of an adult. That he has not reached voca- 
tional proficiency until he can successfully milk ten cows in 
one hour, is true. But that the stages of his learning progress 
demand the milking of six cows in thirty-six minutes on the 
average, does not at all follow. It may take him forty minutes 
to milk the cow the first time, in the course of two or three 
weeks he will be milking her in eight minutes, in the course 
of two months he may milk her in six minutes. A fortnight 
of practice with additional cows may very likely bring him to 
the hired man’s standard. But neither the number of cows

-P-A-G-E-97
  THE DEMANDS OF THE JOB 97 
milked day by day or on the average, nor the time total, nor 
distribution of time in learning to milk has any fixed relation 
to the adult standard. To economy in earning we come most 
rapidly through economy in learning, but the first is not a 
guide to the second. 
A successful market gardener sits down for an hour in the 
evening and figures out the manure, fertilizer, and seed 
requirements for the coming season, notes when and where he 
will buy, when and how shipment shall be made. Such, per- 
haps, sets a standard of economic efficiency to which we would 
ultimately bring the pupil who is to be a market gardener, but 
it gives us no guidance as to how much time may be required 
for the mastery of the necessary technology, nor any inkling as 
to the economical distribution of that time. 
The Demands of the Job.—This we do know: that jobs 
in the control of plants and animals, many of them, cannot be 
intermitted. The housewife can lay down her knitting after 
five minutes or half an hour and take it up again a week or 
month hence without loss. But the boy who fails to pick ripe 
strawberries on Monday morning by Tuesday night or sooner 
loses those berries; he cannot draw a pint of milk from the 
cow Friday night and go back to finish the job Sunday when © 
it is more convenient; he cannot water some of his flock to- 
day and the rest to-morrow, or plant a hill of potatoes now 
and then as he feels like it during the season. No doubt some 
of the activities necessary to his learning will call for a long 
day or several long days of unintermitted work, particularly at 
planting and harvest. If a necessary activity be making of 
an incubator hatch, we know that for something over three 
weeks he must work a half hour in the morning and a half 
hour in the evening. The absolute requirements of the specific 
jobs he must do, to learn, set minimal standards of total and of 
distribution of time which must be met.

  98 TEACHING WITHIN THE SCHOOL 
‘ Already we have “work units” in farm management; 
out of the experience of vocational teaching we should de- 
velop standard “ work units ” for boys, usable in the determi- 
nation of length of course and distribution of time daily, 
weekly or monthly throughout the season. Conceivably, too, 
we shall develop standards of economic distribution and totals 
in learning skills, specific knowledges, social abilities, which 
with the work units will determine the normal time programs 
for training to the several vocations of agriculture. 
The Schedule.—At present we have no such standards, 
and work on a basis of trial and error. In the high school the 
start was made with the standard forty or forty-five minute 
period. So far as recitation and book assignment is useful in 
the teaching of agriculture such a period is probably as near 
to meeting the requirements as it is in the case of the other 
“subjects ” of high school. The merits of the standard period 
in the high school are much debated, but presumably it has a 
survival value, at least. That effective, if not the most 
effective, book teaching may be done in such a period is hardly 
to be doubted. The teacher of agriculture in the high school, 
who in his recitation and assignment work is restricted by the 
“schedule ” as other teachers are, has no injustice done him. 
It is because so much of the necessary work to effective 
teaching of agriculture is other than recitation and book 
assignment, that the fixed limitations of the standard period 
are prohibitive of success, that the double period, the triple 
period, and the half day, during the “academic year” have 
come in to replace the single period. Of those the half-day 
meets with most favor among teachers. The reasons are 
evident. Much of the most effective work involves tasks that 
cannot be dropped at the stroke of a bell, many of them must 
be carried on at a distance from the school, sometimes by a 
class group, sometimes by smaller groups working separately,
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE SCHEDULE 99 
again by individuals widely separated. That every teacher 
preparing boys in the farming occupations needs a certain 
number of single periods for recitation, a certain number of 
double or triple periods for laboratory and shop teaching, a 
considerable number of half days and some whole days during 
the “academic” year for field studies and tasks, farm labor 
at individual homes, is probable. How many depends upon 
the class and upon the objectives; how distributed, upon 
weather and season. The extreme concession of one half day 
throughout the thirty-six weeks with ten full days at dis- 
cretion in the fall and again in the spring certainly gives the 
teacher all the freedom likely to be requisite in the effective 
teaching of specific vocation, even of the broader types. Of 
course no such allowance is to be regarded as standard for all 
high school courses. 
Even in the present state of knowledge it would seem that 
we should come somewhat closer to rational totals and distri- 
bution in the matter of time than we have. A careful ascer- 
tainment of teaching aims indicated by the method of content 
selection suggested may be further evolved into learning 
activities and teaching activities, such as jobs, demonstrations, 
exercises, field trips, reports, discussions, recitations, exami- 
nation, etc. Upon these, reasonable time estimates may be set 
by experienced teachers and farmer advisors, to indicate the 
probable number of single periods, double periods, half days, 
whole days, etc., required for normal accomplishment of the 
learning and vocational purposes of each. The making of an 
intelligent schedule according to season and local opportunity 
then becomes possible. Only must there be preserved suffi- 
cient flexibility to allow for the uncertainties of weather and 
other vicissitudes. A hard and fast schedule such as recita- 
tions Monday and Thursday, double periods Wednesday, half 
days Friday and whole days on Tuesdays during October,
-P-A-G-E-100
  100 TEACHING WITHIN THE SCHOOL 
could hardly meet the case of the absence of Mr. Jackson 
from his farm on the fifteenth, the postponement of the local 
fair, and a hard storm Tuesday or Friday. But a schedule 
allowing for the given number of recitations, half days, whole 
days, etc., for each month at the discretion of the teacher, . 
with due notice to the principal might work in a high school. 
It is certain that the same schedule is not equally adapted to 
market gardening, peach orcharding, poultry keeping, and 
dairy farming. It is certainly true that the uniform half day 
schedule, with all its merits, does often lead to stuffing and 
waste. Because the teacher is responsible for the group for 
the afternoon he feels the necessity for keeping them busy. 
Perhaps a demonstration, a recitation, or a reading assignment 
is all that is desirable or pertinent to their problems for the 
time being, but they must be kept busy. Accordingly the 
recitation is dragged out, matter not pertinent or timely is 
dragged in. We have virtually a case of “ busy work,” with 
loss of interest, a tendency to the dallying, “ kill time ” atti- 
tude, when a more appropriate schedule would set both boys 
and teacher free for more significant work. The problem of 
schedule is one of the most delicate, difficult, and important in 
the organization of the vocational course. It is successful 
according to its appropriateness to the end to be accomplished. 
Equipment.—The same general standard governs in the 
case of rooms and equipment. To have his own room fitted 
according to the prescription of the state department, with 
demonstration desk, tables and chairs, blackboard, seed and 
soil samples, crop exhibits, poultry cages, Babcock tester, 
tubes, racks, canisters, sink, etc., and reserved exclusively to 
his use is often to give the teacher an advantageous start and 
to establish an attitude on the part of local authorities neces- 
sary to the accomplishment of good vocational teaching. The 
same may be said of the school shop. But the fact remains
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE SHOP 101 
that there are disadvantages. A full equipment leads to the 
doing under school conditions, artificial conditions, what might 
better be done on the farm under vocational conditions. It 
keeps boys and teacher in when they should be out. A room 
unused for half or two-thirds of the time, as is often the case 
with the best teaching, is an expensive item of school plant 
inefficiently used. Standardized equipment is inevitably, much 
of it, inappropriate to the teaching needs of the particular 
local situation and is either not used or used when it should 
not be used. 
When the teaching objectives for a particular vocation in 
agriculture in a local school show the need for an exclusive 
room, two rooms, or three, and the probability of using those 
rooms efficiently, certainly they should be required. But the 
writer sympathizes with those principals who would make use 
of an unoccupied room, with proper precautions for the pro- 
tection of equipment when such use is no loss to the agri- 
cultural teaching and a distinct gain to other teaching. As 
for mechanic equipment, such should be bought only as it is 
distinctly appropriate to particular teaching needs, and not 
economically available outside of the school. Room and 
equipment in the school, are accessory and supplementary 
to the teaching resources of the community outside the 
school house. 
The Shop.—That statement is meant, most emphatically, 
to include the shop. For it is far from being certain that a 
shop at the school is either necessary or desirable in the case 
of every farming vocation, or even if it be desirable in many 
cases in many communities that it is so in the same cases in 
all communities. If the necessary skills in tool handling 
may be taught with equal effectiveness on the farm, the farm 
shop is to be preferred to the school shop, since it more nearly 
represents the probable situations in the prospective vocation.
-P-A-G-E-102
102 TEACHING WITHIN THE SCHOOL 
The Library.—Finally, the same general standards must 
be applied to the vocational library in agriculture. The books 
purchased must be such as contribute pertinently to the solu- 
tion of problems arising out of the learning of his vocation 
by the pupil, poultry books for prospective poultrymen, dairy 
farming books for prospective dairy farmers, pomological 
texts for prospective orchardists, and so on. Further, such 
books should be selected as supplementary to the community 
resources for first hand acquirement of technology, not as 
substitutes for it. A book is as truly a bit of teaching equip- 
ment as a pruning saw, test tube, or Babcock tester, and is 
amenable to like standards for selection. 
The special school in the matter of rooms and equipment 
is not exempt from the same standards. In that, however, it 
is normally an away-from-home school dependent upon its 
Own resources in vocational surroundings to a far greater 
extent than the country high school, more accessible to home 
farms of pupils, if not to other farms, it will require a larger 
equipment both indoors and out, than the high school. In 
consequence the segregation of rooms to the use of depart- 
ment (i.e., poultry, dairy, fruit) is more frequently justified 
than with the high school. But the same disadvantages to 
effective teaching are present. 
In the case of the itinerant school, a room in which to 
meet, with a blackboard, is often all that is needed. But 
special equipment according to the purpose of the course may 
be carried. A tester, an egg candler, a spray pump, and 
rarely a gas engine or tractor, may be legitimate equipment 
where class use must be made of material not promptly or 
readily available for a day’s teaching. But use of local com- 
munity resources, as against the special car or automobile 
truck of the demonstrator, is economical and probably on the 
whole more effective. The travelling library may be of great
-P-A-G-E-103
  
THE LIBRARY 103 
service, but is by no means indispensable. If repeated teaching 
be undertaken in the same or a closely related field the pur- 
chase or renting of books and equipment by the community 
visited or often by the learner, is appropriate. The purchase 
of books and equipment frequently usable in the continuance 
of vocation, apart from the teaching program, is always to be 
justified whether in high schools, special schools, or itiner- 
ant schools. 
In sum, organization within the school is wholly dependent 
upon specific educational purpose. In so far as in the de- 
tails of its selection and the correlation of its parts, it is 
appropriate to that specific purpose, it is good organization. 
In so far as it fails of appropriateness it is without meaning 
as organization.
-P-A-G-E-104
  CHAPTER VIII 
A UNIT PLAN FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
Farm Management Factors.—The farming vocations 
have been in the past fifteen years extensively studied by 
farm management experts for determination of the factors 
contributing to the net income which the farmer earns. The 
income which his land commands as rent, which his capital 
earns as interest, is in the large not closely dependent upon 
him as an individual, but rather upon the relative scarcity of 
land of various grades of productivity under the existing 
status of agricultural art to the demand for it, and of the 
normal minimal reward for savings investment—the accumu- 
lation of capital by abstinence from unproductive expenditure. 
Though such be items in the personal income of the farmer, 
they are not regarded as measures of his productivity. His 
productivity, in terms of the value set upon it by economic 
society, is measured in the return given as wages for labor and 
management, and as profit for the risk taken by the farmer as 
entrepreneur. The net return to the farmer in wages and 
profits over and above all expenditures for taxation, hired 
labor, depreciation, and others necessary to production, and 
allowances for rent and interest, constitutes his labor income, 
which is the standard measure of his success from the 
economic standpoint. 
Now certain factors* stand out as predominantly affecting 
labor income, apart from individual differences in ability 
among farmers. These are most conspicuously three: 
(1) The size of the business, to which capital investment,   
* Warren: Farm Management. 
104
-P-A-G-E-105
  
FARMING ABILITIES 105 
acreage in crops, animal units, productive labor units, num- 
ber of men and of work animals, furnish indices. Other 
things being equal, the larger the business the larger the labor 
income. (2) Diversity, which provides for the conservation of 
fertility, the more continuous employment of labor, and in- 
surance against the loss which may come from “ putting all 
the eggs in one basket,” is indicated by the number of crop 
and animal enterprises conducted, the receipts from each, and 
the proportion between crop and animal enterprises shown by 
crop acres per animal unit. Next to size of business, diversity 
is the most important factor in determining labor income. 
(3) Production—the yield per acre and per animal as com- 
pared with the norm for the same crop and animals in the 
industry as a whole. That is established by the crop index, as 
corn 1.4 (showing that the farmer obtains a yield forty per 
cent. above normal yield per acre), or animal index, as dairy 
cattle .9o (showing that the farmer receives a return per cow 
ten per cent. below normal). Other things being equal, the 
greater is production the greater is labor income. 
Farming Abilities.—The three factors listed with other 
minor standard factors, indicate the conditions in which the 
farmer exercises his abilities. Where such factors are, in 
their combination, of approximate equality, it is found that 
considerable differences in labor income exist. Such differ- 
ences are probably fair measures of differences in ability. 
But, as yet, we have no studies showing what these differences 
in ability may be, nor just how significant to labor income are 
the various skills, knowledges, and social abilities called for 
in the vocation. Certain general, and manifestly inadequate, 
estimates have been made, usually not for particular farming 
occupations, but for “ farming ”—as in Doctor Higbie’s study 
of the qualifications of the successful farmer.f More accurate   
+ Higbie: Columbia University Contributions to Education.
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
and detailed study of particular abilities in particular farm 
occupations will contribute greatly to effective voca- 
tional education. 
The Business Undertaking.—But it is probable that we 
can proceed with considerable hope of success, if we think in 
terms of the activity complexes in which the abilities of the 
dairy farmer, the cotton grower, the poultry man, etc., are 
exercised and tested. That group of skills, knowledges, and 
social abilities, which are lumped under the rubric of mana- 
gerial ability, manifest themselves in the codrdination of all 
vocational factors to the end of labor income. In the largest 
sense, managerial ability includes special abilities in planning, 
arrangement, distribution of labor and capital investment, 
purchase and sale, which constitute business ability. Every 
farmer is engaged in a business undertaking of greater or 
less scope. 
The Productive Enterprise.—Within that undertaking, 
farm management experts have found isolated enterprises in 
crop and animal production each with a specific end of its own, 
more or less directly contributing to the main end of the labor 
income. Thus a dairy farmer conducts a business undertaking 
in the production and sale of milk and other commodities con- 
tributory to the most effective use of land, capital and labor 
necessary to the production and sale of milk. As codrdinate 
parts of the business undertaking, he may conduct a major en- 
terprise with Holstein cattle; feeding crop enterprises with 
herds-grass and clover, alfalfa, pasture, oats and corn; cash- 
crop enterprises with sweet corn and potatoes; a cash enter- 
prise in the production of Jersey Red pigs for sale at the age 
of eight weeks. In each of these enterprises skill and knowl- 
edge are put to uses not in themselves managerial. 
In the farming vocations then, are always present the 
business undertaking and the productive enterprise. In
-P-A-G-E-107
  DEVELOPING FARMING ABILITIES 107 
the more highly specialized forms of farming, such as egg 
production in suburban New Jersey for a club clientele in 
New York City, undertaking and enterprise are hardly dis- 
tinguishable; we may look at the same specialized complex of 
activities from either point of view, or both. But the norm of 
poultry farming, as of market gardening, flower growing, 
tobacco farming, berry farming, and the other specialized 
types, does show the composite undertaking and the sub- 
ordinate enterprises. The range of diversity and the degree 
of relative subordination in enterprises varies from the 
so-called “ general farming” types to the rare single enter- 
prise business. The two aspects of business undertaking and 
productive enterprises are constant, however, throughout the 
farming vocations. 
Organization to Develop Farming Abilities —Now, for 
the organization of course work for training in farming voca- 
tions, those two characteristics of the vocations are significant. 
To learn vocation in vocation the course for the prospective 
farmer, no matter what the type, must centre in a business 
undertaking developmental of managerial abilities. It must 
be founded on productive enterprises contributory to the suc- 
cess of the business undertaking, in which are developed 
skills and knowledges functional in production. The organi- 
zation of the course, then, is derivative of the demands of the 
business undertaking upon the participant; the component 
parts, or “ subjects ” in that course are derivative, respectively, 
of the productive enterprises consequent upon the under- 
taking. The key to vocational education for the dairy farmer 
or the poultry farmer, is in the directive educational control of 
the learner, throughout—to use a figure—a “ complete act” 
of dairy farming or of poultry farming. The teaching situa- 
tions for specific skills, technical knowledges, social abilities
-P-A-G-E-108
    108 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
will grow out of the vocational situations which the learner 
as dairy farmer or poultry farmer now meets. 
We forecast those situations vocational and teaching by 
means of the regional survey and analysis and the use of the 
criteria for content selection and method determination later 
elaborated. The forecasting is for groups and constitutes the 
contemplated course of study; the actuality is for individuals 
and constitutes the real course of study for each one. 
' Now the dairy farmer, the poultry farmer, or any other 
farmer carries on his productive enterprises and his business 
undertaking concurrently at all times, since the second cannot 
exist without the first, and the second is the essence of his 
vocation. It follows, then, that to achieve a representative 
vocational experience the learner must codrdinate productive 
enterprises in a business undertaking. But the fact does not 
indicate that he shall, throughout the period of learning, pur- 
sue all the enterprises growing out of the undertaking. A 
child learns sentences before he organizes paragraphs, para- 
graphs before essays, though essay writing is the essential 
preparation of the essayist. Before he is trained to dairy 
farming the boy must undertake the codrdination of concur- 
rent enterprises in cattle management, feed crop production, 
and cash crop production. But he may without appreciable 
loss, and often with decided gain, both from the educational 
and the economic points of view, come to the full business 
undertaking after the sequent establishment of the necessary 
enterprises one by one through such a period as the exigencies 
of school and community life make most desirable. 
Size of the Learner’s Undertaking.—Now, if the voca- 
tional course be organized about a genuine business under- 
taking by the learner of a type with the farming vocation 
which he is to learn, what shall be the size of that undertaking ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  
AN ILLUSTRATIVE CASE 109 
In the absence of standard working units for boys and of 
norms for specific learning, in the face of the facts of indi- 
vidual differences, mental and physical, and of uncontrolled 
social and economic conditions, any conceivable specification 
is subject to inaccuracy. Yet within the range of agricultural 
occupations with which the secondary school is chiefly con- 
cerned, those that classify under the head of family unit 
farming, there appears a fairly clear upper limit to size of the 
learner’s business, and a more indefinite lower limit. 
An Illustrative Case.—For the sake of concreteness let 
us take an hypothetical case not too far removed from the 
realm of probability. In region M of the state of Y, study 
reveals the prevalence of a type of farming called “ general 
farming with a dairy major.” Accessible to the Franklin High 
School are some thirty boys capable of matriculation, who 
intend to follow that sort of farming in the region. The boys 
range in age from fourteen to seventeen, and can attend 
school for thirty-six weeks a year during one, two, three or 
four years. They are sons of relatively poor to moderately 
prosperous parents. 
Analysis of the occupations reveals the following gen- 
eral norms: 
(1) Three groups of enterprises: 
A. The major enterprise, dairy cattle for milk pro- 
duction ; 
F. Feed and fertility cropping enterprises, i.¢., hay, 
silage corn, oats ; 
C. Accessory cash cropping enterprises, i.¢., po- 
tatoes. 
(2) A total of productive units per man of 240.
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
(3) A seasonable distribution of work units by enter- 
prises as follows: 
Spring Summer Autumn Winter Total

eS, 30 15 — 60 
20 15 20 > 60 
65 63 67 45 240 
The business undertaking may be represented by AFC, 
the product of the codrdination of enterprises A, F, C. For 
representative experience in the vocation, then, the boys must 
carry on enterprises A, F and C, and a business under- 
taking AFC. 
But the boys, by hypothesis, are to be in high school for 
five hours daily during thirty-six weeks of the year, five days 
in the week. During autumn, winter and spring one-half of 
’ their time is required for school work. During the summer 
only can they work full time at farm jobs. That is, for 
autumn, winter and spring the index of their working time is 
50 per cent.; for summer 100 per cent. 
Also these are boys, not men. The accomplishment of the 
work represented by a unit means the use of time in excess 
of that required by adult farmers. But there is available a 
rough economic estimate of their efficiency norms in the rate 
of wages paid boys as compared with adults. These rates are: 
14-15 years, 50 per cent. of adult wages 
15 ~ 16 years, 60 per cent. of adult wages 
16-17 years, 70 per cent. of adult wages 
17-18 years, 80 per cent. of adult wages 
Accepting such estimates by the community, then, the 
boys in school are capable of accomplishing in the norm, if 
following the adult pattern, the following work units :

No. 4 is well within compass of the labor limitations set on 
every group of boys. It leaves free to employment by his 
father for the 14-15 year old boy 55 per cent. of his working 
capacity; for the 15-16 year old boy 63 per cent.; for the 
16-17 year old boy 68 per cent.; for the 17-18 year old boy 
72 per cent. The amount of land and capital involved is 
relatively small. Such an undertaking is much less difficult 
than Nos. 1, 2, and 3, from the standpoint of teacher 
and administrator. 
Evidently it represents also a lower limit. Any further 
reduction of the major enterprise results in an offset from the 
type of vocation, any reduction of the F and C enterprises
-P-A-G-E-113
THE LOWER LIMIT 113 
‘throws the business out of balance and consequently of type. 
The limitation is clearly due to the physical impossibility of 
further reduction of the major. 
In the case of smaller animals in the major, such as sheep, 
swine or poultry, the balance of the business could be main- 
tained with much smaller enterprises; in the case of a crop 
major the pattern is reducible to almost microscopic 
proportions—the physical lower limit approaches the school 
garden plot. 
The Lower Limit—But we are already convinced that 
a business organized about one hen and five chicks or ten hills 
of potatoes is inadequate for teaching purposes. Both fail in 
the demand for use of equipment characteristic of the adult 
occupation. A spading fork, a wheel barrow, a hoe, rake, and 
sprinkling pot, would suffice in the first, and be more appro- 
priate and economical than the two horse plow, disc and 
smoothing harrow, weeder, cultivator, planter, sprayer, etc., 
used in the vocation. In the second, a dry goods case, an 
orange crate, a maple branch four feet long, a pail and a 
brush, two tomato cans, a half dozen sacks and a dozen birch 
stakes would serve more economically than a modern hen- 
house, yard, incubator, and brooder, and other equipment 
used in the poultryman’s business. In other words, the busi- 
ness, if balanced in terms of animals and crops and seasonal 
distribution of labor is not characteristic in other respects. 
We cannot train a boy to a two or three-horse business by 
setting him up in one which appropriately demands but one 
horse or no horses at all. The lower limit of the learner’s 
business is that least status in which the essential char- 
acters of the vocation are retained. That, the writer con- 
ceives to be the meaning of the “‘ man’s size project ” of which 
so much has been heard in recent years. It is not an under- 
8 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  114 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
taking which calls for the employment of a man, but one 
which retains the essential features of a man’s business. 
On that basis, then, it is necessary to reéxamine the trial 
business cited above. Is the maximum that is possible above 
the minimum that is necessary? Is it below that necessary 
minimum? If the latter question be answered affirmatively, 
then, general farming with a dairy major cannot be success- 
fully taught in the Franklin High School at all. For the sake 
of test consider but three characteristics of the vocation as 
found in the region. Evidently it is a two horse business, at 
least, and it requires the use of a dairy barn and a silo. Now 
take the extreme cases of (1) the boy not living on a farm at 
all and of (2) the boy living on a representative farm of the 
type given. 
The Case of the Farm Boy.—Allow to boy number one 
the land and capital required for his undertaking. Consider 
the largest business, No. 1. Is the employment of two horse 
equipment profitable if it must be hired from outside? With 
8-12 acres to be plowed, 8 acres to be mowed, 4 acres to be 
cultivated, probably, yes. Isa barn required for four animals? 
Something essentially resembling a dairy barn, probably. Isa 
silo indicated? In the light of normal farm practice, and in 
spite of the advice of enthusiasts, no. The handicap of paying 
interest on such an investment, to say nothing of keeping and 
feeding silage, is probably prohibitive of any representative 
success. No. 4, at the other end, fails in its demand for two 
horse equipment, probably, also in its demands for a dairy 
barn, as well as for the silo. 
Boy number two is on a farm where two-horse equipment, 
dairy barn, and silo, are established factors. Consider the 
smallest undertaking No. 4. If his four and one-half acres 
be laid off en bloc with his father’s layout of crops, obviously 
the two horse equipment can be used economically for the
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE CASE OF THE VILLAGE BOY 115 
production of his crops. But such layout is distinctly disad- 
vantageous from the point of view of education, as experience 
has so often proved. The business tends to lose its individu- * 
ality, the boy loses much of the control. When father decides 
to mow the bloc on a given day, which contains the boy’s plot 
of hay, economy of team labor indicates the cutting of the 
boy’s acre and a half at the same time, whether the boy thinks 
it is ready or past ready, and the boy loses the sense of re- 
sponsible proprietorship which is an important feature of his 
vocational training. Now if the boy’s farm is laid off by 
itself, as is desirable, does the plowing of one and a half acres 
at one time, one and a half acres at another, three-fourths 
acre at still another justify the use of the team? Probably, 
yes, on most soils of the dairy type. But when it comes to 
cultivation, it is an open question, that two horses are called 
for. That the father should frequently, and without economic 
detriment, turn over to the boy the spare horse and the hand 
cultivator or half section of harrow, is to be expected. Again, 
is there genuine experience of herd management in the con- 
trol of one cow and her calf? It is doubtful. 
But perhaps, the skills and abilities not developed in the 
smallest business may be acquired by employment at his 
father’s work with the herd and in the field. That is admitted. 
But those are not associated directly with his own business as 
they must be in the vocation, nor are they motivated through 
that business as they must be in the vocation. Though No. 4 
may serve in special cases, of necessity, No. 3 is more nearly, 
in the opinion of the writer, the minimum norm of under- 
_ taking for all farm boys in the school, and a higher standard 
for the older and exceptionally able boys, if conditions allow, 
seems well worth while. 
The Case of the Village Boy.—As for the town or city 
boy, in the hypothetical case cited, he cannot be effectively 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
trained in the high school except he become virtually a farm 
boy like his fellows. In the case of other vocations, such as 
poultry farming, market gardening, small fruit growing, or 
possibly a cash-crop major, the differing standards might 
admit him to high school training while living at home. 
A business undertaking which preserves the characteristic 
elements of the vocation in proportionate distribution of capi- 
tal investment, land, and labor, which appropriately demands 
the use of equipment, skills, technological control, and man- 
agerial codrdination found in the vocation may be, rela- 
tive to the normal farmer’s undertaking in that vocation, a 
small affair, and yet appear to meet the standard of least 
status already set up. But the question may be raised as to 
whether or not this least status is genuine after all. Is not 
“size of business,’ by the farm management standards a 
prime factor, left out of consideration? Can an undertaking 
which is not of a size typical to the vocation be regarded as 
typical of that vocation? Then, too, is the factor of produc- 
tion or relative yield, typically represented in the undertakings 
proposed? It may be that the year in which the undertaking 
in codrdination of enterprises is carried out, is a year of early 
frosts, of exceptionally high or low temperature, of excessive 
or deficient rainfall, or one in which circumstances make a 
minor pest, such as the aphis on potatoes for the time being a 
major problem, or a rare disease, such as foot-and-mouth 
disease, the chief difficulty. Can a boy who carries on an 
undertaking one-twentieth or one fortieth the size normal to 
the vocation in a year when circumstances distort yield or 
price of yield far from the normal be said to have had ex- 
perience typical to his vocation? 
Deficiencies.—Certainly the question cannot be answered 
in the affirmative. But if it cannot be, then does not the whole 
theory of typical undertakings fall flat in the test of practice?
-P-A-G-E-117
WORKING STANDARDS 117 
The answer is no, though the pertinence of the questions be 
admitted. For a man training for the swim between Dover 
and Calais probably the best practice is to be had in swimming 
regularly longer and longer distances in the rough, cold 
waters of the English Channel. But the fact does not rule out 
the participation of trained swimmers from Bridgeport and 
New Haven. If these men train in the somewhat warmer 
and less tumultuous waters of Long Island Sound they do not 
lack all effective preparation for the channel contest. In that 
they swim in salt water, often choppy, for such distances as 
the time at their disposal, their strength and endurance per- 
mit, they are making preparation through typical experience 
for the trial which is their object. Because the English Chan- 
nel is not at their doors does not make futile the long swims 
in the sound, or reduce them to a daily bath and perusal of the 
history of Doctor Webb. 
Working Standards.—It is no more possible to provide 
learning boys with full sized businesses, with adult vocations, 
than it is to provide an English Channel for the Bridge- 
port swimmers. But that is not to prove the futility of giving 
them business experience as nearly representative of that 
vocation as circumstances permit, For elimination of the fac- 
tor of size is not a destruction of type with a farm any more 
than with a flag. A major part of the essential elements re- 
main, If a fourteen-year-old boy be taught flag hoisting and 
furling with a 2’x 4’ flag on a thirty foot pole he is ex- 
perienced for intelligent tackling of the man’s job when he 
becomes a man, of raising and furling a 16’ x 20’ banner on 
a hundred foot pole. That practice with the lesser equipment 
is effective at all is because that equipment is typical of the 
larger. Just where type ceases is a matter of judgment. But 
it would seem that we can reasonably work toward type by 
selecting undertakings for educative purposes in which the  
-P-A-G-E-118
  118 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
known elements of significance in relationship and num- 
ber approximate as nearly as may be those of the vocation. 
That the school can do more than that is impossible, that it 
should do less, in professing to give vocational training, 
is unreasonable. 
Productive Enterprises.—In the large it is not possible 
for the school to give vocational experience sufficiently pro- 
longed to ensure to boys fully typical experience in the norms 
of season and market. But is that experience sufficiently 
important to justify the continuation of the full business 
undertaking over the four years of a high school course, for 
instance? Not if another means is available to the securing of 
that experience. The factors of yield and price are bound up 
with the individual enterprises quite as closely as with the 
codrdinate undertaking in which those enterprises at one time 
or another may be grouped. 
Varying Seasons.—Particularly are the effects of vary- 
ing seasons manifest in the case of crops, of market variations 
in the case of cash crops. Yield of milk and price of milk are 
much more stable than yield of potatoes and price of potatoes. 
The chances, then, of finding a normal experience of cattle 
management are better in any single year than of finding nor- 
mal experience in growing fodder crops, and with fodder crops 
better than with cash crops. To be sure of a normal year, 
then, repeated enterprises in cash crops are more important 
than with feed crops, repeated enterprises with feed crops 
more important than with a dairy major. It may be said, of 
course, that with crop yields and prices of crops, there is never 
a normal year, that “ the only normal is the abnormal.” There 
is much of appeal in that statement to the experienced 
‘farmer. But it only goes to strengthen the conclusion 
already made.
-P-A-G-E-119
THE NEED FOR CONTINUITY 119 
Continuing Enterprises.—Thus, even assuming that the 
seasonal enterprise is sufficient to the skills, the opening of 
technological fields, and to particular social abilities appropri- 
ate to it, there may be advantage in the enterprise continued 
through one, two, or three years preliminary to the final full 
business undertaking. Further it may frequently be the best 
means to accumulation of capital necessary to the full under- 
taking. By the growing of two or three crops of potatoes, 
for instance, the boy may accumulate enough to buy the two 
cows, and the heifer used in undertaking No. 2 as cited, or by 
growing the hay and silage in advance of the purchase of 
cattle he may be in much better shape for business than in de- 
pending on returns from milk to pay for purchased feed; or 
again by starting with a single cow in the first year of his 
high school course, he may by good luck in the birth of heifer 
calves, have raised his own herd for the business of the senior 
year. Further, a boy who has carried on continuous enter- 
prises during the four years may well be much more favorably 
placed for immediate entrance upon a business of his own 
than as a result of a single year’s undertaking. That is a very 
real advantage that the long course may have over the short. 
One Year Course.—In the hypothetical case used above 
it is evident that every boy must in one year be engaged in the 
productive enterprises (P) of A and F and C in the business 
undertaking (B) of AF C. The work of that year may then 
be represented as follows: 
(P) (B) 
A+F+C AFC 
The Need for Continuity.—With those who have but one 
year to go to school the placing is simple. But what of those 
who must leave with the second, third and fourth years? That 
there may be the shortest possible interval between vocational 
training and actual entrance upon the vocation apart from
-P-A-G-E-120
    120 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
training, obviously the work should be in the last year of at- 
tendance in each case. But that is to leave a period between 
vocational choice, assumed at entrance, and the beginning of 
vocational training of one, two and three years, respectively. 
From the psychological standpoint that is little short of dis- 
astrous. “ Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.” The boy 
who enters school with the object of acquiring vocational 
training only to find that he must pass through one, two or 
three years of apparently unrelated study before any attention 
is given to those problems which are primary with him loses 
much of the motive which impels him to study and all sense 
of continuity with any prevocational experience through which 
he has arrived at his choice. Such a condition indicates that 
the school should concern itself with matters directly pertain- 
ing to vocational training throughout. Adding the consider- 
ation to those already advanced it appears that enterprises 
contributory to the final business undertaking’ should consti- 
, tute a part of the work of every year preceding that 
undertaking.

normal, he may drop his cash enterprise and put his money 
at interest, or continue for the second, or second and third 
years as he sees fit. In the second year, he will grow hay, 
corn, silage, and oats sufficient to the maintenance of a cow 
and a heifer ; in the third year he will care for a cow and bred 
heifer, and grow hay, corn silage; and oats sufficient to the 
maintenance of two cows and a calf, as given; in the fourth 
year, the full undertaking will be carried on, with a possible 
increase in feed crops if he plans to increase his herd in the 
succeeding year. Under the plan he will have had one year of 
farm management experience, two years in caring for cattle, 
three years in raising the F crops, two to four years in raising 
the Ccrops. Other combinations can be filled out in the same 
way and evaluated according to the particular local or class 
conditions. 
Course Units.—The possibility of organizing the course 
of study by using the productive enterprise groupings as units 
is evident in the case given. But it may appear that a business 
AF Cis not characteristic of farming vocations. Undoubtedly 
in the extremes of specialization, wherein the major enterprise 
is such that no contributory enterprises are necessary to its 
maintenance, or wherein that major enterprise furnishes con- 
tinuous employment, or employment at such a profitable rate 
during a limited period that no other effort for earning is 
necessary, or wherein seasonal employment in agriculture is 
supplemented by work in other vocations, the A F C form 
may reduce to A. Such may be the case in cane growing, rice 
growing, cranberry growing, dahlia growing, day old chick 
hatching, other highly specialized forms of poultry business, 
lettuce and tomato forcing, etc. With the more common 
specialized vocations the business may reduce to the form 
A F as in much of poultry raising, tobacco growing, market 
gardening, orcharding, etc. Dairy farms in regions where
-P-A-G-E-123
    COMPLICATIONS 123 
transport of hay at profitable rates is possible may make hay a 
cash crop as well as a feed crop so that F and C become prac- 
tically identical. But the case where a minor cash enterprise 
in poultry, swine, apples, potatoes, cabbage, etc., is not present 
is relatively uncommon. On many farms not cattle, sheep, 
swine are major interests, but cash crops, and the animal 
enterprises became the C factor. In irrigated and some other 
regions, animal enterprises may be absent, but cash major and 
cash minor crops make the A and C divisions. Most farming 
vocations reduce to the A F C form. 
Complications.—In a given region there may be several 
major cash crops, such as (1) cabbage and potatoes, (2) winter 
apples and potatoes, (3) winter apples, cabbage, potatoes and 
beans, (4) corn, potatoes, sugar beets and beans, (5) corn and 
truck crops, (6) wheat and oats. Ona single farm, because 
of competition for labor by various crops and duplication of 
equipment, the full range of regional cash crops seldom ap- 
pears. In the region, too, the number of such crops of approxi- 
mately equal profitability seldom exceeds three or four. But 
such a situation complicates somewhat the plan of course. The 
necessary adaptation can be made by starting work with the 
major and continuing that throughout the course. Ina single 
year course or a two year course, the growing of two or more 
cash crops together may be necessary; in the longer courses 
the crops may follow in sequence and, possibly, only one be 
retained in the final business undertaking. Suppose, for ex- 
ample that A represents for the region, corn, potatoes, field 
beans, sugar beets. For the one year boy, then, A is the growing 
of all four or a choice. The two year boy may grow three in 
the first year, one in the second, or two in each year. The 
three year boy may grow two or one in the first year, one or 
two in the second, one in the third year. The four year boy 
may grow one in each year. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
Sequence.—No rule can be laid down as to the normal 
sequence. It may be necessary to begin with A as has been 
shown. It would seem also that the major makes the appro- 
priate beginning because it is the central and dominant factor 
in the vocation and because it must of all factors, usually, be 
most thoroughly mastered. If the major be an animal enter- 
prise the choice is reinforced by the superior interest which 
the living active animal has to the living moveless plant, by the 
immediate and continuous call for activity which the care of 
animals demands, by the fact that the enterprise can be 
started quite as successfully in the fall as in the spring. Yet 
those same considerations are equally forceful in the case of 
the animal minor. Again the animal enterprise often has the 
disadvantage of requiring a considerable accumulated capital, 
or that returns are for a considerable period deferred. 
Further the school tradition to which parents are accustomed 
sometimes makes the crop enterprise calling for relatively 
small outlay and yielding in a short time a lump return of con- 
siderable proportions the most effective means to securing an 
attitude favorable to further enterprises and the final business 
undertaking. The sequence of enterprises in the long course 
should not be dictated by state authority, but left to the dis- 
cretion of the teacher. 
Implied Studies—Out of the productive enterprises 
grows, as problem after problem is met by the boy, the neces- 
sity for practice to the development of appropriate skills; of 
study for the acquirement of facts, principles, methods, in- 
sights, standards—the technology required for intelligent 
control of production; of contacts and social experiences 
necessary at least to production. Out of the business under- 
taking grows the need for standards, methods, and principles of 
management, the evaluation of factors in production and in 
business and their organization to the end of economic success.
-P-A-G-E-125
  SUBJECT UNITS 125 
By the progressive order of enterprises and business respec- 
tively as actually conducted we can determine the sequence of 
vocational content in the formal instruction, class and indi- 
vidual, in the “ subjects ” of the course and in its final organic 
unification in the business year. That is, we arrange in the 
order of demand for them in the boys’ enterprises the teaching 
situations involved in mastery of the technic and technology 
of selection, nurture, mechanic control, protection, and dis- 
posal appropriate to each enterprise. In the business year we 
arrange a “subject” teaching the technic and technology 
appropriate to the codrdination and management of the actual 
business which pupils are carrying on. Or, in case one of the 
diagrams shown at end of the chapter, we teach in seasonal or 
“cyclical ” order the “ subjects ” of regional dairy cattle man- 
agement, hay growing, oat growing, silage corn growing and 
potato growing, with finally, dairy farm management for the 
region. In case two of the diagram (a middle western type) 
regional corn growing, hay growing, oat growing, wheat grow- 
ing, hog-raising, and regional corn- and hog-farm manage- 
ment make up the “ subjects ” of the course. 
Subject Units.—Each productive enterprise with the con- 
tent of the productive “ subject’ and the business under- 
taking with the content of its management “ subject ” is a unit 
in the course of study. The minimum vocational course for 
a farming vocation will consist in two or more such units. 
For, in the limiting case of the highly specialized vocation, 
such as lettuce growing, we may look upon the growing of 
lettuce first as a productive enterprise with its accompanying 
study of lettuce production—a first unit—and second as a 
business undertaking with its accompanying study of manage- 
ment in the lettuce business—a second unit. In the case of 
poultry farming and fruit growing work—study pairs stand 
out more clearly. In most of the farming vocations not less
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
than three are readily discernible, and often more, to be classi- 
fied in two, three or four groups. Thus, in the cases shown 
on, the diagram, 1 shows five productive units and one business 
unit; 2, the same; 3, nine productive units and one business 
unit. In every case the groups are four, one business and 
three productive groups. 
Manifestly in the cases cited, as in most others, each of 
these units constitutes a teaching project of approximately 
one year, or during one full cycle of production or of business. 
Now according to the plan already put forward for courses of 
one, two, three and four years (or cycles) all of these units 
may be carried in a single year, or distributed through several 
years in parallel groupings. A, for instance, represents in 
case I a dairy cattle unit, in case 2 a corn unit, in case 3 a 
corn unit, a cabbage unit and a potato unit carried in parallel ; 
F represents in every case three units in parallel; C in cases 
I and 2 single units, in case 3 three units in parallel. 
Grouping Like Units.—To teach units of the same class 
in parallel may be to effect a considerable economy. That 
shows plainly in A, case 3. Corn growing, cabbage grow- 
ing and potato growing have much in common as well 
as differences which may be brought out clearly by contrast— 
likenesses, for instance, in tillage and cultivation methods; 
differences in harvest and storage methods. The unit plan 
tends to delimit appropriate “subjects” and their teaching 
order, to allow of considerable flexibility in the adaptation of 
the course to particular groups of students. 
Further, just as there are common elements enabling 
economy in the teaching of similar units, so also there is over- 
lapping in the elements of types of farming to be found in the 
same region. At times this overlapping may be complete in 
the case of several units. Suppose that in the region of case 1 
there bea second type of farming in which sheep take the place “
-P-A-G-E-127
THE SCHOOL YEAR 127 
of dairy cattle as the major enterprises, then the two courses, 
one for dairy farmers, the other for sheep farmers, are iden- 
tical in all but the major productive unit and the business unit. 
Or there is a type of dairy farming in which butter is the cash 
product of the major and no cash crop other than hay is 
raised. The two courses overlap wholly within the F group 
and so largely in units A and A F C that much of the class 
work of prospective butter producers and milk producers may 
be done in common. In case 2 suppose a type of farming in 
which the minor C in hogs is replaced by minor C in beef 
cattle, A and F are identical for the two classes, and A F C 
for one class overlaps A F C for the other to a very large 
extent. Illustration has been carried far enough, perhaps, to 
show that strictly appropriate teaching for two or three types 
of farming vocations may be accomplished in the same school 
without doubling or trebling the teaching load. Indeed the 
margin of differences in certain units appropriate to several 
vocations may be covered sometimes solely by individual 
teaching, and often by such individual teaching with group 
differentiation among students only for brief periods of 
class work. 
The School Year.—One difficulty in the organization of 
teaching units about central productive enterprises appears at 
first sight in the fact that the school year in agriculture runs 
ordinarily from September to September—from the opening 
of one academic year to the beginning of another. The com- 
plete “cycle of production” is not at all likely to be co- 
terminous with such a school year. Ina dairy enterprise or a 
poultry enterprise no great difficulty is found in maintain- 
ing the course of instruction in accord with the developing 
problems of the pupil over the greater part of the period. 
Culling and silo filling may be taught, for example, in the first 
September rather than the second September, though the voca-  
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 UNIT PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL COURSE 
tional situation and motive are lost if those jobs are undertaken 
apart from any immediate need of the pupil to cull his own 
birds or to get his own corn into the silo. With animals nor- 
mally marketed in cold weather, with many cash crops and 
some feed crops, finishing of the work begun in one school 
year carries over several weeks or even months into the second 
school year. If the unit teaching is to be genuine and not 
artificial in its latter phases, then, classroom, laboratory, shop 
and field studies appropriate to the enterprise should go with 
it from beginning to end, regardless of the traditional dates of 
beginning and ending in subjects taught wholly in a school 
environment. Animal enterprises may properly begin in the 
fall of the year with the opening of the academic year. But 
crop enterprises in relatively few cases do appropriately begin 
at that time. In cases requiring fall plowing, initial hill selec- 
tion, and the like, the amount of fall work is so small that com- 
petition between beginning enterprises and those completing 
the cycle is practically nil. Teaching of many crop units may 
most favorably run from “midyear” to midyear, or from 
“ midyear ” till November or December of the following year. 
When once two classes or more are under way in an agricul- 
tural course of more than one year there will be no gaps in the 
teacher’s program. In his first year a gap of weeks or months 
may be profitably used in the study of his teaching resources in 
the community. Ina course of one year only it may be wise 
that his employment, and the enrollment of his pupils, who are 
to spend but one year in school, should begin with the academic 
second semester, pupils graduating in February or earlier in- 
stead of in June. In the case of four year students in a four 
year high school no serious difficulty in program or schedule 
is introduced by following the “cycle” in such fashion, and 
the vocational teaching may be much stronger than in the case  
-P-A-G-E-129
TIME AND CREDIT 129 
where instruction in farm crops or gardening or fruit runs 
from September to September. 
Time and Credit.—lIn the present, it is not possible to set 
up an accurate balance in time allowance and credit allowance 
between the agricultural units and the standard high school 
units in other “subjects,” such as physics, chemistry and 
English. That is we cannot say that a unit of potato growing 
will call for two hundred and fifty-two school periods distrib- 
uted 3-2-2 weekly during 36 weeks, or one hundred and eighty 
periods distributed equally throughout the days of the school 
year as we do with physics and geometry. The assumption 
that 180 recitation periods in English = 180 recitation periods 
in geometry = 108 recitation periods plus 72 double laboratory 
periods in physics or chemistry is purely arbitrary, but is con- 
venient in school administration. Taking the accepted stand- 
ards that 1 recitation = 2 laboratory periods = 3 shop periods 
or field work periods it becomes possible to find approximate 
equivalents in agriculture. Thus if the unit dairy cattle call 
for 72 periods in recitation, 36 periods in laboratory and 216 
periods in shop and field work, it constitutes a standard high 
school unit as truly as does the recognized unit in physics. On 
such a basis it will be possible for administrators tomake allow- 
ance of credit for instruction in agriculture. But to assume, for 
instance, that A will equal 1 or 114 standard units, F ¥ or 1, 
C¥Y%ortand AFC tor 1¥, is not safe, though in line with 
the present practice which allows 4, 6, or 8 units of credit 
uniformly to the high school courses in agriculture. Only 
experience in specific preparation for specific agricultural 
vocations will yield a norm for each, and those norms are far 
more likely to be significant for regions than for states or for 
the country at large. Equivalents ranging from two or less 
credit units to eight or more may confidently be expected. 
But, the writer ventures the opinion that the majority of cases

will fall between four and six, rather than between six 
and eight. 
Ratings for credit will have to be made on a somewhat

in dealing with persons, or social ability. Some suggestions 
as to how such ratings may be made will be given further on. 
Standards of school credit based on period of attendance 
and evidence of ability present no insuperable difficulties, but 
demand careful attention from teachers and administrators. 
Nore.—It is recognized that “projects” as approved under 
the vocational education laws of many states are now fre- 
quently productive enterprises or even business undertakings 
in the sense in which those forms of teaching have already 
been discussed. But “ project” is by no means a synonym 
for enterprise in agricultural teaching. No agreement as yet 
exists as to the significance of the word which has come into 
so wide use in education. “ Project ” may mean a forecasting 
into practice of principles already learned, a forecast in the 
form of a plan of procedure, both of which uses appear 
reasonable in the light of etymology, or “ project”? may stand 
for the problem in teaching, in which use it has the support 
of a large number of writers in education. A hasty scanning 
of a dozen manuals and bulletins on the writer’s desk, 
assembled for another purpose reveals examples of varied 
understanding of the terms “‘ project ” and “ home project.”

CHAPTER IX 
ADAPTIVENESS OR ADAPTATION? 
Tue fifth category of elements common to the organiza- 
tion of state systems of agricultural education raises the 
questions of selection of content and determination of method. 
It seems to indicate in a general way the conception prevail- 
ing of the nature of a genuinely vocational content; and 
the essential criterion of a genuinely vocational method 
of teaching. 
Vocational content will consist in skills pertinent to the 
art of agricultural production; knowledge pertinent to the 
art of agricultural production; social abilities pertinent to 
the art of agricultural production. Vocational method, in 
part at least, will consist in active work productive of agri- 
cultural utilities. The standards are reasonable, acceptable, 
and in some considerable measure helpful. But we know of 
course that it is not possible, necessary, or even desirable, that 
any given individual should acquire or any school attempt to 
develop in its pupils all the skills, knowledges and social abili- 
ties pertinent to agricultural production, that it is not possible 
or necessary for any individual to acquire all the skills, 
knowledge and business ability needful in a given agricultural 
occupation by direct activity in it during the school period 
devoted to vocational training. In some agricultural occupa- 
tions a proximate perfection might be so achieved, but in most, 
nothing like perfection could be so achieved. 
So far as occupations may serve to determine content, or 
what should be taught, the key to such determination is in the 
relative stability or instability of the environmental situations 
135  
-P-A-G-E-136
  136 ADAPTIVENESS OR ADAPTATION ? 
therein found. If such situations are constant in their 
features, frequent in their recurrence, to that extent the occu- 
pation has what may tentatively be designated a trade aspect 
and it becomes possible to mechanize the responses of the 
learner who must face them. The aim of vocational education 
becomes trade adaptation. If such situations are inconstant 
in their features, infrequent in their occurrence, to that extent 
the occupation has what, for want of a better term, we may 
call a professional aspect, and it becomes possible only to 
teach such responses as are based on elements common to 
many of the occupational situations as they can be classified 
and foreseen. The aim of vocational education is professional 
adaptiveness. In general, where dealings with ideas and with 
men* play a large part in occupational success the vocation is 
a profession; where dealings with things static and con- 
trollable play a large part, the vocation is a tradef But in 
every agricultural occupation all three sorts of situations 
must be met. We cannot say that professional adaptiveness 
is our sole aim in one, trade adaptation in another. To de- 
termine the content of our teaching accurately we must know 
how much and what of professional adaptiveness, of trade 
adaptation is required in the occupation with which we 
are concerned. 
But that we do not know in the case of a single occupation 
in agriculture. Years, not hours, of research and study by 
many competent men, of the characteristics of agricultural 
occupations must be given before we can pretend to accuracy 
in estimate of requirements in a dynamic field of industry. 
Nevertheless, there are no doubt very considerable differences 
of incidence in the aims of adaptiveness and adaptation 
throughout the range of vocations in agriculture. The fol-

lowing chart may serve to suggest certain probable differences 
characteristic of groups of such occupations. The order from 
professional to trade characterization is not at all certainly 
correct, the proportionate emphasis in the case of the learning 
of any one much less so. But it is upon some such scheme, 
derivative of analysis and test, not of observation and opinion, 
that we must rest for the first selection of what shall be 
taught in any given case.

  CHAPTER X 
CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
For determination of content in the vocational course in 
agriculture the first requirement is a clear conception of the 
purpose of that course. Assume, we must, that a phasis of 
purpose is preparation for effective function in the vocation, 
whether it be that of entrepreneurial farming with a major 
enterprise in market milk production, poultry farming for 
the production of “ fancy first day eggs,” foremanship in di- 
rection of a gang of cranberry pickers, workmanship in root 
grafting of nursery stock or digging of irrigation ditches. 
The demands of the vocation in terms of skills, technical 
knowledges, social abilities, as they exist now in the local or 
standard status of that vocation, as through examination of 
the variations in that vocation, its inter-relationship to other 
vocations and activities of a dynamic social order, they most 
evidently will change—those demands will set up the spe- 
cific proximate aims to which we must adjust course content 
and method, those establish for us the objective situations to 
which we must plan to enable the learner to adjust himself. 
By such specific aims only can we determine effective edu- 
cation of the learner for his vocation. Having found the job, 
we analyze it, statically and in the dynamic aspect. 
Type.—Having formulated clearly the objectives in skills, 
knowledges, insights, and social abilities which must be de- 
veloped for effective participation in production, we are con- 
fronted with the problem of selecting teaching means. Here 
we meet in inseparable composition the elements of subject 
matter and method. We must teach what is needed for voca- 
138
-P-A-G-E-139
TYPE 139 
tional success. Yet we must teach under more or less limited 
conditions of educative environment one who is by nature 
equipped with certain tendencies to action, who by experience 
has acquired a large and variant range of meanings, habits, 
predispositions, and who must be considered from the point of 
view of consequences to his own welfare as a human being 
and member of society. The content of our course is 
determined by criteria derivative of (1) demands of vocation, 
(2) educative environment, (3) the characteristics of 
the learner. 
If the situations to be met are unstable and uncontrolled, 
as largely they are in the professional aspects of a calling, we 
must select teaching content in terms of the seen and predict- 
able likenesses of groups of these unstable situations, in order 
that the farmer or workman may enter intelligently, with a 
degree of familiarity, upon the solution of problems which 
arise under that aspect of his vocation. That is, we choose 
for educative purposes those activities which are typical of one 
or another of the groups of situations which represent pro- 
fessional demands ; those in which the elements of actuality are 
in as large degree as possible common with those in predictable 
situations. In some cases those elements may constitute a 
minor fraction of the total, in others a major fraction, only by 
chance can adaptiveness equal perfect adaptation. 
For example, take the case of “dairy major” farming. 
There is a group of skills in the production of forage crops 
for cattle, as (a) mowing crops of the grass type. Mowing 
green clover on a level field on a damp morning is not mowing 
alfalfa on a hillside on a hot afternoon, much less mowing 
light timothy, oats, and peas, tall rye and the like. Moreover, 
driving dad’s light horses to an Osborne mower, four and a 
half-foot bar, is not driving a pair of Percherons to a Deering 
mower, six-foot bar. Harnessing the light pair after a long 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
| rest on a raw, windy morning is not the same job as harnessing 
the heavy pair in regular work after a sultry July nooning. 
Driving a “ hard mouthed ” pair in heavy grass is not driving 
a tender-mouthed pair in light oats. The actual situations in- 
volved in this group are similar in many respects but never 
identical. If we choose as the educative activity the harness- 
ing to a mower of the home farm team and cutting ten acres 
of mixed hay, in the latter part of June, we shall certainly 
enable the boy to approach the jobs of harvesting clover, rye, 
alfalfa, oats and peas, etc., much more effectively than if he 
had no such experience as cutting hay on that particular farm 
in that particular season with that particular pair of horses and 
make of mower. The situation used is typical of the predict- 
able situations in considerable, if varying measure. It would 
be utterly futile to attempt even experience, much more per- 
fected drill, to meet all the possible situations within the group. 
A lifetime would hardly suffice, and the gain in new elements 
could never be justified on grounds of economy in education 
or in vocation. The law of diminishing returns operates 
effectively in both cases. Like considerations would govern 
in the cases of groups of skills as (b) plowing, harrowing, 
rolling for forage crops, (c) loading, hauling and storing 
away forage crops, etc. Yet these are skills, objectively 
measurable in a given case. With knowledges such as bal- 
ancing dairy rations or evaluating fertilizers type selection 
is obvious. | 
Take the case of the retail market gardener. In consider- 
able measure his success depends upon abilities in dealing 
with individuals as (a) seedsmen, fertilizer dealers, stable 
keepers, (b) hired help, men, women, boys and girls of vary- 
ing nationalities, capacity and upbringing, (c) grocers, clerks, 
professional buyers, housewives, in all the multifarious varia- 
tions of character, attitude, etc., which make them individuals.
-P-A-G-E-141
  TYPE 141 
In the latter group, for instance, it is hardly possible that we 
should adapt the boy to selling celery to widow Smith, lettuce 
to Mrs. Jones’ butler, sweet corn to the fat clerk at the Main 
Street grocery, or onions to the buyer for the People’s Market 
Company, with equal deftness and facility. The very indi- 
viduals named are inconstant variables. Multiply them by a 
score or a hundred, introduce the successive crops of the 
season, etc., and the range of possible situations becomes incal- 
culably large. Yet, to a certain degree, these situations do 
possess common elements. If we set the learner the task of 
selling half a dozen kinds of vegetables throughout the season 
to the housewives, clerks, inn-keepers, grocers and so on, who 
are the purchasing consumers of such products in his neigh- 
borhood, we have done something to develop ability in meet- 
ing somewhat like situations when he goes into the business of 
market gardening at retail there or elsewhere. Perfect adap- 
tation we cannot give him, but a greater or less adaptiveness 
we can develop by type selection. 
Skills in actual control of plants and animals, social abili- 
ties in dealing with persons for the purchase, production, and 
sale of farm products, are themselves controlled by organized 
systems of subjective meanings, technical knowledge. What 
to do, how to do it, when to do it, why to do it, are matters of 
knowing and thinking. There is a technology of mowing 
forage crops, of selling vegetables at retail. To know when 
inthe season and in the day to cut hay, at what height to cut, in 
what course to drive, why these things should be done, is to 
use facts, principles, thinking processes in large measure like 
to those used in cutting rye, clover, oats, alfalfa. No complete 
new field of knowledge must be mastered for each operation. 
The technology of hay cutting “ carries over ” into other oper- 
ations. In the same way if the boy learns how and why he 
should act in selling cabbage to Mrs. van den Berg, Mrs. Riley, 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
butler Graves and grocer Johnson, he has not everything to 
learn anew in the case of other housewives, butlers and 
grocers. The technology of selling cabbages in the neighbor- 
hood is typical of that for selling vegetables to human 
beings anywhere. 
What are the actual “ bonds” that are found in each of 
those cases, what and how they function in new and some- 
what like situations, we do not know. That the “ carry over ” 
from one skill to another, from one social ability to another, 
from one technology to another, is what we assume from 
objective data that it should be, is not at all certain. But that 
a man who has learned to do a good job at mowing hay will do 
a better job at mowing clover than an equally capable indi- 
vidual who has never mowed anything is certain. Two sales- 
men equal in capacity will be far apart in success in selling 
vegetables new to both, if one be experienced with cabbage 
and onions, the other with none at all. Doing and knowing a 
like job does count, or all human experience is vain, and the 
laws of probability mere vapor. But at present we can pro- 
ceed only on the assumption that what appears to be like is 
like. (Notre.—Even in the few cases of tested transfer in 
relatively simple traits, just what are the common elements the 
psychologist cannot say. He assumes apparently identical 
situations to be identical.) 
Frequency.—On the other hand certain situations in 
every occupation of agriculture are relatively fixed, so that a 
perfected, even automatized response may be approximated. 
No two yearling peach trees are of the same diameter, no 
two buds for inset identical in form, but so nearly are these 
factors stable, that the budder finds no perceptible modifica- 
tion in procedure necessary from the first tree to the thou- 
sandth. In the still more complex skill of castrating young 
pigs the situation varies from pig to pig so slightly that the
-P-A-G-E-143
ULTIMATE CERTAINTY 143 
expert operator may well be able to discuss the forthcoming 
election without interrupting the deft movements of his knife 
as pig after pig is handed to him. Still more is that the case 
with the operation of machinery. A make of machine once 
mastered, the operator is free to handle its duplicate with a 
minimum of readaptation. Many tool processes, particularly 
where the tool is used for one standard operation only, reveal 
the same fixity of situation and possibility of perfect adapta- 
tion. Measuring grain, throwing in hay to the cattle, sorting 
fruit, picking cranberries, and scores of other operations used 
in agriculture approximate the same static fixity of situation. 
It is possible, then, to set up the aim of adaptation in dis- 
tinctly trade aspects of agricultural vocations. But where 
shall we attempt automatized adaptations? The most accept- 
able criterion is that of frequency. If the same situation must 
be met again and again in the pursuit of the vocation as a 
condition of success, then the gain in speed, ease and freedom 
from conscious effort, possible through habituation, is a dis- 
tinct asset. Nor is this criterion usable only in the case of 
skills, There may be certain “ facts ” and meanings of words 
so frequently called into use by the vocation that they may be 
economically memorized. 
Ultimate Certainty.—There are undoubtedly cases of 
skills in particular, and of knowledges to a less degree, in the 
agricultural vocations, wherein frequency is not the first guide 
to approximate adaptation. Should a dairy farmer learn to do 
a good job at shingling or papering a roof? Certainly he is 
only infrequently called upon to do so in the pursuit of his 
vocation, perhaps not a dozen times in a lifetime. Yet the 
need for roof repair in a vocation wherein closed shelters play 
so large a part is ultimately certain in dairy farming as we 
know it in this country. It will come up as sure as fate. For 
the skilled machinist, constantly employed, we should prob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
144 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
ably agree that time spent in repairing the roof of his dwelling 
or garage is time relatively wasted. It would pay him to 
employ a competent roofer to do the job, while he worked at 
one for which he is better fitted. But the case of the dairy 
farmer is different. Much of what he does must be done, be- 
cause at the time no more profitable activity offers. Witness 
the growing of oats, the mowing of fence rows, the digging 
of ditches. He can make more in haying time or at silo filling 
by sticking to his job than by stopping to shingle, but it may 
well be, and probably frequently is the case, that he can save 
money by investing his time in the autumn in a shingling job 
rather than in hauling stones, or in any work that the farm 
then offers. If he saves forty dollars by a week’s work on 
the roof, while he hires a man at fifteen dollars to pick rocks 
he is wise not to call in the more speedy but expensive roofer. 
In like manner sometime or other he must meet such prob- 
lems as selecting ‘a silo, treating for bloat, casting a cow, 
treating for milk fever, buying a sire, hanging a stanchion, 
removing a hide, finding a substitute for cotton-seed meal, 
packing a pump, preventing abortion, and many others not 
necessarily of frequent occurrence. 
Evolutionary Values.—If, in those aspects of any occu- 
pation in agriculture which verge upon the professional, type 
is the criterion of selection; if, in those aspects which verge 
upon the trade, frequency is a first criterion; if, in either 
aspect, ultimate certainty be a determiner of choice, then it 
is probable that content selection is valid in the present status 
of the vocation. But vocations in agriculture are not static. 
The methods of meeting recurrent problems change and in 
their evolution present new problems ; influences from without 
the vocation come in to modify practices and change demands.

set the milk in shallow pans on shelves in a cool room or

separation by the centrifugal hand separator, with the cooling 
of the cream in deep vessels in ice water till the visit of the

to creameries for separation by turbine separators. At present 
the standard method is delivery to a skimming station. Like 
changes over the same period are exemplified in the case of 
cream ripening, churning, packing of butter, in the evolution 
of ensilage practices, harvest practices, stock judging technic 
and technology, manuring practices, etc. Though rates of 
change vary enormously from vocation to vocation, from 
period to period, yet the process is characteristic of all 
activities vocational. What is at present typical is not cer- 
tainly typical of the past, nor of the future; what is frequent 
10 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  146 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
now may not be frequent in the future or have been so in the 
past; what is a certain characteristic of to-day, may not have 
been so characteristic of the past in the vocation or be so of 
its future. 
The distribution of vocational activities according to the 
normal curve (Quetelet) and the suggestion of evolutionary 
movement may be found in the diagram on page 145. The 
division into periods is arbitrary, as are the divisions denom- 
inated conservative, established, radical, and the zone 
of selection. 
It will be noted that there is a gradual shift of the norm 
as time goes on. There is a reaching forward for new or 
better solutions of problems, a testing and acceptance of those 
fitter till they become the fit of the day, and a gradual dim- 
inution in use of the less fit to the point of final rejection. 
What was standard practice in 1880 is below the norm of 
practice to-day. (1) The farmer who chooses a milch cow 
according to the size and depth of the pit under her forearm, 
who slits her tail to “reduce the pressure which results in 
bloody milk,” still exists, as does he who plants his potatoes 
only in the dark of the moon. Such methods are ultra-con- 
servative, dying out. (2) The farmer who uses two men, one 
to drive and one to hold, in plowing, who places his manure 
in the hill, represents conservative practice less near the line 
of the obsolete. (3) He who holds and drives himself a pair 
in plowing, and dumps his manure in heaps from the cart tail 
before spreading, represents established practice on the con- 
servative side of the norm. (4) To spread broadcast from 
the cart is near the norm; to spread by manure spreader is 
established practice in advance of the norm, as is to drive 
three or four horses in the plow team. (5) To use the self- 
feeder for hogs is radical practice sufficiently tested out to be 
almost certainly a future norm of feeding practice. (6) To

PROGRESS VALUES 147 
keep the hens busy twelve hours a day in the winter by the 
use of electric light is ultra-radical practice, not yet sufficiently 
tested or accepted, to stand as a certain index to future 
standards. At the one extreme we have abilities once fit, but 
now largely supplanted by the fitter, which are clung to by 
force of habit and custom among individuals and communities 
where neither educational nor economic pressure forces them 
out ; at the other, abilities tentatively developed by suggestion 
of experiment station workers, innovations of “ original ” 
workers, tentative adoptions from foreign practice, etc. 
Now it is the function of schools to “ disseminate accepted 
knowledge ”; of agricultural teaching to develop abilities of 
proved worth. Teachers of agriculture are not innovators, 
discoverers, as the experimentalists primarily are. Neither are 
they traditionalists to “ hand over ” uncritically, unselectively, 
all that comes out of the past. They must avoid the extremes 
of the dying fit at the one end, and the unproven, if possible 
fittest, at the other. ‘“ Prove all things.” That is what the 
evolutionary process of vocation is doing. “ Hold fast to that 
which is good.” That the evolutionary process will inevitably 
do. But we have given the educator and teacher responsibility 
in the conscious control of the process, that suffering and 
waste may be avoided. Let them be sure that what posterity 
has handed down belongs with the good of to-day before they 
teach it ; let them be sure that what innovators suggest as good 
is proved good before they teach it. Between the extremes of 
ultra-conservative and ultra-radical lies the zone of vocational 
experience in the light of which they must use the standards 
of type, frequency and certainty to the determination of con- 
tent in the vocational course. 
Survival Values and Progress Values.—Those skills 
knowledges, and social abilities, which, derivative of tradition, 
now are in use by the majority in the vocation have unques- 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
tionably survival value; those derivative of recent innovation 
which are coming visibly to adoption by a substantial and in- 
creasing proportion of those engaged in the vocation, have 
progress value—are indicative most clearly (as the nearer 
landmarks on the shore are to the outgoing oarsman) of the 
‘direction in which we move. Consideration of those values, 
drawn from dynamic conception of vocation, must condition 
the choice of activities typical, activities frequent, activities 
ultimately certain, of the vocation, as means to education for 
success in the vocation. 
A Common Error.—The thesis that the function of the 
teacher of agriculture is not innovation, but teaching of the 
proved fit and proving fitter in farm practices and technology 
is almost certain to be unacceptable to the young and enthusi- 
astic graduate of the agricultural college. His mission as he 
conceives it is the “improvement of agriculture” by intro- 
ducing new methods to replace the old. His attitude is some- 
times revealed as in the answer given me by a young enthusiast 
in his first year of teaching. “Do I use these farms and 
farmers in teaching my boys? You bet I do. I use them to 
show the boys what they ought not to do, and what they ought 
not to be.” 
The thesis, which it is hardly necessary or appropriate to 
develop here anew, is commonly recognized by educators, 
most specifically in the distinction between the research and 
the teaching functions of the university. The research worker 
engages in the search for new truth, he seeks out new and 
promising ways of solving the problems of humanity. When, 
by experimental verification and most careful weighing he 
considers his hypotheses or his conclusions worthy, he places 
them before his colleagues for criticism and evaluation. If 
they are accepted they are published as suggestive to those 
in economic or other social fields of promising improvement in
-P-A-G-E-149
  A COMMON ERROR 149 
those fields. There, by the more venturesome or open minded, 
they are put to the test of practice. If they prove workable, 
useful, they become a part of the established order—accepted 
truth, and the teacher takes his turn as disseminator of that 
accepted truth. 
In the agricultural college we have an agency whose chief 
function is the discovery of new truth, the agricultural experi- 
ment station, and one—the extension service—an important 
function of which is the publishing among farmers of con- 
clusions reached and methods suggested by the experimental 
staff. For the most part experiment stations recognize their 
limitations in respect to test in economy, and put forth careful 
explanations of the limitations under which they have worked 
and of the tentative nature of the suggestions they have to 
offer. For the most part the extension service is careful in the 
publishing of such work in popular form to make clear its 
tentative nature. But now and then enthusiasm or ignorance 
carries the publishing agent away. Probably no sound scientist, 
no sound student of sociology or economics, ever advocated 
“alfalfa on every farm,” “ fertilize your apple trees, if you 
have but two,” “a farmer on every forty,” “a tractor on every 
farm,” “a school at every crossroads.” But such have consti- 
tuted the “slogans” of publicity campaigns in some of 
our states. 
Because experiment station data show that on a certain 
experiment station farm alfalfa is a crop of prime value, that 
fertilizer in the orchard pays a profit, that a tractor is more 
economical than two teams of horses, may be good ground for 
suggesting to farmers that those things are worth trying out. 
But the very fact that farmers have tried them out shows that 
in many regions they are not truths to be taught prospective 
farmers, as truly as in many others that they are. That is 
they become truths or not truths not by virtue of the findings 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
of the experiment station, but by virtue of the fact that they 
prove economically worth while or not, when put to the test of 
practice by farmers in the various regions. Experiment 
stations are wise enough to revise and even reverse their sug- 
gestions in the light of farm test and further experiment. 
Witness the reversal in standard recommendations for pruning 
orchards from ten years ago to to-day. The experimental 
scientist seldom or never considers his conclusions final, his 
hypotheses as more than tentative means to discovery. 
But the teacher may argue “ at least I must teach my boys 
to be open-minded, to be willing and ready to make trial of 
promising methods.” Granted. But it is suggested that wise 
teaching will see that the first ventures are attended by suc- 
cess—in other words that the innovations tried are innovations 
to the individual only. Perhaps the least open-minded farmer 
is he who has tried an enthusiastically recommended new 
method and found it a costly failure. Perhaps the most open- 
minded is he who has tried several “ new ” methods and found 
them profitable. He is ready to put up with occasional failure 
then, because his faith has been established by success. 
But the “ progressive” farmer does not progress through 
imitation only. He is an inventor and discoverer of new 
solutions to problems himself. A recent writer in School and 
Society has stated that an important aim in vocational educa- 
tion is education in invention. He is probably right. But how 
it is to be done he does not say. Genius or a lesser capacity 
for origination is native and not a product of education. But 
it develops through specific use as do all abilities. Originality, 
as has been pointed out, consists in using old data in new ways. 
Education can furnish the old data, exactly as has been indi- 
cated above; further it can, by opening opportunities for 
initiative and well chosen opportunities for initial successes, 
encourage that initiative and develop an attitude of thoughtful
-P-A-G-E-151
  CAUTIONS 151 
adventuring, and it can do no more. To teach a boy to dis- 
cover a method already known to the teacher is to give him 
an experience in invention. But we cannot teach him to invent 
a method unknown to agriculture. That he accomplishes by 
reconstruction of experience data that we may have helped 
him to, and by virtue of the attitude we have encouraged, but 
not by teaching through the specific act. Accordingly, no new 
criterion for the selection of content arises out of the attempt 
to stimulate inventiveness. 
A Real Difficulty.—There is a case, however, in which 
the use of survival and progress values in selection of content 
cannot be used in terms of the region. That is in the case of 
a newly opened region. Suppose a school to be established 
in a reclamation project opened within but a few years. It 
would appear that the teacher must here be a genuine inno- 
vator. The evolutionary process of selection has not gone far 
enough to give him guidance. Suppose there are in use ac- 
cording to the traditions of settlers from various parts of the 
country, three kinds of irrigation practice, namely, the fur- 
row system, the basin system, and the wild flooding system. 
Which shall he advocate or emphasize in his teaching? That 
which most of the settlers are using, or that which those 
settlers he considers most intelligent are using? Not neces- 
sarily either. He must cast about to discover an older irri- 
gated section in which conditions are most like to those of the 
new, and select from that the method which experience there 
has proved most effective, as the basis of his teaching. In 
other words, intelligent procedure indicates the use of the 
evolutionary criteria just in so far as data of such are available 
for his use. 
Cautions.—The foregoing discussion and diagram may 
suggest conceptions of agricultural vocations and consequent 
teaching content to a certain degree misleading. That voca- 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
tions in agriculture such as dairy farming for the production 
of milk for the wholesale market, apple growing for the fancy 
trade, egg production for the retail market, threshing for 
farmers, dairy farm employment, fruit packing, budding, etc., 
exist as vocations per se, constant in the rate of changing 
demands upon the participant, and in their static or dynamic 
indices of guidance to the teacher, is not strictly true. Each of 
those rather stands for a group of vocations among which 
the elements in common are many. The growing of Jonathan 
apples as a major interest of the fruit farmer in the Yakima 
Valley is not the same vocation as major apple growing with 
the Albemarle Pippin in West Virginia or the Northern Spy 
in western Michigan. Dairy farming for whole milk pro- 
duction in central Illinois is a different vocation from dairy 
farming for whole milk production in central Vermont. 
Turkey raising in the San Joaquin Valley is not the vocation 
of turkey raising on the shore of Narragansett Bay. Although 
Californian and Rhode Islander, Illinoisan and Vermonter, 
Washingtonian and Michigander would undoubtedly profit 
to a considerable degree from a vocational course in turkey 
raising, dairy farming, apple growing, yet it is probable that 
we can more effectively promote the success of each by 
setting up our instruction according to the aim of preparation 
for the regional variant, the more specific vocation. Regional 
differences must come in to determine more specifically the 
aims of teaching than can any study of the norm of the 
vocational group. That consideration holds more strongly of 
the entrepreneurial than of the minor vocations of agricul- 
ture. To thresh wheat in eastern Washington is not a job 
identical with that of threshing wheat in eastern Indiana, but 
the degree of difference is small as compared with the farming 
instances already cited. The boy who learns to thresh white 
beans in Ontario County, New York, is practically fitted to
-P-A-G-E-153
  CAUTIONS 153 
thresh white beans in Isabella County, Michigan. The trained 
Holstein herdsman of Wisconsin can shift to Oregon with 
little loss in efficiency, the budder trained in Georgia has little 
to learn of budding when he goes to Connecticut. Regional 
differences count for much less in such cases. Intermediate, 
probably between the farming vocations and the trade vo- 
cations in respect to regional influence is the case of the farm 
hand, skilled and unskilled. The skilled dairy hand can “ carry 
over’? much learned in one region to the next, but must 
make considerable readjustments. The unskilled hand worker 
on the truck farm in Florida will be no green hand on Long 
Island though he have some things to learn. Of course the 
influence here is dependent on employment within the same 
groups of vocations. Obviously the Georgia cotton hand is as 
little fitted to effective employment in Aroostook County, 
Maine, as is the Slavic stevedore of Hoboken. 
It is not possible to give in one region of characteristic type 
of farming vocations, training strictly appropriate even to 
like vocations that are characterized by conditions of a dis- 
tinctly different region. Thus the student who would prepare 
for apple growing under irrigation on the volcanic ash soils 
of Washington is wise to make his preparation in a school of 
that region, and not in Niagara County, New York, or Grand 
Traverse County, Michigan. Yet it is clear that the student 
trained in northeastern apple growing is far from untrained 
if he takes up orcharding in the Yakima Valley, though he 
have many new things to learn and some to unlearn. The 
student who decides to move out of the region in which he 
gained his vocational training does not discard all of its bene- 
fits if he enters the same class of vocation. The fact is worth 
noting, since such cases must be frequent. 
Even the student of such training who decides upon citrus 
fruit growing in California probably has acquired few inter-
-P-A-G-E-154
t 
  154 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
fering habits, and many which will increase his adaptiveness 
over that of the man untrained in any sort of orchard work. 
Such a one may gain much by comparison and contrast of 
book-described methods and practices in orange or lemon 
growing with those with which he is familiar. He has a basis 
for interpretation of books, bulletins, lectures, and even corre- 
spondence courses that will make them much more profitable 
to him than they can be to an untrained man or one trained 
in dairy farming practices. There is no advocacy here of an 
attempt to educate a Pacific Coast farmer in New York State, 
but a recognition of the fact that the trained man of the north- 
eastern states is still in considerable measure a trained man if 
circumstances cause him to move to a distant locality to pur- 
sue a similar occupation. No one would advise the boy of 
Texas to move to Massachusetts for learning onion growing, 
but the Massachusetts youngster who sees a possible future 
in Texas “ Bermudas ” may profit considerably by a “ unit” 
in onion growing in a Connecticut Valley school. For pupils 
of that sort our courses cannot be built, but to them they 
should not be represented as valueless. 
Local Opportunity—In the preparatory sense it is 
doubtful that schools—day schools or schools at which at- 
tendance is compulsory—can serve to definitely specific voca- 
tional training for strictly local variants of the agricultural 
pursuits. The writer is unacquainted with statistical data that 
bear on this point, though such may be forthcoming in the next 
decade, with the growth of centralized administration of local 
high school departments. It is yet to be proved that the 
majority of boys who demand training for specific agricultural 
pursuits through the service of a local school, should 
or will take up those pursuits in the township in which 
the school is located. It is a fairer assumption, perhaps, that 
they should and’ will pursue those vocations in the majority of
-P-A-G-E-155
LOCAL OPPORTUNITY 155 
cases in the region wherein the school is located. But that is 
on grounds of probability merely.t We are not yet certain 
of our ground even here. Thus, that regional considerations 
should prevail over the strictly local in the determination of the 
characteristics of vocation by which content shall be selected 
appears a safer judgment than that the “ local demands ” and 
“needs” of Lime Crossing or Jackmantown shall determine 
the content of vocational courses. In the case of state or 
county schools regional standards obviously are first. In the 
case of short courses at local schools, extension teaching from 
that centre, or part time classes with those already engaged 
in local pursuits the dominance of “local demand” is cer- 
tainly clear. 
But, in any case, local considerations are of first rate im- 
portance. The community in which the teacher works sets the 
educative environment through which he must work. The 
physical surroundings, both natural and created of man, the 
social surroundings—personal, economic, and of group atti- 
tude, in the local community are the actualities with which he 
must deal. Thus what specific and specific-type activities he 
shall select for the content of his course must be determined 
by the opportunity for effective teaching in the locality. For 
instance: In a region devoted to corn growing as a major 
interest, the majority of farmers broadcast their manure; an 
increasing number and considerable proportion use the manure 
spreader for that purpose. But the school is located in a town- 
ship where, perhaps, half the farmers still stick to dumping 
heaps from the cart tail and hill manuring, half spread broad- 
cast from the cart, and there is not a spreader on the home 
farm of a single pupil. For positive practice in the conduct 
of their own corn enterprises by pupils the teacher cannot 
  
+ However, the study of the case of Franklin Academy by Dr. 
C. J. Galpin points to the same conclusion.
-P-A-G-E-156
156 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
insist on spreading by the more progressive method ; he must 
use the means at hand, the carts and forks, to see that the boys 
use the practice of broadcasting. It is probable that he can by 
comparison in economy of time show the superiority of that 
method to the more conservative method, and again, by obser- 
vation on a trip, and by data gathered from the region, etc., its 
inferior economy to that of the more progressive method. 
But that he can teach any effective degree of skill in the use 
of the manure spreader is out of the question—and not very 
much is lost if he has established in the minds of his pupils the 
value of the broadcasting method. 
Again suppose the case of two schools in a region of dairy 
farming where milk is delivered to a skimming station by col- 
lectors. In one case the school is half a mile from such a 
station ; in the other twelve miles. Assuming that a knowledge 
of the way in which milk is handled at the station, is of some, 
if minor value, to the dairy farmer, as a guide to the handling 
of his own milk previously to delivery, shall a visit to a station 
for study of methods be a part of the course in both instances ? 
Probably not. In the first case a couple of hours in the after- 
noon might well be worth while; in the second a twenty-four 
mile drive and a day off would rarely be worth the expense, 
time and effort expended. The second teacher might substi- 
tute a reading for the visit. But clearly that is to give to the 
two courses designed for the same end a different content 
because of different conditions of local opportunity. In- 
stances might be indefinitely multiplied, but those given may, 
perhaps, serve to illustrate the effects of local conditions 
upon course content. 
Seasonal Opportunity.—Seasonal opportunity is again 
a factor in determining just what we shall teach as well as 
our sequence in teaching. Take a single example. Two 
schools are located in an apple raising section; both are in
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PUPIL 157 
apple-growing townships ; both devote the same total of hours» 
to the course in apple growing; but one opens the year Sep- 
tember 3rd, the other November 15th. Which will teach most 
with regard to fruit and tree characteristics of regional 
varieties of apples? The picking, handling and grading of 
apples? Both, to be sure, may consider the same “ topic ” but 
the actual content of educative experience for the boys who 
learn will clearly be greater in the first. Consequently the 
two courses differ in content because of the factor of season, 
not because of differences in vocational demand or 
local opportunity. 
Of the factors in determination of content, the first four, 
type, frequency, ultimate certainty, evolutionary values, are 
of importance to both the administrator and the teacher. It 
may well be that the administrator with his superior oppor- 
tunities for travel, observation and study of regional voca- 
tions in agriculture, should control in the selection of content, 
so far as these factors go, But in the use of the factors 
derivative of teaching environment the teacher has the ad- 
vantage, and his judgment should be given greater weight than 
that of the supervisor, assuming no great inequality of train- 
ing or competency in favor of the supervisor, as is so 
often true. 
The Characteristics of the Pupil.—Finally the criteria 
derivative of the characteristics of the learner as a member of 
society are ultimately for use by the teacher. The advantage 
is his, as against the administrator, of more intimate acquaint- 
ance with the tendencies of his individual pupils, their home, 
farm and community experience, the actual results of previous 
schooling. It is he who must judge of the fitness of this or 
that content aim, otherwise derived, to their native capacity, 
their acquired abilities, mental, moral, physical. The final 
content of any course can never be determined until the 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
    158 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
teacher is face to face with his class, day after day checking 
and rechecking his judgments as his knowledge of them grows. 
Capacity.—We have assumed a prevocational scheme that 
shall be indicative of capacity. Nevertheless, any vocational 
training must inevitably prove further selective of capacity 
as it becomes more and more exigent in its demands upon the 
learner. Certain pupils will always prove incapable of profit- 
ing by some of the experiences designed for them in a course 
selected in accordance with the previously given criteria. If 
such failure occur below the line of minimal requirements for 
the vocation the pupil must be rejected, and started in some 
other line of work. If it occur as above the minimum but 
below the norm of vocational requirements he may be retained 
in the vocational work, but modification of content must be 
made to meet his requirements. Suppose, for example, that 
the norm of vocation in dairy major production in a given 
region calls for a certain competency in selecting cattle of the 
Holstein type. Buta boy in the vocational course proves after 
repeated trial that he is incapable of the discrimination neces- 
sary to selection of profitable cows.t It is possible, that if he 
proves fairly proficient in meeting the other requirements of 
the course, he may go on to success in the vocation by relying 
upon the judgment of others in the purchase and mating of 
his cattle. The teacher will then substitute teaching for that 
attitude and the means of finding and using the expert, as 
against teaching of judging, pedigree study, the significance 
of yearly records, etc., in the case of the norm of the class. 
That is he will modify predetermined content to meet the 
needs of an individual, a group in the class, or the entire class, 
according to the factor of capacity to learn certain spe- 
cific details. 
Not a fictitious case.  
-P-A-G-E-159
  
PREVIOUS SCHOOLING 159 
Vocational Experience.—The requirements of vocation 
may indicate that the learner shall have training in bottling 
milk, making out bills for the month, harnessing a pair of 
horses, teaching a calf to drink, etc. But it is quite probable 
that a whole group of boys may come into the course who, 
as a by-product of farm experience, know how to do some or 
all of these things and do them well. Obviously those should 
not form a part of the content of the course for such boys, as 
they would for boys brought up in a village. If the farm 
boys have learned methods not up to the standard of vocational 
requirements, again the content will differ from that for boys 
who have learned no methods at all. Teaching for vocational 
abilities acquired by informal experience need form no part 
of the vocational training course. 
There is much more to consider than the differences in 
course for the same vocation which arise out of differences 
in boys from the farm and boys from the town. Suppose a 
course set up for education in the business of market garden- 
ing. If the pupils who seek to become market gardeners are 
from the city they must be taught all the knowledges and 
skills necessary to the pursuit of the occupation, as far as 
opportunity for teaching and capacity allow. If they come 
from dairy farms they will be possessed of some skills and 
some knowledge usable in market gardening, i.e., plowing, 
harnessing, effect of frost, drought, etc. But if they come 
from market garden farms in the region wherein the school 
is located the specific useful abilities already developed by their 
home farm experience are almost certain to be much more 
numerous than in the case of the group from dairy farms. 
Accordingly there will be much less to be taught in the 
vocational course for the latter group. 
Previous Schooling.—The previous school experience of 
a pupil in the vocational course is of significance also in the
-P-A-G-E-160
    160 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
determination of content. We assume that the boy can read, 
write, spell, add and subtract, multiply and divide, at least. In 
the search for usable information, the writing of letters, the 
keeping of accounts, all are essential in most of the entrepre- 
neurial vocations of agriculture. If these things are not fairly 
mastered, then, so far as they contribute directly to vocational 
success, they become properly a part of the content of the 
vocational course. The alternative above suggested is, of 
course, sometimes open. We can teach the boy to rely on 
others to write his letters and his advertisements, to make out 
his bills, even to read to him the necessary information. But 
that is, in the usual case, probably so to handicap him that he 
can never reach the vocational success necessary to the support 
of those accessory agents, even in the form of a competent 
wife. There are factory managers, successful farmers, who 
can neither read nor write, but they are exceptions whom some 
dominant abilities have driven forward despite the handicaps. 
There are thousands who cannot spell correctly or punctuate 
or be relied upon for correct addition or subtraction. It is 
normally more important to interpret accounts than to make 
them, to convey a meaning than to convey it in exact or con- 
ventionalized form. But that there is a correlation between 
ability to do and ability to interpret is hardly to be disputed. 
Those things are too frequently required in vocation to be suc- 
cessfully delegated at all times even in the imaginary case of 
the farmer who employs a stenographer, bookkeeper and con- 
fidential secretary. Certainly the norm of entrepreneurial 
vocations in agriculture is far from any such. Among the 
minor and trade vocations of agriculture, the instrumentality 
of the three Rs is less a factor in vocational success. Conceiv- 
ably the “successful” peach budder or packer may be 
illiterate, even if he must be able to count. But for most
-P-A-G-E-161
  
PREVIOUS SCHOOLING 161 
vocations in agriculture an elementary school preparation is 
an asset. 
Even with high school boys and unmixed classes, however, 
the teacher of agriculture finds it necessary, very often to 
modify the content of his course because of the results of their 
previous school experience. He comes in, for instance, with 
the idea that a knowledge of the process of germination func- 
tions as vocational technology in the preparation of the seed- 
bed by gardener or crop grower, that it functions in the 
selection and care of seeds, as, indeed, it may. But his boys 
have had work in nature study, general science or botany, with 
the result that the factors of germination in seeds, the changes 
that occur in beans, peas, corn, oats, etc., are familiar. He 
wastes their time and loses their interest if he sets them to 
“covering ” the same ground. Or, he comes in with a course 
formulated on the basis that ability to balance rations is an 
important asset to the dairy farmer, as it probably is. He 
“sets problems” for the boys in figuring percentage of 
nutrients, digestible content, nutritive ratio, unit costs, etc., 
only to find at the start that the decimal point, apart from 
dollars and cents, and the idea of ratio are meaningless to 
them. Immediately, that this important technology may 
become usable, he devotes himself to instruction in percent- 
age and ratio, so far as those bear on the balancing of rations. 
In both cases the content is modified because of the factor of 
previous schooling. Any experienced teacher of agriculture 
can recall instances of the sort in his teaching. 
Ona recent visit to a high school department of agriculture 
the following case in point was observed: Two classes, one 
of juniors who had reviewed mathematics during the year, and 
one of freshmen, were assigned the same problem. They were 
to map an irregular plot of ground already measured and 
staked out by them in a preceding field lesson. They were 
11 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
equipped, appropriately enough, with 8’ x 11’’ paper, a foot 
ruler laid off in sixteenths of an inch, and pencils. The teacher 
directed that a half inch border be laid off around the paper, 
but that within the border they were to draw the largest pos- 
sible map, choosing their own scale. Both groups agreed upon 
a scale of twenty-two feet to the inch, which met the require- 
ments for the largest size map according to the dimensions 
of plot and drawing space. Naturally on such a scale, with 
rulers laid off in sixteenths of an inch the fractions to be used 
turned out difficult. The group of juniors worked ahead 
steadily, with few mistakes or appeals for help, and completed 
the map within the period assigned. But within ten minutes 
the entire group of freshmen was “ swamped” by the diffi- 
culty of handling the complicated fractions. As a result over 
sixty minutes had to be given to the teaching of the use of 
those fractions, and not a boy completed his map. Owing to 
a difference in the school-acquired mathematical skills of the 
two groups the teaching content for the “same problem” 
had to be widely different. It is probable, of course, that the 
difference would have been much less had the teacher guided 
the boys to the use of the more convenient scale of twenty- 
four feet to the inch, but the situation revealed is represent- 
ative of many met by experienced and skillful teachers. 
By-effects.—Finally, the by-effects of any activity, chosen 
for purposes of vocational training, upon the learner, cannot 
be left out of consideration. By-effects beneficial to him 
physically or morally, by-effects harmful to him physically 
or morally, should swing the balance in favor of one or the 
other of two possible activities equally valuable from the 
standpoint of objective in vocational skill or knowledge. 
Fortunately we have seldom to confront serious difficulties 
of the sort in agricultural teaching, but they may arise. In 
general to use an outdoor activity rather than an indoor, ex-
-P-A-G-E-163
MORAL RISK 163 
cept where the indoor is manifestly the superior, is a safe 
criterion, but weather conditions may cause a reversal of the 
normal choice. An activity involving codperative responsi- 
bility is, caeteris paribus, preferable on moral grounds to 
one solitary. 
Physical Risk.—But there are doubtful cases. Shall we 
set the boy to breaking sod with a green team, because that is 
a situation which he is likely to meet in his vocation? The 
risk of injury to a slight and rapidly growing boy either 
through overexertion in handling the heavy No. 40 and the 
fractious team, or by accident, is so great here that no profit 
to be gained by the exercise can compensate for it. On the 
other hand a rugged and stolid boy might profit much. Shall 
we give a three year old Jersey bull in charge of a fourteen 
year old boy? Perhaps. But we must consider carefully first. 
Shall we keep the boy on his knees in the hot sun ten hours a 
day because in his vocation he must work so? Probably not. 
Shall we send him up to shingle the cupola of the barn because 
he may have to do a like job some day? 
Moral Risk.—Again, if a market gardener or cranberry 
grower or bean grower or hop grower, he will undoubtedly 
have to work among gangs of mixed men, women and chil- 
dren, among whom profanity, lewd speech, and lewd action, 
are part of every-day conduct. Is it mere sickly sentimentality 
that prompts us to hesitate in sending him into such a situation 
at the adolescent age? 
It is undoubtedly of vocational value to the herdsman, the 
dairy farmer, to be able to handle the male and female at time 
of service in such fashion that injury may come to neither nor 
to the attendant. But should we make such handling an ex- 
ercise in the vocational course? School men have raised the 
question. Is it a matter utterly apart from morality in its 
meaning? Yet undeniably to the boy brought up in cloistered 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  
  164 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
surroundings or taught what he knows of sex by the conver- 
sations of hired men and the whispers of the school yard, it is 
suggestive of the abnormal or indecent. No better approach 
to the matter of fact and natural teaching of sex meanings 
exists than agricultural teaching, through the mating of pas- 
sionless plants, the fowl, the mammals of the farm economy. 
But, except such approach have been made, or a normal, 
healthy and dispassionate attitude established, it is question- 
able that such an exercise is of sufficient value to justify its 
use. Certainly under such conditions it should not be a class 
exercise. For the teacher or the boy’s father to go along when 
he takes his sow to boar or his cow to bull, if that be a part 
of the teaching enterprise, is to help in the establishment of a 
normal attitude. The writer has known of many such cases, 
and in none has observed other than beneficial by-effects. 
The most completely unaffected, unembarrassed, and 
natural discussion of sex topics that the writer has ever heard 
in the school room was in a class in dairy husbandry, two of 
whose members had lost calves by epidemic, contagious abor- 
tion, and all of whom were interested in preventing such dis- 
aster in their own cases. No zodlogy teacher with his oysters 
or botanist with his pollen brush whom the writer has watched 
at his teaching, has equalled the achievement of that teacher of 
agriculture in the rational treatment of sex. And that in a 
school, where at the time of his coming, the atmosphere was 
far from “ clean.” 
Interest.—Criteria for the selection of content according 
to the “calling” aspect of vocation are difficult to define. 
That selection in terms of the interest of the pupil, rather than 
in terms of values instrumental to productive efficiency must 
be allowed and even encouraged up to a point at which they 
interfere with the acquirement of proficiency, if such a point 
exist, seems to the writer certain. One man loves his home
-P-A-G-E-165
  HOBBIES 165 
because he finds there warmth, food and family love. Another 
to the full appreciation of his home must have it set in a 
friendly neighborhood. Another makes the additional require- 
mentthat it beset inbeautiful surroundings ; his full sense of the 
true home comes only when with its comfort and friendliness 
he can associate a beautiful view, access to forest, mountain, 
lake or sea. So certain men find a true calling in farming be- 
cause it engages all their energies in earning ; others because it 
satisfies economic needs and brings them into friendly rela- 
tions with living creatures; others because it is good work 
under the open sky ; others because it opens to them participa- 
tion in the progress of civilization; others because it reveals 
biological, chemical, geologic, mechanic principles. To en- 
courage a boy in his love for cattle, to teach him that the cow 
is a mother and a foster mother; to teach him that the manure 
heap is a seat of life and wondrous change ; that the ridge upon 
which he plants his crop is the apron of a glacial torrent dis- 
charging from a continent of ice; to teach him that the soil 
beneath him marches and is not dead, all these may add scarce 
one jot to his proficiency, one dollar to his income. Following 
with him the paths of interest found in the field of practicality, 
helping to develop insights social, scientific, esthetic, of the 
service he performs may seem “ sentimental slop” to cer- 
tain “ practical” minds. But such teaching may make the 
occupation he follows, the “pursuit of profitable employ- 
ment,” in the full sense, vocation. 
Needless to say such content can never be set down in a 
class outline. It is individual, chosen according to the inter- 
ests discovered by the boy. The teacher who cannot go, when 
need occasions, farther into the meaning of the job than accom- 
plishment of the job itself requires, cannot teach vocation. 
Hobbies.—But a caution must be inserted here. Every 
good teacher has his hobby, his enthusiasm. The teacher
-P-A-G-E-166
166 CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF CONTENT 
who makes farm management into social economy, soils 
management into geology, feeding into physiology of nutri- 
tion because his boys seem interested, errs from vocational 
teaching as does he who will not tolerate the cow as 
other than a milking machine, the pig as a corn converter, hay 
as a fuel, and the soil as a support for crops. Not all of the 
teaching of the prospective farmer is done by one teacher. 
There are other teachers and other sources of understanding. 
But the teacher of agriculture can lead the interested boy 
sometimes to botany, to physics, zodlogy, geology, economics, 
civics, sociology, history, for the sake of the larger meaning 
which they may give to what otherwise may be to him a “ job” 
but little better than any other that might have fallen to his 
lot. Without the larger meanings the boy could learn to pro- 
duce well enough, but he would never love his work in the 
fullest sense of finding in it a calling. 
In sum, then, the criteria of content selection, are these: 
A. Derivative of demands of specific vocation: 
for adaptiveness: for adaptation: 
Type Certainty Frequency 
Survival 
Progress 
B. Derivative of the nature of the educative environment: 
Opportunity for effective teaching. 
Local Seasonal 
C. Derivative of the characteristics of the individual : 
Capacity Experience By-effects 
Interest

CHAPTER XI 
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN RESPECT 
TO CURRICULUM 
In the high school, except in the case of special and short 
course pupils, the course of study in agriculture is ordinarily 
part of a curriculum for those who are to pursue vocations in 
agriculture. Though the course itself usually reveals an 
organization in some degree appropriate to a more or less 
clearly conceived aim, it is often difficult to discover a like 
relation in the curriculum as a whole. ; 
“Man” and “ Balance.”—Two conceptions working to- 
gether to influence the curriculum appear to be dominant. The 
first of them is that, apart from his activities in production, 
the life of the farmer is that of a “man” in society like any 
other, and consequently no differentiation in respect to studies: 
other than vocational is either necessary or desirable. The 
second, which has been directly fostered by the federal 
authorities and in many cases by the state authorities also, is 
the so-called principle of “ balance.” It is not far from typical 
of the vocational curriculum for agricultural pupils in the 
high school that it is made up of a program of studies “ bal- 
anced ” in respect to the allotment of time to vocational and 
“non-vocational.” Every study recognized as_ bearing 
directly upon the problems of the prospective vocation is 
offset or compensated in the pursuit for an equal or greater 
length of time of one held by authority to be unrelated to vo- 
cation. Thus the pupil may not be “ narrowed ” by too much 
understanding of the central activities of his prospective life. 
The antidotes to the noxious influence of vocational studies 
167
-P-A-G-E-168
  168 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
_ may or may not be of significance in the life of the farmer and 
countryman. Considerable variation exists in that particular. 
But at any rate they must be studies of quite a different sort, 
and certainly not “ practical” in their nature. They may be 
“constants ” in the valid sense proposed by Doctor Inglis, but 
they are far more likely to be “constants” in terms of the 
propaedeutic or college preparatory tradition. Thus, though 
foreign language is omitted in most cases, and the “ constant ” 
English almost invariably retained, the mathematics sequence 
of formal algebra and plane geometry is quite as general as 
the science sequence, and decidedly more so than any sequence 
of social studies. The vocational curriculum for prospective 
farmers in the country high school differs from the college 
preparatory curriculum of the city high school chiefly by the 
substitution of studies in agricultural technology for studies 
in foreign language. 
The Farmer as Man.—Now in respect to the categories 
of individual and social need, the farmer can certainly be placed 
along with other members of our democracy. He is a citizen, 
a neighbor, a parent and husband, as normally are the truck 
driver, the floor walker, the architect, and the lawyer. He has 
a body, like those others, which for the sake of personal effi- 
ciency and happiness must be cared for well and intelligently. 
He is decidedly to be ranked among the consumers, and a large 
part of his life’s activities are directed to the utilization of 
commodities and service produced by others. He has a certain 
amount of leisure like his urban brothers, which it is of im- 
portance to him and to society be well used. He has need of 
rest and of recreation, of play, entertainment, esthetic enjoy- 
ment, intellectual enjoyment, and growth. 
“Constants.”—But that is very far from saying that he 
shall pursue the identical studies that are properly to be pur- 
sued by the actor, or club-man, or engineer, or bank clerk.
-P-A-G-E-169
  CONSTANTS 169 
For constants are not to be reckoned in terms of standardized 
studies, but in terms of universal content values. In every 
one of the high school subjects there may be items of learning 
experience that should be the lot of every boy or girl who 
attends the high school, but it is equally true that there is not 
one “ subject ” which is universally valuable in all its content, 
or even in any very large part of it. The incidence of social 
demands and of personal needs of the farmer in every one of 
the accepted “ constant” categories differs from that of the 
city man, if also from that of the farmer in another section 
and climate and social status, in varying but considerable 
degree. Even were it true that the studies chosen to “ bal- 
ance ” the curriculum of the high school student of agriculture 
were of the true constant group, which is rarely the case, 
differentiation in content and time allotment to those studies 
is necessary if anything like equality of opportunity is to 
be provided. 
The principle of “balance” is too often based upon the 
assumption that a study of vocation is “ narrowing.” Further 
it neglects the fact that the high school student is not at the 
beginning of his formal education but very near the end of it. 
For eight years he has pursued a curriculum of studies in an 
institution assigned the social duty of preparation in the funda- 
mentals of communication and integration among the cit- 
izenry, and which in ninety-nine cases in a hundred has given 
no heed whatever to choice or preparation for the activities 
which will most contribute to his service as a member of 
society and most certainly give character to the life that he 
lives. In application of a principle of “ balance,” then, the 
advocates of that principle should insist that the pupil of the 
high school spend from four to eight years in the exclusive 
study of his vocation. Fortunately we are not confronted 
with such an absurdity, though the same kind of logic is 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  170 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
responsible for the fact that boys who might be acquiring 
abilities useful to themselves and to the society in which they 
must live, devote a large share of their high school time to the 
acquirement of knowledge and skill that serve no present social 
purpose and that will inevitably be lost within a few months or 
years after they go out into life from the artificial environ- 
ment of the school. How far the loss is merely negative is 
not known. 
Curricula are not by scientific methods founded upon 
standards of compensation and balance, but rather upon ex- 
amination of the type, frequency, and certainty of situations 
likely to arise in the life of the individual for whom the cur- 
riculum is a means to education. Because certain situations 
are representative in the lives of the great majority, or fre- 
quent in their lives, or certain to be met by them, we find a 
common ground of experience in those particulars for all 
pupils. That ground so far as it exists for pupils of the 
schooling and experience of high school matriculants is rep- 
resented by the so-called “constants” of the high school 
course. Because individuals differ in innate capacities and in 
acquired abilities, and because the environments into which 
prospectively they will go differ greatly, there is need to pro- 
vide diversity of experience for different groups of pupils. 
Thus scientifically or rationally derived curricula are made up 
of groupings of studies, some constant, some variable. The 
amount of time that shall be devoted to the acquirement of 
particular abilities implied in either constant or variable is 
not a matter of the relative prevalence of need in the life of 
the several groups, or of “balance” between constant and 
variable, but of the normal period necessary to acquirement 
of the several degrees of proficiency needful for successful 
functioning in the life of the student. Because a larger 
amount of time and effort is spent by the normal individual
-P-A-G-E-171
    SNEDDEN’S CONSUMER 171 
in the pursuit of his vocation than in the care of his body, 
the enjoyment of the esthetic, the conduct of civic duties, etc., 
is no reason at all that the major share of his learning time 
shall be devoted to the acquirement of vocational proficiencies 
and insights. If a thing must be learned because it is signifi- 
cant in the life of the individual, then time must be taken to 
learn it, regardless of whether or no it is easy or difficult of 
acquirement. One period a week for health instruction and 
five periods for English literary appreciation is not at all an 
index to the relative life values of the two forms of instruc- 
tion, but so far as it is not merely a matter of tradition, of the 
difference in learning time. 
Rural and Suburban Environments.—It has already 
been stated that choice of a vocation in agriculture in the vast 
majority of cases indicates entrance into a social and physical 
environment differing in many respects from that of the urban 
worker. Not only is that environment different with respect 
to demands for vocational abilities, but in respect to abilities 
in all the other categories cited. The differences and the 
common elements between urban and rural are of different 
proportions in the civic, the social, the recreational, the 
esthetic, the physical, as well as in the vocational aspects of 
life needs. Let us examine briefly a few of the commoner 
categories of needs and some of the differences to be found 
under them. 
Snedden’s “ Consumer.”—First consider the category of 
“consumers’”” needs so strongly emphasized by Doctor 
Snedden. Certainly the aspect is well worth considering, even 
if it be not entirely a satisfactory means of classification. The 
difficulty that arises in a distinction between consuming and 
producing activities in the case of the prevalent entrepreneurial 
occupations of farming is that much of the farmer’s consump- 
tion is directly related to his activities of production. The
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
capital that he employs in buildings, machinery, livestock, 
seeds, fertilizers, etc., is consumed in the process of produc- 
tion. He must be a buyer because he is a seller, and not 
merely because he is a man who must be fed, sheltered, and 
clothed. But if such be activities of utilization so also are they 
activities vocational, and in discussion have been considered 
as such. Just where the activities of the farmer cease to be 
those of the producer and become those of the “ utilizer ” is 
very difficult to determine. The standard categories, physical, 
vocational, civic-parental, civic-social, recreational and leisure, 
appear to the writer to be fully as enlightening and more 
readily usable, even though the influence of Spencer be some- 
what on the wane. 
Health Needs.—The physical needs of the farmer for 
regular bodily exercise outdoors are on the average pretty well 
taken care of in the pursuit of his vocation. Not that he needs 
exercise and fresh air less, but that provision for them through 
special physical education and guidance, is much less neces- 
sary than for the urban worker. Undoubtedly some system- 
atic training in the use of muscles not ordinarily employed in 
farm work, yet profitably to be kept in tone, may be desirable. 
But with the increasing use of machinery the overload of the 
farmer’s back and arms to which his traditional defects of 
stature have been attributed, though those are probably much 
less away from the norm than is popularly supposed, grow 
less. Yet the range of physical activity is such on most farms 
that the farmer is not likely to suffer from flabby and weak 
muscles. On the other hand, because he is normally an inde- 
pendent householder and a dweller in relative isolation the 
farmer’s needs for practical knowledge of the laws of sanita- 
tion in the matter of home cleanliness, ventilation, sewage 
and garbage disposal, water supply and the like is greater than 
that of the city dweller. If his house is clean, sanitary, well
-P-A-G-E-173
HOME NEEDS 173 
ventilated, free from odors, germs and flies, it is because his 
household has kept it so of its own will and not because of the 
orders of an inspector of health or buildings. If his water 
be pure and fresh and clean it is because of his provisions and 
not because of the efficiency of a department of water supply. 
If he or any member of his family meets with accident or 
“comes down” with illness it is more important that he be 
able to take prompt action than with the city dweller to whom 
the physician, the nurse, and the hospital are so immediately 
accessible. Enough has been said to indicate that the content 
of the physical education of the farmer will be appropriately 
somewhat different in character and emphasis from that of 
the city man. 
Home Needs.—The dairyman, poultryman, fruit grower, 
general farmer, or other worker in the field of agriculture is 
in his maturity like most other men a husband and father, 
yet as such, his needs differ somewhat from those of the city 
man. Typically he is householder and the head of a family 
more perfectly preserving the characteristics of the primary 
social unit than any other. The division of labor, and the 
economic and social interdependence among the members of 
the farm household, are normally more systematic, organized, 
and real than in the city, where the father, and often other 
members of the family are away for work, and again for rec- 
reation, than is the case in the farm family. The farm home is 
a place in which the family lives, and not one in which it 
assembles at sleeping time. The vocation and the home are not 
distinctly separate and remote interests as they are likely to 
be in the city, whether the father be employe, entrepreneur, or 
professional man. The home is more constantly and directly 
an agency for the development of the well-being of its mem- 
bers than is an environment in which specialized agencies 
divide among themselves the obligations of satisfying the 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
174 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
physical and other needs of individuals. There are, of course, 
in cities thousands of homes that preserve the characteristics 
of the family unit in those and other respects, but they are 
increasingly less typical. We must look forward to changes 
in the farm home of somewhat urban character with the in- 
creasing accessibility of such homes to urban interests and 
agencies through improved means of transport and communi- 
cation. But it will probably remain true for a long time to 
come that the responsibility, as well as the opportunity, for 
making the most of home life will be greater with the man 
who enters into agriculture than with him who chooses 
urban employment. 
| To know those opportunities and those responsibilities, 
| and to be able to make use of them and to assume them suc- 
cessfully is part of the equipment of the successfully educated 
farmer. Not all the responsibility for the conduct of the 
| home can at all times be left to the wife. For example, if she 
| be sick, or called away, father and children must still be fed 
and cared for. There is no delicatessen or downstairs cafe- 
| teria to meet the situation, no day nursery to which to “ ship ” 
the children till mother “gets round” again. Directly the 
supplying of food, the preparation of it, the dressing and 
bathing of youngsters, the sweeping and bedmaking are pretty 
sure to fall upon the man of the house from time to time if 
he takes up the career of a worker of the soil. Further he 
must assume the job of the janitor in the city flat or tenement. 
His part in the household economy as helpmeet is much more 
diversified and active than that of paying the bills at the end of 
the month. To the extent that is necessary to appreciation of 
the part that his wife must play in the success of the home 
and to the extent that he must bear a part in the household 
economy, the prospective farmer must understand and be able 
to do the work of the home. Not all, or even very much of 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  PARENTAL NEEDS 175 
preparation for such duties need devolve upon the school 
direct if the boy be brought up on the farm as in a majority of 
cases he will be. But something may and should be done. 
As it is worth while to provide some agricultural instruc- 
tion of a directly usable type for girls who are prospectively to 
manage country homes, as in poultry care, and gardening, as 
well as in some of the larger aspects of country life and the 
significance of agriculture, so, and more definitely, because 
prognosis of occupation and residence is more certain, it is 
desirable that boys preparing for life on the farm be taught 
the minimal essentials of the household economy and a larger 
appreciation of the opportunities and needs of the home than 
ordinarily they can gain through informal experience. Plain 
and camp cookery, sewing and mending of a simple sort, bed- 
making and care of the room, first aid and hygienic measures, 
are already taught to-city boys as members of the Boy Scout 
organization, and those boys find in the teaching nothing of 
the effeminate. For boys to whom the need on the whole is 
greater and to whom the Scout Training is less likely to be 
available it seems appropriate that the high school should do 
something of the sort, either through directed club or organi- 
zation work or through formal instruction. Appreciation of 
the home and of the need for economical arrangement and 
equipment, which if understood by farmers would go far to 
enlarge the happiness and efficiency of the household, may 
appropriately be taught in connection with the study of the 
social and economic problems of country life—very nearly a 
constant for country boys and girls of the high school in a 
rationally built curriculum. Running water in the sink, at 
least, and minor household conveniences, may come to farm 
homes more frequently as a result. 
Parental Needs.—The care of children, of course, falls 
in less measure on the man in the farm home than on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
   
   176 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
  woman. Nevertheless, even on the physical side, he must bear 
a share in the burden and in the opportunity. At least he 
should possess knowledge of reasonable and usable standards 
of physical welfare in the home care of children. But fully 
as significant is a knowledge of the conditions and control of 
habit formation. The informal agency of the home, where it 
exists in the life of a growing child, is still the most influential 
of all educative agencies in determining habits of speech and 
conduct, moral attitudes and behavior, and most of those traits 
of the individual which function frequently in daily life. It 
is probable that a home life on the farm intelligently directed 
to the formation of right habits and wholesome attitudes will 
count for more in the future happiness and success of its boys 
and girls than all formal schooling whatsoever. Here is one 
of the most nearly constant of all the groups of needs of the 
average American, that rises to its highest certainty in the 
case of the prospective farm dweller. Yet such education as 
the average boy or girl receives in the matter is entirely inci- 
dental to his own upbringing by uninstructed if normally in- 
telligent parents. It is purely hit or miss, and there is eloquent 
testimony in the records of our social development that the 
miss is as frequent as the hit. It is yet to be appreciated by 
most people that because we have public schools responsible 
for the formal education of our children, we have no ground 
for shifting all responsibility in the matter of the development 
of mental and physical traits. Knowledge of the aims and pub- 
lic functions of the schools in a democracy is equally needed, 
and particularly so in the rural districts wherein the respon- 
sibility for the conduct of schools falls more directly upon the 
layman than in the city. It may be that the two phases of 
knowledge of education can be most successfully taught in 
course of the study of community and larger social problems. 
But whatever the “ subject ” chosen may be, those two should
-P-A-G-E-177
  NEIGHBORLY NEEDS 177 
not be omitted from the content of the curriculum, Nothing 
is as yet done in the elementary school, which reaches the 
~ largest number, and very little in the high school, except in a 
few cases wherein unusually well organized courses in home 
making are offered to girls. Something should be done for 
the prospective father. 
Neighborly Needs.—The farm dweller is a neighbor in a 
sense in which the city dweller ordinarily is not. If physically 
he is apart from the crowd, yet the contacts that he does have 
are more unavoidably intimate than those of the city man. The 
city man can pick and choose to a considerable degree his 
associates inintimacy. But the countryman’s immediate social 
surroundings are less varied and more stable. He must deal 
with his neighbors as he finds them. He cannot and should 
not ignore them except he wishes to isolate himself and his 
family in a kind of hermitry. The affairs of his neighbors 
become his concern in a direct sense and his affairs become 
theirs willy nilly. It is well known that the pressure of public 
opinion bears more immediately upon the individual in the 
country than in the city. Conformity to the mores is 
rather rigorously enforced without a great degree of police 
activity. Apart from the factor of selection that is one of 
the reasons for the greater homogeneity and the greater con- 
servatism, or at least stability of the group mind in the 
country. It is not to be accounted for merely on the ground 
of less interrupted reflection. Even national policies are in- 
terpreted by the farmer not in terms of abstraction, but in 
terms of the experience of the family and the neighborhood. 
That habit of gossip which is more or less definitely character- 
istic of the rural community is not altogether unwholesome. It 
reflects again interest in the human which is native to all of us, 
but in terms of a personal intimacy and a restricted group. 
To understand, sympathize with, and codperate -with his 
12
-P-A-G-E-178
178 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
neighbors in an immediate personal fashion, are certain obli- 
gations of the man who is to make the most of life as a 
farmer. Just what the school may do in respect to easing the © 
intercourse of neighborhoods and integrating the neighbor- 
hood group is not easy to-determine. Increasing the depth of 
understanding of social worth, of individual place, merit, and 
motive may accomplish something. But the integrating power 
of common and intimate understanding has been overesti- 
mated. There are country neighborhoods which work to- 
gether harmoniously and as units, in which local pride is high 
and even restrictive in larger social movements, because 
neighbors know each other so well. There are others in which 
exactly opposite status prevails. The neighborhood is not a 
unit, there is no local pride, the neighbors mistrust one another 
and refuse to codperate, for the very reason that they do 
know each.other so well. Perhaps the neighborly interest and 
intimacy can be left to take care of itself, and the best that 
the school can do is to foster a more impersonal neighborhood 
spirit, based on larger grounds of social needs, so that a man 
may be led to tolerate the infirmities of his neighbor and to 
work with him rather from a sense of obligation to the larger 
groups of society than out of immediate love for him and 
desire for his personal welfare. It cannot be stated, even in 
general terms, what the function of the school with respect to 
the neighborhood group is. It is probable that habits of 
codperation can be set up among boys and girls who are in 
the present neighbors and likely in the future to come into 
intimate contact. Such habits functioning in connection 
with the larger ideals of social service may be in some measure 
taught by the high school, as at present they are in a measure 
taught by the junior extension service, but more consistently 
and thoroughly. In any case the part that neighborhood 
duties and obligations play in the life of the farmer is so large
-P-A-G-E-179
  
CIVIC NEEDS 179 
that consideration of them in his formal education should not 
be neglected. 
Civic Needs.—Extending beyond the neighborhood are 
certain duties and obligations of the farmer. The first are 
the civic duties of the voter and taxpayer. Through them he 
participates in the direction and control not of neighborhood 
affairs only, but of those of the town and the county, the state 
and the nation. In so far as the public activities of the rural 
community differ in nature and emphasis from those of the 
urban community, to that extent must preparation for those 
duties be differentiated for the prospective farmer. Inasmuch 
as the political unit of which he is a member counts, on the 
average, for more than he in the affairs of the larger units, his 
first obligation is to do his utmost to see that it is well admin- 
istered. From a social as well as from a pedagogical angle 
the place of beginning of the study of political duties and 
service is at home. From that centre the study of civics may 
be extended even to the point of consideration of the larger 
questions of international relations, the immediate bearings 
of which upon the well-being of the individual farm home in 
America have been very strikingly illustrated in the past year. 
In the formulation of content in rural community civics a 
good deal of progress has recently been made, as also in the 
method of extended participation in community activities on 
the part of pupils. The resources open to high schools in that 
direction are far larger than is evident from the actual place 
that such studies now occupy in curricula for rural pupils. A 
great gain will be made if schools come only to the use of that 
which is now available. Further and better adjustments to 
particular community and regional needs can be best made in 
the light of experience in the actual teaching of civics. 
It may appear that such civics is so nearly a fundamental 
that it properly belongs to the elementary school.. Yet while 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
    180 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
the deficiency remains in the elementary rural schools the high 
school can do a part to remedy it. And it is further to be 
remembered that the high school group is that from which 
leadership in community affairs is most likely to be recruited, 
so that a more complete development of knowledge and habits 
in the conduct of civic obligations is likely to prove useful in 
the case of the high school student than is necessary or possible 
in the elementary school. The high school can never do more 
than train a small proportion of those who go into entrepre- 
neurial and other occupations of agriculture, but it is likely 
to train a considerable proportion of those who will assume 
leadership in those vocations and in the community life 
surrounding them. 
Integrative Needs——A group unity of sympathy and 
understanding is desirable among farmers and countrymen 
in the several states and in the nation. The great successes of 
the farmers in remedying economic and social inequalities 
have come through united group action on a large scale and 
will increasingly so come. There is danger, of course, in the 
movement. The spirit in which it is carried on is all im- 
portant for the welfare of mankind. If the slogan “the 
farmer against the world” shall prevail, disaster is sure to 
come. But there is little indication of such a spirit as yet. 
The agricultural group is large, intelligent, and decidedly indi- 
vidualistic in its membership. It can hardly be led to the use of 
the enormous power which united action by it carries to ends 
purely selfish, for the reason that too many of its members, 
regardless of any spirit of altruism, are aware of the fact that 
the accomplishment of such ends would in the long run ruin 
the welfare of the group. Farmers as a group cannot reach 
the highest achievement of material and spiritual success 
except the industrial and commercial and professional groups 
of the nation also prosper. Yet those groups have not used
-P-A-G-E-181
  INTEGRATIVE NEEDS 181 
their organized power at all times to universal advantage, and 
the farmer is driven to codperative organization in economic 
and even political fields. 
Integration of the diversified groups of modern society is 
necessary if democracy is to survive. The integrating agency 
in democracy must be education and not force. But the nature 
and the extent of the educative content which will give that 
common ground of experience, that shall bind us together as 
Americans, or as members of the world group, is uncertain. 
The influence of history and literature, as national heritage, 
appears to have been highly effective in the small and homo- 
geneous nation of Denmark, but that does not answer the 
question for us in a large and heterogeneous population. The 
elements of Christianity seem to be of the sort to give the 
fundamental integrative bonds, yet experience shows that 
groups of Christians are likely to split on the bases of dif- 
ferences rather than to unite on the basis of com- 
mon acceptance. 
Much has been made of the importance of the facts of 
group interdependence as a basis for integration, but there 
is little evidence that knowledge of the facts has been effective 
in special instances where they have been carefully dissem- 
inated. Has knowledge that women and children must die, 
that the wheels of industry must stop, if the coal supply be 
shut off resulted in any abstinence from limitation of produc- 
tion on the part of organized operators and miners in their 
opposing groups? Is any increasing spirit of altruism to be 
noted among producers of sugar and oil with the realization 
of approximate monopoly? It is not at all certain that one 
group will not take its neighbors by the throat merely because 
it has learned that it has the power to choke them. There is a 
good deal of evidence that increased knowledge of economic 
interdependence among groups of intelligent men, such as are
-P-A-G-E-182
  182 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
represented in employers’ associations, as well as among the 
groups of less intelligent foreign born, who have been so con- 
spicuous in our most injurious strike movements has had 
opposite effect. It is doubtful that mere spread of knowledge 
of the facts of modern social interdependence is an effective 
integrating influence. 
Ethical Needs.—Yet it is hard to see how ethical ideals 
of intergroup behavior are to function in the absence of such 
knowledge. Knowledge that backs must go bare and stomachs 
empty, if we exercise our power to our own advantage, may 
result in turning on the screws, since the neighbor will yield 
up almost anything to keep his back covered and his stomach 
lined. Even knowledge that we must lose those utilities which 
he produces in exchange may not be effective if we have faith 
that we can stick it out longer than he and make the best of 
the bargain. But there may be less likelihood of pressure if 
we appreciate that the back which is bared is a warm human 
back very much like ours and subject to the same 
chilly discomfort that we have undergone when scantily 
clothed. Few men will see with indifference, discomfort 
and suffering in their own families or in their neigh- 
bor’s on the next quarter. Much less will they knowingly 
contribute to such discomfort and suffering. It comes “ too 
close home” as they put it. To bring about in the prospective 
farmer that “consciousness of kind,” which according to 
Professor Giddings is the bonding element of social groups, is 
in part to solve the problem of future integration between the 
agricultural and the non-agricultural groups, to make an 
American and a world citizen of him. But how to do it still 
remains a question, so long as the neighbor is not neighbor in 
any physical sense. 
To bring home the fact that the city man, the middleman, 
even, and the foreigner are after all as much like “me” as
-P-A-G-E-183
  ETHICAL NEEDS 183 
unlike “ me” is very difficult. In the accomplishment of the 
end it appears that genuine “ humanities ” should play a part. 
Such are not those so-called “‘ humanities ” of the Ciceronians, 
the Greek and Latin languages, which at one time served as 
instruments to discovery of the thoughts, ideals, and achieve- 
ments of great peoples, but which are no longer necessary even 
to access to the best of the contributions of those peoples, and 
have become mere formalized systems of incomplete acquire- 
ment under the conditions of secondary public education. But 
they are studies undertaken in the spirit that originally gave to 
the Greek and Latin cultures, rather than to the languages, 
the designation “ humanities ;” studies such as are illustrated 
among the ancients in the “ Lives” of Plutarch, which made 
the characters of history real and human and like to us. Well 
told biography, the best of literature, survives because of the 
human and universal content that it carries, the contact that it 
gives with the realities of person. But we need integration not 
so much with the people of Greece and Rome and Florence 
and early England or New England as with the living groups 
now dwelling apart from us, yet so closely bound with us in 
social and economic activity; not so much with the lives of 
leaders as with the lives of the common people who so much 
resemble us in their doings, thoughts and aspirations. 
Poetry, prose, biography, developmental history of people and 
not of war, such are all useful influences toward integration, 
apart from other ends and intrinsic values. The farmer needs 
to know and appreciate how the rest of his kind lives, not on 
the farm only, but in all the industries and forms of life that 
go to make up our modern society. To that knowledge and 
appreciation certainly literature and history contribute, but 
their contribution is in the enlargement of meaning that they 
give to the life of to-day. We cannot furnish the travel that 
gives the actual and vital contacts with the lives of others that
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
do so much to broaden the tolerance and enlarge the sympa- 
thies of the few, but the reading of current literature, of “ cur- 
rent events,” the use of pictures with which we are so richly 
provided, will help. 
Such vicarious experiences must have a basis of interpre- 
tation in the life of the pupil if the most is to be made of them. 
Here is in part the significance of the methods of local study of 
lives of the people in neighborhood, town, and adjoining 
communities. They furnish a basis of comparison, an “ apper- 
ceptive basis ” to the interpretation of the “ current events ” 
story or moving picture, the news of the world and the 
travelogue picture. The enlargement of human contacts in 
so far as it is possible to achieve it is a function of the high 
school in the education of the prospective farmer. 
Recreational Needs.—In the matter of recreation the 
farmer has no less need and, perhaps, no greater need than the 
rest of men, but his needs differ. It has been suggested that 
the best vacation for the farmer is a trip to the city. Back of 
the suggestion is a genuine and sound philosophy. Not in the 
pursuit of the same kinds of activity in the same sort of en- 
vironment do we find true recreation, but in change of activity 
and change of environment. That farmers and farm boys 
and girls crowd into towns on Saturday nights and holidays is 
not a sign of dislike of the country any more than is the 
crowding of the beaches, lake and mountain resorts a sign of 
dislike of the city on the part of city people. It is a seeking 
of recreation in a different environment that perhaps most 
completely contrasts with the familiar and loved. Golf links, 
tennis courts, flower gardens, will never furnish to country 
people recreation in the sense that they do for city people. Toa 
manwho works all day in the open and among the living things 
of nature, love them as he may, they cannot furnish the same 
changed stimulus that they do to the man shut away from
-P-A-G-E-185
  RECREATIONAL NEEDS 185 
them. The visiting of towns, attendance at moving picture — 
shows, theatres, and dances is not to be discouraged as a sign 
of the degeneracy of the rural spirit, but to be encouraged as 
legitimate and proper recreation for the people who pass their 
lives in the open country. The “ flivver ” and the “ state road ” 
are blessings rather than curses in the matter of rural recre- 
ation, and the most should be made of them. 
But, if the farmer can more and more avail himself of 
the resources of the town for purposes of amusement, enter- 
tainment, and sometimes esthetic and intellectual recreation, 
yet he must, by virtue of the life implied in his occupation, 
have greater resources in himself for the enjoyment of leisure 
than the city man. There is not and never can be in the 
country realization of the threat, foreseen by some in urban 
life, of the complete dependence of the individual upon the 
specialist for recreation. The farmer must “recreate” him- 
self in a very large measure instead of hiring another to 
“recreate” him. Part of his recreation may be an individual 
matter, part of it a matter of social codperation. 
Two main sources are open to him in the matter of finding 
recreative enjoyment alone. The first of them is good reading. 
Though the picture of the farmer sometimes painted, as one 
who comes in from the heat and labor of the day to sit down 
before the fire for the perusal of the thumbworn pages of 
“Old Will” is a matter of fiction, yet the fact remains that 
in the off season, particularly the winter in the northern 
states, the farmer does have a good deal of time and a margin 
of energy usable for reading. There is little virtue in the 
program laid out by some of “ spending his evenings in the 
study of agricultural papers and bulletins.” Certainly, for 
the sake of progress in his vocation and in the success of his 
life as a homekeeper and citizen of the open country, he must 
do some such reading, but that is largely a feature of his busi-
-P-A-G-E-186
  186 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
ness and not of his leisure. The so-called course in “ agri- 
cultural literature ” that is offered in a few schools is not only 
misnamed, but misplaced. If the boy is to be taught how to 
use the technical resources of agricultural publications for the 
conduct of the various activities of the farm, then he should 
be taught them in connection with the study of those activities 
and not in a segregated “subject.” They are read for an 
object for which they are frequently worth while, and not for 
the esthetic, human, or intellectual value, which may in rare 
cases reside in them. Nor do I sympathize heartily with the 
idea that the literature which the farmer should be taught to 
read is the literature of the open country. To him in the 
satisfaction of a need and the use of an opportunity somewhat 
greater and more certain than with the run of his urban fellows 
should be opened the resources of all that is best in literary 
achievement. To read, to understand and to enjoy many 
books and many kinds of books is to possess a resource of 
high value in country life. 
The second main resource of the individual in the pro- 
vision of his own recreation is in the use of the natural 
resources of the open country. He may engage in the solitary, 
but satisfying sports of the hunter and fisherman, or he may 
become a student and lover of nature. Even the hours of his 
labor may be made more satisfying in this last case. The 
farmer who is something of a “ naturalist ” can make much 
of life. 
The point may be made that the farmer cannot become lit- 
terateur and naturalist and remain a farmer. The man who 
leaves his team for hours to read in the shade of a tree or to 
watch a spider building her web is more nearly bookworm or 
entomologist than farmer, the man who puts in the first week 
of the trout season while the land remains unplowed for the oat 
crop is too much the fisherman to succeed as a farmer. Any 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  RECREATIONAL NEEDS 187 
man who discovers interests superior to those of vocation in 
the hours of vocation is to some extent misplaced in life. But 
that is not to argue that the successful farmer must refrain 
from the pursuit of other interests than those of the business. 
On the side of social participation other than that of spec- 
tator or listener at the demonstration of the specialist there are 
first the opportunities of the home. Music is one of those 
opportunities. The ability to sing or to play an instrument is 
of more significance to the farmer than to the average city 
man. The city man can hear and enjoy a great deal of good 
music if he has learned to appreciate it, regardless of ability 
to sing or play a single note. On the other hand, except the 
farmer in his family develop such abilities the source of recre- 
ation which music affords is pretty much restricted, even 
granting the merits of the phonograph. Of course the same 
abilities contribute largely to neighborhood recreation also, 
but as a family matter they are worth cultivating if the 
capacity for them exists. Then there are games and contests, 
indoor and outdoor, in which small numbers may engage 
and every member of the family participate. Much more 
has been made of community games in the propaganda of 
extension work than of home games. The family that on a 
long winter evening can find nothing better to do than yawn, 
groan, and complain, because it is “ too rough out” to get to 
the movies, or down to the school house or the church, is 
lacking resources of much value. Home codperation in recre- 
ative activity is quite as significant as neighborhood and com- 
munity codperation. 
Nothing more appeals to the interest of many rural com- 
munities than “getting up a drama.” Picnics, dinners, 
sociables, ball games, are all established and successful activi- 
ties of rural community life. Upon the subject of community 
codperation in recreation so much has been written that little 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  188 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
space need be used here. On the whole the grown folks appear 
to be better taken care of in the plans put forth than the 
younger people, except dances be included in the category. 
On the side of indoor sport in the winter season, when 
freedom for recreation is at its maximum, there is often a 
decided lack. 
Basket ball has grown in popularity wonderfully in the 
past decade. Yet many small communities make no provision 
for it among their boys. A recent case has been reported in 
which through the leadership of a teacher of agriculture the 
boys of the high school “ clubbed together ” and purchased the 
baskets and the ball. Then their difficulties began. The school 
had no floor or room large enough for play. But there was a 
church basement, a town hall, and a lodge room in the village. 
In not one case, however, would the authorities consent to the 
use of these rooms for sport. Finally a father of one of the 
boys living two miles from the school cleaned out the loft of 
the barn, with the help of the boys, spiked down the more 
uneven boards in the floor, ran a wire with sockets overhead, 
and lighted the loft from his own power plant. All winter 
long, twice and three times a week, the boys have ridden and 
tramped in to that court for the sake of the sport, and having 
a “team ” which would give the high school recognition. The 
case. is cited as evidence of the response which hard working 
boys of the farm will make to an opportunity for recreative 
sport in winter, of the pains and expense to which a public 
spirited citizen will go to overcome the lack of community 
spirit displayed by the very organizations which ostensibly 
stand for that spirit. It is hardly likely that the boys of that 
high school as members of church and lodge, and voters in 
school and village affairs, will set such difficulties in the way of 
their sons. Arguments for the use of the high school as a 
community centre are reénforced by the existence of situa-
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE NEED FOR NEW WANTS 189 
tions of the sort. Appreciation of the need for increased 
range of recreational opportunity must be taught as well as 
the use of existing types and facilities. 
The Need for New Wants.—A good deal has been said in 
the preceding chapters concerning the necessity of provision 
for growth in skill, in knowledge, in intellectual and zsthetic 
appreciation, during the education of the prospective farmer. 
That the creation of wants and desires is quite as appropriate 
an aim as achievement of abilities to satisfy existing wants is 
as true in the case of other life activities as in that of vocational 
activities. The same need of working upward and outward 
from present needs and interests in the pupil to prospective 
needs is evident. But that is of the method of education 
and not of the content. To indicate anything closely sug- 
gestive of the dynamic process of education and growth in the 
static formalities of the printed word is beyond the ability of 
one who lacks flair of literary genius. Yet it is legitimate to 
propose that one of the criteria for the selection of content 
objectives should be their value in the creation of new wants. 
In the case of the individual the acquirement of new standards 
of achievement, satisfying beyond those of present achieve- 
ment, probably adds to the readiness of possible new 
connections or the receptiveness of the learner. So long as that 
readiness exists and the connections are not made, to use the 
terminology of the psychologist, or so long as the receptive 
need is unfilled, there is motive to activity in acquirement or 
to growth. Once the connections have been made habitual 
there must be new readinesses, or growth will flag. Herein 
function the ideals of life, those concepts of the unattained 
or unattainable which influence so clearly the lives of most 
men. With the exceptional man that which must always be 
ideal, because it is forever unattainable, may motivate to 
growth. With the run of men, that which is ideal only in the
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
sense that it is beyond present achievement, is more certainly 
functional. The common man must hitch his wagon to some- 
thing less remote than a star. That fact the teacher in the 
selection of ideal standards, must bear in mind, whether such 
be of proficiency in vocational skills, in economic successes, in 
civic and moral accomplishments, or other. In most cases he 
must begin with ideals relatively easy of accomplishment ; and 
habituate the pupil to success in growth. As the course and 
the pupils develop the relative attainability of ideals may be 
made more difficult on an increasing scale. But always with 
due consideration of the differences in the nature and capaci- 
ties of individuals. It is seldom that the same ideal, even if 
clearly conceived by all members of the class, will serve equally 
to the growth of all toward its attainment. The lofty ideals 
often expressed in patriotic and moral codes fail of their effect 
with the many for the reason that only the exceptional are 
reached. In the teachings of the Salvation Army, at which the 
intellectual may sneer because of the crudity of the ideals 
formulated, is an example by which we may profit. The suc- 
cessful preachers of the street have brought down the stars. 
The by-products of daily experience lead to the creation of 
wants of all sorts in pupils, some worthy, some unworthy, 
whether the teacher participate consciously in their creation 
or not. Of them or some of them, the teacher who is in close 
touch and sympathy with his boys will be aware, and of them 
he must make use. But it is hardly safe to rely upon fortuitous 
circumstance to create the motives to growth. Like other 
habits the attitude, which looks to the formulation and the 
following of ideals may be taught. The boy who under 
guidance formulates an attainable ideal, is stimulated to con- 
stant reference to it in the process of his learning till he 
reaches the satisfaction of achievement, has passed the first 
step on the road to self-directing growth. The whole realm
-P-A-G-E-191
  MATHEMATICS 191 
of the functioning of ideals and of motive is foggy, even if 
reduced to terms of “synaptic readinesses,” but nevertheless of 
first significance. From the angle of content it is the realm of 
ideals, from that of method the realm of motive, and we should 
forget its existence in neither. 
In the light of the foregoing discussion there is offered a 
brief résumé of the types of studies, which, in the opinion of 
the writer, should enter into the curriculum of the prospective 
farmer in the high school. From the central core of vocational 
study are developed the implications of social and scientific 
insight necessary to the conduct of life in the open country as 
a result of the choice of a vocation in agriculture. 
Mathematics.—It is probable that instruments of mathe- 
matical skill are more frequently usable in direct connection 
with the conduct of vocation than in the allied activities of 
country living, and such mathematics can probably be most 
economically and effectively taught in connection with the 
problems met in the learning of vocation. But it is possible 
that there is a residual content of mathematics over and above 
the arithmetic of the elementary school which may justify the 
segregation of high school boys who are to be farmers, of high 
school boys who are not going to be farmers, and of high 
school girls, into a group for the study of that residual con- 
stant. That the scope of the subject will be small is a fairly 
safe assertion. It may be that the simple algebraic equation 
and the mensuration aspects of geometry are of sufficiently 
frequent usability to-be retained and to serve in the life of the 
ordinary individual. But the extraordinary expenditure of 
time and effort upon the part of the high school pupil now 
demanded, at the expense of complete sacrifice of learning 
in far more significant fields, in the study of the highly teach- 
able standard subjects of algebra and geometry, must be given 
over. All that the pupil will ever use and thereby retain can
-P-A-G-E-192
  192 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
probably be taught in a half year or less in three periods a 
week. The estimate is over generous in the opinion of some 
of our most competent mathematical scholars, 
Biological Science.—Biological science, particularly in 
the fields of plant and animal physiology, will function to a 
very considerable degree in the attainment of abilities in agri- 
cultural occupations, both in the objective and in the subjective 
aspects of vocation. But apart from any function of control 
or appreciative.insight in vocation, biological studies have a 
part in the education of one who is to spend a good share of his 
life in contact with the phenomena of living nature. Further, in 
some ofits larger aspects biological science probably represents 
a constant in the schooling of all high school pupils. So much 
of the process of society and of the affairs of daily life is 
explicable, and even controllable, only in the light of under- 
standing of evolutionary theory, of life’s beginnings and of 
its physical development, that such knowledge is part of the 
equipment of the civilized man. 
Much improvement is to be noted in recent years in the 
type of biological science in the high school. But many schools 
still retain the morphological and taxonomic botany and 
zodlogy of earlier days. Adoption of the functional and physi- 
ologic and civic aspects of biology, undivided into its several 
systematic sciences marks a decided improvement in a few 
rural high schools. A course well taught in terms of country 
life is a desirable feature of the curriculum of the pros- 
pective farmer. 
Physical Science.—Great improvement, too is to be noted 
in the content and method of chemistry teaching in a few rural 
high schools. On the whole, however, the teaching and the sub- 
ject are dominated by the traditional requirements of college 
entrance. A systematic study of the inorganic compounds, 
accompanied by a more or less remotely related series of
-P-A-G-E-193
  PHYSICAL SCIENCE 193 
“experiments ” to be recorded in a notebook for submittal to 
an examining officer is still the type of the course. To one 
who is not to become an experimentalist and specialist in the 
field of chemistry such a course is of very little use either 
as a means to control of vocational and daily affairs or as a 
means to insight into the ten thousand situations of life in 
which chemistry plays a significant part. A good deal of chem- 
istry is of immediate vocational value, as in the case of feeding 
and manuring processes in agriculture, and is ordinarily and 
appropriately taught by the teacher of agriculture in connec- 
tion with such processes. But the daily life of the countryman 
and of the American citizen calls for chemical controls and 
insights. It is not that the ordinary man is called upon to make 
over his environment to suit his needs through his development 
of chemical technic or interpretation, but in order that he may 
make use of the discoveries and applications of the science to 
his daily affairs. In matters of food, drink, sanitation, cloth- 
ing, shelter, minimal standards of chemical insight and control 
are indicated for the countryman. When we shall have really 
achieved that course in the “Chemistry of Daily Life,” par- 
ticularly in its rural aspects to which many recent texts aspire, 
we shall have a notable and valuable addition to the curricu- 
lum of the prospective farmer in the high school. 
The part.that physics plays in vocation and in life in the 
country is not less real than that of chemistry. On the farm, 
about the farmstead, and in the household constantly are being 
met situations to the understanding and control of which an 
elemental knowledge of physics is desirable. But the formal 
physics of the high school is in worse case than the chemistry. 
No drier, deader, more abstract and meaningless teaching is to 
be found in the country high school than much of that which 
passes under the name of physics. In the absence of appro- 
priate equipment for the teaching of that which he professes 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  
  194 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
to teach, the teacher of physics, under pressure of written 
examinations ahead, resorts to the blackboard and the text 
diagram as the chief means to concrete presentation, A 
“Physics of Daily Life” is even more urgently needed than 
achemistry of the kind, and for the same reasons. When such 
is organized it is an appropriate part of the curriculum. As 
things now stand, the writer is of opinion thabin many of our 
rural schools the pupils learn less of value and waste more of 
their time in physics than they do in pursuing algebra to the 
dead line of quadratic equations. Physics belongs in the cur- 
riculum, but not the so-called physics which at present leads 
up to a college entrance credit. 
Social Science.—The content divisions of social science in 
the high school are far less definitely standardized than is the 
case with the physical and biological sciences. That is not 
altogether unfortunate in view of the fact that most rural high 
schools have still to introduce the teaching of social science 
in any form whatever. “Community civics” comes as near 
to being standard in content and method as any of the studies 
in the field as developed in the high school. Reference has 
already been made to the status of that subject, in which as yet 
the influence of the college entrance requirements has played 
small part. The beginnings made in some schools are very 
promising. An inspirational text treatment of “ Rural 
Sociology ” and ‘“‘ Country Life Problems ” is to be found in 
a few schools which devote the marginal hours of mixed 
groups to the “subject.” The second rubric appears to indi- 
cate far more accurately than the first the purpose and the 
content of the course, but in practice the two courses are not 
ordinarily to be distinguished. A far more extended and inten- 
sive course working outward from the problems of family life 
in the country, through the neighborhood and community prob- 
lems, to the larger civic, social, and economic implications of
-P-A-G-E-195
  
MUSIC 195 
them appears to be of the type desirable for the prospective 
farmer. Whether the subjects be segregated under various de- 
nominations of civics, sociology, economics and education, or 
all maintained under one heading, makes little difference so 
long as the unified development may be maintained. Prob- 
lems of community health and recreation may of course 
be included. 
Health and Recreation——But the individual is so de- 
pendent in the country upon his immediate abilities in the 
maintenance of his own physical, esthetic, and intellectual 
well-being, that the individual aspects should be given special 
recognition, whether in segregated studies, or in the general 
category of the social. Physical and recreational training and 
instruction should look beyond the immediate welfare of the 
pupil in the school, as too often it does not. It must integrate 
with the home and neighborhood life of the boy, develop habits 
and knowledge appropriate to his present life and carrying on 
to the life of the prospective farmer and householder. Posted 
tules of health and coaching in school games are inadequate 
. from that point of view. 
Music.—It is doubtful that the resource of music on the 
creative side can in very large measure be developed in the 
high school education of the prospective farmer. ‘Occasionally 
orchestral instruction may be possible. But in the case of 
singing and in that of appreciation of both instrumental and 
vocal music a good deal can be done. In many city high 
schools where the need of the pupils both presently and in 
prospect is certainly not greater a highly developed system of 
musical instruction is in operation. Country schools all the 
way through the grades to the high schools are notably weak 
in that particular. Though some attempt at singing at least is 
made in the elementary grades the high school often omits 
music entirely from the program. 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
The question may be raised as to how the selection of 
music and literature for the curriculum is to be justified in 
the absence of any formal attempt to develop appreciation and 
creative ability in other forms of art. The ideal of developing 
appreciation of the beautiful in all things is a lofty one, and 
one not to be disputed as worthily held by-a great many 
people, and teachers in particular. But we cannot teach 
either the creation or the appreciation of the beautiful in 
general and in the abstract. So far as we can approach the 
ideal it must be through teaching in the particular and the 
concrete. Our starting point must then be found where the 
need and the opportunity are greatest. The arts of literature 
and of music are those in which the farmer is most likely to 
find his opportunity for enjoyment of the creations of man 
as an artist, and so far as the rural high school is concerned 
are likely to offer the largest resources for effective teaching 
in the realm of the artistic. Painting, sculpture, architecture, 
are equally worthy, but there is little contact with them in the 
life of the open country. The resource of photographs and 
plaster statuettes is a crude and limited one for the develop- 
ment of artistic desires, and perhaps in the degree that it 
succeeds is not altogether happy. To rouse desires that cannot 
in measurable degree be satisfied and that in the absence of 
opportunity cannot lead on to effective growth, is merely to 
create discontent with a life that affords large measures of 
opportunity for esthetic. satisfaction and growth in other 
fields. If, then, we make our effort in the fields of primary 
need and opportunity the justification for the selection of the 
two most extensively developed arts is well founded. 
Appreciation of the beautiful in nature and in the life of 
human beings about us, and in the home and in the vocation, is, 
of course, an appropriate objective in the teaching of the other 
studies indicated and needs no segregation from them.
-P-A-G-E-197
  ENGLISH 197 
English.—There is little tendency on the part of the 
rural high school to neglect the mother tongue, nor is much 
fault to be found with the aims or the content of the high 
school course in English. The real difficulty with the study 
of English in the high school is in the method of instruction, 
particularly in that part which has to do with the appreciation 
of literature as against the development of the use of language 
as an instrument of communication. 
In the latter particular the mere fact of segregation of the 
instruction into a separate course in English indicates the 
nature of the chief resultant weakness. The language is used 
largely for oral expression in all kinds of social situations. 
It is one of the chief means to-the effective control of those 
situations. It is used daily and hourly in both spoken and 
written form in all the work of the high school, yet little 
attention is ordinarily paid to it in those situations to which it 
is most significant. It has been suggested, and there is much 
meat in the suggestion, that either all the teachers of the high 
school must be teachers of English all the time, or there must 
be teachers. of English in charge of all the written and oral 
expression of students in the high school during school hours. 
Though complete realization of the status indicated is probably 
out of the question, we can certainly come much nearer 
to it than we do under the present practice of assembling 
classes for one period in each day to deal with the formal 
structure, analysis and synthesis of the mother tongue. 
There is no poverty of resource in English literature, and 
a farmer, as reasonably successful as the vocationally trained 
student of the high school should be, need never suffer from 
serious lack of opportunity to avail himself of that resource. 
The continuous extension of library facilities in the country 
districts makes a further enlargement. Our difficulty is again 
not in the facilities, but in the use of them. A great deal has 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
been wrtten in recent years concerning the teaching of appre- 
ciation, but it is fairly evident that not a great deal is as yet 
known about it, and not much of that little is in possession 
of high school teachers. Since college and state examinations 
still continue to demand that the pupil must dissect and 
analyze that which achieves its beauty and its merit in its 
wholeness, we find that teachers still insist that pupils shall 
put to death the living thing which they are learning to love for 
the life that is in it. Forms, hidden meanings, allusions, un- 
usual constructions, must be looked up and explained in detail, 
and the beauty of the forest missed in examination of the bark, 
the twigs, and the fallen leaves of the trees. Instead of 
learning to love the living literature pupils learn to abominate 
the dead. 
There is not much question but that the best way to teach 
the pupil to enjoy is to let him enjoy. But just how to do 
that is a question. It is true that Milton’s major poems are 
tending to go out from among the required readings, that 
Burke on Conciliation is less in evidence, and that Kipling, 
Jack London, and Stevenson come in to replace them, not 
because of superior merit as literature, but because boys do 
seem to enjoy them, and from them may be led on to “ higher 
things.” But the answer is not yet. The boy who cannot 
read more than three pages of Treasure Island at a sitting, 
when he is burning with eagerness to go on and finish the 
wonderful tale before midnight, who must recite drearily upon 
the several paragraphs of those pages, and explain “ To what 
does Stevenson make allusion in that phrase?” experiences 
much of the dissatisfaction which formerly went with Paradise 
Lost, and another in addition. At least he did not want to 
read any further in Milton and he did not have to do so. If 
he reads ahead in Stevenson it is at the peril of getting a month 
ahead of the class.
-P-A-G-E-199
HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY 199 
Now the writer makes no pretense of possessing skill or 
knowledge of the teaching of literary appreciation. He has 
tried and failed too often in the first and has come out befog- 
ged and bewildered too often in the attempt to gain the second. 
But the idea of providing the student with a liberal opportunity 
to “ browse” among good books, particularly those which are 
known to interest the run of boys, makes a strong appeal. A 
sort of “supervised study” in library reading, rather than 
formal recitation by all on the same page of the same book 
gives the boy an opportunity to learn to enjoy by enjoying. A 
very successful teacher of English literature, judged by the 
evident interest and display of knowledge of books shown 
by her class, pursued such a practice. Further she was very 
skilful in raising questions for group discussion, particularly 
with regard to motives and characters, which stimulated the 
desire to read and gave purpose to critical reading. One other 
resource she had, which appeared remarkably effective. She 
was a genius at reading aloud: Without any display of the 
art of the elocutionist she could bring her pupils to tears or to 
laughter. A book became beautiful by her reading of it, and 
her pupils had profited by the example. 
History and Biography.—With respect to the content of 
courses in history and biography there appears to be no reason 
that differentiation should be made for the boy who is to be- 
come a farmer, except on the basis now advocated for the 
teaching of history, that history like other studies begins at 
home. Much has been written of late on the teaching of 
history, and no attempt at summary or recommendation will 
be made here. Suffice it to say that arousing in the boy the 
desire to read the story of his own people and of other peoples 
is to do much more for him than to develop the ability to state 
historical facts promptly and clearly on an examination paper. 
To attain its fullest usefulness history must serve as a basis 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
200 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
of interpretation of present social and economic conditions 
known to the pupil. If the habit of turning to history for the 
explanation of present phenomena be developed by the prob- 
lem approach in teaching it becomes a double resource, on the 
one hand a resource of intelligent guidance in the affairs of 
life, on the other a resource of zsthetic and intellectual enjoy- 
ment like to literature. Biography, because it is personal, 
often has more appeal than even the fuller history texts, and 
may serve to better advantage to enable the boy to place him- 
self, metaphorically, in the midst of the persons and events 
with which it deals. Reading of history and biography offers 
much the same resource to the farmer as does the reading of 
literature of another type. 
Selection of Content.—Criteria for the selection of con- 
tent in the vocational course have already been advanced and 
discussed. They are of the basic type applicable to the selec- 
tion of all content, and should in their turn be usable in all 
the studies of the curriculum. Of course the incidence of the 
several factors will vary from subject to subject. For ex- 
ample, seasonal and local opportunity are of considerable sig- 
nificance in the selection of content for the biology studies, but 
of quite minor significance in the case of English, history, and 
music. But the type, frequency, and certainty of situations 
to be met should always be major considerations ‘in the deter- 
mination of what is to be taught.

  CHAPTER XII 
DETERMINANTS OF METHOD 
Subject Matter and Content.—It may well appear to 
some that in the presentation of criteria for selection of con- 
tent there has been encroachment upon the field of method. 
Perhaps. The writer is unable to separate the two concepts 
readily. There is a view-point as we shift gradually from 
the aspect of content to that of method where the two blend 
in the fringes. Holding that subject matter is the actual 
sequence of experiences acquired by the pupil under edu- 
cative direction, we may evaluate that subject matter in terms 
of its significance to society and to the individual, we may set 
up specific aims derivative of less specific, and call these 
valuations or aims content. For example: 
Content determined : A 
1. Superiority of nozzle A to nozzle B (specific) 
from 
2. Effective use of Bordeaux mixture (less specific) 
from 
3. Effective control of Fall blight (less specific) 
from 
4. Production of sound potatoes (less specific) 
from 
5. Economical production of potatoes (less specific) 
from 
. Efficiency as a potato grower in Aroostook region 
(least specific). 
In the derivation of content we look at the pupil from the 
point of view of society. an 
203 
   
-P-A-G-E-204
  204 DETERMINANTS OF METHOD 
Method.—When, however,. we look with the pupil as re- 
ceiver of stimuli from the objective data upon which we have 
determined as content, when we consider intrinsic values in 
his experiences rather than the instrumental or socially de- 
rived values, then we begin to select subject matter in the light 
of method. When we think of a teaching situation in terms 
of what is meant to this boy now, instead of what it should 
mean for this boy to-morrow or five years hence, we are 
looking at the subject matter in the aspect of method. 
Criteria of Method.—Before entering upon the discus- 
sion of organization of course of study in vocational agricul- 
ture and specific types of procedure in the teaching of such a 
course, it is well, for the sake of unity to set forth certain major 
criteria for guidance in method, so that we shall not come to 
confuse subject matter in its true sense with content—the 
social aspect of it. 
Activity—Modern educators judge of the success of 
teachers by the activity of their pupils. Since education con- 
sists in-changes or modifications in the learner as a result of 
his own activity and by no other means, the standard that no 
method is successful except it result in activity is a just one. 
What the pupils do, in the narrow meaning can be seen, felt, 
or heard; what they think and feel is not to be seen or heard; 
yet thinking and feeling are quite as truly activities as muscu- 
lar movements. Accordingly, the judge of method not only 
observes carefully what pupils do, but attempts to check up 
unobservable activity by means of its effects, that is by test 
and measurement. 
But activity, per se, can never be a ‘fair measure of the 
worth of the teacher as stimulator That activity must be 
directed to the ends set up by teacher as worth while—that is 
to the acquirement of subject matter in accord with the se- 
lected content. A class may be very busy on an excursion, 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  MOTIVE 205 
throwing stones, eating apples, discussing the football game, 
“jollying ” the teacher. But such activity, if indicative of the 
real effect of the situations designed by the teacher, is never- 
theless a sign that as a teacher he is more or less a failure. If, 
on the other hand, every boy is busy at the occupation appro- 
priate to the objects of teaching at that time, the observed 
activity is a good index of the teacher’s success in method. 
Again, a class may be apparently busy, as in reading a book, 
examining a machine, both of which are appropriate to the 
teaching end. But, upon test, they fail to show the effects of 
the activity which appearance indicated was engaging them. 
In that case the method fails because the teacher has not 
achieved the reality of perception, thinking, or emotion, to 
which he designed his stimuli. 
Satisfaction.—If activity on the part of the pupil is to be 
fully effective in the making of desired changes in him, then 
that activity must be accompanied by some degree of satisfac- 
tion ; the degree of satisfaction being quite as important as the 
intensity or frequency of action. But satisfaction is not 
necessarily pleasure in the ordinary sense of the word, it is 
rather a sense of appropriateness, that the thing done “fills the 
bill,” at least to the extent that the learner would not avoid 
the same course again. 
Motive.—Now, undoubtedly, some satisfaction does ac- 
-company every activity of learning. Every act has a motive, 
though we cannot always find it. But that satisfaction may be 
intrinsically a sense of discomfort, even pain, which would 
lead, in other circumstances, to avoidance of a like course. It 
is a satisfaction only because it is less dissatisfying than the 
accompaniment or result of an alternative course; the activity 
is appropriate to the end of avoidance of greater discomfort. 
In such case the motive is negative, as when a task is under- 
taken to avoid punishment, to avoid disapproval, even to
-P-A-G-E-206
  206 DETERMINANTS OF METHOD 
please the teacher. Now negative motives are frequent results 
of our teaching methods, and often they are strong motives. 
But they fail, in the large, because they are not normal accom- 
paniments of the situations for which we design to prepare. 
We may compel the boys to figure rations correctly, prune 
trees to standard, put away the tools at the end of the shop 
period ; but we have trained them thereby to do these things in 
the case when someone in authority stands by to see that they 
are done. On the farm no one stands over the farmer to make 
him get up at five and milk, to make him use pruning shears 
instead of an axe on his trees, to make him refrain from 
kicking his horse in the belly. If the boy cannot do those 
things with a sense that they are appropriate to his own ends, 
then, he cannot be expected to do them as a farmer. 
Inherent Motive.—Positive motive is of two sorts, in- 
herent and derivative. The small boy drives up the cows 
because he likes to drive them, to make the stragglers hustle, 
to feel that he is boss and master of those great creatures. He 
gets out the axe and goes to chopping because he likes to chop, 
to get results, to make things happen. To chop the plum tree 
in the yard, or the front steps, is quite as satisfying as to chop 
birch trees in the back lot. Now this satisfaction which is 
inherent in certain forms of activity is based on instinct, either 
directly, or through acquired modification. The most obvious 
instincts are curiosity and play, but there are many others 
with which it is well that the teacher should be acquainted. 
The boy does not by pure instinct enjoy riding or driving a 
horse ; by instinct he is more or less afraid of the big creature. 
But he learns to like it, and once in control, the instinct of 
mastery and others reinforce the enjoyment. Thus we can 
get a boy, whom we should have to force into holding the 
cultivator, to ride the horse for cultivation or drive on an 
errand to town, gladly enough. Though it may be doubted that 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
DERIVED MOTIVE 207 
there is any instinct of workmanship, per se, yet the instincts 
of curiosity and manipulation are so strong that we rarely have 
to force beginners in shop work. They like to do it. Nor is it 
true that boys do not like to think, to use their minds. In- 
tellectual activity is instinctively satisfying. The boy’s mind is 
seldom vacant. It appears so, only because he is thinking not 
as we would have him think. Thus, if the teacher gets the boy 
to act as he would have him act, because the boy likes to do 
the thing for its own sake, he has gained a powerful motive 
to the accomplishment of his ends. 
Derived Motive.--But we cannot, in any full measure, 
rely on motives inherent in activities themselves. Vocational 
activities are normally means to ends, not ends in themselves, 
for the worker. The farmer drives the cows, locks them in 
their stanchions, feeds them, cleans them off, milks them, 
strains the milk, puts it away in the cooler, and hitches up at 
dawn to drive to the collector’s platform, not because he 
enjoys those things as play, but because they are means to the 
pay check, which is in turn a means to food, recreation, edu- 
cation for his children. If he enjoys them to such an extent 
that he would perform them all regardless of the pay check 
or the possible new car, we should have an ideal condition, 
but normally we must not forget that such is not the case. His 
work may be play sometimes, but it is always work. Work is 
undertaken for the sake of the results that come from it. 
Work is what we prepare for in vocational education. Work 
is the chief means by which, always, we must educate 
to work. 
Therefore, in large part, the teacher of agriculture is de- 
pendent upon derived motive in his teaching. To secure 
derived motive he must suggest to the mind of the boy a pur- 
pose, a definite purpose which calls for just those activities 
which the teacher deems needful to his own purposes of  
-P-A-G-E-208
  208 DETERMINANTS OF METHOD 
education. That is, the boy must undertake of his own 
initiative the work which the teacher would have him do. Not 
under the spur of tongue, of threat of failure, or promise of 
reward, but under the spur of his own felt need for accom- 
plishment must he carry through the tasks of skill perfection, 
judgment, thinking, which shall eventuate in the satisfaction 
of that need. It may be a momentary objective that he seeks, 
the approval of father or mother or fellows, the surpassing of 
rivals, the verification of a theory, or what not from which 
the motive derives. So long as he acts and governs his acts 
in accordance with a purpose not foreign to his procedure 
he has a positive motive, properly derived. That in the voca- 
tion the motive is normally economic is good reason for the 
use of such a motive. Whence comes the economic need is a 
matter somewhat beyond the borders of vocational education. 
Thus, the teacher who leads his boys to the discovery of needs 
legitimately to be satisfied through activities appropriate to the 
mastery of vocational skill, technology, or social ability, has 
found the prime essential of good method. 
Initiative-—Good method is further measured by the 
extent to which it is causal of initiative on the part 
of pupils. Of course, in one sense, any genuine mo- 
tive is a sort of initiative on the part of the pupil, 
to the extent that the motive furnishes satisfaction to 
make activity worthwhile to him he is self-impelled, “ going 
it on his own.” Psychologically it is probably true that no 
act is ever performed in any other way. But mere response 
to stimulus according to reflex, instinctive, or fixed habitual 
connections, is not considered display of initiative in the sense 
here used. Neither are conscious acts undertaken for a pur- 
pose known, if the motive be negative. The limiting case is 
that of positively motivated purposeful act at the one end; 
at the other the continuous development out of an act of 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  INITIATIVE 209 
new needs, new purposes, new motives, and new acts which 
mean continuous adaptation and readaptation, growth apart 
from any conscious direction by another. The last is 
the ideal stage at which the teacher abdicates, becomes, by 
virtue of its own success, unnecessary. That is, of course, 
a result particularly desirable in vocational training for the 
farming occupations. The good farmer, even the good farm 
hand, because so often and so largely thrown on his own re- 
sources apart from a present “ boss,” must have a consider- 
able measure of initiative. He must “ go it on his own hook.” 
In teaching, initiative is developed very much in propor- 
tion as the activities originally stimulated under any “ topic,” 
“esson,” or “teaching unit” are energizing in value. In 
shop work, for instance, the teacher often thinks of learning 
as consisting in a series of steps or tool processes—as accurate 
layout, squaring up, planing off, joint fitting, etc. With the 
exercise of a good deal of ingenuity he may discover and 
arouse positive motives to the taking of each of these steps in 
turn. But here initiative on the part of the pupil is at a mini- 
mum. If he can arouse motive for example, by need of the 
boy to save time in the feeding of his pigs, to making a self- 
feeder, he may lead the boy to discovery of the necessity for a 
series of valuable “ process” acquirements, the completion 
of a series of “ steps ” without furnishing new stimulus and 
stirring new motive for each in succession. The boy performs 
on his own initiative a much greater range of worthwhile 
activities as the result of a single “ teacher furnished ” stimu- 
lus than in the first case. The acts of the teacher are reduced 
in their proportion to the consequent activities of pupils. That 
is what is meant by the statement of an able superintendent: 
“The less a teacher does in the way of teaching, the more I 
think of him as a teacher.” 
14  
-P-A-G-E-210
    210 DETERMINANTS OF METHOD 
Weighing of Values.—Obviously, development of initia- 
tive is to a greater extent possible where the range of selec- 
tion of activities appropriate to a given end is great, than 
where it is small. There is less room for selection in reply 
to the first of these questions than in the second: (1) Which 
of these cows is taller at the withers? (2) Which of these two 
cows is the more profitable purchase? But selective activity 
is not confined to reflective thinking. Even in so simple a case 
as setting in a screw the end can be accomplished by a variety 
of means. Some positions and movements are much more 
effective in the saving of effort and time than others. In the 
first teaching of such a skill the pupil should be aware of such 
differences and select, in terms of their relative values to 
accomplishment, the more effective positions and movements. 
That, as a skilled workman he does so unconsciously is the 
appropriate result of his doing it consciously in first learning, 
or “ tackling of the problem.” A large part of the success of 
the farmer and a part, even, of that of the employe in the 
minor “ trade” vocations of agriculture, consists in ability to 
select the appropriate in terms of its value for the accom- 
plishment of a given end. Hence, good method in teaching 
will suggest motives to activity, purposes, involving as large a 
scope as may be fit in the case of selection of possible re- 
sponses, of weighing of values by the pupil. 
Organization.—But if out of fifty possible positions and 
movements usable or not usable in the setting up of a screw the 
pupil selects as valuable a half dozen, he yet does not set the 
screw efficiently until he has organized these positions and 
movements into the grouping, sequence, or form complex, 
necessary to setting it speedily, easily and accurately. If out of 
a thousand possible suggestive data in respect to the tawvo cows 
in question (2) above such as size, capacity, constitution, 
health, age, color of hair, length of switch, squint of the eye,
-P-A-G-E-211
  ORGANIZATION 211 
expression, curve of hocks, manure on the thighs, size of 
udder, quality of udder, name of sire, asking price, possible 
price, price of milk, size of teats, color of teats, ease of 
milking, evidence of thirst, hoarseness of bellow, switching 
of tail, etc., if out of these the pupil has selected those rela- 
tively most valuable as indices to profitable purchase, weighed 
them in cow A against cow B, he is not yet ready to answer 
the question intelligently until he has organized these into 
comparative systems, wholes, which eventuate in judgment of 
probable economic effectiveness of either cow, and final judg- 
ment between the two. Good method will stimulate learning 
activities in which organization plays a manifestly im- 
portant part. 
The standards suggested * are, of course, the aims of 
method, by which to a considerable degree, the actualities of 
teaching procedure may be guided: they do not indicate exact 
forms of procedure. But from them, in the teaching of 
adolescents in vocational agriculture, have been evolved cer- 
tain type forms, or teaching units, which, in their variant 
applications to specific cases, are highly useful and suggestive 
to teachers. Those type forms, as developed in experience of 
teachers, will be discussed and illustrated in detail, further on. 
Certainly no teaching can succeed in producing activity 
positively motivated, can give scope to true initiative, selective 
evaluation, and appropriate organization, except it look with 
the boy as he is now, facing a possible specific situation now. 
To put himself in the boy’s place is the first step of the suc- 
cessful teacher. Teacher and pupil must stand, as method is 
evolved, upon common ground of experience to face a new 
experience. To see with the learner is the first criterion of 
good teaching method.

  CHAPTER XIII 
FORMS OF TEACHING IN VOCATIONAL 
AGRICULTURE 
SUPERVISED WORK ON FARMS 
Tue directed work of the pupils in the actualities of a 
farming vocation may take the following forms: (a) the 
productive enterprise, (b) the business undertaking, 
(c) supervised work as employe ona farm. As to the nature 
and selection of the first (a) and the second (b), perhaps, 
enough has been said. Yet there remain certain problems in 
respect to each of them which must be solved by the teacher 
in the case of classes and individuals. The third (c) is an 
alternative form ordinarily precedent to the other two. 
The Effects of Free Election.—In the present status of 
secondary teaching considerable latitude is allowed to pupils 
in the choice of enterprises. So long as the particular enter- 
prises fall within the “ subject ” prescribed for the course and 
year the boy is allowed to choose according to his particular 
interests and opportunities at home. Thus we find in a year 
assigned to the study of crops, “ projects” varying through 
dahlia growing, lettuce, onions and celery, a home garden 
including all the common vegetables, field corn, silage corn, 
sweet corn, popcorn, beets and turnips, potatoes, tomatoes, 
raspberries, cabbage. Ina year devoted to animal husbandry 
we find hens, pigeons, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs, 
brood sows, pigs, sheep, calves, cows, bees and occasionally a 
colt or a yoke of steers. On the other hand, we find rather 
strict limitations. In the first year, perhaps, every boy is re- 
212
-P-A-G-E-213
  
THE EFFECTS OF FREE ELECTION 213 
quired to “carry a project” in poultry—and poultry means 
chickens, not geese, ducks, pigeons or turkeys. The only 
choice with the boy is as to breed, and, within limits, as to 
number. Or, in the first year every boy must have a home 
garden in which not less than eleven of a given list of vege- 
tables are to be grown. 
Under the free choice system every boy in a class studies 
in the crop year the standard crops—cereals, forage, fibre, and 
miscellaneous—regardless of the fact that he grows but one 
sort, or that he or any of his classmates may be growing a 
crop not in the list at all. In the other case of decided 
restriction the class studies poultry only, or vegetable garden- 
ing only. Both cases fall under the category of “ voca- 
tional agriculture.” 
But clearly the first case can hardly deserve classification 
as “ vocational ” in the strict sense. It serves to open up lanes 
of discovery in agricultural vocations and to give information 
concerning the nature and requirements of those vocations, 
if not of the life implied in the pursuit of them. Thus it may 
prove a means of vocational choice. The second case, of 
restricted election, obviously implies intensive, and probably 
more effective, class teaching, and is of the type of good voca- 
tional teaching. But it is not necessarily, or under prescrip- 
tion, even probably vocational. For the boy who has chosen 
to enter a farming vocation in which poultry raising, or 
vegetable gardening is a major or minor enterprise of im- 
portance the work is vocational education. But for boys 
desiring to enter other farming vocations it serves but indi- 
rectly to such purpose. For many boys at present, who in the 
absence of adequate knowledge and experience, enter the 
course because of an interest in things agricultural or of the 
farm, it can serve only to vocational choice. 
It thus appears that much of agricultural education in
-P-A-G-E-214
214 FORMS OF TEACHING 
secondary schools is not, whatever its designation, of the vo- 
cational type. Content is not determined by specific vocational 
objectives, nor entrance by intelligent choice or test of 
capacity. But the fact is not necessarily an indictment of the 
secondary teaching of agriculture. Rather, on the whole, the 
fact that such teaching is prevocational is creditable. No 
very effective system of vocational education in agriculture 
can be established until it can be founded on a reasonably good 
prevocational system. The work of the high schools at 
present seems to be toward the laying of that foundation. 
Nevertheless, there is danger that the prevocational may, 
through habituation, come to be thought of as the vocational. 
Even under present conditions it is not necessary that the 
prevocational aspect should prevail in selection of content and 
method throughout the high school course. A reorganization 
of the first year’s work, or rarely of the first two years, to 
clearly prevocational objectives makes possible strictly appro- 
priate vocational teaching in the remaining years. Since 
choice of a farming vocation implies choice of a mode of life 
quite different from that which is the background of most 
professional and industrial vocations it becomes important that 
the character of that life be made clear in the prevocational 
teaching. Test of capacity for the vocation by experience or 
by any conceivable system of psychological measurement may 
suffice to an efficient autocratic selection, but not to democratic 
self-discovery. Many a boy is capable of developing the 
skills, knowledges and social abilities necessary to success in 
a farming vocation who would fall short of self-realization, 
happiness, and full civic efficiency as a countryman. Of the 
duties, obligations, and opportunities of country life the pre- 
vocational teaching must make much. 
The Necessity for Requirement.—But, for the boy who 
has made choice of a particular farming vocation no such
-P-A-G-E-215
  
MAJORITY RULE 215 
range of choice in educative activities as may be open under a 
prevocational scheme is possible. He must learn through the 
business undertaking which typifies that vocation, and through 
no other; he must learn through the productive enterprises 
which coérdinate in that business, and through no others. A 
group seeking to discover interests and capacities in the field 
of agriculture may divide enterprises and business under- 
takings among them, from bee keeping and rabbit raising to 
poultry, sheep, and swine raising. If one discovers himself 
in rabbit raising, another in bee keeping, another in pig raising, 
each respectively may gain something of proficiency in the 
vocation of the Belgian hare fancier, the apiarist, or swine 
grower from the “ project” he has chosen. But the group 
which aspires to success in whole milk production in central 
New York will learn through like businesses and enterprises 
determined by that dairy farming vocation, not some by rais- 
ing rabbits, others bees, others sheep, etc. Their choice will 
be strictly limited to such items as breed or variety, initial 
acreage and number of animals, particular cash crop for the 
year and preference in order of enterprises. 
Majority Rule—Under a Unit System.—In the last case, 
the determination of order or enterprises, purely individual 
selection cannot be allowed. The economy and effectiveness 
gained in class teaching by conduct of the same sort of enter- 
prise by every member of the class in the same year, if it does 
not justify prescription by the teacher, or supervisor, at least 
justifies the use of plurality rule. For example, suppose an 
enterprise in potato growing is indicated for the course either 
in 1923, 1924 or 1925. If of twenty boys five find it most 
convenient for 1923, six for 1924 and nine for 1925, then, 
other things being equal, the enterprise in potato grow- 
ing should be the work of every boy in 1925. If division be 
allowed according to preference, then class teaching must be
-P-A-G-E-216
216 FORMS OF TEACHING 
given to a class of five in 1923, of six in 1924, of nine in 1925, 
or if in a single year to a majority who have no present prob- 
lem in potato growing. Vocational requirement can be met 
equally well, the preference of the largest number satisfied, 
and class teaching made much more effective by a ruling that 
the work-study unit in potato growing shall be used in 1925. 
Full Vocational Responsibility—It is, perhaps, worth 
repeating that the business undertaking and the productive 
enterprises must be “ man size,” responsible pursuits. Charges 
for rent, interest, use of equipment and power, seed, fertilizer, 
feed, wages, etc., must come upon the learner as they do upon 
the farmer, since the one is pursuing a vocation in the process 
of learning as the other in the process of earning. In the 
same way all gains or losses belong to the boy producer or 
entrepreneur if the vocational situation is to be preserved. 
But the securing of such conditions appropriate to vocational 
teaching is often a difficulty to the teacher. 
Misguided benevolence will, perhaps, as often be met as 
stinginess on the part of parents, and is probably more diffi- 
cult to deal with. If the boy is obligated to full payment as 
any other purchaser or renter the family income is not much 
lessened and may often be increased. With a clear under- 
standing of that fact those fathers who “ can’t spare ” the land 
or the animals or the stable room necessary to the enterprise 
are usually convinced. A year of success ordinarily removes 
further difficulties on that score. But the benevolent father 
who would give his boy the land and animals for the sake of 
the boy, the philanthropic banker or merchant who, for the 
sake of the community, would set the boys up in business, and 
the good citizen or enthusiastic superintendent who agrees 
to furnish all the fertilizer, or all the seed, or a calf apiece, or 
to buy at the top price all the produce, is harder to handle. If 
the offer be rejected he feels that his rights have been invaded,
-P-A-G-E-217
  
VOCATIONAL MOTIVE Q17 
his kindness rebuffed. It calls for tact, firmness, and per- 
suasive logic on the part of the teacher to bring him to the 
belief that the gift may defeat its own ends. But the free 
giver has been converted to the generous lender by clear 
understanding of the.purpose of the work, much to the benefit 
of vocational teaching. 
Agreements.—Experienced teachers are in disagreement 
in regard to the formal signed “contract or agreement ” be- 
tween parents and school authorities. There is a strong 
disinclination among farmers to place their signatures upon a 
“egal sounding ” document which appears to obligate them. 
Even the simple memorandum of understanding sent out from 
the school to the parents is likely to come back with few sig- 
natures, and such not always indicative of a real understand- 
ing. The most successful practice, as the writer has judged 
of it, is that in which the boy, parent, and teacher confer 
together at the farm house and there formulate for mutual 
signature their own memorandum of understanding in regard 
to the supervised farm work. Such a procedure takes time 
and patience on the part of the teacher, but seems to go far- 
thest in establishing the work on a vocational basis and in 
removing cause for misunderstandings and difficulties as the 
season develops. 
Vocational Motive.—Now, although the business under- 
taking and productive enterprises be appropriately selected, 
related, and codrdinated, to ends specifically known to the 
teacher, the teaching situation is not vocational or the pupil 
“motivated ” in the fullest sense, except there be in the mind 
of the pupil specific ends of importance in his own life to be 
accomplished. That is particularly true in initial enterprises 
wherein contributory relationships to the business and the 
habit of earning have not been established. It is probably true 
that most farmers do not have to their business undertakings
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 FORMS OF TEACHING 
more specific ends than making a living, a good living, or the 
best living possible with the resources at hand. But even here 
the influence of more specific purpose, such as to pay off $1,000 
on the mortgage next year, to send John to college, to buy a 
pure-bred sire, to purchase an adjoining quarter, probably 
counts to effectiveness, though we have no data other than 
hearsay and the stories of farmers to prove the case. But the 
aphorism “ you can’t work right till you know what you are 
working for ” applies safely to farmers. The boy learning has 
not, in many cases, the habit and the necessity for earning 
that characterize the adult married farmer. Accordingly it is 
with him even more necessary that specific motives to produc- 
tion, to the management of business be sought out. To carry 
out the farm work requirements in order to earn a passing 
mark or two and a half points credit toward graduation is to 
work with a motive, but not with an appropriate or vocational 
motive. To work with the aim of “making some money,” 
raising “ some potatoes” or an “acre of corn” is less stimu- 
lating and calls for less initiative, evaluation, and organization 
in activity than to work in raising potatoes to earn $150 to 
buy a cow, or a bicycle, gun, and suit of clothes, or to start a 
fund to carry sister through the normal school. To raise an 
acre of corn calls for less of educative activity than to raise 
corn enough to feed 150 hens or to provide silage for two 
cows and a heifer. A boy has to do as much in the second as 
in the first case, and to know considerably more. 
Prompt Results.—With boys of the vocational group, 
already experienced and somewhat more mature than those of 
the prevocational group, promptness in results is of less im- 
portance than with the prevocational group. It is a part of 
the work of the vocational teaching to develop that faith in a 
future harvest, in a future standard of achievement, such as 
enables the good farmer to plant his seasonal crops, to hold to
-P-A-G-E-219
  CONTINUITY OF ACTIVITY 219 
his rotation, to set out his apple trees or to buy the pure-bred 
foundation stock fora herd. But that faith develops through 
experience in the results of foresight. Accordingly successful 
realization of plans is an important feature of the vocational 
work during the limited time the pupil is under direction of 
the teacher. In a course of one or two years certain enter- 
prises are distinctly limited in that respect, as, for instance, 
the setting of asparagus or a cranberry bog, the raising of a 
calf or a colt, and in any course of present standard, the set- 
ting of an orchard. So far as selection of enterprises in the 
light of the needs of the vocation be possible, consideration 
should be given to the achievement of results. 
Measurable Progress.—Further it is a highly desirable 
condition that progress towards results be measurable ob- 
jectively. If the boy cannot “ see that his work is getting him 
somewhere” his interest flags and his faith diminishes. 
Probably in that consideration lies the justification for the 
weighing of pigs and poultry, a practice not frequent with 
experienced farmers. The single colt or heifer enterprise is 
weak in that respect, whereas with laying hens, milking cows, 
growing chicks, and most of the seasonal crops response to 
good care is prompt enough and plain enough to be a 
distinct stimulus. 
Continuity of Activity—Growth.—Again consideration 
of demand by the enterprise for continual, if not continuous 
activity, is a factor to be considered. A sole enterprise in a 
given year with hay, oats or other cereals and broadcast forage 
crops is undesirable for the reason that activity is intermittent 
and unevenly distributed. The tilled crops are much superior 
in this respect, and a combination of several feed and fertility 
enterprises such as corn, oats and hay, or of non-competing 
cash crops, or of cash crops and feed crops, is not only more 
representative but more nearly continuous in demands for
-P-A-G-E-220
220 FORMS OF TEACHING 
work and thinking than any single crop enterprise is likely to 
be. With animal enterprises a less difficult situation exists. 
They call for constant care. The chief difference between 
them is in the changing nature of demands from some as 
against constant repetition of the same demands from others. 
Laying hens demand as constant care as growing chicks, 
milking cows as growing calves, fattening hogs as breeding 
sows, but in each case the second enterprise makes more rapid 
change and covers a larger range in its demands than the first. 
Here, too, combination is a superior means. Hens and 
chickens, cows and calves, sows and pigs, are fortunately more 
frequently representative of vocational demands than the more 
limited enterprises. 
Limitations.—Always, of course, home limitations set 
bounds to the determination of enterprises, sometimes to 
the complete elimination of any really valuable vocational 
experience at home, but more often in the matter of size and 
scope of the enterprises. It may be that the desirable enter- 
prise should include a cow, a heifer, and a calf, but only one 
animal can be had ; that the poultry enterprise should include 
work with the incubator, but the best that can be done is the 
purchase of chicks. If the school and community resources 
permit the supplementation of deficiencies, as in the cases 
given, by working on a job at feeding and caring for calves 
and young stock or running an incubator for someone else, 
then such enterprises are acceptable even with the limited re- 
sponsibility involved in them. With crops, limitations in area 
are frequent in the first year of a course, but limitations in 
diversity much less so. Here, however, the factors determin- 
ing size, that have already been discussed, come in. If a boy 
can obtain but three-quarters of an acre of land for his enter- 
prises in corn, oats and hay, it is probably better that he should 
put it all into corn than to divide it among the three crops.
-P-A-G-E-221
SUPERVISED EMPLOYMENT 221 
Supplementation through farm work in preparation, planting 
and harvest of the other two crops is usually to be had in 
farm work for father or a neighbor. 
Supervised Employment.—Then there is the case in 
which at the start of the course it is difficult or practically im- 
possible for the boy to carry on an enterprise of his own. 
Land, animals, equipment, are not to be had at home or by 
purchase or loan, or rent, for the reason that either the course 
or the boy does not yet command confidence sufficient to an 
economic investment. In such cases several states are already 
accepting so-called “farm work projects” in lieu of the 
responsible home enterprise during the first year of the 
course. By such means the boy can earn enough to make the 
necessary investment in the succeeding year and at the same 
time gain much valuable experience. Such a form cannot be 
maintained throughout the course because it fails to provide 
the elements of managerial responsibility. But it can serve to 
give skills and basic meanings to technological study, if not 
any very impelling motive to that study. 
Precautions must be used in working with the farm em- 
ployment form of “ project.” First, the boy must go to work 
on a farm representative of the vocation which he desires to 
follow. Work on a fruit farm cannot be accepted for the 
dairy farming course. Second, he must not become merely 
chore boy or field hand. There must be agreement with the 
farmer for whom he works that he shall participate in the 
various kinds of farm work appropriate to the learning of his | 
vocation and his physical and mental limitations. In the | 
absence of such agreement he is likely to be put at washing | 
bottles, milking, cleaning the stables, delivering the milk, — | 
raking the tailings, and other special tasks for which a ready 
assignment is found. The case of the college student who 
went into the orchards of California to learn the business and 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  
  222 FORMS OF TEACHING 
spent his entire summer in picking fruit is classic. On the 
large farm if a hand is particularly proficient at one job that 
is the job at which he is set. It is good management by the 
farmer, but often poor education for the learner. But diffi- 
culty in making the arrangement is not great with the demand 
for help that exists in most farming communities. If one good 
farmer will not agree another will. 
It is to be remembered in that form of work that the em- 
ploying farmer is boss, not the teacher. Supervision, then, 
becomes somewhat more difficult than in the case of an enter- 
prise in which the boy is boss. Not much experience of 
teachers in farm employment supervision is yet available. 
But some, at least have by their practice convinced the 
farmer that their supervision results in more intelligent and 
skilful work by the boy for the employer, as indeed it should. 
However, the time always, and the method, often, of per- 
forming farm jobs are in the control of the employer, whether 
they suit the boy or the teacher or not. The fact sets limits 
upon the usefulness of the teaching form, but does not destroy 
its usefulness if the farm and the farmer be well chosen. 
Making of lists of farms studied and approved for employ- 
ment work, as is done in present instances,* seems to be sound 
procedure. Success in the first year means more openings and 
larger opportunities for boys of new entering classes. That 
fact seems fairly proved already. 
Importance of Supervision.—Supervision of home busi- 
ness, enterprises or farm employment is the most vital factor 
in the whole program of vocational education in the farming 
occupations. Supervision is much more than inspection, the 
checking and verification of accomplishment in required work. 
It is more than inspection plus the giving of directions for 
specific tasks in accomplishment. It is farm teaching of the 
* State Schools in New York. °  
-P-A-G-E-223
  
PROVISION FOR TRAVEL 223 
boy as an individual working at a vocation in order that by 
his own self-directed activity he may be modified toward 
increased proficiency in that vocation. Thus planning his 
work for the boy, formulating the steps in productive pro- 
cedure, giving orders that this, that and the other job shall be 
done, plays small part in good supervision. The teacher 
works with the boy as advisor and friend, to enable the boy 
to make his own plans, to formulate the steps of his own pro- 
cedure, to specify the jobs which must be done, to discover the 
needs for and the means to the skills, knowledges and social 
abilities requisite to success in the vocation which he is now 
pursuing. No part of the teacher’s work is more exigent in 
its demands for tact and resourcefulness, none more fully 
necessitates the teaching attitude—a looking at the problem 
with eyes of the boy. 
In present teaching no part of the work is weaker than in 
supervision. The fact is not due only to the lack of standards, 
to the “ greenness ” of teachers in a field wherein formal pro- 
cedures are not evolutionary products but trial and error at- 
tempts, not to lack of tact and resourcefulness—since our 
teachers of agriculture as a group may be rated relatively 
high in those respects—but largely to deficiencies in the 
administrative program. 
Provision for Travel.—Chief of those is the restricted 
allotment of money for expenses in travel. To set aside but 
fifty or one hundred dollars for travel in supervision is ordi- 
narily to penalize the conscientious and effective teacher. If he 
makes as frequent and as prolonged visits to the work of the 
fifteen to twenty-five boys under his charge as good teaching 
requires it means diminution of his salary by a considerable 
sum. The condition is as if the school board should say to the 
teacher of chemistry, “ Here, we will furnish you with a rack 
of test tubes and a gallon of sulphuric acid. If you use any
-P-A-G-E-224
    224 FORMS OF TEACHING 
further apparatus or material, you must furnish it out of your 
own pocket.” Naturally, in most cases the teacher attempts 
to live within the allotment given him for travel. He must cut 
down the mileage of his travel to a definite limit. To do that 
two ways are open: First, to reduce the number of visits per 
boy, in which case his record meets the disapproval of the 
state administrative authorities ; second, to “ take in as many 
boys on a circuit as possible.” Instead of spending a whole 
~ day with two boys, he visits five in the forenoon and six in the 
afternoon, and can report to the state a total five times as large 
as if he pursues the first course. Nine times out of ten the 
teacher will choose the second course, with the result that he 
becomes primarily an inspector of work and formulator of 
directions, rather than friend and advisor working with the 
boy. The best supervision is almost invariably that of the few 
teachers who are allowed unlimited mileage, usually paid by 
the state in order to equalize opportunity, and are then held to 
an accounting for the use of their time. Such teachers do not 
stay abed till ten o’clock three days a week during the summer 
and fiddle away the rest of the day in the village because they 
“cannot afford ” to go out and study farms for future use in 
teaching or visit boys who need their help. Being allowed 
full use of their time for such work and expected to use it, they 
cannot afford inaction if they would hold their jobs or 
win promotion. 
Number and Length of Visits.—No standards can be set 
as to the proper number of visits per boy or the proper length 
of visit in each case. Both will vary with the boy, with the 
home conditions, with the nature of the enterprise, business, 
or employment, and with the season, as well as with the dis- 
tance to be covered in going and coming. The most success- 
ful supervisor of home work whom the writer has known 
turned in a record of eighteen visits of an average duration of
-P-A-G-E-225
  SCHOOL TRADITION 225 
two hours and forty minutes per boy over a season of six 
months. The range in number of visits varied from eight to 
thirty, the range in duration from twenty minutes to two full 
days in succession. That teacher knew his boys, their prob- 
lems, and the limitations under which they worked; he knew 
the parents of those boys, a good many of their problems, 
and some of the limitations under which they worked. He 
was a man undersized, not prepossessing in appearance, some- 
what diffident in manner and shy in speech. But his boys 
swore by him, and the fathers and mothers swore by him. 
The boys agreed that Mr. was a “ corker,” the mothers 
that he had done more for their boys than anyone ever did 
before, the fathers that he had a “ lot of good sense.” But the 
superintendent of schools felt that he spent rather too much 
time away from the school room. 
School Tradition.—The last suggests a factor that still 
operates to the detriment of effective supervision. There is 
a strong tradition, perfectly natural, that teaching is done 
only in schools—that schools are buildings, set apart for a 
special purpose. Not superintendents, principals, and fellow- 
teachers are affected by this tradition only, but also towns- 
people and parents on farms. The teacher of agriculture must 
often start his supervision work in the face of a more or less 
passive opposition, usually on the part of school people, tacit 
under state aid, but among townspeople and parents often 
openly voiced. If persistent he usually wins the parents of 
his boys first, the superintendent next, then his fellow teachers, 
and last of all the townspeople. A strong backing by the 
superintendent is the most effective he can have at the start. 
The superintendent whose attitude is “ Why aren’t you out 
with your boys?” usually gets better teaching than he who 
asks, “ Why are you away from school?” On the whole the 
tradition tends to limit the teacher by restricting his supervis- 
15  
-P-A-G-E-226
  226 FORMS OF TEACHING 
ory visits to the minimum that will meet the approval by 
state officers. 
The criterion for visiting can hardly be more definitely 
formulated than has been done by one successful teacher. “I 
go as often as the boys need me and stay as long as they 
need me.” 
What to Do.—The question, “‘ What to do when you 
make a visit?” was answered in much the same way by 
the same teacher. “I set myself to find out what needs to 
be done in every case and then I do it. There isn’t any rule. 
Sometimes we sit down together and discuss the boy’s prob- 
lems, and then go out to make definite our plans for solving 
them in the field or the hen yard; sometimes we go out first 
to find out what problems we have, and then sit down and 
discuss them ; sometimes we do very little talking and put in all 
our time on the job; sometimes we go together to where 
another boy or farmer has the same kind of proposition to 
see if we can get any suggestions from him or his work; 
sometimes we go to town together to look over tools or 
price feeds and fertilizers or seeds, or something like that. I 
have spent a whole forenoon with a boy hunting out cut 
worms, discussing their life history, and finding the most 
likely places to put poison. As I said, there isn’t any rule.” 
Should the Teacher Work?—There is disagreement 
among teachers as to whether or no it is desirable that they 
should actually work with the boy otherwise than in his think- 
ing and planning. Should the teacher put on overalls and go 
out as a helper? Sometimes unquestionably he should, but 
it can be overdone. The writer visited one teacher who made 
a regular practice of carrying a hoe with him. At the first 
place visited the potato patch was rather foul. The boy ex- 
plained by saying, “I let ’em go till you came out, because I 
knew the two of us could clean ’em up fast enough.” The habit 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
SHOULD THE TEACHER WORK ? 227 
seemed fairly well established among the boys that they were 
expected to work on crops, at least, only when the teacher was 
there to help. Another teacher whose school was on the 
route regularly traversed by visitors from a college “ summer 
conference ” declared that he had put in a week of hard work 
with the hoe and cultivator to “ have things ship shape ” when 
the excursionists arrived. But frequently teachers make their 
visits without taking any actual part in the work of construc- 
tion or production that the boy then has in hand. 
Certainly the work that the teacher does in demonstrating 
or setting a pattern is justified from a teaching standpoint, and 
such work is very often necessary. Some boys are stimulated 
to a sense of the worth and merit of farm work by the fact 
that the teacher whom they respect is not afraid to take hold 
of it. But with other than village boys not truly enlisted as 
yet in the vocational spirit such is a minor factor. With farm 
boys and most of those who are genuinely enlisted for vo- 
cational training “ taking a hand ” at farm work and, particu- 
larly giving evidence of more than ordinary proficiency in it, 
is as a means to winning respect not far below athletic 
prowess. With the parents it counts for more. Lending a 
hand at farm work has put many a teacher “in solid ” with 
the parents of his boys. To make of one’s self a “ free hand” 
for parents in any emergency or to do productive work for the 
boy, by which educationally he might profit better if left to do 
it himself, is objectionable and a misuse of the time for which 
the community pays the teacher. But there are many instances 
in which the teacher can become a manual helper with profit 
to his teaching. In laying off a garden, lining up a corn or 
potato planting, spraying trees, there is no reason that the 
teacher should stand by as an onlooker. His counsel and 
suggestions are quite as effective with a stake and line in his 
hands or a hand on the pump-handle, as with his hands in his
-P-A-G-E-228
    
228 FORMS OF TEACHING 
pockets, the work moves with enough more vim and speed to 
increase the range of helpful suggestions in a given time and 
the whole setting of the teaching situation becomes more ap- 
propriate from the vocational viewpoint. So frequent are 
the occasions on which it will be worth while for the teacher 
to get his hands or his clothes dirty that preparation should 
regularly be made for them. The teacher who goes in his 
working clothes is not necessarily the better teacher, but the 
teacher who hasn’t with him overalls or clothing fit for work 
on the farm is at a disadvantage. 
Records.—The little pad like that of the grocer, upon 
which, with a carbon, two copies of notes may be made, is use- 
ful. If, out of the work and discussion which boy and teacher 
carry on together, can be formulated definite suggestions as 
to the conduct of the work, memoranda or details to be looked 
into, supplies to be obtained, etc., duplicate notes of them are 
useful to the boy in his work alone, to the teacher in keeping 
track of accomplishment and in maintaining continuity in his 
teaching as a visitor. One objection exists to the pad record. 
It tends to strengthen in his habits the teacher who is inspector 
chiefly. The presence of it in his pocket demands its use, and 
he writes down “ criticisms ” and “ directions ” when criti- 
cisms are not needed and directions are out of place. One 
teacher of this sort said to the writer, “I don’t care if the boy 
is absent when I come. I just trot out and look over the 
* project,’ make a note of what is wrong and what I want him 
to get done before I come round again, and leave it at the 
house for him. I can save a good deal of time that way, and 
he knows what to do just as well as if I told him twice.” 
Schedule of Visits.—A regular schedule is maintained by 
many teachers, and the boys know the days and hours at 
which they will receive a visit. The plan is, on the whole, a 
good one. That the boy should know when the teacher is
-P-A-G-E-229
  OTHER GROUP WORK 229 
coming and be obligated to meet him at that time can hardly 
be disputed. Buta rigid schedule, without regard to seasonal 
differences is not wise, nor one inflexible in number and 
duration of visits per boy. As has been indicated, the varia- 
tions in needs for supervision among individual boys is very 
considerable. Careful planning, however, a reasonable time 
in advance, with notification of pupils as to time of visits, 
is a necessary factor to good use of teaching time. 
Coéperative Businesses and Enterprises and Other 
Group Work.—Authorities in some states are encouraging 
the formation of clubs or associations among students learn- 
ing the farming vocations, as a means to developing social 
abilities in leadership and followership such as promise to be 
of great importance in many of the vocations of agriculture. 
Good seed clubs, pure-bred stock associations, exhibitors’ 
associations, poultry associations, codperative buying and sell- 
ing associations, patterned after the model of successful adult 
societies are growing in number. Under any form such asso- 
ciations undoubtedly have educative value apart from any 
vocational considerations. When they have genuine voca- 
tional objectives, not vague and general but clear and specific 
for the group, they may be very useful in educating to the 
attitudes that make for successful codperation. 
One such association found among the boys of a school in 
the potato growing region of northern Maine has received 
much publicity and may serve as an example of the best work 
that is being done in the field. The object of the association is 
the production and sale of high class seed potatoes. Every 
member must meet the requirements of the association in the 
selection of “seed,” its treatment, culture and protection by 
spraying. Harvest, grading, storage, sale and shipment are 
matters of associational control, since the product is sent out 
under the brand of the association and not that of individuals.
-P-A-G-E-230
230 FORMS OF TEACHING 
In all respects it seems to be patterned after the best of the 
adult associations, even to the choice of the most competent, 
presumably, of its membership as managing director and sales 
agent. The agent is the teacher of agriculture, and he appears 
to be, as a managing director should be, the master spirit in the 
association, to whom much of its success has been due. 
From a strictly vocational standpoint the association seems, 
from the reports of it, perfect. It is the part of wisdom that 
a marketing association should choose a competent expert for 
directing the sale of its product. Yet, somehow it seems that 
an opportunity has been lost, from the educative standpoint, 
by the retention of managerial control in the hands of the 
teacher-expert during the three years of the existence of the 
association. In adult associations it may often happen that a 
grower member may economically serve as managing director. 
Indeed the starting of an association may depend largely upon 
the existence among growers of managerial directive ability, 
even if in ultimate development the association come to em- 
ployment of the full-time expert who is not a producing 
farmer. Now, if among the boys of the association there 
exists capacity for developing such ability as is demanded of 
the grower-director it would seem that an educative program 
should provide means to the discovery and realization of that 
latent ability. Without much loss from the vocational stand- 
point, if the teacher retained his normal position of counsellor 
and adviser, the boys of the association might be given trial, 
turn and turn about, in the position of manager. Those who 
showed capacity could be given, perhaps, a full season’s 
responsibility for the sake of developing ability useful to them- 
selves and their fellows, and the association would become 
one of boys managing a codperative business of their own 
through an agent of their own group. Perhaps, the plan is 
unworkable. If retention were required by the teacher,
-P-A-G-E-231
  
OTHER GROUP WORK 231 
initiative and control would be taken out of the hands of the 
association in respect to choice of manager, but if the plan 
were presented as an opportunity for education without neces- 
sary loss of efficiency in marketing, that boys would reject it 
is not at all certain. It would seem desirable that a boy’s 
association should, like an adult association, do for itself what 
it is capable of doing rather than to call upon the teacher to 
assume the responsibility. 
Clubs and associations, however, are not per se codper- 
ative. Poultry clubs, exhibitors’ clubs and pure-bred stock 
clubs are often competitive rather than codperative. Compe- 
tition between clubs may lead to codperation in the single club 
group, but competition between members of a club accentu- 
ates individual objectives as against contributory interde- 
pendence. Competition in egg production, in acre yield, in 
area return, in prize winning, furnishes a strong motive, in the 
latter case, too, one that may be a real element in the work of 
the live-stock grower, poultry fancier, or seedsman, if infre- 
quent in most of the farming vocations. But the competitive 
motive is somewhat antagonistic to the attitude of codperation, 
is often inappropriate and artificial so far as the vocational 
situation is concerned, and should be used intelligently or not 
at all. The teacher who depends upon prizes and competitive 
rivalry under the name of codperation is deceived and con- 
fesses a weakness in his teaching. The facts of individual 
differences in capacity as well as in acquired abilities and 
home opportunities make competition of doubtful value as a 
motive: For the majority must fail, and failure is a poor 
underpinning for the structure of success. 
At planting and at harvest, and sometimes in between, 
come opportunities for group work, that afford experience of 
employment and of management, worthy of use. A boy has 
a thousand tomato plants to set out, an acre of onions to weed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
    232 FORMS OF TEACHING 
a half acre of berries ripening off, potatoes to dig or corn to 
cut for tomorrow when the chopper and blower are set up 
for a day. Such are the times at which the farmer takes on 
extra help if he can get it, and becomes boss of a gang. 
Neighbors get together for silo filling, sometimes for haying, 
crop setting, threshing, etc., and turn about, make circuit of 
the neighborhood, bosses at home, but helpers elsewhere. If 
a group of boys have like businesses or enterprises such 
codperation among them may be economical and a good oppor- 
tunity for developing abilities in dealing with persons and the 
neighborly attitude. Some teachers already make a practice 
of that sort of thing and report a by-product of interest in 
what the other fellow is doing that is pleasing. But caution 
must be used not to destroy the vocational situation 
upon which good teaching depends. To bring in a dozen boys 
for work that three may do more effectively, and to assume 
as teacher the place of boss in every case are weaknesses which 
the writer has noted. 
In codperative teaching the first requirement is a definite 
group purpose leading to a division in numbers and individual 
function appropriate to the accomplishment of that purpose. 
Otherwise there is not codperation but merely association, 
and association in field work or in a club is no more a guaran- 
tee of the sense of interdependence and fellowship for a 
common purpose, than it is in the algebra classroom where 
thirty pupils three feet apart, work in as complete isolation at 
their individual tasks as they do in their bedrooms at home. 
There is company, but no codperation.

CHAPTER XIV 
FORMS OF TEACHING IN VOCATIONAL 
AGRICULTURE 
DIRECTED FARM STUDIES 
Tue business undertaking and the productive enterprise 
serve as vocational problem centres or individual vocational 
interest cores out of which develop the needs of pupils for 
skills, knowledges, social abilities, which shall constitute the 
“ subject matter ” of their learning. Those forms give motive 
to data of meanings significant in the social aspects of vocation 
and undoubtedly, too, to data of meanings not instrumental 
to social service through vocation, but intrinsically satisfying 
to instincts such as curiosity, intellectual activity, manipulative 
control, to emotional impulses, and to established or growing 
habits, attitudes, and ideals not in themselves contributory to 
vocation other than in its psychological aspect. The same 
forms provide opportunity, also, for initiative in the acquire- 
ment of data of meanings, evaluation and growth of such data 
into new meanings, and organization of selected data to 
accomplishment and still further growth of meanings, that is, 
for “the continuous reconstruction of experience” into new 
forms of experience significant, as instrumental to vocational 
service, and to vocational insight and appreciation. But sel- 
dom, if ever, can the scope of business undertakings or 
productive enterprises be sufficient to provide for acquirement 
of all those data to the need for which they give origin. Thus 
comes necessity for provision of wider access to vocational 
experience among things, men, and books—to study in the 
233
-P-A-G-E-234
  234 FORMS OF TEACHING 
larger sense. Ina limited way the same is true of the form of 
farm employment. In the range of opportunity for learning 
it may not be quantitatively inferior to the preferred forms, 
but in quality of motivation or creation of needs it is almost 
inevitably inferior. In no case, probably, can employment on 
a single farm furnish opportunity for all the experiences that 
are socially desirable in vocation, or that the boy of normal 
capacity grows to feel the need of. Accordingly out of the 
third form, as well as of the first and second forms of directed 
farm work grows the need for study. 
Degrees of Experience.—It is recognized, of course, that 
all study which eventuates in modification of the learner is 
active experience on his part, whether it be in the purchase and 
planting of his own seed corn or in reading concerning the 
experience of an Austrian monk of a century gone in the 
breeding of peas. Nevertheless, it is worth while to think of 
studies as varying in the degrees of immediacy or vicarious- 
ness. To read of a battle is to have an experience; to hear the 
tale of a veteran, perhaps, to have a more vivid experience ; to 
see a moving picture of a battle to have one still more vivid; 
to witness a battle to have one greatly vivid. But, after all, 
such experiences consist in “sharing” the experience of 
others through varying degrees of participation, and are by no 
means of the “ vital effectiveness ” of fighting ina battle. The 
series indicates a range from the remotely vicarious to the 
immediate; which is probably normal for human beings, if 
far from certain in any individual case. According to the 
degree of “ reality ” which an experience has it is likely to be 
effective in learning. 
Maximum Participation.—In a general way, the fact 
that a “maximum participation” is desirable in all cases where 
the value of an experience is sufficient to justify the pains 
necessary to provide it is recognized by educators and many
-P-A-G-E-235
  
PLACE OF FARM STUDIES 235 
teachers. Teachers of agriculture are well agreed in prac- 
tice that the judging of cattle is better taught by the 
procedure first stated than by the following one in this series: 
(1) judging “ rings ” of living cattle in the barnyard, or show 
ring ; (2) watching another judge and hearing him explain his 
placings of cattle; (3) judging cattle by pictures shown of 
them; (4) hearing an illustrated lecture on cattle judging; 
(5) reading a well illustrated book on cattle judging; 
(6) reading a score card with the explanatory. comments 
thereon. Most of them recognize, too, the fact that pupils 
who have had an antecedent experience profit to a greater 
degree by the more vicarious succeeding experience, if it be 
given, than those who have not. But judging, pruning, graft- 
ing, are still taught from books, though cattle, poultry, and 
other animals be available within half a mile of the school, 
when fruit trees are in sight from the windows, Such, 
fortunately, is coming to be the exceptional case with the 
particular activities cited above. But it is by no means the 
exception that farm buildings, farm layout, farm soils, farm 
crops, farm markets, etc., are taught wholly in the classroom, 
though farms and markets are close at hand. The theory 
which has led teachers to real use of farms in teaching judg- 
ing, pruning, spraying, and the like (if sometimes to an over- 
emphasis of those), yet has to be carried over into the giving 
of many experiences now “given” by chart, blackboard, 
lecture, and recitation froma text. Progress toward “ object- 
ive teaching” as it is sometimes misnamed, is encouraging, 
but needs much further development than the “home 
project ” has yet given it. In vocation “ to know the thing ” 
is usually more valuable than to “ know about the thing” and 
“to know it and know about it ” more valuable than either. 
Place of Farm Studies.—In point of “ reality” of ex- 
perience, directed farm studies, whether of the “ survey” or 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  236 FORMS OF TEACHING 
of the “ practicum” type, stand second only to the directed 
farm work forms of teaching. They offer means to the acquire- 
ment of data not available on the home farm; of standards in 
construction, management, layout, engineering, methods, 
stock, equipment, and so on, that can never be developed 
within the restricted scope of the directed farm work. They 
offer variant combinations of objective elements for com- 
parison and contrast, favorable to the abstraction and clarifi- 
cation of “principles.” They afford genuine settings for 
the development of skills that cannot be developed in the home 
farm setting. Further they tend to establish that invaluable 
attitude of mind which looks to men and things, and not to 
books only, for ‘‘ information” and satisfaction of needs. 
From the standpoint of the teacher, also, there are two 
factors in the method of farm study which make it of great 
significance. First, the increased basis of relatively definite 
meanings upon which may rest, by reference, the “ word 
teaching” of the classroom and the book. Second, that the 
teacher may know with reasonable certainty some of the 
experiences common to all the class, since all of them have 
visited a given barn, a given market, or a given orchard, have 
used the same or like implements, performed the same job 
process. A “known apperceptive basis ” in-the class when a 
certain question is to be discussed, a problem to be formu- 
lated, a principle, a “ fact,” or a skill to be developed, is an 
asset to good teaching second to none. Most of the failures 
in teaching are due to assumption of experiences which pupils 
have never had, or to the overlooking of experience which they 
have had. With the known experience of like businesses or 
enterprises and their complements in farm studies the teacher 
has a firm foundation upon which to build. 
Farm studies may in general be classified as of two sorts: 
(1) farm surveys, (2) farm practicums. Neither is limited
-P-A-G-E-237
  SURVEYS 237 
strictly to farms, but may be extended to include the physical 
and economic resources of the community or region acces- 
sible to the school which bear upon the problems of the par- 
ticular agricultural vocation taught. Thus studies of local 
market opportunities may be included under group 1; prac- 
tice in candling and grading eggs, judging by-product feeds, 
setting up machinery, etc, in a local warehouse under 
group 2. In general the aims in group 1 have to do with 
acquirement of meanings, and its method is observation; in 
group 2 the acquirement of skill, and its method, practice. 
Surveys.—The first requirement in the making of a sur- 
vey is the establishment of a definite aim on the part of the 
teacher and the organization under that aim of the data which 
he thinks necessary to its accomplishment. The second is a 
careful preliminary study of the resources, farms, farmers, 
market, or other which are available to him in order to amend- 
ment or emendation of his plan. To this end a formulated topic 
outline is very useful. Examples are furnished in the follow- 
ing series of outlines in the teaching of dairy farming for

Use of Surveys.—Such outlines are for use by the teacher 
and not by the pupils, except it be in the case of class sum- 
marization after the survey has been completed and its results 
discussed and tentatively organized by the class. The formula- 
tion used by pupils in conducting the work should grow out 
of preliminary discussion with the class. For to prove of most 
value the survey should be a means to the accomplishment 
of an end or ends specifically worth while to the individual 
pupils themselves. That is, for the pupils the survey must be 
motivated, either directly as a genuine problem in itself for 
them individually, or indirectly, as a means to the securing 
of experience useful in solving problems that they are 
already facing. 
The first is, probably, the ideal to be sought, since out of a 
common felt need can be developed by individual contribu- 
tions a program of attack that is truly significant from the 
point of view of the class, whether or not it conform closely 
to the outline plan of the teacher in the face of the problem as 
he sees it. But such an ideal can rarely be approximated, even 
under the favorable conditions wherein every member of the 
class is engaged in a like business or productive enterprise for 
the year. Yet it is not difficult under those circumstances to 
discover in discussion demands for data, for standards, for 
skills, directly contributory to the solution of problems that 
engage the attention of individuals, for the acquirement of 
which the survey offers means. Under the class program of 
the year those individual needs will not be so far remote 
from one another as to become utterly academic if assembled 
in the program of a survey. Thus a plan can be developed by 
contribution of questions from individuals for which they 
feel the need of an answer. Such questions will suggest 
others, and with the guidance of the teacher they can be formu- 
lated into a plan under a general class aim, Under No. 3, for
-P-A-G-E-249
USE OF SURVEYS 249 
example, suppose pupil 1.is doubtful that he is getting the best 
return for his four and a half per cent. milk; pupil 2 is un- 
certain whether to breed for a fall calf or a spring calf; pupil 
3 has plenty of pasture but faces the fact that wholesale milk 
is down in the summer ; pupil 4 finds that the job of delivering 
twenty quarts of milk to a dozen customers uses up more time 
than he likes to give; pupil 5 is about to buy a new cow and 
is wavering between choice of a grade Jersey and a grade 
Holstein; pupil 6 can buy a second-hand separator at a bar- 
gain, but his father advises against it; pupil 7 has a pure-bred 
calf, but finds he cannot send his daily can of milk to the ship- 
ping station, if he is going to raise that calf; pupil 8 has been 
advised that the milk business has no more room in this town, 
etc. That a survey of the market resources of the com- 
munity would be of identical purport to each of them is ob- 
viously unlikely ; that it would seem a reasonable and justifiable 
undertaking to each of them is pretty nearly as obvious. Now 
if the teacher can discover in his pupils a range of like, or even 
somewhat unlike problems, all pointing in their demands 
toward the use of local resources, surveys can be made 
much more nearly true class problems than mere aca- 
demic tasks. 
The general objective being established and the specific 
questions to be answered ordered in their relation to it, one 
more step needs to be taken before field work is put under 
way. In general, the data of experience to be obtained from 
surveys has two sources: (1) the farm itself, stock, buildings, 
fields, etc., or store, warehouses, elevator, machinery, stock in 
hand, etc., and (2) the farmer, operator, merchant or other 
persons concerned with the physical resources. Which of 
those sources shall be used in finding the answer to each ques- 
tion should be discovered and agreed upon tentatively in 
advance of the survey.  
-P-A-G-E-250
  250 FORMS OF TEACHING 
In respect to the use of sources the teaching survey differs 
from the farm management survey to which the teacher may 
have been accustomed in his college training. The surveyor in 
farm management is after information. His source is the 
farmer. A man could, conceivably, make a reasonably accu- 
rate survey of a farm region, which he had never seen in the 
daylight, by calling upon farmers after dark, when their day’s 
work is over ; or, by questioning farmers as from time to time 
they visited the farm bureau office in town; he might “ sur- 
vey ”’ several townships in the course of a year or two without 
leaving town. In nowise would his results be invalidated by 
such procedure. But with the teaching survey the greater 
value must be lost by confining attention to the farmer. It is 
less an imposition on the farmer and a vast gain to the teaching 
if the rule be adopted that the farm shall be used first to the 
full extent that it is a possible and reasonably economical 
source of data. The farmer or operator shall be used only 
in verification and supplementation of data obtained from the 
farm. For example, the number and breed or breed-grade of 
cattle, and other stock, the topography, soil, exposure, layout, 
material, construction of buildings, for the most part the crops 
grown, their soils adaptation, even the rotation and the propor- 
tions in the scheme of each crop, are to be obtained by study 
of the farm. The farmer may verify the judgment that the 
cattle are pure-breds, not high grades, that the rotation is as 
it appears, that the buildings have a certain storage space for 
hay, the silo a certain capacity, etc. ; and he must be the source 
of information as to whether cattle are registered, what their 
yield of milk may be, the reasons for choice of breed, propor- 
tionate sources of income, yields of crops, cost of buildings 
and machinery, prices received for milk and the like. Both 
material things and men should be used, but the easily estab- 
lished habit of quizzing a good natured man to supply infor-
-P-A-G-E-251
  USE OF SURVEYS 251 
mation that can with more profit to the learner—if by more 
expenditure of effort—be obtained from the farm, should be 
avoided by all means. Even, perhaps, a formal agreement 
should be made by class and teacher that none shall appeal to 
the farmer until he has exhausted his resources in observation 
of the farm. 
In the early surveys of the year, at least, and in every new 
survey in which a novel procedure is necessary, the teacher 
should go with the whole class, or sometimes preferably a 
division of the class, to a farm or market and demonstrate the 
economical method of study and acquirement of data. In that 
connection it is wise to bear in mind that several visits by 
pupils to any given farm for the study of relatively few 
items per visit is much more likely to prove effective than is 
the effort to “ stuff.” If the class attempts to learn all that is 
to be learned, for instance, concerning size, materials, cost, 
layout, accessibility, lighting, ventilation, equipment, etc., of 
the dairy farm buildings at a single visit, scattering of atten- 
tion, dispersal of interest, confusion in results is almost cer- 
tain. If time is so limited that complete survey is not possible 
through a series of visits, it is better that the survey be reduced 
and the other one or two visits confined to specific and limited 
phases. The chief objection to frequent visits may be elim- 
inated by confining the questioning of the farmer to the final 
visit. Otherwise the welcome of students may soon be worn 
out. As visitors quietly attending to their affairs in observa- 
tion of farm objects and farm processes, few men will object 
to survey groups, but almost any busy man will revolt against 
“pestering” with repeated questions of the same tenor 
during a series of days or weeks. Those facts can be taught in 
discussion preliminary and in the teacher’s own demonstration 
of procedure. 
A specific problem in each case, and a known plan and 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  252 FORMS OF TEACHING 
method of procedure will largely offset the “ discipline ” neces- 
sary to the successful carrying out of a survey study. Never- 
theless the large group on a field trip presents a difficult 
problem in management for the teacher, particularly the 
novice. The play and “rough house” spirit easily develops, 
and attention is easily diverted from the project in hand. 
Further the large group is in itself a disturbing factor in the 
barn, garden, greenhouse, or warehouse. Small groups work- 
ing under a common problem assignment, each individual of 
which has a definite responsibility for personal contribution 
to the sum of data, makes a much better working arrangement. 
After the demonstration study the class can be divided into 
groups of three or four to gather the data required. A system 
of rotation from farm to farm, whereby all members of the 
class are at work at the same time will preserve the schedule 
possible under a single grouping, with the advantages of small 
divisions from the angle of study, “ discipline,” and welcome 
at the farm. 
When the scope of the particular day’s work is limited and 
definitely significant for the individual student there is little 
tendency for him to depend upon another for a record of 
observations or judgments. But in any class problem there 
are inevitably parts which to the several members are quite 
unequal in relative importance. Thus at any time there are 
likely to be some boys who look upon the particular day’s 
assignment or parts of it as a school task merely, wherein the 
end to be achieved is satisfaction of the teacher. Ifa standard 
list of questions be used the end set is the filling out of writ- 
ten answers on the sheet. Thus, conceivably, a group of four 
boys sent out for certain data might delegate one of their mem- 
bers to “go and get the stuff,” while the others loafed or 
played. All could, then, by copying, with appropriate juggling 
in the forms of reply, “ get by” on the report. Those familiar 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  CONSIDER THE RIGHTS OF THE FARMER 253 
with routine laboratory work and field work in other “ sub- 
jects” know how frequently that sort of thing may occur. 
But the tendency can be checked and discouraged by the 
proper use of survey material in organization and summar- 
ization in the classroom. There those who have not seen and 
done for themselves are soon discovered. If made to “ go it 
alone” in “ make-up ” of their deficiencies, and in a subse- 
quent study or two, they can usually be depended upon to 
reform their practices. In an ideally motivated study 
no such trouble would occur, but studies cannot always be 
ideally motivated. 
Consider the Rights of the Farmer.—A further difficulty 
sometimes to be met is a lack of consideration of the rights 
of farmers. Boys are admitted to the handling and exam- 
ination of animals, tools, equipment, which are the property 
of a tolerant or friendly outsider, and which are not held for 
the purposes of teaching, but for economic or other purposes. 
Animals are easily upset by careless handling, abrupt move- 
ments, loud noises, tools are easily dulled, rusted, misplaced, 
fences and gates broken down when too many mount them 
at once, loosely stirred soil compacted by repeated travelling 
of the same path, and soon. No visit of a group should result 
in decrease of yield, expense or damage of any sort, or extra 
labor for the farmer who has granted a privilege and an 
opportunity. A careful understanding of the fact and the 
establishment of the proper attitude will go far to prevent 
difficulty. Mischief and accident are more easily made matters 
of individual accountability in the small group than in the large. 
But policing is to be avoided. Most boys profit by the assump- 
tion of responsibility for their behavior and can be trusted to 
live up to it. On the whole the difficulty is probably a 
minor one.
-P-A-G-E-254
    254 FORMS OF TEACHING 
Range of Resources.—The number of warehouses, 
plants, elevators, and organized market agencies accessible to 
most schools wherein vocational agriculture may profitably be 
taught is probably small. On the other hand, it is not to be 
concluded that the number of farms accessible is unlimited. 
Certainly it should be seldom necessary to restrict farm sur- 
veys to those farms which are within easy walking distance of 
the school. If the town in which the school is located is of fair 
size those nearby farms are likely to be somewhat exceptional 
in their characteristics because of the opportunities for retail 
marketing of special products. But a range of fifty to one 
hundred farms ordinarily represents a considerable territory, 
one within which, even though the teacher and a boy or two 
possess touring cars, most of the survey work must be done. 
That is a range, however, in which representative situations 
may ordinarily be found, and it enables the teacher to teach 
something of farming as it is, not just as he or some authority 
in agriculture thinks it ought to be. Selection is desirable, 
too, within the field, but selection should rarely be confined to 
a single farm. Probably no class should be expected to cover 
the entire range of accessible farms. In the cross-section sur- 
veys the number must be sufficient to represent a true cross- 
section, perhaps seldom less than twenty farms, but in the 
more intensive surveys a half dozen representative farms may 
serve quite as well as a larger number. In the cross-section 
surveys work may be divided among groups sent to study a 
certain number of the total chosen; in the more intensive sur- 
veys it is probably better that every group should cover the 
same range of selected farms. But it should be the aim of 
the teacher to secure cumulative records of the entire region 
accessible to his school. That can be accomplished by varying 
the selection from year to year to include some new farms. 
Such cumulative records should be of great value to the
-P-A-G-E-255
  
AGRICULTURAL FAIRS 255 
teacher or his successor, and to administrative officers in 
enabling an increasingly intelligent use of the teaching re- 
sources of the community and a more and more close adapta- 
tion of content and methods to the needs of boys drawn 
from that community. One further addition to the means of 
accumulation, valuable also to the student, is an individual 
assignment to a particular farm, preferably the home farm 
if it be not atypical, that he may come to know thoroughly its 
methods and standards throughout the entire period of the 
course. If each boy becomes a responsible authority upon a 
single farm the basis for comparison and contrast in class dis- 
cussion is very much extended. 
It would seem obvious that in order to make the most of 
the survey it must be used, not in observation and field study 
merely, but in terms of the data and results obtained. It 
furnishes a basis for organization in discussion and in mean- 
ingful reading that can hardly be surpassed, and is a direct 
instrument to effective class work. Unfortunately the history 
of survey work in other fields shows that the obvious is often 
overlooked. With the conclusion of the field trips and the 
formulation of acceptable records of it, the survey is “ done,” 
the records are filed away and left to an “innocuous desue- 
tude.” The survey becomes an end in itself, and not a means. 
For that reason the use of the survey is here emphasized. 
Let the teacher not fall into the easy habit of holding that his 
work is done when the last record is in. 
Agricultural Fairs.—Agricultural fairs may be counted 
among the resources available to schools for observation and 
practice. In live stock, machinery, equipment, and in the 
product aspect of variety in fruit and vegetables they offer 
means to study, particularly for the acquirement of material 
or physical standards. They are not so selective in terms of 
usable farm values as are farms themselves, but present in
-P-A-G-E-256
256 FORMS OF TEACHING 
convenient assembly objects worthy of acquaintance or even 
of detailed study by prospective farmers. The very wealth of 
offerings to attract attention is one of the draw-backs to their 
use as a teaching resource. The teacher who has gone with 
his boys to “ take in everything ” at the fair is commonly dis- 
appointed to find how little they seem to have “taken in” that 
seemed to him worth while. 
Much more effective is a discriminative use of the fair. 
The teacher should know in advance what he desires to accom- 
plish, what particular sources he can use, and how he intends 
touse them. That means, ordinarily, not a study of announce- 
ments and acquaintance with the fair grounds only, but a 
preliminary visit to the fair at its opening. In turn the boys 
should know what they should study, in a measure how they 
are to study it, and above all why. Curiosity is a motive 
much drawn upon in the usual agricultural fair, if not par- 
ticularly in the field of agricultural exhibits. Legitimately, it 
may be used by the teacher, though often it will be found to 
be working against him. A motive derived of the vocational 
interest tends much more strongly to make the bond between 
fair experience and vocational use a strong one. For example, 
boys at the beginning of the school year—a time at which fairs 
are usually held—are planning their enterprises or businesses, 
selecting varieties of fruits or vegetables, or breeds of poultry, 
or swine, sheep, cattle, or meeting problems of housing and 
equipment, or of harvest and storage. A motive to study of ( 
particular varieties, of the characteristics of particular breeds, 
of poultry or hog houses, of feeding and watering devices, of 
machines, tools and storage means, is not hard to arouse. 
If the study be limited to the crops, animals, or equipment 
appropriate to the needs of boys and classes, the fair may 
prove a very effective means of teaching. Careful selection 
and concentration of effort will pay. But concentration of
-P-A-G-E-257
  
PRACTICUMS AND OBSERVATION TRIPS 257 
effort must not be too prolonged. To attempt the restriction 
of boys to the study of poultry feeding devices, of Guernsey 
cattle, or of Rhode Island Red poultry for a whole day is a 
mistake. More can be accomplished by working with them 
an hour or two, and then, if the day is given to the fair, turn- 
ing them loose to enjoy themselves as other spectators do. 
One phase of work at fairs may furnish a genuine voca- 
tional experience in some types of agricultural vocations, 
namely in the showing of poultry, hogs, sheep, cattle or crop 
products, by pupils as competing farmers. Exhibit of school 
work of records and accounts, of photographs of boys’ work, 
of shop work products, of charts of yield, etc., may be good 
advertising, but is not vocational experience for boys, nor 
particularly significant to them from the vocational viewpoint. 
Practicums and Observation Trips.—Many exercises 
for the acquirement of skills, or for the derivation of useful 
meanings, or for the verification of conclusions are listed in 
the “laboratory manuals” and are commonly considered by 
teachers as “laboratory work.” There is no serious objection 
to such a classification. The name is of minor importance so 
long as the aims of the work are clear and the teaching well 
done. But in the classification of forms of teaching herein 
used “laboratory work ” stands for work done in the labora- 
tory or on the school plot with materials or equipment selected 
for school purposes. Exercises or “ problems” of the sort 
mentioned which are conducted most appropriately on farms, 
or apart from the school building and equipment are here con- 
sidered as farm studies of the second group—or practicums. 
They fall again under the general category of “ field work” 
commonly understood by teachers. Examples are: Judging 
of live stock, soil sampling and survey, field selection of crops, 
comparison of plant varieties, vegetation distribution in rela- 
tion to soils or drainage or topography, using machinery and 
Ly:  
-P-A-G-E-258
  258 FORMS OF TEACHING 
tools, spraying, pruning, grading, packing, culling poultry, 
grafting, harvesting of crops, stacking, silo filling, and for 
some boys driving, harnessing, plowing, cultivating, mowing, 
etc. Repair and construction work, also, belong in the practi- 
cum group, but because of their intimate relation with shop 
work will be considered under that heading. In general, prac- 
ticums and field trips will serve to purposes of teaching or of 
“ checking ” upon proficiency in skill or understanding other- 
wise acquired. 
Judging.—Judging of live stock, particularly of dairy 
cattle, is probably the most frequent of farm practicums now 
used in schools. It makes a “ practical appeal” in the com- 
munity which is of some advertising value and of worth in 
securing an attitude favorable to vocational teaching, it is 
encouraged by prizes, publicity and recognition given to suc- 
cessful judging teams or to boys entering public competitions ; 
it gives to boys a sense of adult competency, even of distinc- 
tion in an activity commonly regarded as that of the adult 
expert. Often the large proportion of time that a teacher 
gives to “ taking his boys on judging trips ” and his success in 
winning awards through his boys, is pointed to as an index of 
the genuinely “practical” nature of the work he is doing. That 
it is not by any means always an index of the sort, even that it 
is in many cases quite overdone, is the writer’s present opinion. 
That ability to select seeds, varieties, plants and animals 
of one or several sorts is an important factor in most of the 
farming vocations is to be conceded without question. In the 
case of crops it is fairly clear that ability to select and ability 
to “judge” are by no means identical—even that ability to 
judge by score or by comparison in the case of corn, tomatoes, 
apples, dahlia plants, is only a minor factor in the complex of 
selecting productive and adapted varieties, strains, or vigor- 
ous seed, plants, cions, or tubers of those crops. On the other
-P-A-G-E-259
JUDGING 259 
hand judging of live stock and poultry may appear to be of a 
different order. Judging of animals has to do with establish- 
ing of standards of “ individual merit” by which selection in 
terms of utility in the individual animal may be determined. 
For the purchaser of mature grade dairy cows, for the buyer 
of five months’ pullets in the open market, where such exists, 
for the buyer of work-horse or mule, the standards of indi- 
vidual merit are first and sole in selection. The fat barrow, 
the fat steer, the fat fowl, are judged and valued by a buyer 
not a farmer, to whom skill in judging is of much importance, 
but all that the grower needs know is that the animal approxi- 
mates a condition in which he may readily be marketed. No 
skill in point scoring or ring placing is there required. In the 
case of the breeder of pure-bred cattle, horses, sheep, swine, 
or poultry, ability to judge of individual merit, particularly 
of type, as correlate with the factor of heredity makes judging 
of mature farm animals important. But in general, with 
cattle at least, both dairy and beef, ability to judge of the 
promise of young stock, calves, heifers, feeders, is much more 
important than ability in judging the mature milch cow or fat 
steer. With pure-breds chosen for breeding purposes such 
skill is a decided economic asset. 
To go into a flock or herd and pick out the best pro- 
ducer, the second best, the lowest producer by judging 
methods is rarely possible, for the correlation of external 
characteristics with productive utility is by no means perfect 
so far as indices now used are concerned. But it is close 
enough to make the acquirement of usable type standards pos- 
sible. For the judge of herd or flock to group those which 
are good producers and those which are poor is about 
as much as can be done in the present state of knowledge. 
Certainly such represents a degree of skill as high as the 
teacher can reasonably expect to develop in his pupils, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  
  260 FORMS OF TEACHING 
as high as is likely to be required in most farming vocations. 
The training of ring judges for fairs is hardly a purpose of 
the secondary vocational course. 
The methods of the skilled judge in the ring are based upon 
‘the use of standards already acquired and matured. The 
teacher who, with learners, adopts the methods of the ring 
judge in teaching, is assuming possession of the very standards 
which it is the purpose of his teaching to develop. The not 
infrequent beginning of teachers with an exercise in scoring 
one or several animals or birds is for the same reason largely 
futile. Only the most skilled of judges, who has clear and 
vivid standards of perfection in mind, can make effective use 
of the score card in assigning points. Ring judges do not use 
it. Comparative judging takes the place of scoring and 
emphasis comes more and more to be placed upon characters 
most definitely associated with utility. 
Comparative judging, however, has a high place as a 
method of teaching ; and the score card, too,ause. In judging 
utility stock, which will concern more farmers than judging 
the show type until the two types come together—whether in 
poultry or cattle—the following is a good general procedure: 
With the help of a good poultryman or dairyman who knows 
the yield record of his birds or animals, secure the setting 
apart of three or four each of the highest and lowest 
producers. Let the owner, if he will, tell the boys something 
of the history and records of the respective groups; if he can- 
not be present the teacher should make clear the facts of dif- 
fering utility. Then selecting a major index character or 
possibly two, such as depth in the fowl, or udder, udder and 
milk veins in the cow, devote attention wholly to comparison 
and contrast of those characters in the two groups selected for 
study. Thus the pupils will locate, name and gain a working 
standard of that particular character. On the next trip let 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
JUDGING 261 
the pupils place the animals, or other animals selected in the 
same way, with respect to merit in the characteristic previously 
studied. Then take up the next closely related major char- 
acter for comparison and contrast. On the third occasion let 
the class place the animals on the basis of merit in the two 
characters previously studied, and add a third by comparison 
and contrast. When the characters of significance have thus 
been covered it may be well to bring in the score card for 
grouping and relative weights assigned by authorities. There- 
after until the desired degree of skill is acquired let animals 
be judged as wholes and the placings defended on the basis of 
the score card. 
Unfortunately skill in judging immature animals, which 
would function frequently and directly in many farming voca- 
tions, has not been developed to a definite technic and seldom 
is a part of the equipment of the teacher of agriculture. Only 
mature and experienced farmers unusually observant in noting 
the character modifications of animals in growth to maturity 
have the basis for judgment in that field. With horses, beef 
cattle, hogs and sheep, there is probably less deficiency than 
with dairy cattle and poultry. 
Judging mature bulls by comparison and contrast is seldom 
possible in the secondary school course. The fair offers 
opportunity for observation of judging at any rate, and should 
be made the most of, particularly as those animals approxi- 
mating the ideal type may set a standard by which study of 
single individuals on farms may be made more effective. Fam- 
ily record, however, is so much more significant than great 
perfection in individual merit among bulls that refined skill in 
judging them is not often demanded. 
At best, learning to judge by rings is an indirect rather 
than a direct means to meeting the vocational situation. Buy- 
ers and sellers do not “ place” animals in just the way the 
   
-P-A-G-E-262
  
262 FORMS OF TEACHING 
“judge” does it. But they do something very close to it 
often in buying stock from a herd or putting prices upon 
breeding stock of their own. With horses most frequently 
and often with other stock, evaluation of a single animal 
against the desirable standard rather than against other pres- 
ent animals is the common problem of the farmer. In that 
prevalent situation, too, it is type rather than breed standard 
which is serviceable. Rarely does the farmer in most of the 
farming occupations buy or sell a horse on the basis of breed; 
not two per cent. of the cattle of the country, of the sheep, and 
probably of the hogs belong to any pure breed. With poultry 
the proportion is higher decidedly. But for a long time to 
come the majority of farmers will be concerned with types 
rather than with breeds of farm animals. Only prospective 
breeders of live stock need the refined standards of variant 
breeds for vocational use. 
As to the merits and adaptations of some particular breeds 
certainly most farmers should be well informed, if progress 
is to be made in the animal enterprises of farming, but that 
judging is the means to such an end is extremely doubtful. It 
is probably safe to say that most farmers whe have chosen a 
breed type for grading up a herd of cattle, sheep, or swine 
should delegate the selection of bull, ram, or boar to an expert 
agent of an association, the farm bureau agent or a breeder 
of established reputation. 
All this is merely to emphasize that judging is a means to 
education for distinctly vocational ends, and that a careful 
discrimination of its aims must be made in every case. 
As for judging teams it may be noted in the light of the 
foregoing that neither farmers, live-stock breeders, nor even 
poultry fanciers judge in teams. Consequently the situation 
of the learner who works in a team is not that of the vocation 
which he is to follow. But the competitive stimulus of team
-P-A-G-E-263
JUDGING 263 
judging and the codperative discussion and formulation of 
team judgments may be legitimate and useful means to the 
acquirement of individual standards, if they do not tend, as 
sometimes is the case, to reliance upon one member, the only 
one to be taught to act on his own judgment. Chiefly the 
objection that the writer holds to the use of judging teams 
lies in the abuse of them. Many a teacher spends weeks of 
time, that might be used to far greater advantage, in training a 
team that will make a good showing at the local, county, or 
state fair. 
Most of the considerations above put forward hold as well 
in the case of the judging of crops. On the whole, judging of 
crops is much less emphasized than judging of animals, and 
probably rightly so. Not that standards of selection are less 
important than with animals, but because plants are fixed and 
cannot be assembled in convenient rings for judging. We do 
judge crop products, vegetables, grains, fruits, but not crop 
plants as a rule. And such judging helps chiefly to 
the setting of market standards—an important factor, 
but only one factor, in selection. There the individual 
merit of onion, ear of corn, potato, apple, is not at all a certain 
indication of variety merit. The best plate of potatoes 
may have come from plants of the lowest yield, the best 
plate of apples may have come from that tree in the orchard 
from which it would be most unwise to cut cions. The case of 
corn is notorious. Under present circumstances some classes 
of boys are given weeks of drill in selecting and rating ears of 
corn according to show standards, and are taught to choose 
seed corn that must yield considerably less than the most 
productive strains of the variety. There is even a technic in 
growing perfect ears that is somewhat antagonistic to that of 
growing profitable market yields (see Montgomery—The 
Corn Crops). When animals gain according to the perfection 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
264 FORMS OF TEACHING 
of ear fed and not by pounds of nutriment, when the price 
of corn is set by the ear and not by the bushel, then such 
judging will be vocationally justified for many farmers, but 
not now. Our judging of crops must be placed on the basis 
of the whole plant, not upon a part of it, if farmers are to 
improve their crops. 
But with many crops and most farmers, judging and the 
use of standards other than type is and most economically 
may be a minor matter. Where judging is said to function 
most, it does not function much, namely, in the purchase of 
seed. Seed is bought in the light of information concerning 
the productivity, hardiness, adaptation, disease resistance, 
etc., of the strain or variety. A knowledge of the conditions 
under which it was grown, how it was handled and kept, is 
certainly desirable and the reputation of the grower is perhaps 
the safest guide. But the seed itself, if the farmer can see it 
at all, does not tell the story, nor does the young tree. It is 
the purity and viability of the seed only of which he can judge 
by sampling. Fortunately the tendency in schools is to bring 
seed testing into close connection with judging. Here again 
the actual situations to be met in the vocation should be clearly 
determined if we are to make crop judging a means to usable 
standards. Ordinarily, of course, crop judging is confined to 
the laboratory, but because it should be carried into the field, 
it is here considered. 
Conduct of the Practicum.—In farm practicum work the 
teacher encounters one chief difficulty in working with a class 
of boys—that of holding the attention of every member to the 
task in hand. To overcome that difficulty three factors con- 
tribute largely, as they do in all other forms of class teaching: 
(1) The purpose of the undertaking must be clearly under- 
stood both by teacher and class; (2) the end to be gained must
-P-A-G-E-265
  PRUNING 265 
be pertinent to the solution of some individual problem of 
each pupil; (3) every pupil must be kept in action. 
Pruning.—To illustrate let us consider the popular prac- 
tice of pruning. In every case pruning will have for the 
teacher the purpose of developing a certain degree of pro- 
ficiency in one of several skills in the art of pruning; for 
example: (a) in renovating an old tree, (b) in opening up a 
tree of fruiting age, (c) in cutting back.a five or ten year tree, 
(d) in shaping a tree for setting, or (e) a young set tree to 
standard, etc. Now before every boy should be immediate 
or clearly prospective the need for performing that job in 
an enterprise of his own or as a responsible employe. Merely 
to be told that every farmer ought to know how to do the job, 
which may be true or not, will furnish no vigorous motive 
with the majority of boys. In (a) will be used skill with the 
saw and pruner, in (b) skill with the pruner and probably 
the saw, in (c) skill with the pruner, in (d) skill with the 
knife, in (e) skill with the shears or knife or both. And in 
every case a distinct pattern of form for the tree must be had 
in mind. 
As a preliminary to the pruning practicum suggestive ques- 
tioning or even statement by the teacher to bring clearly to the 
fore the need of skill in the particular job is the first step. 
The second is a setting of the pattern of form to result from 
the job. Here diagrams and pictures are of some use, but far 
less effective than the showing of one or several trees 
previously pruned to proper form by the teacher or another 
skilled pruner. Then follows the demonstration by the 
teacher, which sets a pattern for each of the skills involved 
and for the finished tree again. In this connection several 
points are to be observed. Probably in most cases in (a) it 
will be well to complete all work with the saw before taking 
up the pruner—one skill at a time. Again the teacher in dem-  
-P-A-G-E-266
    266 FORMS OF TEACHING 
onstration is appealing to his class through two senses only, 
sight and hearing. He should remember the work of the 
magician at the show, who by his continuous patter diverts 
attention from what his hands are doing. Now the teacher 
wishes attention to what he is saying, and to what he is doing. 
If he keeps up a continuous explanation the while his hands 
are busy, he is very likely to get the result of the magician, 
which is the opposite of what he desires. Very few untrained 
persons can pay effective attention to two things at once. If 
he will clearly state the purpose of each step, call to attention 
the important features of that step, and then perform it 
silently, he will probably get more effective attention than 
either by talking all the time he works, doing all his talking 
first and all his work afterwards, or vice versa. Often note- 
books will be of use during the demonstration, not for taking 
down what the teacher says or does, but for entering questions 
that arise with pupils as the process goes on. Those questions 
may be used for immediate discussion when the demonstra- 
tion is complete, for future class discussion, or for assignment 
and reference as the teacher judges may be most economical 
and effective. 
Now, following the demonstration comes trial by the pupil. 
That trial is primarily a process of pattern setting, since both 
visual and aural experience are factors, in the case of pruning 
skills, subordinate to the kinesthetic or muscular. At this 
point, often, waste of time and disorder come in, if there are 
not trees enough or tools enough to give every boy a separate 
job ata separate tree. Few schools will be justified in purchas- 
ing tools for an entire class to be used for a few hours or days 
only during the year, and few farms will possess enough to 
keep a class of ten or twenty busy. Moreover, during 
the trial the pupil becomes conscious of difficulties in the 
process, of which he was utterly unaware during the demon-
-P-A-G-E-267
PRUNING 267 
stration and requires a good deal of individual attention on the 
part of the teacher, if an effective pattern experience is to be 
achieved. Accordingly in a practicum of the kind most 
effective work is ordinarily to be done by small groups of four 
to six, rather than by classes. Other members of the class can 
be assigned to study, survey work, or work at home, and later 
taken out in their turn. 
Now the degree of skill to be achieved will vary according 
to the purpose of the course. For instance, if pruning is a part 
of the training of boys who are to be orchardists, a higher 
degree of skill is obviously necessary than if it be a part of the 
training of boys who are to be dairy farmers, to whom a few 
trees or a home orchard only will present needs for pruning. 
Clearly then the time devoted to practice for the perfection of 
skill will vary considerably. Whereas, with the prospective 
orchardists some weeks of practice may be necessary, with 
prospective dairy farmers a few hours may be ample. If fruit 
growing is a minor interest all of the necessary practice may 
often be had on the home farm; the same may be the case 
where fruit growing is a major interest, but it is likely that the 
taking on of definite orchard jobs may be desirable. 
At this point a caution is worth inserting. The taking on 
of practicum jobs for farmers must be thought of primarily 
as a means to training pupils and only incidentally as a service 
to farmers. The teacher should be careful to take on no more 
of such work than is sufficient to teaching ends. Otherwise he 
may find himself in a dilemma, as in the following case. A 
teacher inserted an advertisement in the local paper stating 
that the school would undertake to do the pruning work of 
such farmers as wrote or called him on the telephone during 
the week. At the end of the week sixteen farmers had made 
application for the service, and the teacher found himself com- 
mitted to several months of pruning work far in excess of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
      
   268 FORMS OF TEACHING 
needs of his class. He was then confronted with the un- 
pleasant task of explaining that he had bitten off more than 
he could chew, with the danger that his work would be brought 
into disrepute through failure to accomplish what he had 
promised. On the other hand, had he faithfully undertaken to 
do all that work, he would have been rightly subject to censure 
by supervisory authority. A teacher who knows the farms 
and farmers of his community need hardly resort to the ex- 
pedient of advertising for work. But where service of eco- 
nomic importance is rendered, especially if it be unpaid for, he 
must use great care to avoid the appearance of partiality. If 
the work be paid for and the earnings used for the school there 
is danger of exploitation, or at least the charge of exploita- 
tion; if it be paid for on the basis of wages to boys little can 
be said against it, provided the zeal of earning be restrained 
from leading to excessive practice. But here, if the work be 
carried on at all during school hours, as properly it may be, 
some jealousy may result among students in other courses, 
who cannot earn during school hours. 
Earlier practicums need close supervision if a perfection 
of skill is to be achieved. But later practicums may be carried 
on away from the instructor, provided his touch be close 
enough to note the stage of improvement. When the pupils 
have acquired a proficiency sufficient to the economical per- 
formance of the job, regular practice should be stopped. 
Occasional practice at longer and longer intervals may be 
maintained to prevent loss of the proficiency acquired by 
the regular practice. But, in most cases, some of the forms 
of supervised farm work will take care of the mat- 
ter incidentally. 
Such skills as are involved in culling poultry, killing and 
plucking poultry, packing and grading fruit, spraying, shear- 
ing sheep, and the like may be classified with pruning, but   
-P-A-G-E-269
  SKILLS TO BE TAUGHT 269 
there are others in which the demonstration and trial are 
almost always sufficient, without further practice, as in catch- 
ing and holding a sheep, throwing a calf, holding a fowl, using 
the manure spreader, mixing concrete or fertilizer, and a good 
many tool and machine controls. 
There are a good many cases in which class demonstration 
may be desirable, but in which opportunity for trial by every 
member of the group must be deferred. For example, cas- 
trating young pigs. A good many farmers would be willing 
and glad to have the castrating of a bunch of young pigs 
performed by the teacher in demonstration but would be 
unwilling to trust any pigs to boys for trial. Even if the 
demonstration be given with a brood belonging to one of the 
pupils he may properly be the only member to have a trial at 
the time; the rest must make trial on their own pigs. Toa 
less extent the same is true of butchering. The teacher may 
give but one demonstration but the preparing and cutting up 
of carcasses must be limited more or less to individuals who 
own them. A rotation scheme is sometimes used in which the 
class or groups from the class go the round of enterprises, but 
clearly the first boy to submit his problem to the group is in 
somewhat worse case than the last. 
Skills to be Taught Through the Practicums.—It must 
not be assumed that the writer is recommending without re- 
serve practice in castrating or butchering for all prospective 
keepers of swine. The operations are relatively simple and 
skill in them is certainly convenient for a great many farmers, 
but there are many communities in which reliance upon 
experts may be the economical procedure. The same consid- 
erations hold in the case of threshing, running silo filling 
machinery, setting up a silo, running a power sawing outfit, a 
power spraying outfit, shearing sheep, clipping horses, stack- 
ing, and a score of operations regularly performed on farms
-P-A-G-E-270
270 FORMS OF TEACHING 
by men who put capital or special skill in the hands of the 
farmer for hire or by contract. We revert again to a careful 
consideration of vocational necessities in determining what 
skills should be taught. 
Certain skills that may be incidental by-products for some 
boys must be practicum subjects for other boys, notably village 
or city boys, even where supervised farm employment is pro- 
vided for them. Such are harnessing, driving, milking, care 
of utensils, greasing wagons, adjusting cultivators, and many 
of the common and simpler skills of the farm. Special group 
instruction for such boys will simplify the problem of finding 
employment for them and the task of follow-up in 
that employment. 
On the other hand there are many relatively simple skills 
that cannot be assumed as a result of home employment or 
the carrying on of business enterprises or undertakings. Boys 
are frequently advised, and correctly, to broadcast seed (clover 
and grass seed) at the rate of four to twenty pounds to the 
acre, to make successive applications of nitrate of soda at the 
rate of fifty pounds per acre, to feed ten pounds of hay daily, 
etc. But we neglect the possession of standards. Aska group 
of farm boys to throw out on the floor ten pounds of hay, to 
demonstrate how far they must go with a pail of nitrate in 
spreading or with a handful of clover seed, how many rows 
of potatoes they must cover with a tankful of arsenate if the 
acre supply is to hold out, how many forkfuls or wheelbarrow 
loads or cartloads they must spread in putting a thousand 
pounds of manure on the garden, and you will be astonished at 
the variety in responses. So much are things of the sort 
assumed and so little taught in agricultural colleges or any- 
where, that most teachers will find it necessary through private 
experiment to work out standards and methods for themselves 
before they undertake to teach classes. And those things are
-P-A-G-E-271
  OBSERVATION TRIPS 271 
obviously among the first essentials of good farm practice. 
They constitute problems that must be solved in the success- 
ful carrying on of the home business or productive enterprise 
or the supervised farm employment of the pupil. 
Without doubt the injunction to “make all training and 
instruction centre in (grow out of) the present project (work- 
ing problems) of the pupil” is pedagogically sound, and if 
heeded will greatly strengthen the work of the agricultural 
teacher. But teachers of experience are right in their con- 
tention that the word “all” is too inclusive. There are a 
good many abilities vocationally significant for individuals 
and particularly groups which should be developed, but which 
cannot, except through the most artificial straining be “ tied 
up” with the home work. However, many of these can be 
taught most successfully in problem form. For example, it 
will very seldom be a part of the pupil’s work to sell or buy 
a horse. Yet the buying, selling, and trading of horses is 
almost certain to enter significantly into the majority of farm 
occupations. Hence to know types and to recognize and 
evaluate horses in terms of soundness is an important group 
of abilities. Some stimulus may be given to practicum study 
of horses by the setting of an artificial problem. Assuming a 
given end, say the purchase of a horse to work single or double, 
a driving horse to be used singly, or the matching of a pair, 
boys will ordinarily respond with much more interest if re- 
quired to “ go over” a half dozen horses, to indicate choice 
and the price they would pay, with reasons, than to the usual 
exercise of “ going over” a single horse with no other object 
than to name defects to the satisfaction of the teacher. 
Observation Trips.—Other studies, frequently worth 
while, take the form of observation trips, but fail in motive 
because of lack of any need for interpretation of observations. 
Such are soil survey trips and the field study of corn or
-P-A-G-E-272
  
272 FORMS OF TEACHING 
potatoes. Fictitious problems may help in such cases. For 
instance, if boys be given the “ problem ” of laying off a single 
season’s cropping plan for a given farm, some motive is given 
to observation and interpretation of soils differences, drainage 
differences, and differences in topography and exposure, that 
is not found in the ordinary field trip when the same data are 
“ studied.” Professor W. L. Slate makes the following sug- 
gestions with regard to field study of the corn plant: “Two 
fields, at least, in which are growing different types of corn 
(Longfellow-Sanford for example in a flint region, Leaming- 
Boone County in a dent region) furnish the best basis for 
study, since comparison becomes possible. The point of view 
should be, ‘ Here is the result of the farmer’s labor. What 
characteristics has it that make it of value to him here?’ Com- 
pare the proportions of ears, stalk, and leaves in plants of the 
two varieties, the degree of maturity, the indications of vigor. 
Count the stalks on a given area that seems representative as 
a basis for calculation of yield. Pull three typical plants of 
each variety to test for economy in handling (green weight and 
air dry weight). Raise questions as to how far likenesses and 
differences are attributable to (1) selection, (2) location, 
(3) care. Note variations in characteristics of value in the 
same field, where drainage differences, soil differences and 
differences in clean cultivation, insect injury or disease, 
appear. Estimate the loss due to an imperfect stand, to lack of 
drainage, to foulness, diseased and injured plants; note the 
‘lay of the land’ in each field, and carry back samples of 
surface and subsoil, carefully labeled, for examination as to 
differences in moisture content, texture, organic matter, 
acidity,” The plan is for a study of corn in September after 
school has begun. If observations of the kind can be begun 
early and carried on at intervals throughout the growing 
season, certainly usable knowledge in relation to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  
INDIVIDUAL PRACTICE 278 
corn plant is likely to be much more definite and real than is 
acquired by the ordinary classroom and laboratory teaching 
of corn. 
Class Problems.—Class “ problems ” may achieve a con- 
siderable degree of reality in cases like the “ ear-row test” for 
corn, variety tests in wheat or potatoes, fertilizer tests, laying 
out and setting an orchard, eliminating unprofitable cows, re- 
claiming a wet spot, if the codperation of farmers who really 
wish such jobs done on their farms can be secured. So, too, 
if a genuine contribution is called for by farmers in 
the identification of insects and disease injuries some motive 
other than curiosity can be invoked for the study of such 
pests of vocational importance as are not met in the home 
work of pupils. The usual teaching under the topics seems to 
the writer largely futile. To examine on an afternoon some 
twenty or thirty dried specimens of disease and record the 
names in a notebook, on another afternoon to do the same 
thing with a case of insects impaled on pins, and then to take 
a walk “some day before examination to see how many 
diseases and insects we can identify ” is only one small step 
in advance of recitation on textbook assignments. The field 
is an important one in many kinds of farming, more important 
than knowledge of treatments, since with a definite diagnosis 
of injury a brief consultation with the county agent or refer- 
ence to book or bulletin will discover the remedy if any exists. 
Individual teaching at home is perhaps the best means for 
most cases, but, as has been indicated, practicums may be 
required for certain forms. 
Individual Practice—One other class of practicums 
needs to be considered. As supplementing and enlarging the 
pupils’ home undertakings, individual practicums are often 
useful, such as keeping the home herd record, taking charge 
of the feeding of the herd for a fortnight or a month, market- 
18
-P-A-G-E-274
  214 FORMS OF TEACHING 
ing the apple or potato crop for the whole farm, taking the 
inventory of the farm. Then there are cases of skills which 
may be insufficiently developed in the accomplishment of the 
boy’s own job, such as using the drill, rake, mower, manure 
spreader, feeding the silage cutter, measuring cord wood, 
estimating lumber, at some of which, in the ordinary course 
of events, he never gets a chance until he reaches man’s estate. 
Most of such can be taken care of in a proper supervision of 
farm work if the teacher has the right contact with father or 
employer, but since they do not grow out of ordinary 
“ project ” requirements are here listed as practicums. 
Importance of Directed Farm Studies.—It is conceiv- 
able that a fairly effective vocational education for a given 
farm occupation might be worked out on the basis of farm 
surveys and practicums, but it would lack the vocational 
reality of one founded on responsible supervised farm work 
as presented in the first form of teaching. On the other hand 
reliance on the first form only would much reduce the strength 
of teaching because of the inevitable limitation in scope of a 
boy’s business, productive enterprise, or supervised employ- 
ment on a single farm even of a type largely representative of 
the particular vocation. The two forms of teaching super- 
vised farm work and directed farm studies, are the funda- 
mental forms in teaching agriculture. They are capable of 
very considerable development even under high school condi- 
tions, and, if they are not strongly developed, no course in 
agriculture, no matter what the qualifications of the teacher as 
laboratory and shop technician or in the classroom, deserves 
the designation “ vocational.”

CHAPTER XV 
FORMS OF TEACHING IN VOCATIONAL 
AGRICULTURE 
CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR 
FARM SHOP WORK AND ENGINEERING 
In most farming and other agricultural occupations is 
found the need for certain specific abilities in dealing with 
materials and using tools for the sake of construction and 
repair. Out of a study of the particular vocations for which 
any scheme of preparatory education is set up must be derived 
the type jobs through which requisite abilities are to be taught, 
in accordance (1) with the frequency of demand for such 
abilities in the vocation, (2) with the ultimate certainty of 
demand. As has been pointed out frequency is the better 
criterion, since an ability needed again and again in the suc- 
cessful carrying on of the occupation must almost certainly be 
possessed by the effective participant in that occupation, but to 
the other there is a limitation. It may in many cases be true 
that the time spent in developing abilities certain to be called 
for at some time during the pursuit of an occupation is wasted 
if the employment of a specialist to meet the need when it 
arises be more economical than the use of the farmer’s own 
time in meeting it. Thus we can say almost certainly that the 
prospective greenhouse man should learn to set glass, but not 
that he should certainly learn to install a boiler; that the dairy 
farmer should learn to hang a door or repair a stanchion, but 
not certainly that he should learn to construct a hollow tile 
silo. The second case may represent economy under some cir- 
275  
-P-A-G-E-276
  276 FORMS OF TEACHING 
cumstances but not under others; the first case is cer- 
tain economy. 
It is possible to advocate the use of the criterion of ulti- 
mate certainty without accepting the fallacy of “ cold storage ” 
adverted to by Doctor Snedden. That there must be for 
abilities developed to meet such contingencies, in the normal 
case, lapse because of disuse through failure of the con- 
tingency to arise, is to be recognized. But that failure to 
provide for meeting a situation which may arise in six months 
because, in many cases, it does not arise within ten years, is 
hardly to effect an economy in education. Because many men 
go through life without the necessity of making a tourniquet 
or “ working over” a person unconscious from immersion, 
and many do not meet such situations until years after all their 
formal education is completed, is hardly ground for the aboli- 
tion of teaching of first aid in schools or among boy scouts. A 
large part of the training and instruction of general practi- 
tioners in medicine, nurses, lawyers, engineers, and other well 
defined occupations for which vocational education is offered, 
must be rejected if we carry Doctor Snedden’s principle into 
full practice. That later education for retention of abilities 
tending to lapse may be true economy is highly probable. It 
is not advocated here that the farmer shall cease his education 
with entry into his life work. 
Job Processes.—For the teacher the job complex of abili- 
ties so determined is further analyzable into hand or tool or 
machine skills in which more or less definite factors of speed 
and accuracy stand out. Thus the greenhouse man in setting 
glass must be able to clear a frame, to lay the pane shinglewise, 
to tack or clamp the pane, to lay putty with a putty knife, and 
probably to cut glass and mix putty. The hanging of a door 
involves at least setting the door in the frame, bracing and 
blocking that it may swing free, setting a hinge and driving
-P-A-G-E-277
  STANDARDS OF WORKMANSHIP Q77 
screws. Further the glass must be set accurately enough so 
that it stays in place and the hinge and screws accurately 
enough so that the door will swing and hold up in ordinary 
use. As to speed in either case, we must go to successful 
men in the occupation for reasonable standards, in fairly 
standardized situations like that of setting glass in a green- 
house making actual time records. We can say now that the 
greenhouse man does not need the skill in setting glass that 
the professional glazier must have, if he certainly requires 
much more than the runof farmers. But if he takes half an 
hour to set a pane, on the average, he is probably handicapped, 
as is the dairyman who takes all the forenoon to get the door 
up again when it has been torn off. 
Standards of Workmanship.—One ideal has been car- 
ried into the shop work in agriculture upon which a great deal 
of emphasis is laid, namely, the maintenance of creditable 
standards of workmanship. No careless or slovenly work in 
construction or repair is to be tolerated in the training of boys 
to do such jobs. The ideal is sound and admirable, but it 
needs thoughtful interpretation. Creditable workmanship 
means the meeting of a standard appropriate to the particular 
job. Too often shop work teachers insist upon a standard in 
farm construction that is appropriate to the making of furni- 
ture for the house. It is not uncommon to find in college and 
school, hog troughs, feed hoppers, and the like squared up and 
fitted with refined accuracy, screwed and glued, planed and 
sandpapered, and, in two cases that the writer has noted, 
varnished. One group of college freshmen spent three hours 
a week for six weeks in making a hog trough; a group of 
experienced teachers spent their afternoons through a six 
weeks’ session in making a farm shop workbench, and in both 
cases the time spent was justified by the instructor on the 
ground of “ discipline” and the necessity for high standards
-P-A-G-E-278
278 FORMS OF TEACHING 
of workmanship. If the finished product is appropriate to the 
purpose that it must serve, then the standard of workmanship 
is maintained. 
Cautions.—Motive to work with tools is so readily 
secured that the teacher is sometimes misled. Boys like to 
be physically active, to do things, to get results promptly that 
show, and the interest in tool work is frequently high, so that 
the shop often shows to the visitor the busiest and most inter- 
ested group in the whole school. No doubt from the subjective 
viewpoint of vocation, the pupil should be allowed to follow 
his interests and to undertake a refinement of job completion 
or even of job attack not strictly the most economical from 
the standpoint objective in vocation. From such work he 
derives a satisfaction that may illuminate the whole pursuit 
for which he prepares, and make it a calling as well as a 
service. There are men whose chief satisfaction in farming 
comes from the fact that it offers so many opportuni- 
ties for gratification of the habit of tinkering. But the 
gratification of such a habit may as distinctly interfere 
with the success of the farmer as gratification of the habit 
of hunting or fishing. A man may be happier and more 
productive farmer because he has learned to hunt or fish, or 
because he has learned to tinker skilfully. But he cannot 
become hunter, fisherman, or tinker, and remain a farmer. In 
most farming vocations there is a range of veritably economic 
jobs in construction and repair sufficient to satisfy any me- 
chanic capacity for growth that is consonant with fitness for an 
agricultural vocation. If that appears not to be so in particular 
cases the questions may be raised (1) as to whether or not 
the teacher has fully developed the appropriate field, (2) as to 
whether the boy is not misplaced in a course for prospective 
agricultural employment. A boy who is so keenly interested 
in tool work as some agricultural students have shown them-
-P-A-G-E-279
  THE PROCESS SEQUENCE IDEA 279 
selves to be may find his true opportunity as carpenter, builder, 
mason, garage mechanic, blacksmith, machinist, and should be 
helped to the appropriate training where it is most accessible, 
in spite of the fact that he has enrolled in an agricultural 
course. It is not the function of the shop work of the agri- 
cultural course to prepare for the mechanic trades, even 
though: it give an occasional student a useful start in that 
direction. It is well for the enthusiastic and proficient teacher 
of farm shop work to bear that fact in mind. 
The Process Sequence Idea—Two characteristic 
influences still manifest themselves in much of the repair 
and construction work that is carried on in agricultural 
courses, and neither is conducive to the most effective teach- 
ing. One is the old “manual training” idea of “ process 
sequence.” The objectives of teaching are held not altogether 
incorrectly to be the possession of specific manual skills or tool 
processes, varying from the relatively simple and easy to the 
relatively complex and difficult. It becomes the task of the 
teacher to develop these skills process by process on a scale of 
increasing difficulty. The simplest procedure is to isolate the 
processes from the complexes in which they occur, or the jobs, 
and to teach them singly. Thus boys begin work by sawing 
boards with the cross-cut saw till they can follow the line, then 
with the split saw till they can follow the line, then they plane 
and square up, then make and fit a lap joint, etc., until they 
have mastered all the processes necessary to the sort of car- 
pentry which they are todo. The plan violates the principles 
of sound pedagogy in two particulars: (1) It places the skill 
situations apart from their appropriate context, as the Chinese 
do in teaching of words apart from meaning or written 
symbol, in teaching ideographs apart from meanings, so that 
the making of appropriate bonds between a vocational stimu- 
lus and a vocational response, the prime work of the vocational
-P-A-G-E-280
280 FORMS OF TEACHING 
teacher, is not accomplished; (2) by the same token it re- 
moves the major motive derivative of accomplishment. The 
pupil has, as a result of his work, nothing useful to him or to 
anybody else, except the janitor who builds the fires. He 
puts in a whole afternoon producing sawdust, shavings, strips 
or sections of lumber, and, after the novelty has worn off, 
the work becomes to him a dead school chore to be avoided 
and shirked as far as his conscience and the vigilance of the 
teacher permit. 
Fortunately the extreme case of disciplinary manual train- 
ing is not often found in the vocational courses. But the 
influence is strong in its effect on courses and teaching. It 
appears particularly in courses of prescribed shop “ projects,” 
in which the successive “ projects ” are obviously chosen for 
the sake of the processes involved rather than because of their 
type as vocational jobs. Thus boys begin their work by 
making a bread board or a bench hook, not because they are 
likely to find it economical to make a bread board or a wooden 
bench hook, but because those things can readily be made from 
small pieces of soft wood, and because in them can be taught 
certain simple “ fundamentals ” of the wood-working such as 
squaring up, sawing off, split sawing and planing. They 
make necktie racks later on, and still later whiffletrees, in order 
to become acquainted with the use of the draw shave or spoke 
shave in use on hard wood. There is nothing in any farm 
vocation to indicate the appropriateness of a necktie rack, 
little to indicate that any farmer is likely to find it profitable 
to spend his time in making whiffletrees while the mail order 
houses are in business, little to indicate that a spoke shave is 
useful ina farmer’s shop. In one of the very best of the pub- 
lished manuals of farm wood-work we find “ projects” in 
making a corner of a building, because in the corner the num- 
ber of “ processes ” reaches a maximum. When the corner is
-P-A-G-E-281
       GETTING THE JOB DONE 281 
built nothing is created but an impediment. In metal work 
courses the influence of the “ formal process sequence” is 
practically universal. 
Now with a teaching development from the simpler to 
the more complex skills the writer is in full sympathy. But 
the wealth of truly significant jobs and complete projects open 
to any resourceful teacher is so great that such a develop- 
ment is easily possible without uniform prescription or arti- 
ficial selection. 
Getting the Job Done.—The second influence which fre- 
quently appears is an inheritance, not from the “ normal 
training in shop, ” but from the “ practical man.” With him, 
naturally, the important thing is to “ get the job done.” The 
simplest way to get the job done is to do the thinking and 
planning yourself and then give “ directions” one by one to 
workers, so that it shall be done. For example, the following 
is almost a literal transcript of the procedure of a first-class 
farm carpenter in teaching a group of six high school boys: 
Teacher: “Go to the cabinet and get, each of you, these 
tools.” He wrote on the board: 
1. Steel square, 
2. Cross-cut saw No. 7, 
3. Hammer, 
4. Screw-driver, 14’. 
When the boys had complied he said: 
“ Now go to the stock room and get, each of you, six six- 
inch pine boards.” When the boards had been brought out: 
“ Cut those boards so that each one is exactly twelve feet long 
and properly squared at each end.” 
It was some time before the task was accomplished to the 
‘teacher’s satisfaction, but when the last boy had laid down his 
tools, he resumed:  
-P-A-G-E-282
       
    282 FORMS OF TEACHING 
“Get two more boards of the same kind, and cut out from 
them three pieces just five feet long, as carefully as you did 
the others.” 
The last directions had not been fully carried out when 
the double period expired, and it became necessary to put tools 
and stock away, and to sweep up. As the boys filed out of the 
room one of them stopped to ask a question: ‘‘ What are we 
going to make this time, Mr. Smith?” 
Now, possibly that procedure was the most effective the 
teacher could have adopted to get six gates made, but it was 
probably very nearly the least effective he could use in teach- 
ing boys how to make a gate. The boys had no more motive 
for their work, no more scope for initiative, planning, think- 
ing or standard for evaluating their work, than a private in 
the Prussian Guard in the days of German efficiency under the 
“all-highest.” The German was logical in that he held it 
was no part of the private’s duty to know. The teacher over- 
looked the fact that it was the first aim of his work that the 
boy should know. The teacher’s product is the trained boy, 
not the twelve-foot gate. 
Directions are certainly useful, and learning to use 
directions may be an important acquisition for a pupil who 
has to make a gate. But let him discover the need for direc- 
tions—the significance of the six twelve-foot boards in the 
horizontal structure of the gate, of the five boards in the 
vertical structure, etc. ; let him discover that he needs a square, 
a saw, a hammer, a screw-driver for the accomplishment of 
the job, if the object be to establish an attitude favorable to 
the use of directions, once he is “on his own” and the task- 
master absent. 
Good teaching in construction and repair considers the 
boy and the job together. It is the place of the job as con- 
ducted under the teacher to educate the boy, but the boy
-P-A-G-E-283
  
DRAWING 283 
cannot be so educated except he get the job done. Between the 
extreme of isolated manual training processes in which the 
product is nothing, and the method of the shop boss in which 
the product is everything, is the present status of the best 
teaching in construction and repair. 
Special practice in sawing, in laying off, in planing, in 
boring and other processes is often justified. But it should 
be motivated through its understood relation to a significant 
job in hand. A boy, let us say, has a screen frame to make 
for the open front of his hen house. It must be squared to 
fit, it must be lap-jointed neatly to present a plane to the 
screen. Then practice in squaring, sawing off, lap-jointing, 
with odd pieces, before cutting into scarce or expensive new 
material is clearly motivated for the boy. It is not an end in 
itself, a means to satisfying the teacher, but a means to the 
accomplishment of a job of his own. 
Drawing.—Drawing is another phase of farm shop work 
in schools that suffers from the “ disciplinary manual process 
sequence ” delusion. Some ability in free hand sketching and 
mechanical drawing is probably of use in a good many agri- 
cultural vocations, with the first in general more important 
than the second. If a farmer sees a convenience or an im- 
provement at a fair he can make it his own by a sketch, if he 
devises a plan of layout or construction he can make it intel- 
ligible to others for use or criticism, by a sketch. But com- 
monly sketching is neglected and mechanical drawing 
over-emphasized. The fact that the teaching of sketching 
calls for skill and resourcefulness on the part of the teacher, 
whereas ready-made categorical manuals in mechanical draw- 
ing are available, is largely responsible for the situation. Boys 
spend from two to ten weeks in copying stars, triangles, 
circles, and diagrams, which have no significance in their 
vocation or anywhere else, and in making letters apart from
-P-A-G-E-284
    284 FORMS OF TEACHING 
any necessity for use of letters. The mechanical drawing to 
make is the plan of the “ project” which the boy is under- 
taking, and the time for lettering is when that plan needs 
lettering. If he can draw the plan to scale with reasonable 
accuracy and neatness, letter it legibly, enough skill is de- 
veloped. He is not going to be a draughtsman, but a farmer, 
and if he can produce a diagram which he or an ordinary 
mechanic can use, the standard of workmanship is sufficient. 
But more important than making a drawing is ability to 
interpret one. Perhaps the chief reason for calling upon the 
student to make a drawing is to help in interpretation. A 
means to testing and teaching interpretation is in 
the act of interpretation by the use of working drawings. 
Many teachers are calling for such use, but find con- 
siderable difficulty in the initial stages, particularly if 
they use a ready-made drawing in a bulletin or a copy of 
such made by boys. They find that pupils fail to make any 
very close connection between the kind of object for which the 
drawing stands and the drawing itself, except it be of some- 
thing familiar in their experience. 
An acquaintance of the writer was sent to northern Labra- 
dor to induce a number of Eskimos to enter one of the great 
national exhibitions. In order to convince them of the oppor- 
tunity, he carried among other things a number of brilliant 
lithographs and some diagrams of the layout of grounds and 
buildings. Of the lithographs the aborigines made two inter- 
pretations, one that the sheets were flags, the other that they 
were materials for making shirts. The British flag and the 
calico bartered for their furs furnished the only basis for 
interpretation in their experience. A few of the older were 
made to see that the diagrams represented something—and 
they became quite interested in tracing out the devious sledge 
and animal tracks of the strange people in the south.
-P-A-G-E-285
  DRAWING 285 
To overcome the difficulty, which is common in the case 
of beginners with working drawings, a successful teacher uses 
a method such as is illustrated in the following: The first 
project being a feed-hopper, he makes sure that all his pupils 
know what a feed-hopper is and looks like, by showing them 
a completed hopper, not necessarily of just the type they are 
tomake. He measures its parts, and with it in sight constructs 
a rough working drawing for its construction, showing how 
each detail stands for an actual detail of the hopper. He then 
puts away his drawing and asks each boy to sketch out a plan 
of his own to scale. In the same way when floor plans and 
elevations of poultry buildings are to be used he begins by 
having pupils make working plans of an existing hen-house 
or other building. Thus they are enabled to visualize a hop- 
per or building not yet existent from the plans of others or to 
reduce to a plan a conception of their own. The preliminary 
observation need not be performed in the case of every fol- 
lowing “ project,” but only in those cases in which a novel 
type is taken up, say pump or engine, the structure and work- 
ing of which can be illuminated by a drawing. 
Needless to say the drawings which are made by the class 
are those which are used, since the teacher desires to make a 
connection between the making of a drawing and the use of 
it, a habit that must be established if it be worth while to teach 
the making of working drawings. The preliminary obser- 
vation and drawing work should, in general, serve the same 
purpose in shop projects as is served by the demonstration in 
the case of a practicum in pruning, namely, to set a pattern 
in the mind of the pupil by which he can evaluate and interpret 
the steps in his procedure in construction. But in simple 
repair and construction preliminary study of the job to be 
done may serve equally well without any drawing more than 
a rough sketch, or even without that. It is a first requisite to 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
    286 FORMS OF TEACHING 
good shop teaching that the student should conceive clearly 
what he is trying to do. 
The Formal Shop Course.—At present work in con- 
struction and repair, both in the special schools of agriculture 
in which a shop teacher is employed, and in the high school 
courses of agriculture is set apart as a division or subject of 
the vocational course. It has a definitely assigned schedule 
of periods per week throughout a semester, a year, or occasion- 
ally two years, usually the first years of the course. It has a 
content of instruction formally organized to occupy those 
periods in the school shop made up of “ projects” and proc- 
ess practices in wood-work and mechanical drawing, some 
forge or cold metal work, jobs in harness repair, and a series 
of exercises in rope work. Work with concrete is coming to 
be a more frequent and larger portion of content than for- 
merly, and occasionally painting and varnishing, iron pipe 
work, and even electric wiring enters into instruction offered 
by more ambitious schools and teachers. Within the fields 
indicated the trend has been rather strongly toward a more 
and more appropriate selection of teaching content in ac- 
cordance with the needs of life on a farm, if not yet in 
terms of a particular vocation in agriculture. In a few states, 
and in certain schools of other states, shop work instruction is 
organized to relate closely to the subject, such as poultry hus- 
bandry, swine husbandry, or vegetable gardening, which pupils 
are studying during the term or year of shop work, and under 
the rapidly expanded “home project ” organization of agri- 
culture, teachers are attempting to make the shop work an 
integral part of the project instruction. Such procedure, of 
course is a sine qua non of an organization of teaching in 
enterprise and business units. 
But a unit organization, to make use of a central interest to 
secure teaching through actual vocational situations, and to
-P-A-G-E-287
KINDS OF JOB 287 
integrate the development of mechanic abilities, abstract 
abilities, and social abilities—all of those somewhat artificially 
segregated subjects into which the course has been divided— 
means the break-down of a formal course in shop work. Con- 
struction and repair cannot be carried on apart from the 
productive and business situations, which the boy must meet 
throughout the entire course. Thus two marked changes are 
occurring in the most progressive of our schools: (1) the 
substitution of continual teaching in repair and construction 
throughout the course in place of a half year or a year of 
formal shop work; (2) the transfer of a large part of such 
work from the school shop to farms and farm shops. 
Kinds of Job.—We have five categories of jobs under- 
taken in the so-called shop teaching: (1) Home farm jobs 
arising out of the needs of the boy in the pursuit of the voca- 
tion which is the means to his education, such as poultry house 
construction and repair, hog house construction and repair; 
construction in barns or calf pens, box stalls, lintels and re- 
pair and improvement of housing for animals owned by the 
pupil ; storage houses, bins, cellars, cold frames and hot beds, 
and other construction and repair necessary to the conduct of 
crop enterprises and businesses. (2) Home construction and 
repair characteristic of the vocation for which the boy pre- 
pares, needed on the home farm but not immediately called for 
in the pursuit of the learning vocation. Such are construction 
of farm shops, sheds for housing equipment, water tanks and 
feeding floors for cattle, manure sheds and pits, shingling, 
cutting doors and windows, and a large range of jobs inci- 
dental to the conduct of a farm. Here, of course, careful 
selection and evaluation must be made by the teacher with 
respect to the educative ends he has in view. It is possible for 
a boy to spend all his time at home doing work of the sort that 
is of service on the farm, but much of which may be of minor 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
   
   288 FORMS OF TEACHING 
  benefit to him. (3) Jobs growing out of home undertakings 
which may be economically handled in group teaching under 
school shop conditions, such as the making of small or easily 
transportable poultry apparatus, repairing tools and utensils, 
sharpening tools, and the like. (4) Supplementary practicum 
jobs derivative of the vocation, but not within the scope of 
particular home undertakings of pupils, carried out on farms 
or at the school shop for farmers. The same cautions in 
regard to taking on such work, either free or for hire, must 
be used here, as have been suggested for other farm practi- 
cums, in the preceding chapter. (5) Of doubtful acceptability 
in general, if occasionally justifiable in particular are jobs in 
repair and construction for school buildings and grounds. 
Because, in general such are not and cannot be jobs typical 
of the vocation, they are to be considered very carefully, in 
spite of the enthusiasm for such work naturally manifested 
by schooi boards and superintendents. The teacher who 
submits to the use of his class for the construction of school 
cabinets, the repair of school desks and chairs, the building 
of book shelves and tables, is exploiting the labor of his boys 
in a way that cannot be justified from the point of view of 
education for an agricultural vocation. The savor of exploita- 
tion may be offset by the salt of educative worth and economy 
in certain cases of the supplementary practicum sort. For 
instance, boys may learn to build concrete steps by building 
them for the school as well as by building them for the milk- 
house at home, they may learn to paint a clapboard building 
by painting the school house as well as by painting the barn 
at home, they may learn to put in a lock or a pane of glass at 
the school quite as well as at home. But in every case the 
home job should be given preference where it exists. School 
jobs of vocational type probably can take precedence only over
-P-A-G-E-289
  
COOPERATIVE JOBS 289 
those of the same kind for farmers or others not parents of 
pupils in the group. 
Finding Jobs.—Finding jobs for boys is one of the diffi- 
culties reported by ‘‘ green ” teachers. Such a report indicates 
that the teacher is not in the proper touch with pupils and 
their homes and with farmers in the community. It is usually 
based on a verbal or written statement from boys at the be- 
ginning of the year, in response to the question: “ What have 
you got in the way of jobs that need to be done at home?” 
The “live” teacher can in one round of visits among his 
pupils and of half a dozen farms in the neighborhood find so 
many and so varied jobs that his task is reduced to selection 
and the planning of sequence. One of the jobs may often be 
the establishment of a farm workshop at home, which can be 
used throughout the course and thereafter, in many cases. 
Codperative Jobs.—Shop teaching is, and ought to be, 
individual teaching for the most part. It can be effectively 
made group teaching, as happens under a unit organization, 
only if members of the same class are engaged in like jobs, 
particularly those that can be carried on at school. The 
drawing and planning work can almost all of it be carried on 
effectively at school, if the teacher has made close observation 
of individual home conditions by which to check working 
plans. But there is another kind of group work often seen, 
which calls for unusual care. That is the sort seen in “ class 
projects” of construction and repair. The writer visited 
a famous normal school in which much was made of 
codperative jobs. The job in hand that day was the setting 
in of an already completed door frame—a one man job—but 
twelve students “codperated ” with the teacher in doing it. 
That is, one handed him tools and materials as he requested, 
another drove a few nails, and the rest looked on. At another 
school, an agricultural school, a “codperative project” in 
19  
-P-A-G-E-290
  290 FORMS OF TEACHING 
building was on. . Twenty-four boys worked at building a 
three-section hen-house, the floor of which had been laid 
before the writer’s arrival. Everyone did work, too, for the 
teacher was a good boss, but two boys spent their whole time 
at cutting rafters, two at cutting studding, two at cutting 
plates, two at laying off studding, four at setting studs, two 
at transporting and handing up cut lumber, two at setting 
plates, three at setting rafters, and one at nailing tie beams, etc. 
The construction went forward very rapidly, but no one boy 
learned very much of building a hen-house, and that was the 
sole “project” in building construction for the class. Three or 
four boys working in rotation of jobs from beginning to com- 
pletion of that house might have become reasonably competent 
to undertake the building of a hen-house. The same criticism 
can be made of a job in laying a concrete walk at a school, in 
which sixteen boys took part. There were altogether too many 
boys at the job for any one of them to learn much, even of 
so simple a problem. The interdependence made manifest 
in such undertakings and the codperative spirit invoked may 
have been of some worth, but the situation was so abnormal 
that the likelihood of “carry over” to a vocational situation 
is small. Even the most ardent adherent of the cause of 
“ codperation ” will hardly call upon farmers to organize in 
squads of sixteen or twenty-four to do a job in which the 
codperation of three or four only is really useful. | 
Shop Mathematics.—The small amount of mathematics 
required for the special problems of shop work can probably 
best be taught in immediate connection with the jobs in which 
it functions. The organization of special courses in shop and 
agricultural mathematics for vocational students in agriculture 
seems to the writer a wasteful measure. But there is plenty 
of room for reasonable difference of opinion in the matter 
since regular instruction in arithmetic and high school mathe-
-P-A-G-E-291
  
EQUIPMENT 291 
matics is so variously effective. Yet the success of boys in 
shop work in which no specialized formal mathematics is 
required is not to the observer any less than that of boys of 
whom such requirement is made. 
Equipment.—With respect to equipment of the school 
shop a word may be said. The tools and benches should be 
those and those only which are appropriate to the farm shop 
on the kind of farm for work on which the school prepares. 
Such can hardly be the case under a state wide requirement as 
to equipment. After ten years of rather diversified experience 
in using a farm shop as a part of farm equipment, the writer 
finds himself unable to recall the use on a single occasion of 
half a dozen tools in one of the most widely approved lists, and 
there are three tools in the list the names of which carry no 
meaning to him, or to any one of four other men of farm 
experience to whom he submitted them for definition. Per- 
haps those are tools which every farmer ought to have, but 
that they are tools without which most farmers can get along 
very well is beyond a doubt. The old time manual training 
benches of the desk and drawer type should never be pur- 
chased, even if they be tolerated for a time in a school new 
to the work. Good substantial rough benches of the farm 
shop type proposed by Mr. L. M. Roehl* (though some teach- 
ers may prefer the ordinary bench vise) will serve much 
better, and may be built by the teacher and boys if necessary. 
It is doubtful that any shop needs more than one forge, and, 
perhaps, it does not need that if a nearby forge is occasionally 
usable. The appropriateness of forge equipment to most 
farms is doubted by close students. Even the low figures 
reported in Doctor Struck’s study} in the coal-bearing state 
of Pennsylvania may be regarded as far zbove the norm for 
most regions. Of course, the case of corporate farm em-

-P-A-G-E-292

292 FORMS OF TEACHING 
ployees, and employees of large ranches in isolated regions 
may represent quite another state of affairs. For such it may 
be well to train blacksmiths, but a blacksmith’s is not an agri- 
cultural vocation even on a farm. Hot metal working is 
seldom a job which it is either imperative or economical that 
the farmer undertake. 
Problem Approach.—It is to be remembered that most 
jobs of farm construction and repair cannot be standardized, 
as are factory jobs. The present problems are to be solved 
not by turning to page 27 of such and such a bulletin or 
manual and doing as there told. The farmer must determine 
himself exactly what needs to be done, what tools and 
materials he may most economically use, how he shall “ go at 
the job,” and, of course, what the job will cost in time and 
money. It is desirable, then, that the vocational training he 
receives shall establish in him an attitude and method of 
approach to problem solving in construction and repair jobs, 
such as may reasonably be expected to carry over into prac- 
tice. If his training consist wholly in task accomplishment 
with an attitude of dependence upon a master and a method 
habit of prescription-filling, then he is hardly to be expected 
to avoid floundering, when thrown upon his own resources. 
Accordingly, even in such cases as are fairly standardized, as 
the making of poultry feed hoppers or nests, it is well that 
the formulation of the problem and the hypothetical means 
to its solution be worked out by the student before he is 
furnished with any manual of directions. Such directions can 
be used, then, as a check upon his hypothesis for confirmation 
or modification of the plan which he has conceived. A range 
of jobs undertaken to meet the individual needs of pupils 
under particular and varied home conditions, necessitates an 
approximation to problem procedure, and both pupils and 
teacher benefit by the call for initiative and resourcefulness.
-P-A-G-E-293
  ROPE WORK 293 
Old Stuff.—Teachers are urged very strongly, and prop- 
erly, to teach boys to use the material that they have. If a 
hopper can be made satisfactorily out of old boxes, by all means 
let it be made of old boxes. But there must be kept in mind 
a true measure of economy. The time of the efficient farmer 
is worth something at any season of the year. If it costs more 
to “ get out and work up” material on a farm than it does to 
buy and haul material in workable shape, then it may be better 
to split the log for posts or cord wood, “ bust-up ” the boxes 
for kindling, and to buy new material. Second hand “ stuff ” 
is by no means always economical to use, at a low first price or 
no price at all. One teacher had his boys pull and straighten 
nails from old construction. Even at war prices it is doubtful 
that economy was thus served. 
Rope Work.—Of the tying of knots and other rope work 
a good deal is made in some schools. There are a good many 
rope skills that are useful in the various vocations of agricul- 
ture, some of almost universal applicability like the hitching 
knot, the half-hitch, and the splicing, whipping and crowning 
of ropes, others of only specialized application, like the sheep 
shank and the casting hitches. The selection of a few 
appropriate rope skills, such as are indicated in Farmers’ 
Bulletin 638, rather than of the full list of the achievements 
of a deep water sailor of the clipper ship era, and the mastery 
of those few, is an important matter. The appropriate time 
for teaching of such skills is when an immediately prospective 
occasion for their use arises. Because they are for the most 
part readily acquired and the mastery of them by most boys 
is a matter of some pride, teachers are somewhat prone to set 
apart one or two of the shop periods wholly for rope work, 
and during those periods to attempt the teaching of all the 
desirable skills, if not of some of doubtful value. The result 
is usually confusion and waste, as any teacher who has used
-P-A-G-E-294
294 FORMS OF TEACHING 
the procedure may demonstrate by calling two weeks later for 
bowline, running noose, hog snout, and other specific ties 
taught in the lesson. Interfering bonds are set up by attempt- 
ing a series of ties before one has been fully mastered, and 
many boys will be able to tie the granny or the bow knot only, 
which they learned before they came to school. To limit the 
number taught at any one time to one or two, with recurrent 
practice till the skill is fixed, is a much more economical pro- 
cedure. Rope work teaching distributed in brief lessons over 
a year or over the course in accordance with the work prob- 
lems that arise is much more likely to be effective than a teach- 
ing of all rope work in one or two shop periods. Twenty years 
ago a sailor taught the writer in a day of calm at sea to tie and 
throw some thirty knots and hitches. A year later he was able 
to demonstrate but four of them to a curious friend. To-day 
there are but two he can make—both of them knots that have 
been of frequent use in the interval. But a friend who almost 
as long ago “ picked up” the knots as a sailor on an eight 
months’ voyage can still make any of them quickly and easily, 
though he has not been to sea since. 
Demonstration.—It is perhaps worth while to emphasize 
a point already raised in connection with demonstration in 
farm practicum teaching. The teacher should be sure in 
making a demonstration for the guidance of pupils in shop 
work that every boy can see and hear. That is not an easy 
matter unless the group is kept small. Anyone who has 
attended the crowded demonstrations of farmers’ week at an 
agricultural college, can remember how at some critical point 
in which he was interested some spectator or the demon- 
strator himself thrust an impervious shoulder between him 
and the movement he desired to see, or how the demon-: 
strator’s voice sank too low or was drowned out at the 
important point. 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING 295 
It will have been noted that as examples of shop work 
so-called have been cited instances of what is often classed as 
laboratory work. In every case, however, the work cited is 
such as would be performed by the shop teacher, if a separate 
teacher were employed. But the distinction is arbitrary and 
not very important. In the same way the writer would 
include those problems and exercises indoors and out which 
are sometimes classed as laboratory work in farm mechanics 
or agricultural engineering, such as are used in the study of 
farm machinery, farm powers, farm drainage or irrigation, 
farm sanitation, and road-making. Laboratory work is re- 
stricted to include those problems and exercises which seldom 
are carried on outside the laboratory itself (including the 
school plot, if one be used) and which in the main deal with 
agricultural aspects of biological or physical science, and are 
parallel in procedure to the laboratory work of those sciences. 
Agricultural Engineering—The writer does not feel 
competent to evaluate in any specific detail the content of the 
work in “ agricultural engineering.” But the same principles 
as have been repeatedly set forth and illustrated must hold, 
both with regard to selection and method of teaching. Farm 
machinery for the most part is relatively “fool proof” as 
regards its operation, and requires little more than incidental 
instruction in that respect. But in the selection of farm ma- 
chinery there are large and important implications in the field 
of physics which account for the differences in durability, 
effectiveness, and economy of various machines and imple- 
ments. Strength of materials, temper, elasticity, friction, 
leverage, etc., open up problems calling for considerable study 
arid development of scientific insight. Many of those prob- 
lems will lead directly to studies in mechanics, heat, electricity, 
within the field of physics, and suggest the necessity for a 
close understanding in regard to subject development between
-P-A-G-E-296
  296 FORMS OF TEACHING 
the teacher of agriculture and the teacher of physics, in order 
to the fullest effectiveness of the teaching of both. Ordinary 
teaching in agricultural engineering lacks the “ thought con- 
tent” of physics; the usual teaching in physics is formal, 
abstract, and dead, because of lack of genuine problem content. 
Though the operation of most farm machinery calls 
for no great development of skill through instruction, the 
economical maintenance and up-keep of that machinery de- 
pends largely upon well developed skills on the part of the 
owner. Correct assembly, adjustment and readjustment, 
replacement of parts, lubrication, etc., call for useful skills. 
Further no discussion or interpretative evaluation of ma- 
chinery is possible in the absence of objective data in detail. 
A boy, for instance, who has not observed both the structure 
and arrangement, and the operation of a pitman, will not 
profit much from diagram, picture or reference reading con- 
cerning the pitman, but if he has made such observation, 
diagram, picture and text become meaningful and useful means 
to teaching. Thus shop and farm practicums with farm 
machinery are of basic importance to effective teaching. The 
function of the blackboard, the book or bulletin, the recitation 
and discussion is complementary to them, and chiefly waste 
without them. Let the work in teaching of farm machinery 
grow out of study of the machines themselves, not out of 
books about farm machines. 
The problem attitude is here again a useful one, rather 
than the prescription-filling so often evident in manuals of 
directions. ‘ Why is this cog set here? What work does it 
perform? Is the friction great or small? Is the speed high 
or low? What lubricant is required?” Such approach is 
preferable to: “ Note the position of G 14 somewhat below 
and to the rear of F 21. Note the diameters of G 14 and F 21. 
Lubricant appropriate—medium heavy.” Comparison and
-P-A-G-E-297
  
AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING 297 
contrast are useful means here also. The analogous parts of 
different machines can be compared and contrasted in the 
same way in which the characteristics of a cow are studied, 
as suggested under judging. Under high school conditions, 
to make use of the method economically, is, however, not 
always possible, for the reason that various types of the same 
machine cannot be placed side by side. But at least limitation 
to single types of machines or single machines, in lessons, is 
worth while. To go out to a farm or to a ware-house and 
“go over” every machine and implement in the place from 
the tractor and silage carrier to the hand-planter and spray 
pump is likely to be wasteful. It is probably better to know a 
few typical machines well than to have a bowing acquaintance 
_with “ 57 varieties.” 
The study of farm powers should grow out of the study of 
machines through which they are applied. In the present 
generation the internal combustion engine as a source of 
power is, unquestionably, the most important as a subject of 
study for most agricultural vocations. But electricity, steam, 
water power, and wind power have their place in specific 
instances. ‘’ Economy in availability and in application will 
determine utility for individual farmers, and a knowledge of 
the resources of the region will give the teacher guidance. A 
study of natural gas as source of power is futile for a New 
Hampshire dairyman if useful to one in western Pennsylvania. 
A study of electricity as a source of power is more likely to be 
useful in western New York than in western Kansas, and of 
wind conversely. But study of powers is relatively abstract 
and elusive, even in the case of fuels and water powers. It is 
information and the verification of information through obser- 
vation and occasional test that must serve. Many tests for 
horse-power by belts, draft, and lift, are so complicated and 
expensive, and far from accurately to be controlled, as hardly
-P-A-G-E-298
298 FORMS OF TEACHING 
to be worth the undertaking in high schools. Verification of 
reasoned conclusion must be had through printed records of 
authoritative experiment. For those reasons the teaching of 
farm powers requires careful thinking and planning on the 
part of the teacher in order that his pupils may not be lost ina 
meaningless maze of “laws and formulas.” Such can be 
brought to some significance by pseudo-problems. “ Which is 
the more economical here, a forty horse-power tractor run by 
kerosene or one of the same power run by gasoline? Which 
would you advise Mr. Smith to put in for pumping the water 
to his home and barn, a windmill, an electric motor, or a gas 
engine?” and the like. If, in any case, a pupil is confronted by 
a genuine present problem in powers, by all means it should be 
used. But only in the case of draft animals will that be a fre- 
quent situation. Problems of effective draft and load may be 
genuinely motivated through a vocational job. 
Farm surveying, with the use of the plane table, alidade, 
and level, and the construction of contour maps is sometimes 
made a part of the work of the secondary school. It is prob- 
able that in relatively few sections of the United States, with 
the exception of small irrigated and wet land areas and in the 
terraced areas of the South, will actual survey work, even with 
the simpler instruments, be found a standard practice of 
farmers. In large areas where drainage or irrigation is a 
fundamental means to reclamation such work is done by 
engineers. But with the growth of farm management studies 
and the work of the farm bureaus and the agricultural exten- 
sion service an increasing number of progressive farmers are 
undoubtedly making and using plane-table maps and even 
topographic maps for the more effective planning of their 
management schemes. It would be interesting to know how 
many farmers in a given region have made and used a home- 
made level such as boys are taught to make in our schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
    AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING 299 
But undoubtedly in the simple problems of drainage and irri- 
gation the use of such instrument is growing, and some skill 
with it will be found serviceable on a good many farms. 
That leveling and running a line of tile should be a part of 
the work in a majority of vocational courses in agriculture is 
very doubtful, but that it may sometimes be of individual or 
community use is not in question. Boys like the work, how- 
ever, if they can be actively engaged in it other than as 
rodmen. No outdoor practicum which the writer has used in 
teaching or has observed has commanded a greater interest 
than such surveying work carried on as a part of a larger 
practicum in a drainage job. If the work is not worth more 
than an exercise in plotting the school yard and sighting from 
stone to stump it probably should not be undertaken. Black- 
board instruction apart from field work is largely futile. 
A farm survey of irrigation practices may furnish the 
apperceptive basis of class instruction in irrigation, in a region 
where such is appropriate, but in the case of tile drainage it 
cannot so serve, unless a reclamation work is on which can 
be studied. Under-drainage as an engineering technic can be 
taught only through a problem in underdraining. The neces- 
sity for under-drainage and its implications, scientific and 
economic, belongs to the study of management or fertility 
rather than to engineering. Practicums of the sort may fre- 
quently be of the codperative type, since such represents a 
true vocational situation, but care must be exercised that rota- 
tion in the various jobs and responsibilities of the practicum 
be provided for in order that it may not be an exercise in sur- 
veying for one boy and in the use of the pick and shovel for 
another. If the class can undertake for a farmer the layout, 
survey and calculations, construct an outlet or two, join a 
lateral, and run a single line of tile, enough may be accom- 
plished, so that a new job in the future may be undertaken
-P-A-G-E-300

intelligently by any member. Certainly weeks of the time of 
the class cannot be given to the pick and shovel labor of con- 
struction necessary to the completion of the drainage, even of 
a single field. 
In spite of the fact that with the enlargement of under- 
takings in the making of highway and state roads the function 
of road building tends to pass into the hands of specialists, yet 
one of the frequent present activities of farmers the country 
over consists in the construction and repair of roads, particu- 
larly dirt roads, and with the repair and construction of lesser 
culverts. That the coming generation is likely to see the 
disappearance of that demand upon the farmer, even if it 
witness a diminution, appears to the writer highly improbable. 
A study of the significance of good roads and of the legislation 
and policy of the state concerning roads is important in the 
curriculum designed for the prospective farmer. But in the 
engineering aspect of his calling also road building enters. 
Here is a basis for valuable survey and practicum work both by 
the class and by small groups. 
Another field in many states is in the measurement and 
care of woodlots. “ Millmen” have grown rich, on the 
ignorance of farmers with respect to the value and conserva- 
tion of the woodlot. The ability to calculate stumpage on a 
board foot and cord wood basis is a valuable acquirement to 
many farmers, and one to which some time should be given in 
many courses. Jobs of the sort are easily discoverable in 
which the estimate of the class and the marking of trees may 
be of considerable service to the owner. Both road making 
and woodlot practicums are commonly left out of courses in 
regions to which they are distinctly appropriate.

  CHAPTER XVI 
FORMS OF TEACHING IN VOCATIONAL 
AGRICULTURE 
LABORATORY WORK 
In the “laboratory manuals” for secondary school agri- 
culture, particularly those published in the last few years, two 
facts are noticeable: (1) a tendency to the segregation of ex- 
ercise content to the field of a particular technological subject 
in agriculture, i.e., Soils, Farm Crops, Poultry, Feeding, Dairy 
Products; (2) a tendency to include a considerable proportion 
of exercises of the type for which a formal laboratory is un- 
necessary—that is such as belong to other forms of teaching, 
as the enterprise, or “home project,” the survey or field 
observation trip, or practicum, shop work, and the desk work 
of the class room, The suggestions thus offered are often very 
valuable. Of nineteen manuals for secondary schools prepared 
in the past six years and accessible to the writer’s desk, eight 
purport to deal with agriculture, three with farm crops, three 
with soils, two with dairy products, two with poultry, and one 
with feeding. Within the manuals are included 1052 exercises 
classifying by subject matter as follows:

Within the laboratory the purpose to be served by 
many exercises is the objective demonstration of facts or 
principles, in which time spent by pupils in technic is waste or 
mere “ busy work ” occupation, since technic is unnecessary to 
grasp of the fact or principle and plays no part in vocation. 
Time is saved and accuracy more likely if the teacher uses the 
method of demonstration. Exercises are classed as they stand, 
as heretofore, though many* with slight changes would prove 
equally or more effective if carried on under field or farm 
conditions. As examples the following may serve: 
The development of the chick in the egg ; 
Rise of water in soils; 
*Effects of freezing and thawing on a clay soil; 
The effects of a dust mulch on capillary rise; 
The porosity of soils; 
*The formation of clods; 
The presence of bacteria in soils ; 
*The effect of rolling on germination of small seeds; 
The relative value of large and small seeds ; 
The solubility of commercial fertilizers ; 
The composition of plants as food for animals ; 
The comparative effectiveness of various methods of 
creaming ; ; 
The source of milk fermentations.

  Of exercises conducted in the laboratory either by the 
teacher or by pupils a certain number, particularly in soils, are 
likely to lead to incorrect results or to false conclusions or both, 
some of them even with the use of apparatus expensive 
beyond their probable values. Such are: 
The influence of color on soil temperature ; 
The rate of percolation of water through various soils ; 
To show the flow of water in a tile drain system; 
To determine the rate of evaporation from different soils; 
Determination of percentage of capillary water at dif- 
ferent heights ; 
The effect of salt solutions on capillary movement ; 
The rate of air percolation through soils ; 
The effect of fertilizers through pot experiments ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
310 FORMS OF TEACHING 
  The effect of inoculation on pot grown legumes ; 
The determination of optimum water content in the soil. 
There are forty-four exercises of the kind in soils and one 
in plants. 
The extent to which duplication and similarity of exercises 
takes place may be judged from the major frequencies in 
plants and soils, as shown in the first fourteen manuals of the 
list. The facts indicate that in spite of the large number of 
exercises considered, the range in the laboratory field is 
quite limited.

It is noticeable that laboratory demonstrations and indi- 
vidual laboratory exercises are chiefly to be found in the 
subject fields of plant husbandry and soils, and that the pro- 
portion of them is high in dairy products. In the actual 
practice of schools, soils and plant husbandry hold first place 
and second, respectively, and dairy products a very minor 
one. In the high schools which make up the vast majority 
of secondary schools in which agriculture is taught, exercises 
in dairy products are limited ordinarily to making tests for 
butter fat in whole milk from herds or individual cows, and 
occasionally of skim milk, cream, and buttermilk. The train- 
ing of the relatively few to whom the technic of dairy manu- 
facture is significant in vocation is in the hands of special 
schools and colleges, wherein some excellent work is done. 
Soils exercises predominate for several reasons. In the first   
-P-A-G-E-312
       
   312 FORMS OF TEACHING 
place, the facts and principles of soils physics are of funda- 
mental importance in a wide range of agricultural vocations. 
In the second place, expensive apparatus is not required and 
the exercises are readily carried out under school conditions. 
In the third place, in the common manuals soils experiments 
find an early place, so that if any considerable number of 
exercises be performed those on soils are almost certain to 
be included. In the matter of plant husbandry the funda- 
mentals of plant physiology and plant control give the exer- 
cises equal place in importance with those on soils, and in the 
manuals and outlines used in schools they are equally out- 
standing. But, from an observation of teaching in some four 
hundred high school departments of agriculture the writer 
judges that they occupy a secondary place. The reason is 
not far to find. During several months of the school year 
the variations in temperatures of the school laboratory are 
such as to be destructive of growing plants, and green plants 
are not conveniently to be had during some five months in the 
northern states. Such conditions are not limiting in the case 
of soils. 
Exercises Belonging to Science Subjects.—Earliest 
among the plant exercises come the botanical studies, so that 
such make a larger share of the exercises actually used than 
is revealed in a study of the manuals. Some of the best botany 
teaching that is done in our schools is done under the name 
of agriculture, because so many botanical facts and principles 
are of significance in agricultural vocations. In no small 
measure botany in high schools has benefited by the swing 
from structural and taxonomical interpretation to physiologi- 
cal, as initiated in high school agriculture before the days of 
the Smith-Hughes Act. But in turn the plant husbandry 
studies have been influenced so that morphology and classifi- 
cation without regard to vocational significance appear to 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
    
DEMONSTRATION EXERCISES 313 
bring in exercises for boys in vocational agriculture, which if 
valuable at all, are equally valuable for girls who prepare for 
college. Now agriculture is not taught in the schools for the 
sake of botany, nor botany for the sake of agriculture. A well 
taught botany interpreted through instances of the plant life 
of the community is probably desirable for most high school 
students, not more so for those in agriculture than for others. 
It may be that the teacher of agriculture is in some instances 
necessarily or appropriately the teacher of botany, but agri- 
culture should not be made to include the botany which the 
pupils should have regardless of their enrolment in that par- 
ticular course. If “live” science teachers are employed in 
the school the present selection tends to duplication and waste. 
In one day in a single school the writer visited classes in 
chemistry, botany and agriculture, two of which were made of 
the same membership, and saw performed by pupils in all three 
the tests for protein, starch, sugar, and fat in plants. Elim- 
inating from the agricultural course the botanical exercises 
and putting them where they belong would set free a large 
total of time for vocational teaching in our high schools. The 
same criticism applies in less measure to the overlapping of 
agriculture in the laboratory with zodlogy, physiology, chem- 
istry, geology and general science studies. 
Demonstration Exercises.—A manual, or better, a num- 
ber of manuals in possession of the teacher should be a valu- 
able addition to his resources, if he make use of them 
intelligently. The range of suggestive practicums and desk 
exercises particularly which they offer is now large, apart 
from the laboratory exercises proper. Unfortunately the 
wealth of material in laboratory exercises, however, has not 
always proved a blessing to good teaching, if often a crutch 
for the weary or unambitious teacher. It is so easy to plan 
to keep the boys at work by assigning them a set number of
-P-A-G-E-314
  314 FORMS OF TEACHING 
exercises already formulated that many teachers have fre- 
quent recourse to the practice. The boys are kept at “ busy 
work ” a large part of which may be relatively unprofitable 
to them from an educative standpoint, and certainly from a 
vocational standpoint. The writer has been guilty in his days 
of high school teaching of allowing a class of boys to spend an 
entire afternoon in sifting soils, filling four long tubes, 
shaking, dumping out, refilling; and shaking again 
until perfectly compacted and uniform columns were ready 
for the determination of rate of capillary rise. He has had 
them spend half an hour in marking those tubes correctly to 
centimetre scale, and so on, for the demonstration of a law 
quite as easily made clear by an apparatus set up by himself 
for the whole class. That, and like performances on the part 
of teachers, he has witnessed again and again. There is a large 
share of exercises in which demonstration by the teacher is 
an economical and more effective method than individual pupil 
performance. Nor need pupils sit or stand idly to watch the 
fruition of an “experiment” set up at great expenditure of 
time by themselves, as now so often they do. If the teacher 
calls them up at the appropriate intervals for record of 
progress and keeps them at worth while work “between 
times” the full value of the demonstration can be realized 
with little sacrifice of time or serious interruption to other 
work, and often a decided gain to “ discipline.” Many of the 
soils and plant exercises are of so long duration that they can 
be handled economically in no other way. 
Individual Exercises.—But there is a considerable series 
of exercises in the laboratory which must be performed by 
the individuals either because that performance is necessary 
to the understanding of the fact demonstrated or principle 
illuminated (as in study of the corn ear or head of oats), or 
because the technic of the exercise as well as the fact or
-P-A-G-E-315
  INDIVIDUAL EXERCISES 315 
principle involved is of use vocationally (as in the Babcock 
test for butterfat, the beaker analysis of soils, or the testing 
of soils for acidity). 
Saving of time for more profitable activity is in the last 
case conspicuously, as well as in the first, to be effected by 
critical selection and evaluation of the exercises to be used, 
and the form of their use. Even the sacrosanct and tradi- 
tionally accepted should be carefully scrutinized in the light of 
the particular needs of the group who make up the class. The 
teacher must ask himself and answer satisfactorily to his 
conscience questions like the following. “ Do these boys need 
to know the percentage of hygroscopic moisture contained in 
clay, silt and medium fine sand? Will it make them more 
effective workers in their vocation or better satisfied work- 
ers? If so, shall I demonstrate the facts, make them work 
out the facts themselves, or refer them to standard experi- 
mental results? Can they afford the time for the most con- 
vincing teaching, or is there a more valuable use for that 
teaching time?” Again: “ Do these boys need to be able to 
perform the Babcock test, or will a demonstration serve their 
purposes? Are they going to have to test whole milk, skim 
milk, cream, or will they have their products tested for them? 
Tf the latter, will a performance of the test give them ability 
to judge the validity of tests made of their milk at the station? 
Is that ability to judge a gain to them as producers of milk? 
Will a demonstration give that ability? Or is the demon- 
strable fact that milk fat content is measurable and variable 
from sample to sample sufficient to their needs? Is the time 
required for performance or demonstration justifiably used?” 
According as the pupils expect to be producers of standard- 
ized milk, creamery patrons, poultry men, or market garden- 
ers, the answers will vary, as again they will according to the 
particular farm experience the boys have already had. There

is little doubt but that under such scrutiny in every instance 
the number of demonstrations and particularly of individually 
performed laboratory exercises will be cut down to a brief list 
of widely useful and a somewhat longer list of specifically 
useful exercises for every group. Then we shall have done 
away with the piddling waste that keeps boys in laboratories 
when they should be on farms, in the shop, or in the class room 
gathering data, acquiring skills, or solving problems significant 
to their present undertakings and future life work. The same 
criteria apply to the selection and evaluation of content in the 
laboratory form of teaching as elsewhere. We tend to over- 
look the fact as we do not in the forms previously discussed, 
because there is assembled so large a ready-made content in 
printed form. 
Aims of Laboratory Work.—It has been implied, but not 
yet made explicit, that laboratory work, as it is classified by 
the writer, belongs largely to the technology rather than to the 
art of agriculture. The acquirement of skill is sometimes a 
clear objective, but more frequently the objectives are other: 
(1) the acquirement of facts by “ objective” teaching, or the 
“ objective” illumination of a principle. (2) And closely 
allied to the first, the controlled verification of a conclusion 
tentatively accepted. 
Illustration of the first (1) is given in the following cases: 
(a) Showing that a clay compressed while moist forms a 
hard clod, (b) showing that the presence of coarse organic 
matter in a soil column cuts off the rise of moisture; of the 
second (2) by (a) the testing of unripe and improperly stored 
seed corn against ripe and properly stored seed corn to show 
that unripeness and improper storage do affect vitality of 
seed ; (b) after a field trip in which observation has been made 
that clover has failed in a certain spot “ because of acidity of
-P-A-G-E-317
  
AIMS OF LABORATORY WORK 317 
the soil,” testing soil from that spot to verify or disprove 
the conclusion. 
If we cut out of the laboratory list for agricultural stu- 
dents (1) those exercises which are appropriate to other 
high school subjects, (2) those that are useless from either 
the objective or subjective viewpoints of vocation, (3) those 
that appropriately belong to other forms of teaching, the total 
may be very materially reduced, probably more than fifty per 
cent. The remainder may be cut down to not more than 
one-fourth of its present size by elimination of duplications. 
Of the final fraction one-half at least of the exercises may take 
the form of demonstration. In both demonstration and indi- 
vidual exercises by pupils a considerable further cut may be 
made by critical selection and evaluation. It is probably safe 
to say that out of a thousand prepared exercises to be found 
in the manuals on the teacher’s shelf not more than forty will 
be found necessary to the use of his class in the laboratory at 
school, and that twenty or more of those he can set up and 
demonstrate to advantage, rather than require their perform- 
ance by the class. Obviously the reference is to high school 
classes, and equally so is the fact that few schools will use 
identical lists of laboratory exercises. 
There may be some few exercises that should be demon- 
strated or performed by the class in the case of every class in 
vocational agriculture everywhere. If so they are very few 
in number, and the writer, for one, is unable to designate any 
of them. But there are certainly a score or less having to do 
with soils and plant growth which are significant in a wide 
range of types of farming. Those will make a common sub- 
ject matter in laboratory work for many courses in agri- 
culture, and the remainder will vary according to the specific 
vocational aims of schools and courses. 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  
  318 FORMS OF TEACHING 
Equipment.—If the course of reasoning is sound it fol- 
lows that uniform equipment requirements by state authorities 
are something of an absurdity, except in the possible case of 
a state so uniform in character that all agricultural students 
prepare for the same vocation in agriculture. It is quite cer- 
tain that such a condition will never be found. On the other 
hand there may be found states in which a small series of 
identical exercises may be desirable for all high schools, and in 
such case a new standard minimum of equipment for the 
proper performance of those should be set. And it may 
reasonably be required that schools in their selection of specif- 
ically appropriate exercises beyond the common group shall 
provide adequate equipment to the carrying on of those exer- 
cises economically in time and effort, and with a prospect of 
results accurate enough to teach the lesson which it is proposed 
to teach. That teacher and pupils should be driven to the ash 
can and kindling wood pile to secure material for laborious 
construction of crude apparatus for the performance of 
“experiments ” is unjustifiable. If a school cannot afford a 
balance, for instance, more accurate than a boy can make, in 
school time or out, of the boards from a soap box, it cannot 
afford to use exercises in which weighing plays a part. The 
lining of shelves with tin cans and broken bottles may be tes- 
timony to the ingenuity of the teacher but it is also testimony 
to the slight value which school authorities set upon the work. 
A minimum original allotment of money and an annual 
allotment for laboratory equipment and materials is a reason- 
able requirement. But it is probable that such minimum 
should be determined for each school in the light of its needs 
rather than placed upon a state wide basis. 
The School Plot.—The school plot is another requirement 
sometimes made as to which a good deal of uncertainty exists. 
That a good many schools may benefit from the possession 
of a plot of ground upon which to grow readily available
-P-A-G-E-319
     THE SCHOOL PLOT 319 
material and conduct tests and demonstrations is not to be 
denied. But the fact remains that most of the material appro- 
priate to the study of plants and soils and fertilizers in a com- 
munity is available there to the reasonably resourceful teacher ; 
otherwise it is inappropriate according to the philosophy 
herein set up. It is not difficult to have experiments and tests 
carried out on farms where they must meet economic and 
vocational requirements, rather than those of the school plot 
wherein the labor of the teacher or boys is not charged, though 
it consist in highly wasteful and unrepresentative spading 
and hoeing. A uniform requirement of an acre plot, as has 
been suggested, appears to the writer as ridiculous. In prac- 
tice it imposes a burden upon the teacher not justified by the 
educative value derived. He is kept planting, hoeing and 
weeding during the summer, when he should be more profit- 
ably engaged with his boys in the field. So far as “ speci- 
mens ” go enough can be grown on an acre plot to supply the 
schools of a state. So far as community demonstration goes 
the school plot is seldom a necessary or effective means to it. 
The school plot is no substitute for the farms of the com- 
munity. It may bea factor in confirming the strong tendency 
of school teachers to keep teaching at the school, an un- 
fortunate tendency from the point of view of vocational 
education. But it may be that the school plot, if used 
intelligently, will prove a subordinate and minor factor, like 
the laboratory itself, to good teaching. 
Intelligent method in laboratory teaching is quite as im- 
portant to realization of its value as in any other form of 
teaching, but nowhere in the teaching of agriculture is appre- 
ciation of the fact less evident. Apparently the state of affairs 
is due, paradoxically, to the marked intrusion of method in 
prepared laboratory manuals. In fourteen of the nineteen   
  
-P-A-G-E-320
    320 FORMS OF TEACHING 
before referred to there is a set form in which each exercise 
is developed through the manual. Examples follow: 
Manuat A Manuva. B Manuva C 
1 Statement 1 Object 1 Purpose 
2 Object 2 Material 2 Plan

Manvat D Manvat E Manuar F 
1 Object 1 Object 1 Object

3 Method 3 Steps 3 Application 
4 Conclusion 4 Data 
5 Application 
In twelve of the fourteen an “object” or “ purpose ” is 
stated in the form of procedure, in the other two as the title 
accompanying the number of the exercise. The forms are not 
objectionable in many cases, nor in any particular helpful, 
except as they relieve the teacher of the necessity for planning 
—which may be as often objectionable as helpful. The chief 
weakness as well as in some cases the chief strength of the 
plan used is the definition of the object. Even in the same 
manual it varies from vague and useless to specific and useful 
in giving meaning to sequent procedure and possibly motive to 
action. For example: 
Exercise q 
A study of soil particles 
Object: To study soil particles. 
Exercise r 
A study of the oat head. 
Purpose: To examine panicle of oats, 
       
          
      
-P-A-G-E-321
       SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 321 
belong to the first group. The statement of object makes 
no gain at all over title, and to the pupil may very likely be no 
purpose at all. It is like the answer of the student in the 
“physical culture ” class. Teacher. “Miss Jones, what is the 
purpose of deep breathing?” Pupil. ‘“ The purpose of deep 
breathing is to breathe deeply.” 
Again, 
Exercise w 
Corn germination. 
Object: To determine which ears will germinate 
strongly. 
Exercise x 
Object: To prepare a commercial starter. 
Exercise y 
Mulching. 
Object: To show that a layer of loosened soil or of 
straw or manure prevents loss of water by sur- 
face evaporation. 
Exercise z 
Absorption of moisture by soils. 
Object: To show that some soils hold more water 
than others. 
These belong to the second group. At least the student 
perceives readily that he is “after” something. If that 
something be not pertinent to his present or perceived future 
needs yet his curiosity may be stirred. At any ‘ate it is 
normally far more satisfying to take up a task when he knows 
“what he is trying to do” than to undertake it because it is 
“in the lesson for today.” 
Specific Objectives—Whether a manual is to be placed 
in the hands of pupils, or a prepared copy of the selected exer- 
cise, or the procedure is developed on the blackboard or other- 
wise under immediate direction of the teacher, a specific 
21  
-P-A-G-E-322
    
    822 FORMS OF TEACHING. 
object in the undertaking, whether demonstration or indi- 
vidual exercise, particularly one that is pertinent to the solu- 
tion of problems of which the pupil is conscious, is the first 
requisite to success in laboratory teaching. That means in the 
first place that laboratory work, class-room work, and outdoor 
work must be at all times in significant correlation with one 
another, part of a unified lesson movement or problem-solving 
process. The running of class-room work, laboratory work, 
shop work and outdoor work on separate tracks and inde- 
pendent schedules is one of the chief weaknesses of present 
teaching. If we study in early fall effects in the field upon 
plants of packed and stirred surfaces, get round in December 
to giving a recitation period to capillary movement, evapora- 
tion, and mulches, and come to the laboratory demonstration 
in February, we have a fairly typical case, but one in which a 
lack of unity is manifest. The setting apart of regular periods 
for laboratory work and the running through of a set number 
of exercises in a year are largely responsible for the present 
situation. Asan example of unity, suppose the pupil to have 
come in his enterprise to the problem of cultivating his sprout- 
ing corn. When, how often, how deep, with what teeth on 
the cultivator should he cultivate? That is a time at which a 
demonstration of mulch effect and recitation discussion of 
capillary movement and evaporation is appropriate. 
Preparation.—In the second place, it means that the 
teacher must give attention to the “ step of preparation” of 
the class, raising questions and discussion in advance which 
bring out the pertinence of data to be sought, the specific need 
of the exercise or demonstration in order that a motive to its 
undertaking exist, that a significance be given to the pro- 
cedure, and a focus to attention and observation. The old 
mystery procedure, “ Follow directions explicitly and note 
carefully the results,” will not get the student very far. Or,
-P-A-G-E-323
    DEMONSTRATION 323 
“Note down carefully everything that you observed in this 
demonstration.” It is the pertinent results that should be 
noted, not all results. For example, in the demonstration of 
the effect of mulches it is the fact that rise of water stops at 
the mulch line, or that the unmulched specimen is wet at the 
surface and loses water, whereas the mulched specimen is dry 
at the surface and does not change weight, that is important, 
not that the soils change color, that they shrink or swell, or that 
the water advances on one side of the tube more rapidly than 
on the other. If the student is merely ordered to observe and 
does so it is perfectly reasonable that he should note the lat- 
ter results as of equal importance with the first, but if he has 
a specific purpose in seeking the pertinent data the first are 
those noted as significant. 
Clear Results.—The fact may be here emphasized that in 
such demonstrations or individual exercises clear and positive 
results must be reasonably expected. If an exercise or dem- 
onstration does not furnish the data sought or show the results 
for which it is set up it is somewhat worse than useless. 
Most teachers who have had laboratory experience with plant 
and soils “ experiments ” will appreciate the importance of the 
matter. We hark back, then, to careful selection and evalua- 
tion, and come forward to the need of careful planning and 
preparation in the formulation of exercises and the setting up 
of demonstrations. 
Demonstration.—Where technic is a part of the acquire- 
ment which an exercise is intended to give, and demonstration 
precedes individual trial and practice, the laboratory demon- 
stration is on a par with that cited for the practicum. But 
when the object is simply the showing of a fact, the illumina- 
tion of a principle, or the testing of a conclusion, the “ pat- 
tern” idea is not present. Clean cut results in the light of a
-P-A-G-E-324
  324 FORMS OF TEACHING 
known and pertinent purpose for the student, with full oppor- 
tunity to see, to handle, to weigh, as the case may demand, are 
the prime requisites of a good laboratory demonstration. 
Directions.—The use of directions has been discussed 
under shop work, and the laboratory work is in much the same 
case, with one exception. If technic is of subsidiary im- 
portance it is probably not worth while to encourage the 
student to plan out an appropriate technic of his own, in the 
light of which directions may be interpreted and used, if not 
modified. The established technic is ordinarily quite appro- 
priate and better than any the student could devise 
after an expenditure of considerable time and effort. If 
he knows what he is going after the technic will usually 
prove intelligible. 
Note-books.—A word may be said of note-books. For- 
tunately the teacher of agriculture does not have to turn over 
a set of note-books in agriculturai laboratory work to a college 
examining officer. Fortunately, too, the craze for note-books 
on the part of state authorities and supervising officers is 
dying. In consequence the teacher is free to think of the note- 
book as a means to teaching and not as a product of teaching. 
If a note-book be used to record results of exercises in their 
appropriate application to the solution of the students’ prob- 
lems, rather than as a picture book of apparatus and a 
certification of “ covering the ground,” it may serve a useful 
purpose in teaching. It will, however, be smaller than the 
present norm, and not so thick, and considerably more worn at 
the edges. Neatness, accuracy, and probably brevity, as 
against diffuse scribbling, are properly to be insisted on, 
because those characteristics contribute to the utility of the 
note-book, not because they make a more favorable impres- 
sion on an inspection agent.
-P-A-G-E-325
  NOTE-BOOKS 325 
In sum, then, good laboratory work is worth while pro- 
vided it be no substitute for something better. The cutting out 
of non-significant, misleading and “busy work” forms of 
laboratory teaching ; formulating exercises in pertinent prob- 
lem connection, and using rather than storing the results of 
laboratory “‘ experiments,” those two will greatly diminish 
the time given to laboratory work in most schools and greatly 
increase its educative value from the vocational standpoint.
-P-A-G-E-326
  CHAPTER XVII 
QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING 
In every form of teaching herein classified the question 
has a possible or frequent use. Formally it comes most to 
attention in the recitation, review and examination work of the 
class-room, but it is no exclusive possession of one form of 
teaching. In order that no intent may appear to place it in 
such singular association, and with the hope that separate 
treatment may not appear to set it in a category by itself, there 
is here attempted a brief discussion of the nature, function, 
and use of questions. 
Suppose I meet a farmer on the road and hail him. “‘ How 
do I go from here to Stoneman’s farm? What is a fair figure 
on that second growth chestnut of his?” My questions may 
make him think, vociferate, gesticulate, miss a hot supper, be 
late with the milking and savage with the wife, but all that is a 
matter of secondary if any concern to me. I ask the question 
to get action which is useful to me as asker, to get a response 
that will help me in satisfying my own needs, whether they 
may be of business or curiosity. I am not concerned with the 
effect of that action upon the person I ask. 
On the other hand you call up a boy who is about to start 
an enterprise in poultry. ‘“ How many hens are you going to 
house? What are the dimensions of the house you plan to 
use?” You ask the questions, too, because you want action, 
but this time action for the boy’s sake and not for yours. It 
makes no serious difference to you whether his hen house is 
overcrowded or not. But you wish him to be affected by the 
action which your questions call forth in him, in order 
326 i
-P-A-G-E-327
    QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING 327 
that he may more appropriately meet the problem of housing 
his fowl. 
The first case exemplifies the use of the question in ordi- 
nary affairs where we use it as a means to determining our 
own course of action; the second case, the use of the 
question in teaching, where we use it for determining the 
course of action in pupils. : 
In either case there must be action if the question be genu- 
inely a question. We do not put questions to stone walls and 
fences because we know that our voices will evoke no re- 
‘ sponse. They are not to be stimulated. But getting a 
response by putting a question to a man who can hear does 
not necessarily indicate that we have really succeeded with 
the question. Suppose the man I hailed on the road were a 
German who knew not a word of English. He answers, 
“Ja. Das ist recht.” But I have asked him no question 
despite the fact that I have addressed him with rising inflec- 
tion. He responds to the fact that I have spoken and not to a 
question. Suppose, again, he were a city salesman, who never 
heard of Stoneman and does not know a second growth chest- 
nut from an apple tree. He answers, “Search me.” He 
knows that I intended a question, but it is no question for 
him. The question which is good in form for the purpose for 
which it was planned is futile in producing the effect desired. 
There is lacking that common basis of understanding 
between questioner and questioned, which is necessary to make 
a question a communication between man and man. 
There is no more frequent fault among us teachers than 
“ shooting over the heads ” of pupils because we fail to “ talk 
their language,” to use terms that carry meaning to them like 
to that which they bear in our experience. For to get a 
response, if it be in some sense to make the question function, 
is by no means to make it a teaching question. To get the
-P-A-G-E-328
  328 QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING 
response which, for the sake of its effects on the pupil, we have 
designed to get, that is the test of success in questioning. To 
do that we must be more than intelligible, we must rouse by 
our words meanings in the minds of pupils like to those which 
they rouse in us. Clearly we cannot do that except there be 
in the lives of teacher and pupil similar experiences to which 
the word symbol is attached. That is the significance of 
common basis of understanding. 
An example of a question, futile because of lack of 
common basis of understanding is furnished in the following 
anecdote. County Agent Jones went out to address a meet- 
ing in a strange town on “ The Use of Fodder Crops in Milk 
Production.” To make a good “ practical hitch” at the 
start, to prepare his hearers, he fired a question, “What sort of 
" roughness do you folks here use with your cows?” Promptly 
a black coated gentleman arose. “ You mistake us, sir. Our 
people are one and all humane in their treatment of 
God’s creatures.” 
To a question a pupil may respond in any one of a thou- 
sand ways: by picking up a tool, going to the book-shelf, 
writing a paragraph, “ answering ” orally, sitting silent, ask- 
ing a question in his turn, etc. If the particular thing he does 
is the thing we desired to have him do, then from the point 
of view of purpose and communion, the question was good. 
One successful question is, intrinsically, as good as any other. 
Yet, if we consider effects, questions like all other means, 
are subject to relative values. To secure useless modifica- 
tions is clearly less worth while than to secure the manifestly 
useful. To produce a small useful change in attitude, ” 
knowledge or skill by a question, is less valuable than to pro- 
duce a large useful change. In that sense questions equally 
effective in accomplishing the purpose of the teacher are quite 
unequal in value. In the case of a boy preparing for dairy
-P-A-G-E-329
  
QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING 329 
farming the second question in the following pair is clearly a 
better question than the first: (1) “ Which was the larger, 
Eohippus or Protohippus?” (2) “ Which was the larger, 
Holstein or Ayrshire? ” ; both of the following are superior to 
either of the first pair, and the second is better than the first: 
(1) “ How do you feed a cow before calving?” (2) “ How 
do you determine what breed to keep?’’ Accordingly it is not 
altogether useless to consider the current advice of educators 
with respect to “ forms ” of questions. 
1. By the law of chance, if you drew from a basket ballots 
marked “yes” or “no” respectively, the number of each 
being equal and the ballots well mixed, the basket might well 
pass an examination by questions calling for the answer 
“yes” or “no.’”’ Such questions are to be avoided because 
they may involve the minimum of action on the part of pupils 
and give encouragement to wild guessing. 
On the other hand, the answer in a monosyllable may be 
the result of prolonged and extensive search, selection, weigh- 
ing and reflection on the part of the pupil. In answer to 
such questions as “ Shall I buy the Stevens’ bull? ” or “ Shall 
I sell my most productive hen?” for example. But because 
such activity is not observable by the teacher, since all that 
he may have to go by is the answer “ yes” or “ no,” it is well 
to be cautious in the use of that form of question. It is a 
great help to be sure that we have gained the response in action 
that we designed to get. 
There is one case, however, in which the “ yes” or “no” 
form of question is occasionally worth while. That is in the 
precipitation of discussion. To call for the answer to such a 
question as, “Do you advocate the use of the summer silo 
in this community ? ” is to place the pupils definitely in a posi- 
tion which each must justify, affirmative or negative, to open
-P-A-G-E-330
330 QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING 
up the pros and cons of what may be for them as dairy farmers 
a significant matter. 
2. The simplest means to getting the “answer” that you 
desire is to suggest that answer plainly in the question. “Is 
not protein the prime nutrient in cotton seed meal?” An 
utter ignoramus, if he desired to please the teacher, as 
most pupils do, would answer, “ Yes, sir, it is.’ Action on 
his part is at a minimum and effect also. Yet every question 
must suggest, in some way, the action which the teacher pur- 
poses. Otherwise it is meaningless; he has failed to find the 
common basis of understanding, to make it a question for the 
pupil at all. Particularly in preparation, in stimulating recall, 
pertinent and fairly specific suggestion in the question is 
useful. If after a study of feedstuffs, for instance, the 
teacher plans in to-day’s work to take up a problem in balanc- 
ing a ration, it is better to start with some specifically sug- 
gestive questions like: ‘“ What high-protein by-products did 
we find purchasable here? What succulent feeds did we dis- 
cover to be most commonly used?” than with, “ What did we 
find out last week?” or, “ What do you remember about the 
last lesson?” It is the question which answers itself or very 
nearly does so, the extreme form of suggestive question, which 
should be avoided in teaching. 
One caution must go with acceptance of the statement that 
success in questioning is measurable in proportion to the exact 
achievement of the response desired, to which end the sug- 
gestive question lends itself so readily. Many teachers tend 
to insist upon a particular word or phrase in answer to a 
question, and will go to great lengths to secure it. Only rarely 
is such procedure justified, since our language is highly 
flexible and rich in equivalent words and phrases. If the pupil 
recalls the fact, makes use of the principle, or develops the 
thought, which we intended to stimulate by the question, then
-P-A-G-E-331
  QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING 331 
it is unnecessary, confusing to him, and wasteful of time, 
if we force him to reroute the process of association until he 
shall have arrived at exactly the statement which pleases us. 
3- Questions requiring oral or written statement of “ in- 
formation” are the most common in school practice. To 
them much objection is made, and rightly. When, as is most 
frequent, they call for “information” merely to satisfy the 
teacher, without significant use of that information by the 
pupil, they are largely waste. To “render unto Cesar that 
which is Czsar’s ” is valuable to the pupil only in proportion 
to the useful effect the rendering has upon him. It is the pupil, 
presumably, that needs the information, not the teacher. 
“What are the principal crops of Nebraska?” “ How many 
farmers hereabouts use stave silos?” are futile questions if 
they do not result in data actually usable to the pupil and seen 
by him to be so usable. One case is probably an exception, 
the rare case in which the “ fact ” is so frequent and so vital 
an element in the situations which the pupil must meet, that 
rote memorization is desirable. There are few “ multiplica- 
tion tables” in vocational agriculture, except in certain 
terminology such as “ roughage,” “concentrate,” “ rotation,” 
and the like. Here it is doubtful that question and answer 
is the best means to the drill needed. 
4. But, whereas the teacher is cautioned against the 
yes” and “no” alternative, the leading and the informa- 
tional forms of question, he is often urged to the use of the 
thought provoker. There is no merit merely in producing 
thinking activity. Except the thinking be pertinently useful 
in the discovering, selection, evaluation, and organization of 
data, to an end significant to the pupil, and, in our case, to 
vocation, reflective thinking induced by a question is no more 
valuable than wrath and waving of arms induced by the same 
means. A “problem” in quadratics as such we may reject, “
-P-A-G-E-332
  $32 QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING 
in the case of the vocational student in fruit growing, as less 
valuable than the least of the questions herein cited. But are 
we in much better case, when, to cite an actual class-room 
example, we stimulate thinking thus: “ If 109 trees, at twenty 
foot intervals, can be planted in an acre field, how many trees 
can be planted on a seven acre field at forty foot intervals? 
Take your time to figure it out correctly.” For ninety-nine 
pupils out of a hundred the question is purely academic. Not 
in a thousand years would a fruit farmer be called upon to 
establish the required number of trees for his orchard by any 
such method ; if he remembered the per-acre unit discovered 
in solving the problem and used it in a twenty acre block, he 
would face the necessity of “ rushing” a new order to com- 
plete his planting. The “problem” is no problem for the 
fruit grower, the method suggested is incorrect in that it im- 
plies a mathematical rather than a diagrammatic situation, 
and the result is misleading as a factor in a genuine orchard 
setting problem. Yet the pupil who “ solves” that “ prob- 
lem ” must think. 
Sometimes the desire to provoke thought by questions 
leads the teacher into deliberate puzzling of his pupils. The 
writer once heard a teacher of agriculture reply to a boy who 
complained that he could not understand an examination 
question, “ Of course you can’t. That question was written 
to make you think.” The attempt to formulate thought-pro- 
ducing questions compels the teacher to steer between the 
Charybdis of the hypothetical, with its specific detailed 
premises, and the Scylla of vague generality. No attempt is 
made here to illustrate by a genuine problem question, for the 
reason that no question of a teacher can constitute a problem 
for the pupil. The best we can do is by our questions to sug- 
gest problems, which, willy nilly, must, to stimulate useful 
thinking, be felt and formulated by the pupil. The safest

guide is to put ourselves as nearly as we may in the place of 
the pupil, to look with him, rather than at him. Our nearest 
approximation in formal questioning to a genuine pupil prob- 
lem must, except by chance, be with those questions designed 
for particular individuals, as John, with his sixty White 
Rocks, his crowded yard and broken-down lean-to against the 
barn. If we formulate “ problem questions ” to “ hit” every 
member of a class, we are likely to “ miss” all of them. But 
we are more likely to succeed in suggesting problems, which 
do produce useful thought, by class questioning, if we consider 
particular groups having much in common. A question for 
“my ten first year boys now buying their hens” stands a 
better chance of service in thought production than one for 
“first year students in poultry;” the latter than one for 
“students in vocational agriculture.” Such questions we 
should try to formulate when our purpose is to stimulate use- 
ful thinking. That is often, but not always. 
In questioning a class the object must be to stimulate 
activity in every member of the class. Not infrequently 
teachers neglect the fact in class procedure. If the teacher 
prefaces his question by calling on an individual pupil, as 
“Now, Perkins, how do you account for the difference in 
yield between these two?” the class becomes Perkins, and the 
rest settle back to rest until Perkins is “done.” If, on the 
other hand, the question be addressed to the class, and only 
after a proper pause, Perkins or another, whose “turn” is 
not definitely known to the class, designated to reply, every 
member of the class is in some measure stimulated by the 
question, since he may be held to oral reply. Ideally, of 
course, the matter is unimportant since if every question were 
so pertinent and vital in its significance to the needs of every 
pupil as to command his attention no preliminary designation 
of the “answer ” would make any difference, but so long as  
-P-A-G-E-334
    
    334 QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING 
classes are conducted by fallible human beings and not by 
demi-gods, it remains of considerable importance. 
Harking back, in the same connection, to the fact that oral 
teplies to questions convey data or information of value to 
students rather than to the teacher, it becomes necessary that 
replies be addressed to the class rather than to the teacher. If 
question and answer be a mere series of dialogues between 
the teacher and successive pupils much of the value of the 
method is lost. 
One other point in respect to class questioning may be 
raised. Teachers must so formulate and phrase the questions 
and so clearly voice them that no rephrasing for the boy who 
“ didn’t understand ” the first time or repetition for the one 
who “didn’t hear you” is necessary. Much time is wasted, 
at present, for lack of care in the matter, and a habit of wait- 
ing for the second or third statement, or even of “ stalling,” 
because a repetition is sure to be forthcoming, is easily set up 
on the part of pupils. To mumble a carelessly formulated 
question and then refuse to restate or repeat is tyranny on the 
part of the teacher; to state a question clearly and well, but 
just once, is economical and just. 
With the emphasis put upon the value of thought pro- 
voking questions in recent years, and with the broadcasting of 
“ project outlines ” in question form, has come to some teach- 
ers faith is a mystic power of motivation through questions. 
There is no magic in the interrogation point, or in the rising 
inflection. Motive comes through stimulation of native and 
acquired interests, through discovery of purpose by pupils. 
The question is but one means to such stimulus, to securing the 
response in action that we seek. It should be used only where 
better means cannot be used. It is to be remembered that a 
very small part of the vocational activity of the farmer will 
consist in answering questions put by another. He must do
-P-A-G-E-335
    
QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING 335 
jobs and solve problems, not tell some one how he would do 
the job or solve the problem. 
Even for review—the seeing and organizing of experi- 
ences in a new light—and for test, both of which are functions 
of examination, it is not at all certain that the question is 
always the best instrument. “ Draw the plans of a poultry 
house for twenty-five hens.” That is an imperative, not a 
question. Yet it may suggest more problems in respect to 
proper housing, short as it falls of the actuality of building, 
than could be raised by a half dozen carefully devised ques- 
tions to the same end. To cull a flock of twenty hens in two 
hours may well develop and test a greater range of useful 
abilities than could the most full and careful black-board 
examination on culling, whatsoever. 
Most of us teachers ask too many questions, and answer 
too few. When every question we ask is a good question and 
worth asking, we shall ask many less and have many more to 
answer—a by-effect of the increased action we are getting. 
The index to the success of a teacher is in the activity that his 
teaching inspires. No surer measure of that activity is to be 
found than in the eagerness and intelligence of pupils in ask- 
ing questions of teachers, fellows, men and women, books, and 
things—a type of activity in which the successful farmer is 
continually engaged. If by questioning or other means the 
teacher of agriculture has roused his pupils to active question- 
ing in all that pertains to vocation in agriculture, he is 
approaching that ideal status, wherein he “ abdicates ” and 
becomes witness and critic of the process of learning.

CHAPTER XVIII 
FORMS OF TEACHING IN VOCATIONAL 
AGRICULTURE 
THE CONDUCT OF CLASS-ROOM INSTRUCTION 
So much has been written concerning class-room manage- 
ment and the conduct of formal teaching under class-room 
conditions that but a relatively brief and suggestive treatment 
is attempted here. For it is to be recognized that work in 
agriculture is subject to the same rules of sound procedure as 
prevail in good teaching in other subjects of a scientific and 
social content in the high school. The teacher of agriculture 
has, however, an advantage of other teachers under the pres- 
ent organization of the high school in that he may readily 
preserve the continuity of educational development from 
extra-class-room to class-room teaching. So much of the data 
of experience is acquired in fashion known to him and directed 
by him outside the class-room that his opportunities for the 
stimulation of initiative in evaluating and organizing 
experience through class-room activity are unexcelled. 
: Economy and Discipline.—A problem that the beginning 
teacher meets and one that is constantly with him throughout 
his teaching career is that of class-room management. Two 
principles govern here as they do in most of his work: The 
principles of economy and of discipline. He must so control 
conditions that the least of waste in time and effort on the 
part of pupils and of himself during the teaching period re- 
sults. He must so control conditions as to maintain an order 
of conduct on the part of pupils appropriate to learning in 
group surroundings. 
336
-P-A-G-E-337
ECONOMY AND DISCIPLINE 337 
Now the factors that make for such control of conditions 
are much the same in respect to economy and to discipline, 
and most of the tenets of good teaching are likewise appro- 
priate to them. But there are several that deserve special 
recognition in connection with good class-room management. 
1. The first of these is procedure governed by clear and 
definite purposes known to the teacher ; the second, like to the 
first, clear and definite purposes known to the class. Given 
such there can hardly be utterly wasteful activity or behavior 
entirely incompatible with learning. 
2. Yet very much can be done to facilitate both economy 
and discipline by careful attention in advance and throughout 
to physical conditions. If a class is to keep ready to the 
accomplishment of a purpose it must be free from physical 
discomfort and distracting stimuli. Proper seating and 
arrangement of seats, proper. ventilation and lighting and 
heating, are factors of no mean significance to success. 
3. Materials necessary to the accomplishment of class- 
room objectives must be appropriate and readily accessible if 
the most efficient work is to be done. The waste and con- 
fusion that come from hunting out materials from a closet or 
cabinet, from sending pupils out for books, or chalk, or an 
eraser, from cleaning off the black-board, unpacking a crate, 
and so on, after the lesson objective is fairly established, is 
often large. Moreover, it is a fairly safe rule that materials 
not pertinent to the job in hand should not be introduced 
during the teaching period. Many a well started lesson has 
been spoiled by the act of the teacher in passing out papers 
corrected from the last “ quiz,” in unrolling a new chart, hang- 
ing up some new specimens, starting the drawing of a diagram 
for future use on the board, and the like. The teacher who 
has started well a class problem in which attention to him is 
the thing least needed or desirable, sometimes from mere 
22

  338 FORMS OF TEACHING 
sense of the necessity for keeping busy obtrudes himself con- 
stantly on the attention of pupils and becomes more distracting 
than a flapping window shade or a mouse on the corn rack. 
Meaning of Lesson.—The work of the class-room is 
largely the “ learning of lessons.” We use the word lesson to 
cover a multitude of cases, yet it is very difficult to define what 
we mean by a lesson. But in any pedagogical sense a lesson 
cannot be regarded as determined by an arbitrary limit of 
time, such as the forty-five minutes allotted to a class period, 
nor by a set number of pages, paragraphs or lines read. Stated 
somewhat abstractly the limits of a lesson are determined by 
the teaching and learning procedure necessary to the accom- 
plishment of a specific content objective. Already content has 
been defined as consisting in a series of immediate objectives 
or “ proximate aims ” to be realized as mediate instruments, 
or, in another aspect, necessary steps to the attainment of 
more remote aims in education, such as are formulated in 
advance of the organization of a curriculum, or more par- 
ticularly of a course of study within that curriculum. For 
example, suppose the curriculum to be determined by the aim 
to prepare for service to society and self-realization a pros- 
pective dairy farmer in Lee County, Illinois. Subordinate to 
and contributory to the accomplishment of that aim would be 
the aim of preparation for the economical management of 
dairy cattle, calling for a course in dairy husbandry. Within 
that aim again, and necessary to its accomplishment, would 
be that of developing ability in the economical feeding of milch 
cows, which would make dairy cattle feeding a part of the 
course organization in dairy husbandry. Now among the ob- 
jectives to be realized as a means of effective dairy cattle 
feeding are perhaps: (1) Knowing the available protein con- 
centrates of Lee County, (2) knowing the available legu- 
minous roughages, (3) evaluating available prepared dairy
-P-A-G-E-339
  MEANING OF LESSON 339 
feeds, (4) evaluating a ration in use by dairy farmers of Lee 
County, (5) formulating a ration for a twelve hundred pound 
cow yielding at freshening forty pounds of 3.2 per cent. milk, 
(6) planning a silage-corn planting for thirty cows for six 
months’ barn feeding, (7) determining the size of a silo neces- 
sary for such a herd, etc. Each of those specific objectives 
might be attained wholly or largely through teaching and 
learning procedure carried on in the class-room, just as cer- 
tain others must be attained through enterprise, survey, or 
practicum, shop work, laboratory, or through a combination 
of several or all the forms of teaching. Such according to the 
interpretation of the writer constitute lessons. Clearly not 
all of them can be of equal length either in time devoted to 
reading or study or in time devoted to other activity in the 
class-room. Some may not require a forty-five minute period 
in the total. Others must continue through a sequence of 
several such periods. Class periods are not founded upon the 
normal lesson requirement, but upon a standard more or less 
empirically derived of the normal period during which active 
attention on the part of adolescent pupils is maintained ‘with- 
out undue effort on the part of the teacher or strain on the 
part of the pupil—a matter of importance concerning which a 
great deal is yet to be learned, but one which does not define 
the time scope of a lesson. 
Yet a conception of the class-room lesson still far too com- 
mon is illustrated in the following example: 
Teacher standing behind desk opens the text-book at 
page 141. 
Teacher: “ What is the relative importance of the oat crop 
in the world?...... Berry.” 
Berry: “Oats is the fourth crop of importance in the 
world, only potatoes, corn and wheat being more important.”

Smith: “To a cool humid climate.” 
Teacher: “In what states are oats an important crop, even 
outranking wheat or corn?...... Johnson.” 
Johnson: “In the states east of the Mississippi river and 
north of the Ohio, particularly in several of the northern tier.” 
Teacher: “ Place the continents in order of their produc- 
tion of oats...... Watson.” 
Watson: “Europe, North America, Asia, Australasia, 
Africa.” 
Teacher: ‘“‘ Which are far and away the most important? 
pb tight Jameson.” 
Jameson: “ Europe first, North America second.” 
Teacher: “ What is the world’s annual production of 
oats?...... Jameson.” 
Jameson: “ Almost four billion bushels.” 
Teacher: “ Three billion eight hundred and thirty-four 
million one hundred and eight thousand for the period 1906-10, 
but that is approximately correct. What are the six countries 
leading in oat production?...... Gray.” 
Gray: ‘The United States, Germany, France, Austria- 
Hungary, the United Kingdom.” 
Teacher: “ Which country produces the highest yield per 
acre? How much?...... Williams.” 
Williams: “Germany. Between forty and fifty bushels.” 
Teacher: ‘Which produces the lowest? About how 
much?” 
Williams: “The United States. From twenty-six to a 
little over twenty-nine bushels.” 
Teacher: “ What proportion of the world’s crop do these 
six countries produce?...... Merriam.” 
Merriam: “ About four-fifths of the world’s crop.”
-P-A-G-E-341
  MEANING OF LESSON 341 
Teacher: (Continues turning pages slowly, to ask 
questions concerning every topic and paragraph of the chap- 
ter, calling upon every pupil in more or less regular rotation 
to recite. Finally closes the book.) 
“You have done very well to-day. For next time study 
Chapter XXI. Be sure to study the questions at the end, for 
I am likely to ask you some of them, and everybody will be 
held responsible for them in the quiz when we finish oats. 
You are dismissed.” 
That is what is known as “ lesson hearing,” rightly charac- 
terized by Doctor Colvin as the “lowest and least efficient 
aspect of teaching.” Yet in the illustration are shown what 
some teachers have considered: (1) A complete lesson, i.e., 
the “ covering of the ground” allotted to a forty-five minute 
period. (2) A good recitation, i.e., a definite showing of the 
pupils in their answers that they have read the “lesson” and 
“know ” it. (3) A clear and definite assignment, i.e., state- 
ment of what they are to study for next time. 
The “lesson”? was Chapter XX on Oats: the recitation 
was a quite full and accurate rendering, piecemeal, of the con- 
tents of that chapter into words much like those of the text; 
the assignment was Chapter XXI on Culture of Oats, in- 
cluding the questions at the end. Assignment, study, recitation 
(lesson one) ; assignment, study, recitation (lesson two) ; as- 
signment, study, recitation (lesson three), and then a written 
quiz on all three lessons. That is the procedure or something 
like that, in thousands of high school class-rooms to-day and 
in scores of class-rooms of agricultural students, three or five 
times weekly throughout the year, as the case may be. 
Obviously, if such be good class-room teaching, it is ab- 
surd that school boards should hire experienced farmers and 
agricultural college graduates to teach in their class-rooms. 
Any reasonably bright girl of good personality, graduate of

  342 FORMS OF TEACHING 
the classical or home economics curriculum of a high school 
could do such teaching as well as the most highly trained agri- 
cultural expert, and would do it for a considerably lower 
salary. So long as agricultural teachers conceive of an assign- 
ment as an order to read so many pages or paragraphs of text; 
study as reading that text sufficiently often to be able to give a 
fair repetition of “ what the book says ” ; and teaching through 
recitation as asking questions calling for a quasi-literal oral 
statement of the contents of any dark print line, line in italics, 
paragraph or summary table, printed in the text read; and 
that such triple groupings make a lesson, so long will the 
money of the public be wasted. Something more and better is 
expected of trained vocational teachers. 
Recitation.—The first task of the teacher in the organiza- 
tion of class-room work is to determine which form or forms 
to use, most appropriate to the objects he has in view. To do 
this he must understand at least the general purposes or types 
of objectives to which each of the common forms is appro- 
priate. The first of them is the recitation. Unfortunately the 
term is so far from having any standardized meaning that its 
recognition as a form of teaching is confused and difficult. It 
is sometimes employed to indicate any process of instruction 
carried on in the school. Again it is any process of instruc- 
tion apart from that of laboratory, shop, or field instruction. 
Under the last and commonest use it covers lesson-hearing, 
topical or problem discussion, lecture or formal telling, review 
and examination, all types of procedure in greater or less 
measure distinct from one another. Hence, if a teacher de- 
cides to reach a certain objective through “ recitation” he is 
still very far from having decided how he is to attempt the 
realization of it. In its original and probably its most accurate 
meaning recitation means just what it says, re-citation. From 
the study the pupil has made of text or other sources, or from
-P-A-G-E-343
  
RECITATION 343 
the information given him by teacher or another person, he 
cites again or hands back to the teacher what presumably he 
has already learned for his own good and not for the 
teacher’s. It is primarily a testing by the teacher of the ability 
of the pupil to say over again what an author, a lecturer, or the 
teacher himself has said to him. It is most nearly the “ lesson- 
hearing ” which has already been illustrated. That it is on the 
whole the lowest and most ineffective, as well as in subjects of 
the academic type the most common form of teaching, does 
not indicate that it is on all occasions and for any purpose 
useless. It has in many instances a distinct value, not in teach- 
ing a lesson, but in preparing the pupil to learn a lesson. To 
call back freshly to mind data that are pertinent to the attain- 
ment of the lesson objective it may serve frequent and useful 
purpose. If the teacher elects to use re-citation he should use 
it with a distinct purpose of the kind. It is to be noted, how- 
ever, that merely to call back an item in the same associations 
in which it was originally found, for example those of a para- 
graph of the text, is rarely of great value in the case of 
agriculture. The purpose then achieved is that of mere repe- 
tition for the sake of memorization or drill in a group of asso- 
ciations frequently to be met by the pupil, or otherwise of great 
significance as a possession of the learner. There are few spell- 
ing or multiplication types of association in agricultural tech- 
nology. Drill is more often appropriate in the skill teaching 
forms where relative perfection of automatized response is de- 
sirable. Most frequently in agriculture the need is to call back 
an item for the sake of making with it and the group of associ- 
ations in which it is already bonded, new associations. That 
is, primarily the purpose is make new bonds in connection with 
old rather than to strengthen old bonds merely. Or stated in 
another way we bring back to mind by re-citation already 
acquired experience in order to add to that experience, “ re-
-P-A-G-E-344
  344 FORMS OF TEACHING 
construct ” that experience, or both reconstruct and add to 
that experience. For example, we may ask pupils to recall 
from a text paragraph on the relative solubility of nitrogen 
carriers the place of nitrate of soda, in order to connect with 
that fact the fact of its relatively rapid loss from the soil; and 
to construct the facts into usable grouping in the calculation 
of the rate, frequency, and times of application of nitrate of 
soda in the treatment of hay lands in this particular com- 
munity of sandy loam soils, late and cold springs, and heavy 
summer rainfall. Merely to strengthen the memorization of 
the solubility table is by no means the purpose of the re- 
citation question, though incidentally that strengthening may 
in some measure be accomplished. 
Telling.—Telling, or even formal lecture, has a place of 
value in the work of the class-room. It is a weak form of 
teaching chiefly because of the relatively small activity ordi- 
narily called forth by it ina group of pupils. When, as is too 
frequently the case, the teacher attempts to “ do it all” in the 
class-room, the result is apt to be disastrous. One of the most 
frequent causes of inattention and disorder reported in the 
recent survey of rural high schools in New York was the habit 
of teachers of spending half or more of the teaching period in 
talking. Telling has a place in adding new and usable and 
pertinent data to be organized through other forms of teach- 
ing. It should not be used where other and economical means 
to the acquirement of those data exist. It is wasteful, for 
instance, for a teacher to do what the writer has several times 
observed, namely, to give in oral lecture the contents of a chap- 
ter or bulletin, and then to refer the class to that chapter or 
bulletin at the close of the lecture. A certain emphasis, of 
course, can be given to topics by a good lecturer that cannot be 
given by a mere unguided reading of the material. But that 
emphasis can be as well or better secured by a proper super- 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
    TELLING 345 
vision of study in which the pupil is guided to make his own 
evaluation instead of having the teacher’s thrust at him. 
There is frequent occasion for the supplying of usable in- 
formation pertinent to solution of a problem in hand. Infor- 
mation, for example, acquired through the teacher’s personal 
experience and not available in printed form is often more to 
the point and of more interest to pupils than anything that can 
be secured from reading or other sources. There is the case, 
too, in which the teacher can in a few words supply just what 
is needed to keep the movement of the lesson continuous, 
whereas if the class were required to “ dig out” the data the 
movement would be interrupted and a large amount of time 
consumed. Relatively in such a case the telling is more 
economical teaching than assigned reading. A word of cau- 
tion must be inserted here, however. Teachers may assume 
that such cases are frequent, or even go to the extreme sug- 
gested by one man who was doing what appeared to be very 
creditable work in the class room. He said “I give them the 
facts and then make them use those facts. I can give them the 
facts faster than they can get them in any other way, and 
because they know they are going to use those facts they pay 
close attention and get them.”” Not looking beyond the class 
room very far he has made a good case. But he has over- 
looked the aim of teaching the boys to rely on their own re- 
sources in the discovery of the data which they need for use. 
When they go out into farming nobody is going to stand by to 
tell them just what they need to know whenever they meet a 
problem calling for data which they do not already possess. 
One of the chief resources which formal teaching should 
furnish them, the ability to hunt out efficiently for themselves 
what they need to know, is denied by such teaching, though 
they may pass excellent examinations and do very creditable 
project work under such a system.
-P-A-G-E-346
  346 FORMS OF TEACHING 
One of the most frequent excuses for the formal lecture is 
the need felt by the teacher for summarizing and organizing 
the material of class instruction. Some very carefully pre- 
pared and excellent presentations in summary organization 
are made by teachers of agriculture. The teacher who makes 
such learns a great deal. But the case of the pupils is different. 
A pupil acquires an organization of knowledge, summary or 
other, very much in the degree to which he has made such 
himself. If a teacher desires his class to possess a body of 
knowledge in a certain form it is his work to see that they 
acquire it and put it together in that form, not to formulate 
and present it himself. Organization and summary are 
processes. Except pupils go through those processes they do 
not acquire summary and organized knowledge. The few 
and exceptional pupils who do, apparently, acquire by “ ex- 
posure ” do so not by absorption, but by an active process of 
their own to which they are stimulated by the “ exposure.” It 
is a rare teacher whose lecturing is so appropriate to individual 
needs of his pupils, so directly appealing to their own 
experience, that any large proportion of his pupils is stimu- 
lated to activity that is as great as could be secured by other 
means of teaching. 
Topic Discussion.—Topic discussion is one of the most 
effective forms of class-room teaching used by teachers of 
agriculture. The effective use of it, however, does not quite 
match with the name. Motivated discussion may occur under 
a topic through the use of problems logically belonging there, 
or a topic may be discussed profitably and in interested fashion 
because it is pertinent to a problem in the solution of which 
pupils are engaged. In either case it is the problem which 
moves the discussion and makes it something other than recita- 
tion or telling by the teacher. Problem discussion involves 
chiefly the organization and evaluation of pupils’ experience as
-P-A-G-E-347
  EXAMINATIONS 347 
contrasted, for example, with the recitation and lecture forms 
of instruction. If genuinely motivated it provides an excellent 
opportunity for the use of initiative and resourcefulness, for 
contribution of divers individual experiences and for com- 
parison and contrast of data and standards of evaluation. 
Some of the best, in the sense of being resultant of most appro- 
priate activity, of the teaching of high school subjects in the 
class-room that the writer has seen has been problem dis- 
cussion by groups of farm boys under topics of agricul- 
tural technology. 
The name “ round-up ” sometimes used for what purports 
to be that form of teaching is more than outwardly appro- 
priate. But the adoption of “ round-up ” as seen in practice 
is often very disappointing. Rather than constructive contri- 
bution and argument by a group pertinent to a common prob- 
lem, the “ round-up ” takes the form of individual reports by 
pupils upon topics totally unrelated of which they have read 
in agricultural papers or in bulletins or books. Sometimes 
even the topics reported upon do not fall within the general 
field of class study. There is no unity or system, problem, or 
arrival at solution. 
Examinations.—An examination may serve either one of 
two general purposes, or preferably both at the same time. 
Teachers ordinarily conceive of the examination as a means to 
testing the acquirements of the pupil and thereby to judge the 
success of their own work as teachers. The faith of the pub- 
lic and of the great body of teachers is amazing. In some of 
our state, city and county systems the written and the oral 
examination play almost the part that they do in official life 
in China or did in the Prussianized Germany of before the 
war. The professional success of the teacher and his chances 
for recognition, reward in promotion, prolonged tenure, and 
so on, are dependent upon the ability of his pupils to make
-P-A-G-E-348
  348 FORMS OF TEACHING 
a creditable rating in the periodic examinations set by author- 
ity. Schooling becomes a preparation for the “ passing” of 
the county, the state, or the college entrance examinations. 
Fortunately agricultural instruction is as yet limited in very 
small measure by any system of externally imposed exam- 
ination. But teachers of agriculture have come up through 
a school and college system wherein examination is a domi- 
nant factor. Most of them carry over to a considerable extent 
into their teaching the influence of the procedure under which 
they were taught, and in consequence the passing of examina- 
tions is still made by them a measure of the ability of their 
pupils and of their own success as instructors. 
With the growth of the science of education and the 
detailed and controlled testing of pupil achievement, recogni- 
tion of the limitations of the examination as a means of testing 
is spreading. Unfortunately, however, more attention has been 
given to the inadequacy of teachers’ judgments of the results 
of examination, or school marks, than to the examination 
itself. Every student of educational psychology is now 
furnished with abundant evidence of the unreliability of 
teachers’ ratings, and that of others also. He is also led into 
the study of methods of testing mental traits that are object- 
ively much more dependable than the run of examinations, 
though few of them are usable in the field of agricultural 
teaching as yet. But the fact that relatively little value can 
be set upon a test of ability made through response to a situ- 
ation largely unlike that to which the examined ability is 
appropriate is insufficiently emphasized, though it is a direct 
corollary of the demonstrated theorem that education is a 
matter of specific changes in human beings. The ability to 
state in written or oral speech certain facts and principles is 
still too often taken as a measure of the possession of such 
facts and principles in vocational or other usable connections.
-P-A-G-E-349
  EXAMINATIONS 349 
The boy who can do the job has no advantage in the matter of 
school rating over his more fluent fellow who can state clearly 
the facts that the teacher conceives to be of possible use in the 
doing of the job; in fact he is often in a position of relative 
disadvantage. In the matter of receiving credit for entrance 
to the agricultural college, for instance, is still to be found an 
example. The possession of capacities for scholarship is prob- 
ably closely related to possession of capacities for vocational 
proficiency, but demonstrated abilities in one field should not 
be confused with demonstrated abilities in the other. But 
vocational schools still give higher values to scholastic abilities 
that have been demonstrated in examination than to vocational 
abilities that have been demonstrated in practice. Agriculture 
does not suffer to the same extent as some other vocations. 
Farm experience, for example, is probably given greater recog- 
nition in the agricultural colleges than teaching experience in 
the colleges of education. 
If the examination is to serve as a test of the improve- 
ment or of the total proficiency in abilities agricultural, then 
it must in itself present a situation involving just those re- 
sponses in knowledge, skill, etc., which it has been the aim of 
teaching to develop. Now if the responses be genuinely voca- 
tional as is implied in the undertaking of teaching in so-called 
vocational courses, it is clear that the test situation must itself 
be of the genuinely vocational type. In the case of manipu- 
lative skills other than such as are involved in the use of the 
pen or pencil it is fairly clear that no genuine test can be 
made by oral or written examination. Yet in a recent survey 
of the work of vocational teaching in agriculture, several men 
reported that they tested for the possession and development 
of skills by means of written “quizzes.” Where attitudes 
and knowledge functionally necessary in the control of 
manipulative skills are involved, it would seem equally clear  
-P-A-G-E-350
    350 FORMS OF TEACHING 
that the actual testing situation must be one calling for 
manipulative processes to the use of which the attitudes and 
knowledges to be tested are necessary. Many of the voca- 
tional attitudes and knowledges which constitute the objectives 
of agricultural teaching fall in such a category. Yet the 
practice of testing the knowledge and attitude of the pupil by 
putting him “ up against the job itself ” is comparatively rare. 
Written examinations in the judging of dairy cattle, in the 
culling of hens, and even in the filing of saws, have come under 
the observation of the writer. It is not argued here that such 
written work as is involved in the common type of oral or 
written examination is wholly useless from a teaching stand- 
point, but only that such work is not a test of knowledge or 
attitude in any genuinely useful sense. There is another and 
perhaps more useful purpose in the examination than testing, 
but an examination of the sort indicated set up for test is well 
nigh futile. 
There are undoubtedly cases in vocational teaching where 
the use of the written or oral examination constitutes a rela- 
tively valid test of the acquirements of pupils. A farmer, for 
example, in planning a rotation may work with pencil and 
paper and with or without a map. The execution of the rota- 
tion plan is not to be confused with the making of the plan 
itself. In the same way the laying out of a plan of building, 
of manuring, of labor distribution, may be accomplished under 
very nearly the conditions of the class-room. Very often, of 
course, the teacher cannot set the pupil to the making of the 
very plan which later he as a farmer or project worker is to 
put into practice. But it is hardly to be disputed that the 
teacher can set him to the making of a plan of the kind that 
later on he will have to make. Such a test, as it clearly in- 
volves the technological content of the course, is undoubtedly 
a good one. There is a great deal of the technology of agri-
-P-A-G-E-351
   EXAMINATIONS 351 
culture which primarily is appropriate to the making of plans 
for the solution of farm problems, so that the written or oral 
type of examination if designed to bring out the appropriate 
responses in the appropriate vocational grouping, has a proper 
place in agricultural teaching. Tests calling for a point of 
view and the selection and organization of facts and prin- 
ciples to the solution of a typical vocational problem are found 
at present, perhaps, more frequently in the case of farm man- 
agement than in the other subject studies of the agricultural 
course. But there is no good reason that examination for 
ability to state facts should remain typical of dairy husbandry, 
animal husbandry, fruit growing, farm crops, or even soils. 
The fact that the text treatment of farm management is gen- 
erally on a better vocational basis than that of the foregoing 
studies lays less burden on the teacher than with them, but 
does not decrease his opportunity for making a strictly appro- 
priate test organization in much of the technology of the older 
and more fully standardized subjects of the agricultural 
course—if his work be under a subject organization. 
Now an examination may perhaps be more often effect- 
ively used as a means to teaching than as a test of teaching. 
The really good examination will as an incident to its teaching 
purpose undoubtedly often have some testing value. As a 
teaching means the most useful purpose of the examination is 
in the organization of data of experience, school taught tech- 
nology or other, into a unified grouping with respect to a voca- 
tional purpose. Given the problem, or pseudo-problem, of 
laying out a certain farm where conditions are known to the 
student, of planning a rotation under known conditions, of 
feeding a herd under known conditions,of planning a building 
for a known purpose and within a known cost, etc., the stu- 
dent is called upon to assume a set or attitude, to summon and 
evaluate knowledge, to organize that knowledge into a system     
  
-P-A-G-E-352
    
   FORMS OF TEACHING 
  352 
of the type which will function in carrying out the work of the 
farm. Thinking of a high order, and what is more significant, 
a vocationally typical order, will be involved in such exam- 
inations. The student who makes the evaluation and the 
organization, who does the thinking, has given evidence of the 
possession of valuable vocational acquirements at the same 
time that the bonds of acquirement are being strengthened, or 
even for the first time joined. In that sense the teaching 
examination is also a testing examination. 
Review.—The last statement with regard to examination 
suggests the close relationship of the teaching examination 
with review procedure. In so far as the student is called upon 
in the examination to organize from a new point of view, or 
in a new relationship, the data acquired through previous study 
and teaching, to that extent he is reviewing his studies. Re- 
view, then, is interpreted as a looking back upon the ground 
passed over, not from the original or starting point, but from 
the point reached in the process of covering that ground; the 
field is viewed in a new and not in the same aspect. The simile 
has value in that it indicates review not as a leap back to the 
starting point and a retracing of the steps of learning, but 
as a regrouping of bonds or associations already formed 
into some appropriate system. Procedure in review, 
in such interpretation, is again of the problem type. So far 
as it is desirable to strengthen the bonds of factual acquire- 
ment or other units of usable skill or knowledge, the problems 
used for review must be well selected and comprehensive. 
Either a few or many problems must be set calling for the use 
of the bonds or associations which it is desired to strengthen, 
and placing them in usable groupings. Thus the planning of 
the placement, layout, yarding, and housing of a flock of given 
size on a given farm may involve an excellent review of studies 
in poultry plants and equipment. Or a group of less compre-   
-P-A-G-E-353
  
  SUPERVISED STUDY 353 
hensive problems may be given, such as providing a watering 
system for the same flock, providing for the convenient and 
economical storage and handling of feeds for the flock, equip- 
ping a house for the flock, etc. 
Doing again the same thing, reading again on the same 
topics in the same text in the same order, are more nearly 
typical of what teachers call review than the foregoing. That 
sort of thing is not review, but drill. As has been pointed 
out there is little call for it apart from certain of the skill 
teaching in agriculture. Selective repetition made satisfying 
by pertinence to a recognizable achievement, or true review, 
on the other hand, is very valuable if used in connection with 
important skills and meanings. 
Supervised Study.—An increasingly common and useful 
part of the teacher’s work in the class-room is the conduct of 
study lessons in which pupils assemble from text and reference 
publications data usable in carrying out of projects and solu- 
tion of problems. Such lessons are organized in terms of 
assignment and reference. To conduct such lessons success- 
fully the teacher must: (1) know clearly the purpose which 
he designs to accomplish ; (2) know. what data are most likely 
to be significant in the accomplishment of the purpose set for 
the class or individual pupils, in what publications those data 
are available and where; (3) make such publications as he 
selects .as usable conveniently accessible to pupils. The per- 
formance of those steps in advance of the assembly of the 
class is an excellent means to the economy and discipline 
necessary in good management of a class-room study lesson. 
The first procedure with the class consists in the assign- 
ment. But the assignment is a major factor in other forms of 
teaching than the supervised study of the class-room. Accord- 
ingly the following discussion is generic rather than specifi- 
cally confined to the consideration of supervised study. 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  354 FORMS OF TEACHING 
Assignment.—The assignment is that action of the teacher 
which causes the pupil to formulate a purpose or specific aim 
to be achieved, and to organize and carry out the activities 
necessary to the achievement of that purpose which gives 
form and unity to a lesson. The purposes of pupils and 
teacher may often be by no means identical, but both purposes 
must be achieved if the lesson is to be a success. Assignment 
is sometimes defined as the giving of clear directions to the 
pupil as to just what he shall do and how he shall do it when 
not in contact with the teacher. So specifically to direct the 
pupils may often be a useful function of assignment,but never 
the whole function. First, the assignment must suggest a pur- 
pose to be fulfilled, often a problem to be solved, must pro- 
voke the need and suggest the means to specifying clearly that 
purpose or defining that problem. Second, the assignment, 
thus having given motive to the acquirement of data in ex- 
perience, must suggest the means to such acquirement, either 
through recall of pertinent experience—knowledge most fre- 
quently in class-room lessons—which the pupil already has, or 
the action necessary to acquirement of new data—such as 
reading, figuring, questioning persons, observing—and must 
suggest, or with beginners often specify, the sources from 
which such data are to be derived (books, persons, things). 
Third, the assignment, having through the setting up of a 
specific purpose given motive to the evaluation and organiza- 
tion of data to the achievement of the purpose or solution of 
the problem, must suggest (with beginners often specify) the 
manner in which that evaluation and organization may effect- 
ively be carried out. Crudely stated, the assignment stimulates 
and directs the attention of the student to “ the why, the what, 
and the how,” of the lesson. In other words and in the best 
sense it “sets the pupil for the lesson.” The work of the 
teacher in supervision of study and recitation to say nothing
-P-A-G-E-355
       REFERENCE 355 
of forms of teaching other than class-room teaching, hinges 
entirely upon the assignment. It is his work to aid and ensure 
the carrying through of the learning activity by which the 
purpose of the lesson is to be achieved, of which the assign- 
ment is the prognosis. That is, assignment and the carrying 
out of assignment through the interplay of teacher and pupil 
activities constitutes the lesson. Of all the work of the 
teacher the assignment is the most fundamental and important. 
Forms of assignment are quite variable, whether the as- 
signment be made orally or in writing on the black-board or 
through prepared typewritten sheets handed out to pupils. A 
fairly safe rule is that the pupil should be possessed of some 
sort of written record, either prepared in part by the teacher 
and given out after oral discussion by teacher and class, 
or in the form of systematic notes made by the pupil in an 
assignment book, which makes a part of his regular 
school equipment. 
Reference.—The point has been made that with beginners 
it is necessary to specify the data of reference, if in books by 
title, chapter and page or paragraph, if with persons, by name, 
if with farms by name and location of the particular field, 
crop, building, or animal. To do so is a primary means to 
teaching the pupil to accomplish his purpose, or how to study. 
But to continue minute specification of sources in the assign- 
ment with the same pupils in the same subject over any 
considerable period may well defeat its very object. If the 
accomplishment of a lesson purpose become for the pupil a 
routine process of following directions given, then, assuming 
that the purpose is one, as it should be, of a type such as may 
reasonably be anticipated in life apart from school, the prop of 
direction having been withdrawn when the pupil is “on his 
own ”—no longer under charge of a teacher—he must almost 
inevitably flounder. He has learned one method of studying    
-P-A-G-E-356
    
    356 FORMS OF TEACHING 
so well, that he does not know how to study, and that 
process which as a rightful acquirement of school training 
should be useful to him in life is discarded in the abrupt change 
from the irresponsible performance of school tasks to the re- 
sponsible performance of life tasks. 
Accordingly it becomes of first rate importance that the 
teacher shall by degrees abdicate his responsibility in the 
furnishing of specific sources of data in assignment in order 
that the pupil may progressively assume a larger and larger 
responsibility for the discovery and use of sources, going 
forth at graduation a student able to command, without direc- 
tion, the resources within his reach. One of the simplest 
means to that end is for the teacher to make his pupils aware of 
his own methods in discovering the sources of data to which, 
in the assignment, he refers them. How he used the book 
list to discover the particular book, how he used the index or 
the table of contents to discover chapter and page, how he 
knew that Mr. Brooks and Mrs. Adams possessed certain 
useful information, how he discovered the farm sources, those 
things it is the duty of the teacher to make clear. Then, by 
degrees, his assignments, in their reference to sources will 
become less and less specific so long as the kinds of sources 
remain the same, until setting the problem or purpose becomes 
the sole function of assignment. Thus, with books, the teacher 
may omit first specific page reference, leaving it to the pupil, 
given the chapter, to discover the parts significant to the 
lesson purpose; again he may omit the chapter reference, 
giving only the title, and finally the title itself. A like process 
may be followed in the case of persons and farms. As the 
pupil becomes more and more familiar with the range and type 
of resources open to him, and, by the use of indexes, contacts 
with persons, and visits to farms, undertaken increasingly on
-P-A-G-E-357
  ORIGIN OF THE ASSIGNMENT 357 
his own initiative, with methods of discovery, he is set free 
from direction and becomes a student. 
Origin of the Assignment.—Ordinarily the assignment 
should arise out of preparatory discussion of a related prob- 
lem, or out of the needs for overcoming difficulties found by 
the student in his farm or study undertakings. It can seldom 
be precipitated successfully out of a clear sky. If occasion is 
not evident or readily made evident to the class, then prepara- 
tory questioning, or sometimes statement, in order to set an 
attitude toward the problem anticipated by the teacher is in 
place. For that reason it is hardly possible that the teacher 
can do more than sketch the skeletal outline of the assignment 
he proposes to use. He must as far as possible leave it to the 
class to develop the specific questions which must be solved to 
the accomplishment of the lesson purpose, and more and more 
the general categories under which those questions may profit- 
ably be grouped. The black-board is useful in such grouping 
and summarization. As a means to organization and the pro- 
vision of reference the skeletal outline already prepared is of 
great help in formulating the assignment. 
The living process by which most successful assignments 
are made disappears in the formulation in print of an hypo- 
thetical assignment, yet, for the sake of illustration of the 
somewhat detailed class assignment the venture is made here. 
Out of discussion of methods of summer feeding, the 
lapse in milk flow when cattle are tied up for the winter, or 
the physiological importance of succulent food, or the relative 
economy of winter methods of feeding, such a problem as the 
preparation of a plan for provision of silage for the home 
herd might readily arise. Organizing the discussion into as- 
signment might readily result in something like the following.

    OTHER PROCEDURES 359 
It is evident that out of the lesson indicated, the problem 
of the relative economy of various types of silos might well 
come forward as a succeeding lesson. Ideally in a well 
ordered course every lesson should be the offspring of its 
predecessor and parent of its successor. In practice the ideal 
may be approximated by the keenly observant teacher who 
bases his assignments upon manifested interests of his class, 
and selects for development such as are for the stage and time 
of teaching most significant. 
The drill lesson, so called, may occur in agriculture but in 
any carefully developed assignment it will be a mere instru- 
ment to the accomplishment of the known lesson purpose, like 
the use of a reference book or a call upon a farmer, and will 
not call for separate and different assignment. It is well for 
the teacher of agriculture to bear in mind, however, that drill 
will prove largely ineffective except a known purpose, or 
motive for drill is in the mind of the pupil. 
Other Procedures in Supervised Study.—Teachers may 
set as a goal in the teaching of pupils how to study their own 
complete abdication as teachers. When the pupil has reached 
the stage at which the clear conception of the problem in his 
own mind is sufficient to motivate and carry through the activi- 
ties necessary to its solution, then the job of the teacher is done 
—the pupil knows how to study. The “ launching of the prob- 
lem,” as Doctor Stewart calls it, is, however, seldom suffi- 
cient with high school pupils to furnish the momentum for 
completion of the voyage of study. Hence arises the need 
for that form of teaching commonly denominated supervised 
study or directed study. How far that form shall be used in 
any given case is wholly a matter for the determination of the 
teacher on the ground. Sometimes, of course, the complete 
act of problem solution may be carried out in this way, but 
more often only a part of it is completed by supervised study, 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
  360 FORMS OF TEACHING , 
and final organization, or verification of a formulated hypothe- 
sis at least are reserved to recitation, discussion, examination, 
field trip, or other form of teaching. Most frequently the 
pupil by “study” prepares himself for the final steps 
of solution. 
The task of the teacher is a difficult one. Much has been 
written concerning what the teacher should do and why he 
should do it, particularly the latter, and the writer finds him- 
self far from able to contribute any certain guidance in the 
matter. Three general statements, however, may indicate 
functions that the teacher is frequently called upon to perform. 
(1) To guide the pupil in the critical evaluation of data perti- 
nent to the solution of his problem. (2) To guide him in the 
use and evaluation of procedures necessary or appropriate to 
the gathering and assembly of those data. (3) To give sanc- 
tion and approval to initiative and resourcefulness in the 
gathering and ‘selection of data. 
To maintain the position of friendly and ready counsellor 
between the extreme of officious interference and “ direction 
giving ” and that of magisterial and benign detachment, calls 
for tact, sympathy, and understanding of a high order. In 
general, the teacher must move about among his pupils, keep 
relatively “ close to their elbows,” in the beginning of teaching 
how to study; as the class improves he will more and more 
withdraw his “check and follow-up,” until with an ex- 
perienced class he may safely assume the seat of the “ consult- 
ing engineer ” behind his desk, ready with advice when pupils 
come to him. There must undoubtedly be, with individuals, 
both prodding and leading, but the best guiding will be neither. 
The teacher will walk, speaking figuratively, without bridle or 
goad, first slightly in advance of the pupil, then by his side, 
then further and further to the rear. 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
    
CONCRETENESS 361 
Concreteness.—Concreteness in the treatment of tech- 
nological content in the class-room is highly desirable. On 
the whole teachers of agriculture show a commendable 
strength in that respect. But concrete treatment does not 
necessarily mean the continuous use of objective material in 
the class-room. It is certainly desirable when new factual 
knowledge is to be added by class-room instruction that the 
objects illustrative of the facts be certainly known to the class, 
and to be certain it may be best that the objects be in hand and 
used by the pupils. Thus to study the characteristics of the 
fruits of various varieties of apples it is far safer to place 
in the hands of the pupils specimens for comparison and con- 
trast than to rely upon descriptions and diagrams of such 
varieties even as may be growing in the home orchards of all 
the pupils. But for profitable discussion of types of silos 
with a class of boys who have made a survey of dairy farm 
equipment on the farms of the community it is not necessary 
to place before the class models or even pictures of silos. Con- 
creteness consists in the use of the pupils’ own experience for 
teaching. If the teacher knows that experience and makes 
use of his knowledge he can be far more concrete than the 
teacher who lacks it in a room full of specimens, models, 
charts and other paraphernalia of visual instruction. The 
writer has never discovered any close correlation between 
genuinely concrete teaching and the possession of a large store 
of illustrative materials. Such are valuable in direct propor- 
tion to their intelligent use. Too often they are substitutes 
for the outside resources of the farm and the community, 
rather than supplementary to them. 
Dynamic illustration is very telling. The teacher who can 
draw, who can describe in form and terms immediately ap- 
pealing to the students’ sense of appropriateness to the matter  
-P-A-G-E-362
  362 FORMS OF TEACHING 
in hand has a very valuable acquirement or gift. But the 
teacher who can stimulate the boy to make his own illustration 
has one still more valuable. 
Illustrative Material—The use of illustrative material is 
receiving a great deal of attention among promoters of voca- 
tional education in agriculture at the present time. There are 
even courses in the teacher training institutions in “ visual 
education,” and numerous publications have been put forth 
upon the subject. Accordingly, I have no intention here of 
going into the matter in detail. On the positive side there are 
two principles which the teacher should bear in mind in the use 
of charts, slides, moving pictures, specimens, et al., both of 
which are very frequently violated in practice. The first is to 
be sure that the illustrative material is pertinent to the study 
in hand, and that it shows clearly exactly what the teacher 
desires to show. Very many of the prepared charts and slides 
furnished to teachers are not satisfactory in that respect. In 
the endeavor to meet a large number of cases they are so 
arranged as not to meet any case in particular. They show 
much that is not pertinent and at the same time distracting of 
attention from the point in hand. Charts tracing half a dozen 
or more curves where only one is wanted are familiar ex- 
amples. The second principle is that every pupil to whom the 
chart, picture, or specimen, is supposed to be of benefit actu- 
ally does see and interpret it. Charts and pictures, if well 
placed can usually be seen by all the class, but small specimens 
held up one by one before the class, commented on, and then 
passed out in a bunch to be looked over while the teacher is 
talking about something else, might often as well be omitted 
altogether. To show ten phials of fertilizer, or fifteen kinds 
of weed seed, or thirty kinds of corn products at a single 
exposition is waste. In the case of charts interpretation may
-P-A-G-E-363
  BUILD UPON THE KNOWN 363 
be developed and tested by questioning. Too often they are 
merely shown. 
Very often the teacher, even if a somewhat crude artist, 
can do better by his class through the apparently spontaneous 
development of a black-board drawing at just the time and in 
just the essentials that are needed than by the use of prepared 
material. In the same way text illustrations, often not used 
at all, may take the place of the projected lantern slide. 
Build upon the Known.—The proposition has been fre- 
quently made that all class-room teaching in agriculture should 
be of the inductive type, that is should lead to the formulation 
of general principles from a series or sequence of particular 
instances. The class-room is certainly the place, very often, 
for the most economical formulation of general laws and 
principles. Further it is to be doubted that general principles, 
or governing concepts, are actual possessions of pupils except 
they be based upon particular experiences. Nevertheless the 
boy of adolescent age in the high school is possessed of a large 
fund of general principles which are quite as exactly a part of 
his experience as the pruning yesterday of a particular apple 
tree. Such he may never have formulated in words or applied 
to the new problems now before him. But there is no need to 
go through a formal process of inductive development to 
make those principles meaningful to him. There is a sus- 
picion that some of the advocates of inductive teaching have 
not only forgotten the superior economy of the deductive when 
it can be used, but also have confused the injunction “ proceed 
from the concrete to the abstract ” with that to “ proceed from 
the known to the unknown.” The concrete is not necessarily 
the known, nor the abstract necessarily the unknown. The 
teacher who builds upon the basis of the known in his class 
work need not worry as to whether his procedure be of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
    364 FORMS OF TEACHING 
inductive or the deductive type. No matter what he develops, 
both procedures will inevitably be involved. In prac- 
tice it will often help the teacher to remember that principles 
are to be brought forward to recognition by means of com- 
parison and contrast. Principles are after all elements of like- 
ness common to a variety of situations. Very much of the 
value of concrete problem teaching in the class-room will be 
lost if habits of response to common elements or governance 
by principle be overlooked. 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
CHAPTER XIX 
GRADING AND PROMOTION 
Ir is a simpler matter to offer destructive criticism with 
reference to present systems of grading and promotion of 
students in agricultural courses than to put forward a con- 
structive system to replace them. The reason is not far to 
seek. To a new type of instruction has been applied a scheme 
of measurement developed under a faculty theory of intelli- 
gence in the teaching of subjects largely devoted to ability in 
factual retention and organization of factual knowledge in 
terms of thinking processes. Because the correlation between 
the several aspects of intelligence, notably those which classify 
under the category of scholarship, is high, the system has by 
no means been a complete failure, though rapid readjustments 
in terms of the measurement of certain mental traits is under 
way in the elementary school. In the high school the system 
which rates achievement and improvement all in one category 
of scholarship still prevails, though research is in process of 
working out more specific modes of measurement in abilities 
such as are developed in mathematics and language study. 
In agriculture where the abilities developed under the several 
aspects of intelligence tend to depart in some measure from 
the standards of scholarship already set up, the failure of the 
system is conspicuous. But as yet little has been offered in 
the way of suggestion for the differentiation of standards of 
achievement and improvement. Professor Colvin of Illinois 
has offered an index to abilities developed under the project 
system of teaching which is well worth the study of teachers 
of agriculture. It cannot, however, be regarded as affording 
365 
   
-P-A-G-E-366
    366 GRADING AND PROMOTION 
objective measurement such as is provided in the tests and 
scales of elementary school studies. It does tend to suggest 
some of the principles that must guide in the formulation of 
a more accurate and just system of grading and promotion. 
Two types of measurement are in use among agricultural 
teachers at present. The first is the lump rating of the status 
of the pupil at any given time. The boy is rated as having a 
standing of A or C, B or D, 86 per cent., 62 per cent., etc., as 
“ passed,” “ conditioned ” or “ failed.” The second plan uses 
two lumps instead of one. He is given C, 70 per cent., 
“ passed,” in school work, and B, 83 per cent., “ passed’”’ in 
“project work.” If the second system be something of an 
improvement over the first, yet it retains most of the faults of 
the first. For example, in looking up the record of a boy I 
find that his teacher has rated him C in Dairy Husbandry and 
in Dairy “project.” Is the boy a good judge of live stock? 
Can he balance a ration quickly and accurately? Can he test 
herd milk in a satisfactory manner? Is he proficient in the 
care of milk and utensils? Can he buy or sell a pure-bred 
calf to advantage? Can he convince a neighbor of the value 
of codperation in the production of milk? There is nothing 
in the rating to give me any information with respect to par- 
ticular kinds of abilities in dairy husbandry. I can make only 
the general judgment that in the opinion of his teacher he is 
a normally good scholar, ranking with the average of his class. 
I know nothing concerning his points of view, his knowledge 
and abilities in using it, or what he can do in a dairy barn or 
on a dairy farm. 
Again, looking at the rating from the point of view of the 
boy. In October he gets a rating of C and again in January 
he gets a rating of C. He knows that his teacher is satisfied 
with his work, and that is all. On the face of it he has not 
improved at all, and yet he knows that he has been learning 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
    GRADING AND PROMOTION 367 
all the time, and that if the learning be genuine it certainly 
must imply improvement. Or again suppose his “ mark” for 
January to be C or 75 per cent., and in February B or 85 per 
cent. Evidently the teacher thinks that he has improved under 
the teaching of the month. But how has he improved, or in 
the reverse case in which a drop in rating occurs, how has he 
failed? Where is his strength and where is his weakness? 
There is nothing in the system to guide the outsider who is 
interested in the boy, the new teacher or principal who is to 
carry on the work with him, or the boy himself. The best 
that can be said is that his teacher considers him “ poor, fair, 
good or excellent,” as boys run in meeting the situations of 
the formal teaching of school room and project. 
Now whether a boy be engaged in learning through the 
conduct of a business or enterprise at home, through farm 
studies, repair and construction work, through laboratory or 
class-room studies, there will be involved in each case, in vary- 
ing degrees, abilities in dealing with things, abilities in dealing 
with ideas and symbols of ideas, and abilities in dealing with 
persons. In each ability under each category there is a 
standard of ultimate proficiency necessary to successful 
entrance upon the vocation in which the school is attempting 
to prepare him. Further the amount of improvement in any 
of these “traits ” during a given period of a certain form of 
training or instruction is variable from trait to trait and from 
boy to boy. An ideally constructed scheme of meas- 
urement should indicate for us the status of any given 
boy at any given time in any given trait, with refer- 
ence to the ultimate standard of proficiency which is the 
objective of teaching. Further it should enable us to determine 
for our own guidance as teachers, and for the guidance of the 
boy, the amount and rate of improvement in any given trait 
over a period of days, weeks, or months. It should enable us 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
  368 GRADING AND PROMOTION 
to answer the question what and how much of change has 
been made in this boy and that under our teaching. 
Now it will undoubtedly be only after years of careful 
research that we can give more than approximate and general 
answers to such a question. We are far from knowing as yet 
just what traits must be developed and just what degree of 
proficiency in each in order to entrance upon the several 
vocations of agriculture, or even upon any one of them. We 
are far from knowing how to measure either final achieve- 
ment or rate of improvement in most of the skills, knowledges 
and attitudes which we are attempting to develop. But it is 
possible to be much more discriminating in both matters than 
we are under the present system of lump approval 
or disapproval. 
We can, at least, give definite attention to the several cate- 
gories of abilities and to the factors which are known to enter 
into achievement and improvement in some of them. We 
know that the boy must possess certain mechanic abilities in 
the use of his hands, in the use of tools, in the use of imple- 
ments, in the operation of machinery, etc. We know that such 
involve processes of manipulation organized into a total of 
skill, and that in the several processes and in the total skill 
proficiency is to be measured by the codrdinate factors of 
speed and accuracy. Objectively we can compare the speed 
and accuracy of the single processes and of the skill with those 
of adults in a like situation; we can compare the material 
product, if such be the event of the skill process, with that of 
the competent artisan. Perhaps the manipulative skills are 
objectively more easily measured than any other of the abilities 
involved in vocation, but far less has been done in evaluating 
achievement and improvement in them than in the more 
elusive category of knowledges. 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
  
GRADING AND PROMOTION 369 
To make measurement of skill the teacher must be aware 
of the details of process, of the codrdinate relations of pro- 
cesses, and must have standards of appropriate speed and 
accuracy. At present he can derive such only from the obser- 
vation of his own work in the same situation or that of 
farmers or others who are regarded as reasonably competent. 
Even though standards so derived be inaccurate, and that 
we cannot judge very closely until research studies of farm 
operations have been carried through, the teacher who adopts 
them and uses them is far in advance of the present practice 
of “ general observation ” or complete ignoring of the specific 
traits involved in learning. To make use of them, of course, 
the teacher must introduce the boy to the actuality of the voca- 
tional job. The boy cannot be tested for ability in the 
performance of a job, or the meeting of a situation, the per- 
formance of which or the meeting of which is the objective of 
preparation, by reference to his performance in a different 
job or a different situation. Discussion has already adverted 
to the fallacy of quizzes, examinations, recitations, and other 
artificial means used by teachers in arriving at an estimate of 
the proficiency of pupils in processes and skills functional in 
vocation, The weakness of mere dependence upon the product 
as a basis of judgment has also been discussed. In the formu- 
lation of objective measurements teachers can do much. 
Careful planning and checking of modes in their own work 
and comparison with the work of others in the same field of 
operation will provide empirical modes until such time as 
experimental modes have been worked out. The problem is 
one to which conferences of teachers should give study. 
Some teachers have made creditable if crude beginnings. 
The writer recently visited a teacher of agriculture who was 
in the act of examining the proficiency of his boys in certain 
forms of rope work. He had a list of ten knots in his note- 
24
-P-A-G-E-370
    370 GRADING AND PROMOTION 
book, which he had selected because he had found every one 
of them of use in work on his own farm and on the farms 
of the community in which he had lived for four years. Upon 
each of them he had set an arbitrary value in “ points” of 
from fifteen to five. In making the estimate of “ points ” he 
had considered first the relative importance of the knots in 
use on the farms of the neighborhood, listing the knots in 
order of the probable frequency of use. He had then given 
consideration—he could not tell in just what manner—to the 
difficulty of making the several knots. His intent was to have 
that knot which was most useful in a group of approximately 
equal difficulty count for most, but actually, of course, some 
of the least significant knots, on account of their difficulty 
were scored highest. Granted that all the knots were cer- 
tainly useful that was no very serious error. After ranking 
his knots he had taken a stop watch and timed himself re- 
peatedly in the tying of them, taking his average time as a 
standard. One further factor he considered also. Certain of 
the knots he found himself able to tie correctly and promptly 
at the first trial. In others several trials were necessary. 
Accordingly he set for each knot a minimum of trials, each 
failure entailing a penalty. One knot must be tied success- 
fully at the first trial, another on the second, another by the 
fourth, etc., if the achievement were to be accepted. With 
such rough but rationally planned standards his procedure in 
test was as follows: 
A boy was called in and given a length of rope. The 
teacher said, “ John, throw a bow-line over that post as 
quickly and well as you can.” With stop watch in hand the 
teacher observed the process carefully, counted the trials, and 
examined the result; then entered the score in his book op- 
posite “ bowline.” He then said, “‘ Now shorten the rope so 
that it will just reach from this post to the wall,” and went
-P-A-G-E-371
  GRADING AND PROMOTION 371 
through the same procedure. At the end of the test he added 
up the scores made on the several knots and reported to the 
boy his success. If the boy totalled 70 points he was “‘ passed 
in rope work.” 
Now it is possible to find fault with the test in respect to 
the derivation of standards and in the use of a situation only 
approximately vocational. Nevertheless, there is a great deal 
of suggestive value in the attempt of the teacher. He was 
thinking in terms of the specific instead of the general. He 
could tell what the boys could do in knot tying as a result of 
his teaching. He could say John Whetzel can tie a bow-line 
over a post with half-inch rope on the first trial in 26 seconds, 
Robert Orange can tie the same knot on the third trial in 35 
seconds, John scores 92 in knot tying, Robert 68, etc. That is 
much more definite and much more nearly accurate than to 
say, John has a standing of 88 per cent. in shop and Robert a 
standing of 72 per cent. 
Both the standards and the measurements of abilities in 
the possession and use of facts and principles are much more 
elusive than in the case of skills. But the principles governing 
tests are the same. Ifa fact or a principle be taught with the 
function of technology in mind, namely that it will serve to 
the determination of activity in meeting a certain type of 
situation in vocation, then the proper test is to confront the 
pupil with that situation and note how he governs his action 
in meeting it. If he meets the situation effectively to that 
extent the technology may be regarded as functional and the 
pupil in possession of the knowledge tested. Rate of im- 
provement in the various traits codrdinate to the meeting of 
the situation is more difficult. Some of them can be isolated— 
as the remembrance of certain facts—and at times it may be 
desirable to make such isolation in order to determine that the 
bonds necessary to the total complex have been formed or 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  372 GRADING AND PROMOTION 
are in process of formation. The chief difficulty in present 
tests for facts is the assumption that possession of the facts 
is indicative of ability to use them—or the possession of them 
in relationships appropriate to the solution of vocational prob- 
lems. The teacher should remember that because a child 
gives evidence of recognizing C and A and T he has no right 
to assume that the child can spell cat. Too much of our testing 
of information and acquirements from reading leaves off with 
just that assumption. Because a boy can state the Haecker 
standard for a certain grade of milch cow and can repeat the 
definition of nutritive ratio, it does not follow that he can 
balance a ration for that cow or any other. But perhaps 
enough has been said in connection with the discussion of ex- 
aminations to indicate the writer’s conception of appropriate 
testing of knowledges. 
Attitudes, “sets,” or points of view are still more difficult 
to reduce to terms of objective measurement. As with all 
other traits of intellect or character the only way in which the 
teacher can judge of the growth and possession of such is 
through close observation of the behavior of the pupil in a situ- 
ation to which the attitude, “ set,” or point of view is a factor 
tocontrol. The principle is fairly obvious, but illustration of 
its application difficult. In the first place we know so little 
concerning the “bonds” and the “ states of permeability ” 
and “ readiness ” of them that contribute to set of mind and 
point of view that we cannot examine them in detail. In the 
second place, even the totals are not readily to,be abstracted 
from the knowledge and skill controls with which they are 
bound up. Yet with regard to the importance of them there 
can be no dispute. For example, we say that the boy 
who would succeed in a farming vocation must be “ open 
minded ” with respect to scientific contributions, economic 
proposals, modes of operation, etc. But how “ open minded”
-P-A-G-E-373
GRADING AND PROMOTION 373 
we do not know. There are limits. He cannot be forever 
weighing and choosing. He must act if he is to perform his 
part in production. But we can get keys to the status by care- 
ful observation. The boy who decides on a feed hopper for 
his hens, and is satisfied to begin work with the first propo- 
sition laid before him in a bulletin on housing is likely to be 
insufficiently open minded with respect to the matter, if he is 
to secure the best hopper to meet the needs of his fowls and 
his pocket book. On the other hand the boy who will change 
his plans with every suggestion that is made to him has not 
the sort of open mindedness which is desirable. Those mani- 
festations of appropriate interest in the job which are so 
readily observable, if occasionally misleading, and so difficult 
of formulation in print, are perhaps the best guides that we 
have at present to judging of growth and possession of atti- 
tudes. Iam ata loss to propose any test for attitudes that can 
be set apart from those for knowledge and skill. 
In the case of tests for skills and knowledges the teacher 
has a fairly consistent control of the stimuli making up the 
test situation. With tools, machines, buildings, materials, 
plants, and even animals, he can determine in advance what 
the objective features of the test situation may be. In the case 
of ideas the use of symbols has been so highly developed that 
his control is reasonably high. But in test of abilities in 
dealing with persons the task is considerably more difficult. 
To set John the job of selling a bushel of Baldwins to Mrs. 
James on October 2oth is not to set him the same objective 
situation as Robert will have to meet in selling her another 
bushel the week before Christmas. Yet tests of the sort are 
valuable, and if sufficiently varied and of definite character 
may give a fair index both to growth and possession of appro- 
priate social abilities in pupils. It is noteworthy that psy- 
chologists have not yet devised any satisfactory tests of social 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
  374 GRADING AND PROMOTION 
intelligence. The photographic and moving picture attempts, 
though giving control of stimuli, have failed because they are 
symbolic and not actual. They tend more to make test of the 
use of ideas than of conduct in social situations. 
Though so little of a concrete sort can be offered for the 
guidance of the teacher it is certain that a great gain will come 
to agricultural teaching if teachers come merely to heed the 
several aspects of intelligence mentioned. We shall then be 
able to judge in terms of groups of abilities at the least instead 
of in the crude lump of scholastic ability. If abilities be recog- 
nized as specific, and trial made of them in definitely controlled 
vocational situations, record of achievement and improvement 
made on the basis of known standards and scales of achieve- 
ment, then a vast gain will have been made. Within the next 
few years teachers of agriculture are going to receive definite 
help in the matter of testing and grading. In the meantime it 
is not necessary or desirable that they should rest on their oars. 
But a word need be said of promotion. A pupil has not 
satisfactorily completed a study in agriculture until he has 
demonstrated possession of the minimum proficiency in the 
several traits that may be necessary to entrance upon vocation, 
or prerequisite to new organizations of abilities in a new and 
advanced study.

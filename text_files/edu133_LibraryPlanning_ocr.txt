  gress bookstack, was born December 28, 1843 at Malden, Massachusetts 
and died October 22, 1914 at Washington, D. C. He was graduated from 
the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, in 1863, with the degree of 
S.B. in Civil Engineering. The subsequent thirteen years were spent with 
United States Engin: officers, constructing permanent fortifications in Maine, 
New Hampshire and Massachusetts. From that time until his death Mr. Green 
was in charge of the erection of large public buildings, among which are the 
State, War and Navy Building, Army: Medical Museum and Library, United 
States Soldiers’ Home Buildings, Washington Monument, Library of Congress, 
Washington Public Library and the National Museum. During the last sixteen 
years of his life, in connection with his other work, Mr. Green was in charge of 
the Library of Congress as Superintendent of Building and Grounds. 2% &% Beene RICHARDSON GREEN, the inventor of the Library of Con-

  FOREWORD 
HIS BOOK is published for distribution among Architects, Librarians and Trustees, 
oT to give general information regarding the planning of library buildings, specific facts 
in connection with the problems of book storage, and details of the construction of 
Snead Bookstacks, Shelving and other products. 
The Snead & Company Iron Works began the manufacture of metal bookstacks when 
they first came into use and have built the largest stacks in America, including those of the 
Library of Congress, Ontario Legislative Library, New York Public Library and Widener 
Memorial Library of Harvard University. We have also equipped many libraries in foreign 
countries. As this is a highly specialized work, the experience gained in both large and small 
installations is one of the Company’s most valuable assets. 
The manufacture of metal bookstacks is a development of the architectural and orna- 
mental iron and bronze business established in 1849 at Louisville, Kentucky, by Charles S. 
Snead, one of the pioneer iron founders of the United States. The Louisville plant was 
destroyed by fire in 1898 and was subsequently re-established in Jersey City, N. J., where 
the main office and works are now located. The business is owned entirely by the officers 
actively engaged in its management. 
Architects, trustees and librarians planning to install bookstacks, either in new buildings 
or old, may call upon Snead & Company for layouts, estimates and advice, which will be 
given either by correspondence or by the personal call of an expert. All that is asked in 
return is an opportunity to submit a proposal and to demonstrate that it is to the owners, 
best interest to use the Snead product. 
It has been found more economical and satisfactory to have all domestic business con- 
ducted directly from the main office rather than through branches or agencies. Business in 
foreign countries is handled direct or through agencies, as may seem advisable. Correspond- 
ence is therefore solicited.

  THE MODERN BOOKSTACK 
PRINCIPLES AND DEVELOPMENT 
HE prototype of the modern bookstack was designed in 1876 by 
Professor William R. Ware, of Ware & Van Brunt, and Mr. 
Justin Winsor, acting together as architect and librarian for the 
extension of Gore Hall, the Library of Harvard College. A shell 
was built of masonry walls pierced by rows of small windows and 
carrying a roof supported by trusses. Into this were packed book 
ranges, row on row, tier on tier, with only enough vacant space 
to give access to the books. The aisles between the ranges were 
28 inches wide and the tiers 7 feet high, allowing the topmost 
of the seven rows of shelves to be easily reached. The stack was 
six tiers high, self supporting throughout and depended on the building for protection only. 
The vertical shelf supports were of cast iron open work, the deck framing of rolled wrought 
iron, the deck flooring of perforated cast iron slabs and the shelves of wood, supported at the 
ends by light zinc Z bars fitting into notches in the uprights. This Gore Hall stack was a dis- 
tinct advance in compact permanent shelving and in it were laid the basic principles of stack 
construction; it was copied for a number of libraries, including the Boston Atheneum, the 
Surgeon General’s at Washington, Amherst College and the University of Michigan. 
No further advance of any importance was made in stack construction until the build- 
ing for the Library of Congress at Washington was taken in hand in 1889 and the necessity 
arose of providing shelving for millions of volumes. A system of storage on a large, com- 
plete, thoroughly economical scale had not as yet been devised. The wood, or wood and iron 
combinations which had hitherto been constructed were crude, bulky and inflammable, dusty, 
close, overheated at the top, inconvenient of access, poorly lighted and unadaptable. 
Librarians were dissatisfied and the theory of shelving on the stack principle had gradually 
fallen into disrepute. Tall single tiers reached by ladders, or a few tiers arranged in alcoves 
were attempted, but found inadvisable because of the extended area of administration, the 
greater size required for buildings and grounds and the resultant increase in cost of con- 
struction and maintenance. Consequently the problem presented by the Library of Congress 
was new in almost all its elements. The United States War Department assigned the con- 
struction of the Library to a prominent civil engineer, Mr. Bernard R. Green. After an 
exhaustive consideration of the needs of libraries and of new materials and manufacturing 
resources available, Mr. Green prepared a full sized working model of a bookstack, accom- 
  [ 1 ]

panied by drawings and specifications. He 
then advertised for bids for the construction of 
three nine-tier stacks containing 43 miles of 
shelving with a capacity of 2,000,000 volumes. 
The leading architectural iron manufacturers 
0° the country entered the competition and 
the contract was awarded to the lowest bid- 
dar, The Snead & Co. Iron Works, then of 
Louisville, Ky. Mr. Green’s invention was a 
success and has served as a model for all sub- 
sequent stacks. This is due to its extreme sim- 
plicity and convenience, the attainment of a 
niinimum of space occupied by the materials 
used and a maximum of space available for 
books at a cost reduced to the lowest terms. 
The Library of Congress stacks have been in 
use for about twenty years; no part of the 
great combination has given trouble or need- 
ed repair and the whole is as perfect and ser- 
viceable as when installed. 
  i Figs i. ORIGINAL GORE HALL BOOKSTACK REQUISITES FOR PROPER BOOK HARVARD UNIVERSITY STORAGE 
The prototype of the modern bookstack 
The stack illustrated was not supplied by The Snead & Co. Iron Works __ A thorough study of the fundamental 
1equirements which govern the successful 
storage of books in a large, growing library has resulted in the establishment of the following 
rules. There should be: 
Accommodation for books of every variety, shape and binding. 
Direct and immediate access to every volume with a minimum distance to travel. 
Location in close communication with cata oging, reading and delivery rooms. 
Thorough illumination, either natural or artificial, by day and night. 
A constant supply of fresh air and an evenly regulated temperature, in order to 
prevent the deterioration of both paper and bindings. 
The greatest possible freedom from dust. 
Facilities for proper classification, arrangement and rearrangement. 
Maximum development of book space and provision for indefinite expansion. 
BOOKSTACK PRINCIPLES 
The modern bookstack, as designed first by Mr. Green for the Library of Congress, 
grew out of the scientific application of these requirements, and has proved itself to be the 
most convenient, compact and economical method of storing books. Through its success 
certain general principles of bookstack construction have come to be advocated: 
1. Books are most advantageously shelved in tiers of double-faced parallel ranges, with 
[ 12 ]
-P-A-G-E-15
  LIBRARY PLANNING, BOOKSTACKS AND SHELVING 
single-faced ranges along end walls; radial ranges waste space and are costly. A row of shelf 
compartments end to end constitute a range. A number of ranges side by side form a tier. 
A series of superimposed tiers or an isolated tier forms a bookstack. 
2. The height of each tier should be 7 feet or 7 feet 6 inches, preferably the former, 
as every shelf is then accessible to a person of average height. 
ZULU 
a0: 
      
  Fig. 2. Section through bookstack 5 3. Between each two tiers there should be a thin deck floor 
3 made of solid material, preferably white marble or, as a second 
f Ps choice, glass. Along the face of each range and around the walls 
— should be an open space or deck slit 2 or 3 inches wide for ventila- 
oOo 5 tion, light and the safety of the lower rows of books from injury by 
7 moving trucks or feet. Deck slits are protected by curbs about 1 
(IU oof inch high to prevent litter or articles being pushed off. By extend- 
a ing the bottom fixed shelf over the deck slit the opening is further 
and deck flooring showing vertical, protected and accommodation is provided for extra large books. 
See Fig. 2, also Fig. 106, page 69. 
4. The stack tiers should be uniform in size and superimposed on each other in order 
to secure convenience, interchangeability, greatest economy of space, best lighting and the protected deck slit. 
least expensive construction. 
5. Main corridors should connect the aisles between the ranges of each tier and the 
tiers should be connected vertically by means of stairs and lifts. Speaking tubes, telephones, 
telautographs, pneumatic tubes and automatic book conveyors may also be used for commu- 
nication and transportation. 
6. The materials of 
stack construction should 
be non-combustible through- 
out. The vertical shelf sup- 
ports should be strong 
enough to carry not only the 
load of books, but also the 
superimposed tiers, deck 
floors and any overhead 
loads, in order to eliminate 
the use of large structural 
columns within the stack 
room. 
7. All parts should be 
simple and solid, with no in- 
accessible pockets to harbor 
dust or book pests. The con- 
struction should be as open 
as possible for lighting, ven- 
tilation, cheerfulness and 
supervision.

8. Fixed stack members that become a permanent part of the building require a pro- 
tective covering that can be renewed. They should be finished after erection with aluminum 
bronze, or some light reflecting enamel, preferably white or light grey. Adjustable shelves 
are most economically and satisfactorily finished with baked enamel. 
9. Shelf supports should be of open work design, thin, 
a flat and rigid, with stiffening ribs extending between the —f}—- 
shelves in order not to occupy valuable book space and fig. 7, 
to make the stack as nearly as possible a stack of books. 
10. Shelves should be easily adjusted, but 
firm and immovable when in place, interchange- 
able, thin for compactness, easily stowed away 
when not in use, and of open bar construction 
for cleanliness, strength, lightness and ventila- 
tion. They should 
neither require tools 
for adjustment nor 
have end brackets 
or loose parts. A 
smooth surface, permanently protected from cor- 
rosion and free from sharp points or raw edges, 
is required. Shelves are usually 8 inches or 10 
inches wide and about 3 feet long. 
11. Hermetically sealed windows in large 
stacks are effective in making mechanical venti- 
lation thorough and excluding dust. With such 
windows, automatically closing doors and a fil- 
tered air supply, the only dust which need be 
contended with is that which comes from the 
handling of the books. 
12. Skylights will only illuminate one or 
two top tiers. In high stacks there must be am- 
Seiad ta ple side light if daylight is to be depended upon. 
Fig. 8. TRANSVERSE SECTION OF NORTH STACK, Windows should be as tall as possible and placed 
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, . . . . 
WWABHINGTON, DLC. opposite the range aisles. However, daylight is 
irregular and its use often uneconomical and un- 
necessary with proper electric light equipment. 
13. The parts of the stack construction should be few, simple and proof against wear 
and tear. There should be effective fire stops formed of solid steel plates between the shelves 
of each two tiers to prevent the spread of fire in the books. Flanged cover plates over the 
top ranges are advisable for keeping off dirt and preventing damage from a leaky roof or 
ceiling. 
14. Tables and ledges for work within the stack are often required, also book supports, 
number plates, back stops, card frames and shelf label holders. Fig. 6. Section through

The system of shelving designed for the 
Library of Congress embodies all these gen- 
eral principles. Designs have been made by 
others based on the Library of Congress con- 
struction, but in order to cheapen the product 
and gain the market,certain essential features 
have been altered and the results have not 
proved successful. Thin sheet steel bent in a 
hollow form has been substituted for the solid 
cast iron shelf supports of the Green-Snead 
stack, but at the expense of 
compactness, strength, san- 
itary design and openness 
of construction. Adjustable 
shelves have been made of 
plain sheets of steel as a 
substitute for Open Bar 
shelves, but their hindrance “Whettsasilwtonmene ate shelf support. 
  ience in handling and use of accessories 
and dust collecting tendencies have prevented 
their meeting with approval in spite of reduced 
cost. Also the baked enamel finish, permissible 
for the shelves, has been applied to the fixed 
parts of the construction, entailing the loss of 
adaptability for renewal and repair, so neces- 
sary in a permanent structure. For some 
time the bracket type of stack with narrow post uprights and projecting shelves was popular 
because of its novelty and cheapness. Continual use, however, emphasized its inconvenience, 
ugliness, instability and lack of true economy, so that it is now rarely considered in competi- 
tion with the Library of Congress standard type. 
After twenty years of use the Snead Standard Stack still holds its own, unique in three 
vital features which will be taken up in detail in the following pages : 
Form of shelf supports. 
Construction of the shelves. 
Method of finishing the metal.

  SHELF SUPPORTS 
HERE are two kinds of shelf supports: those at the ends, called Range Fronts and the 
intermediate ones, called Partitions. Each of these is divided into two classes: double- 
faced, for ranges accessible from both sides, and single-faced, for ranges accessible 
from one side only. That side of a range front which serves to hold the shelves is similar to 
a partition; the other side is designed to give a finished appearance. 
Simplicity and compactness are gained by making the vertical shelf supports serve several 
purposes: to support the adjustable shelves, to hold the books upright, to carry the deck floor 
of the tier above and to carry the shelf supports of the superimposed tiers. 
The shelf supports have rows of rounded blunt teeth on their front edges and horn locks, 
formed from No. 16 strip steel, riveted to their central stiffening ribs to automatically lock 
the shelves in place and allow of their easy adjustment at intervals of about 1 inch. 
There are stock patterns for making four regular designs of range fronts, each of several 
widths and heights, all illustrated in figures on pages 22 and 23. Special designs to conform 
to any architectural requirements will be made if warranted by the size of the order. 
Cast iron was the shelf support material selected by Prof. Ware for the first stack in Gore 
Hall, Harvard University, and it was later used in an improved form for the Library of Con- 
gress, the New York Public Library and the Widener Library of Harvard, besides many 
of the other most important libraries in the country. Cast iron has several unique advantages 
for bookstack shelf supports. From one pattern, by mechanically operated moulding machines, 
an almost limitless number of identical shelf supports can be made, each having the same 
adjustment teeth, stiffening ribs, rounded edges and corners, perforations for the distribution 
of light and air, and the same mouldings and panels for architectural design. This wholesale 
duplication cannot be done except by casting. 
Cast iron is more resistant to fire or rust than wrought iron or steel,* and has an excel- 
lent surface for holding an enamel finish. The ae supports are simple. Each one extends 
the width of a range and the height of a tier, and as a rule consists of a single casting. 
They are solid with no inaccessible dirt pockets, and are compact in form, fitting between the

cast iron can stand practically unharmed up to a temperature 
of 1300 or 1500 degrees F. while carrying very heavy loads, 
even with the frequent applications of cold water while the 
metal is at red heat.” (Freitag). 
“No building can be considered fireproof in which unpro- 
tected iron or steel columns are used; but in many classes of 
buildings unprotected cast iron columns might safely with- 
stand any heat to which they would probably be exposed. Page 18. “Mild steel rusts faster than wrought iron at 
first, then slower. Cast iron on the contrary slowly oxidizes 
in damp situations; rust does not scale from it and oxidation 
when formed is of much less dangerous kind, extending only 
a little way into the metal to about the thickness of a knife 
blade, then stops for good. Cast iron of goodly thickness 
offers a far better resistance to fire or to fire and water com- 
bined than wrought iron or steel.”

The iron used for shelf supports is mixed by chemical analysis to obtain the maximum 
strength and toughness. Each casting is carefully inspected and tested before it leaves the 
factory and typical samples of the various patterns are sent, from time to time, to the Arsenal 
at Watertown, Mass., to have their ultimate strength determined on the 800,000 Ib. U. S. 
Government testing machine. By these precautions the stability of every stack is absolutely 
assured. 
Occasionally manufacturing and engineering conditions arise which make it advisable to 
use a combination of cast iron and structural steel for the shelf supports. See Figs. 25 and 26. 
In such cases the shape and appearance are the same as when cast iron is used exclusively 
and no feature is affected which concerns either the architect or librarian.

  SHELVES 
but these met with disapproval on account of inadequate ventilation and the quantity 
of dust that collected upon them and ground the bottom edges of the books. Attempts 
were made toward an improved shelf of open work construction and some of the simpler of 
these showed a distinct advance towards scientific book storage. It became evident that the 
solution of the problem lay in that direction. 
This is how matters stood when the contract was taken up for the adjustable shelves in 
the bookstacks erected by Snead & Co. in the Library of Congress. Specifications were 
drawn calling for bids on open work shelves to fit in the shelf supports already provided. 
Bids were submitted by manufacturers from all parts of the United States and about sixty 
samples were shown. The contract was awarded to Snead & Co. who submitted a shelf con- 
sisting of light M shaped parallel bars. This shelf was pronounced the best, even by the other 
competitors, none of whom have ever since attempted to manufacture their own inventions. 
The Snead Open Bar shelf is designed for convenience, lightness, strength, perfect ad- 
justability and to give the books thorough ventilation. The bars are gently curved on top so 
that they will leave no impression on the books. They are made of bright polished strip steel 
with a surface as smooth as glass. Their form 
allows the use of several convenient stack ac- 
cessories: rigid book supports and back stops, 
which lock between any two bars, also label 
holders which lock around the shelf bars 
and cannot be dragged off by books. The 
Open Bar shelf permits the circulation of air 
and has a certain flexibility which allows it to 
bear on the four points of support without 
rattling, no matter how heavily loaded, just 
as the springs of an automobile allow the load 
to rest partly on each of the four wheels. 
Dust cannot grind the bottoms of the books 
as it falls between the bars as soon as a book 
is moved. Dust is easily cleaned from the tops 
of books but cannot be cleaned from a solid 
shelf without first removing the books. Each 
shelf is complete in itself and there are no 
bolts, pins or other movable parts for which

ADJUSTABLE SHELVES 
The supporting pins riveted into the front corners of the adjustable shelves are stag- 
gered so that two shelves in adjoining compartments can rest on the same shelf support tooth. 
The shelves are usually finished with baked black rubber japan, having an eggshell gloss 
surface. This gives a hard, handsome and durable protective covering. The dull black shelves 
harmonize well with any color scheme, but if desired, arrangements can be made for supply- 
ing shelves of special colors. 
The Snead Open Bar shelves have been used for over 95 per cent. of the Snead stack 
contracts. For the balance solid plate shelves have been supplied. These are made from 
pickeled, cold rolled and patent leveled steel plates having a smooth even surface. They are 
flanged on all four edges to obtain the requisite stiffness and adjust in the same manner as 
the Open Bar shelf. It is customary to finish these also in black rubber japan. 
Metal shelves have supplanted wooden shelves in the modern library, as suitable wood 
is now more expensive and is not so strong, durable or safe. 
At the bottom of each shelf compartment a solid fixed shelf extends from one side of 
the range to the other and forms a structural feature of the bookstack, being secured to the 
shelf supports to hold them at the proper spacing. The fixed shelf serves as a fire and dust

stop between tiers and is necessary for the protection of the books on the shelves below. 
This purpose of the fixed shelves cannot be properly fulfilled by adjustable shelves, as is evi- 
dent from an inspection of the multiple tier bracket stack shown in Fig. 104, page 64. As a 
rule, when horizontal deck slits are used the top of the fixed shelf is 2 inches above the 
deck floor level, and with vertical deck slits 4 inches. 
SNEAD ‘‘OVER-SIZE’’ SHELF 
When classification makes it necessary to store both large and small books in the same 
range, extension shelves are provided for the over-size volumes as shown in Fig. 29. These 
shelves are like the regular shelves, except that the corner pins are set further back on the 
ends in order that they will engage in the teeth of the shelf supports. They are supplied in 
various standard widths as required. To keep a shelf from tilting forward, when the pro- 
jection is extreme, back clips may be used to hold down the back edge. See Fig. 96, page 59. 
SNEAD OPEN BAR SHELF WITH DEEP BARS 
Several times within the past few years there has been a call for an Open Bar shelf 
which would carry excessive weights much greater than those to which the ordinary library 
shelf is subjected. To meet this requirement an Open Bar shelf has been constructed in 
which the bars are of greater depth than those generally employed. The increase in strength 
and stiffness is shown in both the table and the chart on page 30. 
TESTS ON SNEAD OPEN BAR 
SHELVES, SHELF PINS 
AND HORN LOCKS 
The following tests, conducted by the 
Engineering Department of Columbia Uni- 
versity, New York City, will serve to illustrate 
the strength of Snead Open Bar shelves. A 
comparison of curves ““C” and “A” in Fig. 
30 shows a marked advantage of the deep bar 
shelf over the shallow bar shelf of the same 
length. Curves “B” and “A” show a shelf 
3 feet 6 inches long with deep bars to be 
stronger than a shallow bar shelf only 3 feet 
in length. Note, in the following table, that 
the Elastic Limits of these shelves are several 
times in excess of the loads which they would 
ever have to carry in a library. 
That shelf pins and horn locks are of suf- 
ficient strength to carry the shelf when loaded 
to its Ultimate Strength was proved by these

protective covering to prevent rusting. When properly applied, the protective covering 
can be made to give a handsome effect and also increase the serviceableness of the 
shelving by forming smooth, light reflecting surfaces. 
A unique feature of the Snead Standard Stack is the method of finishing the metal. 
The adjustable shelves are dipped in dull black japan and baked in ovens at the shop, but all 
fixed parts are painted by hand after erection and finished with air drying enamel or bronze. 
The method of dipping and baking is economical and permissible for such movable parts as 
shelves, which are little exposed and which can be shipped away for refinishing if necessary. 
Pigment colored enamel may be used for the shelves if desired but black japan is better as 
it has an asphaltum base which can be baked 
extremely hard under a high temperature and 
the rubber colored finish does not readily show 
scratches. 
Only an air drying finish should be used 
on the fixed parts of a stack in monumental 
and permanent buildings. It is better than 
baked enamel because it is equally hard when 
thoroughly dry, is more elastic and can be re- 
paired or renewed in place. Aluminum bronze 
is particularly recommended on account of its 
durability, velvet-like texture and excellent 
light reflecting qualities. No finish that can 
be applied to metal will last as long as a sub- 
stantial building. Exposed parts are bound to 
show the wear of use and the scars of accidents. 
A stack with fixed parts finished in baked en- 
amel is liable to injury in shipment and erec- 
tion, grows more shabby from year to year and 
the enamel chipped off leaves unprotected 
metal. The baking process cannot be repeated 
after the members are erected and attempts at 
repairing by other methods are entirely un- 
satisfactory. Only a few darker colored baked 
enamels are durable or practicable. Air drying | IBRARY bookstacks, being built of iron and steel, have to be given some kind of

use cause constant expenditure for the upkeep of wooden shelving. 
Shelving but one tier high can be made to receive a future second tier, if desired. In 
this case the cornice is removable and may be used again on the completed stack; and the 
necessary holes in the uprights, for the attachment of the future deck floor construction, 
are also provided. See Fig. 37. 
The shelf supports of wall shelving may be cast with notches to fit over the base board 
and chair rail and close against the wall so that the use of steel 
inaccessible dirt pockets back of the case, is unnecessary. In

  SPECIAL SHELVING 
OMETIMES it is desired to make a bookstack of a special design to meet particular 
architectural requirements or conditions of use. The system of using cast iron for the 
uprights gives unsurpassed opportunities for producing rich effects, without excessive 
cost, on account of the ease with which a pattern is duplicated. In this way the architects’ 
personality can be worked into the design of an exposed stack, thus enhancing the artistic 
character of a building. Once the pattern is made, range fronts of special design (see Frontis- 
piece opposite page 11 and Figs. 44 and 47 on pages 38 and 40) cost no more per pound than 
those from regular stock patterns. With cast iron, all ornamentation is actually part of the 
structure and is not merely applied as in the case of sheet metal; furthermore, the uprights 
have a solid, substantial appearance rather than the “tinny” look of sheet metal construction. 
With stacks of special design, it is usually necessary to employ finishes which will har- 
monize well with the interior treatment of the rooms in which the work is located. This is 
not always practicable with sheet steel construction which is necessarily finished with 
baked enamel; with cast iron construction, however, the air-drying finishes applied after 
the stack is erected make it possible to obtain 
any tone of color or any combination of colors 
which may be desired. Bronze powders of 
various kinds are available which, when used 
on well finished cast iron, produce particularly 
attractive effects, preserving the interesting 
texture and metallic quality of the surface cov- 
ered. A bronze finish of particular merit is 
obtained by using a gold bronze stippled with 
dark brown and a touch of green. This finish, 
while in no way an imitation, gives an effect 
which resembles old bronze. 
When shelving or equipment of a special 
size is required and the quantity does not 
justify making new patterns to produce the 
work in cast iron, it may be made of cold 
rolled steel plates. With standard dies and 
mechanical equipment, it is possible to form 
sheet steel members in a wide variety of sizes 
at a moderate expense. For the sake of econ- 
omy and in order to coat the interior surfaces 
of hollow members, all sheet steel work is 
finished at the shop with baked enamel.

TOP FINISH 
of five different methods. Each finish has been designed to fulfill the requirements TT tops of ranges, over which there is no present deck floor, may be finished in any 
of a definite condition: for a stack supporting superimposed loads, for a stack planned 
with an idea of future expansion or for a finished stack over which there is to be no future 
construction. They are as follows:

[ 4 FLANGED STEEL COVER PLATE 
The ranges of a tier intended to re- 
ceive one or more superimposed tiers are 
provided at the top with flanged steel cover 
plates to tie together the shelf supports 
and to serve as the bottom fixed shelves of 
the future tier above. These flanged plates 
make a neat utilitarian finish and serve to 
protect the books from large accumula- 
tions of dust and other injury. They per- 
mit the next tier being added with no 
disturbance to work in place. 
REMOVABLE STEEL CORNICE 
If it is desired that an incomplete 
stack have a more finished appearance, 
until the future tiers are added, a tempo- 
rary cold drawn steel cornice can be at- 
tached to the flanged steel cover plates 
described in the preceding paragraph. 
This cornice is made with mitred and 
welded corners so that it will stand moving 
and may be used again on the completed 
stack.

UNIT SYSTEM CORNICE 
COVER PLATE 
A completed stack is usually finished 
with steel cover plates pressed along the 
sides into a cornice form, corresponding to 
the cast cornices on top of the shelf supports. 
This is less costly than the removable steel 
cornice construction.

A stack carrying a floor above is usu- 
ally left open on top to facilitate the con- 
nection of the floor beams with the stack 
uprights. 1% inch steel angles are bolted to 
the upper corners of the shelf supports and 
hold them in proper spacing. 
CAST IRON CORNICE 
Where architectural considerations re- 
quire decoration on a cornice or fine sharp 
mouldings, cast iron is used. A cast cornice 
may be designed as desired and it makes a 
more substantial, solid appearance than steel, 
but at a greater cost. The cornice can be 
built in unit sections to permit alteration in 
the length of the ranges as shown in Figs. 48 
and 322 on pages 41 and 247. Soffit plates 
forming a ceiling to the compartments are 
frequently used with cast iron cornices and 
Fie GLSTIRON GORNIGE may be used with the steel cornice also. 
      
TOP CLEARANCE 
A space of one or two inches is usually left between the top finish of the ranges and the 
ceiling of the stack room so as to permit the connection of the cover plates or cornice to the 
shelf supports.

  STACK FLOORS 
DECK FRAMING 
ECK floors are one of the characteristic features of a bookstack. They consist of 
D thin slabs of marble or glass supported on all four edges by light framework. The 
upper sides of the slabs form the deck floor surface and the under sides the ceiling 
of the tier below. Those edges of the slabs which are adjacent to deck slits or other open- 
ings are bordered by curb angles projecting about 1 inch above the slabs to prevent dust 
and litter on the floor from falling through the openings. The framing consists of rolled 
steel angles, T’s and bars. Channels and [ beams are avoided as much as possible, as their 
lower flanges catch dust. The main girders of the floor framing are bolted to the vertical 
shelf supports, and supported by them. Girders adjacent to masonry walls are usually 
anchored at intervals of about 8 feet so as to tie walls and stack together. 
The weights and sections of the floor framing members are varied to suit different spans 
and floor loads, the framing being designed to make the decks as compact as possible and 
to give the maximum head room below. The strength must be sufficient to prevent any 
noticeable deflection or vibration, which tends to open the joints between the floor slabs and 
derange the construction of the stack. The framing is usually made strong enough to carry 
a live load of from 40 to 75 lbs. per square foot over and above any dead load. When # 
inch glass slabs are used for flooring the usual thickness from the top of the glass to the 
bottom of the framing is 33 inches. When 14 inch marble slabs are used the thickness is 
4 inches. These figures allow + inch for the cement bedding. Holes for the passage of hori- 
zontal conduits carrying electric wires may be drilled through the floor bars at the shop so 
that electric light fixtures can be placed close against the soffit of the floor slabs, leaving ample 
head room beneath. See Fig. 24 page 25. This method makes the neatest construction. 
DECK FLOORING 
Flooring for bookstack decks should be non-combustible, solid, noiseless and easy to keep 
clean. It should either transmit or reflect light, and be strong enough to sustain stack room 
loads unsupported except along the four edges of each slab. Wood should never be used as 
it is highly inflammable, noisy, a veritable dirt collector, and absorbs light. The first stack 
flooring in general use was made of perforated cast iron slabs for the sake of ventilation and 
light transmission. This type was soon abandoned however, because of its costliness, its 
propensity for sifting dust onto the aisles beneath and because the invention of deck slits 
made perforated slabs unnecessary for ventilation. 
White marble and rough plate glass are the only materials that have given satisfaction. 
Of the two, marble is preferable. It is stronger, handsomer, feels better under foot and is 
a better reflector of light than glass. Pure white marble is expensive and difficult to keep 
clean. That most commonly used for stack decks is blue-white in color, does not readily 
[ 46 ]
-P-A-G-E-49
  LIBRARY PLANNING, BOOKSTACKS AND SHELVING 
show foot marks and gives sufficient reflection. For strength, compactness and reasonable 
cost, 14 inch is the best thickness. The slabs are thoroughly bedded in especially prepared 
cement, with even, neatly pointed joints, and are given a fine sand-rubbed finish on both 
sides. See Figs. 107 and 152, on pages 70 and 146, showing marble floors. 
In skylighted stacks, glass has one advantage over marble: it will allow light rays to pass 
down through one or two stack decks. Glass slabs are as a rule # inch thick, never less. 
They should be cast on a heavily sanded table to obtain a surface that obscures vision and 
makes a fair footing. The sand-blasted glass sometimes used is not so good as it collects 
more dust and becomes nearly black with use. Properly bedded in special cement on a firm 
steel framework # inch glass gives sufficient strength for stack room use though it may 
crack if a heavy object is dropped upon it. Where conditions require special strength and 
prohibit the use of marble, 1 inch glass slabs or $ inch wire glass slabs may be used. 
Formerly, glass was sometimes laid smooth side up to show straight cut edges and 
expose a surface easily kept clean. This practice was abandoned later because — owing to 
the waviness of the top surface —it was impossible to lay adjacent slabs with flush tops, and 
because persons walking over the smooth surface became so charged with static electricity 
that results on touching metal were discomforting. See Fig. 125 page 90 showing glass floors. 
Slate has all the advantages of marble, except handsomeness and power to reflect light. 
This latter deficiency may be partly obviated by painting the under surface white. Slate 
slabs 14 inches thick are cheaper than either marble or glass and are sometimes used on this 
account. 
BOTTOM FLOORS 
The bottom floor of a stack room is not usually included in the stack contract, as it can 
be more economically built by the masonry contractor. It is important to have this floor 
absolutely level as a bookstack cannot practically be made to conform to irregularities except 
by “shimming up” underneath the shelf supports and leaving openings below the flanges of 
the fixed bottom shelves. 
The bottom floor is usually made of concrete with a cement top finish. This does 
fairly well, though it is somewhat too dark in color and creates dust when worn. The use of 
cement paint will prevent the floor wearing, but is apt to give a slippery surface. Terrazzo 
makes a good bottom floor and to save expense it may be laid only in the aisles, after the 
stacks are erected, leaving the rough floor under the ranges. Marble tile, similar to the slabs 
used in the decks, makes the best floor. With tile, the stack is erected on the rough floor, 
using high stools and deep flanges on the bottom fixed shelves. The flooring is then laid so 
that it covers up the lower part of the flanges and makes a tight joint between the shelf and 
the outer edge of the tile.

    STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
shown in the stack room of the Ohio State University Library, page 173, where this 
arrangement fits in with the stack plan. Spiral stairs are costly and unsatisfactory. 
Winders considerably increase expense and are rarely necessary with stories as low as stack 
tiers. Economy in space is secured by placing stairs between two double-faced ranges. See 
Fig. 61, page 49, and plans on page 209. This inconveniences access to shelves adjoining 
the stairs, but most of the space can be used by substituting for a regular stair railing a simple 
hand rail supported on brackets, or the ranges may be used from the opposite side as double 
width shelving for the storage of bound newspapers or large folio volumes. It rarely occurs 
that the stair requirements for two different stacks are identical; so stairs cannot be made up 
for stock. There are, however, regular methods of construction which are economical. 
Plain stack stairs are commonly made of steel. Better architectural effects can be secured 
with cast iron, but its use increases the cost. Marble treads are used with marble decks and 
slate treads with glass decks, or treads may be made of steel and concrete, or of steel plates 
with linoleum, rubber matting, or “safety tread” covering. Continuous newels, Fig. 60, sup- 
port the stack deck floors around stair openings and obviate the necessity of deep floor framing 
for the wide spans which otherwise would occur. The simplest railings are made of pipe, with 
cast fittings; double lines are 
used in exposed locations 
and single lines for window 
guards or wall hand rails. 
Railings of plain square 
bars with pipe handrails 
give a better effect, Fig. 60. 
Ornamental railings are 
not generally recommended 
for stack room use, as they 
collect dust, but they are re- 
quired where a stack is in an 
exposed location. Figs. 217 
and 246 on pages 191 and 
208 show stock designs of 
simply ornamented railings.

THE SNEAD NEWSPAPER STACK 
  HE Snead Newspaper Stack is an adaptation of the Snead Standard Stack to meet 
the special requirements of large flat books. It is used for newspapers, art books, 
public, bank and commercial records, large folios, or any volume which is better 
stored lying flat. As these books require no side support the shelf supports may consist sim- 
ply of front and back vertical bars carrying the corners of the shelves, the entire central 
portion being left open for ventilation. Bound newspaper volumes average from 18 inches 
to 20 inches in width and 24 inches to 26 inches in length. As a rule the shelves are made 
18 or 22 inches deep and about 28 inches long. As the shelves are closely spaced, from 4 
inches to 6 inches apart, the load per square foot of shelf is small and only a few shelf bars are 
required. This greatly facilitates ventilation.* The great depth of the shelf compartments, 
the close spacing of the shelves and shelf supports, the skeleton form of the latter and the 
wide spacing of the shelf bars form the distinguishing characteristics of the newspaper stack. 
In other respects it is similar to the standard bookstack. This system of shelving was de- 
signed for the nine-tier South East Court Newspaper Stack (the dark stack) of the Library 
of Congress. See Fig. 81. The central columns are so shaped that they can be made to 
carry any required floor load, or extended to any height. The construction of the newspaper 
stack is most compact and dust-col- 
lecting surfaces are reduced to a mini- 
mum. 
The shelves have no loose parts, 
are easily adjusted without tools and 
every inch of space can be utilized for 
books. These last two advantages do 
not always hold for roller shelves, for 
the latter are frequently difficult to 
adjust and wasteful of space. The 
Snead newspaper shelf is thinner than 
the roller type and its long continu- 
ous bars afford a better support for 
the books than the short rollers.

the bottom book to come out unexpectedly when the top one is being withdrawn, as often hap- 
pens with roller shelves. The simplicity of the bar shelf construction and adjustment furnishes 
nothing to get out of order, and makes every portion easy to clean. The newspaper shelves do 
not lack in strength,—a man may safely walk over them. The smooth rounding of the sur- 
faces not only allows the books to be handled with ease, but also without injury to the bindings. 
Roller shelves can be supplied instead of open bar shelves if required. They are designed 
to fit on the same shelf supports and to take advantage of the easy gravity lock adjustment. 
The rollers are made of enameled steel or brass. Steel is recommended because it does not 
tarnish. The shelf frame of the roller shelves is strongly riveted together so that it will re- 
main “square” and always allow a free turning of the rollers. 
The Snead Unit System Newspaper Stack is suitable for single-tier installations when a 
neat attractive appearance is required. There are only five parts to the stack: the end shelf 
supports, the intermediate shelf supports, the base plates, the cornice cover plates, and the 
shelves. Under certain conditions diagonal braces are also required. Similar parts are inter- 
changeable, rendering alterations of range length easy. The stack is so simple that any good 
mechanic can erect it by following the directions furnished. If desired, the solid base plate 
may be omitted and the uprights fastened to the floor or to light bottom bars. This con- 
struction is perhaps more sanitary than with the base. For special architectural effect, the 
end shelf supports can be made solid with panels and the cornice of cast iron with ornamental 
mouldings. For simple storage purposes end shelf supports can be made like intermediates 
with some saving in cost. Shelf lengths can easily be varied to meet particular conditions, 
such as accommodating the ancient blanket sheets which bind up 31 or 32 inches long. 
Accommodation for a small 
number of newspaper volumes is 
frequently provided in ordinary 
shelving by letting the books extend 
clear through from one side of a 
double-faced book range to the 
other, thus making the ranges in 
effect single-faced. This allows 
the location of the newspapers to 
be changed at will. It is objection- 
able, however, in that regular book 
shelves are usually too long for 
newspapers, thus wasting space, 
and also because half the number 
of aisles could be omitted had dou- SNEAD ROLLER NEWSPAPER SHELF

installed at the outset. 
The finish customarily used for newspaper stacks is the same as that used for the book 
stacks, air drying enamel for the fixed parts and baked enamel for the adjustable shelves. 
Metal construction is no more expensive than first class wooden construction and has 
the advantages of being entirely fireproof and far more convenient, durable and sanitary.

When “over-size” adjustable shelves are used, 
a heavy weight on the front edge of the shelf 
may tilt up the back edge until it strikes the 
horn lock about 3” above. This tilting is pre- 
vented by the use of back clips which wedge 
between the back edge of the shelf and the 
bottom of the horn lock immediately above and 
hold the shelf firmly in place. Back clips may 
also be used in connection with portable 
  ledges though not required if the ledges are at- 
tached to loaded shelves.

SNEAD TUBULAR STEEL BRACKET STACK 
TT stack has been designed with the purpose of combining simplicity, lightness, rigidity 
and strength in a construction less costly than the Snead Standard Stack. It is made 
entirely of pickled, cold rolled, annealed and patent leveled steel plates, except for the 
feet of the uprights and the cornice on the full width ends; these parts are made of cast iron. 
  Fig. 100. SNEAD TUBULAR STEEL BRACKET STACK, EXETER, N. H., PUBLIC LIBRARY 
The steel section of the uprights is formed so as to develop the fullest possible strength 
of the material, the hollow-tube shape giving great rigidity. The feet of the uprights are 
secured to the floor to prevent displacement, while the tops are braced longitudinally by tie 
channels, of such stiffness, that transverse bracing between ranges is only necessary at inter- 
vals of about three compartment lengths. Full width end shelf-supports act as a cover to 
hide the brackets of the adjustable shelves. They are frequently used on the ends of those 
ranges which are particularly exposed to view. The cornice on full width ends is made of 
cast iron in order to secure the proper fineness of line and beauty of design. Where a number 
of full width ends are required little is saved by the use of a bracket instead of a standard stack. 
The bracket shelves consist of: First; the shelf proper, upon which the books rest. 
Second; the brackets which carry the shelf in cantilever fashion and hold the end books

  upright. Shelves are triple flanged along the front and back edges into a rigid box form, and 
single flanged on the ends. The brackets are bolted to the end flanges of the shelf. The 
adjustment of the shelves is accomplished by means of three hooks on the upper back cor- 
ner and a lug on the lower back corner of the shelf bracket, as shown in the details in Figs. 
99 and 101-a. These hooks and lugs engage slots in the uprights; the hooks forming a sup- 
port and the lug serving to prevent an upward blow from dislodging the shelf. Rounded 
flanges are pressed on the tops and fronts of 
the brackets to prevent any raw edges of the 
material coming in contact with and injuring 
the books. 
Baked enamel, dark green or semi-gloss 
black, is the finish generally employed. Spe-

cial colors, however, can be furnished as re- 
quired. Stairways, deck framing and other 
structural steel parts are finished with paint 
or air drying enamel applied after the stack 
is erected. 
Steel bracket construction is particularly 
adapted for use in a one-tier stack but may be 
used in stacks of two or more tiers. Where 
the uprights have to carry heavy superimposed 
loads they can be strengthened, either by thick- 
ening the steel plates from which they are 
formed or by reinforcing them with structural 
steel members. 
The tubular steel bracket stack is made 
in any width, height or length. It is inadvis- 
able, however, to go beyond 3 feet 6 inches 
in the length of compartments, or above 10 
feet in the height of the stack. Even at 10 
feet several rows of the adjustable shelves are 
inaccessible. 
The simple construction of this stack 
makes it easy to pack for shipment and any .

SNEAD STAR COLUMN BRACKET STACK 
The principles involved in the shelf adjustment of this stack are similar to those used 
in the Snead Tubular Steel Bracket Stack. The Snead Star Column Bracket Stack, however, 
is much stronger and is designed for greater heights or to carry heavy floors. It is too ex- 
pensive to use in a one-tier or two-tier stack. : 
The intermediate uprights are of heavy steel star sections, specially rolled for Snead & 
Company; the ends are of heavy T sections. Adjustment slots are punched in those flanges 
of the uprights which stand parallel to the face of the range. 
Shelves are triple flanged on the front and back edges into a rigid box form and single 
flanged on the ends. To the end flanges are fastened the brackets which carry the shelves. 
Hooks and lugs on the back edges of the brackets engage in the slots of the uprights, the 
hook forming the support, while the lug serves as a guard to prevent dislodging of the shelf 
by an upward blow. An offset in the back of the brackets allows the shelves to be inter- 
changed throughout the stack and provides for the adjustment of the hooks of opposite shelves 
in the same adjustment slot. This offset also prevents books coming in contact with the ad- 
[ 63 ]  
-P-A-G-E-66
THE SNEAD AND COMPANY IRON WORKS, LTD. 
justment hooks. Round flanges, turned on the front and top edges of the brackets, prevent 
injury to books. 
The distance between the back edges of shelves at the same level in a compartment is 
only 14 inches, and the distance between the ends of two adjacent shelves is only 2 inch. 
This construction affords the greatest compactness possible in the bracket stack, the structural 
members being kept solid and all waste space being eliminated. 
In this type of construction, the shelves are usually finished with baked enamel, and 
shelf support uprights or columns, steel framing, stairs, etc., with air-drying enamel applied 
after the stack is erected. 
The Snead Star Column Bracket Stack, while cheaper than the Snead Cast Iron Bracket 
Stack, is more expensive than the Snead Tubular Steel Bracket Stack.

The uprights of the Snead Cast Iron Bracket Stack are solid, substantial and remark- 
ably stiff and strong. Each consists of a single casting neatly molded from patterns parted 
in the center, sand-blasted, surface ground and filed to obtain the best possible finish.

View at bottom of the five-tier Snead Cast Iron Bracket Stack, showing details of bracket shelves 
and shelf adjustment lugs The end uprights are of an 
attractive pilaster design as 
shown in Fig. 103 on opposite 
page. By placing one upright 
above the other, a stack of any 
number of tiers may be built. 
Shelving is formed of pic- 
kled cold rolled, annealed and 
patent leveled steel plates, with 
triple flanges on.the front and 
back edges. The brackets, also 
of steel plates, fit against the 
ends of the shelf and are fas- 
tened to the front and back 
flanges, a portion of the bracket 
being carried around the back 
to form a brace. See Fig. 104. 
This insures a perfectly square 
and rigid connection and makes 
it impossible for the shelf brack- 
ets to spring from the support- 
ing lugs on the uprights:-The 
shelves are adjusted and held 
in place by means of hooks, on 
the back upper corners of the 
brackets, which engage with 
lugs on the uprights. 
The uprights, framing and 
stairways are usually finished 
with an aluminum bronze or 
air drying enamel, applied after 
the erection of the stack. A baked enamel finish can be furnished if desired. Shelves are 
always finished with baked enamel, usually black. 
Many prefer this stack with solid cast iron uprights, to the Tubular Steel Bracket Stack, 
but owing to its greater cost, it is not so generally used. 
[ 65 ] 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
STANDARD VS. BRACKET STACKS 
ment of their relative merits is in order. The following comparison is not based on 
any particular makes of stack but on the general features which naturally belong 
to each of the two types. 
The characteristic point of difference between a standard and a bracket stack lies in 
the form of the shelves and shelf supports. The word “standard” is here used to indicate 
the broad upright support which holds the ends of the shelves. For the purpose of reducing 
the cost, the shelf supports of the bracket stack are made as narrow as possible and so have 
to support the shelves in cantilever fashion. As the post-like supports are not wide enough 
to cover the ends of the shelves and keep the books upright the shelves are provided with 
end brackets. While the shelf supports in the bracket stack are cheaper than those of the 
standard, the bracket shelves are more costly as they are excessively heavy; consequently 
the difference in price between the two types is not large. 
The irregular outlines of the bracket ranges present an unattractive appearance. The 
unsupported front edge of the shelf gives a suggestion of insecurity which has a basis in 
reality. The books look as if they might topple over on the slightest provocation. The 
shelves frequently become dislodged accidentally and have been known to drop on glass 
flooring and crack it. The brackets themselves sometimes bend or become loose on the shelves 
so that they do not fit the shelf supports. 
The brackets prevent a close adjustment of shelves to hold large folios lying flat and 
they give an insufficient support to tall books standing upright. In stacks of this type there 
is danger of straddling the books over the brackets and marring the leaves. The bracket 
construction is particularly objectionable in a stack room open to the public, as the projecting 
members are liable to catch on clothing. Considerable book space is wasted between the 
end brackets, and between the back edges of the shelves. This latter space is sometimes 2 
inches or more in width, thus allowing books to drop through. 
The desirable features of the Open Bar shelf are never found in a bracket stack, nor 
do bracket stacks have the fixed bottom shelf at deck floors which serves as a fire, dust and 
water stop and prevents books falling from the upper to the lower stories. The solid cover 
plate, which is a characteristic feature of the standard construction, is a great protection to 
the books from dirt and other injury and is frequently used as an extra shelf when the mov- 
able shelves are full. The omission of the cover plates and the fixed shelves between tiers 
largely account for the cheapness of the bracket type. 
Practically all of the first class important library buildings of recent construction have 
standard stack equipment and for most buildings, proposals are not received for the bracket 
construction. The only advantage in the latter is a slight economy in first cost, and this is 
more apparent than real, \ S a choice has sometimes to be made between standard and bracket stacks, a state- 
[ 66 |
-P-A-G-E-69
  LAYING OUT A STACK ROOM 
O absolute rules can be laid down for the arrangement of a stack room. Too much 
depends on the size and shape of the room and the manner in which it is to be used. 
A stack open to the public should have more liberal aisle space than a storage stack. 
The range aisles in an open stack may be approximately 3 feet wide and the main aisles any- 
where from 3 feet to 6 feet. Too great liberality in aisle space is expensive in the cost of 
deck floor construction and limits the book capacity of the whole building. Ample aisle 
space looks well when a library is new and the shelves only partially filled, but as the books 
accumulate and the stack becomes crowded to overflowing, all space save that absolutely 
necessary for aisle room becomes a source of regret to the librarian. The stack of the British 
Museum is a good example of this; the range aisles were originally about 7 feet wide, but 
so great became the demand for book space that movable cases were suspended on rollers from 
the deck floor above each tier. These stood in front of the fixed shelving. This about doubled 
the stack capacity, but at the cost of making 
two-thirds of the books inaccessible without first 
moving one of the heavy rolling cases. 
In an open shelf stack room the range aisles 
may be made as long as 18 feet when open at 
both ends and 12 feet when “blind” at one end. 
Ina storage stack the ranges may be made as 
long as 30 feet and the range aisles as narrow 
as 27 inches to give the maximum book capacity. 
Although a person can pass through an aisle 21 
inches wide, it is difficult to use the lower rows 
of shelves with aisles under 27 inches. The 
ranges should be so placed that adjacent shelf 
supports stand exactly opposite one another 
across the aisle. If this is not done the floor 
framing becomes unsymmetrical and costly. 
The length of the shelves is largely gov- 
erned by the dimensions of the stack room. 
A distance of 3 feet between the centers of 
shelf supports is usual, but this figure may be 
varied if necessary. A closer spacing increases 
both the number of shelves and shelf supports, : 
thereby adding to the cost. The use of longer fig. 105, op sr

The double-faced ranges for public, college and law libraries are generally made about 
17 inches wide with 8 inch adjustable shelves. A few 10 or 12 inch wall ranges or 20 and 
24 inch double-faced ranges may be provided for over-size books, or all the bottom fixed 
shelves may be widened from 2 to 4 inches as shown in Figs. 2, 17 and 106, on pages 13,

above the floor, with 10 or 12 inch shelves below and 8 inch shelves above. See page 70. The 
ledge is convenient for consulting books and does not seriously cut off the most valuable por-

The stairs and booklift should be in a central location or adjacent to the main entrance. A 
stairway in the center of a stack room is usually more serviceable than one at each end. 
SNEAD VERTICAL (PROTECTED) DECK SLIT 
It is a well established principle of bookstack construction that an open space or deck 
slit should be left between the bottom fixed shelves and the curb angles bordering the stack 
deck floors so that proper ventilation of the stack room will be possible. In ordinary stack 
construction this opening is about 3 inches wide, measured horizontally, and it has sometimes 
been criticised on account of the possibility afforded of objects dropping through the deck. 
This objection has been eliminated by the Snead Vertical Deck Slit Construction which 
has shelf supports widened at the bottom so that the fixed shelves extend over to the edge of 
the deck floor and entirely cover and protect the ventilating opening, which now extends in 
a vertical rather than in a horizontal direction. The height of the bottom shelf above the 
deck floor is usually about 3 or 4 inches, leaving an opening of 1 or 2 inches between the top 
edge of the curb angle and the bottom flange of the fixed shelf. The wide bottom shelves also 
afford convenient accommodationf or over-size books right in the same range with the smaller 
books, and this without encroaching on the valuable portion of the aisle space. It is the width 
of aisle at elbow and shoulder levels that counts, rather than the width at the floor level. 
Furthermore, the upward flowing air currents in a multiple-tier stack carry dust, and if 
these currents pass through the deck floors along a line several inches in front of the face 
of the range, the dust particles are not so liable to be deposited on the books. 
Another feature of the Snead Standard Stack which can accompany the wide bottom 
shelf and make it practicable to shelve books right along in their proper order, irrespective 
of size, is the interchangeability of regular and “Over-size” adjustable shelves. See opposite 
page and Fig. 29, page 29. The proportion of large books in a library is usually small, so 
that if the bulk of the shelves are made 8 or 9 inches wide, and all fixed bottom shelves and 
about 5 per cent. of the adjustable shelves 10 or 12 inches wide, convenient and adequate 
accommodation can be had for the entire collection, with a minimum waste of space. 
The vertical deck slit, wide bottom shelf and interchangeable regular and “Over-size” ad- 
justable shelves were first designed for use in the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library of 
Harvard University, in order that the students and attendants using the stack would not be 
confused by the classes of books being broken up on account of variation of size. Books on 
the same subject properly belong together, and it is awkward and needless to separate them 
simply because one book may be larger than another.

  WIDTH AND CAPACITY OF SHELVES 
as much depends on the method of classification, space available and usage to which 
the library is put. Where economy and compactness of storage are important, 8 
inch shelving is recommended for bookstacks in general. Books deeper than 8 inches can 
be taken care of in various ways: by making the fixed bottom shelves from 9 to 12 inches 
wide; by providing adjustable shelves 9 or 10 inches wide to fit on the 8 inch shelf supports; 
by providing one or more ranges with 10 or 12 inch shelf supports and shelves; or simply by 
allowing the books to project a little beyond the front or back edges of the shelves. Most 
books are 6 inches or less in depth and it is well to bear in mind that waste space back of 
books collects dirt and is objectionable while the same space added to the width of the aisles 
becomes valuable. 
The number of volumes that can be stored per lineal foot of shelving depends on the 
character of the books. The following table has been prepared by averaging the data 
collected from various general and special libraries. For convenience in computing the 
amount of stack necessary, the capacity for both single-faced and double-faced ranges has 
been added, this being based on stacks 7 or 73 feet high with seven rows of shelves, six adjust- 
able and one fixed, in the height. N: definite rules can be laid down regarding the width of shelves required for libraries

PRICES OF STACKS 
to equip our stack room; please send catalog and prices.” It is easy to send a catalog but 
impracticable to give a satisfactory estimate of prices without some specification of re- 
quirements. Stacks are built to order, to fit each library. Consequently each contract must 
be estimated separately. The cost varies from 40 cents to $1.00 or more per lineal foot of 
shelving for straight stack work. The arrangement of the stack room, length of ranges, 
width of shelves, height of tiers, number of rows of shelves, number and position of stairways 
and booklifts, freight rates, packing charges and market price of steel, are only a few of the 
many factors which enter into the cost estimate. It is, therefore, almost impossible to quote 
list prices and discounts which will be intelligible and accurate. In requesting an estimate, 
architect’s plans and sections should be sent. If these are not available, sketches with figured 
measurements will do. There should be a full description of the requirements of the library 
and the condition of the room. The more particulars given, the easier becomes the task of 
making a close and satisfactory estimate. For stacks but one tier high the following data is 
required: Standard or bracket type. Number of ranges. Width of each range. Length of 
each range. Height of each range. Number of rows of shelves in the height. Color of 
finish desired. It should also be stated whether or not it is proposed to add an upper tier 
of stack with a deck floor over the first tier some time in the future. 
For stacks of more than one tier in height, added information concerning the number 
of tiers, dimensions of the deck floors, position of stairs, gallery railings, window guards, etc., 
is needed. 
Where ranges are to fit against a wall, a detail should be furnished showing any projections 
from the wall, i. e., base boards, chair rails, etc., so that, if possible, the uprights may be 
notched around the same. See Fig. 36, page 34. Mention should be made of the trim 
around windows and doors and of any radiators or steam pipes which might interfere with 
the stack. 
Although stacks are built to order, there are established manufacturing standards, 
patterns and dies, to which it is necessary to conform for the sake of economy. Special 
construction, designs or sizes are expensive. It is well in stating requirements to mention 
those features which are essential and those which are merely preferred and therefore sub- 
ject to modification. In other words, give as much freedom as possible for the development 
of the stack according to the spirit rather than the letter of the requirements. Such latitude 
tends toward economy and toward rendering the finished result more satisfactory to the 
user. [enon regarding shelving installations frequently take this form: “We are about ready

without the use of steps or ladders, to a person of average height. The old arrange- 
ment of running shelving to the ceiling without a gallery is looked upon with disfavor. 
A mezzanine floor or gallery, although adding to the cost, is more practicable and economical 
in the end. Such a floor, however, is not feasible where the ceiling is less than 124 feet or (): E of the basic principles of the modern bookstack is to have every shelf accessible. 
13 feet high. 
The regular stack tier heights are 7 feet 
or 7 feet 6 inches. These may be modified 
if necessary, but if 7 feet 6 inches is ex- 
ceeded by more than 2 inches modification is 
liable to cause a considerable additional ex- 
pense. Moreover, there is waste space in tiers 
that exceed 7 feet 6 inches, as the upper rows 
of shelves are inaccessible. The height of the 
bottom tier can be increased a few inches by 
increasing the height of the stools supporting 
the uprights under the bottom fixed shelves. 
These are ordinarily 2 inches above the floor. 
In planning a library it is advisable to have 
the distance between the main floors of the 
building multiples of the stack tier heights, 
so that as many as possible of the stack floors 
will be on a level with the main floors. This 
greatly increases the convenience of access 
to the stack and allows book trucks to be moved 
without hindrance from the stack room to 
other parts of the building. See section of 
New York Public Library on page 144 and 
section of Library of Congress on page 136.

  STACK ENGINEERING 
such as the supporting of floors and roofs and the bracing of walls, are easily fulfilled 
by the Library of Congress stack construction. Ordinarily the stack is a self support- 
ing structure surrounded by masonry walls. It is customary to reinforce the walls by tying 
them, at intervals of about 7 feet, with the stack deck floors. This also serves to steady the 
stack tiers and renders diagonal bracing within the stack unnecessary. However, when diag- 
onal bracing is used, the stack can be made an entirely independent structure and may sup- 
port curtain walls enclosing it. 
The rows of stack uprights, generally about 3 feet on centers in one direction, 4 feet or 
5 feet in the other, and thoroughly braced about every 7 feet in their height by the deck floors, 
can easily be made to carry heavy superimposed loads. The two-tier basement stacks in the 
Brookline, Mass., Somerville, Mass., and Gary, Ind., Public Libraries and the stack in the 
Library of Hawaii, carry floors above. The two-tier stack at Whitinsville, Mass., and the 
three-tier stack of the Coburn Free Library, Owego, N. Y., support their own roofs. In the 
Elizabeth, N. J., Public Library the medical reference room in the second story rests on the 
four-tier bookstack below. In all the above buildings the stack uprights, each consisting of a 
single through casting with central stiffening ribs, required no extra reinforcement. 
The castings are so designed that shelf supports for even a one-tier or two-tier stack are 
generally strong enough for 
use in the bottom of a seven- 
tier stack. This permits of 
the shelves being made the 
same size and interchange- 
able throughout, and some- 
times has other advantages. 
For instance, a two-tier 
stack in the old Indiana 
State Normal School Li- 
brary was reset in the new 
building and two tiersadded 
above, with plans for still 
another. Such use was in 
no way contemplated when 
the stack was built, but the Lr | \HE various engineering requirements which may arise in the construction of a building,

  LIBRARY PLANNING, BOOKSTACKS AND SHELVING 
As a rule when stacks are unusually high, or the superimposed loads excessive, the stack 
uprights consist of central structural steel columns with flat cast iron shelf supports attached 
in each tier. The columns are in multiple tier lengths, breaking joints at the deck floors and 
securely braced by the deck framing. The accompanying sketches, Figs.

Showing flat cast iron 
shelf supports attached 
to central structural steel 
columns. 112-a and 112-b, show how the strength of these columns can be increased 
indefinitely, without encroaching on book space, by simply lengthening the 
arms of the columns. In a twenty-tier stack the ends of the rectangular 
shelves need not be more than 4 inch apart and their back edges 3? inch 
apart; thus no available book space is occupied by the structural work. In 
the Library of Congress there are four nine-tier stacks with these structural 
steel columns. One of these, the new southeast court newspaper stack, 
carries above it a work room and over that, its own roof. The main stack 
room of the New York Public Library is seven tiers high and supports the 
floor of the great reading room. The new Widener Memorial Library of 
Harvard University has a ten-tier stack carrying a floor of seminar and lecture rooms. 
A floor carried on a stack can be made unusually thin as the points of support are close 
together. A construction is frequently employed having 3 inch I beams running along the top 
of each stack range, either underneath or imbedded in a reinforced concrete slab 3 inches to 
6 inches thick. Allowing 2 inches for the fin- 
ish above the slab, the total thickness of the 
floor need be only 5 inches to 8 inches, thus 
affording a great saving in space and floor ma- 
terial. Although stacks are well adapted for 
carrying uniformly distributed loads, they are 
not so well fitted for the heavy concentrated 
loads of masonry walls or columns within a 
reading room. If necessary these columns and 
walls can be provided for in the stack structure 
but it is usually less expensive to continue 
heavy columns down through the stack. 
The original stack in the University of 
Michigan Library, of the Gore Hall type, car- 
ried a museum floor above. To increase the 
stack space plans were made to build a two-tier 
stack in the museum room. The stack below 
was not strong enough, however, to carry the 
increased load. There was then, no alternative 
but to suspend the new stack. New steel roof 
trusses were placed across the room parallel 
to the old wooden trusses, which remained in 
place. From the steel trusses steel bar sus- 
penders were dropped at intervals of 4 feet to 
6 feet and to their lower ends were bolted pairs     Fig. 113. COBURN FREE LIBRARY, OWEGO, N. Y.

of steel channels just clearing the floor. There was one pair of channels for each range and 
they were entirely concealed by the bottom fixed shelves and base of the end shelf supports. 
On top of these channels the two-tier stack with its marble mezzanine floor was built, and over 
the stack a reinforced concrete slab was constructed to isolate the old wooden roof and 
eliminate fire risk. See Fig. 110, on page 76. 
In the Bibliothéque St-Sulpice at Montreal, the librarian’s office and cataloging room 
are built directly in the stack room, with book ranges above, below and to one side. See 
main floor plan on page 199 and transverse section on page 200. 
The stack room of the Widener Memorial Library, see plan on page 155, has been 
constructed with study rooms incorporated in the stack work, and also with rows of reading 
alcoves placed along the outside walls. 
Both in new buildings and in alterations, interesting engineering problems frequently 
arise in connection with the bookstack. If taken up at the outset with the stack manufacturer, 
a solution can usually be found that is safe, simple and economical in space and construction. BSseneneaooeaee2ae8

  FOUNDATIONS 
TACK foundations are provided, as a rule, by laying a concrete slab over the whole 
stack room floor, of such thickness or so reinforced that it will carry the loads without 
cracking. Economy is sometimes gained by making the floor thin and having a concrete 
beam under each row of stack columns to form a continuous footing. It is impractical to put a 
separate footing under each column as the latter occur at such close intervals (about 3 feet 
in one direction and 4 feet in the other) that the footings run together. The floor and lower 
walls should be thoroughly damp-proofed so that the first tier will be dry enough for books. 
When the soil under a building is of such a nature that settlement is liable to occur, 
the area of the footings under the walls and of those under the stack should be so propor- 
tioned that the pressure on the ground will be everywhere equal, thus causing uniform settle- 
ment. On this account it may be necessary to use the beam footing construction, with the 
concrete slabs between not bearing directly on the ground. This distributes the stack loads 
over a small area and equalizes the pressure under the stack and wall footings. In cold 
weather all footings should be protected from freezing; otherwise the floor may heave up in 
places and push the shelf supports out of true, not only with each other but also with the 
surrounding walls. 
If an air space is de- 
sired under the stack room 
floor it is good construction, 
although expensive, to have 
walls or rows of piers with 
brick arches between them 
in the cellar under the stack 
ranges. Where there is to 
be abasement under a stack 
room, two methods of con- 
struction are available. The 
first and most economical is 
to continue the stack col- 
umns down to the basement 
floor and to make the floor 
above of light construction 
similar to a regular stack 
deck, but without deck slits.

STACK WEIGHTS 
they can be accurately determined; the weight of the books and the live load on the 
stack decks must be assumed. The proper allowance for deck live load differs with 
each building, 70 lbs. per square foot is frequently used for a stack of but a few tiers to make 
sure that the deck framing will be amply stiff to prevent deflection and vibration. However, 
it is out of the question to consider that any such live load could ever come on all the decks. 
Therefore, the assumed live load may be greatly reduced when calculating the strength of the 
columns and might be disregarded entirely so far as the foundations of the stack are con- 
cerned. A conservative basis of calculation is to assume a live load of 40 lbs. per square foot 
for the top deck and reduce the amount 10 per cent. for each tier below. 
Unit weights given below are a safe average for an ordinary bookstack : 
Shelf supports and shelves, 6 to 10 lbs. per cubic foot of range. \ LTHOUGH the dead loads of stack construction vary with each stack installation,

Live load. . . . . 40“ “of glass or marble area of top

When a stack must be erected on a floor of light construction, there is sometimes a 
prejudice in favor of the use of a bracket stack rather than a standard stack. This prejudice, 
however, is not well founded since the difference in weight between the lightest kind of a 
bracket stack and a substantial standard stack is almost negligible when proper account is made 
of the weight of books, deck floors, deck framing and live load on floors. In either case, the 
weight of the last four items should be the same. The shelf supports, or uprights, of the 
bracket stack are lighter than those of the standard stack, but the shelves themselves are 
heavier, so that the net difference in weight is but a small proportion of the total weight of 
the stack construction. In fact, after making proper allowance for the weight of books and 
the live load on decks, the total weight on the floor with a bracket stack might be as much 
as 44 per cent. less than with a standard stack, but is more likely to be only 1 or 2 per cent. 
or even nothing. 
The books themselves are the principal factor to be considered in reference to floor 
loading, as they are far heavier than the shelf supports and shelves, and the variation in 
their weight is much greater than the variation in weight of the different types of stack. 
The following plans and unit weights are given to show two extreme cases and a medium 
example. It is unlikely that the combination of extremely heavy weights in the last example 
could ever be obtained in an actual bookstack, but it serves to illustrate the maximum limit 
of weight.

STACK ROOM WALLS 
tions, as the building of a book stack to conform to small irregularities is impractical. 
The stack must be kept within minimum dimensions, even though the space outside these 
dimensions be wasted. All mouldings and projecting trim should be eliminated as they hinder 
a close fit. A beam projecting from a wall where there are to be wall ranges is most objec- 
tionable because it necessitates the ranges being built out far enough to clear. The uprights 
cannot well be notched around, since their strength depends on continuous flanges along the 
back edges. Placing the ranges in front of the beam leaves an opening behind, which must 
be protected by steel plate or wire mesh backing to prevent books falling through. Wall 
ranges should be set close against the walls so that metal range backs are unnecessary as 
the pockets formed behind are both space wasting and insanitary. 
Stack deck floors are usually connected to adjoining masonry walls at intervals of from 
6 feet to 8 feet, in order to tie together and brace both the building and stack and to provide 
a partial support for the wall aisles so that they will not have to be cantilevered out from 
the shelf supports. As a rule the curb angles bordering the deck floors clear the walls one 
inch or two inches to provide for irregularities and ventilation. The floor connections are best 
made after the walls are finished. This is done by means of cast iron brackets expansion 
bolted into place. Repeated experience has proved the difficulty of depending on the masons 
setting anchors in the right positiors. If anchors must be built in, they should be specially 
designed so that small irregularities of position can be overcome when the stack work is 
connected. 
It is hardly necessary to say that all outside walls should be furred or insulated so as to 
keep dampness away from the bocks. Common brick painted white does not make a bad 
facing for the interior walls of a storage stack. White plaster is better. Next comes light 
colored face brick and, best of all, white enameled brick. Plaster is usually put on before 
the stack is set, because of the difficulty in working around deck floors and uprights. I: is important to have stack room walls square, straight, plumb and free from projec-

NATURAL LIGHTING 
outside rooms to other purposes. However, in small libraries it is unlikely that artificial 
light will ever entirely supersede daylight. Where daylight is to be depended upon, a larger 
window area is required than for ordinary rooms whose interiors are not packed full of books 
and stack construction. 
From an esthetic point of view, the design of the windows in a stack room is frequently a 
difficult problem. A stack naturally requires a window at the end of every aisle in each tier, but 
the outside appearance of such an arrangement is inharmonious with the architectural treat- 
ment of most buildings. Consequently, long slit windows have been adopted with such success 
that they have come to be considered the typical stack window. They more truly represent their 
purpose than rows of small windows as they indicate that the interior behind them is one large 
room. Furthermore they may be worked into the exterior design in a way that is both interest- 
ing and attractive, as shown in Fig. 123. 
In the New York Public Library the centers of the piers are opposite every other range, 
while in the Widener Library they are opposite every third range. In both instances there is |: large storage stacks natural light is not necessary and it is often advisable to assign all

direct light for each stack aisle. Se> Figs. 147 and 160. The masonry piers can be stiffened if 
necessary by heavy metal ties runn ng across the windows at the deck levels or about 3 feet 
above, where they will not cast objectionable shadows. The outside reveal of the windows may 
be made as shallow as desired to give room for a folding or stationary ledge inside, a matter of 
great convenience for work in the stack. In a narrow stack room it is permissible to have the 
ends of the ranges opposite the winc ows if the uprights are of open construction with a light fin- 
ish and wide side aisles. This allows the light to hit at a good angle for illuminating titles. 
The position of windows is rather more important than their size since the most valuable 
light comes from the glass nearest the ceiling. The highest light is effective for the greatest 
distance from the windows and roughly speaking half the illumination comes from the upper 
third of glass area. For this reason windows but one tier high can be made nearly as efficient as 
slit windows, if their tops are placed a little above the deck floor of the tier overhead so that the 
highest rays are unobstructed. See :ransverse section of Library of Congress stack on page 15.

Prism glass with ribs arranged to throw the light rays horizontally across the stack tiers is 
of assistance in illuminating deep rooms. Open work shelf supports, a white finish on the stack 
construction and walls, white marble floors and deck slits are valuable for making the available 
light go as far as possible. Light rays pass freely through the openings or else are reflected 
from the white surfaces. Ina stack so designed the books themselves form the principal obstruc- 
tion to light.

ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING 
electricity which, if properly installed, is entirely safe. Gas has been found incon- 
venient and costly and in some of the old libraries it was discovered that the bindings 
and the leaves of books shelved near the ceiling were rapidly being destroyed by its fumes. 
Tungsten lamps, because of their economy in the consumption of current, are preferred 
to the old style of carbon lamps. Lock sockets should be provided in open stack rooms. 
There is much room for improvement in stack lighting systems. As a rule the upper 
shelves are brightly illuminated, while the titles of books on the lower shelves are read with 
difficulty. The use of opalescent glass shades of proper curvature, aids in lighting up the bot- 
tom row of books and protects the eye from the intense glare from the bare filaments, but 
the distribution of light which they give is not uniform. Special reflectors are made which 
distribute the light rays equally over the whole face of a range, but they greatly increase the 
cost of the lighting installation. Indirect lighting is not generally practicable as it requires 
too great a consumption of current. White marble deck floors do much to distribute light 
for they not only reflect the rays upwards but diffuse them by reflection from the under side 
of the floor above. Where glass floors are used, arrangements are sometimes made to con- 
trol the lights of the tier be- 
low so that they will shine 
up through the floor and illu- 
minate the lower shelves. 
This method although form- 
erly popular, is now seldom 
used in new buildings as it 
complicates the wiring and 
is costly to install. 
The choice of a method 
for controlling the lights of 
a stack room should be de- 
termined by the conditions 
of use. Small libraries ordi- 
narily have one main switch 
board controlling all lights 
in the stack, with chain pulls 
for individual lights. This 
arrangement saves in cur- [Te artificial lighting of modern stack rooms is now accomplished solely by means of

  LIBRARY PLANNING, BOOKSTACKS AND SHELVING 
conduits to be run perpendicular to the ranges, so that they are supported by the cover plates 
over a single tier or over the top of a stack of several tiers. 
The most widely used method of electric light control is to have double push-button 
switches on alternate end shelf supports for the lights in each stack aisle... With double 
switches it is evident at a glance that the lights in any aisle are controlled by the switch nearest 
at hand. Sometimes switches are placed on the opposite ends of the same range, for the 
convenience of the attendant, who enters at one end of the aisle and leaves at the other. End 
switches are also employed where the utilization of the lights below a glass floor is desired. 
Occasionally, tassel switches are used at the aisle entrance. These cost less than end 
switches and are sometimes necessary where a special design of end shelf support interferes 
with the fixed switch box. 
In some of the largest stack rooms, gang switches are placed at convenient points to 
illuminate large sections at a time, the theory being that lights are more likely to be turned 
off at one switch than at several. This method is used in the New York Public Library and 
was in use in the Library of Congress until supplanted by “time limit” switches. 
These “‘time limit” switches are operated by means of clock-work running in oil and are 
customarily placed on alternate end shelf supports along the main aisle. As an attendant 
enters an aisle to get a book he pushes the nearest switch. He then has to pay no further 
attention to the lights as they go out automatically after the lapse of a fixed period of a few 
minutes. They can be kept burning indefinitely, however, by inserting a special key in the 
switch. Although the price of these switches is from ten to fifteen dollars each, it is esti- 
mated that in the Library of Congress they have halved the consumption of current and 
globes As they come into use more generally their cost will undoubtedly be decreased. 
They will not be recommended, however, by readers who like to browse. 
In the Harper Memorial Library of the University of Chicago, the lights in each aisle 
are controlled by means of a hinged bar extending across the entrance. When entering the 
aisle, the bat is lifted and the lights are automatically turned on. They are switched off again 
when the bar is raised at departure. See Fig. 129. 
The spacing of the lights varies with conditions, but the general rule is to place 16 candle 
power carbon lamps or 25 Watt tungsten lamps about 6 feet apart in range aisles and from 
12 feet to 24 feet in the main aisles where the lights are in constant use. Occasionally 
a portable bulb, protected by a wire screen and mounted on a handle attached to an extension 
cord, is used. These portable lights are found convenient for searching lower shelves. 
Electric wires should always be protected by metal conduits and ducts. These conduits 
shoula be designed to have the wires accessible for repairs. If the wires are protected by 
metal and the current supply properly fused, there is no danger of fire from a short circuit, 
The electric wiring of a stack room is usually a sub-contract with the stack manufacturer. 
However, it is best placed under his control, so that the stack work can be properly prepared 
to receive the conduits and switches. The appearance and convenience of many stack rooms 
have been injured by not considering the lighting question until after the stacks were installed.

  HEATING AND VENTILATING 
but none have proved more satisfactory than the system installed in the Library of 
Congress stacks. See sections of Library of Congress, pages 14 and 15. This 
system will work either in conjunction with the heating arrangements or independently of 
them as the weather requires. 
The Library of Congress stacks have fresh air intakes leading into the basement from 
interior courts covered with grass, and practically free from dust. By means of electric fans 
the air is first drawn through closely woven wire mesh screens to eliminate the larger foreign 
bodies. It is then thoroughly filtered for the removal of dust and may be washed with water 
sprays, although this precaution is seldom found necessary. From the filters, the air passes 
through the heating chambers, where radiators heat it to any temperature desired. From 
here, under the pressure of the fans and its own natural tendency to rise when warmed, the 
air flows into the stack room and up through the stack structure. The deck slits along the 
faces of the ranges and around the walls permit an equitable distribution of the fresh air. In 
cold weather the difference between the temperature of the air outside and that within the 
stack room is sufficient to cause a continuous outward flow through louvres in monitors on the 
roof. In warm weather exhaust fans, mounted in the monitors, supplement those in the base- 
ment and help to keep the air circulating. The system is rendered fully efficient by the fact 
that all the stack room windows are hermetically sealed. Sealed windows also aid considerably 
in eliminating the dust. One of the great advantages of this system is that there are no 
hot pipes in the stack room to occupy valuable space and injure adjacent books. Nor do the 
upper tiers tend to become over-heated as is the case with the direct system of heating from 
radiators. 
In the stack rooms of small libraries where an indirect heating system is impracticable, 
the mistake should not be made of distributing radiators or pipe coils uniformly through the 
height of theroom. Suchan arrangement makes the upper tiers unbearably hot when the lower 
ones are only comfortably warm. As the warm air is free to rise through deck slits and stair 
wells the space occupied by the stack should be treated as one room and not as a series of 
low stories. 
Proper atmospheric conditions are of prime importance for the preservation of books. 
The following are a few simple rules to follow: 
1. Do not overheat the stack room. From 60 degrees to 70 degrees is a good range of 
temperature. 
2. Avoid dampness and unnatural gases in the atmosphere. 
3. Demand cleanliness in the handling of the books both within and without the library. 
4, Books should be kept in clean open places where they have the benefit of good 
ventilation. Air should circulate freely around each volume to prevent disintegration. The N | ANY different methods for heating and ventilating stack rooms have been attempted, 
[ 94 ]

  LIBRARY PLANNING, BOOKSTACKS AND SHELVING 
late Dr. W. F. Poole said that books breathe 
just as do human beings and have practically the 
same requirements for fresh clean air. 
Mr. William R. Reinick, in his article “In- 
sects Destructive to Books,” printed by the 
American Journal of Pharmacy, recommends 
‘good ventilation and the avoidance of insect 
breeding places. He says in part that: 
“Late investigations have disclosed facts 
which show that insects are not only in search 
of the paste in bindings, but also of the cloths, 
woods, papers, inks, leathers, parchments, oils, 
etc., which go to make up the books. 
“Tt has been stated that more books and 
papers are destroyed by small forms of life in 
one year than by fire and water combined; and, 
from the facts given by various writers and the 
statements made to me in letters by many libra- 
rians and others, especially where the libraries 
are located in warmer regions, I am positive 
that this statement is true. 
“As far as the destruction of these insects 
Fig. 190, EXAMPLE OF HAVOC WROUGHT BY INsEcrs ar by poisons is concerned, they are practically 
HILL MEMORIAL LIBRARY, BATON ROUGE, LA. worthless, because whenever the poison is used 
Previous to the installation of the new metal stack. to destroy one insect it will attract other insects 
who have need for this poison.” 
A stack which lends itself to thorough ventilation and is so constructed as to eliminate 
hollow, dust and filth collecting spaces, may be easily fumigated. Occasion for such action arose 
in January 1908 when one of the staff of the Washington Public Library was taken ill with 
smallpox. The building was promptly closed to the public and disinfected, where necessary, 
with formaldehyde. In the stack room the process was simple, owing to the fact that the build- 
ing was equipped with a Snead Standard Stack. The ventilating slits in the decks, the open 
construction of the shelf supports and shelves, and the entire absence of hollow enclosed spaces 
allowed the formaldehyde fumes to penetrate everywhere. 
Volumes which have been exposed to contagion should be fumigated individually. This may 
be done by the Beebe carbo-gasoline method. This consists of immersing the books ina solution 
of gas-machine gasoline containing two per cent. of phenol crystals. After twenty minutes 
they are removed and placed before an electric fan for two minutes and then stood on end for 
from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. 
Another method of disinfecting consists of immersing the books in a solution of gasoline 
containing five per cent. of carbolic acid.

BOOKLIFTS, ELEVATORS AND OTHER 
STACK ACCESSORIES 
HAND-POWER AND ELECTRIC BOOKLIFTS 
HE satisfactory installation of a booklift depends largely upon the selection of that 
| equipment which best meets the conditions and requirements of each case. There are 
two general classes of booklifts: hand-power and electric. Hand-power lifts are used 
in small libraries for short runs and light loads. Those required to carry one or two books 
at a time should be light and rapid running while those designed to carry loads of 100 to 200 
lbs. or more should be strong and so geared that they operate with ease. When a small lift 
may sometimes be used for a few books and at other times for heavy loads, a compromise must 
be effected. One type of hand-power lift which has proved very satisfactory for high-speed 
services, consists of a pair of balanced trays, or one counterweighted tray, running between 
guides. These guides are preferably made of polished brass tubing or Kalameined brass, to 
present a neat appearance. One of them may serve as a speaking tube to connect various 
floor levels, while the counterweights run within the other. The quick running of this type 
makes it useful for serving a delivery counter from a department above or below. A lift 
designed for heavy loads, however, must necessarily move slowly. The mechanical apparatus 
can be geared for any speed required but, when once set, cannot be readily changed. Booklifts 
are usually equipped with a device to make them self sustaining in any position of the run. 
In large stacks it is 
generally advisable to in- ‘STANDARD PARTITION STANDARD RANGE FRONT, 
stall electric booklifts. 
These are usually built to Qo 9° 
carry from 100 to 300 lbs., 
at a speed of about 100 to 
150 feet per minute. The 
hoisting machine can be 
located either at the top or 
at the bottom of the shaft. 
Generally it is preferable 
to have it in the basement 
in a small room or wire 
mesh enclosure alongside 
the shaft, where it can be 
readily cleaned by the jani- 
tor or engineer. Electric . Fig. 131-a. Plan of Booklift shaft running through the end compartments of a series of

means of push-buttons arranged to meet different requirements of service. Safety devices 
render these push-buttons inoperative while any booklift door is open or while a car is in 
motion. The several systems of control are as follows: 
One Point Control with Signals. With this system there is a central controlling station 
to which all messages must be sent and from which point the booklifts are operated. This 
control is efficient in a stack employing more than one lift. 
Full Automatic Control. This consists of a full set of controller buttons, on each of the 
floors or decks, by means of which the car is called to or sent from the station. 
Call Button Only. This system is used where telephones are installed in the stack room. 
It is similar to the Full Automatic Control except that the car can only be called to a station 
and cannot be sent to other points. 
Cars are generally made of steel, 12 to 18 inches deep, 2 to 3 feet wide and 2 to 3 feet 
high. Removable shelves are convenient for handling books of various sizes. 
[ 97 ]  
-P-A-G-E-100
  THE SNEAD AND COMPANY IRON WORKS, LTD. 
At times a booklift is located outside the stack room, and opens into it, but almost in- 
variably, it is placed directly in the stack room, where it is most accessible for the attendants. 
When installed within the stack it is generally included in the stack contract, since the stack 
manufacturer must provide the structural framing and enclosure for the lift shaft, the lift it- 
self being supplied by a specialist. It frequently develops that the greatest convenience and 
compactness can be obtained by running the lift as shown in Figs. 131-a and 131-b. 
ELECTRIC ELEVATORS 
The most serviceable elevator for a stack room is one large enough to accommodate 
both passengers and book trucks. Push button control, consisting of a call button at the ele- 
vator door and a bank of push buttons inside the car, renders the services of an attendant 
unnecessary. Safety appliances, similar to those used with electric booklifts, are always pro- 
vided. Electric elevators should only be used in large libraries and tall stacks as their installa- 
tion forms a rather disproportionate expense for a small library. 
BOOK CONVEYORS 
Automatic book conveyors are designed to carry books both vertically and horizontally 
and perhaps from one building to another. Their action may be almost human in intelligence 
and in fact, mistakes are generally the fault of the operator and not of the conveyor. A de- 
scription of the book conveyors in the Library of Congress will serve to explain the working 
of such appliances. See section of Library of Congress on page 14. 
Conveyors in Stack. Each of these consists of a pair of parallel, endless sprocket chains, 
20% inches apart, driven continuously throughout the day, at a speed of 100 feet per minute, 
by means of a small electric motor. The chains run over sheaves of such size that the hanging 
trays pass freely over the axles wherever the direction is changed. Eighteen book trays are 
suspended from the chains at equal intervals. These trays are made of aluminum, for light- 
ness, with small fittings of brass and iron. The tray bottoms consist of horizontal sets of 
parallel brass fingers, five-eighths inch apart, attached at the back and turning up slightly in 
front to prevent the books from projecting over. The trays thus pass flatwise through similar 
sets of teeth, or toothed racks, located at the various stations. At deck stations two such 
racks are provided, one at the arriving and the other at the departing part of the chain, for 
the automatic delivery and taking on of books. In the reading room both racks are on the 
same side, one above the other, one sloping inward, the other outward. As a tray arrives 
at its delivery station its contents are combed off and slide into a softly padded box. The 
capacity of each tray is the equivalent of a quarto, 34 inches thick. The automatic action of 
the trays is secured through a set of movable spurs or keys on the back, one for each station 
and one general key. When a book is taken on, a dial is set by hand by which the general 
key is withdrawn and the tray prevented from responding to any call until its load is dis- 
charged at the proper station. 
Conveyor to Capitol. This consists of trolleys running between parallel rails and having 
attached to them carriers large enough to hold a bound newspaper volume or a leather pouch 
of similar size and shape, for small books and other matter. Each carrier consists of a 
set of deep parallel hooks similar to the hanging human hand with fingers turned upwards, 
[ 98 ]

  LIBRARY PLANNING, BOOKSTACKS AND SHELVING 
nearly to the top. They are hung like a pendulum and always travel in an upright position, 
their loads being taken on and removed by the carriers passing upwards or downwards through 
toothed racks. The conveyors are moved by means of small flexible, endless wire cables, of 
which there are three along the route: one in the library, one in the capitol and the third, 
connecting these two, in the tunnel between the two buildings. The cable in the central loop 
is driven faster than those in the buildings, thus increasing the speed of deliveries. 
ENCLOSURES 
Elevators, lifts, conveyors, etc., running through a stack require some form of enclosure. 
This is generally made of a steel frame with panels of steel plates, wire mesh or wire glass. 
Panels of flat wire, woven into a square mesh, are recommended since they give an attractive, 
light and open appearance. Steel plates while somewhat cheaper are not so satisfactory. 
MEANS OF COMMUNICATION 
Pneumatic Tubes are used in large libraries for transmitting messages between the 
delivery desk and the different stack levels. The system consists of metal tubing installed be- 
tween the various points of communication, and cartridge shaped carriers, usually about two 
inches in diameter, which hold the message slips. A partial vacuum formed in the tubes in 
front of the carriers causes the atmospheric pressure to drive them to their destination. 
Their cost of installation and operation is prohibitive for a small library. 
The Telautograph is a delicate electrical apparatus, with writing pad attachment, by 
means of which a fac-simile of any message written at the sending station is immediately re- 
produced at the receiving station. It is sometimes used instead of the pneumatic tube service. 
Intercommunicating Telephones are used in large modern library buildings to connect 
the different departments with each other and the stack tiers with the delivery desk. Auto- 
matic telephones are now on the market which eliminate the necessity of a central exchange. 
PNEUMATIC CLEANING 
A pneumatic cleaning apparatus is a valuable accessory for any stack. By its use, dust 
is actually removed from books and floors instead of merely being stirred up to settle in an- 
other place. A stationary plant is quite unnecessary and costs considerably more to install 
and operate than a portable machine, as the latter has only short tube lines and consequently 
loses very little power in transmission. Furthermore, it need only be in operation while 
cleaning is actually being done. The portable machine can be attached either to the electric 
light sockets in the stack or to plugs specially provided at convenient points. 
Probably the most efficient cleaning machine for a library stack room is a combination 
plenum and vacuum apparatus with two hose connections, one terminating in a hook shaped 
nozzle which serves as a blower, and the other terminating in a cone shaped bell at the apex 
of which is attached the vacuum tube. The operator works with blower in one hand and bell 
in the other. He passes the nozzle back along the tops of books or other dust covered sur- 
faces and blows the dust forward in the direction of the bell. It is then drawn into the 
vacuum tube and filtered out by the machine. By this means, dust is driven from small crevices 
and corners which could not be reached by a regular vacuum cleaning apparatus.

UNDERGROUND BOOKSTACKS 
far as basement rooms of library buildings have been utilized. However, this method 
of storage becomes a necessity when adjacent space is required and architectural con- 
siderations or injury to light prevent an above ground addition. The expense of an under- 
ground stack is greater than that of a stack of corresponding capacity above ground, on 
account of excavating, heavy retaining walls, underpinning of adjacent buildings and admin- 
istration solely with artificial lighting and ventilation. 
As dampness is extremely injurious to books, the floor, roof and walls of the under- 
ground stack room should be thoroughly waterproofed. They should also be carefully insu- 
lated so that they will not be cold enough to condense the moisture in the air that touches 
them. A cork paint on all interior surfaces, where practicable, will prevent condensation 
although it cannot be wholly depended upon for insulation. Provision should also be made to 
prevent surface water draining into the stack during heavy rains or in times of fire in ad- 
jacent buildings. 
In humid weather the temperature of the underground stack must be kept above that of 
the outside air, otherwise the increased pressure will force out the dissolved moisture and 
cause condensation on the metal work. | ITTLE has been done as yet towards building bookstacks underground, except in so

growth for many years. It is often advisable to install only a part of the bookstack at 
the outset and to make future extensions as required. If there is no roofing or masonry 
work to be done, this proceedure is a simple matter and may be handled in several ways to 
meet various conditions of the general plan of the building. 
1. The first tier or first few tiers of the stack may be installed at the beginning, with 
provision for the addition of future tiers above. In this case it is well to equip the upper- 
most tier with a portion of the framing for the deck next above so that the electric conduits |: planning a library building, sufficient stack space should be provided to accommodate

for this tier may be permanently supported by passing them through the steel floor members. 
If this is done, the electrical work will not have to be disturbed when the height of the stack 
is increased. 
2. A portion of the stack room may be equipped with a stack of full height and future 
expansion effected by adding additional tiers of ranges, from time to time, to cover the balance 
of the available floor 
space. The overhang 
of the deck floors pro- 
jecting beyond the 
stack ranges can be 
carried by tempora- 
ry struts so arranged 
that they will not 
have to be removed 
until the new ranges 
take up the deck 
loads. The guard 
rails placed between 
these struts can be 
disconnected and re- 
used each time an ad- 
dition is made.

most, should of course be installed first. This necessitates support from the tiers below but 
does not require the installation of full equipment. The initial cost of the stack can be re- 
duced by supplying only the shelf supports and deck framing of the lower ai and omitting 
the shelves and floor slabs. Or the combination cast iron and steel constr ction, page 26, 
may be used. In this case only the deck framing and central steel columns for the shelf 
supports need be supplied in the lower tiers as seen in Fig. 118, page 82, thus further reducing 
the initial expense. The stack may be extended either by attaching shelf supports to the steel 
columns or by building on more tiers above.

  LIBRARY PLANNING 
A SECTION DEVOTED TO SPECIAL ARTICLES ON THE PRINCIPLES 
INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING OF LIBRARY BUILDINGS 
SOME ESSENTIALS OF LIBRARY DESIGN 
By A. D. F. HAMLIN, A. M., L. H. D. 
Professor of the History of Architecture, Columbia University; Consulting Architect to Carnegie 
Library Committee of Brooklyn, N. Y. and to Building Committee for Central Library, Brooklyn. 
| HE public library is one of the 
most highly developed types 
of buildings to be found in 
American architectural prac- 
tice. By careful study of the 
problems it presents, prima- 
rily by librarians and second- 
arily by architects, its require- 
ments and the best means and devices for meeting 
them have been more completely worked out and 
standardized than those of any other type of edifice 
except the modern office building. Taken as a whole, 
the libraries of the United States, large and small, 
represent American architecture well-nigh at its best. 
Library buildings may be broadly divided into 
two main classes, the large and the small, the dif- 
ference between which is one not merely of size but 
also of function. To the first class belong all those 
in which the gathering under one roof of a variety 
of functions and services necessitates a special and 
complex plan for their accommodation; to the second, 
all such as by reason of simplicity of function and 
organization have simple plans and can be super- 
vised by a very small staff. Thus it may happen that 
the single library which serves an entire town of 
moderate size may be smaller and simpler than a 
branch library in a large city. 
All libraries are devices for bringing books and 
readers together. As such they comprise in all cases 
three fundamental elements: First, accommodations 
for the books; Second, accommodations for the    
  active human agents in bringing books and readers 
together. ‘ 
To these fundamental elements may be added 
any number of accessories, such as picture galleries, 
lecture rooms, club rooms, workshops for printing, 
binding and the like. But these are not in them- 
selves essentials of a library building. The three 
classes of accommodations mentioned above are 
essentials and must be provided in every building 
however small. Such accessories as a heating plant, 
toilet rooms, stairs, vestibules etc., are of course 
included in any complete public building. 
The art of library design is the art of providing 
the most perfect accommodations for each of the 
three above named requirements, in such relation to 
each other that the books will be transferred from the 
shelf to the reader in the shortest possible time with 
the fewest steps and least labor both for readers and 
attendants. 
Before discussing the various means for accom- 
plishing these ends, it isin order to set forth briefly 
a more detailed classification of library buildings 
with reference to the character of their service. 
Here again two main divisions appear: reference 
libraries, whose books are used only within the build- 
ing; and circulating libraries, from which the reader 
may borrow books to be taken home. Practically 
all public libraries of this second class provide also 
for the use of books within the building, so that the 
combination of the two kinds of service does not 
constitute a third and distinct class. In such build- 
readers; Third, accommodations for the staff—the | ings the two classes of readers may be served, as in

the smaller libraries, from one central loan desk; or, 
as in the larger libraries, in different rooms, from 
different desks and by distinct sets of attendants. 
Special subdivisions of these two classes are 
formed by the libraries of colleges or other learned 
institutions, professional organizations and other 
societies or clubs. In these the use of the library is 
restricted to certain privileged classes — the members 
of the institution, club or association; and in the 
case of professional and technical libraries, the books 
are confined to a more or less narrow range of sub- 
jects connected with the profession or science to 
which the library belongs. These restrictions give 
occasion for special arrangements not required or 
not practical in the generality of public libraries. 
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR BOOKS 
Taking up now in order the three essential fac- 
tors of a library plan, we may remark that the storage 
of books may be on any one of three systems, or a 
combination of them: (a) the alcove system; (b) the 
open shelf system; (c) the stack system. By the 
first of these, the greater portion of the area of a 
large room, on one or both sides, is divided into 
alcoves by book-cases projecting from the wall. The 
books are stored in these cases and on wall shelves, 
often in two or three stories forming galleries. 
In the majority of public libraries, until the later 
years of the nineteenth century, the major part of the 
books were stored upon the shelves of alcoves two or 
three stories high, opening upon a lofty central hall or 
passage, as in the former Astor Library, New York, 
the Peabody Library in Baltimore, the Cincinnati 
Library (see page 13) and most of the famous Old 
World libraries. The second system is that which 
places the books within the immediate reach of all 
the readers, either in wall cases, or in wall cases and 
wing cases forming alcoves, usually shallow and 
limited to 74 feet in height, so that all volumes are 
within arm’s reach of an ordinary adult. By the 
third system the books are stored in bookstacks, 
forming tiers of shelves in stories not over 73 feet 
high, set as close together as convenience will allow, 
in a wing or structure quite distinct from the read- 
ing rooms, though a part of the same building, and 
placed so as to be directly accessible from the loan 
desk or delivery room. It may be separated by fire- 
walls and fire-proof doors from the rest of the build- 
ing; or, if the whole building be thoroughly fire- 
proof, it may form an open chamber or wing extend-   
  LTD. 
ing back from the main structure. The stacks are 
metal structures, independent of the walls of the 
buildings, and are usually designed and erected by 
concerns which make a specialty of their construction, 
upon specifications prepared by the architect, prefer- 
ably with the technical advice and assistance of the 
stack manufacturer, to fit the structure he has de- 
signed. The system of storage in stacks, which has 
revolutionized American library design, was devised 
by Professor William R. Ware, to solve the problem 
of the enlargement of the Harvard College Library 
in 1876. In these stacks the shelves were of wood, 
but were carried by an iron framework standing in- 
dependent of the walls from the cellar up, and sup- 
porting its own floors. 
In the modern stacks the shelves are usually of 
metal. The stack system is of especial value where 
a large number of volumes must be stored in a re- 
stricted space, or kept together under the control of 
the library staff. The open shelf system — which has 
given rise to much controversy between those who 
believe that the loss of books due to free access of 
readers to shelves is more than offset by the advan- 
tages of such free access, and those who do not—is 
frequently made use of in particular reading rooms 
of libraries which at the same time store the greater 
part of their books in a stack room or stack wing. 
The alcove system has been generally abandoned 
since about 1890, because the projecting stacks or 
cases separating the alcoves cast wide shadows and 
cut off a large part of the room from the view of the 
attendant in charge. Where, however, the number 
of readers is small or restricted to certain definite 
classes, as in most libraries of colleges and clubs or 
societies, well-lighted alcoves may be advantageously 
provided, each alcove being devoted to one general 
department or category of books and made large 
enough to accommodate several readers at one table. 
Such alcoves form a series of quiet study rooms 
opening upon a central hall or corridor, each profit- 
ing by the spaciousness and airiness of the large 
room of which all are a part, while affording some- 
what of the quiet and seclusion of a special study 
room. Modern examples of such a room are seen in 
the University Club and in the Avery Architectural 
Library of Columbia University, both in New York. 
For public libraries in general, however, the arrange- 
ment is wasteful of space and difficult of supervis- 
ion. In the new Springfield, Mass., City Library (see 
pages 202 and 203) there is an interesting combina-

tion of the three systems, in a large open-shelf room 
with two-storied radiating stacks, controlled from 
the attendant’s desk at the center of radiation and 
forming, by their outward divergence, a series of 
open alcoves near the windows, each with its readers’ 
tables. 
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR READERS 
These comprise three principal features: the 
reading room, card catalogs and delivery desk. The 
last claims our attention first as the connecting link 
between the stored books and the readers. It is the 
central point and focus of the library, in which the 
three elements of the library meet—books, staff and 
readers. Theoretically, therefore, it should stand 
between the stack room and the reading rooms, and 
this is its usual physical location. Thus placed, it 
should be so disposed as to “control’— that is, com- 
mand a view of—the largest possible portion of the 
public space in front and on either side—entrance, 
delivery-space, card-catalog-space and reading rooms 
—and at the same time be in closest proximity to 
the chief supply of books, which is usually a stack 
room or stack space. The space behind the delivery 
desk should be ample for the maximum number of 
attendants who may at any time serve it; it is better 
to have it too large than too small. It must be

abundantly lighted, preferably 
by side windows, as overhead 
lighting by a skylight fails early 
in the day. On no account 
should the attendants here be 
compelled to depend during the 
daylight hours on artificial light. 
A sufficient space should be left 
free in front of the desk for the 
readers who are awaiting their 
books or their turn at the desk. 
READING ROOMS 
Reading rooms are of various 
kinds: general reading rooms, 
children’s rooms, reference 
rooms, magazine or periodical 
rooms, special rooms for fiction, 
history, art books, technical 
branches, etc.; special study 
rooms, seminar rooms, in col- 
lege and university libraries for 
conference between students 
and teachers, etc., etc. Each kind of room demands 
its special treatment as to size, location and equip- 
ment, but certain considerations apply to all alike. 
The shape may be almost any simple geometrical 
form consistent with perfect lighting and good ser- 
vice, but it should be without ells, recesses, deep al- 
coves or encumbering columns and projections—the 
simpler the better. Circular and octagonal rooms, 
though often condemned by theorists, present no 
fundamental objections, and where the alcove or 
open shelf system prevails, may be made extremely 
convenient as well as architecturally imposing, as 
in the beautiful Radcliffe Library at Oxford, the 
British Museum reading room in London, the Con- 
gressional Library at Washington and the Columbia 
University Library. The objections alleged against 
these examples are due to defects of planning and 
arrangement in other respects rather than to the 
mere form of the room itself. 
The most important fundamental consideration 
in the form of the reading room is its lighting. If 
lighted from one side, its width should not be more 
than 50 to 60 per cent. greater than its height to 
the top of the windows. Windows may have sills 
as much as 4 or even 5 feet from the floor in a 
room of 14 or 15 feet clear height. This allows of 
wall cases 33 to 4% feet high continuously along 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
THE SNEAD AND COMPANY IRON 
  the window wall in open shelf rooms. It is the high 
light that counts in lighting the further parts of the 
room. A reading room lighted on both sides may 
be 30 or more feet wide with a height of 15 feet. 
Skylighting may be employed in certain cases, but 
as already remarked, it fails early in the day as com- 
pared with side lighting, and should never be the 
sole means of day lighting when side lighting is 
possible. 
Reading rooms should be planned so as to be 
within easy reach of the stack room, unless res- 
tricted to the use of books stored in the reading 
room itself; and so as to be completely visible and 
controllable from the central desk or, as in the 
larger libraries, from that of the special wing or 
department to which each belongs. 
PROVISION FOR THE STAFF 
Accommodations for the staff comprise in gen- 
eral: (a) offices for the librarian and his assistants; 
(b) catalogers’ room or rooms; (c) rooms for special 
services, such as accessions, branch station delivery, 
etc.; (d) workshops for printing, binding, repairing, 
packing and unpacking books, and for mechanical 
repairs; (e) locker rooms, lunch rooms and rest rooms 
for the staff; and (f) janitor’s quarters, store rooms, 
etc. In large libraries and central libraries, a trus- 
tees’ room and committee rooms will be required. 
No general rule’can be laid down for these, but in 
all cases the convenience of the users of the room, 
good lighting and-easy access are the essential con- 
siderations. Avoid dark and tortuous corridors, 
steep and winding stairs, toilet rooms opening di- 
rectly opposite public rooms or upon conspicuous 
passages, and study the minor, as well as the greater, 
amenities and comforts of the service. 
HEATING, VENTILATION, ETC. 
With regard to heating, ventilating and artifi- 
cial lighting, each building presents a special prob- 
lem, and the only general rule to be laid down is that 
of making excessive rather than inadequate provision 
for all three, so as to allow for later expansion. The 
success of a system of heating and ventilation de- 
pends less upon the system than upon the way it is 
designed and carried out. The advice of a compe- 
tent engineer expert in laying out and superintend- 
ing the installation of the system should always be 
sought. The extra expense of such service is in the 
end an economy and not a loss. With regard to   
  WORKS, ETD. 
the artificial lighting two things are important, that 
it should be abundant, and that as far as possible 
all lights should be prevented from glaring directly 
into the eyes of the readers. What is called “in- 
direct lighting” should be resorted to as far as 
practicable. It costs more in current, but saves eye- 
strain. 
PRELIMINARIES TO BUILDING 
In undertaking the erection of a library build- 
ing, supposing an eligible site to have been secured, 
the first step is to formulate a definite program of 
the accommodations to be required, in as great de- 
tail as possible, with the aid of the librarian if he 
has had experience in such matters; otherwise with 
the aid of a consulting expert, who should be either 
an experienced librarian or an architect of estab- 
lished and varied experience in library design. In 
some cases it might even be well to employ experts 
in both professions. The choice of the architect to 
design the building upon the program thus pre- 
pared should be made directly if possible. A com- 
petition may be resorted to in the case of a large 
and important edifice, if the committee in charge 
find themselves unable to agree upon a direct selec- 
tion. In that case care must be taken to place the 
conduct of the competition in the hands of a com- 
petent expert and to make it conform in all respects 
to the requirements of the Code of the American 
Institute of Architects, otherwise it will be impos- 
sible to secure the participation in the competition 
of architects of the highest reputation, whether 
members of the Institute or not. In the case of 
large and costly buildings, it is often a wise economy 
to employ, throughout the whole process of design 
and erection, a competent consulting architect hav- 
ing no other relation to the enterprise. His disin- 
terested advice is often of the greatest value in pre- 
venting or correcting errors of taste or judgment 
on the part alike of committee and architect, avoid- 
ing controversies, and arbitrating them when they 
arise. Never attempt cheese-paring in the matter 
of fees and commissions. Competent architects, 
engineers and expert librarians are worth all they 
cost, and none other should be employed. 
In the matter of cost, it is wise to figure up 
the approximate actual total cubic contents of all 
the required areas, from cellar floor to roof, add 
one-third for walls, stairs, corridors, halls, closets 
and contingencies, and multiply this by a figure of 
[ 106 ]

cost per cubic foot to be furnished byan experienced | 
architect or builder for the type of construction and 
finish desired. Then cut down your requirements 
to remove the excess which this calculation almost 
invariably produces over the sum available—or in- 
crease the appropriation. The actual cost of other 
buildings of approximately like character and size 
will assist in reaching a fair and practical result. 
Committees, like many other clients, are apt to re- 
quire of their architect far more than their funds 
will allow, and this is not fair, either to the archi- 
tect or to themselves. 
As to construction: except where abundant 
funds are available, the cost should go into solid 
construction rather than into architectural splendor. 
Build fire-proof whenever possible. In every case, 
without exception, the book room or stack room 
and stacks should be fire-proof; also the stairs and 
stair halls where a second story exists, and the floor 
construction above the heating plant. Avoid wood- 
en furring and wooden laths in non-fireproof | 
structures. Take special pains with the roof to 
avoid possibility of leakage from either rain or 
snow. Entrust the building of your stacks to none 
but experienced stack-builders. Remember that 
first-cost economies may result in cost for mainten- 
ance and repairs far greater than the interest on the 
saving effected. Solidity, simplicity, durability and 
convenience should be the watchwords of every | 
library building committee. 
CAPACITY 
In figuring on the storage or volume capacity 
of a library, allow a general average of eight vol- 
umes per running foot of single shelving. Law- 
books may be figured at four or five volumes, 
children’s books at ten volumes, per running foot. 
Allow on the average 1 foot of height per shelf. 
Make special allowance for large reference books and 
art books. Stacks and shelving generally are set up 
in 3-foot sections, 7 to 73 feet to a story. Thus 
a double-faced stack section with seven shelves will 
hold on the average 7 x 3 x 8 x 2 volumes=336 
volumes; a single-faced or wall section of the same | 
height, 168 volumes. Double stacks are generally |   LTD. 
set 3 to 4 feet apart. A closely set stack room will 
contain, when all the shelves are filled, twenty-two 
to twenty-five volumes per story per square foot; 
eighteen to twenty volumes is a safer estimate. Thus 
a stack room 20 x 40 feet inside measurement, with 
six stories of stacks, should accommodate 800 x 20 
x 6=96,000 volumes. But this makes no allowance 
for expansion, for which ample room should always 
be left. 
From the “Elementary Principles” laid down 
by the American Library Association to be ob- 
served in library construction, the following coun- 
sels are especially commended to the attention of 
library building-committees: 
“The interior arrangement should be planned 
before the exterior is considered. 
“Plans should provide for future growth and 
development. 
“A library should be carefully planned for 
economical administration. 
“Public rooms should be planned for complete 
supervision by the fewest possible attendants. 
“No convenience of arrangement should be 
sacrificed for architectural effect. 
“There should be good natural light in all parts 
of the building. Windows should extend to the 
ceiling. 
“In a book room or stack, windows should be 
opposite the aisles. 
“Flights of stairs should be straight and not 
circular.” 
To these excellent counsels may be added: 
In public libraries the main floor should be as 
near as possible to the street level. 
Rooms and offices open to the public should be 
arranged so as to be easily and obviously accessible. 
Corridors and communications should be as 
short, straight and direct as possible. Stairs should 
have easy steps, never more than twelve between land- 
ings, and should not be too wide. 
Other things being equal, a building on a simple 
and obvious plan costs less, both to erect and to admin- 
ister, than one built on complex lines.

is constantly commented upon. There are 
many ways of gauging this growth—by 
comparison of the number and sizes of libraries, by 
statements of the area over which they have 
spread, or statistics of their use. A comparative 
study of the older buildings and the new ones will 
serve equally well the purpose of illustrating the 
changed conditions. In Boston the old public 
library on Boylston Street, one of the earliest of 
the alcove type of building, was vacated a score 
of years ago. The Boston Athenaeum, recently 
remodeled, still stands as a representative of this 
class, where the books are arranged in alcoves, 
several tiers high, running around the sides of the 
reading rooms. In New York the Astor Library 
was the best illustration of this style of library 
architecture. Most of the larger cities of the East 
have outgrown this type and moved their book 
collections into modern structures with splendidly 
equipped rooms for different classes of readers and 
fire-proof stacks for the reservoir supply of books. 
In the main buildings of the public libraries of 
Detroit and Cincinnati, old alcove structures are 
still in use and on entering these the visitor is at 
once impressed with the inaccessibility of the books, 
the waste of space from a structural standpoint, 
and the disturbance to readers not only from at- 
tendants going to the various alcoves for books, 
but also from the presence of so many volumes 
rising in tier over tier of ornate iron supports. and 
shelving. The effect is not productive of a quiet 
receptive state of mind. Contrast this sort of a 
reading room with the dignity of Bates Hall in 
Boston, or the new reading room of the New York 
Public Library. Here we do not feel overburdened 
with the accumulation of the ages around us. On 
open shelves around the room are the most im- 
portant reference books, while the main stock of Ts rapid development of American libraries books is in the background and the reader has his 
few selected volumes brought out to him where he 
can study them in surroundings suited to assimila- 
tion. The old idea of the library as a storage place 
for books is giving way to the modern one of the 
library as an educational institution where books 
are to be used as tools. The old alcove construc- 
tion with all the books in sight helped the reader 
to realize the storage idea, but to-day everyone 
knows that the modern stack is the better storage 
house and it is best to have most of the reading 
done outside of the stack. 
In the earliest buildings equipped with stacks 
there was a distinct line of demarcation between 
the stack and the reading room, emphasized by a 
fire-proof wall. The reading room was quite bare 
of books, the entire collection being kept in the 
stack room, which was in consequence called the 
book room. To-day the reading room must be well 
equipped with the best up-to-date reference books, 
some standard authors and open shelves or display 
racks for popular books, while the stacks are used 
for the storage of the bulk of the collection. In the 
smaller libraries the book stack is frequently noth- 
ing more thana single tier of compact double-faced 
shelving at one side or in the back of the reading 
room, to which everybody has free access. In the 
larger libraries one sees the stack in its more 
characteristic form, occupying a separate wing of 
the building, distinguished on the exterior by the 
regular rows of narrow windows, close together, 
suggesting an interior framework of steel, with a 
range of shelving between each pair of windows, 
and with glass or marble floors at such a distance 
apart that a person of average height can with 
ease reach the books on the uppermost shelf, which 
nearly touches the ceiling. While the average 
stack is so planned that the light of day is sufficient 
to enable an attendant to find any book stored in

it, the use of electric light 
makes it possible to erect stacks 
in the interior of buildings and 
for the storage of less used ma- 
terial under ground. Stacks of 
this type do not permit the su- 
pervision of readers and are not 
ordinarily open to the general 
public. 
In planning a library the 
general outlines should be deter- 
mined by thearchitect and libra- 
rian in consultation. Of recent 
years we have seen the archi- 
tects and librarians coming to 
a better understanding of one 
another. Mutual concessions 
have been made and the archi- 
tect has begun to realize that 
he can learn something about 
what a modern library building 
ought to be by consulting the 
librarian, and the latter has con- 
fessed his dependence upon the 
architect for putting into con- 
crete shape whatever is practi- 
cable in hissometimes unformed 
ideas as to the relation of the 
various parts of the building. 
The change in this respect is 
illustrated by comparing the 
splendid accommodations for 
the public card catalog, the 
union catalog and the like in the 
New York Public Library, 
with the lack of adequate pro- 
vision for anything of this kind 
in the Boston Public Library. In one case the libra-_ | 
rian planned for this special feature, while in the | 
other the architect was uninstructed on this particu- 
lar need, or, we might say, the dimensions to which 
the card catalogs were to grow had not been realized. | 
There is a general feeling that the problems | 
of adapting library buildings to the changing | 
methods of library administration will be worked 
out by the library and the architectural professions 
jointly. As stated by one architect, the first work 
must be done by the librarian and should consist 
in reducing to writing a description of the purpose 
and scope of the library, particularly helpful if the | Fig. 136.

library be of some such special type as that of a 
college or university. The study required to formu- 
late and classify his own ideas would doubtless lead 
the librarian into some new conceptions of the pur- 
pose of his library. The future as well as the pres- 
ent must be considered and other libraries should 
be visited with a mind open for new impressions 
and ready to graft any improved ideas upon the 
parent stock. 
The architect, having consulted with the libra- 
rian and being in possession of his data, should 
study the problem sympathetically and try to get the 
point of view of the man who is later to administer

  LIBRARY PLANNING, BOOKSTACKS AND SHELVING 
the building and the institution it,houses. That the 
building should be planned from the inside is an 
axiom not only approved by librarians, but recog- 
nized as fundamental by architects. We know of 
library buildings where the design of the exterior 
has governed the arrangement of the interior to a 
lamentable extent, as where a French renaissance 
exterior of what would seem to a passer-by a one- 
story building, encases a three-story structure. 
There is no special design to which the library 
exterior can be said to conform. Like the interior, 
it has changed with the changing methods of 
library administration. The problem has been to 
provide rooms of varying sizes, arranged for the 
carrying on of certain library work, and the exterior 
is largely determined by the arrangement of these 
inner factors. 
Considerations that will enter into the planning 
of the library, and especially of the stack, are: 
First. The nature of the library, whether a col- 
lege, university or a public library. The books in a 
university library are used intensively by a limited 
number of readers; the under-graduates are not or- 
dinarily admitted to the stacks. In a public library 
the circulation feature is usually predominant. 
Second. Whether wholly a reference library, or 
partly for circulation, or an open access library. If 
the public is to be admitted to the shelves, the aisles 
are naturally made wider than if the stack is pri- 
marily for storage and is open to the attendants only. 
Third. The size of the library. In a very small 
library, free access is taken for granted and wall 
shelving will suffice. For a library requiring only 
a small stack, but one tier high, and with little 
likelihood of outgrowing it, a radiating stack is 
found to reduce the difficulties of supervision. 
Where more than one tier of metal stacks is built 
on the radiating principle, the cost of construction 
is so much higher than in the ordinary parallel 
arrangement as to be prohibitive. 
Fourth. The class of books to be housed. Scien- 
tific and technological books require deeper shelving 
than volumes of belles lettres. Books on architec- 
ture and the fine arts require special shelving, while 
newspapers are a problem by themselves. No class 
of books will eat up the shelving so rapidly as our 
metropolitan dailies. If the policy of the library is 
to include any special collection of considerable size 
along any line it would be very helpful if it were 
known in advance of planning the building. If bound   newspapers are to be indulged in to any great extent’ 
it would be desirable to have the stack run below 
ground where the simplest form of structural work 
could be used to accommodate these bulky volumes. 
One item that will help decide the question of 
the size of the stack needed is the average annual 
growth of the library. For the average public library 
it will be necessary to consider in this connection 
such factors as the number of books discarded each 
year, and the number of these that are replaced. 
In a college or university library the discards are 
comparatively few, being mainly in the class of text 
books, and required or collateral reading. In the 
smaller public library the average number of books 
out in circulation will enter into the problem. A 
given amount of shelving will accommodate a certain 
number of books; but if in a small library one-fifth 
of the collection is as a rule out in circulation only 
four-fifths the amount of shelving is necessary that 
would be required if the books were not allowed to 
circulate or were of a character which would not 
tempt readers to borrow them. Of course, it is at 
no time desirable to have all the shelves filled to 
overflowing. From a fourth to a third of vacant 
shelf room ought to be available for shifting the 
collection when large additions are made or when 
reclassification of any section becomes desirable. 
The custodians of many of our smaller public 
libraries feel the necessity for constant “weeding 
out” of their collections, sending to the larger 
depository libraries of the neighborhood such 
material as has not been called for within a given 
time, or disposing by sale of items which seem un- 
suited to their particular clientele. This tends to 
keep down the size of the collection and to prevent 
its growing too rapidly out of its shelf accom- 
modations. 
But do what we librarians may, books will 
accumulate on our hands at a surprisingly rapid 
rate. The common mistake is to build too small 
rather than too large a building, and especially too 
small a stack. I know of one college library that 
had no sooner been comfortably settled in its new 
Carnegie building than its custodian was compelled 
to ask for additional stack room; and I know of a 
university library which has a building under way 
with a stack so wholly inadequate that one would 
think that even the trustees of the institution could 
see what they were bringing upon themselves—the 
necessity of an extension within a few years, with 
[ 1 ]  
-P-A-G-E-114
THE SNEAD AND COMPANY IRON WORKS, 
the risk of the usual patchwork effect. It is seldom 
indeed that a university library is planned with a com- 
prehensive scheme for future development. Students 
come and go, their numbers increasing but slowly, 
while the books come, for the most part, to stay. 
Hence the book storage space is liable to be outgrown 
much sooner than the accommodations for readers. 
A location that must present architectural 
facades on all sides is unfavorable to extension. It 
is better to have a distinct front and rear. A cor- 
ner lot or a site with parking all around it necessi- 
tates a greater expenditure for building materials, 
while an inside lot, with good frontage, admits of a 
utilitarian stack on the rear without any architec- 
tural pretensions whatsoever. Sloping ground is 
advantageous for practical reasons as giving a chance 
for a high basement in the rear, with two or more 
stack levels below the main reading room floor. Of 
course it is desirable that the library should be 
separated from other buildings as far as possible, so 
as to give an abundance of light and air on all sides 
and to diminish the danger from fire. 
To sum up: The first thing for a board of 
trustees to do in planning a library building is to 
get a librarian, if a competent one is not already in 
their service. It will not do to think that a make- 
shift librarian will answer during the period of plan- 
ning and building, and that a better one can be en-   
  LTD. 
gaged after the new building is erected and occupied. 
It may then be too late to rectify blunders which will 
represent a serious annual drain on the resources of 
the library, costing in the aggregate many times the 
difference between the salary of the makeshift and 
the competent librarian. The competent librarian 
should be on hand from the beginning, even before 
the new building is thought of. He may be needed 
to point out the necessity for better accommodations, 
or to create a demand for larger activities. When 
on hand it will be impossible for him to be ignored. 
If competent he will make himself so useful to both 
the trustees and the architect that neither will wish 
to ignore him in planning for a new building. Of 
course it is unfortunate that not all librarians realize 
that they should criticize practical arrangements and 
not architectural details, and that not all architects 
understand that the ideas of the librarian should be 
given the fullest consideration in order to make a 
truly successful building, which requires first of all 
that it should be good from a utilitarian point of view 
and secondly from an aesthetic standpoint. But the 
architects and the librarians are coming to recognize 
where their separate provinces lie, what interests 
they have in common, and how they can co-operate 
in building the libraries of the future, which, while 
beautiful, must first serve the purposes of the insti- 
tutions they house.

SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY PLANNING 
By EDWARD L. TILTON, Architect 
Reprinted from the Library Journal of September, 1912 
a science, since it is possible to formulate 
certain rules which, if carefully followed, 
will produce a methodical and rational result; it is 
likewise an art, since it calls for a skillful and sys- 
tematic arrangement of means for the attainment 
of some desired end. The combination will produce 
a construction both practical and aesthetic. 
The principles involved require the accommo- 
dation of the greatest number of readers or patrons 
under hygienic conditions, and with due care for 
their comfort, for the housing of the maximum 
number of books and contents, and for an aesthetic 
expression of the building’s purpose, both within 
and without. These principles are fundamental, 
and are applicable to all libraries; they are likewise 
sufficiently flexible to admit the inclusion of any 
new discovery which may develop better arrange- 
ments as the science advances. The method of 
procedure is simple. Given a certain appropriation, 
not over 80 per cent. should be devoted to the 
construction, including heating and lighting, and 
from 20 to 22 per cent. to equipment, furniture and 
fees. The following formula will apply : 
= fe" ° be 
In which x equals the size of plan in square feet; (a) 
equals the appropriation; (b) equals the cost of 
construction per cubic foot, which for a fireproof 
building might range from twenty-five to forty 
cents, and for a non-fireproof building from fifteen 
to thirty cents, depending upon various local con- 
ditions, including prevailing rates of wages and 
materials; (c) equals the height of the building, 
measured from the basement floor level to the top of 
the roof if flat, or half up the slope of the roof if 
pitched; the height of a basement and one-story 
building is about 30 feet, and the height of a base- Pes library planning may now be called 
*78 per cent. is a closer approximation, but 80 per cent. is 
taken for easy figuring to demonstrate the theory. See the 
tabulation near the end of this article.   ment and two-story building is about 40 to 45 feet. 
To apply the formula concretely, let us assume 
the appropriation (a) to be $150,000, 80 per 
cent. of which would be $120,000. If a fireproof 
two-story and basement library be required, (b) 
would equal, say, $.30, and (c) 40 feet, or be would 
equal 12 which, divided into (.80a), $120,000, would 
give a resultant x of 10,000 square feet, which 
would permit of a building 100 x 100 feet, 80 x 125 
feet, or similar proportions, in deciding which the 
shape of the lot might be a factor. 
With the total appropriation of $150,000, we 
should endeavor to house 150,000 volumes (or one 
dollar per volume), and to accommodate 300 readers 
(at $500 each), allowing a maximum of 30 square 
feet per seat; this would require 9,000 square feet 
of floor space for the various rooms destined for 
the use of readers, such as reading, reference, 
children’s, periodical, newspaper and such special 
rooms as the librarian may demand for medical 
and historical collections, club rooms, ete. 
The 150,000 volumes may be distributed, allot- 
ting approximately 100,000 to the stacks and 50,000 
to shelving throughout the various reading rooms. 
The size of the stack may be determined by divid- 
ing the 100,000 volumes by 20, which gives 5,000 
square feet for a tier of seven shelves, and allows 
sufficient space for aisles and gangways; this 5,000 
square feet may be arranged in two or more tiers, as 
the exigencies of the case demand, giving 2,500 
square feet if in two tiers of seven shelves each; 
1,250 if in four tiers, etc. When possible, it is well 
to allow 20 per cent. leeway to these figures, in 
order to avoid close stacking and to give some free 
shelf space. Several advantages are gained by keep- 
ing the stacks below the level of the first floor, as in 
the new Springfield, Mass., Library, (see pages 202 
and 203) and the Somerville, Mass., Library (see 
page 225) thereby leaving the valuable main floor 
space free for readers and reference shelving. In 
the latter building the stacks do not extend to an

-P-A-G-E-116
THE 
  outside wall, but are lighted by “second light” 
through glazed partitions, leaving the periphery of 
the building free for reading rooms. This idea is 
also applicable to stacks extending vertically through 
the building, and has several decided advantages. 
Darkness is better for books than direct sunlight, 
and an interior stack may be readily ventilated. A 
plan to be economical and well laid out should have 
a minimum space devoted to corridors and stairways, 
and a maximum space for library purposes. In 
“monumental” libraries recently constructed, only 
50 per cent. of the ground area is available for li- 
brary use, the remainder being given up to walls, 
halls, stairs, etc. In the Springfield Library the simi- 
lar proportions on the main floor are 85 per cent. 
and 15 per cent. 
In the imaginary problem under consideration, 
with a ground plan of 10,000 square feet, we can 
assume, therefore, that 8,500 square feet of the main 
floor may be divided so as to allow, say, for the 
delivery room 500 square feet; for reading rooms, 
open shelf rooms for fiction, reference and other 
rooms as the librarian may designate, 8,000 square 
feet. The basement may need to accommodate 
heating and mechanical plants besides stack space, 
which will reduce somewhat the residuum to be as- 
signed to newspaper rooms, lecture room and work 
rooms for receiving, unpacking, binding, etc. The 
second floor’s available area may also be less than 
that of the raain floor, owing to possible light wells. 
The available areas may, therefore, approxi- 
mate: basement, 6,500 square feet; main floor, 8,500 
square feet; second floor, 5,000 square feet; or a 
grand total of 20,000 square feet, to be apportioned 
among the various departments possibly as follows: 
Delivery room 500 
Several rooms for readers’ use 9,000 
Stack (area of one tier) . 3,000 
Catalog and work rooms 2,500 
Librarian and staff rooms 2,500 
Lecture rooms 1,050 
Collections, ete . 1,450 
The lecture room, unless usable for other pur- 
poses, is ‘apt to make the least return, and should 
not, therefore, be too large nor occupy valuable 
space on the main floors. For a building to cost 
$150,000, the lecture room might be in the base- 
ment and limited to 150 seats, which at 7 square 
feet, will require 1,050 square feet to allow for 
proper aisles; the height to ceiling should be not less SNEAD AND COMPANY IRON WORKS, LTD. 
than 12 feet, making 12,600 cubic feet and at 30 
| cents (the cubic foot cost of our building) will rep- 
resent $3,780 as the amount invested in the lecture 
room, the interest on which at 5 per cent. is $189, 
to which must be added the expense of light, heat 
and janitor’s labor. It is usually better economy to 
hire a hall in the neighborhood for lectures or en- 
tertainments likely to attract large audiences and 
include only a small lecture room in the library 
building. 
| The working space and rooms should be 
ample to insure the proper running of the machinery 
of administration. Comfortable quarters for the 
staff, including rest room, locker room and kitchen- 
ette, will yield better returns in efficiency and 
library results than those obtained from a dispro- 
portionate lecture room. A good librarian and an 
efficient staff are as essential to a library as a com- 
petent president and faculty are to a college, and 
it is equally important to maintain an esprit de corps 
and an esprit d’ouvrage if the public are to receive 
adequate return for their financial and spiritual 
investment. To insure a continuation of such “divi- 
| dends,” the humanistic element should be considered 
with a solicitude at least equal to that accorded to 
the machinery of a steamship. 
The comfort and convenience of the public are 
enhanced by the proper location, arrangement and 
design of the reading room. The collaboration of 
librarian and architect is here vitally requisite. 
The size and shape of any reading room can best 
be determined by plotting out the furniture. The 
tables should be spaced about five feet apart and 
the same distance from the walls of theroom. The 
details are too diverse to enlarge upon here, since 
the individual preferences of the librarian and the 
requirements differ with every locality. But a 
fundamental condition applicable to every case is 
that of maintaining a reasonable pro rata cost per 
reader accommodated. In our supposititious problem 
we have allowed 9,000 square feet for reading and 
ancillary rooms to accommodate 300 readers at 30 
square feet for each. The appropriation being 
$150,000 makes each of the 300 seatings represent 
$500 outlay. 
The lighting of the library is of paramount 
importance, and to accomplish a satisfactory result | 
it is well to follow the school house requirements 
and make the glass area of reading rooms equal 
| to 20 per cent. of their floor areas. The light from   [ 114 ]
-P-A-G-E-117
  
LIBRARY PLANNING, BOOKSTACKS AND SHELVING 
the windows will be effective in the room fora 
distance equal to about one and one-half times the 
height of the top of window from the floor. Ceil- 
ing lighting will be advisable for spaces not properly 
illumined by the windows. 
A module or width of bays approximately 12 
feet, will be found to produce a good relation be- 
tween solids and openings. For our building of 
125 feet by 80 feet, there is no common denom- 
inator, so we can modify the dimensions to 129 feet 
10 inches by 77 feet 5% inches, which will also 
produce 10,000 square feet, and give ten modules 
to the front and six modules to the sides of 12 feet 
10% inches. 
Artificial illumination is usually and preferably 
secured by some electric system. The carbon lamp 
is yielding to the tungsten lamp, owing to the 
increased economy secured by its greater power at 
less wattage. The amount of light required may 
be roughly figured at one watt (tungsten lighting) 
for each square foot of floor area when a direct 
lighting system is used. Indirect or semi-direct will 
require a little more wattage per square foot. The 
main floor of our building, with its 10,000 square 
feet, will therefore require for proper direct illumi- 
nation enough lamps to yield 10,000 watts. If 30 
watt lamps be used, there will be a total of 333 
lamps, and if three lamips be used to each fixture, 
there will be 111 outlets; and if each circuit of 
twelve lamps has a switch, there will be twenty- 
eight switch outlets, or a total of 139 outlets, at an 
approximate cost of $5 each, or $695 for the main 
floor. It is not necessary, however, to have so 
many switches, since most of the circuits can be con- 
trolled directly from the panel board. This $695 
may be reduced to terms per cubic foot. The main 
floor, with 10,000 square feet, may be assumed to 
have a height of 15 feet or 150,000 cubic feet, 
which, divided into $695, gives .46c, or less than one- 
half cent per cubic foot. The total cubage of our 
building, including basement and second stories, 
being 400,000, will require on above basis $1,840 
to cover the expense of the wiring for lamps. The 
panel boards for the several circuits in the reading 
rooms are best located near the delivery desk, 
within easy reach of the library attendant. 
In addition to the electric light wiring, proper 
allowances must be made for an interior telephone 
system and public telephone connections, for call 
bells, for standard clock system and watchman’s   clock, for electric book lifts, for all of which, in 
the building under consideration, we may set aside 
$4,500. 
The heating of the library is usually accom- 
plished by a steam system. The number of square 
feet of radiation is calculated by the Mills formula 
of 2-20-200; that is, the sum of the glass area, 
divided by 2; the solid wall area by 20, and the 
cubic foot contents of the room by 200. For ex- 
ample, the building we are assuming covers 10,000 
square feet, by 40 feet in height, or 400,000 cubic 
feet; the glass area equals 2,000 square feet (or 20 
per cent. of floor area); the wall area equals the 
periphery of the building (120 + 80+ 120+ 80), 
400 lineal feet by 40 feet height, or 16,000 square 
feet, less the 2,000 feet of glass, or 14,000 square 
feet. The following formula will apply: 
ga, wa, c 
= "2 F a9 * 200 
in which x equals the square foot of radiation re- 
quired; ga equals glass area of windows and ceiling 
lights; wa equals solid wall area; cc equals cubic con- 
tents. Applying this formula to the above figures, 
we obtain the following results: 
2,000 , 14,000 , 400,000 _ 
“2 Tb 29 F 299 700 square feet of radiation. If the radiation be con- 
cealed behind shelving or seats, it should be in- 
creased by about one-third, or, say, 1,200 square feet, 
giving a total of 4,900 square feet, to which add 25 
per cent. for supply and return pipes, and another 
25 per cent. for reserve power in boiler, or 50 per 
cent. of 4,900 equals 2,450, giving a grand total of 
7,350 square feet, which indicates the requisite boiler 
rating. The cost of this will approximate 75 cents 
per foot, or $5,512.50 for heating the building. An 
additional percentage of radiation should be allowed 
for walls on north sides and for ceilings under flat 
roofs, but 5 per cent. of the total appropriation 
should cover the expense of “direct” steam system. 
The mechanical ventilation in an ordinary li- 
brary building may be limited to the lecture room, 
and a possible small amount in the shape of “direct- 
indirect” for certain of the reading rooms, the cost 
of which would approximate 25 cents additional, or 
$1,837.50, entailing the total estimate for heating 
and ventilating of $7,350, or one dollar per foot of 
of the sum above. A “plenum” system for the entire 
building is expensive to operate, and experience 
shows that when installed the use of the fan is apt

runs beneath windows, either high or low, there is | 
an opportunity to arrange an effective method of 
ventilation by opening the window slightly and insert- 
ing a deflector. Even with closed windows there is 
a continual circulation of the room air engendered | 
by the spaces containing radiation between walls | 
and back of shelving, which act like flues. | 
The furniture will consist of delivery or charg- | 
ing counter, catalog cases, bulletin boards, tables, 
chairs, shelving and the various items of equipment 
for the rooms devoted to periodicals, newspapers, 
fine arts and special collections, as well as the suite 
for the librarian and staff, for the cataloging and 
work rooms, and for the lecture room. 
Our building, as before stated, is intended to 
accommodate 300 readers, and for convenience we 
can assume the tables will be the standard three 
feet by five feet size for four persons, making a 
total of seventy-five tables and 300 chairs. The 
50,000 volumes to be distributed throughout rooms | 
will need about 1000 feet of bookcases, five shelves 
high in children’s room and seven shelves high else- 
where, and will cost about $3,500. Metal shelving 
can be installed for nearly the same price. 
The stacks form an important adjunct to the 
library. As before indicated, the amount of stack 
required may be calculated by multiplying the square 
foot area of the stack room by twenty volumes if 
but one tier of seven shelves be required; by forty 
if two tiers be required, and so on. Conversely, if 
we wish to know the size of stack room necessary to 
house 100,000 volumes in one tier seven shelves 
high, we divide by twenty, giving 5,000 square feet; 
for two tiers divide by forty, giving 2,500 square 
feet; for three tiers, divide by sixty, giving 1,667 
square feet, and so on. Metal stack construction is 
an invention of recent years, and its rapid develop-

ment has kept pace with the modern library de- 
mands. There are several makes of metal stacks 
upon the market, each claiming to have special 
features of superiority over its competitors. The 
system originally conceived by Bernard R. Green, 
and installed in the Library of Congress, has since 
from time to time, been improved and used in build- 
ings where the conditions imposed heavy loadings of 
superimposed tiers of floors, and also where com- 
pactness, as well as strength, was a desideratum. 
The weight of each tier of stacks, with its com- 
plement of books, may be figured at 125 pounds to 
the square foot. The cost may be roughly com- 
puted at $2 per square foot of stack room for each 
tier, or 10 cents per volume. 
To summarize the foregoing, we can subdivide 
the $150,000 appropriation under the following 
heads: 
General construction, exclusive of 
heating and electric work 724% 
Heating work with limited 
ventilation 4 “ 
Electric work . 13 “ 
Stacks 74

After analyzing and proportioning the various 
elements of the plan as indicated, the architect’s 
skill should be invoked to produce an artistic building. 
The scientific or mathematical consideration of the 
problem resembles the human skeleton, which is 
similar in child and adult, black, white and red men, 
but the flesh covering may over one be beautiful and 
over another be the reverse. 
It is not possible to give more than general 
hints in an article of this description since there are 
many ramifications which lead off into various refine- 
ments that make for economy of plan and expression 
in design.

cents, and in some cases to a little under 20 cents. 
“The following computations have been made 
of the cost of a building in relation to its seating 
capacity for readers and to its volume capacity: 
Allowing 30 square feet floor space to each reader 
as full capacity in rooms allotted to reading and 
reference purposes, then $500 per reader should 
easily cover the cost of an average suitable building 
and permit the inclusion of a lecture room and all 
the necessary elements and accessories. The cost 
of housing books varies from one to two dollars per 
volume, the former where stack construction and 
wall shelving in reading room is used, the latter if 
the open shelf and wall shelving is adopted. The 
first type of shelving brings the book to the reader; 
the second, the reader to the book. 
“The location of a branch building in towns of 
the second or third class is probably best deter- 
mined by the conditions geographical, topographical 
or racial, and the size and cost of the building by the 
number of population in the section to be served 
reckoned roughly at about two dollars per capita.   A city of about 300,000 population and covering say 
an area of 30 square miles would have possibly one- 
third of the people served directly by the central 
building, leaving 200,000, or 7,000 people per square 
mile beyond the center, and each branch might 
serve four square miles; 7.e., a mile each way from 
the branch, or 28,000 people, requiring therefore in 
the city a total of seven branches. Business centers 
also control the location of branches. 
“When a building, as before stated, costs about 
$2 for every volume housed therein, the cost of inter- 
est and maintenance might be approximated as 35 
cents per volume, as representing the minimum an- 
nual average expense of each book upon the shelves. 
Or to put it in another way, 25,000 volumes will 
require, say, a $50,000 building. Add for expense 
of land, say, $5,000, making building «nd land cost 
$55,000 on which interest at 5 per cent amounts to 
$2,750. To this add annual upkeep charges such 
as salaries, light, heat, etc; say, $6,000, or total of 
$8,750 for 25,000 volumes, which give an average 
amount of 35 cents per volume as a minimum for a 
small library.”

A LIBRARY BOOKSTACK IN THE DARK 
By BERNARD R. GREEN, C. E. 
Read at the Baltimore meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1909 
  NTIL recently the free admission of daylight 
had been deemed an indispensable requisite 
in the bookstacks of libraries. Masses of 
shelving were wont, on that account, to be kept small 
because artificial illumination was not only inade- 
quate and expensive, but overheating and dangerous. 
The breadth of aisles was limited to secure even a 
moderate amount of daylight. It was likewise con- 
sidered necessary to locate the exterior walls so that 
they would give not only free access to the light, but 
would insure a safe distance from exterior fire. To 
all this handicap was added the even greater neces- 
sity of a proper regard to architectural appearance. 
Under such conditions large isolated lots and 
wide courts seemed to be the only solution at hand. 
The bookstacks, in consequence, extended over 
wide areas at ever increasing distances from the 
center of use. But even here there were limits— 
the walls must not be so high as to overshadow each 
other. The result was that not more than a third 
of the ground devoted to the stack could be used 
by it. Added to this inconvenience was not only the 
costly space-consuming expanse of exterior but the 
proverbial fickleness and frequent failure of the day- 
light, due to cloudy weather, the time of day and the 
seasons of the year. These accumulated uncertain- 
ties have at last not only rendered artificial illum- 
ination a necessity, but an economic advantage. 
Moreover, sunlight is often so bright and hot 
that it becomes injurious to the exposed books, 
thereby making adjustable shades an indispensable 
part of the equipment of a stack room. Now, win- 
dow shades, it is well known, are not only expensive 
in their first cost.and in their maintenance, but they 
are also expensive in the time and the annoyance 
they require for their operation. Even the diffused 
daylight, which their adjusted aid ‘gives, is more or 
less injurious to books in the long run. Books, in 
fact, are much better off in the dark. 
In the construction and arrangement of a book- 
stack, therefore, the maximum of economy will be reached if the shelving be so compacted that only 
space for convenient access to all the books is pro- 
vided. That is to say, every possible cubic foot of 
the entire bulk of the stack should be available for 
the books themselves and the minimum of the cubic 
contents taken up by the stack structure and the 
space necessary for access to the books. 
Such a structure is at the present day made 
entirely feasible by the use of light steel framework 
and shelving, mechanical elevators and book car- 
riers, artificial ventilation, and the incandescent 
electric light, or tungsten lamp. The Library of 
Congress has used such a stack to fill up one of its 
courts. The court is about 150 feet long, 74 feet 
wide and 80 feet high, with a roof resting on the 
numerous slender steel columns which carry the 
stack structure, from the foundation to the roof. 
There are nine tiers or stories of shelving with a low 
basement for the distribution of fresh air circulating 
upward through the stack and discharged at the roof. 
Great economy in the consumption of electric cur- 
rent is secured by the use of time-limit switches 
which automatically turn off the lights a few minutes 
after they are connected. 
The fact that the stack is enclosed in a court 
and surrounded by a heated building makes the heat- 
ing of it a simple matter, because only a moderate 
quantity of fresh air is needed to counteract the 
relatively slow vitiation of the interior air of the 
stack. The heating of such a stack may be done 
with either direct or indirect radiators. Those con- 
taining warm water are preferable. As the stack 
decks contain sufficient openings for ventilation, 
neither flues nor special airways are needed for the 
passage of the constantly upward flow of the air, 
which is controlled by plenum and exhaust fans at 
the bottom and top respectively. 
In economy of space, in bulk, simplicity, and 
consequent low cost of construction and maintenance, 
such a stack is analogous to an ice house, which is 
but a protecting plain shell or envelope, filled solidly

with ice. The purpose of the shell is not to carry 
floors or roof, or shelving, but is to exclude weather 
and fire and to prevent depredation. Viewed in this 
light, the stack may be built as a simple mass of 
shelving within the walls of an existing court as at 
the Library of Congress, or it may be built within 
solid plain walls constructed for the purpose, with- 
out windows or openings. In fact, such a stack may 
be built, embodied and concealed, anywhere within 
a library building, local conditions of space, cost, 
administration, and architectural considerations 
being the only determining factors. 
The bookstack, especially if it were a large one, 
has up to this time been the bete noir of the architect, 
who not only sought to give it the demanded day- 
light but also to harmonize its architecture with that 
of the rest of the building. To-day the shape of 
the bookstack, its location, dimension and frontage 
are relieved of the all-controlling daylight stipu- 
lation. It may be a tower or a well, or both com- 
bined, or an inside mass hidden or buried, invisible

and unsuspected, leaving the well-lighted, attractive 
spaces for the various library purposes. With sucha 
bookstack, books may be very conveniently read in 
the daylight and then stored away safely in the dark. 
The height, length and breadth of such a stack 
are limited only by the economy of elevator service, 
ground damp proofing, and lateral distance from the 
center of administration or use. It is obvious, how- 
ever, that these limitations admit of enormous pos- 
sibilities. Why, for example, might not a stack be 
forty tiers high and 400 feet square, holding in con- 
veniently accessible arrangement, 100 millions of 
volumes and occupying but one ordinary city block? 
Fire is not a serious danger with such a book- 
stack, because books, as they are ordinarily placed 
on the shelves, do not burn or communicate fire 
readily, and the stack itself is wholly fireproof. If 
so desired, the long stack may be divided vertically 
by a fireproof wall and the tall stack horizontally by 
fireproof flooring, into compartments, like the hull 
of a ship.

SNEAD STACK INSTALLATIONS 
PARTIAL LIST WITH COST DATA 
OME general information on the cost of library 
buildings may be found on page 106 of Pro- 
fessor A. D. F. Hamlin’s article, “Some 
Essentials of Library Design” and in Mr. Edward 
L. Tilton’s article, “Scientific Library Planning,” 
page 113. 
Regarding the relative costs of buildings, Archi- 
tect Grant C. Miller writes: “In comparing the costs 
of buildings one should not compare the cost per cu- | 
bic foot of a large building with that of a small build- 
ing, as a small building will cost slightly more in 
proportion. It is almost impossible to compare the 
cost per cubic foot of a building designed by one 
architect with that of a building designed by another 
architect. There are as many different ways of 
measuring and comparing as there are individuals. 
We take the cubic contents from the cement floor 
in the basement to the top of the ceiling joists in 
the top story. You will note that the attic spaces 
are not measured. Of course it is not wise to com- 
pare a steep pitched roof with a flat roofed build- ing, but compare only buildings of a similar type. 
We find that public library buildings, not fireproof 
—hbut of especially good construction otherwise, 
cost anywhere from 17 to 25 cents a cubic foot. 
The classic style of architecture costs from about 
20 to 25 cents a cubic foot, and other styles of a 
more economical nature from 17 to 20 cents. The 
library for the University of Tennessee at Knox- 
ville (non-fireproof) cost about 23 cents a cubic 
foot. The library for Purdue University at 
Lafayette, Ind. (fireproof) cost 25 cents a cubic foot. 
Both of these buildings are in comparatively cheap 
localities. If one were to erect buildings of this type 
in Iowa, Minnesota, or even Wisconsin, the price 
per cubic foot would be a little higher. In general, 
fireproof buildings cost about 20 per cent more than 
those that are not. In quoting the price per cubic 
foot for building, we have included most of the equip- 
ment, that is, the equipment of the first floor in the 
public libraries and nearly all of the equipment in 
college libraries.”

Owing to the necessity of limiting the size of this book, it has proved impracti- 
cable to illustrate more than a small part of the material available. Consequently 
some of the most important buildings have been omitted in order to show a 
variety of typical examples and to give representation to different localities.

N ACT of Congress, passed April 15, 1886, 
A authorized the construction of a library 
building substantially according to the plan 
submitted by John L. Smithmeyer, with such 
modifications as might be found necessary or ad- 
vantageous. The original designs for the building 
were furnished by John L. Smithmeyer and Paul 
J. Pelz, and the architectural details were worked 
out by Paul J. Pelz and Edward P. Casey. 
The construction of the building was under the 
direction of a commission until October, 1888, when, 
before the foundations were laid, the commission 
was abolished by Congress and the work placed 
under the control of General Thomas L. Casey, 
the Chief of Engineers of the Army. He placed 
Bernard R. Green in charge as superintendent and 
engineer, who upon the death of General Casey, 
March 25, 1896, succeeded to full control until the 
building was completed February 28, 1897, at the 
cost, exclusive of the land, of $6,344,585.34. 
The building is approximately 470 feet by 340 
feet and had originally four inner courts 150 feet by 
75 feet to 100 feet, and it consists of cellar, basement, 
first, second and attic stories, with an octagonal 
dome rising 120 feet above the main roof. Later 
a ten-tier stack was constructed in the southeast 
court, the roof of this structure being carried 
directly on the steel frame of the stack. 
The central feature is the main reading room, 
100 feet in diameter, extending from the first floor 
to the inner dome, a distance of 125 feet and lighted 
through eight large arched windows in the clere- 
story. It has 210 desks, thirty-six alcove tables and 
can accommodate 250 readers at one time. In the 
alcoves are two tiers of metal shelving holding 
over 120,000 volumes. The distributing desk in 
the center of the reading room is connected with 
the three main stacks by pneumatic tubes and with 
the north and south stacks by mechanical book 
carriers. 
Each stack has nine “decks” or floors, each 7 feet high. The dimensions and capacities of the 
stacks are as follows: 
Location Depth Length Height Volumes 
capacity 
North stack 44’8” x 110/0” x 65/0” = 713,500. 
South stack 44/8” x 110’0% x 650% =— 713,500 
East stack 44/8” x 30/0” x 65/0” == 173,000 
Southeast court stack 74/0” x 150/07 x 80’0” 1,045,000 
Total capacity of four main stacks, 2,645,000 
The Smithsonian room on the second floor is 
131 feet by 35 feet and has a book stack of three tiers 
provided with an electric elevator. The capacity 
of this stack is about 150,000 volumes. 
A three-tier stack has also been installed in 
the north curtain, second floor, for manuscripts and 
documents, the total capacity being 250,000 volumes. 
The westerly stacks in the first tier are enclosed 
with plate glass for greater security. 
In the attic are rooms for photography, repair 
of prints and manuscripts, storage, a public restau- 
rant, and a room containing a book stack of 80,000 
volumes capacity for the Slavic section. 
The music division occupies a portion of the 
north curtain in the basement story, with auxillary 
bookstacks in the cellar directly below. It has a stor- 
age capacity of 12,840 feet of 13 inch deep shelving. 
Outside of the three main stacks the basement 
story contains the reading room for the blind, the 
departments of music and copyrights, a branch of 
the Government Printing Office, the offices of the 
superintendent, chief clerk and the watch, and the 
mail room which handles all material arriving at 
or dispatched from the library building, including 
all mail matter and books delivered for outside use. 
The building already contains over one hun- 
dred miles of shelving for books exclusive of that 
for prints, maps and charts. 
The cellar space is devoted to the machinery 
room, heating apparatus, workshops and storage. 
The boilers and coal vaults are located under the 
parking, near but quite outside the building, at the 
east front.

NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY Carrire & Hastinas, Architects 
Joun SHaw Bituinas, Late Director (deceased) 
on the 27th of May, 1895, by the consoli- 
dation of the Astor Library, the Lenox 
Library and the Tilden Trust. At that time a 
board of twenty-one trustees was elected from the 
boards of these three corporations, and provision 
was made for maintaining a free public library, with 
such branches as might be considered advisable. 
The site chosen for the main building was the 
eastern end of Bryant Park on Fifth Avenue, 
between 40th and 42nd Streets, then occupied by | 
the old reservoir. In 1897 the City of New York | 
agreed to erect a building which was to be admin- | 
istered by the trustees, with certain restrictions as to 
time of opening and the maintenance of a circulating | 
library. The city furnished both site and money 
for construction. 
On November 11, 1897, the architects for the 
new building were selected in competition. The 
removal of the reservoir was begun in June, 1899 
and on May 23, 1911, the building, completed at a 
cost of $9,466,566, was opened to the public. 
To the librarian the most interesting features of 
the plan are: First, the placing of the main reading 
room on the top floor at the rear, immediately above 
the main stack room, its floor being supported by 
the stack uprights. This gives a well lighted, well 
ventilated, quiet room conveniently located over the 
book “reservoir.” Second, the arrangement and dis- 
tribution of special reading rooms in such a way as 
to make the books shelved there easily available for 
use in the main reading room, and to allow unre- 
stricted access to the books on the part of the investi- 
gators and special students. Third, the grouping of 
the administration rooms and offices on the south 
side of the building, leaving the east, north and 
west sides for reading rooms or storage of books. 
The building is in the form of a rectangle, 390 | 
feet front by 270 feet deep. The heights of the 
floors are as follows: cellar, 13 feet; basement, 15 
feet, first story, 22 feet 6 inches; second story, 16 
feet; third story, ceiling height 11 to 23 feet; main T= New York Public Library was founded Epwin H. Anperson, Director 
reading room, 50 feet. The heights of the base- 
ment, first and second stories were made multiples 
of the stack tier height, 7 feet 6 inches, in order 
that the first, third and fifth stack decks might line 
up with the main floors of the building. The area 
covered by the library, exclusive of the open south 
court, is 115,000 square feet and its cubic contents 
is 10,380,000 cubic feet. 
The material used is largely Vermont marble 
bonded in brick walls, steel beams with terra cotta 
arch floor construction, roof of copper and glass and 
window frames of bronze. 
The main bookstack occupies the larger part 
of the rear of the building and extends upward 
through the basement, first and second stories. It 
is 297 feet long, 78 feet wide, and is made up of 
seven tiers, each 7 feet 6 inches high, with deck 
floors of 13 inch marble. 
Each stack tier is divided into four quadrants 
designated as Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and 
Southeast. Each section consists of twenty-nine 
double-faced ranges, composed of ten compartments 
with six adjustable and one fixed shelf in each com- 
partment. Along the walls are compartments 24, 
26 and 30 inches deep, fitted with sliding shelves. 
In all the main stack contains 96,000 adjustable and 
16,000 fixed shelves, which placed end to end would 
extend a distance of 63.3 miles. The capacity of 
this big stack is about 3,000,000 volumes. In forty- 
three other rooms in the basement, first, second and 
third stories Snead bookstacks are provided with a 
combined capacity of 500,000 volumes, making the 
total stack capacity about 3,500,000 volumes. 
The main reading room is 76 feet by 295 feet, 
and accommodates about 800 readers. In the cen- 
ter is the delivery department having pneumatic 
tubes and four electric elevators connecting it with 
the different levels of the stack room below, while 
auxiliary elevators are placed at each end of the 
stack. A pneumatic tube service connects the main 
reading room with all rooms in which there are 
special collections.

are being moved into other buildings. The books are stored mainly on the seminar plan.

THE HARRY ELKINS WIDENER MEMORIAL 
LIBRARY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, 
CAMBRIDGE, MASS. 
Horace TrumpBauer, Architect 
HE Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library, 
| completed during the year 1915, houses the 
principal book collection of Harvard Univer- 
sity, as well as the precious group of rare and won- 
derfully interesting books brought together by Mr. 
Widener. It stands, in part, on precisely the same 
spot as old Gore Hall, a building which for seventy- 
five years sheltered the richest and most widely used 
collection of college books in America. The new 
building faces inward towards the college grounds, 
forming one side of a quadrangle, the other three 
sides of which are occupied by University buildings. 
From the rear of the entrance hall on the first 
floor, monumental stairs lead to the second floor 
which contains the main reading room overlooking 
the college grounds. This room, accommodating 
336 readers, is 192 feet by 40 feet and extends 43 
feet to the roof. The other three sides of the build- 
ing, however, contain a third floor of special collec- 
tion and seminar rooms which rest directly on and 
are carried by the bookstack below. The stack, ex- 
tending across the rear and along the greater part 
of both sides of the building, contains ten tiers with 
a total capacity of 2,206,000 volumes. Vertical deck 
slit construction with wide, fixed bottom shelves and 
protected openings is employed on all deck floors. 
The inconvenience and unsightly appearance of 
vents, ducts and pipes carried through the book- 
stack is eliminated by the provision of an open space 
of about three feet, between the first and second 
tiers, through which all these conductors are carried. 
The stack room is ventilated in a simple and 
economical manner by means of plenum fans fore- 
ing fresh, properly heated air into the basement and 
exhaust fans drawing the partially vitiated air out 
from the top. 
One of the distinguishing features of the stack 
is a row of stalls along each outside wall, each stall 
being well lighted and having comfortable room for Witiram Coouince Lang, Librarian 
a table and chair. The stack thus becomes practi- 
cally a working laboratory, with the best possible 
accommodations for individual and continuous work. 
A striking innovation is found in the provision of a 
large number of small study-rooms about 10 feet by 
12 feet, or 12 feet by 15 feet for the private use of 
professors and others. These are provided in five 
tiers. Although these study-rooms open into the 
stack, some of them are separated from it by a 
screen, thus allowing students and visitors access to 
the rooms, without passing through the stack proper. 
Other studies are provided in different parts of 
the building, the total number being seventy-four. 
The upper floor contains fourteen studies, nineteen 
rooms to be used for special libraries and seminars, 
a photographing room, the Library’s collection of 
maps and manuscripts and many of the special col- 
lections, such as the Classical Library and the Child 
Memorial Library, which were formerly in other 
buildings. The building contains thirty-six miscel- 
laneous rooms equipped with Snead Steel Shelving. 
As the center of the building was reserved for 
the Widener books, the delivery room was placed 
to one side. This was deemed permissible since, in 
a college library, the greater part of the students 
find the books necessary for daily work in the read- 
ing room, while advanced students and officers have 
direct access to the shelves and in most cases prefer 
to look up their own books and work in the stack 
rather than to call for books at the delivery desk. 
These conditions greatly reduce the proportion of 
books issued from the desk. The grouping of the 
reading room, reference books, card catalog and 
delivery desk, all in close juxtaposition, but separate 
one from another, is a great advantage. 
Ease of communication between the different 
floors and departments is facilitated by telephones, 
pneumatic tubes, book lifts, book conveyors and 
passenger elevators.

  GILMAN HALL, BALTIMORE, MD. 
THE JOHNS HOPKINS 
Parker, Tuomas & Rice, Architects 
ILMAN HALL, the new fireproof library 
of the Johns Hopkins University, was com- 
pleted during the year 1914, at a total cost 
of about $600,000. It is the first of the major build- 
ings to be erected at Homewood, where all depart- 
ments of the University, except the Medical School, 
are to move. 
Gilman Hall is the crown of the campus— 
marked so by its place at the head of the main 
quadrangle, by its architectural distinction, espe- 
cially due to the portico and clock tower which rises 
to a height of 120 feet, by its size and by its function. 
The arrangement of the building is noteworthy be- 
cause of the organization of the stack as a series of 
departmental libraries, planned in the first instance 
by the librarian who served as a secretary of the 
faculty committee of five entrusted with the prepar- 
ation of a program. After adoption by the com- 
mittee and acceptance with minor adjustments, on 
the part of the faculty, it was elaborated by the 
architects. 
The plan grew out of the unique library tradi- 
tion of the University. Heretofore the library had 
not had a stack, but consisted of a group of depart- 
mental collections, each shelved in a separate room 
or suite of rooms. The problem was to preserve to 
faculty and students that immediate contact with all 
the material of a subject, so important to work of 
research, and yet secure the convenience of the in- 
evitable stack. This was essentially accomplished 
by putting the offices and seminar rooms of a depart- 
ment on one side of a corridor, and on the other 
the stack with accommodations therein for graduate 
students. The building floors correspond to alter- 
nate deck floors of the stack and in two tiers, con- 
tained between one floor and the next, are stored 
books of the subject pursued by the department 
across the corridor at that level. In the stack aspace 
fifteen feet wide is left between ends of ranges and 
the prismatic glass windows. Terrazzo floors, sur- UNIVERSITY LIBRARY 
Dr. M. Liewettyn Raney, Librarian 
faced with cork or linoleum, are laid at building 
floor levels, and here are tables, chairs and individual 
lights for graduate students. To complete the de- 
partmental organization of the stack, deck-slits at 
building-floor levels are closed and forced ventilation 
is provided. 
Nor is this all. Kindred departments can be 
brought to the same floor for there are two such 
stack systems, set sixty feet apart. The room which 
ties them together on each floor is the seat of library 
service and control, with departmental librarian, 
branch catalog, current journals, new, reserved and 
reference books, etc. 
The stacks will ultimately contain nine tiers, 
each consisting of thirteen ranges, 21 feet long. At 
present, however, only tiers 3 to 8 inclusive are 
equipped. These have nearly ten miles of shelving, 
accommodating about 450,000 volumes. Approxi- 
mately 300 graduate students can find accommoda- 
tions in the stacks and their adjacent reference 
rooms. The rooms across the front and rear pro- 
vide quarters for undergraduate instruction but are 
intended for future expansion of graduate work and 
library administration. 
The reading room occupies a complete floor in 
the rear, being reached from both lateral corridors 
as well as through an ornate enclosed bridge span- 
ning the court. It has over 6,000 square feet of 
floor space, and an abundance of natural light coming 
from four sides and the top. Artificial illumination 
is operated under the indirect system. The floor is 
covered with inlaid cork. The radiators are re- 
cessed and send their heat through horizontal grilles 
in the window sills. Around the walls is an unbro- 
ken line of shelving which will hold about 15,000 vol- 
umes and 300 current journals. The room opens in- 
to both stacks at the fifth tier, i.e., midway vertically. 
As for control, one desk attendant in the read- 
ing room at night can throw open all shelves and 
still have command. In the day, three suffice.

THE HARPER MEMORIAL LIBRARY, 
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 
Suep.ey, Rutan & Coo.rpce, Architects 
the University of Chicago was housed in a Dr. Ernest D. Burton, Director 
the second floor. Other offices and rooms for spe- ROM 1892 to 1902 the General Library of | offices and working rooms of the libraries are on 
temporary one-story brick building. In 1902 
the library moved into the new Press Building, and 
in the same year the first active steps were taken 
toward the erection of a permanent central library 
building. The committee appointed for the purpose 
recommended that the library building be made the 
central member of a group of nine buildings which 
should include the Divinity School, Law School, 
Historical and Social Science group, Philosophy 
group, Classical group, Modern Language group 
and the Oriental group, each to contain a depart- 
mental library, so constructed as to have the read- 
ing rooms of each at approximately the same level 
with the reading room of the central building. 
Mr. John D. Rockefeller promised to give, up 
to $800,000, three-fourths of whatever amount 
should be raised for the erection of a central library 
building as a memorial to Dr. Wm. Rainey Harper, 
first President of the University. Over $200,000 
was raised in subscriptions. The above sums with 
interest which accrued before and during the pro- 
cess of building, somewhat exceeded one million 
dollars. Of this sum approximately $800,000 was 
spent upon the building and its furniture, and over 
$200,000 set aside as an endowment fund for the 
physical maintenance of the building. Ground was 
broken on January 10, 1910, the corner-stone laid 
June 14, 1910, and the building completed in June, 
1912. 
The main reading-room is on the third floor of 
the middle section of the Harper Library. Adjoin- 
ing it in the west tower is the public catalog and 
general delivery room. From this floor bridges lead 
immediately to the libraries in the Haskell Oriental 
Museum and the Law Building. Eventually there 
will also be immediate communication with the read- 
ing rooms of the other buildings of the group, which 
still remain to be built. The general administrative cial collections are provided in the fourth, fifth and 
sixth stories of the two towers. 
The bookstacks rest directly on the basement 
floor and are carried independently of the building. 
The first floor, with the exception of the east tower 
stack, is temporarily given up to classrooms and a 
suite of offices for the president of the university. 
Eventually the partitions of this space and those 
of the floor above will be removed and the stack ex- 
tended from below, increasing the present capacity 
of about 525,200 volumes to over 1,000,000 volumes. 
The basement stack is so designed that when the ad- 
ditional stack tiers are added in the first and second 
stories the weight will be carried through the base- 
ment stack to the basement floor and not on the 
main first floor. 
In the building there are 81 rooms providing 
accommodations for over six hundred readers and 
office space for about 50 members of the staff and 
faculties. A passenger elevator and two stairways 
extend the entire height of each tower. Electric 
book-lifts in both towers run from lower basement 
to the sixth floor. Pneumatic tubes for the convey- 
ance of book orders and charging cards connect 
various parts of the building. Speaking tubes and 
telephones facilitate communication. 
The center court, bounded on the south by the 
library building; on the east by the Law School, and 
on the west by the Haskell Oriental Museum, will be 
known as the Harper Court, and eventually, it is 
expected, there will stand in the center of it a bronze 
statue of President Harper. 
In the stone carvings, both exterior and interior, 
in addition to the traditional designs characteristic 
of Gothic architecture, much use has been made of 
the coats of arms of European, American and Asiatic 
universities, and of the individual marks of the most 
famous European printers.

This is financially an independent institution but is practically one of the departments of Harvard University. The present building forms the first section of what is 
eventually to be a large group. It includes class rooms, students’ rooms, administrative offices and a library. The five-tier Snead Standard Stack is Gothic in detail to 
harmonize with the design of the building and furnishings.

Several shelf compartments have 
been temporarily omitted to make 
room for study tables near win- 
dows. Along the center 3-foot 
aisle, partition shelf supports have 
been used instead of range fronts 
so that adjustable shelves can later 
be placed across the aisle to in- 
crease the stack capacity. In the 
basement tier, structural steel col- 
umns have been installed to sup- 
port the six-tier stack above. See 
Fig. 118, page 82. The columns 
are designed so that, at some fu- 
ture time, shelf supports and 
shelves can be easily attached. 
Space is left above the stack to 
allow the installation of a future 
eighth tier.

  above and the stack is fitted with a removable cornice which may be reset on the future second tier. 
The electric conduits are carried directly on the stack cover plates. See Fig. 127. When the stack is 
extended, the conduits will be disconnected at the walls and raised to a new level above the second 
tier, no alterations being necessary.

Snead Standard Stacks in seminar and special study rooms. Those in the seminar rooms are designed to receive future second 
tiers. The building, known as “a laboratory of the intellectual sciences,” has its library divided and placed in separate rooms 
or series of rooms so that each becomes a working laboratory for a special department, containing books, documents, maps, 
photographs, slides, busts and other material relative to the subjects treated.

Rice Hall, so called for William Rice, librarian 
from 1861 to 1897, is at the west of the rotunda 
and serves as the main book room of the library. 
The general storage stack is directly below and 
connects with Rice Hall by means of stairways 
and a book lift. The office of the librarian, sec- 
retaries’ and stenographers’ rooms, and a direct- 
ors’ room are on the mezzanine floor over the 
radial bookstack.

At present the building contains a four-tier Snead Standard Stack, with provision for the addition of four more tiers above those in place. All floors of the building 
line up with either present stack deck floors or deck floors of proposed stack. On the third floor are the staff rooms, a dining room with kitchen adjoining, a house- 
keeping suite for the resident janitor, a rest room for the pages, a large room for art exhibits and displays of various sorts, and several committee rooms for the use of 
the public. This story also contains a lecture room and picture galleries which will ultimately be used for library purposes.

The absence of corridors and the grouping of the several departments has developed a plan with practically no waste space. 
The delivery roo n direct communication with every other room on the first floor, is so located as to allow complete control   
  from this one central point; and the stack room setting free on three sides, affords an opportunity for extensive expansion.

Execrus D. Lrrcur1etp, Architect W. Dawson Jounston, Librarian 
Although under one roof, these libraries are, in effect, separate institutions and will be administered as such. While Mr. Hill’s 
Library will contain a private collection and will be supported by him, it is understood that it will be free to public use. This 
library will consist, in the main, of one great room with three tiers of galleries. The St. Paul Public Library will contain, besides 
those rooms usually required, a children’s auditorium, a binding and printing department, a room for the blind, a kitchen, Junch 
and sitting room for the staff, and a staff class room with studies adjoining. A feature of the plan is the direct communication 
between departments and the absence of wasteful hall space. This is the last building on which the late Charles C. Soule acted 
in an advisory capacity.

The two-tier Snead Standard Stack, carrying the delivery room floor above, occupies the center of 
the basement story, which space could be put to no other use owing to its lack of direct natural 
light. Note that the main floor consists of but one great room, with glass partitions in one corner, 
enclosing the librarian’s offices.

The stack room was originally equipped with a bracket stack which, when expansion became necessary, was found to be too weak to carry a second tier. A Snead 
Standard Stack was therefore installed for a first tier and the bracket stack reset above it as a second tier. This moving and resetting of the bracket stack will have WASRBEADEOT 
to be repeated when the third tier is required.

This is the largest of the Brooklyn branches of the Carnegie library system. The delivery desk forms a focal point from which 
the librarian has absolute supe ion, including even the radial aisles in the two-tier stack. The change of axis gives a distinct 
separation between the children’s and the reading rooms. The basement contains a lecture hall with stage, anterooms and toilet 
under the reading room; work and storage rooms under the children’s room; and toilets, boiler room, and fan under the stack. Frank P. Hi, Librarian

Guy Lowe Lt, Architect Otis G. Hammonp, Superintendent 
This building, fireproof throughout, has been given an unusually appropriate architectural design. Being a library in character, an athenaeum in fact, it also expresses the 
dignity of a home of art and a meeting place for lectures and research. For the central rotunda, gray Sienna marble has been used in the first story and Caen stone in the 
second story. The staircase is of Hauteville marble. The entire left wing is devoted to the library of the Society. Books in the reading room are shelved in bronze Snead 
Standard Stack designed to harmonize with the architecture of the room and arranged according to the alcove system. See page 38. Adjoining the reading room are 
rooms for the superintendent and trustees, while the stack room is directly above. A lecture hall is contained in the right wing and above it a top-lighted, tile-paved 
exhibition room. Apartments for special exhibitions and loan collections are also on the second floor. The sculpture over the entrance is the work of Daniel C. French.

In remodeling the building, the old alcove arrangement was retained but all wood stacks were 
replaced by metal Snead Standard Stacks. New fireproof floors and windows were constructed 
and all interior finish was made of noncombustible material. The architecture of the old building 
has been followed in this new work.

The six-tier stack room is thoroughly protected against fire either within the build- 
ing or from neighboring structures. All the stack windows are fitted with wire 
glass set in metal sash and are protected by rolling steel shutters. These shutters, 
as well as the metal fire doors leading into the stack room, are held open by fusible 
metal links which open when subjected to excessive heat and allow the shutters and 
doors to close automatically. On the first floor, to the right of the vestibule, are 
the offices of the Nurses’ Directory; to the left is the superintendent'’s office, beyond 
which, opening to the left, is the Hutchinson reception room. To the right and 
left of the main hallway are the Thomas and Cadwalader rooms, utilized by various 
scientific societies. The Gross library is also located on this floor. A large kitchen 
in the basement makes it possible to give the official dinners of the College in the 
building. The reading room and periodical room a: amed respectively the 
Ashhurst and Norris rooms, while the Hall of Portraits is known as Mitchell Hall.

The library occupies an octagonal room on the second floor in the left hand bay shown in 
the illustration. The stack ranges stand between the windows and radiate toward a common 
  center. Tables are placed between the ranges in front of the windows and also in the center 
of the room, the whole forming a compact and convenient combination stack and reference 
room, See illustration of interior, Fig. 53, page 43.

The lamps and gates shown in the above illustration are examples of Snead wrought iron work. Special attention is given by Snead & Co. to carry out the spirit of 
architects’ designs. The Snead Roller Ramming Moulding Machine equipment, developed for the manufacture of bookstack shelf supports, affords unequaled facilities 
for the production of fine iron castings for railings, screens, panels, facias and other architectural work. A special process of pattern making is employed in order to obtain true lines, fine mouldings, clean surfaces and a perfect match. a

This illustration shows the steel front of the storage space which occupies the end of an office. Double-faced steel shelving extends out from the far end wall so that 
each aisle opens directly into the room and is protected by a self-closing steel door with wire glass panel. To economize space, the partition has been made up of steel 
shelving opening into the room and protected by wire glass in metal frames. The work, finished in green baked enamel, is neat, compact, durable and incombustible.

Uprights and shelves made of light cold-rolled steel sheets. The edges of uprights 
are pressed into three-quarter inch round beads to secure the greatest strength 
and stiffness of the material. When backing plates are used, rear edges are flanged; 
when heavy loads are to be carried, the beads are reinforced with solid steel 
rods. Shelves, triple flanged along front and back edges, and single flanged on 
ends, are adjusted at any intervals by means of round headed bolts. Uprights 
and shelves act together so as to reinforce each other. This shelving, furnished 
  s as required, is of unit construction and therefore easily erected or taken 
down. Black or dark green baked enamel makes the most satisfactory finish.

Thegreatest possible saving in space has been accomplished by the use of solid 
cast iron uprights with shelving formed of sheet steel, rigidly flanged along the 
edges. The shelves are adjustable at intervals of about one inch and are readily 
interchanged. These ranges were designed to carry three tons of type in each 
two foot compartment. The ledge shelf near the bottom permits of deep shelving 
for box cases below and forms a convenient step for reaching the upper rows of 
shelv The construction is entirely incombustible, sanitary, and proof against 
wear and tear. Cases with cast iron uprights and steel shelves are made in sizes 
  and designs to meet the special requirements of each installation.

The uprights are pressed into three-quarter inch beads along front and back edges to secure the requisite 
stiffness and to form a smooth surface of contact for the books. The shelves are adjusted at any re- 
quired interval by means of bolts passing through the webs of the uprights.

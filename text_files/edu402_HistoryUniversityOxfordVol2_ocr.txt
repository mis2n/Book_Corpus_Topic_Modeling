  A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY 
OF OXFORD 
CHAPTER XI 
THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES: 
BRASENOSE, CORPUS, CHRIST CHURCH 
HE year 1485 marks an epoch in history at Oxford as 
elsewhere. Under the Tudors the medieval University 
passed imperceptibly away. The old customs lost to 
some extent their meaning. The old views of education altered. 
The old lawless democratic spirit yielded unwillingly to dis- 
cipline. The Renaissance set up new ideals of learning. The 
Reformation brought new energies to theological debate. The 
old Halls were fast disappearing. The Colleges, some of which 
had begun life as struggling little communities of theologians 
or Arts-students, grew into larger and wealthier societies, with 
a fuller share in the government of the place. Undergraduate 
Commoners, as we know them, came more definitely into view. 
Several Colleges had from the beginning elected undergraduates 
as Fellows, and in some cases young students had been admitted 
on a special footing. Merton had its Parvuli. Queen’s had 
its Poor Boys. Magdalen had some very young Demies. Poor 
Colleges had eked out their revenues by admitting boarders. 
Waynflete had sanctioned a system of Gentlemen Commoners, 
which Wykeham had been unwilling to permit. But it was not 
till the sixteenth century, when the Colleges became recognised 
centres of teaching, when the lectures in Schools Street were 
going out of fashion, when the training of priests was gradually 
ceasing to be the chief aim of Oxford education, and when, after 
the perils of the Reformation, the expansion of Oxford on new 
lines began, that the great class of undergraduate Commoners, 
with no direct share in College endowments, arose to take the 
College courts and gardens for their own. 
Wolsey’s foundation overshadowed its contemporaries, as 
its creator overshadowed other men. But two other Colleges 
were before it in securing a license from a Tudor King. One 
of them, Corpus, became from the first the home of the New 
Learning, the representative of the new spirit in Oxford life.

  2 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The other, Brasenose, was intended to be a stronghold of the 
older and more Conservative ideals. Its principal Founder, a 
Bishop like Fox, was little touched by Fox’s liberal opinions. 
Its second Founder or joint Founder, Sir Richard Sutton, was 
a layman more rigid in his clerical sympathies than the Bishop 
himself. William Smyth, originally a young gentleman from 
Lancashire, owed his success in life to the influence of the Lady 
Margaret and of the powerful followers gathered round her son. 
Within a month of Bosworth Field he was appointed to a lucrative 
office under the Crown. He became a member of the Royal 
Council, Dean of the Royal Chapel at Westminster, Bishop in 
turn of Lichfield 1 and of Lincoln, and the leading member of 
Prince Arthur’s Council in the marches of Wales. He was 
constantly in attendance on the Prince. He was one of Henry 
VII’s executors. He played a considerable part in politics while 
Henry lived. He grew rich on Church preferments and perhaps 
in other ways. He is said to have possessed ten palaces in the 
diocese of Lincoln. He used his patronage to provide for his 
relations, and was thus able to devote his private wealth to 
public ends. The Cathedral of Lincoln, says his biographer, 
was ‘‘ peopled with persons of the name of William Smyth,” 
and Wolsey, who succeeded to the See, may have felt that this 
excused him in appropriating as many of his predecessor’s be- 
longings as he could. Smyth left “the perfume of charity ” 
behind him and notable foundations both at Lichfield and at 
Oxford. But it is perhaps significant that he found it prudent 
within the first three weeks of Henry VIII’s accession, to secure 
a pardon for every offence which he might have committed to 
bring himself or his possessions within the grip of the law. At 
Oxford he founded also a Fellowship at Oriel and bequeathed 
two manors to Lincoln. It has been suggested that he once 
belonged to both these Colleges. But he may with equal or 
greater probability have been a Commoner at Brasenose Hall. 
We have better grounds for believing that in 1485 he was a 
Bachelor of Law, and that in 1500 he was elected Chancellor 
of Oxford, “‘ as well by heavenly inspiration as by human judg- 
ment.” Before the death of the old King he had formed the 
intention of founding Brasenose, and early in the new reign its 
charter was secured. 
Bishop Smyth for all his Conservatism was no lover of the 
monks. We find him once reforming Oseney with a heavy 
hand. But he had little sympathy with reformers either, whether 
in the Church or in the field of education. His friend and coad- 
jutor Richard Sutton, the Steward of the Nunnery of Sion, was 
perhaps more tender to the conventual system, and was at least 
1 Lichfield and Coventry were then one See,
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 3 
as strongly attached to the old ideas. Sutton was a lawyer of 
distinction, a lover of learning and a lover of letters. There 
are indications which suggest that he may have had some Yorkist 
sympathies. It is not impossible that he had been at Brasenose 
Hall, where a William Sutton was Principalin the reign of Edward 
IV. At any rate in 1508, by obtaining from University College 
a lease of Brasenose Hall in Schools Street and of Little Uni- 
versity Hall beside it, at the generous rental of three pounds a 
year, he procured, in “the very centre of this our Athens,” a 
site for the College which the Bishop and he had designed.1 
The heart of the new foundation was the ancient Brasenose 
Hall, bought long ago by the University with the legacy from 
William of Durham. By 1279 it had acquired its name, and 
even before that date it seems to have acquired the celebrated 
trophy, the lion’s or leopard’s head of bronze with a ring through 
its jaws to act as a knocker, whose history is one of the lesser 
romances of Oxford life. The knocker, which may once have 
belonged to a Sanctuary older than the University itself, was 
carried off to Stamford by the Brasenose students in the days 
of Edward III. Another Brazen Nose in Oxford took its place, 
which the College wits alleged to be the nose of Duns Scotus. 
But the original knocker remained at Stamford for five centuries 
and a half. Then, in 1890, the College brought it home again 
and hung it in their Hall, and obstinate believers can still discern 
the dent inflicted when it was wrenched from its fastenings in 
Oxford nearly six hundred years ago.2_ Beyond the Stamford 
incident, however, we know very little of the history of the Hall 
till the list of its Principals begins in 1435. But the last of them, 
Matthew Smyth, who may well have been a relative of the Bishop, 
carried its ancient traditions with him when he became the first 
Principal of the new College.® 
1 The best accounts of the two Founders are given in Churton’s Lives 
of Smyth and Sutton, by Mr. Leadam in Monograph IX of the Brase- 
nose Quatercentenary Monographs, and in D.N.B. 
2 At any rate the dent was visible in an engraving of 1727. Experts 
agree that the knocker was probably a sanctuary knocker of the early 
tzth century, and it may, Mr. Madan thinks, have come from an ancient 
sanctuary in St. Edward’s Parish. There seems to be no doubt that 
the knocker was the origin of the Hall’s name, and not the mongrel deriva- 
tion from the Low Latin bracinum (malt) and the Teutonic haus, which 
would make Brasenose the brew-house of King Alfred’s palace! The 
earliest form of the name is “ Brasennose.” (See Quatercentenary Mono- 
graph II, and Mr. H. Hurst’s Four Noses of Brasenose College.) 
* Two former Principals of Brasenose Hall (Matthew Smyth and John 
Fornby) became members of the new College ; and other members of the 
old Hall, who seem to have been lodged at Staple Hall opposite during 
the building of the College, may have formed another link between the 
two. (See the College periodical, The Brazen Nose, III, 106-7.)
-P-A-G-E-20
  4 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
To the North of Brasenose Hall, which covered the spot 
where the main gateway of the College stands, Sutton secured 
Little University Hall also, at the corner of Schools Street and 
St. Mildred’s Lane. This building too had been purchased by the 
University out of William of Durham’s bequest, and with three 
small Halls adjoining had been annexed by Brasenose before 
the building of the College began. Soon afterwards, in Feb- 
ruary 1510, Oriel granted to Sir Richard Sutton for a perpetual 
rent of thirteen shillings and fourpence, two Halls on the other 
side of Brasenose, Salesurry 1 and St. Mary’s Entry ; and before 
many years were over the College was renting from Oseney two 
other Halls further to the South.2. Meanwhile the walls of the 
new quadrangle were rising. In 1509 Bishop Smyth laid the 
foundation stone, with an inscription which may still be studied 
over the doorway of Staircase No. 1. The site of six of the old 
Halls was cleared. By 1516, it seems, the buildings of the 
College were on their way to completion. A battlemented tower, 
looking East towards St. Mary’s, and containing the Principal’s 
Lodgings, marked the entrance from the street. On the South 
side of the quadrangle 5 lay the Hall, with its buttresses, its 
timbered roof, its louvre and its oriel window. Beyond it, in 
the South-West corner, was the little Chapel, on the first floor 
upstairs. The kitchen behind, a relic possibly of older buildings, 
projected into the garden on the South. The Library was on 
the North side, also upstairs and balancing the Chapel. There 
may have been from the first some attics or ‘‘ cock-lofts ” in the 
roof over the first floor. But before the new College was com- 
pleted in the form which it was to retain fora hundred years, the 
Bishop chiefly responsible for founding and planning it was dead. 
The King’s Charter, given at Westminster on the 15th January 
1512, provided for a Principal and sixty Scholars,” ‘‘ Aulze Regie 
et Collegii de Brasen Nose in Oxonia,” to study sophistry, logic 
1 This name, sometimes given as “‘ Salisbury,” may have been orig- 
inally ‘‘ Sale de Syrrae,”’ a corruption, it is suggested, of ‘‘ Salle Désirée”’ 
(Quat. Mon. I, 6). But Mr. Hurst boldly suggests that ‘‘ sale de Syrrae” 
is a corruption of Salisbury (Oxf. Topography, 160).

  and philosophy as a training for holy theology. The earliest 
Statutes seem to have been drafted by Bishop Smyth without 
Sutton’s co-operation, and the power of amending them was 
conferred on Smyth’s executors to the exclusion of Sutton after 
the Bishop’s death.1 But Fate disposes even of a Bishop’s plans. 
The executors after a few years declined to be responsible any 
longer. An appeal to Sutton as co-Founder followed. And 
in February 1522 he issued with some important modifications 
the revised code for the government of the College. A Principal 
and twelve ‘“ Scholar-Fellows ’—the sixty of the Charter re- 
mained a pious aspiration—were to study philosophy and 
theology. They were to be chosen from Bishop Smyth’s old 
dioceses, if possible, with a preference for Lancashire and Cheshire 
men.? The Principal was to be a Doctor or Bachelor of Divinity, 
or at least a Master of Arts studying Theology. He was to be 
elected by the Fellows and presented to the Bishop of Lincoln. 
He was to receive beyond his commons a hundred shillings a 
year. He must not be away more than a month in term or two 
months in the Great Vacation.4 But he might accept benefices 
which did not interfere with his College duties. In matters of 
importance he was bound to consult with the six senior Fellows, 
and for unbecoming conduct he might be removed. But he 
was entitled to the obedience of his colleagues. He could enter 
their rooms and summon them as he pleased. And he could 
with the consent of two of his officers forbid them to enter any 
layman’s house. 
A Vice-Principal of the College was appointed, chosen by 
the Principal and the six senior Fellows. He was expected to 
reside continuously in College, and he received beyond the usual 
allowances twenty-six shillings and eightpence as pay.5 Two 
Bursars were to guard the College property, at a salary of thirteen 
and fourpence each. A Reader or Lecturer was to be chosen, 
to instruct the undergraduates in sophistry and logic, who besides 
1 Mr. Leadam thinks the Bishop may have distrusted Sutton’s par- 
tiality for the regular clergy. For the Statutes and the early revisions 
of them see Statutes of the Colleges of Oxford (vol. II) and Quat. Mon. IX. 
Smyth’s will is given by Churton in App. XVI, and Sutton’s in App. 
XXII. The Bishop’s Statutes have disappeared, but a MS. book in the 
possession of the College contains the Statutes as revised by Smyth’s 
executors, and has enabled Mr. Leadam to point out the changes which 
Sutton introduced. 
2 The old diocese of Coventry and Lichfield extended to Cheshire 
and Lancashire, Natives of Prestbury and Prescot were preferred to 
others.

nose, 2).

other small emoluments received twenty shillings a year. Those 
who came late to his lectures had to pay a farthing or a half- 
penny, those who missed them altogether a penny, and those 
who laughed or talked or interrupted might be fined or corrected 
with the rod. Undergraduate Fellows must attend disputations 
in the Parvise, and study sophistry and logic for three years. 
Then as Bachelors they must study philosophy for three years 
longer before becoming Masters, unless special leave to break 
the rule were given.!_ Postgraduate study was carefully provided 
for. Elaborate rules for disputations were laid down for Bachelors 
and Masters alike. The former might be asked to teach the 
Scholars and to lecture to them in Hall. All Fellows who were 
Regent Masters were expected still to dispute in the Schools. 
But Brasenose, though she rejected new ideas and clung to the 
old Scholastic learning, recognised like Magdalen that the old 
monopoly of the Schools was passing, and that in future most 
of a student’s education would probably be given him within 
his College walls. 
Every Fellow elected was if possible to be a Bachelor in Arts,? 
and was to undergo a year’s probation before admission as a 
true and perpetual Fellow. He must not have a net income of 
more than four pounds a year, and he must not continue to hold 
his Fellowship if he received preferment worth more than ten 
marks. He was disqualified also by taking a benefice outside 
the University, by entering religion or marrying a wife, by 
striking the Principal or by yielding to other temptations which 
students of philosophy were expected to resist. The allowance 
for commons was twelve pence a week. A Steward of the Hall, 
a graduate, supervised the purchases of food. There were the 
usual rules for Latin talk and bible-reading during dinner. 
There were regulations about clothes. The Bishop disliked 
peaked shoes. Sutton objected to tippets. Velvet and damask 
and satin and ‘“‘chamblet” and costly furs were banned. So 
were dogs and birds and weapons and games—though card- 
playing was permitted at Christmas in the Hall. Walking out 
alone was as usual discouraged, and down to the nineteenth 
century it remained a College custom for undergraduates to walk 
through the College portals arm in arm,‘ 
1 The expenses of suppers or dinners on taking degrees were limited 
to 5s. for Bachelors and 20s, for Masters (Statutes, Brasenose, 17). 
2 Qui in eadem facultate probabiliter determinaverit’’ (Ib., 9). 
Elections were made by the Principal and the 6 Senior Fellows, and might 
take place in any term after due notice, and not only, as in most Colleges, 
once a year. 
3 Sutton strengthened this provision and introduced the year’s proba- 
tion. 
4 See Buchan’s Brasenose College (43). 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  
THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES x 
Sutton’s rules were detailed and comprehensive. Fellows 
must not stay away for more than a month in term time—a 
sufficiently liberal provision—and they must not spend a night 
in Oxford out of College without leave. They were allowed 
eight weeks’ holiday in the year, but six Fellows at least must 
always be in residence, except in days of pestilence or plague. 
Strangers must not be a nuisance and must not pass a night in 
College. Every Fellow had a bed to himself, but three or four 
Fellows and Scholars shared a room together, if “ the longitude 
and latitude of the room” allowed.t_ An upper and a lower 
room between the Hall and Schools Street were reserved for 
nobles’ sons. The gates were closed at nine: after that the 
Bishop would have locked out absentees altogether: but Sutton 
was content to punish them with fines? Money payments 
preserved discipline and rendered costly every species of offence. 
Bad language and abuse cost eightpence, a blow with the fist 
three and fourpence, an attack with weapons six and eightpence, 
and the drawing of blood thirteen and fourpence at least. But 
an undergraduate’s blood was naturally priced lower than a 
Fellow’s. Fellows and Scholars alike might have to take a 
beating. In sixteenth-century Oxford the rod came into its 
own.* In cases of suspicion innocence had still to be proved by 
compurgation. This obsolete ritual was maintained and even 
strengthened by the lawyer who recast the plans of Bishop Smyth. 
Sutton made one change of great importance in the Statutes. 
He gave the six senior Fellows a special position of authority, 
and practically vested the government of the College, under 
the Principal, in their hands. One result of this was that in 
later days the seniors appropriated the surplus income to them- 
selves. An important clause, which might have been made 
clearer, empowered the Principal with the Vice-Principal’s 
assent, to admit Scholars who were not Fellows, so far as the 
capacity of the College rooms allowed. Each of these Scholars 
was to be under the care of a tutor—a noticeable term—who was 
to be a member of the College and to answer for the Scholar’s 
expenses and fines.‘ They were provided, at the cost of the 
1 Three in the upper storey, four on the lower floor. 
* Still, for the fourth offence, sleeping out of College without leave 
meant expulsion (Statutes, Brasenose, 29). 
3 “ The Statutes of Brasenose,”’ says Dean Rashdall (II, 622-3), ‘‘ are 
the first which exhibit the undergraduate completely stripped of all his 
medieval dignity, tamed and reduced to the school-boy level.” At 
Corpus and at Cardinal College they used the birch up to 20 years of age. 
“ The tutor corresponds to the ‘‘ creancer” or “‘ creditor’ of the 
Magdalen Statutes, a phrase which Bishop Smyth had used. His duties 
were financial and disciplinary rather than instructive. (See also Quat. 
Mon. IX, 32-3 and 42-3.)

8 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
  College, with rooms and lectures, and with the services of the 
washerwoman, the barber and the cook.1 Students from the 
Lichfield diocese, from Prescot and Prestbury in particular, 
were to have a preference, and some of these Scholars were 
clearly intended to be poor? But six of them were apparently 
intended to be young men of family and fortune, to correspond 
with or replace the six youths of noble birth, whom Bishop 
Smyth, following Waynflete’s example, had admitted as Gentle- 
men Commoners at their own expense. If Sutton thought it 
desirable to offer such advantages to rich men’s sons, his action 
would seem to indicate some change in University ideals.* 
These well-born lads were allowed to rank as Scholars. They 
too had tutors to look after their expenses. They too wore 
surplices in Chapel. But they enjoyed one privilege denied to 
their poorer colleagues, a claim to dispense with inconvenient 
Statutes if the authorities allowed. 
Other regulations followed the customary lines. There were 
clauses about College servants: all Fellows and Scholars received 
their ministrations free. The Bible-clerk or reader was door- 
keeper in the Chapel, and had charge of vestments, lights and 
bells. There were to be as many cooks as the Principal and 
Bursars thought necessary. The porter was to act as barber, 
but his spare time was at the Principal’s command. There were 
careful rules for borrowing books, and a fine of twelve pence for 
any careless reader in the Library who did not close the windows 
or the books he used. There were rules for managing the College 
properties, for inspection, audit and accounts. There were 
tules for the Bishop of Lincoln’s visitations, for inquiries into 
conduct, and for a reduction in the number of Fellows, if it were 
really needed, but not merely to increase the good living of those 
who remained. Even if other Colleges fell into such temptations, 
Brasenose Fellows were expected to avoid them, having before 
their eyes the fear of God. The final clause, which forbade the 
adoption of new Statutes in a different sense, ended with one of 
those personal touches which were apt to grow into meaningless 
1 But nothing is said here—in Cap. VIII of the Statutes—about com- 
mons. In Cap. XVII it seems to be assumed that Scholars as well as 
Fellows received them. But the point is not quite clear; and the poor 
Scholars mentioned in the Valor of 1547 appear to have gone without 
(Quat. Mon. IX, 161-2 and 206), if the facts there stated are accurate 
and complete. 
2 An income of 10 marks disqualified for election, and a benefice of 
12 marks yearly put an end to their connection with the College. 
8 Mr. Leadam (Jb., 33) thinks that the rich men’s sons were main- 
tained like the poorer scholars at the expense of the College, and the 
Statutes (12) certainly speak of their being admitted in the same way—

traditions in Oxford life. A certain Roland Messynger,} one 
of the earliest College Bursars, a high-handed and litigious 
pluralist whom Sutton had evidently learned to distrust, was 
prohibited from joining or staying in the College, and for centuries © 
after his memory was forgotten each newly-elected Fellow swore 
to keep him out. 
As time went on the Statutes required interpretation. The 
College Visitors, Bishops of Lincoln, were appealed to for advice. 
Elizabethan prelates found it necessary to insist on the payment 
of battels, and to remind the Fellows that College endowments 
were not intended for men to whom preferments fell. Bishop 
Barlow ? in the days of James I was called on to distinguish 
between noxious and innocuous games. He allowed a tennis- 
court,® as bodily exercise had its value. ‘‘ Bowes and braynes, 
if long and deepely bent, will quickly weaken and cracke.” The 
same Bishop again required the College to talk Latin, an obliga- 
tion they were tempted to forget. Questions arose in regard to 
discipline, questions also in regard to leave and fines and pay- 
ments, which decrees by the Principal and Fellows from time to 
time resolved.4 But as a whole the Statutes seem to have ful- 
filled their purpose, and to have roused less controversy than 
some other College codes. Old-fashioned as in part its objects 
might be, compared with the broader ideas of Wolsey or of Fox, 
the little College grew and quickly prospered, to the praise of 
God and the glorious Virgin and its two patron Saints, St. Hugh 
and St. Chad.® 
Basset’s Fee, the first property bought by Bishop Smyth 
for the endowment of his College, consisted, it seems, of a number 
of small quit-rents paid annually at the Hundred Court of North- 
gate outside the town.* But the great Priory of Cold Norton 
in Oxfordshire, with lands in one and twenty parishes, bought 
by the Bishop in 1513, was a more important acquisition.

Incidentally it supplied a country-house, where the Fellows could 
take refuge from the plague. Sutton, besides the Halls which 
he secured in Schools Street, gave lands in Leicestershire, Oxford- 
shire and Essex, and the White Hart Inn in the Strand, where 
Fellows travelling to London on College business stayed. Mrs. 
Morley, perhaps a connection of Sutton’s, and the widow of a 
trader who dwelt in a Westminster tavern, gave lands at Faring- 
don, which brought with them litigation and chicane. John 
Cockes, a wool-merchant, gave six score pounds and the Red 
Lion at Wycombe, an Inn which, unhappily, had ceased to pay. 
Sir John Port gave the Godstow garden in Schools Street, to 
the South of Little St. Edmund Hall, and funds provided by his 
family enabled the College later on to buy the house and site of 
St. Mary’s College From the estate of a Warden of New 
College came lands at Marston and elsewhere. Gifts of money 
were not infrequent: Brasenose appealed to Conservative 
opinion. Within twenty years of its foundation the College 
received thirty-one properties large or small. 
As the sixteenth century proceeded, other gifts not less 
valuable flowed in. John Claymond, President of Corpus, 
generously gave funds to increase the Scholarships of Brasenose. 
Other Scholarships came from other quarters. Lord Mordaunt, 
an Elizabethan noble with forbidding features, founded three. 
Queen Elizabeth founded six and Dean Nowell seven, chiefly 
in connection with Middleton in Lancashire. The Queen her- 
self, at the Dean’s instigation and expense, refounded the Middle- 
ton Free School, and made the College Governors of it. In 
1572 Richard Harpur established a Greek Lecture, to be supported 
by the College: old prejudices were slowly passing away. Mrs. 
Frankland, the daughter of Robert Trapps, the great London 
goldsmith, with whom Thomas Cromwell had large dealings, 
and some of whose money went to Lincoln College, gave besides 
other lands the Red Lion and certain tenements in Kensington. 
They were worth seven pounds yearly in 1586; they are worth 
over three thousand yearly to-day. One new Fellow, four 
new undergraduate Scholars, and some increase of commons 
and of stipends came from her bequest. The seventeenth cen- 
tury showed itself as liberal. A Hebrew Lecture was provided. 
Principal Radcliffe, even in days of Civil War, left large sums 
for College buildings. A Duchess of Somerset after the Restor- 
ation endowed a number of Somerset Scholars, to be chosen 
from Manchester, Marlborough and Hereford Schools, And 
among other valuable legacies and donations the Hulme bequest

  of lands in Lancashire, to help four of the poorest Brasenose 
Bachelors of Arts, swelled, to an extent which public policy at 
last refused to sanction, the revenues and resources of the College.t 
With these endowments Brasenose soon made way. The 
exact number of Fellows at the start is doubtful. But there 
were fourteen besides the Principal in 1547.2. The first Principal, 
Matthew Smyth, was apparently a shrewd and cautious ruler. 
There was some little trouble with Corpus, and attacks upon 
the workmen there. There was more serious cause for anxiety 
when the King repudiated the Pope’s supremacy. But Matthew 
Smyth and eight Fellows of Brasenose, in spite of their Con- 
servative traditions, accepted the decree. There was still more 
cause for anxiety when Parliament began to vest Colleges and 
Chantries in the Crown. In 1547 Brasenose felt bound, in yield- 
ing a statement of its revenues, to point out that its expenditure 
exceeded its receipts. But the revenues amounted to nearly 
two hundred pounds,’ considerably more than they had been 
twelve years before. And gradually, though the College had 
to contribute at times to the King’s necessities, and was com- 
pelled by an Act of Edward VI to surrender thirteen pounds a 
year to the Crown, the fear of confiscation passed away. One 
member of the College had a father involved in the Pilgrimage 
of Grace. Another thrust his opinions upon Cranmer at the 
stake. Another was imprisoned later for corresponding with 
Mary, Queen of Scots. Others later still reinforced the Jesuits 
1 Details of these and other gifts and College properties are carefully 
set out in Quat. Monographs IV, VI and IX. 
2 This was above the average of the previous twenty years (Quai. 
Mon. IX, 149). The Valor of 1547, printed in Monograph IX (App. II), 
together with the Bursars’ Roll of 1545-6 on which it is founded, is not 
in its statements of numbers easy to follow. On p. 188 we read of 14 
Fellows, 5 Scholars and 5 servants. On p. 204 we hear of 14 Fellows, 
7 Scholars and 8 servants. On p. 206 we are told of 60 ‘‘ pore Scholers 
and other,’ who by old custom have free rooms and service: nothing 
is said about commons, But there were apparently only 8 poor Scholars 
in 1566 (Colls. of Oxford, 272), and the first reference to them in the College 
Register is in 1564 (Mon. X, 30-1). Can the 60 poor Scholars of the 
Valor be only a reminiscence of the 60 Scholars of the Foundation Charter ? 
At the end of the Valor is the statement—‘‘ Numerus personarum Stu- 
dientium et Ministrantium xxix.’’ Mr. Leadam interprets ‘‘ Studientes " 
as ‘‘ the Governing Body and the Scholars on the Foundation” (Mon. 
IX, 162); but the phrase is not clear. The numbers of the College are 
put at about 70 in 1552 (Colls, of Oxford, 272).

167-71).

and suffered death for the old religion. There were expulsions 
from Brasenose, possibly on account of religion, in the days of 
Cardinal Pole. But on the whole John Hawarden, the second 
Principal, steered his College without calamity through the 
perilous years from 1548 to 1565, and he must have acquiesced, 
willingly or unwillingly, in a good many changes in the College 
Chapel. 
Under Blanchard, the third Principal, numbers increased, 
and benefactions of value again flowed in. We hear of thirty- 
one graduates, besides the Principal, in 1566, with fifty-seven 
undergraduates, eight poor Scholars and five matriculated ser- 
vants.1 Principal Harris had a longer reign than Blanchard, 
and he also had a hotter temper, which he vented on the Vice- 
Chancellor when he took offence. But he played a leading 
part in the welcome given to Queen Elizabeth in 1592, and ran 
up an enormous bill for the College. Even in Elizabethan days, 
it seems, an undergraduate at Brasenose might find himself 
practically without food or clothes,? though others had their 
own body-servants to attend them. Harris’ reign ended in a 
long struggle with Sir Edmund Hoby, who tried to withhold 
rent due to the College, but was forced to yield by “ clergy 
clamours,” and perhaps by the inherent weakness of his case. 
Alexander Nowell, Dean of St. Paul’s, who stood by the College 
through that little controversy, was for years a liberal benefactor 
both of Brasenose and of Middleton School. He was elected 
Principal in 1595. But he held the post only three months, 
and the election could have been little more than a compliment, 
for the Dean was at the lowest computation well over eighty 
at the time. 
Nowell, a conspicuous Reformer, had many titles to respect. 
In the days of Henry VIII he was a Fellow of Brasenose and 
Master of Westminster School. In 1553 he was elected to the 
House of Commons, but as a Westminster Prebendary was 
refused admission. Exiled under Mary—Bonner, seeing him 
catch fish in the Thames, had grimly threatened to catch him— 
Nowell was made Dean of St. Paul’s by Elizabeth, and he became 
the author of the new Church Catechism and one of the leading 
Protestant divines. Elizabeth, who once hectored him in the 
middle of a sermon, must have enjoyed rebuking him for his 
attachment to images, when he placed a richly illuminated 
1 Colleges of Oxford (272). Servants on the foundation, like the 
manciple and porter, are often found matriculating and drawing com- 
mons (Mon. XI, 21). In 1578, 70 undergraduates matriculated, varying 
in age from 12 to 24. In 1589 there were boys of 10 and even of 9 (Mon. 
X, 34-5). But most of course were older.

prayer-book with pictures of the Saints and martyrs in her seat. 
The Dean was an able scholar, preacher, controversialist, and 
a generous friend of education. Incidentally he was credited 
with inventing bottled beer. He was known also as a devoted 
angler—there are fishing-hooks beside him in his picture in the 
College Hall. Izaak Walton declared that he owed to his angling 
and his temperance the undimmed eyes and the unweakened 
faculties which marked him even at the age of ninety-five. “I 
wish the like to all that imitate him and love the memory of so 
good a man.” ? 
Principal Radcliffe, whose long reign covered a large part 
of the seventeenth century, spent his life in the College and 
proved a valuable friend. Elected in 1614, though King James 
had suggested another candidate, he held his post for four and 
thirty years. He found the numbers surprisingly high for the 
space at the College’s disposal, dangerously high considering 
the risks of overcrowding and the constant liability to plague. 
The Buttery book for 1612 accounts for a hundred and thirty- 
three Commoners and a total of two hundred persons. Dis- 
tinctions of grade had grown up already. The Fellow Com- 
moners * might dine with the Fellows, have separate rooms and 
feather beds, fine clothes, fine linen and powder for their hair. 
Their tutors had often, it seems, to pay for the damage which 
they did. The poorer Commoners and battelers had to do 
without these luxuries. The batteler felt the real pinch of 
poverty. He had sometimes to act as a servitor and to put up 
with ‘‘a gound 2nd. hand.” 5 Each tutor had his own little 
company of pupils, and when the Court came to Oxford and 
taught the scholars there ‘“‘ debauchery,” his hands must have 
been full. Brasenose was one of the prosperous Colleges, but 
with rising prices and mismanagement it fell into debt. Before 
the Civil War began it is said to have owed its tradesmen two 
thousand pounds, and the political revolution carried ruin in 
its train. Laud found other matters to complain of. He did

the Halls owned by the College on the other side of Schools Street. 
Twyne’s figures for 1612 are still higher, though incomplete. He speaks 
of 145 Commoners (MS. XXI, 514). But I think his figures are some-

not like Bishop Williams of Lincoln, the Visitor. He did not 
like the sermons preached by Brasenose men. He did not like 
the “strong and unruly Argument” drawn from the College 
cellar. He did not like the temper which produced the war. 
The war brought with it a recourse to bows and arrows— 
poor weapons to face Cromwell’s Ironsides with.1 It brought 
also Royal demands for money, with a vain promise of interest 
at eight per cent. The College found five hundred pounds for the 
King. Its plate was sent to the Mint in New Inn Hall.? Its 
tower was stored with food, in case of siege. Its members toiled 
at the defences in Christ Church Mead—roused by a drummer 
who went round the Colleges at dawn. Strangers, courtiers, 
soldiers, Life Guards, serving-men were quartered in the College. 
Scholars and Commoners naturally fell off3 Only one or two 
undergraduates were admitted in the two years 1644-45.4 In 
1646 the College finances showed a serious deficit. Yet Brase- 
nose men found courage for long to resist the Parliamentary 
Visitation, and in that struggle Dr. Radcliffe played a conspic- 
uous part. In January 1648 he was expelled from his post. 
But he died in his Lodgings over the Gateway with the keys 
of the Treasury still in his power. And though his long reign 
ended in disaster and his methods of business were open to 
reproach, his benefactions silenced his detractors and for genera- 
tions kept his memory green.® 
Daniel Greenwood was appointed Principal by the Parlia- 
mentary Visitors after a curious scene in the College Hall. But 
six of the Fellows—there were only seven at the time in Oxford 
—took counsel with Sheldon at All Souls and secretly elected 
Thomas Yate. In the end, out of sixteen Fellows on the books, 
some thirteen retired or were expelled, and several undergradu- 
ates suffered the same fate.* Greenwood, for all his ‘‘ gossop- 
1 But they were among the weapons which the Junior Bursar of 
Brasenose had to supervise (Quat. Mon. XI, 31). 
* But the fine old chalices of Bishop Smyth, dating from 1498, were 
kept and are still used. Notes on the plate signed by Radcliffe are in 
the College archives. 
8 The Scholars fell from 15 in 1641 to 3 in 1644, the Commoners from 
42 to 6 (Mon. XI, 39). 
« Mr. Buchan’s List of Matriculations (Appendix G.) gives two in 1644 
and none in 1645. Mr. Wakeling (Mon. XI, 39) gives only one admission 
of an undergraduate in 1644. 
5 Radcliffe was accused by Wood of “ playing the knave” with 
College property, and his dealings with leases are not easy to explain. 
But Mr. Wakeling deals fully with the charge (Quat. Mon. XI, 61-4). 
One little habit attributed to Radcliffe has not been unknown in Oxford 
later. He was apt to misplace words—‘‘ a poor man will buy a dagger,” 
ive, die a beggar. Better examples could perhaps be given.

ping conventicles,” proved an able and respected Head. Crom- 
well made him Vice-Chancellor and bore witness to his integrity. 
The College finances improved. The numbers went up. The 
new buildings were laid out. Houghton, the Bursar, though 
representing the old order, found it quite possible to work with 
the new Principal. Even while the Commonwealth lasted, the 
Royal Arms were put up over a back gate. When the Restora- 
tion came and the Royalists returned, Yate stepped quietly 
into Greenwood’s place. But it is pleasant to note that he tried 
to secure an asylum for his predecessor in the College. The 
Restoration brought with it a readiness for compromise, con- 
viviality, good living. Wood mentions one occasion when the 
Proctors ‘‘ drank out in wine at dinner at Brasenose the sum 
of £80.” Brasenose men were found dancing at the Mitre with 
a citizen’s daughter ‘in boy’s apparel.” A baby was left in 
the College quadrangle and a Bachelor of Arts carried it off 
under his gown.1 Undergraduates had to swear to be careful 
of furniture, crockery and windows. Revenues rose.? Caution- 
money was re-established—eight pounds for a Gentleman Com- 
moner, six pounds and four pounds for lesser men. The gifts 
of Gentlemen Commoners helped to replenish the College store 
of plate. Degree fees were substituted for the old entertain- 
ments. Pepys visited the College and noted in the cellar the 
gigantic hand-measurements of the Child of Hale.? Yate, who 
loved to work at College records, ‘ desideratissimus senex 
Collegii pater et patronus,” died in the stirring year 1681, be- 
queathing his famous ledger to the College. We know little 
of Principal Meare who took his place. Brasenose Tories clung 
to King James as long as possible, but only one Fellow refused 
the oath to King William. The College was happy in having 
no history in those difficult and uncertain days. 
Brasenose makes no claim to a long line of prelates or of 
judges, though Richard Barnes was a notable Elizabethan 
Bishop, and Thomas Egerton, a great Elizabethan lawyer, 
became Lord Chancellor under James I. Barnes found his 
church at Durham an Augean Stable, “‘ whose stink is grievous 
1 Prof. Lodge refuses to attribute his action either to an uneasy con- 
science or to anatomical designs (Mon. XII, 14). 
* One estimate puts them at {600 in 1680, But this is only what 
Gutch, perhaps erroneously, made them in 1612. In 1665 the College 
paid Hearth-money on 65 hearths, while New College had only 53. For 
general rating purposes it stood eighth on the list of Colleges, between 
Merton and St. John’s, about 1681 (Quat, Mon. XII, 9). 
3 He calls him the “‘ Child of Hales.’’ This famous Lancashire giant 
of James I’s time visited Brasenose, and the shape of his hand was cut 
upon a stone in the College cellar. (See Pepys’ Diary, ed, by M. Bright, 
V, 299-300.)

in the nose of God and man.” Ellesmere, a recipient of Ben 
Jonson’s praises, and an early friend to Francis Bacon, was 
Chancellor of the University also for six or seven years. But 
other celebrities were certainly not wanting, and no College 
has done more than Brasenose to keep a record of its sons.t 
John Foxe, the Martyrologist, has been claimed, perhaps on 
insufficient authority, as a member of the College.2_ Nowell 
was eminent among Reformers. Philemon Holland, distinguished 
as a translator, started probably at Brasenose, if he fell away 
to Cambridge afterwards. Sir Henry Savile with his learning 
and his fine complexion, and his brother, Sir John, who found 
fame as antiquarian and lawyer, were both Brasenose men in 
early Elizabethan days. Richard Barnfield, a poet of rare 
sweetness, rusticated, it seems, for a time in boyhood, wrote 
lyrics which the world mistook for Shakespeare’s. Robert 
Burton, his contemporary, the “‘ fantastic old great man ’’ whom 
Charles Lamb loved, by whom Melancholy was ‘‘ Philosophically, 
Medicinally, Historically, opened and cut up,” # was said in his 
youth to be a very merry person. He belonged to Christ Church 
in his later years. A Bishop has vouched for the tradition 
that Burton, when he wished to laugh “ profusely,” would go 
to Folly Bridge and listen to the bargees swearing in the stream. 
1 The materials for the College history are ample. Besides the Statutes 
published in 1853, the Statutes and excerpts printed in 1772-73, the 
information given by Wood (Colleges), Ingram (Memorials), Foster (Oxford 
Men and their Colleges), Churton (Lives of Smyth, Sutton and Nowell) 
and others, recent works like the Brasenose College Register, 1509-1909, 
which has quite eclipsed the earlier Registers, Mr. Madan’s article in The 
Colleges of Oxford, Mr. Buchan’s history of Brasenose College, and above 
all the valuable volumes of Brasenose Quatercentenary Monographs— 
containing in Monograph VIII a list of books since 1710 relating to the 
subject—have done justice to the College and its story. I have to thank 
the College authorities and in particular the Bursar for allowing me to 
see the College muniments and accounts—the Foundation Charter and 
the early MS. Statutes revised by Smyth’s executors, the Day Books, 
which are full of interesting details, the Bursars’ Rolls, which, however, 
give no account of the fines which formed so important a part of the 
emoluments of the senior Fellows, the Buttery Books and admissions— 
signatures of Fellows on admission are preserved from 1556—the 17th 
century Building Accounts, the Vice-Principal’s Register—an important 
record of College history—Principal Yate’s great book of transcripts of 
deeds, Principal Heberden’s collection of notes, and Mr. Hurst’s valuable 
and voluminous Calendar of College muniments. I have also to thank 
Mr. Jeffery and Mr. Coxhill—not to speak of Mr. Madan—for much help 
kindly given.

pupil of Hawarden of B.N.C. But his connection with Magdalen is much 
better established.

And a greater than any Bishop, Dr. Johnson, has left it on record 
that Burton was the only author who ever took him out of bed 
two hours before he meant to rise. ‘ 
Country Squires sent their sons to Brasenose. The Crom- 
wells were among them, but not the greatest bearer of the 
name.!_ Laurence Washington, kinsman of an even greater rebel, 
has left his seal with its stars and stripes among the College 
records. He was admitted in 1619, but he owed money to the 
College when he left. Robert Holborne was counsel for Hampden 
in the Ship-Money case. Richard Norton, a “ notorious rebel,” 
was a companion in arms of Cromwell and Ludlow. The Great 
Protector consulted him about his own “‘ two little wenches,’’? 
and in 1653 he served on the Council of State. Philip Nye, a 
divine “of uncommon depth,” though he did “ wear a tail 
upon his throat,” helped to negotiate the Solemn League and 
Covenant, and fought for more toleration than the Presbyterians 
would allow. William Erbery, a fiercer sectary, carried to 
strange lengths the voluntary system, and forced his theological 
rivals to hold a disputation in St. Mary’s Church. Sir William 
Petty, an illustrious outsider, was Vice-Principal of the College 
in 1651, put in when “‘ Loyal persons ”’ were put out. He taught 
mathematics and anatomy in Oxford. He ‘cut up doggs” 
and “ pickled” bodies, and won a great reputation among the 
students by restoring to life a young woman who had been 
hanged. Elias Ashmole, virtuoso, astrologer, collector, whose 
twelve waggon-loads of treasures founded the Ashmolean in 
later days, joined the College in 1644. He was then already 
a Commissioner of Excise, and he was bracketed with the Duchess 
of Buckingham—so mixed was then the society living in the 
College—for failure to pay his battels to the Bursar. Thomas 
Frankland, “impostor and annalist,” Proctor in 1662, Vice- 
Principal in 1664, passed in turn as theologian, doctor and 
historian, forged his diploma as an Oxford M.D., and ended his 
singular career in gaol. Other students of medicine belonged 
to the Royal Society or the College of Physicians. Jeremy 
Taylor took his Doctor’s degree from Brasenose, but he had 
closer ties with Cambridge and All Souls. Carte, the historian, 
who joined University College at the age of twelve, came on to 
Brasenose a year later. George Clarke took his degree there

did credit to their College and served their country or their 
turn in public life. 
The College must soon have become too large for the accom- 
modation provided. But it was not for a hundred years, till 
the days of Principal Radcliffe, that any substantial change in 
the buildings was made. Radcliffe, however, had great designs 
of improvement. He introduced the line of dormer windows 
which gave fresh space and charm to the old quadrangle. He 
added an oriel window to the old Lodgings, where a beautiful 
room remains, as well as a “‘ flowring wainscot,” hangings, closets, 
stairs. And his will provided funds which enabled the Fellows 
to begin a definite extension of the College to the South. In 
1656 Little St. Edmund Hall was finally acquired, and on its 
site a new Chapel arose, connected with the old quadrangle 
by a cloister walk. Over this cloister, on the East side of the 
new Quadrangle, a new Library was built. The College woods 
furnished timber. St. Mary’s College in New Inn Hall Street 
contributed materials for the builder’s use. The Bursar laid 
out the money and superintended the accounts. But Jackson, 
the builder, must have been a remarkable man ; and if, as seems 
probable, the Jackson of the Brasenose buildings was the Jack- 
son largely or principally responsible for St. Mary’s porch and 
for Laud’s buildings at St. John’s, Oxford owes him a memorable 
debt. In 1663 the new Library was opened: the Great Cloister 
underneath it has since been filled in with College rooms. In 
1666 the new Chapel was consecrated, with the Little Cloister 
on its Northern side. In these Cloisters the members of the 
College were buried, and under the present Ante-Chapel was 
the drainage-pit :—arrangements which, coupled with insanitary 
streets and constant overcrowding, may help to account for 
the frequency of small-pox and the early death of many of the 
Fellows. The old Chapel and Library were turned to other 
uses. Rents were increasing, but comfort was increasing

old quadrangle (Quat. Mon, III, 37).

  also, ‘since the days when Dean Nowell had boarded over the 
“‘dampeshe and unholsome”’ rooms on the ground floor. 
The new Chapel proved to be a curious combination of Gothic 
and Classical features, of Gothic forms and Classical propor- 
tions, of Gothic tracery and fan vaulting with Renaissance 
ornaments of fruit and flowers. Gothic traditions lingered on 
in Oxford much longer than elsewhere. The school of Inigo 
Jones was now in the ascendant, but the old tradition still 
influenced Oxford builders. The master craftsman of medieval 
days was disappearing; the architect had not yet definitely 
taken his place; and at Brasenose the overseer of the works 
had to use, and he used with great ability, such materials as 
came to hand. A fine old hammer-beam roof was brought 
over from St. Mary’s College, and a new plaster ceiling seems 
to have been fitted with great ingenuity into that.1 The whole 
effect in spite of some extravagances was dignified and striking, 
and later changes have not lessened that result. Of the Library 
in the seventeenth century we know little. Its present ceiling 
is of later date. But Brasenose Library is said to have been 
the last in England to dispense with chains and to have its books 
set free. Those books, which began with a legacy given before 
the College was built, included also Bishop Smyth’s collection, 
books by John Longland, a later occupant of his See, a notable 
gift from Dr. Henry Mason in the reign of James I, and other 
valuable additions in later days. A tenth-century Terence, 
once Cardinal Bembo’s, is among the Library treasures. So 
is an Aristotle—De Anima—from the first Oxford Press, and an 
illuminated missal with a miniature of Sutton which bears little 
resemblance to his portrait in the Hall. 
Before the close of the sixteenth century the Hall was altered. 
A bay window on the South was added. The roof was restored 
or renewed ;? and both there and in other rooms new panelling 
was introduced. The glass in the North bay showed portraits 
of both Smyth and Sutton, for comparison or contrast with 
their pictures on the wall. Nowell, Egerton and Mrs. Frankland 
hang not far away, Lord Mordaunt and Burton, with peculiar 
expressions, and the two Principals Radcliffe and Yate.* It 
was not till 1769 that King Alfred was discovered to be among 
the Founders of the College, and that his portrait required a place 
among the rest. Before the end of the seventeenth century 
1 On the Chapel roof see Mr. Allfrey’s Monograph (27-9), and on the 
Chapel generally consult Mr, Vallance’s book, Old Colleges of Oxford. 
2 But the plaster ceiling is later. 
% The portrait of Lady Margaret, Henry VII’s mother, in the Common 
Room, is earlier than any portrait in the Hall, and was probably painted 
about 1509 (Mon, VII, by Dr. A. J. Butler, 23-5).
-P-A-G-E-40
  20 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the Principal’s Lodgings had been much improved, and the upper 
storey in the old quadrangle completed. A screen of stonework 
closed the new quadrangle on the West. A pleasant garden 
with a maze and clipped hedges occupied the centre of the 
older court. The eighteenth century was destined to bring 
further changes and many unachieved designs. But the Brase- 
nose of King William’s day, which showed no excessive reverence 
for King William, was still a little College based on Schools 
Street, extending the outline of its new court to the South, 
but with no dignified or graceful front upon the High Street 
to rival the grace and dignity of the old court within. 
Before the buildings of Brasenose were finished, the walls 
of Corpus had begun to rise. Its Founder had first planned 
to build a house in Oxford where the monks of St. Swithin’s, 
Winchester, should be trained. But tradition says that his 
friend Bishop Oldham of Exeter persuaded him to establish a 
College for the increase of learning instead. A devoted church- 
man of the old school, who could yet appreciate the liberal 
learning of the new, Richard Fox had already played a great 
part in Oxford and in English public life. His device, the pelican 
feeding her young,! was not chosen without reason. He had 
planned, it seems, for a long while to found an institution for 
the training of young men. As a boy he was probably a student 
at Magdalen.2. Wood thought that he went on to Cambridge, 
when driven by the plague from Oxford, and he was certainly 
well known at Cambridge later. But Fox was ambitious. He 
held it sacrilege for a man to linger at any University too long. 
He passed to Paris and may have taken his degree there. He 
met and won the confidence of Henry of Richmond. And 
after Bosworth, where he led the prayers of thanksgiving, he 
took a leading place in Henry’s Council as Bishop, Secretary. 
of State and Privy Seal. He became executor to Henry VII 
and to the Lady Margaret. He baptized Henry VIII. As 
Bishop of Durham he negotiated the fateful Scottish marriage, 
which was to seat a Stuart on the English throne. As Bishop 
of Winchester, then a richer See than Durham, his influence 
in educational matters rapidly increased. He became Chancellor 
of Cambridge and Master of Pembroke College. He helped 
Fisher to settle the foundation of Lady Margaret’s College of 
St. John’s. At Oxford he became Visitor of New College and 
1 It is found in the wood-work at Durham Castle, dated 1499. Bishop 
Fisher speaks of Fox’s devotion to the Sacrament of the Eucharist as 
illustrated by the name which he gave to his College, (Fowler’s History 
of Corpus Christi College, 25.) 
® But there is no official proof of this,

Magdalen. He drew up new Statutes for Balliol. He con- 
tributed largely to the restoration of St. Mary’s Church. He 
proved a generous benefactor at Winchester, Glastonbury, 
Grantham and elsewhere. He drew Wolsey into the public 
service, and as his years advanced and his eyesight failed him, 
he was probably ready enough to pass on the burdens of office 
to his successor. 
“ A man made old to teach the worth of age, 
Patriarke-like, and grave in all designes, 
One that had finish’t a long pilgrimage.” ? 
Fox may well have felt little jealousy of Wolsey, and have 
been content to spend in acts of devotion and munificence the 
closing years of his successful life.? 
Fox and his friends provided so well for the endowment 
of his College as to make it largely independent of benefactions 
in a later age. Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter and Founder 
of the famous Grammar School at Manchester, who had once 
been chaplain to the Lady Margaret, contributed no less than 
four thousand pounds. William Frost, the Founder’s steward,. 
bestowed a valuable manor. The first two Presidents, John 
Claymond and Robert Morwent, both gave lands in the neigh- 
bourhood of Oxford; and other benefactions followed as the 
years went on. The site consisted of parcels of land bought, 
from Merton, Godstow and St. Frideswide’s,? with several 
tenements in bad repair. Corner Hall, close to Canterbury 
College, the North-West corner of the Merton property, with 
Nevill’s Inn to the South and Bachelors’ Garden stretching 
away to the Town Wall, were cut out of the Merton lands, by 
an arrangement which produced severe criticism from Arch- 
bishop Warham. The negotiations for this transfer probably 
began before 1513.4 Three smaller plots, Urban Hall in the 
1 See Thomas Storer’s stanzas on The Life and Death of Thomas 
Wolsey Cardinall (Pt. I, 33-6). They are quoted in Dr. Fowler’s smaller 
history (10). 
4 Dr. Fowler has dealt fully with Fox’s life in his two histories of 
Corpus and in D.N.B. A manuscript life by Fulman (MSS. vol. IX) 
is in the College Library, and the Corpus MS. CCLXXX (ff. 169 and 188— 
93) contains several short sketches, attributed to President Greenway. 
See also the valuable Life prefixed by Mr. E, C. Batten to his Register 
of Richard Fox. 
8 Wood describes the situation accurately (Colleges, 389-90). 
Between January and May, 1513, £120 was paid to “‘ Mr. Walter 
Morwent of Marton College,” who had been Principal of Corner Hall, 
no doubt by Fox and for the benefit of Merton. The money passed through 
Claymond’s hands. The building was begun, it seems, in 1512. But 
on June 30, 1513, as a long and interesting indenture of that date in the 
College archives proves, Fox was still intending to transfer it to St. Swithin’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  22 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
North-East corner, Beke’s Inn and Nun Hall on the Western 
side, were ceded formally by St. Frideswide’s and by Godstow 
in the early months of 1517.1. But long before the purchase of 
the land was completed Fox had secured leave to begin building 
his College, and it seems that there were quarrels between 
Brasenose men and the workmen at Corpus as early as 1512. 
The front quadrangle may have been ready in part at any rate 
for occupation before the end of 1517. The Bishop’s Charter 
of Foundation was signed on the 1st March in that year. The 
King’s Patent was dated the 26th November of the year before.? 
Claymond as President and Morwent as Vice-President came 
over from Magdalen with several of their colleagues, and took 
possession of the new College. The Statutes issued about the 
same time by the Founder were revised by him a few months 
before his death. 
The Statutes of Corpus marked a new departure which all 
lovers of the New Learning approved. Fox’s “ bee-hive,’’ as 
he called it, was to be no monkish College after all, but a place 
of liberal education, wider than any known in Oxford yet. 
Theology still held the first rank in the Founder’s estimation. 
But it was to be theology based on a study of the ancient 
Fathers, Jerome, Augustine, Origen and Ambrose, not on medi- 
zeval teachers of inferior learning and of later date. And besides 
a Public Lecturer in theology, there were to be Lecturers or 
Professors in Greek and Latin, to whose teaching the busy 
bees of the whole University might swarm.* Greek had at 
last entered into its own. Erasmus declared that the new 
foundation would prove “‘ one of the chief glories of Britain,” 
would draw to Oxford more scholars than had ever been drawn 
to Rome. The Greek Lecturer was to lecture daily on grammar 
and rhetoric and the great Greek authors. Euripides and 
Sophocles, Aristophanes and Hesiod, Demosthenes, Thucydides, 
Aristotle and Plutarch were among those mentioned: Homer 
and Herodotus, Plato and Aischylus were not. All Fellows 
Priory at Winchester for a small monkish College. Merton also asked 
arent of £4 6s. 8d. for the land given up. (See Chap. III of Dr. Fowler’s 
larger History.) 
1 See the plan from the Fulman MSS. (vol. X, 106-7) which Dr. Fowler 
reproduces (History, 69), and Hurst’s Oxford Topography (200-1). The 
boundaries of Nevill’s Inn are a little uncertain, but included what is 
now the President’s garden. The old Bachelors’ Garden, it seems, corre- 
sponds with the present College Garden. The ancient conveyances are 
preserved in the archives. 
2 There seems to have been an earlier License of March, 1512, which 
is referred to in the indenture of June 30, 1513.

  THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 23 
and Scholars, but not Bachelors of Divinity,1 were bound to 
attend the public lectures and to be examined in them too. 
In vacations all members of the College below the degree of 
Masters were to have private instruction in Greek. The Professor 
of Humanity, ‘“‘sower and planter of the Latin tongue,” was 
to lecture at eight in the morning all through the year. The 
list of Latin authors for instruction included Cicero and Sallust, 
Pliny and Livy, Virgil and Ovid, Lucan and Terence.? In the 
appointment of his Lecturers Fox may have co-operated with 
Wolsey. He was as ready as the Cardinal to welcome scholars 
from abroad. The teaching of logic and philosophy was also 
fully provided for. Bachelors of Arts had to attend two lectures 
a day at Magdalen, one of which might begin as early as six. 
All students of logic of a certain standing had to be present 
at disputations in the Parvise. ‘‘ That glorious contest’ was 
not to be contemned. Theologians and artists alike were to 
have their special exercises. The education of the choristers 
was not forgotten. Elaborate rules were laid down in regard 
to disputations and degrees. Fellows, Masters of Arts, were 
intended to take Orders,4 but the Public Lecturers need not. 
Even for feast-days and vacations subjects of study were assigned. 
Bachelors might lecture in vacations on mathematics and the 
movement of the planets. Fellows might spend forty days away 
from Oxford, Probationers and Scholars twenty only, in the 
year. But even Fox’s hard-worked scholars, busy day and night 
making honey in their hive, might have special leave of absence 
on the King’s service or the Bishop’s. And a travelling Scholarship 
for three years was provided, tenablein Italy or elsewhere abroad. 
In other respects the Statutes of Corpus, though lengthy 
and remorseless in their metaphors, ran more upon the usual 
lines. The King’s patent contemplated a College of a President 
and thirty Scholars, more or less, holding property worth three 
hundred and fifty pounds a year. But Fox more specifically 
assigned to his bee-hive twenty Scholars or Fellows, twenty 
Disciples, three Readers and six servants of the Chapel.5 The 
1“ Omnes nostri Collegii Socii, scholares et discipuli, etiam Magistri, 
non theologi”’ (Statutes, C.C.C., 50). 
2 And others like Juvenal, Plautus and Quintilian. Horace is not 
mentioned. But the lists of Greek and Latin books are in neither case 
complete or exclusive. Fox himself presented to the College Library 
copies of Horace, Homer, Herodotus and Plato (Fowler, History, 93, n.). 
3 See later (p. 30). 
4 Except one Fellow, ‘‘ studio medicinae deputatus ”’ (Statutes, C.C.C., 
62). 
5 Two priests, two acolytes and two choristers. Of the two priests 
or chaplains one was ‘‘ Praecentor”’ and the other “‘ Sacrista.’”’ Of the 
two clerks or acolytes one was organist and one sub-sacristan. The chor-

Fellows, to be chosen by preference from certain districts, 
especially from dioceses which Fox had ruled, might be under- 
graduates if graduates failed, and were to have two years’ 
probation as Scholars before they became perpetual Fellows. 
The Probationers and Disciples must not possess more than 
five marks a year; and an inheritance of a hundred shillings 
or preferment exceeding eight pounds a year in value disqualified 
a Fellow, though the President was excepted from this rule. 
The Disciples were students corresponding roughly to the modern 
Scholars, who in the ordinary course would succeed to Fellow- 
ships, and who might enter before they were fourteen. The 
Readers might or might not be Fellows themselves. Four or 
at the most six well-to-do Commoners might be admitted at 
their own expense.t And there were provisions for the usual 
College servants, who might also be students and even take 
degrees. When complete, the little community would number 
more than sixty persons, but they had more space to live in 
than some of their neighbours. Fellows and Probationers slept 
only two in a room, each with one Disciple. Every one over 
fourteen years old had a separate bed. The Fellows who acted 
as tutors to the younger Scholars, took charge of their money 
rather than their minds, and so long as they were undergraduates 
and under twenty might give them a whipping if circumstances 
required. 
The President was expected to be thirty years old and at 
least a Bachelor in Divinity.2. He was elected by the seven 
senior Fellows, in whose hands a great deal of authority lay. 
The Vice-President was one of the seven seniors and was also 
elected by them. So were the two Deans or Censors. So were 
the two Bursars. No member of the College was allowed to 
act as Proctor. None except the servants were to visit shops 
or laymen’s houses. None were to walk in the town alone. 
None were to carry arms except bows and arrows. None were 
to play forbidden games, to wear unclerical garments, to indulge 
in luxuries like mantles or liripipes or long hair. Commons 
were elaborately regulated; twelve pence a week for Fellows, 
Probationers, Public Lecturers and Chapel priests,‘ eight pence 
isters stayed till their voices broke; they got food and clothing, but no 
pocket-money. 
1 Sons of nobles or of Leos (juve regni peritorum), under the charge 
of tutors (Statutes, C.C.C., 
2 Or at any rate qualified to take that degree in four months’ time 
(Statutes, C.C.C., 2). 
® Of course with the President’s co-operation. 
“ The “clericus computi” or clerk of accompts, not necessarily a 
permanent officer, was also reckoned in the first class and drew the highest 
“rate of commons (Statutes, C.C.C., 73).
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 25 
for Disciples, acolytes and choristers, ten pence for servants. 
But these rates might be increased if the prices of corn went 
up, and the College officers might vary them in individual cases. 
A Seneschal, a graduate Fellow, supervised the food supplied 
in Hall. Besides commons there were salaries and liveries 1 
and allowances all round. The President’s salary was ten 
pounds a year, and he had horses and servants provided. Fel- 
lows who were priests drew besides food and clothing four marks 
a year. Fellows who were not priests drew forty shillings, 
Probationers and Disciples twenty-six and eightpence each. 
The Vice-President’s salary was also twenty-six and eightpence, 
double that of the Deans and Bursars.?. Readers in Sophistry 
and Logic received so many pence for each of their pupils. 
The Public Reader in Humanity had five pounds a year. The 
Greek Reader had that or a little more. The Reader in Theology 
might draw up to ten pounds, and so might an exceptionally 
brilliant Latinist or Grecian. The two priests were each allowed 
forty shillings, but if the Precentor were exceptionally good he 
got a little more. Other servants of the Chapel also had salaries 
assigned. Nobody in College was forgotten.4 The endowments, 
happily, were enough for all. Oxford Fellows of the sixteenth 
century had travelled already far beyond the meagre standards 
with which the poor scholars of Balliol had begun. And rules 
as careful and elaborate for managing the College property, 
for prayers and services in Chapel, for the use of books in the 
Library,® for the punishment of offences—loss of commons was 
a favourite fine—set forth the Bishop’s views of College govern- 
ment and his determination to make them understood.® 
In spite, however, of Fox’s care, his successors were some- 
times asked to interpret his Statutes. Bishop Ponet under 
Edward VI? had to remind the Fellows that they were all 
“saving the student in physic” under obligation to prepare 
themselves ad ministerium Dominicum, ‘‘ which ministry remain, 
though massing be gone.’’ Bishop Horne, having read the 
Statute again and again, came to the same conclusion and 
1 Also described as gowns and vests. 
2 These salaries were, like the President’s, in addition to allowances. 
® For the details see Statutes (C.C.C., 83). But the Chapel attendants 
and College servants did not pay for lectures. 
4 E.g. the Porter had 33s. 4d., the two cooks qos. and 26s. 8d., etc. 
(Ib., 83). 5 Only books of adequate value and utility were chained (Jb., 90). 
® There was an interesting provision for arbitration by the Chancellor, 
the Warden of New College and the President of Magdalen, in the case 
of disputes between the President and Fellows of Corpus, irrespective 
of the Visitor’s (the Bishop of Winchester’s) rights (Statutes, C.C.C., 65). 
7 The date is wrongly given in the Statutes (123) as 1558.  
-P-A-G-E-46
  26 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
enforced it. He was also led to think that Fox would have 
forbidden “ periwigs,”” had they been in fashion in his time. 
Later on, as College surpluses increased while prices rose and 
individuals grew poorer, Bishop Montague sanctioned an in- 
crease in the allowances for livery, on condition that a fair 
proportion of the surplus went to the treasury in the College 
tower. As revenues improved still further, the “ double vest ” 
was doubled and quadrupled again, until in the early years of 
the nineteenth century the original allowance was multiplied by 
sixteen. Bishop Andrewes interpreted the Statute permitting 
an occasional Fellow to study abroad so as to cover the case 
of Dr. Jermyn, Chaplain to Elizabeth, Electress Palatine and 
Winter Queen. After the Restoration Bishop Morley undertook 
two Visitations of the College. His questions suggested the 
possibility of abuses, though the grave charge of corrupt resig- 
nations was denied. He intervened, it seems, with more vigour 
than judgment in the affairs and quarrels of the Fellows. But 
he dispensed with the old provision which forbade Corpus men 
to take office as Proctors. Bishop Mews, his successor, a militant 
Royalist, was content to adopt the standards of his day. He 
found reasons why Fellows in search of promotion should be 
absent from College for more than six months. He realised 
that at Court it was ‘‘ highly improbable” that any man would 
get preferment in so short a time. 
Fox drew from Magdalen the two earliest Presidents of 
his new College, and in his old friend John Claymond he found 
a coadjutor after his own heart. Claymond was widely recog- 
nised as one of the first Latin scholars of his day. But he was 
also a man of character and fortune, pious, frugal, austere in 
his conduct, and singularly generous to other men. He resigned 
the Presidency of Magdalen to take up his new post. He held 
the latter twenty years. And he not only gave freely to Corpus 
and to Magdalen, to Balliol and to Brasenose, but he found 
means to set up a covered market for the sellers of corn near 
Carfax, to repair the West Gate and the roads of Oxford and the 
bridges through the Botley fields. He saw Pole admitted as 
a Fellow. He had to submit to a Visitation by Cranmer. But 
he passed away before the Revolution was completed, leaving 
to his successors a famous sapphire ring. His monument in 
the Chapel represents him as a skeleton enveloped in a shroud.t 
Morwent carried the College through the difficult days which 
followed. He found means of adapting himself to the require- 
ments of King Edward and Queen Mary. But in spite of out- 
ward conformity he remained attached to the old religion, and 
King Edward’s Council sent him for a few weeks to prison.

He died too soon to conform to the Elizabethan order, but not 
too soon to take part in selling off as lumber the wood-work 
of Duke Humphrey’s ruined Library. In place of a famous 
sapphire he had a famous dog, to which Jewel as an under- 
graduate wrote verses. On his death he left the College some 
valuable plate. 
Cheadsey, who succeeded Morwent, owed a good deal to 
the influence of Bonner. A famous disputant, he was pitted 
against Cranmer. But his perilous eloquence landed him in 
gaol; and his successor, who owed his appointment to a Com- 
mission of Queen Elizabeth’s, held office little longer than he. 
President Greenway, who wrote a life of the Founder, had to 
face a Visitation by the Bishop’s Chancellor, and to answer 
serious charges of misconduct. He was accused of misapplying 
College funds, of taking bribes and keeping shocking company, 
of drinking till he tottered on his legs, of behaving like a wanton 
boy in doorways and in gardens, so that those who saw him 
cried “fye upon all such spirituall men.” It is only fair to 
add that the graver charges were disputed, and that their chief 
author, a man of small credit, was expelled.1_ Other Fellows 
were dismissed at the same time, possibly on grounds of religion, 
but the whole story throws a curious light on the humorous 
irregularities of College life. Cole and Rainolds were more 
distinguished Presidents? The Queen recommended Cole. He 
had been in exile at Zurich, and was determined never to go back 
there to “eat mice”’ again. The Romanist Fellows had little 
liking for Cole’s wife and children, still less for his ‘“ Zurichian 
discipline.” But Bishop Horne, as autocratic as his Sovereign, 
expelled the objectors and forced the College to submit. The 
younger generation were probably more in sympathy with the 
new President’s views. He held his own for thirty years in 
spite of quarrels and contentions, and in spite of dealings with 
the College leases which stricter standards disapproved. Cole 
was Vice-Chancellor in 1577, and in 1592 he joined in welcoming 
Elizabeth to Oxford. Corpus was taxed for this purpose on 
a rental of five hundred pounds a year—the same as All Souls, 
half as much as New College, a quarter as much as Christ Church, 
five times as much as Balliol. Rainolds, a man of far higher 
character and a “treasury of erudition,’ had spent most of 
1 Dr. Fowler (History, 115 sq.) gives curious details of the charges 
brought against the President, from the Register of Bishop Horne. 
2 Cole held office from 1568 to 1598, Rainolds from 1598 to 1607. 
Reynolds of course is the modern spelling ; but I think Rainolds or Ray- 
nolds among many variations was the commoner form in the 16th century. 
8 Christ Church paid on £2,000, New College on £1,000, Corpus and 
All Souls on £500, Balliol on £100 (Gutch, Collectanea Curiosa, I, 190-1). 
These were probably not full rentals.

first Protestant theologians of the day. If Queen Elizabeth 
once ‘‘schooled”’ him for his “‘ obstinate preciseness,” King 
James condescended to jest with him on his need of a wife. 
Rainolds played a conspicuous part in the Hampton Court 
Conference, in suggesting and preparing the Authorised Version 
of the Bible. On the monument erected to his memory in the 
Chapel his virtue and piety were lovingly recalled. 
Of the seventeenth-century Presidents, Spenser, who succeeded 
Rainolds, was an intimate friend of Hooker. He edited the 
Ecclesiastical Polity and was one of the translators of the 
Bible. Anyan, who secured the increased allowance for liveries, 
was said to be “a bibber”’ and had a scandalous career. The 
House of Commons demanded his removal. Spenser was married, 
like his brother-in-law, Cole. Anyan’s wife was commemorated 
by celibate Fellows in unseemly verses, and buried her husband 
‘‘ignominiously ” after his death.* President Holt is little more 
than a name, though he was buried in Westminster Abbey. But 
Thomas Jackson, elected in 1631, was a man of character and 
weight. Originally intended for business, ‘‘ he chose rather to 
be a factor for heaven.” Once nearly drowned while bathing 
in the river, and revived by the care of the “ medicinze deputatus,” 
he was marked out as reserved for greater things. At first 
something of a Puritan, he became identified later with the 
school of Laud, “transported beyond himselfe,” says Prynne, 
“with metaphysicall contemplations.” But apart from his 
theological opinions, his sweet and generous nature won respect. 
His writings on theology filled many volumes. He was ‘‘ very 
prophetical’’ of the troubled times approaching. But ‘“‘ God 
took him from the evil to come.” 
Robert Newlyn, Jackson’s successor, remarkable chiefly for 
his love of his relations, took office in October 1640, and died 
as President in 1688. He lived in comparative obscurity, but 
he saw tempestuous days. In the Civil War Corpus by good 
management or good fortune saved at least a large part of its 
splendid plate.¢ But we hear little of its share in the struggle. 
1 He is said to have been at Merton before that. Weary of College 
dissensions, he retired in 1586 to Queen’s. When he came back to Corpus 
as President, he resigned the Deanery of Lincoln to Cole. Vol. IX of 
the Fulman MSS. quotes several letters of Cole’s and is full of references 
to Rainolds.

  The record of admissions dwindles, but the College Register 
has little of human interest to record. The Parliamentary 
Visitors were kept at bay till 1648. Then the storm burst and 
the College was ‘ generally ruined.’’ Newlyn was deposed and 
Staunton made President in his stead. “‘ There was not one 
Fellow left,” a contemporary tells us, ‘“‘ but Mr. Noel Sparks, 
the Greek Lecturer who was bed rid, and could not answere 
the Rump Visitors at their visitation.’’ One Probationer was 
also left, being consumptive and expected to die. It is alleged 
that eighteen Scholars also were ejected, and that some forty- 
two intruders were put in.1 Even the College bees, with very 
good feeling, seized the opportunity to disappear. 
Staunton, though accused of verbosity and idleness, was an 
earnest Puritan minister, who seems to have ruled strictly but 
not unwisely,® till the Restoration brought back Newlyn and 
his friends. Seven of the intruded Fellows were then dispossessed 
in their turn. But Newlyn’s later years were marked by laxity 
and nepotism, by sharp differences with the Visitor and among 
the Fellows. The College had a struggle to recover its fine 
Chapel vestments. Bishop Morley’s interference led to trouble. 
The wearing of periwigs cropped up again as an offence. Worse 
still, an immoral priest, to whom the College had refused a 
Fellowship, appealed to the King for protection, and the Visitor 
supported his appeal. Dissatisfaction increased and numbers 
fell away. Educational activity died down. If, as estimated, 
the College then consisted of some five and twenty Masters, 
some ten Bachelors and a dozen undergraduates, there could have 
been little work for the tutors to do. Servitors also appear in 
the lists of the seventeenth century,’ but the days of enthusiasm 
for studious poverty were gone. There was enthusiasm left, 
offered: but in other cases that did not prevent a further claim. (See 
Corpus, 123-4 and Appendix B.) Fox’s famous salt-cellar is reproduced 
by Skelton (Oxon. Pl. 73). 
1 These statements of numbers must be taken with reserve. The 
College Register beginning in 1648 has lists which do not exactly agree 
with others. Fulman, one of those expelled, gives a list of 36 new Fellows 
and Disciples elected in 1648, and of others added later (MSS. XI, 36-8). 
Prof. Burrows estimates that 39 members were expelled and that 11 
submitted (Register of Visitors, 571). Among 25 answers given by mem- 
bers of the College, on May 9, 1648, there is only one submission. Dr. 
Fowler concludes (Corpus, 134) that the proportion of those who finally 
disappeared was probably about 4 to 1, 
+ Punishments in Staunton’s day included a week’s loss of commons 
for offenders—‘‘ quod globulos niveos in aula projecimus,” and “ quod 
explosi bombardum in cubiculum condiscipuli per fenestram ” (Fowler, 
History, 362). 
®* Dr. Fowler thinks that some names in the Buttery Book for 1648-9 
represented servitors (History, 50, n.).°
-P-A-G-E-52
  30 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
however, for the Court and for the ideas it represented. Charles 
came more than once to Oxford. Monmouth’s name was entered 
in the College books, and erased when his cause went out of 
favour. President Newlyn lived to be over ninety and died 
in the year of the Revolution. His successor, Thomas Turner, 
a generous benefactor of the College, had a brother among the 
Seven Bishops. But not even persecution could destroy the 
Stuarts’ claim. Turner took the oaths to King William, but 
his Jacobite sympathies apparently remained. 
Apart from the Presidents who ruled it, Corpus had its full 
share of famous men. How far some of the early Public Lecturers 
like Vives and Lupset were members of the College, it is difficult 
to say. It seems on the whole more probable that they and one 
or two others were appointed under Wolsey’s scheme, and 
lodged and lectured at Corpus until quarters could be found for 
them elsewhere.t But Reginald Pole, the future Cardinal, was 
undoubtedly one of the early Fellows. It seems that he drew 
at the same time a pension from the Prior of St. Frideswide’s, 
paid to him by request of the King. Nicholas Udall was another 
Fellow—Latinist, dramatist, school-master and turn-coat, a 
Reformer who found equal favour with Edward VI and Bishop 
Gardiner, a Headmaster dismissed from Eton for disgraceful 
conduct but appointed to Westminster a few years later, and 
the author of the earliest English comedy known to fame.® 
James Brooks was also a Fellow: ‘“‘ Blasphemias evomuit 
plures,” adds Fulman.4’ He became afterwards Master of Balliol, 
a Marian Bishop and one of the judges of the Oxford Martyrs. 
So, on the other side, was John Jewel, afterwards Bishop of 
Salisbury and one of the most illustrious of Protestant divines. 
Jewel was elected in 1539 as a boy of sixteen to a scholarship 
at Corpus. He had already been three years at Merton. His 
life, written by Humfrey, the President of Magdalen, portrays 
him as a tireless student, rising at four and working late till 
1 The others were Nicholas Kratzer (‘‘ Cratcherus”’), the Bavarian 
mathematician and astronomer, who set up dials in Corpus garden and 
St. Mary’s Churchyard, Thomas Moscroffe or Musgrave, Wolsey’s Reader 
in Medicine, and perhaps John Clement, the tutor of Margaret More. 
Hegge, in his Catalogue 100 years later, included both Vives and Kratzer 
as members of the College; but his authority for this is doubtful. Ful- 
man, the College antiquarian, thought that the Corpus lectures were the 
same as the Wolsey lectures—‘‘ for Wolsey’s readers were there lodged, 
till he had built his Coll., and Lud. Vives was one of them,” Dr. Fowler 
discusses the point fully in his larger history (85-9, 369-71, 381, and notes).

Jewel (X, ff. 12 sq.). '

THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 31 
  ten, as a successful lecturer and tutor, as an earnest advocate 
of hard work and pure religion, whose expulsion in the days of 
Mary even political opponents felt able to regret. A still greater 
theologian, Richard Hooker, owed to Jewel his introduction to 
the College. He may have come up as a chorister. He was 
admitted as a Disciple in 1573. After some sixteen years spent 
in accumulating learning, in struggling with poverty, in struggling 
perhaps against ‘‘ unrighteous dealing,” 1 Hooker passed, says 
Izaak Walton, ‘‘from that garden of piety, of peace and a 
sweet conversation ”’ into the “thorny wilderness of a busy 
world.”” He took from Oxford an established reputation and 
the foundation of a noble style. 
Other names of some distinction carried on the traditions 
of the Elizabethan age. Charles Turnbull, rivalling Kratzer, 
constructed the curious dial which still graces the quadrangle, 
The great name of Cranmer appeared in the lists of the College, 
like the great name of Ralegh later on.2 Brian Twyne came 
up in 1594, to begin his indefatigable labours. His rooms, we 
are told, had book-shelves everywhere? Many a volume of 
his careful manuscript is in the College Library to-day. John 
Hales, the ever-memorable, followed him three years later as 
a boy of thirteen. Robert Hegge, admitted in 1614, “a prodigy 
of his time,” died when only thirty. But he left behind him 
a valuable Catalogue of the early Fellows and Scholars, and a 
treatise on Dials with illustrations admirably drawn. Another 
devoted antiquary, William Fulman, elected and expelled under 
the precarious conditions of 1647-8, bequeathed to the Library 
over twenty volumes of notes, which, though denied to Wood, 
have proved invaluable for the College history.4 Speaker 
Lenthall’s son, knighted both by Cromwell and by Charles II, 
and in the opinion of a political opponent, “‘ the grand brag- 
gadocio and lyer”’ of his age, found a place at Corpus before 
the Civil War began. Sir Joshua Reynolds’ father and uncle, 
and Fiddes, not the least of the biographers of Wolsey, were 
counted among its members before the seventeenth century 
closed. 
1 Hooker was expelled in 1579 or 1580, with John Rainolds and two 
or three others, for reasons which are not very clear: but he was promptly 
restored by the Visitor (Fowler’s History, 140-1). The College Register 
notes his admission but not his expulsion. 
2 George Cranmer, a great-nephew of the Archbishop, was admitted 
in 1578; he is said to have been elected a scholar at twelve, and to have 
become a pupil of Hooker’s four or five years earlier (Fowler’s History, 
153-4). Walter Ralegh, the great Sir Walter’s eldest son, was admitted 
as a Commoner in 1607.

    32 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Overshadowed almost from the beginning by the splendour 
of Christ Church and the ancient dignity of Merton, the build- 
ings of Corpus in their homelier pattern still showed a quiet 
beauty of their own. The oldest part of the College is the 
kitchen, which may once have been the refectory of Urban 
Hall. The original quadrangle, completed in the Founder’s 
lifetime, contained the tower, with the President’s Lodgings in 
it—one beautiful room at least remains—the Chapel and Hall, 
the Library and chambers for the Fellows. It is possible that, 
had not Fox at first intended to build only a small House for 
monks, the quadrangle might have been framed upon a larger 
scale. At the South-east Corner, running Eastwards towards 
Merton, was the Chapel, soon released from the claims of the 
Bishop and the parish priest. It seems to have been left with 
little alteration until the days of Charles II. But its services, 
no doubt, saw many changes, and its rich store of vestments 
and hangings, its embroidered pelicans, its gold and silver vessels, 
had to face many perils in revolutionary times. Of early plate, 
designed for Chapel uses, only Fox’s crozier and his golden 
chalice and paten remain. The brass lectern is a memorial 
of Claymond’s rule. In 1675-6 the Chapel underwent—it may 
have needed—restoration. Wood says that it was lengthened 
at its Western end at the Library’s expense.! It was paved 
with marble, wainscoted and painted. A new screen and new 
stalls were introduced. And about the same time, it may be, 
the vestry on its North side, shown in Loggan’s plan, was re- 
moved. North of the Chapel also and near the Merton boundaries 
there were out-buildings and a wood-yard. On the South side 
a Cloister was begun in 1517.2 The Founder, we are told, 
thought it necessary to increase the accommodation of the College, 
and in the Cloister Chambers then constructed, where the bees 
settled and made honey overhead, Ludovic Vives is reported 
to have lodged. The Hall, with its fine roof and louvre, lay on 
the East side of the quadrangle, and was little altered apparently 
till the seventeenth century closed. It dispensed with a chimney 
and was contented with a charcoal brasier until 1741. The 
arms which Wood traced in its windows have disappeared. 
But the portraits of Fox, blind as he was after the foundation 
4 Wood (Colleges, 401-13) describes the inscriptions in Chapel and 
Cloisters in detail, and Dr. Fowler has printed, in Appendix B, to his larger 
history, some interesting extracts from the Chapel Accounts. In 1653 
the two clerks, the “‘ Pulsator Campanae ” and the “ Modulator Organ- 
orum,” lost a part of their employment, and had to turn their attention 
to starting the Psalms, 
2 In the old building accounts preserved in the Library, there is a 
charge of 10s. 6d, in May 1517, for “‘ digging of the foundation of the 
cloister’ (Fowler’s History, 70-1).

of his College, and of Oldham, his friend and coadjutor, still 
remain.? 
The Library, the chief glory of Corpus, lay on the South 
side of the quadrangle. It is still, what its Founder made it, 
the typical College Library of the Renaissance, in form, in 
fittings and in its contents. Time, which has mellowed it, has 
brought little alteration. The stalls of books are still there, 
set at right angles to the walls, with flat desks fastened to the 
book-shelves. The sixteenth-century chains for books have 
gone, but the treasures which they bound are happily unplundered. 
The tranquillity of the noble room is only deepened by the four 
hundred years which have passed over its head. Fox bestowed 
on it, to begin with, a fine collection of manuscripts and books, 
Claymond, Rainolds, Brian Twyne and many others added to 
its store, as generations followed. President Turner’s great 
bequest did not reach it till the eighteenth century. But from 
the first the Corpus Library and its classical traditions represented 
worthily the learning of the day.2. A Latin and a Greek manu- 
script of the tenth century, an almost unique Irish Missal, 
marked still, it is said, with the stains of an Irish bog, a Saxon 
Bede of the eleventh century, and the earliest manuscript of 
Florence of Worcester, are among its unprinted treasures. Saints’ 
lives, chronicles, classics and philosophy are stored there beside 
manuscripts of Wycliffe and of Chaucer and the collections of 
Fulman, Miles Windsor, Brian Twyne. Fox and Claymond 
in early days contributed no small proportion of fine printed 
books. Splendid Aristotles from the press of Aldus,’ the Floren- 
tine Homer of 1488, arare Venetian Tacitus twenty years earlier, 
a De Officiis of 1466 from Mainz, and Aretino’s Phalaris from 
the earliest press at Oxford, bore witness from the first to the 
scholars and craftsmen of the Renaissance. There are books from 
the presses of Pynson and Wynkyn de Worde hardly less 
memorable than these. And the Prayer-Book of 1559 with 
the autographs of the Lords of the Council in it, the Bible of 
1611, a copy worthy of its theme, the sailing-orders of the 
Armada—a sheet translated from the Spanish—Shakespeare’s 
Second Folio and the first edition of Paradise Lost, main-

tained, as time went on, traditions which have never been 
allowed to fail. 
The Library looks South over the President’s garden towards 
the terrace and the Christ Church fields beyond. The President’s 
house, which commands that garden from the West, dates from 
the end of the sixteenth century, and for some eighty years 
or more it seems that the President kept his old quarters in the 
tower as well. Dr. Turner before the end of the seventeenth 
century added a projection to the house upon the East. The 
Fellows’ Garden and terrace on the Southern boundary of the 
College, were by that time fully planted, and there was a summer- 
house in the South-west corner, which Loggan’s plan depicts. 
The Common Room on the East side, nearer Merton, was made 
after the Restoration, together with some new chambers which 
were afterwards taken down. The battlements of the quad- 
rangle were added about 1624, and a curious little inventory 
of the same date mentions a crucifix, a ‘‘ halbert ’’ and a map 
of Canaan among the College goods.1_ Turnbull’s dial in the 
quadrangle was constructed probably in 1581: Kratzer’s earlier 
dial had not then disappeared. The pelican, dear to the hearts 
of many generations, was woven into the ancient vestments 
of the Chapel # long before it soared above the College court. 
1 See the Second Report of the Hist. MSS, Commission (126). The 
date of the inventory is 1623. 
2 See Fowler’s History (114, n.). Dr. Fowler’s larger History, his 
smaller history (Corpus Christi) and his other writings are now the chief 
authority for the story of the College. Other references have been already 
quoted. But the earlier sketches in Wood’s Colleges, in Ingram’s Memorials 
and elsewhere have been displaced by Dr. Fowler’s works, my debt to 
which is obvious. I have to thank the President for allowing me to 
consult the College documents, and the Librarian, the Bursar’s Assistant 
and incidentally Mr. Gibson for their kind help. The Collections in the 
Library include 22 volumes of MSS, by Fulman—I did not find the 25 
of which Dr. Fowler speaks—of which three, vols. IX, X and XI, deal 
with the College history, 12 volumes by Twyne and 2 volumes by Miles 
Windsor, besides some 30 volumes of Fulman’s Evidences (transcripts 
of deeds, etc.) and Hegge’s Treatise on Dials. Hegge’s catalogue of Fel- 
lows and Scholars, continued long after his day, is in the President’s 
keeping and has been printed by Dr. Fowler. The foundation documents 
in the College Archives include the Royal License or Charter of November 
1516, interesting deeds relating to the purchase of the site, and among 
others the indenture of 30 June, 1513, which contains Fox’s first plan for 
a monastic College. The Statutes, printed in the Statutes of the Colleges 
of Oxford, are preserved in the original of 1517, now without a seal, and 
in the revised copy signed by Fox in February 1528. They have been 
translated into English by G, R.M. Ward. The College Registers, chiefly 
a record of admissions, are less interesting than they might be. The first 
runs from 1517 to 1648, with one or two entries of 1660; the next begins 
in May 1648; and the third, which is called the second, ignoring the 
Commonwealth, dates from the Restoration. A small volume, mainly 
a Register of ‘‘ absences” between 1641 and 1653, contains notes of

THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 35 
Fox may well have discussed with Wolsey his plans for 
encouraging education in Oxford. But his new foundation was 
completed before the Cardinal’s more magnificent schemes took 
shape. By the end of 1523 Wolsey had resolved on the creation 
of his College. In 1524 his agents secured, by persistent impor- 
tunity at Rome, two Bulls authorising the suppression of St. 
Frideswide’s and of other monasteries to the value of three 
thousand ducats a year. Their revenues supplied the endow- 
ment needed, and in July 1525 the King granted his license for 
the foundation of Cardinal College. Even the King, however, 
could not extinguish the heart-burnings to which the suppression 
gave rise, and there is little doubt that the Minister’s agents 
showed themselves harsh and high-handed in their work.? 
Whether or not Wolsey was indifferent to the sufferings of the 
““poore wretches’”” whom he turned out, his Sovereign took 
occasion to point out to him the ‘‘ mumbling ” and “ murmur- 
ing’ which his methods caused. The ancient Priory vanished, 
under whose shadow Oxford had grown up. The Prior, John 
Burton, was transferred to Oseney. The venerable buildings 
with their eight centuries of dim tradition made way, wherever 
necessary, for a new and stately plan. Portions were allowed to 
stand and were worked into the new structure. But the Western 
end of the old Church and part of the Cloister beside it were 
removed.? Peckwater Inn, which had belonged to St. Frides- 
wide’s for many generations, was swept into the Cardinal’s 
scheme. Other inns and tenements adjoining were pulled down. 
On the South the ruinous town wall and St. Michael’s Church by 
the Gate were demolished, to find space for the South side of the 
punishments, chiefly loss of commons, under the Commonwealth. But 
Dr. Fowler prints a fuller list, including later entries of a similar kind. 
And the Libri Magni, books of accounts running from the 16th century, 
contain other interesting items, some of which Dr. Fowler also prints in 
the Appendices to his larger History. 
1 Cardinal Gasquet gives a careful account of this transaction (Henry 
VIII and the English Monasteries, ch. I1), with full references to Rymer’s 
Federa and to the Letters and Papers of Henry VIII, Wood (Colleges, 
414 sq.) gives a list of Convents suppressed, with an account of their 
Tevenues. But the details are in some cases doubtful. A priest, it seems, 
was paid, ‘‘ for keeping of the Monastery ”’ of St. Frideswide’s and saying 
the service there after the suppression, for some 13 months till the Dean 
and Canons were installed (Gutch, Collect. Curiosa, I, 207). 
? The most notorious were John Allen and Thomas Cromwell. Their 
critics noted that they all came to a bad end. 
* Wolsey destroyed the three Western bays of the nave. But the 
test of the Church, the Chapter House, the Refectory, and most of the 
Cloister were preserved. St. Frideswide’s cemetery lay largely to the 
North of the Church, and was bounded by St. Frideswide’s Lane which 
ran from the site of the house of the President of Corpus to Fish Street, 
now St. Aldate’s,

new quadrangle. Several small houses must have made way for 
the West front upon St. Aldate’s. London College was secured, 
and round it in the ancient Jewry other annexations and clear- 
ances began.! Canterbury College, though spared by the 
Cardinal, its voices not yet silenced like St. Frideswide’s, was 
destined to provide a site for another new quadrangle later 
on. 
The Cardinal is said, perhaps with some exaggeration, to have 
employed hundreds of workmen. He quartered his masons in 
Peckwater. He poured out money freely. Wood tells us that 
nearly eight thousand pounds were spent within a year.? Wood 
mentions also among the comptrollers of the building Roland 
Messynger, so lately a Fellow of Brasenose, who had found a 
patron more powerful than Sutton.4 At the end of 1526 Dr. 
London, Warden of New College, reported that the lodgings on 
the West side were almost completed,® that the tower over the 
entrance was as high as they, and that the arms of the King and 
Cardinal were most curiously set over the gate. On the South 
side another tower was rising: it is loftier now than it was in 
earlier days. The foundations of the Hall were five or six feet 
high. On the North side the foundations of a new church were 
visible, a Chapel which would have surpassed even King’s College 
at Cambridge in stateliness and scale. On the East side, near 
the old Church, lodgings or chambers were begun. The famous 
1 See Mr. H. Hurst’s notes on the site of Christ Church (Oxf. Topo- 
graphy, 198-201), and above all Mr. Salter’s valuable note on Burnel’s 
Inn (Oxf. Balliol Deeds, 91 sq.). Mr. Salter shows how Wolsey got hold 
of the lands and buildings West and North-west of the old Priory, and 
the “‘ dexterite and policie”’ used in “‘ handling,” not to say defrauding 
with vague promises of future compensation, Balliol College, Godstow, 
Studley, and other owners whose property he required. Members of the 
College may have been housed at first in the Priory buildings before the 
site of the quadrangle was secured. 
2 Surrenders later of Canterbury College, dated 27 Nov. 37 Hen. VIII, 
and of Peckwater Inn, by the Warden and Scholars of New College, dated 
4 July of the same year, are at the Record Office (Augmentation Off. Deeds 
of Surrender, Nos. 187 and 192). New College, Mr. Salter suggests to 
me, really surrendered Vine Hall, a property to the North, which the 
King united to Peckwater, and which for the purposes of the surrender 
is treated as a part of it. 
8 £7,835 between Novy. 1, 1528 and Oct. 7, 1529—“ and not unlikely 
twice or thrice as much for the three years preceding ” (Colleges, 425). 
See also Gutch (Collect. Curiosa, I, 208).

aging the Cardinal’s buildings (Boase, Register, I, 39).

and Papers, IV, p. 1219).

died, the Chapel foundations were in places some feet above the ground : 
he says three yards, See also Hurst (Oxf. Topog., 47-8).

kitchen, with larder-houses, pastry-houses, slaughter-houses, 
stables and servants’ rooms beyond it, was the earliest part of 
the building to be finished. The sixteenth century laughed to 
find that food was the Cardinal’s first consideration; but the 
Cardinal’s scholars had no reason to complain. In essentials the 
kitchen has been very little altered: Wolsey’s gridiron still 
hangs on its wall. The Hall, one of the noblest refectories in 
Europe, was ready for use in 1529.1 Cardinal Campeggio made 
presents of timber and materials to his brother Cardinal.? Foxe, 
no lover of Roman Cardinals, bore witness to the excellent work 
that was done. And, while clearing and building went on 
continuously, the Staff were appointed and the Statutes drawn 
up. 
: The elaborate regulations of Cardinal College, which Wolsey 
revised in 1527, fell to the ground with his original design. But 
they contemplated a great foundation, including nearly a hun- 
dred and eighty persons,‘ and possessing a revenue of two 
thousand pounds a year. A Dean and sixty Senior Canons 5 
were to form the Corporation. Forty Petty Canons corresponded 
to the junior scholars found elsewhere. The forty-two servants 
of the Chapel included sixteen choristers and a teacher of music. 
Six Public Professors,® twenty-three servants and five lawyers 
or men of business completed the Staff. The Sub-Dean, the four 
Censors, the three Bursars and the four “‘ Private and Domestic ”” 
Professors were chosen from the Senior Canons. But of this

long, 40 ft. wide and 50 ft. high, and the kitchen a cube of 40 ft. Among 
the Chapter House records there is a magnificent account of Wolsey’s 
plate. See also Gutch (Collect. Curiosa, II, 283-344). Gutch gives the 
cost of the yellow and green tiles with which the Hall was paved (Jb., 
I, 206).

of charters.

of Henry VIII’s College, in vol. II of the Statutes of the Colleges of Oxford, 
from MS. copies at the British Museum and the Record Office. An 
unsigned copy with a broken seal of Wolsey’s is in the Christ Church 
Chapter House. Christ Church has no Statutes but is governed by orders 
of the Chapter. 
« The exact number, it seems, was 177. Wood (Colleges, 422) speaks 
of 186 persons ‘‘ (or rather 200),”’ but his figures do not agree with the 
original Statutes. Nor does it seem that Mr. Thompson’s figures (Christ 
Church, 3-4) are quite right. There were 23 servants in all and 5 lawyers 
or men of business, including the auditor and the clerk of lands. The 
Dean alone had 7 servants (Statutes, Card. Coll., 105-6 and 162).

  38 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
large community only eighteen Canons were at first appointed 
with John Higdon or Hygden, ex-President of Magdalen, for their 
Dean. And though Wolsey soon added to their number, and 
imported additional students from Cambridge, his plan was far 
from completed when he died In many respects Wolsey’s 
Statutes followed the usual lines. Their distinctive features were 
the scale and generosity of the arrangements, and the strong 
encouragement given to education, not in the College only but 
in the University at large.? ‘‘ Insatiable to get and more prince- 
like in bestowing,” Wolsey spared nothing to make his College 
worthy of his wealth and fame. But he had only a few years to 
carry out his project, before all his schemes and ambitions were 
destroyed. 
No prayers availed to save the Cardinal’s foundation, when 
the Cardinal himself was overthrown. Higdon, the Dean, carried 
to Court a petition for mercy. Henry seemed for a time disposed 
to listen to the plea. But in the end, as was not unusual, his less 
generous instincts overcame him. There were too many greedy 
claimants for the spoil. The ornaments and vestments of the 
Church were seized and taken to London. The lands were sold 
or “begged away by hungry courtiers.” The College was 
suppressed.* Its beneficiaries were for the most part left to shift 
for themselves. Great schemes of confiscation and of ecclesi- 
astical reorganisation were on foot. In July 1532, not unin- 
fluenced, it may be, by “‘ the dispersed remnant of the Cardinal’s 
scholars,” the King established a new College of a Dean and 
twelve Prebendaries or Canons in Oxford, subject to no Bishop, 
Archbishop or Legate, but to the King alone.* It was to be an 
ecclesiastical foundation, like other Cathedral Churches. But it 
was no such house of learning as the Cardinal had planned. A 
prebend in the diocese of York was appropriated to the Dean, 
and stipends of ten marks a year to the Canons. Provision was 
made in the Statutes for masses and other services, Anne’s name 
1 Wood gives a list of early Canons, and thinks Wolsey appointed 
‘*a very considerable number.” But he adds, ‘“‘a note which I have 
seen saith only 30” (Colleges, 423). Hutten gives 30 as the number at 
Wolsey’s death. (See Plummer’s Elizabethan Oxford, 59.) 
2 There were provisions, among others, for tutors to look after the 
funds of the junior Canons, for 20 rich young Commoners, to be main- 
tained at their own expense, and for hospitality to be shown to Kings 
and their heirs (Statutes, Card. Coll., 100, 103-4). 
2 The deed of surrender, without signatures, dated 15 Jan. 22 Hen. 
VIII, is at the Record Office (Augmentation Off. Deeds of Surrender, No. 
188). 
« See the Statutes of King Henry VIII’s College in the Statutes of 
Colleges. They evidently date from 1533. Besides the Prebendaries 
or Canons there were vicars, clerks and choristers.

replacing Catharine’s in the prayers. Provision was made also 
for the superintendence of the College property, for the upkeep 
of the Dean’s and Canons’ houses, for the election of Treasurers 
and the keeping of accounts. But the provision for education 
almost disappeared. Higdon, the old Dean, was continued as 
Dean of the new foundation. But he died a few months later 
and Dean Oliver took his place. Two of Wolsey’s Canons, but 
only two, it seems, were appointed to the Chapter. Dr. Cottis- 
ford, the Rector of Lincoln, brought his University experience. 
Robert Wakefield brought from Cambridge the reputation of 
“the prime Linguist of his time.” But though some conspicuous 
scholars were included later in the list of Canons, like John Cheke 
and Oglethorpe and Leland,? King Henry VIII's College had only 
a precarious life. The chief incidents recorded in its history were 
the destruction in 1538 of St. Frideswide’s venerable shrine and 
the surrender a few years later of the whole foundation into the 
hands of the King.? Then at last the way was clear for a more 
permanent settlement. The claims of education were revived. 
The Bishopric of Oxford, founded in 1542, was surrendered to 
the Crown and constituted afresh. A new College, uniting the 
interests of learning and episcopacy, “ Ecclesia Christi Cathe- 
dralis Oxon,” rose upon the ruins of the old. St. Frideswide’s 
and Oseney, Canterbury and Peckwater contributed their history 
and their spoils. And Henry VIII, though Christ Church men 
have sometimes been reluctant to admit it,4 became the Founder 
of a noble corporation, not unworthy to inherit his Minister’s 
designs. 
The new See had its Cathedral at Christ Church, but its 
revenues were distinct from those of the College. The Dean and 
Canons appointed by the Royal Charter of November 1546, took 
possession of Wolsey’s buildings and of property valued at some- 
1 The choristers were to be instructed. Mr. St. John Tyrwhitt (Col- 
leges of Oxford, 306~7) speaks of Henry reconstituting some of Wolsey’s 
lectures as “‘ the King’s Lectures.’”’ It is not unlikely. But the Statutes 
say nothing about it. 
2 Sir J. Cheke, Edward VI’s tutor and a figure of some note in Tudor 
politics, was like Leland a Cambridge man, The Canonry helped to pay 
his services at Court. Leland, it seems, had more to do with All Souls 
than with Christ Church. Oglethorpe was a Magdalen. man. 
8 The surrender signed by Dean Oliver, Cox, Leland, Oglethorpe and 
others, and dated May 20 in the 37th year of Henry VIII, is not, as Wood 
says, in the Tower of the Archives, but at the Record Office (Augmentation 
Off. Deeds of Surrender, No. 191), together with the surrender of the 
Bishopric of the same date (No. 189), signed by Bishop King—‘‘ Ro. 
Oxon.”—and Dean Cox. (See also Wood, Colleges, 431, and Gairdner, 
Letts. and Papers of Henry VIII, vol. 21, pt. ii, pp. 333-8, who quotes 
the important grant of lands dated 11 Dec. 38 Henry VIII.)

thing over two thousand pounds a year.1_ The Oxford grants 
included not only Canterbury College but the buildings of St. 
Bernard’s, with a part of Durham College grove, and the sites and 
remains of Oseney and of Rewley. The Dean and Canons had 
special duties towards the Cathedral, and had to keep a full Staff 
for the service of the church. But they had special duties also 
towards the University, and had to maintain three Regius 
Professors, in Hebrew, Greek and Theology. Besides that they 
presided over a great College of a hundred Students, whose 
numbers have since been tolled for many generations as a nightly 
curfew in Tom Quad.? The eight Canons were lodged in the 
precincts. One of them, Tresham, seems to have been a member 
of Henry’s earlier foundation. Some had been previously Canons 
of Oseney. One was already Provost of Oriel. One became the 
first President of St. John’s. A Sub-Dean, Treasurers, Censors 
and Readers helped to govern the College. The Students were 
divided into Theologists, Philosophers, Disciples.2 Eight Chap- 
lains, eight lay clerks or singing men, eight choristers and other 
officers were provided for the Church. Some sixteen or eighteen 
servants and some twenty bedesmen made up the College 
1 Wood’s figure is £2,000 (Colleges, 433), Mr. Thompson’s £2,200 (12). 
The revenues came largely from Oseney: most of the endowments of 
Cardinal College had disappeared. There is in the Record Office (Aug. 
Off. Particulars for Grants, 827) a long Memorandum in English giving 
a detailed account of the lands assigned to the Cathedral Church, with 
covenants to maintain at certain salaries petty Canons, clerks, choristers, 
Readers and other officers for the educational foundation. The copy of 
this Memo. in the Christ Church Treasury is dated 1 Oct. 1546—the original 
may bear the same date, certain clauses at the end are stained and almost 
illegible. It seems to contain, as Mr. Thompson says (273-6), the draft 
of a projected constitution which was not fully carried out. Cardinal 
Gasquet, relying on certain other Augmentation Office documents at 
the Record Office (Misc. Books, 415, f. 108, and Tveasurers’ Rolls of 
Accounts, 3, f£. 201—he quotes this rather differently), estimates that 
Henry allotted to Oxford between Mar. 25 ‘“‘anno 36°” and Michael- 
mas “‘ anno 38°”’ some £3,102, and notes that at the end of the reign. 
the College was in debt and that Edward VI paid £2,400 to Dean Cox. 
A substantial sum went apparently in building (Henry VIII and the 
English Monasteries, 432). 
2 The number was raised to ror by the Studentship founded after 
the Restoration by William Thurston’s bequest of £800 to ‘‘ King’s College 
in Oxford.” Oriel, relying on Edward II, and Brasenose, as the repre- 
sentatives of King Alfred’s brew-house, also put in a claim. One wonders 
that University abstained. (See Wood, Colleges, 436, and Thompson, 
12-13.) 
3 The 20 Theologi were intended to take Orders. But a few students 
might graduate in law or medicine. The Philosophi varied in age, number 
and degree. The Discipuli are not mentioned in the Chapter Roll of 
1548: but 40 Philosophers and 40 Disciples gradually emerged (Thomp- 
son, 35).

  THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 4 
Staff.1 Commoners were from the first admitted,? and other 
young gentlemen came over from Broadgates Hall for tuition. 
A limited number of the hundred Studentships were afterwards 
assigned by Queen Elizabeth to Westminster, and the connection 
became in the end a source of —— both to the College and 
to the School. 
Henry’s death within three ee of the foundation may 
have hastened the completion of the scheme. It is probably the 
reason why Christ Church never received Statutes but was from 
the beginning governed by usage. The Dean and Chapter have 
always held an exceptional position. They receive their mandate 
from the Crown. Their Visitor is the Sovereign, not the Bishop. 
The Cathedral is their College Chapel, and the Dean claims the 
authority of Ordinary within it. They are primarily an academ- 
ical body. Their only diocesan function is to elect the Bishop, 
who has no special authority within their walls. Many gener- 
ations later, when menaced by a Parliamentary inquiry, they 
defined their own peculiar status, and the relation of the Cathedral 
to the College, in language which Athanasius might not have 
disavowed : 
“There is absolutely no separation between them, as if they were 
two distinct members in one and the same body. Neither is the 
Chapter an appendage to the College, nor is the College an appendage 
to the Chapter. They form one single foundation under one head, 
and so intimately blended together are they in all their parts, that 
questions involving the constitution of the one cannot be answered 
without including what belongs to the other.” * 
In the absence of Statutes the Dean and Chapter met on Sunday 
afternoons to make rules for their College. They had to pay 
twelve pence if they failed to attend. Every scholar, before 
entering the House, required to have a tutor, a psalter, a cate- 
chism, and honest and comely apparel. He must have also

Thompson (36 and App. B.). Hutten’s MS. account in the Chapter 
House (Liber Successi: Dec: Canon: Alumn.) reckons 24 officers and 
servants and as many bedesmen. The number of Students was at first 
under too. There were Readers in Natural and Moral Philosophy, Dia- 
lectic, Rhetoric and Mathematics. Wood speaks of a schoolmaster, an 
usher and 4o children: but these were suggestions only of the Memor- 
andum of Oct. 1st, 1546. Wood’s mistake, however, pointed out by 
Gutch and by Mr. Thompson (App. B.), reappears in the Report of the 
first University Commission and in the Colleges of Oxford (307).

In the same volume 9 ‘“‘ Hye Commoners ”’ and 18 “‘ Second Commoners ”” 
are mentioned in 1553 (f. 26). But in 1557 there is a note—‘ No Com- 
moners of either sort this and some of the following years” (f. 37).

sufficient bedding. He must know his grace by heart. And he 
must take an oath to the King. Attendance at prayers, dis- 
putations and lectures was expected ; morning prayers began at 
five o’clock. Some form of “collections” for scholars was 
established.1 Eccentricities of dress were forbidden—‘‘ whyte 
and pricked doublets,” galligaskins, “lacyd gownes.”? The 
price of commons was regulated by a small committee every 
week. Dramatic entertainments, four yearly, were from the first 
a favourite recreation, a comedy in Latin and a comedy in Greek, 
and a tragedy in Latin and a tragedy in Greek. Few Sovereigns 
who visited Christ Church were spared the performance of a play. 
Fines were imposed for failures in discipline. In 1554 Bishop 
Gardiner, as Visitor and Chancellor of England, accompanied a 
stern warning with the suggestion that the issue of formal 
Statutes was contemplated by the King and Queen. But what- 
ever Philip and Mary intended, the Statutes never appeared. 
The Dean and Chapter continued to make the necessary regula- 
tions, and their rules proved at least as useful and elastic as the 
Statutes which pious Founders anxiously elaborated and which 
Visitors interpreted or misinterpreted elsewhere. 
Christ Church was soon involved in the troubles of the Refor- 
mation, though both Edward and Mary added to the endowments 
it enjoyed. Richard Cox, who succeeded to the uneasy seat of 
Higdon and of Oliver, was an Eton and a Cambridge man, and 
had been a junior Canon of Cardinal College. He was a figure of 
note among the early Reformers, a friend of Cranmer, a tutor to 
King Edward, and one of the authors of the Prayer-Book of 1549. 
He brought Peter Martyr to Oxford. He was a stalwart on the 
Protestant side. Chancellor from 1547 to 1552—“‘ Cancellor,” 
his enemies called him, of all the traditions which the University 
loved best—he was one of the Visitors who worked their will on 
the Colleges then. High-handed he may have been. It was_ 
said none dared deny him.4 He has been charged with the | 
ruthless destruction of manuscripts and books. His wife was 
one of the first ladies to make her home in an Oxford College. 
Mrs. Peter Martyr came to bear her company, and died and was 
buried there, close by St. Frideswide’s shrine. But when Peter 
Martyr was driven out of England, the poor lady was dug up and 
flung on a dung-heap—to such singular severities did orthodoxy

lead. Cox, like Martyr, was exiled under Mary, and the Coxians 
and Knoxians fought out their differences with the fierce piety 
of Protestants abroad. Cox lost his Deaneries.1 But he became 
Bishop of Ely after Elizabeth’s return, and tradition has pre- 
served or invented the Queen’s threat to unfrock the ‘‘ proud 
prelate,” if he would not give up the Episcopal garden in Holborn 
on which Hatton wished to build. The Bishop was perhaps as 
tenacious as the courtier in holding on to the good things of life. 
His successor, Marshall, unkindly described as a drunkard and a 
turncoat—‘‘ sub Edouardo publice retractans, sub Maria rever- 
sus ad vomitum,”’ comments the Head of a neighbouring College ? 
—was at any rate sincere enough in his Romanist opinions to 
suffer deprivation and disgrace. He is said to have encouraged 
Cranmer’s recantation. He helped to burn him when the recan- 
tation was withdrawn. He saw Great Tom baptized afresh in 
the name of Mary, and the Vice-Chancellor, Tresham, break into 
ecstasies in Latin on hearing “ pulchram Mariam ” ring for Mass 
again. 
Marshall’s successor, George Carew, came of a famous Cornish 
family. But he soon passed on to preferment elsewhere. Samp- 
son, Dean from 1561 to 1565, once a Cambridge man and an 
Inner Temple student, was a friend of Cranmer, Latimer and 
Ridley, and “a very bitter enemy of the Roman hierarchy and 
of Papal rites.’’ He would not hear of wearing vestments. He 
called on the Chapter to sweep idols and images away. He was 
never satisfied without a scruple or a grievance. And he lost his 
Deanery by his stubborn and uncompromising ways. Thomas 
Godwin, his successor, a comely personage, entertained Eliza- 
beth, who could appreciate comeliness in men. The College list 
about that time seems to have included some two hundred 
persons, with servants and tradesmen thrown in.* One of the 
Canons wrote a tragedy for the occasion on a grim example of 
Royal manners, showing how King Tereus ate his son. Thomas 
Cooper, Dean from 1567 to 1570, was the son of a poor tailor in 
Cat Street, a chorister at Magdalen in his boyhood, and in turn 
schoolmaster, physician, historian and divine. The first of Christ 
Church lexicographers, he wrote a well-known Treasury of Greek 
and Latin, which his wife in a fury tore up. Leicester nominated 
him more than once as Vice-Chancellor, and the Queen for the 
1\Christ Church and Westminster. Mr. Thompson calls him “ the 
first of the only two Oxford men ”’ who have held the See of Ely (p. 18). 
But Morton and Gray, both Balliol men, had held it already.

spelt Martial.

sake of his Dictionary forgave him the misconduct of his wife. 
He was appointed finally Bishop of Winchester, and as Visitor of 
Magdalen made rules for his old College. 
Two Elizabethan Deans, who passed on to the Northern 
Primacy, left their mark upon the House. One of them, John 
Piers, Head in turn of Balliol and of Christ Church, has been 
described elsewhere.1 The other, Tobie Matthew, started his 
Oxford life, it is said, at thirteen, was President of St. John’s at 
the age of twenty-six and Dean of Christ Church at the age of 
thirty.? His gifts or his looks won him favour with both Eliza- 
beth and James. He was a famous and prolific preacher. 
“Busy and pragmatical,” he had yet discretion, energy and 
charm. But Matthew also had his misadventures, including a 
notorious scuffle with the Principal of Brasenose in St. Mary’s 
Church. In later days he had charge of Lady Arabella Stuart, 
whom he unwisely allowed to escape. At Christ Church he was 
an efficient ruler. There are decisions of his day in the Chapter 
records insisting on exercises and Latin and Greek. There is a 
decree of May 1577, that none “shall be chosen to the divines 
table that shall not be able to understand at the first sight a 
psalme, or a chapter of the old Testament in hebrewe.’”’ There 
are notes of punishments, orders ‘“‘ De Pugnis et Litibus repri- 
mendis,” a significant notice that “ none of what estate soever 
shall keepe gelding or other beast in the Quadrant.” There are 
letters in the Sub-Dean’s Book from Queen Elizabeth.4 Christ 
Church had many reminders of its connection with the Crown. 
William James, Matthew’s successor, was Elizabeth’s host on her 
second visit to Oxford. Ravis, the first Westminster boy 
appointed to the Deanery, “a grave and good man,” saw the end 
of the Elizabethan age. John King, the nephew of the first 
Bishop of the diocese, was also a ‘“‘ King of preachers.” Five of 
his sons were members of the College. He passed from the 
Deanery to the Bishopric of London, and was the last English 
Bishop to burn a heretic at the stake. William Goodwin, also a 
notable preacher, spurned or missed promotion, and died in office 
as Dean. He received at Christ Church the unhappy Winter 
King, who was pleased “ to matriculate himself a member of the 
University.” Goodwin’s funeral sermons, we are told, moved 
both City and University to tears. But Dean Corbet, who

succeeded him, was a merrier divine. To laugh and make others 
laugh was thought to be the business of his life. But wit and 
power «mingled with his rollicking fun. He loved boy’s play and 
was loved by Ben Jonson. He loved conviviality too. The 
“best poet of all the Bishops of England,” he was accused, before 
he attained to that ambiguous distinction, of singing ballads on 
market day at Abingdon Cross.! 
Manners change. Brian Duppa had less poetry in him. But 
he was fitter to adorn a Deanery in the days of Laud. He left it 
for a Bishopric before the Civil War. Born in the year of the 
Armada, tutor to the second Charles in boyhood, he lived on 
to celebrate his pupil’s restoration. Originally a Westminster 
Student, he passed to All Souls as Fellow, and back to Christ 
Church as Dean in 1629. He entertained the King in 1636; he 
had restored the Cathedral already, and Charles’ first act was to 
worship there. Plays were produced in honour of the visit. 
Oxford scholars also signalised their loyalty by elegiacs on the 
recent birth of a Princess, elegiacs which Puritans might have 
thought profane : 
“ Aspice, parturiunt Virgo, Regina, Mariae: 
Edit Virgo Deum, nupta Maria Deam!” 
Under Dean Duppa the College grew and prospered. Its 
numbers were so large that Royal mandates nominating Students 
for admission were not always easy to obey. Westminster sent 
up successful scholars, and their brother Students entertained 
them on arrival with such boisterous hospitality that in 1638 the 
Visitor had to intervene. The Dean and Chapter were com- 
manded at their ‘‘ uttermost peril’”’ to stop these Westminster 
suppers. Already, before this, Bachelor suppers had been for- 
bidden, and the ‘“‘ impertinent complaints ” of students sharply 
checked by the Crown. A new block of rooms for wealthy 
Commoners had been added. Young nobles, sometimes called 
Canon Commoners or Doctors’ Commoners,? dined on the dais 
with the Canons. Upper Commoners*® and under Commoners 
formed two other grades. Poor Scholars, battelers and servi- 
tors had their own distinctions. And while the Commoners 
multiplied and overflowed into the Dean’s.and Canons’ quarters, 
their servants multiplied still faster. Duppa found it necessary

to limit the number of servitors who waited on “the students, 
chaplains and under commoners of this Church.”1 A good 
deal of discipline must have been needed, and Laud and his 
supporters were determined to enforce it, in the great and 
heterogeneous household which the walls of Christ Church 
sheltered before the Civil War. 
The tenure of Dean Samuel Fell covered a stormier period, 
from 1638 to 1648. A devoted Royalist, Fell did his best, when 
the Parliamentary troops first arrived in Oxford, to conceal the 
College plate. Christ Church owes to him, among other import- 
ant additions to its buildings, the beautiful fan tracery over the 
Hall stair. He welcomed his Sovereign after Edgehill. He 
lodged him in the Deanery when the Court came to Oxford, and 
had a private way opened past Corpus to Merton, for the King 
to use in visiting the Queen. In 1644 the Royalist Parliament 
was opened by Charles in Christ Church Hall. Students and 
Commoners drilled in the great quadrangle. Rupert’s troopers 
jangled through the meadows. Thanksgivings for the Prince’s 
victories rang through the choir. Twenty Christ Church Students 
were officers in the Royal army. Young John Fell, the Dean’s 
son, whose fame was destined to eclipse his father’s, held a com- 
mission as Ensign. His friend Dolben rose to be a Major, and 
was wounded at Marston Moor, in the diocese which he after- 
wards ruled as Archbishop. The plate which the Parliament 
men left behind them found its way into the Royal Mint.? 
Samuel Fell grudged nothing to the service of his master. He 
treated the Parliamentary Visitors with contempt. Summoned 
to London, he was imprisoned and deprived. But he did not 
long survive his suspension, for the King’s death broke his heart. 
Mrs. Fell, refusing to leave the Deanery, where she is said to have 
buried the Bedels’ maces so securely that they were never found 
again, was carried out by soldiers into the quadrangle and took 
refuge in an apothecary’s house. Most of the Canons also 
refused to acknowledge the new order, and preferred to face 
deprivation like the Dean.’ 
1 To 30 (Jb. 59). But this number apparently did not include the 
servants of the higher grades of Commoners. 2s. 4d. a week was allowed 
for each servitor’s maintenance. In the Register of Decrees in the Chapter 
House there are early 17th century entries limiting the Gentlemen Com- 
moners to 4 servitors only at table, and referring to quarrels between 
the Canons’ servants and the Gentlemen’s men (pp. 105 and 59). 
2 The Chapter House records fail at this period. The Register of 
Decrees ends with Dean Duppa, and the Sub-Dean’s Book ends with 
one or two entries in 1643 and 1646. 
* Prof. Burrows in his summary estimates that there were 52 expul- 
sions and 60 submissions. But the latter included several almsmen and 
servants. The Students’ answers to the Visitors in May 1648 showed 
little inclination to submit, (See Register of Visitors, 571 and 68-74.)

THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 47 
  In the dark days that followed for the Church of England, 
young John Fell and his two friends Dolben and Allestree kept 
up the old services at Beam Hall in Merton Street,! and it says 
something for the tolerance of the Commonwealth that they 
were undisturbed. A Presbyterian Dean was followed by an 
Independent. Edward Reynolds, one of the Parliamentary 
Visitors, showed himself both moderate and able. John Owen 
was a conspicuous Puritan divine. Owen had followed Cromwell 
to Scotland. He preached Ireton’s funeral sermon. He became 
a strong and active Vice-Chancellor in Oxford. He was elected 
Member for the University, but not allowed, as a clergyman, to 
sit. He wrote untiringly upon theology, but for all his fighting 
vigour he was capable of kindness and indulgence to men whose 
views he did not share. Under Dean Owen, Roundhead though 
he was, the College improved its discipline and kept up its num- 
bers. Its services were altered, but its Chaplains do not seem 
to have been dismissed. Prayers were more regular. Godly 
tutors were insisted on. ‘‘ Immoderate expences’ were dis- 
couraged, and even the battels of Gentlemen Commoners limited 
to five shillings a week. ‘Scandalous fashions of long and 
powdered hair” were put down, though the Puritan Dean was 
something of a dandy. Undergraduates who misbehaved were 
whipped. But the Restoration brought the old ways back. 
George Morley, once a friend of Falkland and a lifelong friend 
of Izaak Walton, was appointed Dean by Charles II.4 And 
when he passed on quickly to a Bishopric, the long and famous 
tenure of John Fell began. 
John Fell, we are told, was a Christ Church Student at eleven 
and a Master of Arts at eighteen. He returned as a Canon on 
the Restoration, and Dolben and Allestree came back with him. 
The features of the three friends, the jack, the chub and the red 
herring,’ may be studied together in the well-known picture in 
the College Hall. Within a few months Fell was appointed 
Dean. Fifteen years later he became Bishop of Oxford also, and 
few men played so great a part in Oxford life. Versatile, master- 
ful, tireless as he was, too strong in his will, too active in his 
1 Mr. Carée (Wren and Tom Tower, 6) has an important note on Beam 
Hall, which still exists. It was occupied by Dr. Willis (Wood’s Life, 
I, 447). * Reynolds was Dean from 1648 to 1651 and again just before the 
Restoration. He was afterwards Warden of Merton and Bishop of 
Norwich. Owen, who had replaced him, was ejected in his favour by 
Parliament on March 13, 1660 (Wood, Life, I, 307).

energies to avoid making enemies, as the epigram suggests,+ 
Fell’s influence was felt in every department of University 
affairs. He was of course a strong loyalist and churchman. 
He was resolute in restoring the ejected Anglicans. He renewed 
the old services, the surplices, the organ. He attended church 
four times a day. Evelyn even accused him of preaching in 
blank verse. ‘‘ However,’’ adds the Diarist hastily, “he is a 
good man.” ? Fell completed the Christ Church buildings. He 
hung Great Tom in Wren’s great tower.* He rebuilt the Palace 
at Cuddesdon. He opened the Sheldonian Theatre and made it 
the home of the University Press. He printed Wood’s work, 
and would have forgiven Wood’s ingratitude, if Wood had not 
found his generosity so hard to bear. He urged the East India 
Company to evangelise the East. He tried to enforce discipline, 
to check drunkenness—the College had its examples of “ notori- 
ous and incorrigible’”’ behaviour “—to make a reality of the 
examinations for degrees. He fought hard for the right of his 
Canons to preach University sermons at Christ Church instead 
of at St. Mary’s as no mere “ Punctilio of Grandeur.” The 
old Cavaliers delighted to place their sons in his keeping. The 
House grew and prospered under his rule.* 
Fell received Charles II at Christ Church. He received the 
Duchess of Cleveland also and accepted the charge of her son. 
At a later date, in a year of crisis, when Charles summoned a 
Parliament at Oxford, Fell placed the College at the disposal 
of the Court. He entertained James and his Duchess. He 
carried out—he had little choice in the matter—the Royal 
demand for the expulsion of John Locke.? One of his last 
actions was to appeal for volunteers to serve against Monmouth. 
But his death in 1686 saved him from any further acquiescence 
in the methods of King James. After some months’ interval 
1 “T do not like thee, Dr. Fell,” etc. The lines were applied to John 
Fell and not to his father (Notes and Queries, Fourth Series, 4, 313). 
2 See Evelyn’s Diary under the 24th February 1665. 
8 This subject is fully discussed by Mr. Carée in his pleasant volume 
on Wren and Tom Tower, where he prints seven letters from Wren to 
Bishop Fell, which he found in the College Treasury, with other papers. 
4 See the sad records of Sir Morrison and Sir Levett in 1664 (Chapter 
Book, 1648-88, p. 126). 
5 See Fell’s statement of 6 March 1674 among the Royal Letters in 
the Chapter records. 
® In 1658 there seem to have been 66 members, besides those on the 
foundation. But in Fell’s day Gentlemen Commoners came freely and 
numbers, no doubt, increased fast (see Thompson, 85-6). Langbaine’s 
total in 1651 is 223, including servants. ‘ a 
' Fell had little sympathy for Locke’s opinions. But before carrying 
out the Royal order he pointed out that at Christ Church there was no 
evidence to condemn him. The King’s ‘‘mandat” is entered in the 
first Chapter Book (p. 249) under date 15 November 1684.

  THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 49 
that reckless King appointed John Massey of Merton, a follower 
of Obadiah Walker, to the vacant place, and the new Dean lost 
no time in conforming to his Sovereign’s faith. A new Chapel 
was made in the old refectory of Canterbury College, where the 
King heard mass in 1687. Commoners began to fall away. 
The Christ Church bells found few to share their rejoicings when 
they rang for the birth of the Prince of Wales. On William’s 
coming, Massey fled. Aldrich, an experienced and a well-loved 
Tutor, was appointed to the Deanery in 1689. Before the new 
Sovereign’s reign had ended Christ Church was rejoicing in 
popularity again. 
Apart from the Deans who ruled over her, Christ Church can 
boast of many famous sons. Wood gives an imposing list of 
Bishops and Archbishops. One of the Archbishops, Lancelot 
Blackburne, a Student of Charles II’s day, was alleged to have 
had some brief experience as a buccaneer. Scandal told many 
other stories to discredit him, but the jolly, witty prelate lived 
them down. Only three Bishops of Oxford lie in the Cathedral, 
and only two of these, Robert King and John Fell, are known 
to fame. Cranmer and even Tyndale have sometimes been 
included among the members of Wolsey’s original foundation. 
Thomas Randolph, Elizabeth’s Ambassador to Mary Stuart, 
was one of the earliest members of the College. To Christ Church 
or to Broadgates Hall across the way, where Commoners were 
sometimes lodged who received tuition at Christ Church,? there 
came a group of brilliant young Elizabethans—Philip Sidney, a 
delicate boy of fourteen, Richard Carew of Antony,’ scholar, 
poet and historian of his county, William Camden, rejected by 
Magdalen,* Richard Hakluyt already distinguished by his love 
of voyages, and, according to one very doubtful tradition, Fulke 
Greville,’ who loved Sidney best of all. William Harrison, who 
1 Even Prof. Gairdner thinks Cranmer was asked to join (D.N.B.). 
But, as Mr. Thompson suggests (6-7), Cranmer’s name may have been 
confused with that of Thomas Canner, one of the earliest Canons. Tyn- 
dale’s nomination seems difficult to credit, for in 1525 he was already 
abroad and in close touch with Luther. But Foxe again vouches for it, 
Hutten repeats the tradition, and Mr. S, G. Hamilton accepts it in his 
history of Hertford College (105). 
2 Some came on to Christ Church ; some, like Sidney, matriculated 
and stayed at Broadgates Hall (Thompson, 36). 
® Not to be confused with his contemporary George Carew, the son 
of the Dean, who became Earl of Totnes. 
¢ Camden had some early connection with Magdalen, but failed to 
secure a Demyship there. 
5 Sir S. Lee would seem to accept the tradition in his article on Sidney, 
but to reject it in his article on Greville (D.N.B.). Greville was at Jesus 
College, Cambridge, but was in 1588 created an Oxford M.A. (Foster, 
Alumni Oxonienses, 1st Series, vol. II).

50 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
may rank with Camden, took his Bachelor’s degree at Christ 
Church but went to Cambridge first. In the same age William 
Gager, an accomplished Latin poet and a defender of the drama,! 
wrote Latin plays which were acted at the House. George 
Peele, a greater dramatist, helped in their production. He 
passed from Broadgates Hall to Christ Church in 1574. There 
he took his degree and proved his metal as a poet, before descend- 
ing or ascending into the immortal company of the Elizabethan 
stage. With Gager there came up from Westminster Leonard 
Hutten, another fine Latinist and scholar, one of the first his- 
torians of the College * and one of the first of Oxford antiquarians. 
His monument in the Cathedral still bears witness to the reputa- 
tion for piety, simplicity and learning which he bore.® 
In 1599, when Hutten was appointed a Canon, Robert Burton 
of Brasenose was elected to a Studentship and became for forty 
years a member of the House. He calculated the date of his 
own death and indulged himself by writing his own epitaph.4 
Mischievous undergraduates declared that, to prove his calcula- 
tion accurate, he ‘‘ sent up his soul to heaven thro’ a noose about 
his neck.” William Strode and William Cartwright were two 
other Christ Church playwrights, whose dramas King Charles 
in 1636 witnessed or enjoyed. The Royal Slave was a conspicuous 
success. Busby, then a don of thirty and not yet the most 
awful and eminent of schoolmasters, won fame in the part of 
Cratander, who was generally regarded as a prig. Cartwright 
was not only a dramatist but a “ seraphical”’ preacher, a meta- 
physician, and a ‘“‘ miracle of industry and wit.” When he died 
of camp fever in 1643, the King went into mourning—“ dropt a 
teare,”’ says Aubrey, “‘ at the newes of his death ’’—and he found 
a grave in the Cathedral precincts with many a famous figure of 
the camp and Court. Wood gives a pitiful list of monuments 
erected to the loyal servants of the Crown who perished in those 
unhappy years—Sir John Smith, who saved the Royal Standard 
at Edgehill, Chief Justice Bankes, once a member of Queen’s 
College, Sir Henry Gage, ‘‘ plumbea trajectus glande,” one of 
the few Royalist soldiers who made himself universally beloved, 
Sir Thomas Gardiner, the young Captain knighted by the King 
at dinner in Christ Church for bringing news of a victory from 
1 Against John Rainolds. (See later, pp. 144-5.) 
2 His account of the foundation is in the Chapter House. His dis- 
sertation on the Antiquities of Oxford, edited by Mr. Plummer, has been 
published in Elizabethan Oxford (O.H.S.). 
8 Wood gives the inscription (Colleges, 503). The Dean’s Admission 
Books (I, 66) show that Hutten came up, with William Gager and George 
Peele, in 1574, not in 1571, as Mr. Thompson (44-5) says. 
« See Wood (Colleges, 490). It was left for discoverers of the twentieth 
century to credit Burton, like Bacon, with writing Shakespeare’s plays.

THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 51 
Prince Rupert, and the three Stuart brothers of the house of 
Lennox, killed and buried one after another under the high 
altar side by side. Their names and many another loyal gentle- 
man’s shine still among the students and divines of Christ Church, 
as their armour shone on ceremonial occasions among the scarlet 
gownsmen in the stalls. 
There were other well-known academic figures in the seven- 
teenth century whom the traditions of the House recall. Pococke, 
a great Orientalist, Professor in turn of Arabic and Hebrew, was 
nominated to his Canonry in 1648 both by the King and by the 
Parliamentary Committee. The venerable fig-tree in the Hebrew 
Professor’s garden may be due to his wanderings in the East. 
Robert Sanderson held the Divinity Professorship so long as the 
victorious party would allow it during the difficult days of Civil 
War. Thomas Case, who won a Studentship in 1616, became a 
great preacher of the Parliament. Wood thought him a fire- 
brand, but Pepys a dull fellow with a “ presbyterian manner.” 
Peter French may have owed his Canonry to the fact that he 
had married a sister of Oliver Cromwell. Hammond, a very 
conspicuous Royalist, had received his Canonry from King 
Charles in 1645. He kept his place and carried on the govern- 
ment of the College after Samuel Fell’s imprisonment, till he too 
was imprisoned and deprived. Dolben and Allestree, “ returning 
poor and bare”’ with John Fell after years of exile, found their 
loyalty sufficiently rewarded. Dolben, an ardent soldier, proved 
a most successful Dean at Westminster. 
“Him of the western dome, whose weighty sense 
Flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence.” 1 
He was afterwards a high-minded and vigorous Archbishop of 
York. 
Allestree, like Dolben a soldier in the Royal army, was con- 
tented afterwards with a more tranquil career. A noted College 
Tutor first, he became Provost of Eton and Regius Professor of 
Divinity in Oxford. John Fell composed a biography of Allestree 
and of Hammond too. Philip Henry, who as a boy had played 
with the young Princes and had even been tipped by Laud in 
the Tower, was taught by Dr. Busby to care deeply for religion. 
But he found it impossible to conform to the requirements of 
the Church. Robert South, another of Busby’s pupils, and 
buried like his old master in Westminster Abbey, was a divine 
of less exacting views. He wrote a panegyric upon Cromwell in 
1654, but won Clarendon’s favour on the Restoration. He 
mocked at Cromwell later in a sermon, acted as chaplain to 
1 Absalom and Achitophel (Pt. I, ll. 868-9).

Rochester, stood by Dr. Sacheverell. He dared even to mock 
at the Royal Society. His ‘‘ graphic humour ” scandalized more 
serious minds. But South, it seems, was not wholly a self- 
seeker, for all the vicissitudes that he underwent. He was 
superior to William Jane, a much more pliant politician, whose 
defence of passive obedience, till subservient Toryism went out 
of fashion, was not forgotten when his opinions changed. 
Greater churchmen, Compton and Trelawney, were among 
the Bishops who withstood the tyranny of James. Compton 
had been an undergraduate of Queen’s and a graduate of Cam- 
bridge before he became a Canon of Christ Church. Trelawney’s 
glory cast its glow over his old College. John Locke’s expulsion 
reflected on its fame. Locke came up from Westminster in 
1652. He made a reputation as student and as teacher. He 
was Reader in Greek and in Rhetoric. In 1663 he was a 
Censor, and summoned to answer for sconcing one of the servants 
of the House. He and South joined in the Oxford productions 
published alike on Cromwell’s victories and on Charles II’s 
marriage. The Queen’s Royal lover, Locke wickedly suggested, 
found all the world too “ little for his heart.’’ Rumour said that 
Locke preferred romances to the Schoolmen. At any rate he 
avoided taking Orders, and after a brief experience of travelling 
and diplomacy he settled down in Oxford as a medical man. 
It was his knowledge of medicine which introduced him to Lord 
Ashley in the days before Ashley had lost the favour of the 
Court. After Shaftesbury’s fall that dangerous friendship was 
remembered, and the King ordered Locke’s dismissal from the 
College in 1684.2 When he returned with the Prince of Orange 
he refused to press for his reinstatement at Christ Church. But 
his College has long since atoned for its weakness and has hung 
his portrait in honour in the Hall. William of Orange himself 
was a visitor at Christ Church in 1670. His father-in-law was 
entered on the books after Edgehill, and reminded the dons of 
his seniority when he supped at the Deanery in 1687. Arlington 
represented the statesmen of the Restoration. Dudley Carleton, 
a much earlier diplomatist, had his share in the unhappy schemes 
of Buckingham. William Penn and the second Duke of Ormonde 
were conspicuous figures later. Atterbury, with his “rare

talent for fomenting discord,” was an active tutor in the College. 
The line of Christ Church worthies is not easily exhausted. The 
House stood high in reputation when the seventeenth century 
closed. 
Wolsey had planned to build the stateliest College ever seen 
in Oxford, and though his schemes foundered their grandeur 
survived. 
‘‘Non stabit illa domus, aliis fundata rapinis, 
Aut ruet aut alter raptor habebit eam.” 
So ran the prophecy, framed perhaps after the event. Henry’s 
rapacity justified the distich, but it was Wolsey, and not Henry, 
who stamped the College as his own. The arms of the Cardinal 
are still the arms of Christ Church. His devices—the Cardinal’s 
hat and the pillars set saltire-wise—still ornament its walls. 
His statue stands now over the main door. The Hall is typical 
of his magnificence. The lines of the great quadrangle are the 
lines he drew. The piers which surround it mark the prepara- 
tions for his cloister. The remnants of St. Frideswide’s Priory, 
which he embodied in his buildings, claim at any rate traditions 
of antiquity with which nothing else in Oxford can compare. 
Robert of Cricklade and, it may well be, Guimond before him, 
had laboured as Priors to build the Norman church. Its tower 
and nave, its choir and transepts, must have been standing in 
1180, when the bones of St. Frideswide were solemnly deposited 
there.2- But the Normans built on earlier foundations, and there 
is no reason for doubting that relics of more ancient Saxon days 
remain.? The spire, more than once rebuilt, claims to be one 
of the oldest in England. The beautiful Chapter House dates 
both Harleys and Montagus at Christ Church, but neither, I think, of 
these two famous Ministers. Charles Montagu was at Trinity, Cambridge. 
1 The two pillars were supposed to represent Wolsey’s authority as 
Cardinal and Legate. Maces, pole-axes and pastoral staves were other 
emblems which he used (Jd., App. A.). Note among these ornaments 
the fine console of Renaissance work under the oriel of the West front 
of the South bastion, which Mr. Vallance reproduces (Old Colleges of 
Oxford, 70). 
2 The Saint was laid first in the North choir aisle, and moved in 1289 
to a costlier shrine in the Lady Chapel. 
8 This, though once stoutly denied by high authorities, is now widely 
admitted. The explorations of Mr. J. Park Harrison and others have 
not only confirmed the view expressed by Dr. Ingram (Memorials, 1) 
that substantial portions of Athelred’s church of 1004 survive, but have 
established the existence of still older Saxon remains, which may well 
belong to the eighth century church built in the days of St. Frideswide 
and her father. See specially Mr. Harrison’s papers on the Discovery 
of the Remains of Three Apses at Oxford Cathedral, on Further Discoveries, 
on The Pre-Norman Date of the Design, and on A Pre-Norman Window 
(from 1887 onwards), and Mr. St. John Tyrwhitt’s summary (Colleges of 
Oxford, 321-2).

54 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
from the thirteenth century, but its fine Norman doorway is 
older. The Lady Chapel, where the Barbers’ Guild kept a light 
burning before the Virgin, also belongs to the thirteenth century. 
St. Frideswide found a new resting-place there. Monuments in 
the Lady Chapel recall a Prior and a warrior whom it would be 
rash to name,! and with more certainty Elizabeth Lady Monta- 
cute, a benefactress of the Black Prince’s day.2 The fourteenth 
century saw the Latin Chapel or Divinity Chapel with its fine 
glass added to the North. Other changes and additions enriched 
the old buildings—from Norman to Gothic, to Early English and 
Decorated work. Wolsey found the Cloister recently rebuilt and 
swept away part of it without compunction. He left the Refec- 
tory of the monks to become the Library of the College. He 
left, he may have finished, the beautiful vaulting of the Choir ; 
some would even make him responsible for its creation. But 
history has not yet decided, and possibly the Cardinal never 
finally decided, how far he intended to use or to preserve the 
ancient Minster, which seemed to him an inadequate Chapel for 
the splendid foundation he designed. 
The great quadrangle which the Founder planned, with its 
parapets and hieroglyphics, remained through the sixteenth 
century much as he left it, with three sides nearly finished and 
the fourth begun. On the North side the foundations of the 
  1 The Prior might possibly be Sutton. It is very doubtful if either 
monument represents Prior Guimond or Sir George Nowers. 
2 Wood says (City, II, 170) that she founded two chantries and gave 
46 acres of meadow ground. 
8 There is a puzzling statement attributed by Gutch (Collect. Cur. I, 
205) to a “ Journal Book of the Expences of all the Buildings ”’ of Christ 
Church, which speaks of payments ‘‘ for the making, carving, framing 
and garnishing the vault of the roof of the new Church of the said College ’’ ; 
and there is another reference to the framing and carving of the “ new 
vault” of the roof of the Choir. These entries, if accurate, can only 
tefer to St. Frideswide’s Church. But they might conceivably mean 
that Wolsey spent money on finishing or improving the roof of the Choir 
which had recently been renewed. There are some reasons for dating 
this roof from the 15th century, and we know that before the end of that 
century the Monastery, though much embarrassed, did spend money 
on its Church and buildings, and was apparently left money for the pur- 
pose. Wood (Colleges, 462), whom Ingram follows, and Mr. Thompson 
also (249-50) notice that Wolsey improved the old church and intended 
to preserve it. But one hesitates to think that, while pulling down one 
end of it, he spent profusely on re-roofing the other, which he did not 
intend to use for his Chapel. Sir G. Scott seems to have treated the date 
of the vaulting as an open question. 
« It measured 264 ft. x 261. I think it remained in that condition 
longer than Mr. Thompson (227) seems to suggest. Mr. Caréde (Wren 
and Tom Tower, 5, 8, etc.) definitely ascribes the extension Northwards 
of the St. Aldate’s fagade to Samuel Fell. Bereblock’s drawing shows 
Wolsey’s rich parapet, which Fell’s balustrade replaced.
-P-A-G-E-83
THE EARLY TUDOR COLLEGES 55 
magnificent Chapel were long visible. It was to have occupied 
nearly the whole length of the quadrangle and to have measured 
at its widest not much less than a hundred feet.1. Grass grew 
presently over these foundations. “Cattell and hogges” 
invaded the court. A century passed before the task of com- 
pleting it was undertaken, and the site of the unachieved Chapel 
filled in. But Dean Duppa and Samuel Fell repaired the build- 
ings of Peckwater and Canterbury, and gave a definite form to 
the Peckwater quadrangle, where, as early as 1600, some rooms 
for Gentlemen Commoners had been built.2- Brian Duppa did a 
great deal to alter the Cathedral—improving the music, moving 
the ancient stalls from the Choir, inserting panelling and screens 
and paving, displacing the monuments with little regard for 
their history, carrying away and sacrificing some of the old 
tombs. Even in Laud’s day inconvenient church memorials 
could be treated as “‘ old superfluous stuff.”” Duppa removed 
also some of the fine, old glass and altered the shape of the 
windows. But he filled them with new glass which included 
Van Linge’s fascinating picture of Jonah and his gourd. The 
Puritans, no doubt, disapproved of the Dean’s work. They 
took down ‘“‘the Orgaines.’’ Wood declares that one of the 
intended Canons “furiously stamped upon” some of the old 
glass. But the soldiers of the Parliament could not help admir- 
ing the “ painted idolatrous windows ”’ ; and the old glass now 
in the Latin Chapel, some in the South transept, and some of 
Abraham Van Linge’s has been preserved. The window given 
by Bishop King’s relations, with its well-known picture of Oseney 
Abbey, was taken down, but returned safely when King Charles 
came back. Samuel Fell, who succeeded Duppa, left a greater 
legacy behind him in the vaulted roof of the Hall staircase, 
one of the most beautiful pieces of seventeenth-century work. 
“‘Smith, an artificer of London ’’—that is all we know of the 
man who produced it—may at least ask posterity to register his » 
inconspicuous name. Samuel Fell also made the archway, 
“ Kill-Canon,” through his garden into Peckwater. He began to 
build on the North side of the great quadrangle, and he probably 
completed the West side on St. Aldate’s. But the Civil War 
suspended building operations. The Puritan Canons, it is 
alleged, chopped up the timbers of the new buildings for fire- 
wood. Wolsey’s court remained unfinished, and it was left for 
John Fell’s energy to carry through his father’s schemes.

ling’s paper (Oxf. Architect. Soc. Proceedings, N.S., IV, 111 sq.).

Fell began by gathering in subscriptions. Christ Church 
men formed a rich society, and it was a day of triumph for the 
Cavaliers. Money usually given for plate was devoted to the 
buildings. The King offered an Earl’s patent valued at a thou- 
sand pounds. Wren contributed his stately genius. Fell and 
the Christ Church Canons brought generous gifts themselves. 
The range of buildings on the North side was finished, Wood 
notes, in July 1662.1 The Dean, we are told, covered up the 
foundations of the Chapel with mould for the Canons’ gardens, 
and carted away the white chippings to make a White Walk 
in the meadow—a name corrupted possibly to Wide Walk, 
and so to Broad Walk in a later day. Lodgings for two Canons 
were provided here. A few years later, when fire destroyed the 
lodgings of the third stall—called the ‘‘ preebenda vivax ” because 
its holders lived so long *—another Canon’s house was built 
beyond Kill-Canon on the way to Peckwater. Over Kill-Canon, 
the archway in the North-East corner, Fell planned to make an 
observatory tower. Wolsey’s parapet was replaced by an 
Italian balustrade, destined to give place again to battlements 
later. A broad terrace was raised on steps against the walls. 
A great stone basin was erected in the centre. Canon Gardiner, 
Doctor in Divinity, presented a fountain of water, running 
through a rock and globe and pouring out of the mouth of a 
serpent. The Chapter promised to maintain it for ever, and 
replaced it with a statue of Mercury before the century was out. 
But John Fell’s work was not yet done. In 1669, when fire 
attacked the Chaplains’ quadrangle, he constructed a new block 
of buildings beyond the Cloister and bordering on the meadow. 
They bore his name for two centuries till newer buildings took 
their place. Above all, before the great Dean’s reign was over, 
Wren’s design for the Gateway Tower, finely effective, if wanting 
a little in fineness of detail, was carried through. Its vaulted 
roof was decorated with the shields of the subscribers, ‘ with 
great curiosity engraven in stone.’ Henry’s arms and Wolsey’s, 
Charles I’s and Charles II’s appeared in the centre. Great Tom, 
“Magnus Thomas Clusius Oxoniensis,”’ its sex and Protestantism 
vindicated, was brought down from the tower of the Cathedral 
and successfully recast. On the 29th May 1684, the anniversary 
of the Sovereign’s Restoration, it took up its duties again from 
1 On the outside at any rate (Wood, Life, I, 455). 
2 If we may follow Mr. Hurst (Oxford Topography, 48). The Walk 
with its 72 elms on each side was planted by Dean Fell (Thompson, 88). 
The foundations of Wolsey’s Chapel were only discovered in 1893. 
8 For the lodgings assigned to the Canons see Thompson (14-15). 
4 Wood (Colleges, 448) speaks of lodgings erected here by Philip King, 
Auditor of the College, about 1638, which were destroyed in the fire.

the Gateway Tower, and ever since, instead of singing Bim Bom 
in praise of St. Thomas,’ it has tolled its nightly message from 
Christ Church to the world. The Oseney bells remaining, 
“Hauteclere, Douce, Clement, Austyn, Marie, Gabriel et John,” ® 
were strengthened by others in Tom’s place. Increased to twelve 
in later days, and re-hung in the tower over the Hall Staircase, 
they still compose the famous Christ Church peal. 
The Kitchen of Christ Church, its Founder had determined, 
should be from the first equal to the needs of its members. But 
the Library of his great foundation was never till the eighteenth 
century worthy of its fame. Its first home was in the Refectory 
of the old Convent, above the Cloister which bounded the Chap- 
lains’ quadrangle, and Wood is probably justified in saying that 
before the seventeenth century it was “‘ in a very slender manner 
furnished with books.” Bishop James and Bishop King, how- 
ever, who had both been Deans of Christ Church, helped to 
improve it. ‘‘Mr. Otho Nicholson, one of the Examiners of the 
Chancery,” is credited with contributing eight hundred pounds. 
Robert Burton and other benefactors of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, including John Fell, added to its stores. And at last in 
the eighteenth century, on the other side of the College, a far 
more imposing Library was begun. But the record ofits treasures, 
which include Wolsey’s indubitable hat and one of the original 
copies of his best biography, belongs more properly toa later age. 
Meanwhile close beside the old Refectory two rooms, now 
rarely visited, were fitted up for the books bequeathed by 
Richard Allestree, John Fell’s lifelong friend. They included 
the volumes which Allestree had inherited from Dr. Hammond, 
and they were conveyed to the University of Oxford for the use 
of Divinity Professors in future. A fine Tudor Bible, bearing 
the arms of Queen Elizabeth, is among the little used volumes 
which this Library contains.? The Common Room, the “ new 
low room beneath the west end of the hall,” was designed by 
Dr. Busby in 1667. It was intended apparently for ‘‘ Mathe- 
1 The famous bell, over 7 ft. in diameter—Wood (City, II, 220) put 
it at 6—and weighing over 7 tons, was dedicated to St. Thomas of Canter- 
bury and bore originally the legend 
“in Thomae laude resono Bim Bom sine fraude.” 
Dedicated to Mary in days of reaction, it had been recast apparently 
both in 1612 and in 1654. (See Carée, Tom Tower, 67-8.) 
2 These old names gave place to more familiar ones, ‘‘ Mary and Jesus, 
Meribus and Lucas, New bell and Thomas, Conger and Goldeston ” (Wood, 
City, II, 220). Gutch’s Note to Wood’s Colleges (452) seems to make 
the number one less. As early as October 1680, Wood speaks of the ten 
bells being hung up “ and Tom reserved for the Tower on the great gate” 
(Life, II, 497). 8 See Thompson (241-3). ;

matick and Oriental lectures ” as well as for “‘ public fires ” and 
festivities for Masters and Students. The Common Room 
garden was made at the same time. The Hall, from the first 
the chief glory of the College, was little altered till the eighteenth 
century, when a fire destroyed the roof and the old louvre. But 
the later roof and woodwork seem to have reproduced the old 
design. Lights of the old glass remain in the West window, and 
among them the shields of four of Wolsey’s Sees. The “ noble- 
men’s oriel’”’ contains some other fragments. The woodwork 
repeats the badges and devices of Cardinal and King. Holbein’s 
pictures of Henry and of Wolsey hang side by side above the 
dais—the early buildings of Christ Church at the Cardinal’s side. 
Elizabeth is on the left hand of her father. Elizabethan Deans 
like Godwin and James are not far away. Brian Duppa and 
John Fell are there, with Busby and Locke and Penn and many 
another. And the noble portraits accumulated as generations 
have gone by bear some of the most splendid names in English 
history. The story of Christ Church may indeed be read upon 
its walls.? 
1 Archbishop Piers, with Dudley Carleton (Lord Dorchester), Arling- 
ton and others, is in the ante-hall. Archbishop Matthew is in the Old 
Lecture Room. Mr. Haverfield has an excellent Brief Guide to the Por- 
traits in Christ Church Hall. The Library pictures, which have a separate 
catalogue, were acquired later. 
2 The authorities for the College history have been already quoted. 
They have been largely used by Mr. Thompson, to whose little history I am 
greatly indebted. But I have to thank the Dean and Chapter for kindly 
allowing me to study those in the possession of the College, and in par- 
ticular Dr. Watson for access to documents in the Chapter House, the 
Treasurer for access to the deeds and charters in the Treasury, and the 
Librarian for leave to see certain exhibits in the Library. I wish also 
to thank Mr. S. G. Owen for his kind help. Among the most interesting 
documents are the Admission Books kept by the Dean; the early deeds 
and foundation charters kept in the Treasury, together with Fine-Books, 
account books, many volumes of Disbursements and Receipts, and other 
miscellaneous papers ; and the records kept in the Chapter House, which 
include not only the early Cartularies of St. Frideswide’s, of Oseney and 
of Eynsham, copies of foundation-charters, and the original Statutes of 
Cardinal College, but an early Register running from 1547 to 1619, the 
Register of Decrees, beginning in 1549 and ending in the days of Dean 
Duppa, the Sub-Dean’s Book, running from 1549 to 1646, with the most 
varied contents, and the Chapter Book from March 20, 1648 to Dec. 24, 
1688. The Chapter House documents also include, among others, an 
account of Wolsey’s plate, a thin volume of Royal Letters, etc—one 
from Oliver Cromwell, the Usurper, is not apparently thought worthy to 
be fastened in—Hutten’s Liber Successi Dec. Canon. Alumn., Gilpin’s 
book of notes and extracts, made by a Chapter Registrar of the eighteenth 
century, and a thin volume of disciplinary records, entries of fines or 
punishments, from about 1549 to about 1623. Full as these records are 
of names and elections, of rules for study, leave and conduct, and of all 
sorts of personal details, they do not throw much light on the general 
history of the times.

  CHAPTER XII 
THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION 
ITH the fall of Wolsey a new era dawned. The years 
W which followed were full of peril for the University 
to which he had proved so powerful a friend. There 
was a sharp significance for the clerks of Oxford in the measures 
of the memorable Parliament which met in November 1529, 
and which before it separated had launched the Reformation. 
The King, however mixed the motives which impelled him, was 
no longer concerned to prevent attacks upon the Church. The 
deep resentment which had been gathering for many genera- 
tions against clerical privilege and clerical abuses, against the 
oppression and venality of ecclesiastical courts, against the 
scandals too long tolerated in the lives and claims of churchmen, 
found at last the opportunity which it desired. And a Revolu- 
tion, cloaked in forms of law, swept over the whole field of faith 
and teaching, while it served only too well to secure the purposes 
of the Sovereign who loosed it and who used it as he pleased. 
From the meeting of Parliament events moved fast. In 
the session of 1529 Bills passed to forbid the levying of excessive 
fees by Church authorities, to enforce residence, to put pluralities 
down. Popular complaints rang with the great and “ import- 
able” charges to which clerical rapacity condemned the poor. 
Next year the Universities of Europe were pressed for their 
opinions on King Henry’s marriage and the Pope’s dispensing 
power. Reginald Pole at Paris was unwillingly induced to help. 
In 1531 the clergy were compelled to pay a heavy fine for having 
acknowledged Wolsey’s Legatine authority, and to give the King 
the title of Supreme Head of the Church. And in the years 
which followed, the Revolution swept ahead. Benefit of clergy 
was attacked. Annates! were conditionally abolished. More 
resigned. Warham died with a vain protest on his lips. Henry 
married Anne Boleyn, and the new Archbishop declared the 
1 The first year’s income of Bishoprics, which went to the Pope. 
Canon Dixon suggests (Hist. of the Church of England, I, 139, n.) that the 
proposal, which was conditional on the Pope’s not yielding, may have 
included the first-fruits of all benefices, which Henry ultimately claimed. 
Among the many Acts directed against the Church in England, some 
which had a special bearing on the Universities are noted in Mr. Shad- 
well’s Enactments in Parliament (O.H.S., vol. I).

-P-A-G-E-90
60 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
  King’s earlier marriage void. Parliament stopped tribute and 
appeals to Rome. A new law of heresy replaced the old one. 
The Act of Succession entailed the throne on Queen Anne’s 
issue, and Commissioners enforced compliance. The Nun of 
Kent was sent to the scaffold and More and Fisher to the Tower. 
The Act of Supremacy and the new Treason Act carried higher 
and higher the Crown’s autocracy. In 1535 Cromwell was made 
Vicar-General. A survey of Church property, the celebrated 
Valor Ecclesiasticus, was undertaken. The famous or infamous 
Visitation of the Monasteries began. The monks of the Charter- 
house, More, Fisher, many others, suffered with noble courage 
for their faith. In 1536 Henry summoned a new Parliament, 
which delivered the lesser Monasteries into his hands. Lincoln- 
shire and Yorkshire rose in rebellion. Henry turned to the 
Reformers for advice: and Ten Articles, based on the Creeds 
and on the Bible, expounded the first English Confession of 
Faith. It was “the study of his Majesty,” said Cromwell with 
fine irony, ‘‘ to set a quietness in the Church.” 
Changes so sweeping and dramatic must have filled the 
Universities with dismay. Fisher had been Chancellor of Cam- 
bridge, More High Steward both of Cambridge and of Oxford. 
Bocking, who died with the Nun of Kent, had been Warden of 
Canterbury College. No institutions depended more than the 
Universities upon the Church. None owed more to the special 
jurisdiction, the privileged immunities, which the clergy had 
secured. None had more to fear from an anti-clerical reaction. 
Yet in spite of grumblings Henry had his way. At Oxford the 
majority of members yielded, if reluctantly, to the King’s demands. 
They acquiesced in the Act against appeals to Rome, though the 
lawyers complained that it diminished their fees, and the Friars 
must have felt that it diminished their independence. They 
found preachers to preach against the Pope’s authority : 1 that 
had never been too popular in Oxford. In 1534 they affixed 
the University seal to the decision, which at Henry’s invitation 
thirty theologians appointed for the purpose had affirmed, that 
the Bishop of Rome had no greater jurisdiction in England than 
any other foreign Bishop. Wood speaks of ‘“‘a great deal of 
stir’ in the matter: but one wonders that the stir did not lead 
to more resistance, for in the Colleges dislike of the new policy 
must have been widespread. Some sufferers there may have 
been. But the University was not apt to show courage in 
1 “Some very boldly, others faintly, and a third part not at all” 
(Wood, Annals, II, 57). 
2 Wood says (Annals, II, 60) that ‘‘ Foundation men” who would 
not renounce the Pope were “‘ turned out of their Fellowships, Scholar- 
ships and Chaplainships.”” He mentions Hawarden, a Fellow of Brasenose,
-P-A-G-E-91
  
  THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION 61 
resisting Kings. The friends of the old order were depressed or 
overawed. The new Chancellor, nominated by Henry, Bishop 
Longland of Lincoln, was as ready as Wolsey or as Cromwell to 
carry out the requirements of the Crown. Though harsh to 
heretics? and little loved in many quarters, Longland was no 
bad friend to the University which had trained him, and in 
earlier days he had even won the title of a second Colet from Sir 
Thomas More. Dr. Tresham, who acted as Commissary for some 
fourteen years, was no friend to heretical doctrines, but he was 
equally obedient to the Royal will. The University authorities 
generally represented those in power. It may or may not be 
significant that their officers, the Proctors, were insulted by the 
townsmen and forced to carry arms in their walks abroad.? 
The new Vicar-General appointed Commissioners to visit 
the Universities and religious Houses, who were soon to acquire 
an unenviable fame. Cromwell never, we are told, “sent a 
slug on his errands,” and his most conspicuous agents, Layton 
and Leigh,? two lawyers trained at Cambridge, displayed an 
energy as ruthless as their chief’s. Leigh, described as a ruffling 
fellow of intolerable elation, eloquent in accusations and over- 
weening in conceit, was probably the harsher of the two in his 
methods. He carried matters with a high hand wherever he 
went. But at Cambridge, where Cromwell was now Chancellor, 
Leigh met with no resistance, and his action seems to have caused 
little alarm. The Visitation of Oxford was entrusted principally 
to Richard Layton, who, if sometimes less oppressive, was hardly 
less unscrupulous than Leigh. Reckless in his sweeping charges, 
pitifully obsequious in his attitude to Cromwell, Layton was 
equally ready to dismiss the Schoolmen as worthless and to 
condemn the whole monkish community as “ false, feigned, 
flattering, hypocritical knaves.’’ But Layton’s chief colleague 
at Oxford was far better known in the University than he. John 
London had been trained at Winchester, though that did not 
prevent him from bringing scandalous charges against the Founder 
of his old School. He had become a Fellow and Warden of 
New College. He had figured in the suppression of St. Frides- 
under the year 1534 as being summoned before the Council: the date 
when Hawarden was charged with not having deleted the Pope’s name 
from a College manual was Dec. 1538 (Brasenose Quat. Mon. IX, 171-2). 
But details are for the most part lacking, and resistance seems rarely 
to have been pushed to extremes, 
1 E.g. his severity to Oxford heretics in 1528, and the search for 
heretical books in Oxford bookshops which he ordered in 1531. 
2 But there are earlier precedents for allowing the Proctors to go armed.

  wide’s Priory. He was made Dean of the short-lived Bishopric 
at Oseney. He had taken an active part in putting down the 
early Protestants of Cardinal College. He was believed to be 
greedy, unscrupulous, immoral. There was talk of his doing 
penance for incontinence in Oxford. He was certainly no 
stranger to the pillory when he died. To Cranmer and the 
friends of the Reformation the “ stout and filthy Prebendary ” 
seemed an unblushing time-server.1 Under Cromwell London 
was determined to disavow all taint of Romanism. Under 
Gardiner he was ready to persecute Protestants afresh. But 
Gardiner’s encouragement carried him too far. Plotting against 
Cranmer, he met at last with the disgrace which he deserved.? 
Yet the Warden of New College had his better moments, and in 
dealing with “ towardly young men ” accused of heresy in Oxford 
he had sometimes shown a kindlier strain. 
Layton and London made short work of the Oxford Visita- 
tion. It has been suggested that they infused into the Univer- 
sity a new spirit of educational reform. They certainly showed 
no blind reverence for the old system. They poured contempt 
on the traditions of the Schools. They “set Dunce in Bocardo,” 
Layton boasted. They scattered the time-honoured manuscripts 
of medieval philosophy to the winds. A hunting man of Buck- 
inghamshire gathered up the leaves in New College quadrangle 
“to make hym sewelles or blawnsherres to kepe the dere within 
the woode.”? Others turned the pages of the Schoolmen to 
still baser uses. The Commissioners proved to be Vandals in 
the work of spoliation. They gave, says Wood, an ill report of 
learned men. But with these sharp measures schemes of im- 
provement mingled. The Royal Injunctions contemplated 
reforms. Old glosses and commentaries were to be discontinued. 
The study of the Bible was to replace the study of the Sentences. 
More modern methods of teaching were in favour, lectures in 
new subjects and the encouragement of Greek. 
These aims the Visitors prepared to carry out. They founded, 
we are told, a Greek Lecture at Merton and at Queen’s, and 
1 A view Wood shared. (See his Annals, II, 62.)

(Hist. of the Church, II, 330 sq.). 
3 I quote from Layton’s letter as given in Wright’s Suppression of 
the Monasteries (71). _Sewells were a form of scarecrow, to prevent deer from 
breaking ground. Mr. Froude quotes the passage (History, 1893, II, 315) ; 
but his spirited account of the Visitation is not always quite accurate. 
«The Injunctions which accompanied Cromwell’s appointment as 
Visitor at Cambridge in 1535 swept away all regulations which hindered 
“ polite learning,” and enjoined the reading of Aristotle, Rudolph Agri- 
cola and Melancthon in place of Scotus, Burleus and other Schoolmen.

  THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION 63 
Lectures in both Greek and Latin at New College and All Souls. 
Students from all Colleges alike had to attend them. Students 
of “ Physick ’’—the troubles in the Church had turned many 
clerks to Medicine—were required to be examined by the “‘ Phy- 
sick Professor’ before they began to practise for themselves.? 
New Lectures in Civil Law were established. The Canon Law 
was out of favour: it had too much regard for the authority 
of the Pope *: and after 1535 applications for degrees in Canon 
Law practically ceased.4 The Visitors also had rigorous regula- 
tions for monastic students. They forbade them to enter any 
inn or tavern, or any other house in town or suburbs, on pain 
of being immediately sent back to the cloister. Layton with a 
gross chuckle warned the Vicar-General that the women of the 
town would probably sue him for redress. He and his colleagues 
did not pretend to be impartial. All traditions which they ob- 
jected to must go. But the Royal policy towards the University, 
though rough and ill-considered, was not altogether wanting in 
liberality and good sense. 
Other important regulations followed. Parliament had 
granted to the King in 1534 the first-fruits and a yearly tenth of 
almost all the benefices in the country. The Act might have 
hit the Fellows of Colleges hard, and Cromwell was not deaf to 
the complaints which reached him. Early in 1536 the King 
decided to exempt the Universities from the new taxes. But 
in return he required the Colleges and Halls to contribute to the 
support of new Public Lecturers. 
1 Corpus had Lectures in Greek and Latin, and Magdalen one in 
Latin, already. 
2 Wood (Ann. II, 62). Warner, it seems, was Reader in Medicine— 
“ publicus praelector ’—in 1536, when Richard Smith was ‘“‘ praelector 
theologicae lectionis”” (see Reg. I, f. 1»; Trin. Coll. Dubl. MS. D, 2, 3; 
and Mun. Civ. Oxon. 249). He became Regius Professor in 1546, when 
the five Regius Professorships were endowed. His fees as Reader are 
put at XI in a MS. described in Messrs. Leighton’s Catalogue, Pt. I 
(New Series, No. 5), entitled Revenue of King Edward VI. 10 Dec. anno 6, 
which is apparently in the handwriting of Lord Darcy. A transcript of 
part of this MS., furnished by Messrs. Leighton to Mr. Gibson, has been 
passed on kindly tome. But I have not been able to trace similar entries 
at the Record Office. 
* Layton speaks of joining a Civil lecture ‘‘ in the place of the Canon 
lecture ” in every College, Hall and Inn (Wright, Suppression of Monas- 
tervies, 71). I take this to mean that it was substituted, not added as 
Wood suggests (Ann. II, 63). On the improved study of Civil Law, 
due to men like Alciati abroad and Thomas Smith at Cambridge, see 
Mullinger (Cambridge, II, 125 sq.). 
4 There were some half-dozen applications in 1535, and before that 
they were of course frequent. But in 1536 and the following years there 
were none. In 1555 there were four, in 1556 one only. After that they 
disappeared (Boase, Register, I, passim).

    64 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
“His Graces pleasure is that it be enacted by auctoritie of this 
present parliament that all the Colleges Houses and Halles corporate 
in eyther of the said Universities shall perpetuallye from hensforth, 
at theire owne propre costes and charges, fynde in everye of the 
said Universities one discrete and larned personnage to reade one 
opyn and publique lectour in every of the said Universities in any 
suche Science or tonge as the Kynges Majestie shall assigne or 
appoynte to be mooste profitable for the Studentes in either of the 
said Universities, every whiche lecture shalbe called perpetually 
Kyng Henry the eight his lecture.” 1 
The old idea of Regents gathering students round them in the 
Schools, and paid only by such fees as they collected, was yield- 
ing slowly to the new system of teachers endowed from College 
resources if not from public funds. At the same time the King’s 
attention was directed to the number of beneficed clergymen, 
young men no longer, who lived at Oxford and Cambridge on the 
pretext of study, but neglecting alike their studies and their 
cures, occupying quarters intended for scholars, passing their 
time in idleness and pleasure, and adding little to the University’s 
reputation or their own. Parliament had already attacked the 
clergy for not residing on their livings. It now required these 
belated students to return, if over forty years of age, to their 
duties.2. Those under forty might remain, but only on condition 
that they attended the disputations of the Schools. Tithes were 
not given, the Reformers reminded them, to be spent at Courts 
or Universities or in keeping hawks and hounds. Further in- 
junctions called upon clergymen holding preferments worth a 
hundred pounds a year to support scholars at Oxford or Cam- 
bridge,? a practice which even the Monasteries had found it 
difficult to maintain. And while these sharp if salutary changes 
were troubling the tranquillity of Oxford, the great re-valuation 
of ecclesiastical property was going on, and College Bursars, no 
doubt, were gloomily forecasting the effects of such an inquisi- 
tion upon the ever-growing acquisitiveness of the Crown.‘ 
But if the Universities were anxious, the Monasteries which 
1 I quote from Mr. Gibson’s proofs (Statuta Antiqua, 337-8). See 
also Shadwell (Enactments, O.H.S., I, 115). Mr. Gibson gives (339-40) 
the decree of the Great Congregation, dated Dec. 12, 1536, apportioning 
the payments to be made by the Colleges. For one Praelector a salary 
of 20 marks was allowed. See also Wood (Amn. II, 64-5 and 840-1). 
Wood speaks of Henry founding five Lectures in 1540, which were ‘“‘ not 
settled or confirmed ”’ till 1546. 2 Shadwell (I, 120-2). 
3 One for each {100 of revenue. It seems doubtful if this had much 
result. Dr. Rashdall, quoting the order from Wood, dates it 1535 (Uni- 
versities, II, 658, n.). But Wood (Ann. II, 66) gives it under 1536, 
and so do Foxe (Acts and Monuments, ed. Pratt, V, 168) and Wilkins 
(Concilia, III, 814-5). 
* The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 was the only complete survey of 
Church property that had been made since the Tawatio of Pope Nicholas 
IV in the days of Edward I.
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION 65 
still sent their students to Colleges at Oxford, to Gloucester and 
Canterbury, to St. Mary’s and St. Bernard’s, had even graver 
reasons for alarm. The story of the Dissolution has never failed 
to waken sympathy. If King Henry’s agents blackened the fame 
of the monks, they helped also to make them pitied and beloved. 
The darker shadows in the picture are forgotten. The spell of 
faith, the beauty of antiquity, the appeal of suffering sometimes 
nobly borne, remain. And beyond doubt the Monasteries were 
tyrannously used. It is not hard to discredit Cromwell’s Com- 
missioners. Their worst accusations cannot in these days be 
substantiated, and it must always be a matter of uncertainty 
how far they could have been substantiated at the time. The 
Act which gave the smaller Houses to the King in the grandiose 
style of Tudor Statutes contained sweeping charges of abominable 
living. But it was admitted that in many venerable abbeys 
religion was still nobly kept. If there were “‘ great and fat 
abbots ” who lived in luxurious sloth, there were abbots at Read- 
ing and Colchester and Glastonbury who could die sooner than 
betray their trust. If there were ‘‘ hooded hypocrites’? who 
traded on credulity,1 there were still thousands of Englishmen 
to whom relics and miracles were holy things. If there were 
Houses which neglected their duties, mismanaged their property 
and misused their wealth,* there were still some which were — 
popular and kindly landlords, places of hospitality, of alms, and 
to some extent of education. But the whole system had un- 
doubtedly decayed. Public opinion had long condemned it. 
Morton and Wolsey were no reckless iconoclasts. Colet and 
Erasmus were no solitary critics. It was not in England only, but 
all over Europe, that men who cared deeply for knowledge and re- 
ligion were determined to have done with the methods of the monks. 
If there was to be a breach with the Papacy, it was clear that the 
Monasteries could not stand. They became inevitably strongholds 
of opposition to the policy of the King. They were inherently 
reactionary and bigoted in the view of all who hoped for ecclesias- 
ticalreform. ‘Their fall was madea pretext for extortion. But it 
was better for human freedom that they should cease to exist.? 
1 Mr. Froude quotes Bishop Shaxton’s outburst against the “‘ stinking 
boots, mucky combes,.. . . filthy rags, gobbets of wood,” and other 
unsavoury relics in the diocese of Salisbury (History, 1893, I, 567-8). 
* Critics complained that the monks turned to trade, or like other 
landlords gave up their lands to pasturage. But there is little doubt 
that a good deal of monastic property was burdened with debt, and 
impoverished by the claims of the Crown and of the nobles (Gasquet, 
Henry VIII and the English Monasteries, 7-9). 
8 Canon Dixon estimates that only 600 or 700 houses of monks or 
friars survived at the date of the Dissolution out of some 900 founded 
since the Conquest. Only about 8 new ones were established after the 
end of the 14th century (Church Hist, I, 319-20 and 322).

  66 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
To Oxford the Dissolution brought great changes, though it 
affected the University less than has sometimes been supposed. 
Monastic lands encircled her. Monastic associations had hung 
round her since her birth. St. Frideswide’s was far older than 
either University or town. Oseney and Rewley amid their 
“ chinking rivuletts ’’ beyond the Castle had watched generation 
after generation passing through the Schools. Abingdon, 
founded in the seventh century by West Saxon Kings, had claims 
of antiquity and splendour which none of the Abbeys of Oxford 
could dispute. Littlemore lay nearer, with its woods and walks 
and its “ devout recesses.”” Eynsham commanded the upper 
reaches of the river. There were Abbeys at Thame and at 
Dorchester, Priories at Studley and at Sandford, where once the 
Templars had owned lands. The Godstow nuns had ties and 
property both inside and outside the town walls. They took in 
young gentlewomen for training. Fair Rosamund had lived her 
scandal down. Forgiven by “ the saints in heaven ’’—a miracle 
had proved it—she need feel no shame in the ballads which 
recalled her or in the crosses built by her Royal lover to mark 
her passage to the tomb. 
Two of these ancient Houses, St. Frideswide’s and Littlemore, 
had already gone to endow Cardinal College. Abingdon for 
all its wealth had fallen upon evil days. Its great revenues were 
embarrassed. Its monks were alleged to have sunk into sloth. 
But Cromwell thought it worth while to spend six hundred pounds 
“on bringing about ”’ its surrender—an ominous item in an ill- 
omened scheme. Abbot Pentecost made little difficulty. A large 
pension and the manor of Cumnor are said to have rewarded his 
tact. A great part of the Abbey was marked for destruction. 
Its treasures went to the King. Rewley was less venerable but 
much nearer Oxford. Its Founder had intended it for Cistercian 
students. But it had failed to satisfy the needs of the Order, 
and in the fifteenth century St. Bernard’s College had been 
required. At the Dissolution there was apparently some talk of 
converting the House into a College, and the Abbot wrote with 
pitiful humility to Cromwell, in whom “all my refuge, helpe, 
1It is impossible, I think, to accept Mr. Mullinger’s view (Cam- 
bridge, II, 28-32) that there were many monks in Oxford beside those 
in the monastic Colleges, and that the Dissolution affected numbers 
at Oxford and Cambridge hardly less than a wholesale diversion of 
Public School boys would to-day. The number of Oxford students 
from the Monasteries was never very large, and the number of appli- 
cations by Regulars for degrees was, as the Register shows, compara- 
tively small. 
2 In Wood’s day Littlemore belonged to John Powell of Sandford, 
whose ancestor apparently bought it (Life, I, 404). Hearne speaks of 
buildings standing there in 1710 (Collections, O.H.S., III, 2).
-P-A-G-E-97

and socor is.” 1 The site passed before long to Christ Church, 
but in the interval others shared in the spoils.2. Stones and tim- 
bers from Rewley are said to have been used in the Lady Chapel 
of St. Mary Magdalen’s Church. But a good deal of the Monas- 
tery was left standing amid its pleasant walks and fish-ponds. 
Wood noted long afterwards inscriptions in the windows, a 
shorn monk kneeling, ancient arms over the gateway, and other 
relics which the soldiers of the Civil War had spared. 
Oseney, a more celebrated Abbey, was at first reserved for 
nobler uses. Its fabric, seen across the water-meadows, was 
one of the glories of Oxford. Its history was closely interwoven 
with the University’s. Its claims of jurisdiction were a matter 
of conflict between Abbot and Vice-Chancellor almost to the 
last.3 The traveller, leaving the town by ‘“ Book-binders’ 
Bridge” passed by a broad paved footway through the little gate 
to the great gate of the Abbey. Here alms were waiting for 
pilgrims and the poor, and here the janitor kept watch upon 
suspicious persons and on young canons or young women wander- 
ing to and fro. Beyond this gateway were court and cloister, 
a large and curious refectory and an ample kitchen. Wood 
dwells lovingly if not always exactly on the great range of build- 
ings, the infirmary and dormitory, the fine lodgings of the Abbot 
and the Canons, the mills and tannery beside the river, the 
orchards, arbours, dove-houses and fish-ponds®: ‘‘ whatsoever 
heart could wish these monks did enjoy.” The Monastery kept 
a large staff of workmen: it was with one of the Oseney car- 
penters that Chaucer’s poor scholar lodged. Its main quad- 
rangle may have been nearly as large as that of Cardinal College. 
But its chief pride was its Church. Foreigners came from over 
seas to wonder at the workmanship, to note the pinnacled but- 
2 Wright (Suppression, 73). 
2 Ogle prints (Royal Letters, 149 sq.) the grant of Nov. 22, 1541, of 
Wolvercote, Walton, Godstow and Rewley to Dr. George Owen, one of 
the King’s physicians. Owen seems to have made a considerable profit 
out of monastic lands round Oxford, and held for a time both manors 
of Walton, one of which had belonged to Godstow and the other to Oseney. 
(See also Wood, City, II, 303-4.) 
8 In 1531 there was a fight between one of the Proctors and the Abbey 
servants, and the Commissary tried to punish the offenders, whom the 
Abbot refused to give up (Wood, Annals, II, 51-2). 
« This is Wood’s statement (City, II, 202). 
* The principal buildings dated from the 13th century and owed 
much to Abbot Leech. For details of them see Hurst (Oxford Topography, 
92-4 and App. F.). Mr. Hurst criticises Wood’s account and Agas’ 
drawing, and places Oseney third among English abbeys for the splendour 
of its buildings. But his account should be checked by Mr. Goldie’s 
Bygone Oxford and by Mr. H. W. Brewer's article on Mediawval Oxford 
in The Builder for Jan. 3, 1891. Oseney had land and tithes in Hoke- 
norton or Hook Norton, whence, no doubt, the Abbot of that name came,

tresses, the stately towers, the exquisite variety of the windows, 
the dim light shining through painted Abbots, Saints and Kings, 
the carvings and statues, the altars and relics, ‘‘ more than ordin- 
ary excelling’ the splendour of a famous shrine. The ring of 
bells in the Western campanile, increased by Abbot Leech from 
three to seven, and re-named with homelier names before the 
Dissolution, out-sang all the bells of Oxford, if not all the bells of 
England as their partisans declared. 
“Campanis coenobii de Osneya nullae in Anglia meliores putantur.’’? 
Thomas of Oseney was reputed as big as Edward bell at West- 
minster or Dunstan bell at Canterbury. It was yet to see some 
strange vicissitudes before Dean Fell hung it in Wren’s famous 
tower. 
At the Dissolution Oseney had at first some hope of avoiding 
plunder. It was assigned to the new Bishopric. The last 
Abbot, King, became the first Bishop. But the translation of 
the Chapter to Christ Church meant the destruction of the Abbey. 
The roof of the church, the lead, the stalls, the bells, the battle- 
ments, were before long carried away. Loads of stone were 
carted off for the ‘‘ wall at Frideswide’s.” Yet Mass, it is said, 
was performed at Oseney in Queen Mary’s reign. For some time 
at any rate the great structure resisted the spoiler. The Cathe- 
dral window put up to Bishop King shows the West tower still 
intact and the South door “ exceeding strong and lively.” But 
the process of ruin had begun. The Civil War increased the 
havoc. The temptation to quarry in the buildings was too 
strong to resist. In 1718, we are told, the site was ploughed 
up. In 1771 only an arched window in an outhouse remained.® 
The nuns of Godstow sought no share in Oxford education. 
That was left for the wiser virgins of a later generation to achieve. 
But the Convent in the golden meadows by the falling waters 
of the river must have been as well-known to Oxford students 
as the ruins which recall it are to-day. It fell to Dr. London, 
the Warden of New College, to demand the surrender of the 
House, and if the Abbess’ tale is to be trusted the episode shows 
him at his worst.4 But though the Abbess defied the Warden, 
with his “great rout,” his blustering and his wheedling, the 
pressure put on her prevailed. She made no claim to martyrdom.

historian.”

at the Record Office.

« Yet London pleaded with Cromwell for the Abbess and the nuns 
(Wright, Suppression, 228). See also Gasquet (Henry VIII and Monas- 
teries, 171-2 and 305-6—where surely there is an error in date).

She was not unwilling to temporise with Cromwell. ‘‘ Neither 
pope nor purgatory, image nor pilgrimage,” she assured him, 
was much regarded by the nuns. Perhaps she hoped that 
compliance would savethem. But a little later she surrendered 
the House with its income of two hundred and seventy-four 
pounds a year. Dr. George Owen, the fortunate physician, 
obtained possession of the Convent grounds. The Church tower 
with its lovely stone-work survived far into the eighteenth 
century. Fair Rosamund may still be sleeping under a ruined 
chapel floor. 
The redoubtable Warden of New College was more successful 
elsewhere. At Eynsham, just across the hill from Godstow, 
an even older Abbey sheltered a community of Benedictine 
monks, who had watched the University from its beginnings 
and seen it take possession of the town. London perhaps 
cared little for their history, but he secured their large revenues 
without delay. Their Abbot passed on to a Bishopric. Their 
buildings slowly fell to pieces. But Wood in 1657 could still 
see and sketch the great West window and the “ very spacious 
towers.” ?. With the farmers of the Monastery, we are told, 
Dr. London did his best.2 But neither monk nor nun was left 
in those tranquil river reaches, no bells to break the stillness, 
no chants to mingle with the music of the weir. London moved 
on. His energies redoubled. In the last half of 1539 he is 
credited with dissolving twenty-two religious houses in the 
Midlands and the South. Some were miserably poor, and 
London was probably right in his conjecture that not a few of 
their occupants were glad to be set free. But in the work of 
spoliation, defacing buildings, stripping roofs, destroying windows, 
the Warden of a venerable Oxford College unhappily excelled. 
At Winchester he and his colleagues put an end to King Alfred’s 
two foundations, and to the great house of St. Swithin’s, for 
whose monks Fox had originally intended his College. Christ 
Church Priory, which Flambard had established, Amesbury 
Nunnery with its dim traditions of Guinevere, Winchcombe with 
its old Oxford associations,* St. Peter’s, Gloucester, the parent 
house of Gloucester College, suffered the same fate. The move- 
ment spread rapidly. One after another, with short shrift

into Lord Derby’s possession,

“ Winchcombe was prominent among the Benedictine houses repre- 
sented in Gloucester College. Wood notes a privilege granted to the 
Benedictines at the Abbot’s instance as late as 1521 (Annals, II, 20-1).

  7o A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
and on various pretexts, all the greater monasteries were swept 
into the royal net. The stateliest Houses of the North, Durham 
with its magnificent endowments, also the parent of an Oxford 
College—where St. Cuthbert himself, unchanged in death, dumbly 
rebuked the despoiler of his shrine York and Whitby, Furness 
and Fountains, yielded up their long-accumulated treasures. 
Evesham, Leicester, Woburn surrendered in the Midlands, and 
St. Edmundsbury, “like a great city with its brazen gates and 
towers.’’ North and South, East and West, the same ruthless 
policy prevailed. Reading was struck down by the attainder 
of its Abbot, and Dr. London worked his will on its remains. 
Westminster fell, the superb bequest of the Confessor, and 
Canterbury, the richest shrine in Christendom, the mother of 
an Oxford College, the mother church and monastery of the 
land. 
The wealth of the monks was, no doubt, exaggerated by 
rumour, and it is not altogether easy to estimate to-day. One 
reasonable valuation has put it in modern money at some fifty 
millions sterling. A large annual revenue became available, 
though most of it never reached the Royal coffers.2 A stream 
of spoil, of plate, of vestments and of jewels, treasures of gold 
and ivory and silver, invaluable manuscripts, lead only too 
easily valued from roofs and bells and pipes, poured into the 
newly-created Court of the Augmentation of the revenue of the 
King’s Crown. The monastic libraries were recklessly dispersed. 
They went, says Bale, to book-binders and soap-sellers and 
grocers, some to scour candlesticks, some to rub boots. “‘ Yea, 
the vnyuersytees of thys realme, are not all clere in this detest- 
able fact.” There were large grants of course to fortunate 
courtiers, Howards sharing as readily as Seymours, and Dudleys, 
Russells, Pagets, Cromwells, and many another joining in. There 
1 His body was found fresh and entire. His eyes, composed of mineral 
matter, alarmed but did not deter the intruders (Dixon, Church Hist. 
II, 150). 
® Cardinal Gasquet puts the monastic revenues at some {£200,000 
(in Tudor money) ; Speed’s tables, based on the Valor Ecclesiasticus, 
make them less. But in the eleven years following September 1536, 
only £415,000 in rents seems to have reached the Court of Augmentation, 
and in no year did more than £45,000 come in from monastic lands as 
revenue. Sales of lands, woods, plate and buildings of course brought 
in more. It seems that in Henry’s lifetime some fifteen millions (in 
modern money) may have reached the Court of Augmentation, apart 
from jewels and some other perquisites. But the figures are uncertain. 
See Gasquet (Henry VIII and Monasteries, 397 sq., and Appendix), Dixon 
(Church Hist. I, 249 and 324), Blunt (Hist. of Reformation, 1514-1547,

  THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION 71 
were tales of church bells staked across the gaming table, of 
abbey lands squandered on parasites and cooks. The Universi- 
ties inevitably hankered after goods so easily bestowed.. At 
Cambridge Queens’ College petitioned at once for the Carmelite 
Friary beside it. ‘Poverty,’ pleaded Ascham, “casts aside 
shame.” And at Cambridge there rose on the ruins of the old 
home of the Franciscans the noblest College which any University 
had seen, If Oxford showed less forwardness in begging, it 
could not have been insensible to the chances offered. Cox, the 
first Dean of Christ Church, wrote to Secretary Paget, in the 
year in which Trinity was founded, suggesting some endowment 
of the University, “ which is poore and hath scant 5! by the 
yeare,”’+ This was all the more intolerable as Cambridge had 
“ fortie or fiftie ’ pounds to boast of. But there were too many 
“importunate wolves ” waiting to devour the plunder. There 
were only too many uses to be found for the possessions which, 
as another academic spokesman put it, “the remnant of the 
Pharisees and false philosophers ” had too long enjoyed.? 
Still a good deal of the monastic wealth was better spent. 
Much of it went to public objects, to forts and ships and national 
defence. Some was allotted to new Bishoprics, to charities for 
the aged and the poor. Some was intended for the advance of 
education, for bringing up children in learning, for nourishing 
clerks in the Universities, for endowing Readers of Hebrew, 
Greek and Latin. But Henry’s grandiose designs too often 
found a meagre application. At Oxford indeed five Regius 
Professorships, in Theology and Medicine, in Civil Law, in Hebrew 
and in Greek, were endowed in 1546.3 But of the new Sees 
suggested only six took shape. Oxford, separated at last from 
Lincoln, became the centre of a smaller diocese. The revenues 
of Oseney were assigned to new uses, and the establishment of 
the Dean and Chapter at Christ Church finally fixed the home 
of the new See. 
The fate of the great Monasteries at Gloucester, Durham and 
Canterbury had a painful significance for the Colleges which 
bore their names. Gloucester College had opened its doors for 
many generations to students from Abingdon, Westminster, St. 
Albans, from all the great Benedictine Abbeys of the South. 
But of the details of its suppression we know little, except that 
it was let for a time to private persons, and that its “ edifices, 
chambers, walks and gardens ”’ were valued at a rental of twenty-

3 In the Edwardian Code we hear also of Lecturerships in Philosophy, 
Mathematics and Dialectics, which were apparently contemplated but 
not endowed. Cambridge had a better provision for some of these sub- 
jects.

six shillings and eightpence a year.1_ The Chapel and Library, 
it seems, were demolished, but most of the old buildings were 
left.. When the new See was created, they became for a time 
the home or at any rate the property of the Bishop.? But Sir 
Thomas White, the Founder of St. John’s, secured them early 
in Elizabeth’s reign, and established a new Hall for students in 
connection with his College. And though the Bishops of Oxford 
disputed his rights, and one of them as late as 1604 forced an 
entrance by night and by water, and drove away the horses 
pasturing on the land, Gloucester Hall remained the property 
of St. John’s. 
Durham College was involved in the fate of the great Northern 
Abbey it belonged to. Its revenues just before the Dissolution 
were a hundred and twenty-two pounds a year.4 The new Chap- 
ter of Durham absorbed its estates, but in 1545 the site and 
buildings were surrendered to the Crown.5 A Hall for Students 
was for a time established, under the government of Dr. Wright : 
“Durham and S. Bernard’s College laid void, and were kept for 
Dr. Wryght’s and Dr. Kennall’s Bachelaurs, called by the waggish 
Scholars of these times, ‘The two Kennells of Hounds and Gray- 
hounds.’ ’’ ¢ 
But in 1555 Sir Thomas Pope procured the property? and made it 
the home of Trinity College. The Canterbury monks in Oxford 
also shared the fate of their neighbours, when after long prelimin- 
aries the great Priory of Christ Church, Canterbury fell. The

John James as the first lessees. But Edmund Powell of Sandford seems 
to have had his share. The annual value of the Gloucester lands was 
put at 60s. in 1560. (See Worcester College, 89-91.) Elizabeth made a 
fresh grant of the property in that year; but there seem to have been 
conflicting claims.

(Plummer’s Elizabethan Oxford, 86) is of course still standing near Folly

site and buildings, valued by Wood at sixteen pounds and eight- 
pence yearly, passed before long to the new House of Christ 
Church at their side, and the old monkish buildings were used 
by the new College till a later generation swept them away. 
The displaced students of the monastic Colleges prepared to 
“trudge a begging,” with wallets on their backs. There was 
no place for them in the new dispensation, and some at least 
must have been harshly “turned out into the wide world.” 
Of the younger Colleges reserved for cloister students, St. 
Bernard’s was still comparatively recent. Its Hall dated only 
from the sixteenth century. Its Chapel was not consecrated 
till the year when Wolsey died. Valued or under-valued at 
twenty shillings annually,? the property was granted by the 
King to Christ Church in 1546. But for some time students 
continued to be housed there,? and Dr. Kennall as Principal won 
his meed of fame. In Queen Mary’s day the property was sold 
by Christ Church to Sir Thomas White, a wealthy citizen of 
London, who had played an important part as Lord Mayor in 
the new reign. Its later history is the history of St. John’s. 
St. Mary’s, when destroyed as a monastic College, passed first 
to private owners. Its buildings, escaping serious injury, served 
for a time as a Hall for students. Wood names two of its Prin- 
cipals. Twyne gives the names of some of its scholars. Under 
Queen Mary, we are told,' John Fetteplace gave it to the Univer- 
sity, and there was a question whether it should be let for students 
or handed over to Regular Canons again. A few years later it 
was in the hands of the city, and was used in turn as a Bridewell, 
analmshouse andaschool.5 But in 1580 the Earl of Huntingdon, 
its then owner, conveyed it to Brasenose College, and it is on 
Brasenose that the responsibility for destroying the Chapel where 
Erasmus may have worshipped rests. St. George’s College in 
the Castle was so poor before the Dissolution that its Fellows, 
says Wood, were “ objects of pitty being reduced but to three.” ®

the very low figures given for Gloucester College and St. Bernard’s. Wood 
speaks of a lease of the site to Richard Master in 1544. But the sur-

    74 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
If this account be accurate, the Dissolution only completed its 
tuin. The buildings became finally “a den of theeves and 
robbers,” in other words the county jail. 
More significant for the University than the destruction of 
the monastic Colleges was the disappearance of the Friars. St. 
Bernard’s and St. Mary’s had little history behind them. The 
students of Gloucester, Durham and Canterbury had hardly ever 
taken the lead in academic life. But the influence of the Friars 
had been profound. No group of men had done so much to 
quicken the soul of medizval Oxford, to stir its Schools and its 
contentions, to open to it new domains of thought. It is true 
that the tireless energies of Grosseteste and of Bacon, of Duns 
and Ockham were long dead. The New Learning looked to 
other leaders.2- But the Franciscans and Dominicans still served 
and studied in their island settlements among the poor. The 
Carmelites still kept their Royal house at Beaumont. The 
Augustinians still taught the Bachelors to debate. The Friars 
and monks were not necessarily in sympathy. Certain aspects 
of the Reformation left the Mendicant Orders undismayed. But 
Henry’s policy soon raised their scruples. The Franciscan 
Observants took the lead in resistance. As the Revolution 
swept on, the Friars found themselves inevitably upon the losing 
side. Richard Ingworth, Bishop of Dover and a former Domini- 
can Prior, was appointed to “‘ visit and vex ”’ his brother Friars. 
And in 1538 the Warden of New College, with the help of the 
Mayor and master aldermen of Oxford, began to deal with the 
ancient Friaries about the city. 
The Carmelites came first. The Augustinians, Franciscans 
and Dominicans followed. But all four Orders were made in 
London’s phrase to change their coats, and the ease with which 
their surrender was effected is probably evidence of their decay. 
Foreseeing the storm, they had already begun to dispose of 
their possessions, to sell annuities, to cut down timber, to get 
tid of their plate. For the Carmelites London seems to have 
had a form of surrender ready-made.* But apart from their 
1 And, it may be said, to encourage the representative idea in Church 
and State. (See Dr. E, Barker’s interesting essay on The Dominican 
Ordey and Convocation). Among recent books Father Jarrett’s study of 
The English Dominicans has done justice to their work at Oxford. (See 
especially Chap. IV.) 
2 But there were friends of the New Learning, if not very many, 
among the Friars. (See Little, Grey Friars, 113.) Card. Gasquet (Hen. 
VIII and Monasteries, 311) estimates the English Friaries in the 16th 
century at about 200—approximately 60 Franciscan, 53 Dominican, 42 
Augustinian and 36 Carmelite, 
8 Gairdner (Letters and Papers, XIII, 1, p. 497). See also Gasquet 
(325-7), and, for London’s dealings with the Friars elsewhere, Dixon (II, 
45-6).

land and their vestments he did not think their possessions 
worth five pounds. Their lands passed to private owners.1 
Their library was scattered: they had cared about their books.? 
Their students, among whom Reginald Pole had been included, 
were dispersed. Their stately refectory, where Kings had once 
kept Christmas, became a “receptacle ’’ for the poor of the 
parish. Stones from Coeur de Lion’s Palace are said to have 
found their way to St. John’s College.* Bones from the Friars’ 
graveyard were dug up long afterwards at the end of Beaumont 
Street. Of the buildings which had been the home of the 
Plantagenets only a stable or cow-house in Wood’s time re- 
mained. 
The Austin Friars were still famous in Oxford, though the 
number of the brethren was probably small. Their time-honoured 
disputations were a part of the University system.4 But their 
prosperity had declined. Their property was in such disrepair, 
London reported, that, if they did not leave their houses, their 
houses would very soon leave them. The Convent outside Smith 
Gate, even the great church, may have been falling into ruin. 
Its jewels had already been thoughtfully disposed of, and its 
surrender was procured without much trouble. The Bachelors’ 
disputations were removed to St. Mary’s, to pass on many years 
later to the new School of Natural Philosophy, where by the 
ancient and incongruous name of “ Disputations in Austins ” 
they were observed for many generations more. But the old 
home of the Augustinians, farmed out at first for some sixty 
shillings a year, passed quickly from owner to owner, and each, 
no doubt, made his profit of the spoils. At last the City of 
Oxford secured it. The site was conveyed to Nicholas Wadham. 
A new College, singularly perfect in its proportions, rose upon 
the spot. And the ghosts of the Friars, content with this memo- 
tial, have ceased to haunt the groves they loved. 
The Oxford Franciscans also, with their eighteen members, 
made little difficulty about their dissolution. They, like the

in monastic lands.

ciscans, “far more free from dust and wormes”’ (City, II, 429).

venture to take their questions and dispute with them, it came to be a 
custome, then an injunction, and at last a statute . . . that noe Bache-

or could answer these Augustin Fryers ’’ (Wood, City, II, 465).

rest, were at the Royal mercy. Their Warden, Dr. Baskerfeld,* 
a well-known figure in the University, seems to have given the 
authorities all the help he could. The Order had property worth 
taking, a great house, a fair orchard, “ praty gardens.” But 
the buildings, it seems, were in ruinous disrepair. Their plate 
was most of it pawned. Their leaden pipes had already gone 
into the melting-pot. Many of their trees were blown down. 
Their roofs were nothing but slate. Their library even was 
neglected. ‘ Great Jove, what did I find there!” cries Leland : 
books not worth three farthings, spiders, dust and dirt. Wood 
breaks out against the “rude and ignorant asses”? who had 
nailed down books of science for fear of the magic they contained. 
But Thomas Allen of Gloucester Hall found volumes worth 
attention and secured for his own library such prizes as he could. 
The Dominicans lay a little further South among the marshes. 
Their old influence had long departed. Their early traditions of 
learning, the memories of Robert Bacon, of Kilwardby, of Trevet, 
had long passed away.? But they still had plunder to offer to 
the spoiler. “The Black friars hath in their backside,” London 
writes to Cromwell, “ divers ilands, well wooded. There be but 
ten friars, being priests, besides the Anker.’’? The fine church, 
which had housed the Mad Parliament and given burial to Piers 
Gaveston, had a choir covered with lead. The plate was worth 
attention, especially a great gold chalice set with jewels. There 
were profits to be made from the groves and buildings, the 
cloister and the school. The Mayor and aldermen who acted 
with London—Frere or Freer was among them—received a share 
of the pickings. The Warden of New College urged their claims. 
He addressed also an interesting letter to Cromwell, urging that 
the grounds of the Oxford Friars, when the King had taken toll 
of their buildings, trees and treasures, should be conferred upon 
the town. But other and richer tenants were forthcoming, 
larger speculators in monastic lands.4 The property of the two 
Orders changed hands often. The timber was cut, the towers 
thrown down, the stones and images scattered, the greens trodden 
3 Wood calls him Baskervyle (City, II, 389). Mr. Little, whose 
chapter on the Dissolution (Grey Friars, Chap. VIII) is full of information, 
gives several spellings. Baskerfeld joined London in visiting Friaries 
elsewhere,

absorbed or disappeared.

under foot.1_ The ruins became a quarry for the city builders. 
Tanners settled there. Diggers from time to time found monu- 
ments and treasures—once a leaden coffin containing a man’s 
heart. But all these relics were soon swept into oblivion, 
with the long tale of love and service they recalled. There 
was no great profit made from the surrenders, no great 
charity shown to those who lost their homes. The brethren, 
with a few shillings to start them, were cast as real mendicants 
upon the world again.? Public opinion was whipped up to 
justify the King’s severities. Among the fierce preachers of the 
Reformation there was little pity for the crooked necks, slow 
bellies, idle drones and abbey lubbers, plants which the Heavenly 
Father never planted, mumblers of praises and creatures of the 
Pope.? 
Others besides monks and friars at Oxford must have watched 
the new policy of confiscation with alarm. College endowments 
were as tempting as monastic. Courtiers were equally ready to 
“gape after” both. But Henry disposed of that suggestion 
with the fine air which he could always assume. He had too 
much scholarship, we are assured, to wrong scholars. Though 
the Abbey lands had “ fleshed” his followers, they should not 
devour the Colleges as well. The King would pull down sin by 
defacing the Monasteries. But he would never overthrow good- 
ness or impair the revenues of a house of learning. ‘‘I tell you, 
Sirs, that I judge no land in England better bestowed than that 
which is given to our Universities, for by their maintenance our 
Realm shall be well governed when we be dead and rotten.” 
And the Universities, presumably consoled by this assurance, 
accepted the Royal policy with little open complaint. Cranmer 
as Archbishop issued commissions to visit Merton and All Souls. 
At Merton they altered some time-honoured customs, like the 
capping of Master Fellows by Bachelors in the quadrangle, with 
a freedom which caused an academic stir. But Gardiner, the 
Visitor of New College, Magdalen and Corpus, was a force to be 
reckoned with on the other side. His hostility to Cranmer 
increased daily, and in Oxford he probably found more support. 
The Bishops’ Book or Institution of a Christian Man set forth 
again in 1537 what the Bishops desired churchmen to believe. 
1 Dugdale (Monasticon, 1830, VI, 1529). 
® The monks in many cases received pensions at any rate for a time, 
but the friars as a rule did not. There is no record of pensions for the 
Oxford Franciscans, though Baskerfeld was probably provided for. (See 
Little, 119, and Gasquet, Chap. xxi.) 
3 For these picturesque epithets see Gasquet (109). 
“ The chief Magistrates of the University, says Wood (Amn. II, 64) 
were forced to have the order annulled, lest it should breed malapertness 
in the students.

    78 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
But its preparation showed how widely the Bishops differed 
from each other. The Bible, which Tyndale, Coverdale and 
Matthew had laboured with rare devotion to translate, and 
which many an unauthorised version had endeared to Englishmen 
already, was at last authorised for general use.t The famous 
frontispiece indicated that God regarded King Henry as a man 
after His own heart. But even the Great Bible by no means 
satisfied all opinions. In 1542 Cranmer invited Convocation to 
revise it, and Bishops and Doctors were appointed for the purpose. 
Gardiner had a long list of corrections ready. But before matters 
had gone far Henry intervened. He decided that the Universities 
might undertake the task of revision. The Bishops protested, 
but Cranmer insisted on obedience to the King. The Universi- 
ties, for their part, took no action in the matter, and so for the 
time nothing further was done. 
Cranmer remained in the ascendant, and all attempts to 
shake his credit with the King broke down. But the violence 
of the Reformation was soon to havea check. Cromwell laboured 
to discipline the clergy, to denounce idolatry and image-worship, 
to enjoin works of faith and charity,instead. But the Six Articles 
of 1539 marked a significant reaction. At Oxford, says Wood, 
few Scholars were entrapped by them, but they became “a noted 
touchstone to try the consciences of men.” Persecution revived. 
Latimer and Shaxton were forced to resign—“ sore thunderbolts ” 
to the old preacher of the Reformation. Melancthon ‘‘ shuddered 
with horror.” Cranmer put away his wife. The King soon 
afterwards put away another: Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour 
were already dead. In 1540 Cromwell fell, unmourned and 
widely hated. The Archbishop, very sorrowful when he recalled 
the Minister’s faithfulness and wisdom, was yet glad that his 
treason was discovered in time. Even while working at his 
beautiful Litany, Cranmer must have realised how precarious 
were the fortunes of the Reformation. In 1543 another Confes- 
sion set forth the Necessary Doctrine and Erudition of a Christian

View of the History of the English Bible and Canon Dixon’s Church His-

“an expurgated edition of Matthew’s Bible,” and Matthew’s Bible as 
“‘an imperfect conglomerate of Tyndale and Coverdale.” To Mr. Froude 
(Hist. II, 498, ed. 1893) its tenderness, majesty, simplicity and grandeur 
all bear witness to the work of Tyndale. There were various issues of 
it before the King’s death, in one of which the well-known frontispiece 
appeared. Dr. Westcott’s book is the chief authority on the subject,

  THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION 79 
Man. In 1545 an Act for the dissolution of chantries ? raised 
a fresh panic in University circles. Dean Cox, the Prince’s 
tutor, wrote in grave apprehension of the wolves who threatened 
to devour the realm. But the King repeated to Parliament his 
assurance that he would never suffer learning to decay. To the 
last, however doubtful or sinister his actions, Henry held the 
same lofty and self-righteous tone. And now the days of his 
imposing tyranny were over. Before the end of January 1547, 
the King whom all his subjects feared was dead. 
The new reign found the University weakened and embar- 
rassed. Students had fallen off. The old Halls were more and 
more deserted. The Canon Law had gone out of favour. The 
Schoolmen were held up to obloquy.? There was little encourage- 
ment to take degrees.4 Dangerous books had been prohibited 
and a good many useful volumes among them burned. Henry 
had spared the Colleges and had expressly exempted the Univer- 
sity from payments levied on the Church. But the fear of 
confiscation still hung over them, and they were not entirely 
comforted even by Somerset’s assurance that, if College lands 
were attacked, the nobility themselves would hardly feel secure. 
The year 1543, which had seen the settlement for the time at 
any rate of the long quarrel with the city over Wolsey’s Charter, 
had been marked by the loss of the University treasure, stolen 
from the Congregation House by ‘‘evil men.” The evil men 
were caught—one of them had been an Oxford scholar. But 
they were judged apparently with the surprising mildness on 
which most ecclesiastical offenders except heretics could count. 
A little earlier the King had intervened to regulate the appoint- 
ment of the Proctors. Only Masters of Arts of eight years’ 
standing were to be chosen ®: the independence perhaps of the 
younger men was feared. And in the same years enthusiasts 
at Oxford had plunged as readily as enthusiasts at Cambridge 
into the controversy over Greek pronunciation which had set 
the Northern University aflame. 
Erasmus had already protested against the easy usage of 
the Greeks of the Renaissance, who, regardless of the niceties of

mass for a departed soul. But a chantry might also be a separate build-

the King (Ann. II, 81).

spelling, pronounced various vowels and diphthongs in exactly 
the same way.! It was a breach with old Greek custom, the 
Reformers pleaded. It was careless and confusing. It produced 
“‘a feeble piping like that of sparrows or an unpleasant hissing 
like that of snakes.’ 2 Thomas Smith and John Cheke, two 
brilliant Cambridge scholars destined to eminence in many fields, 
took the matter up with vigour and insisted on reform. The 
younger men threw themselves into the battle on Smith’s side. 
In vain Gardiner, Cromwell’s successor as Chancellor at Cam- 
bridge, stormed against the innovators, sentenced Regents to 
expulsion and undergraduates to be birched. In vain more 
moderate Conservatives pleaded the weight of Continental usage 
and the inconvenience of a change. The new method made 
progress. Gardiner’s authority failed to suppress it. Oxford 
scholars adopted the new views from Cambridge, and before 
long convinced themselves that the improvement had begun 
with them. 
Sterner controversies, however, were at hand. It soon 
became evident at Oxford that the new reign meant the triumph 
of the Reforming party. Dr. Harley of Magdalen, preaching at 
St. Peter’s East against Popish superstitions, was hurried up to 
London by an over-zealous Commissary to be punished as a 
heretic. But the tactless Commissary met with no encourage- 
ment, and it was thought desirable to hush the matter up. The 
Protestants in the University, led by Cox, the Dean of Christ 
Church, came to the front and asserted themselves. The views 
of the new King’s Council were not to be mistaken. In vain 
Gardiner lifted up his voice in protest, demanded rather than 
recommended moderation, denounced the Archbishop as no 
better than a heretic and the iconoclasts as ‘‘ worse than hogs.” 
He had been willing to submit to King Henry, but he could 
not tolerate submission to Cranmer. And the Archbishop 
professed no love for a colleague who fought with a dung-fork 
and found knots in a rush.4 Gardiner’s successor in the See of 
Winchester once sketched the famous Bishop’s portrait—a 
swart colour, a hanging look, frowning brows, deep-set eyes, a 
nose hooked like a buzzard, great paws like the devil, an outward 
monster with a ‘‘ vengeable”’ wit; and the caricature, drawn

Greek.)

  THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION 81 
with the freedom of ecclesiastical polemics, stood for all that the 
Reformers hated most.! Gardiner was a strong man with some 
strong principles. But he was not free from violence or craft. 
He could not refrain from attacking his opponents, and in 1547 
the Council sent him to the Fleet. Some three years later, still 
disdaining any compromise, the intrepid Bishop was deprived 
of his See. He lived to be amply revenged upon his adversaries, 
and it can hardly be doubted that he commanded the sympathies 
of all the great party both at Oxford and at Cambridge which 
still clung to Conservative views. 
But Gardiner and his friends were overpowered. The new 
Protector, flushed with his victory at Pinkie, was strong enough 
at first to carry all before him. The tide of ecclesiastical reform 
swept on. The King remained Head of the Church. But 
recent tyrannous legislation was repealed. The Six Articles, 
the new treasons, the old laws against heresy, for the most 
part disappeared. There were outbreaks of feeling against 
the clergy, vehement outbreaks against images, church treasures 
and church bells. Erasmus’ Paraphrase of the New Testament 
was translated and published with a preface by Udall. The 
ex-Master of Eton did not fail to point out that, if Alexander 
the Great had had Aristotle for a tutor, Edward with Somerset 
for his guardian was still more fortunately placed. A general 
Visitation of the Kingdom was ordered, and existing authorities 
for the time suspended. New Articles, founded on the prece- 
dents of Cromwell and of Henry, endeavoured to combine the 
ever-varying regulations of the last reign with a cautious advance 
towards the views of the Reformers. One clause, which aimed 
at the destruction not of shrines only but of pictures and paint- 
ings, boded ill for the storied windows of Oxford, the rare glass 
in her chapels, the frescoes on her walls. The attack on chantries 
and colleges proceeded, but again All Souls and the Oxford 
Colleges escaped.? The pulpits were tuned and preachers re- 
stricted afresh. Cranmer laboured to discover if his clergy were 
carrying out the new regulations, and maintaining scholars at 
the Universities as the law required. Latimer denounced the 
“lording loiterers’’ placed in palaces and couched in Courts. 
The Devil, he found, was always residing in his parish. Up

with candles, superstitions and idolatry, away with the light 
of the Gospel, down with Christ’s Cross! But with these out- 
breaks of enthusiasm or prejudice pleas for charity and education 
mingled. ‘In time past when a rich man died, they were 
wont to help the poor scholars at the Universities with exhibition. 
ess Now, when God’s Word is brought to light, none helpeth 
the scholar nor the poor.” Let them see more schools, more 
endowments, more compassion. For the love of God let more 
teachers and school-masters be appointed, and let them have 
stipends worthy of their pains.t 
The temper of the country was rising. The Reformers 
moved too fast. The rapacity of the men in power was too 
conspicuous. Bishop Holbeach of Lincoln, a converted monk, 
signed away under pressure much of the property of his See. 
Men said that, when he mounted the throne in his Cathedral, 
the great tower of the Minster shuddered and fell. Ponet at 
Winchester bartered the possessions of his splendid Bishopric. 
Somerset, for all his generous theories, was “‘ drowned. ”’ like the 
rest ‘‘in this filthy desire of getting together goods,’’? But 
for the time the new men and the new ideas were supreme. 
Orders and injunctions multiplied. With the help of German 
mercenaries opposition was put down. ‘‘ Quarter the Germans,” 
Paget advised the Protector, “ on the disaffected towns, to make 
them sweat.” The gentlemen of Oxfordshire met Lord Grey 
at Witney to arrange for executions in the new Cathedral city. 
Parish priests were hanged from the steeples, to emphasise the 
Council’s supremacy in ecclesiastical affairs. The Act of Unifor- 
mity established the first Prayer-Book. And in the same year, 
1549, King Edward’s Visitation of Oxford University began. 
The King’s eyes, directed by his uncle the Protector—so the 
Royal proclamation stated—had been turned to the Academies 
of England, as fountains and seminaries of doctrinal learning, 
whence truth might arise to enlighten the world. Nine Com- 
missioners were appointed, with Dudley, Earl of Warwick, at 
their head. Holbeach and Ridley * represented the new Bishops, 
1 Quoted by Dixon (II, 488-9). 
* See the protest of John Hales, clerk of the Hanaper, quoted by 
Dixon (II, 508-10). 
* Wood gives Bishop Heath’s name, instead of Ridley’s. Ridley was 
a Commissioner both for Oxford and for Cambridge, but was occupied 
chiefly at Cambridge. It is very doubtful whether Paget or Petre took 
part in the proceedings at Oxford, but Warwick’s signature appears on 
the Injunctions. The most prominent signatures to the Oxford Injunc- 
tions are those of the Bishop of Lincoln, of Dean Cox and Dean Heynes, 
and they probably with Nevenson and Morison did the work in Oxford. 
The Statutes sent to Cambridge were signed apparently by the King 
and also by Somerset and 8 other members of the Council (Lamb, Collec-

Paget and Petre the men of affairs. Dean Cox of Christ Church 
was prominent among University Reformers. Dean Heynes of 
Exeter, who had been Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, Christopher 
Nevenson, a Doctor of Laws, and Richard Morison, an Esquire, 
completed a Commission of some authority and weight. Existing 
Statutes were discounted, as ‘‘ antiquated, semi-barbarous and 
obscure ”’—to the delight, says Wood, of the saucy young Refor- 
mers, who seized the opportunity to affront their seniors on the 
other side. The Visitors were given large powers to inquire and 
to investigate, to suspend offices, stipends and endowments, and 
if need be to punish and coerce. Moneys devoted to feasts and 
funeral ceremonies, even money devoted to lectures, might be 
turned to better uses. College funds for choirs and church 
expenses, or for training boys in grammar, might be diverted 
to the teaching of philosophy and arts. Unsatisfactory Heads 
and Fellows could be replaced. Two or more Colleges might be 
joined together. The endowments of chantries might go to 
Scholarships and education. All Statutes, privileges and regula- 
tions, both in the University and in its Colleges and Halls, could 
be revised and altered as the Visitors thought best. Services 
and disputations, lectures and degrees might be reviewed. The 
study of Civil Law, “ now almost extinct,” was to be specially 
fostered, and for that purpose the Visitors might, if they thought 
fit, transfer to All Souls the Civil Law students of New College, 
and to New College the students of arts at All Souls. They 
had power to make All Souls a College of lawyers, to devote 
New College to divinity and arts, and to assign one College 
solely to the study of medicine. They had power to summon 
and dismiss Congregations, to impose oaths of allegiance to the 
King and of repudiation of the Pope.t The Commissioners 
who assembled in St. Mary’s on the 24th May, to hear an inaugural 
sermon from Peter Martyr, must have realised that the terms of 
their appointment were as comprehensive as any Reformer could 
desire.

  84 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
It appears that the Visitors brought down with them to 
Oxford a body of new Statutes drafted by the Council,t and 
modified or supplemented these upon the spot. But the original 
does not seem to be preserved. It is not in the University 
Archives. It was not known to Twyne or Wood. It is not to 
be found at the Record Office. But there are copies of it at 
Oxford, similar in most points to the Statutes given at the same 
time to Cambridge, and one of these copies, contained in a 
collection of Oriel College Statutes and Injunctions, was printed 
by Thomas Hearne in 1729%. ‘Fear God, honour the King,” 
were the first words of the new code after the preamble, as it 
went on to re-state in no unreasonable spirit rules based on the 
ordinances and customs of the past. It fixed the length of terms 
and of vacations, the days and hours of public lectures, and the 
authors to be studied.* Medicine, dialectic and rhetoric were to 
begin at seven in the morning. Hebrew, Civil Law, philosophy 
and Greek were to follow from eight to nine. At nine theology 
took the field alone, and mathematics held it from twelve to 
one. Law included not only the law of Rome but “ the ecclesias- 
tical laws of our realm, which we are about to set forth.’ 
1 The preamble speaks of ‘‘ nonnullas leges, in hoc volumine inscrip- 
tas.” It is clear that this was the case at Cambridge. The Cambridge 
Commissioners, already appointed in November 1548, spent the winter 
apparently in drawing up the Statutes, which they took to Cambridge 
in May 1549 (Lamb, Collect. of Docts. xxvi sq. and 102 sq.). 
2 The MS. which Hearne printed (Rawlinson Statutes 45) is now in 
the Bodleian. It was formerly Hearne’s property, given him by Richard 
Graves, who according to a note on the fly-leaf bought it in Paternoster 
Row in October 1727. Before that it was known apparently as an Oriel 
Register to Richard James. (See Clark’s Life of Wood, IV, 131.) Mr. 
Gibson has taken this MS. as the basis of the Edwardian Statutes printed 
in his volume (341 sg.), and has collated with it the copy of these Statutes 
preserved in the Bodleian in Registyum E, Darrell’s Register. These 
seem to be the earliest copies extant, but we do not know in either case 
what they were taken from. References by Twyne and others to the 
Edwardian Statutes are noted by Dr. Clark (Life of Wood, IV, 128-31). 
Both at Oxford and at Cambridge the original Statutes have disappeared, 
and Cambridge also is dependent upon copies, preserved in The Black 
Parchment Book, in Statuta Academie Cantabrigiensis (MDCCLXXXV) 
and in the Library of Corpus Christi College. I have to thank the Regis- 
trary, the Librarian of Corpus and their Assistants for information kindly 
given me there, and Miss E. Stokes for helping me in my search—a vain 
search—for the originals at the Record Office. The Privy Council records 
and the Library at Lambeth also know nothing of them. I give refer- 
ences here to the version printed by Hearne in the Appendix to his edition 
of Trokelowe’s Annales Edvardi II, and when necessary to Mr. Gibson’s 
proofs.

Law was banned. A revolution was raging in theology. But 
the old methods of the Schools were slow in yielding, even if 
the ancient system was being gradually widened and re-shaped. 
The new Statutes summed up with a certain distinctness the 
tules for study, disputations and degrees. The young student 
from school was now to devote his first year to mathematics, 
to learn dialectic in his second year, and philosophy in his third 
and fourth. Four years of lectures and disputations prepared 
him for the Bachelor’s status. Three years more, including 
philosophy, astronomy, perspective and Greek, qualified him 
for the Master’s rank. The old Trivium and Quadrivium were 
apparently to some extent re-cast. Music is not mentioned. 
The old stress on grammar, Latin grounding, seems to be dimin- 
ished. New stress is laid on Greek. Masters of Arts taking up 
divinity were now asked for five years only of theology and 
Hebrew : but for the Doctorate four more years were required.? 
Peter Lombard’s Sentences were out of fashion, but for both 
Bachelors and Doctors of Divinity, lectures, disputations and 
University sermons were a part of the course.? The Bachelor of 
Laws had to study for six years, the Doctor three years longer.4 
The latter must learn something of the laws of England and of 
other States. The student of medicine and surgery had to study 
six years, to dispute twice, to respond once and to see two 
anatomies before securing his Bachelor’s degree. He had to per- 
form two anatomies and to prove that he had effected at least 
1 With these public lectures ‘‘ domestic lectures’ were not to inter- 
fere (Hearne, Trokelowe, 357). Other authors are mentioned besides 
those named above. But it is noticeable that the new Statutes omit 
the De Animalibus and the Analytica of Aristotle, and that in the Inter- 
pretations or Amendments given in Registrum E both these old favourites 
of the Schools are restored (Cf. pp. 344 and 358 of Mr. Gibson’s work). 
8 Instead of the old requirements, seven years for admission to read 
a book of the Sentences and two years’ further study for the License. 
Peter Lombard’s views on Papal authority were hard to reconcile with 
the Royal Supremacy. But the Injunctions required Masters of Arts 
studying theology to take their B.D. within seven years of their M.A. 
(Hearne, 368), and allowed theological students over 24—who had come 
up to study theology only—to take it after seven years’ study without 
a previous degree in Arts (Ib. 366). 
3 Continuous residence also was probably required. (See Peacock’s 
Observations, App., xlvii, n.)

three cures before he was admitted to practise.1 And he had 
apparently to see two or three more anatomies, to dispute twice 
and to respond twice for his Doctor’s degree.2_ The old practice 
of disputation was thus elaborately guarded. It couldif necessary 
be enforced with fines. Allranks were subjected to it, Sophisters, 
Bachelors and Masters, all studies, medicine, philosophy, theology 
and law. The Colleges were required to supply a certain number 
of disputers,* according to a regular plan. The Schoolmen might 
be falling out of fashion, but their ancient habit of debate survived. 
The new Statutes recalled the old rules about dress, deprecated 
luxury and vanities like silken ‘night-caps’,> They re-stated the 
rules for the election of University Officials, Chancellor and 
Vice-Chancellor, Proctors and Taxors, Bedels and Keepers of 
the common Chest. The Chancellor and Bedels were to be 
elected by the Regents, and Non-Regents, the Keepers by 
“the whole senate of the Academy,” which probably means 
the same thing, the Proctors and Taxors by the Regents alone. 
The statements about the Vice-Chancellor’s or Pro-Chancellor’s? 
election—the first reference to the subject in the Oxford Statutes 
—are less clear’: but in the end, it seems, the Non-Regents 
1 The three cures may have been required for surgical practice only, 
though the Oxford Statute does not say so (Hearne, Trokelowe, 347-8). 
The anatomies were certainly part of the medical training. (See also 
Lamb, 127 and 283.) 
2 No period of study for the Doctorate is mentioned. But there 
follows a general statement (Hearne, 348) that an M.A.—who could 
become a Doctor of Laws after 5 years’ study of law—could become a 
Doctor of Medicine after 5 years’ study of medicine. Nothing is said 
here about practical work. Could that have been taken for granted ? 
The necessity for it must surely have been realised more and more, in 
days when a separate medical College at Oxford was proposed.

5 * SnomtAloic, id est . . nocturnis pileis.’”” (See Gibson’s Statutes, 
349). This is apparently the coif, a cap tied like a night-cap under the 
chin. I have to thank Mr. E. F, Beaumont of Oxford for this suggestion. 
* The Cambridge Statutes of Edward VI and Queen Mary extended 
to 3 years the period of necessary Regency for M.As., and the Elizabethan 
Statutes later extended it to 5. (See Peacock, Observations, 51.) I do 
not find any similar provision in the Edwardian Statutes at Oxford, 
which speak of secundum annum (Gibson, 347) where the Cambridge 
version has tertium annum (Lamb, 128-9). 
' “ Procancellarius ’”’ used here (Hearne, 353) is a term rarely if ever 
used in early days. ‘‘ Vice-cancellarius’’ appears in the Registers in 
the middle of the 15th century. Wood has a note on the subject (Fasti, 
89). A Statute of 1551, printed by Mr. Gibson (361), provided for the 
appointment of a Deputy Procancellarius. 
8 They are in fact confusing. Hearne (353) says first that he is to 
be elected by the majority of Regents. This seems to have been the 
tule for Cambridge (Lamb, Documents, 133, and Peacock, Observations,

were allowed to vote in this case also. The influence of the 
Non-Regents, no doubt, tended to grow stronger, as the import- 
ance of the Regents as a teaching body declined. The promin- 
ence given to the Chancellor’s office is remarkable. He was 
to summon Congregations twice a term. He alone could give 
the Masters present leave to go away.1 He was primarily 
responsible for the good government of the University. He 
might sanction new Statutes ‘‘ with the whole Academy’s con- 
sent.” The chapter devoted to his office includes provisions 
establishing University sermons, checking the expenses connected 
with Determination, maintaining the old ceremonies in con- 
ferring degrees, recognising the interest of the Colleges in the 
advancement of their members,? and preventing the marriage 
of Fellows. To the last point neither Dean Cox nor Peter Martyr 
paid, it is to be feared, the attention which was due. 
The system of education at Oxford was changing. Public 
Lecturers and College teachers were replacing the old Masters 
of the Schools. But these new Statutes, imposed by the Crown 
in days of revolution, retained in no small measure the old 
traditions. They were supplemented by Ordinances or Injunc- 
tions addressed to the University and to separate Colleges as 
wells Those for the Colleges insisted on the reading and authority 
37): and Wood’s account of Dr. Tresham’s election in 1550 (Fasti, 90) 
seems to confirm this. But immediately afterwards Hearne speaks of 
his being elected in a Congregation of Regents and Non-Regents who 
all vote. Doubt may well have arisen on the subject. But the Inter- 
pretations or Amendments added later, and printed by Mr. Gibson (359) 
from Registrum E, make the matter clear. ‘‘ In electione vicecancellarii 
ius habeant et regentes et non regentes.”’ 
1 The Injunctions, more familiar with University practice, gave the 
Pro-Chancellor this power (Hearne, 366). = 
2 E.g. ‘‘ Cooptandus in aliquem ordinem, primum approbetur a majori 
parte collegii, cujus est, et collegii nomine ab uno ex eodem collegio et 
ordinario lectore facultatis sistetur coram cancellario tum in congrega- 
tione’’ (Hearne, 358). 
* The Rawlinson MS. printed by Hearne (Trokelowe, 342-70) gives 
first the new Statutes, unsigned, then a series of Injunctions for Oriel 
College, which, no doubt, were issued to all the Colleges alike, and which 
correspond, with few changes, with the Ordinances of the Royal Visitors 
of 1549 given to All Souls, and printed with the All Souls Statutes in 
vol.:I of the Statutes of the Colleges of Oxford. A mutilated copy of similar 
Injunctions among the Magdalen archives is printed by Macray (Register, 
II, 23-6). There might well be similar ordinances preserved, and 
even bound up with the Edwardian Statutes, in many College Libraries ; 
but I have not traced any at the older Colleges except those inserted at 
the beginning of the earliest Register of Exeter College. After the Oriel 
Injunctions, which are signed by the Bishop of Lincoln, Cox, Heynes, 
Morison and Nevenson, Hearne gives the Injunctions issued to the Uni- 
versity, which are signed by Warwick, the Bishop of Lincoln, Cox and 
Heynes—Ridley does not appear—and then a few more College Injunc-

of Scripture, on services in Chapel, on grace at meals. They 
regulated worship; the Lord’s Supper was to be celebrated 
every Sunday. They enforced the catechism. They swept 
away unnecessary altars, superstitious monuments, noisy Chapel- 
bells. They dealt also with points of discipline and conduct. 
They guarded against the abuse of College endowments and 
tried to limit Fellowships to twenty years. They forbade College 
funds to be spent on teaching grammar ; Latin was to be acquired 
at school. They reminded the Colleges that they had been 
intended for the children of poor people. They restricted the 
outlay on eating and drinking which accompanied every stage of 
a University career. They forbade ‘‘ prodigious” clothes and 
shaven heads. They restrained extravagance and gossip. They 
put down dicing at all times and seasons, and cards except at 
Christmas. They forbade loose talk and English talk alike: 
but every man might ring the changes on Latin, Greek and 
Hebrew as much as he chose.1_ The Injunctions addressed to the 
University, though they included some rules of importance, dealt 
mostly with matters of detail, imposing fines for non-attendance 
at Congregations or at disputations, settling small points of 
procedure, laying down supplementary regulations for respon- 
sions, and not overlooking little points of dress. 
An interesting diary exists of the Visitors’ proceedings at 
Cambridge, which is probably a fair example of the way in which 
at both Universities the Commissioners went to work. They 
visited the Colleges in turn. They summoned the Fellows 
before them. They examined documents, usages, accounts. 
They listened to complaints and claims, condemned what they 
regarded as idolatry, revised College Statutes as they pleased. 
Incidentally they heard disputations, ‘‘ to the greate comforte of 
thawdiens.” And they rarely failed to crown the day with 
supper when their task was done. Indeed on one occasion in the 
afternoon “‘the Vyc. and Proctors gave the Vysytors a posset 
viz. a gallonde of Ipocrace and a pyke.” The diary ends with a 
warning to the College companies, perhaps more easily given 
than obeyed, to get back to the study of their books and to 
cease talking of disturbing news.2. We have no such record 
tions, signed by the same four names. Mr. Gibson, while naturally omit- 
ting the College Injunctions, gives (358-60) from Reg. E (82-3) various 
amendments and interpretations of the new Statutes, solving doubts 
which had evidently arisen on them, especially on points of procedure 
in regard to disputations. 
1 The Oriel Injunctions also abolished an old rule which forbade the 
College ‘‘ Scholastici ’’ during their year of probation to visit their parents 
even at the point of death (Hearne, 365).

of the Visitors at Oxford. But their proceedings would not 
be very different, nor their appreciation of hospitality less marked. 
The Visitation was hailed in some quarters as marking the 
final downfall of the Schoolmen, as setting the Scriptures and the 
Fathers in their proper place. But apart from that there was 
nothing alarming in the educational reforms proposed. The 
rules for better work and better discipline were in no way new. 
Endowments, it seems, were not seriously threatened. The 
schemes for throwing Colleges together, for devoting one to Law 
and one to Medicine, were not pressed. All Souls, though it 
suffered from iconoclasm, escaped a revolution. The law stu- 
dents of New College were left in peace. If old-fashioned dons 
complained of change, the younger men rejoiced in their freedom. 
“The Academians,” says Wood, enjoyed “a liberty of opining 
whatsoever they pleased, and speaking freely their opinions where- 
soever they listed.’’ Intolerance was confined to matters of 
conscience, but there, round questions of religion, hot controversies 
raged. Adherents of the old ideas were still numerous in Oxford. 
At Merton Richard Smith, till replaced as Professor of Divinity 
by Peter Martyr, was a pillar of the Roman Catholic cause. 
Hugh Weston, for some years Rector of Lincoln, and Nicholas 
Harpsfield, who had been Professor of Greek, were both prominent 
Romanists who found their triumph later. New College, if it 
tolerated Dr. London, bred some of the staunchest opponents 
of the Reformation. Oriel, moved by Morgan Phillips, was 
no less staunch on the same side. Lincoln had old ecclesiastical 
traditions. Exeter had strong sympathy with the rebels of the 
West. James Brooks, Master of Balliol, was destined to be a 
Marian Bishop, though Jewel imputed to him impurity of con- 
science and of life. On the other side the Dean of Christ Church 
was a vigorous partisan. And so, it may be, were Reformers 
like Bentham and Bickley at Magdalen, Jewel and William Cole 
at Corpus, Randolph at Broadgates Hall.1 Between the two 
sides a certain number of leading men of Conservative opinions 
stood perhaps for moderate courses—Oglethorpe, President of 
Magdalen, Warner, Warden of All Souls, and John Smyth, 
elected Provost of Oriel in 1550.2, These men may have yielded 
sufficiently to meet the Commissioners’ requirements. If Warner   
      
1 And, it may be added, Harding of New College, who reverted to 
Romanist views. Bentham and Bickley became Elizabethan Bishops, and 
Bickley was for a time Warden of Merton. 
2 Smyth’s hurried election was in fact a defiance of the King’s Council. 
But the fact that men like Tresham, Wright and Marshall were prominent 
in University business both under Edward and under Mary—while it 
may suggest pliancy—probably indicates that a spirit of moderation 
was at work. Tresham was no sycophant, and before the end of Edward’s 
reign he fell into disgrace. Oglethorpe withdrew in 1552.

  go A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
satisfied Cranmer, the Visitor of his College, the Royal Visitors 
would not be likely to complain. Some ejections, no doubt, 
there were. Smith and Weston were notoriously hostile to the 
Reformation, and, it was stated, notoriously irregular in their 
lives. Morwent and two other members of Corpus passed a 
short time in prison. Cox is accused of forcing his nominees 
into Fellowships without regard to College rules. But we have 
no records of wholesale persecution. And in days when authority 
and doctrine changed so often, many theologians could make a 
good case for acquiescing in whatever the Head of the Church 
ordained. 
The Commission lasted for several months, adjourning its 
sittings from time to time. But the Dean of Christ Church was 
on the spot to represent it, and his authority as Visitor and 
Chancellor must have been difficult to withstand. Cox was deep 
in the confidence of Cranmer. He had friends among the Pro- 
testant divines abroad. He was clearly an uncompromising 
Reformer, and Wood charges him with doings difficult to forgive. 
He installed Peter Martyr at Christ Church, and, worse still, 
Peter Martyr’s wife. He allowed women to serve in the Colleges. 
Shy Romanists found this a ‘“‘ damnable ”’ innovation and called 
the women by hard names. He allowed preachers to rail against 
the old religion, and rude persons to abuse it in ballads and 
libels. He allowed surplices and copes to be made ridiculous, 
and the saying of Mass to be compared to the mumbling of 
charms. He allowed the weekly correction of students to cease, 
even though they might “ nose and impudentize ”’ their seniors. 
He allowed fasts to be broken, revels to be held, confession and 
repentance to be forgotten. But to these and other charges the 
Dean may possibly, from his own standpoint, have had a good 
defence. The triumph of one party inevitably brought with it 
trouble and annoyance for the other. 
At Magdalen startling outrages are said to have occurred.t 
A priest was dragged from the altar. A censer was snatched 
from the ministrant’s hands. The symbols of Christ’s Sacrament 
were scattered on the ground. Violent young Reformers broke 
into the choir with hatchets and chopped the service-books to 
pieces. In many quarters there was a fresh outcry against 
idolatry. Painted windows were condemned and removed. 
The noble reredos at All Souls was demolished. Emblems of 
superstition were banished from Christ Church and elsewhere. 
Fanaticism, gathering force from indulgence, turned upon the

seem to have some foundation, though the Vice-President’s Register at 
the College ignores them. (See also Humfrey, Juelli Vita, ed, 1573, pp- 
72-3).

THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION or 
famous libraries of Oxford. Illuminated missals, unpopular 
philosophy, diagrams dealing with astronomy and mathematics, 
“accounted Popish or diabolical or both,” manuscripts “ guilty 
of no other superstition than red letters in their fronts or titles,” 
were taken down from desks or shelves, sold off and destroyed. 
Wood declares that the works of scholars, once the pride of Oxford 
learning, were carried about the city on biers and burned in the 
market-place. From Merton Library a cartload of manuscripts, 
we are assured, was carried away. Bishop Gray’s treasures 
at Balliol were plundered. New College and Exeter, Lincoln 
and Queen’s had to face the same indignities. Books became 
“dog cheap.’ Whole libraries could be bought “‘ for an incon- 
siderable nothing.” 1 Duke Humphrey’s noble collection and 
the whole University Library was dispersed. Even the empty 
bookshelves were sold by the authorities. College Heads like 
Cox and Morwent cannot be acquitted of acquiescing in the 
University’s disgrace. 
One striking feature of the religious conflict was the great 
public disputation on the nature of the Sacrament, which the 
Visitors countenanced with their presence, and in which Peter 
Martyr bore a conspicuous part. Polemical theology had now 
become an absorbing occupation. The German Universities 
rang with the combats of Protestant divines. Cranmer would 
gladly have seen Melancthon in England, and both Peter Martyr 
and Martin Bucer were invited over from Strasburg.? Peter 
Martyr, after a stay of some months at Lambeth, was appointed 
Professor of Divinity at Oxford in 1549. There he soon showed 
himself a fighter, and discovered antagonists quite as contentious 
as himself. Before long the University was aflame. Peter 
Martyr began by lectures on the Corinthians, in which he de- 
nounced the ways of Pharisees and Papists and condemned fasts 
in Lent. But he went on to deal with the Presence of Christ 
in the Sacrament,’ and on that vital doctrine the men of the 
old school determined to meet him in the field. The Protector 
and Council had lately warned the University to carry on its 
1 Yet the large remains of medizval MSS. suggest that the tale of 
destruction may have been exaggerated. There must have been many 
College Fellows determined to save all they could. 
2 Peter Martyr Vermigli came originally from Florence. He had 
tuled over more than one Monastery and had been a great Catholic scholar. 
(See his Life by Josias Simler—Oratio de Vita et Obitu, 1563—and other 
authorities quoted by D.N.B. under “ Vermigli.”) Bucer, appointed at 
Cambridge soon afterwards, won popularity by his moderation. He 
visited Oxford on Martyr’s invitation, and lectured at Christ Church, 
in 1550. (See Mullinger, II, 117-25.)

disputations with lowliness of spirit. But there was nothing 
lowly in the angry Oxford Doctors who gathered to the attack. 
Richard Smith, no mean antagonist, challenged the Reformer 
to a public disputation. Feeling ran high. Violence was 
threatened. An organised opposition was arranged. Peter 
Martyr at first, it seems, declined the duel. He would not use 
the barbarous and ambiguous language of the Schoolmen. He 
would not undertake a set debate without due preparation and 
a license from the King. But he went down to the Schools 
with a body-guard of friends about him, and carried through 
the lectures which he had meant to give. To save a tumult the 
Vice-Chancellor interposed. The authorities were consulted. 
A formal disputation was arranged. But by that time Smith, 
the head of the opposition, had been arrested and had fled from 
Oxford. The Government’s sympathies were strongly upon 
Peter Martyr’s side. 
But the rival factions were not to be baulked. Dr. Tresham, 
a Canon of Christ Church and a well-known figure in Oxford, 
agreed to take Smith’s place. Cheadsey of Corpus and Morgan 
Phillips of St. Mary Hall, scholars of repute, came forward to 
support him. The Visitors were invited to be present, and Cox, 
the Vice-Chancellor, to preside. After “great hurrying and 
noise about the University,” the long expected contest took 
place. But, as might have been foreseen, three or four days of 
disputation left everybody where they were before.1_ Each side 
claimed the victory. Cox has been accused of favouring Martyr 
and of saving him from defeat. But he summed up apparently 
in terms of admiration for all the disputants alike. Peter had 
been a rock for firmness and a martyr in adducing testimonies. 
Everybody had shown a passion for the truth. No decision 
could be arrived at, but further debate was indefinitely deferred. 
Martyr, Tresham and Cheadsey, it seems, all prepared reports 
for publication.?, Oxford opinion in shops and taps, Martyr 
rather contemptuously admitted, was against him. But he 
appealed through the Press to the Council and the world. Tres- 
ham declared that the ‘‘ scandalous impudent old madman” 
had altered his discourse before printing it, in the most calum- 
nious way. But the Reformer had the Government’s ear. His 
manuscript alone was published; and the Protestants who 
adopted his opinions were content to believe that his argument 
prevailed. 
On one point the Visitors found City and University united 
in resisting unnecessary change. At Magdalen party feeling

  THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION 93 
was particularly strong, and the Protestants were certainly 
aggressive. Cox, perhaps “set on by some of the Society,” 
produced Injunctions for the regulation of the College, one of 
which aimed at the extinction of the College School. The 
Fellows resisted and appealed to the Crown. The Mayor and 
citizens of Oxford joined in with a strong protest. The inhabi- 
tants of the town had always received aid from the Colleges in 
training their children, “‘ some being called Schollers of the Houses 
and some called Quiristers, and yet learning their Grammar.” 
The children had had “meate, drinke, cloth and lodginge.” 
They had been “‘ verie well brought up in Learninge.” They 
had gone forward to Logic and other Faculties with little or no 
cost to their parents. The Commissioners, it was said, would 
have prevented the Colleges from educating choristers or others, 
and would have cast out of some of the Colleges thirty or forty 
or even fifty boys. The case was so strong that the Reformers 
relented, The eloquence and indignation of the “ poore Oratours ”’ 
prevailed. 
Other grievances were less easy to amend. It was a time 
of misgovernment and of economic transition, of grasping rapacity, 
of ‘cruel dearness.”” Twenty pence, said Ascham, would not 
buy what twelve pence bought in former days. Patronage 
was misused and the poorer students suffered. Polemical theology 
interfered with genuine study. The old Grammar Schools had 
decayed, and the new ones hardly filled their places. Parents, 
Wood avers, had no heart to educate their children as they 
used. If the same stern critic may be credited, the old lecture- 
rooms in Schools Street were deserted. Some of them were 
bought by townsmen and pulled down.? The Arts Schools 
built by Abbot Hokenorton were taken by laundresses to dry 
their clothes in. Learners fell off. Determiners diminished. 
1 Wood (Amn. II, 101), Wood credits Cox with an attempt to 
destroy the school at New College also (103). 
2 The figures should be taken with reserve. The wording of the 
petition in Wood (Amn. II, 102-3) is large and general: but it was on 
behalf of Magdalen College School that the fight was made. 
* Wood quotes (Amn. II, 119) from a charter of Queen Mary’s first year 
a description of the Schools as ‘‘ vastatas et in privatos hortos conversas ’”’— 
for what it may be worth. I do not find in Twyne XXI, 215 the account 
of the maltreatment of the Schools in Edward VI’s time which Dr. Clark 
speaks of (Wood’s Life, IV, 148). Nor have I been able to trace in the 
University Archives the Computus of receipts and expenses for the Schools 
building in 1557 which Dr. Clark refers to (Jb. 149). On the other hand, 
at the end of the volume in the University Archives labelled Computus 
Vice-Can,. AD. 1621—AD. 1666 there is a reference (p. 359) to the Canon 
Schools as “ ruinosae vel potius dirutae,”’ among the accounts of Vice- 
Chancellors Wright and Tresham, 1547 to 1554. Yet these Schools are 
elsewhere stated to have been rebuilt towards the end of the fifteenth 
century.

    94 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Disputations in logic and philosophy ceased. The Universities 
were despised as Stables of Asses and Stews of the Devil.t_ Univer- 
sity possessions, money and muniments to a large extent disap- 
peared. 
Some discount, no doubt, should be made from these gloomy 
generalisations. The Registers do not indicate any sharp fall 
in numbers under Edward VI.2\ On the contrary, in August 
1552, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor made a list of “‘ persons ’’ including 
Masters, Bachelors and others, which allotted no less than seven 
hundred and sixty-one to the Colleges and two hundred and 
sixty to the Halls.* A graver source of trouble for the future 
lay in the introduction of religious tests. One of the last acts 
of Edward’s Council was to call on the clergy to subscribe to the 
Forty-Two Articles of Religion which Cranmer and his colleagues 
had prepared. It was intended to make subscription necessary 
for University degrees, But within a few weeks the King was 
dead, and the Catholic party, now again in the ascendant, were 
only too ready to follow the lead given by their opponents. It 
was at Cambridge that the Reformation had the deepest roots, 
and that the success of the reaction was at first most striking. 
It was there that Northumberland’s cabal finally collapsed, and 
that the miserable Protector, deserted by his army, proclaimed 
with tears the Queen whom he had tried to supplant. It was 
there that the Vice-Chancellor, Sandys, dragged from his seat in 
Congregation, was arrested and hurried off to prison in the 
Tower, “more ready to die than to live.’”’ At Oxford these 
dramatic episodes were wanting, but the Catholic sentiment 
was even stronger, and on the proclamation of Queen Mary 
its friends broke into irrepressible rejoicings. Temporisers, no 
doubt, there were. Sir John Mason, a layman and diplomatist, 
who had succeeded Cox as Chancellor in 1552, continued to act,

2 The lists of degrees quoted from Register I by Mr. Boase are clearly 
incomplete from 1549 to 1551. (See Reg. of Univ., I, 217.) 
* This list is reproduced from Register GG by Mr. Boase (Univ. 
Reg., I, xxi-v). Magdalen has 138, Christ Church 131 names: New Inn 
Hall is credited with 49, Hart Hall and Broadgates with over 40 each. 
But servants are included in the Hall lists, and others besides students 
probably under Mr. Boase’s heading of ‘‘ Subgraduati’’ in the Colleges. 
‘Wood speaks (Ann. II, 113) of 1015 students on the Buttery books, but 
thinks the greater part of them were absent: this needs proof. Com- 
pare Dr, Clark’s lists of members on the College Books, 1565-83 (Reg., 
II, ii, 9-46). 
¢ The 42 Articles, ultimately reduced to 39, were published in 1553. 
The Second Prayer-Book had been published in 1552. 
5 I think this is clear from the Visitors’ Letter to the Vice-Chancellor 
of Cambridge, given by Lamb (Documents, 161-4), requiring subscription 
from M.As., B.Ds., and D.Ds. But I have no proof that similar instruc- 
tions were sent to Oxford.

so far as his other employments allowed.1_ He was prompt in 
deserting Northumberland for Mary. He bore the reputation 
of seeing “ further off ’’ than most men, and he served all masters 
with equal adroitness and success. Some of the leaders in Univer- 
sity business like Dr. Wright and Dr. Tresham took the same 
course. For the Catholics there was now no need to com- 
promise. In both Universities the partisans of the old order 
came into their own. 
Recent innovations were rapidly repealed. They were due, 
said the Queen emphatically, to the “ sensuall mindes and rashe 
determinations of a few men.’’* Old customs and old Statutes 
were restored. The Mass reappeared in College Chapels, and 
Transubstantiation among the doctrines of the Schools. Vest- 
ments and chalices were dug out “‘as if from the grave.’’ Men 
like Richard Smith and Hugh Weston returned to Oxford. 
Peter Martyr took refuge abroad, and his eager audiences were 
scattered. Students from Christ Church, Magdalen and Merton 
were to be found in the years that followed, gathered at the 
Protestant centres of the Continent, at Strasburg and Zurich, 
at Frankfort and Basle. Zurich especially attracted English 
scholars and treated them with conspicuous kindness, William 
Cole and Laurence Humfrey, both destined to be Heads of 
Oxford Colleges, stayed with Froschover, the great printer, who 
had studied under Peter Martyr, “ dwelling together like brothers 
with great glee.” John Parkhurst came from his Fellowship at 
Merton, and Jewel, who had lost his Fellowship at Corpus. 
Christopher Goodman, a Student of Christ Church, whose enthu- 
siasm led him to compare Queen Mary with the Queen of Hell, 
and John Foxe, the Martyrologist, who had ceased to be a Fellow 
of Magdalen, joined the refugees at Frankfort and elsewhere. 
From abroad Foxe sent home a noble warning against persecution. 
“ Life will go after liberty : nor only life, conscience will be taken 
from mankind.”” Many men destined to be Elizabethan prelates, 
who faced exile and privation under Mary, owed no small debt 
to German hospitality, and no small part of their formidable 
theology to German Protestant divines. 
The Bishop of Winchester gave Peter Martyr a safe-conduct. 
1 Mason was a great deal abroad between 1553 and 1556. But his 
appointment was apparently well received, though he was a layman 
and married (Clark, Reg. II, i, 239). He was the son of an Abingdon 
cow-herd,

requirements later,

(Ann. II, 119) that the Protestants continued for a time to read “‘ though 
very faintly,” the English Book of Common Prayer,

But he sent Commissioners to Oxford to visit New College, 
Magdalen and Corpus, and in each case the Reformers had to 
leave or to conform. At New College Thomas Harding, who 
had been thought a zealous Protestant, swung round to Romanist 
opinions. He became Gardiner’s chaplain and a leading con- 
troversialist upon the Roman side. Lady Jane Grey, whom 
he had helped to train, was moved to write to him from prison, 
in grief that so lively a member of Christ should have become 
“the deformed imp of the devil.” At Magdalen, where reform 
had been more violent, the reaction was more sweeping.? 
Haddon, “‘ scarce warm in his place,”’ the new President imported 
from Cambridge in defiance of the College Statutes, made way 
for Oglethorpe again. The strongest Protestants were ejected. 
The younger sort, says Wood, who refused to conform, were 
discommoned or whipped. At Corpus one Scholar was beaten 
so successfully—one lash for every verse that he had written 
against the Mass—that he became obedient to authority and 
developed into a Fellow of All Souls. But at Corpus the reaction 
was welcomed by many members of the College, with Morwent 
and Cheadsey at their head. The ornaments and vestments, 
the vessels. and candlesticks, mysteriously saved under King 
Edward, reappeared. Jewel, already famous as a lecturer and 
one of Peter Martyr’s most active supporters, was forced to 
withdraw to Broadgates Hall. He tried for a time to avoid 
extremes. He drew up the University’s address to Queen Mary, 
in terms with which even Tresham had no fault to find. A 
year later, though he had associated himself with Cranmer and 
Ridley in their disputation, he subscribed to the new Articles 
which the authorities enjoined. He stayed too long, says his 
biographer, in Oxford, lingering like St. Peter by the fire in the 
high priest’s courtyard. But his real opinions were well known. 
The new Dean of Christ Church, Marshall, had marked him 
down for treatment as a heretic. He fled on foot from Oxford, 
and faithful friends helped him to make good his escape 
abroad. 
But, as the reaction strengthened, more conspicuous victims 
were required. Cranmer, already condemned to death for 
treason, and Latimer, who had refused to fly, had been since 
September 1553 imprisoned in the Tower. Ridley had been 
sent there earlier,in July. And in March 1554 orders were issued 
for the three “sons of perdition and iniquity” to be brought 
1 Letters from Queen Mary are noted in the Vice-President’s Register, 
bidding the Fellows observe their ancient Statutes. Humfrey gives a 
brief account of the reaction at Magdalen and elsewhere (Juelli Vita, 
68 sq.).

to Oxford, to defend their heresies in disputation if they could. 
Doctors from both Oxford and Cambridge were appointed to 
confute them. Tresham and Oglethorpe, Richard Smith and 
Cheadsey were conspicuous in the Oxford list. John Harpsfield, 
now a close ally of Bonner’s, was among them. So was Henry 
Cole, who had been Warden of New College, and who is alleged 
to have been once a Reformer.? Weston, a conspicuous pluralist, 
now high in favour, acted as Moderator, and nothing was omitted 
which would lend importance to the clerical gatherings at St. 
Mary’s and elsewhere. The questions chosen for debate in the 
Divinity School concerned the presence of Christ in the Mass. 
The arguments lasted three days,* but the proceedings were not 
free from disorder. Cranmer disputed on the first day against 
Cheadsey, Tresham and others, from eight in the morning till 
nearly two. Ridley followed on the second day, arguing with 
Richard Smith and other opponents, interrupted frequently 
by Weston, and met by some clamour and hissing in the School. 
Latimer on the third day handed in his written answers. He 
was faint and weary, his memory “clean gone.” Facing his 
opponents, a strange but venerable figure, ‘‘ with a kerchief 
and two or three caps on his head, his spectacles hanging by a 
string at his breast and a staff in his hand,” he told them that 
for lack of books and strength and practice he was as fit to discuss 
theology as to be Captain of Calais. But the audience had no 
sympathy for heretics and was not in a mood to be impartial. 
On the Friday following all three prisoners were condemned. 
They were taken back to their confinement, and for eighteen 
months they waited while the triumph of the reaction was 
secured. 
In the interval events moved fast. The Queen married a 
Spanish husband. Cardinal Pole arrived in England and recon- 
ciled the Kingdom with the Roman See. King Henry’s eccle- 
siastical legislation was largely swept away. Persecution and 
burnings began. Hooper died in his own Cathedral city. 
Cheadsey assured the people at Paul’s Cross that Bonner was 
1 Cranmer seems to have been lodged at Bocardo almost all the time 
of his imprisonment ; but he may have paid a brief visit to the Deanery. 
Ridley and Latimer, after the first at any rate, stayed with city officials. 
The name ‘‘ Bishop’s Hole”’ was given to a small ground-floor cell on 
the West side of Bocardo (Hurst, Oxford Topog. 70). 
2 Henry Cole, Warden of New College in 1542, must be distinguished 
from Arthur Cole, President of Magdalen in 1555, and William Cole, 
President of Corpus in 1568 (Boase, Reg., I, 159, 206 and 215). 
* But on the fourth day, Thursday, Cranmer was brought back to 
join in a further disputation held in connection with Harpsfield’s admission 
to the Doctor’s degree, and won general admiration by his skill in argu- 
ment. (See Canon Dixon’s full account, Church History, IV, 181 sq.).

    98 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
prepared to do his duty. Spanish Friars, Peter Soto and John 
de Villa Garcia 1 began to teach and to dispute at Oxford in 
Peter Martyr’s place. At last, in September 1555, Brooks, once 
Master of Balliol and now Bishop of Gloucester, acting under 
Papal authority, opened his Court for the trial of Cranmer in 
St. Mary’s Church. The Archbishop refused to acknowledge 
his jurisdiction, and the proceedings were reported to Rome. 
Cranmer returned to Bocardo, and two or three weeks later 
Ridley and Latimer were brought up for trial, before three 
Bishops of whom Brooks was one. Their opinions were con- 
demned. They were sentenced and degraded. Lovers of pro- 
cedure may note the tradition that, when Latimer was sentenced, 
the cloth was removed from the table, because, unlike Ridley, 
he had never taken a Doctor’s degree. On the 16th October 
they were led to the stake, “in the Towne Ditch, over against 
Baliell Colledge.” 2 Cranmer was praying, and it may be watch- 
ing, in his prison close by. They had confessed to each other 
that they dreaded martyrdom. Latimer had declared that he 
would wish to “creep into a mouse-hole.” Ridley had feared 
that he would prove but “a white-livered knight.” Yet, when 
the hour of trial came, they met it with the loftiest courage. 
Ridley, who was ahead of his companion, an old man with “a 
very evil back,” turned round to welcome and embrace him. 
They listened to Richard Smith’s bitter little sermon—“ though 
I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth 
me nothing.” They were not allowed to reply. Ridley gave 
some of his garments to the by-standers. He was carefully 
1 Otherwise Dr. Garcina. Wood mentions more doubtfully two 
others, Rescius and Carranza (Amn. II, 127). Bartholomew Carranza, 
a famous Spanish divine and Archbishop, was afterwards accused of 
heresy himself. 
2 This is Hutten’s statement : he adds that the stake was “‘ not farr” 
from Bocardo: he went up to Oxford within 20 years of the execution 
and speaks of seeing “‘ some Tokens of that Ditch wherein the Bishopps 
were burned.” (See Elizabethan Oxford, O.H.S. 95.) Wood says ‘‘ where 
now stand a row of poor cottages” (Ann. II, 126). An old engraving 
in Foxe’s Martyrs represents Cranmer watching from the roof of Bocardo, 
and Archbishop Parker thought the site was chosen so that Cranmer 
might see and be intimidated. The exact spot has been much discussed. 
Some prefer the ditch or the brink of the ditch near the Bishops’ Bastion, 
behind the houses now on the South side of Broad Street. Others suggest 
the middle of the street, a little further North, where an iron cross has 
been placed in the road, and where a stake and ashes were found in 1875. 
‘Others prefer a spot opposite the main gate of Balliol, where also stakes 
and ashes have been found. If the Master of Balliol spoke to Cranmer 
from the College tower, it is not impossible that he was burned opposite 
the gateway, and Ridley and Latimer a little further West. (See Mr. 
Hurst’s summary of the evidence, Oxf. Topog. 123-4, and the Proceedings 
of the Oxford Architectural and Historical Society, N.S. III, 314.)

THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION 99 
dressed in a black furred gown. Latimer wore his rough frieze 
and under it a shroud. They were chained to the stake by the 
middle. Bags of gunpowder were hung about their necks. And 
Latimer’s immortal words of comfort to his colleague closed a 
scene which must have lingered for a lifetime in the memory of 
those who stood beside his grave. 
Within a month of this tragedy at Oxford Gardiner died at 
Whitehall. A few weeks later the Pope pronounced sentence 
against Cranmer, and in February 1556 two Bishops, Thirlby 
and Bonner, arrived in Oxford to complete the work. This time 
the Court was held at Christ Church. Cranmer was summoned 
before it, and Bonner has been charged with taunting the accused. 
“This is the man that like Lucifer sat in the place of Christ upon 
an altar to judge others ; and is now come before an altar to be 
judged himself.” Thirlby’s attitude was very different+ An 
old friend of Cranmer, he wept to see his degradation. It was 
“the most sorrowful action of his whole life.” The Archbishop’s 
robes were stripped off and the crozier taken from him. His 
hair was cut close, his finger-tips scraped where the consecrated 
oil had touched them. Dressed in a poor gown and a common 
cap he was led back to prison,? and great pressure was put upon 
him to induce him to recant. Pole had already sent him a long, 
teproachful letter. Spanish Friars and others worked upon 
his impressionable mind. And, whatever uncertainty attaches 
to some of the alleged confessions, there is little doubt that in 
the pitiful days which followed he was induced to compromise 
if not to surrender his beliefs. On the 2oth March he was visited 
in prison by Henry Cole, now Provost of Eton, who was to preach 
before him at the stake, and on the following morning he may 
have acquiesced in yet another form of recantation * before he 
was led out to die. The day was wet. Cole’s sermon was de- 
livered in St. Mary’s. Cranmer, an “image of sorrow,” placed 
on a platform opposite the people, was invited to renounce his 
errors once again. And then, kneeling first in prayer, he rose 
and delivered to the startled congregation his memorable con- 
fession and defiance, renouncing not his faith but everything 
which he had written against the truth for fear of death. Stopped 
and borne out of the church to the open ground by Balliol College, 
1 Thirlby has a claim to interest as the first and last Bishop of West- 
minster. He was Bishop of Ely in 1556. 
2 One tradition says that he was taken first to the Deanery and strongly 
urged to submit. He may have been taken there later. 
8 This has been questioned, and on the whole subject of the recantations 
points of doubt exist. Among modern writers opinions vary as widely 
as among their predecessors. Canon Dixon discusses the difficulties 
fully, though not conclusively (Church Hist., IV, 491 sq.). But see his 
references and notes,

  he moved so fast that the crowd could scarce keep up. The 
Friars ran after him, exhorting him in vain. His strength had 
returned in full measure. His deep humiliation had won pity 
even from his foes. And the spectacle of the frail spirit con- 
quering its weakness, and strung to rare courage at the near 
approach of death, touched, as a by-stander, a Catholic, admitted, 
the common humanity of mankind. 
Pole was appointed to the See of Canterbury. Queen and 
Cardinal alike had taken Oxford into favour. Under Mary the 
privileges of the University were confirmed. Benefices were 
bestowed upon it. Exemptions from subsidies were granted. 
Bequests for poor scholars were left by the Queen’s will. The 
Chancellor, Wood says, was authorised to absolve heretics and 
to reconcile persons to the Church of Rome.? The Star Chamber 
supported him when the citizens refused to allow the University 
Steward to try a felonious Fellow of Balliol in the Guildhall. 
But Oxford had its own examples of the spirit of persecution, 
in the indignities offered to the dead body of Peter Martyr’s wife, 
and in the treatment meted out to one of the younger Fellows 
of Magdalen, who had the misfortune to change his opinions out 
of season. Julins Palmer had been a zealous Catholic and had 
suffered deprivation under Edward. Generous and indiscreet, 
he ‘“‘ could in no wise dissemble,”’ in days when to dissemble was 
the only path to safety. Too late, or too early, he took to study- 
ing Calvin. He marvelled at the firmness of the Protestants 
under trial. He was shocked by their deaths. From the burning 
of Latimer and Ridley he came away bitterly indignant. He 
could not meet the Catholic leaders in Oxford any more. Re- 
linquishing his Fellowship for the second time, he left the College 
and became a schoolmaster at Reading. But his conduct had 
roused suspicion. The heresy-hunters were on his track. Even 
his mother, it seems, forsook him. He was seized and tried and 
burned at Newbury, and his untimely fate moved the compassion 
of a far wider circle than his Oxford friends. 
Pole had once been a member of Palmer’s College. He was 
now Chancellor both of Oxford and of Cambridge—Sir John 
Mason with his usual adroitness had withdrawn; and in that 
capacity he issued a new Commission for University reform. 
A leading spirit among the Commissioners was Nicholas Orma- 
netto of Padua, the Pope’s Datary,? whose arrogant methods 
soon made him unpopular. Bishop Brooks and Henry Cole,

THE UNIVERSITY AND THE REFORMATION tor 
two conspicuous instruments of the reaction, may not have been 
much better loved. But Morwent, by this time “an old and 
frugal father,’ and Wright, who had acted as Vice-Chancellor 
under Cox, were at least in a position to know the value of more 
moderate opinions. The Visitors were required to ascertain 
if the University’s ancient Statutes were observed—King 
Edward’s had already been abandoned—and if the Schism had 
made changes which derogated from them. They showed zeal 
in inquiring after heretics, in destroying Protestant literature, 
in burning English bibles in the market-place. It is not likely 
that there were many well-known Protestants left in Oxford to 
remove. But Wood relates that the remnant of the Reformers 
found a refuge in the house of Garbrand Herks,! a Dutchman, 
in St. Mary’s parish, meeting for worship in a cellar underground. 
Pole’s name is unhappily associated with the policy of perse- 
cution which did more than anything else to destroy the in- 
fluence of the old religion. But in his attachment to the faith 
which he had learned to love as a boy at Oxford, he showed 
himself always a single-hearted man.? 
The Injunctions which he sent to the University in November 
1556, made, in those days of rapid political changes, no great 
mark on Oxford life. But they were part of a large scheme of 
reform, and their efforts to improve discipline were repeated 
later. The Cardinal invited his Commissary, Thomas Rainolds, 
to appoint two or three representative men from each Faculty, 
with the consent of the Greater Congregation, to revise the 
ancient Statutes and report to him. In the meantime he issued 
certain regulations which have an interest of their own. He laid 
stress on the need of rooting out heresy. He strengthened the 
movement which was driving students into Colleges. He dwelt 
on the duties of Principals of Halls. He recognised the import- 
ance of the Heads of Houses and the part which they ought to 
play in the Congregation of Regents. He made rules for the

Fellow of New College, from Oxford city, in March 1560 (Boase, Register,

partition, remains. 
2 Apart from the important Lambeth MS. quoted below, we have 
no contemporary account of Pole’s Visitation at Oxford comparable for 
interest with the account given by John Mere, one of the Cambridge 
Bedels, of the Visitors’ doings there. 
* These Statutes will be found printed for the first time in Mr. S. Gibson’s 
volume (363 sq.). He has very kindly lent me the transcript he made

less exact than the Lambeth MS., is given in Registrum E (83*-86). Cf.

Vice-Chancellor, Proctors and Bedels, for the Clerks of the 
Market, for officials and teachers. He made provision for lec- 
tures and disputations. He drew attention to the needs of dis- 
cipline, to the risks of idleness and bad company, to the demoral- 
ising influences of the town. The Proctors must be twenty- 
five years old and Regents of two years’ standing. The Chancellor 
could reject an unsuitable nominee. Their expenses were to 
be carefully kept and limited. Their inquisition into conduct 
was to range over a wide field. Each Bedel was to keep a book 
with the name, surname and diocese of every scholar of his 
Faculty, with the date of his joining the University. Each 
scholar was to pay twopence for this. The Principals of Halls 
must see to the lectures of their students. They must also see 
to their religion and take them to church. No scholar must 
reside in the town after finishing his twelfth year: every one 
then must join a College or a Hall. The Public Praelectors were 
to lecture on every legible day, and could not escape from their 
duties. There was a touch of pathos in the requirement that 
the Lecturers on philosophy, who had to treat questions like the 
eternity of the world and the immortality of the soul, should as 
far as possible follow the opinion of those who differed least from 
Christian truth.1 There was a touch of liberality in the ad- 
monition that scholars wishing to question or to argue with 
their Lecturers should be kindly handled and have their doubts 
removed. 
But neither Pole’s schemes nor his Injunctions were destined 
tolastlong. Wood suggests that stricter discipline led to a falling- 
off in numbers, that a great scarcity of Divines, Civilians, even 
Masters of Arts, marked the last years of the Queen’s unhappy 
reign. Once again he laments the few degrees taken,? the 
neglect of lectures and sermons, the low level of learning, the 
decay of Greek. Jewel, soon after, coming back from exile, wrote 
dum in vniuersitate sunt presentes, in numero regentium habendos 
decernimus, et id pro deliberato et obtento habeatur in quod due partes 
inibi presentium cum commissario expresse consenserint ’’ (Gibson, 365). 
The granting of Graces is here connected with the Congregation of Regents ; 
but nothing of importance may be decreed unless it has been first put 
forward in the next preceding Congregation. Pole’s ordinances for Cam- 
bridge were more elaborate, and among other things gave Doctors, Heads 
of Houses and Bachelors of Divinity special powers in electing the Vice- 
Chancellor. (See Lamb, 237 sq., and Peacock, Observations, 39-40.) 
1“ Qui de illis rebus minus a veritate Christiana dissentiant.” (I 
quote from Mr. Gibson’s transcript of the Lambeth MS.) 
2 Annals (II, 135). But the figures given by Mr. Boase in the Uni- 
versity Register do not altogether confirm this view. Mary’s reign shows 
no special falling off in degrees as compared with Edward’s, unless it be 
in divinity. In 1557, it is true, only 27 B.As. seem to have been admitted. 
But the number rose to 70 in 1558 and fell to 55 in the following year.

to Peter Martyr that ignorance and obstinacy in Oxford had 
wonderfully increased, and commented with unrestricted 
candour on the scandalous lives of certain leading figures there.1 
Most men, no doubt, felt the shadows hanging over the future 
and realised the effect which the violence of the Romanists 
must produce on English minds. But it is not clear that Queen 
Mary’s influence at Oxford was much more depressing than her 
father’s, and Twyne has stated that studies and discipline 
flourished in her day.2. Even Wood admits that there were 
brighter spots in the picture. At Oriel William Allen, the future 
Cardinal, maintained the old traditions? At Merton Jasper 
Heywood, poet and Jesuit, “‘ bore away the bell ” for disputation, 
and his College friend David de la Hyde, hardly less famous 
for his wit and learning, delivered a great oration in his honour 
as a Christmas Lord of Misrule.* Balliol, Lincoln and other 
Colleges also had their redoubtable Sophisters. There were 
scholars still at Oxford ‘‘of no small account.’’ Above all, 
better days for the University and for the country were at hand. 
In November 1558, when the last of the Protestant martyrs 
died at Canterbury, it was known that the Queen and the Cardinal 
were dying too. Pole lingered a few hours after his mistress, 
to hear the joy-bells ringing for Elizabeth’s accession. And 
the nation turned with deep relief to new ideals of faith and of 
authority, to a new confidence in English freedom. 
1 See the Zurich Letters (Parker Soc., I, 11 sq.). Two Professors 
were compelled to resign for immorality, and Weston was deprived of 
preferments by Pole for a similar cause. 
2 “ Colebantur Studia, enituit Disciplina ’—no doubt, a general state- 
ment. (See Preface to the Laudian Statutes. But Twyne is respon- 
sible for very little of the Preface in its final form.) 
% Allen became Principal of St. Mary Hall in 1556. He was elected 
to an Oriel Fellowship in 1550, as a probationer. 
« Heywood had to resign his Merton Fellowship for sundry mis- 
demeanours. But Pole recommended him for one at Trinity, and he 
held one for a time at All Souls (D.N.B.).

CHAPTER XIII 
ELIZABETHAN OXFORD 
HE Emperor Charles may have given Queen Mary a 
bad husband. But he also gave her wise advice. Let 
her above all things be a good Englishwoman, and not 
too hasty at the beginning in altering what she found amiss. 
Elizabeth understood by instinct the lesson which her sister 
never learned. Committed as she was to support the Refor- 
mation, she was determined not to go too fast. When an Oxford 
deputation, headed by Tresham,? presented her with a loyal 
address, she received it with a flowing kindness and promised 
to show herself the University’s friend. She confirmed its 
privileges and exemptions. She checked unseemly preaching 
and ill-considered change. She would probably have been more 
willing than most of her advisers to maintain old practices un- 
altered. And while suspending academical elections and ap- 
pointing a Commission to visit the University afresh, she intended 
as far as possible to avoid extremes. 
But with two parties in strong opposition circumstances 
forced the Government’s hand. The Queen’s first Parliament, 
which met in January 1559, promptly repealed the Marian 
legislation. The Act of Supremacy imposed an oath on all 
persons taking Orders or University degrees.2 The Act of 
Uniformity revived the Prayer-Book and ritual of King 
Edward’s day. On the other hand, Convocation led by the 
Bishops protested its belief in the Mass and in the Pope, and 
the Universities were said to be ready to endorse this plea.? 
The Bishops were practically unanimous in resisting change. 
Only one took the Oath of Supremacy.‘ Even Oglethorpe, 
who had crowned Elizabeth, refused it. Bonner was the first 
to be deprived, but other Bishops soon suffered the same fate. 
Bonner died in the Marshalsea later. Several of his colleagues

of Arundel was elected Chancellor in January 1559. Sir John Mason 
succeeded him in June. The race of lay Chancellors had definitely begun.

were sent to the Tower. Other Sees were rendered vacant by 
death. ‘‘ Bishoprics,’”” wrote Jewel to Peter Martyr, “ will 
shortly become very cheap.” Before many years were over 
most of the Marian Bishops had passed away. The mass of 
the clergy were at first hostile or suspicious. But they proved 
more willing than their leaders to accept the new arrangements, 
and it seems clear that no very large number of them were 
deprived. 
The Oxford Visitors of 1559 shared the cautious spirit of their 
head, the Chancellor Sir John Mason. Their names are variously 
given: but it seems not unlikely that Richard Cox was one, 
that Walter Wright, whom no revolutions could displace, was 
another, and that Warner, restored to All Souls, was a third.? 
Cox, who had shaken off the controversies of Frankfort and was 
soon to be made Bishop of Ely, had a long experience of Uni- 
versity business. Wright was a model of non-resistance. Though 
blind of one eye he was “ very acute and clear-sighted in mind,” 
and he had lately recanted his Romanist opinions “ with a low 
voice but strong arguments” in All Saints’ Church. Warner 
was equally willing to avoid extremes. And there was need 
for caution, if Jewel was right in telling the Reformers that 
there were scarcely two individuals at Oxford who thought 
with them. The College Chapels were quietly purged of 
“superstitious.”’ uses. Cardinal Pole’s Injunctions were dropped. 
Some ejected Fellows were restored. Exiles like Laurence 
Humfrey and William Cole came back, Others like Cox and 
Jewel passed on to greater positions. A limited number of 
decided Romanists were removed at once, others more gradually 
as time went on. Marshall lost the Deanery of Christ Church 
and is said to have died in prison. Tresham refused the Oath 
of Supremacy and retired finally to a country living. Richard 
Smith, committed to the custody of Archbishop Parker, pro- 
duced another recantation. But “ giving Matthew the slip” 
he escaped to Douai, and became a chaplain to the King of 
Spain, Thomas Rainolds, Warden of Merton, forfeited his 
place. Cheadsey ceased to be President of Corpus, and shared

2 These are the best known names in Wood’s list (Ann. II, 140-1), 
and they all seem likely appointments. Dr. Gee (130) gives, from Lam- 
beth MS. 959 (f. 424), a different list, in which only two names, Sir J. 
Mason’s and Sir T. Benger’s, agree with Wood’s. But Dean Nowell’s 
and Sir Thomas Smyth’s are included in it. In the Lambeth MS. the 
names of the University Visitors appear at the end of a long list of Royal 
Visitors for the different dioceses of England.

disgrace and imprisonment later with Henry Cole and Harpsfield 
and other notable divines. Seth Holland made way again for 
Warner. The Master of Balliol, the Presidents of Trinity and 
of St. John’s were removed. The Heads of Queen’s and Mag- 
dalen, of University and Lincoln, if undisturbed in 1559, before 
long suffered the same fate1_ The Principal of Gloucester Hall 
went too. The Principal of St. Alban’s followed later. Spanish 
Friars vanished from Oxford, and more than one Professor lost 
his Chair. 
But the number of Fellows ejected in the Visitation was 
probably not large. Some, no doubt, temporised, “in hopes 
that things would take another turn.’”’ Tests and subscriptions 
invite evasion. Some were deprived later. Some changed their 
views and took more decided action as the religious struggle 
became more bitter and acute. Wood gives the names of twenty- 
two Fellows and Scholars who lost their places at New College, 
including men who ultimately passed to Rome, to Douai or to 
Tyburn. But some of these were removed by Bishop Horne, 
and the list, whether exact or not, evidently covers several years. 
St. John’s contributed sooner or later valuable recruits to the 
Romanist reaction. So did Exeter, always a stronghold of the 
old traditions, Trinity, Lincoln, Christ Church, and other Colleges 
too. At Magdalen, under the rule of Humfrey, there must ere 
long have been considerable changes. But there is no evidence 
that many College Fellows were expelled in 1559. Wood names 
only three sufferers at Merton, two at All Souls and two at Corpus, 
one of whom retired for a while to Gloucester Hall.? But even 
1 Changes at Lincoln and University were later. Humfrey did not 
succeed Coveney at Magdalen till 1561. Coveney’s retirement could 
hardly have been due to his not being in Orders. (See Wilson’s Magdalen, 
106.) Dugdale of University was deprived apparently in Nov. 1561 
(Clark, Reg. II, i, 286). Dr. Gee (136) includes the Provost of Queen’s 
among the deprivations of 1559—Wood (Amn. II, 142) makes this a 
year or two later—but he does not mention the Warden of All Souls, 
and he assigns Rainolds to Christ Church. Tierney’s list (Dodd, II, App. 
XLIV) is clearly incorrect. President Belsire of St. John’s owed his 
removal probably to his irregular finance. (See Hutton, St. John’s, 
18-19.) His successor, Elye, was probably deprived for maintaining 
the Pope’s authority before Feb. 1561. 
2 Annals (II, 144-5).- But see also Rashdall and Rait (New Coll. 
114). 
8 James Fenn. Wood says (Amn. II, 146) that he was ‘“ put by his 
Bachelaur’s Degree for refusing the Oath of the Queen’s Superiority.” 
But he was apparently admitted B.A. in Nov. 1559 (Boase, Reg. I, 240). 
The other Corpus man, William Sheperey, took his B.A. in Feb. 1560 (Ib., 
241). Five Fellows of Trinity, it seems, withdrew in 1560-1, whatever the 
causes (Blakiston, Trinity College, 76). Dr. Gee (Elizabethan Clergy, 136) 
estimates that 10 Fellows of Colleges, including Tresham and R. Smith, 
were deprived in 1559; but his list may possibly be incomplete.
-P-A-G-E-139
  ELIZABETHAN OXFORD 107 
these were not necessarily sufferers by the Visitation. William 
Allen of Oriel, the future Cardinal, found it possible to remain 
at Oxford till 1561, and did not immediately resign his post as 
Principal of St. Mary Hall. Every year, no doubt, the position 
of the Romanists became more difficult. The religious wars in 
France raised dangerous expectations. The Papists in England 
were said to be immense in numbers, though for the most part 
concealed.? The year 1562 produced a new Ecclesiastical Com- 
mission, and a list of recusants of that date or rather later? has 
interesting notes on various Oxford Catholics then under super- 
vision. Alexander Belsire, ex-President of St. John’s, is entered 
as ‘‘old, wealthy and stubborn.”” Thomas Harding is described 
as once an earnest preacher, but “ now stiff in papistry and 
thinketh very much good of himself.’ David de la Hyde is 
“very stubborn,” and is not to come within twenty miles of 
either University. Dr. Tresham is to remain in Northampton- 
shire—“a man whose qualities are well-known.” Marshall is 
mentioned, and “ Philip Morgan” late of Oxford, and Hen- 
shawe the ex-Rector of Lincoln. Cheadsey is in the Fleet, with 
John Harpsfield and others. Other “ wilful scholars’ appear, 
who are to be restrained from rejoining the University, but who 
are not otherwise molested. Until the danger from abroad 
increased, and threatened excommunication, conspiracy, re- 
bellion, Elizabeth’s Government had no desire to make men of 
learning suffer for their faith. 
Nor is there more truth, it seems, in the allegation that the 
Visitation emptied the University and brought learning low.‘ 
The number of men admitted to degrees or supplicating for them 
in the early years of Queen Elizabeth varied little from the 
number under Mary. The average was between sixty and 
seventy, if the records are correct.5 The list rose with a bound 
to a hundred and twelve in 1566, the year when the Queen visited 
Oxford. It exceeded a hundred and fifty four years later, but 
fell sharply in 1571. There may be more foundation for the 
statement that preachers were deficient: and if the most fre- 
quent University preachers were uncompromising Protestants 
1 It is clear from the University Register that some men mentioned 
as expelled from Colleges took degrees at Oxford after 1559.

before, nor much later than, August 1562. It includes “one Ely, late 
Master of St. John’s,”

5 Compare the numbers given by Boase (Register, I) for 1553-58 
with those given for 1559-64. Individual years fluctuate a good deal. 
In 1558 the number seems high, in 1557 unusually low. The records 
may be incomplete, but the general inference is the same.
-P-A-G-E-140
ro8 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
like Humfrey and Sampson, it is intelligible that Oxford Catholics 
hesitated to attend their sermons. Sampson, installed after 
1561 in the Deanery at Christ Church, was among the most stiff- 
necked of Puritan divines. In vain the Secretary of State re- 
minded him that obedience was better than sacrifice. Nothing 
would induce him to wear the prescribed clerical apparel, and 
Humfrey on that point was little less strait-laced. Humfrey 
had already begun to earn the title of ‘‘ Papistomastix,”’ and to 
* stock his College with a generation of Nonconformists.” But 
Oxford was still far from tolerating the spectacle which, if 
Wood’s tale be true, it allowed in later years, of a layman march- 
ing into St. Mary’s and delivering himself from the pulpit in 
these words : 
“I have brought you some fyne Bisketts baked in the oven of 
Charitie, carefully conserved for the chickens of the Church, the 
sparrows of the Spirit and the sweet swallowes of Salvation.’’? 
In the early years of Queen Elizabeth there were, no doubt, 
signs of disturbance. They are common enough in times of 
transition and, it might be added, in most periods of Oxford 
history. There were troubles sometimes with the town. The 
Bailiffs in their ‘‘sauciness’’ resisted the University officers. 
The citizens were quick to note the decline of clerical privilege. 
But a brewer who disobeyed the Vice-Chancellor’s regulations 
was sent to prison, and the Under-Sheriff with him. The High 
Sheriff summoned the Vice-Chancellor before the Star-Chamber, 
but Leicester’s influence proved too strong for Sheriff and brewer 
alike.2 The University continued to exercise its privilege of 
licensing brewers and bakers in Oxford. One Register gives a 
list of some fifty-eight persons, with several women among them, 
admitted to brew during Queen Elizabeth’s reign. The academic 
authorities settled the days for brewing and fixed the prices to 
be charged. They issued licenses to ale-sellers and vintners, 
and to booksellers who found it necessary to keep an inn as well.* 
They watched narrowly the booksellers’ transactions with un- 
thrifty scholars who had books to dispose of. They kept an eye, 
no doubt, on Barnes’ shop, the bookseller’s at the West end of 
St. Mary’s, where on Saturday nights men gathered to hear the 
London news. They looked after the bakers and the colour and

Sheriff of the county. He had been licensed apparently to preach

quality and stamping of their loaves. They appointed and 
supervised the University carriers. In 1575 the London carrier 
left for the capital on Wednesday and had to be back by Saturday 
at latest.1 His charges were two shillings and fourpence for a 
hundredweight of goods, for small wares not more than a half- 
penny per pound, for lutes and virginalls a rate of their own. 
There were other carriers for other places, Worcester, Lincoln- 
shire, Windsor and elsewhere, but none so famous as Thomas 
Hobson of Cambridge, and no Milton to immortalise their names. 
The Exeter carrier obtained from Convocation a sealed license 
as “ Tabellarius a partibus occidentalibus ad Academiam Oxon.” 
Occasionally a carrier failed: Richard Smout’s bankruptcy 
caused great inconvenience, and Convocation had to appoint a 
committee to advise about his debts. 
The claims of privileged persons, of booksellers and other 
tradesmen, of barbers, cooks and other servants not residing within 
College walls, were again a constant source of friction between 
the University and the City. In 1576 the Mayor tried to make 
them contribute to a subsidy. But summoned before the Vice- 
Chancellor and shown “‘ the privilege of Henry VIII,” he declared 
that he had not known of its existence and would never so offend 
again.?, Next year, when the City sued a privileged person for 
“ exercising manual arts,” the University determined to stand 
by him. But it was a fair claim that no man should enjoy the 
privileges of both University and town. In Elizabeth’s reign 
there were many such struggles over points of privilege and law. 
The citizens would have dearly liked a monopoly of trade. The 
University was determined to control it. The University was 
resolved that the Mayor and fifty-eight burgesses should renew 
each year the ancient oath to maintain its liberties and customs. 
The Matriculation Statute of 158r took occasion to insist upon 
it. The citizens who regarded the oath as an infringement of 
their independence, resisted and evaded it whenever they dared.‘ 
Too often there was serious trouble from sickness to be faced. 
Lectures and disputations had to be suspended. Wood notes 
among other visitations a “‘ violent Plague ” in 1571, and a still 
more mysterious epidemic a few years later, due to infection 
contracted at the trial of a notorious Romanist bookbinder 
1 These days were altered later. See the details in regard to carriers, 
brewers and other tradesmen quoted, chiefly from Register GG, by 
Clark (Reg. II, i, 315 sq.).

* A list of privileged persons is given in Clark (II, i, 288-9, and an 
earlier list in Rogers’ Oxford City Docts. (53 sq.). 
« For citizens taking or not taking the oath see Clark (Reg. II. i, 295 
sq.). The Sheriffs also objected to such oaths (Jb. II, i, 313-4).

    110 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
named Rowland Jencks.1 Six hundred persons, we are told, 
sickened in a night. Three hundred died in five weeks in Oxford 
only, and over five hundred altogether, “of whom many bled 
till they expired.’ To increase the gloom a doleful song was 
published, in which Death boasted of his power to slay : 
“ Thinke you that I dare not come to Schooles, 
Where all the cunning Clerks be most ; 
Take not I away both Clerks and fooles ? 
And am I not in every coast ? 
Assure your selves no creature can 
Make death afraid of any man, 
Or know my coming where or when.” 
Convocation discussed the best way to prevent these pesti- 
lences. Heads of Houses voted money for the sufferers. The 
City once, in 1603, begged the University to contribute to the 
relief of the diseased, “ before you dissolve youre colledgs and 
companies (a thinge moste greivous and lamentable for us to 
heare of).” 
There was trouble of a different kind at Merton, where the 
Romanists, led by the Sub- Warden, tried to revive the old practice 
of singing hymns on Holy days round the fire in Hall, and shut 
their gates against the new Warden, John Man, Parker’s nominee. 
The Sub-Warden was even reported to have given the Warden 
a box on the ear. But his temerity led to his dismissal and to 
the retirement of several of his friends. There was trouble also 
at University College, where Thomas Keys, already notorious 
as one of the worst Registrars the University had had, and 
destined to more enduring celebrity as the champion of Oxford’s 
antiquarian myths, was introduced as Master, in place of a pre- 
decessor less ready to conform. There were serious troubles 
at Corpus. There must have been sharp battles of opinion at 
Magdalen, Christ Church and elsewhere. There were other pre- 
monitions of changes and reforms. At the end of 1564 the 
splendid Leicester became Chancellor in Sir John Mason’s place. 
The University, like all the world, was familiar with his story 
and had already attended the burial of his unhappy wife.2 The 
new Chancellor was determined to make his office a reality, and 
he was of course conspicuous in the memorable visit paid by 
the Queen to the University in 1566. 
There was a note of passionate rejoicing in the welcome given 
to Elizabeth, something deeper than formal compliment in the

Jencks, it seems, retired to Douai. Dr. Clark has gathered together 
notices of epidemics from 1563 to 1606 (Reg. II, i, 157-61).

  eulogies outpoured in prose and verse. She was still young, 
handsome, gracious, uncertain of the future, perilously alone. 
She represented the dearest hopes of the new generation, the 
triumph of a cause for which already many Englishmen had 
died. Every instinct of personal chivalry strengthened the 
ancient loyalty of the people, and the thought of all that her 
life meant to the nation was rarely in those days absent from 
men’s minds. August though it was, the University mustered 
with delight to greet her, called on its ablest orators to show that 
the fame of Oxford and its disputations was not dead. On the 
2gth Leicester appeared, with Cecil and a company of nobles, 
to see to the preparations for his Mistress. On Saturday, the 
31st, the Queen herself arrived. She came from Woodstock, 
where, twelve years before, she had stayed as a prisoner. At 
Wolvercote, the limits of the University liberties, she was met 
by the Chancellor, Heads of Houses and others in their gowns. 
Here Marbeck, Provost of Oriel and lately Public Orator, delivered 
a Latin speech. At the City boundaries the Mayor and Bur- 
gesses received her. Another speech, this time in English, was 
delivered, a cup full of gold pieces presented, and then the pro- 
cession moved on to the North Gate. There one of the younger 
Fellows of New College was waiting with “an Oration in the 
name of all the Scholars.” The scholars themselves lined the 
street to Carfax upon either side. ‘‘ Gratias ago, thank you, 
thank you,” said the Queen in Latin as she passed between 
them, and they cheered her in Latin as they knelt. The citizens, 
no doubt, cheered less learnedly but not less lustily behind. 
At Carfax the Greek Professor had a fresh oration. One account 
says * that the Queen’s reply was interfered with by the restive-

the sonnet, signed ‘‘ Elizabeth, Prisoner,’’ which she is said to have 
written on her window-shutter.

Eton and a Christ Church man. 
3 Bishop Robinson’s (see Eliz. Oxf. 177). Wood (Amn. II, 156-7) 
says the Queen was in a “‘ rich chariot ” and thanked the Greek Professor 
in Greek. Bereblock speaks of an open litter drawn by ‘‘ equi genero- 
siores purpura ornati” (Eliz. Oxf. 117). Stephens suggests that the 
Greek speech was long but well received (Jb. 199). A full account of 
the Queen’s visit is given by Twyne (XVII, 153-67), and is the basis of 
Wood’s narrative: Dr. F. S. Boas has some valuable comments (Univer- 
sity Drama in the Tudor Age, 98). Twyne also gives a short account 
by Miles Windsor (XXI, 792-800). Mr. Plummer has edited in Eliza- 
bethan Oxford four contemporary accounts, the Commentarii of John 
Bereblock, the Topographica Delineatio of T. Neale—a dialogue in Latin 
verse between Elizabeth and Leicester, with brief descriptions of the 
Colleges, etc., which Bereblock illustrated with drawings—the account 
of the Actes done at Oxford by Bishop Robinson, a Cambridge man, and

ness of the mules who drew the Royal litter. From there she 
went on, between lines of Bachelors and Masters, to Christ 
Church, where yet another speech had to be endured. Kingsmill, 
the Public Orator, traced the University’s history from its 
“restoration ’’ under Alfred downwards, and the company 
found the review a little long! But after that and a service in 
the Cathedral Elizabeth was allowed to withdraw to her lodging 
on the East side of the quadrangle. Room was made in Christ 
Church for Leicester, Cecil and others of the Royal retinue. The 
Students and some of the Canons betook themselves elsewhere. 
And the loyalty of dons and scholars alike found vent in Latin 
verses, some of which were set up on the gates and walls. Of 
these Dr. Humfrey’s, which posterity has preserved for us; were, 
it may be hoped, among the worst.? 
Next day the Queen rested. But sermons were preached, 
and a Latin play was performed in Christ Church Hall.4 With 
the play the Spanish Ambassador was particularly pleased. 
Monday passed in visits to the Schools and to New College, but 
the Queen stayed in till night, when she attended the perform- 
ance in Christ Church Hall of the first part of Palamon and Arcyte. 
The author and producer of the play was Richard Edwardes, an 
old member both of Corpus and of Christ Church, who had been 
Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal in 1561. He had 
spent nearly two months at Oxford, seeing to the preparations, 
and his help must have been invaluable in arranging for the 
scenery and dresses and for the staging and lighting of the Hall. 
Though the pressure of the crowd brought down a wall and 
caused a fatal accident, the play passed off with great success. 
Tuesday was a day of disputations. The Queen went on foot 
the Brief Rehearsall of Richard Stephens, drawn out of a longer treatise 
by T. Neale. Nichols in his Progresses of Queen Elizabeth (ed. 1823, I, 
206 sg.) printed or reprinted Wood’s account, Neale’s Topographica 
Delineatio, and Robinson’s narrative ; and in his earlier edition of 1788 
he printed (I, 95-100) also Stephens’ Brief Rehearsall. See also in the 
Corpus Library Miles Windsor’s Collections (I, ff. 190 sq. and II, 139 
sq.), and a few references in vol. IV of Twyne’s Collections and in vol. IV 
of Fulman’s Collections there.

to St. Mary’s, and sat cheerfully through four hours of Latin 
philosophical debates, Respondents, Determiners and Opponents 
all gallantly playing their parts. The powers that governed 
the world of nature, the influence of the moon upon the tides, 
the comparative value of elective and hereditary Princes, were 
among the topics discussed. Special credit fell to Edmund 
Campion of St. John’s, who fifteen years later was to die as a 
Jesuit conspirator at Tyburn, and to Tobie Matthew of Christ 
Church, a future Archbishop, who now first won the favour of 
the Queen. Elizabeth apparently followed the arguments 
closely, and when one of the advocates of elective monarchy 
declared himself ready to die for his opinions, a cry of ‘‘ Excellent, 
excellent ”’ burst from the Royal lips. The walls of St. Mary’s 
were hung with Greek and Latin compliments. Thomas Neale, 
the Professor of Hebrew, had not only presented the Queen 
with a translation of the Prophets, but had described for her 
Majesty’s benefit every College in Latin verse. John Bereblock, 
one of the Fellows of Exeter, had produced by way of illustration 
the earliest drawings of the Colleges which we possess.1 And 
Thomas Keys, now Master of University, presented through 
the Chancellor a little book on the antiquity of Oxford, which, 
while disposing of the claims of Cambridge to precedence, gathered 
together in defence of Oxford all that was most incredible in the 
legends of the past.? 
On the Wednesday there were more disputations, this time 
in Civil Law. The fact that almost all the hours spent by the 
Queen outside the gates of Christ Church were occupied, not in 
visits to the Colleges but in disputations at St. Mary’s, is signi- 
ficant of the part still played by these debates in academic life. 
To see Oxford it was essential to hear Oxford men dispute. The 
Queen spent that Wednesday afternoon hearing academic orators 
discuss the effect of war on civil rights and the effect of a depre- 
ciated coinage upon contracts, topics which have not yet ceased 
1 Bereblock’s original drawings, it seems, are lost. But a copy of 
them, presented to the Bodleian in 1630 by John More, is still preserved 
there. They were engraved in 1713 and have since been reproduced. 
(See Art. on “ Bearblock” by SirS. Lee in D.N.B.). Neale’s productions 
were presented, Wood says on the Monday, Robinson says on the Tuesday. 
Wood adds that Neale translated all the Prophets; Robinson credits 
him only with translating four minor ones. 
8 The provocation came from Cambridge, for which the Cambridge 
Public Orator had claimed priority on the Queen’s visit in 1564. Thomas 
Caius (Keys, Key or Kay) at once wrote his Assertio Antiquitatis Oxon- 
tensis Academiae. John Caius, the second Founder of Gonville, replied, 
and from that time forward the controversy raged. To trace back the 
foundations of Cambridge no further than King Sigebert was regarded 
as an insult (Mullinger, II, 190): but neither side had much regard for 
historical truth. See also Madan (Oxford Books, II, 16-19).

to engage the attention of the world. The latter point was one 
of keen interest to Elizabeth’s advisers, and the Queen was so 
pleased with the arguments of Dr. White of New College that 
she would not allow him to be stopped. At night the second 
part of Palamon and Arcyte was performed. Master Peter 
Carew, the late Dean’s son,! a pretty boy who played the heroine, 
so charmed Elizabeth that he received eight angels for his pains : 
and it seems that even stern John Rainolds, fierce critic of the 
stage in later years, did not decline as a boy of sixteen or seven- 
teen to play Hippolyta on the same occasion. A hunting scene, 
which raised a cry of hounds in the quadrangle and brought 
the scholars crowding to the windows, delighted the Queen. 
And when the Goddess forbade the heroine to lead a virgin life, 
the whole audience broke into irrepressible applause. Elizabeth 
was very gracious to the author, Mr. Edwardes. But when he 
presented his old tutor next day, she told him, laughing, that 
his tutor had never whipped him enough as a boy. 
On Thursday again there were more disputations. Physic 
and Divinity had their turn. Could the medical art prolong life ? 3 
Might subjects take arms against an unjust Prince? Divinity 
apparently covered a wide range. The Dean of Christ Church 
was among the disputants, and Jewel, now Bishop of Salisbury, 
who “ determined,” pointed out in courtly Latin what subjects 
owed their Sovereign amid general applause. But the applause 
increased to enthusiasm when Elizabeth after a little pressure 
from her courtiers rose and delivered a Latin speech. “Since 
first I came to Oxford I have seen and heard many things. I 
have been delighted with them all. For myself I have had 
many teachers, who tried hard to make me learned, but they 
worked upon a barren soil. I know that I am not worthy of 
your praises. But if my speech be full of barbarisms, I will 
end it with a prayer—that you may prosper greatly in my life- 
time and be happy for generations after I am dead.” 3 
That night there was another Latin play in Christ Church 
Hall,4 a gloomy tragedy, which did ‘not take half so well”’ as 
Palamon and Arcyte. On Friday, the last day, there was a Con- 
vocation in the morning. Degrees were conferred. Cecil, Lord 
Oxford and Lord William Howard were among the recipients.® 
Dr. Piers preached a Latin sermon on the duties of the Royal

office, but the Queen was not present. She grieved, she said 
afterwards, to have heard no sermons in Oxford and to have 
seen no Colleges except Christ Church. About dinner-time the 
Vice-Chancellor and Proctors presented her and her retinue with 
gloves. After dinner she mounted her horse and set out for 
Rycote.!| But before the procession started Matthew made a 
farewell speech. Masters, scholars and citizens pressed round 
the cavalcade all the way from Carfax down the High Street 
to the East Gate. Elizabeth’s graciousness, her wit, her easy 
dignity had made her quickly loved. The walls were hung 
with verses bemoaning her departure. The scholars cheered, 
but sadness filled the faces of the people. At Magdalen Bridge 
she bade good-bye to the Mayor and citizens. At Shotover, 
where the University liberties ended, the last orations were 
delivered. Doctors and Masters, who had accompanied her 
riding in their gowns and hoods, took leave. As they fell back, 
the Queen turned and looked down on the beautiful city, 
dreaming in the sunshine of the September afternoon. ‘“‘ Fare- 
well, Oxford,’ she cried. ‘Farewell, my good subjects! 
Farewell, my dear scholars! Pray God prosper your studies ! 
Farewell, farewell ! ”’ 
Royal visits cost money. Christ Church, it seems, spent 
about a hundred and forty pounds.? In December 1566 the 
Chancellor found it necessary to remind the University that 
expenses ought to be borne in common, and that Christ Church 
had been at greater charges than the rest? Leicester, whatever 
his failings, was an active Chancellor. He took a keen interest 
in University affairs, almost too keen an interest in University 
patronage. With Mason, Arundel and Leicester the Chancellor’s 
office had passed into the hands of laymen, and the first lay 
Chancellors of Oxford were persons of distinction, though they 
cannot claim the romantic interest which attaches to the six- 
teenth-century Chancellors of Cambridge, of whom no fewer 
than five were beheaded as traitors. In 1585, when absent 
in the Low Countries, Leicester nominated the Lord Chancellor, 
Sir Thomas Bromley, to act as his deputy. On Leicester’s 
death in 1588, Essex and Hatton were the favourite candidates.

  116 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
When Hatton died in 1591, Lord Buckhurst, recommended by 
some Heads of Houses, was elected in obedience to a peremptory 
mandate from the Queen. But even a lay Chancellor like 
Leicester thought it desirable that the Vice-Chancellor should 
be a divine. At first he left the Vice-Chancellor’s election in 
the hands of the Masters. In 1566 Convocation resolved to 
allow anyone to nominate a candidate,+and Dr. Kennall was 
elected. In 1567 Thomas Cooper was elected, though he failed 
to secure a majority of the numbers voting. But difficulties 
seem to have arisen, divisions of opinion, indecisive votes, in- 
trigues ; and gradually Leicester took the appointment into his 
own hands. In 1568 he wrote to insist on Dr. Cooper retaining 
office for another year—preferring “‘ the common profitt of manie, 
before the priuate ease and commoditie, of one.’ Leicester 
was the first Chancellor to write to the University in English, 
and he seems to have determined that his English should lose 
nothing by comparison with the rhetorical Latin of an earlier 
day. In 1570 Cooper was still Vice-Chancellor, and Leicester 
appointed him again. But Cooper passed on to the Bishopric 
of Lincoln, and the Chancellor, “a great favourer of the Calvin- 
istical Party,” nominated Humfrey in his place—‘‘ a man gener- 
allye for his lief learning and discretion so well likid of, there 
among yow.”* Men of the older school in Oxford must have 
thought discretion the last quality to which Humfrey had a 
claim. 
Leicester not only restored the practice of nominating the 
Vice-Chancellor. He intervened in the appointment of other 
officers. In 1573 he wrote about the appointment of the Esquire 
Bedel of Arts. In 1574, on hearing of disorderly doings in the 
election of Proctors, he ordered that non-residents, ‘‘ discon- 
tinuers from the University for many years,’ who had come up 
“to serve their private turns,” should have no vote. In 1576 
he pressed strongly for the reappointment of the existing Proctors 
in defiance of the rules. ‘‘ You have done the lyke before of 
your selfes. Yow are driven everie day to dispense with your 
statutes.” To that charge the University had no adequate 
reply. Nor could they tell their Chancellor that he was far too 
apt to treat opposition to his wishes as only ‘‘ the fashion of a 
few.’’ When, however, the Masters yielded, dispensed with 
their regulations, and consented to take his nominees, Leicester 
had the grace to promise not to make requests which might 
“tend to ye breache of anie your statutes ” again.®

  ELIZABETHAN OXFORD II7 
In matters of patronage interference was to be expected, 
though Leicester complained of dispensations which were sought 
too readily by lesser men. The Queen interfered often. In 
1581 she invited the New College Fellows to appoint as Warden 
of Winchester a candidate without a University degree. When 
they objected she bade them “‘try him in the Schools” and 
give him any degree it was ‘“‘meet to allow him.” Sussex, 
Knollys and other courtiers asked favours for their friends. 
Great persons, from her Majesty downwards, demanded leases 
of College property. In 1597 Essex asked that his chaplain 
might be made a Doctor of Divinity before starting for Cadiz ; 
but the Grace, though twice asked for, was refused. Leicester 
wrote in 1573 to beg for a dispensation for his “‘ very lovynge 
frend m* Treyvour professour of phisike.” 1 Next year he 
asked the Masters to appoint a Lecturer in Syriac,? and dwelt on 
the importance of lectures and disputations. In 1580 he re- 
commended for incorporation the great Civilian Albertus Gentilis, 
“a stranger and learned and an exile for religion,” and “as I 
ham informed a Dot of the Civile lawes.’’ In 1581 he begged 
for the Italian doctor Fabian Niphus “‘ some convenient place.” 
One day he was pressing the appointment of one of his chaplains 
as Rector of Lincoln. Another day he wanted a quick degree 
for a chaplain of Lord Warwick’s, a preacher with a ‘‘ very 
good gift.” He was less fortunate in his support of Antonio 
Corrano, a Spanish divine, whose “ hot, accusing spirit ”’ made 
him enemies, and whose opinions were viewed with grave sus- 
picion by Rainolds and Humfrey and other staunch Protestants 
in Oxford and abroad. Strong opposition was raised to Corrano’s 
application for a degree. Debates were raised in Convocation 
on the subject. And though Corrano answered his accusers 
and made good his right to lecture at Oxford, it was several 
years before the controversy was allowed to drop.4 
Generally speaking, however, the Chancellor’s influence was 
difficult to resist. He may have had too little regard for regu- 
lations, but he was not indifferent to the University’s interests. 
He may have had less to do than some of his critics have 
suggested with the episcopal Visitations of the time, or with 
the Privy Council’s efforts to enforce the Prayer-Book and to

® Clark (II, i, 149). Leicester called him Albertus Gentilis. Alberico 
or Alberigo Gentili is perhaps a better form. He gave a fresh impetus 
in Oxford to the study of Civil Law. 
« There are many references to this dispute in Wood’s Annals from 
1575 to 1582. See also Clark (Reg. II, i, 153-7) and D.N.B. (under

discourage ‘‘ new rittes and cerimonies of common prayer.” ! 
He was absent, misgoverning the “churls and tinkers”’ of the 
Netherlands, when the Council sent officers to join the University 
in measuring by direct line over hedges and ditches the five miles 
from Oxford where its jurisdiction ran.2 ‘‘We do not meane 
to alowe any more than fiue thousand foote to a mile because 
the Judges have declared that theire is none other measure of 
a mile established by lawe: and the measure... hath bin 
in vse ever since the Romans had government heare in Ingland.” 
But in matters of discipline the Chancellor had the best right to 
be heard. When he pointed out disorders in religion, the danger 
from Romanist leanings among College tutors and elsewhere, 
he was sure of Puritan support. When he complained of the 
neglect of sermons, disputations, lectures, of streets and ale- 
houses full of idle scholars, of tippling, dicing, carding, tabling 
—‘‘I will not say worse ”’—the University may not have found 
it easy to resist. Leicester had no hesitation in pointing out 
the “negligens and slackenesse’’ of teachers and scholars. He 
was determined to have the rules in regard to dress observed.* 
No man was a better judge of ‘‘ excesse in apparell.”” No courtier 
knew more about cut hose, deep ruffs and silks and velvets, 
which he thought so unseemly for students of the University, 
than the magnificent exquisite at its head. 
Leicester has been accused of making sweeping changes. 
But Convocation was alive to the fact that changes were required. 
Many attempts were made to bring the old Statutes into order. 
Committees were appointed to consider them, and many new 
decrees were issued as the reign went on.4 The Registers of 
Congregation and Convocation began to show more traces of 
arrangement. The Registers of the Chancellor’s Court were 
more regularly kept. In 1566 the Great Charter of Henry VIII, 
1 In July 1573 the Vice-Chancellor is described as ‘‘ wount to vse the 
Jurisdiccions of the bisshoppe in shuche matters ” (KK, 148%). 
2 In 1586 (Ib. 351). 
* See his plain words on the subject in 1578 (Ib. 288%). There are 
other references in KK to these subjects (ff. 289%, 314%, etc.). 
« Mr. Gibson’s edition of the Statutes will be the primary authority 
for these, when issued. But Dr. Clark’s Introductions in Pt. I of Vol. II 
of the Register of the University are full of information, and his extracts 
from the old MS. Registers are of great interest. 
® They begin with Reg. Aaa in 1434, but there are gaps in the earlier 
volumes. Reg. GG, on which Dr. Clark draws freely, covers the years 
from 1545 to 1556, but contains some material as late as 1663. The 
Registers of Congregation and Convocation in the Elizabethan period 
are I, KK, L and M, which together run from 1535 to 1606. Dr. Clark’s 
account of these and other Registers in vol. IV of his Life of Wood is 
fuller and later than that which he gives in vol, II of the Register of the 
University (Pt. i, x-xiii).

which for years had been lost or forgotten, was found in the 
Treasury by the University Scribe and brought back to Oxford 
“inviolate and unhurt.” 1 Three or four years later an im- 
portant change bore witness, not only to the growing influence 
of the Colleges, but to the tendency to vest power more and more 
in the hands of the University leaders. On the recommendation 
of a Committee specially appointed to consider the question,* 
the Vice-Chancellor, Heads of Houses, Doctors and Proctors 
were authorised to arrange the business of Convocation before- 
hand, in place of the old Black Congregation, which had fallen 
into disuse. ‘‘Whoe will not thinke it resonable,’ asked 
Leicester, “ y! before y*® convocation, y® vicechauncelor, Doctors, 
heades and proctors should consult of such thinges as are fittest 
to be moved therein?” ? And no one seems to have offered 
an unfavourable reply. 
The Elizabethan Statutes of 1564-5, and in particular the 
Statuta pro Scholaribus, otherwise known as the New Statutes, 
set out afresh the rules for reading, disputations and degrees. 
They differed in some points from the regulations of King 
Edward,® but the books recommended for study were generally 
the same.* They insisted as of yore on exercises and on sermons. 
They noted the removal of ‘“ Austins” to St. Mary’s. They 
abolished obsolete enactments in regard to Masses and pro- 
cessions, monks and friars, the old Statutes against Wycliffe, 
the old rule about Turonensium grossorum in matters of expense. 
They dilated on irregularities in dress, on the needlessness of 
lace and buttons, of swelling linings and waste stuff in hose.” 
1 Reg. KK (f. 31°). 
2 They were appointed in June 1569, “‘ ad definiendum, qua forma, 
imposterum celebrare Convocationes deberent” (Jb. 72). Action was 
taken next year on this report. 
* See Reg. KK (93°), and Wood (Amn. II, 167-8). On June 11, 1570, 
a meeting of the old Black Congregation was called by the Proctors, but 
there seems to have been a general impression that its powers were obso- 
lete (KK, 94»). It became the regular custom for Committees, con- 
sisting generally of the Vice-Chancellor, Proctors and certain Doctors 
and Masters, to draw up Statutes to submit to Convocation. 
‘ For these Statutes see Mr. Gibson’s book (378 sq.), The Nova 
Statuta are given in Regs. A and B and epitomised in C. 
5 E.g. Bachelors of Law and Medicine have now to attend four years 
of lectures for the Doctorate. Nothing is said about practical work in 
Medicine. It may be that the Statutes were not intended to cover the 
whole ground. 
* The Nova Statuta speak of ‘‘ Arithmeticam vel Boetii vel Tunstalli 
vel Gemmephrisii.” They mention Linacre’s grammar as an alternative 
to Priscian’s and Vitellio’s Perspective as an alternative to Euclid. They 
explain that a Book of the Sentences is always to be replaced by a Book 
of Scripture. 
7 The English Statute on “ Apparell” of Dec, 1564 is quoted from 
Reg. KK by Mr. Gibson (391-2).

They substituted for the old right of any single Master of Arts 
to veto any Grace proposed, an inquiry into the circumstances 
which saved the right from abuse.1_ They recited the fines to 
be paid for missing lectures. They divided the Arts student’s 
time anew, reverting apparently to the old ideas which the 
Edwardian Statutes had varied. The four years for the Bachelor- 
ship were now to include two terms for grammar, four for rhetoric, 
five for dialectic, three for arithmetic and two for music.2. Three 
further years, devoted to geometry, astronomy, natural philoso- 
phy, moral philosophy and metaphysics, completed the course 
for the Master’s degree. 
Reform was undoubtedly needed, and in the years which 
followed other important Statutes appeared. There was no 
attempt at codification. But the new necessities were faced 
and the old rules were to some extent re-cast. In March 1566 
voting by Faculties in Convocation was re-established, and the 
Comitia was fixed annually for the first Monday after July 7.° 
In 1574 the election of Proctors was taken out of the hands of 
the Committee which controlled it,4 and vested in the whole 
body of resident Regents and Non-Regents.5 ‘ Conspirators,”’ 
who canvassed for particular candidates before the appointed 
Wednesday after Eastet, were disqualified and punished. 
Scrutineers were sworn to secrecy and fairness, and voters to vote 
only once. In July and October 1576 two detailed and impor- 
tant Statutes attacked “disorders in aparell’’ and in conduct, 
and provided for ‘‘ the better observation of publique exercises.” 
The “Statute of the Relme for Ruffs and hoes’’ was “ put in 
exequution,” and for the generality of students black hats and 
gowns and cloaks were enjoined. Fresh regulations were laid 
down for Determination, lectures, disputations, for enabling 
the Bedels to record the absent and to enforce the necessary 
fines. Preachers out of term were arranged for. Drunkenness 
was denounced for punishment like fornication and adultery. 
2 On this point see also the decrees of May 1567 and October 1583, 
printed by Mr. Gibson (397-8 and 426). 
2 See the Statute headed Lectiones et Mulctae (Gibson, 3809). 
3 Ib. (396-7). Till then there were two Acts for giving degrees, 
in February and July. But men could incept at other times also. (See 
Salter, Regist. Ann. Coll. Merton, xxvi). 
« A Committee of electors nominated by two persons termed Instantes 
whom Convocation chose. The electors and the Instantes were both 
swept away (Clark, Reg. I, i, 243-4). A later Statute of 1593 provided 
for Proctorial vacancies within the year (Gibson, 447-8). 
5 But residence had to be defined : and in 1594 it was found necessary 
to explain that the old rule, excluding from the vote ii qui cum pannis 
abiissent, excluded those who had failed to reside for 6 months before 
the election and to pay for University dues, rooms, books, utensils, 
etc. (See Gibson, 451, Clark, II, i, 246, and Wood, Amn, II. 257-8.)

Hawks and ferrets, dogs and guns were forbidden, but with the 
Vice-Chancellor’s license a ‘‘Spannell” might be kept. Sub- 
scription was insisted on: 
“Item it is decreed that everye one to be admitted to any degree 
shale first in the praesens of the Proctors and his Praesenter being 
together in the Chappell on the North side of S. Maries church sub- 
scribe to the Booke of Articles of Religion, intituled Articles where- 
vpon it was agreed by the ArchBishops and Bishops of both Pro- 
vinces and the hole Clergye in the Convocation houlden at London 
in the yeere of our Lord 1562.” 2 
In 1579 Convocation recommended for study the Catechisms 
of Alexander Nowell, John Calvin, Henry Bullinger, and other 
books which sufficiently indicated the changing temper of the 
times.” 
Hand in hand with these Statutes went new regulations for 
bringing Oxford students under better control. The Matricula- 
tion Statute of 1565 established a Register of all members of the 
University,® divided into twenty-five heads according to Colleges 
and Halls, with details of name and age, locality and status. 
It exacted an oath of fidelity to the University from all persons 
over sixteen. It required all unattached scholars to be under a 
master or tutor in some Hall or College. It compelled all Heads 
of Houses to present their students to the Chancellor or his Com- 
missary within a week of their admission. It settled the fees 
which members of the University were to pay, varying from 
thirteen shillings and fourpence for the son of a Prince, Duke or 
Marquis to fourpence for Plebei filius.4 And it inevitably became 
the precedent for further legislation. In 1580 the Oath of Suprem- 
acy was imposed. In the same year Convocation decreed that 
all scholars still living in the town must be brought into a Hall 
or College. In 158r a new Statute of Matriculation insisted on 
subscription both to the Articles and to the Queen’s Supremacy 
in the case of all students over sixteen, and required all tutors 
to purge themselves of suspicion of Popery if they wished to 
1 No one could present a man whom he had not seen subscribe, nor 
could the Vice-Chancellor admit anyone unless the Proctors testified 
to his subscription (Gibson, 409-10). The 39 Articles did not become 
law till 1571.

omniumque aliarum privilegiatarum personarum iuribus siue libertatibus

392). See also Clark (Reg. II, i, 162 sq.).

retain their pupils.1_ In 1589 Convocation added that no scholar 
must proceed to the degree of Bachelor or Master unless he could 
recite from memory the Articles of the Faith. 
The first Matriculation Register contains lists of several 
Colleges which date from 1565.2. But the lists as a whole do not 
begin till 1572, and for the next ten years they are very imperfect. 
The student’s surname and Christian name were given, his age, 
his county and his father’s rank. Like other Registers this 
was often ill-kept. Entries were sometimes omitted. Names 
were confused. Corrections were inserted. Dates and spelling 
were ignored. Backhouse becomes Bacchus. Vigures or Viguers 
becomes Wild-goose.* Welsh names suggest curious orthography. 
Names destined to be famous in American history, Washington, 
Hawthorne and Emerson, appear. Some of the errors may not 
have been wholly accidental. An Esquire’s eldest son might not 
object to being entered as #/eb. fil. for a low fee on matriculation, 
if on taking his degree he could claim the privilege of shorter 
residence which belonged to his rank. The numbers entered as 
matriculating varied widely in different years. In 158z, an 
exceptional year, they soared suddenly to over eight hundred.® 
They not infrequently exceeded three hundred. They averaged 
fully two hundred and seventy for the last ten years of the Queen’s 
reign. Unattached students were disappearing under pressure. 
There had been eighty-nine residing in the town in 1562,” sus- 
pected generally of Romanist opinions. Subscription to the 
Articles could be avoided if one avoided entering a College or a 
Hall. The list of Christ Church men for 1565 contains two 
  1 Gibson (421-3). The Subscription Books, with the 39 Articles 
and the interesting autographs which follow, are in the University Archives. 
The signatures run from 1581 to 1892, but cease then. The University 
Fee-Books, however, preserve students’ signatures from 1886 onwards. 
4 See Clark (Reg. II, ii, 9 sq.). 
* This became the practice. The details given are fuller from 1622 
onwards. The first Matriculation Register (Univ. Oxon. Arch. P) is a 
large folio volume, running from 1565 to 1615. Thesecond, PP, a smaller 
volume and better kept, begins with a few illustrious names, and runs to 
1647. Dr. Clark has a description of both (Reg. II, i,. viii-x). 
4 Wildgoose became an Oxford name; e.g. the painter employed in 
1715 to renovate the Picture Gallery (Bodl. Quart. Rec. II, 105). And 
before that Mr. Gibson has noted a Bodleian binder, an earlier bearer of 
the name, who bound the First Folio of Shakespeare (1623). 
* See the decree of Jan. 1591, quoted by Clark (Reg. II, i, 13-14). 
* If Dr. Clark’s figures are correct (Reg. II, ii, 410 and 96-117). There 
must have been a rush in the year of the second Matriculation Statute, 
to make up for laxity in previous years. 
’ There are a few entries, which Dr. Clark would date 20 years later, 
of married scholars “‘ having house and familie in the towne.” But 
before the end of the century unattached students had mostly disappeared 
(Reg, II, ii, 5-9 and 44-5).

hundred and eight names including servants. Magdalen has a 
hundred and thirty-two, Exeter a hundred and thirteen, Balliol 
sixty-five, Merton only fifty.1 Of the Halls the largest is St. 
Alban’s with a total of ninety-four, the smallest, New Inn Hall 
with only twelve. Two privileged tutors, John Case and Nicholas 
Balgay, the first a valued Fellow of St. John’s and the latter 
once Master of Magdalen College School, were allowed to take 
students into their houses. We know that Mr. Case’s scholars 
numbered twenty-two as late as October 1583.2, But we know 
also that the policy of driving students into Colleges prevailed. 
All lists of numbers are, no doubt, liable to error. But we shall 
probably not be far wrong in concluding that about the year 
1570 there may have been residing in Oxford some seventeen 
hundred members of the University, Fellows and Scholars, 
students, servitors and servants, and that the University en- 
larged its borders as the reign of Queen Elizabeth went on. 
Before the century ended the new system was in full operation. 
If the students were forced into Colleges, they could at any rate 
change their Colleges freely. John Rainolds with his six Colleges 
is no solitary case. On admission a boy’s name was entered in 
the Buttery-book, where the Bedel looked it up. His tutor was 
chosen. _He appeared before the Vice-Chancellor. The Sub- 
scription Book was signed. Oaths to accept the Thirty-Nine 
Articles, the Prayer-Book and the Royal Supremacy were taken. 
The necessary entries were made in the Matriculation Register. 
The student’s Faculty was settled and his course begun. The 
old educational routine might not command implicit acquiescence, 
but the old forms and the old obligation to attend lectures and 
disputations survived. The Elizabethan Registers are full of 
dispensations for avoiding the strict fulfilment of the old rules. 
A personage like the Duke of Norfolk could of course apply to 
be made a Master of Arts without performing any ceremonies, 
and the Grace was conceded without demur.‘ But dispensations 
were constantly granted to less important people. The applicant 
might have been obliged by poverty to leave Oxford and teach. 
Or he might have received an appointment. Or he was going 
abroad, or he hoped to get a benefice, or the plague had cut 
short his studies, or his father had recently died. Escape from

inconvenient formalities was needed. A candidate could not 
always be present when his Grace was sought in Congregation. 
A Bachelor wished to determine in Lent, though absent on Egg 
Saturday.1 A Doctor could not afford to buy a new gown. A 
Vice-Chancellor was out when the candidate for a degree called 
on him.2. The Bedel who ought to accompany the candidate 
was engaged. The sermons required of theologians could not 
be delivered at the proper time. The sandals and shoes* expected 
of Inceptors were incompatible with infirmity of feet. 
Exceptions of this kind were needed to give elasticity to an 
ancient, rigid system.4 Many of them were reasonable enough. 
It was natural to excuse from Congregation Regents who had 
College duties. It was natural that the Professors and College 
tutors should take over more and more the teaching which the 
Regents were ready enough to give up.5 But the fashion of 
making excuses may have gone too far. And the Elizabethan 
Statutes are full of decrees recalling and revising the old rules on 
the subject. An order of 1563 compelled any man seeking a 
dispensation to call on the Head of his College, a Professor of his 
Faculty ® and two other College Heads to be present. An order 
of 1567 laid down that no man’s Grace was to be proposed in 
Congregation unless he had completed the ‘‘ form” required by 
Statute.? A decree of 1576 forbade Congregation to dispense with 
“any parte or parcell of time by the Statutes appoynted for the 
attaining of the Degree.” ® And a Statute of 1584, reciting that 
“all orderly procedinge vnto our degrees by tolleracions and dis- 
pensacions is almost quite taken awaye,” insisted on the full 
course of years and exercises before any Grace was proposed for 
Bachelors of theology, medicine or law.® Another rule took 
precautions against the false statements made in seeking Graces,

Chancellor and Proctors to summon a Congregation to confer the degree

gation at the grant of Graces on three occasions early in the reign (1559- 
60). The numbers were 10, 15 and 25 (Jb. 161-2). Mr. Salter reminds 
us that Colleges as well as the University granted dispensations to relieve 
Regents of their duty to lecture (Reg. Ann. Coll. Merton, xxxi-ii). 
5 See the notices quoted by Dr. Clark (Reg. II, i, 95 sq.). As time 
passed, it became the practice for certain delegated Regents to deliver 
the ordinary lectures in Arts. The Proctors selected them and the other 
Inceptors paid them.

by which Congregation and even Convocation was wearied and 
fooled.t Others recalled the old obligations: no Bachelor of 
Arts must have his Grace unless he had ‘‘ answered once in 
parvis from one of the Clock till three, and two severall times 
vnder a Bachelour in Determinations in Lent:” ? none must 
read cursorily for his Inception other books than those ordained 
by Statute : and none must fail to determine in the Lent which 
immediately followed the granting of his Grace.4 There was 
probably some inclination to shirk the exercises which completed 
the Bachelor’s degree. The practice had grown up of asking for 
Graces in Convocation, which saved the need of proposing a Grace 
in four successive Congregations; and to prevent this it was 
provided that, even after dispensations had been granted in Con- 
vocation, application to the Congregation of Regents for Graces 
must be made.® It had already been settled that no Grace could 
be coupled with conditions to be afterwards performed.* And 
the practice had been checked by which candidates sought a 
Grace for the Doctorate when they wanted to use the Doctor’s 
title without proceeding to the Doctor’s degree.” 
There were many supplications for Graces which failed. They 
might be refused for misconduct or for heterodoxy, or for other 
reasons besides failure to observe the necessary forms. We find 
one man rejected as moribus inidoneus, another for irreverence, a 
third for “‘ unsound religion.” A certain Robert Smith who kept 
bad company at Magdalen, and brought shameful charges against 
his contemporaries ‘‘in the commen haule of the same colledge 
at eleven of the clocke in the night,” was disqualified at once as 
a notorious offender. A more innocent Smith was refused his 
Grace “‘ through his being supposed to be another person of that 
name.’’® The supplicant might appeal against the decision of 
Congregation, and a Committee was sometimes appointed to 
consider whether such an appeal would lie. There were appeals 
also from the Vice-Chancellor’s Court to Congregation: the 
2 In 1575 (Ib. 403). 2 In 1576 (Ib. 405-6). 
3 In 1579 (1b. 415-16). But the irregularities of the past were over- 
looked. 
“In 1597 (Ib. 455). 5 Dispensations in Convocation were in fact made merely a prelim- 
inary to the grant of Graces by Congregation, and the seeking of a Grace 
in Convocation was forbidden (Gibson, 426; in 1583). 
¢ In 1576 (Ib. 406). 
7 In 1582 (Ib. 424). A pledge worth {10 had to be deposited as 
security that the degree would be taken within the year. 
® Dr. Clark’s volumes on the Register of the University are a store- 
house of such details. Wood mentions the clamour made by the Regents 
when the Grace of an unpopular person was proposed, instead of a quiet 
non-placet in the Proctor’s ear, and Vice-Chancellor James’ high-handed 
attempt to put down such proceedings in 1591 (Amn. II, 246-7). 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  126 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Proctors nominated Delegates who sat in St. Mary’s to hear the 
case. From Congregation there was a further appeal to Convoca- 
tion and, if the University judges differed, a final appeal to the 
Crown. Elizabethan decrees, referring to past Statutes, regulated 
the time for the decision of appeals and provided against frivolous 
delays.1 There was no lack of energy in revising ancient cus- 
toms. But the new rules were not always free from the con- 
fusion of the old, and even the newest Statutes afforded a plenti- 
ful crop of dispensations. 
Under Elizabeth many Committees of Convocation were set 
up to deal with points of difficulty, and many decrees were issued 
by their authority or on their advice.2_ There were Committees on 
procedure, on sermons, on disputations, on fees. A large space in 
the Statutes is occupied by rules for sermons. There were neces- 
sary sermons for degrees. Every Bachelor and Doctor of Divinity 
had to preach a formal Latin sermon after taking his degree, and 
the candidate for the Doctorate had to preach an earlier examina- 
tory sermon also. There were University sermons at St. Mary’s, 
at Christ Church and at St. Peter’s in the East. In 1576 the 
Vice-Chancellor was empowered to call on preachers to take duty 
on holidays and on Sundays in vacation for which no other pro- 
vision had been made.® In 1580 every graduate in theology 
was called on to take his turn in preaching the Latin sermon 
at St. Mary’s on the day before the opening of each term.6 In 
1584 ‘‘ euerye student in deuinitye beinge minister” ? was com- 
pelled ‘‘to preach in his course accordinge to his senioritye.”

2 See for example the notices quoted by Dr. Clark (Reg. II, i, 53, 108-9, 
IIO, I21, 131, 135, 163, 225, 246, 252, 261, 346). 
* On the pro forma sermons for Bachelors and Doctors of Divinity, 
mentioned in 1446, see Mun. Ac. (395-6) and Gibson (267-8). On the 
sermo examinatorius, also called sermo generalis, see Mun. Ac. (307 and 
392). Examinatory sermons, an early institution, are mentioned in the 
Agreement between the University and the Friars in 1314 (Gibson, 116). 
We hear also of sermons ex novo statuto; but this probably refers to the 
Statute of 1446, mentioned above (Mun. Ac. 396), imposing a pro forma 
sermon on. Doctors of Divinity. See also Regist. Ann. Coll. Merton 
(xxviii), where, however, Mr. Salter seems to ante-date this ‘‘ new 
statute.” 
“ Called solennes (Gibson, 451). English sermons were given at St.

Mary’s and none before the Reformation in the afternoon (Reg. Ann. Coll. 
Merton, xxviii).

The Merton Register alludes to the Collators of sermons, who helped the 
Vice-Chancellor to make the list, and had to take the duty if a preacher 
failed (Reg. Ann. Coll, Merton, xxix).
-P-A-G-E-161
ELIZABETHAN OXFORD 127 
  In 1587 Sunday sermons from all competent persons from the 
Vice-Chancellor downward were required.1_ In 1590 all Masters 
of Arts of four years’ standing were reminded of their liability 
to preach? There were also regulations for the licensing of 
preachers. They insisted on a year’s trial in some Hall or College 
first, on a recommendation from a Head of a House,*? and on 
subscription to the Articles and Prayer-Book. And they re- 
stricted a right, which was now becoming more than ever a sub- 
ject of contention, to fully qualified Masters of Arts, who had 
responded in theology * and had preached four of the regular 
University sermons. 
Committees also revised the rules for disputations. A 
Statute of October 1583 regulated the public exercises in theology, 
Civil Law and medicine. They were to be held every term in the 
School of Theology from the first hour to the third, theological 
disputations ten times in the year, those in Civil Law and medicine 
once only in alternate terms.5 The Respondent opened with 
his thesis: he was allowed half an hour but not more. The 
Opponents criticised and answered; * they were limited to a 
quarter of an hour each. The Moderator presided and summed 
up. In 1586 the Lenten disputations were reorganised, and 
negligence and turbulence condemned. “Sterile and inane 
questions,” which differed from the orthodox philosophy, were 
forbidden. The authority of Aristotle was vindicated afresh.? 
Subsequent decrees enforced or amplified these rules,® defined 
1 Gibson (438). 2 Ib. (443). 
8 Or from “‘ the reader of the Q lecture of deuinitye ” (Ib. 420). 
« “Semel saltem in theologia in Schola Theologica, vel in comitiis, 
publice responderit ” (Ib. 430). Two months later (April 1584) sermons 
at All Saints’ and St. Martin’s were allowed to count as well as those 
preached at Christ Church, St. Mary’s or St. Peter’s, 
5 In 1595 the jurists’ ordinary disputations were fixed for Michaelmas 
and Easter terms, the medical ones for Hilary and Trinity terms (Ib. 454). 
® Ib. (427-9). I think the Respondent clearly came first, though a 
high authority, Mr. Salter, has suggested that the Opponent began (Reg. 
Ann. Coll. Merton, xxvi-vii). Mr. Gibson has drawn my attention 
to the passage which Twyne (XX, 120%) has transcribed from Reg. C, 
143*—dated about 1500—in which the old procedure is set out. See also 
Cambridge Grace Book A (xxiv) and Wordsworth (Schole Academica, 
32 sq.). Wood (Annals, II, 161) mentions that in the case of one disputa- 
tion before the Queen in 1566 there were 7 Opponents, of whom some 
were shut out for want of time. ‘The phrase opposuit primo, on which 
Mr. Salter comments, may mean that the speaker was the first of two or 
three Opponents. See also the fourth Royal Edict of 1617 (Gibson, 522). 
7 Gibson (437). 
* E.g. in 1591 fines were imposed for non-compliance (Jd. 444) ; and 
in 1592 a decree declared that no man should seek his Grace for the B.D, 
degree ‘‘ nisi qui semel per duas horas in schola theologica pro forma 
responderit, et semel principalis opponentis munere in disputationibus 
pro forma perfunctus fuerit, aut ter ad minimum, venia vel a publico

128 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
  the Law Moderator’s duties,1 and compelled Masters of Arts,? who 
were not proceeding to theology, tostudy medicine or Law. The 
need for reiterating academic rules was evident. One of the 
earliest Statutes of the seventeenth century rehearsed those for 
disputations in parvisis again? 
Other Committees dealt with many other points. One decided 
that two complete years, not unfinished years, must elapse before 
a Bachelor of theology could seek his Grace for a Doctor’s degree. 
Another revised the rules for the depositions of Bachelors on 
Determination, and regulated the presentation of gloves. Another 
made provision for the cleaning of the streets.4 There was a 
Committee to settle whether the Vice-Chancellor or the Proctors 
had the right to nominate Clerks of the Market. Each side was 
found nominating candidates and administering the oath of 
office to its own nominees.5 There was a Committee on the 
incorporation of Cambridge men at Oxford.6 Was a request 
for such incorporation a dispensation or a Grace? Convocation 
decided that it was a Grace—a liberal ruling, for the fee in that 
case paid to the Registrar was less. Often in these questions of 
procedure the issue turned upon a point of fees. The University 
was a small world, largely ruled by human nature. The smallness 
of official profits and the desirability of increasing them was 
rarely absent from official minds. 
Questions of fees figure largely in the Elizabethan Statutes, 
and Committees were often appointed to discuss them. The 
Bedels had perhaps some reason to complain of their pay. 
Scholars, Bachelors, Masters and Doctors, had to be reminded of 
the ‘“‘culets”’ due.?. The Collectors, who arranged the deter- 
mining Bachelors in classes for their disputations, and who had 
to collect the fees payable to University officials, were accused 
of charging too much. Their fees were limited in 1579.8 The

allowed to confer the same academic status as they enjoyed in their own. 
See the decree of 1576 (Gibson, 411, and Clark, Reg. II, i, 345 sq.). Con 
versely Oxford men might count time spent in other Universities for their 
degrees (Gibson, 424).

century began (Clark, Reg. II, i, 109).

Proctors had secured their nomination, and were perhaps sus- 
pected of encouraging their exactions. In 1586 the election of 
Collectors was restored to the determining Bachelors.t Wood 
mentions a sharp quarrel in the closing years of the reign between 
the Vice-Chancellor on the one hand and the Proctors and Col- 
lectors on the other.2 A decree of 1581 assigned half of the 
“‘profites growinge owte of the matriculacion ” to the “ squire 
bedell of deuinitye,” one-fourth to the “ squire bedell of lawe,” 
and one-fourth to the Vice-Chancellor.? In 1588 the fees payable 
to the University Registrar were re-cast. The price for a dis- 
pensation in Congregation was to be six pence, for one in Con- 
vocation twelve pence. The admission fee for a Bachelor of 
Arts was put at four pence, for a Master at six pence, fora Doctor 
at eighteen pence. They had to pay for Graces also. The cost 
of degrees tended togoup. Fees in lieu of banquets were required 
from Bachelors if no banquet was forthcoming. Fees due to the 
Yeomen Bedels were increased. In 1592 a Statute fixed the 
charges for rich young men taking the Bachelor’s degree before 
the end of their fourth year: an esquire’s eldest son was to pay 
sixteen pence for his Grace and twelve pence for admission, the 
son of a Lord of Parliament five shillings for each. It was 
added that fees for Graces must be paid on the spot, before Masters 
left the House of Congregation. At the end of the reign the 
Bedels’ dues were again increased,’ and there was a comprehen- 
sive revision of the whole scale of fees. 
The Statute of December r160r set out in great detail the 
cost of degrees and the payments due to University officials. 
The Esquire Bedel of Arts now received for culet eight pence a 
year from every Bachelor and four pence from every scholar in 
a College. Members of Halls paid less. The Bedels’ culets in 
the superior Faculties were higher ; six shillings and eight pence 
was paid by every Doctor of Divinity,® three and four pence by 
every Bachelor, one and eight pence by every Master of Arts. 
The Registrar’s admission fee for a Bachelor of Arts was now 
six pence, and for a Master eight pence.!° The ordinary fees for 
a Bachelor of Artscame to six and six pence on admission, and 
five and two pence on Determination ; for a Master they were

eight and seven pence on admission, and fourteen and seven pence 
on Creation The Bachelor of Divinity, if an M.A. already, 
paid under ordinary circumstances two pounds, and the Bachelor 
of Medicine a few shillings more. The Doctor of Divinity paid, 
apart from possible extras, four pounds, nineteen and ten pence on 
admission, and five pounds, seventeen and ten pence at the Act. 
The Doctor of Medicine paid seven pounds, sixteen and six pence. 
For different classes of candidates the charges varied a good deal. 
Those who could best afford it were expected to pay most. A 
candidate for a degree had to answer inquiries about his income. 
A man who could spend five shillings a year of his own was called 
a petty compounder. A man who could spend forty pounds a 
year was a grand compounder. Both had to pay additional 
fees, and the grand compounder very large ones.4 There were 
also demands for wine and gloves, for clothes and feasts and other 
items. The rich man had the advantage which he has in all 
ages, but on the other hand he was regarded as fair prey. 
One example taken from this Statute 5 may perhaps serve to 
illustrate the rest.

Debates in Convocation revealed many technicalities, the 
meaning of which—so venerable were they—was not always 
clear to the Masters themselves.1 The presentation for the 
Doctorate of Civil Law was accompanied by a strange old cere- 
mony called Nemo Scit. The candidate produced a purse which 
he swore contained not less than six pounds, thirteen shillings 
and four pence ; but nobody knew how much there was in it. 
His presenter and deponents helped themselves to its contents 
at their pleasure, and returned the rest to him. The candidate 
naturally disliked the practice. The Bedels, who gained nothing, 
petitioned against it. But for long the time-honoured practice 
held its own.?, Humour crept into the ancient ceremonial.

  132 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
ceptors’ disputations at the Vesperie and the Comitia, delighted 
their contemporaries with solemn fooling at least as early as 
Shakesperian days.1 Disputations afforded opportunities of 
discussing an infinite variety of topics—whether the sea was salt, 
whether women were happier than men, whether gold could be 
made from the baser metals, whether impudence was more toler- 
able than shyness. In 1589 candidates for degrees debated 
whether Heaven had made Englishmen stronger than Spaniards. 
In 1609 they discussed—Shakespeare had no monopoly—a man’s 
rights in the taming of a shrew. Subjects as various as Free 
Will, Papal enormities, the justice of war and the use of poison 
in waging it, the prolongation of life by medical art—perhaps a 
doubtful possibility in medizval Oxford—the character of actors, 
the superiority of ale to beer, enlivened the studies of the Schools.? 
Leonard Hutten in 1600 had to consider whether “in renatis ” 
concupiscence was a sin. William Laud in 1608 had to decide 
—he must have revelled in the opportunity—whether a Bishop 
only could confer Orders. We still have on record the questions 
for Inception in Theology which Hovenden, Bond and Prideaux, 
well-known Heads of Colleges, were called on to debate. 
Old traditions needed readjusting as old practices declined. 
Grammar degrees were dropping out.? Canon Law degrees had 
ceased already, and Fellowships granted for that study were 
passing to laymen for the study of Civil Law. Degrees in Music 
were still rare.® Only thirteen are recorded in the last thirty 
years of Elizabeth’s reign *—among them John Bull, the famous 
organist, Nathaniel Gyles, the Magdalen chorister who became 
Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal, and John Dowland, 
whose melodies delighted his age: 
“Dowland to thee is deare; whose heauenly tuch 
Vpon the Lute, doeth rauish humaine sense.” ? 
  
1 We have their names from 1591 to 1763, and some fifteen of their 
speeches. The earliest speech known is that by Thomas Tomkins in 
1607. (See Bodl. Quart, Rec. III, 123-4, the Laudian Statutes, Tit. VII, 
and Hearne’s Collections, O.H.S., I, 188-90). 
® See the long and interesting list of Quaestiones collected by Dr. 
Clark (Reg. II, i; 169-218). 
® The last recorded is in 1568 (Boase, Reg. I, 269). See also Clark 
(Reg. II, i, 8), where, however, Bedoe’s degree is misdated : it should be 
1558 (Reg. I, 237). 
« Clark (Reg. II, i, 111-12). But the Statute of 1601 on fees refers to 
Bachelors’ degrees in grammar and in Canon Law (Gibson, 475 and 481). 
5 The ordinary music lecture, often dispensed with, was still part of 
the Arts course.

The Medical School was still lamentably weak. Even Linacre 
had done little to make it efficient ; his great bequest had little 
influence on medical education in Oxford for three hundred years. 
The Faculty had no Bedel of its own. Doctors of Medicine were 
exempted from attending Congregations. There was seldom a 
Doctor available to act at Inceptions.1 Regents in medicine 
left lecturing to the Professor : * it was more profitable to attend 
to their practice. Real students sought instruction abroad. 
Medical degrees were few and were sometimes given carelessly. 
The College of Physicians had complained to Cardinal Pole of 
the admission of ignorant and unlettered men. They quoted 
the scandalous cases of Ludford, a Franciscan Friar who became 
an apothecary in London, and of Laughton, a coppersmith, who 
when asked to decline the word corpus had replied “ hic, haec et 
hoc corpus, accusativo corporem.” Ludford, the Friar, uplifted 
by a “ blind audacity,” betook himself to Cambridge, and ultim- 
ately won honours in his profession. Laughton, the coppersmith, 
was less persistent. His Latin Grammar weighed him down.? 
These cases may have been exceptional, but there seems to have 
been little improvement under Elizabeth. Licenses to practise 
in medicine and surgery were issued: but their number was by 
no means large. In the thirty years from 1571 to 1600 less than 
fifty medical degrees of all kinds are recorded, thirty-five licenses 
in medicine and only one in surgery. The records may be faulty, 
but the numbers are significantly small.4_ Licenses to preach were 
commoner than licenses in surgery.5 Licenses to beg were still 
issued to poor scholars under the Vice-Chancellor’s seal. The 
traditions of the past were still powerful in Oxford. And there 
was little room for science to develop while theological conten- 
tions filled the minds of men. 
In the realm of legislation Tudor administrators kept a watch- 
ful eye on University affairs. In 1571 an Act of Parliament

incorporated both Universities The right of perpetual succes- 
sion was secured to the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of Oxford. 
The charters and liberties granted to them were confirmed by 
law. Other Acts limited College leases to terms of three lives 
or twenty-one years. A blow was struck at the prodigal system of 
fines, under which the Fellows granted long leases at low rents, 
and by levying large fines, to anticipate revenue, benefited their 
own generation and impoverished their successors.2, A more 
popular Act, for the better maintenance of Colleges, required 
that in all new College leases the lessee should pay one-third at 
least of the old rent in corn or malt at a fixed price,? and thus went 
far to secure the Colleges against the failure of harvests, which 
had been no imaginary danger in days past. But, as prices rose, 
this Act in effect provided a substantial new endowment for 
the Fellows, a “ happie helpe ’’ which led enthusiasts to describe 
it as the “most blessed and gracious statute” of the time. 
Equally important, if less popular with the Colleges, was the 
action taken by Parliament to put down the buying and selling 
of Fellowships and Scholarships, and to suppress bribery in 
elections at Oxford and Cambridge. The first Bill which passed 
the two Houses on the subject was indeed stopped by the Queen. 
But University reformers like Whitgift persisted, and in 1589 
the proposal passed into law.4 Whitgift’s activity at Cambridge, 
and the commanding influence he won there, had its effects in 
education as well as in the Church. In 1583, on his appointment 
to-the See of Canterbury, he became the Visitor of Merton and 
All Souls, and he was soon raising his vigorous voice against 
Oxford abuses, against the neglect of discipline and study, the 
“intolerable carelessness”’ of Heads of Colleges, the degrees 
given to the unlearned and the unfit. 
The Cambridge Statutes of 1570 were designed by adminis- 
trators like Cecil and Whitgift to check the “ increasing audacity 
and excessive licence of men.” Those Statutes applied to Cam- 
bridge alone. But the same tendency was visible at Oxford, to 
vest authority more and more in the seniors and the Heads of 
113 Eliz. cap. xxix. 
2 13 Eliz. cap. x, and 18 Eliz. cap. xi. The second of these Acts was 
intended to prevent evasions of the first. 
3 18 Eliz. cap. vi. The payment was to be in good wheat after 6s. 8d. 
the quarter or under, and good malt after 5s. the quarter or under. The 
wheat, though worth far more in open market, would never be credited to 
the tenant at more. The Act has been attributed to Sir T. Smith, and 
the suggestion may well have come from Cambridge, as Mr. Mullinger 
(II, 377) says. See also Reeves (Hist. of Eng. Law, ed. Finlason, III, 621), 
Burrows (Register of Visitors, xiii), and Wood (Amn. II, 178).

Houses. At both Universities the independent spirit, the ‘“ un- 
tamed affections,” of the younger Regents made democracy 
alarming to the older generation. At Oxford the Puritans never 
obtained quite the position which they won at Cambridge. They 
had no such conspicuous leader as Cartwright, though there were 
some who sympathised with Cartwright’s views.1 No such 
“contention and disquietude ’—no such vainglory, arrogancy, 
popularity, anabaptistry, to use the stinging words of Whitgift— 
gave Conservative thinkers cause for complaint. But with a 
Chancellor like Leicester, a recognised patron of the advanced 
Reformers, and with Heads of Houses like Humfrey and Rainolds, 
Protestant feeling fully held its own. As the reign proceeded, 
the danger from the Romanists increased. The Ridolfi Plot 
revealed the peril threatening England. The ‘ barbarous 
treacherie ’’ of St. Bartholomew roused a passion of anger and 
dismay. The activities of English Catholics deepened the dis- 
trust of Rome. Nicholas Sanders, so lately a Fellow of New 
College, ? did not scruple to declare that the safety of Christendom 
depended on “ the stout assailing of England.” Roman Catho- 
lics gathered at Louvain and at Douai, as Protestants in the 
days of Mary had taken refuge at Zurich and Strasburg, at 
Frankfort and Basle. A new University, with Richard Smith 
as its Chancellor, had been founded at Douai, to fight the Reforma- 
tion, and in 1568 William Allen of Oriel opened a College for 
English Catholics there. Morgan Phillips gave his powerful 
assistance. Old Oxford students were among its earliest mem- 
bers, with New College men conspicuous among them.? Cam- 
pion and others followed soon after. St. John’s, Exeter, Trinity 
contributed recruits. The Pope was prevailed on to endow the 
College. Its numbers rapidly increased. But it was alleged 
2 Wood mentions Edward Gellibrand of Magdalen as the chief of a 
party in Oxford “‘ encouraged to go forward in their Presbytery’ by 
certain Scotch Ministers who visited Oxford in 1584 (Amn. II, 224-5). 
2 He is not in Wood’s list of New College men deprived in 1560 
(Ann. II, 144-5), perhaps because he had already gone abroad. His 
great work, De Visibili Monarchia Ecclesie, appeared in 1571. (See 
Wood’s Athene, I, 469 sq.).

Owen Lewis, who became a Professor of Law, and Thomas Dorman, a 
great friend of Thomas Harding, and under Mary a Fellow of All Souls.

B.N.C. and Oriel, became an active plotter in the Jesuit camp. 
5’ The numbers of the English College seem to have reached 120 and 
the number of students in the University of Douai some 200 in 1576. 
In the vicissitudes of the history of the Netherlands the students of 
Douai were driven to Rheims (1578). For these and other details see 
Dr. Knox’s Introduction to The First and Second Diaries of the English 
College, Douay, in his }Records of the English Catholics; also his volume 
of memorials of Cardinal Allen.

    136 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
that the Seminary priests of Douai brought their Papistry from 
Oxford ready-made.1_ The venerable English College at Rome 
entered at the same time on a new lease of life.2 The Jesuits, 
with their great gift of organisation, their genius for training and 
manipulating the minds of men, were tireless in founding Colleges 
and in attempts to conquer the Universities abroad. Robert 
Parsons brought to the Society of Jesus his courage, his energy, 
his unscrupulous devotion, his eloquent and formidable pen. And 
the new Catholic Colleges, centres of zeal, of learning and of 
propaganda, became also dangerous centres of the conspiracy 
directed against English freedom. 
Robert Parsons, the faithful friend of Cardinal Allen, and for 
many years a formidable organiser of the Jesuit forces, entered 
Balliol from St. Mary Hall in the year when Elizabeth first 
visited Oxford. He became Fellow and Dean and Bursar of his 
College. He twice took the Oath of Supremacy. But he made 
enemies as well as friends, and in 1574 from one cause or another 
he gave up his Fellowship and went abroad. At that time he 
‘could still protest that he was not and never meant to be a Papist. 
A year later he had changed his opinions, and his dramatic career 
as a Jesuit had begun. In 1580 he was back in England, at the 
head of the Jesuit Mission, travelling with Campion in disguise 
from house to house, printing and distributing Romanist litera- 
ture, rousing the alarm of Parliament and the admiration of his 
friends. Parsons won a great reputation as an organiser, as 
the untiring agent of a failing cause. But his colleague, Edmund 
Campion, was probably more widely loved. From early boyhood 
every one seems to have acknowledged Campion’s charm. He 
“pore away the game,” we are told, “in all contentions of learn- 
ing.” His wit, his grace, his eloquence were universally admitted. 
The Founder of St. John’s—he was one of the earliest scholars of 
the College—treated him with marked affection. Leicester and 
Cecil showed themselves his friends. He was chosen to speak the 
funeral oration over “‘ Amy Robsart.”” His powers in disputation 
won the approval of the Queen. He took his Master’s degree at 
Oxford and accepted the Queen’s supremacy. He acted as 
Proctor in 1568-9. But after that he left the University and 
yielded to the opinions which were driving him to Rome. Con- 
vert or pervert, he still kept his charm. When he returned with 
the Jesuit Mission to England, his preaching at the secret gather- 
ings of Catholics had a profound effect. When Parsons escaped,

Campion was captured, not far from his old haunts at Oxford, 
imprisoned, racked and cruelly treated. But his fine bearing 
confounded his opponents. A conscience pure, a courage in- 
vincible, a work so worthy—in these things he found “‘ infinite 
sweetness,’’ a recompense for all earthly pain.1 He suffered in 
December 158r with two other Oxford men at Tyburn—Ralph 
Sherwin, once a graduate of Exeter, and Alexander Briant, a 
young priest of singular beauty, who had passed on to Douai 
from Hart Hall. They dignified the cause for which they suffered. 
Campion prayed for Elizabeth even at the end. But his contem- 
poraries can hardly be blamed for fearing that his triumph would 
have meant the ruin of all for which Elizabethan England stood. 
It was long before Campion was forgotten at Oxford. But 
Protestant opinions steadily made way. Romanist prints 
denouncing the Queen roused deep indignation, and in 1584 
Convocation intervened to prevent their circulation. The “ Cal- 
vinistical Party ” had a fair opportunity of capturing the younger 
men. Tutors suspected of Popery were required to give up their 
pupils or to purge themselves. Humfrey, says Wood, not only 
stocked his College “‘ with such a generation of Nonconformists 
as could not be rooted out in many years after his decease,” but 
sowed the seeds of Calvinism in the Divinity School. Hatton, on 
succeeding to the Chancellorship, emphasised the need of con- 
formity in religion. Buckhurst, who took Hatton’s place in 
1591,* called on the University again to suppress “ all Jesuits, 
Seminaries and Recusants.” Sir Francis Walsingham founded 
a new Divinity Lecture, and secured John Rainolds’ appoint- 
ment to the post. Wood indeed suggests that the advanced 
Reformers so used their opportunity to rule the University that 
in Leicester’s day there was “ little to be seen in it of the Church 
of England.” But Wood and Leicester, no doubt, differed 
widely in their conception of what the Church of England meant. 
Nor on the other side were the stricter churchmen silent. 
Dean James of Christ Church, who was Vice-Chancellor in 1591, 
1 See Campion’s letter quoted by Froude (History, Ch. 63). Richard 
Simpson’s biography is the chief authority for Campion’s life. 
? Another priest from Douai, whom Wood claims as an Oxford man, 
John Hart, was condemned with Campion, but saved his life by a promise 
to recant. He faced a long conference with John Rainolds at Oxford, 
recovered his courage, and was ultimately banished. Allen claimed in 
1583 that English students from the Universities were still flocking to 
Rheims. (Douay Diaries, \xxi). 
8 Apparently on instructions from the Crown, though Essex was the 
popular favourite. (See Murdin, Burghley State Papers, 649). 
« Wood probably overstates the case. Under the year 1573 he accuses 
the authorities of leaning heavily on “ such that had the least glimpse 
towards Rome’’ (Ann. II, 174). But the political danger from the 
Romanists was then very real,
-P-A-G-E-172
  138 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
took action to regulate University preaching. He was “a bitter 
enemy to those called Calvinists,” and a high-handed ruler in 
more waysthanone. As the peril from the Romanists diminished, 
the two-edged weapon of conformity came into play against the 
extreme men on the other side. Tests and subscriptions were 
becoming ominously popular. Schismatics were as bad as 
Jesuits in their disregard of law. The Protestant preachers had 
an uncomfortable habit of using the University sermons as a 
vehicle for attacking anything which they thought an abuse. 
They had no mercy, for instance, for non-residents. They 
were said to be determined “‘ to preach non-residents out of their 
Benefices or Headships.” They were no respecters of persons. 
Their invective—‘‘ Shameless Faces, Adders Ears, seared con- 
sciences ’’—lacked nothing in virility, and gained interest from 
the fact that their congregations knew exactly whom they meant. 
“ Every youth can say, after the Sermon, here such a Governor 
was touched, here such a Doctor was disgraced.” 1 In 1602 
Vice-Chancellor Howson determined to reform these “ grand 
enormities in preaching.” John Sprint of Christ Church, who 
had attacked the regulations of the Church and criticised the 
rulers of the University, was sent to prison.. Robert Troutbeck 
of Queen’s, and even the Provost, Dr. Airay, came to the sup- 
port of Sprint, and defended his attacks on the Vice-Chancellor 
at least as vigorously as his doctrinal views. The Vice-Chancellor 
complained to the Chancellor and Council. Royal Commission- 
ers insisted on the submission of the offenders. Sprint and 
Troutbeck had to apologise in full Convocation, though Dr. 
Airay escaped the humiliation inflicted on his friends. The 
authorities triumphed. They even planned a Commission to 
put further irregularities down. They were resolved to quell 
insubordination, whether directed against the Establishment 
or against themselves. The conscientious Puritan found him- 
self more and more in danger of exclusion from the Church which 
he had hoped to dominate and laboured to reform. 
Yet even among Elizabethan churchmen Calvinistic influences 
were strong. The greatest of the Reformers, the men who had 
stirred the hearts of Europe, were above all else evangelists. 
Their aim was spiritual salvation. They cared for knowledge. 
They hated superstition. But they cared most to be delivered 
from sin. The Reformation broke down the old limits of author- 
ity. But some new authority was needed to give the new opinions 
consistency and shape. The fervour of the Protestants was thus 
diverted into dogma, and the demand for free inquiry yielded 
to the demand for rules of faith. Rome, it was felt, with her 
formidable influence and traditions could only be fought by 
1 Ib, (II, 276).
-P-A-G-E-173
  ELIZABETHAN OXFORD 139 
strongly organised Churches, built on definite principles, with a 
discipline which had to be obeyed. Luther’s theology stiffened 
into dogmatism. Calvin’s had always been intensely dogmatic. 
But churchmen in England turned aside from the harsher aspects 
of Calvin’s and Augustine’s doctrine,1 to concentrate upon more 
practical questions, the Sacraments, the validity of Orders, above 
all the right system of governing the Church. And here, while the 
Presbyterians. maintained that the pattern of Church govern- 
ment could be found in Holy Writ alone, the supporters of the 
Elizabethan settlement took a wider view. To Cartwright 
Bishops and Archbishops were unscriptural. The Anglican hier- 
archy could not be reconciled with the spirit of the primitive 
Church. To Whitgift, on the other hand, though bred in Calvin’s 
teaching, Episcopacy was the most reasonable and convenient 
system. Scripture prescribed no one and perfect plan. The 
only essentials were the right administration of the Sacraments 
and the preaching of God’s Word.? 
The distinction between the two great Schools was sharp. 
Neither Cartwright nor Whitgift were men to conciliate oppon- 
ents. But a humbler and a more persuasive pleader was at 
hand, to lift the controversy into a larger air. Hooker, trained 
at Corpus in the friendship of Jewel and Rainolds, recognised 
to the last the influence of Calvin. But he became the most 
eloquent and logical defender of the position taken by the Estab- 
lished Church. He gave it a philosophy on which it could repose. 
Hooker’s unconquerable shyness, which made him happy in a 
country parsonage and happier still perhaps as a bachelor in 
College rooms, could not impair his intellectual courage. The 
low voice and little stature which rendered him unimpressive 
in the pulpit, the ‘‘ blessed bashfulness ’’ which made him unable 
to look his pupils in the face, did not prevent him from appealing 
boldly to the first principles of government, to find a rational 
basis for the settlement which he preferred. The divine laws 
whose guidance both Churchman and Puritan acknowledged, 
were to be sought for not in Scripture only but in “ all the sources 
of light and truth with which man finds himself encompassed,” 
in the order of the universe, in nature and in life. God’s reason 
1 The harsher aspects of the great doctrine of Predestination, which in 
the 39 Articles are to some extent avoided or disguised, appear only in 
the Lambeth Articles of 1595, where the Bishops seem to have been driven 
into an extreme position by attacks made on the doctrine at Oxford and 
Cambridge. (See Dr. Tulloch’s Rational Theology in England in the 17th 
Century, to which I am obviously indebted here.) 
2 The two views are perhaps best illustrated by Cartwright’s Replye to 
an answere made of M. Doctor Whitegifte againste the Admonition to the 
Parliament and Whitgift’s Defense of the Aunswere to the Admonition 
in replying to Cartwright in 1574.
-P-A-G-E-174
140 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
was embodied in Natural Law. Men recognised that law as 
binding, and to it all human institutions must conform. The 
Scriptures supplemented this Natural Law. The Church was 
built not on exclusive dogma but on catholicity of spirit: it 
might take many shapes. Its system was a rational and seemly 
form of government, which fulfilled the requirements of Scripture 
and fitted the temper and history of the nation. The Lawes of 
Ecclesiastical Politie depended on the growth of Christian reason, 
and in Hooker’s calm and luminous argument, sustained with rare 
beauty and stateliness of style, the spirit of Christian rationalism 
took its loftiest flight. The Anglo-Catholic theologians who 
followed claimed Hooker as their standard-bearer. But they 
allowed some of the wider aspects of his philosophy to disappear. 
The appeal to the authority of the early Fathers was nothing 
new in English theology,1 but among the opponents of the Puri- 
tans it acquired a special force. Tradition and sacerdotalism 
grew stronger. The divine right of Holy Writ to settle every 
controversy was met by a new theory, the divine right of Bishops, 
successors of the Apostles, to interpret the teaching of the Church. 
To the golden age of pure Catholic theology all doctrines and 
usages must be referred. And if the Puritan school grew narrow 
and aggressive in its dogma, forgot its early love of liberty and 
refused to tolerate independent thought, it must be confessed that 
the Anglo-Catholic school proved in its day of power as dangerous 
to freedom, as slow to seek the paths of conciliation and of peace. 
In spite of religious divisions, however, the University pros- 
pered and grew. It is true that even in the latter years of the 
century we find dispensations granted because the number of 
Inceptors was so small. This was felt to be discreditable, 
especially if Cambridge men were present at the Comitia, and 
besides that a small number of Inceptors provided only a small 
crop of fees. In law, divinity and medicine few of the higher 
degrees were taken, and there was generally an insufficient 
number of Doctors to depone.* But on the other hand Wood 
1 Cranmer and Jewel resorted to it freely. See also what Strype says 
in his Life of Parker (1821, II, 54) in regard to the Articles and the authority 
of the Church, 
2 Bancroft went far to make this claim. (See, inter alia, Hunt's 
Religious Thought in England, I, 86, and Mr. Mullinger’s article in D.N.B.) 
8 E.g. in 1583, 1585, 1586, 1588 and 1602 (Clark, Register, II, i, 70). 
In 1585 the number of Inceptors in Arts is vaguely said to be barely half 
that of former years. But Clark’s Tables (Jb. II, ii, 410) show that 67 
M.As. incepted in that year, and these lists may not always be complete. 
« The largest number of D.Ds. recorded in any one year under Eliza- 
beth was 15 in 1596. But that number was exceptional: the average was 
barely 4. D.C.Ls. and M.Ds. were still fewer. But the B.Ds. were more 
numerous and rose in one exceptional year—160o—to 44. (Ib. II, ii, 
411).
-P-A-G-E-175
ELIZABETHAN OXFORD 141 
tells us that the number of Determining Bachelors was “ in those 
times very great,’’ and the tables compiled from the Registers 
on the whole bear out the statement.1_ If we may rely on the 
figures there collected, the number of Masters of Arts incepting 
in the last thirty years of Elizabeth’s reign was rarely below 
sixty and was sometimes over eighty, though it fluctuated in a 
manner rather difficult to understand. It rose to a hundred and 
four in 1577. It dropped to forty-nine in 1597. The Determin- 
ing Bachelors varied as widely. They numbered a hundred and 
fifty-six in 1574. They fell to sixty in 1581. They reached a 
hundred and fifty in 1587, and a hundred and seventy-seven in 
1595. In most years they exceeded a hundred, and they num- 
bered two hundred before the seventeenth century was far 
advanced. 
The ages of the boys who went to Oxford were still often lower 
than they are to-day. We have cases of little fellows coming up, 
probably under the charge of tutors, at ten or twelve, and even 
at seven or eight—taken from school, suggests one sympathetic 
critic, “as birds out of the nest ere they be flidge.’’ Matricula- 
tions at fourteen were not uncommon. But sixteen, seventeen 
or eighteen was a more usual age. A fair proportion of men 
matriculated at nineteen or twenty: entrances after that age 
were comparatively rare.2 From time to time in the sixteenth 
century we have complaints that the character of the Universities 
is changing, that gay young men, who enjoy life more than study, 
are replacing the poor and serious students of an earlier day, 
that rich men’s sons, who love dress and taverns and disorder, are 
ruffling and roystering where humble clerks and scholars dwelt of 
yore. ‘‘And for excuse, when they are charged with breach of all 
good order, thinke it sufficient to saie, that they be gentlemen, 
which grieueth manie not a little.’’ Harrison even says that in his 
day it was hard for a poor man’s child to come by a Fellowship. 
But the matriculation entries show that the description “‘ Pleb. 
fil.,”” sometimes, no doubt, a little misleading, still overshadowed 
every other. Young men of famous names there were, but the 
1 Wood refers to 1582 (Ann. II, 210). Dr. Clark gives 121 Determining 
Bachelors for that year. (See his Tables, Reg. II, ii, 410-11). 
* The figures given for 1581 in Dr. Clark’s Table (Reg. II, ii, 421) are 
fairly typical, though the entries are unusually numerous that year :— 
one boy of 9, five of 10, eighteen of 11, forty-seven of 14, seventy-four of 
15, ninety-five of 16, one hundred and eleven of 17, one hundred and 
twenty-nine of 18, one hundred and five of 19, eighty-five of 20, thirty- 
two of 21, etc. The total is exceptionally high: but the proportions 
were more or less normal.

the middle of the century.

142 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
sons of noblemen were comparatively few, and even in the palmy 
days of Queen Elizabeth the sons of knights and esquires were 
only a small proportion of the whole. The sons of gentlemen and 
lads indifferent to description ruled in the undergraduate world, 
and were quite content to rank as humble persons provided that 
they paid a corresponding fee.t 
At Oxford, as all over the country, the comfort of life was 
increasing. The Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge had no 
rivals in Europe. One of them, cried a foreign observer, was 
worth ten Colleges abroad.* Their way of life was “ most pleas- 
ant and liberal.” They were fitter for lords and lawyers than for 
ragged clerks and butchers’ sons. Ralph Agas, bringing out his 
map of Oxford about 1578, sang of 
“A city seated rich in everything.” 
Panelled rooms had come into fashion. Fires and fireplaces were 
no longer rare. Good living was commoner: it had probably 
never been unknown. Men after forty, Harrison lamented, could 
“live like drone bees on the fat of colleges.”” Bachelors of Arts 
had flock beds and bolsters and down pillows.’ Pictures and 
hangings and books were found. The older, stricter generation 
mourned over the increase of luxury. But the Colleges generally 
were crowded and the luxury of space at any rate was rare. 
Wood suggests that Leicester may have been to blame if the 
University in his day ‘‘ became debauched and very loose.” # 
But Leicester does not seem to have been backward in efforts at 
reform. A more secular atmosphere may have been replacing 
the old ecclesiastical traditions of the past. 
Still many traditions of the medizval clerks remained. In 
1586 certain scholars of Magdalen went stealing deer in Shotover 
Forest, and one of them was imprisoned by the orders of Lord 
Norris. In return, when Lord Norris visited the city for Quarter 
Sessions, he was mobbed at the Bear Inn near All Saints’ : and, 
as he left Oxford, the Magdalen men fell upon his retinue and 
1 The “ Pleb. fil.” paid only 4d. on matriculation ; no other rank paid 
less than 1s, But entries in the Matriculation Register were often inexact. 
The proportions of each rank as given vary a good deal, but the proportion 
of Knights’ and Squires’ sons tends to rise. In 1571 ‘‘ Fil. Plebei ’”’ num-

In 1581 the corresponding numbers are 507, 173 and 92. In 1591 they are 
99, 72 and 46. In 1601 they are 152, 111 and 75 (Clark, II, ii, 414). Con- 
spicuous young men of fashion, a Howard, Herbert, Sidney, Stafford, 
Vere, were sometimes made M.As. by special decree of Convocation,

between North and South revived, and ‘‘ were not pacified with- 
out blood and wounds.”’ The Welsh were accused of fomenting 
the disorder and of giving special trouble at Oriel and All Souls. 
The roughness of life was by no means over. Freshmen at 
Colleges still had to face ordeals. The “salting” of Francis 
Bacon at Trinity, Cambridge, had its counterpart in the ‘‘ tuck- 
ing”’ of Ashley Cooper at Exeter later on. A traveller like 
Giordano Bruno, who visited in turn the chief Universities of 
Europe, found the graduates of Oxford ignorant and pedantic, 
the undergraduates too fond of beer, and Oxford men generally 
so arrogant in their demeanour that they would have tried the 
patience of a Job.+ 
One foible, vanity in dress, seems to have been characteristic 
of students all over Europe. It played a disproportionate part 
in the Statutes. The authorities protested against it again and 
again. Taverning and brawling, bull-baiting and cock-fighting 
were temptations not always resisted. Elaborate mummeries, 
licensed by old custom, still marked the Christmas season.? A 
fragment of a Proctor’s diary in 1582 speaks of torch-light pro- 
cessions, starting with ‘“‘ a clubbying out of al housis,” in which 
drums and bagpipes, poets crowned with garlands, and orations 
at College gates from Sir Parson and Sir Poticary are curiously 
mingled.? Stage plays and players fascinated boys at least as 
readily in those days asin ours. But it was one thing to approve 
of the University stage with its Latin dramas, written by scholars 
and acted by students. It was quite another thing to support 
the “light and decayed persons,” who for filthy lucre set up in 
open places unlawful, hurtful and pernicious shows. Professional 
players, it was thought, distracted scholars from their studies, 
encouraged lewdness, even helped to spread the plague. Con- 
vocation, pressed by the Council and the Chancellor, passed 
decrees to put them down. Puritan feeling reinforced the efforts 
1 But even Oxford was better than Wittenberg, ‘‘ the foul sewer of 
the Devil” in the view of a Jena Professor, or Marburg, where the morals 
were such ‘‘as Bacchus would prescribe to his Mznads and Venus to her 
Cupids.”’ See the quotations given by Mr. Mullinger (II, 100, 284 and 
422). But I do not agree with Mr. Mullinger that Oxford between 1582 
and 1584 was “‘ at its lowest ebb.”

he was the patron saint of children—and ending on Dec. 28, the festival 
of the Holy Innocent, see two interesting articles on the Boy Bishop by 
C. H. Evelyn White in the Journal of the British Archeological Associa- 
tion for 1905. If old customs altered, the old traditions of festivity 
remained.

of the authorities. If Hamlet was acted in Elizabethan Oxford, 
it was not with the University’s assent. But Shakespeare’s 
colleagues were not easily suppressed. The Queen’s players, 
the Lord Admiral’s, even Lord Leicester’s the Chancellor’s own, 
continued in spite of Statutes to pay visits to the town.1' The 
University often with doubtful diplomacy paid them small sums 
to go away.? Finally, in 1593, encouraged by the Privy Council, 
Town and Gown combined to prohibit ‘‘common Players” 
altogether ‘‘ within the compasse of fyve myles.” 
Puritan critics of the stage were less successful in their efforts 
to stop acting within College walls. University drama, encour- 
aged by authority, developed vigorously in Elizabethan days. 
Edwardes and Calfhill had their successors at Oxford.? It was 
part of the duty of the Christ Church Censors to superintend 
arrangements for the College plays. William Gager, who went 
up to Christ Church as a Westminster scholar in 1574, was an 
admirable writer both in English and in Latin. He stepped into 
the front rank of University playwrights when he produced 
Meleager in 1582. And his remarkable tragedy Ulysses Redux 
gave rise to one of the most interesting controversies of the day. 
John Rainolds, who had acted as a boy before the Queen but 
had grown graver with advancing years, was invited to see 
Gager’s play on a Sunday at Shrovetide,* and wrote explaining 
why he would not come. He objected now to men in ‘‘ wemens 
raiment,” a thing which Scripture and Calvin alike disapproved. 
He objected to Sunday performances. He objected to many 
points which “ godlie fathers ” and even heathen commonwealths 
condemned. And when Gager published his play and rashly 
sent him a copy, with an Epilogue intended to answer arguments 
of this kind, Rainolds returned to the attack with stronger lan- 
guage, and denounced acting as no better than dancing round the 
Maypole, drinking in taverns, robbing orchards or stealing deer. 
1 See Boas (Shakespeare and the Universities, Ch. II), on the question 
of the acting of Hamlet and on the whole subject: also Madan (Oxford 
Books, II, 49.) 
2 For these payments and for some of the Privy Council Orders see 
Boas (as above and Univ. Dvama, Ch. X). The sweeping order of 1593 
is given by Wood (Ann. II, 254-6). It is signed by Burghley, Essex and 
Buckhurst, among others. But we hear of interludes being acted and 
causing trouble in 1598 (Jb. II, 268), and the Queen’s players and others 
were in Oxford, and were bribed to leave by the University, several times 
between 1584 and 1604. 
8 E.g. “Dr. Edes of Oxford”? among “‘ our best for Tragedie,” a 
Christ Church man, Proctor in 1583 and Prebendary in 1586. Dr. John 
Case also in his book on Ethics in 1585 defended academic plays. (Boas, 
Univ. Drama, 163-4 and 228). 
¢ The invitation was sent in Feb. 1592, by Thomas Thornton of Christ 
Church, to whom Rainolds’ first letter of criticism was addressed.
-P-A-G-E-179
  
ELIZABETHAN OXFORD 145 
Gager replied with a temperate plea for the academic drama. 
Scholars who joined in this were no infamous professionals. 
They brought no “lewd, vast, dissolute, wicked, impudent, 
prodigall, monstrous humor ”’ on to the stage. They produced 
“some learned Poéme or other,” to recreate themselves, to train 
their style and memories and diction, ‘‘to trye what mettell is 
in evrye one.” Their Choir Masters were no fiddling Neros. 
Their dancing was comely and honest: he saw no cause “in 
reason, charytye or christian libertye’”’ to condemn it. Their 
manners were seemly and decent. There was no “ kissinge of 
bewtifull boyes.’’ As for dressing men in women’s garments, 
that charge should not be pressed too far. Clothes could not 
defile the body, though the manner of wearing them might. 
He had known an actor forget his dress altogether, and instead 
of making “a conge like a woman,” make “a legg like a man.” 
But Rainolds was not to be appeased. He swept aside angrily 
the plea of moral benefit. He pointed, with too much violence 
but effectively enough, to the possibilities of mischief. What 
good purpose could it serve to inflame tender youths with love, 
to entice them to dalliance, to inure them to dissolute railings 
and brain-sick conceits ? In vain the Professor of Civil Law, no 
less a person than Gentilis, came forward to defend College plays. 
Rainolds replied to him with needless truculence. Even a 
quotation from Augustine, which Rainolds found it difficult to 
verify, failed to assuage the storm. And when his indictment 
was published some years later, in a book entitled Th’ overthrow 
of Stage-Playes, the Puritans found in it unanswerable evidence 
of the theatrical evils they deplored.t 
The year 1584, which saw a decree directed against professional 
players in University precincts, was marked by a series of fresh 
complaints from the Chancellor against University disorders. 
We hear again of looseness in Apparel, of incivilities at meetings 
of the Masters, of the abuse of dispensations and the neglect of 
lecturers. We are “‘crediblie informed” that Ministers and 
Deacons went into the field to play at football, which was closely 
connected with disorder in the Chancellor’s mind.2?- The worst 
offenders, it seems, were beneficed clergy, who preferred games 
and quarrels at Oxford to parish work at home. Masters of Art 
in Convocations and Congregations were reminded that they ought 
to speak in Latin, and, what was more difficult, to listen with 
patience to what was said by others of themselves. Scholars 
1 Gager’s protest was written in July 1592. MRainolds retorted in 
May 1593. The controversy between Rainolds and Gentilis continued 
till March 1594. Th’ overthrow of Stage-Playes was published in 1599.

were not to sit on Penniless Bench at Carfax or to ‘‘ gadd vpp and 
downe the streates.” The old rules were to be remembered and 
the Statutes more carefully observed. But if Chancellors were 
stern in reproving excesses, if an Archbishop like Whitgift, who 
had proved himself at Cambridge a high-minded and high-handed 
reformer, dwelt forcibly on the unsatisfactory features of Oxford 
life) there were not wanting voices on the other side. To 
Nicholas Fitzherbert, an Exeter man strongly attached to the 
old religion, who became a student at Douai and a member of 
Cardinal Allen’s household, there was little wrong with Eliza- 
bethan Oxford except its abandonment of the faith he loved. 
He dwells on its fine air, its fertile soil, its Colleges magnificent 
in form and “eternal in solidity,” its admirable exercises, its 
large output of degrees. He has nothing but praise for its dis- 
cipline and order—a little freer perhaps in the Halls than in the 
Colleges—for the “‘ modesty, taciturnity, obedience’’ of the 
younger men.? And Nicholas Bond, the President of Magdalen, 
who as Vice-Chancellor had the best right to an opinion, found 
a good deal to be said in answer to the strictures which Hatton, 
soon after his election to the Chancellorship, expressed. Bond 
refused to allow the Chancellor’s complaints to be read in Con- 
vocation. He denied that disorders continued. The suggestion 
that the Professors neglected their lectures was “‘ utterlie untrue.” 
Some disputations might have been omitted: Congregation 
had been too ready to grant dispensations on that point. But 
subscription to the Articles was regularly insisted on. Latin 
talk was duly kept up: Magdalen scholars at any rate “ dare not 
presume ”’ to speak anything else. If in certain Houses they 
were less particular, it must be remembered that the Vice-Chan- 
cellor’s authority did not extend to all the Colleges’ private con- 
cerns. As regarded dress, ‘the reformation of Apparell’’ was 
not perhaps as perfect as it might be: but the irregularities 
complained of neither increased nor continued, as alleged.® 
We do not know how Hatton took the rebuke. But it seems that 
Bond’s successor induced Convocation to make some fresh regula- 
tions in answer to the Chancellor’s appeal. 
The world was changing rapidly. The empire of the School- 
men had departed. Science was awaking. Mathematics were 
1 Most of the “ proceeders in arts,’”’ said Whitgift, among other stric- 
tures, spent only a third of the time required in lectures and in duties 
at Oxford, ‘‘ but rather in some gentleman’s house or curate’s place.” 
(See Strype’s Life of Whitgift, I, 610, and Mullinger, II, 283-4). 
% See Nicolai Fierberti Oxoniensis Academie Descriptio, reprinted in 
Plummer’s Elizabethan Oxford. It is to be feared that Fitzherbert’s 
praises are less exact than Whitgift’s complaints.

making way. The old terminology was beginning to contain 
new meanings. The Natural Philosophy of the seventeenth 
century was to be a very different thing from the Natural 
Philosophy of earlier days. But educational traditions are slow 
to alter, and in spite of new ideas and information the ancient 
rules and manuals survived. The Arts course probably suffered 
as dispensations increased. Greek and Hebrew Professors were 
appointed, but those languages made less way than scholars 
might have hoped. We hear little of the passionate interest in 
Greek which had inspired the age of Erasmus. Hebrew was 
valued chiefly for theology, but polemics were dearer than 
theology to most divines. Moreover, even Professors could not 
always count on a sufficient audience in days when College 
teaching was encroaching more and more upon the Schools. 
History was still largely based upon credulity. We find Polydore 
Vergil held up to censure for rejecting the story of ‘‘ Brute and 
his successors.” The study of Civil Law was unpopular with 
the clergy on one side and with the Common lawyers on the 
other, though it received fresh life from the appointment of 
Gentilis as Professor in 1587.2. Mathematics were more studied 
in London than at either University.2 ‘‘ Matters mechanical ”’ 
were regarded as the business of merchants, seamen and almanac- 
makers, into which academical people thought it “a kind of 
dishonour unto learning to descend ’’ *: and an opinion so vener- 
able has its exponents still. In astronomy Ptolemy still filled 
a larger place than Copernicus. Strabo and Pliny were still 
authorities on geography, though Columbus and Vasco da Gama 
had re-drawn the world. Text-books on rhetoric still dated from 
the orators of Rome. Logic and rhetoric, “‘ the arts of arts, the 
one for judgement, the other for ornament,” were taught, as one 
of the greatest of Elizabethans pleaded, too superficially and 
too early. Aristotle still claimed his old supremacy. At Paris 
indeed an audacious reformer, Peter Ramus, had arisen, who was 
destined to perish with other dangerous Reformers on St. Barthol- 
omew’s eve, but who had challenged the authority of Aristotle 
and startled the logicians of Europe first. Ramus produced a 
new and brilliant text-book upon logic, which many great 
authorities condemned. But it won wide popularity in the 
Protestant Universities of the Continent. The younger genera- 
tion welcomed it at Cambridge. Milton re-edited it a hundred 
years after its author’s death. Even at Oxford there were 
1 In the Continuation of Stowe’s Annals (Mullinger, II, 421). 
4 But after some three years he left Oxford to practise in London.

scholars ready to give it a hearing, for Ramus, though im- 
patient of the Schoolmen’s processes, still believed in disputa- 
tion as the best method of developing the reasoning powers of 
men.+ 
But at Oxford the hold of Aristotle proved in the end too 
strong to resist. Bachelors and undergraduates were ordered 
to lay aside contentious authors and to follow only Aristotle and 
those that defended him. Questions, “ disagreeing from the 
antient and true Philosophy,” were to be excluded in future 
from the Schools.? Authority was still on the watch to dis- 
courage revolutionary forms of knowledge. Theology was still 
in leading-strings, though it occupied some of the best brains 
ofthe age. Protestants might struggle to put Calvin in the place 
of Aquinas, but even Calvinistic philosophers could not shake off 
the influence of the Schoolmen of the past. A playwright who 
knew both Universities suggested 3: 
“That lordly are the buildings of the town, 
Spacious the rooms, and full of pleasant walks ; 
But for the doctors, how that they be learned, 
It may be meanly.” 
Francis Bacon, surveying his own generation, traced to the 
Universities the theological contentions which violated “ truth, 
sobriety, or peace.” 4 His luminous observation marked the 
weak spots in the University system, the want of the right sort 
of early preparation in the students, the failure of the accustomed 
exercises to stimulate originality or experiment, the insufficient 
pay assigned to teachers, the professional character of an educa- 
tion which made its chief appeal to young men bent upon success 
in their careers.5 
Yet in spite of dead formulas and lively contentions the cause 
of learning made way. Leicester’s Press began to produce books 
which roused the envy of London printers, and brought Oxford 
and Cambridge together in an effort to put down piratical publi- 
cations. Booksellers licensed to sell wine and ale, to eke out their

  literary ventures,! gave way to better things. Joseph Barnes, 
admitted as bookseller in 1573, secured in 1585 a loan of a hundred 
pounds from the University to set up a Press, and a Star Chamber 
ordinance sanctioned one Press and one apprentice besides a 
chief printer at Oxford. Barnes’ first publication was a broad- 
side welcoming the Chancellor under whose auspices this revival 
had begun. In the same period a great merchant like Gresham 
founded a College in London, which some feared as a rival to the 
Universities, but which drew for its teachers on Oxford and 
Cambridge men. A great public servant like Bodley won wider 
immortality by restoring the Library which Duke Humphrey 
had endowed.? Visitors of distinction made their pilgrimage 
to Oxford, some like Giordano Bruno little noticed, others with 
all the apparatus of a Court. In 1579 Leicester accompanied 
thither John Casimir, a son of the Elector Palatine, and “ both 
were entertained with all the varieties that the Muses could 
afford.” In 1583 he brought over in state from Rycote a Polish 
potentate, variously described, who had come to England “to 
see the Fashions and admire the wisdom of the Queen.’”’ Alasco 
had a great reception. The Vice-Chancellor and Doctors saluted 
him in scarlet. The students were marshalled “in their form- 
alities ”’ in the streets. Sermons, disputations, plays were given. 
William Gager was ready with two new Latin pieces—Riuales, 
a rather boisterous comedy,* and Dido, a statelier drama, which 
included more elaborate scenes. In January 1585 Leicester 
came again to Oxford, and saw two more plays, Meleager among 
them, into which a reference to Philip Sidney, who was present, 
had been introduced. ‘“‘ Mr. Lilie ’’ lent clothes for the occasion, 
thus linking the performance with another well-known Eliza- 
bethan name.’ Before the Chancellor left that time, he heard 
1 See Madan’s Early Oxford Press (274-5) and the same author’s Brief 
Account of the University Press (Ch. II). 1585 seems to be the right date 
for the loan to Barnes, whose shop was first in High Street opposite St. 
Mary’s and afterwards round the corner at the West end of the church. 
® Bodley’s first offer to the Vice-Chancellor arrived in Feb. 1598 
(Wood, Ann, II, 265-8). But the story of the Bodleian belongs to the 
17th century. 
3 Wood (Amn. II, 215) calls him Albertus Alaskie or Laskie or de 
Alasco. Nichols calls him (Progresses, 1823, II, 405 sq.) the Baron Alaskie. 
Leicester called him ‘‘ Ye Palatin Lasky’ and “‘ Ye Prince Laskey.” Dr. 
Boas styles him more decorously Albertus Alasco, Prince Palatine of 
Siradia in Poland, and supplements other accounts of the visit with 
valuable details (Univ. Drama, 179 sq.). 
« Rainolds protested against the drunken scenes in Riuales. This 
play was never printed, but Dido is preserved in MS. at Christ Church, 
and parts of it have been printed. (Jb. 183, n.). 
5 Dr. Boas (Univ. Drama, 193-5) gives details of expenses from the 
Christ Church accounts, and makes the interesting suggestion that the

a disputation at St. Mary’s between the two distinguished brothers 
John and Edward Rainolds, John, already famous as a zealous 
Protestant, and Edward, a moderate Romanist less known to 
fame. They both argued so well that nobody could decide 
between them. Neither was converted, and neither cause 
succumbed. 
In 1592 the Queen paid her second visit to Oxford. Much 
had happened in the quarter of a century since she had ridden 
away. Her power and her success were now undoubted. Her 
reputation filled the world. The days of peril and uncertainty 
were over. But the days of youth, romance and passionate 
enthusiasm were over too. Leicester was dead. Burghley had 
outlived his friends and most of his own children. The England 
which he and his Mistress had exalted was turning already towards 
new ideals. The contemporary account of the visit written by 
a Cambridge observer is rather joyless and censorious in tone.+ 
Yet Elizabeth still held the hearts of her subjects, and the 
welcome of scholars and citizens in Oxford must have been as 
staunchly and wordily loyal as of old. In August a Committee 
was appointed to make arrangements for the Queen’s reception, 
on the same lines as before, but with more attention, it seems, 
to order and detail. The Colleges were to be rated to contribute, 
but again Christ Church had to bear the heaviest charge.? 
Instructions were issued for Heads of Houses to deliver to their 
“companies.” All members of the University were to appear 
in academic dress—graduates in their habits and hoods according 
to their degree, scholars in their gowns and caps. Verses, pru- 
dently corrected by College Deans and others, were to be set up 
in public places. Orations were to be provided if need be. 
Lectures were to be assiduously kept. And students who could 
not gain admittance to the plays were forbidden, under pain 
“‘apparell ” lent came from John Lyly, who had recently at any rate 
been at the head of Lord Oxford’s company of players. Lyly had been at 
Magdalen ten years before. 
1 The Grand Reception and Entertainment of Queen Elizabeth at Oxford 
im 1592 was written, it seems, some Io or 11 years later by Philip Stringer 
of St. John’s College, Cambridge, one of two Cambridge representatives 
sent to attend their Chancellor, Burghley. Wood’s account (Ann, II, 
248-53) is brief. The regulations for the occasion are given in substance 
by Clark (Reg. II, 1, 228 sg.) and more fully by Twyne (XVII, 174-6). 
See also Nichols (Progresses, 1823, III, 144 sq.) and Boas (Ch. XI). 
2 Gutch (Collect. Curiosa, I, 190-1) gives a list of the incomes on which 
he thinks the Colleges were taxed. Mr. Plummer (Elizabethan Oxford, 
xxviii) finds the Magdalen contribution to be {18 1os., on an income of 
£1,200, and suggests a tax of 14 per cent. all round. I am doubtful. 
The Christ Church liber computi quoted by Dr. Boas (Univ. Drama, 253) 
puts the Christ Church charges at £177.10.9—towards which {50 was 
“allowed by the univ’sitie.”

of imprisonment and other punishment, to make “ outcries 
or undecent noyse’”’ outside. 
On Friday afternoon, the 22nd September, the Queen drove 
in from Woodstock, with a brilliant retinue of councillors and 
nobles, old and young. Bond, the Vice-Chancellor, President 
of Magdalen, Dean James of Christ Church, Cole of Corpus, 
Savile of Merton, Hovenden of All Souls, were conspicuous 
among the Heads of Houses who received her at Godstow. The 
weather was bad, but her Majesty consented to hear a speech, 
if it were not too long. Further on the Mayor and his brethren 
presented a cupful of angels. At Carfax there was a Greek speech 
from the Greek Professor, at Christ Church another welcome from 
the Public Orator, and all the way from the North Gate the 
plaudits of the scholars and the crowd. The Queen stayed 
once again at Christ Church, and as before, disputations, 
plays and sermons were among the delights provided for the 
week. 
On the Saturday the Queen appeared at St. Mary’s, where 
the stage was again erected in the church, and heard a disputa- 
tion in Moral Philosophy. Savile acted as Moderator.1 Win- 
wood, afterwards a Secretary of State, was one of the Proctors. 
Two Fellows of St. John’s, Gwinne and Buckeridge,? made the 
most successful speeches. The Queen found the Public Orator too 
long, and said so, whereupon the Proctors cut the others short. 
But Buckeridge was graciously encouraged to go on. Sunday 
was reserved for sermons and a play. On Monday and the 
succeeding days there were the ordinary lectures in Arts in the 
early morning, divinity lectures by Thomas Holland * and John 
Rainolds, Quodlibets in the Schools by Masters and Bachelors of 
Arts, and lectures in law and physic, Greek and Hebrew, if the 
full programme was carried out. On Wednesday there was a 
Music lecture with illustrations. One day the Lords of the 
Council were nobly entertained at Merton. Burghley was there, 
and Savile sang his praises. There were panegyrics too on Lord 
Howard, the veteran of the Armada fight, and on Essex, not yet 
the hero of Cadiz. And in a disputation afterwards the Greek 
Professor, Henry Cuffe, who was to die at Tyburn for his share 
in Essex’s conspiracy, discussed in a prophetic vein the question 
whether the dissensions of citizens were of service to the State. 
There was a banquet also given to the Queen’s Lords and 
1 For Savile’s speech see Elizabethan Oxford (263-71). The theses 
included “‘ judicial astrology ” and the possibility of reconciling arms and 
philosophy in a State. 
2 Gwinne or Gwynne was a dramatist and became a notable physician. 
Buckeridge was afterwards Head of his College and Tutor to Laud.

Councillors at Magdalen, which cost the College some twenty- 
six pounds. Burghley attended it and Howard and the French 
Ambassador, and many another bearer of a noble name. Buck- 
hurst, the Chancellor, was among them, and Essex and young 
Southampton—‘‘ quo non formosior alter ’’—already famous 
for his grace and charm. John Sanford, Chaplain of the College, 
described the ceremony in verses which might almost have 
deserved a compliment from Southampton’s most illustrious 
friend.t 
The chief ceremonies at which the Queen was present were the 
disputations and the plays.2. On Tuesday, the 26th September, 
she listened to arguments in Natural Philosophy and Medicine. 
Giles Thompson of All Souls, afterwards a Bishop, won Burghley’s 
praise by cutting short his compliments and proving himself 
brief, learned and discreet. A certain merry Doctor, Principal 
Ratcliff of St. Alban Hall,* being called on to consider whether 
air or meat and drink most affected the human body, challenged 
any man to prove that air alone could produce so fat a belly 
and so large a waist as his. But there is no reason to think that 
this academic humour offended the taste of the Virgin Queen. 
Dr. John Case, a man of real distinction, began a speech, but was 
stopped by the Proctors, determined that day at any rate to 
put prolixity down. Next afternoon, however, the speakers 
had their revenge. Disputants in Law discussed the question 
whether a judge ought to give judgments against his conscience. 
Disputants in Divinity, including the Vice-Chancellor, the Dean 
of Christ Church, and ten Doctors waiting in their scarlet gowns 
who never got a chance, had to decide whether it was lawful to 
dissemble in the cause of religion. Dr. Westphaling, the Bishop 
of Hereford, took so long in summing up the question, that the 
Queen, who wished to speak herself, sent twice to cut him 
short. But the Bishop had his speech by heart and »dared 
not alter or reduce it, and the Queen was so weary or so much 
annoyed that she went back to Christ Church without speaking 
at all. 
Next day Elizabeth received the Heads of Houses and others 
in her lodging, and spoke her mind to them, says Wood, “‘ in the 
1 Neither Wood nor Stringer mentions this banquet. But a Magdalen 
computus gives details of the cost. The verses written by John Sanford 
are printed by Mr. Plummer. (See Eliz. Oxf. xxviii-ix and 275 sq.). South- 
ampton was still under 20, but already a Cambridge M.A. 
2 Wood (Amn. II, 249-50) speaks of Orations provided by the Colleges 
“to be spoken to the Queen at her entrance into them,’’ some of which 
were performed. But there is no evidence that the Queen visited any 
College except Christ Church either in 1592 or in 1566.

Latin Tongue.” + But her mind was very gracious. She dwelt 
chiefly on the burden of government and her care for the State. 
She had appreciated all their exercises and their learning. But 
she valued their love above everything else. She was not too 
familiar with Latin, but a thousand tongues would not suffice 
to speak her thanks. If the University was to endure for ever, 
it must care first for the worship of God, not according to every 
man’s opinions, but as God’s law and the Queen’s required. 
She would bid them do nothing against the consciences of 
Christians. She would die rather than ordain anything for- 
bidden by Holy Scripture.? But—did she address herself par- 
ticularly to Rainolds ?—they must not go faster than the laws.4 
Every man should study to obey his superiors, not making a 
law for himself, but following the laws prescribed for all alike. 
Above all, let them be united. Unity, like obedience, was 
essential to their strength.5 
The plays provided on the Sunday and the Tuesday were 
described as mean performances by a Cambridge critic difficult 
to please. He praised the Queen’s patience in listening to them. 
But Stringer’s grudging verdict seems to be ill-founded. Money 
was not spared to make the plays effective.* The Master of the 
Revels was called in to help. Two popular Latin comedies were 
selected. One of them, Bellum Grammaticale, acted on the 
Sunday, was probably written by Leonard Hutten, who was 
said to be equally good at writing and at acting plays. It was 
a dramatic version of a well-known work, in which one of the 
Italian humanists of the Renaissance had tried to explain the 
irregularities of Latin grammar by depicting a civil war between 
the parts of speech.?, Hutten brought on to the stage in mimic 
warfare two rival Kings, the Verb and Noun, rallying the nations 
of words to their standards, falling on each other with battalions 
of Adverbs and Prepositions, Gerunds and Supines. The 
1 The Queen’s speech on Sept. 28, 1592, is given by Plummer (Eliz. 
Oxf. 271-3). See also the Fulman MSS. in Corpus Library (IV, 155° 
157°), where, however, the date is surely wrong. 
2 “Contra conscientiam vere Christianam.” 
8 A Greek and a Latin Bible had been presented to the Queen. 
* Wood says (Amn. II, 251) that the Queen “‘ schooled Dr. John Rain- 
olds for his obstinate preciseness,” before beginning her speech. 
5 Stringer’s statement that he was at the time in attendance on 
Burghley elsewhere disposes, if accurate, of the tradition, which Wood 
mentions, that the Queen stopped her speech to offer the old Lord Treasurer 
a seat (Eliz. Oxf. 261). 
® Indeed it seems that the Oxford productions were on the whole more 
lavish and elaborate than those at Cambridge. Christ Church spent 
£31.2.2 on the plays in 1592 (Boas, Univ. Drama, 253).

elaborate pedantry had its vein of wit and humour, perhaps 
more acceptable in those days than in ours. Gager’s Riuales 
was acted on the Tuesday, and with the undergraduates, we 
may be sure, it lost nothing in interest from the fact that John 
Rainolds’| attack and Gager’s answer were already known well 
in the Oxford world. Gager must have felt that he had won his 
battle when the Vice-Chancellor, the Proctors and the Dean of 
Christ Church joined the Committee responsible for producing 
the plays, and when the Heads of the University undertook to 
find substitutes for any actors unable to perform. 
On Thursday, the 28th September, the Queen took leave 
and drove away. There may be grounds for Stringer’s unkindly 
reference to the “ long tedious ovation ”’ which the Junior Proctor 
made. There may have been tedium and prolixity too in the 
loyal Latin verses hung out on the walls, at St. Mary’s and All 
Souls, at University and Magdalen, as the cavalcade wound along 
the street. The 
“‘Nympha senescentis rarissima gloria mundi” ? 
was growing old like the world about her, though no courtly 
flatterers suggested what the Nymph was unwilling to allow. 
But there was genuine affection in the tears of the people who 
crowded from all quarters to bid her good-bye. There was 
affection too in the response which she made them, in the brief 
prayer with which she parted from the Masters on Shotover Hill. 
“ Farewell, dear Oxford, God bless thee! God bless thee and 
increase thy sons!” Elizabeth, as she claimed in her speech 
at Christ Church, had done all that a ruler could do to deliver 
the nation from perils abroad and divisions at home. For the 
scholars of Oxford she had preserved their old inheritance. It 
was for them to guard it and enlarge it in the years to come.

Committee (Clark, Reg. II, i. 230).

CHAPTER XIV 
THE LATER TUDOR COLLEGES: 
TRINITY, ST. JOHN’S AND JESUS 
RINITY COLLEGE and St. John’s were founded within 
a few weeks of each other in the spring of 1555. Both 
rose upon the ruins of monastic Houses. Both owed 
their endowment to the generosity of new men, who had grown 
rich under the changes of the Tudors, but who had retained 
their sympathy with the old ideas. Sir Thomas White found 
fortune as a clothier or tailor, held London for Queen Mary 
as Lord Mayor, and gave much of his wealth to help the cause 
of education, at St. John’s, at Gloucester Hall and at the Mer- 
chant Taylors’ School. Sir Thomas Pope amassed a greater 
fortune from the opportunities open to Tudor politicians, and 
returned to the scholars of Trinity College some part of the 
spoils which he had gathered from the Church. 
Thomas Pope was a striking example of a successful official 
in Tudor days. In 1532 he was a subordinate in the Court 
of Chancery. He owed something to the patronage of Audley. 
He was the friend of a greater Chancellor, Sir Thomas More. 
He was the dear friend also of Sir Nicholas Bacon. He found 
it possible and lucrative to work with Cromwell. He became 
Treasurer of Henry’s Court of Augmentation. He had his share 
in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. One unverified tradition 
has said that his sister was a Godstow nun. At any rate he 
secured some thirty manors which had once been in the posses- 
sion of the monks, and became a great Oxfordshire landlord. 
“He could have rode in his owne lands,” says Aubrey, “‘ from 
Cogges (by Witney) to Banbury, about 18 miles.’’? Titten- 
hanger, a seat of the great Abbots of St. Albans, became his 
principal home. He received post after post, was knighted and 
admitted to the Privy Council. Under Queen Mary he enjoyed 
great influence. He worked with Bonner. He must have been 
1 Brief Lives (ed. Clark, II, 158). Pope secured properties also in Ber- 
mondsey, Deptford and Clerkenwell. He took over lands and granted 
long leases in return for large fines, which paid for the fee simple. War- 
ton’s Life of him is full of material, but should be checked by Dr. Blakis- 
ton’s more reliable accounts in his history of Trinity College (Ch. II) and 
in D.N.B.

known to Cardinal Pole. He acted for a time as guardian of 
Elizabeth. He brought her one of her earliest offers of marriage. 
He had the tact to win her confidence while retaining her sister’s. 
But he died within three months of her accession, and he would 
have felt little sympathy with the changes of her reign. His 
body, first buried in St. Stephen’s, Walbrook, was removed later 
to Trinity Chapel. His portrait, and that of the widow who 
survived him as Foundress,! hang in the College Hall. His 
“picture carved in stone” stands over the Hall door. His 
wealth, generously used, endowed more than one family which 
long maintained a connection with the College.? Most of his 
fine plate perished in the Civil War. Some of his plans have 
perished also. But his scholars still pray for the Knight, their 
Founder, and for the Lady Elizabeth his wife, deceased, “ by 
whose Liberality we are here brought up in Godliness and Learn- 
ing.” 
In February 1555 Sir Thomas Pope bought the site of 
the College and the buildings on it. Dr. George Owen, the for- 
tunate physician whose property stretched from Godstow into 
Oxford, and William Martyn of Oxford joined in the sale. On 
the 8th March Pope procured Letters Patent from Philip and 
Mary, to found a College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity 
for a President, twelve graduate Fellows and eight Scholars. 
On the 28th a Charter of Erection conveyed it to its new owners. 
A year later the revenues were handed over and the members 
began to reside. On the 1st May 1556 the Statutes were signed 
by Pope and his wife. On the 30th Robert Morwent of Corpus 
admitted the President, Thomas Slythurst, with twelve Fellows 
and seven Scholars.5 Next day Mass was said and a great 
banquet given. The early Fellows were largely drawn from 
Bachelors of Arts at Exeter and Queen’s.¢ Some were Nor- 
therners, some were from the West. But none of them, it seems, 
were strictly qualified under the Statutes, which gave a pre- 
1 Elizabeth Blount was probably Pope’s second wife. She was associ- 
ated with him in founding the College. After his death she married Sir 
Hugh Poulet or Paulet, whose descendants appear in the College history. 
(See Trin. Coll. Ch. II). 
® On this point see Dr. Blakiston’s notes (Ib. 44-9). 
® There was also to be a free school at Hook Norton, but in 1557 four 
additional Scholars were substituted for this. 
4 The President, 8 Fellows and 4 undergraduate Scholars are mentioned 
in this grant. 
5 An eighth Scholar was added in October, and 4 more in 1557. 
* Wood (Colls. 518) names 3 Fellows of Exeter, 3 Scholars of Queen’s, 
one B.A. of Magdalen and one Scholar of Corpus. Warton gives in the 
Appendix to his Life of Pope (ed. 1780, pp. 380-430) a detailed account of 
the first President, Fellows and Scholars, and he describes there many of 
the College documents, which I should have been glad to be allowed to see.

ference to Oxfordshire and to places where the Founder had 
property or ties. Later, however, the limitations in the Statutes 
brought in names from the Midlands and the South. Hamp- 
dens and Dugdales, Lenthalls and Dormers, Lucys, Fetteplaces, 
Newdigates and others began to figure in the College lists. 
Of the Founder’s many estates, Wroxton, Balscote and other 
Oxford properties were settled on the College. They were let 
for the most part on very long leases and they brought valuable 
reversions when these leases came to an end. Garsington 
Rectory was added before Pope’s death. It served to increase 
the income of the President, and it served also in time of pesti- 
lence as a refuge for members of the College. Other property 
accumulated slowly. Gifts of money and books and plate came 
in. The Founder himself contributed some vestments and some 
splendid silver At the end of the sixteenth century the external 
revenues of the College amounted to some two hundred and 
forty pounds.? But on the other hand the yearly charges came 
to two hundred and sixty-three. The seventeenth century 
brought in more endowments. In the days of James I a useful 
legacy of five hundred pounds was secured under singular if 
picturesque conditions. As the old leases fell in the College 
income advanced quickly. Before the Civil War began its 
revenues had reached six hundred pounds. 
The Statutes drawn up by Sir Thomas Pope, with the co-opera- 
tion probably of Slythurst, followed the old lines. They were 
elaborate in guarding against heresy, minute in their regulations 
for the life of the College. The President was to be a priest, 
selected by the Founder, his wife or the Visitor, from two Fellows 
nominated by election. Natives of Oxfordshire were to be pre- 
ferred. The Bishop of Winchester was made Visitor of yet another 
College at Oxford. The President was responsible for College 
discipline and College property. He had a strong voice in the 
election of Fellows 4 and a veto on their admission. With the 
help of the seven seniors he chose the other officers of the College, 
the Vice-President, the Dean, the four Chaplains, the two Bursars, 
the two Readers. One Reader was responsible for philosophy 
and logic, the other for Latin and in a less degree for Greek.

  158 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The Fellows, elected on the day after Trinity Sunday, were drawn 
in the first place from the Scholars and subjected to a year’s 
probation. The Scholars were selected by the President and 
officers. Both were to be chosen from counties or dioceses where 
the College had property or the Founder manors.1_ To Oxford- 
shire no less than five Fellows were allowed. The Fellows 
must take degrees in Arts and in Divinity, and be ordained within 
four years of their Arts degree. But marriage, heresy, mis- 
conduct, absenteeism, or a benefice or an inheritance worth a 
hundred shillings a year, put an end to their claims. It is inter- 
esting to find the old prohibition against entering religion repeated 
in a College which owed its existence to monastic spoils. The 
Scholars must know something of Latin and of plain song, must 
need pecuniary help, must be between sixteen and twenty years 
of age. Twenty Commoners and battelers might be admitted.? 
They were to be tutored by the Fellows, to pay rent, and to 
share the studies of the Scholars. A large room near the Hall 
was reserved for Peers’ sons and privileged persons. Nostrangers, 
except the Founder’s descendants or Kings and Queens, might 
stay in College overnight. There was the necessary staff of 
College servants with high-sounding Latin names.* Servitors 
were not contemplated by the Founder; but they appeared at 
an early date in the College history, and lasted till the eighteenth 
century swept them away. 
Pope was faithful to the old religion. He enjoined High 
Mass on Sundays and daily Mass on week-days before six.* 
There were to be prayers for the Founder and his family. There 
was an obit for Queen Mary. There were special festivals and 
special Masses, doles for poor prisoners in the jails of Oxford, 
twelve pence for the watchers at the Sepulchre in the College 
Chapel on Good Friday and on Easter Eve.5 The rules for 
discipline followed the familiar lines. All public conversation, 
for Scholars especially, must be in a learned language. The 
Bible was to be read in Hall, ruminated and expounded. One 
of the Scholars was to declaim afterwards, while those in attend- 
1 Failing that, the schools of Eton and Banbury might supply them. 
or at least Brackley and Reading (Jb. cap. 7). 
* In 1565 there were 17. But the caution-books show that the limit 
of 20 was exceeded and that from 10 to 25 were before long admitted every 
year. These books were the only records of admission till the Admission 
Registers began in 1648 (Tvin. Coll. 83-4). The word here for Commoners 
is ‘‘ Convictores.” 
* “ Archimagirus”” and ‘‘ Hypomagirus” for the cook and under- 
cook (Cap. 11). 
“ But he spoke of festivals “‘ Ecclesiae Anglicanae receptis et appro- 
batis ” (Cap. 12).

ance had their meal.1_ There were warnings against noise and 
tales and music, against improper games and lonely wanderings 
abroad. A “deambulation”’ in the Grove was the decorous 
way of taking exercise. Handball games were permissible. 
Shooting and stone-throwing and the bearing of arms was banned. 
But the Founder permitted good, stout sticks to be kept, for 
the protection of the College, or for the maintenance of the public 
cause. Dress was regulated, velvet, damask and satin for- 
bidden. The College books were protected from abuse. The 
College gates were guarded and truancy at night repressed. 
Cards were allowed only on special occasions, as on the festivals 
for which the College tenants sent up boars and capons and the 
President’s Rectory provided the drink. 
For commons the Fellows had twenty pence a week, the 
Scholars twelve pence, the President two shillings and eight- 
pence. At gaudies extra commons were permitted. There 
were also allowances or stipends, fifty-three shillings and four- 
pence for each Fellow, thirty-three shillings and fourpence for 
each Scholar. The President drew ten pounds a year. The 
Manciple drew the same as a Fellow,* the Master Cook the same 
as a Scholar. The College officers, moreover, had salaries as 
such, the Vice-President twenty-six shillings and eightpence, 
the Dean and Bursars thirteen and fourpence each, the Organist 
twenty shillings, the Philosophy Reader forty shillings, the 
Humanity Reader twenty-six and eightpence only. There were 
salaries too for Chaplains and servants. A poor Scholar, who 
acted as butler and porter and waited “‘ allwayes ”’ on the Presi- 
dent, received twenty-six and eightpence besides his commons. 
The barber had no commons, only a salary of thirteen and four- 
pence like the Dean. Ten pounds a year was allowed for fuel 
in Hall and kitchen, five pounds for lights, wax and wine in 
the Chapel. Chambers were allotted by the President: there 
were two or three beds, one of them a ‘‘ troclebedde,” in each. 
Living on the whole was comfortable, but the margin for con- 
tingencies was small.’ The provision for education, for lectures, 
and disputations, was unusually complete. Mathematics, dialec- 
tic and philosophy were taught from the familiar authors. 
Latin included poets, historians and orators. Greek lectures

College, 62).

5 The Statutes give (pp. 90-6) an interesting statement of the Founder’s 
endowments—valued in all at £226.11.8, a goode bore, and 6 goode 
capons—and of the yearly expenses of the College then, amounting to 
£209.11.2, a bore, and 12 capons.
-P-A-G-E-196
    160 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
might occasionally be given. The two College Readers were well 
provided with work. Even in Vacations there were to be lec- 
tures on the motions of the planets and verse-writing for the 
Scholars, while the Bachelors of Arts might experiment with 
lectures which the Masters were invited to attend. Leave was 
limited: twenty days for a Scholar and forty for a Fellow was 
therule.t A Scrutiny at Easter reviewed and regulated conduct. 
There was no lack of medizval discipline, though the Middle 
Ages had already passed away.? 
It seems that some of the Fellows themselves thought their 
Founder’s views old-fashioned. At any rate they criticised the 
Statutes. Pope was amazed at receiving their complaints. He 
intimated stiffly that, if they did not like his regulations, they 
could go elsewhere. ‘I will for no mans pleasur living breke 
my statutes,” he wrote. Two junior Fellows, ‘‘ St Simson and 
St Rudde,” caused scandal by climbing over the boundary wall 
at night. They had to confess their fault in Hall. They had 
further to provide, as a fine, two curtains of red silk “‘ to ange 
at the endes of thalter.” A letter from Pope at Hatfield explains 
that only the intercession of the Lady Elizabeth and of Lady 
Pope had saved the offenders from being ‘‘expulsed out of 
my Collegge.’’? But worse troubles for the little society lay 
ahead. One of the earliest Fellows had thrown up his place to 
plunge into Protestant polemics, and within a few months of 
the Founder’s death the new reign changed the face of religion. 
Thomas Slythurst, the first President, whom Queen Mary had 
made a Canon of Windsor, was unable to take the oath of Suprem- 
acy, and is said to have died a prisoner in the Tower. Arthur 
Yeldard became President in his place. Originally a Cambridge 
man, he had been chosen by Pope as one of his Fellows, and 
had helped in the composition of the Statutes. Libels accused 
1 There were exceptions : a Fellow might in certain cases get’90 days’ 
leave and a Scholar 40 (Stats. cap. 28). 
2 For further details see the Statutes printed in 1855, but not published, 
of which the President lent me a copy. I could wish that Dr. Blakiston 
had permitted me to consult the College documents, Registers and accounts, 
for facts which otherwise I can only refer to as stated in his volume. But 
my debt to his book, which is in a real sense the authority on the subject, 
is obviously heavy. For all details drawn solely from College sources, 
including many important details in regard to figures, buildings and 
persons, I am necessarily dependent on it: and Dr. Blakiston has drawn 
freely also on Warton and other printed materials, including some which 
are little known. I have to thank him for reading through this sketch 
before revision and for answering troublesome questions. I wish my 
obligations to his work, both general and specific, to be acknowledged 
in the fullest way. But I regret that access to the College records was 
refused.

him of ‘‘ deadly vice,’’ but those who knew him best spoke well 
of him. And if his views so changed with the changing times 
that even Leicester named him as Vice-Chancellor, his tact may 
perhaps have rendered easier the submission of his colleagues. 
It is not probable that many of these colleagues were removed 
on Elizabeth’s accession.1 But Bishop Horne’s Visitations in 
156r and 1566 must have severely tried those who clung to the 
old faith. ‘Crosses, Sensars, and suche lyke fylthie Stuffe”’ 
—the Bishop did not mince his language 2—were removed from 
the Chapel: and there were several resignations or ejections 
in the years that followed.? Some went to Douai or to Rome. 
Some withdrew to Gloucester Hall. Thomas Forde shared 
Campion’s fate. Richard Blount, a nephew of the Foundress, 
found his way with other Oxford men to Rheims.t But the 
troubles passed and the College settled down into prosperity 
during President Yeldard’s long reign of forty years. Its resources 
at first may have been rather narrow, its space, as numbers 
increased, rather cramped. But the Fellows and Commoners 
at any rate had their comforts. The College could afford to 
spend a little on its garden, its paved alleys, its rosery, its plum- 
trees.5 It had to spend on its hospitalities, whether it could 
afford it or not. It had to spend on medicines also, when the 
pestilence attacked it, to fly for refuge to Garsington or Wood- 
stock. It had time for plays and time for gossip. But it had 
also its discipline and punishments, fines, loss of commons and 
the rod. In the seventeenth century President Hannibal Potter, 
ejected by Parliament and restored by the King, is alleged to 
have whipped a Scholar with a sword at his side, who was leaving 
to join one of the Inns of Court.* The boys of an earlier genera- 
tion, Scholars of sixteen or eighteen, Commoners, little fellows, 
1 Dr. Blakiston thinks (Tvin. Coll. 76) that 5 Fellows and some 
Scholars quitted their places in 1560-1, but not all necessarily on con- 
scientious grounds. The College records do not seem to give much assist- 
ance here. Dr. Gee (Elizabethan Clergy, 136) gives no Fellow of Trinity 
in his list of Fellows deprived in 1559, and Tierney in his imperfect cata- 
logue (Tierney’s Dodd, II, App. xliv) mentions only two, Leonard 
Fitzsymons and Thomas Scott. Wood (Amn. II, 146) adds Thomas 
Forde. Of these three it seems that Scott was Proctor in 1560, that Fitz- 
symons incepted in 1563, and Forde in 1567 (Boase, Reg. I, 224, 240 and 
251). Fitzsymons, adds Dr. Blakiston (77), did not resign till 1577.

who might be only eight or nine or ten, took their whippings 
probably in less incongruous attire. 
The reign of Ralph Kettell, who succeeded Yeldard in 1599, 
and who lived to see the first mischiefs of the Civil War, was 
even longer than Yeldard’s. He had been nominated as a 
Scholar by Lady Pope. He left his mark in many ways upon 
the College, and its archives are still full of his notes and memor- 
anda.! A very tall man, with sharp, grey eyes and “a terrible 
gigantique aspect,” he had habits which made him feared, 
respected, laughed at, loved. Aubrey, who could just remember 
him, has drawn his portrait.2 “He dragg’d with one foot a 
little by which he gave warning (like the rattlesnake) of his 
comeing.” He sang a shrill high treble. He preached strange 
sermons. He would ride off to preach at Garsington, with 
a boy before him and a leg of mutton and some College bread. 
«He was a right Church of England man,” but he had no great 
stock of learning. His brain, said a contemporary, was like a 
“hasty pudding, where there was memorie, judgement, and 
phancy all stirred together.” His eccentricities were sometimes 
embarrassing. He had a great gift of scolding in Latin. But 
he also had queer terms of abuse—Tarrarags and Scobberlotchers 
—for “the idle young boies”’ of the College. He would go 
up and down the College and peep in at the keyholes, to see 
whether the boys were reading or not. He could not stand 
long hair. He would bring into Hall a pair of scissors inside 
his muff, and “ woe be to them that sate on the outside of the 
table.” 
“‘T remember he cutt Mr. Radford’s haire with the knife that 
chipps the bread on the buttery-hatch, and then he sang (this is in 
the old play—Henry VIII—of Grammar Gurton’s Needle). 
And was not Grim the collier finely trimm’d ? 
Tonedi, Tonedi. 
‘Mr. Lydall,’ sayd he, ‘how do you decline tondeo? Tondeo, 
tondes, tonedi?’” 
He would bring his hour-glass to lectures, and if the boys did 
badly threaten to bring another glass two hours long. He 
insisted on having excellent beer in College, so that no man

speaks of an “‘ original draught ” of Kettell’s Register, in Kettell’s own 
handwriting, among the Wood MSS. in the Ashmolean (8490). But this 
MS., now Wood F.28 in the Bodleian (ff. 172-186), contains little more 
than a list of some 150 early ‘“‘ Alumni” of the College, with notes on 
benefactions, principally books. Following these (ff. 188 sq.) are some 
notes, headed ‘‘ Ra. Bathurst,” on the history, members and benefactors 
of the College.

might be tempted to go to ale-houses for worse. ‘‘ He was a 
person of great charity.’ He would sometimes slip money 
surreptitiously in at the windows of very poor scholars. He 
was generous to servitors and to industrious tenants. For all 
his oddities he was a strong ruler and a strong man. 
Some eight hundred Commoners seem to have been admitted 
to Trinity during Kettell’s long administration. He restored 
and enlarged the College buildings. He improved the revenues. 
Rents went up, and leases began to fall in. He invented a 
plate fund to which Commoners had to contribute.1 He started 
a fund for voluntary subscriptions from all Fellows or Scholars 
who came into property or livings. His Decretum de Gratiis 
Collegio rependendis was adopted in 1602. He obtained from 
Oriel a long lease of Perilous Hall in Candich, and built there a 
fine house which still bears his name. He had no love for cour- 
tiers, but he made liberal preparations to receive members of 
both Houses at Trinity, when the plague drove Parliament to 
Oxford in August 1625. He had no love either for Archbishop 
Laud. He had no love for the tests imposed by the Long Par- 
liament : he was an old man then and had taken many oaths. 
The Civil War revolutionised the world about him, interfered 
with his autocracy, disturbed his peace. He became severe and 
peevish. The Court lords earned his sarcasms. The Court 
ladies of light character had to face still heavier rebukes. But 
his rules of order and of conduct fell perhaps upon unheeding ears. 
Trinity scholars were already working at the trenches when 
in July 1643 in an unquiet world the President died. 
The Civil War brought disaster to the Colleges, and at Trinity, 
as elsewhere, their history almost ceased. The Registers were 
interrupted. The accounts disappeared. The fine plate went 
for his Majesty’s service,? though Pope’s famous gilt chalice 
and paten were saved, and the College still holds the King’s 
receipt for an earlier gift of two hundred pounds. Only three 
Commoners, it seems, were admitted in 1643, none at all in the 
two years that followed. But those who stayed kept up the 
old traditions. All through the siege the scholars sang the 
gospel daily in the Hall, with a word of supplication for God’s 
mercy on the College, and in 1646 young Anthony Wood went 
daily to his brother, to receive instruction in his chamber, ‘‘ which

1631 (Trin. Coll, 107-8). 
2 But in the Visitors’ Register there is a reference, under May 12, 
1648, to the discovery of a supposed box of plate belonging to the College 
(Burrows, Register, 80). On such rumours perhaps Wood founded an 
amusing story (Ann. II, 624-5), which should be taken with reserve.

was a cockle loft over the common gate.” 1 Trinity men served 
on the King’s side—Sir Thomas Glemham, who had to surrender 
Oxford to Fairfax, among them. But there were Trinity men 
also among the “rebels.” Hannibal Potter, the Royalist Presi- 
dent of 1643, accused of timorousness by some critics, besought 
Convocation to ‘‘ take all things patiently ’’ and perhaps relied 
on passive resistance. He was displaced in 1648 in favour of 
Robert Harris, a Puritan divine. Harris, a mature scholar of 
sixty-seven, was well known already for his successful sermons. 
“ Oh how hee would boy up a dull and sinking spirit ! how hee 
would warm a cold and frozen heart !”’ He had been originally 
at Magdalen Hall, had been driven from an Oxfordshire living 
by the Royalists, and had become a leading preacher in London. 
As one of the Parliamentary Visitors of the University he was 
marked out for promotion at Oxford. His biographer assures 
us that he was abundantly satisfied with ‘‘ the smalness of the 
Colledge ’”’ whose Headship he received, though he “stuck at” 
the parsonage attached; and he settled down there quietly, 
though his wife, poor lady, was for a time “ delivered up to 
Satans buffetings.” Harris must have had some capacity for 
making friends. He “took a great deal of contentment in the 
Fellows,” and he appears to have governed the College with tact 
and moderation in difficult days.? 
In May 1648 thirty-eight resident members of Trinity® 
were summoned before the Parliamentary Commission, and we 
possess the answers of several who appeared. Thirteen sub- 
mitted immediately, and two or three others, including Ralph 
Bathurst, before long. Others fenced with the Visitors’ ques- 
tions. In the end, it seems, some ten or twelve Fellows and 
Scholars, ten Commoners, and one or two servants were con- 
demned as contumacious.4 But it does not follow that they 
1 See Wood’s Life (I, 129). Edward Wood was admitted Scholar of 
Trinity in 1643 (Trin. Coll. 134). He submitted to the Parliamentary 
Visitation in 1648 (Burrows, Visitors’ Register, 40). 
2 See The Life and Death of Robert Harris, D.D., by W. D. his dear 
Friend and Kinsman (William Durham). Wood’s view is less appreciative 
(Athena, I, Ixvi and III, 458-60), and probably less just. Many of 
Harris’ sermons were published. See also Madan (Of. Books, II, 
468-9). 8 They included 3 Fellows, 9 Scholars and 26 Commoners; and the 
answers of those who appeared are given by Prof. Burrows (Reg. 39-40, 
109, 120-1). 
«I understand this to be Dr. Blakiston’s view (Trin. Coll. 140-2). 
But it is difficult to be sure about the figures. The entries and orders 
in the Visiting Register are not free from confusion, and the sentence of 
expulsion was not always carried out. Prof. Burrows estimates that 12 
were expelled and that more than double that number submitted (Register, 
571). But his general view is that parties at Trinity were more evenly
-P-A-G-E-201
  
  THE LATER TUDOR COLLEGES 165 
were all expelled. In some cases the sufferers even received 
grants of money from the College. For all the bitterness of 
faction, the sense of comradeship in Oxford and in English 
politics prevailed. Some new Fellows and Scholars were ap- 
appointed. Discipline within the College walls improved. 
Sermons and prayer-meetings, no doubt, came with it. But 
disorder and drinking declined. In December 1658 President 
Harris, as a critical biographer puts it, “spit up those lungs 
which he had wasted in the Pulpit.” President Goodwin of 
Magdalen wrote off in hot haste to Richard Cromwell, himself 
barely seated on a tottering throne, ‘to prevent the College 
from a choyce,”’ and to put in a nominee of his own. The Pro- 
tector, however, there being no Bishop of Winchester, selected 
one of the old Fellows, William Hawes. Hawes lived less than 
a year. Seth Ward, a Cambridge man incorporated at Wadham, 
succeeded—“ so prudent, learned, and good a man,”’ cries Aubrey, 
“that he honours his preferment as much as the preferment 
does him.” But Ward, though a Royalist, had to make way, 
on the Restoration, for Dr. Potter to return. In 1664 Hannibal 
Potter died, and was buried in the Chapel. And Ralph Bathurst, 
for long the most conspicuous of the Fellows, began his memorable 
reign of forty years. 
President Bathurst was one of thirteen or fourteen brothers, 
six of whom are said to have died in the service of the King. 
His mother, “an angelique creature,” had been a step-daughter 
of old Dr. Kettell. His father, ‘‘an indifferent scholar, red 
fac’d, not at all handsome,” had won his wife, gossip said, by 
his thrift. Dr. Kettell, peeping, as his way was, through the 
keyhole, had seen him mending his old breeches, and had selected 
him as a son-in-law on that account. Be that as it may, Ralph 
Bathurst soon made his mark. Scholar of Trinity in 1637, 
Fellow in 1640, he turned to medicine when the Royal cause 
went down. He seems then to have practised for a time among 
the sick and wounded of the Navy. But in 1654, if not earlier, 
he was back in Oxford, where he soon became a leading figure 
in his old College. Submitting to the new order, he helped 
President Harris to steer the Society through the troubles of 
the Commonwealth. He practised medicine at Oxford with 
Thomas Willis and William Petty. He joined in the Episcopalian 
services held in Merton Street in Willis’ house. He joined the 
group of scientific men who met at Wadham to anticipate the 
Royal Society of the Restoration. He wrote Latin verse. He 
divided than at most Colleges, and that most of the Non-Submitters among 
the Fellows were allowed to stay on (Jb. cxxi).

133 all told about 1651.
-P-A-G-E-202
    166 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
turned back to divinity, became a Dean and refused a Bishop- 
ric. He moved in the world and claimed that by so doing he 
was able to be of real service to his College. He numbered men 
like Evelyn, Allestree, Boyle and Wren among his friends. South 
spoke of an intimacy with him lasting nearly fifty years, without 
ever a shadow of strangeness or unkindness.1_ Even Dryden 
paid him an elaborate compliment, in verse of a quality below 
his best. 
Bathurst ruled well. He drew distinguished men to Trinity. 
He could not always resist Court influence. He did not always 
keep to the letter of the Statutes. In 1688 the College wisely 
broke through the practice of electing Scholars to Fellowships 
on grounds of seniority alone. But if Visitors interfered unduly, 
the President could speak up strongly for his Fellows’ rights. 
He was a great builder. He gave money freely, and begged it 
persuasively from others. As Vice-Chancellor he repaired St. 
Mary’s, and tried to improve the sermons. He allowed the 
King’s players to perform in Oxford once again. He did some- 
thing to check drunkenness. In 1687 a Scholar, who was also 
a Bachelor of Arts and a minor poet, was actually expelled for 
this offence. Trinity could hardly escape its share of the dissi- 
pation and failings of the time. There were laments over the 
increase of luxury. How old Dr. Kettell would have “ raunted 
and beat up his kettle drum ”’ if he had lived to see it! Periwigs 
became a source of expenditure and even scandal. Laced bands 
and fringed gloves occupied the thoughts of Gentlemen Commoners, 
who, however, were not above bringing back hampers to Oxford 
with them. Yet Bathurst was undoubtedly justified in claiming 
that the College flourished during his reign. It stood high in 
Oxford and in the opinion of the world. John Harris, a Scholar 
of the last years of Charles II, speaks of it as “ very famous 
and full of students,” conspicuous for its exercises and its lec- 
tures.2 And if Bathurst sometimes valued discipline too highly, 
and walked whip in hand in the Grove of a morning, his sense 
of humour, his kindliness and understanding, won the affection 
of the community he ruled. 
In the records of the College many famous names appear. 
Thomas Allen was an Elizabethan Scholar who retired to Glou- 
cester Hall, and won there the reputation for mathematics and 
astrology which so perplexed his age. His servitor would declare 
that he sometimes met “the spirits comeing up his staires like 
-bees.”® Richard Busbye, a batteler of 1582, may or may not

THE LATER TUDOR COLLEGES 167 
have been the father of the great Headmaster.1 Henry Cuffe, 
another well-known Elizabethan, resigned his Fellowship at 
Trinity in 1584, and passed on to Merton where Savile proved 
a friend. His dismissal from Trinity was attributed to the 
Foundress, who may have heard gossip about him,? or may have 
disliked his opinions. Cuffe found the College yuraxoxgatoduevor.® 
But he won a brilliant reputation as scholar, wit and Professor 
of Greek. He welcomed Elizabeth with a Greek speech at 
Carfax in 1592. He delighted Burghley in a disputation held 
in Merton Hall. But he entered the service of Essex and shared 
his miserable fate. Essex denounced him, unhandsomely enough, 
for his evil counsels, and Cuffe was probably an unwise adviser. 
Perhaps he found Elizabethan England yvvaixoxgatodpevov 
too. The Hobys in the same age had brains as well as fortune 
and connections. Sir Edward Hoby was nephew by marriage 
to Burghley and first cousin to Sir Francis Bacon. He won favour 
alike with Elizabeth and with James. He loved learning and 
controversial theology. His ‘‘ Counter-snarle for Ishmael Rab- 
shacheh, a Cecropidan Lycaonite”’ has a forcefulness of title 
not often equalled in the world of tracts. Thomas Lodge, though 
a Lord Mayor’s son, was at Trinity, it seems, as a servitor with 
the Hobys. Poet and romancer, he worked hard for immortality 
under the shadow of greater men. Shakespeare drew from him 
the plot of As You Like It. Even critics recognised the 
“sugared sweetness” of his song. 
There is many another name in the list and many another 
trait of character which a modern President has happily recalled. 
George Calvert, who went to Trinity in 1594 as a boy of fourteen, 
became a Secretary of State, a Roman Catholic and an Irish Peer.5 
As Lord Baltimore he plunged into schemes of colonisation— 
the “ancient, primitive and heroic work of planting the world” 
—and his son and successor at Trinity afterwards founded a

Ingram’s note there quoted. 
* Cuffe was accused of making merry at the Founder’s expense. See 
the tale in Wood’s Life (I, 424). 
8 The phrase (quoted by Dr. Blakiston, Trin. Coll. 93) occurs in a letter 
from Cuffe to John Hotman, dated 8 August 1582, complaining of the 
miserable condition of some members of Trinity, and begging for Hot- 
man’s help—Hotman was a friend of Savile and of other well-known 
Oxford men—in securing his transference if possible to Merton. (See the 
second part of the Francisci et Joannis Hotomanorum Epistol@, 1600, pp. 
285-7. Here, from p. 270 onwards, several of Cuffe’s letters, written in 
1582-3, are given.)

    168 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
noble colony, which King Charles called Maryland after his own 
wife. Sir Henry Blount, whom Aubrey has commemorated, 
and who served both King and Commonwealth, thought that 
the Universities taught men to be “ debaucht.” The learning 
they picked up there had to be unlearned again, ‘as a man that 
is buttond or laced too hard, must unbutton before he can be 
at his ease.” 1 Sir Francis Verney joined the College in 1600 
as a handsome boy with noble prospects. He had high courage, 
a fine figure and a still finer taste in dress. But an unfair step- 
mother and a shrewish wife, and faults which perhaps could 
not be attributed to either, helped to deprive him of his inherit- 
ance, and to drive him into adventures which brought little 
honour to his name. He turned buccaneer and served with 
the Turks. If tradition may be trusted, he became pirate, galley- 
slave, apostate, before he ended his unhappy life. His kinsman, 
Edmund Verney, who went up to Trinity eighty-five years later, 
shared at least Sir Francis’ attention to costume. But like other 
fine young men in all ages he could not help thinking that he 
was “very frugall’’; he would have been delighted if it had 
been really possible for a gentleman at the University to live 
on less.? 
Trinity of course had her scholars and her Bishops, her soldiers 
and her Cavaliers. Robert Wright, a Fellow in the days of 
Elizabeth, and Bishop later of Bristol and of Lichfield, became 
a follower of Laud’s. In 1610 he was for a few months the first 
Warden of Wadham. He died defending his Palace against the 
Parliamentary forces in the Civil War. Robert Skinner, the 
founder of a family represented in the College for two hundred 
years, was Bishop of Oxford all through the Great Rebellion. 
Gilbert Sheldon was a great Archbishop, associated afterwards 
more closely with All Souls. In the seventeenth century Cavalier 
names are conspicuous, Craven and Wentworth, Musgrave and 
Napier, Bagot, Whitmore, Glemham, many more. Sir John 
Denham—‘‘the dreamingst young fellow” at Trinity for all 
his piercing eye—was gambler, Cavalier and poet. He had 
1 Brief Lives (I, 109-10). But Blount found also that church-going 
led his servants into debauchery. 
2 For Sir Francis Verney see Memoirs of the Verney Family (1904, I, 
47-53), and for Edmund Verney’s correspondence with his father see the 
chapter on ‘‘ An Oxford Undergraduate in the reign of James II ” in the 
second volume of the same work. Dr. Blakiston has quoted (169-72) 
some of the letters now given there. 
8 Dr. Blakiston gives (117 sq.) a long list of distinguished names and 
many interesting details about them. The memoirs and annals of the 
seventeenth century could add much more to the story, to say nothing of 
the materials accumulated in D.N.B,

afterwards a romantic and scandalous story.1_ Henry Ireton, 
admitted to the College in 1627, and Edmund Ludlow, who 
joined a few years later, were two distinguished soldiers in the 
other camp. Chillingworth, Laud’s godson, was one of the 
younger Fellows, “the readiest and nimblest disputant,’’ when 
Ireton came up. He was troubled already by the stirrings 
of conscience which made him in turn a Jesuit, a “ doubting 
papist,’ and an eloquent and lofty advocate of independent 
thought. One hopes that the story ? is untrue that Chillingworth 
reported to his autocratic godfather the idle talk of a fellow 
Collegian, Alexander Gill, who, drinking in the Buttery, toasted 
Buckingham’s assassin, and did not hesitate to express the 
opinion that the Duke had gone to Hell.* 
Gill was a friend of Milton, not the only friend of Milton 
in the College. William Craven, whose romantic life almost 
covered the seventeenth century,® went from Trinity as a boy 
to join the Prince of Orange, to serve under the great Gustavus, 
and to become the devoted servant of the Winter Queen. His 
younger brother, John, who followed him to the College, founded 
the famous Oxford Scholarships which bear his name. James 
Harrington, “a brisque, lively cavaliero”” with a “ quick-hott- 
fiery hazell eie,” served with Lord Craven. He was a friend 
of Charles I in the days of his misfortunes. But his dreams 
of democracy could not be forgiven. Oceana, for all its 
careful checks and balances, advocated a Republican ideal. 
Harrington was imprisoned on the Restoration, and his great 
book was burned at Oxford after his death. John Aubrey, the 
delightful gossip whose vivid portraits of his contemporaries 
few biographers can match, was one of the last students whom 
Kettell admitted. He went up in the year the Civil War began. 
In days of peace he “ lookt through Logique and some Ethiques.” 
War summoned him home, but he persuaded his father to let 
him go back to “ beloved Oxon againe.” From a sad life in 
the country or in London he would return again to Oxford, to

were not in that age quite unknown. 
® Cf. Aubrey (Brief Lives, I, 171), Masson (Life of Milton, 1881, I, 
207 sq.), and D.N.B. Gill, already a master at St. Paul’s, was on a visit 
to his old College. The Star Chamber sentenced him to lose his ears, one 
in London and one at Oxford. But both were ultimately saved.

s pines 1606 to 1697. If he entered the service of the Prince of Orange 
at 17, he could hardly have gone far in his studies at Trinity,

be “ much made of by the fellowes ”—and no wonder—to enjoy 
books and music and learned conversation. At Oxford even 
during the war he found the greatest felicity of his life—‘‘ Inge- 
niose youths, as rose budds, imbibe the morning dew.” 4 
The interest of the seventeenth century is not easily exhausted, 
especially when Aubrey is there to add details. Francis Potter, 
the President’s brother and Aubrey’s life-long friend, with his 
mechanical genius and his “ delicate inventive witt,’”’ deserves 
a passing word of notice, if only because he learned Greek “‘ by 
Montanus’s Inter-lineary Testament.” But he was also an 
original Fellow of the Royal Society, and an authority on the 
Number of the Beast. George Bathurst’s zeal for science—he 
had a hen to hatch eggs in his chambers and would study the 
process of generation with Dr. Harvey there*—and George 
Evelyn’s love of finery have found chroniclers to record them.* 
Samuel Parker, the Bishop of Oxford whom James II wrongly 
tried to make President of Magdalen, was a Puritan undergraduate 
in the great Protector’s day. Wood speaks of him ® as feeding 
on thin broth, fasting and praying with other students weekly, 
and attending godly meetings at the house of an old and crooked 
laundry-maid. But from being one of the “ preciousest young 
men in the University’ he became chaplain to a nobleman, 
and then apparently his fall began. A much more distinguished 
undergraduate, John Somers, who went up in 1667, became not 
only Lord Chancellor but the greatest Whig leader of his day. 
The second Earl of Shaftesbury, the ‘‘ shapeless lump ” of Dry- 
den’s polemical verse, recalled the wayward founder of that 
party. Henry Herbert shared the opinions of Somers and served 
the same great King. James Stanhope, Francis North and Spencer 
Compton were Trinity men when William III was fighting for 
his throne. Elkanah Settle, Dryden’s unequal rival, Poet Laure- 
ate to the Whig party when neglected by the Court, went up to 
Oxford some years earlier, and his Oxford friends may perhaps 
have thought more kindly than Dryden of his plays.: 
“Free from all meaning, whether good or bad, 
And in one word, heroically mad.” 
Arthur Charlett became in 1692 Master of University College 
and a familiar figure of the Oxford of his day. Trinity disdained

no form of talent or distinction, and has reason to be proud of 
many of her sons. 
Sir Thomas Pope took over the old buildings of Durham 
College.1 His Fellows found the fifteenth-century quadrangle 
ready-made. The Gateway near the corner of Balliol, with its 
arch and postern, was still older.? It fronted on Candich, the 
broad way stretching beside the moat and City wall. To the 
East of the Gate were three or four old dwellings, Banner Hall, 
Bodyn Hall, Brackley Hall and Perilous Hall: the row of poor 
cottages in front of them encroached on the wide street. The 
path which ran from the Gate to the door of the quadrangle had 
strips of garden ground, as it approached the College, upon 
either side. The quadrangle itself had still the monks’ old 
Chapel, or rather their new Chapel erected in 1406, with its three 
altars, its “litill payre of orgaynes, and a Vestre on the Northe 
side of the Quere.” It lay to the East of the entrance. It was 
rather shorter than the present Chapel, and it had three fine 
Perpendicular windows looking to the South. Aubrey thought 
the paintings in them better than those of New College, but he 
was of course a Trinity man. “In the time of presbytery 
government ”’ this fine glass was taken down. Dr. Kettell is 
said to have saved the painted altars by telling Lord Saye that 
the College regarded them ‘‘no more than a dirty dish-clout.” 
But even this singular apology did not prevent Dr. Harris’ 
advisers from colouring them green.4 Sir Thomas Pope’s widow 
buried her husband in the Chapel and built a beautiful monument 
over his remains. 
1 The authority for these buildings is the Survey already referred to 
(ante, Vol. I, p. 136), formerly at the Chapter House in Westminster 
and now at the Record Office (Rentals and Surveys, 548). It has been 
fully used by Dr. Blakiston in his account of the old monastic College 
(Trin. Coll. Ch. 1). But Ingram (Memorials, II, Trinity, p. 6, n.) rightly 
distinguishes it from the surrender of the property to the Crown by the 
Dean and Chapter of Durham in 1545, not 1544, which was formerly in 
the Augmentation Office (Deeds of Surrender, No. 190, at the Record 
Office now). Ingram has one or two points on the buildings which fol- 
lowed: Wood and Aubrey have others. Sir R. Blomfield (Hist. of Re- 
naissance Architecture, I, 153) refers to Wren’s work : and other references 
might be given. But Dr. Blakiston’s account is the most careful and 
complete. See also illustrations by Bereblock, Loggan and Skelton. 
2 Gutch’s notes to Wood (Colls. 528) speak of it as an old Gothic gate- 
way, of three arches, with niches and shields. The drawing of it, now in 
the Library, has been reproduced by Skelton. It dated from 1397. 
But the West side of the quadrangle, including the Refectory, was built 
earlier still. 
’ The old Halls began some 4o ft. from the Gateway. The cottages 
in front were still standing in 1636 (Trin. Coll. 20).

  172 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
On the other side of the entrance, to the West, were two of 
the oldest chambers in the building. One, entered from the 
quadrangle, where the poor Scholars of the new Foundation 
lived at first, became a Common Room in the seventeenth century. 
The other, above it, is the Common Room to-day.1_ On the upper 
floor a fragment of old glass recalls William Ebchester, a fifteenth- 
century Prior of Durham. These large rooms were for living 
in and sleeping in, but they had space for studies too. The monks’ 
Refectory on the West side of the quadrangle became the Hall 
of the New College. It had a louvre over it in Bereblock’s plan. 
The rooms on the North side, including the old Warden’s chamber, 
were apportioned presumably to Pope’s Fellows and Scholars. 
The President was lodged on the East side, which remains sub- 
stantially unaltered; the best rooms at the North end became 
his dining-room and study. The Library, built in 1417 and fitted 
up a few years later,? was in the same wing, at the South end, 
on the upper floor. The earliest College Bursary and the 
Vestry, where the monks perhaps kept the treasures of their 
Chapel, were underneath. The Dissolution had stripped the 
Library of most of its possessions. But the fifteenth-century 
figures of Bishops and Saints remained. Later revolutions were 
to play havoc with the fine glass in the windows, but there are 
still fragments left of the old shields and pictures. Round the 
old buildings ran the ample grove and gardens of the College, 
where Elizabethan orchards and roseries were planted,? and 
where the Cavaliers’ ladies of a later generation held their court. 
The old buildings, no doubt, needed repairs and alterations 
when they passed into the possession of the new College. Sir 
Thomas Pope left money for the boundary wall. Before he died 
he was buying stone for it from the demolished Houses of the 
Friars. More space inside was needed. In 1573 and the years 
that follow we hear of attics added on the West side and the 
North. Stone was not the only thing the ruined Convents 
yielded. Plate and vestments, altar-cloths and missals were 
gathered to enrich the Chapel. But it was not till the days of 
President Kettell that any systematic rebuilding began. Kettell 
plunged into the task with enthusiasm. He begged succeeding 
ages to accept his reports on the subject “as a true apologie for 
those great expenses whereof ye accompts make mention.” The

phylacium of the College. The Common Room of Charles II’s day became

old quadrangle needed both enlargement and repairs. The num- 
ber of studies wasincreased. Attics were added in the East range, 
with dormers on both sides which still remain. New buildings 
were erected near the old kitchen, and new rooms made in 1605 
out of the Bursary and Vestry under the Library. In that year 
the last penny in the Treasury was spent. In 1616 the President 
repaired his Lodgings. Two years later he began digging a 
cellar under the old Refectory, which collapsed. A new Hall 
had to be built with sets of chambers over it. The Hall was 
finished in 1620 and cost about seven hundred pounds. Kettell 
Hall outside the College was built about the same time. Dials 
were set up in the quadrangle. The Library received gifts of 
books, from Lord Craven among others, and a Librarian was 
appointed in 1629. The years of war were necessarily years of 
destruction rather than improvement. But under the Common- 
wealth a good deal of planting was done in the grounds. Loggan’s 
plan shows several neat little gardens, one, dedicated to the Presi- 
dent, in front of the Chapel, another, the Bursary garden, West 
of the entrance-way, a third in the far North-Western corner, a 
fourth, for the President also it seems, East of the quadrangle. 
Beyond this the trees apparently stretched away to Wadham, 
over turf which could not yet have boasted the order and beauty 
which distinguish it to-day.? 
After the Restoration President Bathurst determined to 
reconstruct the College, ‘not to any pompous greatness,” but 
to a standard better fitted for the time. He framed a subscrip- 
tion list, headed by Trinity Bishops, used gentle compulsion to 
make rich Commoners subscribe to it, and gathered funds by 
writing ‘letters elegant in a winning and persuasive way.” 
Wren supplied plans. He would have built a great block in 
the Grove. But the subscribers wanted a quadrangle. Wren 
submitted with reluctance. He perceived that the world was 
“governed by Wordes.” If they wanted a quadrangle they 
must have it, though it was “‘ a lame one, somewhat like a three 
legged table.” So a new quadrangle was laid out beyond the 
old one. A new range of chambers rose on its North side, an 
early example of Wren’s Renaissance work. It appeared in 
Loggan’s view a few years later. But it was afterwards altered 
and its character destroyed. About the same time a Fellows’ 
Common Room was made out of the ground-floor chamber near 
1 Apparently as a private investment by Dr. Kettell. But it was used 
by the College for Commoners after the Restoration. 
2 It was not till early in the eighteenth century that the limes were 
planted and a new formal garden laid out.

is reproduced by Skelton (Oxon, Antig. Rest. 46-7).

the entrance.’ It was beautifully panelled in 1681. On ground 
leased from Balliol in 1675, a new kitchen with rooms over it 
was built. In 1682 the West side of the new quadrangle was 
begun.? Five years later the President built a new block of 
rooms, called after him, on the site of the old stables, South-East 
of the original quadrangle.? The rooms over the Hall and Lodg- 
ings were improved. To crown all, the old Chapel, gate-house 
and treasury were demolished, and the foundation-stone of a 
new and grander Chapel was laid in 1691. The President con- 
tributed very generously. Lord Somers and Sir George Evelyn 
were among those that helped. Wren, it appears, was not 
consulted till the plan had been formed.‘ Grinling Gibbons 
carved the wood-work. Pierre Berchet painted the ceiling. 
Miss Celia Fiennes towards the end of the seventeenth century 
thought it “a Beautifull Magnifficent Structure.” 5 The four 
great windows facing South were surmounted by a balustrade. 
The tower beside them was set with statues, representing Theology, 
Medicine, Geometry and Astronomy. Rooms for a Fellow 
were made over the porch. The old home of the Durham monks 
at last was disappearing. The front of Trinity began to wear 
the aspect known to many generations of its lovers since.” 
Trinity was not the only College in Oxford which entered 
into the inheritance of the monks. Sir Thomas White shared, it 
seems, some of Pope’s opinions. He made money, like Pope.® 
He must have known something of Pope’s plans. At any rate 
he determined almost at the same moment to use his wealth 
in the same way. Born at Reading, a clothier’s son, he had been 
brought up “almost from infancy” in London,®and he had become 
1 A Bachelors’ Common Room over the Buttery was fitted up in 1685 
(Trin. Coll. 165-6).

quadrangle, rebuilt about 1728. } 
8 They have made way since for the President’s new house. ' 
« It has been attributed to Dean Aldrich, who designed All Saints’ 
Church and Peckwater Quad. But Wren’s suggestions later were, no 
doubt, of value. Sir R. Blomfield even includes an illustration of the 
Chapel in his chapter on Wren’s work. Wren had a plan for completing 
the garden quadrangle, and for replacing the President’s Lodgings with 
an arcaded wing (Trin. Coll. 163-4). 
5 See her Diary, published as Through England On a Side Saddle in the 
Time of William and Mary (27). Dr. Blakiston quotes it (164-5). Miss 
Fiennes refers to other Oxford Colleges, including ‘‘ New Colledge which 
belongs to the ffiennes’s.”’ 
® Most of these details are from Dr. Blakiston’s book (163-5).

the old gateway was removed in 1733.

a prosperous City tailor by the time that Wolsey died.1 He 
refused as long as he could to be made an Alderman. He even 
went to Newgate rather than comply. But there was no evading 
public burdens in King Henry’s day. By the end of the reign 
White was one of the leading citizens of London, and pouring 
over England ‘“‘a torrent of munificence.”” Under Edward VI 
he was one of the founders of Russian trade. He wisely held 
aloof from Queen Jane. He afterwards sat on the Commission 
for her trial. He became a Knight and Lord Mayor when Queen 
Mary’s title was established. He gave his fellow-citizens a 
splendid Show, though he tried to restrict their expenditure in 
living. In Wyatt’s rebellion he saved the City for the Queen.? 
He received King Philip in state. He joined in the re-establish- 
ment of the Roman Catholic faith. But his wealth was probably 
never equal to Sir Thomas Pope’s, and as years passed and the 
cloth-trade declined, some of his plans had to be restricted. 
Had he not had the shrewdness to name as one of his executors 
the Master of the Rolls,’ who is said to have used the law’s delays 
with a lawyer’s adroitness to promote White’s wishes, his schemes 
of benevolence might have been further curtailed. But he was 
a great merchant, a great citizen, a man of character and large 
ideas. And in May 1555 he entered on the noblest of his pro- 
jects, when he obtained the Royal license to erect the College 
of St. John the Baptist on the site in Oxford which he had secured.4 
Tradition says that White saw in a dream the tree which 
should mark the spot for his foundation, a great elm out of whose 
root three others grew. He found it in the grounds of the old 
home of the Bernardines outside the City walls. Christ Church 
was ready to part with a property of little value. The Hall for 
students recently established may have been at a low ebb. At 
1 He was probably Master of the Merchant Taylors Company in 1535. 
See for White’s life Clode’s Early History of the Guild of Merchant Taylors 
(II, Chaps. X, XI, and XII). See also Dean Hutton’s history of S. John 
Baptist College (Ch. II) and the authorities quoted in the Dean’s article 
in D.N.B. 
2 Lord Tennyson admitted that in his play, Queen Mary, he had done 
White’s energy and character injustice (Memoir, by his Son, II, 176). 
8 His other executor was William Roper, son-in-law to Sir Thomas 
More. 
« The Royal license, dated May 1, 1555, is numbered I. 1 among the 
documents in the muniment-room or treasury in the College tower. The 
grant of Bernard College by the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church is 
dated May 25. Wood (Colls. 535) adds that Christ Church insisted that 
the first Head (and others also failing John’s men) should be chosen from 
Christ Church, and wanted the Dean and Chapter to be the Visitor of the 
College.

  176 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
any rate Sir Thomas bought on easy terms the buildings with 
the land belonging to them, part of the Grove of Durham College, 
and possibly an additional acre and a half ‘‘in Walton field.’ + 
He endowed his College with a yearly rent due to him from 
Coventry, and with lands at Long Wittenham, Fyfield, Cumnor 
and elsewhere. He obtained in July 1558 from Doctor George 
Owen three acres of arable land outside the North gate, part 
ofthe manor of Walton, and in February 1560 he secured a lease 
from New College of one more acre of land “‘ in the furlong called 
Bemond.” # He left money which enabled the College in the 
years following his death to make several more purchases of land, 
including a part of Bagley Wood. The most important was 
the purchase in February 1573 from Richard Owen, George 
Owen’s heir, of the ‘“‘ manor of Walton with all its appurtenances 
lately belonging to Godstow,’’® a property rich in venerable 
traditions and destined in a distant future to bear fruit richer 
still. 
Apart from these purchases the College received handsome 
bequests, as time went on, from citizens of the great community 
to which its Founder had belonged. The Merchant Taylors 
made it benefactions.4 George Palin, Citizen and Girdler of 
London, left three hundred pounds for poor scholars in 1609. 
Thomas Paradyne, Citizen and Haberdasher, rivalled Palin’s 
generosity. George Benson in Charles I’s day gave a thousand 
pounds to improve the income of the Fellows. Sir Robert 
Ducie and Sir William Craven were among other London citizens 
to add to its endowments. Members of the College did their 
best to help. Bishop Buckeridge, sometime President, gave 
money to buy lands. Early Fellows like John Case assisted. 
Sir William Paddy, James I’s physician, contributed largely to

deed quoted by Dean Hutton in his history of St. John’s (7-8), and in

half. But Putmede Mr. Stevenson places near Summertown and not far 
from the Cherwell. 
2 See the documents numbered I. 6 and I. 8 in the College archives. 
“Bemond ” is of course Beaumont. The New College acre and the three 
acres bought from Owen are now, I understand, included in the College 
garden. The date of I. 8 is 1560, not 1559.

the walls on the land West and East of St. Giles’. One before the Dissolu- 
tion belonged to Oseney, the other to Godstow ; but the boundaries be- 
tween the two even Mr. Salter, to whom I owe these suggestions, cannot 
define. The latter apparently, to which the name of Bradmore may some- 
times have been applied, reached on the-East to the Cherwell and on the 
South to Holywell manor.

the Library, the organ and the choir. Archbishop Laud, an 
unfailing friend in his lifetime, left bequests which never reached 
the College, but Archbishop Juxon bequeathed to it seven thou- 
sand pounds. St. John’s grew from comparatively small begin- 
nings, and the fortunes of its Founder failed. But as the years 
passed and its needs were recognised, it had no reason to complain 
of the liberality of its friends. 
The Royal license contemplated a College of a President and 
thirty Scholars more or less, for the study of theology, philosophy 
and good arts. On May 29, 1555, Sir Thomas White’s founda- 
tion-deed nominated the first President, Alexander Belsire, and 
the first four Scholars.1 On June 18 the new Fellows took 
possession of their home.?- But on March 5, 1558, a further deed 
enlarged the Founder’s plans.’ Civil Law, Canon Law and 
Medicine were added to the subjects to be studied.4 The Fellows 
and Scholars were increased to fifty. Chaplains, clerks and 
choristers were named. The Statutes were revised and added 
to before the Founder died, for White remained to the end in 
close touch with his College. And on January 18, 1566,° St. 
John’s was formally incorporated as a member of the University,® 
and admitted to all the liberties and franchises which other 
Colleges possessed. 
The Statutes of Sir Thomas White followed for the most part 
the customary lines, and they did not disdain the customary 
verbosity.? A President and fifty Fellows were to rule this

though the deed also speaks of three.

—as Mr. W. H. Stevenson kindly pointed out to me—to receive the pro- 
perty from Christ Church and to hand it over to the new owners. 
® I. 5 in the College archives. 
4 One-fourth of the Fellows and Scholars were to study Civil and Canon 
Law, and there were elaborate rules for their selection. One only was to 
study medicine, the rest the liberal arts ‘‘ ac demum theologiam ’’ (Statutes 
cap. 16). 
5 Dean Hutton (St. John’s, 16) gives 1567. But I think it is clear from 
the deed in the College archives (I. 9) that the date was January 1566, 
and the entry in the University Register (KK, £. 18%) appears, though not 
explicitly, to confirm this.

Library of the University of Cambridge (Stats. of Oxford Colls. III). But 
the original Statutes are in the College muniment-room, signed by the 
Founder and others on 14 May 1562. They were added to later: the 
Founder revised his regulations more than once. Mr. W. H. Stevenson 
has collated the original with the printed text: the differences are not 
very important, though the wording and the numbering of clauses varies : 
in one or two cases of figures the original supplements the printed text.

vineyard of the Lord. Three Chaplains, four clerks and six 
choristers stood next them. The President had the usual duties : 
in grave matters he must have the Fellows’ assent. He was to 
be elected by the majority of them 1 from present or past Fellows 
of the College, or, failing that, from present or past Canons or 
Students of Christ Church. He was to be instituted by the 
Dean and Chapter.?- He must observe the Founder’s Statutes 
and accept nothing repugnant to them: but he would obey the 
rulings of the Bishop of Winchester in case of doubt. His absence 
from College was limited to two months in each year. A Vice- 
President, in constant residence, with disciplinary powers, three 
Deans or Censors, one in Theology and two in Arts,* two Bursars 
—dispensatores—all chosen by the President and the ten Senior 
Fellows, were to assist in governing the College. The ten seniors, 
the Decemviri, had no mean authority within its walls.¢ Foun- 
der’s kin might be elected Fellows without probation, Most 
other Scholars, poor clerks between fourteen and nineteen, must 
go through a three years’ probation first, and must swear that 
they intended to stay and study for at least five years in the 
College.® Probationers were to be called Scholars not Fellows. 
The Chaplains and Chapel officers were not to meddle in College 
business. But Fellows who were Masters of Arts were to

also in the College archives an English draft of cap. 59, obviously older 
than the Latin Statutes but not dated (I. 10), 
1 The question whether undergraduate Fellows could vote in the elec- 
tion of a President was raised at Laud’s election in 1611. The Visitor 
ruled that it was “ more than evident ” that all the Fellows must be pre- 
sent at the election, and that the words of the Statutes required “‘ the voice 
of euerie fellowe present, be hee non graduate or graduate, to be given.” 
(See Bodl. MS. Tanner 338, f. 350, Hutton’s St. John’s, 118 sq., and Stats. 
of Colis. St. John’s, pp. 14-17). Others might read the Statutes differently, 
and the Visitor’s ruling does not account for the word graduati (Stats. 
Pp. 15). * Or, failing the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church, by the Chancellor 
or Vice-Chancellor (Ib. cap. 6).

« They were to be graduates (cap. 9). The Fellows were divided into 
three classes, first, the ten senior graduates in arts, theology and law, 
secondly, the twenty graduates next in seniority, and thirdly, the last 
twenty, whether graduates or not (cap. 40). 
5 The Jurists, however, became full Fellows without regard to the rule 
about probation (Stats. cap. 16). Probationers must not have incomes 
over £5 a year, The MS. Statutes make this clear, though the figure 5 
is omitted on p, 29 of the printed Statutes, 
* The Statutes mention (cap. 4) 3 sacerdotes, 4 clerici, 6 choristae ; 
later on (cap. 19) they are described rather differently. They included a 
Precentor and a Sacristan, an Organist and a Sub-Sacristan, Later again 
(cap. 20) 4 servants of the choir are spoken of, to be added when funds 
allowed. Masses and prayers were ordained.

take Orders within three years of completing their necessary 
Regency.1 St. John’s men must not forget their obligations 
to the Church. 
Elaborate rules were included in the Statutes to encourage 
study and the taking of degrees. There were to be daily lectures 
from three Readers or Professors, in Greek, rhetoric and logic.? 
The Lecturers were if possible to be Fellows, and to receive 
beyond the regular allowances five pounds a year. If outsiders 
of incomparable excellence were appointed, their salary might 
be increased. Besides these a Lecturer in Natural Philosophy 
or metaphysics might be appointed, and paid two shillings a 
week, half by the College and half by his audience. Provision 
was made for other lectures in theology and philosophy, for 
disputations, for Latin conversation. Vacation studies were 
arranged for Bachelors, in mathematics and the operations of the 
planets. The old rules against solitary walks, sumptuous clothes, 
inordinate hair reappeared. Hunting and hawking, dice and 
cards and football, singing birds and stone-throwing were banned. 
There were provisions in regard to forfeiture and leave. There 
were provisions about servants: these included a woodman and 
a clerk of accounts: the President had his own. For commons 
there was a three-fold scale, explained in the wordiest language. 
The Masters and senior Fellows did best, with threepence for 
dinner and threepence for supper: we have travelled far from 
the meagre fare of John Balliol’s Scholars in the earliest days. 
The Bachelors of Arts, Probationers and undergraduates came 
in the next rank, with twopence-halfpenny for each meal. Clerks 
and choristers, with only twopence, belonged to the third. The 
President received as much as any two Fellows, but all had an 
equal portion of bread and drink. Sons of nobles and other 
students of character and standing might be admitted as Com- 
moners.4 Strangers might be invited to meals, but not as a 
tule to stay in College. Rooms were allotted by the President, 
with separate beds for lads over sixteen. But elders and juniors 
shared rooms together, so that the younger might have the 
benefits of example and reproof. 
Besides commons the President drew twenty pounds a year 
for salary, forty shillings for his clothes, and sixteen shillings for

exempted from this provision (cap. 28).

the clothes of both his servants when he had two.t The ten 
senior Fellows drew four marks for pay and twenty shillings for 
clothes, the next twenty fellows twenty-six shillings and eight- 
pence as pay and twenty shillings for clothes, the rest sixteen 
shillings for pay and ten shillings for clothes. Beyond this, 
the Vice-President and Bursars had salaries of forty shillings a 
year; the Deans had twenty-six shillings and eightpence; the 
Sacristan, Precentor and Organist had the same. The clerk of 
accounts was paid forty shillings, the head cook forty-six shillings 
and eightpence as wages and eight shillings for clothes. A 
choir-master was provided, and tutors alike for choristers and 
Scholars. There were regulations, on familiar lines and as 
elaborate as ever, for the visiting of College property, for business 
and accounts, for the guarding of books—the less valuable might 
be taken out of the Library by Fellows—for the keeping of the 
gates, for the punishment of offences, for pestilence or trouble, 
misconduct or mischance. White directed that the Statutes 
should be set in the Library, and that every Fellow should have 
a key to the door, ‘‘that he may come to know my said Statutes 
and note in them owght he thinketh in them might be re- 
formed.” The President, officers and seniors—Decemvirs— 
might frame new Statutes, provided they were not opposed 
to the old. The Bishop of Winchester, as Visitor, was to 
interpret the rules.5 Finally, just before his death in 1567, the 
Founder, mindful of his early days, made provision for forty- 
three poor Scholars, Londoners chosen by the Company of 
Merchant Taylors, with two from Coventry, two from Bristol, 
1 Statutes (St. John’s, p. 81). But there were elaborate arrangements 
for increasing and varying the clothing allowance out of the proceeds of 
the College wool (Ib. 84-5). The figures quoted here from cap. 40 of the 
printed Statutes differ considerably from those given by Dean Hutton 
(St. John’s, 41-2) which appear to be taken from President Derham’s 
abstract of the early draft contained in I. 10. 
2 There was an additional allowance ‘‘ pro presbyterio” of 26s. 8d. 
—the 20 is omitted in one place in the printed Statutes (p. 82)—if they 
were priests. Scholars “ intra triennium probationis ’’ had only tos. for 
pay. There was an elaborate scale of allowances for all services and 
ranks (cap. 40).

* An additional clause (Stats., St. John’s, p, 120) reserved power of 
altering the Statutes, after the Founder’s death, to the President and cer- 
tain selected persons, among whom Abbot Feckenham of Westminster 
(misprinted as ‘‘ Fernam ’’) and Dean Henry Cole of St. Paul’s are named. 
The second paragraph on p. 119 of the printed Statutes, intended as a 
final clause, is completed in the MS. copy at the College.

two from Reading and one from Tonbridge to complete the list.1 
St. John’s was founded in times of revolution, and its early 
Presidents encountered difficult days. Belsire, the first of them, 
lost his place in 1559, not, it seems, on account of his religion, 
as the College Register piously suggests, but owing to a serious 
difference with the Founder in connection with the College funds.? 
William Elye, Cranmer’s bitter critic, who succeeded, was prob- 
ably deprived soon after, and took refuge with the Romanists 
abroad. William Stocks or Stocke, who shared his views, stayed 
only for a short time as President, and then returned to Gloucester 
Hall, from which he had been drawn.* John Robinson, who 
came from Cambridge, enjoyed the patronage of Whitgift and 
of Cecil, which helped, no doubt, to bring him the ten livings 
and the other preferments he received. He ruled the College 
from 1564 to 1572. He saw the Founder pass away, to the last 
tenderly solicitous for his foundation, and buried him under the 
altar in the Chapel. He saw “ variaunce or strife’ arise, as 
White had foretold. In Robinson’s day and the years that 
followed several of the Romanist Fellows faced exile or imprison- 
ment or death.¢ One of them, a Bursar, inadmissible for martyr- 
dom, for he had embezzled the funds of the College, took service 
with an Austrian Archduke. Tobie Matthew, a fortunate young 
churchman who had already won the heart of Oxford and the 
favour of the Queen, succeeded Robinson and reigned as President 
from 1572 to 1577, before he passed on to the Deanery of Christ 
Church and to still higher preferment. St. John’s men, no doubt, 
heard some of the sermons “so passionately desired by persons 
of the greatest quality,” which were not the least of Matthew’s 
titles to fame. Hard days followed, two less conspicuous Presi- 
dents,5 and a struggle with poverty, more difficult than heresy 
to overcome. The choir had to be given up. The suspension 
of Scholarship elections was suggested. For lack of ready money 
the poor Scholars of the house were pinched. In 1584, the 
1 There were also to be six choristers from London. Six Scholarships 
were reserved for Founder’s kin, and the children of his servants and pren- 
tices were to have a special claim (Ib. pp. 115-9).

names 7, and Dodd’s list quoted by Dr. Gee (Elizabethan Clergy, 232-3) 
confirms this; but Dr. Gee does not think it complete. Campion of 
course was the most famous later on. See Hutton (S¢. John’s, 45-6 and 
68), and the Introduction to the Douay Diaries (xxxi sq.).

President pleaded, they had not enough even for “ necessaries for 
the back and the belly.” In 1591 the College expenses exceeded 
its revenue by a hundred and sixty-seven pounds. In 1594 the 
position was still worse. The College accounts made no mysteries : 
they were set out in plentiful detail. The entries are full of 
homely little touches—meat for the “ pigions,” hay for the 
“‘shepe,” inevitable repairs for locks and doors and buildings, 
fourpence for ferrying Mr. President “over Bagbrookhiue,” 
sixteen pence for “‘ ashes for the chitchen plompe.”’ + 
With John Buckeridge, however, elected President in January 
1605, a more prosperous and important age began. Buckeridge, 
a distinguished theologian, was chaplain to Whitgift and tutor 
to Laud. New views were coming into fashion. The Calvinists 
were not the only reformers in the Church. Royal visits to St. 
John’s began. James I with his Queen and his son Henry were 
welcomed at the College Gate, on entering Oxford, by “ three 
young youths” attired like nymphs to represent England, 
Scotland and Ireland, ‘‘ and talking dialogue-wise each to other 
of their state.” But the three nymphs, it seems, introduced 
themselves to the King as the Sibyls who had foretold to Banquo 
the rule of his descendants. One would like to think that their 
flight and the favour which it met with suggested a theme to 
the writer of Macbeth.2 At the performance of Gwinne’s play, 
by St. John’s men two days later,? James was so overcome with 
disputations or with feasting—no courtier would allocate the 
share of each—that he fell asleep and woke up in a bad temper. 
Buckeridge retained the King’s approval and was made a Bishop 
in 161x. Laud, who had recently resigned his Fellowship and 
was engaged in parish work away from Oxford, was nominated 
as President in Buckeridge’s place. But a fierce storm arose 
over his election. There was strong opposition from Archbishop 
Abbot and the Chancellor Lord Ellesmere. One of the Fellows, 
Richard Baylie, tore up the voting papers. The votes of the 
undergraduate Fellows were challenged. The quarrel was 
reported to the Visitor and the King. But James, when appealed 
to, confirmed Laud’s election, and before long the new President’s 
tact and ability won their way.

(St. John’s, 54-63).

knew that the story was agreeable to the King. (See Camb. Hist. of Eng.

  THE LATER TUDOR COLLEGES 183 
William Laud had come up from Reading in 1589 and had 
matriculated at St. John’s as a boy of sixteen. Next year he 
had been elected a Scholar.1 ‘‘ Low of stature, little in bulk, 
chearful in countenance,” he had soon become an influential 
Fellow. As Junior Proctor in 1603-4 he was reputed not harsh 
but “ civil and moderate ”—even to the drunken fellow sleeping 
on Penniless Bench by Carfax, who had the drowsy genius to 
bespeak him—‘ Thou little morsell of justice, prithee let me 
alone and be at rest.” But in matters ecclesiastical Laud rarely 
erred on the side of moderation, and his Catholic opinions soon 
made both enemies and friends. When his chamber fellow in 
College, John Jones, became a Romanist, some Oxford critics 
probably thought him a more consistent man than Laud. Yet, 
it seems, Laud had a right to claim that his behaviour as Presi- 
dent was reasonable and patient, for the bitter opposition shown 
at his election died away. “I governed that College in peace,” 
he said later on his impeachment, ‘‘ without so much as the 
show of a faction, all my time, which was near upon eleven 
years.” 2 He converted Baylie from an angry opponent into a 
friend and disciple. He improved the College discipline. He 
encouraged its studies. He enlarged its buildings. He more 
than maintained its numbers. When, in 1621, he handed on 
his post to Juxon, his influence in the College, if not in the 
University outside it, was assured. 
Laud’s influence was destined to grow stronger daily in the 
State. His successor in the Presidency carried on the new 
tradition. Elected as a Scholar of St. John’s from Merchant 
Taylors’ School in the days of Queen Elizabeth,* William Juxon 
could remember the Armada, and he lived to see the second 
Charles restored. As an Oxford undergraduate he studied Civil 
Law. He seems afterwards to have joined Gray’s Inn. But 
in 1609, having taken Orders, he became Vicar of St. Giles’, a 
College living, and was for a time a well-known preacher in 
Oxford. He passed to the Rectory of Somerton but returned 
to the College as President in 1621. He was Vice-Chancellor 
later, and when Laud succeeded to the Chancellorship, he became 
his chief correspondent and representative in the University. 
He was his helper and ally in University reform. But Juxon

England, (See Foster, Gray’s Inn Admission Reg. 211),

had a gentleness unknown to his great colleague, and though 
even in his day St. John’s did not escape quarrels and disorder, 
he avoided the hatreds which Laud’s high-handed ways provoked. 
In 1633 Laud became Archbishop and passed on to his friend 
the great Bishopric of London. But Juxon never forgot his 
old College. When the dark days of rebellion were over—days 
in which, tradition says, he solaced himself by keeping hounds 
and by reading the Church services at Chasleton—he was 
appointed Primate. Less than three years later he was buried 
in St. John’s Chapel with great solemnity beside the Founder, 
and Laud’s remains were brought to keep him company. Juxon 
left his College a great legacy. Few of its sons bequeathed to 
it a nobler name. 
Richard Baylie, Laud’s old opponent, was elected President 
in 1633. He was destined to see many changes in Oxford before 
his long and broken administration closed. He was now a 
devoted friend of the Archbishop, who named him as Vice- 
Chancellor in 1636. That year the King and Queen visited 
Oxford, with Prince Rupert among others, a boy of sixteen, 
whose spirited “‘ unrestfulness”” had already won his uncle’s 
heart. Laud, as Chancellor, gave them a great banquet in the 
new Library which he had added to the College, 
“‘ As numerous as was great Nevils feast,” 
at which Baylie, no doubt, played his part. The dinner was 
followed by a play in the Hall—Love’s Hospital, by George 
Wilde, a Fellow of the College—for which John’s men provided 
all the actors. “It was merry,” said the Archbishop, “ and 
without offence.” In the middle of the play there was another 
short banquet. Next day, after the King’s departure, Laud 
entertained the Heads and Doctors of the University at St. 
John’s. He spared no cost and charged nothing to the College. 
He continued to take the closest interest in its buildings and its 
property—even in the details of the kitchen book. His bene- 
factions and his powerful protection helped to make Baylie’s 
Presidency for some time a period of great success. The College 
did not escape the payment of Ship Money: an item of thirty- 
1 Juxon was nominated to Hereford first, and resigned the Presidency 
in January, some months before his appointment to London. 
2 Rupert’s name was entered on the College books. So was the name 
of the Elector Palatine, his elder brother, who was a member of the Royal 
party (Laud, Works, V, 150). 
® It is stated that the Archbishop spent the very large sum of £2,666 
on his entertainments at Oxford (Cal. of State Papers, Domestic, 1636-7, 
P- 477):

four shillings under this head appears in the College accounts.! 
But its finances prospered. Its revenues rose, it is alleged, to 
fifteen hundred a year.2 Its numbers were considerable.? The 
College stood high in Royal favour and was closely linked with 
the dominant party in the State. 
But when that party fell, the fortunes of St. John’s fell with 
it. In March 1641 Laud was in the Tower. In January 1643 
the College plate was put at the King’s disposal. Some eight 
hundred pounds had already been sent him six months before. 
But Charles’ need was pressing, and the Fellows were reminded 
that their Sovereign’s sufferings were theirs. A few months 
later the King was asking for contributions to pay his foot- 
soldiers, with the reckless assurance “in the word of a King” 
that the charge should be imposed only for a month.5 Boys 
from Merchant Taylors’ School, who during the War could not 
get to St. John’s, were allowed to study at Cambridge. But 
John’s men played their part with others in the Royal service, 
laboured in the trenches and suffered in the field. The most 
conspicuous of them all was sent to the scaffold in January 
1645, to the last tenderly remembering his old College, and 
asking to be buried quietly in its Chapel. ‘ God’s everlasting 
blessing be upon that place and that society for ever!” 
Three years later the Parliamentary Commission was at work. 
An order of the Committee of the House of Commons removed 
Dr. Baylie from the Presidency. In vain the President con- 
fronted the Visitors, argued, resisted, and clung to his house. 
Force was resorted to and the Doctor ejected, his wife and “ six 
pretty children’”’ with him. The Fellows met the Visitors’ 
demands with the usual argumentative evasions. Out of thirty- 
six members of the College, whose answers are recorded, only

Poor Scholars and 14 servants—are higher than the figures quoted by 
Dean Hutton (148-9) for 1641 or about that time. They are based on

subject in the Register (323 sq.). Ingram quotes (Memorials, II, New Inn

Baylie to be put on money coined from the St. John’s plate.

four gave an unconditional submission.1 There were a large 
number of condemnations and removals. It seems that the 
majority of members were expelled. George Gisbey, an active 
partisan of the Archbishop, and Dr. Edwards, the Bursar, were 
arrested. The Vicar of St. Giles’, who had kept up his services 
under the enemy’s fire, was turned out. New Bursars and new 
Fellows were chosen—than whom for the most part, said one 
undiscriminating critic, “‘ there could be nothing more ignorant 
or more abject.”’ Francis Cheynell, an old Merton man, became 
President for two years. His enemies thought him not only a 
fanatic but a madman. He was an old Chaplain of Lord Essex, 
a fighting Presbyterian and a strong partisan. Cheynell was 
one of the most unpopular of the Parliamentary Visitors, and 
pursued Chillingworth with anathemas even at the grave. Thank~- 
ful Owen, a young Fellow of Lincoln, succeeded in 1650, He 
too was a conspicuous member of the victorious party, one of 
Cromwell’s Visitors, and a man of strong opinions. But he had 
learning, Latinity, and a fine taste in composition. He had 
also an excellent temper, and apart from strictures passed on 
his way of granting leases, he seems to have governed the College 
well.2- Owen could not expect to survive the Restoration. He 
was turned out in 1660, and Baylie returned. The old habits 
were resumed. Choir and surplices reappeared in the Chapel. 
Clarendon, as Chancellor, dined in the College. Juxon was 
buried there in state, and his great benefaction followed him. 
Tobias Rustat, Yeoman of the Robes and Under-Housekeeper 
to the Honour of Hampton Court, gave money to keep the anni- 
versaries of Edgehill, of Charles I’s ‘‘ unparalleled parricide,” 
and of Charles II’s return. And late one summer’s night Laud’s 
coffin, brought from London, was laid with almost ostentatious 
privacy under the stones of the College which he had beautified 
and loved. 
In 1663 the King and Queen visited Oxford and were received 
with rapture at St. John’s. In the Library a Gentleman Com- 
moner, inspired by the celestial globe at his side, expressed with

College 34 were certainly expelled and 11 other cases are doubtful, ae

138, 145, 198), absent members (164), and new men introduced a

a strange mixture of clumsiness and freedom the hopes of the 
nation for an heir to the throne— 
“Whilst Angells propagate, and you display 
A little Charles his Waine, and Milky-way ... 
Perfection, Maddam, from y? Selfe must grow : 
Kings are imortall, but Queenes make y™ so.”’! 
Charles, it is said, asked the College to give him the curious 
portrait of his father, over which in a minute hand the penitential 
psalms are written. The Fellows complied unwillingly, and 
when the King, on leaving, inquired what he could do for the 
College, they adroitly begged the portrait back again, A few 
years later Baylie, who had declined a Bishopric, was buried in 
the little mausoleum which he had built to the North of the Chapel 
altar. His son-in-law, Peter Mews, “an old honest cavalier,” 
was elected President in 1667 on the demand of the King. He 
had served in the Guards through the Civil War. He had received 
near thirty wounds and been taken prisoner at Naseby. After 
that he had been an adventurous Royalist agent until he found 
rest and preferment in the Church. At Oxford he entertained 
the Prince of Orange and befriended Anthony Wood. When 
he passed to a Bishopric he retained his Cavalier opinions, and 
lent his horses to draw the Royal cannon to Sedgemoor. But 
he retained also his attachment to the Church of England, and 
stood by the Fellows of Magdalen in their struggle with the King.? 
Dr. Levinz, in due course a medical Doctor, a Professor of Greek 
and a Canon of Wells, succeeded Mews in 1673, and governed the 
College almost till the century closed. His reign saw a visit 
from James while Duke of York. It saw also a company formed 
at St. John’s to fight for King James in Monmouth’s rebellion. 
The College was doing well. It kept up its connection with 
Reading and London. In 168z it was rated at four hundred 
pounds a year for taxes, not among the richest Colleges, but just 
after them. Its establishment was modest. Its Fellows, if bent 
on comfort, still needed private means to pay their way. The 
requirements of the Statutes still held good, though breaches 
occurred and complaints about them. Young men of fashion 
are found in the lists. The expenses of one of these, Sir John 
Williams, are recorded. He went up in 1660, and his uncle 
doled out his funds. But even under careful tutelage he seems 
to have spent over two thousand pounds during his four years

of residence. A gentleman of the Restoration had his obliga- 
tions. They included a present of ‘‘ six paire of long fine white 
gloves’”’ for the President’s wife.t 
Apart from Presidents and men of fashion, St. John’s had 
its distinguished sons. In Elizabethan days names of note, 
Talbot and Stanley, are found in the College. Bereblock was 
there, before he passed to Exeter, and his famous drawings were 
long kept in the President’s Lodgings. Neale, who wrote the 
verses which went with them, was a New College man but Bel- 
sire’s nephew. Edmund Campion was one of the first Scholars, 
and a special favourite with the Founder. He spoke of White 
with real feeling at the time of his death. 
“ For the last ten years he has devoted all his thoughts, his money, 
and his labour to us. When he was away from Oxford his heart was 
there. Awake or asleep of us only did he think.” 
Campion was a brilliant preacher in the University, till his 
religious opinions drew him into more dangerous paths. John 
Case, elected to a Scholarship in 1564, became a well-known figure 
in Oxford. Physician, theologian and philosopher, he received 
pupils and “ coached” them in his house in St. Mary Magdalen 
Parish on the North side of the George Inn. His sympathies 
were Catholic, some people thought Romanist. He was a skilled 
musician. His book on Ethics was the first production of the 
Oxford Press of 1585. His manual of political philosophy * was 
regarded as essential for Bachelors of Arts. He contributed 
to the College endowments. He married the widow of a 
Keeper of Bocardo prison. He died in 1600, very generally 
respected, and his virtues and accomplishments were recorded 
on the Chapel walls. Shirley and Davenant recall the same great 
age. John Davenant, innkeeper and vintner, Shakespeare’s host 
on his visits to Oxford, and Mayor of the city in 1622, apparently 
sold wine to the College. His eldest son, Robert, became a 
Fellow there. Aubrey had heard Robert say that Mr. W. Shake- 
speare had “‘ given him a hundred kisses.’’4 James Shirley, 
Wood tells us, was befriended by Laud. But Laud is said to

have insisted that a large mole on his left cheek unfitted him 
for Orders, and he left no traces behind him, if he was ever at 
St. John’s.1 Cambridge has a better claim to have inspired his 
dramas, to have trained the voice which sang 
“The glories of our blood and state 
Are shadows, not substantial things.” 
Playwrights of less fame than Shirley won credit and popu- 
larity in the College. Matthew Gwinne, like Case, was both 
physician and musician. He excelled in disputation. He wrote 
epigrams and sonnets. He was on the Committee which provided 
the Christ Church plays for the great Queen’s visit in 1592. His 
Vertumnus was performed before King James. His Latin tragedy 
of Nero passed through more than one edition, Abraham Wright, 
a generation later, acted in the play which the College gave 
before King Charles. He was a writer too of plays, of epigrams, 
of verses. He was no mean critic of drama and of sermons. 
Strafford and Juxon were among his heroes. The Puritans were 
unceasingly the object of his gibes. George Wilde, another 
devoted Royalist, who lived to be an Irish Bishop, was the author 
of Love’s Hospital, in which Wright played before the King. 
St. John’s had an early dramatic tradition and did its best to 
keep it alive. Thomas Tucker, the Christmas Lord of 1607, is 
commemorated in a manuscript attributed for long to Griffin 
Higgs, a distinguished member of the College, a man, like Laud, 
“of great courage tho’ of little stature,’ who lived to be a 
Royalist Dean. Higgs certainly wrote a life of Sir Thomas 
White in Latin verse. And bound up in the same volume in 
the College Library we have the “‘ true and faithfull relation of 
the risinge and fall of Thomas Tucker Prince of Alba Fortunata, 
Lord St. John’s etc. with all the Occurrents which happened 
throughout his whole Domination,” which describes the plays 
and pageantries of that famous Christmas season with a zest 
and detail worthy of a lover of the past.2_ There was a long 
list of revels. Laud was prominent among the subscribers. The 
festivities went on for many weeks. They spread to other 
Colleges. The Christ Church men were suspected of mocking

lished in 1816, in his account of the Revels of 1607-8, less than one-fourth 
of the original. I have to thank Dr. Boas and Dr. Greg—as well as the

at the John’s men,! and the whole town seems to have joined 
in to share the sport. 
Other famous names may be noted in the College lists. Sir 
William Paddy, born before the foundation of the College, was 
a Commoner # who became “‘ one of the prime physicians of his 
time.’’ He attended King James and addressed him as Solomon. 
He befriended Laud. He disapproved of tobacco. He spent 
his last years in his old College. He enriched its Library. He 
gave it an organ and endowed its choir. The College possesses 
three portraits of him. The Chapel has an elaborate monument 
to his “‘ incomparable soul.” Sir Thomas White’s step-daughter 
married a Cromwell, and two of the great Protector’s uncles 
were Fellows of the College. Bulstrode Whitelocke, who fills 
a large place in the records of the Protectorate, matriculated at 
St. John’s in 1620. His father, a Judge of the Common Pleas, 
had been elected a Scholar there in the year of the Armada.® 
Christopher Wren, afterwards Dean of Windsor, was also the 
father of amore celebratedson. Richard Spinke was a courageous 
Fellow who attacked Laud’s views of Church ceremonial. Arch- 
deacon Waple, a later benefactor, was a High Churchman who 
lived into Queen Anne’s reign. William Sherard, born just before 
the Restoration, “the drudge of all the gardens in Europe,” 
founded at Oxford a Professorship for the study of Botany, in 
which he so excelled. And John Speed, a medical man in a 
hard-drinking generation, sustained in other fields the prowess 
of the College by a bout with Van Tromp, which left the illustrious 
Admiral of Holland, no better than “a drunkeing greazy Dutch- 
man,” to be carried away unconscious to his rooms. 
The buildings of the Bernardine College, which Sir Thomas 
White acquired, were themselves uncompleted on the East side 
of the quadrangle, where a Library and additional chambers had 
been planned. But the tower and entrance faced towards St. 
Giles’, as they do to-day. The rooms on the South and West 
sides were spacious rooms with studies attached to them. The 
Hall had a chamber over it larger than itself. The kitchen was 
worthy of a great establishment. The Chapel with its three

M, L. Lee’s Narcissus, edited from the Bodleian MS., recalls a famous

in 1602.

D.N.B, seems to be mistaken in calling him a Fellow (St. John’s, 111 sq.).

altars measured eighty feet by twenty-seven. And for a time, 
with such repairs as were needed,! these buildings apparently 
sufficed. 
Before the end of the sixteenth century, however, certain 
additions to the old buildings were made. On a strip of land 
purchased on the West front of the College, a court was enclosed 
with walls and a gateway, to give place long afterwards to an 
open terrace set with elms. It is a part of the College precincts, 
and a distinguished tutor has reminded us that undergraduates 
within it may still defy the Proctors. A Lodging for the Presi- 
dent, on the East side of the quadrangle, was built about 1597. 
A Library, with a portrait of the Founder in its East window, 
was set up about the same time, beyond the old quadrangle, 
on what was to be the South side of the new. Hutten says that 
its stones and timbers came from the ruins of Beaumont Palace: # 
The College accounts for 1583 show charges for a chamber window 
and for “making footstepps to every chamber dore,”* The 
College was poor, but improvements went on. In James I’s 
day the College grounds were surrounded with a wall. The old 
quadrangle was embattled: The kitchen was rebuilt, with 
chambers over it, by Thomas Clark, the senior cook, the College 
allowing him the rent of the chambers for twenty years.4 The 
choir was restored. An organ was set up and singing men and 
choristers provided.® A Library Keeper was appointed, and 
the Library ‘in compleat sort replenished with books.” Sir 
William Paddy’s bequests included a fine collection of medical 
works. In 1617 a College fire under a staircase near did damage, 
and Laud, as Prynne by an ingenious after-thought suggested, 
was in some danger of being burned “for his sins.” 
Laud had ceased to be President, but was still the presiding 
genius of the College, when in 1631 the beautiful new buildings 
were begun. It was his liberality which supplied the funds. The 
new quadrangle was completed. The old Library formed the

White upon the Hall, including glazing and heraldic work.

Library contained, says Wood (Colls. 552-3), the arms of benefactors,

for Scholars by the President’s Lodgings,

end of the Hall on the north side,” and that ‘‘ several other lodging rooms ” 
were added to them about 1638, Clark’s lease was surrendered in 7 years.

about 1638. But the full benefit of that endowment has not yet fallen in

Southern side.t_ The old cloister and the President’s garden were 
swept away. On the North side new chambers were built for 
well-to-do Commoners, an important feature of the College.? 
On the West other new rooms were added, and a long gallery 
which helped to make the President’s Lodgings one of the most 
dignified houses in Oxford. On the East side, where the new 
Library was to find its quarters, the taste of the builders added 
a new charm to the old traditions. The lovely garden front 
was planned on simple and familiar lines. But the fagade within 
was ornamented with elaborate skill. A colonnade so graceful 
and distinguished as to have been persistently attributed to 
Inigo Jones,? was decorated with figures representing religion 
‘and learning, the virtues and the arts. If Jackson the master- 
builder was mainly responsible for the design as well as for the 
execution of the work, he has left behind him a monument which 
few craftsmen of his day surpassed. Fine bronze statues of the 
King and Queen were added over the two gateways,‘ and a 
gilt bust of his Majesty within. The lead-work on the walls was 
worthy of the bronzes. Juxon, it is said, when hunting at 
Bletchingdon, had discovered the marble which was used for 
the pillars, The “Canterbury Quadrangle” was finished in 
1636. It cost some three thousand, two hundred pounds. The 
Fellows declared that, if their gratitude were mute, the very 
stones of the College would give forth music to their benefactor’s 
1 Wood (Colleges, 551) says that Laud prolonged the old Library 20 
ft. towards the East. 
2 Wood adds that a considerable addition was made on this side to 
the President’s Lodgings (Ib. 548). 
8 Even by Prof. Freeman (Hist. of Architecture, 436). But the work 
is unlike Jones’: (see Blomfield, Renaissance Architecture, 112): and no 
evidence has yet proved that that great artist was responsible for any 
building in Oxford. So far as one can judge from the very clear account 
of Laud’s buildings in the College archives, ‘‘ Mr. Jackson ’”” was mainly 
responsible for them, though it is not impossible that Juxon and even Laud 
may have had some say in the design. There are many letters in the 
Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, from 1631 to 1634, mentioning pay- 
ments made by Laud to Juxon and Baylie: (see index under Laud and 
Juxon) : the most interesting is Juxon’s well-known letter to Laud of 12 
March 1632. Adam Brown, the joiner, is mentioned as working both at 
St. John’s and at Lambeth (7 Dec. 1632, and 27 Sept. 1633). The College 
building accounts also speak of Brown’s visits, and mention other work- 
men engaged in carving friezes, scutcheons and “‘ Anticks,” in paving the 
cloister and in other work. 
« By Le Sueur (Cal. St. Pap. Dom. 2 May 1633 and 3 May 1634), who, 
Sir R. Blomfield suggests, might have contributed something to the build- 
ings. Busts of Laud, probably by Le Sueur also, are in the Library and 
in the President’s Lodgings (St. John’s, 129). I cannot doubt that the 
figure over the entrance, though tampered with by restorers, is St. Bernard. 
His tonsure seems to'me more apparent than the attributes which Mr. 
Vallance (Old Colleges of Oxford, 78) relies on to prove it is St. John.

glory. The King, who had sent timber from Shotover and Stow, 
lost no time in coming to see the new buildings. Abraham Wright 
broke into irrepressible verse— 
“°Tis finished then; and so, there’s not the eye 
Can blame it, that’s best skilled in symmetry : 
You’d think each stone was raised by Orpheus’ art, 
There’s such sweet harmony in every part ’— 
and wandered on in complimentary couplets for which even 
enthusiasm could hardly atone. The new Library was at first 
intended chiefly for mathematics.1 Bookshelves were fitted up 
“with shutters made before the shelves.” Laud sent an astrolabe, 
maps of the newest fashion, mathematical manuscripts in Arabic 
and Greek. But he could not resist adding two folios on the 
liberties of the Gallican Church. More valuable presents, like 
advowsons, accompanied his gifts. - Evelyn noted afterwards the 
mathematical instruments which the Archbishop had provided, 
and two skeletons “‘ fine cleansed ’’ which apparently graced the 
collection then. A great storm soon after the Restoration beat 
into the Library building, blew down three chimneys above it, 
and swept away some of the battlements on the East side. 
Nineteenth-century restorers remodelled the windows and defaced 
the roof. But the noble room where Laud feasted King Charles 
survives with all its relics and its recollections, in a beauty which 
increases as the ages pass. 
The manuscripts given by the Founder of the College, the 
spoil, no doubt, of great monastic Houses, included early classics 
and religious books. The Founder’s brother John had given 
manuscripts also, gathered probably from the same rich source. 
William Roper presented to the College his own copy of his 
illustrious father-in-law’s works. Sir William Paddy founded 
a rare collection of medical books. Davenant, the vintner, 
contributed something, and Henry Cromwell, and Gwinne and 
many other Fellows. Oriental manuscripts which Laud collected, 
prayer-books which belonged to Edward VI and James I, Wycliffe’s 
translation of the Scriptures, alleged to be in his own handwriting, 
Caxtons in profusion, Shakespeare’s Second Folio, given two years 
after its publication by an old Merchant Taylors’ boy, and the only 
perfect copy of the second edition of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales are 
possessions which any library would prize. But a more special 
character attaches to relics like Laud’s Diary, to the history of his 
trial, to the Little Gidding book, and even to the cannon-ball 
which the Puritans fired into the gateway ofa College ennobled 
by the Archbishop’s munificence and endangered by his views.?

  194 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The old Hall with its open-work roof, built about 1502 as 
the monks’ Refectory, measured only thirty feet by twenty-seven. 
But it seems to have sufficed for many years for the needs of 
the College, and it was not till the eighteenth century that it 
was substantially enlarged. The Founder’s picture hangs over 
the high table, with Laud and Juxon upon either side. John 
Case hangs near with emblems and mottoes of mortality around 
him, and Sir William Paddy, and Buckeridge and Peter Mews. 
The old Common Room close by, with its ornament and carving, 
was made in the reign of Charles IT. Its silver has since replaced 
the losses of the Great Rebellion and added splendour to the 
old toasts which it sustains. The Chapel which White took 
over was more recent than the Hall. But the Bernardines had 
built it before Robert King ceased to be an Abbot, and they 
invited him to consecrate it in 1530. Some of the ancient vest- 
ments it possesses probably came to it from Sir Thomas White.* 
Laud’s day saw many changes in it, protests against his action 
and warm defences of his views. Organ and choir, dress and 
ceremonial received attention. Parliament diverted Sir William 
Paddy’s fund for singing men to the use of the President and 
poor Scholars, since choirs had been taken away and were “ not 
likely to be set up again.” But within a few years Laud’s 
ritual was triumphant once more in his old College. The Chapel 
was paved with black and white marble. Wainscoting and a fine 
screen were introduced. Some of the windows, says Wood, were 
altered, to admit more light. The old painted glass in the East win- 
dow wasremoved. And President Baylie built on the North side 
of the main altar a beautiful little Chapel, with a roof of fine fan 
tracery, to hold the monument which he intended for himself. 
Baylie’s recumbent figure has a place of honour in his own 
building. Paddy’s elaborate memorial too is there. Laud and 
Juxon lie beneath the chancel with the Founder. Old brasses 
of John Case and other Elizabethans, moved from their original 
positions, have found a resting-place in the Ante-Chapel. Wood 
has noted the inscriptions which grew up upon the Chapel walls. 
The Grove beyond the two quadrangles, farmed in part at any 
rate in early days, was enclosed in 1612. Abraham Wright told 
King Charles on his visit that the Baptist’s sons desired to have 
a desert like their sire. But even by that time some kind of 
“power ”’ existed, and Loggan’s print forty years later shows 
more than one garden formally laid out.?- To the South of these 
2 One altar-cushion, it is thought, may have been worked for the 
Chapel by the Court ladies in the Civil War (Ib. 246-7). 
2 Dr. Ingram, writing in 1837, says that within less than a century 
from that date there were still two gardens divided by a wall (Memorials, 
St. John’s, 15).
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE LATER TUDOR COLLEGES 195 
green courts, with their walks and woodlands, the gardens of 
Trinity were taking shape. Further East rose the tree-tops of 
Wadham. To the North the open meadows stretched to the 
ruins of Godstow and the waters of its weir. It was no wonder, 
when the Civil War brought all the world to Oxford, that visitors 
expressed delight. But it was not only Cavaliers and courtiers 
who found refreshment in those lawns and groves. Their beauty 
and their calm must have descended on many a spirit since those 
troubled years, perplexed by doubts which could find no such 
decisive answer as the fierce loyalties and arbitraments of war.1 
The last College founded in Oxford under the Tudors has 
long been regarded as an appanage of the race from which they 
sprang. Yet neither in the Letters Patent granted by Elizabeth 
nor yet in the Statutes issued under James were there any of 
the usual restrictions as to the locality from which its students 
were to come.2_ Dr. Hugh Ap Rice or Price, the Founder, was 
a Welshman who, no doubt, intended his compatriots to benefit 
by his bequest. He had come up from Brecon to Oxford in 
the far-off days before the Reformation. Tradition says that 
he lodged at Oseney. He took his degree as a Doctor of Canon 
Law while Wolsey reigned supreme, and he was alleged, like 
Wolsey, to have been a butcher’s son. Nearly half a century 
later, when Treasurer of St. David’s and stricken in years, he 
secured the Queen’s permission to devote his estate to founding 
a College in the University where he had been trained. As the 
old inscription by the gateway ran, 
“Breconiae natus patriae monumenta reliquit, 
Breconiae populo signa sequenda pio.” 
  
1 An account of the College documents is given in the Fourth Report 
of the Hist. MSS. Commission (465-8). I have to thank the President, 
the Librarian and the Bursar for kindly giving me access to them, and to 
thank in particular Mr. W. H. Stevenson for all the help and information 
which he has given me on a subject which he knows like no one else. To 
several documents in the archives references have been already given. 
President Derham’s admirable calendar of them dates from the eighteenth 
century. Dr. Joseph Taylor’s little Latin history of the College, a MS. 
dating from 1666, is not of much value: and the College Registers kept 
in the President’s house, which run continuously from the earliest days, 
are full of formal documents and have comparatively little to say on 
points of general interest. On episodes like the opening of the new build- 
ings in 1636, or Charles II’s visit in 1663, or the vicissitudes of the Civil 
War and the Commonwealth, they have practically nothing to tell us. 
My debt to many printed sources I hope I have acknowledged fully: to 
Dean Hutton’s College history it is obviously great. On the buildings 
Sir R. Blomfield’s judgment is of course of great value, and Mr. Vallance 
has many interesting comments, though I do not see my way always to 
accept his views. 
2 It is possible—though there is no evidence—that the Queen or her 
advisers thought it better not to limit the scope of the College.
-P-A-G-E-238
  
  196 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Price desired and deserves the name of Founder, But in the 
Letters Patent of 27 June 1571 the Queen reserved that title for 
herself. The College was to be called in English ‘‘ Jhesus College 
wythin the Citie and Universitie of Oxforth, of Quene Elizabethe’s 
fundacion.” 1 Price was only permitted to supply an endow- 
ment, which Elizabeth regarded as no part of the Founder’s task. 
The College was to consist of a Principal, eight Fellows and eight 
Scholars. It might enjoy Price’s bequest of sixty pounds a 
year, and additional revenues up to a hundred a year if provided 
by anyone else. David Lewes, Doctor of Laws, was named as 
the first Principal. But comparatively few of the First Fellows 
and Scholars were Welsh.?, The Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor 
of the University and Price himself were empowered to draw up 
Statutes. The Charter ran generally on the old lines. The 
study of philosophy, arts, sciences and languages—Hebrew, 
Greek and Latin are named—was intended to lead up to theology. 
But the preamble recalled the Queen’s success in defending the 
faith against heresies and abuses, and dedicated the new founda- 
tion to the establishment of true religion in words which may 
justify its claim to be regarded as the first Protestant College in 
Oxford. : 
The College was founded, but there were no means at first 
to keep it up. Dr. Price’s bequest did not become available 
till after his death in 1574.4 There was no pay for the Fellows 
or Scholars, and their posts being honorary, they preferred to 
live elsewhere. Lancelot Andrewes, by far the best known of 
the earliest Scholars, with his rare power of seeing “ mysteries 
in common things,’ went to Pembroke, Cambridge, where a 
Scholarship was better worth having.’ The first Principal, 
Lewes, was an Admiralty judge, who only held his office for a 
year. And yet it seems that nearly thirty students gathered 
before long in the College buildings, and that the great majority 
of these were Welsh. Price had obtained possession of the old 
1 Statutes of Colleges (Jesus, p. 5). 
* Only the Principal, 4 or 5 Fellows and possibly 1 Scholar (see Dr. 
E. G. Hardy’s history of Jesus College, 16), But very few of the first 
nominees were in any real sense members of the College. 
® See the Letters Patent of 1571 (Stats. Jesus, p. 5). 
« And then it proved to be only £600, laid out on mortgage at Io p.c. 
The Goldsmiths secured the money on loan and left the interest for some 
time unpaid. Afterwards All Souls took it over and paid 7 p.c. (Jesus 
Coll. 20).

College lists.

White Hall near the East end of Cheyney Lane,! with other 
Halls and tenements close by, which it had probably absorbed. 
Here, in 1552, there had been apparently some twenty students,? 
most of them studying Civil Law. But it is quite possible that 
by 1571 White Hall, like its neighbours, had fallen into decay, 
and that Price was thus enabled to secure it on easy terms for 
his College. When Dr. Lewes resigned, Dr, Griffith Lloyd suc- 
ceeded, like Lewes a lawyer and an old Fellow of All Souls. Stu- 
dents came in, but for lack of endowments the Fellows stayed 
away. NoScholarscameup. No Statutes were given to the Col- 
lege. In 1586 Dr. Francis Bevans, a third lawyer with the{same 
credentials from All Souls, was nominated by the absent Fellows, 
and took possession of his quarters in the presence of the students. 
But he ‘“‘remayned for the most part at Hereford, where he 
was Chancellor,” indifferent to financial interests which could 
ill bear neglect, and in his absence Griffith Powell became the 
governing spirit of the College.¢ 
One thing, however, Bevans did. Prompted perhaps by the 
energy of Powell, he secured from the Queen the second Letters 
Patent of the 7th July 1589, which empowered the College, 
with rather cruel irony, to receive property worth two hundred 
pounds a year, and appointed twelve commissioners to make 
Statutes for it. When Bevans died, in 1602, Powell secured 
the election of John Williams of All Souls, the Lady Margaret 
Professor of Divinity, to succeed him. The surviving Fellows 
were invited to repair to the College, and to elect successors 
more disposed to take up their duties. A bequest of twenty 
pounds a year in land from Bishop Westphaling provided some 
little additional endowment. A College Register and College 
accounts began. Resident Fellows and Scholars, Welshmen all, 
at last appeared.® And though the income available was pitifully 
small, though the Commissioners failed to confirm the Statutes, 
though, in spite of Griffith Powell’s energies, Principal Williams, 
like Principal Bevans, tempted by the opportunities of absolute 
power,® deliberately left the draft of the new regulations incom- 
1 Now Market Street. This was distinguished as Great White Hall. 
* See the list given by Mr. Boase (Reg. I, xxv) from Register GG. 
ee three graduates and one or two servants, Very few names are 
eish. 
* The Matriculation entries quoted by Dr, Clark amount to 30 in 
1575 and to 46 in 1581, an exceptional year (Reg. II, ii, 62 and 101 $q.)- 
4 A MS. left by Griffith Powell, and discovered afresh by Dr, Hardy, is 
the chief authority for these early days. (See Jesus College, 22 and n.). 
5 But even then very few of them could be paid. 
* They both preferred, as Powell complained, “ absoluta et quasi 
transcendentalis potestas ’ (Jesus College, 31). It was during these 
years that the poverty of the College, no doubt, suggested to Nicholas 
Wadham the possibility of incorporating it in his new foundation.
-P-A-G-E-240
  “198 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
plete, still by 1613, when Powell succeeded to the Headship of 
the College, the darkest hours of the little community were past. 
Griffith Powell had already fought for many years for the 
existence of the College. He was appointed by the Chancellor, 
who claimed that, in view of the indifference shown by both 
Commissioners and Fellows, the appointment of a Principal had 
lapsed, as in the case of Halls, to him.t Powell was already a 
well-known figure in the University. He “ drudged much as a 
Tutor.” He was Clerk of the Market. He wrote upon Aristotle : 
“ Griffith Powell, for the honour of his nation, 
Wrote a book of Demonstration, 
But having little else to do 
He wrote a book of Elenchs too.” 
He determined to organise and establish the College, and for- 
tunately under his rule benefactions at last fell in. For several 
years Dr. Westphaling’s bequest was all the landed property 
which the College actually enjoyed. But lands in Cardiganshire 
left by Principal Lloyd became available in 1615.2. Other legacies 
came in from a Bishop of Bangor and a Dean of Armagh. And 
though the total income was small, it became possible to allot 
some better endowment to the Fellows. The Principal and the 
only Fellow in residence accordingly met and elected three more. 
The new Fellows chosen—two Scholars were chosen with them 
—lived in the College and helped in its administration. And 
Powell next devoted his energies to providing them with a 
“more decent fittinge and habitable’”’ home. Money was 
collected from the squires of Brecknockshire. All over Wales the 
clergy and gentry were invited to help. New buildings began to 
rise on the old site. New arrivals from the Principality, from 
South Wales especially, swelled the numbers of the little College.? 
1 But Lord Ellesmere’s letter in the early College Register (f. 66%) 
states that the Chancellor did not wish to prejudice the Fellows’ rights, 
if the Principalship proved to be elective. 
2 His widow had previously given money for the buildings. There 
were other bequests in the 17th century, of which Wood (Colls. 571 sq.), 
the Statutes of 1853 (Jesus, p. 81 sq.) and Mr. Hardy’s history of the 
College (Ch. V) give details. Among the more important were Principal 
Powell’s legacy of £648, bequests of £500 each from Sir Thomas Wynne 
and Stephen Rodway in 1628, £1,000 from Sir John Walter in 1630, the 
Rectory of Bedgeworth from Charles II, and valuable properties given by 
Dr. Gwynne of Anglesey, William Backhouse of Swallowfield, Dr. Mansell, 
and above all Sir Leoline Jenkins. 
8 The present Principal, Dr. E. G. Hardy, estimates in his history of 
Jesus College (40-1), to which I am repeatedly indebted, that, of some 
367 students who entered the College in its first fifty years, 73 were from 
N. Wales, 160 from S. Wales, 70 from the Border counties, and 64 from 
the rest of England. But most Welsh students still went elsewhere. Both

Men of eminence began to figure in its lists. Still the confirmation 
of the Statutes halted, for hardly any of the Commissioners now 
survived. But when Griffith Powell died in 1620, bequeathing 
characteristically all that he had to the College, the independence 
of the Society for which he had so generously laboured was 
assured. 
The Chancellor, on Powell’s death, appointed Francis Mansell 
to succeed him. Mansell, like the first four Principals, was a 
Fellow of All Souls. But the three Fellows in residence plucked 
up their courage and insisted on their right to elect. The Vice- 
Chancellor overruled their protest, secured the support of twenty 
Commoners, and carried through the appointment of Mansell,? 
who promptly deprived his opponents of their posts. But the 
new -Principal was perhaps startled by the opposition he en- 
countered. Or he may have thought that the College required 
a richer Head. Within a year a compromise was come to, in 
which both Chancellor and Fellows acquiesced. Mansell returned 
to All Souls, which had, no doubt, more comfortable pastures, 
and Sir Eubule Thelwall, a prosperous and influential lawyer, 
took his place. Thelwall, we are told, was “a most bountiful 
person, who left nothing undone which might conduce to the 
good of the College.’’ He came from North Wales, and students 
from that district followed him. He finished the Chapel and 
was buried in it. He built a new Library. He secured gifts, 
subscriptions and bequests. He gave money liberally himself. 
And he used his influence to secure from King James a further 
Charter, which at last settled the Statutes of the College. Under 
the new Letters Patent of 1621 the College was enlarged. It 
was to include in future sixteen Fellows and sixteen Scholars. 
It was allowed to receive endowments up to six hundred pounds 
a year. New Fellows and Scholars were nominated, and provi- 
sion made for subsequent elections. New Commissioners were 
appointed to make rules. And at last a set of Statutes, embody- 
ing, no doubt, those which Griffith Powell had drafted on the 
Brasenose model years before, was adopted, inscribed and 
delivered to the Fellows.* 
Protestant the new College might be, but the Statutes, which 
were comparatively simple, ran upon the old familiar lines. The 
Hart Hall and Christ Church in those years received more students from 
N. Wales than Jesus; Oriel, Brasenose and Edmund Hall received not 
many less, 
1 This Chancellor, Lord Pembroke, was also Visitor of the College.

Register by Dr. Clark (Reg. II, i, 291-3).

Vol. III). The original on vellum, signed by Pembroke, Thelwall and 
two other Commissioners, but not dated, is in the College Archives.

200 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Principal was to be a theologian or civilian, “ or at least a Master 
in Arts,” unmarried and over thirty years of age.1 He was to 
be elected by a majority of the Fellows, and to be preferably 
a present or past Fellow himself. He was to consult his colleagues 
on important business. He had a Vice-Principal to help him 
in his task. Fellows must be over seventeen years old and under 
twenty-six, Scholars over twelve and under twenty-four. In the 
election of Fellows a preference was given to Scholars of the 
College, particularly to those who had taken degrees. But they 
were to be on probation for a year. Benefices over ten pounds 
a year in value, marriage, misconduct, idleness, desertion, 
taking Orders in any but the English Church, were all to be 
causes of forfeiture. As regards nationality no conditions were 
laid down. Indeed it was expressly stated that that was not 
to count.2- On the other hand, an important proviso required 
every Fellow or Scholar elected to a place endowed by any special 
benefaction to comply with the conditions of the gift; and as 
most of the endowments flowed in from Welsh sources and were 
expressly given for Welshmen, this provision largely determined 
the nationality of the College. A Bursar, to look after questions 
of revenue, a Censor of Philosophy, to lecture at seven in the 
morning thrice a week, a Praelector of dialectic, who started 
lecturing at six, a Seneschal of Hall, chosen weekly from the 
Fellows, a manciple, a butler, a cook, a porter-barber—doubling 
the duties as he so often did—helped to make up the College 
Staff. Servants were still to be “celibate and unmarried.” 
Laundresses were still peculiarly suspect. Even in a Protestant 
College the traditions of Catholic clerks remained. 
Education was carefully provided for. Frequent disputa- 
tions were arranged. All members of the College, except servants, 
must attend the disputations in theology, and store the lessons 
of religion in their minds. Degrees must be taken within the 
usual time. All Masters of Arts must go on to theology after 
completing their necessary regency, and must take Orders within 
six years of their Master’s Degree. Religious exercises were 
regarded. Provisions for daily prayers in Chapel, for attending 
University sermons, for grace and bible-reading in Hall, and for 
1 The title of Principal was, no doubt, due to the fact that the College 
grew out of, and was at first almost indistinguishable from, a Hall. Brase- 
nose also, with its Principal, grew out of an ancient Hall.

place of the older regulations. Every Bachelor and under- 
graduate Scholar—it was unnecessary to make such rules for 
others—should not fail, on rising in the morning, to kneel and 
say ‘Our Father which art in Heaven.” He should pray to 
God, who strewed the heavens with the splendour of the stars, 
to illuminate his heart at night.? 
Few of the Fellows or Scholars of Jesus had endowments to 
rely on when the Statutes were first framed. Their allowances 
were fixed at rates which only the most careless optimist could 
have expected the College revenues to pay. The Principal was 
given, on paper, forty pounds yearly for food, pay and clothes, 
each Fellow ‘“‘ who was not honorary ” twenty pounds, and each 
Scholar ten. These figures included commons valued at five 
shillings a week for the Principal, at three shillings and four- 
pence for Fellows, and at two shillings for Scholars. But the 
latter were entitled, beyond this, to any special emoluments 
attached by benefactors to the places which they held. Further 
stipends, moreover, were to be paid for special work. The 
Vice-President, as such, drew forty shillings yearly, the Bursar 
and the Censor of Philosophy the same. Commoners had to 
pay for their food either weekly or at the end of term. If they 
sat at the Principal’s table, they had to pay on the same scale 
as he. Commoners—the English word is used—might be 
admitted “ according to the capacity of the rooms.” They were 
expected to contribute to the buildings, and to have a tutor in the 
College. Poor Scholars ‘‘ commonly called battelars ”’ were also 
allowed. The usual rules for discipline were added, for decent 
dress and decent language, for conversation in Latin, Greek or 
Hebrew: one wonders how often students availed themselves of 
the permission to talk Hebrew or Greek. Leave in term was 
limited to a month for the Principal and a fortnight for the 
Fellows. Dogs and birds and dice and cards, and noisiness and 
weapons of war were illegitimate. Strangers. must not pass a 
night in College ; they must not be brought in to interfere with 
studies at all. Fines were levied for misdemeanours, and other 
more serious punishments were threatened. But the venerable 
and credulous custom of purgation for suspected persons was 
maintained. A Fellow could rehabilitate himself by swearing 
to his own innocence upon the Gospels and by inducing two

of his colleagues to swear to their belief in him. Even a Protes- 
tant College was in no haste to free itself from the generous 
superstitions of the past. 
In spite of the freedom from restrictions in the Statutes, 
the nationality of the College was not long in dispute. Welsh- 
men soon came to regard it as their own. Welsh Principals and 
Fellows elected their own compatriots. Welsh benefactors ear- 
marked their donations for their own countrymen and kin. 
And before the middle of the seventeenth century one of the 
most distinguished of its rulers identified it more closely than 
ever with the interests and the loyalty of Wales. Francis 
Mansell, born in the year of the Armada, had matriculated at 
Jesus in 1607, had been appointed Principal in 1620, and had 
soon afterwards returned to his Fellowship at All Souls. In 
1630, however, on Thelwall’s death, he was re-elected, and he 
found the College far more prosperous than it had been ten years 
before. The revenues indeed would not yet permit of main- 
taining sixteen fully-paid Fellowships. But there were some 
ten or twelve Fellows in residence, and Commoners who numbered 
about fifty before the Civil War. Mansell was a man of influence 
and connections, well known and liked in Wales. He set to 
work vigorously to secure subscriptions, to improve the buildings, 
and to complete the endowment of the College.1| Thenceforth 
the financial statements show an income steadily rising. In 
1641 there was a surplus of a hundred pounds.? It is not till 
the end of 1642 that pecuniary troubles begin, that we hear 
of the Bursar “and most of the Societie”’ leaving, and of the 
difficulty of ‘‘ evening” the accounts. 
But the Civil War overtook Mansell in the middle of his 
labours. He found himself detained in Wales and unable to 
get back, while Lord Saye’s and the King’s troops in turn were 
occupying Oxford, and Fellows and students were dispersing, 
many of them to join the forces of the King. The College plate 
went to the Royal Mint. The College accounts began to speak 
of “‘ Beere to the Kinges Souldiers,” of Musquets and Pikes for 
“the Prince his Trumpetters,”’ of payments for work on the 
fortifications and for Foot soldiers in the Royal army. The

printed in 1854, from the MS. then in the Ashmolean. I have to thank 
the College Librarian for a copy. The Life of Jenkins by William Wynne, 
with a large collection of diplomatic correspondence, was published in 
1724.

substantially since 1631. In 1643 the receipts fall to £95, and the dis- 
bursements amount to £341. See the bound volume of accounts from 
1631 onwards in the College archives. It is for the most part beautifully 
kept.

THE LATER TUDOR COLLEGES 203 
College tenants began to withhold their rents. The best College 
rooms were occupied by “ soldiers, courtiers and others.” The 
Fellows who remained had to take their meals in the Buttery 
instead of the Hall. Royalist officers, Sir Edward Stradling 
and Lord Grandison, died in the College. Lady Grandison 
ran up bills in the Buttery, and left them apparently unpaid. 
Mansell got back to Oxford at the end of 1642, but was called 
to Wales again by his brother’s death. He remained in Glamor- 
ganshire, working in the King’s interests, for the remainder of 
the war, till the Parliamentary Visitation of the University 
made it essential for him to return. The sympathies of Jesus 
men were strongly on the Royal side. But during the War 
the College had few annals, and its Register, which fell into the 
hands of the Visitors, was not returned. 
Mansell of course would hear nothing of submission. He was 
removed in 1648, though Pembroke, the Chancellor, was his 
kinsman and Pembroke’s younger sons old pupils of his own. 
He would not “‘ frame himself to any the least evasion,” but it 
was said that the Visitors regretted his loss. Most of the Fellows 
followed his example. Their answers to the Visitors were refresh- 
ingly downright. John Hughes would neither acknowledge 
nor submit to the Parliament, were it to save his life. Phillipp 
Flower dared not condemn himself to receive a portion with 
hypocrites in yielding up his conscience. Thomas Ellis could 
not submit ‘without the hazard of shipwrackinge’’ his soul. 
Only one or two of the Fellows complied.? All the rest apparently 
faced the risk of deprivation. Of a list of twenty-three members 
of the College, which remains to us, it has been estimated that 
ten were certainly expelled and that some ten others may or 
may not have met with the same fate. But some of these per- 
haps submitted later, and in any case enough members of the 
College stayed on to make it for years a centre of opposition to 
those in power. The Provost Marshal “ of this garrison of Oxon ” 
had to be called in to enable the new Fellows to get possession 
of their chambers.4 Dr. Michael Roberts was appointed Prin-

Fellow and one Schollar that was not outed.”

were neither Fellows nor Scholars. For the new-comers introduced by 
the Parliament see Burrows (Ib. 177 and 504-5). But we cannot be 
quite sure of the facts. The Visitors’ Register has many references to the 
affairs of the College.

cipal, no very happy choice; there were some grounds for sus- 
pecting him of corruption.! Sharp dissensions in the College 
followed. An appeal went up to Cromwell. The Fellows sum- 
marily removed Dr. Roberts, and though the Visitors declined 
in 1656 to confirm their action, Roberts was next year induced 
to resign. He lived on in Oxford, grumbling apparently and 
hoarding money, until 1679. He died, said rumour, with a 
girdle of gold pieces round him, and was buried in St. Peter’s 
Churchyard. 
Mansell had handed over his accounts in perfect order. But 
they showed that since 1644 the College had received less than 
half of its regular income. In 1651 the Visitors empowered it 
to cut down the number of Fellows and Scholars. Mansell 
also drew up an inventory of the College goods and an interesting 
catalogue of the books which the Library contained? After 
that he retired to Wales, where young men of quality gathered 
round him, to be taught by Leoline Jenkins, on lines, no doubt, 
which Mansell approved. But even in Wales the Doctor’s grave 
and pious aspect, ‘‘ which should have been a protection to him 
among Salvages,” did not save him from molestation. The 
little tutoring establishment, ‘a Seminary,” some thought, 
“of Rebellion and Sedition,’ was broken up. It removed 
with Jenkins in 1651 to Mr. White’s Town House in Oxford, 
and soon afterwards Mansell returned there also. He was 
allowed to take up his quarters in his old College,’ where he lived 
in studious retirement for eight years. “ His exercise within 
doores was Prayer, without doores Charity.” He joined in the 
Episcopal services at the house of Dr. Willis. He kept his eye 
on the young Scholars at Mr. White’s.4 But his presence in 
College could hardly have helped to make things easier for his 
successor. Jesus may claim the credit or discredit of remaining 
a centre of disaffection until the King came home. 
On Roberts’ resignation in 1657 the College was well filled, in 
spite of its troubles. It included fifty-three Commoners, nearly 
all Welsh. The Fellows, it seems, wished to elect Dr. Seth Ward 
as Principal. But the Protector appointed Francis Howell, 
one of the Parliamentary Visitors, and a well-known Independent. 
As Roberts continued for a time to live in College, the new

Principal had the curious experience of acting as host to two 
predecessors. But the general feeling in 1660 insisted on Man- 
sell’s re-appointment. He was made Principal for the third 
time, and he produced a happy “expedient ”’ for settling the 
College. Some of the former Fellows were restored. Some of 
the new ones were retained. And seven other persons were 
nominated to Fellowships, of whom the most conspicuous was 
Leoline Jenkins, Mansell’s biographer and friend. But Mansell 
was now an old man. His sight was failing. He had twice 
refused a Bishopric. After seven months of office he determined 
to transfer the government of “‘ his beloved College ’”’ to younger 
hands. In 1661 Leoline Jenkins was unanimously elected Prin- 
cipal, ‘“ with the good liking of our Common-Father.’”’ Mansell, 
who lived for four years longer, left an important legacy at his 
death, and Jenkins, who has been called the second Founder 
of the College, devoted no small part of his influence and fortune 
to carrying on his master’s work. 
Sir Leoline Jenkins became a successful lawyer, a useful diplo- 
matist and a Secretary of State—‘‘the most faithful Drudge 
of a Secretary,” said Roger North, “ that ever the Court had.” ? 
From boyhood he had been marked by such a settled gravity 
of purpose that nobody could ever think him young. Through 
life, it may be added, Burnet found him “ dull and slow.” But 
others formed a kinder judgment. Jenkins had taken up arms 
for the King. He had won credit as a zealous Royalist. He 
had studied law successfully abroad and had become “a sort 
of oracle’ on legal subjects. After the Restoration legal and 
political preferment came quickly. In 1673 he had to give up 
his post at Jesus for larger work outside. But the years of 
his Headship were prosperous years. He proved “ indefatigable, 
temperate and vertuous. God blesse him.’’ Order, discipline, 
disputations were restored. The first minute in the Register 
after his election re-established daily prayers according to the 
ritual of the Church of England. The finances were improved : 
they needed improvement. In 1667 only a hundred and eighty- 
three pounds were available for Principal, Fellows and Scholars. 
In 1686 arrears of sixteen hundred pounds were still due to the 
College. But new members came up and new benefactions fell 
in. In 1669 there were eighty-eight members batteling in Col- 
lege, apart from those on the foundation. They were almost 
exclusively Welsh, but they included some distinguished men. 
Jenkins continued to show a warm interest in the College even 
after he ceased to be its Principal. He contributed liberally 
to its buildings. He bequeathed his whole property to it on his 
1 Life of Lord Keeper Guilford (229). Wood (Life, III, 162-3) and 
Aubrey (Brief Lives, Il, 7-9) have notes of interest upon Jenkins,

death. Lands in Glamorganshire, Northamptonshire and other 
counties, and a few fortunate acres in Lambeth, gave Jesus 
new revenues of seven hundred pounds.?. The Principal’s allow- 
ance was increased by fifty pounds. The sixteen Fellows and 
sixteen Scholars at last received the pay intended for them. 
Seven Fellowships and seven Scholarships were definitely allotted 
to North Wales, and the same number to South Wales.? It 
was now impossible to pretend that the College was anything 
but Welsh. Two additional Welsh Fellowships were designed, 
when funds permitted, to furnish Chaplains for the Plantations 
and the fleet. And Cowbridge School, long supported by the 
family of Stradling, but purchased and endowed by Sir Leoline 
Jenkins, became with its Pensioners and its Exhibitions a part 
of the charge entrusted to the College. 
Jenkins’ successor, Dr. John Lloyd, is described by Wood 
as a “‘ bibing fellow, of little business, pedanticall, of little or no 
behaviour.” But once as Vice-Chancellor, in 1683, he led a 
body of armed men from Jesus after midnight to deliver a Pro- 
Proctor whom the town mob had imprisoned in the Castle. He 
received a visit from the Duke of York. He took part in the 
great funeral given to Jenkins in the College Chapel. And he 
passed on to higher things. In 1686, when Lloyd was promoted 
to a Bishopric, Jonathan Edwards, best known asa controversial- 
ist, succeeded. He was “the greatest champion” of his time 
against Socinianism. His last days were devoted to discussions 
of Original Sin. His integrity has been questioned by those 
who disliked his theological opinions. But he did something 
for the buildings of his College, and left it a handsome bequest 
at his death. 
Mansell and Jenkins stand out in the history of the College, 
but Jesus can claim not a few distinguished men. Of its Bishops, 
Andrewes was dimly connected with the foundation. Morgan 
Owen, who was impeached for protesting against the acts of the 
Long Parliament, gave the famous South Porch to St. Mary’s 
Church. Thomas Howell, a contemporary of Mansell, became 
Bishop of Bristol in 1644, and had his Palace pillaged when the 
Parliament’s troops retook the city. William Lloyd of St. 
1 Worth then £85 a year. To-day they bring in over £3,000, though 
nearly half the property has been sold. For the details of Jenkins’ endow- 
ment, and of the valuable Meyricke bequest early in the 18th century, see 
Hardy (Jesus Coll. 84—7 and 151-62). 
2 By 1687 the older revenues were a little over the £600 allowed by 
James’ Charter. 17 Fellowships and 22 Scholarships had been nominally 
founded. But the money to pay them all had not been found. After 
Jenkins’ death the College cut the number down to 16 of each and pro- 
vided funds for them all (Ib. 84-7). 8 Ib. (154-5).

Asaph, and of other Sees later, who figures as ‘‘ Episcopus 
Lloyd” in the Buttery Books, was one of the Seven Bishops 
of 1688, and is said to have induced Burnet to undertake his his- 
tory of the Reformation. Many lawyers and men of letters 
are in the College lists. Robert Johnson, one of the original 
Fellows, founded the Schools of Uppingham and Oakham. David 
Powell, probably the first Jesus man to take a degree, may claim 
to be the first historian of Wales in modern times. But Powell 
was only the earliest of several members of the College who 
devoted themselves to the antiquities and literature of their 
country. John Davies produced a Welsh grammar in Latin, and 
a great Welsh Dictionary in 1632. Rees Pritchard, who entered 
Jesus in 1597, was famed as poet and preacher, a Royalist in 
politics but a Puritan at heart. ‘‘ Perceiving the people 
to be ignorant, and also much addicted to singing, he turned 
the substance of his sermons into verse.” James Howell, 
whose “‘ Familiar Letters ’’ contain interesting notices of Jesus 
and of Oxford, was elected a Fellow in 1623.2 Sir James Perrot, 
with his strange, reputed ancestry, was not only an author 
but a Welsh member who showed independence in the days of 
James I. A later politician, Sir William Williams, once famed 
for his independence in the House of Commons, became a Law 
Officer to James II, and shared with Jeffreys the hatred of the 
people. He pleaded for indulgence when he reverted to the 
Whigs : ‘‘ we have all done amiss and must wink at one another.”’ 4 
Sir William Vaughan of Golden Grove, author of many writings, 
found time to take a share in colonising Newfoundland. There 
were many Vaughans at Jesus as the years went by. Henry, 
styled the Silurist—‘‘ you know Silures contayned Breconock- 
shire, Herefordshire, etc.”—followed the “pleasant paths of 
poetry and philology,” and became no unworthy rival of George 
Herbert, while his twin brother Thomas, ‘‘ Eugenius Philalethes,” 
won some celebrity as a natural philosopher. Thomas Vaughan 
indeed forsook the philosophy of Aristotle, as no better than an 
apothecary’s drug, and for a time went after the false gods 
of alchemy instead. But it was an experiment, it seems, with

in D.N.B. Mr. Hardy does not, I think, mention Williams. Dr. Andrew 
Clark’s notes on the College Buttery Books, six MS. volumes running from 
1637 to 1799, in the possession of the College, give many valuable details 
about Jesus men.

mercury and not with magic which at length put an end to his 
adventurous career. 
Politics and religion could hardly fail to overshadow the work 
of students in that troubled age. Sir Thomas Salesbury, ‘‘a most 
noted poet,” who wrote in verse a history of Joseph, was even 
more conspicuous as a Cavalier. John Ellis, the author of Clavis 
Fidei, is said by Wood to have “ sided with all parties and taken 
all oathes.” John Littleton, Vice-Principal in 1633, was after- 
wards Master of the Temple. But he joined the King’s army 
and the Parliament turned him out. Theodore Price, a strong 
supporter of Laud, seemed to Prynne merely “an unpreaching 
epicurean.” Ussher, the well-loved Archbishop of Armagh, 
“learned to a miracle,” but with too gentle a soul for the rough 
problems of his day, stayed at Jesus more than once.? In the 
same age Vavasour Powell, a fearless Independent, or as Wood 
says, ‘a grand schismatic,” found it equally difficult to accept 
the formulas of Presbyter and Churchman, the usurpation of 
Cromwell and the ideals of the Restoration. One would like to 
think of him visiting Oxford with Bunyan in 1657. It is more 
certain that he died in prison, preaching with irrepressible 
vigour to the last. Among other scholars and divines Edward 
Lhuyd, who in 1690 was appointed Keeper of the Ashmolean 
Museum, won so great a reputation that Sir Isaac Newton con- 
tributed to the cost of publishing his work. And in a very 
different field of celebrity, ‘“‘ Beau” Nash, whose singular 
triumphs at Bath were to make etiquette for a later generation, 
may be noted, dressed perhaps already “to the very edge of 
his finances,” as an undergraduate at Jesus in 1692. 
White Hall, or Great White Hall, the nucleus of the College 
buildings, was ‘“‘a large tenement with a great stone gate,” 
which had apparently existed in the days of Simon de Montfort. 
It was the last survivor of a group of hostels which once stood 
in the space between Ship Street and Market Street, South of 
the town wall. In this Hall the members of Price’s foundation

Handley in 1842. 
* His name appears in the Buttery Books in 1640 and again in 1652. 
But for several years the books are missing, and Ussher may have stayed 
at Jesus often. The evidence is summed up by Dr. Hardy (Jesus, 99-101). 
* Mr. Boase accepts this tradition (Oxford, 140) and Mr. Thomas 
quotes it (Colls. of Oxf. 376)—for what it may be worth. Wood’s lively 
but prejudiced sketch of Powell in the Athene (ed. Bliss, III, 911 sq.) 
should be checked by the Life and Death of Mr. Vavasor Powell, 1671, and 
by other authorities quoted in D.N.B. 
« For these old Halls, which fronted, some on Cheyney Lane (Market 
Street) and some on Somnore Lane (Ship Street), see Wood (City, I, passim),

were frequented, it seems, by law students, not specially by Welshmen.

  THE LATER TUDOR COLLEGES 209 
had their earliest home. But the Founder at once began to 
raise beside it and behind it more ambitious buildings fronting 
on the Turl: 
“ Struxit Hugo Pricius tibi clara Palatia, Jesu, 
Vt doctor legum pectora docta daret ” !: 
and with this block, the original East front of the College, the 
Fellows had for a time to be content. But when Griffith Powell 
became Principal in 1613, a vigorous effort was made to improve 
the buildings. Money was collected. White Hall was pulled 
down. On Cheyney Lane the South side of a new quadrangle 
rose. On the West a Kitchen and Buttery were built, with a 
chamber over them, and a Dining Hall with three long windows 
facing East, and with panelling for which the Lord Chancellor’s 
Secretary paid. Beyond the Gateway on the Turl, in the North- 
East corner, anew Chapel was begun.? When Griffith Powell died, 
in 1620, the outline of the original quadrangle, except for the space 
now covered by the Principal’s Lodgings, was virtually complete.* 
Thelwall, Mansell and Jenkins deserve to rank with Price and 
Griffith Powell among the principal builders of the College. 
Thelwall not only finished what Powell had begun. He built 
at his own cost the Principal’s Lodgings on the North side, 
joining the Chapel with the Hall, and he fitted up a dining-room 
“with wainscot curiously graven”? worthy of a Principal of 
standing and estate. Further West, beyond the Hall, Sir Eubule 
laid the foundations of a new quadrangle by building a Library 
with chambers over it and a colonnade beneath, for which he 
secured contributions both of money and of books. James 
Howell wrote from Rome to ask “ with what rate Jesus College 
new walls go up.” And there is no doubt that Thelwall earned 
the praises which his memorialin the Chapel gives. But.Mansell, 
his biographer tells us, enlarged the College ‘‘ beyond all hopes.”’ 
“For though our Principall had no fonds, but that of his owne 
Zeale, for such an undertaking ; he began the Seconde Quadrangle, 
and pulling downe a ruinous Library that joyned the upper end of 
the Hall, he built the North and South Pieces as the first halfe of the 
two squares of this new Quadrangle by the Contribution of his Friends 
and his owne money.’ ¢ 
  
White Hall, Mr. Hardy thinks, stood where Staircases IV and V in the old 
quadrangle stand to-day. But there were other White Halls close by. 
1 Fitzherbert says that Price put up this distich over the gateway in 
the Turl (Eliz. Oxford., 15). The new block ran round the corner into 
Cheyney Lane. See also Agas’ Map. 
2 But it did not at first extend quite as far East as Turl Street. 
* The buildings were not finished till after Powell’s death. The Chapel 
was consecrated on the 28th May 1621 (Jesus, 39).

  2io A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The outbreak of War prevented some promises of assistance 
from being fulfilled. But a generous list of subscriptions from 
the Welsh clergy remains. The Chapel was improved. A new 
and charming doorway was inserted, with theinscription over it 
“ Ascendat Oratio descendat Gratia.’’ The East front with a 
“fayre east window” was extended to the Turl. Thelwall’s 
Library, curiously described as “ruinous,” was pulled down. 
Two sides of the second quadrangle were laid out.) A new 
Library had been promised, to form the West side, and Dr. 
Oliver Lloyd’s Law Library had been inherited by the College, 
when the outbreak of the Civil War scattered all schemes of 
improvement to the winds. Yet even in the hour of his expul- 
sion Mansell completed his full Catalogue of College books. 
Five hundred works, including the Price manuscripts, which had 
belonged to the Library of old, nine hundred works lately given 
by Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and four hundred and fifty works 
given by Mansell himself,? all had to find a temporary home 
in rooms above the Buttery and Kitchen.? Jenkins, while Prin- 
cipal, had perhaps enough to do in restoring the finances of the 
College. But after his resignation he took up Mansell’s plans. 
The South side of the new quadrangle was finished, and a Library 
built along part of the West side, at Sir Leoline’s own expense. 
The books were transferred to it in 1679. Before that time a small 
but orderly garden had been laid out to the North of the old 
quadrangle. But the North-West corner of the new quadrangle 
was for some while still unoccupied, till new buildings rose to 
fill it in the last years of Queen Anne.‘ 
Change and restoration have inevitably left their mark on the 
appearance of the College. The gables which Loggan shows 
in the old quadrangle have vanished: a third storey has taken 
their place. The Hall has got new battlements. Dr. Price’s 
old building on the Turl has been refaced. A tower has grown 
up over a new Gateway. But the inner quadrangle has been 
altered comparatively little since Mansell and Jenkins laid it 
out. The Hall which Powell built has now a plaster ceiling with 
attics over it, hiding the old open roof. The blazons which 
once glowed in the windows, and the Minstrels’ Gallery, which 
tradition places at the South end, have disappeared.5 But 
1 It is not quite clear how far Mansell finished these two sides, North 
and South.

portraits of Dr. Price and of Queen Elizabeth hang over the 
high table. The “ virgo invictissima semper Augusta’ appears 
more than once upon the College walls. Jenkins is close by. 
So is Charles I, a noble Vandyck, and Charles II by Lely—both 
pictures once in Jenkins’ possession—and Thelwall as a boy, 
and Andrewes as a Bishop, and other Jesus dignitaries known to 
fame. Mansell’s portrait is in the Principal’s Lodgings, where 
Thelwall also reappears. The Chapel has undergone more 
improvements. To widen the arch of the chancel, the tombs 
of Thelwall and of Mansell have been moved. The wainscoting 
and woodwork, in which the College must once have been excep- 
tionally rich, have here been swept away. But the beautiful Jaco- 
bean screen still guards the entrance from the Ante-Chapel. The 
fine old pulpit, the steps of black and white marble and the fair 
East window, now filled with modern glass, remain. And of 
the monuments Thelwall’s yields to none in dignity, while the 
inscription upon Jenkins yields to few in length. 
Jenkins’ Library is overcrowded now with volumes, Its 
possessions include manuscripts going back to the eleventh 
century, given in early days by Sir John Prise of Portham, and 
noted in the earliest Register of the College. They include, as 
in duty bound, many interesting manuscripts from Wales, among 
which the famous Red Book of Hergest, with its tales of Arthur 
and of Merlin, takes the highest place.1_ They include also Welsh 
Bibles, theologians and Fathers, a fine Thomas Aquinas of 1512, a 
rich store of pamphlets and of works on Canon Law. They include 
the “ Brute Chronicles ” of England with their medieval legends 
and the original draft of Lord Herbert of Cherbury’s History 
of Henry VIII, which may be more reliable as history, and which 
came, no doubt, to the Library with Lord Herbert’s great bequest. 
And they include works as curious or important as the ‘‘ Arms 
and Pedigrees of 216 Baronets of England (male and female) 
for three descents.” The long, light room, with its old, carved 
cases and desks at right angles to the wall, with its great South 
window looking over Market Street, and its fine sense of tran- 
quillity and space, holds an honourable rank among the many 
noble libraries in which Oxford keeps its treasuries of books.? 
1 This is probably a 15th-century MS., but it was not presented to 
the College till 17or, (See Dr. Hardy’s Note on the Library, Jesus Coll. 
224-8). The College MSS. are now deposited in the Bodleian. 
3 I have already referred to the chief authorities for the College his- 
tory. The Principal’s book describes (221-2) the documents in the Muni- 
ment Room, and I have to thank him and the Bursar, Dr, Hazell, for their 
kindness in allowing me to consult them and in answering questions on the 
subject. The Bursars’ Computi run from 1630 or 1631, but between 1648 
and 1660 they are missing. The Buttery Books, complete for many years 
after the Restoration, are more fragmentary before that, but Dr. Andrew

Clark’s notes on them run from 1637. The early Register (Liber Collegit 
Jesu) has some points of interest, more perhaps than the Registers after 
the Restoration. It runs from 1602 to about 1633; but its successor, 
which might have been made very interesting, was taken away for the 
Parliamentary Visitors and was apparently not returned. There are 
important lists of benefactors, a Benefactors’ Book labelled 1626, Account 
Books of Jenkins’ Endowment, and notably the interesting volume of 
College accounts from 1631 to about 1650. The original Statutes and other 
records of special value, like Powell’s early account of the College and 
Mansell’s Catalogue and inventory, are kept with the foundation documents 
in an iron-bound chest.

  CHAPTER XV 
JACOBEAN OXFORD: 
THE BODLEIAN AND THE SCHOOLS 
O Elizabethan found a happier way of linking his name 
with the immortality of Oxford than the “ thrice 
worthy Thomas Bodley,” whose offer to restore the 
ancient Library was welcomed by Convocation in 1598. 
“Where there hath bin heretofore a publike Library in Oxford, 
which you know is apparent by the rome itself remayning and by 
your Statute Records, I will take the charge and cost upon me to 
reduce it againe to his former use, and to make it fit and handsome 
with seates and shelves and deskes and all that may be needfull, to 
stirre up other mens benevolence to help to furnish it with bookes. 
And this I purpose to begin, assoone as timber can be gotten, to 
the intent that you may reape some speedie profitt of my project.” 
Cobham’s Library and Duke Humphrey’s Library had both 
passed away. The fifteenth-century building had been plundered 
by iconoclasts or knaves. Bodley had entered Magdalen College 
within a few years of the shameful transaction which empowered 
the University officials to sell off such of its fittings as remained.? 
His family had taken refuge abroad during the reign of Queen 
Mary. At Geneva he had been nurtured from the age of twelve 
in scholarship and in theology. At Oxford under Laurence 
Humfrey this teaching had been continued, and the love of 
books implanted in him by his father, a well-known printer of 
the Bible, had grown into a genuine love of knowledge. Bodley 
was elected in 1563 a Probationer-Fellow of Merton, and began to 
give Greek lectures in the College Hall. In 1566 he was lecturing 
on Natural Philosophy. In 1569 he was serving as Proctor. 
He became a great student of Hebrew. He obtained leave 
to travel and to study languages abroad. He was drawn into 
1 See Bodley’s letter as given by Wood (Annals, II, 266). Bodley’s 
spelling is more exactly reproduced in Tvecentale Bodleianum (23-6). 
But the differences are very small. 
2 It seems that, after the dispersal of the books in the days of Edward 
VI, the Library building was used for medical students. Wood speaks 
tather vaguely of ‘‘ infamous uses.” (See Bodleian Quarterly Record, III, 
148).

diplomacy, sent on embassies to German Princes, allowed to 
carry encouragement to Henry of Navarre. He spent years in 
a difficult mission to the Netherlands. If it be true that Queen 
Elizabeth one day expressed a wish that he were hanged, that 
would not necessarily reflect on her Ambassador’s integrity. 
Burghley and Essex both appreciated his political abilities, his 
grace and charm. But Bodley escaped at last from the entangle- 
ments of politics. His public service was to take a more enduring 
form. He resolved to set up his staff ‘‘ at the Librarie dore in 
Oxon.” He would fain “‘ stay the wreck, drive the waste away, 
rescue from destruction the great buildings of old founders as 
lovingly as they had been raised of old, and bring back to the 
Muses whom the savagery of the past had driven into banish- 
ment, the flow of life and blood and their ancient birthright 
of a home.” ? 
Two years were spent in repairing and in fitting up Duke 
Humphrey’s reading-room again. The building cost Bodley 
more than he had expected, “ because the timber-works of 
the house were rotten and had to be new made.’’?_ The beautiful 
roof which we know was installed, with the arms of the University 
painted in its compartments, the Bible, the seven seals, the 
three crowns and the familiar motto,? and with Bodley’s own 
arms on the bosses between. From the first Bodley began to 
gather in books and to provide a Register for those who gave 
them. The Register, two noble folios on vellum, with some 
entries in the fine handwriting of a young graduate of Corpus, 
the “ ever-memorable ’’ John Hales, was placed in a conspicuous 
position in the Library. Essex, Buckhurst, Hunsdon and other 
1 These words—quoted by Mr. Gibson (Some Oxford Libraries, 22), 
to whose work, as to Mr. Madan’s recent treatise on The Bodleian Library 
(1919) I owe many useful hints—are in John Hales’ funeral oration in 
Merton Chapel, March 29, 1613, as translated by Canon Skrine for the 
Tercentenary service in 1913 and reprinted by the Oxford Times. Bod- 
ley’s brief autobiography, written in 1609, was printed by Hearne in 1703 
in Reliquie Bodleiane, with many of his letters to Thomas James. It was 
reprinted by Mr. Lane in 1894, and in Trecentale Bodleianum (1913).

and D.N.B.

* “Dominus illuminatio mea.” But the University in those days 
had other mottoes. ‘‘ Bonitas regnabit, Veritas liberabit,’’ was one. 
‘‘In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum,’’ was another. 
(See Macray’s note, Annals, 17-18). The University arms, Mr. Madan 
tells me, are found on a mace of 1429. There may be some fifteenth- 
century work in the roof of the Library still.

nobles were among the early contributors. Bodley had a “ great 
store of honorable friends.” He himself gave many volumes 
collected in Italy by a London bookseller whom he employed, 
and among others probably the beautifully illuminated manu- 
script of the Romance of Alexander, which does not appear in the 
Register of donations.? Bishop Westphaling of Hereford gave 
twenty pounds to purchase books. Contributions came in from 
Dean Nowell, from President Bond of Magdalen, from Thomas 
Allen of Gloucester Hall. Allen had secured some of the Grey 
Friars’ spoils. Thomas James of New College, the first Librarian, 
a scholar and book-lover who had edited the Philobiblon, gave a 
supply of manuscripts, for which, Wood unkindly suggested, he 
had rummaged to some purpose among College shelves. Merton 
offered thirty-eight volumes. The Dean and Chapter of Exeter 
presented manuscripts belonging to their Cathedral, including 
a precious Missal given them in the days of Edward the Confessor. 
The Dean and Chapter of Windsor followed this doubtful example 
later. Tobie Matthew, Lord Mountjoy, Lord Cobham, many 
others, gave books or money. Before the end of 1602 Bodley 
had collected over two thousand volumes. On the 8th November 
in that year the restored and replenished Library was opened. 
Poets were already singing its praises. In the year of Eliza- 
beth’s death the most brilliant of her courtiers added his gift 
to a foundation which prolonged the greatest traditions of her 
reign. 
Under the new Sovereign the Oxford Library found equal 
favour. Bodley had succeeded in making it the fashion, and the 
stream of donations flowed on. Great peers like Northumber- 
land, Nottingham and Pembroke, Veres and Cecils, Nevilles, 
Spencers, Grosvenors, book-lovers like Sir Robert Cotton and 
Sir Henry Wotton, nobles and churchmen, lawyers and mer- 
chants, helped to enrich it as its fame increased. In 1604 Bodley 
was knighted. In 1605 the first Catalogue, compiled by Thomas 
James and dedicated to Prince Henry, appeared. Bodley’s 
letters to his earliest Librarian, frequent, racy and delightful 
letters, show his keen interest, not only in the building but in 
every detail of its administration. We have notes about the

1602 (Bodl. Quart. Record, II, 100), But the library of the Bishop of

    216 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
books acquired. Plays, almanacs and day-books Bodley would 
not have. Hardly one play in forty, he thought, was worth 
the keeping—though Shakespeare filled the stage. He would 
not stuff his Library with ‘“ baggage-books’’ or “ riffe raffes.”” 
We have instructions about desks and shelves and chains, advice 
about wainscoting and painting.1 We have protests against 
closing the Library too long. We have questions about catalogu- 
ing, binding, cleaning. A little rosemary is to be rubbed into 
the floor: but ‘‘ the Breeding of Worms in your Desks we cannot 
prevent.’”” We have questions more rarely which affect the 
Librarian personally. The demands for his attendance were 
exacting: the six hours sometimes mounted up to ten. There 
were questions of salary. James had only twenty-two pounds, 
thirteen and fourpence to begin with. He asked for more. But 
Bodley was not prepared ‘‘ to charge the spitte with too muche 
rostmeat,”’ and it was not till 16r0 that the Statutes assigned 
the Keeper forty pounds a year. Till the Under-Keeper was 
appointed James had no assistant but the Cleanser. Had it 
not been for the Delegates of Convocation, he would hardly 
have persuaded the Founder to give him the Staff which he 
required.2 But even worse than a demand for salary was James’ 
announcement that he wished to marry. Kindly and affectionate 
as he was, Bodley could not conceal his bitter disappointment. 
He had always thought James “ alienissimus from any such 
Cogitation.” He would not at first hear of it. When he yielded, 
it was on the strict understanding that the rule of celibacy should 
be “‘inviolable’’ in future. And inviolable it was, with some 
curious exceptions, till a much later date.3 
1 Mr. G. W. Wheeler, to whose exact knowledge I am here constantly 
indebted, points out that some wainscots referred to by Bodley were often 
pieces of wood to be made into shelves. 
2 On this point see Mr. Wheeler’s two papers in the Bodleian Quarterly 
Record (II, 279-85 and 310-13). The Keeper’s £40 a year assigned by the 
Statutes consisted of £33.6.8 from Library revenues and of (6.13.4 from 
Henry IV’s donation, which had been assigned to the Keeper of the earlier 
Library. 
3 See Reliquie Bodleiane (passim, and especially 49-54 and 162) and 
Macray (Ann. 26). The original letters of Bodley were mostly printed by 
Hearne, but without adequate dates or arrangement. They have now 
been carefully arranged in the Library, though the proposal to reprint 
them is postponed. I have been kindly allowed to study Mr. Wheeler’s 
chronological list. The letter numbered iii in Relig. Bodl., objecting to 
James’ marriage and dated Sept. 11, belongs to 1601. The letter numbered 
xxvii, consenting to it and dated Aug. 11, belongs to 1602. The rule of 
celibacy lasted into the nineteenth century, but one Librarian nevertheless 
married twice. Some of the letters on building matters (marked by Hearne 
cexix, cciii and ccxxix) belong to 1611 and 1612. The protest against 
closing the Library too long for vacations (Hearne’s cxxxvii) was the last 
of Bodley’s letters and was written on Jan. 3, 1613. An interesting letter

Under-paid or over-paid, married or unmarried, James was 
too valuable an officer to lose. A learned, large-minded and 
far-sighted man, “‘ esteemed by some a living library,” he re- 
mained in charge till 1620, and he continued to work at the 
Catalogue even after he retired. The first printed Catalogue, 
produced by Joseph Barnes not without difficulties in 1605,1 
included nearly six thousand volumes. But it was made when 
books were flowing in, and a third of them were placed in the 
Appendix. The shelves were arranged according to Faculties, 
under the four time-honoured headings of Theology, Medicine, 
Law and Arts.? Bodley at first saw no need for press-marks, and 
he insisted on keeping manuscripts and printed books together. 
Classification presented many problems. Law included the 
art of government and Medicine the greater part of Natural 
History. Arts comprised so many subjects—history, philosophy, 
mathematics, literature, language—that it was bound ultimately 
to increase out of proportion to the others. But for many 
years Theology held its own.* In the first Catalogue there were 
only three works on English literature, and it was not till 1635 
that Shakespeare’s name appeared. The Bodleian was intended 
to be a Library for scholars. No English translation of a Greek 
or Latin book was allowed in early days. But even scholars 
like James and Bodley were divided as to whether a Hebrew 
Lexicon and Grammar belonged to Theology or Arts.6 The 
folios were chained to the shelves and easily accessible. The 
quartos and octavos were for long locked away, and readers 
may sometimes ‘‘for modesty sake” have hesitated to trouble 
the Librarian for them.? To each book-case a frame was affixed, 
on which the titles of the books were entered under the initial 
of 1612, not given by Hearne, is printed in the Bodleian Record for Novem- 
ber ror9 (II, 287). 
1 There is an earlier MS. catalogue of 1602 (in MS. Rawl. Q. e. 31), 
and there are indications of at least one other earlier than this (Bod. 
Quart. Rec. II, 147 and 150). 
2 Theology had 9 alcoves allotted to it, Medicine 13, Law 3 and Arts 
44 (Ib. I, 283). In the original arrangement, which Bodley preferred, 
Law came before Medicine. 
3 Twyne complained of James’ action in locking up the MSS. after 
Bodley’s death (Ib. I, 287). 
4 Up to 1652 at any rate Theology increased more rapidly than Arts 
(Ib. I, 260-1). 
5 And there is only one from French or Italian in the Catalogue of 
1620. Florio’s translation of Montaigne, Sir H. Savile’s translation of 
Tacitus and the English version of Camden’s Britannia were all excluded 
(Ib. I, 115-16). 
® Bodley pressed for a special catalogue of Hebrew books, and steps 
were taken to carry out his wishes (Ib. III, 144-6). 
7 Quartos bound in boards were chained with the folios, The prac- 
tice was extended at Twyne’s suggestion.

letter of the author’s name; and these frames became the basis 
of the first printed Catalogue, “the earliest general catalogue 
of any European public library.” The idea was new. The 
proof-sheets called for Bodley’s criticism. Barnes’ Hebrew 
type was by no means above reproach. There were other faults 
also, and James, well aware of them, had some reason for the 
“‘weerinesse and weaknesse”’ which he felt. But the first 
Bodleian Catalogue was nevertheless a considerable achievement 
and a valuable piece of pioneering work. 
The second Catalogue, published in 1620, was more ambitious. 
It was arranged in alphabetical order and included some sixteen 
thousand books. James’ preface to it shows that he had little 
liking for the system of classification by shelves. He would 
have preferred to divide the books into three sizes, folio, quarto 
and octavo, to number them consecutively, and to supplement 
the alphabetical Catalogue of authors by subject-catalogues in 
each Faculty. He had already, it seems, compiled subject- 
catalogues in Theology, Medicine and Law. He continued these 
labours after his retirement and crowned them with an elaborate 
subject-catalogue in Arts.2_ James had, it seems, a real desire 
to help the younger students, though Twyne criticised his atti- 
tude towards them. He wished to form a selected library for 
undergraduates reading Arts. He insisted upon indexes. He 
recommended scholars to use note-books. Latinist though he 
was, he saw the value of learning modern languages. Protestant 
as he was, ‘‘ the most industrious and indefatigable writer against 
the Papists that had been educated in Oxon since the refor- 
mation of religion,” he believed that the reading of theology 
would contribute to confound the friends of Rome.* If James 
was disappointed in his hopes of ecclesiastical preferment, and 
if, as Bodley once suggested, he was a little inclined to take things 
up too eagerly—he was still a young man when he entered on 
his task—he must yet have had a real enthusiasm for the fine 
work to which he gave so many years, and his services seem hardly 
to have been appreciated as thoroughly as they deserved. 
James’ work held the field for many years. But in 1635 the 
1 The Bodleian Quarterly Record has printed in recent years several 
valuable notes and articles on the early history of the Library, its cata- 
logues and its arrangements. To Mr. G. W. Wheeler’s papers I am very 
much obliged, not to mention help received from Mr. Madan, Dr. Craster, 
Mr. Gibson and others. (See especially Record, I, 228-32, 254-62, 280-9 ; 
II, 17-23, 147-51, 279-85, 310-14; and III, 46-50, 98, 119-21, 144-6.)

second Catalogue received an Appendix, drawn up by John 
Rouse, in which a few great dramatists’ names were suffered to 
appear. Then the War came, and after the Restoration an 
attempt was made, under Dr. Lockey’s Librarianship, to compile 
a new Catalogue. Fifty Masters of Arts were incautiously 
called in to help. But this attempt apparently came to nothing, 
and it was left for Thomas Hyde, Lockey’s successor, to produce 
a more extensive Catalogue in 1674. Hyde knew little of biblio- 
graphy, though he had a considerable reputation as an Oriental 
scholar. He had little of James’ enthusiasm for his work. He 
felt keenly the drudgery of the business. He was very much 
alive, especially in winter, to the physical discomforts of his 
lot. But in the end he had some right to claim that he had 
issued the most copious and useful Catalogue of the Library as 
yet achieved. 
James may have disliked being applied to by readers to get 
out the smaller books. But he set to work to make a list of 
these applicants, and of others who used the Library as well.1 
The earliest list of admissions runs from r602 to the date of 
James’ resignation. Among the Colleges Christ Church, it seems, 
supplied the longest list of readers, with Gentilis figuring among 
them. The average daily attendance was at first only sixteen. 
After 1616 autographs accompany the entries of admission : 
after 1618 lists of foreigners of gentle birth. The Registers of 
Congregation, which give the Graces granted for admission, 
include many foreign names. We find more than one student 
styled ‘‘ Patricius ’’ from Niirnberg. We find a great Scottish 
peer like Arran. We find Oxford boys like Sir Walter Ralegh’s 
sons. We find Puritan leaders like Abbot and Holland and 
Rainolds. We are not so sure of Laud. In 1605 the King 
paid a visit to the Library, and praised it with a com- 
bination of pedantry and facetiousness peculiarly his own. 
The Librarian, warned by Bodley to imitate the King’s pronun- 
ciation and to make his speech of welcome “ short and sweet and 
full of Stuff,” claimed that thirty languages were already repre- 
sented and that readers came from every part of Europe.?. The 
King was so impressed that he rashly promised to give Sir Thomas 
1 This Register (MS. Bodl. 763) only lately re-discovered runs from 
Nov. 8, 1602 to Nov. 7, 1603. Besides that we, no doubt, owe to James 
the earliest Admission Register, 1602-1620, which is not mentioned by 
Dr. Macray (Record, I, 328-9, and II, 148). Dr. Clark has drawn atten- 
tion to the Register of Admissions, from 1610 or 1611 to 1692, and has 
analysed the Graces for admission contained in the Registers of Congre- 
gation (Univ. Reg. II, i, 262-82). See also Bodl. Quart. Rec. (IV, 95). 
2 In 1611 James counted French, Spanish, Italian and Dutch readers 
—Dutch includes German—as well as ‘‘ Danes, Bohemians, Polonians, 
Jewes, Ethiopians, and others” (Piet, Oxon. 13).

    220 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
any volumes from the Royal Libraries that he cared to take. 
Official influences perhaps prevented a too literal interpretation 
of this pledge.t In the same year Bacon sent the Founder a 
copy of his Advancement of Learning. The Library authorities 
treated it as an unnecessary duplicate when another copy came 
into their hands. In the same spirit later they disposed of the 
First Folio of Shakespeare when they received a copy of the 
Third.2 The Library grew. In 1609 the Founder purchased 
as a permanent endowment a manor belonging to Lord Norris 
at Maidenhead. The books increased so fast that an extension 
of space was needed, and in r610 the Eastern addition to Duke 
Humphrey’s Library, the Arts End over the Proscholium, was 
begun.* In the same year a fee of twelve pence was fixed for 
admission. On a far-sighted suggestion made by Thomas James, 
the Stationers’ Company in London agreed to give the Library a 
copy of every book they printed.4 And the Statutes, after 
examination by a Delegacy of Convocation, were finally confirmed. 
Bodley’s English draft of his Statutes is preserved among the 
archives of his Library, and was printed a hundred years later 
by Hearne.’ There are careful rules for the election of the 
Keeper and his assistant, and for the keeping of the great Register 
‘of donors chained in ‘‘the upper broad Window.” There are 
tules as to the arrangements and the hours of admission—from 
eight to eleven in the morning, from two to five in the after- 
1 But Bodley obtained a warrant to confirm the King’s promise (Relig. 
Bodl, 205). For James’ visit in 1605 see Oxford’s Triumph and Rex 
Platonicus (6th ed., 182 sq.). James visited the Library again in 1614. 
2 It was not till 1821 that another copy of the First Folio was secured 
(Macray, Ann. 52). But the remarkable story of the return of the copy 
which had been disposed of to its old home in 1905 has been told by more 
than one writer. Mr. Gibson’s account (Some Oxford Libraries, 75-6) 
characteristically omits to mention that it was his own skill and knowledge 
of bindings which identified the book. 
3 Twyne (XXI, 285) gives an account of the laying of the foundation- 
stone by John King, Dean of Christ Church and Vice-Chancellor, on the 
29th July 1610. ‘This, though it has been doubted, seems to be the right 
date. 
¢ On this important agreement, which became a statutory obligation 
under Charles II, see Macray (Amun. 40-1, 44-6). 
5 See Relig. Bodl. (16-44). There is a more accurate reprint in 
Trecent. Bodl. (27-64). Dr. John Budden’s translation of Bodley’s 
draft into Latin—Twyne’s copy of it, Dr. Clark thinks (Wood’s Life, IV, 
147)—is inserted after p. 568 in MS. Wood D.32. A transcript by T. James 
is in [Bodl.] MS. Arch. Seld. A 75. Bodley had ‘‘ rudely conceaued ’”’ his 
Statutes by June 1608, and had drawn up a series of headings for them as 
early as 1602, which Mr. G. W. Wheeler has lately printed from MS. Wood 
F. 27 in a valuable Note in the Bodleian Quarterly Record (III, 119-21). 
The Statutes, in which the Delegates made few alterations—these are

noon. The Library is rarely to be closed. No man, not even 
the Keeper, may enter it with torch, lamp, or candle, under 
pain of deprivation for ever. Access is to be limited generally 
to Doctors, Masters, Bachelors. But sons of Lords of Parliament 
and contributors of gifts have special claims. Other students 
can be admitted by Grace of Congregation. Bodley would not 
have sight-seers “‘ pestering all the Room,” disturbing students, 
“babling and trampling up and down.” A few years later, 
when a German visitor, Baron von Eulenberg, fell to fighting 
with a Welshman in the Library, sticks and weapons were pro- 
hibited as well. No volume is to be lent to any person “ of 
whatever State or Calling, upon any kind of Caution or offer of 
Security.” Yet just at the beginning, Bodley confesses to 
James, he has spared one book ‘‘ by way of Connivance”’ to a 
good friend, Sir Henry Savile, ‘‘ for a very short space.” There 
was never again to be such weakness. When Charles I and 
Cromwell tried to borrow books, they were both inexorably 
refused. Any graduate convicted of stealing, dismembering or 
altering any volume is to be publicly disgraded and banished. 
Eight perpetual Overseers and Visitors of the Library are to be 
appointed, from Vice-Chancellors, Proctors and Professors ; and, 
though it cannot be supposed that such a duty calls for any 
recompense, an allowance for dinners and gloves is permitted 
them, to render the honour agreeable as well. Bodley watched 
over his Library tenderly, worked for it, saved for it, begged for 
it wherever hecould. In June 1604 he presented to it the Warning 
Bell of Ingress and Egress mentioned in the Statutes,* and a 
treasure-chest with finely elaborated locks. In January 1613, 
however, he succumbed to a long and troublesome illness. A 
stately funeral at Merton followed. Volumes of elegiac verse, to 
which William Laud and Isaac Casaubon contributed, expressed 
the grateful University’s regret. But monuments and elegies 
could add nothing to the splendour of the memorial which Bodley 
had built to his own fame. 
The Founder’s will gave rise to some heart-burnings among 
disappointed legatees.4 And one of his Executors was accused 
November 1613, and there were some additional regulations in 1621.

  222 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
of defrauding his estate.1 Most of his money he devoted to his 
Library, and few will question his right to do so. But three 
projects in particular seem to have lain near his heart. As 
early as 1611 Bodley had urged upon the University the need of 
better Schools, in place of the “‘ ruinous little roomes ” existing. 
In his will he suggested that, if the plan for the new Schools 
went forward, a third storey should be added over them, giving 
“a very large supplement for stowage of Bookes.’”’ Next, 
a fair stair-case? was to be raised, “to make y® ascent more 
easye and gracefull to y° first great Librarie.”” And thirdly, 
there was to be “ some bewtifull enlargment ”’ of the Library at 
the West end towards Exeter College. All three schemes were 
carried through. The new Schools and the third storey of the 
Schools Quadrangle were built within a short time of Bodley’s 
death, The familiar corner stair-case was erected. The West 
wing, with a new Convocation House beneath it, was finished 
before the Civil War broke out. Selden’s great bequest was 
stored there just before the Restoration. But the motto inside 
Selden’s books, 
wegl savtdc tiv edevdeolay, 
was not one to be much regarded in the days which followed. 
Thomas James retired in 1620, John Rouse, the new Librar- 
ian, is remembered as a friend of Milton, but he had no disrespect 
for Kings. The compliments which he bestowed on the Works 
of King James may rank with any courtier’s adulation, and he 
subscribed fifty pounds to the necessities of King Charles. But 
when Charles tried to borrow a book from the Library, Rouse did 
not hesitate to point out that the rules forbade. His influence, 
however, obtained from Milton a presentation copy of the great 
Puritan’s early poems. Another famous author’s gift, the copy 
of his Essays which Francis Bacon had originally sent to Bucking- 
ham, found its way to the Library earlier, bound, like two or 
three volumes which had once belonged to Bacon’s Mistress, in 
fine embroideries of gold and silver thread. In one of these 
volumes there are notes in Elizabeth’s handwriting. On some 
of the covers there is work from her needle. And the Library 
has a translation from Cicero in her hand. An exercise-book of 
Edward VI is also to be found among its autographs. And

where no charge of fraud is brought, Macray (46-7) and D.N.B. The facts 
are not very clear, but a note in Reg. K supports the charge. (See 
Gibson’s Statutes, 516, n.).

a beautifully illuminated Book of Hours inscribed by Mary 
Tudor was presented to it in 1615. 
In Rouse’s day, but through no fault of the Librarian, the 
inevitable thefts from the Bodleian began. But they were of 
little moment compared with the presents which flowed in. 
In 1629 William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, whose initials have 
never been quite dissociated from the possibility of a great 
romance, gave the University with his ‘“ beste love ” the famous 
library of Giacomo Barocci of Venice, containing many valuable 
Greek manuscripts. This noble gift, which Laud sent down to 
Oxford on the Chancellor’s behalf, was completed by Cromwell 
in 1654. At the same time Laud forwarded from London twenty- 
nine manuscripts given by the great traveller Sir Thomas Roe. 
In the years that followed he presented still more splendid 
offerings of his own—cabinets of coins, an Arabian astrolabe, a 
fine bust of Charles I,? above all a collection of some twelve or 
thirteen hundred manuscripts on which no book-lover could 
look unmoved. They included a seventh-century manuscript 
of the Acts of the Apostles, which once, it is probable, belonged 
to Bede, and a precious copy of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 
continued to 1154. A store of manuscripts from Sir Kenelm 
Digby, many of them works of medizval science collected by 
Thomas Allen the astrologer, reached the Library in 1634. The 
earliest known copy of the Chanson de Roland was among Digby’s 
gifts. Robert Burton’s bequest a few years later was happily 
rich in day-books, pamphlets and “ currantoes,” the very kind 
of ephemeral baggage which Bodley had disdained. From the 
same age we have notes on the work of Oxford binders, preserved 
in the Bodleian Day-books and Accounts. One binder liked 
green edges for his leaves, another blue, a third, it seems, variegated 
colours. Roger Barnes, brother to the University printer, 
mentioned his “ greate pressing presse’ and his tools among his 
effects. And William Wildgoose was the binder who in 1624 
received an order to bind “‘ William Shakespeares comedies 
histories etc.,” the first Folio which was to be so wantonly 
disposed of and long afterwards so romantically restored. 
King Charles visited the Library in 1629, hailed by the 
Public Orator as ‘‘ Excellentissime Vice-Deus.’’ Charles was

there again in 1636and he might well have been in the Bodleian 
later. In 1642 he borrowed five hundred pounds from Bodley’s 
Chest, which the authorities with pathetic optimism continued 
to treat as repayable until 1782. Fairfax, on the surrender of 
the City, set a guard to save the Library, and afterwards left it a 
valuable bequest.1 Cromwell gave it manuscripts and praised 
the strictness of its regulations, when refused permission to 
take out a book. Thomas Barlow of Queen’s succeeded Rouse 
as Librarian in 1652 and held the place until the Restoration. 
The pay of his post and of his subordinates was unaltered still.? 
In those years John Evelyn figured in the list of donors, and the 
eight thousand volumes of Selden’s great bequest fellin. Charles 
II was welcomed with enthusiasm after his Restoration, and 
entertained at a great banquet in the Selden wing at the West 
end. James II breakfasted there while the dynasty lasted, and 
discussed Chinese theology with the Keeper. Clarendon as 
Chancellor was at home there. Thomas Hyde, who so disliked 
the cold,’ continued in office as Librarian when his namesake 
fell. Isaac Casaubon’s notes on scholarship, filling over sixty 
volumes, reached the Bodleian in 1671. Rare Anglo-Saxon 
manuscripts came in the same years from the collections of 
Lord Hatton 4 and Franciscus Junius, including a translation 
made by King Alfred of Gregory’s Pastoral Care, and a quaintly 
illustrated paraphrase of parts of Genesis, Exodus and Daniel, 
which may possibly be Cedmon’s work.’ Other valuable 
manuscripts of the ninth and tenth centuries with Welsh and 
Cornish glosses came from elsewhere. One was decorated with 
a drawing of Dunstan and was once not improbably Dunstan’s 
own. The great Vernon manuscript of early English poetry, 
gifts from famous Cavaliers like Newcastle and Ormonde, the 
lantern which helped to arrest Guy Fawkes, a chair made from 
the timbers of the unforgotten Golden Hind,’ were among the 
many valuable offerings made to the Bodleian before the seven- 
teenth century closed. Its income was then between three

and four hundred a year, and it contained perhaps six thousand 
manuscripts and twenty-five or thirty thousand printed books. 
In 1682 an annual speech or lecture, founded by bequest some 
years before! to commemorate Sir Thomas Bodley and incident- 
ally to encourage Hebrew studies, was established by decree 
of Convocation, and has since done justice yearly to the Founder’s 
fame.? 
But Bodley not only established in Oxford a Library with 
which none except the Vatican’s could compare. He set on 
foot a scheme of building such as few Universities had con- 
templated yet. As Cobham’s Library recalls the old House of 
Congregation at St. Mary’s, as Duke Humphrey’s Library was 
originally an adjunct of the grand Divinity School beneath, 
so Bodley’s Library became an inseparable part of the new 
Schools Quadrangle, by which seventeenth-century Oxford 
replaced the small and ruinous buildings of an earlier day. Be- 
tween Brasenose Lane and the Northern end of Cat Street, 
some of the old Schools still survived, amid the relics of medieval 
Oxford and the houses of binders and parchment-makers, illu- 
minators and scribes. We hear of them in King Edward’s day 
as disused and forsaken. Glovers and laundresses, it is said, 
had taken possession of the seat where once “ Minerva sate.”’ 
We read vaguely of nettles and brambles growing there, of a 
“stinking pound for cattle,” ® of a pig-market on the space where 
the North end of Schools Street ran. Early in Queen Mary’s 
reign the University secured from Christ Church the Arts Schools 
of 1439, which had been built on Oseney land, and in the years 
which followed more than one Vice-Chancellor may have taken 
part in rebuilding or restoring them. But by the end of the 
century they were felt to be inadequate, or they may have 
fallen again into disrepair. When Bodley began to extend the 
Library eastwards, he broke into this area and set on foot the 
idea of rebuilding it all. It was proposed that the Proscholium, 
with his new wing above it, should form the West side of a new 
quadrangle, sweeping away the medizval houses, and stretching 
as far as Cat Street on the East. Spurred by Bodley’s example

collections in Mr. Madan’s little treatise (The Bodleian Library, Chap. V). 
3 Wood’s language is the most severe (Amn. II, 780). The Proscho- 
lium represents the traditional site of the pig-market. But these state- 
ments must be taken with reserve; accurate information is wanting.

Chancellors’ accounts we have. (See anie, p. 93, 0.).

and encouragement, the University took up the scheme. On the 
day after Sir Thomas’ funeral at Merton, Sir John Bennet, his 
executor, laid the foundation-stone of a ‘‘ compleat quadrangular 
pile,” combining, as the builders of seventeenth-century Oxford 
loved to do, elaborate classic decorations with the old traditions 
of Gothic art. This pile, with the older and the later buildings 
gathered round it, is the chief visible embodiment of the University 
to-day. 
The Proscholium, the high stone vestibule at the East end of 
the Divinity School, was intended as a “ vaulted walke” for 
students waiting in wet weather for lectures to begin.! Its 
fine roof may have been suggested by older work at Merton. 
Its fine carved door gave entrance to the Divinity School. On 
its walls the stone panelling copied from the Divinity School 
remains. Over the archway runs Bodley’s inscription : 
Quod feliciter vortat 
Academici Oxoniens. 
Bibliothecam hanc 
Vobis Reipublicaeque 
Literatorum 
TBP; 
Above, at right angles to Duke Humphrey’s Library, was the 
real Bodleian, the first addition to the older room. The beautiful 
timber roof with its paintings was repeated. A noble window * 
broke through the stone panelling on the Eastern wall. Two 
graceful little wooden stair-cases led up to galleries inside.* 
Under the galleries the books were chained, but they could be 
lifted down and rested on the counters below. Locked cup- 
boards, which still survive, protected the most precious volumes. 
Close beside Duke Humphrey’s Library, reserved for the 
higher Faculties after 1612, stood the globes, celestial and ter- 
restrial, without which no seventeenth-century Library was 
complete. 
Bodley’s East wing was finished in his lifetime ; he pawned 
1 After the Convocation House was built, candidates for degrees had 
to wait here bare-headed while their Grace was asked, for personal inspec- 
tion by any Regents who desired to see them (Clark, Bodl. Guide, 19-20). 
2 Dr. Clark thinks that this door was brought here from the West 
end about 1639 (Bodl. Guide, 18). But I know of no authority for this 
conjecture. Wren’s door on the North side was built into the central 
window in 1669. An iron gate was made at the entrance to the Pro- 
scholium about 1622-3 (Pietas Oxon. 12, 0.), 
3 But the curious old glass in it was not presented till 1797. 
« They have lately been restored, in careful imitation of the originals 
removed about 1800, by the aid of drawings made by Conrad Von Uffen- 
bach, a German visitor in 1710 (Bodl. Quart, Rec. II, 103-4 and 127-8). 
Bodley preferred 2 to 4. For the appearance of the old Library before 
Bodley’s wing was added see Pietas Oxon. (9-11).

his plate to carry it through. The quadrangle beyond was 
begun in 1613, and Sir John Bennet, whatever his failings, 
helped greatly to get subscriptions in. On each side were two 
storeys of Schools, rising together to the height of the Proscholium. 
On the South were the Schools of Natural Philosophy and Music, 
with Medicine and Rhetoric above. On the North were the 
Schools of Moral Philosophy and of Grammar and History, 
with Civil Law and Greek above.!_ On the East were the Schools 
of Metaphysic and Logic, with Geometry and Arithmetic and 
Astronomy above. Stair-cases were set in each corner of the 
court. On the East side lay the chief entrance, and over it “‘ an 
eminent and stately Tower,”’ with four floors devoted respectively 
to the Mathematical Library of the Savilian Professors, to the 
Picture Gallery, to the University Archives and to the Observatory 
at the top. The gateway into Cat Street was closed by an 
imposing door, now shut by long custom except on two days 
in the year. It opens in March to receive the new Proctors, and 
in June to admit the ceremonial procession on its way to com- 
memorate the ancient Act. The shields of the Colleges which 
enriched the panels ceased with the arms of Wadham, founded 
just before the building was begun. 
The Tower, mainly Gothic in its spirit and its workmanship, 
for all its rich and delicate ornamentation, was ascended by a 
winding stair. It represented the five orders of architecture, 
from the plain Tuscan of the ground floor, up through Doric, 
Tonic and Corinthian, to the Composite adornments and mouldings 
above. Picturesque and charming as it is, it wants perhaps 
those ‘‘ solid, masculine, and unaffected qualities’ which the 
greatest of English architects required. High up were set carved 
figures and inscriptions—James, “the most learned, munificent 
and best of Kings,” presenting volumes to the University and to 
Fame. Tradition says that the King’s figure at first was gilded, 
and that James on a visit to the new buildings? begged to be 
1 The Greek School was also called Schola Linguarum. The names and 
uses of the rooms varied with time. (See Wood, Amn. II, 792.) In the 
end the Library obtained possession of them all. See also Wood’s Life 
(II, 63-5) and Bodi. Quart. Record (II, 74-7). 
2 Dr. Clark dates this visit 1619 (Bodl. Guide, 10). Wood mentions 
no visit to Oxford under that year, only one to Woodstock under 1621. 
But at the end of the Annals (II, 793) he speaks of the King coming over 
from Woodstock to see the new Schools, without giving a date. Nichols 
(Progresses of James I, II, 23) quotes this passage under 1614; but the 
statues could hardly have been ready then. From Nichols’ account of 
the King’s movements in 1619 (III, 564) it seems that James was at 
Woodstock and Rycote that summer. He might possibly have visited 
Oxford then, but I know no record of it. The Vice-Chancellor’s Accounts 
in the University Archives (Computus Vice-Can. 1621-66, pp. 1-58) give

allowed a coat of white-wash. The arms of Pembroke found 
a place over the South passage to St. Mary’s: there is admirable 
lead-work on this South fagade. The quadrangle, like the 
Tower, had fine rectangular windows, divided up by shafts and 
transoms. But the soft stone of the Headington and Taynton 
quarries needs re-facing often, and in one of the restorations 
the transoms for the most part disappeared. Through the 
third storey of the Tower, above the Schools, ran the great 
gallery which Bodley had designed, with “ two Lobies or pas- 
sages framed with some speciall comlines of workmanshippe,” 
to make a fair entrance into his Eastern wing. 
The Picture Gallery, with its space for “stowage,” was 
provided in part by subscription and in part by Bodley’s will. 
Its corridors formed a covered walk for students. Its painted 
roof must frequently have drawn their eyes.?— Portraits and 
building expenses of a rather later date, but do not seem to throw any light 
on this point. On the Tower itself see Sir R. Blomfield’s criticism (Hist. 
of Renaissance Architecture, 54 sq.) At the beginning of Convocation 
Register N details of expenses are given ‘‘instructura tertiae partis Anglice 
the third story novarum scholarum.” 
1 That is, into the Library. The cost of the third storey is entered as 
£2,497 Ios. in Registey N, under date Nov. 25, 1615. Wood speaks of a 
total expenditure of £4,500, apart from moneys given by Bodley (Ann. 
II, 791). Fees had to be raised to help to pay. (See thedecrees of 1615 
and 1628 in Gibson’s Statutes, 520 and 560-1.) The work was not finished 
in 1615. The date on the water-pipe by the Library door is 1618, and a 
smith’s bill of 1619 for hinges, locks, etc., is in the University Archives. 
(See Dr. Poole’s Lecture on Hist. of Archives, 16-18), John Hawley, 
Principal of Gloucester Hall, received a D.C.L. for superintending the 
building (Reg. K, 154»): but the credit for the design is not easy to 
apportion. Thomas Holt, the master-carpenter, was spoken of as archi- 
tect of the Schools on his monument in Holywell Church (Peshall, Antient 
and Present State of City of Oxford, Addendum on Inscriptions, p. 15) ; 
and Wood (Life, I, 160) uses the same phrase. The monuments of John 
Acroyd and John Bentley make similar claims for them, But in Bodley’s 
lifetime Holt is not mentioned as working for him, though the masons 
Acroyd and the two Bentleys are (Blomfield, Renaissance Architecture, 
57-8). Holt was clearly not the architect in our modern sense—Acroyd 
may have a better claim than he—but he probably was responsible for 
the woodwork : he is nearly always referred to as “‘ ye carpenter ”’ in the 
Vice-Chancellor’s building accounts. It is not impossible that Savile, 
the patron of Holt, Acroyd and Bentley, may have had some say in the 
design, especially of the Tower, as the contemporary work at Merton 
suggests. (See Mrs. Poole’s valuable note, Bodl. Quart. Rec. III, 263-4). 
Twyne gives us no help on these points, and it is not easy to do full justice 
to the great impersonal builders and architects of Oxford before the days 
of Sir Christopher Wren, In 1638, however, the timber-work had to be 
strengthened, and even earlier, says the Vice-Chancellor’s Computus 
(25); and the Laudian Statutes speak of the whole fabric as ‘‘ male 
materiatam ”’ (Title XX, S. iv). 
2 Some of its panels are in the Upper Reading Room now (Bodl, Quart. 
Rec. II, 105).

rarities were gradually collected for it. Wood speaks of faces 
round the walls, illustrious Oxford faces, which have vanished. 
But the oldest picture-gallery in England is full of famous por- 
traits still Bodley is there, with a group of Chancellors whom 
he could remember, reinforced by Clarendon and Sheldon later. 
Wolsey and More are there, and Gardiner and Cranmer. Burgh- 
ley is there, close to his exacting Mistress: the reputed mule, 
which he bestrides in one picture, is an ass and not a mule at 
all.2 Mary Stuart, a picture with a curious history, and Lady 
Jane Grey recall the tragedies of Queens. Hawkins and Frobisher 
stand for the world of adventure. Erasmus, Galileo, Grotius 
speak for the scholar’s catholicity of taste. Ben Jonson, Cowley, 
Dryden are among the poets: it is Cowley whose verses com- 
memorate the chair made from the Golden Hind. Pembroke’s 
fine statue, cast in bronze, in Jacobean armour, stands out in the 
central chamber under the Tower. Laud and Strafford are in 
the gallery, and Falkland, who could die for a cause which he 
misdoubted ; and with them are portraits of Sir Kenelm Digby, 
now discredited, and of the Royal Stuarts whom they served. 
James I and his two sons, Henry and Charles, hang close together, 
and Charles II whom Oxford students recalled as “‘ an impudent- 
lipped, black-avised boy.” Savile and Wotton and Camden and 
Harvey are flanked by many other representatives of learning. 
Bodley’s famous chest is kept here. Clarendon’s cabinet has 
since been added. And a far older relic, the embroidered pall 
used when the University said Mass for Henry VII, still displays 
amid its Tudor badges the silver greyhound of Beaufort and the 
red dragon of Wales.? 
The stair-case with its thirteen flights in the South-West 
corner of the quadrangle, the easy stair-case which Bodley had 
desired, leads also to the old School of Medicine and Anatomy. 
Here the Regius Professor of Medicine lectured, and the Medical 
students’ disputations were held. Its collection of “ incom- 
parable curiosities ”—a human skin, an Indian serpent, a robe 
of Tartar lambskin ¢ given to Elizabeth’s envoy by Ivan the 
1 See Wood’s long list (Ann. II, 954 sqg.). He says that portraits of 
Founders of all the Colleges were hung there about 1670. Hearne in 1708 
gives a list of 222 portraits from Archimedes downwards—no doubt the 
heads or faces to which Wood refers, Renovated in 1715, they were 
cleared away in 1831: but one still survives. (See Bodl. Quart. Rec. II, 
105-6). I hope to return to this subject later, 2 Ib, (158).

the 18th century. Dr, Clark’s measurements of the gallery are 129} ft.

side (Bodl. Guide, 70).

Terrible and known as “ Joseph’s coat ’’—long drew the admira- 
tion of observers, and amused the insatiable leisure of Charles II. 
Near this South-Western corner, under a window in the outer 
wall, a St. Andrew’s cross still marks the boundary of St. Mildred’s 
parish which has disappeared, and here on Ascension Day the 
choir-boys of St. Michael’s still beat the bounds with willow- 
wands. On the other side of the Library, where the original 
stair-case mounted, a Western wing was needed to complete the 
Founder’s plan, and here from 1634 onwards a new Convocation 
House was built, with an unrobing room, an Apodyterium, at 
its Northern end. It corresponded to the Proscholium, and 
flanked the Divinity School upon the West. Its roof was a 
late example of the fan-tracery in which Oxford masons still 
excelled. Over it the Selden end was added to the Library, and 
the old turret stair was swept away.1 A new and stately room, well 
lit with windows,? reproduced at the West end of the old Library 
the general plan of Bodley’s wing. Here Laud’s manuscripts 
were stored and later Digby’s. Here Selden’s great collection 
afterwards found a home. Here Selden’s portrait hangs and 
Bodley’s bell is kept. And here the University, ever unwilling 
to give umbrage to its rulers, offered hospitality, as circumstances 
altered, to Fairfax and Cromwell, the second Charles, the second 
ames. 
: James I, with whose reign this noble scheme of buildings 
is connected, may not have deserved the flatteries which the 
University bestowed. He has indeed been accused of an incred- 
ible preference for Cambridge. But he had at least a serious love 
of learning and serious intentions of ecclesiastical reform. Before 
the end of 1603 he received the representatives of the University 
at Woodstock, and promised to visit Oxford when the plague, 
which had again broken out with fury, died away. He was 
often at Woodstock as the reign went on.? He came in state 
to Oxford in August 1605, and in 1614, and it may be later also, 
he paid a brief visit to the Bodleian. The first visit was a great 
occasion, though Cambridge scholars made a mock of it in 
1 The main fabric seems to have cost some £2,820, the interior £1,130, 
the site about £265. It was not completely fitted up till six years later 
(Bodl. Guide, 102), But see the details given by Dr. Clark in Wood’s 
Life (IV, 53-5), where the figures are slightly different. Among the 
workmen mentioned are William Mason for stone-work, Edward Brom- 
field for carpentry, Thomas Richardson, and again Jackson.

been blocked up. 
3 In 1621, says Wood, the wits of the University acted the “‘ Marriage 
of Arts” before the King at Woodstock, without much success (Aun. 
II, 339). Wood also says that in 1610 the King and Queen passed through 
Oxford on their way to Woodstock (Ann. II, 306).

verse. Regulations were issued, preachers and disputants 
selected, windows, railings, gates fresh painted, all arms newly 
tricked. And to enlarge the Royal lodgings at Christ Church, 
“a wall or study,” we are told, was pulled down. The arrange- 
ments for the theatre in Christ Church Hall gave some trouble, 
and the authorities differed as to where the King should sit. 
The King and Queen and the boy Prince Henry arrived on 
Tuesday, the 27th August with a great train of lords and ladies. 
The procedure generally followed the Elizabethan plan—the 
reception by the Academic leaders,1 the welcome by the Mayor 
and citizens further on, the acclamations of the crowd from 
North Gate down to Christ Church, the Greek speech at Carfax, 
and the Public Orator’s “ Ciceronian” effort ere they entered 
the Cathedral doors. One new incident was admitted, a pause 
at the gates of St. John’s College, where three Sibyls * recalled 
to James old Scottish legends foretelling the greatness of his 
race. And after the first ceremonies at Christ Church Prince 
Henry was escorted to Magdalen, where he held his Court, and 
was entertained, perhaps a little heavily, by speeches and dis- 
putations from noblemen’s sons. The King’s stay was made the 
occasion for conferring complimentary degrees. Lennox and 
Northumberland, Oxford and Pembroke, Cranborne and North- | 
ampton were among the new Masters of Arts. Disputations at 
St. Mary’s, which gave the King admirable opportunities of 
displaying knowledge, were again the chief attraction. But 
the Colleges received a larger share of Royal notice than 
before. 
Sir Isaac Wake, the Public Orator, afterwards described in 
Latin of elaborate discursiveness the story of those four full 
days; and James must have heard a good deal of bad history 
if Wake accompanied him upon his tour. The first evening 
closed with the performance at Christ Church of a comedy or 
pastoral, which the King apparently required persuasion to sit 
out, and in which actors almost naked were introduced, to the 
1 Outside the city, near Aristotle’s well. The Mayor tried to antici- 
pate them, but was compelled to retire. 
2 “ Tres adolescentes concinno Sibyllarum habitu induti,”” says Wake 
(Rex Platonicus, 6th ed., 30). Nixon in Oxford’s Triumph speaks of “‘ three 
little Boyes comming foorth of a Castle of Iuie drest like three Nimphes.”’ 
Gwinne appended an account of this interlude to his Vertumnus. See also 
the notes in Nichols’ Progresses of James the First (I, 543-5). Wood’s 
brief account of James’ visit (Ann. II, 285-7) is based on Wake’s, I have 
followed in the main Philip Stringer’s account printed in Nichols’ Pro- 
gresses (I, 530-562), but it is rather bitter and critical in tone. See also

disgust of the Queen.t On the Wednesday morning the King 
was at St. Mary’s soon after nine o’clock, ready to devote himself 
to the discussion of theses in Divinity—the power of Saints and 
angels to know the hearts of men, and the duty of pastors to 
visit those infected by the plague. Dr. George Abbot, Master of 
University, acted as Moderator. Dr. Holland, Rector of Exeter, 
and Dr. Airay, Provost of Queen’s, were among the Opponents 
chosen. After dinner disputations followed from two to five 
on points of Civil Law. Gentilis was Moderator, and the King 
several times interposed in excellent Latin amid great applause. 
That night another Latin play was acted, Ajax Flagellifer, 
built upon the Sophoclean tragedy, and prepared originally for 
Elizabeth’s visit to Cambridge in 1564. One observer says 
that it was performed by Magdalen men.* But it seems again 
to have exhausted the King’s patience. James was tired, and 
it may be that he made too little effort to disguise the weariness 
he felt. 
Next day, Thursday, there were more disputations at St. 
Mary’s. The Medical men had an opening, and the merits 
or demerits of tobacco proved an entertaining theme. The 
King, as all the world knew, had written on the subject. Dr. 
Warner moderated, and Dr. Gwinne took part. Sir William 
Paddy, ‘‘ a great drinker of tobacco,” delighted James by arguing 
against it. A pipe was produced and the King was very merry ; 
so much so that, after dining with the Chancellor at New Col- 
lege, he hurried back to St. Mary’s to debate again. Buckhurst, 
now created Earl of Dorset, not only feasted the King at New 
College, where he kept open house. He sent a buck and twenty 
shillings for wine to every College, so that the scholars of other 
1 According to Stringer’s account (Nichols’, I, 547-8) this play was 
called Alba. Twyne gives it no name. (See also Boas, Camb. Hist. of 
Eng. Lit. VI, Ch. XII). Nixon speaks only of a Latin comedy. Wake 
(Rex Plat. 78) calls the piece Vertumnus and describes it in detail; and 
Wood accepts this, distinguishing the piece from Gwinne’s Vertumnus 
or Annus Recurrens, played on the third night. He adds that Gwinne’s 
play was acted at St. John’s College, which is evidently a mistake. Wake’s 
description does not correspond with Gwinne’s play, and he ought to have 
known the facts. Yet it seems very improbable that two plays called 
Vertumnus were acted. In Part III of the Malone Society’s Collections 
Dr. Boas has printed (pp. 246-59) lists from the University Archives of 
the properties hired for the Oxford plays, But such facts as we can gather 
from these lists of the characters appearing in the first night’s play do not 
seem to bear out Wake’s description. Stringer is the only—but perhaps 
a sufficient—authority for James’ ungracious behaviour. On the shifting 
scenery which Inigo Jones is said to have provided see Blomfield (Renais- 
sance Architecture, 99).

houses might “‘ thankefully frolicke it’ too, The afternoon was 
passed in discussing Natural and Moral Philosophy. The King 
held forth with admirable learning, especially on the possibility 
of chemistry producing gold, and the Proctors had to cut the 
other speakers short. James wound up the day by promising 
the University his favour, and by urging his hearers to persevere 
in their pursuit of knowledge and to avoid Romish superstitions 
and new schisms alike. 
That night a company of St. John’s men played Vertwmnus, 
but the King, exhausted with his efforts, fell asleep. Gwinne’s 
play was good, and Inigo Jones—“ one Mr. Jones, a great travel- 
ler ’—helped with the scenery of all these plays. But the 
only really successful stage performance was the English play, 
The Queenes Arcadia by Samuel Daniel, given on the Friday 
morning before the Royal party left It was the first English 
pastoral written for the academic stage. The Queen and Prince 
and their retinue attended. The audience came to it unwearied, 
and we are told that it ‘‘ made amends for all.” But the King 
in the meantime was visiting the Bodleian, and the nobles at 
St. Mary’s were receiving their degrees? That last morning 
must have been a busy time. In the newly-restored Library 
James found plenty to discourse on. If he were a prisoner, 
he protested, he would choose it for his prison and be chained 
with the good authors there. He was then shown the Divinity 
School. He visited Brasenose, heard an oration, and studied the 
famous nose above the gate. He passed to All Souls, where 
another oration welcomed him, and on to Magdalen, where 
he had to listen to a third. At Magdalen, it would appear, he 
spent more time. A fourth oration awaited his return to 
Christ Church, and a fifth was delivered “ with good audacity ”’ 
as he prepared to go. He drove away quietly to Magdalen 
Bridge, with a small escort of townsmen. But he bade the 
academic authorities trouble themselves no more, and to the 
disappointment of the students he paid no attention to the 
verses hung out in High Street on the College walls. James, 
no doubt, carried away agreeable recollections of his visit. But 
incidentally it seems to have made drinking more than ever 
the fashion in Oxford. Moralists noted that on the minds 
1 See Boas (Camb. Hist. of Eng. Lit, VI, 317, and Malone Collections, 
Pt. III, 249) and Daniel’s published play. But it is, I think, clear that it 
was acted in the morning, not at night, 
2 James would not allow Prince Henry to be made an M.A. He was 
too young. 
3 For the brief visits to the Colleges compare Stringer’s account with 
Nixon’s and Wake’s. Stringer’s seems to be the clearest. Nixon dwells 
most on the visit to Magdalen.  
-P-A-G-E-280
  234 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
of the students the Court left ‘‘ impressions of debauchery ” 
behind. 
Prince Henry, a boy of eleven, had won all hearts at Magdalen 
by his bearing. His spirit, says the annalist, so full of life and 
splendour, made him the people’s darling and delight. His 
death in 1612 was followed by a genuine outpouring of affection, 
and both Universities broke into elegies on their loss.1_ Before 
that year was over his brother-in-law, the ill-starred Elector 
Palatine, visited Oxford and was entered on the Christ Church 
books,? and in 1616 Prince Charles came, honourably attended, 
entered himself also as a member of the University and was 
taken round and fitly entertained. Charles’ first visit to the 
beautiful city destined to be so closely linked with his mis- 
fortunes, made apparently no such impression as his brother’s. 
The tragic loyalties which were to gather round him were still 
far away. But a few years later, when the threat of a Spanish 
Marriage began to stir the indignation of the country, Oxford 
preachers and versifiers were not backward to show their interest 
in the Prince. The arrival of Charles and Buckingham at Madrid 
demanded an official thanksgiving at St. Mary’s. But their 
return to England with the marriage unaccomplished called 
forth a much more genuine expression of joy. Oxford made 
holiday. In London streets the bonfires blazed and tables were 
spread freely. ‘‘ When I shall come out of Egypt, and the House 
of Jacob from amongst the barbarous people,” were the words 
of the anthem chanted at St. Paul’s.3 
James had little respect for academic opinions on matters of 
high policy when they differed from his own. But on ecclesi- 
astical questions he was ready to listen, and still readier to reply, 
to University divines. He took a delight in theological con- 
troversy. His reading and his powers of argument were not 
to be despised. He sometimes professed himself a Calvinist. 
He was ready at the beginning of his reign to listen to Puritan 
petitions, to discuss toleration, the removal of ecclesiastical 
abuses and the better distribution of Church funds. At first 
Whitgift and the Anglican divines felt some anxiety. There 
was talk of a “Scotch mist’ overspreading the Kingdom, on 
1 For a fullaccount of the Prince’s death, and of the publications which 
followed it, see Nichols (Prog. of Jas. I, II, 469-512). Among the remedies 
tried in his illness was a cordial or “‘ quintessence ”’ sent by Sir W. Ralegh. 
From a careful examination of the symptoms recorded Sir N. Moore 
concludes that he died of typhoid (The Iliness and Death of Henry Prince 
of Wales in 1612). 
2 The Elector’s marriage, like Prince Henry’s death, was hailed with 
an outpouring of academic verse.

the setting of Elizabeth, “that bright occidental star.”! But 
these fears soon proved to have little foundation. The petition 
of the thousand Puritan ministers, who asked for the removal 
of offences in the Church, produced protests from both Oxford 
and Cambridge.2 The Hampton Court Conference in January 
1604 gave James opportunities of argument which he thoroughly 
enjoyed, and John Rainolds of Corpus, the chief spokesman of 
the Puritans, had no reason to complain of the Royal reception. 
But, though certain reforms were suggested, the main objects 
of the Puritans failed. James boasted that he had peppered 
them soundly. 
“They fled me so from argument to argument, without ever 
answering me directly, ut est eorum moris, as I was forced at last to 
say unto thaime ; that if any of thaime had been in a college disputing 
with thair scholars, if any of thair disciples had answered them in 
that sort, they would have fetched him up in a place of a reply ; and 
so should the rod have plyed upon the poor boyes buttocks.”’ # 
The Archbishop recognised “‘ the special assistance of God’s spirit ” 
in the speeches of the King. But Whitgift’s strong, stern rule 
was nearly over. Bancroft, his successor, had neither the 
temper nor the breadth required. New canons, passed in spite 
of the protest of the House of Commons, insisted on ecclesiastical 
conformity. Clergymen who could not accept them unreservedly 4 
were driven from their cures. All students proceeding to degrees 
had to swear obedience to the Royal Supremacy, to the Articles, 
to the government and to the liturgies of the Church. The 
surplice was made obligatory on Sundays for all Fellows and 
Scholars in Colleges and Halls. Bancroft had little sympathy 
with compromise or toleration. Any hopes raised by the Hamp- 
ton Court Conference died away. Its most satisfactory outcome 
was the authorised translation of the Bible, in which Rainolds 
took a leading part. Holland and Kilby, the Rectors of Exeter 
and Lincoln, George Abbot of University and Leonard Hutten 
of Christ Church were among the colleagues who gathered round 
Rainolds in his work. 
Rainolds, crippled by illness, died three years after the Con- 
ference, and with his death the strongest spokesman of Puritan

signatories fell far short of 1,000o—were at least partly due to fears for 
College endowments.

views In Oxford passed away. Laurence Humfrey had been 
dead some years, and Frewen was before long to lead the Magdalen 
theologians into other paths. The Anglo-Catholic movement, 
which had found a home at St. John’s, and which was to find 
powerful leaders in two illustrious Heads of that College, was 
steadily gaining ground in the University. But it had not yet 
conquered the sympathies of Oxford men. Fear of the Romanist 
reaction was still powerful in England. The Gunpowder Plot 
produced a decree from Convocation against Recusants.1_ Par- 
liament required an oath of allegiance not from Popish Recu- 
sants only but from all loyal subjects over eighteen, with special 
reference to the Universities and to candidates for degrees.? 
At Oxford still the two Abbots were uncompromising opponents 
alike of Romanist and of high Anglican opinions. When George 
Abbot passed to astonishing preferment, his brother Robert, 
Master of Balliol in 1609 and Professor of Divinity three years 
later, carried the same traditions on. Dr. Airay, Provost of 
Queen’s, shared the views of the two Abbots. Dean Goodwin 
of Christ Church leaned to the same side. Prideaux of Exeter, 
for all his breadth and moderation, was as stout “ against 
Arminius”’ as the rest. Nathaniel Brent, elected Warden of 
Merton in 1622, was relentless in his attitude to Laud’s opinions, 
and Laud was equally unsparing in condemning his. 
It might have puzzled some who inveighed against Arminius 
to explain exactly what his influence on the Church of England 
was. The stern and logical doctrine of absolute Predestination, 
which Calvin inherited from Augustine, had produced a reaction 
among Protestants who could not reconcile its rigidity with their 
conception of the loving providence of God. Arminius,® once a 
pupil of Beza, had been led to question it, and the movement 
named after him had become a movement of inquiry and revolt. 
The rational spirit of the early Reformation, repressed for a 
time by dogma and authority, revived to discuss with every 
resource of polemical theology the teaching of Scripture, the 
Church’s power to interpret it, the distinction between what 
was fundamental and what was less essential in belief. At the 
Synod of Dort in 1618, it is true, the strict Calvinists triumphed. 
The Remonstrants, the disciples of Arminius, appealed in vain 
for an impartial hearing. But their leader’s eloquence greatly

who did not openly conform to the Established Church (Reg. M, 91, and

JACOBEAN OXFORD 2397 
impressed one famous Oxford churchman who was present. 
John Hales at least learned from these discussions how uncharit- 
able sectarian prejudice might be. A change came over his 
opinions, even if he did not, as has been stated, “ bid John 
Calvin good-night.”” For many besides Hales in England 
Arminianism grew into something larger and more important 
than a new heresy or an unwarrantable schism. It became a 
part of the movement against dogmatic Calvinism, a plea for 
moderation and liberality of thought. Thinkers within the 
Church were driven to consider it. The authorities who dreaded 
Puritan aggression found in it an ally. The King saw the friends 
of his prerogative turning with sympathy towards it. As years 
passed James became more and more persuaded that the interests 
of the Crown and of the Bishops were the same. ‘ No Bishop 
no King,”’ became a Royal maxim. Absolutism and Arminianism 
went hand in hand. 
The struggle between the two parties in the Church of England 
had now become the outstanding feature of Oxford life. The 
University pulpit was their battleground, and the sermons 
which they preached at each other had often a vivid personal 
interest. The Tuesday sermons were promoted chiefly by Dr. 
Airay and the Calvinist party. In 1606, when Laud in a sermon 
at St. Mary’s defended the Catholic position of the Church, Dr. 
Airay as Vice-Chancellor called him to account. A great stir 
followed. Laud’s friends intervened and made interest with the 
Chancellor. But the preacher was freely censured in Oxford 
as “‘a busy and pragmatical person,’ who, if not a Papist, was 
“at least very popishly affected.” Many, we are told, made a 
point of avoiding his company or failed to give him the usual 
greetings in the street. Two years later one of the Chaplains of 
Christ Church was suspended for preaching doctrines too much 
favoured by Rome. In 1611 Laud’s election as President of 
St. John’s excited strong protest. The flowing tide perhaps was 
with him, but its strength was not as yet understood. Robert 
Abbot in the University pulpit demanded to know whether 
the new President were Romish or English, Papist or Protestant, 
or “a mongrel compound of both.’’ Any preacher who pre- 
sumed to reflect on the doctrines of Geneva was liable in those 
years to be sharply censured by the authorities in power. 
It was under these conditions that Isaac Casaubon, who had 
abandoned Paris for a refuge in England and had already won 
high favour with the King, paid a visit to Oxford in May 1673. 
Sir Henry Savile drove him over from Eton, with rather 
more display and patronage than Casaubon cared for, and the 
University warmly welcomed so profound a scholar. Casaubon 
had already discovered that the English were by no means a  
-P-A-G-E-284
  238 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
barbarous people, but fond of letters and engrossed in theology.? 
He had found the King tireless in theological discussion and 
surprisingly well-informed. And he now found Oxford absorbed 
in controversies over ecclesiastical questions, compared with 
which all other educational interests, culture or science or classical 
learning, took asecondary place. An active routine of instruction 
there was, ancient formalities, busy officials, and an unmistakable 
interest in the beliefs and passions which divided the nation. 
But the rulers of the University were pre-eminently Church- 
men, and their time and thoughts were largely occupied in 
theological debates. Casaubon was taken to the Divinity School 
to hear the Saturday disputation, saw Robert Abbot presiding 
there and became his friend. He was taken to two sermons on 
Sunday and to dine at the Deanery in between. When Savile 
returned to Eton, Casaubon moved on to Christ Church as the 
Dean’s guest. He enjoyed the hospitality of the Colleges, 
hospitality in which Magdalen took a leading part. He enjoyed 
still more his time in the Bodleian, though there were not yet 
enough Greek manuscripts in it to satisfy his ‘‘ greediness”’ 
for knowledge. After six hours in the Library he would go 
back to the Deanery for a little light reading in Rabbinical 
Hebrew. He made the acquaintance among others of Prideaux, 
who had always a generous welcome for a foreign scholar, and 
ascertained that they had much in common. Prideaux, though 
no Arminian, was, it seems, advancing from the Calvinist posi- 
tion to one more in sympathy with the historical conception of 
the English Church. Casaubon declined an honorary degree, 
but he appreciated the kindness shown him. He thought that 
the wealth of the Colleges might possibly minister to self-conceit. 
Their Heads lived like nobles, ‘‘ splendidly, yea magnificently, 
having an income of ten thousand livres.” He had seen the 
University of Paris, then half-ruined by the Civil Wars. And 
he could not but contrast with it the security, the freedom and 
the stateliness of Oxford, where the students were school-boys 
no longer, and where the Fellows combined the pursuit of learning 
with a spacious life of dignity and ease. 
James’ friendliness for the Universities was genuine. He 
exempted them from subsidies. He transferred to them the 
right of presenting to all benefices in the hands of Popish recu- 
sants.2, He gave them Members of Parliament. The first two 
1 So Grotius in 1613 declared that theologians were “ the reigning 
authorities ’’ in England, and Fra Paolo Sarpi regretted that the King of 
England was becoming a doctor of divinity (see Pattison’s Life of Casau- 
bon, 322, and for Casaubon’s Oxford visit, Ch. 8). 
Every “‘ Popishe Recusant convict ’’ was disabled from presenting

  JACOBEAN OXFORD 239 
chosen for Oxford in 1603 were both Civilians, Sir Daniel Dunn 
of All Souls and Sir Thomas Crompton of Merton. The value of 
the privilege was afterwards questioned on the ground that 
University interests had till then been the care of all University 
men in the House of Commons. But a few years later, when 
Parliament debated whether Oxford or Cambridge should be 
named first in its Acts, the Oxford Burgesses were able to 
secure a majority for their claim.!_ The election of these Bur- 
gesses did not always pass without disturbance. In the elections 
for the Parliament of 1626 the junior members of Convocation 
saw reason to protest against the Vice-Chancellor’s handling of 
the matter.2 They petitioned Parliament on the subject and 
secured a fresh election. Later still, in more tumultuous times, 
Selden, after the death of his colleague the only representative 
of the University in the Long Parliament, was able to render 
no small service to its cause. One result of James’ friendliness 
to Oxford was a valuable Professorial endowment, which followed 
his visit in 1605. He annexed to the Chair of the Regius Pro- 
fessor of Divinity a Canonry of Christ Church and the Parsonage 
of Ewelme, destined to a brief celebrity in years still far away. 
But Royal interest in the University was apt to mean inter- 
ference with its freedom. A Scottish King had Scottish friends 
whom he wished to provide for, and he had also singular views 
in regard to the sanctity of tithe. James proposed in 1603 to 
surrender for the benefit of poor clergy such tithes as he pos- 
sessed, and he invited the University to follow his example. 
But the Archbishop and the Universities received the project 
with such coldness that the King was obliged to abandon his 
scheme. The pulpits were occasionally tuned: preachers were 
made to understand that they must not ventilate theories un- 
palatable to the Crown. Convocation, with the King behind it, 
insisted more and more on ecclesiastical discipline. In March 
Southern counties as far North as Staffordshire. The Act was extended in 
1688. (See Shadwell, Enactments in Parliament, I, 225-6 and 300-3). 
1 On Feb. 26, 1606. The old practice of naming Oxford first, aban- 
doned to some extent under the early Tudors, was generally, though not 
invariably, adopted after this (Shadwell, I, vii). In Jan. 1641 Sir Simon 
D’Ewes revived the claims of Cambridge, but his audacious arguments met 
with no success (Mullinger, III, 209-10). 
2 The Vice-Chancellor put forward a candidate agreeable to the Court 
and declared him elected. The Masters petitioned Parliament and a fresh 
election was ordered (Wood, Ann. II, 356-7). But Wood says nothing of 
any attempt, such as the Heads of Colleges seem to have made at Cam- 
bridge in 1614, to “ nobble”’ the elections (Mullinger, II, 459-60). 
3 “ Where the ordinary benefit of the vicarages doth not suffice, and 
the parsonages are impropriate and in laymen’s hands ”’ (see the King’s 
letter to Oxford, 10 July 1603, in Wilkins, Concilia, IV, 369).

  240 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
1617 Royal edicts demanded a new subscription to the Church’s 
doctrines,+ and greater strictness in enforcing those doctrines 
in sermons and studies, in the pulpits and the Schools. Preach- 
ing and reading were to be more closely regulated. Students of 
divinity were to be “‘ excited to bestowe there time” on the 
Fathers, the Councils and the history of the Church. The 
Vice-Chancellor was to report to the King on the observance of 
these orders.2 They were posted up in Colleges and Halls; 
and they were naturally regarded as a blow to the Calvinist 
party. The star of Laud was rising. Ecclesiasticism was 
gaining ground. Bancroft had laboured steadily to increase the 
influence of the Church Courts. Even Archbishop Abbot may 
have allowed himself to press too far the dangerous jurisdiction 
of the High Commission. 
Discipline in matters of conscience is not always easy to 
achieve. There was more to be said for enforcing it on points 
of academic order. Chancellors like Bancroft, Ellesmere and 
Pembroke * may have felt it their duty to insist on conformity 
in religion. But their admonitions perhaps were more generally © 
accepted when they dwelt on less exalted themes, on the need of 
study, lectures, Latin talk, on the suppression of taverning and 
gaming, on eccentricities in conduct or in dress. Academical 
Habits must not be neglected. Indecent attire must not be 
allowed. Scholars who ought to be examples of decorum must 
not wear their hair longer than their ears: in Queen Elizabeth’s 
time only “ swaggerers and ruffians ’’ did that. Boots and spurs 
in public assemblies had to be prohibited. Boots and gowns 
must not be worn together. Drunkenness was causing scandal. 
Scholars were forbidden to accept lodging or entertainment in 
the city. Ale-houses had increased beyond all former record. 
Young scholars especially were warned against them.4 The 
number of maltsters required to be reduced. Admonitions of 
this kind had their justification. Wood mentions an ugly 
incident at Jesus College in 1614, the killing of one Welshman 
by another, which “‘ put the University to much trouble” in 
1 By the first Edict all men taking degrees had to subscribe both to 
the Thirty-nine Articles and to the Three Articles of 1604 ‘‘ in canonem 
36 redactis.”” For these Edicts see Gibson’s Statutes (521-6). 
* “Every Michaelmas Term, when his Majesty resorts into those 
parts ” (Wood, Annals, II, 323-4 and 326-8). Most of the edicts related 
to ecclesiastical questions, but one dealt with dress, and one with the 
haunting of houses in the city by scholars, especially at night.

claiming its right to try the offender.1 There was an acute 
crisis over the wearing of caps. Some of the Regent Masters 
objected to having to sit bare-headed like boys in Convocation 
House, especially after their attention had been drawn to a 
window at St. Mary’s, which represented Masters as sitting 
covered in the Chancellor’s presence. Henry Wightwicke of 
Gloucester Hall took the lead in this revolutionary movement, 
boldly clapt on his cap at a sitting, and even organised a petition 
on the subject. The authorities gravely condemned him for 
trying to subvert ‘‘ the Honour and Government of the Univer- 
sity.” Wightwicke was banished and reduced to submission : 
he lived to be Master of Pembroke College. But a few years 
later the constitutional. problem was revived. Gilbert Sheldon, 
of All Souls, was among the Masters who signed a fresh petition. 
Prideaux, as Vice-Chancellor, treated the matter with wise 
moderation. The Chancellor now saw no reason to resist. 
And the precious privilege of wearing caps in Convocation, 
provided only that the caps were square, was conceded in 1620 
to all Masters for the future.? 
Legislation continued from time to time to confirm or modify 
the Statutes. A fresh decree enforced the old disputations in 
the parvise, now “much more carelessly kept than in days 
gone by.” ? Improper canvassing for the election of Proctors 
was sharply checked. A new Statute revised and supplemented 
the scale of fees.6 The Vice-Chancellor was required to render 
a yearly account of the receipts and expenditure for the New 
Schools. Appeals were regulated. Weekly meetings of the 
Heads of Houses were arranged.? The Proctorial elections led 
to serious controversy. Canvassing and treating had grown into 
an abuse. “He that could give the greatest entertainment, 
was the Proctor against all the world.”” Even in the election 
of Collectors entertainments were given, and we hear of candi- 
dates and electors, ‘‘ warmed with high liquors,” setting fire 
to acres of furze on Bullingdon Green. In the Proctorial elections 
it seems that certain Colleges combined to carry their candidates 
against the rest, and that the weaker side tried to call in non- 
resident voters: In 1628 a Statute confined the suffrage to 
those who had been in residence for a hundred days before the 
election. The Chancellor-ordered this rule to be applied. The

  242 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Proctors challenged the decision, and a violent dispute ensued- 
The King bade the Chancellor ‘“‘calme the Tempest.” An 
election was held, which produced charges of foul play. Mr. 
Hyde, the senior Scrutator, gave “a great screake as he was 
sitting down in his chair,” and fell down dead to the astonish- 
ment of all present. But the Masters, happily, “ got life into 
him again.” The Vice-Chancellor dissolved the Convocation. 
An appeal was made to the King. Two controversialists, accused 
of underhand dealings and of striking a Master, were committed 
to the Fleet. The Crown appointed new Proctors, and on 
Laud’s advice the whole system was altered and reformed. 
The claims of the different Colleges, and the right of their mem- 
bers to vote, were defined. But the old democratic theory that 
the Proctors were the representatives of the whole body of 
Masters disappeared. The cycle invented by Peter Turner of 
Merton, recommended by Laud and sanctioned by the King, 
provided that all the Colleges should have their turn in nomin- 
ating Proctors within the compass of twenty-three years. 
“Christ Church was to enjoy 6 Proctors, Magdalen College 5, 
New College 4, Merton, All Souls, Exeter, Brasenose, St. John’s and 
Wadham Colleges three apiece, Trinity, Queens, Oriel and Corp. 
Ch. Coll. only two. The rest, as Universitie, Baliol, Lincoln, Jesus 
and Pembroke Colleges but only one.” # 
Other troubles requiring regulation arose from the old rivalry 
between University and Town. The City Bailiffs who, without 
leave from the Vice-Chancellor, had presumed to search the 
streets at night for felons, were condemned and fined on leaving 
office as Noctivagators and Perturbers of the peace.? When 
they rebelled they were sent to prison. The King’s Bench 
supported the University and the citizens had to submit. The 
City retorted by imprisoning certain privileged persons, but the 
Vice-Chancellor discommoned the leaders of the movement, 
and that powerful weapon brought them to account. In 1611 
Convocation found the citizens high and insolent in regard to 
the Night Watch. A sharp quarrel followed. Certain traders 
were discommoned, and the Recorder in particular was registered 
as the most pestilent enemy the University possessed. At 
length the Privy Council intervened, and decided, as usual, in 
the University’s favour. The discommoned offenders made 
their peace, but the Recorder was driven to retire to Henley

for the remainder of his days. In 1616 an opportunity for 
co-operation offered. The waters of the springs above North 
Hinksey were collected and brought in a conduit to Carfax, to 
supply the citizens and the University alike. In 1618 the citizens 
tried to secure a new charter from the Crown,! hoping to escape 
to some extent from University control. But the project, it 
seems, fell through. Pembroke, warned perhaps by Bacon, 
sent down the draft for the advisers of the University to see, 
and gave them an opportunity of pointing out how it infringed 
their rights. 
Another cause of dispute was the increase of cottages within 
the University precincts. It was attributed by academic critics 
to the “intolerable avarice” of the citizens. But it was due 
more probably to the pressure of a housing problem which even 
the seventeenth century could not escape. Complaints that a 
hundred and fifty new cottages had been erected in the fifty 
years preceding 1612, that foreigners and other rascals came 
to lodge there, to “shark upon young scholars,’ to plunder 
the King’s forests, to be a charge on College charities, may or 
may not have been as serious as the complainants thought. 
There was perhaps more substance in the contention that these 
lodgers—though there is no evidence of overcrowding—increased 
the possibility of plague. The Lords of the Council in their 
wisdom decided that the matter called for reform. After the 
serious outbreak of plague in 1625 the increase of cottages was 
in principle condemned. But building inevitably went on. 
Wood speaks of a hundred and seventy-nine cottages being 
erected between 1620 and 1640. The practice of erecting houses 
that were wanted was due to causes which no University could 
control. 
Meanwhile the number of undergraduates was rising, and 
their standing was perhaps rather higher than before.2 But 
the number of Papists, ‘‘ or at least the lovers of them,” gave 
no cause for alarm. Two new Colleges were founded, the last 
new foundations for nearly a hundred years. The rights and 
possessions of old Colleges like Oriel and Corpus were confirmed. 
The influence of the Colleges became more than ever the pre- 
ponderating influence in Oxford life. Between 1603 and 162r 
1 Already in 1605 James had granted the City a charter. But in this 
the University’s rights were expressly preserved. (See Ogle, Royal 
Letters, 228-48). 
2 See Clark (Reg. II, ii, 410 and 414). The eighteen years from 1604 
to 1621, as compared with the eighteen years from 1585 to 1602, show 
substantial increases in Matriculations and Determinations, and even in 
the number of new-comers entered as “‘ fil. equitis.”” Wood puts the total 
number of students in 1611 above 2,420 (Ann. II, 307).   
 
-P-A-G-E-290
244 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
it seems that matriculations were most numerous at Brasenose 
and Exeter, at Queen’s and Magdalen Hall.1 New Professor- 
ships were established. In 1619 Sir Henry Savile, finding mathe- 
matical studies neglected, founded the Professorships in Geometry 
and Astronomy which bear his name.? The holders might be 
drawn from any Christian nation, provided they had drunk 
deep of the founts of Aristotle and Plato, had been thoroughly 
instructed in mathematics, and had acquired a little knowledge 
of Greek. Copernicus appears among the authors to be studied— 
a lonely modern figure in a list which included Euclid and 
Archimedes, Theodosius and Ptolemy, Proclus and Geber, the 
latest of whom had died eight or nine centuries before. The 
gift was all the more valuable in days when the tradition still 
survived that ‘“‘ the most useful Branches of Mathematicks were 
spels, and her Professors limbs of the Devil.’’ Savile also gave 
a Mathematical Library for the use of his Readers, and con- 
tributed a hundred pounds to a Mathematical Chest. He gave 
books and manuscripts to the Bodleian and money for building 
the new Schools. Despite the foibles which rendered his patron- 
age irksome to Casaubon and the pedantry which cropped up 
in his letters,¢ there is no doubt that Savile, with his wealth and 
reputation, played a great part in University life. He enjoyed 
the favour of Elizabeth. As a friend of Essex he was acceptable 
to James. As Warden of Merton and Provost of Eton he had 
no small influence in the world of education. And his trans- 
lations from Tacitus and his great edition of St. Chrysostom 
were examples of a learning which won wide respect. 
Savile’s new Professorship did not stand alone. Sir William 
Sedley had already left money for a Lecture on Natural Philoso- 
phy,’ and in 1621 Dr.~Thomas White of London established 
one in Moral Philosophy too.* William Camden, who in his 
life and labours at Westminster had never forgotten his debt 
to Oxford, founded in 1622 a Professorship of History, with a 
stipend of a hundred and forty pounds a year.? Camden’s

College were apparently less in demand. Balliol and Trinity kept up 
well. But the figures are not complete.

great friend William Heather followed this up by a Professorship 
of Music. There was to bea Music Master, “ to plaie and exercise 
Musick with twoe boyes in his companie,” with a salary of 
thirteen pounds, six shillings and eightpence, and an annual 
lecture on musical theory for which three pounds was set aside.1 
But the degrees in music continued to be very few.? In 1624 
Richard Tomlins ‘of the Citty of Westminster” founded a 
Lectureship in Anatomy, to be held by the Professor of Physic, 
the directions for which are delightfully detailed. The body of 
an executed person, if possible, immediately after the Lent 
Assizes, was to be prepared and dissected by a “ skilfull Chirur- 
gian.” The Reader was to stand by and lecture on the subject, 
explaining the situation and the office of the Natural, Vital and 
Animal parts. In the Michaelmas term he was to ‘‘ reade the 
Sceleton or History of the bones.” All physic students and 
chirurgians in the University were expected to attend.’ Science 
was very slowly making way. A “ Garden for Physical Simples ” 
was demanded. Lord Danvers, afterwards Earl of Danby, 
came forward with a welcome gift. A site was leased from 
Magdalen, the old Jews’ cemetery beside the Cherwell. On 
St. James’ day 1621 the Vice-Chancellor laid the foundation 
stone. Danby laid out the grounds, secured a gardener, set 
up the “‘ comely Gate-house ” in 1632.5 He intended, it seems, 
to endow botanical lectures, but these had to wait till after the 
Restoration. In the days of King James degrees in medicine 
were a little more numerous than degrees in music. But the 
practice of medicine still lagged behind the theory, and licenses 
to practise surgery were rare.® 
Meanwhile the University Press still held its own. Without 
endowment but not without encouragement it continued the 
business which Leicester’s patronage had revived.? Joseph

Organist (Gibson, 555).

  246 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Barnes, equipped in 1585 with a loan of a hundred pounds from 
the authorities, established himself close beside St. Mary’s. He 
was the sole University printer until 1617. He issued the first 
catalogue of the Bodleian in 1605. He printed Brian Twyne’s 
Apologia or history of the University in 1608. He published 
books in Greek and Hebrew, in Latin, in Welsh, and even in 
Spanish. But a Spanish Grammar by Corrano, issued just 
before the days of the Armada, had to be provided with a forged 
imprint, as if it came from Paris.1 He made the little venture 
a success, and later printers, among whom the Lichfields were 
the most conspicuous, carried on its traditions for a century 
and more.2 Laud’s influence secured in 1632 Letters Patent 
for the University Press, and in 1636 a Royal Charter extending 
its rights still further. With the outbreak of the War and the 
King’s establishment at Oxford political propaganda sent its 
output bounding up. But Fairfax had some reason to distrust 
the political sympathies of the Oxford printers, and after the 
surrender of the city to the Parliament the fortunes of the Press 
fell to their lowest point. 
The Laudian Code did not take shape till James’ reign was 
over. But questions of Statute reform became daily more 
pressing as the years went on. Questions of politics also from 
time to time threw their shadow over the University. Ecclesi- 
astical politicians, like Abbot, Laud and Williams, all had their 
friends and their supporters there. The cause of the Prince 
Palatine was dear to the hearts of the Protestants. The Spanish 
Match was bitterly unpopular. Problems even of domestic 
controversy, of the Royal prerogative and its limitations, found 
an echo in Oxford pulpits. In 1622, when a rash young preacher, 
William Knight of Broadgates Hall, developing the views of 
the eminent German Professor Paraeus,? ventured. to justify 
resistance to the Sovereign in extreme cases of tyranny and 
wrong, he was sent to gaol by the Vice-Chancellor and brought 
down on himself the anger of the King. James commanded 
that the Heads of Colleges should be assembled and reminded 
1 But Mr. Gibson tells me that an issue of Corrano with an Oxford 
imprint is known. 
2 John Lichfield and William Wrench took over Barnes’ work in 1617. 
Other University printers were appointed from time to time in the seven- 
teenth century, but the Lichfields continued printing in Oxford till 1749 
(Ib. Ch. Il). 
3 Paraeus (David Wangler) appointed Professor of Divinity at Heidel- 
berg in 1598, an eminent Calvinist divine, had raised the question, in his 
Commentary on the Romans (Ch. xiii, 1), whether resistance to the civil 
ruler were justifiable or not. (See Mullinger, II, 562 sq., and the Life 
and Works of Paraeus edited by his son.) The censured propositions are 
printed by Wood (Ann. II, 345-6) and by Mr, Gibson (545-7).

of the books which theologians ought to study. The end of 
their reading was to “ preach Christ crucified,” and not to 
meddle with affairs of State. The Privy Council ordered the 
works of Paraeus to be burned. Convocation solemnly repudiated 
all ideas of resisting Princes by force of arms. Knight, confined 
for nearly two years in the gate-house at Westminster, died 
prematurely. Prideaux’ good sense would have treated ‘‘ hott 
headed young fellows’’ more lightly,1 but Prideaux’ temper 
was unhappily too rare. In 1625 Montagu’s challenging book 
Appello Cesarem stirred angry feelings in the University, and 
Prideaux again appealed for caution and moderation. The 
plague drove Parliament to Oxford. Colleges and Halls had 
to be “ freed”’ from Fellows and students, to provide accommo- 
dation. Christ Church was put at the disposal of the Council. 
The Commons sat in the Divinity School, and carried away 
from it, some thought, the impression that the settlement of 
all questions of theology belonged to them. In 1629 the Speaker 
called on the University for a return of all persons who had 
contravened the Articles of Religion. In the same year Charles 
and his Queen visited Oxford. They viewed Wadham College 
and the Public Library. They were given a banquet at Merton. 
The King apparently encouraged a proposal to pull down what 
remained of Cat Street between St. Mary’s and the Schools, 
and to erect more new buildings for the University there.? 
Next year Lord Pembroke suddenly died and opened the way 
for Laud’s accession to the Chancellorship. The King’s chief 
adviser became supreme in Oxford, and an era of strenuous, 
high-minded discipline, as confident of its good intentions as it 
was exasperating in its methods, began for the nation and for 
the University alike. 
1 See Wood MS.D. 18 (quoted by Macleane, History of Pembroke, 
142-4). In 1609, it seems, Edmund Campion of Trinity was censured for 
the same error ; and Edward Hurd of Corpus, who spoke out boldly like 
Knight afterwards, was forced to recant (Wood, Amn. II, 348).

CHAPTER XVI 
THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY COLLEGES AND HALLS 
HILE Bodley was building his immortal monument, 
another notable West Countryman, bred like him in 
the great traditions of Elizabethan days, founded one 
of the most perfect of Oxford Colleges to perpetuate his name. 
Nicholas Wadham, of Merifield near Ilminster—a house so 
hospitable that visitors accounted it ‘an Inn at all times, a 
court at Christmas’”—came of a distinguished stock. His 
family had for generations accumulated properties in Devon- 
shire, Somerset and other counties of the West. Descended 
from the Plantagenets, connected with the Seymours, son-in- 
law to Sir William Petre, the veteran statesman who had recently 
endowed Exeter afresh, himself very probably educated at Corpus,? 
a splendid gentleman, yet wise enough and rich enough to lay 
by money which he could dispose of as he wished, Nicholas 
Wadham determined in his childless old age to build for himself 
a memorial at Oxford which should last ‘‘ from generation to 
generation.”” The note of his intentions, dictated, it may be, 
to one of his nephews just before his death,? shows that he had 
thought of incorporating Gloucester Hall or Jesus College in his 
new foundation, and that he had planned his Statutes in one 
or two points on original lines. While the Head of the House 
and the Fellows were to be forbidden to marry, they were not 
to be compelled to take Orders or to be tied to any profession. 
Every man was to be left “free to profess what he liked as 
it should please God to direct him.” But after “a competente 
number of yeares ”’ they were to go into the world, so that others 
might grow up under them and be nourished and trained to 
learning. A present was designed to secure the Lord Treasurer’s 
favour. A “white and pied nagge,’’ which its owner valued, 
was to be given to Prince Henry with the same design. And 
the Bishop of Bath and Wells, a Somersetshire magnate, was 
1 This is not certain, but Corpus seems more likely than Christ Church, 
though Wadham’s name is not found in the register of either College. 
See Sir T. G. Jackson’s Wadham College (6), Ingram’s Memorials (II, 
Wadham, 3) and Fowler’s History of Corpus (101-2). 
2 See the Warden’s history (Wadham College by J. Wells, 4) and Jack- 
son (Wad. Coll. 12-14). But the book of Warden’s MSS., which con- 
tained this and other records, has unhappily disappeared.

suggested as Visitor of the new College. A few days after 
issuing these instructions Nicholas Wadham died, at the age of 
seventy-seven. He was buried with magnificence in Ilminster 
Church. And his widow Dorothy who, though only two years 
younger, was destined to survive for nearly nine years more, 
lost no time in carrying her husband’s wishes out. 
The trust for the establishment of the College was apparently 
constituted in July 1610, and in the same year, on the 2oth 
December, “our most Serene Lord James, by the Grace of 
God King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,” gave his 
license for the new foundation. But the building had already 
begun. The proposal to incorporate Gloucester Hall fell through : 
the Principal insisted on retaining his Headship. The proposal 
to incorporate Jesus, if ever made, came to nothing. But 
just outside Smith Gate there lay the old home of the Augus- 
tinian Convent, stripped of its great church, its refectory and 
all its buildings, and represented only by small tenements 
and gardens which had come into the possession of the city 
of Oxford. For this site the citizens asked a thousand pounds. 
But Royal influence was brought to bear. Six hundred pounds 
was offered and accepted. The city, which “thought it too 
litle ’’ a price, was allowed to nominate one Fellow and two 
Scholars on the foundation, and in March 1610 the agreement 
was carried through. In April workmen were engaged. In 
May the haulage of stone began. In July the first purchase of 
oaks in Cumnor Wood was recorded. On the 31st July 1610 
the first stone was laid in the presence of the Vice-Chancellor, 
the Proctors and others, who went in procession from St. Mary’s 
Church and met the Mayor of Oxford on the site. A Te Deum was 
sung. The Warden of New College made “ an elegant oration.” 
Six pounds, seven shillings and tenpence were expended in 
music and wine, beer, ‘‘ bisket ’’ and cakes. 
1 It is difficult to credit Wood’s story (Colleges, 592) that Wadham and 
his wife once contemplated the establishment of a Roman Catholic College 
at Venice. But see the interesting suggestion made in the history of 
Worcester College (100-1). There is no evidence that Wadham had 
Romanist sympathies. Dorothy Wadham was suspected of them: in 
1613 arms were seized in her house, and two years later she received a 
pardon. But she founded a Church of England College and was buried 
in Ilminster Church. (See Jackson, Wad. Coll. 87-8). 
2 If Agas’ map is reliable, nearly all the ground was vacant. Sir T. 
Jackson thinks that not a stone of the Friary remains. See the details 
and the admirable plan which he gives (Wad. Coli. Chap. I). Mr. H. 
Hurst (Oxf. Topography, 131) thinks that the Friary buildings may have 
occupied much of the College site : but his reference to the Friars’ ‘‘ Chapel ” 
seems inadequate if we accept Sir T. Jackson’s account of the great Friars’ 
Church, and William of Worcester’s details (Itinerarium, ed. Nasmith, 
297).

    250 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
A folio volume in the College archives preserves the building 
accounts from the beginning. No College in Oxford has been 
so little altered. It stands in essentials as its builders left it, 
perfect and complete; and the record of their activities, of the 
materials they used, and of the rewards they merited—‘‘ Item 
gave them x11‘ in beare when I agreed with them ’’—can be 
read in all its picturesque detail to-day. Burford stone and 
Cumnor timber—oaks felled at sixpence or eightpence apiece 
—were brought by water to Hithe Bridge,1 and hauled over 
Broken Hays, where as yet no road or lane existed. Other 
stone was fetched from Eynsham, or carted down from the 
quarries at Headington or Shotover. Somersetshire sent up 
workmen and even teams of oxen to assist: A Somersetshire 
church supplied a model for the fine Chapel screen. A Somerset- 
shire man, John Arnold, Mrs. Wadham’s steward, probably con- 
trolled the operations. And another Arnold, William, perhaps 
a connection whose skill the steward knew, seems to have been 
largely responsible for the building, architect, master-mason and 
clerk of works in one.2 The new quadrangle rose quickly. 
The chambers on three sides of it, North and South and West, 
took precedence of the Hall and Chapel on the East. The 
kitchen, reversing the Christ Church tradition, was dealt with 
last of all. In June 1612 the chambers were finished. Next 
month the roof of the Chapel and Hall were begun. By the 
end of that year, it seems, the Cloister and the kitchen vault 
were ready, and the joiners and carvers were busy in the Choir. 
In March 1613 the statues were set up over the Hall entrance. 
On the 2oth April the Warden, Fellows and Scholars were ad- 
mitted, though carpenters and plasterers, painters and glaziers 
were still hard at work. On the 2gth the Chapel was consecrated 
by the Bishop of Oxford, and the opportunity was taken for a 
memorable feast, at which the leading members of the University, 
no doubt, assisted, and which cost the new Society no less than 
eighty-three pounds.® 
The buildings so quickly completed were as graceful in 
1 Otherwise High Bridge, at the end of George Street. 
* This is Sir T. Jackson’s conclusion, and his examination of the 
Building Accounts (Wad. Coll. Chaps. II, III and IV) is of special value. 
These Accounts,:in the College archives, run from April 1610 to July 1613, 
and William Arnold appears there repeatedly as receiving a weekly wage 
of {1, at the head of a list of ‘‘ Layers,” who receive less. Holt appears 
among the carpenters later ; but he could hardly have been responsible 
for the design. The credit for that seems to be due to William Arnold, 
unless John Arnold, the steward, or his mistress, had a larger share in it 
than we know. 
* The total sum spent on the buildings is put at £11,360 “‘ in the begin- 
ning of 1613.” (Wood, Collis. 599, n.) :

execution as they were happy in design. The Classical impulse 
could not be resisted, and Classic decorations mingled happily 
enough at Wadham with the older style. But even in the days 
of Inigo Jones seventeenth-century Oxford clung to its architec- 
tural traditions, and the new College in its fine simplicity preserved 
the Gothic spirit and the medieval type.t_ The ground bought 
by Mrs. Wadham stretched from Holywell Street Northwards 
to the line where the Fellows’ Garden was to end. Along Holy- 
well the land was let in narrow strips to various tenants; all 
the land not needed for the College was immediately let off 
again. North of these holdings in 1610 a butcher held the 
vacant land on which the College was built, and a gardener 
rented the “ grove’”’ of two acres beyond.? The main quadrangle 
was set back from the lane which bordered the territory of 
Trinity and St. John’s,’ and here perhaps the old wall of the 
Friary acted as a boundary still. In Loggan’s print some sixty 
years later a gateway on the lane gives access to a small court- 
yard enclosed by walls, and on either side of this are little narrow 
gardens, dedicated at one time to the Warden and the Fellows. 
Beyond this court rose the West front of the College, with its 
gate in the centre and its tower. Chambers, three storeys high 
with attics over them—styled ground chamber, middle chamber, 
upper chamber, cock-loft—ran round three sides of the main 
quadrangle, but no attic windows were allowed to overlook it. 
Hall and Chapel lay together on the East side, but the Ante- 
Chapel only was continuous with the Hall. Beyond it the 
Chapel projected Eastwards at right angles, as the kitchen 
projected further to the South. These two projections, joined 
by the Cloister, formed the beginnings of a new quadrangle 
and enclosed the little grave-yard of the College. 
The chambers with the studies attached to them followed the 
old pattern. But they were unusually spacious: in all the 
buildings there was a certain nobility of scale. Each Fellow 
1 “ The five orders might be piled up one above another, and figures 
or busts in Roman costume placed in round-headed niches, but the mul- 
lioned lights, four-centred doorways, high pitched roofs and numerous 
gables proclaimed the buildings to be Gothic works, in spite of all apparent 
contradiction.”” Yet Wadham “‘ inclines towards the Classic side of the 
English Renaissance more decidedly than the Schools quadrangle.” 
(Jackson, Wad. Coll. 2 and 126). See also Blomfield (Renaissance Archi- 
tecture, 144-6). 
2 The rental of the whole property was £27.14.4. The garden land 
further North was not added till the 18th century. 
% There was no open road here till 1871, and the rights of Wadham 
extended up to the garden wall of Trinity. 
« Sir T. Jackson thinks that most of the chambers had ‘“‘ three studies 
apiece, two across the far end of the room and one under the stairs” (Wad. 
Coll. 134).

hadaseparateroom. Three Scholars shared a bedroom together. 
The space allotted for Commoners and battelers probably 
varied according to their means. The Foundress provided 
in part at any rate the original furniture: the Bursars had to 
see that it was preserved or made good. The walls were 
probably plastered—all partition walls between the stair-cases 
were plastered timber—and hangings and paintings and occa- 
sionally panelling? may have added to their warmth. There 
are accounts of the chambers and their occupants from 1621 
in the College archives, and a plan of them made by Bursar Lee 
in 1653.8. The Fellows generally preferred to live upon the 
second floor, and sometimes rented for a small sum the garrets 
overhead, which, so long as “‘ Chumming was in fashion,’”’ were 
not required by the members of the College. Windows facing 
the quadrangle and fire-places were needed to make the cock- 
lofts habitable in a later day.4 Some of the ground-floor rooms 
were probably occupied at first by College servants. On the 
top floor of the tower was the College Treasury, with three locks 
to its door and three locks to its chests, where the Statutes 
signed by the Foundress, the seal and charters and muniments 
were kept.5 The great chamber below it with an oriel window 
at each end, “and other seven chambers lying nearest on the 
north side,” ® were allotted to the Warden, who being by rule 
a Bachelor was allowed to let off what he did not require. Before 
the Civil War began, however, he had surrendered the tower 
chamber: It became known as the Astronomy Chamber and 
was occupied by Seth Ward and Christopher Wren. Before 
Charles II’s reign was over, the Warden had abandoned his 
original quarters, and had settled entirely in the North-west 
corner, where he lives to-day. 
Across the gravel of the main quadrangle—the fine turf 
dates from a much later time—the Hall entrance was conspicu- 
ous facing West. Its decorated facade of the four orders, Doric, 
Ionic, Corinthian and Composite, recalled the similar work 
just done at Merton and very soon to be repeated in the tower

2 The manciple’s chamber was 
inventory of 1628 (Jackson, 151). 
3 This is reproduced by Sir T. Jackson (Wad. Coll. 135). 
“ One fire-place, however, was built in a cock-loft as early as 1636. 
Windows towards the quadrangle were added in and after 1781 (Ib. 
138-9). 
5 The plate in the Bursar’s chest was to be kept in the Bursary unless 
the authorities thought the Treasury a better place (Stats. cap. 21).

of the new Schools. Niches and statues rose over the doorway, 
the Founder and Foundress, with King James above them, 
surmounted by the Royal arms. But even here the Gothic 
tradition mingled with the Classical details.1 The Hall below 
was one of the largest in Oxford * and perhaps the most finely- 
proportioned of them all. The open timber roof, if rather heavy, 
was a good example of hammer-beam work. A screen of great 
beauty shut off the Buttery passage. The floor was oak till 
stone flagging replaced it,* with vaulted cellars underneath. 
The brazier with the lantern overhead served for a fire-place 
till 1797. The windows, remarkable for William Arnold’s 
tracery, included a large oriel on the East and a great South 
window at the end. Wood describes the painted glass he found 
there, the arms of Wadham, Petre, Strangways, of West country 
families and of West Country Bishops, who acted at times as 
Visitors of the College. Later changes displaced the old glass,* 
cut down the panelling and painted the ceiling between the 
timbers overhead. But no changes have destroyed the dignity 
or the proportions of the stately room. Portraits of seventeenth- 
century worthies—Nicholas Wadham and his wife, Sir John 
Strangways their kinsman, early Wardens with Wilkins con- 
spicuous among them, Blake and Wren and other less celebrated 
figures—appeared in time upon the walls. And the plate which 
shone at College banquets, even after King Charles had carried 
off its early treasures,> displayed, before the century was over, 
no. mean store contributed by Wadham men. 
The Chapel at Wadham followed the plan which William of 
Wykeham had adopted at New College, and which the fifteenth 
century had reproduced at Magdalen and All Souls. - Without 
the pure style of those famous buildings, its picturesque variety 
gave it special charm. A spacious Ante-Chapel, divided into 
aisles by double arches, and lit by windows of curious Jacobean 
tracery,® the work of William Arnold and his men, opened into 
an imposing Choir: A screen enriched with admirable carving   1 It breaks out, says Sir T. Jackson (126), “‘ not only in the doorway, 
which though it has a Classic architrave has a four-centred arch, but in 
the cusped canopy over the King, and in the row of quatrefoiled circles and 
pierced cresting that crowns the composition.”

Hall was wider but not so long.

way later into the windows of the Cloister,

formed the gateway to the inner Chapel.1_ The woodwork was 
probably painted red—seventeenth-century builders did not share 
the modern reverence for oak ; but this was at least preferable 
to the grained and varnished woodwork introduced by restorers 
of a later age. The ceiling above was originally boarded and 
divided in panels intersected by rosettes. After the Restoration 
a floor of black and white marble was laid down, and an altar- 
rail of cedar wood added. The clock of the same date is said 
to have been presented and designed by Wren. The Statutes 
assigned theological disputations to the Chapel and required 
Wardens and Fellows to be elected there. 
The striking windows of the Choir, in style far older than the 
College, have been mistaken even by good judges for fifteenth- 
century work, They were to suffer many changes in the years 
ahead. The ten side windows, given by the Foundress, must 
have glowed with colour from the earliest days. The figures 
on the North side, David and the Prophets, were ill-proportioned 
though effective in design. Mrs. Wadham found reason to 
complain of the artist. ‘‘I would haue you also to end w® 
y” old Glasier,” she wrote to the Warden on the 28th March, 
1614, “that there may be noe more brabbling with him.” ? 
But the figures on the South side, Our Lord and His Apostles,’ 
were admirable work, and the combination of clear glass above 
with the transparent colouring below added a special charm 
of lightness to the Chapel. The great East window depicting 
with splendour the Passion of our Lord, was given by Sir John 
Strangways, one of the Founder’s heirs, and was painted by 
Bernard Van Ling‘ in 1622, at the rate of three shillings and 
fourpence a square foot. The old Jacobean pulpit and the old 
communion-table still survive, though their positions have been 
altered. Isaac Fuller’s drawings on cloth around the altar 
survived till the nineteenth century swept them away. The 
communion-plate happily escaped the Royal clutches, and two

Sir T. Jackson (Wad. Coll. 160-1) thinks that the artist was Robert 
Rudland of Oxford. 
* The figures included St. Paul and St. Stephen. 
« Bernard signed his name here without the final e. The history of 
this window is given by Sir T. Jackson from the College MSS. (Wad. Coll. 
163-171 and 199). But Mr, Grinling’s paper before referred to (Proceed- 
ings of Oxford Architectural and Historical Society, N.S., vol. IV, pp. 144-71, 
and especially 152 and 161) should be noted. It may be worth mention 
that the arms of Wadham are on Archbishop Abbot’s tomb in Trinity 
Church, Guildford, and that the two fine windows in Abbot’s Hospital 
opposite the Church, of much the same date as the great window at Wad- 
ham, have strong points of resemblance with Bernard Van Ling’s work.

SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY COLLEGES AND HALLS 255 
rare round-bellied flagons, inherited from Mrs. Wadham, recall 
Elizabethan work. The Ante-Chapel had a door into the Cloister 
which led to the burying-ground beyond. But many members 
of the College were buried in the Ante-Chapel, and a few by 
favour in the Choir. At least one early Commoner who died 
of plague was allowed to rest in the “ Church-yard.”1 Wood 
has preserved the inscriptions on some of the most interesting 
monuments within. 
The kitchen wing corresponded with the Chapel, projecting 
Eastwards at the South end of the Cloister. It was approached 
by steps leading down from the Buttery passage.2_ The kitchen 
was ceiled with a barrel vault in cut stone. Young members of 
the College visiting it without permission were subjected to 
fines. The Library, placed over the kitchen wing for warmth 
and dryness, was a handsome room fifty-four feet long, lit by 
many windows on both sides, and by a large window of traceried 
Gothic at the end. It was reached by a stair from the Cloister, 
as it is still. The College Statutes appointed a Librarian at a 
salary of thirty shillings a year, and made provision for the 
keeping and chaining of the books. The building accounts 
have entries for chains and staples, desks and seats. The 
Foundress contributed some volumes, but the first great con- 
tributor was Archdeacon Bisse, an old Fellow of Magdalen and 
a Somersetshire man. The Archdeacon’s portrait has been 
loyally preserved. Another contributor in the seventeenth 
century was Bishop Henchman, a more illustrious divine, who 
was housed in the Warden’s Lodgings when Parliament met at 
Oxford in 1665. Wadham Library was comparatively late in 
its foundation, but a certain number of rare early printed books 
found their way sooner or later to its shelves. There is a copy 
of Phalaris from the Oxford Press of 1485.4 There are volumes 
from Caxton, Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde and the Aldine Press, 
and still earlier volumes printed at Rome and Venice in 1468 
and 1471. There is a beautiful edition of Petrarch issued at 
Venice in 1490, a Plautus of 1495 and a Terence of 1498. There 
are four rare editions of the English Bible, a first edition of

tietta Maria and Dorothy Wadham, once apparently in the oriel window 
in the Hall. 
* Wood says (Coll. 601) that Dr. Bisse gave 2,000 volumes, valued at 
£1,700. They were rich in controversial theology.

in 1482. On this and other treasures of the Wadham Library see Mr. E.

Hakluyt’s voyages presented by a Drake, the first four folios 
of Shakespeare and the first edition of Paradise Lost. A fine 
tenth-century manuscript of the Gospels was given to the College 
by William Boswell in 1625. 
A Common Room at Wadham formed of course no part of the 
original plan. The chamber over the Buttery was at first reserved 
for the Bursars, who met there to consider the weekly expenditure 
with the manciple, the butler and the Steward of the Hall. But 
its panelling suggests that it was converted to its present use not 
long after the Restoration. In the same age the College fabric 
was seriously damaged by a storm; the falling chimney-stacks, 
we are told, might have killed several of the scholars had they 
not been “‘ accidentally then at prayers.’’ And a later storm 
in 1690 played havoc with the Chapel windows, which, it seems, 
were not properly repaired for many years. At the South- 
west corner of the College a little timbered building of an older 
date, set close against the boundary wall, survived till 1693.7 
Just beyond it, further South, a gabled and three-storeyed 
building, also older than the College,? was used for additional 
rooms in the seventeenth century. It was known in Cromwell’s 
day as the “‘ Back lodgings,’’ and was preserved, in spite of its 
dilapidations, till the nineteenth century began. For several 
years the College had no garden except the two little walled 
enclosures in the front. The two acres to the North with their 
grove or orchard had been let off immediately by Mrs. Wadham. 
But before the end of the Civil War part of this ground had been 
taken over and made into a garden for the Warden’s use,‘ 
and during Dr. Wilkins’ Wardenship the rest of it was laid 
out as a garden for the Fellows. Loggan gives an elaborate 
picture of trim hedges and parterres, with a figure of Atlas 
set upon a mound and holding up a gilded world, and of 
walks where the ‘“ universally-curious’’ Warden entertained 
John Evelyn, telling him of his inventions and of the “ trans- 
parent apiaries’’ which he had built. Evelyn took away 
one of the hives, and the King came down to Sayes Court to 
1 There seems to be no mention of the Common Room till 1724 (Jack- 
son, 148). But see Mr. Wells’ argument as to its date (109-10). 
2 See Loggan’s print. It was then replaced by a new building—the 
first substantial addition to the College—now Staircase No, IX. 
* But probably not much older. Skelton shows it (Oxon. Rest. pl. 
153) and calls it part of the Augustinian Friary, But Sir T, Jackson 
dismisses that idea (21 and 128-9). Converted into a brewhouse in 1801, 
it made way for No. X Staircase in 1828. It may have been built origin- 
ally out of the Convent ruins. 
“Agreements between the Warden and Fellows on the subject in 
1645 and later are noted in the Convention Books in the College archives

see it.1_ Time has added space and beauty to the grounds 
where Evelyn wandered, and its own charm to the silvery 
walls above. 
Before the buildings were finished the little Society had been 
formed, and Dorothy Wadham had embodied in her Statutes 
her husband’s uncompleted plans. Among Oxford Founders 
she stands apart with Dervorguilla in a long line of churchmen, 
statesmen, merchants, Kings. Her Statutes with a few excep- 
tions were moulded on the old familiar lines, and recalled in 
particular the Statutes of Corpus. But there is a modern note 
in some of the arrangements. The language is the language of 
the Foundress and has a character and spirit of its own.2 They 
established a ‘‘ perpetual College of poor and needy Scholars,’’ 
consisting of a Warden, fifteen Fellows and fifteen Scholars, 
with two Chaplains, two clerks, a manciple, two cooks, two 
butlers and one porter. Mrs. Wadham reserved to herself all 
nominations in her lifetime, with the exception of the members 
nominated by the City of Oxford. The Warden, the real ruler 
of the Society, chosen for life from among the Fellows present 
or past, was required to take the degree of Doctor of Divinity,‘ 
to be a blameless man and not an alien or a Bishop. He was to 
be at least thirty years of age—the first Warden, Dr. Wright, 
was fifty-two—and was until the nineteenth century refused 
permission to marry. The Warden had assistants, a Vice- 
Warden, Dean and Bursars, elected annually by the Head and 
the five senior Fellows on St. Nicholas’ day. The Dean had a 
Sub-Dean to help him to preside over disputations. The Bursars 
were responsible, with the Warden and Vice-Warden, for the 
management of the College property and for the College chests. 
A Catechist, to instruct the younger members once a fortnight 
in the elements of piety and religion, a Praelector of Humanity, 
to expound classics in the Hall, a Moderator of Philosophy and 
a Librarian were included in the Staff. The Fellows, elected 
1 Evelyn’s Diary (ed. 1879, II, 57). For the gardens see also Williams 
(Oxonia Depicta, pl. XVIII). The “non ultra walk’? was probably the 
lane which ran along the North side of the College (Jackson, 211). 
2 The Statutes were not printed by the Commissioners in 1853, and 
have never been published. I have to thank the Warden’s kindness for 
a copy printed in 1855. The originals, signed and sealed the 16th August 
1612, are in the College archives. 
3 The first butler was John Buller, a poor cousin of the Foundress, 
whose name lingered on in the College buildings and is still recalled in the 
Chapel. (See Jackson, 80, and Wells, 28). Of the first Fellows seven were 
M.As., seven B.As. and only one an undergraduate. (See the list in the 
College Register of 1636).

wish, the original proposal, which insisted only on a Doctor’s degree in

from Scholars of the College and subjected to a year’s probation 
first, might hold their places for eighteen years, not more.* 
They were not required to take Orders, but they must not marry, 
and they must not possess more than ten pounds a year. The 
Scholars were to be between fourteen and nineteen at the time 
of their election, and might hold their Scholarships for twelve 
years after taking their Master’s degree. Three of them were to 
be Somersetshire and three Essex lads, and for three Fellowships 
and three Scholarships also a preference was by an after-thought 
given to Founder’s kin.? 
For all alike stipends were allotted, but the income available 
at first did not go far. The Warden drew a hundred pounds a 
year, each Fellow twenty and each Scholar ten: but like some 
other members of the College they were to receive only half- 
pay during Mrs. Wadham’s life.* Each Chaplain had thirteen 
pounds, six shillings and eightpence. Each Clerk had to be 
content with half of that amount. To increase the “ alacrity ” 
of the officers, the Vice-Warden received four pounds a year, 
the Catechist and the Moderator of Philosophy three pounds, 
the Bursars, Dean, Sub-Dean and Prelector of Humanity forty 
shillings each. But the last-named had also sixpence a quarter 
from each undergraduate Commoner and batteler, and the Dean 
and Sub-Dean had fees of their own.‘ The manciple was hand- 
somely paid with ten pounds yearly: he was neither to seek 
nor to make gain in buying College food. The butler and the 
cook had three pounds each, but the under-cook and under- 
butler four: there must have been pickings which added to 
the earnings of the chiefs. The under-cook was to be a robust 
young man, honest and unmarried, and to carry the cook’s 
basket when he went to market. The barber and the laundress 
received thirty shillings a year—the same as the Librarian— 
the porter twenty-six shillings and eightpence. The Steward 
of the Hall was a Fellow and unpaid. The Visitor, when he 
came, had his expenses humbly and reverently offered him by 
the College. 
The Foundress laid great stress on education. In all forms 
of discipline, she told her students, nothing could be better 
than practice.5 Her scholars must write at least mediocre 
1 The Foundress extended to 18 years the 10 years originally proposed. 
These terminable and non-clerical Fellowships anticipated modern ideas 
(Wells, Wadham Coll. 21-2).

* Mrs. Wadham, however, increased their pay in February 1614.

Latin verses. Lectures and disputations must go on all the 
time. The undergraduates spent three hours daily upon logic. 
They heard lectures on Greek and Latin authors three times 
a week.! Graduates, but only graduates, might read in the 
Library as a matter of right? Even the Long Vacation had 
its studies, and leave for Fellows was limited to forty, for Scholars 
to thirty, days in the year.* One or two Fellows were allowed, 
as at Corpus, to travel in order to study Medicine or Civil Law.* 
There were rules for services in Chapel, rules for the disposal 
of the rooms in College, rules for food and clothes and discipline 
traditional in Oxford life. The commons allowed for the Warden 
and Fellows were to be at least twelve pounds a year, deducted 
from their stipends, those of the Scholars six pounds and those 
of the Chaplains eight.’ Clothes and boots were to be as nearly 
as possible black. Caps must come off in presence of a senior. 
Hair must not be worn long upon the shoulders. No one living 
in Mrs. Wadham’s College must grow a beard. Walks alone 
and guns and cross-bows were forbidden. So were cards, except 
on feast days and for moderate stakes. Dogs and ferrets, hares 
and birds—coursing and cock-fighting are suggested—were as 
illicit in the seventeenth century as in earlier days. Female 
servants were still banned : even the laundress, though protected 
by her years, might only come to the outer gate of the College. 
Fines and impositions figured among the penalties: whipping 
was not mentioned, but it by no means follows that it was not 
allowed. Fellows, Scholars and even the Warden were re- 
movable for gross misconduct. The Visitor, the Bishop of Bath 
and Wells, had power to interpret and enforce the rules, Com- 
moners and battelers who would not obey them could be removed 
after a warning by the Warden. But these two classes of 
members could not be admitted without the consent of the 
majority of Fellows. They had, on attaining the age of fifteen, 
to swear to be true and faithful to the College, and to “ observe 
and keep the ordinary exercise of this house appointed” for 
1 Mr. Wells estimates (Wadham, 25) that an undergraduate had 23 
or 24 hours of lectures or disputations every week. 
® For the Library rules see Siats. (cap. 28). Each graduate had a key ; 
any others entering must be accompanied by a Fellow.

meat and drink in Hall (Jb. cap. 13). At first the Fellows, Scholars, 
Chaplains and Clerks must have spent more than half their incomes on 
their commons: but the Foundress reserved power to alter this (Jb, cap. 
31): there were also allowances for Gaudy days (cap. 27).

them. This oath was allowed to be taken in English, though 
Latin was still the language of the Scholars, and still enforced 
at meals in Hall.1 Commoners had to pay twenty shillings or 
to give a silver cup on admission. Even battelers had to pay 
ten shillings each. They were both to some extent profitable 
members, and when the College opened there were a large 
number on its list.? 
Wadham, which thus differed in some ways materially from 
the earliest Colleges, was from the first a West Country founda- 
tion. A majority of the original Fellows belonged to Somerset 
or Devon, and four were imported from Exeter College. But 
the “extraneous” undergraduates outnumbered them largely. 
The first Warden, Robert Wright of Trinity, who resigned in a 
few months’ time because the Foundress refused him permission 
to marry, was in some respects a remarkable man. As a 
Bishop he was impeached in 1641, and he died in arms for the 
Royalist cause. His immediate successors were mostly short- 
lived. Warden Fleming’s appointment indeed was irregular, 
for he was a Fellow of Exeter and not of Wadham. But the 
College during its first years was largely ruled by the directions 
of the Foundress, a great lady of the Elizabethan age. She 
wrote letters nominating Bursars, Lecturers and Deans. She 
insisted on her nominee being made a cook: Dr. Wright had 
surreptitiously introduced his own.5 She sent ten pounds to 
be spent “in Gawdyes”’ on the first Christmas Day. A few 
weeks later, in February 1614, she made over to the College the 
Essex property left to her for life, reserving only a rent-charge 
of two hundred pounds a year. This at length gave the Fellows 
and Scholars a reasonable margin beyond the cost of food. 
Next month her ‘‘ Cosen Buller,” the butler, and John Williams, 
the manciple, received small annuities. And a little later, 
when the Essex rents fell off, Mrs. Wadham generously reduced 
her own charge to a hundred pounds. If the Fellows encroached 
on her rights under the Statutes, she would gently ‘‘ write these 
few lines’”’ to remind them of their duty. But on the whole 
she found “ great comfort’ in them: and when she died in 
May 1618, at the age of eighty-four, the College joined John

2 Sir T. Jackson (66~7) makes the total numbers of the College over 
eighty, of whom some three-fourths were undergraduates. The College 
Register gives 18 ordinary Commoners for 1613 ; and the Fellow Com- 
moners and battelers together accounted for at least as many more,

Arnold, her Executor, in giving her a far more sumptuous funeral 
than she had desired. Alderman Boswell’s bill for broadcloth 
—his son was a Scholar of Wadham College—exceeded a 
hundred and fifty-seven pounds. And the funeral feast in the 
Hall was on a corresponding scale.1. The motto over the head 
of the Foundress on the fine brass in the church at Ilminster 
—‘‘I will not dye but lyue and declare ye worke of ye lorde”’ 
—claims immortality for the work she left behind.? Fuller 
reminds us that ‘‘ Absalom having no children reared up for 
himself a pillar to perpetuate his name.” 
The West Country lost no time in showing its interest in the 
new College. Of twenty-six new-comers in 1615 twenty were 
from Dorset, Somerset, Devonshire or Cornwall.? A Drake 
appeared as a Scholar in 1617, and a Rodney as a Fellow-Com- 
moner in the same year. Robert Blake, perhaps the greatest 
son of Wadham, and one of the greatest of English captains, 
came up from Bridgwater to St. Alban Hall, but took his 
Bachelor’s degree from Wadham in 1618. ‘‘ He was an early 
riser,” says Aubrey, ‘‘and studyed well, but also tooke his 
robust pleasures of fishing, fowling, etc.” 4 Tradition adds 
that Merton refused a Fellowship to a man of such squat and 
ungainly build. One of Blake’s eleven brothers spent many 
years as a member of Wadham. Carew Ralegh, “son of the 
most brave and learned knight Walter Ralegh,”’ was boldly 
welcomed to the College within a short time of his father’s 
death. Monk’s brother Nicholas, but not George Monk the 
King-maker himself, came up from Devonshire later on. Court- 
ney, and Thynne, Carew and Chudleigh, Portman, Windham 
and Luttrell occur early among well-known West Country 
names. There was little at first to mark the College annals. 
King James tried, in contempt of the Statutes, to intrude a 
Scottish Fellow. But though the Fellows “feared the King, 
they feared Almighty God still more,” and the Royal candidate 
was rejected, even though he canvassed the Fellows in their 
bedrooms. In 1625 the plague came to Oxford with the Parlia- 
ment, and there was some fear of its invading the College. One

Coll. 89), and quotes some of Mrs, Wadham’s letters in his seventh 
chapter. 
2 The eighth chapter of the same book has an admirable description 
of the Wadham monuments at Ilminster. But the inscription on the 
scroll over Mrs. Wadham’s head surely begins “‘ I will,” and not “I shall.” 
The Vicar of Ilminster has very kindly verified it for me.

of the original Fellows refused to surrender his place when he 
inherited more than the Statutes allowed. A Commoner of 
1630, who could not live within his income, besought his father 
to remember the abnormal price of Oxford bread. John Gauden, 
who may have written the Eikon Basilike, came to Wadham 
in that year asa tutor. Students destined to succeed as Puritan 
preachers came up even in the days of Laud. One iconoclast, 
Philip Hunton, whom Cromwell made the Head of a College, 
maintained that the sovereignty of England resided in the three 
Estates—a doctrine burned in the Schools’ Quadrangle, with 
some of Milton’s heresies, after his death. 
The Civil War brought its inevitable divisions to Wadham 
as elsewhere, though the gift of the College plate to the King 
was “‘unanimously agreed by Warden and Fellows.”1 A 
Strangways and a St. John were among the members of the 
College who held commissions in the Royal Army. Henry 
Ancketyll, a Prebendary in 1639, threw off his cassock and held 
Corfe Castle for the King. Charles Dymoke, the King’s Cham- 
pion, died in garrison at Oxford: he had come to the College 
fresh from the Royal Coronation. Francis Blewett was killed 
before Lyme Regis fighting against Blake. Charles D’Oiley, 
on the other side, at Naseby commanded Fairfax’s victorious 
guards. Nicholas Love, a lawyer of distinction, sat on the 
Court which condemned King Charles to death. Thomas 
Sydenham, the large-hearted physician, ‘‘ Medicus in omne 
zvum nobilis,” came back to Oxford after serving with the 
Parliament, and entered as a Fellow-Commoner, it seems, at 
Wadham.? With the War admissions dwindled quickly. There 
were no new Commoners in 1644 or 1645.3 The vacant rooms 
fell to Royalist soldiers and officials. The Attorney-General 
1 See the entry in the College Convention Book II (100-1). 
2 Sydenham’s letter to Dr. Gould of Wadham (Sloane Addit, MS. 
4376, Brit. Mus.), which Dr. Payne notes (D.N.B.), though it seems to 
have escaped Sydenham’s other biographers, rather confirms Mr. Wells’ 
view (Wadham, 57-8, n.) that he joined the College in 1646, and not in 
Oct. 1647, as Mr, Gardiner (Registers, I, 165) suggests. ‘‘ I my Selfe was 
once a Fellow-Coroner of your house but how long since I should be glad 
to know from you as I remember it was in y* year that Oxford was sur- 
rendred though I had bin of Magdalen Hall som time before.” The name 
Sydenham without date or initial appears among the Upper Commoners 
in the College Register (1636) between the name of Sir E, Herbert in October 
1643 and the name of Henry Paulet in October 1647. Sydenham was at 
Magdalen Hall before the War, and a “ Mr, Sidnam ” appears among the 
Magdalen Hall M.As. submitting in May 1648, He was madea Fellow 
off All Souls in Oct. 1648. 
i. p® See the College Register of 1636. The only Fellow Commoners en- 
tered under 1643 are William Earle of Bedford and St. Edward Herbert

had two sons born in the College. But the surrender of the city 
swept the Royalists away. In April 1648 Warden Pitt was 
ejected.1 But most of his Fellows and Scholars and Commoners 
stood by him. They answered the Parliamentary Visitors with 
every species of evasion, and many of them were content to 
share the Warden’s fate.# 
The famous Dr. Wilkins succeeded to the Wardenship. 
On his appointment he was only thirty-four, New Puritan 
Fellows were admitted. Religious discipline perhaps grew 
narrow, but order and scholarship improved. In 1650 the 
number of admissions ran up to fifty-seven.4 The old West 
Country families still sent their sons. The College finances 
were re-established: they had suffered inevitably during the 
War.’ Four hundred pounds, it seems, were owing to brewers, 
bakers and others. In 1650 three Fellowships and three Scholar- 
ships were suspended for four years. In 1649 the Parliamentary 
Visitors took up the question of augmenting the stipends of the 
Heads of twelve Colleges, of which Wadham was one, and in 
1651 augmentations of some value were granted. Under this 
arrangement the Warden of Wadham received sixty-three pounds, 
ten shillings a year, and in 1654 he joined the Heads of other 
Colleges in petitioning that the arrears of these augmentations 
should be paid.* In that year also a bequest by John Good- 
ridge, the first large benefactor since Mrs. Wadham’s death, 
created new Exhibitions and added something to the pay of 
members of the College. In 1668 the advowson of Wadhurst 
was given in memory of an undergraduate who had died. But 
Wadham continued to be a poor College, and was rated, in 
1 See the order signed by Francis Rous in the College Register of 
Foundationers (p. 41). 
2 Mr. Wells, following Mr. Gardiner, estimates that 9 out of 13 Fellows, 
9 out of 14 Scholars, and 11 Commoners or battelers were expelled. Prof. 
Burrows (Reg. of Visitors, 559-61) estimates the numbers differently, but 
certainty is difficult to attain. He gives (86-8) the answers of 13 members 
of the College, and a list (561-3) of 26 persons appointed by the Visitors, 
including Seth Ward, John Wilkins and Christopher Wren. See also the 
Register of Foundationers about this date.

5 One of Warden Pitt’s last acts was to join in a decree by which the 
salaried members of the College gave up part of their stipends for College 
needs (Convention Book II, 114), and in 1670-1 and 1684 this generous policy 
was repeated (Convention Book I, under those years).

Mr. Wells is surely right in thinking that the £63.10.0 was added to the 
Warden’s income of £100. Before the end of the century the Warden’s 
income is stated to have fallen to £70, in a list given in Bodley MS. Tanner 
338 (f. 204%). I doubt its accuracy.

264 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
company with Balliol and Pembroke, University and Jesus, 
at a hundred pounds only in 1682. 
John Wilkins, an invaluable Warden, was the son of an 
Oxford goldsmith and one of the most interesting figures in the 
University of his day. Educated at New Inn Hall and Magdalen 
Hall, he owed his first advancement to patrons like Lord Saye 
and Sele and the Prince Palatine. He owed something, no 
doubt, to the good fortune which made him brother-in-law to 
Oliver Cromwell in 1656—the Parliamentary Visitors had con- 
veniently suspended the old rule of celibacy in 1652 +—and 
father-in-law to Archbishop Tillotson later. But he owed most 
to his own character and judgment, his moderation, his natural 
kindliness, and the suprising vigour of his mind. He protected 
Royalists in the hour of their depression. He was John Evelyn’s 
“deare and excellent friend.” He was a Bishop after the 
Restoration, but not afraid of tolerant, Latitudinarian ways. 
Unpopular with fanatics on both sides, he soon became a power 
in Oxford, and was conspicuous among its rulers until he left 
it to become Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1659. 
He revived the study of the ‘‘new philosophy.” He wrote 
treatises to prove that the moon might be inhabited, and might 
even be reached. He tried to invent a universal language. 
He was more successful in inventing mechanical contrivances— 
a statue that spoke, a wheel to run races in—“ artificial, mathe- 
matical and magical curiosities ’’—perhaps with the help of his 
friend Sir William Petty and of that “ prodigious” young 
scholar, Christopher Wren. Wilkins drew everybody round him, 
Cavaliers and Roundheads, inventors and musicians, scholars 
and divines. Even his College manciple became the creator of 
a quadrant. At a famous concert at the Warden’s lodgings, 
where a formidable German violinist was performing, Anthony 
Wood was ‘‘haled in”’ and induced to play. A “‘lustie, strong 
growne, well sett,” hospitable figure, Wilkins must have been 
a reconciling influence in the sharply divided Oxford of his 
day. 
. Wilkins now perhaps is best remembered for gathering at 
Wadham the scientific men who were to form the nucleus of 
the Royal Society.? Of that brilliant circle Seth Ward, Savilian 
1 But Wilkins was the only exception to the rule. His wife, Robina 
Cromwell, was the widow of Peter French, a Canon of Christ Church, and 
his step-daughter Elizabeth French became Mrs. Tillotson. For Wilkins’ 
correspondence with Richard Cromwell see Cal. State Papers, Dom. (13 
Dec. 1657, 29 Mar. and 21 May 1658, etc.). 
2 Dr. Sprat (Hist. of Royal Society, 1667, p. 53) makes the Warden’s 
Lodgings the cradle of the Society. But the first meetings were held in 
London, and then at Petty’s Lodgings in Oxford, before they were held 
at Wadham (see Weld’s Hist, of Roy. Soc. 30 sq., and later, Ch, XVIII).

Professor of Astronomy, and like Wilkins a Bishop of the Restora- 
tion, entered Wadham as a Fellow Commoner in 1650. He 
lived in the tower over the Gate, and during his Oxford residence 
he had the strange experience of being twice elected to Head- 
ships of Colleges which he was not allowed to retain.t Thomas 
Sprat, also a Bishop later, poet, wit, historian and versatile 
divine, began life as a eulogist of Cromwell and ended it as a 
defender of Dr. Sacheverell. He wrote a biography of Cowley and 
a history of the Royal Society, in prose which both Johnson and 
Macaulay praised. Laurence Rooke, imported like some others 
from Cambridge, mathematician, chemist, botanist, musician, 
preceded Wren as Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College. 
Walter Pope, the Warden’s half-brother, who held the same 
Chair, wrote biographies not only of Seth Ward but of Claude 
Duval.2 As Proctor he made a memorable stand against the 
proposal to abolish caps and hoods. Above all, Christopher 
Wren, who was a Fellow Commoner of Wadham for three or 
four years before his election to All Souls, and who long remained 
in touch with his old College, delighted, it seems, in the Warden’s 
society as much as his contemporaries delighted in his own.? 
With Wilkins a brilliant period of the College history ended. 
But the Restoration brought no violent change. Warden 
Blandford, elected in 1659, held his own and passed on to the 
Bishopric of Oxford later. Only one Royalist Fellow of the 
old days, Nicholas Strangways, seems to have been restored. 
Discipline suffered. Drinking increased. In one drunken quarrel 
a Bible clerk of Exeter was murdered by a Commoner of Wadham, 
a Judge’s son. But Gilbert Ironside, a man of strong character, 
succeeded Blandford in 1665. He ruled the Society till 1689, 
and he kept up its prosperity and numbers.‘ Ironside had a 
great respect for Wilkins; he once rated Wood sharply for his 
churlish criticism of that distinguished man. ‘‘He gave me 
roast meat,” the historian complains—he had been invited by 
the Warden to supper—‘ and beat me with the spit.” In return 
Wood repeated Dean Fell’s opinion that Ironside was “‘ a prating 
and proud coxcomb.”” Ironside perhaps was too independent   
1 Of Jesus College in 1657 and of Trinity in 1659. 
2 On Rooke, Pope and others of their colleagues and contemporaries 
see the sketches given by Wood (Athene, III, 587-9 and IV, 724-6), in 
Pope’s short Life of Seth Lord Bishop of Salisbury, and in J. Ward’s Lives 
of the Professors of Gresham College. 
3 Wren was apparently paying rent for the chamber over the gateway 
in 1663 (Gardiner, Reg. I, 178), when he had left All Souls. On the sugar- 
castor which he gave to the College, and the date of the gift, see Wells 
(Wadham, 68). 
« The admissions at Wadham averaged over 20, even in the dark days 
of the Popish Plot (Wells, 95).

for the Dean. He was too independent also for the Visitor, 
who once summoned the Warden and Fellows to appear before 
him to answer a complaint. The Warden replied boldly that 
the Bishop’s power of visitation was limited and could only be 
exercised in the precincts of the College. Ironside was too 
independent also to truckle to King James—though Wadham 
men were prepared to serve, if need be, against Monmouth. 
He would not countenance James’ illegalities at Magdalen. 
He told him his opinion as ‘‘ an honest blunt man.” He refused 
to meet James’ Commissioners. He wasno Kirke, “‘ to dine under 
the gallows.” He would not attend Magdalen Chapel “‘ to hear 
eulogies on the Virgin Mary.” He deserved the Bishopric 
which William gave him, rough of tongue as he often was. 
The Prince of Orange had visited Wadham some years before. 
The College became a Whig College. Warden Dunster, says 
a splenetic Tory, was one of “ y® Violentest Whiggs, and most 
Rascally Low-Church Men of y® Age.” 1 But Dunster’s merits 
or demerits and the epigrams which gathered round him belong 
to the small chronicles of a later day. ] 
Wadham had its share of Bishops, and of scientific Bishops 
too. William Lloyd of St. Asaph, whom James II sent to the 
Tower, and who was more closely connected with Jesus College, 
had “more learning in ready cash,” said Wilkins, than any 
man he ever knew. He had wit too, and is credited with a 
practical joke which must have delighted the undergraduate 
world. A visitor, staying at the Mitre, was persuaded to pose 
as a Patriarch from Greece. The Dean of Christ Church called 
on him for advice, the Greek Professor harangued him in his 
own tongue, and religious enthusiasts applied for his blessing, 
before the imposture was suspected or disclosed. In the same 
period Thomas Lyndesay, one of Swift’s friends in his Irish 
exile, passed from Wadham to be Dean of St. Patrick’s and 
Archbishop of Armagh. Henry Godolphin, though no Bishop, 
passed to the Deanery of St. Paul’s, where he interfered with 
Wren. His brother Charles left to the Library a great store of 
Spanish books. And the list of lesser men of note could easily 
be made disproportionately long. Among the earliest Fellows 
Humphrey Sydenham, unbending loyalist and “‘ silver-tongued ” 
divine, once incurred “scandalous excommunication”; but he 
secured the patronage of Laud. Harris, son of a Mayor of 
Oxford, who died young, was an original Fellow nominated 
by the City. Alexander Huish, whom Mrs. Wadham nominated 
to succeed him, was a great Oriental Scholar and a great sufferer 
by the War. A letter still survives from the mother of Thomas 
Gower, the ancestor of a distinguished stock, who had come 
1 Hearne (Collections, I, 291).

up as a boy of twelve to the College, imploring him to continue 
his daily prayers, lest his ‘“‘ younge years” should lead him to 
forget his Maker. The College lists, soon after the middle of 
the century, overflow with names of interest. Cromwell’s son- 
in-law and nephew, a Russell and a Desborough, were students 
under Wilkins.1 Charles Sedley, a grandson of Sir Henry 
Savile and a typical figure of the Court of Charles II, came up 
in 1656. Rochester, Sedley’s rival in gifts and in debauchery, 
came up in 1660 as a boy of twelve, eloped with a great heiress 
at eighteen, and died bankrupt in health and fortune at the age 
of thirty-three.2 Lord Lovelace was one of the first Peers to 
rise for William of Orange. Mayow, who brought to the study 
of pure science gifts even greater perhaps than Thomas Syden- 
ham’s, passed on like Sydenham to All Souls. And Robert 
Pitt, a physician who denounced the “ folly of taking too much 
physic,” helped after the Restoration to keep the scientific 
traditions of Wadham alive. 
In the same age, but in another field, John Pratt, a great 
Whig lawyer, became Chief Justice and the father of a greater 
lawyer still. Lord Campbell was apparently surprised by the 
promotion of a judge ‘‘ unredeemed from insipidity by the 
commission of a single great crime.” Thomas Creech, who 
translated Lucretius before passing on to All Souls in 1683, 
was the best of a group of minor poets, who won for Wadham 
the praises of Dryden and of Mrs. Aphra Behn. Humphrey 
Hody, who shared his room, was a greater scholar, and Professor 
of Greek before the century closed. He founded exhibitions 
for Greek and Hebrew in the College. Bentley, a greater scholar 
still, resided for some months at Wadham, and was Hody’s 
friend until a point of spelling broke their friendship down. 
And one other name of the seventeenth century deserves at 
least a word of mention, that of the Puritan Bursar, Samuel 
Lee, whose work is still to be seen in the archives of the College, 
who received a London living from Oliver Cromwell, faced exile 
and imprisonment under Charles II, and breathed the prayer 
that all within the walls of his old and dear Society might be 
“set up for standing pillars in the House of God.’’®

  268 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Fourteen years after the foundation of Wadham another 
College, ‘‘ the youngest College in England,” was created by the 
expansion and endowment of “‘ the oldest of all halls.’’! West 
of St. Frideswide’s, between the streets now called St. Aldate’s 
and St. Ebbe’s, there lay a rectangular piece of ground, stretching 
Northwards from the old town wall. It was bounded on the 
North by Pennyfarthing Street, now named after the College 
which has absorbed most of the site. It was bounded on the 
South by the lane below the ramparts, now Brewers Street but 
known in bygone days by many names, Lombard Lane, King 
Street, Pudding Lane and Slaying Lane—the last from the 
shambles, and not from any “terrible slaughter of the gowns- 
men” there. Little Gate at the South-west corner and South 
Gate at the South-east corner led to the water meadows where 
the Franciscans and Dominicans had found homes, and dwellers 
on the wall could look down upon the Friars’ cloisters and hear 
perhaps the nightingales singing in their groves. In this rec- 
tangular space the principal building was the ancient Church 
of St. Aldate’s, its advowson shared for centuries between St. 
Frideswide’s and Abingdon Abbey, its churchyard at least as 
large as at present and surrounded by a number of old Halls. 
Broadgates Hall, the best remembered, stood probably not 
far from the South-west corner of the church. It was one of 
several hostels which bore that name in Oxford, with histories 
nearly as old as the University itself.2 And it may have been, 
Gardiner (Registers, Introduction, xiii sq.) gives a detailed account. The 
Warden’s MSS. are now unfortunately missing. But the original Statutes 
are there, and the original Building Accounts (1610-1613) of which Sir 
T. Jackson has made such full use. The Register of Admissions on the 
Foundation from 1610 is still in use: but it is mainly a record of names. 
The Register of Members, dated 1636, includes Commoners and battelers 
and has some entries of interest. But it has serious gaps, notably from 
1647 to 1659, and before the middle of the eighteenth century it ceases. 
Neither Register throws much light on the political vicissitudes of the 
seventeenth century. There is more varied matter in the two Convention 
Books, of which the one labelled II is the earlier. Beginning in 1613 it is 
continued to 1648. Then Convention Book I takes up the story, with 
entries from July 1650, onwards. But this jumps from July 1658 tojJuly 
1668, and in Sept. 1659 No. II begins again. The Convention Books have 
many entries of interest, but even in them events like the Restoration 
pass practically unnoticed. The Caution Books, the Bursars’ Accounts 
and the Chamber Books also contain interesting details. References in 
Wood and other authorities have been already noted. 
1 There is no proof that this claim to superior antiquity was well 
founded. 
2 Compare Wood (City, I, index) and Hurst’s Topography (index) with 
the note in Mr. Macleane’s larger History of Pembroke College (27-9), to 
which I am constantly indebted. I have referred to this volume as his 
History, and have reserved the name of Pembroke for his smaller and later 
volume on the same subject, which he has made his own.

  SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY COLLEGES AND HALLS 269 
as Wood suggests, originally known as Segrim Hall, for tradition 
identifies it with the great messuage in the angle of the church- 
yard, which Richard Segrim, a leading citizen, bestowed on the 
Prior and Monks of St. Frideswide’s about the year 1254.1 
To this Hall in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries 
students may have come, to attend the Law Schools near. The 
curious chamber built over the South side of St. Aldate’s, which 
served in Tudor days as a School of Civil Law, carried on perhaps 
much earlier traditions. The aisle below it, given by John 
Docklinton, a prosperous fishmonger of Edward III’s day, who 
may have suffered twinges of conscience in regard to the great 
riot at Abingdon in 1327, was used as a Chapel by Broadgates 
students and later on by Pembroke men. Philip Repington, 
Wycliffite first and Cardinal afterwards, was one of the members 
of the Hall. Nicholas Upton became another, when the soldier 
who had served against Joan of Arc was persuaded by Duke 
Humphrey to turn Canonist and divine.? Early in the fifteenth 
century the list of recorded Principals begins. Before that 
century was over the buildings had to be enlarged. A house 
called Abingdon Chambers, to the East of the old Hall, was taken 
in. A building beyond that, belonging to New College, was 
rented in 1498. In the same century the Refectory, now Pem- 
broke College Library, and the only surviving part of the old 
Hall, was built. In the century that followed a house to the 
North of the Refectory called Cambey’s Lodgings, was added, 
and Mine Hall beyond it to the West. Numbers, no doubt, 
fluctuated with the fortunes of the University. But Broadgates 
held its own and persisted, though many of the other old Halls 
died out.®

  270 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Lawyers of distinction had their early training in this small 
Society. Brawls varied its uneventful history. There was a 
notable fight in 1446 against a rival Hall, in which both 
Principals took part. There was another in 1520 with the Town 
Watch. As the sixteenth century proceeded, and especially 
after the foundation of Christ Church, the importance of Broad- 
gates increased. Men of note appeared among its Principals. 
Brian Higdon, the brother of the first Dean of Christ Church, 
was a friend of Wolsey and of Cromwell. John Noble, his 
successor, has a fine tomb in St. Aldate’s Church. John Story, 
Bonner’s Chancellor, took part in trying Cranmer, fled to join 
Alva in the days of Elizabeth, was captured on the seas, hanged 
and quartered as a traitor, and revered as a martyr to the Catholic 
cause. Thomas Yonge became an Elizabethan Archbishop of 
York. Robert Weston, Principal in 1546, was Lord Chancellor 
of Ireland in 1567, where he subdued rebels ‘‘ by sanctity rather 
than by force.” Thomas Randolph, a Reformer and a friend 
of Jewel, became a great Ambassador in later days, and laboured 
vainly to prevent the marriage which ruined Mary Stuart. 
George Summaster, appointed Principal in 1575, ruled over his 
society of students successfully for three and forty years. 
Other names also well known in the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries are found in the records of Broadgates Hall. John 
Heywood, famous for his Interludes and Epigrams, and one of 
the Fathers of English comedy, holds no mean place in the history 
of the stage. He drew at least one rhyme from his memories 
of Oxford : 
“Alas! poor fardingales must lie in the street: 
To house them, no door in the city made meet. 
Since at our narrow doors they in cannot win, 
Send them to Oxford, at Broadgates to get in,” * 
Fuller explains that the ladies of the day wore such exaggerated 
farthingales, ‘‘ penthoused out far beyond their bodies, that 
they could not enter (except by going sidelong) at any ordinary 
door.” Bishop Bonner, ‘ the Spunge of Blood,” is declared by 
tradition to have served once in the kitchen, which in later days 
he presented with a great brass pot.* Sir John Tregonwell was 
a Reformer under Thomas Cromwell and a loyal Catholic under 
Mary Tudor. Sir James Dyer, the incorruptible judge, and his 
kinsman Edward, styled by Spenser “in a manner oure onlye 
2 John Budden, Regius Professor of Civil Law, who intervened for a 
year or so between Summaster and Clayton, wrote brief Latin lives of 
Waynflete and of Cardinal Morton.

SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY COLLEGES AND HALLS 271 
Inglishe poett,’”’1 are claimed as Broadgates students. But 
Spenser’s only English poet was by no means the only poet of 
Broadgates Hall. George Peele and Francis Beaumont take 
rank in greater company. Francis Beaumont was admitted in 
1597, with his two brothers, at the age of twelve. Sir John, his 
brother, was a poet too. Charles Fitzgeffrey won praises as a 
“towring Falcon” for a poem on Drake. Richard Corbet, who 
passed on to Christ Church, was as witty in his verse as in his 
sermons and his cups. Dryden in the same age had two uncles 
at Broadgates. William Camden was there between his days 
at Magdalen and at Christ Church. Degory Wheare, Pym’s 
tutor and the first holder of Camden’s Chair of History, was a 
member of the Hall. Young men of fortune mingled with these 
men of letters—some passing on to Christ Church, some going 
there for tuition only—and in some the fortune and the taste 
for letters were combined. Philip Sidney, with his “‘ lovely 
and familiar gravity,” was the most conspicuous of the earlier 
Elizabethan students. But his stomach was weak, and his 
august uncle, the Chancellor, had to ask the Archbishop’s leave 
for the boy to eat flesh in Lent. Sidney’s “staidness of 
mind” was already remarkable, and Cecil was proposing to 
accept him as a son-in-law before his undergraduate days were 
done. 
Sidney had friends at Broadgates who could appreciate his 
charm, even if his dear biographer, Fulke Greville, never joined 
him there. Carews came up from the West Country, including 
George Carew who entered the Hall at the age of ten, and made 
a figure as Earl of Totnes afterwards. There are other West 
Country names recorded—Drake, Grenville, Clifford, Strode, 
Trefusis, Thynnes from Longleat, ‘“ Judas” Stucley who was 
said to have betrayed his cousin Ralegh,? Francis Rous who 
was Speaker of Barebones’ Parliament in 1653. But the greatest 
name upon the list is Pym’s. He came up in 1599 from his 
stepfather’s home in Cornwall. He devoted himself to poetry— 
in those days poetry at Broadgates was at least as popular as 
law ; and he passed on to the Middle Temple without taking 
a degree. For all its love of song the Hall had also Puritan 
traditions, dating from those Elizabethan days. William Knight 
and his companions under James I even ventured to challenge 
1 See Spenser’s dedication of Gabriel Harvey’s poems (Harvey’s 
Works, ed. Grosart, I, 111), But Edward Dyer may have been at Balliol, 
if he was at Oxford at all. 
* At least Mr. Macleane (Pembroke, 44) includes Stucley or Stukely in 
his list. His chapters are full, especially in his earlier History, of inter- 
esting biographical details. But it must not be taken as certain that all 
the students assigned to Broadgates by tradition were there.

  272, A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the excessive claims of Kings. But Broadgates found room 
for Catholics and ascetics as well as for Calvinists and rebels, 
and Wood traces in its history a fair proportion of prelates and 
divines. 
A curious story attaches to the change which converted 
Broadgates Hall into Pembroke College. Thomas Tesdale, 
latterly of Glympton near Woodstock, was one of the many 
prosperous men of business who found fortune in the Elizabethan 
age. Beginning life as a maltster at Abingdon—he had had his 
education at Abingdon Free School—he developed into a great 
merchant, a dealer in wood and wool, a grazier, a corn-grower, 
perhaps a clothier and contractor too. He had married well 
and made influential friends. He was ‘“‘a bountiful Housekeeper,” 
a ‘“‘ lover of God’s word,” liberal to his kindred, generous to the 
poor. Being left childless, as the Wadhams were childless, | 
Tesdale seems to have resolved to follow the fine example they 
hadset. And dying in 1610, he bequeathed five thousand pounds 
of English money to George Abbot, not yet Archbishop, Sir John 
Bennet, his.own nephew, tand Dr. Airay, Provost of Queen’s, 
to maintain “‘ thirteene Schollers in Balliol Colledge in the Uni- 
versity of Oxford, if there they may be conveniently placed 
and entertained,” and if not, then in University College, and 
if not, “‘ then in some such other Colledge within the University ” 
as his trustees thought fit. Six of the thirteen were to be poor 
Scholars, on a lower footing than the others, and these were 
to be provided for first. The inscription placed by Tesdale’s 
widow on his tomb describes him as “‘ lyberally beneficial to Balliol 
Colledge,” and there is little doubt what his intentions were. 
The means by which Balliol was deprived of this great legacy 
have never been satisfactorily explained. Henry Savage, the 
Master of Balliol, who gave an account of the transaction, thought 
that his College had been unfairly used.2_ The Master and Fellows 
of Balliol entered into arrangements with the citizens of Abing- 
don—Tesdale’s scheme was closely connected with Abingdon 
School—by which they received three hundred pounds imme- 
diately to provide accommodation for the six poor Scholars, 
Cesar’s Lodging in St. Giles’ was secured for the purpose, and 
there in due course the first Tesdale Scholars were housed.® 
It has been suggested, to account for what followed, that the 
1 The will is quoted by Mr. Macleane (Hist. 167-9). Seven of the thir- 
teen, distinguished as Fellows, were to receive {25 a year. The six poor 
Scholars received less. For Tesdale’s life see F. Little (4 Monument of 
Christian. Munificence, 64 sq.) and Mr. Macleane’s History. 
2 Balliofergus (86-7). 
* Mr. Macleane cannot find that any of them matriculated before 1621 
(Pembroke, 66). It seems that the rents of the Tesdale property accumu- 
lated at Abingdon meanwhile.

SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY COLLEGES AND HALLS 273 
Balliol Fellows declined to fall in with proposals which would 
have made the new Scholars. from Abingdon too important an 
element in the College.1 Be that as it may, when Richard 
Wightwicke, a new benefactor and an old Balliol man, offered 
in 1623-24 to add three Fellows and four Scholars to Tesdale’s 
foundation, it seems to have been felt that the whole endow- 
ment justified the establishment of a new College. The Balliol 
authorities may have made conditions which gave a pretext for 
a change of plan. The citizens of Abingdon may have had 
ambitions of their own. Private influences, Court influences 
possibly, of which we know nothing, may have been brought 
to bear. At any rate it was determined to transfer to Broad- 
gates Hall the endowment allotted to Balliol College. The 
claims of University were apparently ignored. Archbishop 
Abbot, who had been Fellow of Balliol and Master of University, 
seems to have acquiesced in the transaction. So did Dr. Clayton, 
the Principal of Broadgates, another old Balliol man. Dr. 
Airay was dead. Sir John Bennet did not object. The assent 
of Lord Pembroke, the Chancellor, who was also Visitor of Broad- 
gates, was secured. The burgesses of Abingdon petitioned the 
King to sanction the new proposal. In June 1624 a Charter 
was granted for a College “ of the foundation of King James at 
the cost and charges of Thomas Tesdale and Richard Wight- 
wicke.’”’ 2? On the 5th August its members were admitted in 
the presence of a distinguished company, headed by the Vice- 
Chancellor Dr. Prideaux ; and young Thomas Browne, a Com- 
moner alike of Broadgates and of Pembroke, delivered one of 
the Latin speeches made in honour of the event. 
Wightwicke, the co-Founder of Pembroke, who by a strange 
chance did such disservice to his own old College, belonged to 
a Staffordshire family of long descent. He had taken his degree 
at Balliol over forty years before, and had since been incumbent 
of a Berkshire living. His benefaction, which did not begin 
to take effect till 1625, was not comparable in value to Tesdale’s 
bequest.? It finally included five hundred pounds for building, 
1 Savage’s statement that the Condescensions of Balliol ‘ could not 
have been greater, without manifest injury to the ancient foundation ” 
suggests that serious differences arose. See also Little (A Monument, 
etc. 75). 
2 See the Letters Patent of June 29, 1624 (Stats. of Colls. III, Pem- 
broke, vi). In the College archives there is a certified copy, but not the 
original deed. 
3% From the fund allotted—{1o0o0 a year for 5 years—chambers for 
Wightwicke Fellows and Scholars were to be built (Statutes, Pembroke, 
24-5), and the Master was to receive {10 a year. But Wightwicke’s arrange- 
ments were not completed till just before his death (see Macleane, Pem- 
broke, 84-5).

to be paid within five years, ten pounds a year for the Master, 
and a hundred pounds a year for three Fellows and four Scholars 
—to run from Lady Day, 1630. But Tesdale and Wightwicke 
together allotted enough to maintain on a reasonable footing a 
Master, ten Fellows and ten Scholars in the new College. All 
the original beneficiaries, however, except the Master and the 
five Scholars imported from Balliol—the sixth Tesdale Scholar 
at Balliol had unhappily been stabbed by an undergraduate 
for pulling his hair !—were required to resign their places if called 
upon to do so, in order that funds for building might be secured.? 
It was not till the necessary buildings were provided that they 
could hope to recover their rights,* and even then it was not 
certain that other nominees would not be appointed in their place. 
The first Statutes, issued in 1624, by Royal Commissioners 
of whom Wightwicke was one, still remain among the archives 
of the College. They were signed by Archbishop Abbot, the 
Chancellor Pembroke, Vice-Chancellor Prideaux, Sir John Bennet, 
Sir Eubule Thelwall, Principal of Jesus, and Thomas Clayton, 
the first Master. But in 1628 these regulations were remodelled 
and the Statutes took their permanent form. The first require- 
ment was divine service. Prayers were to be held twice daily 
in the College Chapel. A fine of two pence was imposed for 
non-attendance, and of one penny for coming in after the Psalms : 
but the rod might be used to chasten absentees under eighteen. 
All, even servants, must attend University sermons. No man 
must defend heresies disapproved of by the Church of England+ 
the penalty was a fine of six pence, or worse things if the offender 
persevered. Unauthorised swearing meant a penalty of twelve 
pence. Latin graces and Bible reading, publice, clare, Latine, 
were ordained for meals in Hall. The Master, a Churchman of 
thirty, and preferably a Doctor in Theology, Medicine or Civil 
Law,* was to be elected by the majority of Fellows from present 
or past Fellows of the College. But, failing Pembroke men, 
Balliol or University might supply a candidate—a poor compen- 
sation for the legacy which they had lost. The Master was

% The hardship of this arrangement was mitigated in certain cases if, 
as an injunction by Archbishop Laud suggests, one Fellow and 3 Scholars

SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY COLLEGES AND HALLS 275 
expected to be a prudent father of the family: he was not 
bound to celibacy, and he need not be a priest.1 He was to 
be paid twenty pounds a year from the Tesdale endowment and 
ten more from the Wightwicke fund, and to have all the profits 
from letting rooms, admissions, presentations for degrees and 
so forth, which the Principal of Broadgates Hall had formerly 
received.? The Master was to nominate one of the senior Fellows 
to act as his Vice-Gerent. Two Deans or Censors, to see to 
discipline and study, were to be elected yearly by the Master 
and Fellows. Two Bursars, elected in the same way, were to 
draw twenty shillings each yearly, besides commons and fees. 
The College servants were to include a manciple, paid by the 
old Hall system of fees and commissions from tradesmen until 
his salary was fixed, a butler and a cook paid on the same system, 
and others according to the needs of the Society.? The members 
of the College furnished Stewards, who were responsible for the 
quality and prices of the food supplied. 
For the Fellows of Pembroke, sons of the family, each Foun- 
der left regulations of his own. The seven Tesdale Fellows, of 
whom four must be his kinsmen, were to be at least seventeen 
years old, graduates and celibates, who had been Scholars within 
the three preceding years. Elected by the Master and other 
Tesdale Fellows, they were to study theology, to take their 
Master’s degree as soon as possible, and to take Orders within 
three years of that. Each was given twenty pounds a year, but 
lost his place if he obtained an income of forty pounds or a benefice 
outside the University precincts.6 The six Tesdale Scholars 
were to be modest and ingenuous boys, between thirteen and 
nineteen, endowed with sufficient Latin and Greek for their age. 
Two of them were to be poor kinsmen of Thomas Tesdale and 
to draw fifteen pounds a year. Four of them were to be poor 
lads from Abingdon at twelve pounds each. The rules of the 
Wightwicke foundation were rather different. Two Fellows 
and two Scholars were to be of Wightwicke’s kin. One other

Fellow and two other Scholars were to be chosen from Abing- 
don Free School. All could be appointed or removed by the 
| Founder in his lifetime. After his death they succeeded by 
promotion from among the Scholars. Wightwicke Fellows 
received twenty pounds, Wightwicke Scholars only ten pounds 
ayear. Marriage or a cure of souls or an income over ten pounds 
deprived them of their places. All were required by the Statutes 
of 1628 to study theology and to take Orders within four years 
of their Master’s degree. They had also, if they wished to stay 
on in the College, to become Bachelors of Divinity after twenty 
years.1 Ancient Oxford might have passed away, but even 
the Scholars of her youngest College inherited the old tradition 
of celibate devotion to the service of the Church. 
Besides the members on the new foundation the Commoners 
at Pembroke played an important part.? At first indeed, with 
the traditions of Broadgates behind them, they must have been 
much the most important element in the new College. They 
were to be welcomed as guests, to have chambers allotted to | 
them by the Master, and to enjoy all the benefits of College life. 
But for these privileges they were to pay as the Master and 
Fellows decided, or as they had previously paid at Broadgates 
Hall. The Statutes repeated the old familiar rules of discipline. 
Bad language, bad manners, brawls and bearing arms were 
forbidden still. Certain games were still “ un-honest.” Long 
hair was prohibited, decent dress insisted on. ‘“‘ Clothes both 
cover the body and often discover the mind.” ? Striking the 
Master, Vice-Gerent or Deans meant expulsion : fines for striking 
lesser people rose to six and eightpence in the case of shedding 
blood. Incorrigible offenders, the Master himself, might be 
removed. Study was carefully arranged for : ‘‘ in a well-ordered 
family no one can decently be idle.” 4 But funds probably did 
not allow of any great educational endowment, though the old 
terminology was acquiring new meanings, as knowledge developed 
and science awoke. Most of the Prelectors were appointed yearly 
by the Master and paid out of the rents of rooms. Their salaries 
varied from ten shillings to thirteen and eightpence a term. 
There was a catechetical lecture, giving ‘‘ the sum and founda-   1 Statutes (cap. 8). But the Wightwicke Fellows were not required 
to be graduates to begin with. For the differences between the drafts 
of 1624 and 1628, which in their case were material, see Macleane (Hist. 
191-2). 
2 “ Commensales seu comminarii” (Stats. cap. 12). Their predomin- 
ance at Pembroke was always marked. In 1851 out of 73 undergraduates 
7o were Commoners (Macleane, Pemb. 100).

tion of the Christian religion.” There were lectures in College 
for undergraduates on Natural Philosophy, Logic, Rhetoric and 
Greek. There were arrangements for tuition,’ disputations and 
declamations in Hall. The old rule against introducing strangers 
without leave was repeated. And the Chancellor of the Uni- 
versity was made Visitor of the College. Possibly the Society 
had expectations from the great noble, “‘ munificent and child- 
less,” who had given it his name.? 
Lord Pembroke died suddenly on the roth April 1630, as 
Thomas Allen the astrologer of Gloucester Hall had foretold. 
He left no will, only enormous debts, and he gave nothing but a 
“great piece of plate” to the College. Archbishop Abbot, 
Tesdale’s chief trustee, who, it may be, had suggested to him 
the original bequest, lived only three years longer. But before 
his death he did something to atone to the Master and Fellows 
of Balliol for the loss they had suffered under his administration 
of the trust. The Pembroke Fellows went so far as to sue for 
the repayment of the three hundred pounds advanced to Balliol 
from the Tesdale fund. The Lord Keeper Coventry, an old 
Balliol man himself, apparently allowed the plea. Abbot, com- 
forting the Balliol Fellows with the assurance that Jehovah 
Jireh would provide, made himself responsible for the repayment 
of the money—to which the recipients of his generosity may well 
have thought they had an unanswerable claim. But the Fellows 
of the new Foundation needed all they could secure. Dr. Clay- 
ton, the first Master, was a man of resource. Already for four 
years Principal of Broadgates, he was also Regius Professor of 
Medicine, and had previously been Professor of Music in Gresham 
College. As a physician he is said to have cared for the souls 
as well as the bodies of his patients. As a linguist he was one 
to whom even “‘ great Avicenne might speak and be understood.” 
Clayton immediately set to work to raise a building fund and 
to create a College. Several Doctors in his own Faculty were 
induced to subscribe. His sister collected money from merchants 
on London Bridge. Spencers and Andersons and other friends ? 
¥ With a curious reservation of freedom in their studies for the ‘“‘ Com- 
moners of Bachelors and Masters in Arts ’’ (Ib. cap. 15). 
8 The name was already borne by a College founded at Cambridge by 
the widow of an earlier Pembroke, Aymer de Valence. Laud amended the 
Statutes more than once by Injunctions which dealt with questions of 
leave, the admission, seniority and payment of Fellows, the date of taking 
Orders, etc. It is satisfactory to find the Visitor speaking of a possible 
ausplus in 1634 (Jb. pp. 28-31). 
Mr. Macleane finds an ancestress of Washington in this group of 
friends (Pemb. 104). See the names preserved in the interesting duode- 
cimo in the Library, presented to the College, to whom it properly belonged, 
in 1795.  
-P-A-G-E-326
    278 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
contributed. John Pym gave forty-four shillings. James and 
Rouse, both Bodley Librarians, helped. The old Refectory was 
enlarged into the new Hall of the College.1_ A stone quadrangle 
with a tower was planned. Some of the old buildings “ south- 
ward next to Slaying Lane ” were swept away. In a short time 
the West and South sides of a new quadrangle and a part of the 
East side were built. To the North of the Hall Cambey’s Place, 
which had belonged to Principal Summaster and had passed 
later to John Rouse of the Bodleian, was bought for the Master’s 
Lodgings. Before 1630, it seems, all the buildings to the North- 
West fronting on Beef Lane were acquired.? The old Library 
over Docklinton’s aisle in St. Aldate’s, once the Civil Law School, 
was refurnished. And there for a time the scheme of expansion 
stopped. 
But though the building plans were interrupted, the new 
College found other friends. Benefactions flowed in for Scholar- 
ships and Fellowships, beginning with grants for two poor Scholars 
in 1629. Charles I founded a Fellowship at Pembroke, as he 
did at Exeter and Jesus, for natives of Guernsey and Jersey. 
It was part of a plan, suggested by Laud, to introduce sound 
Anglican doctrines among the misguided clergy of the Channel 
Isles. The holder of it claimed the right to wear a silver tassel 
on his cap. King Charles also gave the College the advowson 
of St. Aldate’s. Bishop Morley after the Restoration founded 
five Channel Island Scholarships at Pembroke, also intended to 
further Anglican ideas. Francis Rous, who had very different 
opinions, founded three Scholarships under the Commonwealth 
for his own kindred and for Eton boys. Bennet Scholarships 
and Townsend Scholarships were added later, and two Bennet 
Fellowships? as well. About the year 1670 a gift from Mr. 
James Hoare, helped by the energy of Dr. Hall the Master, gave 
a fresh impulse to building in the College. The East side of 
the quadrangle was finished. The old tenements along the 
South side of St. Aldate’s Churchyard were in part demolished, 
and the North side of the quadrangle was begun. In 1675 Loggan 
published prematurely an engraving showing the quadrangle 
completed, with a Gateway tower in the middle of the North 
1 It is now the Library. 
2 That is, either bought or leased. For the old Halls on this site and 
South of it—Mine Hall, Beef Hall, Dunstan Hall and others—see Mr. 
Macleane’s plan (Pemb. 115). One cannot be certain about the history 
of these old Halls, or say positively when they were first occupied by 
students or when they disappeared. We know, however, that some rooms 
in Beef Hall were used in the 17th century by Pembroke men (Ib. 120). 
% Tenable for 7 years, and for 7 years more in the event of re-election. 
The holders were not bound to take Orders. The 8 Townsend Grammar 
Scholarships were a Gloucestershire foundation of 1683 (Ib. 155-9).

front. This tower, though contemplated, no doubt, was never 
built. Before Loggan’s picture appeared the work was stopped 
for lack of funds, and in 1691, when the North front was finished, 
Loggan’s tower formed no part of the design. But in 1694 a 
tower was added at the West corner, and in the following year 
a new Master’s house replaced the old. Dr. Hall contributed 
generously to these improvements, and his bequest of books 
in the eighteenth century required a new Library to be built 
above the Hall. Pembroke had to wait till that century for a 
Chapel, and till a later century for other changes and additions 
which swept too many of its old features away. The seven- 
teenth-century College was still a small quadrangle, with the 
Master’s quarters extending to the North. To the North-West 
two or three old buildings in Beef Lane survived, known as the 
Back Lodgings in later days. Behind these the College gardens 
ran Southwards to the City wall.? On the other side, towards 
St. Aldate’s Street, a strip of ground parted the College from 
the ancient corner site, where Segrims once perhaps had dwelt, 
and where “‘ the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey ” built 
or rebuilt a Hospital to bear his name.? 
Clayton’s long Mastership was destined to see great events. 
He was one of Laud’s delegates for the reform of the University 
in 1633. He trained his scholars for service in the War. Pem- 
broke, says Wood, supplied fifty officers for the Royal army. 
Clayton and his colleagues contributed their money, if not their 
plate,® to the Royal coffers. Old members disappeared, but 
strangers took their places. Twenty-three women and five chil- 
dren found quarters in the College, and among other visitors 
Sir Edward Nicholas, King Charles’ Secretary of State. But the 
1 The expenditure on building from 1670 to 1699 was £2,261, of which 
the College contributed some {600 (Macleane, Hist. 274). 
2 There were 3 gardens, one for Fellows, on the West, one for the 
Master, and one for Commoners (up to 1732). Loggan’s print which is 
not quite exact, should be compared with Michael Burghers’ copper-plate 
of 1700, 
’ For the history of this famous almshouse, which is still in part 
obscure, see Macleane (Hist. 435-9). Skelton thought it a fifteenth-cen- 
tury building, and his plate (Oxonia, II, 148) shows the South portion as 
ruinous. 
« Mr. Macleane prints Wood’s list (Hist. 235-7). But Wood omits 
Sir Thomas Littleton, M.P. for Worcestershire, an old Broadgates man. 
5 Pembroke is cited (Fourth Report, Hist. MSS. Comm. 467) among 
Colleges which possibly did not give their plate to the King, and the 
College historian finds a “ suspicious entry” of 8s. for mending College 
plate in the Bursar’s accounts for 1655 (Pemb. 127). Still something may 
have gone to the Mint—Wood thought so. There was probably not very 
much, and Pembroke has no plate now given earlier than 1655. At any 
tate the College preserves the King’s letter asking for it,

280 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
members of Pym’s College were clearly not all upon the Royal side, 
and Philip, Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, who succeeded 
Laud as Chancellor, stood high in the favour of the Parliament. 
On the City’s surrender in 1646 a party of Preaching Ministers 
—two fools, two knaves and two madmen, said the Royalists 
—were sent down to prepare for the Parliamentary Visitation. 
Among them was Henry Langley, the son of an Abingdon shoe- 
maker and a Pembroke man, who was soon to sit in the Master’s 
seat. In July 1647 before more evils overtook him, Clayton 
died, and the Fellows, in defiance of Parliament, elected Henry 
Wightwicke to succeed him. Six weeks later Parliament ap- 
appointed Langley instead. In vain Wightwicke protested. 
The majority of the College proved ready to submit. Others, 
perhaps a dozen in all, including four Fellows, the butler and 
the cook, were expelled.1_ The butler, “ honest Will Collier,” a 
hard-drinking Bedel of the Restoration, formed a plot to seize 
the garrison, Visitors and all, and only saved his neck by escap- 
ing through a window. A certain number of new Fellows and 
Scholars were appointed. And under Langley’s government the 
College settled down to serious ways. Numbers increased. 
In 1651 we hear of a hundred and sixty-nine students.* One 
Gentleman Commoner, a child of Belial who had undergone 
conversion, noted the sermons in Hall, the godliness of the Master, 
the ‘‘ Three or Four hopeful religious Lads” who after supper 
would come to his chamber to pray.? Langley had travelled 
far since the days when he was a choir-boy in Magdalen Chapel. 
He fell with his party on the Restoration, and retired to take 
pupils at his house in Bagley Wood. 
Henry Wightwicke came back as Master in Langley’s place. 
He too had changed since the days, nearly half a century earlier, 
when he had headed the Regents’ revolt on the great issue of 
wearing caps in Convocation. But he had not learned modera- 
tion in exile. He reviled the Puritan Chaplain and shocked 
serious minds by reading the Prayer-book in Chapel as if he were 
running a race. He proved “testy, peevish and silly.” He 
1 One cannot be quite sure of the figures. Prof. Burrows (Reg. 539- 
41) gives names of 11 who, he thinks, were certainly expelled, of 21, 
besides the new Master Langley, who submitted, and of 9 Fellows and 
Scholars whom the Visitors appointed. Mr. Macleane’s estimates are 
slightly different (Hist. 227 sg. and Pemb. 132-3). Walker’s statement, 
quoted by Mr. Macleane, and the list given by Burrows (176) suggest that 
the new appointments were more numerous, and possibly the expulsions 
also. (See also Burrows, 40-1, for the answers given by members of the 
College, and 110, 113, 163, 166 and 190). 
2 This is Langbaine’s figure (Found. of Universitie).

smoked and drank with young Bachelors and Masters. His 
preaching, we are told, was ridiculous ; in person he was more 
like a monkey than a Christian. Levity, high-handedness and, 
it may be, worse offences, led to his removal by Clarendon in 
1664. He was succeeded by John Hall, afterwards Bishop of 
Bristol, who held the Mastership for forty-six years and the 
living of St. Aldate’s for forty-three. Hall owed his Fellowship 
to the Visitors of the Commonwealth. But “‘ malapert presby- 
terian ’’ as he had been, he became a Royal Chaplain, and Divinity 
Professor in 1676, and was ranked high among the Whig Low 
Churchmen of a later day. Hall must have had solid qualities 
to account for his success. Under his administration the College 
fully held its own. Its buildings were improved. Its internal 
differences were kept within limits 1—though the manciple was 
allowed to preach in conventicles, an irregularity which some 
High Churchmen found it hard to overlook. But Hall’s wide- 
mindedness may have had its foundation in wisdom. At any 
rate he proved a generous friend to the College in which, regardless 
of his Bishopric, he spent his life. 
Broadgates Hall laid claim to many names of high distinc- 
tion, and Pembroke, though a poor College,? did its best to keep 
the old tradition up. Sir Thomas Browne, so rich in knowledge, 
in imagination and in language delicately wrought, took part 
as a lad of eighteen in the inauguration of the College, no doubt 
with his “natural habitual blush.” A valuable manuscript of 
the Religio Medici is in the College Library to-day. Sir Anthony 
Hungerford, who matriculated with Browne, and who during 
the War was imprisoned and fined, had a house where his name 
lingers yet, by Charing Cross. Thomas Jackson, afterwards 
President of Corpus, loved for his universal charity and considered 
“the ornament of the University in his time,” was one of the 
first Divinity teachers at Pembroke. George Hughes of Corpus, 
the “bright star”’ of Nonconformity in Devonshire, was one 
of the earliest tutors. Sir Thomas Clayton, who succeeded 
his father as Professor, and was afterwards intruded as Warden 
at Merton, has been called a “ poore-spirited fellow ’’ who generally 
preferred the winning side. John Humphreys, on the other 
hand, one of several divines bred in the College who contended 
on one side or other in the great seventeenth-century debates, 
found himself always upholding a lost cause. Thomas and 
Edmund Hall, uncles of the Master, were both Puritan preachers, 
the latter a Captain for the Parliament too. Coysh and Quarter- 
1 The Master’s claim to a veto on the election of Bennet Fellows and 
Scholars caused trouble in 1690 (Macleane, Hist. 263 sq.). 
2 In 1681 it was rated, with Balliol, University, Jesus and Wadham, 
at £100 (Macleane, Pemb. 159).

man were notable physicians. Scroggs, Chief Justice in 1678 
—he had migrated from Oriel to Pembroke nearly forty years 
before—was the most notorious of a group of lawyers which 
included a Wallop and a Yorke. His enemies said that his 
father was a one-eyed butcher and that his mother had an ale- 
wife’s face. Francis Rous, who founded Scholarships, theologian, 
mystic, politician, pamphleteer, became Provost of Eton, Speaker 
of the Little Parliament and a member of Cromwell’s House of 
Lords. Clarendon thought him “thoroughly engaged in the 
guilt of the times,” but it has been suggested that his metrical 
version of the Psalms was possibly his worst offence. Simon 
Harcourt, the lawyer who defended Dr. Sacheverell, the friend 
of Bolingbroke and Pope and Swift,? brought to Pembroke per- 
haps the political opinions which made him a high Tory leader 
in the last years of Queen Anne. A later world has found the 
finest flower of Whig traditions in the descendants who inherited 
his name. Harcourt and Rous are commemorated in the Hall 
by portraits, in the company of the two Founders and of King 
Charles I. 
Pembroke perpetuates one of the most successful of the early 
Halls of Oxford. But the history of those venerable institutions 
can never be completely written now. They were for long one 
of the most distinctive and interesting features of Oxford life. 
Their number, like the numbers of the medizval University, has 
1 Pembroke (140). Mr. Macleane has gathered in his two volumes 
many valuable details about old Pembroke men. The larger one is a 
storehouse of information, on which every later sketch of the College 
history must be founded. But I have to thank the Master and the Bursar 
for their kindness in allowing me to consult the College archives. There 
seem to be no original charters there, and no regular College Register 
beyond the Register of Admissions beginning in 1678. There is a Liber 
Benefactorum of about the same date, but the contributors to the build- 
ings in 1620 are recorded in the duodecimo in the Library already referred 
to. Under the title Registrum Matriculatorum there are several small 
collections of papers, running not quite continuously from 1564, and 
containing extracts from the University Matriculation Books. A solidly 
bound folio volume contains copies of various documents, including the 
Statutes of 1628. The original Statutes of 1624 and of 1628 are there, as 
well as copies of them. There is a Plate Book with a recent list of plate. 
From one book of Bursars’ accounts under the Commonwealth Mr. Macleane 
has quoted some interesting details (Hist. 278-80) : and in regard to the 
eighteenth century we have more information. But the records preserved 
of the earlier history of the College are rather meagre. Boxes in the 
muniment-room contain some early deeds. And one box of semi-private 
letters, relating largely to Mr. Barnes’ resignation of his Fellowship in 
1673, contains signatures by Obadiah Walker. Mr. Macleane has collected 
MS. materials for a real Register of the College. 
2 But Swift’s comments were bitter afterwards, when he thought 
Harcourt meant to trim.

been often over-stated.1 Their names were often repeated and 
changed. It is far from certain that all those claimed as academi- 
cal Halls were used by students. It is not possible to give an 
exact account of them at any given period, or to follow in detail 
their rise and fall. But the references to them in Oxford docu- 
ments, when pieced together, show how far back into antiquity 
their story runs. The Halls generally began as private houses. 
Many took their names from ancient Oxford families like the 
Kepeharms, the Segrims, the Peckwethers and others. Mauger 
Hall, where Walter de Merton is said to have been a student, may 
recall the thirteenth-century owner of a Hall near by.2_ Coventry 
Hall, which stood perhaps on the site of the Roebuck Inn, bore 
the name of an Oxford citizen of the early fifteenth century. 
Berford Hall, which made way for All Souls, took its title from a 
Mayor who figured stormily in earlier days. Tingewick’s Hall, 
close by, was given to the University by Nicholas de Tingewick 
in 1322. Ape Hall, Wood suggests, was named from the owner, 
a burgess called Torald l’Ape.‘ Perilous Hall was mentioned 
by the Abbess of Godstow about 1290.5 Saints’ names are found 
also, but they are not very numerous. Five Halls in Wood’s 
long list were called after St. George and five after St. Thomas. 
Six bore in one form or another the name of Mary, and five 
more the diminutive of Maryol.6 The Nun Halls were once the 
property of Convents. Jacob’s Hall and Moyses Hall obviously 
belonged to Jews, but it is by no means so clear that they ever 
belonged to students.? Spicer’s Hall and Drapery Hall told 
their own origin—a spicer was an apothecary: Wood gives the 
name to four. Swan Halls and Eagle Halls were, no doubt, 
named from the signs over their doorways. Glassen Hall 
and Staple Hall, Chimney Hall and Corner Hall may, or may not, 
sufficiently explain themselves. There are five Corner Halls 
and seven Staple Halls in Wood’s list, besides one in which 
the “‘Stapul”’ was evidently of leads There may have been

(Oseney Ch. 516).

inconveniences mingled with the simplicity and picturesqueness 
which appeal so strongly from those vanished times. 
The older names were naturally the most popular. Some of 
the simpler ones constantly recur. We have traditions of five 
Elm Halls, five Vine Halls, six Deep Halls: and seven or eight 
Shield Halls can be traced.1 Wood speaks of seven Black 
Halls. Wycliffe is stated to have lodged or taught at one. Great 
Black Hall was in Cat Street, and there was a well-known Black 
Hall in St. Giles’. Wood also gives details of nine White Halls.? 
Two at least, a Great and a Little, were swallowed up in Jesus 
College. One, a fifteenth-century house in Castle Street, still 
remains.* And of one other, annexed in the fifteenth century 
to Edmund Hall, we have some interesting little details from 
the records of taxation in 138r. 
“In the first place, the principall’s chamber at the end of the hall 
or refectory was taxed at 7s.; the chamber over the buttery, 5s. ; 
the lower chamber next to the buttery, 3s. 4d.; the upper chamber 
next to the refectory, 6s. ; the lower chamber under it, 3s. 8d.; and 
the lower chamber next to the kitchin, 4s. 4d.; etc.’; besides other 
smaller places in this hall which though they were used as sleping 
places yet they did not come under the accompt.” ¢ 
We have particulars also of eight Halls called Broadgates. One 
of these Wood places in Grandpont, two in St. Aldate’s, two in 
High Street, two in Shidyerd Street, and one near St. Peter-le- 
Bailey. The Broadgates Hall, on the North of the High Street, 
in All Saints’ Parish, belonged in the thirteenth century to the 
Hospital of St. John. Tradition said it had once been a sanc- 
tuary, but no tradition saved it from being pulled down in 
1661. 
Other names were more distinctive. Drowda Hall, the old 
home of William of Drogheda in the High Street, and one of the 
first purchases made with William of Durham’s bequest, reap- 
pears with much bewildering terminology as Droozedayesehalle, 
Drowedes, Doghtur, Drokeda, Drosda, Dugtha and Tredagh.® 
Godknave Hall has more than one derivation: Wood’s is the 
most poetical, the Hall of the servant of God.* Salesurry is a 
term which has puzzled antiquarians who are not content to 
1 Mr. Hurst thinks there were at least 8 (Oxf. Top. 158). 
2 He assigns two to Ship Street, one ‘‘ supra muros ”’ and one “‘ sub

whether they were really different.

call it Salisbury Hall! Fragnon Hall became part of the inherit- 
ance of Exeter. Bedel Hall was annexed to St. Mary’s.? Bos- 
tar Hall and Hare Hall were bought up by Waynflete. Port- 
mannimote Hall or its site beside St. Martin’s was perhaps a 
meeting-place for townsmen long before students ruffled in the 
streets. Billyng Hall, opposite the church of St. Peter-le-Bailey, 
was once the scene of a memorable interview between the Devil 
and a too curious clerk. The Evil One was routed by a passing 
priest who carried the body of our Lord.? Bulkeley Hall, once 
Tackley’s Inn, in High Street became the home of Garbrand 
Herks, the Dutch bookseller, during the Reformation, and a 
meeting-place for Oxford Protestants in Mary’s reign. Its noble 
cellars could hide fugitives yet. Cokewoldes Hall, of uncertain 
site, may or may not have had something to do with the Abing- 
don cooks.4 Filomene and Philomela are scholars’ synonyms 
for Nightingale, and Passerina for the simpler Sparrow Hall. 
Other names, Beef, Veale and Mutton, may not be so simple as 
they seem.5 But Wood’s catalogue of six hundred and sixty- 
nine names is full of duplicates. Only a small proportion of 
them can be placed upon the map. And probably little more 
than a tenth of them were ever flourishing at any one time as 
academic Halls.° 
1 See ante (p. 4, 0.). 2 See Salter (Med. Arch. I, 302). 
2 See Speculum Laicorum (54). * Wood (City, I, 515). 
5 Beef Hall, derived by some from an ox-sign over the door, probably 
drew its name from the family of Bellafago, Beaufo, Beefo (Salter, Med. 
Arch. I, 276). Viel also may have been an old Oxford name. Mutton 
was perhaps a nickname, given by Miles Windsor to St. Michael’s Hall 
close by. See Wood (City, I, 211 and 565-6) and Macleane (Hist. of Pem- 
broke, 38 and 43). 
* In the map of Oxford about 1440, which forms the frontispiece to 
my first volume, I have tried, with Mr. Salter’s skilled help, to assign 
sites to 91 Halls, of which 84 are named by Dr. Clark (Wood, City, II, 
vii—viii). This map, while corresponding generally with Mr. Hurst’s at 
the beginning of vol. II of Wood’s City, owes much toa plan drawn by Mr. 
Salter. It corrects Mr. Hurst’s in some details and it shows the courts 
or gardens of the Halls. Even in regard to these 91 Halls there are many 
elements of doubt; and it is not of course possible to accept as exact 
the much larger number introduced into the map given by Dr. Clark at 
the end of vol. I of Wood’s City, and reproduced by Dr. Rashdall (Univer- 
sities, II, 542-3), or Dr. Clark’s long list in the Topical Index to that 
volume. Detailed references to the old Halls are given in Wood’s City 
(vol. I, Chaps. vii, viii, ix, x, xvi, xvii, xviii and xix). In Chap. xxviii 
Wood gives three draft lists of Halls whose sites he cannot identify, the 
longest of which contains 98 names besides various unnamed ones. And 
in App. B to this volume he gives the Principals of some 130 Halls, going 
back to 1426. The MS. material on the subject in the Bodleian, collected 
by Twyne and Wood and others, is considerable if rather fragmentary. 
Twyne, for instance, has an important list of Halls in his twenty-second 
volume (242-63). Wood D. 7 (1) has lists of Principals of Vine Hall, Urban 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
286 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The earliest Halls of Oxford must have had a character and 
freedom of their own. The picture of boys of about sixteen 
or younger combining for purposes of study and companionship, 
and renting rooms or houses together, is a picture of independence 
which may well rouse envy in the shepherded public-school boy 
of our day. These little democratic societies, with their rules, 
their rivalries, their intense vitality, were for generations the 
academic homes of the majority of Oxford men. They were 
scattered over the town. They spread into the suburbs. But 
their number at any given time is difficult to fix. It would be 
unwise to put it higher than seventy,! with an average possibly 
of ten students in each. Some Halls, no doubt, were larger, 
but some were very small. Some Principals were successful ; 
others failed. As time went on, the need of more discipline and 
supervision was acknowledged. Principals and students alike 
were brought under University control. The regulations of the 
fifteenth century encouraged Students to be attached to Halls 
or Colleges. They insisted on a higher standard of education 
in the Principals. They called on them to attend more closely 
to their duties, to be more particular as to the character of the 
students they took in? And the customs which had long 
regulated their societies were revised. 
The Aularian Statutes of the fifteenth century*® were issued 
at a date when the Halls themselves were rapidly declining, 
and they mark a definite step in the process of applying collegiate 
Hall and several others. Wood F. 28 has notes on the Principals of Vine 
Hall, Broadgates and New Inn taken from the New College accounts 
(ff. 124-5), on Edmund Hall (266 sg. and 306), and on Hart Hall (256 and 
260-4). There are Hart Hall Charters in the Oxfordshire Rolls (No. 26), 
references to Vine Hall, Beam Hall and Staple Hall—to quote only a few 
examples—in the Oseney Charters (492, 494> and 516), and many other notes 
in the Tanner and Rawlinson MSS. and elsewhere. But these references 
are best studied in Mr. Madan’s Rough List of Manuscript Materials for 
Oxford History and in the Calendar of Charters which he quotes. Of this 
calendar it is well to use, if possible, the annotated and corrected copy 
kept at the Bodleian. It may be added that Twyne, and therefore Wood, 
drew largely on the collection made by Nicholas Bishop, an Oxford brewer 
and antiquarian of the fifteenth century. 
1 There may sometimes have been less. But there seem to have been 
over 60 in 1462 (Mun. Ac. 687 sq.: see also ante, vol. I, p. 336). The 
phrase “‘ Principalis inhabitator . . . tam Aularum quam Camerarum ” 
(Mun. Ac. 93) suggests that some of the small hostels may have been little 
more than a set of rooms. 
2 See ante (vol. I, p. 335). 
% An ordinance of Mar. 5, 1490 (not 1489) required these Statutes to 
be read in public by the Principals at least three times a year (Mun. Ac. 
358-9). Dr. Rashdall printed this code from the MS. in the Bodleian 
(Rawl. Stats. 34) in Appendix XXX to his second volume, and it will be 
found at the end of Mr. Gibson’s volume of Statutes.

SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY COLLEGES AND HALLS 287 
discipline to non-collegiate students. In theory the Principal 
was still elected by his boys, but he had become responsible to the 
University rather than to them. Before long he was destined 
to become the Chancellor’s nominee.t But the students retained 
the right to appoint an “ Impositor”’ weekly, to enforce the 
Statutes and to levy fines for their breach,? and the community’s 
authority, as well as the Principal’s, was still needed to expel 
offenders. Every member of a Hall was required to pay honour 
to his Principal, under pain of being expelled and denounced 
to the Chancellor as a rebel. Rules were laid down for religious 
observances, for masses, sermons, bible-reading, grace at meals, 
No one must maintain a heresy which the Principal condemned. 
Rules also were imposed for good behaviour. Un-honest games 
' were disallowed. So were evil gossip, bad language, solitary 
walks, brawls and fisticuffs, dogs and falcons, noctivagations 
and the bearing of arms, breaking into other men’s rooms and 
lying in other men’s beds. There were rules to save the Hall 
precincts from defacement and from dirty habits. There were 
rules for study, lectures, disputations, Latin talk. There were 
rules for meals, for servants, and for paying dues. There were 
tules for fines and in some cases for ‘‘ corporal correction,” to 
be inflicted publicly on Saturday nights. But whippings were 
reserved for boys still under the care of a Master or Tutor—a 
privilege which probably only the richer boys enjoyed. The 
easy independence of the thirteenth century had wholly disap- 
peared. If these rules were kept, it could hardly be contended 
that the students of the fifteenth-century Halls in Oxford had 
much more freedom than the Colleges allowed. 
It may be a question how far the democratic system of the 
earlier Halls had answered. The growth of the Colleges must 
have strengthened the movement towards discipline, and as the 
Halls declined in numbers, the resemblance between the survivors 
and the Colleges, no doubt, increased. But it was in the ancient 
Halls of Oxford, self-governed, unendowed and unincorporated, 
that the medieval University found its strength. The Colleges 
were at first small and privileged communities, separated by 
their Founders’ bounty from the rest. It was only by degrees 
that they found accommodation for the undergraduate Com-

moners who overflow their courts to-day. It was not till the 
fifteenth century was over that the Colleges became the under- 
graduates’ natural home. But they played of course a large 
part in the destruction of their predecessors. Their Founders 
bought up the old Halls. Their new buildings inevitably dis- 
placed them. University absorbed a group of older dwellings 
in the High Street. Merton absorbed not only houses but a 
Parish church. Balliol and Exeter accounted for others just 
outside and inside the North Wall. William of Wykeham made 
a clearance for his great quadrangle. All Souls and Brasenose 
obtained possession of several old Halls in the heart of the town. 
Wolsey swept away relics of the past without reluctance. Cor- 
pus, Jesus and Pembroke carried the tradition of absorption on. 
Changes in Schools Street displaced a considerable number. 
Before Queen Elizabeth died all idea of founding new Halls seems 
to have been abandoned. After the foundation of Pembroke 
only seven remained. And when, some quarter of a century 
later, the Royalist City found herself at the mercy of the Par- | 
liament, only two showed signs of popularity and strength. 
Broadgates before its elevation into a College was one of 
the flourishing Halls of Oxford. But others also in the days of 
Elizabeth, Hart Hall and Magdalen Hall, St. Alban’s and St. 
Mary’s, were well filled. The lists in the first Matriculation 
Register claim no less than ninety-four members for St. Alban 
Hall.2. Hart Hall may have had almost as many. Gloucester 
Hall claimed seventy-three, Magdalen Hall fifty-nine and St. 
Mary’s forty-six. But these figures differ widely from the figures 
of the Commoners on the butlers’ books, given in days when 
religious tests became more rigorous by the Principals to the 
Vice-Chancellor in 1579. St. Alban’s and Hart Hall are credited 
then with only fifty-eight and fifty-four, while the numbers at 
St. Mary's have risen to sixty-eight and those at Gloucester Hall 
have dropped to six. There were evidently large fluctuations,     
    
               
    
        
   
        1 Mr. Hurst estimates (Oxf. Topog. 164) that there were some 19 
Halls in the 14th century ‘‘ mainly on the site of Bodley’s Schools ’’—a| 
figure perhaps to be taken with reserve. 
2 The list includes servants. It is dated about 1572. Mr. Boas 
(Reg. I, xxi-xxv) quotes from Register GG the figures given for certai 
Halls in Aug. 1552. Dr. Clark (Reg. II, ii, 9-44) quotes from Register 
matriculation lists from 1565 to 1573. For Hart Hall three-lists are given 
In his earlier volume (Reg. II, i, 156) Dr. Clark quotes the figures give 
to the Vice-Chancellor in 1579; and the application of religious test: 
(against Romanists), no doubt, accounts for the fall in numbers, especiall; 
at Gloucester Hall. See also the lists given by Dr. Clark for variou: 
dates between 1546 and 1624 (Reg. II, i, 282-294). The more one com:

if the figures preserved are correct. At New Inn Hall we hear 
of forty-nine thembers in 1552. But twenty years later they have 
fallen to twelve. In 1609, when a Principal had to be elected, 
the Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Leonard Hutten, was told that there 
were no Commoners left, and had been none for some years past. 
He admitted some half-dozen new ones to go through the form 
of electing the Chancellor’s nominee.t In 1621 twenty-three 
members of St. Alban’s joined in a Principal’s election: three 
years later on a similar occasion only thirteen appeared. On 
the other hand the matriculations under James I show that 
Magdalen Hall was then exceptionally popular, and that the 
numbers at St. Alban’s, St. Mary’s and St. Edmund’s were 
apparently well maintained.? In the Civil War circumstances 
altered. Numbers must have dropped away. Two Halls 
indeed were conspicuous in welcoming the Parliamentary Visita- 
tion. Magdalen Hall presented fifty-five submissions and New 
Inn Hall a list of forty-one. But Hart Hall offered only four, 
Edmund Hall two and Gloucester Hall one. St. Alban’s and 
St. Mary’s are not mentioned.* The Royalist element must 
have disappeared. Royalists, no doubt, returned after the 
Restoration and probably some years before that. But before 
the end of the seventeenth century the best days of the Halls 
had passed away. 
The records of most of these old societies have vanished. 
Their buildings have been to a large extent destroyed. Even 
Wood confesses that for lack of material he must “‘ stand silent ”’ 
in regard to the worthies whom they trained. But the seven 
Halls which survived Charles I’s accession continued to play a 
part in University life. The Chancellor now nominated the 
Principals, save where the long-established claim of a College 
intervened. The Vice-Chancellor admitted them with the time- 
honoured ceremony of handing them their keys and Statutes. 
But the old form of independent election by the Commoners 
was maintained. And the old traditions were remembered, 
except where time had rendered them obscure. St. Alban Hall, 
or “ Alburne Hall,” had from very early days been an adjunct 
of Merton. Its premises, now the East wing of the College and 
once leased from the Nuns of Littlemore, had become Merton 
1 Clark (Reg. IL, i, 280). 2 And at Gloucester Hall also, if the figures for 1612 given by Twyne 
(XXI, 515) and printed in Wood’s Life (IV, 151) are correct. The average 
number of matriculations annually for the years 1603-1621, swelled by 
the exceptional year 1621, was, according to Dr. Clark’s tables (Reg. II, 
ii, 412-13), about 23 for Magdalen Hall, 11 for Hart Hall, 6 or 7 for St. 
Edmunds, St. Mary’s and St. Alban’s, and something over 3 for Gloucester 
Hall. But New Inn Hall has only 6 matriculations in the 19 years,

property shortly after the Dissolution. Its Principals—Wood 
gives a list from 1437—had for generations been Merton students. 
The most important of them, Richard Fitzjames,1 afterwards 
Warden of the College, is credited with the main buildings of 
the Hall.2- But about the end of the sixteenth century the front 
on the street had to be renewed, and Benedict Barnham, a London 
Alderman and an old member of the Hall, supplied the means. 
His arms, says Wood, were “ engraven in stone over the common 
Gate.” Three-quarters of a century later Loggan shows a well- 
built front with an imposing doorway, with two floors of chambers 
and a line of attics broken by chimneys up above, with a well-treed 
garden to the East and the gable of a Chapel disappearing on the 
West. 
Of the early Principals of St. Alban Hall one, we are told, lived 
to be physician to Queen Elizabeth and another to serve on her 
Privy Council. In that great reign the number of students, 
with Massinger among them, reached high-water mark. Richard 
Zouch, a Civilian of distinction appointed in 1625, survived 
all changes till the Restoration. He was perhaps more promin- 
ent at Doctors Commons, but he was very well known in Univer- 
sity affairs. His successor, Dr. Sweit, was often absent: ‘‘ the 
hall ran to ruine”’ under his rule. Thomas Lamplugh of Queen’s 
followed. He had a wife, Wood comments succinctly, looked 
after preferment, neglected the Hall. He had accepted the 
Covenant though he retained his attachment to the Church. He 
won the favour of the Royalists, passed on to a Bishopric, and 
showed himself there indulgent to Dissenters. He approved 
the courage of the Seven Bishops in 1688, but was quick to offer 
his devotion to the King. He was made Archbishop of York 
by James, but was one of the first to swear allegiance to William. 
Wood thought him “a forward man, allwaies sneaking” : and 
if the judgment was prejudiced, it was not without excuse. The 
Hall did better under his successor, who enjoyed three Archbishop- 
rics in later days.’ Narcissus Marsh had been an undergraduate 
at Magdalen Hall, where he claimed to have fasted regularly 
from Thursday night to Saturday morning. He had been a

in 1514, must not be identified with the famous Bishop, even on the 
authority of Dr. Ingram.

Fellow of Exeter afterwards and ordained by the Bishop of 
Oxford when below the canonical age. “ The Lord forgive us 
both,” he comments, ‘‘ but then I knew no better.” When he 
moved to St. Alban’s in 1673, Marsh made the Hall flourish. 
He restored its discipline. He encouraged its music. He, no 
doubt, stimulated its mathematics and its science. He passed 
on to be Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and ‘‘ was quickly 
weary of 340 young men and boys in this lewd, debauch’d town.” + 
For all his activities in Ireland, he looked back regretfully always 
to the “‘ dearly beloved studies’ of Oxford which he had left 
behind. Under his successor the Hall again “decayed.” But 
it was still sufficiently loyal to light a bonfire for the ‘ breeding ” 
of the Queen in 1688.7 
St. Mary Hall lay in the shadow of Oriel, as St. Alban’s in the 
shadow of Merton and St. Edmund’s in the shadow of Queen’s. 
It had grown up in St. Mary’s Parsonage, when the scholars of 
Oriel found quarters elsewhere. Wood speaks of a court with 
an ancient Refectory on the North side of it and chambers on the 
East. He tells us that “ the forefront ’’ next to Shidyerd Street 
was pulled down in 1447 and rebuilt soon after, and that other 
buildings were erected further South. John Carpenter of Oriel 
contributed to the new buildings, and acquired Bedel Hall, 
another ancient Hall close by, for which Oriel often supplied 
a Principal. The seventeenth century saw a new dining-hall 
with a Chapel above it added. But the eighteenth century 
found the quadrangle too irregular or too ruinous, and a 
great part of it had to be replaced. Wood gives a list of 
Principals of St. Mary Hall from 1436.4 One of the earliest 
of these, Henry Sampson, passed on to be Provost of Oriel. 
Richard Dudley, a benefactor of the College, was made Prin- 
cipal in 1502. Morgan Phillips, who disputed against Peter 
Martyr, was admitted in 1547. William Allen, afterwards 
a Cardinal, succeeded nine years later. Elizabethan changes 
separated the Hall from the College. Numbers leaped up. St. 
Mary’s was apparently the most popular Hall in 1579, or at any 
rate the one with most students willing to accept the necessary 
tests. But the old, close connection with Oriel still remained. 
Ralph Braddyll, who reigned from 1591 to 1632, is credited with

® On the site of Bedel Hall, says Wood (Colls. 674). But Bedel Hall 
survived for some time. Mr. Hurst adds that Bedel Hall was on the site 
of the present Oriel Library (Oxf. Topog. 195-6). Ingram (Memorials, 
vol, II) has not much that is material to add to Wood.

building the first Principal’s Lodgings. John Saunders, his 
successor, passed on to be Provost of Oriel in very difficult times. 
Nicholas Brooks is said to have done the University some service 
by treating with the Commissioners of Parliament. But the 
Parliament brought no special prosperity to the Hall.1_ Thomas 
Cole, a Student of Christ Church, tutor once to John Locke 
and later on to Samuel Wesley, was, contrary to precedent, 
admitted in 1656, and ejected, also contrary to precedent, on the 
Restoration.* Dr. Crowther of St. John’s, who succeeded later, 
was suspected of being a Papist, and died in 1689 a prisoner in 
the Fleet. It did not answer to break the old tradition of choos- 
ing only Oriel men. 
Links as strong perhaps, and also ancient, bound Edmund 
Hall to Queen’s. From Edmund the townsman, not Edmund 
the Saint, who gave it its name under Henry III,? the old house 
by St. Peter’s Church had passed to the Abbey of Oseney, and 
had been let by the monks for the use of students. Queen’s 
did not, apparently, acquire the property till 1557, but the 
College may have had a lease of it at an earlier date. Queen’smen 
repeatedly presided over the Hall. The numbers seem to have 
been only nine in 1552. But they rose to thirty in 1579.5 Under 
James I they kept up well. Twyne estimates them at forty- 
seven in 1612.6 But the end of the Civil War found the Hall 
almost deserted, if the two members who are recorded as submit- 
ting represented its condition then.? After the Rebellion it 
seems to have recovered quickly. But Protestant opinions 
flourished still. In 1678 the Pope was burned in effigy on Guy 
Fawkes’ day.8 We hear of a good many matriculations, of upper 
Commoners, semi-Commoners® and servitors. We hear that   
      
1 Prof. Burrows (Reg. cxxx) estimates that there were about 6 matric- 
ulations in 1638-9 and in 1650-1, and about 4 in 1663-4. But these 
figures must be received with caution. 
2 Wood suggests (Colls. 672) that every Principal before Cole, with one 
exception, was an Oriel man, On Cole and Crowther see Foster’s Alumni 
Oxonienses (vol. I). 
2 Wood (Colls. 660). St. Edmund’s is a common, though scarcely 
an accurate name. Wood mentions also Little St. Edmund’s Hall and

more accommodation was needed : rooms had been let to citizens 
instead.1_ We hear too of some distinguished names, of Thomas 
Littleton, a seventeenth-century Speaker, of John Oldham, 
satirist and poet, and later of Thomas Hearne, who was to bury 
his disappointments there for many years. 
Wood carries the list of Principals of Edmund Hall back to 
1317. Peter Payne, the famous Wycliffite, ruled there in 1410. 
He ruled over White Hall close by as well. Ralph Rudd, we are 
told, under Henry VIII, after a stormy career at Queen’s which 
had led to his expulsion, made himself “‘ principal of a hall called 
Edmund Hall, wherein neither learning nor lesson is frequented.” 2 
Henry Robinson, elected in 1576, was afterwards a well-known 
Provost of Queen’s College. Adam Airay, who carried the Hall 
through the Rebellion—Wood bought some of his books after 
his death—showed himself a sturdy Calvinist: he shared and 
perhaps exaggerated Henry Airay’s opinions. Stephen Penton, 
elected in 1676, contributed generously to the Hall buildings, 
Queen’s claimed the right to nominate the Principals, and estab- 
lished its claim against both Chancellor and students in 1600 
and again in 1636.8 The gateway of Queen’s from a very early 
date overlooked the little premises across the way. Some of 
the fifteenth-century buildings, with the old Refectory and 
chambers, were pulled down, it seems, in the seventeenth century. 
A new dining-hall, with chambers over it, was raised to the North 
of the entrance about 1659.4 A Chapel and Library were built 
after the Restoration. The Chapel was consecrated in 1682. 
The Library above it is the smallest College Library in Oxford,’ 
and with its narrow and difficult approaches by no means one 
of the least picturesque. 
Gloucester Hall and Hart Hall have now grown into Colleges. 
Both had a long and varied history of their own. The House

ations lay amid its streams and meadows well outside the town,*®

Scholars,” which was bought by the Hall about 1672 (Colleges, 668).

  294 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
was a conspicuous Benedictine College. It was not till after the 
Dissolution that it descended to a lower place. Henry VIII 
assigned it to the new Bishop, and as late as the seventeenth 
century the Bishop of Oxford, whose rights had been strangely 
disregarded by Elizabeth, made claims to it which he could not 
enforce. Bishop Corbet in 1629 reopened the old quarrel in a 
characteristic letter. He knew his rights, but he knew also the 
poisonous ways of lawyers.!_ The matter was not finally settled 
till Bishop Bancroft built Cuddesdon Palace. In 1560 the old 
buildings remaining were purchased by the Founder of St. John’s, 
who organised afresh a Hall for students under the patronage of 
his new College, and proposed to call it by St. John’s name.? 
Soon after the installation of the Principal and Scholars the dead 
body of Lady Robert Dudley, better known as Amy Robsart, 
as “secretly brought by night ” to the Hall before the burial 
service at St. Mary’s. But Leicester’s opinions found little 
favour among its occupants, and in the early years of Elizabeth 
Gloucester Hall became, more than any other, a resort of Oxford 
men who adhered to the old Faith. William Stocke or Stocks, 
its first Principal, in animo Catholicus, became President of St. 
John’s. But he resigned that dignity, for fear of deprivation, 
and returned to his former position. Christopher Bagshaw, 
another early Principal, nominated by Leicester as a Protestant, 
became a Roman priest. It was as a refuge for Catholics that 
Gloucester Hall was so well filled in 1572.8 But the numbers 
then were swelled by lodgers, including, it seems, fourteen knights 
and one Archdeacon, who could have had little in common 
with the undergraduate world. Distinguished Romanists found 
shelter in the Hall. Sir William Catesby, father of the con- 
spirator, who was himself a member of the Hall, was living there 
with his wife in 1577. Lady Catesby had a daughter born in 
the Principal’s lodgings. Other ladies occupied apartments. 
Two widows died there in 1616.4 It was no wonder if suspicious 
Protestants cavilled at the doings in the Hall,5 and if active

a reference to “‘ Statuta Aule Glocestriensis, facta (ut videtur) 1560 : 
Twyne, XXI, 206.” But Twyne’s note is only a very brief account of 
the foundation: and I do not find the reference in Wood’s Colleges at 
639. 
* The Matriculation list gives 73 members (Clark, Reg. II, ii,

measures taken against Romanists immediately affected its 
numbers. 
But even at Gloucester Hall there were Protestants, and 
perhaps zealous Protestants, among the younger students.? 
After 1579 numbers rose rapidly again. Principal Delabere 
was exceptionally popular. But under his successor the Hall 
may have declined once more.’ It certainly came near to being 
refounded as Wadham College. Degory Wheare, a friend of 
Thomas Allen the astrologer, was already Camden Professor of 
History when he was appointed Principal in 1626. Esteemed 
by some “a learned and genteel man, by others a Calvinist ’— 
his Latin treatise on the study of history long survived the 
worries of his life—Wheare proved for a time a successful ruler. 
He took in hand the College buildings.4 He finished the new 
Chapel; John Pym gave twenty shillings towards it; his son 
was apparently a member of the Hall. A new Library was 
collected also. Wood was “‘ credibly enformed”’ that a hundred 
students gathered round the Principal, and it seems that the 
matriculations steadily went up. Some of the students were 
“persons of qualitie: 10 or 12 went in their doublets of cloth 
of silver and gold.”’5 Some of these fine gentlemen, no doubt, 
supplied soldiers for the King. But Wheare must have seen his 
numbers fall sadly before he died in 1647. Tobias Garbrand, 
“alias Herks,’’ appointed Principal after Wheare’s death,® is 
the only member of the Hall recorded as submitting to the 
Parliamentary Commission. He came of stout Nonconformist 
ancestry—his great-grandfather, the Dutch bookseller in Oxford, 
had been a friend of Jewel and the early Reformers—but he 
found few Nonconformists there to rule. His successor, a medical 
man like himself, collected a few undergraduates round him,

altogether bear out Mr. Daniel and Mr. Barker’s view: and Twyne gives 
the high figure of 62 members at Gloucester Hall in 1612 (XXI, 515). 
4 There is an interesting description of the College property taken over 
in 1560. It includes a Hall (60 ft. x 30) with a building adjoining, seven 
chambers (each 16 ft. x 12), several small groups of buildings or lodgings, 
a base court (80 ft. x 60), “‘ the soil of the late church” (40 ft. x 20), 
the site of other lodgings “lately wasted and fallen down,” and parcels 
of garden, orchard and meadow land (Worc. Coll. 91-2).

and produced a play in honour of the Restoration. But his 
reign was short. Numbers increased again for a time under 
Principal Eaton, Archdeacon of Stow, though Wood says he 
never knew many members in the Hall.1_ But the buildings 
were falling into disrepair. In 1676 Dr. Prideaux notes that 
there are no scholars left. Wood adds that “ onlie the principall 
and his family and two or three more families . . . live there in 
some part to keep it from ruin.”” The paths in 1678 were grown 
up with grass. The way into the Hall and Chapel was “ nailed 
up with bords.” * But that did not prevent burglars from 
breaking in in 1687, stealing the Principal’s plate and his 
daughters’ “ petticotes’”’ and jewels, and drinking the young 
ladies’ healths before they carried off their spoil. Loggan has 
preserved a picture of the buildings in the days of their decline. 
Hart Hall, Aula Cervina in academic Latin, also had a pic- 
turesque career before it attained the dignity of a College. It 
was one of a little group of Halls which about the end of the 
thirteenth century stood on the site of Hertford College, near 
Smith Gate and the North Wall of the town. It took its name 
from a certain Elias of Hertford, who seems to have bought a 
house in Oxford in 1283, and to have let it out to clerks as an 
investment. A hart’s head, the device he used, suggested a sign 
for the Hall and arms later for the College. Hart Hall fronted 
Northwards on to Hammer Hall Lane, better known as New 
College Lane to-day. It had Black Hall to the West and Shield 
Hall to the East, and Arthur Hall, which soon became a part 
of it, behind.¢ Arthur Hall had an entrance upon Cat Street, 
and Cat Hall lay a little further to the South. From Elias’ son 
Hart Hall passed to John Docklinton, whose name is linked 
with Broadgates too, and from Docklinton Bishop Stapledon 
bought it in 1312 as the first home for his scholars. It was let 
to other students later, and the rent paid to Exeter College. 
New College scholars also lived here for a time, while William of 
Wykeham was building his great quadrangle. New College men 
figure in the list of Principals: Cranley, who became Arch- 
bishop of Dublin in 1397, is conspicuous among them. And 
the connection with New College continued, though in the fif- 
1 Not above 14 since the Restoration (Life, II, 398). Mr. Daniel and 
Mr. Barker give 12 matriculations in 1667 and 14 in 1669 (Worc. Coll. 
117), which seems high. The number must soon have fallen.

« Black Hall, long rented by Exeter College from the University, was 
finally brought under the same Principal as Hart Hall in 1530. Before 
the Dissolution Hart Hall had absorbed all itsimmediate neighbours. (See 
Mr. S. G. Hamilton’s valuable little history of Hertford College, to which 
I am much indebted, Chap. I). An early account of the Hall, “ ex 
archivis colligij Exon,’ > is given in Wood F. 28 (260 sq.).

teenth and sixteenth centuries the Hall was ruled and managed 
chiefly by Exeter men. Exeter scholars came to it for lectures, 
and for several generations Exeter men found teachers there. 
Gilbert Kymer,? appointed Principal about 1412, was the well- 
known Chancellor who turned Duke Humphrey’s friendship to 
such good account. He was not a member of Exeter, but he may, 
like William of Worcester, have been a scholar of the Hall. The 
fifteenth century brought an endowment—Exhibitions founded 
by Sir John Bignell, for the maintenance of ten scholars at Hart 
Hall by Glastonbury Abbey. One Principal of those days had 
to be specially forbidden to go hunting the King’s deer. Another 
was killed in a brawl in the High Street in 1506. Another, Philip 
Rondell, Principal for nearly half a century after 1549, gave a 
fresh importance to the Hall. He made it, like Gloucester Hall, 
a refuge for adherents of the old religion. There was no Chapel 
to draw attention to the form of worship they preferred. Rondell 
restored the buildings, built a dining-hall, a buttery and 
chambers : Agas reproduced them in the Elizabethan age. Under 
Rondell the number of students increased largely. There seem 
to have been seventy, there may even have been ninety, in 1572.4 
The Hall became independent of Exeter. The Chancellor 
undertook to provide it with a Principal. Leicester was chiefly 
responsible for providing it with a Divinity Lecturer, in the person 
of Corrano. But the Rector and Fellows of Exeter still claimed 
their rights as landlords and levied a rent of thirty-three shillings 
and fourpence a year. 
John Eveleigh, the Principal who succeeded Rondell in 
1599, lived outside the Hall with a wife and a family and died 
of the plague in 1604. Theodore Price who came over from 
Jesus, breaking the Exeter tradition, was charged like Rondell 
with being ‘“‘ at heart a Papist” ; but he died in an honourable 
position in the Church. We have an interesting note on the 
establishment of Hart Hall in his day.’

a rather curious incident, did not of course make the Hall “‘ a colony of 
the Monastery of Glastonbury,” as Twyne and Wood, who follows him 
(Colls. 643), suggest. A note on the question which arose in 1664 on these 
Glastonbury Exhibitions will be found in Wood F. 28 (f. 256).

Some thirty Commoners were summoned in 1622 to elect 
Dr. Iles as Price’s successor. Iles and Parsons, who followed 
him, were amenable to the authority of Laud, though scandal 
said that Iles was not “in a capacity ever to study in a morning 
without a cup of ale.”’ 2 But the Civil War must have emptied 
the Hall. Only four members are recorded as making submission 
to the Parliament ; one of them was the cook, who had replaced 
the “ cookesse” of whom we hear in earlier days. A Puritan 
Principal was admitted in 1653—appointed by patent by Oliver 
Cromwell, perhaps because there were no Commoners to elect. 
Doctor of Physic and Captain of Horse, Stephens restored the 
life of the Hall, and recovered for it the Glastonbury Exhibitions 
which had been lost. But he had to make way for a Royalist 
later on. Dr. Lamphire was Principal for a quarter of a century 
before the Revolution, a droll fellow, “‘ much given,” said gossip, 
“to his pleasures.”” He found or left discipline lax. The Hall 
doors, it was asserted, were open all night. Yet Lamphire was 
a man of some character and public spirit. He worked in certain 
by-ways of history, and he helped to fill up the ponds of Candich.# 
The seventeenth-century Principals added to the buildings. 
Dr. Price built Lodgings which were afterwards put to other uses. 
Dr. Iles built a new kitchen, with chambers over it, and a small 
block of chambers to the North of the passage into Cat Street.

College Street, which had been leased to townsmen. It passed 
again into the occupation of members of Hart Hall, together 
with the flimsy “ paper-building,” raised on wooden pillars, 
which Loggan represents. A Maypole stood in the street beyond. 
Loggan has left a charming little picture of the low buildings 
ranged about the court within.t 
Magdalen Hall in the days of Tyndale had already found a 
place in history. It prospered under Elizabeth, and in the 
seventeenth century, true to its Protestant traditions, it went 
rapidly ahead.?_ The name, first bestowed on the earliest home 
of Waynflete’s Scholars, was applied from the beginning of the 
sixteenth century to the Grammar Hall and the buildings about 
it, which grew up outside the gates of Magdalen College, and to 
which students in considerable numbers were attracted by the 
great grammarians of the College School. The College owned 
the site of the Hall, received its rent, and supplied most of its 
early rulers. But it had no jurisdiction over the Hall students. 
And when towards the close of the seventeenth century the 
Fellows tried to assert against the Chancellor a claim to nominate 
the Principals, the claim was defeated in a Court of Law.? The 
list of early Principals contains some well-known names. John 
Stokesley, who played a conspicuous part in the early quarrels 
of the Magdalen Fellows, became afterwards Bishop of London. 
John Longland, Bishop and Chancellor, may have been too 
ready an instrument of Henry VIII. Burgess and Coveney 
were elected Presidents of Magdalen College. Robert Lyster’s 
tenure covered most of the reign of Elizabeth. His successor, 
Dr. Hussee, must have seen Thomas Hobbes enter the Hall in 
1603,5 where, tradition says, he preferred the snaring of jackdaws 
to the educational methods of his day. Students increased. 
There were sixty Commoners in 1579. There were large entries 
in the years which followed.* In 1612, if the figures be correct, 
1 The gateway in Cat Street and the Library above it were built by 
Principal Thornton (1688-1707). The returns for the Hearth Tax of 
1665 indicate that some chambers in Hart Hall were then let to non- 
academical tenants (Rogers, Oxf. City Docts. 77). 
2 Dr. Clark estimates that 283 students matriculated at Magdalen 
Hall in the seven years from 1615 to 1621 (Reg. II, ii, 413). 
* In 1694. The claim was made but not pressed in 1681. 
« John Burgess, says Wood (Colls, 686), was President of the College 
first. But his election as President in 1527 was promptly set aside by 
Wolsey (see Wilson’s Magd. Coll. 69-70). 
® See the paragraph inserted by Wood in Aubrey’s Life (Brief Lives, 
ed. Clark, I, 330). 
* Dr. Clark gives 52 matriculations in 1581 (Reg. II, ii, 413). Twyne 
makes the Hall total 161 in 1612 (KXI, 515). Prof. Burrows puts the 
matriculations at 40 in 1638-9, at 30 in 1650-1, and at 21 in 1663-4 (Reg. 
of Visitors, cxxx). 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
300 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the matriculations leaped up to a hundred and thirteen. The 
Hall became less dependent on the College and eclipsed it for a 
time in popularity. And John Wilkinson, appointed Principal 
in 1605, carried its fortunes to their highest point. 
Under John Wilkinson Exhibitions for students were created. 
New rooms were needed. New quarters were built. Wood | 
says that he added five blocks of chambers at a cost of three | 
thousand pounds. But of these enterprises the picturesque 
little building still known as the Grammar Hall alone survives. 
The Hall was recognised as the head-quarters of the Puritan 
party, and as such played a great part in Oxford life. The 
tradition that three hundred students gathered round John 
Wilkinson—it is difficult to see where such a number could have 
lodged—is at least an indication of its importance and success. 
The Puritan Principal, who must surely at his best have been 
something different from the “illiterate, testy old creature” 
whom Wood describes, was displaced in the War by a King’s 
man, Dr. Read, who afterwards became a Roman priest. John 
Wilkinson returned after the surrender of the City, but was made 
President of the College in 1648. His influence may be seen 
perhaps in the fifty-five submissions to the Parliament received 
from members of the Hall. Henry Wilkinson succeeded him. 
“Dean Harry,” as they called him, was a man of character and 
breeding. But he made no secret of his views. He entertained 
Cromwell. He “‘ prayed hard for the army.” He had to leave 
when, after the Restoration, the Act of Uniformity was passed. 
Clarendon visited the Hall and inconsiderately told him that he 
maintained “‘ not only factious but debauched schollers’’—a 
poor return for the Principal’s compliments of cake and cheese.? 
James Hyde—a significant name—replaced him, and on Hyde’s 
death the Magdalen Fellows claimed the right to appoint. In 
1694 they raised the point again without success. The existence 
of a separate community on their ground but beyond their juris- 
diction was for long a source of disquiet to the College. It was 
probably a relief to both sides when the changes of the early 
nineteenth century enabled the College to recover its site and 
the Hall students to find quarters elsewhere. 
New Inn Hall was a smaller Society. But it survived with 
some of its venerable buildings into recent times. Writing early 
in the seventeenth century, Leonard Hutten described its position 
thus : 
“From St. Ebb’s Church directly before us looking towards 
Bocardo, wee see on our right hand those poore Tenements, called 
the Seaven deadly Sinns, and the Back sides of St. Marie’s Colledge,

and those Houses which are in the Corne Markett ; on the left, the ; 
Hall called New Inn, with poore Tenements and Gardens till you 
come to Bocardo.” + 
New Inn Hall Street has borne many names. Before the 
twentieth century it had two branches, one running West from 
the Cornmarket near St. Michael’s Church,? the other running 
South at right angles to it. Now the South branch only keeps 
the title of the Hall, which stood at a corner on its Western side. 
Wood traces the descent of the original Inn from the Pennards, 
burghers of Oxford, to the Trillecks, whose name it acquired. 
In the fourteenth century, Trilleck’s Inn was bought by William 
of Wykeham, and in 1391 the Bishop granted two messuages 
called Trilleckynnes with three gardens adjoining, and one 
messuage called Rose Hall with one garden adjoining to the 
Warden and Scholars of New College.4 We hear of repairs done 
to the buildings, to the Chapel and great chambers, before the 
century closed. We hear of the White Monks renting them or 
part of them soon after. We have notes of a new edifice early 
in the fifteenth century, and of Rose Hall ceasing to pay rent.® 
Wood speaks of the fabric being rebuilt about the end of Henry 
VI’s reign and taking then the title of New Inn. But none of 
these details must be too positively stated. Parts of the medi- 
eval buildings, dating back apparently to the thirteenth century, 
long survived. A Tudor block may have been erected beside 
them : two of its windows could be traced in 1893. A “‘ Palladian 
structure’ was added later on.? Loggan’s drawing made in 
Charles II’s reign was recognisable for generations later. But 
all traces of its time-worn picturesqueness have vanished from 
the street to-day. 
Wood gives a list of Principals beginning in 1438. Lawyers, 
1 Mr. Hurst, commenting on this passage, gives an interesting account 
of the site and buildings of the Hall (Oxf. Topog. 79 and 86-9). 
2 This passes the Union buildings and is now called St. Michael Street. 
In old days it ran from Bocardo under the North Wall and was called 
Bedford Lane, after a large householder, and sometimes Wood Street 
from the timber-yards in it. 
* New Inn Hall Street or North Bailey Street, with the Little Bailey 
at its South end, was sometimes called the Lane of the Seven Deadly 
Sins. See Mr. Hurst’s diagram (87), which differs a little from Dr. Clark’s 
map at the end of vol. I of Wood’s City, and Salter’s Historic Names of 
Oxford Streets (12-13).

but have of course no more authority than Wood’s published statements.

New College men and Welshmen figure among them. Law 
students and Welsh students may have been conspicuous in the 
Hall. Wood states that under Mary and Elizabeth the Hall 
was very sparsely filled. But a University Register assigns it 
forty-nine members in 1552,1 and it seems reasonable to accept 
the statement that it contained twelve members twenty years 
later.2 In 1609 the Commoners are stated to have vanished.? 
But in 1612 Twyne allows the Hall seventeen, with a total of 
thirty members. In 1622 there were fewer again,® and there 
are very few matriculations recorded under James I. Sir Daniel 
Dunn of All Souls was at one time an Elizabethan Principal. 
John Budden, the civilian and the biographer of Waynflete and 
of Morton, elected Principal in 1609, left to be Head of Broad- 
gates later. Christopher Rogers, appointed in 1626, a leading 
Puritan in the University, is said to have “‘ fled to the Parliament 
Party.” His students apparently deserted too, and the King 
established his Mint in their empty quarters. The numbers 
assigned to Rogers’ day—twenty-four matriculations yearly 
about 1638—and the forty-one reputed submissions to the 
Parliament in 1648 show how largely the Hall had become, like 
Magdalen Hall, a Puritan centre. William Durham, the bio- 
grapher of Dr. Robert Harris, the Puritan President of Trinity, 
was perhaps a type of the students then. Rogers returned with 
his friends and pupils. But he had to leave again in 1662. John 
Lamphire ruled at New Inn Hall for a few months before passing 
on to Hart Hall. But he could hardly have exercised. much 
influence over its fortunes. The numbers, however, kept up: 
the annual average of matriculations is stated at nine. William 
Stone, Lamphire’s successor, was suspected of being a Papist. 
But he was one of the first to appreciate the value of Wood’s 
historical work.? The old Hall throve. It was destined to 
continue, and to play its part in Oxford for generations yet.

CHAPTER XVII 
ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 
ORD PEMBROKE’S sudden death in April 1630 startled 
and disappointed the academic world. It was said that 
the University of Oxford had hoped to be his executor 
and Pembroke College his heir. Few men, in spite of some 
notorious failings, held a greater place in the estimation of their 
age. A Mecenas whom all the world of letters honoured, a 
patron whose generous magnificence helped, among many lesser 
men, Ben Jonson, Chapman and Inigo Jones, a friend whom 
Shakespeare may have cared for, Pembroke in his splendid 
youth, “‘ swaggering it ’’ among the men of war and wealth and 
pleasure, had found himself ‘“‘ exceedingly beloved.” In politics 
he had independence enough to rouse King James to trepidation, 
courage enough to bear the enmity of Buckingham and to win 
the gratitude of the House of Commons. And if his later years 
brought some sense of disillusion, of wasted opportunities and 
wasted health, he never lost the fame acquired by a certain 
stateliness and integrity of purpose, but remained “the very 
picture of nobility ’’ in the eyes of many besides Anthony Wood. 
On Pembroke’s death there was a contest for the Chancellor- 
ship. Laud’s friends ‘ bestirred themselves in his behalf.” 
Juxon rallied the members of his old College. Frewen hurried 
back from Hampshire to support him. But Laud had enemies 
as well as friends in Oxford. The Calvinist tradition was not 
broken yet. Bishop Williams of Lincoln, one of the shrewdest 
ecclesiastical politicians of his day, threw all his influence against 
“the little meddling hocus pocus ” 1 whom he cordially disliked. 
Pembroke’s brother and successor, a great noble like him, was a 
formidable rival even to the Bishop of London. And though 
the scrutiny of votes declared Laud to be elected, there were 
not wanting partisans who insisted that Lord Pembroke and 
Montgomery had a larger party on his side.2 God knew, said 
1 The phrase, which led to a vindictive sentence in the Star Chamber, 
was used by Osbaldeston, Master of Westminster School, in a letter found 
in Williams’ house. 
2 Even Wood treats the suggestion as an open question (Aun.II, 368-9). 
An appeal to the King against the election of Laud is quoted in Bodley MS. 
Tanner 82 (f. 301). 
303
-P-A-G-E-360
  304 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Laud, that he had little expected the honour. He treated it 
as an urgent call to University reform. 
Times had changed since Laud and his opinions had been 
openly rebuked in Oxford. The Calvinists were losing their 
ascendency. The King’s warm support, and the Primacy which 
followed, made the new Chancellor’s authority difficult to resist. 
But Laud’s intellectual position was always that of a minority, 
even among the ministers of the Church. His views were often 
large, his zeal for right undoubted, his hatred of intolerance in 
other men sincere. But his own unbending nature, his rigorous 
sense of discipline, his love of power, his impatience of opponents, 
his genuine astonishment at the ‘‘ clamours and slanders” with 
which he was assailed, led him into harsh and narrow courses, 
to enforce the uniformity and order in which he passionately 
believed. The rival schools were only too ready to attack each 
other. A statesman might have tried to reconcile them. Laud 
brought their quarrel to a head. Robert Abbot of Balliol and 
Dr. Airay of Queen’s, who had been at one time his chief critics 
in Oxford, had both passed away. But Abbot’s son-in-law, 
Nathaniel Brent, maintained the same tradition at Merton, 
though his influence was probably diminished by his frequent 
absence upon legal business. Dr. Prideaux of Exeter was still 
the leading representative of Protestant opinions, justly honoured 
for his character and learning, and the most popular teacher in 
the Oxford of his day. He could not always repress his impa- 
tience with the doctrines advocated by the newer school. But 
Prideaux, no doubt, wished to keep on terms with the Chancellor 
and to preserve the favour of the King. Other Heads of Colleges, 
Kettell at Trinity, Hood at Lincoln, Radcliffe and some of his 
Fellows at Brasenose, professed little sympathy with Laud’s 
opinions and perhaps made no secret of their own. Wilkinson 
and Rogers gathered Puritans round them at Magdalen Hall 
and New Inn Hall. But the weight of authority in Oxford 
leaned more and more to the new Chancellor’s side. Frewen of 
Magdalen and Jackson of Corpus used their great influence on 
his behalf. Brian Duppa enforced his views of ritual in the 
Cathedral church. Juxon, one of Laud’s chief friends and 
correspondents, handed over St. John’s College to Baylie, an 
equally reliable adherent, when he succeeded to the Bishopric 
of London. Mansell at Jesus was a devoted Loyalist and 
Churchman. Christopher Potter of Queen’s, who had shed some 
Calvinist opinions, appeared in the same ranks. Smyth of 
Wadham and Clayton of Pembroke served under Laud without 
reluctance. Sheldon was rising to power at All Souls. Dr. 
Pinke of New College, ‘“‘ the flower of Wykeham’s garden,” and 
more than once Vice-Chancellor, was as ready as Duppa or
-P-A-G-E-361
ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 305 
Baylie or Frewen to use that position to promote the Chancellor’s 
ideas. 
One of Laud’s first measures was to ask the Vice-Chancellor 
for a weekly report on events in Oxford. He knew that the 
Statutes, which “had lain in a confused heap for some ages,’ 
badly needed revision. He found that “ formalities, which are 
in a sort the outward and visible face of the university,” were 
neglected alike in the Schools, in Convocation and in the streets. 
He found some of the sermons preached little to his liking. He 
found order and reformation very much required. He was 
anxious not to be “ too sour ’’ at the beginning.1_ But the sermons 
soon became a source of trouble. An Exeter man had preached 
against obeisance and reverence in churches. An Oriel man had 
laid an aspersion upon the Synod of Dort. Doctrines which the 
King had forbidden his subjects to discuss were openly debated. 
Imputations of ‘‘ apostacy and backsliding ’’ were fastened on 
eminent persons, whose identity it was impossible to doubt. 
A movement of insubordination, supported, it was said, by Dr. 
Prideaux and the Proctors, “ stirs not of an ordinary nature ”’ 
which struck at the very root of government, startled the party 
in power. Thomas Ford of Magdalen Hall, Giles Thorne of 
Balliol and William Hodges of Exeter denied the Vice-Chancellor’s 
right to act as censor of their sermons. Ford, when ordered to 
prison, refused to go. The matter was carried to the King at 
Woodstock in August 1631, and Charles and Laud gave six 
hours to its consideration. The Proctors were made to resign 
for “countenancing all manner of disobedience.” The three 
offending preachers were expelled. Prideaux and Wilkinson 
were sharply reprimanded. Richard Hill of Brasenose and 
Francis Hyde of Christ Church, ex-Proctors who were said to 
have encouraged the mutineers, were forced to apologise for 
their “damned spirit of opposition ’’ against “ authority and 
the breath of heaven.” Hodges, when pardoned, hoped the 
world would forget him when he forgot to be grateful to Laud.” 
In the meantime he married Prideaux’s daughter. Satirical 
verses, supposed to emanate from Jesus College, mocked at 
“the Academicall Army of Epidemical Arminians.’’ But the 
new Chancellor’s authority was thenceforth secure. 
Prideaux may have accepted the warning. But he found the 
1 See his letter of 7 May 1630. His History of his Chancellorship in 
vol. V of Parker’s edition of his Works, 1853, is an authority of the first 
importance. 
2 Ford refused to submit and became afterwards a Puritan divine. 
Thorne, Wood says, submitted but was not restored. (See Ann. II, 
379, and Laud’s Works, V, 70, n.). William Hobbes of Trinity was 
brought before the Vice-Chancellor for a sermon at St. Mary’s and com- 
pelled to recant his errors soon after: and there were other cases.

  306 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
old Adam hard to resist. At the Vespers in July 1633 one of 
the disputants raised questions on the authority of the Church, 
and tempted Prideaux to intervene with propositions which, 
perhaps indiscreetly stated, gave his enemies a chance. The 
Professor of Divinity was reported as saying that the Church 
was a mere chimera which taught and determined nothing, that 
all controversies were better referred to the University, and 
that learned academicians could determine them even without 
the intervention of Bishops.t Prideaux was also said to have 
broken out fiercely, and to have declared that his mouth was 
shut by authority, or he would have maintained the truth against 
any man alive—‘‘ which fetched a great hum from the country 
ministers that were there.’ King and Chancellor conceived 
themselves bound to ask for explanations. Prideaux had to 
dispose of a damaging report. He protested that the passages 
quoted, “‘ imperfectly catched at by the informer,” were obviously 
no positions of his. He regarded them as “‘ impious and ridicu- 
lous.” They were merely theories stated for refutation in 
debate. He pleaded, with a force and sincerity which con- 
founded his accusers, that he had rendered as much as any man 
faithful service and reverence to the Church. For eighteen 
years as Professor in Oxford he had constantly defended its 
discipline and doctrine. He would maintain them always, under 
his Majesty’s protection, against Papists and Puritans alike. 
He asked that his sons, the students whom he nurtured, might 
not be encouraged to “‘ vilify and vex ” him in his declining days. 
And he concluded with an assurance of his loyalty to the King, 
his only master, to the Bishops, the State and his Majesty’s 
affairs, which perhaps convinced the Chancellor that, for all his 
independence, the Rector of Exeter could be and ought to be 
treated as a friend. 
Matters of ecclesiastical controversy were rarely wanting in 
those troubled years. University sermons were often a cause 
of complaint. One preached by Richard Kilby of Lincoln in 
1638 was defended by the preacher with the ingenious argument 
that he had preached it in St. Mary’s sixteen years before and 
that it had then met with general approval. One day a too 
zealous Puritan tutor, John Oxenbridge of Magdalen Hall, was 
found guilty of a ‘‘ superstitious way of dealing with his scholars.” 
Another day Henry Birkhead of Trinity College was ‘‘ seduced 
by a jesuit” and carried to St. Omer. But Laud recovered 
the truant and made him a Fellow of All Souls. The Chancellor 
was equally successful in rescuing his godson William Chilling- 
worth, an Oxford boy, “ the readiest and nimblest disputant in 
the university,’ who had been drawn into the Roman com- 
2 “ Etiam sepositis episcopis ” (see Laud’s Works, V, 87 sq.).

munion by his longing for an infallible Church. Laud’s letters 
to Chillingworth at Douai, and, no doubt, the fallibility of the 
system which he found there, induced the convert to return to 
Oxford, and to seek for truth again outside the Roman Church. 
It is a sign of Laud’s respect for Prideaux that in 1637 he asked 
the Rector of Exeter to revise Chillingworth’s famous book.* 
At another time the Chancellor is found anxiously inquiring 
whether any Jesuits were ‘‘ hankering up and down ”’ at Oxford. 
The Vice-Chancellor immediately set a scholar to spy upon one 
gentleman concerned. In 1639 Laud again warned the authori- 
ties to be very careful; “for while none of you think it, the 
jesuits and their instruments are busy thereabouts.’’ A young 
youth of Exeter had fallen. The young organist of St. John’s 
had “ slipt away.” In 1640 he reported to the Council that the 
Mitre had become a meeting-place for recusants. There was a 
suspicious back way in. He noted, on the other hand, the 
peevishness of Brasenose Puritans ; but he advised the authori- 
ties to take no notice of them. Once we find him suggesting 
to the Bishop of Winchester that the excessive study of Calvin’s 
Institutions might be the reason why New College Scholars so 
rarely became eminent men, In the last days of Laud’s 
authority Henry Wilkinson of Magdalen Hall * was suspended 
for ‘a very base and factious” sermon against the Church 
ceremonial which the Archbishop approved. 
Chillingworth had found within a short journey of Oxford 
friends who perhaps could help him in his difficulties better 
even than the head of the English Church. While Laud was 
sparing neither himself nor others in his strenuous quest for order 
and improvement, Oxford men of a different and a happier 
temper had formed the pleasant habit of gathering round Lord 
Falkland at Great Tew. Fortune and circumstance, helped by 
his own generous instincts, had already given to that young 
nobleman a special place in the society of his day. The house 
in the Cotswold uplands which his grandfather had bequeathed 
to him, and which his hospitality for years made famous, has 
long since disappeared.? Only the peace and beauty of its site 
remain, the ancient church, the ancient elms and limes, the 
high-walled gardens, where poets and wits from London some- 
times wandered, where Edmund Waller, “ nursed in parliaments ” 
from boyhood, may possibly have listened to Ben Jonson, the

2 “Long Harry,” afterwards Canon of Christ Church, must be dis- 
tinguished from “‘ Dean Harry,” later Principal of Magdalen Hall. The 
sermon was entitled ‘‘against Lukewarmenesse in Religion.” (See 
Thomason’s Tracts, E. 204. 7).

Nestor of a greater age. Jonson and Suckling and Cowley later 
were as ready to sing Falkland’s praises as Clarendon himself. 
The men of fashion in Falkland’s circle generally had their serious 
interests. George Sandys, a gentleman of King Charles’ Privy 
Chamber, not only translated Ovid, but paraphrased the Psalms. 
Wenman and Godolphin had time for politics and letters. 
Kenelm Digby was a man of vivid if variable religion. Even 
Suckling wrote a tract upon Socinianism.! But it was not the 
finer spirits of London, so much as the finer spirits of Oxford 
which, in the days before the storm burst on them, gave Great 
Tew its peculiar character and charm. In that rare and refresh- 
ing society, which admitted “no troublesome ceremony or 
restraint,’ philosophers and scholars mingled happily with men 
of reputation in the world. The conversation was delightful 
for its breadth and freedom, its joyous gravity, its intellectual 
range. But it was still more delightful for the innocent and 
infectious humour of the guests. Oxford dons rode out to stay 
“In June, or when the dog-starre reigned, to find 
Some fresher shade or softer breath of winde, 
And tast the spring, whose purer waters drill 
From the high top of some exalted hill.” # 
Their rooms were waiting for them “ as ready as in the colleges,” 
an open house, an invariable welcome, a library stored with the 
volumes which they needed, a host who seemed to know his 
books by heart, and above all an atmosphere of quiet, happy 
gaiety, which mingled with their seriousness and took possession 
of them all. 
Falkland had the gift of inspiring affection in men as diverse 
as Chillingworth and Hyde. But he had something besides. 
He became a leader of the group or party which, disenchanted 
with the spiritual dogmatism in both camps, still sought for 
teligious liberty within the English Church. ‘“‘ Punishing for 
opinions ”’ was in itself a mark of error. Freedom of inquiry, 
of argument, of interpretation, a wide comprehensiveness, a 
charitable understanding, were to him and his companions 
of the essence of their faith. Chillingworth, ever seeking the 
true grounds of certitude, came to Falkland’s house to write his 
book. His strong, clear intellect, his grasp, his magnanimity, 
1 Clarendon’s famous portraits—he does not mention Sandys—are 
admirably supplemented by Dr. Tulloch in his Rational Theology in the 
Seventeenth Century, and by Sir J. A. R. Marriott’s Life and Times of 
Falkland. It must not be inferred that all those mentioned as Falkland’s 
friends necessarily came to Great Tew.

charming paper in The Oxford Country (232).

ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 309 
made him a formidable opponent, even for the Jesuits whose 
tenets he had once been too ready to imbibe. He hated dog- 
matism. “‘ The way to Heaven is not narrower now than when 
Christ left it.” Protestantism involved the liberty to differ in 
belief. He had no patience with hypocrisy. There were publi- 
cans and sinners on the one side, he told the Court of King 
Charlesin a celebrated sermon, if there were Scribes and Pharisees 
upon the other. John Hales rejoiced in Chillingworth’s out- 
spokenness. For his part he would renounce the Church of 
England to-morrow if it obliged him to believe that any other 
Christian should be damned. He wrote on Schism, but he cared 
as little for publicity as for preferment. His deep learning, his 
wisdom, his unconquerable charity did not prevent him from 
suffering in the schisms which were soon to desolate English 
life. But before the war he enjoyed, as a Fellow of Eton, the 
companionship of another old Oxonian as attractive as himself.1 
Sir Henry Wotton was living at Eton as Provost until his death 
in 1639, strained in purse but unrestrained in hospitality, dipping 
ever into literature and science, corresponding with Bacon and 
with Milton, angling with Walton, cherishing Eton lads of dili- 
gence and genius, and certainly not insensible to the charm of 
Falkland’s friends. ‘‘ Time, Travel, and Conversation” had 
long since made Wotton’s company “one of the delights of 
Mankind.” In his passage to the grave, he once told Hales, he 
had ‘‘ met with most of those joys of which a discursive soul is 
capable.” He had met also with cross-currents, storms, temp- 
tations. “‘ Yet Almighty God hath by His grace prevented me 
from making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience.” 
Hales and Wotton had retired to Eton before Falkland in- 
herited his property. John Earle of Merton was better known in 
the household at Great Tew. Endeared to his host by his strong 
sense of humour and religion, by his scholarship, his finished 
talk and his untidy dress, Earle spent with Falkland “ as much 
time as he could make his own.”’ George Morley of Christ Church, 
another Bishop of the Restoration, if sometimes quicker-tem- 
pered than John Earle, possessed as irresistible a love of fun. 
Laud liked neither his wit nor his opinions. But Laud’s dis- 
approval and Hampden’s friendship were not necessarily dis- 
qualifications for the company in Falkland’s house. Henry 
Hammond brought from Magdalen, and later on perhaps from 
Penshurst, his sweet and serious eloquence, his ‘ graceful car- 
riage, at once most grave, and yet as much obliging,” his geniality 
for others, his asceticism for himself. His ‘‘ Life was the best of 
1 Wotton had been both at New College and at Queen’s. He had 
supplicated for his B.A. in the year of the Armada. Walton’s picture of 
him is well-known.

sermons,” cries John Fell, his biographer and faithful friend. 
And if Sheldon, already dividing his time between his duties at 
All Souls and his other preferments, convinced his fellow-guests 
that he was born to be Primate, his knowledge, his judgment 
and his “ great pleasantness of conversation”’ stimulated the 
ardour of discussion. Some of the leaders of that incomparable 
company must have dropped out before the Rebellion. The 
clash of arms brought others back to Oxford, their hopes and 
theories scattered, their vision of peace and equity left far behind. 
But though their own age rejected their philosophy for the fierce 
alternative of war, though conflict and intolerance dispersed 
them, the ideals which Falkland followed did not die. The 
dreamers of Great Tew sleep with their forefathers and the grass 
grows over the place where they dwelt. But their endeavour 
to reconcile faith and charity continues, and their spirit has 
never since lost its hold upon the English people. 
In Laud’s day questions of this kind were rarely in abeyance. 
But there were many less speculative subjects to occupy the 
Chancellor’s energy for reform. He realised the need of better 
endowments for University teaching. A prebend of Christ 
Church was bestowed on the Hebrew Reader. Another prebend 
was given to the University Orator. A Lecturership in Arabic 
was founded in 1632, and a distinguished Orientalist, Edward 
Pococke, appointed to it. Fellowships were founded under 
Royal patronage to foster sound Church feeling in the Channel 
Islands, while further overseas intrepid exiles established a new 
College of Puritan ideals.1 College interests were not forgotten. 
The Archbishop intervened with pertinacity at Merton. He 
expressed his opinions freely about Lincoln. He thought the 
Brasenose cellar needed more control. But the ancient claim 
of Queen’s College to appoint the Principal of Edmund Hall was 
admitted and confirmed. The needs of St. John’s were gener- 
ously remembered. The needs of Bodley’s Library were ack- 
nowledged by the gift of ‘‘ many rare and exquisite manuscripts.” ® 
In 1634 the West wing of the Bodleian and the Convocation 
House beneath it were begun. The King had lately insisted on 
1 Harvard College dates from the end of 1636. Richard Mather, once 
of Brasenose, and John Davenport, once of Merton and of Magdalen Hall, 
were the only two prominent Oxford men among the early settlers in New 
England. (See Mullinger, Cambridge, III, Chap. II.) 
2 Admitted in 1631, and confirmed in 1636, when Queen’s protested 
that the new Aularian Statutes had not acknowledged her rights. (See 
Laud’s Works, V, 35-6, and Sect. V, subsect. 1 of the Aularian Statutes 
appended to the Laudian Code.) 
3 Laud’s letter announcing the gift and the University’s reply are given 
in Register R (ff. 128-9).

ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 311 
the reduction of fees as excessive and burdensome.1_ But money 
was needed, and in 1637 the fees for Regents had to be increased. 
The accounts were brought into better order. Fines for the 
neglect of duty were enforced. Finances improved. In 1639 
the Chancellor noted that there were six hundred pounds in 
Bodley’s Chest and almost a thousand in the University Chest 
at Corpus. The University’s income might be “‘ pitched upon a 
medium at a thousand marks communibus annis.”* The Arch- 
bishop could rely on Royal favour, and in 1635 a new and ample 
Charter was granted to the University by the Crown.? 
Little things were not beneath Laud’s notice. He felt bound 
to discourage a riding-school for students. He was keenly 
interested in the new porch at St. Mary’s and in the keeping 
of St. Mary’s clock. The porch was finished in 1637 at the 
expense of Dr. Morgan Owen, the Archbishop’s Chaplain.4 The 
“very scandalous statue” of the Virgin over it became after- 
wards a matter of reproach. Large and difficult problems were 
faced with equal vigour. The Chancellor proved a good friend 
to the University Press. He bade the Oxford authorities take 
example by Cambridge. He procured for them not only the 
privileges of 1632 and 1633, which allowed the University three 
printers, each of whom might have two presses and two appren- 
tices, but the important Charter of 1636, empowering them to 
print all manner of books. He advised Convocation to come to 
an understanding with the King’s printers and stationers in 
London, and not to insist at first on printing bibles and service- 
books, grammars and almanacs, in which the London firms 
claimed special rights. “Let your privilege settle a while 
and gather strength quietly.” The Press did gather strength 
under Laud’s encouragement. The Lichfields proved to be 
able men of business. Notable books like Burton’s Anatomy of 
Melancholy and Bacon’s Advancement of Learning were issued 
or re-issued. But the Archbishop’s arrangements, thoughtful 
as they were, did not escape criticism at Oxford. ‘‘It is a hard

year of Elizabeth. Laud advised compliance.

(Wood’s Life, IV, 56), recording the grant to Jackson of £22, ‘‘ beyond

for that worke),’’ show that Jackson was mainly responsible for the porch 
sometimes attributed to Nicholas Stone. 
5 In return for an agreement on this point the Company of Stationers 
bound themselves in Feb. 1637 to pay the University £200 a year. (See 
Laud’s Works, V, 78-81 and 159-61.)

thing in this age to bring men to understand the good that is 
done them”! Reformers in all ages have found cause to echo 
his complaint. 
The Chancellor showed himself as ready to deal with questions 
or controversies affecting the City. The Clerkship of the Market, 
of late times discontinued, was revived. A public officer was 
assigned once more “ to look to the cleansing and keeping sweet 
the market place,” to see to just measures for corn and grain, 
“that there be no fraud committed between the buyer and the 
seller,” and “to view the pitching, paving, and cleansing of the 
streets.” 1 An elaborate scheme was drawn up for setting the 
Oxford poor to make new stuffs. Cottages were swept away. 
Smith Gate was made accessible for coaches. No one foresaw 
the imminence of a siege. The carriers were restricted to six 
horses for their heavy waggons. The higher reaches of the river 
had been made into a highway,? and in August 1635 the first 
barge came up to Oxford by the Thames. Some differences 
with the City were brought to arbitration. But fresh troubles 
arose over the Night Watch,’ over the growth of small houses 
and the licensing of taverns. In 1640 the Vice-Chancellor 
claimed that the University had reduced the number of ale- 
houses from three hundred to five score, and told Laud a tale 
of a “violent and drunken competition” between a brewer 
and a baker for the Mayoralty of Oxford, in which the brewer’s 
hospitality inevitably prevailed. The sole right to license 
victualling-houses in the City was finally left in the University’s 
hands. But the spirit which returned the Long Parliament 
to Westminster roused the City of Oxford to a momentary 
protest on behalf of the liberties which she had lost so long. 
And the University in return assured the Legislature, with a 
venerable insolence which even the approach of Revolution 
could not tame, that the town of Oxford lay out of the road, 
was in no way useful to the public, and seemed only to be made 
“for the entertainment of Scholars,” without whose presence 
and patronage it could not exist.® 
1 Laud’s Works (V, 96-7). 
2 An act opening the Thames for traffic ‘‘ from Burcote by Abendon 
to Oxford ” had been passed in 1624 (Boase, Oxford, 137-8). See Shad- 
well (Enactments in Parliament, I, 245-51). 
3 The Proctors allowed the Town Watch at the gates, but would not 
have them walking about and examining scholars. There were differences 
also about court-leets and tolls and other points of jurisdiction. (See 
Laud’s Works, V, passim.) 
« See the King’s letter to the City, 27th Nov. 1639 (Laud’s Works, V, 
239). The Mayor and aldermen, as justices, had acquired the power of 
issuing licenses under the Statute of 5-6 Edward VI, cap. xxv, where the 
privileges of the University were not expressly reserved (see Laud’s 
statement, Works, V, 237). 5 Wood (Ann. II, 426-7).

ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 313 
Laud’s Vice-Chancellors could depend upon his sympathy 
in any effort to put down disorder. Drinking was still a serious 
evil. The licensed ale-houses were bad enough. But the un- 
licensed ones, the Archbishop thought, were a dishonour to the 
place and a “great mischief” to young students. He took 
strong measures to cut their number down. News that the 
University was “relapsing into a drinking humour” troubled 
him more than any letter he had received for many a day, He 
called on the Vice-Chancellor to do his duty. Hemade war upon 
the practice both inside the Colleges and outside. There was 
reason to fear, Dr. Baylie informed him, that students could 
and did debauch themselves more securely behind their College 
walls. ‘‘ Foul suffrances,’ unhappily, continued. One Trinity 
man was sent to prison. A disorderly Student of Christ Church 
was expelled. Young Lord Downe, Sir Thomas Pope’s descend- 
ant, had a fight with Dr. Prideaux’s son, who was afterwards 
killed at Marston Moor. The Chancellor at last declared that, 
if nothing else availed to stop such misconduct, he would take 
the matter to the King. 
Laud was not alone in his opinion that there was “‘ extreme 
liberty given and taken by young noblemen and gentlemen of 
the better sort.” Tutors in Oxford, he complained, seemed to 
think they had no responsibility but ‘‘ only to read” to their 
| pupils. Manners had deteriorated. Bachelors, nay boys even, 
did not know their places. Caps were neglected. The wide- 
sleeved gown was yielding to the lawyer’s. Slashed doublets, 
garish colours, boots and spurs and love-locks and Court fashions 
were no longer put down, Worse offences were recorded some- 
times. A boy was struck by a Christ Church Master for startling 
his horse as he rode down St. Aldate’s. A man was disabled 
by a kick in a scuffle. Both boy and man subsequently died. 
The accused were tried before the University’s under-steward : 
but the evidence proved insufficient to convict. An unpopular 
Proctor was publicly hissed for carrying out his duties, and the 
Chancellor scolded the authorities for not punishing such demon- 
strations more severely. It was not enough, he urged, to have 
the ringleaders whipped. A more mature offender, William 
Prynne, was publicly degraded, and his sentence fixed on St. 
Mary’s church-door. No Oxford man must publish attacks 
reflecting even indirectly on the Court. Tumults accompanied 
the disputations. ‘“‘ Coursing between one college and another 
is the great mother of all disorder.”” One week, in 1638, Christ 
Church and Exeter men were so unruly—‘ the masters inter- 
posing and wrangling in the schools, and their boys fighting out 
of school ’—that disputations between the two Colleges had to 
be forbidden. Order, no doubt, required to be enforced, Seats 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
  314 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
were allotted to examiners and candidates at examinations. 
The Masters in Convocation were enjoined to remain sitting and 
not to crowd round the Vice-Chancellor when he made a speech. 
Meanwhile in the churches and chapels of Oxford new signs 
of ceremonial appeared. The Archbishop’s injunction to the 
Merton Fellows to bow towards the altar was remembered against 
him at his trial, But lovers of ritual were ready enough to adopt 
the “seemly gestures” he required. Brian Duppa was busy 
adorning the Cathedral, moving the ancient stalls and monu- 
ments, adding new panelling and screens and glass. Frewen 
at Magdalen had set up his “altar of Bethel.” In the noble 
Chapel of New College music and colour revived. New Chapels 
were begun at Oriel and University. At Wadham and Lincoln 
they were just completed. The Van Linges were painting their 
glowing, jewelled windows. At St. Mary’s the Communion 
Table was moved into the chancel. Surplices and Latin prayers 
had become the fashion, and Latin responses by the “ Singing 
men.” On all points of form, of conduct, of decorum, the Chan- 
cellor had unmistakable convictions. He was prepared to 
enforce them without fear or favour, even against the “ greatest 
and most splendid transgressors.” If he visited a College, he 
did not spare its failings. His visitation of Merton brought to 
a head the long-smouldering enmity between him and Warden 
Brent. If he had pressed the power of visiting the University, 
which he claimed as Metropolitan and which the King confirmed, he 
might have tried too far the loyalty even of his devoted friends. 
But Laud’s greatest service to the University was the energy 
with which he carried through the long-delayed revision of the 
Statutes. He knew well how imperfect and confused they were. 
Revision had often been talked of. Laud had in earlier days 
been nominated to serve on a Delegacy for the purpose. But 
nothing came of the proposal until he persuaded Lord Pembroke 
in 1629 to insist on the task being undertaken in earnest. The 
Delegacy then appointed included several Heads of Colleges— 
Juxon, Bancroft, Prideaux, Dean Duppa and Dr. Pinke. It 
included also Thomas James of the Bodleian, Richard Zouch, 
Principal of St. Alban Hall and Regius Professor of Civil Law, 
Peter Turner of Merton, Professor of Geometry, and not least 
Brian Twyne.?, When Laud succeeded Pembroke an energetic 
1 Laud carried his point with the King in Council (Mullinger, III, 
128-131). Wood says that the University refused to lend the Chancellor 
“the MEMORABLES and PRIVILEGES of the University collected by 
Rob. Hare . . . least they should lend a hand to betray their own 
Privileges ” (Ann. II, 403). But the book was afterwards produced. 
2 These four were the Sub-Delegacy specially charged with the work 
(Wood, Ann. II, 386). Wood suggests that James was offended because 
his Colleagues went beyond his collections to the original Statutes; James
-P-A-G-E-371
  ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 315 
start was made. As early as May 1630 the new Chancellor 
suggested that the next Long Vacation might see the project 
carried through. And though such haste proved to be impracti- 
cable, and though “ factious men ” in the following year imperilled 
the whole scheme, the vigour and firmness of the Chancellor 
triumphed. The King stepped in and commanded the Delegates 
to make all the speed they could. Duppa, as Vice-Chancellor, 
urged by letters from his chief, kept the revisers closely at their 
task. Zouch and Twyne threw themselves into it bravely. 
Peter Turner helped “‘ as often as his occasions would permit.” 
James, who died in August 1629, left behind him valuable tran- 
scripts, which Twyne secured and worked on. Zouch and others, 
no doubt, contributed drafts. Darrell’s volume of collections 4 
—no mean attempt at codification—was also used. But the 
most indefatigable member of the Delegacy and the one most 
regularly engaged was Brian Twyne. Every Monday, we are 
told, in the chamber in the Tower ? he read and propounded to 
his colleagues some part of the Statutes, with the changes pro- 
posed. With those colleagues he threshed out difficulties and 
details. The final draft was in Twyne’s handwriting, and to 
him more than to any other man the credit of bringing the great 
project to accomplishment is due. 
left more than one volume of MS., the most important of which, with 
Twyne’s additions, containing some 489 pages, is now known as Twyne 
XX. Others like Thomas French, at one time Registrar, helped. In a 
packet in the University Archives (South Press, Pyx D, Fasc. 11) there isa 
“ Rough-Cast or Rude draught of the Unites New Statutes,” made appar- 
ently by Thomas French with the help of Thomas Jacob, containing 56 
pages of Titles and Sections, with other contemporary names on the back. 
With this are various corrections, considered in Feb. 1631 by Delegates 
like Kettell, Pinke, Prideaux, Juxon, Jackson, Iles, Clayton, Wilkinson, 
Rogers, Airay, Turner, besides a large number of loose papers, undated, 
of a similar kind. The same packet contains certain emendations of 
Statutes suggested in 1650 and 1651. See also Dr. Clark’s notes (Wood’s 
Life, IV,127-31). The thin volume of 37 folios among the British Museum 
MSS. (Sloane 749), ‘‘Academiae Oxoniensis Privilegia in viti Corpus 
collecta’’—of which, I understand, Mr. W. H. Stevenson has found a 
copy in the President’s safe at St. John’s—is a brief abstract of charters 
and other documents drawn up, it seems, later by Dr. Zouch. It is no 
draft of new Statutes, but Zouch’s studies in the subject may well have 
been of use to the Delegates. 
1 George Darrell of All Souls was Junior Proctor in 1604. 
1 The Statutes and Registers were already stored in the Tower of the 
New Schools. The proposal to house the University muniments in the 
vestry of All Souls Chapel, made in 1609, had not been carried out. Some 
of them were left in the Old Congregation House at St. Mary’s; but 
in 1640 they were all collected in the Tower. (See Poole’s Lecture on 
Archives, 11-21.) 
3 Wood says (Amn. II, 389) that someone else, probably Peter Turner, 
prepared the Code for the Press. Laud confirms this (Works, V, 99).

316 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The Twynes had for at least three generations produced 
distinguished Oxford scholars. John Twyne, a well-known 
master of the Grammar School at Canterbury, had taken his 
degree in the days of Wolsey. He had taught and grown rich— 
two occupations which scholars have not always found it easy 
to combine. He had become Mayor of Canterbury and Member 
for that city. He had opposed Wyatt’s rebellion and rendered 
service to Queen Mary. He had enjoyed some reputation as an 
antiquarian and an author, and his three sons had inherited his 
love of letters. Thomas Twyne, the youngest of them, had 
been a Fellow of Corpus in early Elizabethan days, a student of 
medicine at Cambridge afterwards, and a successful practitioner 
at Lewes. And he had left behind him writings, including some 
translations from Virgil, which at least indicated literary tastes. 
Brian Twyne became like his father in due course a Scholar and 
Fellow of Corpus. He took his degree as a Master of Arts within 
a few months of Queen Elizabeth’s death. Ten years later he 
was made Vicar of Rye, and he kept that living for thirty years. 
But he devoted his life to Oxford, and Oxford owes him an 
immeasurable debt. 
Letters between Brian Twyne and his father, preserved in 
the Bodleian, reveal some of his difficulties in his early years. 
The Lewes doctor, though he could sign himself “ your verie 
lovinge and carefull father,’ had stringent notions of what was 
due from a son, and the boy had to plead hard for the money 
and books and clothes which he needed. Brian was charged 
with lingering and loitering in Oxford, with making no effort 
to support himself. He evidently did not share his father’s 
views as to his career. He was told that, if he could spare time 
from the College, to which he was so much “ addicted,” he had 
better come home and talk over his future. But he was not to 
come in his worst and most tattered clothes, in the hope of having 
new ones supplied. He was contrasted very unfavourably with 
a certain contemporary Ned Campson : 
“Hee mainteineth himselfe tight and trim in apparell, liueth 
well of himself, is a good Preacher, helpeth his poore Parentes: you 
are still a childe, and wilbee though you liue to bee as old as Cupide. 
your pride, and overvalewinge yourself I know not wherfore, vndoeth 
you. you vaunt with the Pharasey but you are woorse than the Pub- 
licane whom hee skorned. ... I far prefer him that with a litle

a note-book of Twyne’s presented not long since to the Bodleian by Prof. 
Bywater. I have to thank Mr. Gibson for the transcripts. There are 
one or two similar letters of 1602 in the first volume of Twyne Collections

learninge getting his liuinge ; before him that with much more must 
still liue like an Infant. I would I had your yeeres, and you my 
minde.” 
The elder Twyne had little sympathy for his boy’s tastes. The 
boy assures him that he does not neglect ‘‘ good liberall artes.” 
He only studies divinity on Sundays and holy days. His smat- 
tering of Hebrew is only gained by stealth, while he walks with 
his fellows, from a borrowed Hebrew grammar, which he takes 
care to have about him in an idle place. He prays for wit and 
dexterity in disputing, for a strong body to bear the tediousness 
of studying day and night. He showers Christian blessings on 
his parent : is there a touch perhaps of the “ Pharasey ” there ? 
But what, he asks, could be more joyous to a father than to be 
himself a learned Doctor of Physic while his son was a learned 
Doctor of Divinity? He begs for stuff for gowns and hoods. 
He sends thanks for presents, a cheese, a Xenophon, a little 
money, which come through to him though the carriers are 
knavish fellows. Sometimes his letters do not reach home, and 
he has to bear unjust reproaches: ‘ you object many thinges to 
me, of which I could easily purge myselfe.” He writes a letter 
in Greek to the doctor and wonders why he gets no answer. He 
begs that his father will not grudge him the services of a poor 
Scholar according to the College custom : it would be intolerable, 
base and beggarly to make him carry wood and dust himself. 
He pleads at any rate for ‘“‘ succour ”’ to stay it out until he wins 
a Fellowship. He has hopes of a place at Merton—this was 
before he got his Fellowship at Corpus—and he might perhaps 
get a kinsman into his Scholarship at Corpus. Or a gentleman 
wanting admission for his son might be willing to pay ‘‘ some 
fee for gettinge the Fellowes voices.” He certainly put up with 
hard words from home, and he bore them with dignity and good 
temper. His father did not hesitate to hint at “ lewde courses,” 
when he declined to fall in with a marriage proposed. Brian 
told him that he would answer such suggestions when there was 
ground for them and not before. Meanwhile he would rather 
have a living before he had a wife, unless the lady should happen 
to “ bringe meate in her mouth.” The younger man holds his 
own in his letters: there is patience and manliness in his replies. 
He goes on his way steadily in the honourable path he has laid 
out. Had his father lived a little longer, even his censorious 
affection would have recognised, if he really doubted, the sterling 
merit of his son, 
Twyne was a young man still when he published his Afologia, 
his defence of the antiquity of Oxford, the first genuine history 
of the University that had yet appeared. It stamped the ancient 
legends with a new authority, but it went far beyond the little

controversial tract of Thomas Keys.1 The Vicar of Rye was 
past middle life when he joined in the work of editing the Statutes. 
His services were rewarded by his appointment as first Keeper 
of the Archives in 1634. He lived ten years longer, saw the 
Civil War begin in Oxford, and wrote an account of its early 
days there, which found its way long after into print.2 But his 
chief work has never been printed, except in quotations and 
borrowings by others. Wood, his principal debtor, was more 
concerned to use than to acknowledge the stores of information 
so industriously compiled. Over fifty volumes of laborious 
manuscript, bequeathed to the University and to Corpus Christi 
College, were gathered by Twyne from muniments and records, 
wherever he found materials to explore. Colleges and parish 
churches, University and City archives, Cathedral registers and 
private libraries, all alike yielded resources to him. His great 
collection was left unedited, a treasury for students ever since.? 
But not until an editor arises to pay to the elder antiquarian 
the service which has been rendered with loving thoroughness 
to his successor, will the University acquit itself of the obligations 
which all its historians owe to Brian Twyne. 
It is, no doubt, true that the new Statutes were mainly the 
work of the Chancellor’s friends. But when the draft was ready, 
towards the end of August 1633,4 Convocation passed it without 
dissent. Laud claimed and exercised the right to revise it. In 
July 1634 he sent down printed copies for the University, the 
Colleges and Halls. Students were to have free access to them, 
and an abridgment was published for their special use. ‘“‘A 
great ledger book written out fair,” the authentic copy under 
1 Thomas Keys’ Assertio, presented to the Queen in 1566, which had 
led to the controversy with John Caius of Cambridge. See Madan’s Oxford 
Books (II, 17-18 and 58-9). 
2 Twyne’s Account of the Musterings of the University of Oxford, and 
of events from 9 Aug. 1642 to 15 July 1643, printed in 1733 asan Appendix 
to Hearne’s edition of R. de Morins’ Chronicon de Dunstaple (II, 737-87), 
is reprinted in extracts in Clark’s Life of Wood (I, 53-103). 
8 For details of Twyne’s Collections see Clark (Wood’s Life, IV, 202 sq.). 
“ Convocation sent it to the Chancellor on the 1st September. The 
chief dated references in Register R are in Sept. 1633 (f. 69), in July 1634 
(ff. 91-2), and in June 1636 (ff. 126-7). Wood (Amn. II, 389) takes his 
date August 20 from f. 67, as Dr. Poole notes (Lect. on Archives, 20). But 
the entry on f. 69, recording the unanimous assent of Convocation, and 
just preceding the letter of Sept. 1st, is undated. Laud in one of his 
letters speaks of the Act as ‘‘ bearing date in August, 1633’ (Works, 
1853, V, 102), and Wood’s date for it may be right. 
5 See the copy of 1634 in the Bodleian, which shows certain differences 
—changes, omissions and additions—when compared with the Authentic 
Code of 1636. For students Selected Statutes were published in 1638, 
known later as Parecbolae sive Excerpta e Corpore Statutorum (Ib. V, 190).

seal, was to rest in the Archives. But before this was made, the 
whole code was to be on probation for a year, and space was left 
in the printed copies for any alterations and additions which it 
was decided to introduce. The King expressed “ extraordinary 
contentment.” The period of probation was happily passed. 
On the 22nd June 1636 a solemn Convocation was held in St. 
Mary’s for the publication of the completed Statutes. Commis- 
sioners appeared with letters from the Sovereign and the Primate. 
The new Code was subscribed by the Heads of Houses. Grateful 
speeches acknowledged the wisdom of the Chancellor and the 
goodness of the King. By God’s blessing, cried one unprophetic 
orator, contrasting the felicity of Englishmen with the afflictions 
which had desolated neighbouring lands, they might rest at 
peace, secure in a good haven, watching a Shipwreck in which 
they had no part. 
King Charles confirmed the completed Statutes as a whole. 
But he had already intervened in 1631 to secure the revision of 
the system of appeals, and he had sent down for enactment 
three important edicts, in regard to the weekly meetings of the 
Heads of Houses, the appointment of Collectors in Lent and the 
Proctorial cycle. These were incorporated in the new Code. 
It was discovered later on that the Royal confirmation of the 
Statutes involved a constitutional question. Could they or 
could they not be varied afterwards without the Royal assent ? 
The point was one day to become a controversial issue and to 
rouse keen difference of opinion. But for a century and more 
no one suggested any material alteration in the Laudian Code. 
Its framers probably never discovered that the University’s 
power to alter and amend it was referred to in language of acad- 
emic ambiguity on which more than one interpretation could 
be put.2 The opinion generally prevailed that the University 
had the right to supplement the Code by explanations, and the 
tight also to make new Statutes on matters not covered by the 
1 The decrees in regard to Appeals passed by Convocation in Dec. 
1631 (Reg. R, 41*-42*), reappear as cap. 16 and c. 17 of Tit. XXI in the 
Laudian Code. (See also Wood, Ann. II, 378.) The decree of 1631 in regard 
to weekly meetings of Heads of Houses (Reg. R, 42%) reappears as Tit, 
XIII. The decree of 1629 in regard to the nomination of Collectors (Reg. 
R, 5°) reappears in substance in Tit. VI, S. ii, c. 4. The decree of Dec. 
1628 in regard to the election of Proctors reappears in the Appendix to 
the Code. (See also Tit. XVII, S. iv.) The three decrees last mentioned, 
the Statuta Carolina, had in a special form the authority of the King. 
2 See Tit. X (S. ii, caps. 1, 2 and 5). 
* This did not apply to the three Statuta Carolina, expressly made by 
Royal authority. The University’s claim to alter the Laudian Statutes 
became a burning question in 1759 and again in 1836. (See Shadwell’s 
introduction to Griffiths’ edition of the Laudian Code.)

Code itself. It was not till 1759 that any serious controversy 
arose on the subject. And it was not till nearly a century later 
that all doubts were finally resolved. 
The new Code, it is broadly stated in the preface, departed 
no further from the ancient Statutes than necessity or the genius 
of the age required. Regulations which conflicted with each 
other, rules long disused and disregarded—“ decreta situ squal- 
lida, dvtwvoutous perplexa’’—might perhaps drop out. But the 
revisers had never forgotten their religious reverence for the 
forms and even the language of the past. The Code began by 
defining the four terms of the academic year,* and the prayers 
and sermons required upon their opening. It passed on to the 
tules for matriculation and for the admission of scholars to 
Colleges and Halls. All students were to matriculate before 
the Chancellor or his Commissary,‘ and to be recorded in the 
Register of Matriculation under the House to which they be- 
longed. Servants as well as scholars had to be entered. Privi- 
leged persons had a separate heading in the book. Subscription 
to the Articles of Religion, and an oath to observe the Royal 
Supremacy and the customs of the University, accompanied 
matriculation. But boys between twelve and sixteen were 
excused the oath, and boys under twelve were excused subscrip- 
tion to the Articles as well. The superior Bedels of Theology 
and Law had to examine the Buttery-books of every Hall and 
College, to make sure that all new-comers appeared before the 
Vice-Chancellor for matriculation. Heads of Houses were made 
responsible for the appearance of their students, and fines for 
1 The copies printed in 1634 were the earliest form of the Laudian 
Statutes. The Corpus revised and adopted in 1636 was not printed at 
that time. It was published at last with some additions in 1768. Sub- 
sequently new Statutes were issued from time to time on separate sheets, 
A reissue of these, bound up together, was made in 1825, with the title 
Addenda ad Corpus Statutorum. Manuals (Parecbolae sive Excerpta) were 
given to students on matriculation. These were superseded in 1858 by 
octavo volumes which included all the Statutes then in force. The changes 
of 1881-82 necessitated a thorough revision. In 1888 the Laudian Code, 
as finally revised, was printed from the authentic copy in the Archives by 
Dr. J. Griffiths, with an Introduction by Mr. C. L. Shadwell. 
2 It is still perhaps an open question how far old Statutes not adopted 
in the Code and not conflicting with it remain unrepealed. The Preface 
as printed, if based on Twyne’s, is very different from his draft preserved 
in MS. Bodl. 594 (ff. 211-21). 
* The first ran from Oct. 10 to Dec, 17, the second from Jan. 14 to 
the eve of Palm Sunday, the third from the tenth day after Easter to the 
Thursday before Whit-Sunday, the fourth from the Wednesday after 
Trinity Sunday to the Saturday after the Act (Stats. Tit. I, S. i). I quote 
from Dr. Griffiths’ edition of the Laudian Statutes (1888). Mr. G. R. M.

neglect of these arrangements were imposed. Tutors had to 
testify to the rank and standing of their pupils. Privileged 
persons had to take the same oath as students, and had also to 
forswear the privileges and jurisdiction of the town. One-fourth 
of the matriculation fees was allotted to the Chancellor. The 
Bedels of Theology and Law received the rest.1 Once again 
it was laid down that all Scholars must enter a College or a 
Hall 2: there were penalties for all who stayed in private houses 
and for the citizens who took them in. All Scholars also must 
have tutors, graduates of character, learning and religion, whom 
the Heads approved, and these tutors were expected not only 
to inculcate the doctrines and discipline of the Church, but to 
see to the dress and the behaviour of their pupils. The tutorial 
system had become an essential part of University life. Scholars 
must not change their Colleges without express permission : 
the migratory habits of an older day were not allowed, And 
the Chancellor intervened to see that young gentlemen expelled 
from one House were not too readily admitted to another. 
The fourth and fifth Titles contained the rules for Lecturers 
and Lectures. Certain Lectures had been fixed by special 
ordinances and specially endowed. But the old obligation of 
the Regents to give Ordinary Lectures remained ; and from the 
Masters Regent or non-Regent Lecturers in Grammar and 
Rhetoric, in Logic and Metaphysics, had to be elected every 
two years. The appointment of these Lecturers, however, was 
now placed in the hands of the four Colleges who supplied the 
Proctors of the current and of the following year. Besides their 
share of fines and pay from the Proctors, they were to have 
divided among them fees collected by the superior Bedel in 
Arts. The Praelector in Grammar was to lecture in Latin at 
eight in the morning twice a week. Priscian and Linacre sup- 
plied the grounding. Selected Greek and Latin authors were 
critically read. Scholars of all conditions in their first year 
were expected to attend. The Praelector in Rhetoric was to 
lecture twice a week to the same Scholars on Aristotle, Cicero, 
Quintilian or Hermogenes. The Praelectors in Dialectic and 
Moral Philosophy lectured to a rather older audience, men between 
the end of their first year and their degree of Bachelor in Arts. 
1 The superior Bedel in Theology took half, the superior Bedel in 
Law one-fourth (Ti#. II), c. 11, the Chancellor’s Commissary the rest.

III, c. 1). But residence in annexes to the Colleges and Halls was allowed.

old days had been bound to lecture, at the time of the Comitia, and six-

  - 322 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
In Dialectic Porphyry’s Isagoge and Aristotle’s Logic were still 
indispensable. Both text and matter were to be discussed. 
In Moral Philosophy the Nicomachean Ethics and the Master’s Poli- 
tics and Economics held the same place as in the medizval world. 
In Geometry and Astronomy the Lectures were regulated 
by the Savilian Statutes. The Music Lecture founded by Dr. 
Heather was to be given once a term or more, and the Proctors 
were authorised to add forty-five shillings * to the small endow- 
ment of three pounds. The electors to the Lecturership in Natural 
Philosophy founded by Sir William Sedley were to be, as he had 
indicated, the Vice-Chancellor, the President of Magdalen and 
the Warden of All Souls, and Aristotle’s writings on the subject 
were still to form the Lecturer’s text. Aristotle’s Metaphysics 
also supplied a theme for the Lectures on that subject. Camden’s 
Lecturer in History was allowed to treat of other historians 
besides Florus,* and all Bachelors of Arts and Civil Law students 
were required to be present. The Regius Professors of Greek 
and Hebrew were to pay special attention to the “ grammar of 
the language and propriety of diction.” Among Greek authors 
Homer, Demosthenes and Isocrates apparently stood on the 
same level. The Hebrew Professor was to draw on the “ founts 
of Holy Writ.” All Scholars who had completed two years 
from their arrival and all Bachelors until promoted to the Master’s 
degree were to attend lectures in Greek. All Bachelors of Arts 
were to listen to the Hebrew Professor until a year after their 
Master’s degree, unless previously entered as students of Medicine 
or Law. The Regius Professors of Law and Medicine had all 
students of those subjects for their audience until they reached 
the Doctor’s rank. The lectures on the Civil Code were to have 
some bearing upon English custom. The lectures on Medicine 
still included only Hippocrates and Galen. But a Lecture in 
Anatomy had now been founded and was regulated by ordinances 
of its own. The Lady Margaret Praelector of Theology was no 
longer asked to lecture on every “ legible” day. The distinction 
of legible days had been abolished,® and every day of term except 
Sundays and Feast Days was available if required. He was to 
lecture like other Readers twice a week, to all Bachelors of Divinity 
and Scholars in Holy Orders until they completed the time for

the Doctor’s degree. And the Regius Professor of Theology, 
whose duty “to expound some part of Holy Scripture” was 
defined in exactly the same terms, had for his audience all Masters 
in Arts after a year from their Inception, except those dedicated 
to Medicine or to Law. 
All these public lectures were to last three-quarters of an 
hour. They were to be given in person, not by deputy, and 
Professors or Readers who failed to give them had to pay five 
or ten shillings as a fine. Nothing must be taught contrary to 
the Catholic faith or to good morals. Any suspicion of heresy 
in the audience must be rebuked or reported. Lecturers in 
philosophy led to speak of God or immortality must remember 
the old maxim to follow those teachers who dissented least from 
Christian truth. In delivery lectures must not be hurried: 
students must have time for taking notes. Lecturers must 
wait, when their lectures were over, and reply with kindness to 
any doubts or questions raised. All students arriving in the 
University must be assigned to certain Schools and attend the 
lectures in them. Those who lived in the same College or Hall 
as their Professor must escort him to and from his lectures, ‘‘ as 
of old the custom was,” or pay a fine of two pence if they failed. 
All the audience at a lecture must be seated, at least so far as 
the seats would go round, and must keep still and listen in 
modesty and silence. All must study in private the subject 
of the lecture, and all below the degree of Master must take the 
lecture down. Fines were imposed for absence or disorder. 
They rose to six pence when a student overlooked the lecture 
of a Regius Professor in Medicine, Theology or Law.? 
An important group of clauses * was devoted to the rules for 
disputations and degrees. These were still elaborate and exacting. 
The old forms had now become stereotyped by practice. Four 
years were still required to become a Bachelor of Arts.5 Every 
candidate must after two years in the University respond and 
oppose pro forma at disputations in the parvise.6 The names 
of the respondents and the questions in grammar or logic must 
be previously approved by the Master of the Schools. All 
scholars had to attend these disputations from the end of their

first year till they completed the period for the Bachelor’s degree, 
and four Regents, nominated by the Proctors, had to be present 
to supervise the proceedings. After the disputations the scholars 
responding pro forma met in the Natural Philosophy School and 
were created General Sophisters. One of the four Regents made 
a short speech on the study of letters and the merits of Aristotle’s 
logic, and hung round the candidate’s neck a simple hood, neither 
lined with wool nor edged with fur.1 Every term afterwards 
till his degree the General Sophister had to dispute at least once 
in the parvise. Besides the disputations in the parvise every 
scholar, after four terms spent in logic, had to respond twice 
pro forma under a Determining Bachelor in Lent, on the same 
questions as the Bachelor undertook to defend.? 
For the degree of Master of Arts three years’ further study 
were required, as of old, twelve more terms of lectures and of 
disputations. A Bachelor of Arts, after taking his degree, must 
determine formally in Lent,? must respond in the Quodlibet 
Disputations, must respond or oppose in Austins, and must 
read six formal lectures before receiving the Master’s degree. 
Two Determining Bachelors, acting as Collectors, divided the 
others into classes and assigned them Schools. Elaborate rules 
for their disputations were laid down. For four days they 
defended propositions in logic according to Aristotle, “‘ whose 
authority was supreme.” On Fridays problems of Grammar, 
Rhetoric, Politics and Morals were discussed. Disputations in 
Austins followed, when Determination was completed, and were 
held in the Natural Philosophy School. Two Masters of Arts 
presided, two Bachelors acted as Collectors; the Proctors ap- 
pointed both. After Determination also every candidate for 
the Mastership had to respond once to some Regent Master at 
the Quodlibet Disputations. And he had, moreover, to deliver 
six lectures, three on Natural and three on Moral Philosophy, 
in the Public Schools.4 The Masters of the Schools and the

tum ” (Ib. c. 4). 
2 For an hour and a half each time, unless the Congregation of Regents 
commuted one turn of responding under the Bachelor for another turn 
of responding in the Parvise (Jb. c. 6). Mr. Brodrick is surely incautious 
in saying (Univ. of Oxford, 115) that disputations, which had long fallen 
into discredit, were superseded by examinations now. But the belief 
in the value of the old disputations was probably declining and the import- 
ance of examinations becoming better understood. (See later, p. 327.) |

« In place of the old cursory lectures on certain prescribed books (Tit. 
VI, S. ii, c. 13). In 1652 two declamations were substituted for these new 
lectures, which had not proved a success, and in 1662 this order was re- 
peated. (See Addenda to Statutes, Griffiths’ edition, 299-303.)
-P-A-G-E-381
  ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 325 
Necessary Regents helped the Proctors to keep order, to restrain 
the “ unbridled license ’’ which brought crowds to the Schools 
to lounge and fight and quarrel rather than dispute. 
The regulations for the different Faculties were set out in 
the same detail. For the Bachelorship in Music seven years 
must be spent in study and a canticle of five parts composed 
and publicly performed. For the Doctorate five more years 
of study and a canticle of six or eight parts were required. To 
become a Bachelor of Civil Law a student had to attend Law 
lectures for three years, if he were a Master of Arts already,! 
and to take part in juridical disputations. The Doctorate 
needed four more years of attending Law lectures, and the delivery 
of certain lectures—they might be Cursory lectures on the Code 
or Digests—by the candidate himself. Bachelors of Medicine 
must be Masters in Arts, must attend three years of Medical 
lectures, and must take part in the necessary disputations : 
Doctors had to go to lectures four years longer, and to lecture— 
on Galen—themselves. There is no visible advance in medical 
science here. Theology of course required still the longest 
course of study—seven years for a Bachelor and eleven for a 
Doctor after taking the Arts degree. The Bachelor had his 
exercises to perform: the questions, in this case as in others, 
were to be fixed on the gates of the Schools and on the walls of 
Oriel and All Souls. He had also to preach a Latin sermon at 
St. Mary’s. The Doctor might, like other candidates for Doc- 
torates, give “solemn”? lectures, but he must choose some 
part of Holy Writ. No students could qualify unless they 
resided for a month in Michaelmas and Hilary, for three weeks 
in Easter, and two weeks in Trinity, term.? 
The seventh Title of the Statutes was devoted to the 
venerable ceremonies for the Vespeviae and the Act. It recalled 
the establishment of a General Inception for all Faculties once 
a year under the name of the Comitia.4 It recited the old customs 
—the Saturday ritual and lectures, the procession of Professors 
from St. Mary’s to the Schools, with the Bedels of Arts at their 
head, the morning visits of Inceptors and Bedels to the different 
lecture-rooms to invite the Lecturers to attend the Vesperiae 
and Comitia, the blessings bestowed by Professors in Theology, 
1 And for 5 years if he were not an M.A. (Tit. VI, S. iv, c. 1). Two 
years also must be given to logic, moral philosophy, politics and other 
humane letters before the 5 years’ law-study began. 
2 In Latin (Tit. VI, S. vi, c. 4). 
% But by old custom the first day of the term in which a man took a 
degree, and the last day of the term in which he matriculated, was in each 
case allowed to count as a full term (Tit. VI, S. vii). 
« The Act, the Comitia, was fixed for the Monday next following = 
7th, and the Vesperiae for the Saturday before it (Tit. VII, S. i, c. 1)

Medicine and Law. It recalled the elaborate disputations by 
Inceptors in the several Faculties from one to five in the after- 
noon, the oath to observe the University’s liberties and customs 
—even the ancient oath repudiating Henry Simeon was retained 
—the supper given by the senior Inceptors in the superior 
Faculties,1 the sermons on the Sunday between the Vesperiae 
and the Act. It rehearsed the ceremonies of the final day, 
the ringing of the little bell about nine on the Monday morning, 
the gathering of Inceptors, escorted by the Bedels from their 
Colleges and Halls, in the East Chapel of St. Mary’s Church, the 
prayers offered, the oblations made at the holy table of the 
Eucharist, the disputations at the Act, the creation of Masters, 
the immemorial ritual of the book, the cap, the ring, the kiss.? 
When the exercises of the Artists were concluded the Musical 
Inceptors had their turn, gave their musical pieces and were | 
created by the Savilian Professors. After the musicians came 
the Inceptors in Medicine, then those in Law, and then those in 
Theology last. It was the special duty of the Regius Professor 
of Divinity to be sure that the Inceptors in Theology wore boots. 
The Vice-Chancellor wound up the proceedings by a speech on 
the chief events of the year. The great bell tolled. The Regents 
of the previous year assembled in the House of Congregation, 
and there, on the supplication of the newly-created Doctors 
and Masters, the putting off of boots and socks and sandals, to 
which they were bound at the time of Inception, was excused. 
A Latin sermon on the Tuesday morning ended the formalities 
connected with the Act. 
The medieval forms survived with curious tenacity. But a 
few variations had crept in. The “ multitude” of Inceptors in ~ 
Arts had made it necessary to empower the Proctors to select 
the disputants in Philosophy. The ‘lust for innovation” 
made it desirable to submit all theses chosen for discussion to 
the approval of Congregation first. Slander and illiberal jokes 
were forbidden. But the license of the Terrae Filius had a standard 
of its own. Dress was closely regulated. Inceptors in Music 
had ‘“‘ white wavy damask capes.’’ Inceptors in Medicine and

“ qui, quoad Inceptores in Artibus, Comitiorum Pater habetur ’’—and the

was performed by the Regius Professors, in Music by the Savilian Pro-

colour.” + The eighth Title of the Code dealt with Ordinary 
Disputations. They were to be held in Theology ten times, in 
Law and Medicine only twice a year. Oxford was still primarily 
the home of clerks. In place of the disputations in Arts which 
the old Statutes had imposed on all Inceptors every disputation 
day for forty days after Inception, Quodlibet Disputations were 
now prescribed for every disputation day in full term.? The 
Proctors or their deputies were expected to attend them. But 
the Vice-Chancellor had to be present at the ordinary disputa- 
tions in Theology, Medicine and Law. 
Other ordinances also touched on the granting of degrees. 
Four Titles, certainly not less important, defined the governing 
bodies of the University, their duties and their powers. The 
Congregation of Regent Masters was summoned, as of old, at 
the beginning of each term.* It dealt with Graces and admitted 
to degrees. It granted dispensations in cases where the Statutes 
gave it a dispensing power. It incorporated distinguished 
members of other Universities. It included necessary and 
optional Regents. All Doctors and Masters, on the day of 
their creation, supplicated to be admitted to the House and to 
their necessary Regency. They took the oath administered by 
the Senior Proctor, and the Vice-Chancellor admitted them to 
Congregation and to Convocation too. The Chancellor, Vice- 
Chancellor and Proctors ® had a veto on the resolutions of the 
Venerable House. The ancient right of examining candidates 
was still vested in the Regents; and now that the belief in the 
adequacy of the old disputations was slowly giving way, rules 
for a system of examination were laid down with a definiteness 
unknown before. For degrees in the higher Faculties indeed it 
was still generally thought to be unnecessary to ask for more 
than the testimony of deponents, who “‘ must be deemed to have 
instituted a sufficient examination’ first.? But candidates 
seeking degrees in Arts, or in Law before incepting in Arts, must 
undergo examination by the Regent Masters. The Natural

328 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Philosophy School was the place. The Senior Proctor fixed 
the time. Only six candidates could be examined on one day, 
and their examiners must not belong to the same College as they. 
The examinations were conducted viva voce. The subjects 
were those on which the candidates were bound by Statute to 
hear lectures.1 Philology took its place beside Philosophy, 
“the narrow learning of an earlier age.’’ A principal object 
was to ascertain the candidate’s power of expressing his thoughts 
in Latin. The old right of Regents to examine was not to be 
abridged. But the Senior Proctor was to nominate in rotation 
three Regents at a time to conduct the new examinations. Testi- 
monials were awarded afterwards, which had to be read aloud 
in the House of Congregation before the candidate’s Grace was 
proposed. The Vice-Chancellor and Proctors were expected 
to be present, and to see that the regulations were duly carried 
out. There were probably some difficulties in establishing the 
new system. But Wood suggests that the new arrangements 
proved a great success. 
A series of elaborate precautions still guarded the grant of 
Graces for degrees. The proposal had to be made in the House 
of Congregation by a member of the candidate’s College or Hall, 
with evidence of his examiners’ approval, openly and distinctly 
and with true intent. The Proctors collected the votes in 
whispers, compared notes on the scrutiny, and declared results. 
The Grace or dispensation was read out, if granted. The Proctors 
were silent if it were refused, except that on the third refusal 
the cause of objection had to be made known.’ Meanwhile the 
candidate waited outside in the Proscholium, in the requisite 
dress and with uncovered head. Each degree and each Faculty 
had its proper form of supplication.6 The Inceptor in Arts 
recited that he had spent twelve terms in the study of Philosophy 
1“ Reiectis prorsus neotericis quibuscunque Authoribus ”’ (Ib. c. 1). 
2 Tit. IX (S. iii, c. 1). 
8 The Vice-Chancellor twice a term, the Proctors four times, at least 
(FTX 9-6. C..3). 
« The Statute did not take effect for four years. In 1638 the Heads 
of Houses—on a suggestion from the Chancellor that the Statutes for 
examination ‘‘ of the younger sort ” needed amendment—ordered that all 
Regents should examine in turn, and that every candidate repulsed by 
them as “‘insufficient’’ should not be examined again for 6 months. 
Laud advised a reference to Convocation (Works, V,204). See also Wood 
(Ann. II, 417-18). 
® A Grace might if necessary be sought four times in four successive 
Congregations. But there was a check on the old unlimited veto of the 
Regents. If the objection seemed unreasonable, the Grace would gener- 
ally be granted on the fourth proposal (Tit. IX, S. iii, c. 7). See alsoc. 5, 
and Ayliffe (II, 142 sq.).

and the Arts—besides his terms of study as a Bachelor—that 
he had attended the necessary lectures and disputations, had 
responded in Quodlibets, had either responded or opposed in 
Austins, and had delivered six formal lectures. The Bachelor 
of Music asked for a Grace to lecture on Boethius: the tradition 
of a thousand years still held. The Bachelor of Medicine still 
asked for leave to lecture on Hippocrates, the Bachelor of Law 
on the Imperial Institutions, the Bachelor of Theology on the 
Epistles of St. Paul. 
The grant of dispensations also was a part of Congregation’s 
work—dispensations for non-compliance with various formalities, 
for omissions in matters of residence, lectures, ceremonial, neces- 
sary for the smooth working of a system which declined to sur- 
render the ritual of the past. So were the formal presentations 
of new graduates in the House, after visits to the Vice-Chancellor 
and Proctors,1 and the payment of the caution-money required. 
The picturesque processions to the Apodyterium—the Bedel 
going before, the Presenter and Head of the College following 
behind *—the subscription to the Articles, not forgetting the 
three articles contained in the thirty-sixth canon of 1604, the 
introduction of each candidate in turn to the ‘“‘ most remarkable 
Vice-Chancellor and egregious Proctors,’ the depositions of 
Bachelors or Masters in the Faculties which the new graduate 
desired to join,® still survived as part of the observances which 
Regents in Congregation were expected to enforce.4 When 
his presentation was completed, the new graduate took the 
necessary oaths, to keep the University’s customs, to maintain 
the peace, to recognise no English Universities save Oxford and 
Cambridge, to frame his mind to modesty and silence whenever 
he entered the Public Library, to procure a habit suitable for 
his degree. He heard the Statutes that concerned him, with 
their rules for study, read aloud, and swore that he had observed 
them in the past. He took the oath to the Royal Supremacy, 
and was then ready to receive the license on his knees. The 
1 The “ Praesentandus cumulatus ”’ paid these visits in pomp, and the 
Vice-Chancellor and Proctors had to escort him home (Tit. IX, S. v, c. 1).

pany their candidates to the Apodyterium, and received gloves in return

(See Tit. IX, S. v, c. 7 in Griffiths’ ed. of the Statutes.) They gave their 
testimony in a low voice. 
‘ Tit. IX (S. v, c. 4) recites the old custom ‘‘ Nemo Scit,”’ which Incep- 
tors in Civil Law still kept up. They passed over to the Civil Law School 
for the purpose, and then returned to the House of Congregation (see 
ante, p. 131). 
   
-P-A-G-E-386
330 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Vice-Chancellor whispered in his ear to ask him whether he could 
spend forty pounds a year, or, failing that, five shillings a year, 
of hisown. If he admitted the latter impeachment he was asked 
to pay for wine. The ancient forms of admission to read or to 
incept were solemnly repeated. The candidates presented rose 
and kissed the Vice-Chancellor, their Presenters and the Proctors 
each in turn. They left the House and put on their new gowns, 
returned and bowed and finally departed.1_ The authors of the 
new Code had done little to diminish the venerable solemnities 
which the Middle Ages had imposed. 
The rules for incorporation followed. The rules for licensing 
preachers, physicians and surgeons came next. No Oxford man 
taking a degree abroad could be admitted to the same degree at 
Oxford without completing the time required by the Statutes, 
nor without the express consent of the Vice-Chancellor and 
others.2. Licenses ‘“‘to preach the word of God through the 
whole of England” could only be obtained by Masters of Arts 
and Bachelors of Law and of Theology, who had studied divinity 
in the University for seven years. Doctors of Medicine might 
practise it in all its branches. But no one else might practise 
medicine publicly in Oxford, unless he were a Master of 
Arts and a Bachelor of Medicine admitted by the Chancellor 
and Congregation in the usual way. No surgeon might practise 
in University precincts without the Chancellor’s license. No 
student of surgery might practise throughout England until he 
had exercised himself in the art for seven years, had performed 
two Anatomies and achieved at least three cures. Academic 
legislators allowed that the surgeon at any rate needed some- 
thing more than theory for his stock in trade. All licenses were 
granted for “‘ the glory of God and the salvation of the brethren.” 
Surgeons were also required to cure four poor men without 
charge, to keep within the bounds of their own art, and not to 
ask too much for fees. 
The tenth Title dealt with the Great Congregation or Con- 
vocation of Regents and Non-Regents.? The Bedels, at the 
command of the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor, on any day 
assigned in term or vacation, were to give notice at every College 
and Hall, summoning all Doctors and Masters, Regent and non- 
1 In a different order: the senior led on their departure, the junior 
when they arrived. Those presented as B.As. went to the Schools, had 
questions propounded to them, and promised that Aristotle should answer 
for them next Lent (Tit. IX, S. 7). 
2 Including the Proctors and the Professor and three Doctors of the 
same Faculty, or the majority of them (Tit. IX, S. viii, c. 2). 
2 In 1760, after a vehement controversy, a new Section defining the 
persons who composed Convocation, was prefixed to Title X. (See 
Griffiths, xvi sq. and 310-12, and Ward’s earlier translation, 131-3.)
-P-A-G-E-387
  ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 331 
Regent, then present in the University to repair to Convocation 
“after the ringing of the little bell.”” All summoned would then 
make their way to the House, dressed as was fitting, take the 
seats assigned to them, and deliberate on the business set forth 
by the Vice-Chancellor. They were to vote by scrutiny or by 
open voice, in the Proctor’s ear or by dividing the House.1_ No 
decree could pass? which was negatived by the Chancellor or 
Vice-Chancellor, by both Proctors or their deputies, or by the 
majority of Regents and non-Regents. The Great Congregation 
was still the supreme governing body. All things which touched 
the University’s dignity and safety fell within the province of 
this Assembly—the making of Statutes, the election of officers, 
the appointment of delegates for special purposes, the grant of 
lawful dispensations, the presentation to benefices, the letting 
of lands and keeping of accounts, the sending of letters to the 
Crown and to great personages, the removal of discredits, the 
deprivation of degrees. But before new Statutes were passed, 
they must first be considered by the Heads of Houses. When 
passed, they must be entered in the Register by the Registrar 
within a week.4 Apart from the Register five copies of the 
Statutes must be kept. One, the Authentic Book, fortified by 
the Chancellor’s seal, was to be stored in the same chest as the 
seal of the University. Another was to lie in the archives of the 
Public Library. The other three were to remain in the Vice- 
Chancellor’s and Proctors’ hands. 
Dispensations could be granted to temper the rigour of the 
Statutes as readily in the seventeenth century as in earlier days. 
Fellows and Scholars of Colleges were allowed as a matter of 
right 5 to dispense with any Statutes which conflicted with their 
own. But the power of dispensation was limited in various 
ways.® Statutes framed by Royal authority, and the wills and 
ordinances of University benefactors even Convocation must 
not set aside. As regards elections to offices, Readerships and 
benefices, these were made by scrutiny in writing.? Oaths had 
1 “ Vel scriptis per scrutinium, vel viva voce, vel in aurem Procura- 
toris, vel denique per secessionem ad alteram partem Domus” (Tit. 
X&, S. i). 
2 Except in elections, which the majority decided.

‘« They must then be read aloud in the next Congregation, and if 
accurate signed by the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors. The Registrar 
must then within a fortnight transcribe them in the Authentic Book and 
in the other four copies of the Statutes. But on this transcription there 
was apparently no check (Jb. c. 3). 
5“ Tpso jure,’ and without any further supplication or petition (c. 4).

tion arose, ‘‘ viva voce aut pedibus eundo in sententiam ” (c. 6).

332 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
to be taken and careful formalities observed. If voters failed, 
the superior Bedel of Arts summoned the Masters loudly three 
times to do their duty. The papers containing the votes were 
afterwards committed to the flames. The appointment, again, 
of delegates for special purposes was an important part of Con- 
vocation’s work. The reports of these delegates might be acted 
on with merely formal confirmation ; or they might require to 
be approved by a fresh vote of the House. A standing Delegacy 
was nominated to deal with questions of account. But Con- 
vocation’s gravest duty was to deprive a heinous sinner of his 
degree. The Vice-Chancellor with his severest aspect unveiled 
to the offender “‘ the atrocity of his crime,” and one of the inferior 
Bedels, after stripping him of cap and hood and cape and gown, 
drove him forth from the House of Assembly, “‘ despoiled and 
naked of academical distinctions,” into the world of outer dark- 
ness where such glories were unknown.? 
The general Statutes concerning Congregations and Convo- 
cations * laid down rules for attendance and for seats. Necessary 
Regents were expected to attend Congregation closely, and were 
subject to fine or punishment if they failed. All Doctors and 
Masters, Regent and non-Regent, were under obligation to attend 
Convocation, unless good reasons for their absence could be 
given. The twelfth Title recalled the old name of “ Simile- 
primo,” and the Vice-Chancellor’s customary right to summon, 
in vacation as well as in term, meetings of Regents and non- 
Regents ‘ to deal with certain small matters of business. Letters 
to great persons, for example, and testimonials in regard to 
licenses, approved by Convocation or Congregation, might be 
sealed at these meetings.* But no presentations might be made, 
no Graces, licenses or dispensations proposed.* Nor could any- 
thing else be attempted for which one of the greater Assemblies 
was required. 
One Title, the thirteenth, recalling a Royal ordinance of 
Charles I, confirmed the important change in the government 
of the University which the sixteenth century had introduced. 
1 The distinction was between matters delegated “ cum nuda relatione 
ad Domum ” and those delegated ‘‘ cum relatione ad Domum et appro- 
batione eiusdem ” (c. 7). 
2 If the offender absented himself, the authorities had to be content 
with setting forth his sins in a public instrument, stripping him of his 
degrees, and affixing the sentence to the “‘ Valves of the Great Gate of the 
Schools” (c. 8). 
8 See Title XI. 
* As many as wished to be present. But there must not be less than 9. 
5 It may have been at one of these meetings in vacation that the famous 
letter approving Wycliffe’s doctrines was sealed (see ante, vol. I, p. 237). 
6 “ Excepto Simile-primo habendo in die Vesperiarum.”’  
-P-A-G-E-389
  ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 333 
The old democratic traditions were passing away. The Proctors 
were no longer the nominees of the whole body of Masters. The 
Heads of Houses had secured the chief control of academic 
business, and the formal establishment of the Hebdomadal 
Council gave shape and permanence to the rights they had 
acquired. On Monday in every week throughout the year, 
both in term and in vacation,! a meeting was to be held by the 
Vice-Chancellor, the Proctors and the Heads of Colleges and 
Halls, to deliberate and take counsel together for the defence of 
the University’s privileges and the maintenance of its laws. 
Any question which touched the University’s administration, 
its proficiency, its character, its interests, might be considered 
at these meetings. Proposals based on their deliberations 
would then have to be made in the House of Congregation, and 
finally Convocation would be invited to embody their decisions 
in decrees. 
Side by side, however, with this silent revolution, the old 
and strict traditions in regard to less important matters still 
survived. Several sections of the Laudian Statutes were devoted 
to rehearsing rules for dress and rules tor conduct, which seem 
disproportionately rigid and minute.? Clerks must dress as 
became clerks. Only sons of barons might break out in bright 
colours. The absurd and arrogant custom of walking publicly in 
boots must be eschewed. Elaborate and immoderate hair must 
never be encouraged. New and unusual fashions in clothes must 
be repressed. Gowns, hoods, capes and caps, suitable to each 
Faculty and order, were to be settled by the Hebdomadal Council, 
and patterns of them regularly kept.? Tailors were to be pun- 
ished by the Vice-Chancellor if they departed, “ even by a nail’s 
breadth,” from the authorised design. In behaviour juniors 
must show reverence to seniors, yield their places to them and 
unbare their heads. Mature offenders might be fined or impri- 
soned, immature ones whipped. The Black Book of the Proctors 
kept a record of their sins. The temptations of the City, of the 
streets, the market, the Assizes, were singled out for warning. 
Scholars must not loiter about Carfax, or frequent the homes of 
townsmen or houses of ill-fame. Heads of Houses® might

feast-days intervened.

8 The patterns were drawings. They were to be deposited in “‘ Prae- 
lum sive Abacum huic usui destinatum.” Dr. R. L. Poole points 
out that these engravings were kept not in the Archives but in the 
Convocation House (Lect. on Hist. of Archives, 5-6).

insist on searching private dwellings for their students. Scholars _ 
of all conditions must avoid all places in the City or University 
precincts where wine or other drink or the Nicotian herb Tobacco 4 
could be bought. Fines, imprisonment and whippings were 
the penalties for students who disobeyed. Tutors offending 
were disqualified or expelled. Night-wandering was still a 
serious offence. Since experience proved that the diligence of 
magistrates was no match for the ingenious iniquity of tavern- 
keepers, all sellers of drink were compelled to keep their back 
walls in repair, and to “ close those mazy, winding walks in their 
back courts and gardens, through the labyrinths of which night- 
takes so often steal away.’’? 
Games and gambling were controlled with equal strictness. 
Dice and cards for money were forbidden. Hounds and hawks 
and even football were illegitimate as they had been in medieval 
times. So were sword-players, cudgel-players, rope-dancers 
and actors, ‘‘ who for gain’s sake go upon the stage.’’ So were 
slander and evil-speaking, and all acts of violence and brawling. 
To butt another man with head and shoulders or to spoil his 
clothes meant a fine of four shillings. A blow with the open 
fist cost five. Drawing sword or dagger involved not a fine 
only but imprisonment and loss of terms. Maiming or endanger- 
ing life was punishable by banishment. Offenders had to make 
amends to the injured party too. Historical troubles were 
recalled by the rule against quarrels due to nationality, more 
recent differences by the law against conventicles irreconcilable 
with the doctrines of the Church. Interference with the Vice- 
Chancellor’s or Proctors’ jurisdiction was equivalent to disturb- 
ance of the peace. And any student rising to such a pitch of 
audacity as to lay violent hands on the University’s officials was 
to be expelled for ever from its bounds. 
The sixteenth Title prescribed the course of sermons and 
the order in which the representatives of the Colleges were to 
preach. Ordinary and extraordinary sermons were provided 
for, anniversary sermons in College Chapels, sermons both in 
Latin and in English. For an English sermon six weeks’, for a 
Latin sermon three months’, notice was required. The preachers 
must be of a certain standing. Not only residents were liable, 
but all qualified persons entered in the Buttery-books of Colleges 
or Halls. Prayers to commemorate University benefactors 
were not to be forgotten. Nothing contrary to Church discipline 
or doctrine was permitted. Seditious words, if the Vice-Chan- 
cellor so considered them, were liable to punishment. All Doctors, 
Masters, graduates and scholars were expected to attend®

ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 335 
The seventeenth and the three following Titles dealt with the 
officers and servants of the University, with their fees, with 
their Treasury, their charters and their buildings. The Chan- 
cellor’s position and powers were defined. The Vice-Chancellor, 
the High Steward and his deputy, and one of the Clerks of the 
Market were his nominees.! The University Courts were his 
Courts. The punishment of offenders was a part of his prero- 
gative. The “thunderbolt of Discommoning ” was his weapon. 
Congregation and Convocation met at his instance and could 
decide nothing without his or his deputy’s consent. The govern- 
ment of Halls, the incorporation of artisans within University 
precincts, the licensing of wine-shops, the general supervision 
of the town were his concern. Not only was the University 
his peculiar. He shared with the Mayor the guardianship of 
the City and suburbs of Oxford,? and could bind the townsmen 
with his laws. Of these large powers the Vice-Chancellor had 
now become the representative. He could not, when nominated, 
refuse the office. He was usually appointed for a year, but the 
Chancellor could reappoint him, or another Head of a College 
in his place. It was his duty to reside in the University, to 
enforce its Statutes and to keep its peace, to maintain its rights, 
its Courts, its Charters, to encourage faith and learning, to dis- 
courage heresy and schism. The salary of this laborious position 
was ten pounds a year. The High Steward drew a smaller fee, 
only five pounds, from the University: but his functions could 
be summed up briefly. The clauses on the appointment of 
Proctors were more important. They referred to the Caroline 
Statute. The King’s “healing hand” had swept the old and 
inconvenient election by scrutiny away. It had substituted 
the more peaceful method of election by the Colleges in turn. 
The two Proctors, duly installed and sworn, were to nominate 
four deputies, one of whose duties it was to range the streets 
and taverns during sermon hours, when the younger men were 
specially apt to roam abroad “with security and license,” 
dressed in such iniquities as boots and hats. The Proctors were 
still, as of old, the business men of the University. They were 
responsible for the administration of its laws, for the up-keep 
of its exercises, its property, its customs, for the enforcement 
of discipline and the chastisement of wrong. The Proctors’ 
servants must be kept to their duties, and summarily punished 
for negligence or for taking bribes. The Proctors’ accounts 
must be strictly audited when their year of office came to an

end. Their stipend was six pounds, thirteen shillings and four- 
pence, divided between them. They must not spend more than 
ten pounds in entertaining Cambridge men and strangers in a 
single year. 
The two Masters of the Schools were appointed by the Proctors 
immediately after their own admission. They presided at the 
Austin disputations. They were in general charge of the 
disputations in the parvise and of those of the Determining 
Bachelors in Lent. Masters of the Streets also, responsible for 
cleanliness and order, were appointed by the Proctors from among 
the Regents every year. The Public Orator was appointed by 
scrutiny on the Vice-Chancellor’s initiative, the Clerks of the 
Market, one by the Vice-Chancellor and the other by the Chan- 
cellor himself. The Keeper of the Archives, a new functionary, 
was to be the nominee of Convocation, to collect and dispose 
the University muniments and charters,! and to produce them, 
when needed, without delay. Forty pounds at least was to be 
paid to him as stipend, out of a fund to which all members of 
the University contributed a shilling a year.2. The Registrar 
was bound to attend Convocation, which elected him, to record 
its decisions, to act as secretary, and to make entries in the 
Registers as the rules required. He had also to collect the 
University’s rents,* to give an account of the receipts, and to 
enrol other officers’ statements of accounts. 
The rules for the six Bedels, superior and inferior, esquires 
and yeomen, were inherited, like so much else, from ancient 
days. Two, one of each rank, were apportioned to Theology ; 
two were allotted to Law, and two were shared between Medicine 
and Arts. They were elected in the same way as the Chancellor. 
Their appointment was renewed yearly, but was generally 
assumed to be for life. They acted as escorts, as heralds, as 
police. They kept the Register of Matriculation. They col- 
lected fines. In the presence of the Sovereign they bore their

3 “ Reditus ” (Tit. XVIII, S. i). The Laudian Statute, following the 
rule of the fifteenth century, required the Registrar to be not only a Master 
of Arts or Bachelor of Laws but also a Public Notary. In 1660 this was 
modified, and a Registrar was allowed to be elected if he were fit to be a 
Public Notary, on condition that he became one as soon as possible 
(Griffiths’ edition, 302).

University Stationer or Verger—one officer only now in theory, 
as for a long time past it had been only one in fact—replaced 
the four Stationers of older days. He was elected like the Bedels, 
and appeared on ceremonial occasions with a silver mace. He 
figured in the processions of Compounders. On the death or 
departure of a Scholar he helped to make an inventory of his 
goods.1. The University Clerk ? and the Tintinnabulary or Bell- 
man were nominated by the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor. 
The Clerk himself was a bell-ringer, who summoned meetings, 
and saw that the meeting-places, schools, churches, chairs, were 
clean. He posted notices. He opened gates. He looked 
after the clock. He administered whippings. The Tintin- 
nabulary, who acted as crier and proclaimed the Chancellor’s 
edicts in the streets, also performed more melancholy duties. 
He rang his hand-bell round the town for academic funerals, 
and enjoyed the privilege of dressing the bodies of the dead. 
Decrees more modern in their origin provided for the Printer 
and Bailiff of the University. King Charles’ generosity to the 
Press was not to be perverted for the private profit of sordid 
and illiberal artisans, who cared little for calligraphy or for the 
beauty of their craft. All University printers must on admis- 
sion accept the Statutes on the subject. The Chief Printer, 
the head of the Press, was to be a person instructed in Greek 
and Latin and of great experience in philological studies. He 
must see that the University paper and presses were the choicest 
of their kind. He must take all possible care to produce good 
work. Besides his duties and profits as a printer he was to hold 
the comparatively light office of Superior Bedel in Civil Law. 
The University Bailiff was a new officer, to be appointed by the 
Chancellor for life. Experience had shown that a permanent 
guardian of University property was needed. The maintenance 
of buildings, the up-keep of farms, the supervision of new works, 
the enforcement of the University’s claims to the goods of felons, 
these and similar tasks were duties which it was clear that the 
Vice-Chancellor and Proctors could not find adequate time to 
discharge. 
University fees were ‘‘ various and multiple.” It was to the 
interest of all that they should be known and understood. The 
fees payable to the University, its officers and servants were, 
after strict examination, to be placarded in tables in the Apody- 
terium for all to see. The fees set out in the original copy of 
2 “Cum altero Bedello”’ (S. iii). 
2 “ Clericus sive Aedituus Universitatis, qui et Campanarum pulsator 
dicitur ’”’ (S. iv).

the tables, sealed with the Chancellor-Archbishop’s seal, and 
kept with the authentic copy of the Statutes, were on no pretext 
to be exceeded. And no proposal to increase them could be 
made unless the Chancellor had first taken the opinion of the 
Heads upon the subject. Laud was as determined as his master 
to prevent abuses on this score. The great Chest of Five Keys, 
kept at Corpus, was to hold the University revenues, its jewels 
and plate.1_ The charters and muniments were to be kept in 
presses 2; the Keeper of the Archives made inventories of them : 
the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors had the keys. The Common 
Seal of the Chancellor and Masters, the special seal of Convo- 
cation,? was placed in the same keeping. The University had 
three seals for different uses, differing in size. One clause of the 
twentieth Title recited that the cost of the new Schools had 
rendered necessary certain ‘temporary charges for degrees, dis- 
pensations and admissions, in place of the entertainments and 
expenses formerly allowed, and added that these charges must 
in future be made permanent, to provide for the repair of the 
fabric which was badly built. Any money left over was to go 
to maintain the Press, and to bring to light manuscripts buried 
in the Public Library, which ill deserved to be for ever wrestling 
with the moths and worms. Another clause provided a sand- 
glass for the Bodleian: the hours of admission had been short- 
ened by the “ unequal going of the Clock.” 5 And a final clause 
of the same Title arranged for the better keeping of the streets. 
Their condition was sometimes indecorous and unhealthy. There 
were places stuffed with dirt and refuse, places without any 
paving at all. Every individual was required in future to lay 
down a level stone pavement in front of his door. He was for- 
bidden to take advantage of wet weather to empty his rubbish 
into the road. The University must appoint a Scavenger, and 
all householders must contribute to pay him. Every house and

Merton, the Dean of Christ Church, the President of Corpus, and the 
Warden of New College.

details given in Tit. XX, c. 2.) 
3 But Congregation might use it to seal Letters Testimonial (Tit. 
SEK, C.3)s 
« See the details set out (c. 4). The extra charges were appreciable. 
Among others, entertainments due from Inceptors had been commuted 
for fixed payments, a fee of {ro substituted for the gloves presented by 
Doctors at the Act, new fees imposed for dispensations, and new payments 
(2s. 6d, from a Plebeian’sson, 5s. froma Gentleman’s son, &c.) required from 
students on their admission to Colleges or Halls. 
5 Twyne’s prejudice against the first Librarian ought perhaps to be 
borne in mind, There are one or two other provisions about the Bodleian 
(c. 5).

Hall and College must hang out a lamp over its door, from six 
to nine on winter nights, from the Feast of All Souls to the Feast 
of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin. The rigid Calvinists 
of an older generation, rather than accept such a marking of the 
Calendar, might have preferred to “‘ grope blindly in the dark.” 
The last, the twenty-first, Title of the Statutes was devoted 
to the procedure of the University Courts, whose right to deter- 
mine all suits concerning Scholars and other Privileged Persons, 
“stretched back beyond the memory of man.” To despatch 
causes of greater moment, the Vice-Chancellor’s Court was held 
every Friday in the North Chapel of St. Mary’s.? The rules 
for business were laid down.? Lighter causes—matters of 
twenty shillings or less, injuries which hurt neither body nor 
reputation—were distinguished from those of more importance, 
But even in light causes the procedure occupied three days * 
The right of purgation still remained in theory for suspected 
persons where evidence was wanting, and, if ever resorted to, 
failure in it would presumably be held equivalent to conviction 5 
An offender who fled before authority, conscious of guilt, or 
who failed to submit to summons or sentence, was to be forth- 
with pronounced a banished man A boycott was still a strong 
weapon against townsmen, who were generally foes. Disturbers 
of the peace and persons guilty of certain other serious offences, 
libel, assault, night-wandering, drunkenness, adultery, seditious 
sermons—the climax of them all ’—were refused the right of 
appeal. Appeals, when allowed, lay from the Chancellor or his 
deputy first to Congregation, then to Convocation,’ and finally 
to the Crown.® 
1 Except in cases of Freehold, Mayhem, Felony and Treason (c. 1). 
® Or in some other place assigned. The Vice-Chancellor or his deputy 
presided, the Proctors if they thought fit assisted ; and after hearing the 
Proctors for Suits (‘‘ ad Lites ’’), the Court proceeded according to custom, 
and decided “‘ quae ad Causas ordinandas et determinandas conducent ”’ 
(c. 2). The Vice-Chancellor could deal with many questions, e.g. small 
criminal cases, in his own lodgings (c. 10).

and the Proctors for causes, in all of whom legal knowledge was required

was doubtful, certain Doctors or Masters were nominated, including the

(c. 17). 
8 For Appeals the Proctors nominated yearly 7 Judges Delegate in 
Congregation and 9 in Convocation, representing Theology, Law, Medicine 
and Arts. Their decision by a majority was sufficient (c, 20). Appeals 
could proceed in vacation as well as in term (c. 22),

  340 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The Appendix to the Laudian Statutes included special 
edicts of importance, supplementing the more ancient code. 
It included the ordinance establishing the Lady Margaret Reader 
of Theology in 1502. It included the Bodleian Statutes of 1610, 
and ordinances by the Library Curators issued in 1613, 1615 
and 1621. It included also the special ordinances for the Savilian 
Professorships, and for the Lectures founded by Sir William 
Sedley, Dr. White, Richard Tomlins and Dr. Heather. It recited 
the Caroline Statute which instituted the Proctorial Cycle in 
1628. And it set out in a valuable document the seventeenth- 
century regulations for the government of the Halls.+ 
The Aularian Statutes of Laud’s day differ more in form 
than in spirit from the fifteenth-century code. The whole system 
was more regularly organised. The rules had become more 
definite and complete. No-one, Commoner, batteler or any 
other, was to be admitted to a Hall, before he arrived in the 
University with his furniture and books to stay. He must 
find quarters in the building or its annexes. No student once 
admitted must lodge in the town after completing his twelfth 
year.2. On admission, oaths were taken,® caution-money paid 
over, tutors assigned. Prayers, sermons, graces at meals were 
provided for; during dinner a chapter of Holy Scripture was 
to be read by a Bible Clerk. A Catechist instructed all under- 
graduates once a fortnight. Lectures in logic and philosophy, 
repetitions, disputations and declamations were arranged. 
Every member, before seeking his Grace for a degree, must 
submit to public examination by the Principal or his Deputy. 
The rules for conduct still recalled the discipline of medizval 
days. Unhonest games, inordinate hair, solitary walks, dis- 
reputable gossip, knives and dogs and noise and brawling were as 
unpopular with the authorities as ever, and perhaps as popular 
1 These Statuta Aularia (Griffiths’ Laudian Statutes, 267-85) should be 
compared with the older Hall Statutes printed by Dean Rashdall (Univer- 
sities, II, 767-80). They are followed in Griffiths’ edition by the Epinomis 
or additional clause explaining the obligation of the oathsinvolved, by the 
confirmatory Letters of Chancellor and King, and by various Addenda, 
both to the Corpus and to the Appendix (pp. 297 sq.), which show how few 
changes the 17th century made. The Addenda to the Appendix include 
the rules of 1640 for Laud’s Arabic Lecturership, and similar ordinances 
of later date. The Addenda to the Corpus contain regulations of 1652, 
1661 and 1662, requiring two declamations before Inception ; provisions 
made after the Restoration for ‘“‘ censuring and damning ’”’ Acts committed 
in the Interregnum ; regulations for the Sheldonian Theatre, to which the 
Vesperiae and Comitia were transferred in 1669 ; and provisions in regard 
to the cost of Vesperial suppers, caution-money for Determining Bache- 
lors, and the qualifications of Registrars.

with the boys themselves. No-one must sleep out of his own 
bed. No-one, under penalty of a penny fine, might bring an 
unsheathed knife to table. No member except the Steward 
must go into the beer-cellar, or challenge another to drink deeper 
or faster than he. Latin was still the only language allowed 
within the precincts, except for persons over fifty years of age.t 
Dogmas disapproved of by the Church were punished by expul- 
sion. Extravagant expenditure was to be restrained by the 
Principal, to whom all honour and deference were due. 
As regards Principals the Code assumed that the old irregu- 
larities were over. Heads of Halls must now be men of mature 
years and solid character, at least Masters of Arts or Bachelors 
of Law or Medicine. They were elected by the members on the 
nomination of the Chancellor, and admitted by the Vice-Chan- 
cellor. They must never in future buy or sell their posts.? 
They must reside in the Halls, govern their conduct and enforce 
their rules. The Principals alone appointed the Hall servants 
—manciple, butler, cook, porter and the rest. Servitors had to 
help at meals. The Principals were responsible for the common 
goods. They disposed of rooms, but the rents were fixed by 
the Vice-Chancellor. They enforced the payments due at the 
end of every quarter for lectures and rent, and they might also, 
with the consent of the Commoners, levy a rate if expenses 
required. The Impositor, now definitely the Principal’s nominee, 
reported to him regularly breaches of the Statutes, and the 
Steward, another member of the Hall, appointed also every 
week, supervised the food and drink supplied. Copies of the 
Statutes were to be kept in all Halls and read out every term 
to the members. No-one must presume to hold them cheap. 
Corporal chastisement might in suitable cases take the place 
of fines for offences. But offenders who resisted punishment 
or conspired against authority must be expelled and denounced 
as rebels. 
The year which saw the ratification of the Statutes was 
rendered memorable also by a visit from the King. On Monday, 
the 29th August 1636, the Chancellor rode out in a coach along 
the Woodstock Road to meet him. Juxon, now Lord Treasurer, 
and three other Bishops came too. The Vice-Chancellor was 
there, with an eloquent oration. The Doctors and Masters on 
1 Strangers and illiterates might be addressed in the vulgar tongue. 
* They could not be Principals of two Halls at the same time, nor 
could they retain College Fellowships for more than 6 months after their 
election (S. V, c. 3). 
8 Sect. IX (c. 3). And the Principal must make no charge for admission. 
« The Impositor was an undergraduate (S. VI,c.1). The language of 
the old Hall Statutes (Rashdall, II, 778) suggests that in earlier days he 
was more independent of the Principal.

horseback were preceded by Bedels. They waited till the King 
and Queen appeared, in a coach with the two young Princes 
from the Palatinate, and knelt while the Vice-Chancellor dis- 
charged his speech. A bowshot nearer the City, the Mayor 
and Aldermen were ready, with another speech and another 
mace to be surrendered and restored. The townsmen, we are 
told, wore satin doublets and cloth breeches. The Mayor and 
Aldermen rivalled the Doctors with their scarlet-gowns.1_ The 
procession marched to St. John’s, where a third address was 
forthcoming, and on, past the companies of craftsmen ranged 
outside Bocardo, through the North Gate, down the streets to 
Christ Church by the usual route. But Wood notes, if his report 
may be relied on, that, though the ways were lined with people, 
neither scholars nor citizens ‘‘made any expressions of joy.” 
At Christ Church the Public Orator offered his welcome. The 
King was presented with a Bible ‘“‘ of Edinburgh print worth 
8ol',” the Queen with Camden’s Elizabeth.2 The disinherited 
Elector received a copy of Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity, and 
Prince Rupert a translation of Czsar’s Commentaries, which he 
perhaps preferred. The King accompanied the Queen to her 
lodgings, and then entered the Cathedral for prayer. But at 
the door * he knelt, and “lifting up his hands and eyes, with his 
long left lock . . . shelving over his shoulder, did his private 
devotions to his Maker.’”’ Charles was lodged at the Deanery, 
and that night after supper he saw a play acted in Christ Church 
Hall, William Strode’s tragi-comedy, The Floating Island, which, 
it seems, the King and the University liked better than the 
courtiers. Lord Carnarvon thought it one of the worst plays 
that he had ever seen. The scenery, however, exceeded all 
expectation. There was a large stage with elaborate “ parti-   
1 See Thomas Crosfield’s Diary (f. 77°). This Diary, beginning in 
1626, gives some interesting details in regard to contemporary history at 
Oxford and elsewhere. It is preserved in the Library of Queen’s College, 
with an admirable transcript made by the Provost. I have to thank Mr. 
Allen, the College Librarian, for allowing metoconsultit. Ihave borrowed 
points here from Crosfield, from Laud’s own account (Works, V, 148 sq.), 
from Wood (Amn. II, 407 sq.), and from Twyne (MS. XVII, 187-203). 
2 See Crosfield (Diary, 77°). Other accounts say a pair of gloves. 
% The large South door, says Wood ; but Laud, with more probability, 
says the West door. Dr. Morris, Professor of Hebrew, there made another 
speech. 
x « Strode, the Public Orator, was a not inconsiderable poet (see D.N.B.). 
Crosfield’s account of the play, which he calls ‘‘ Prudentius w" intellectus 
agens and ye rebellious passions ”’ (f. 77»), isnot very clear. ‘‘ Prudentius, 
the King depos’d,” and “‘ Intellectus Agens, his Counsellor,’”’ are char- 
acters init. The play, when published in 1655, was called The Floating 
Island. A line in the Epilogue, “ The Isle is setled, rage of Passions laid,” 
explains the other titles sometimes given it, 
 
-P-A-G-E-399

tions.” There was the “‘ perfect resemblance of the billows of 
the Sea rolling, and an artificial Island, with Churches and 
Houses waving up and down.”’ There were also rocks and trees 
and peeps of landscape, and a Chair which came gliding on to 
the stage “without any visible help.” Wood boldly claims 
that the scenery of the London play-houses of the Restoration 
had its origin in the inventiveness of Oxford scholars. Laud 
had taken pains to see that the necessary means were forth- 
coming, and that not only Christ Church but the whole Uni- 
versity bore its fair share of the cost.t 
Next day, Tuesday, the King heard service at eight in the 
Cathedral and “an excellent sermon ”’ from one of the Proctors, 
demonstrating the Royal authority over Anabaptists, Puritans 
and Papists alike. It is significant perhaps of the Sovereign’s 
taste and of the change in academic fashion that Charles listened 
to no disputations, took no part in that ancient custom at St. 
Mary’s like Elizabeth and James. At nine the young Princes 
and others attended Convocation, and were made Masters of 
Arts. Sir Nathaniel Brent presented them. The Chancellor 
and Dr. Baylie the Vice-Chancellor made speeches in Latin. 
The Princes then visited ‘“‘ some of the fairest Colleges”? and 
returned to Christ Church to wait upon the King. The Queen, 
however, was not ready, so Charles and his retinue walked to 
Cat Street with the Archbishop, and went over the Bodleian 
and the new Schools. The King inspected the “ new building 
westward,” sat down by the great window of the Library, 
examined the manuscripts “in the closet,’ ascended into the 
gallery to see the coins. Laud apparently acted as showman, 
and Lord Pembroke and Montgomery’s son made “a very neat 
speech.” Presently the Queen arrived in a coach and carried 
the King to St. John’s for dinner. More buildings were in- 
spected—the Chancellor’s generous gift. A banquet was served 
in the new Library, with baked meats dressed up as Bishops and 
Doctors by the humour of the cook. And a play,? relieved by 
1 Laud insisted on the appointment of a Committee to supervise the 
expenditure on plays. The stage properties were to be stored up for future 
use, and to be lent to Colleges or Halls which wished to use them. The 
Vice-Chancellor was to keep one key and the Dean of Christ Church the 
other (Laud’s Works, V, 144-7). The Orders for the King’s entertainment 
provided that the University should pay £200. The older Colleges were 
rated according to the Elizabethan valuation ; the three latest Colleges 
were specially rated, and a poll-tax was levied on Commoners as well. 
Ordinary Commoners and Masters of Arts paid 5s. each, an Earl’s son as 
much as 33s. 4d., a batteler as little as 3s. 4d., and “‘ pooreschollars nothing,” 
if Crosfield be correct (Diary, 77*). In the quotation from Crosfield in 
Laud’s Works (V, 145 n.) the contribution for Earls’ sons is wrongly given 
as 23s. 4d.

another short banquet in the middle, was acted by St. John’s 
men. The Hall had been darkened, lit by candles and kept 
fresh and cool. Laud was at his best in serving his College and 
entertaining his friends. ‘“‘I thank God,” he writes, ‘I had 
that happiness, that all things were in very good order, and that 
no man went out at the gates, courtier or other, but content.” ? 
That night the King and Queen supped privately and then 
were present at another play in Christ Church Hall. The author, 
William Cartwright, was a well-known Christ Church man, and 
the play, The Royal Slave, a Persian story, gave great oppor- 
tunities for stage effect. A shining sun, a curious temple, delight- 
ful forests, and villages with men “‘ visibly appearing in them ” 
afforded another triumph for the scenic art of Inigo Jones. 
Queen Mary 2 was so delighted that she borrowed all the pro- 
perties for a repetition of the piece at Hampton Court, and 
wrote to say that she took it very kindly when they were sent. 
She would never allow them “to bee prostituted vpon any 
Mercenary Stage.”” But the Queen’s players, in the Archbishop’s 
opinion, were not as good actors as the University men. Early 
on the Wednesday morning the King and Queen left Oxford, 
much pleased with their entertainment. In the afternoon 
there was another Convocation, at which degrees were conferred. 
At night the Archbishop gave a dinner at St. John’s to Heads 
of Houses, Proctors, Doctors and other friends. He sat with 
them at table, and they were all very merry and glad. In 
Oxford and outside it Laud had attained the summit of his 
reputation. By the end of the week he was back at Croydon, 
with his retinue of forty or fifty horse. Men recalled the power 
and magnificence of Wolsey, and there was a noble generosity 
in the Archbishop’s dealings with the University he loved. But 
it was the generosity of a prudent man. Of all the plate brought 
or borrowed for the proceedings at Oxford, the King’s, the Lord 
Chamberlain’s, the goldsmiths’ and his own, he rejoiced to find 
that only two spoons had been lost. 
The silence of the crowds at Oxford may or may not have 
been significant. But difficulties were gathering in the Arch- 
1 Works (V, 152). Wood mentions (Athen. III, 756) a humorous 
account by E. Gayton, of the ‘‘ Banquet presented to the best of Kings 
by the best of Prelates.’’ In the new Library the King, Queen and Pals- 
grave dined at the upper table, Prince Rupert and the lords and ladies at 
another. There were 13 other tables, Laud adds, prepared in other rooms. 
The Elector and Prince Rupert were entered on the books both at St. 
John’s and at Christ Church. Verses on the Royal visit to Oxford will 
be found in Bodley MS. Ashmole 36 (pp. 259 and 316). 
2 This was Henrietta Maria’s usual designation in England. Her 
letter of Dec. 6, 1636, quoted above, was reproduced recently in the 
Bodleian Quarterly Record (II, 151-2).

  ARCHBISHOP LAUD AND THE CAROLINE CODE 345 
bishop’s path. He could still occupy himself with questions of 
University discipline and order, for the “faction” of his oppo- 
nents was growing stronger daily. Oxford men crowded to 
hear the new examinations. Frewen declared that they had 
a most stimulating effect.1. But some found the requirements 
of the new Statutes too exacting, and began “‘ slipping aside ” 
to Cambridge and getting degrees there. Laud bade the Vice- 
Chancellor make strong representations on this point at Cam- 
bridge, and these were very graciously received. Meanwhile 
he rebuked abuses as sternly as ever, especially the ‘“‘ foul abuse ” 
of men taking College livings and staying on in Oxford regardless 
of their cures. He was resolved to purge the University of non- 
residents like that. He scolded Dr. Fell of Christ Church sharply 
for showing disrespect to the Proctor. ‘‘ You have carried this 
business like a sudden, hasty, and weak man.” He repeated 
his scolding when Fell slighted the University examinations by 
having the Christ Church men examined afresh. He liked to 
be kept informed of what was going on in Oxford—to hear of 
the “outlandish workmen” sent down for the new Physick 
Garden, of the tavern keepers ‘‘ snarling” over licenses, of a 
dunce of New Inn who could not distinguish guisquis from quisque, 
of rebellious chandlers who would not sell candles at the price 
the Vice-Chancellor fixed. He was deeply interested in the 
repair of St. Mary’s steeple, shocked at the defective timber-work 
discovered in the new Schools. But graver troubles were to 
absorb him soon. There is a curious echo of them in an indignant 
letter written from Lambeth on the 7th June 1638. “I pray 
instantly call a congregation and change the first question of 
the three appointed for the act.” Busy fools, inconsiderate, 
bold young men had proposed to discuss in disputations the 
changes made in the Scottish Liturgy.2 What had the Vice- 
Chancellor, what had Congregation, been about to allow such a 
proposal to pass? The Archbishop’s worst enemy could not 
have found a more cunning way to wound him in the house of 
his friends. 
But there was no suppressing such awkward questions, either 
at Oxford or elsewhere. Scotland indeed was already in a 
flame. It was vain for the “‘ Pope of Canterbury ” to talk of a 
few milkmaids scolding at the Bishops. It was vain for Went- 
worth to throw his strength and his genius into a failing cause. 
The Covenanters gathered their forces. The Short Parliament 
met and was dissolved. When Parliament had separated, Laud

candidates (see Laud’s Works, V, 235 and 290).

carried through Convocation new Canons asserting the Divine 
Right of the King, and calling on all members of the Universities 
to swear to maintain the government of the Church by Bishops, 
Deans, Archdeacons, etcetera. Men mocked at the etcetera 
oath. Even in Oxford “troubles and tokens of approaching 
tuin’’ appeared. Old rivalries with the City revived. Twice 
in the early winter nights of 1641, the great bell of St. Martin’s 
was rung, to summon the citizens to battle in the streets, The 
Puritans grew bolder. A caricature of a Roundhead, “a godly 
gentleman, a manciple of one of the Colleges,” was set up on a 
Maypole in Holywell, and students from New Inn and Magdalen 
Hall, it was asserted, turned out in arms and plucked it down.t 
The Long Parliament was already in session at Westminster— 
the University had sent up John Selden and Sir Thomas Roe ? 
—and within a few weeks of its meeting Laud’s and Strafford’s 
system had been levelled with the dust. Charges soon accu- 
mulated against the Archbishop—grave charges of Popish 
practices, of tyranny and treason. In December 1640 the 
Heads of Houses intervened, in loyalty to their Chancellor, to 
repudiate at any rate the first. ‘‘ We neither know, nor can 
probably suspect any member of our University to be a papist, 
or popishly addicted.” 3 A few days later the Archbishop was 
impeached. The House of Commons had already taken the 
Oxford Puritans under its protection. Henry Wilkinson’s 
suspension was cancelled. The Vice-Chancellor was summoned 
to Westminster and examined. The Statutes and Registers 
of the University were sent for, probably to serve as evidence 
against its Chancellor, and possibly with a view to University 
reform. 
Oxford, with its memories of the Reformation, could not 
view unmoved attacks uponthe Church. On the 24th April 1641 
a crowded Convocation appealed to Parliament to protect the 
Bishops and Cathedral endowments. The House of Commons 
gave little heed to the protest, but the King assured the peti- 
tioners that he would never allow the Church to be destroyed 
1 In Wood’s Life (I, 49) a different version of this incident is given,

or robbed. Other petitions and counter-petitions flowed in. 
A new Committee for the University was appointed. Some 
demands for subscription were dispensed with. The Commons 
ordained that graduates and students should no longer be re- 
quired to bow towards the altar or to subscribe to the three 
articles of 1604. They insisted that the altars at the East end 
of College Chapels, the images and crucifixes and candlesticks 
should be removed. But they also demanded a new oath to 
defend the Protestant religion against Popery. The demand 
produced a fresh crop of objections, and old Dr. Kettell, who 
had taken oaths enough in his lifetime, waved it aside. Power- 
ful voices called for the purging of the Universities, “the two 
famous fountains of our Kingdom,” and claimed that ecclesi- 
astics should no longer meddle with secular affairs. Manchester 
petitioned for a new University in the North. Milton declared 
that the gentry of England, fed with “scragged and thorny 
lectures of monkish and miserable sophistry,’ + were being 
trained for the service of “ Prelaty”” instead of the service of 
God. 
Worse trials were in store for loyal churchmen, who could 
not separate their loyalty from obedience to the King. Laud in 
the Tower awaited his trial, forgotten for the time, it seemed, 
even by the unsleeping enmity of Prynne. He prayed for 
patience in adversity. He found comfort in prayer, in studying 
the Psalms. ‘‘ Blessed is the man whom Thou chastenest, 
O Lord, and teachest him in Thy law.” His letter resigning the 
office of Chancellor, written to the University on June 25, 1641, 
within a few weeks of Strafford’s execution, had a touch of 
dignity and pathos which even his enemies would not have 
denied. His spirit was not broken. “‘I had no reason to desert 
my Selfe, and occasion the World to think me guilty.” ? His 
tender thought of Oxford, his “‘ ferventnesse and zeale to the 
publique good and happiness of that Place,” were unshaken as 
ever. But he felt that he could be “‘ no farther usefull,” and that 
his resignation ought not to be longer delayed. He prayed for

and ‘‘ published by occasion of a base Libell and Forgery that runs under 
this title.” The ‘“ base Libell and Forgery,” dated 28 June, 1641—a date 
which even Prof. Gardiner accepted (D.N.B.)—and printed in that year, 
is known in more than one version. It is reprinted in Laud’s Works (1853, 
V, 298 sq.)—where the True Copie is also printed—from the Second volume 
of Laud’s Remains (1700, p. 217). It is more pathetic than the genuine 
letter, but less assured in tone. Mr. Madan has valuable notes on the sub- 
ject (Oxford Books, II, 152), which remind us of Wood’s explanation why 
the letter was not inserted in the University Register at the time.

Body ” which he loved. 
Laud failed. He must have known his failure. He had 
grave faults of temper and of judgment, which it was difficult 
for others to forgive. It was better for freedom, better for 
religion, that his methods of government should not prevail. 
But he triumphed in death over the rancours which assailed 
him. The elements of truth in the lost cause for which he 
suffered were destined to survive its loss. And, whatever may 
be thought of his opinions, which have powerfully influenced 
generations since, no one will doubt his deep affection for the 
great University which reared him, ‘or his claim to illustrious 
remembrance among the most devoted of her sons.

CHAPTER XVIII 
THE GREAT REBELLION 
ONG before Laud’s resignation reached Oxford, men were 
listening anxiously to the mutterings of the storm. And 
the Archbishop’s successor in the Chancellorship was 
ill qualified to give the University protection. Philip, Earl of 
Pembroke and Montgomery, had for half a century been a con- 
spicuous figure in English life. A New College man at the age of 
eight,1 the suitor of an heiress at the age of thirteen, a spoilt 
favourite of James I created an Earl at the age of twenty, he 
had been famed for little but the beauty of his person, his violent 
tongue and his passion for sport. He had something of his 
brother’s taste and magnificence. He made his house at Wil- 
ton splendid, though he railed against ‘‘ Iniquity Jones.” His 
gardens were called the noblest in England. He collected, says 
Aubrey, more Vandycks than anyone else in the world. But 
Pembroke’s morals had from boyhood been the morals of the 
Jacobean Court. His oaths were as notorious as his bad temper. 
He was always quarrelling, and with men of all conditions. His 
political views seem to have been dictated largely by personal 
pique. He chose the side of the Parliament, but was ready 
enough to negotiate with the King. He denounced Laud in his 
day of trial as a rascal and a villain. He described his own 
Parliamentary colleagues as a pack of knaves. Royalist satirists 
mocked at him freely. They professed to chronicle his speeches 
“ Word for Word, and Oath for Oath.” They suggested that he 
would make an excellent Chancellor, if only the University 
could be turned into a Kennel. When Oxford fell and Pembroke 
appeared with the Parliamentary Visitors in triumph, Royalist 
lampoons were merciless in attacking his character, his actions 
and the ‘“‘ Gowne Seekers ” in his train.? 
A very different representative of Oxford, born in the same 
year but bred in different ways, chose like Pembroke the popular 
side, but won through life the respect of his opponents. John

  350 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Selden left Hart Hall while Elizabeth was still reigning, to be- 
come one of the most famous jurists of the succeeding age. His 
study of tithes made him a critic of the Church. His study of 
the constitution brought him into conflict with the Crown. His 
study of law made him an authority on public right in Europe. 
He was one of the first Englishmen to plead, with Coke and 
Eliot, for legality and freedom. The University elected him to 
the Long Parliament, and few men played in it a franker, saner, 
more honourable part. No more impressive advocate of pre- 
cedent and principle raised his voice among those warring 
counsels. No University Member had more care for his con- 
stituents, though he remained with the Roundheads at West- 
minster while his constituency became a camp of Cavaliers, 
Selden’s heart was in the things which Oxford loved. He was 
a life-long student, ambitious of all kinds of knowledge. The 
books which he bequeathed to the Bodleian bespoke his many- 
sidedness. His memory was proverbial. His learning was 
universally admitted. His Table Talk, not published till long 
after, was an indication of strong intellect and trenchant speech. 
Ben Jonson, Clarendon and Whitelocke all bore witness to his 
range of understanding. Laud valued his friendship. Charles 
would gladly have brought him into office. But Selden pre- 
ferred to follow his own course. As the years passed, his distaste 
for political extremes perhaps weakened his effectiveness in 
politics. He was less and less inclined to leave his studies, 
except to speak out on rare occasions against what seemed to 
him treachery or baseness, or to protect the University, his 
“declining, undon mother,” when the Vice-Chancellor appealed 
to him in affliction and defeat.t 
The preparations for Civil War soon found an echo at Oxford. 
In June 1642 the King sent the Vice-Chancellor a proclamation 
to publish,? and invited the University to print his manifestoes. 
1 See Samuel Fell’s letter of 1646 in Bodley MS. Wood F. 35 (f. 15). 
2 HIS MAIESTIES ANSVVER to the Remonstrance of Parliament 
was printed by L. Lichfield in Oxford. (See Madan’s note, Oxford Books, 
II, 160). Mr. Madan’s well-known work is an invaluable guide to the 
literature and history of the Civil War: and the great chronological 
collection of tracts, etc., from the beginning of the war made by George 
Thomason, the London bookseller who counted John Milton and Thomas 
Barlow among his friends, housed now in the British Museum, and finely 
indexed by Mr. G. K. Fortescue whose numbering I quote, is in itself a 
library on the subject. Thomason’s Tracts, the publications described 
by Mr. Madan, the collection of Civil War Pamphlets at Worcester College, 
which I have been allowed to consult, the contemporary Registers of 
Congregation and Convocation, the most important of which is Sb (the 
Acta Convocationis of 1641-47), the Clarendon State Papers in the Bodleian 
and the great store of MSS. there by Wood, Twyne and others—Wood

THE GREAT REBELLION 351 
On July 1z Dr. Prideaux1 produced in Convocation a letter 
from Charles, denouncing the “‘ false and scandalous pretence ” 
that he intended to make war upon his Parliament, but in- 
timating that he would appreciate a loan of any moneys 
which the University could spare. The claim, grounded on the 
Sovereign’s perpetual care for ‘‘such nurseries of Learning,” 
was accepted apparently without demur. The contents of the 
University Chests were placed at the Royal disposal. Eight 
hundred and sixty pounds were handed to the King’s messenger, 
and Charles promptly acknowledged an “‘ action so full of Loyaltie 
and Allegiance.” ? Other contributions followed. The Colleges 
joined in. On July 20, 1642 Nicholas wrote that the University 
had “voluntarily sent in 10,000/.’’* Parliament naturally 
thought these proceedings “‘ wicked and unlawful,” and ordered 
the arrest of Prideaux and Frewen, of Dean Fell and Dr. Potter 
of Queen’s. The King bade his representatives see to the safety 
of Oxford. His proclamation for suppressing the rebellion was 
published in the market on August 13. Dr. Pinke of New College, 
acting for Prideaux, who had withdrawn to avoid complications, 
began to take measures for the University’s defence. The 
privileged men were summoned to the Schools for a view of 
arms,* and a great many scholars appeared among them. On 
the 18th August University volunteers, some three hundred 
and thirty strong, marched to Christ Church, and were drilled 
in the quadrangle. Two days later they met at the Schools 
and marched to New Park. Two squads of musketeers, one 
of pikes and one of halberds, were put through their “‘ postures ” 
and “‘ skirmished together in a very decent manner.”” Graduates 
and undergraduates, Masters and scholars, even divines, turned 
Parliamentary Visitation—Mr. Madan’s Rough List of Manuscript Mate- 
vials, and the innumerable printed documents, memoirs and histories, 
headed by the work of Dr. Gardiner and Sir C. H. Firth, offer a wealth 
of material to which it is difficult in this chapter to do justice, though I 
have drawn on it as freely as I could. Of the Civil War I have attempted 
no description except in so far as it touches University history: but 
even on that aspect of it more than one chapter might be written. 
1 Prideaux was Vice-Chancellor. He had been Bishop of Worcester 
since December 1641, and his diocese claimed him during the War. In 
January 1642 he had assembled the Heads of Houses and ‘‘ found a most 
ready and hearty concurrence in all for the King’s service” (Cal. State 
Papers, Domestic, 1641-43, p. 258). Dr. Pinke was acting as Pro-Vice- 
Chancellor about the end of July: Dr. Tolson of Oriel followed in Sep- 
tember. 2 Register Sb (7).

proposed to send it to the King (Hist. of Rebellion, ed. 1826, III, 245, n.).

out. Dr. Read of New College, soon to be Principal of Magdalen 
Hall, served among the pikemen. The Cooks’ corporation 
supplied drums and colours. The road over Magdalen Bridge 
was blocked. Loads of stones were carried up the tower, “ to 
flinge downe uppon the enemie at their entrance.” The road 
through Smith Gate was made impassable for horsemen. A 
crooked trench was dug across the way at the end of St. John’s 
Walks. Sentinels were set. The drilling and marching were 
repeated. In the grounds of New College eight or ten companies 
appeared. Volunteers increased in numbers, and studies went 
by the board. The citizens took no part in these proceedings. 
But the undergraduates threw themselves into the excitement, 
and “‘ Mr. Wood’s father foresaw that if his sons were not removed 
from Oxon they would be spoyl’d.” 
Before the end of August a small body of Royalist troopers 
under Sir John Byron entered Oxford at midnight by New Park, 
and created such a scare that some of the citizens made off to 
Abingdon. Dr. Pinke met the King’s officers in conference. 
Delegates were appointed to see to the University’s safety. 
Fortifications were discussed, and bows and arrows bought. The 
scholars fraternised with the troopers and proposed to help 
them take up Oseney bridge. But the City train-bands, muster- 
ing at Broken Hays, intervened to prevent this. The City 
leaders were already applying to Parliament for support. The 
Parliamentary forces were dangerously near, and the University 
leaders thought it wise to make overtures to them. Dr. Pinke 
appealed to Pembroke—to be saved from having ‘‘ our Libraries 
fired, our Colleges pillaged, and our throats cut ’—an appeal 
which was chillingly received.2 And going over to visit the 
Parliamentary leaders at Aylesbury, he found himself arrested 
and sent off to London. On the roth September Byron left 
Oxford, ‘‘ with as many scholars as could get horses and arms,” ® 
and two days later a Parliamentary troop rodein. Their Colonel, 
Goodwin, took up his quarters at Merton. Their horses were 
picketed in Christ Church meadow. The troops marvelled at 
the “‘ painted idolatrous windows,’ and at Magdalen some are 
alleged to have been broken. On the r4th Lord Saye, Lord- 
Lieutenant by the Parliament’s authority, arrived and demol- 
ished the new fortifications.4 Saye, ‘‘ bred a scholar, and (though

nobly born) a fellow of New College,” treated the Colleges tenderly 
enough. He searched them for arms, but he spared their treas- 
ures: he was afterwards blamed for not seizing their plate. 
But when he found attempts made to hide College property, as 
at University and Christ Church, he carried it off. Dr. Pinke’s 
study was searched. The Dean of Christ Church’s trunks were 
carted away. Popish books and pictures were burned. A brace 
of bullets was fired at the Virgin’s statue over St. Mary’s porch. 
The City train-bands were reviewed and encouraged. A few 
arrests were made. Rash townsmen suffered for crying “A 
pox upon all Roundheads.” There was trouble with a certain 
Captain Staggars ‘‘ whom the schollers much distasted.’’ There 
was trouble among the soldiers, who quarrelled and fought in 
the High Street. There was talk of garrisoning Oxford for the 
Parliament. Whitelocke advised it, and might have acted as 
Governor. But he became Governor of Henley and of his house 
at Phyllis Court instead. Rogers of New Inn Hall also advised 
it. But “ Old Subtlety,” 1 showing perhaps less subtlety than 
usual, allowed the opportunity to slip. Before the end of Sep- 
tember Saye left Oxford, though blue coats, russet coats and 
“dragoners ” continued to march through. A month later, on 
the 29th October, the King rode in, preceded by the colours 
_ captured at Edgehill, and all chance of securing Oxford for the 
Parliament disappeared. 
From that day forward Oxford became the head-quarters of 
the Royal army, the Court and capital of the Cavaliers. ‘‘ The 
heart of a Prince,” Charles told the University on his arrival, 
“is kept warme with the blood of his subjects ... You have 
God for your cause, you have me for his second.” The King’s 
foot-soldiers were billeted about it. His Horse, says Twyne, 
marched through to Abingdon, showing themselves four thousand 
strong. His “ordinance and great guns” were driven into 
Magdalen Grove. The Puritan element in the town realised 
that all possibility of resistance was over, and either submitted

authority for these early days in Oxford. The original, written by 
Twyne, is now MS. Ballard 68 in the Bodleian, with notes by Wood to 
whom it once belonged. It was copied by Hearne, while in the possession 
of Thomas Rawlins, and Hearne’s copy is now also in the Bodleian (MS. 
Rawl, B, 225). Hearne printed it in 1733 (Chronicon de Dunstaple, II,

earlier part of it. Dr, Clark reprinted it in 1891 in the first volume of 
his Life of Wood (53 sq.).

or disappeared. The Mayor met Charles at Carfax with a gift 
of money. The beautiful, old, slumbering city woke to new life 
with no ignoble passion, in defence of the Church which it loved 
and of the King to whom it thought its honour bound it. But 
the new life was not the tranquil life of learning. It was the 
stir and riot of a camp. 
“Instead of Logicke, Physicke, School-converse,” wrote an 
undergraduate and eye-witness, who rashly attempted a history 
of the Civil War in rhyme, 
“‘T did attend the armed troops of Mars, 
Instead of Books I Sword, Horse, Pistols bought, 
And on the Field I for Degrees then fought.” + ? 
Protected on three sides by streams and marshes, held by a con- 
siderable army, and encircled by garrisons and fortified posts, 
Oxford offered a formidable position for defence. If sufficient 
food and ammunition were forthcoming, it could defy the forces 
brought against it. And the King lost no time in strengthening 
the place. The City was disarmed. Its muskets and powder 
were lodged in the Tower of the Schools and in the cloisters of 
New College. Arms were called in and distributed among the 
defenders.? House-holders were summoned by the University 
Bell-man to work on the fortifications. The approach from the 
East was made secure? Works were begun in St. Clement’s 
parish.4 Trenches were dug in the New Park. ‘“ Bulworks ” 
were set up near St. Giles’ Church and St. John’s College Walks 
—though one day in December, when the King rode out to see 
them, he found only twelve men working there on behalf of the 
City, whereas there should have been a hundred and twenty-two. 
Lists of University men able to take part in the defence of Oxford 
were drawn up. The first master of war in that age, Gustavus, 
had been “‘a great spademan,” and some at least of the King’s 
officers, Rupert among them, had learned the value of spade- 
work as well as of mobility in war.5 
Fellows and scholars alike had to take their turn at digging.

THE GREAT REBELLION 355 
All members of Colleges and Halls between sixteen and sixty 
were required to give in their names for work one day a week. 
The hours were from six to eleven and from one to six.!_ Before 
the siege was over the North side of the City was defended by 
bulwarks regularly flanking one another. The Ditch or Trench 
was strongly pallisadoed, and pits dug to prevent approach. 
There were fortifications also raised in Christ Church meadow. 
But on the West and South the locks and sluices made it possible 
to flood the country-side.2- Magdalen Tower became a point of 
observation, where Charles himself could watch the movement 
of the armies. In the Walks below trees were felled and batteries 
erected, and arrangements for flooding the College meadows 
were made. The stout old walls of New College formed a fortress. 
Victuals were stored in Brasenose Tower. At Oseney a powder- 
factory was established, at Wolvercote a “ mill” for grinding 
swords.? Food stores were kept in the Guildhall, corn in the 
Law and Logic Schools, cloth for soldiers’ coats in the Astronomy 
and Music Schools. Four or five thousand tailors, it was said, 
were set to cut these out. “ Fatt great oxen” were swept into 
Christ Church quadrangle, flocks of sheep, “ true pillages from 
his majestie’s enemies,” driven in by Rupert’s Cavaliers. There 
was perpetual going to and fro, movements of troops, of colours, 
prisoners, trumpeters, King’s men, fine gentlemen in all their 
bravery, drums and music, musters and processions, the whole 
apparel and panoply of war. Bells rang for good news. Bon- 
fires blazed for victories. For any conspicuous triumph a 
solemn anthem in the Cathedral would be sung. 
From the first there were two grave preoccupations, how to 
raise money to pay the army, and how to secure ammunition 
for the guns. The Queen was in Holland, pawning the Crown 
jewels and collecting arms and munitions. Every one had to 
submit to levies: the counties round Oxford did not escape. 
In January 1643 a sum of three hundred pounds still remaining 
in the University’s Treasury was granted,5 and in the same 
month the King asked for the plate of the Colleges and Halls.® 
1 See the King’s Proclamations of June and July 1643—the latter 
included women and nobles—and of July and August 1645, which required 
work four days a week, cited by Mr. Madan (Oxf. Books, II, 267, 279 and

  356 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
With some reluctance but with very few exceptions the invitation 
was obeyed. Magdalen, All Souls and Exeter gave most. St. 
John’s sent eight hundred pounds instead, but ultimately gave 
up its plate as well. One or two Colleges may have delayed 
over the sacrifice. Corpus is under strong suspicion of evading 
it. It is not impossible that some silver was hidden away. A 
few Founders’ gifts or very precious pieces and the communion 
vessels of the Chapels were in most cases reserved. But the 
response generally made a virtue of necessity, and the Royal 
Mint was set up at New Inn Hall. The Puritan undergraduates 
must already have discovered that New Inn Hall was no longer 
a fit place for them. In June more money had to be raised. The 
King appealed to every Fellow of a College to maintain one or 
more foot-soldiers at four shillings a week. The army pay was 
often in arrear. Funds were needed for fortifications. College 
rents were failing in the districts where Parliament had the 
ascendency. The University in old days had helped to finance 
Simon de Montfort ; but that was not comparable to the burden 
of financing its legitimate King. 
As the war went on embarrassments increased. Soldiers 
and civilians disagreed. The Court was a prey to every rumour, 
excited by tales of victory, depressed by tidings of defeat. 
The taverns for a time ran short of wine, which increased the 
feeling of dejection. One day camp fever broke out in the 
army. Another day Christ Church steeple was badly shaken 
by a storm. A third day a “most sad and wonderful fire ” 
ravaged the Western quarter of the city, caused, it was said, by 
a soldier roasting a stolen pig.1_ Doubters and deserters flowed 
in from Westminster, till, as the tide changed, they began to 
merely comments ‘all sent, except New Inn” (Ann. II, 458). The 
summary of the plate surrendered given in MS. Tanner 338, which is 
printed in J. Gutch’s Collectanea Curiosa (I, 227) and commented on by 
Dr. Bliss (see Wood’s Life, I, 94-5, n.) mentions 13 Colleges only as con- 
tributing, Magdalen with 296 Ib., All Souls with 253 lb., and Exeter with 
246 Ib. giving most. Christ Church, perhaps owing to Lord Saye’s action, 
yielded only 172 Ib., less than Trinity and a good deal less than Queen’s. 
Balliol gave least (41 Ib.) of those mentioned in this list. Wadham, 
which is omitted, gave 123 lb. New College, also omitted, seems to have 
no record on the subject. It kept some fine pieces but almost certainly 
gave up the rest. Pembroke has some plate of 1655, but nothing earlier. 
Corpus still possesses a suspiciously large store. St. John’s was doubly 
generous under pressure in the end. The Mint in New Inn Hall was at 
work in 1644. Ordnance was cast in the old chapel of St. Mary’s College 
(Oxf. Books, II, 201), On Thomas Rawlins, the medallist, and his Oxford 
coins, see D.N.B.

like Northumberland and Pembroke among them. But Pem- 
broke could no longer be tolerated by the Royalists, and in 
October 1643 the Marquis of Hertford was made Chancellor in 
his place The Parliament and the Law Courts were sum- 
moned to Oxford. On the 22nd January 1644 the King addressed 
both Lords and Commoners in Christ Church Hall.? But their 
meeting revealed the divisions among his friends. They showed 
more inclination to criticise than to help the Government, and 
their plea ‘‘ for the ease of tender consciences ” was too vague 
to influence events. 
The great movements of the War are no part of the University 
annals. But every man in Oxford must have watched them 
with an anxious heart. They saw the King at his head-quarters 
at Christ Church, always dignified and graceful in appearance, 
entrenched in a stronghold of the Church of England, to which 
at any rate his attachment was sincere, his young sons with him, 
Prince Charles, a boy of thirteen “ newly recovered of the 
Measells,” and James, still younger, who had been so nearly 
captured at Edgehill. They saw the Queen arrive in July 1643,4 
brought in by the King in triumph, the pageant filling the ancient 
streets, “the Trumpets and the loud Musick all sounding as 
they passed along.” They saw her shining in the Lodgings 
which Brent had abandoned at Merton—‘ fair as unshaded 
light,” the poet sang—the centre of gossip, of intrigue, of anim- 
ation, sure of her husband’s tender love, swaying not too wisely 
his unstable counsels, parting from him nine months later, un- 
conscious, happily, that they would never meet again. They 
saw Rupert “like a perpetual motion” dashing hither and 
thither with his splendid troopers, himself in his scarlet cloak 
on his great black Barbary horse the most splendid of them all 
—tiding off to encounter Hampden, to capture Bristol, to meet 
defeat at Marston Moor. They saw the troops of Essex and

preserved in Rushworth (Hist. Coll. Pt. III, v. 2, ch. xv). See also Oxford 
Books (II, 307).

1645, to represent the Royal cause in the West. James remained till 
the surrender.

speare’s daughter at New Place. The academic poets welcomed her with

358 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Waller trying to surround the Royal forces, the Parliamentary 
outposts at Eynsham and Islip, on Bullingdon Green, under 
Headington Hill.1 They saw Fairfax a year later threatening 
the city for a fortnight on the eve of Naseby, throwing his troops 
across the Cherwell, while Cromwell co-operated from his camp 
at Wytham.? They cannot have felt—few Englishmen felt— 
any satisfaction in that war “ without an enemy,” in its suffering, 
its vain negotiations, its indecisive triumphs, its long-delayed 
results, Even many Royalists must have felt the justice of 
the fine rebuke which Fairfax administered to Rupert for his 
acts of pillage. ‘Let all England judge whether the burning 
of its Towns, ruining its Cities, and destroying its people be a 
good requital from a person of your Family, which hath had the 
prayers, tears, purses, and blood of its Parliament and people.” * 
It is easy to understand the appeal which the King’s service 
made to high-hearted and adventurous boys. Young men of 
family and fashion, University men among them, were the first 
to flock to the Royal armies. Anthony Ashley Cooper came to 
Oxford to tender his uncertain help. John Evelyn served, and 
sent his “‘ black menage horse ” to serve in his place, when he 
retired abroad. There must have been undergraduates in the 
Auxiliary Regiment of scholars and strangers which Charles’ 
Parliament ordered to be raised for the defence of Oxford, and 
there were privileged men in Colonel Knightly’s Regiment of 
Sagitarii, Bowmen volunteers, for which the King asked the 
University to pay. John Fell and John Dolben of Christ Church 
joined the Colours at eighteen, and scores of their contemporaries 
followed their example. The older men were often as eager as 
the young ones. Peter Turner of Merton, the Professor, who 
marched off as a volunteer with Byron, and Ancketyll of Wad- 
ham, who won fame as priest and colonel, were only two of the 
better known. Ten years earlier Cecil, Lord Wimbledon, had 
urged the King to recommend horsemanship to the Universities, 
with a view to training the young gentlemen of England for use 
as cavalry in war. But whether trained or not the King’s 
Volunteer Guard of Noblemen and Gentlemen made a brave

show, and was not intended for show only, as jealousy alleged.? 
The voluntary system broke down, and gave way to the system 
of impressment : but from this the members of the University 
were exempt. The New Model arose with its unconquerable 
discipline. Victory only waited for the side which could train 
and organise its forces first. Fairfax noted that the Crown could 
make good soldiers, but that the Parliament made good men. 
“Tn our army,” the Royalists retorted, “‘we have the sins of 
men, (drinking and wenching), but in yours, you have those of 
devils, spirituall pride and rebellion.” # 
The Colleges, largely forsaken by the scholars, may not have 
been exempt from the sins which the Royalists allowed. 
Courtiers, politicians, soldiers, strangers of all sorts, women- 
folk of all conditions, made free with cloister and quadrangle, 
freer still with buttery and cellar. The University was still in 
being, but it was not in the nature of boyhood or of manhood 
to resist the distractions close at hand. At Oxford, as at Cam- 
bridge, the Schools grew daily desolate, the numbers thin, the 
revenues short. There was talk of establishing a College in 
London until free access to the Universities could be restored. 
Gowns fell under some suspicion as an excuse for avoiding 
military service. Lectures flagged. Those which continued 
were held at St. Mary’s, the Schools being required for purposes 
of war. The Act was suspended. The number of Inceptors 
and Determiners dropped heavily.’ The flow of freshmen 
practically ceased. Complimentary degrees, on the other hand, 
seemed to be more in fashion than ever, though the University 
protested against the loss of fees involved. The records of Con- 
vocation are full of recommendations from the King, the Chan- 
cellor, the Secretary of State, and other influential men. Charles 
asks for favours for Richard Rallingson, who has been so useful 
“in our fortifications,’ and for ten gentlemen, headed by Thomas 
Marshall of Lincoln, who have served for ten months in Lord 
Dover’s Regiment. Falkland begs for the Doctorate for Mr. 
Stamp, who has been turned out of a good living and has spent 
thirty-four weeks in prison. Hertford has many nominees, 
including Mr. John Wilson, his Majesty’s servant in ordinary,

360 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
“a person admirably exquisite in ye Art of Musicke.” Rupert 
pleads for a gentleman of Queen’s, ‘“‘ of a very ancient family, 
grandchild to a Bishopp.”” Even Newcastle at York has friends 
to push. Whatever party triumphs, these appeals for special 
degrees go on, appeals which the University is hardly ina position 
to refuse. Fairfax, Lambert, Lenthall, Cromwell, all had their 
candidates later—Cromwell characteristically desiring that one 
of his nominees so favoured may lay himself out “‘ for the glory 
of God and the good of Soules.”’1 The Chancellor’s Court 
continued to sit, but the entries in its Registers are brief and 
barren.? Disputations were still held. Humorous questions for 
discussion could still be set up “ by some busy Coxcomb ” on 
the North door of St. Mary’s Church : 
“An Ecclesia pura Scoticana debeat esse 
Moderatrix corrupte Ecclesize Anglicane? Aff. 
Respondente Alexandro Hendersono Scotorum Commissario. 
Opponente, quicunque vult.” 
But serious study was at a discount. The life had gone out 
even from ecclesiastical debates. 
Meanwhile the University Press was singularly busy. Royal 
proclamations poured from it, providing for the army, insisting 
upon discipline, denouncing the financial expedients of the 
Parliament, enforcing services and forms of prayer.3 The 
Cavaliers might, as their opponents declared, ‘‘ boast wonder- 
fully and swear most hellishly.”’* But there was daily service 
in the Royal camp. Duelling was forbidden, not always with 
success. Blasphemy was punishable by a red-hot iron thrust 
through the offender’s tongue. Even the University was re- 
minded by the ‘‘example of the Primitive Christians” of the 
necessity of prayer and fasting.» Duppa, now Bishop of Salis- 
bury, was the official prayer-writer.6 Sermons were frequently 
preached and published. Chillingworth indeed passed in August 
1643” from the pulpit to the camp, and died rather pitifully

Restoration was published with two imprints. One states that it was 
preached before the King at Reading, which would date it November

some five or six months later. But Archbishop Ussher was 
among the preachers at Oxford. So was Jeremy Taylor, who 
owed his All Souls’ Fellowship to Laud’s kindness, and who 
received a Doctor’s degree from the University in November 
1642. He had already pleaded for Episcopacy: his plea for 
Liberty of Prophesying was still to come. So was Thomas 
Fuller, the historian of the Church, who in 1643 withdrew from 
Westminster and came to Lincoln College, where his stay of 
seventeen weeks cost him, he avowed, more than seventeen 
years at Cambridge. If partisans found his love of peace de- 
pressing, he became Hopton’s Chaplain and won the favour of 
the King. And so, if the attribution to him be reliable, was 
John Birkenhead of All Souls.? 
Other matter besides sermons found its way through Lich- 
field’s and Hall’s presses, in spite of the preoccupations of war. 
Hammond continued to write upon theology. Langbaine, 
while guarding the Archives from profanation, found time to 
help Archbishop Ussher with his labours and to review the 
Covenant himself.? An occasional classic interrupted the “‘ erup- 
tion of Licentious Pamphlets.’ Astrological publications rashly 
foretold the triumph of the King.? Verses in Latin, English, 
even Greek, still gave vent to academic feelings. And political 
skits were of course a feature of the day. London tracts accusing 
the King’s officers of inhumanity ‘ produced sharp denials in 
the Royalist press, and Mercurius Aulicus, while upholding 
the conduct of its leaders, upheld also the spirit and the humour 
of the camp.5 The output of weekly papers kept both Oxford 
and London hard at work. Mercurius Aulicus, the chief Royalist 
organ, and the chief antagonist of the Parliament’s Mercurius 
Bnitannicus,® was edited and written by John Birkenhead, 
1642. The other states that it was preached “‘ at the publike Fast before 
his Majesty at Christ Church,” presumably in 1643 (Thomason Tract E. 
52, 16). The latter Mr. Madan condemns as a misdated, counterfeit 
London edition (Oxf. Books, II, 351-2). But I do not feel quite sure that 
the language of it always suits 1642 better than 1643. 
1 But this seems doubtful. See Mr. Madan’s note (Jb. 368). There 
is no other reason for thinking that Birkenhead was in Orders.

  362 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
with some help from Peter Heylyn in 1643 and 1644. It had 
imitators as well as opponents—copyright in title was unknown. 
The Royalists issued also a Mercurius Rusticus, a Mercurius 
Anti-Britannicus, and a Mercurius Academicus, while the title 
Mercurius Aquaticus was claimed for some effusions of the 
Water Poet. Birkenhead takes the first place among the Royalist 
journalists. Wood liked him little, and his claims to a Chair 
of Moral Philosophy ? might have been more closely scrutinised 
in times of peace. But his mocking wit delighted his party, 
and his writing had sometimes a literary quality which all his 
contemporaries did not share. Heylyn wrote as a rule more 
gravely, and enjoyed less popularity perhaps on that account. 
John Taylor, the Water Poet, on the other hand, rarely deviated 
into gravity. But his caricatures of Puritan opinions, his rough 
wit and irrepressible impudence kept the by-ways of controversy 
noisily alive. A part—a part only—of one of his interminable 
titles may serve as an example of his style. ‘ Crop-Eare curried, 
or Tom Nash His Ghost, Declaring the pruining of Prinnes 
two last Parricidicall Pamphlets . . . a short Survey and Ani- 
mad-versions of some of his falsities, fooleries, non-sense, blas- 
phemies. . .... With a strange Prophecy, reported to be 
Merlins, or Nimshag’s the Gymnosophist, and (by some Authours) 
it is said to be the famous Witch of Endor’s. Runton, Polli- 
munton Plumpizminot Papperphandico.” 3 
Other poets with methods less surprising shared or touched 
the life of Oxford during the war. Herrick indeed, a devoted 
Royalist, was buried in a Devonshire living and teaching his 
pig to drink out of a tankard. But Cowley, ejected from Cam- 
bridge, took refuge in Laud’s College and threw himself into 
the service of the King and Queen. Davenant fought in the 
war and was knighted at the siege of Gloucester. Henry Birk- 
head, ‘‘an excellent Latin poet’ and a “good Grecian,” as 
became a Fellow of All Souls, published Poematia which may 
have convinced his contemporaries of the need for a Professor- 
ship of Poetry in Oxford.t Sir John Denham, who had been 
imprisoned by the Parliament, devoted himself chiefly to squibs 
against the rebels. When George Wither, who served on the 
other side, was taken by the Royalist forces, Denham begged 
his life on the ground that none could call him the worst poet 
1 We hear also of a Mercurius Davidicus, a Mercurius Belgicus, a 
Mercurius Diutinus, etc. (Ib. 294-5, 430 and 499). 
* For Charles’ recommendation of him see Reg. Sb (24)—31 March 1643.

graphy in D.N.B. A Thames waterman by calling, Taylor kept a tavern 
in Oxford during the war.

  THE GREAT REBELLION 363, 
in England so long as Wither lived. Richard. Lovelace, another 
poet who found inspiration in imprisonment,! joined the King 
in Oxford before his armies were dispersed. Robert Mead, 
who won reputation by a play written while an undergraduate 
at Christ Church,? served with distinction during the siege. 
And a far greater poet than these, whose ancestors came from 
an Oxfordshire village and whose grandfather had been ranger 
of Shotover Forest, travelled down from London in the May 
days of 1643, indifferent to the roving horsemen of the King, 
to marry Mary Powell in the church at Forest Hill, A month 
later, when Hampden lay dying after Chalgrove Field, the young 
wife left her husband, and the outraged bridegroom settled down 
to write his angry, lofty pamphlet on divorce, and to demand 
a reform of the laws of marriage, which would “ wipe away 
ten thousand tears out of the life of man.” % 
Men of action also, in their day far more conspicuous, moved 
in that memorable pageant, gathered in College chambers for 
discussion, paced perhaps uneasily those courts and streets. 
The gentlest and tenderest of Charles’ counsellors found little 
but weariness in his Secretaryship of State. ‘In neglecting 
me,” Falkland once told Rupert, ‘you neglect the King.” 
But he had no power to enforce his ideals of peace and tolerance 
in that distracted Court. And when he rode out to his death 
at Newbury, clad in clean linen as one going to a banquet and 
fully determined to ‘be out of it ere night,” he carried into 
battle a broken heart. Edward Hyde may not have sought 
like Falkland that ampler ether, that diviner air. But he was 
on the whole the most trusted of the King’s advisers. Few 
men, among shifting and uncertain counsels, played a steadier 
part. None contributed more generously to the portraiture of 
others or drew incidentally a better portrait of himself. None 
from boyhood—he had gone up to Magdalen Hall at thirteen— 
proved himself more loyal or devoted to the University which 
cherishes his name. Edward Nicholas showed something of the 
same sagacity. He had been at Queen’s as an undergraduate. 
He became one of Charles’ principal Secretaries of State. Digby, 
the University’s Steward, had been a well-known undergraduate 
at Magdalen, but was neither sagacious nor fortunate as a 
Minister of the Crown. Hertford, the Chancellor who had sup-

the Gate-house at Westminster in 1642. Some of Wither’s best poems 
were written in the Marshalsea in earlier days.

planted Pembroke, was another Magdalen man, with a genuine 
taste for scholarship, who had made a romantic and dangerous 
marriage with Lady Arabella Stuart in his early Oxford days. 
His moderation and his great position gave him weight in council, 
and he rendered no inconsiderable service in the field. Others 
too, like Hopton, the General whom Fairfax honoured above 
any of his party, or Littleton, the distinguished lawyer who died 
at Oxford during the war, or Bankes, another loyal judge who 
lies buried in the Cathedral near him, had been Oxford under- 
graduates in years gone by. Others again had never “ sacri- 
ficed to the Muses ’—Colepeper, who was rather too fond of 
quarrelling with the soldiers, Jermyn, the Queen’s favourite, 
“ contemptible Harry, the left leg of a lord,” ? Jack Ashburnham, 
Endymion Porter, Grooms of the Bedchamber and confidential 
members of the Royal household, William Dugdale, the Herald, 
jotting down his little diary, and finding time to search for 
“ Antiquities ” in the “ Famous Bodleian Library,” ? and many 
another who shared the King’s misfortunes and played his 
part among the perils of the time. 
Outside Court circles Royalism was almost as active as 
inside. Giles Widdowes, once Prynne’s tutor at Oriel, showed 
as Rector of St. Martin’s, Carfax,a fighting spirit which no lay- 
man could disdain. He headed a dance on Whit-Sunday in 
protest against Sabbatarian ways, and the Puritans did not 
fail to notice that his church was the only one to suffer in the 
fire of October 1644. Before the early months of the war were 
over the University was in the hands of the King’s friends. 
The College Heads who had withdrawn before the forces of the 
Parliament were all back in Oxford in 1643, the year when John 
Aubrey, most lovable of gossips, went down prematurely from 
Trinity College. Pinke was released and found his way back 
to his Lodgings. Frewen at Magdalen was made a Bishop *— 
Prideaux and Duppa were Bishops already—but John Oliver 
who replaced him was equally faithful to the Royal interests. 
Baylie at St. John’s carried on the Laudian tradition. Samuel 
Fell, the Dean of Christ Church, was a protagonist in the Royal 
cause. Sheldon at All Souls and Langbaine at Queen’s * belonged 
to the same company. And if one or.two Heads were inactive 
1 Hopton, it seems, had been at Lincoln, Littleton at Christ Church 
and Bankes at Queen’s.

or indifferent, if Mansell, a devoted Royalist, was away from 
Jesus, if Hood at Lincoln was disposed to temporise,? if Hannibal 
Potter, Kettell’s successor at Trinity, longed chiefly for a quiet 
life, yet almost all the Colleges were ruled by the King’s adherents. 
At Merton indeed the Warden was still absent and unfriendly. 
But in 1645 Charles installed in Brent’s place one of his most 
distinguished supporters, who was then working at anatomy in 
Oxford, William Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation of 
the blood. 
It was no easy task, however, for the strongest College 
ruler to hold together in those days the community he ruled. 
Residents at Oxford were drawn into the turmoil. Newcomers 
from outside inevitably failed. College rents became increasingly 
difficult to gather. Repairs had to be postponed, new quad- 
rangles left unfinished. Not only were studies perpetually 
interrupted: the whole atmosphere of study disappeared. 
Christ Church was the head-quarters of a Court and an army. 
(Merton was pervaded by the Queen’s household. Oriel was the 
meeting-place of the little Cabinet or Junto which sat every 
Friday to discuss the King’s affairs. Nicholas, the Secretary 
lof State, had his lodgings at Pembroke, which contained at one 
ime over a hundred ill-assorted guests, including twenty-three 
women and five children.? The Chancellor of the Exchequer 
lhad rooms at All Souls. Colepeper was quartered at the Woods’ 
ouse in Merton Street. The Attorney-General’s wife had 
wo babies born at Wadham. Great ladies enjoyed and abused 
he hospitality of the Colleges, appropriated their chambers, 
ssembled on their lawns, and listened perhaps with equal 
omposure to Fuller’s sermons, to Dr. Kettell’s scoldings, to 
avenant’s or Suckling’s songs. Jesus gave up its best rooms 
o the King’s followers and servants. Brasenose, reduced to 
less than a dozen students, entertained lords and ladies, pastry- 
en and grooms. Balliol seems to have been treated little 
etter than a tavern. St. John’s was glad to find a refuge at 
ambridge for its Merchant Taylors’ Scholars. All Souls, 
horn of its accustomed revenues, tried to satisfy its Fellows 
ith one meal a day. In the Christ Church meadows and 
he groves of Trinity Cavaliers found opportunities of making 
ove. Roysterers found opportunities for roystering. Swords 
ere drawn and duels fought. Smoking became more popular

366 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
than ever: the white clay beds at Shotover were used for pipes. — 
The temptations of the tap-room too often accompanied the 
career of arms. Young scholars, keeping company with soldiers 
in guard-rooms, learned to drink and game away their time. 
The songs of the Holly-bush 1 near Rewley acquired a lively | 
notoriety. But efforts were made by sober spirits to turn the | 
hours of garrison duty to account. Some, says Wood, even at 
the Holly-bush would form parties to read to the othérs. Some 
organised discourses and formal disputations, from which drunk- 
ards were turned out. In by-ways still the genius of the place 
persisted, and in the libraries a few indomitable students worked. 
Archbishop Ussher, deaf to all distractions, laboured at his 
edition of Ignatius, Polycarp and Barnabas, and Convocation 
found time to vote that his “‘ Effigies ” should be cut on a brass 
plate and prefixed to the edition printing at the Press. 
Another Archbishop, the pride of many Oxford churchmen, 
had long been awaiting his trial in the Tower, restlessly dreaming 
that the Church was ruined and that the walls and roof of his 
old College were falling down. St. John’s still stood, but the 
Bill for abolishing Episcopacy passed through Parliament. 
“God be merciful,” wrote Laud, “to the sinking Church.” 
Prynne was busily collecting evidence against him, filling tomes 
with charges difficult to prove, and at last in March 1644 his 
trial before the House of Lords began. The greatest Oxonian 
in the House of Commons had by that time passed away. But 
Pym’s followers were in no mood to show more mercy to Laud 
than they had shown to Strafford. The handful of Peers who 
took part in the trial showed little care for justice. But they 
hesitated to send the Archbishop to the scaffold on the evidence 
produced. Witnesses from Oxford were forthcoming—some, the 
prisoner thought, who might have been expected to abstain.? 
Sir Nathaniel Brent was conspicuous among them, “ knuckle- 
deep,” said Royalist pamphleteers, in the Archbishop’s blood.*® 
Many of the charges seemed trivial enough. There may have 
been some ground for the plea that Laud, in his wish to be 
“an universal law-giver,” had attempted to alter the laws of 
religion. But to condemn him for revising the University 
Statutes was absurd. There may have been truth in the accusa-

THE GREAT REBELLION 367 
tion that at one time in Oxford he had been reputed “a Papist 
in heart.” But the academic generation which accused him 
had almost disappeared. The superstitious practices complained 
of, the statue over St. Mary’s porch, of which Laud had known 
nothing till it was set up, the crucifix im Lincoln Chapel, which 
he had not placed there, the bowing towards the altar, which 
had rankled so deeply with some Fellows of Merton, the use 
of copes and Latin prayers, were hardly sufficient to support 
a charge of treason. It was stronger ground that the Arch- 
bishop had “laboured to subvert the rights of Parliament.” 
That was the only excuse, and even that was no justification, 
for the attainder which in the end swept all pretence of legality 
aside. On the roth January 1645 Laud died, as Strafford had 
died before him, leaving an indignant sense of tyranny behind. 
On the scaffold he prayed with a touch of his old fierce spirit 
for “‘ grace of repentance to all bloodthirsty people.” He bade 
the world remember that he had always lived in the Protestant 
religion. ‘‘ And in that,” he said with proud composure, “I 
come now to die.” Men have not ceased to differ, and to differ 
widely, as to the interpretations which the Protestantism of 
the English Church permits. But how many parish churches 
could be found in England to repudiate all Laud’s views of 
ritual and of Churchmanship to-day ? 
Before Laud’s fate was decided fresh negotiations had been 
opened at Oxford. Charles showed unusual graciousness in 
face of stiff demands. But in private he did not hesitate to 
describe his opponents as arrant rebels, whose end must be 
damnation, infamy and ruin. The negotiations came to nothing, 
but both at Oxford and at Westminster there were strong friends 
of peace. In February 1645 the clergy at Oxford were consulted, 
and they put forward a scheme of toleration which did honour 
to their hearts and heads. Episcopacy was to be maintained, 
but the Bishops’ powers of coercion to be limited. And penal 
laws were to be suspended against Presbyterians and Indepen- 
dents alike.1 Years of bitterness might have been avoided had 
any scheme so liberal prevailed. In the meantime the New 
Model Army was organised, while Digby entreated Goring 
“to beware of debauches,”’ and Hyde complained of the strange 
kind of Generals who allowed themselves to sulk with the enemy 
at their gates. “ For God’s sake, let us not fall into ill humours 
which may cost us dear.” In April Cromwell, the “ darling 
of the sectaries,” was raiding in the neighbourhood of Oxford. 
Colonel Windebank surrendered Bletchingdon House, and was   1 The proposal is printed from the Clarendon MS. in the Eng. Hist.

  368 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
tried and shot at Oxford Castle.1 A month later Fairfax was 
threatening a siege * and provisions were running short. Charles, 
moving through the Midlands, sent men and cattle into Oxford ; 
“the cattle,” says a candid critic, ‘‘ he might have spared better 
than the men.”* Naseby followed, but still Charles hoped on. 
Montrose in the far North was winning astonishing victories— 
victories ‘“‘ rather like dreams than truths.’’ Before the end of 
August Charles was back in Oxford, but he left it two days 
later for the West. In September Rupert surrendered Bristol. 
Perhaps he knew the cause was lost. But Charles had no pity 
for ‘‘so mean an action.” His harsh treatment of the Prince 
and Rupert’s recriminations against Digby made bitter the 
ensuing weeks. Glemham, a stout old Cavalier who had held 
Carlisle stubbornly against the Scots, replaced Rupert’s friend 
Legge as Governor of Oxford. But two days after the surrender 
of Bristol Montrose went down at Philiphaugh. Even in the 
University City all illusions had now disappeared, as Charles 
bitterly realised when he returned there in November. Glem- 
ham advised him to set the Independents to fight the Presby- 
terians, and this advice, chiming in with his own inclinations, 
may have influenced the vain intrigues in which the winter 
passed. While Charles ordered special prayers in Oxford College 
Chapels, and his Parliament required all Colleges and Halls 
and houses to hang out lights from dusk “till the Tap-too be 
beaten,’’4 Fairfax steadily reduced the West. On the 4th Febru- 
ary 1646 the King visited his Parliament in the Schools.’ On 
the 13th April he committed to Sheldon a written vow to restore 
all Church lands held by the Crown, if he ever recovered his 
“just kingly rights.” On the 26th Charles took leave of his 
Council. At three in the morning of the 27th, attended only 
by Jack Ashburnham and his devoted Chaplain Dr. Hudson, 
once a poor boy and Taberdar of Queen’s, he bade good-bye for 
ever to the spires of Oxford and stole away to the Scottish 
camp. He was disguised as Ashburnham’s servant, his hair 
and beard cut close. ‘‘ Farewell, Harry,” called the Governor 
after him, as he clanged the gates behind. 
Within a few days of the King’s departure Fairfax arrived

and began to draw his lines about the City. All that remained 
of the Royalist strength lay there. The siege, this time at any 
rate, would have been a reality with no prospect of relief. 
Glemham had a considerable force and a strong position. He 
and his men made vigorous preparations for defence. But 
the heart had gone out of the Royalist courtiers. The Privy 
Council had the King’s leave to negotiate, and little could be 
gained by defending the place. On the 11th May Fairfax sum- 
moned the garrison to surrender, and expressed his wish to offer 
honourable terms. ‘‘I verie much desire the preservation of 
that place (so famous for Learning) from ruine, which inevitably 
is like to fall upon it except you concurr.” The Parliamen- 
tarians believed that there were six months’ provisions in Oxford, 
and that the place could be neither starved nor stormed. A 
hundred thousand men “ could hardly by violence have reduced 
it.” 2 Yet, in spite of stout opposition from the soldiers, the 
Governor by direction of the Council consented to treat. Com- 
missioners were appointed on both sides, Dr. Zouch and Robert 
Mead representing the University’s interests. Ireton, Lambert 
and Desborough were among those named by Fairfax. Ireton 
found time to marry Bridget Cromwell, at Holton close by, 
while the negotiations went on. Sallies and cannonades, in one 
of which Rupert was wounded, failed to interrupt the treaty, 
and Fairfax showed the same generous spirit to the end. The 
University’s charters and rights were guaranteed. The Colleges 
were promised all their privileges and possessions, the preserva- 
tion of their buildings, and six months’ emoluments for any 
of their members whom Parliament might remove. On the 
24th June the garrison marched out with colours flying, through 
the lines of the Parliament from St. Clement’s to Shotover Hill. 
Rupert and Maurice with a great company of lords and gentle- 
men had already left. Hundreds of passes were granted ® 
when Fairfax took possession of the town. Oxford had sur- 
rendered to a noble-minded enemy. But the University stood

  370 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
bare, its youth and treasure spent, its courts forsaken, face to 
face with the authority whose power it had defied. 
Nothing perhaps reveals more clearly the temper of the 
English Revolution,1 thé instinctive moderation which prevailed 
in the end over violence and excess, than the history of the 
University of Oxford between the surrender to Fairfax and 
the return of Charles II. The first step taken by the new 
authority, in July 1646, was to appoint a Committee for regu- 
lating the University, and to forbid College elections and the 
grant of fresh leases till the pleasure of Parliament was known. 
The next, in September, was to send down six preachers, Presby- 
terian divines, to prepare the way for the new order, so far as 
pulpit oratory or exposition could. Henry Wilkinson of Mag- 
dalen Hall* was one of them: Francis Cheynell of Merton 
was another. Henry Wilkinson, in Wood’s opinion, was the 
“exact cut of a precisian,” and Cheynell had “the fiery face of 
a fury.” But Wood had a lively eye for failings which he did 
not share. The most distinguished of the six was Edward 
Reynolds, another Merton man, whose singular ecclesiastical 
career is characteristic of the times. Originally a friend and 
supporter of Prideaux, Reynolds had joined the Westminster 
assembly of divines, had taken the Covenant with some mis- 
givings, and had ranged himself upon the Presbyterian side. 
But he was no lover of extreme courses. Gentle and eloquent, 
scrupulous, large-minded, he laboured to reconcile the theo- 
logians of his day. And whether preferred or deprived—he 
was twice made Dean of Christ Church, once Warden of Merton 
and later Bishop of Norwich—he kept the respect of moderate 
men in all parties alike. The visit of these preachers made a 
stir in Oxford. The Royalists affected to laugh at their ‘‘ wry 
mouths, squint eyes, and scru’d faces,” at their ‘“ squeaking 
voices and puling tones.” But if their methods seemed theatrical, 
their earnestness had its effect. The weekly conferences which 
they established every Thursday at a house beside the Saracen’s 
Head, irreverently termed the Scruple Shop, drew doubters 
and serious-minded men of all opinions, and evidently met 
with some success. The Independents, always ready to challenge 
the Presbyterians, and no doubt egged on by the undergraduates, 
seized the opportunity to assert their views as well. Hugh 
Peters had already startled churchmen at St. Mary’s. Army

under Charles II, and the final triumph of 1688.

Christ Church. Seven preachers were appointed, but one of them appar- 
ently, Edward Corbet, did not come, at any rate at first.

  THE GREAT REBELLION 371 
preachers, narrower and less eminent than he, made themselves 
heard in the pulpits, in the Schools, upon the Christ Church 
stairs. They held meetings in a house opposite Merton Chapel. 
They provoked all opponents to debate. Colonel John Hewson, 
once a shoe-maker, now a power in the Army, proved himself 
a stubborn controversialist.1 William Erbery, formerly a Brase- 
nose undergraduate and afterwards a rebel against Laud, under- 
took to prove in argument with Cheynell that ministers had 
no more authority to preach than private Christians, and Oxford 
opinion thought he had the best of the debate. The Parlia- 
mentary authorities discouraged these spectacular contests. 
But the rift between the Army and the Parliament was growing 
wider every day. 
On the departure of the soldiers, said a Puritan news-sheet, 
“ one Colledge doth seeme to smile unto another.” * But there 
were not wanting signs of embarrassment while the University 
was waiting for the conquerors’ decrees. On August 4 Convo- 
cation appointed Langbaine and Brooks, the Principal of Saint 
Mary Hall, to go to London on their behalf, and on the 23rd 
they addressed letters of appeal to Fairfax and to Selden.’ 
In October a censorship of the University press practically 
stopped its publications. Samuel Fell wrote pitifully to the 
delegates in London about the “‘ miserable condition ” of Oxford. 
College tenants were taking “‘ strange advantages ’’—but surely 
they would not be ‘‘so unnatural as to starve us.” The turn- 
pike roads were ‘‘ ruinated ’’: but the University had no money 
“for this or anything else.” * In December 1646 certain Fellows 
and Scholars of Colleges, who had been forced to leave Oxford 
during the war, appealed to Parliament for compensation.’ 
At last on the 1st May 1647 the Ordinance for the Visitation 
of the University appeared. Twenty-four Visitors, of whom 
five formed a quorum, were to inquire into all offences and 
disorders, and in particular to ascertain what members of the 
University had failed to take the Covenant and the Negative 
Oath, had opposed the Parliamentary ordinances or had fought 
against the Parliamentary forces.* Sir Nathaniel Brent, named 
1 Hewson became one of the King’s judges and a member of Cromwell’s 
House of Lords. (See Wood’s Fasti, ed. Bliss, II, 134).

Mr. John, and Mr. Henry Wilkinson. The Negative Oath was an oath 
not to help the King or to act under his direction to the prejudice of 
Parliament.

  372 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
at the head of the Commission, and Edward Reynolds were 
two of its most important members. Cheynell represented the 
more vehement partisans. Prynne, remorseless still in pam- 
phleteering—we have a picture of him studying and writing, 
with his long quilt cap drawn over his eyes, sustained by a roll 
and a pot of ale brought him every three hours to “‘ refocillate ” 
his spirits—Prynne was as ready as anyone for conflict, but for 
his old University he kept a soft spot in his heart. Christopher 
Rogers and Dr. John Wilkinson represented the Puritan Halls. 
To Wood’s jaundiced eye Rogers pleased only women and children, 
while Dr. Wilkinson, with more beard than learning, had for 
forty years been the sport of boys. There was a majority of 
laymen on the Commission and a sufficiency of lawyers. But 
many of the lay members attended comparatively little, and the 
fate of the University was left largely in the hands of the divines. 
A Standing Committee of twenty-six Peers and fifty-two mem- 
bers of the House of Commons was nominated, to receive reports 
from the Visitors and to hear appeals. Pembroke, now restored 
to his dignity as Chancellor, but with no more dignity of character 
to sustain it, Manchester, who had ceased to lead armies for the 
Parliament but was still responsible for regulating the University 
of Cambridge, and Lord Saye and Sele were among the Peers. 
Selden and Whitelocke, Holles and Lenthall were conspicuous 
among the members of the Commons. Francis Rous, politician, 
theologian, mystic, once an undergraduate of Broadgates and 
more recently Provost of Eton, acted often as Chairman of the 
Committee, and the existence of this important Court in London, 
often too ready to listen to appeals, did not make matters easier 
for their agents at Oxford. 
The Visitors cited the Proctors and Heads of Houses to appear 
before them in the House of Convocation between nine and 
eleven on the 4th June. The blazing out of the quarrel between 
the Army and the Parliament, and the forcible seizure by the 
Oxford garrison of a large sum of money sent down to pay 
them off, caused some of the Visitors to postpone their arrival 
and gave the opposition time to mature their plans. Meetings 
of Heads were held at All Souls and Christ Church, to arrange 
a method of passive resistance. There was “ most spirituall 
wickednesse,” said a Puritan pamphlet, at All Souls. At a 
Convocation held on the 1st June, over which Samuel Fell, the 
Vice-Chancellor, presided, a Delegacy was appointed to answer 
on the University’s behalf. The Delegates were all of one

complexion, College Heads like Fell and Baylie, Langbaine, 
Pinke and Sheldon, resolute churchmen like Hammond, Morley, 
Sanderson, strong spirits like Obadiah Walker of University, 
Tozer of Exeter and Webberley of Lincoln. A skilful statement 
of the ‘‘ just Scruples”’ felt by the University in regard to the 
Covenant, the Negative Oath and the Ordinances for discipline 
and worship was drawn up by Sanderson with Dr. Zouch’s help.t 
The University affirmed its belief in the true Protestant religion 
expressed in the doctrine of the Church of England, and pleaded 
that Episcopacy, if not Jure Divino and commanded by the 
Word of God, was yet of Apostolical institution. The state- 
ment was framed with judicious moderation, but it may not 
have been quite so successful in clearing away “all suspicion 
of obstinacy ”’ as its authors hoped. The Puritans at Oxford 
at once protested against the confederacy of Dr. Fell and his 
Delegates to maintain the old Prelacy and Liturgy and to 
oppose all reforms. On the 3rd June the great gates of Merton 
were set open for the Visitors, but the dignitaries expected 
did not come. On the 4th, however, those on the spot # decided 
to open the proceedings with a preliminary sermon at St. Mary’s 
Church. But the sermon lasted too long. The Vice-Chancellor, 
Proctors and Doctors, who had gathered at the Convocation 
House in formal obedience to the summons, were watching 
the clock eagerly and comparing it with the sun. On the stroke 
of eleven, as the Visitors had not arrived, the Vice-Chancellor 
dismissed his colleagues, and they had the pleasure of meeting 
the Visitors in the Proscholium as they passed out. A bold 
Bedel even demanded room for the Vice-Chancellor, and a 
“great Humme” emphasised the point. But the University’s 
respect for the letter of the citation was too serious to allow its 
representatives to return.? 
There for a time matters rested. The opposition were 
delighted. The Visitors were annoyed—all the more when 
Sheldon and Hammond left Oxford by permission of the Army 
to wait upon the King, a permission which the Parliament 
had refused. In August and September the powers of the 
Visitors were enlarged. A Commission was issued in the King’s 
name. They were authorised in wide terms to regulate and 
reform the University and to pass sentence upon any of its

rulers.1 The Committee invited them to act with vigour, and 
at the end of September they went to work again. A fresh 
sermon reopened the proceedings, but Henry Wilkinson’s pulpit 
eloquence, with its pointed personal allusions, was more than 
some of his congregation could bear. The Visitors, sitting at 
Merton, ordered all Registers and Statute-Books to be brought 
before them, and appointed one or two representatives to report 
to them in regard to each College and Hall.? Dr. Fell was re- 
peatedly summoned. The University Delegates asked leave 
with great humility to see the Visitors’ commission and to 
know by what authority they proposed to act. They had their 
oaths to keep their Statutes, apart from their duty to the King, 
and they would rather be destroyed than perjured. On the 
6th October most of the Heads of Houses put in an appearance, 
not to bring their books, as required, but to repeat their questions 
as to the Visitors’ powers. Dean Fell, however, declined to 
appear at all before such inconsiderable persons. Was a Dean 
and a Vice-Chancellor to stand bare-headed before nobodies 
sitting in elbow chairs? The Registrar could not produce the 
Register of Convocation. The Bedels had no control over their 
staves. The University Clerk could not lay hands upon the 
keys. The Proctors appeared, but only to announce that the 
University could not acknowledge any Visitation unless ordered 
by the King. Wightwicke, the new Master of Pembroke— 
Clayton had just died—offered the same answer. The Visitors 
were at last driven to assert themselves. Fell was removed 
from the Vice-Chancellorship—Wightwicke was deposed, and 
Langley, one of the six preachers, appointed in his place. The 
Convocation records were seized in the Registrar’s room. The 
1 See the details given by Wood (Amn. II, 513 sq.). A power to 
commit for contempt was apparently among them, though the Royalists 
doubted it (Clar. State Papers 30, 2636). See also Wood F. 35 (ff. 28 and 
31-45). 2 Men of standing served in this capacity—Conant at Exeter, Langley 
at Pembroke, Bradshaw at Balliol. One, two or three were appointed 
from most Colleges and Halls, and were regarded by their political oppo- 
nents as spies. But it seems that at University, Oriel, All Souls and 
Brasenose the Visitors found no delegates whom they could trust to act 
for them (Richards and Shadwell, Provosts of Oriel, App. V). 
* On the protests and proceedings of these weeks see Clar. St. Pap. 30 
(2636) and Wood F. 35 (ff. 71 sq.). Wood has gathered many details in 
MS. Wood F. 35, some of which he works into his history. But the most 
important authority (printed in 1881 by Prof. Montagu Burrows in his 
Register of Visitors) is the MS. Register of the proceedings of Visitors from 
30 Sept. 1647 to 8 April 1658, called E. Museo (or Musaeo) 77, because it 
was at one time kept in the Librarian’s study or musaeum at the Bodleian. 
It may have been given to the Bodleian by the executors of Ralph Austen, 
who succeeded Newhouse as Registrar or Secretary to the Commission, 
and whose name is inside the cover. Wood used it freely.
-P-A-G-E-431
  THE GREAT REBELLION 375 
beginning of the October term was postponed by order, but the 
Vice-Chancellor promptly called a Congregation and began it, 
while the Heads of Houses protested that their books and 
Statutes could only be examined by the lawful Visitors whom 
every College possessed. Brent and Henry Wilkinson went 
to Westminster to report to the Committee. Fell was summoned 
to London: Barlow wrote to Sheldon, in October 1647,1 ‘‘ we 
are now left dxépador, our Vice-Chancellor ravished from us.” 
Dr. Potter of Trinity agreed, most unwillingly, to act in Fell’s 
stead. At Christ Church Hammond, as Sub-Dean, took charge 
of the College, treating the scholars like “‘ his private family, 
he scarce leaving a single person without some mark or other 
of both his charity and care.’”’ The Heads of several Colleges 
called before the Visitors early in November, referred to the 
answers already given by the University, and were summoned 
to appear in London. The Delegates approved their action. 
It is to be feared that the suspicion of obstinacy was by this 
time confirmed. 
At Westminster during the autumn and winter the same 
struggle was continued and the same comedy played, not with- 
out patience on the part of the Parliament or dexterity on the 
part of their opponents. Lord Pembroke indeed fell foul of 
Dr. Fell with abuse “‘ so outragious that his own grave associates 
smiled.”’ 2. But Selden, Whitelocke, Prynne and others exerted 
themselves to serve the University. The Independents were 
unwilling to press men against their consciences, especially if 
the pressure came from the Presbyterian side. Selden warned 
them that, if they proceeded too hastily, they would ‘“ destroy 
rather than reforme one of ye most famous and learned com- 
panyes of men that ever was visible in ye Christian world.” 
The Oxford leaders pleaded for time—Parliament, Army and 
King were manceuvring against each other. They asked for 
Counsel, and largely by Selden’s influence obtained them. A 
large minority in the Committee stood by them, but they were 
finally adjudged guilty of contempt. Dr. Fell was expelled from 
his office and his Deanery, though Selden’s advocacy saved 
him from a fine. The two Proctors were dismissed; Selden 
is said to have saved one of them from banishment. Dr. Baylie 
of St. John’s was removed from his Headship. So were Rad- 
cliffe of Brasenose, Potter of Trinity, and Oliver of Magdalen. 
Dr. Gardiner and Dr. Iles were deprived of Christ Church 
Canonries—the Committee “‘ fiercely voting.” The one was

declared to be an Arminian, the other ‘a drunken sot.” Dr. 
Morley also lost his Canonry, though Selden and Whitelocke 
interceded for him. Reynolds was made Vice-Chancellor and 
Dean in place of Fell. Two new Proctors were appointed. 
Pembroke was ordered to go and take possession of his place 
as Chancellor. Christopher Rogers, Henry Wilkinson and 
Henry Langley were nominated to Canonries at Christ Church. 
A messenger was sent to Oxford to apprehend some of the 
displaced dignitaries, but found that they “‘ were stept aside.” 
The Committee’s directions remained for the present unfulfilled. 
In March 1648 the Visitors at Oxford resumed their activities. 
Dr. Pitt of Wadham and Tozer the Sub-Rector of Exeter ! were 
among those summoned to Merton. Tozer especially was 
sharply questioned and found guilty of contempt. Sheldon at 
All Souls and Hammond at Christ Church evaded the questions 
put, and were condemned to deprivation. Other Canons of 
Christ Church and Webberley, Sub-Rector of Lincoln, suffered 
the same fate. Webberley continued defiant and was sent to 
Bridewell for a time. Steps were taken to secure possession of 
the Deanery, but Mrs. Fell steadily refused to leave. Affronts 
offered to soldiers of the garrison caused more troops to be 
sent down for the Visitors’ support. The Provost of Oriel 
declined submission. The Lodgings at Corpus had to be broken 
into in search of the Vice-Chancellor’s insignia and books. 
Offenders ignored the sentences published and were not to be 
found when summoned. The resources of passive resistance 
are never easy to exhaust. 
On the rrth April Pembroke, the Chancellor, arrived in person 
—‘‘ the long-legged peece of impertinency,” mocked the Royalists, 
in squibs which lacked nothing in impertinence themselves. 
“‘T love the Bible, though I seldom use it,’ was supposed to 
be his acknowledgment of a presentation copy. A great company 
went out to Abingdon to meet him, and conducted him to Merton 
College. On the following morning he went to the Deanery 
and requested Mrs. Fell to leave. Troops were brought up 
to enforce the invitation. But they had to carry the intrepid 
lady out, “and her children after her upon boords, as if they 
were going like so many Pyes to the Oven.” ® The names of

  THE GREAT REBELLION 377 
Buttery-book. In the afternoon the Chancellor presided at a 
meeting of Convocation, from which most of the senior Masters 
held conspicuously aloof.1 The proceedings, the Royalists 
alleged, “that his Lordship might understand,” were held “ in 
their Mother Tongue.” Dr. Reynolds took the oath as Vice- 
Chancellor, and made a conciliatory speech, which even opponents 
approved. Degrees were conferred. New Proctors and Bedels 
were named. Next day, the 13th, was a day of evictions. 
Pembroke went first with a guard to Magdalen and installed 
John Wilkinson as President in Oliver’s place. Oliver’s servant, 
who locked the door of the Lodgings against them, was sent 
off to prison with a file of musketeers. From Magdalen they 
passed on to All Souls. Sheldon, who was walking in his garden, 
received them with composure, but refused to surrender his 
keys. His name was dashed out and Dr. Palmer’s inserted. 
His Lodgings also were broken into and hard words were used. 
Sheldon himself was marched off under guard to James Chester- 
man’s house against the Cross Inn, and a remarkable demon- 
stration of sympathy followed him through the streets. ‘I 
have, for your sake, clapped Sheldon in prison,” the Royalist 
satirist made the Chancellor say to his confederates. ‘‘ Was 
it not high time? Damme, he hath more brains than all we 
together.” 
From All Souls the Chancellor’s party went on to Wadham 
and to Trinity, with a noisy rabble following behind. There 
were townsmen, no doubt, who found a certain satisfaction 
in seeing the great dignitaries of the University brought low. 
John Wilkins and Robert Harris, one of the six preachers, were 
established in the places of Dr. Pitt and Hannibal Potter. Pitt 
and Potter were both, it seems, away. The turn of St. John’s 
came next. There Dr. Baylie met them in the quadrangle, 
and rather disarmed Pembroke by playing him a compliment. 
But that did not deter the Visitors from installing Cheynell 
in the President’s seat. Baylie’s wife and family were in the 
College, and they were allowed a month to move out.? The 
Royalists were not without excuse in thinking the new President’s 
partisanship tinged with madness. But they put it more bluntly : 
“Cheynell is Bedlam seven stories high.” From St. John’s 
the unwearied Chancellor passed to Brasenose—it was now 
growing late—and declared Greenwood Principal in Radcliffe’s 
place. Radcliffe was ill, but he held on to his rooms over the 
1 Dr. Zouch incurred some suspicion by attending. But Rouse, 
Bodley’s Librarian, was also there. For the proceedings in Convocation 
see Reg. T, 1647-59 (p. 11).

on the 2nd June (Amn. II, 589).

gateway, and kept the key of the College treasury till his death. 
The seven Commissioners who signed the order at Brasenose 
included Pembroke, Cheynell, Prynne and Brent.! After that 
the procession returned in triumph to Merton. With little 
violence, but perhaps at the cost of some little dignity, the 
Visitors of the Parliament had enforced their will. 
It must be admitted that the victorious party had shown 
some patience hitherto. They had waited for nearly two years 
since the surrender of Oxford without resorting to a display 
of force. The Committee of Lords and Commoners sanctioned 
the Chancellor’s proceedings, and empowered the Visitors to 
summon and suspend, if need be, all recalcitrant members of 
Colleges and Halls. The Visitors continued their sittings in 
Oxford, doing their best to secure submissions, summoning 
College Bursars and officials before them, trying to temper 
severity with mercy, and incidentally putting down “ super- 
stitious ’’ customs, like the use of the old Prayer-Book in College 
Chapels, the appearance of the Bell-man at University funerals, 
or May-games and Morris dances in the town. Reynolds and 
Rogers, Cheynell and the Wilkinsons seem to have taken the 
most prominent part. Early in May 1648 various members of 
the Colleges began to appear before them, and to say whether 
they would submit to the authority of Parliament or not.® 
The lists of those summoned were probably made as complete as 
circumstances allowed, and included Fellows and Scholars, Com- 
moners and servants. The answers given showed great variety 
of opinion and a good deal of dialectical resource. Some were 
openly defiant. Some were ingeniously ambiguous. Some would 
have been ready to make terms had their oaths and obligations 
permitted. Some, but a minority only, were ready to submit. 
Nicholas Pitt of Queen’s College spoke for the first class without 
hesitation. 
“To the pretended Visitors of this Universitie my Answere is 
negative, that I will not, neither can without abusinge the Kinge, 
and therein my owne conscience, submitt to you as Visitors, whom 
his Majestie doth professe his enemies: Thus stands the conscience 
of Nicholas Pitt.” 
  
1 The other three were Robert Harris, William Cobbe and Joshua 
Cross (or Crosse) one of the new Proctors (Wood, Ann. II, 572). Wood’s 
narrative of these proceedings, though biassed, is full of interesting detail 
and is clearer than some of the contemporary accounts. 
2 It was not till Christmas that the Latin prayers at Christ Church 
were suppressed (Burrows, Register, lxxxiii). I give references of course to 
the printed edition of this Register. 
2 Magdalen was summoned on May 2nd, Christ Church next day. 
All Souls, Trinity, Pembroke, Magdalen Hall and New Inn Hall were also 
among the first. St. John’s, New College, Exeter and others followed 
immediately. Within three weeks they had practically all appeared.
-P-A-G-E-435
  THE GREAT REBELLION 379 
But Nathaniell Noyse of the same Society submitted willingly 
and with great joy. He added that his views had exposed him 
to “noe small malignity and opposition of those of the Colledge.” 
Thomas Throkmorton of Balliol was as emphatic as Nicholas 
Pitt: ‘‘I will not be soe traiterous to my Kinge as to acknow- 
ledge the pretended right and authority of his enemies.” John 
Hughes of Jesus, whose conscience was not large enough “to 
entertaine everie cruditie of Doctrine,” would not submit, were 
it to save his life. But indirect answers were more common 
than open defiance, and many a graduate and undergraduate 
must have revelled in the opportunities they gave. Some 
required time to think the matter over. The question was so 
high and difficult that they dared not answer it without delay. 
Mr. Phyneas Jackson of Trinity could not persuade his con- 
science to give any positive reply. New College men recalled 
their Statutes, and dwelt like many others on the risks of perjury 
incurred. A reference to the answer given by the University 
was very popular. But puzzled bewilderment was a still com- 
moner plea. Allestree of Christ Church could not make out 
the meaning of the question. James Fayre of Queen’s humbly 
conceived it to be “very abstruse, ambiguous and difficult.” 
Another was not sure whether the authority of Parliament 
meant the authority of the King. Another had, for his part, 
“never studied State Policie.’” A Demy of Magdalen found it 
quite beyond his capacity. A Probationer felt it would be 
presumptuous for him to answer extempore when “‘ very learned 
and juditiouse men” had asked for time. One young gentle- 
man, being still “in the Government of a Tutor,’ could not 
be expected to see his way. A second pleaded ‘‘ weake appre- 
hention,”’ a third that he was only a chorister and a ‘‘ Schooleboy 
14 yeare old.” Lyonell Pine of Wadham perhaps touched the 
highest point of vagueness and prolixity : 
“‘T hope noe man, since hee cannot finde in my life past whence 
to censure me, greedy to finde faults that hee will rake my owne 
brest to confesse that which noe man accuse me of, neither doe I 
myselfe yet know, viz: what I possibly shall doe hereafter this when 
I shall be commaunded that which I yet never heard of.” 
The rights of the King and of the College Visitors and the 
obligations of College oaths were real stumbling-blocks to many. 
But sometimes more original arguments appeared. A Christ 
Church Commoner, living at great expense and daily expecting 
his friends to recall him, could not suppose that the Visitation 
had anything to do with him. A Student of the same College 
could answer no summons until he had been properly described. 
Henry Birkhead of All Souls submitted once in his ‘“‘ owne
-P-A-G-E-436
ee 
380 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
sence,” and a second time so far as he lawfully might. Thomas 
Fletcher of Magdalen was afraid of offending Parliament if 
he acknowledged the Visitors, ‘‘ because they are all, or most 
of them, Clergie men.” Political defeat had not dulled the 
University’s humour or dimmed its controversial powers. It 
is no wonder if the Committee in London found it necessary 
to resolve that professions of ignorance, saving clauses, and 
other forms of evasion were not to be reckoned as submissions 
at all. 
Of those who appeared in answer to the summons and gave 
their replies in the first weeks of May, a fair proportion ack- 
nowledged the Visitors’ authority. At Magdalen Hall and New | 
Inn Hall there was not a single refusal. At Pembroke there 
was only one out of twenty replies At Lincoln eighteen 
submitted out of twenty-six who answered. At Trinity half 
of the replies were favourable, at Merton more than half. At | 
Exeter eleven out of twenty-four complied without equivocation, 
at Queen’s nine out of forty-three. But in other cases refusals 
and evasions were more marked. Christ Church and Magdalen 
yielded at first few submissions, St. John’s only four out of 
thirty-six replies, Balliol three out of sixteen, Brasenose two out 
of eighteen. Oriel and All Souls each supplied ten answers with- 
out one submission, for the one offered at All Souls was after- 
wards withdrawn.2 New College, like All Souls, a close cor- 
poration, largely ruled by lawyers and accused of corrupt methods 
in electing its Fellows, was stubbornly Royalist: fifty-two 
answers yielded only three submissions and two of these came 
from servants. Nineteen replies from Jesus and twenty-five 
replies from Corpus showed only one submission each. On 
Merton, where Brent’s influence was again in the ascendant, 
and on Lincoln, where Hood presided if he could hardly be 
said to rule, the Visitors had from the first a certain hold. At 
Christ Church and Magdalen, as time went on, new appointments 
and good administration produced a considerable change, and 
the Royalist resistance was less vigorous than we might expect. 
Ralph Bathurst played a useful part at Trinity. Exeter and 
Wadham were largely influenced by their new Heads. Lang- 
baine and Barlow, though undoubted Royalists, made the 
1 Burrows (Reg. 40-1). But there was more Royalist feeling at 
Pembroke than this implies. 
8 These figures, based on the replies printed from the Register by Prof. 
Burrows, are taken from the first batches of answers, and are not of course 
complete. The figures in the case of each College, so far as we know 
them, have been given elsewhere. It seems that expulsions were most 
numerous at Magdalen, New College and Christ Church, and were very 
considerable at Corpus and St. John’s.

  THE GREAT REBELLION 381 
new system work at Queen’s.!_ Brasenose, St. John’s and Corpus 
acquiesced, however unwillingly, despite their loyalist traditions. 
It was chiefly at New College, with its Winchester connection, 
at All Souls, where Sheldon’s influence lingered, and at Jesus, 
where Welsh Royalists, inspired perhaps by their old Principal, 
re-fought whenever possible the battles of the past, that the 
elements of opposition seemed difficult to quiet or remove. 
With three exceptions every College in Oxford found itself 
shortly under a new Head,* and even among the new Heads 
there were further changes when the Engagement had to be 
subscribed. Most of the changes, like Dean Fell’s displacement 
by Reynolds or Harvey’s replacement by Brent, were due to 
political causes. But a few were occasioned by retirement or 
by death. Dr. Clayton of Pembroke had died in July 1647, 
and Dr. Pinke of New College a few months later. Pinke’s 
‘successor, Dr. Stringer, elected in defiance of the Visitors, was 
finally ejected in January 1649. Dr. Radcliffe died in June 
1648 at Brasenose, and the Royalist Fellows with a fine dis- 
regard of circumstances elected Yate, though Greenwood had 
already been installed. Dr. Lawrence of Balliol, a weak man, 
submitted, but retired shamefacedly in July 1648, and Bradshaw, 
an uncompromising Puritan, stepped into his shoes. Bradshaw 
appears to have found a grim pleasure in abolishing the prayers 
for King and Queen. Dr. Hakewill of Exeter died in April 
1649, and in a happy moment for the College John Conant, 
Reynolds’ son-in-law, was appointed in his stead. Before that 
Dr. Hoyle had been established at University, and Dr. Staunton 
at Corpus, though at Corpus the supporters of the old President, 
‘Dr. Newlyn, tore down the notice from the College gates. At 
Jesus Mansell had to give way, but he was allowed later to 
return and to live in the College. At Oriel Provost Saunders, 
hough recalcitrant, managed to remain in office: he apparently 
had friends in the London Committee. At Queen’s Langbaine, 
ho shared Saunders’ opinions, kept his place by influence or 
act. 
The Professors for the most part followed the Heads of 
olleges. In May 1648 all Professors and Lecturers, who had 
een ‘‘very carelesse and necgligent for these three termes 
ast past,” were summoned to return and take up their duties. 
ut changes were probably inevitable here. Robert Sanderson, 
hose suspension was delayed as long as possible, gave place 
o Dr. Hoyle from Dublin, and Hoyle’s inaugural lecture was

long friends and had both been Poor Boys at Queen’s. 
® At Oriel, Lincoln and Queen’s there was no change. The Heads of 
agdalen Hall, New Inn Hall and Alban Hall submitted.  
-P-A-G-E-438
  382. A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
largely devoted to the praise of Bishop Prideaux. Cheynell 
succeeded Lawrence as Lady Margaret Professor. It could 
hardly be expected that the victorious party would leave the 
teaching of theology in the hands of Royalist divines. Greaves 
and Turner, both ardent Royalists of Merton, and Savilian 
Professors of Astronomy and Geometry, were admirably replaced 
by two distinguished Cambridge men, Seth Ward and John 
Wallis. It is pleasant to remember that Greaves exerted him- 
self to secure the appointment of Ward as his successor.1 He 
himself had been so active in opposing Brent, and so suspiciously 
friendly with the Queen’s Confessor, as to be beyond the pale 
of forgiveness. Henry Wilkinson, junior, replaced Birkenhead 
as Professor of Moral Philosophy. Pococke, whose learning 
was beyond dispute, remained as Professor of Arabic and Hebrew, 
and one or two others remained with him.? Other Professors 
and Readers had to give way. Hammond was succeeded before 
long as Public Orator by Ralph Button, who bore a high repu- 
tation as a teacher. Most of the Christ Church Canonries fell 
to the winning side. Fellows and Scholars who would not submit 
paid the penalty for their opinions. College servants showed 
in many cases the same stubbornness or courage. College 
papers, registers, seals and even money mysteriously disappeared. 
Some refractory spirits also proved difficult to find. Some 
thought better of their opposition and withdrew it. Some 
condemned to expulsion escaped the sentences imposed. If 
there were examples of severity. and bitter feeling, there were 
also moderate and reconciling influences at work. Appeals to 
the Committee in London were not infrequent. The Com- 
mittee sometimes interposed and over-ruled the action of the 
Visitors with a freedom which added greatly to the difficulties 
of their task. 
It is not possible to say exactly how many members of 
Oxford foundations lost their places at the Parliamentary 
Visitors’ hands. It is probable that the estimate of four hundred 
often quoted is too high. It is doubtful whether the numbers 
finally expelled were larger than the numbers who submitted. 
The number of new appointments made gives little clue to the    
      
    
    
          
    
    
    1 See Walter Pope’s Life of Seth Ward (18-22), 
* E.g. the younger Clayton, Professor of Medicine, and Philips, Pro- 
fessor of Music, submitted. Others, like the Readers in Ancient History, 
Natural Philosophy and Greek, were replaced. Pococke lost his Canonry, 
and he only retained his Lecturerships owing to a widely signed petition| 
which had Selden’s support. 
’ This is Walker’s estimate (Sufferings of the Clergy, 1714, Pt. II, 
138-9). The total numbers ejected, when non-foundationers are added,|

imperfect. :

THE GREAT REBELLION 383 
number of expulsions, partly because it is in itself uncertain, 
and partly because many vacancies were filled up on death 
or resignation in the ordinary course. The changes recorded 
in the Visitors’ Register extend over several years, and the entries 
are sometimes inexact and careless. We have a note of two 
hundred and ninety-six appointments made in 1648, of a hundred 
and fourteen in 1649, and of eighty-seven others in the years 
which followed. Most of the earlier appointments probably 
were intended to fill places rendered vacant by expulsion. 
We have lists of new appointments well exceeding five hundred 
altogether, and including eighty-five at New College, and seventy- 
eight at Magdalen.1 But it would be rash to build too definite 
conclusions on the figures given. That large changes were 
made is not to be denied. The attitude of the Colleges rendered 
that inevitable. The University had been too closely associated 
with the King’s cause to escape. “A multitude of pretious 
young Men,” cries one Royalist pamphlet, were banished.* 
“Fuimus,” writes Langbaine to Selden, thanking him for his 
“extraordinary providence’? to the University. But even 
Langbaine admits that some Loyalists were ‘‘ ambitious of 
suffering’; and his letters turn ere long to lighter subjects, 
to the meaning of xwpatijgsa, to Selden’s ‘‘rare discovery of 
Succoth Benoth,” to problems connected with Abel’s and Cain’s 
wives. With the severity shown there mingled a good deal 
of magnanimity and patience, and a degree of tolerance which 
was remarkable considering the conquerors’ reputation for 
rigidity of view. The new men brought in sometimes deserved 
the criticisms of the Royalists. Their opinions, their origins, 
even their conduct, may have been objectionable. It is not 
in times of revolution only that pushing self-interest secures 
more than its due. And there was added bitterness in the 
reflection that so many of the intruders were Cambridge men. 
Wood speaks of poor curates and school-masters from the 
country, of rude and pragmatical persons careless of formalities, 
discipline and dress, insolent and factious in their bearing and 
1 And 43 at Corpus. All these figures should be received with caution. 
Prof. Burrows in his edition of the Visitors’ Register discusses the subject 
with fullness and candour. But his estimate on pp. Ixxxix—xc must 
be compared with his remarks on pp. 469-70 and 477, with the Tables 
(473 sq.) and the summary (571). I feel some doubt about the lists of 
new appointments in the Tables—6 at Queen’s, 40 at Christ Church, 38

irregular in their ideas. But Wood had always an honest 
prejudice for his own party, and some at any rate of the new- 
comers were fully equal in character and distinction to those 
whom they displaced. John Fell, who suffered and felt keenly, 
complained of the “‘illiterate rabble”? who made “an almost 
general riddance”’ of the loyal University. He declared that 
iv in the end very few legitimate members of the Colleges remained.t 
But a fairer and a truer view is attributed to another loyal 
Student of Christ Church, who kept his place by influence though 
he did not submit. Philip Henry, his celebrated son reports 
of him, thought, long after, that “milder Methods might have 
done better,”’ but that, considering the circumstances and the 
provocation “‘it could not be said the Terms were hard.” ? 
Through 1648 and 1649 the work of the Visitors continued. 
New cases were considered and new orders made. The course 
of politics outside Oxford, no doubt, had its influence on the 
proceedings. The Civil War broke out afresh, “a more pro- 
digious treason.” Dean Reynolds and the new Canons of Christ 
Church, hurrying up to London on alarming information that 
the lands of Cathedral Chapters were to be sold, found the 
House of Commons in possession of the Army chiefs. The 
conflict of parties reacted on the authority of the Commission. 
In Oxford itself there were incidents and plots. Cavalier scholars 
made fools of ‘the poor Saints”’ in disputations: so at least 
the Cavaliers alleged. Cheynell, the new President of St. John’s, 
gave a great dinner on St. John Baptist’s day, keeping the 
gaudy but omitting the sacrament and sermon. His behaviour 
was considered “ damn’d and devilish by the Royal party.” 
On May 2oth, the Prince’s birthday, young gentlemen at New 
College and Trinity made bonfires. On November 5th the 
zealous Protestants retorted with bonfires in their turn? In 
July 1648 a Royalist plot to seize the Visitors and the garrison 
was discovered, in which one of the Merton Chaplains was said 
to be concerned. ‘‘Crackbrain Dr. Cheynell one of the Visitors 
traversed the streets in slippers crying out of plots against their 
lives in the night.” But only a few conspirators of humble 
rank won notoriety. William Collier, the Pembroke butler, 
made his escape and became a hero. Edward Adams, a barber 
condemned to be hanged on the sign-post of the Catharine 
Wheel Inn, was saved at the last moment by Brent’s intervention, 
on the earnest supplication of the Merton cook. More distin-

guished prisoners like Sheldon and Hammond proved an em- 
barrassment. The Governor of Wallingford Castle refused to 
take charge of them, except as friends.1 Tozer was released. 
In Beam Hall, then Dr. Willis’ house, in Merton Street ? John 
Fell and his two friends, Dolben and Allestree, carried on Church 
of England services, probably not without connivance, till 
Charles II returned. The new Warden of New College is said 
to have made havoc of the College timber. A treasure of gold 
coins, old spur-royals, was discovered at Magdalen and divided 
by the Fellows. Two sealed bags of money, mysteriously found 
at Trinity College, were said to be claimed by President Harris 
“Verbo Sacerdotis”’ as portions for his daughters. But the 
Royalists, who may have invented the story, were positive that 
the store belonged to the College.’ 
On Thursday the 17th May 1649 Thomas Lord Fairfax and 
Oliver Cromwell arrived on a State visit to the University. 
They stayed at All Souls. Jerome Zanchy, an intruded Fellow 
of that House, now Sub-Warden and Proctor but lately a Colonel 
in the Parliament’s Army, acted as their host.t They were 
waited on by the Heads of Houses, and welcomed to Oxford 
in a speech, which, though bad, ‘“‘ was yet good enough for 
Soldiers,” rebels from the Royalist point of view. Cromwell 
declared that they would not fail to remember that no Common- 
wealth could flourish without learning. On the roth the two 
Generals dined in Magdalen Hall and played bowls upon the 
College Green. They were created Doctors of Civil Law in 
Convocation, and sat in scarlet gowns at the Vice-Chancellor’s 
side. Several of their officers were admitted as Masters of 
Arts. A banquet at the Bodleian followed, and next day, 
Sunday, sermons at St. Mary’s. Henry Wilkinson and the 
Senior Proctor, ‘‘ though rank Presbyterians, yet prayed hard, 
if not heartily, for the Army and their blessed proceedings.” 
The visit passed without mishap, but it can hardly be wondered 
at if indignant Royalists seized the opportunity to murmur 
execrations and to drink defiant toasts. 
The first Board of Visitors lasted for four or five years, but, 
as time went on, the differences between Independents and 
Presbyterians increased. Friction repeatedly occurred between 
the Committee in London and the Visitors at Oxford. The

limits, to choose his own place of residence (Burrows, Reg. 190 and 207).

623-5). The Magdalen gold was afterwards refunded.

Committee may not always have been as well informed as the 
men on the spot. But in matters of policy their influence could 
not begainsaid. It was the London Committee which in Novem- 
ber 1648 required that the Negative Oath should be tendered 
to all members of Colleges,! abjuring connection with the 
King and his party. It was the London Committee which a 
year later ordered that the Engagement to be faithful to the 
Commonwealth as established without a King or House of 
Lords should be subscribed by all Fellows, graduates and officers 
of Colleges and Halls.2. Many Presbyterians found the Engage- 
ment unacceptable. There were protests against ‘‘ an ensnaring 
oath.” * Convocation under Reynolds’ leadership petitioned 
Parliament for leave to substitute a promise to live peaceably 
under the existing Government. But the Independents finally 
insisted on the letter of the law. The new oath was tendered 
and generally accepted, though not so generally approved. 
Some distinguished men like Conant found a formula which 
enabled them to take it. But Brent and Reynolds declined. 
Reynolds had to resign his offices. Brent ceased to act as 
Visitor and Warden before the end of 1651. Greenwood of 
Brasenose, an able Independent, became Vice-Chancellor, and 
John Owen, a man of still stronger personality, became Dean 
of Christ Church in Reynolds’ place. 
But before Reynolds was driven out of Christ Church the 
best work of the first Board of Visitors. had been done. As 
the need for harsh action diminished and the tale of expulsions 
came to an end, the opportunities for restoring the old condi- 
tions increased. The Colleges for the most part settled down 
and accepted the new dispensation, though in certain quarters 
an angry and sullen spirit survived. All the Colleges had suffered 
in their finances. Some of the poorer ones were in great straits. 
Oriel had borrowed sixty pounds from Rouse, the Librarian of 
the Bodleian. At University the Master and Fellows became 
non-resident and had to be recalled.6 Both at University and 
at other Colleges Fellowships had to be suspended. Revenues 
1 Wood says (Ann. II, 612) that Henry Wilkinson and Cheynell pressed 
this on the Committee, to the dislike of more moderate men. 
2 The Engagement was in the form of a promise—oaths were falling 
into discredit. It practically superseded the Covenant. Prynne at once 
produced a pamphlet against it. Cromwell seems to have been indisposed 
to press it.

“ Reynolds gave up the Deanery in March 1651. 
* See the order of March 22, 1650 (Burrows, Reg. 289-90). But in 
spite of debt the plans for building, helped by Sir Simon Bennet’s gift, 
went on. Later on there were protests in Parliament against the non- 
residence of Heads of Colleges, and in January 1658 a Bill to amend this 
was brought in (Mullinger, III, 503).

were failing and too many appointments had been made. The 
regulations which confined Fellowships to certain districts were 
also set aside. At St. John’s the new President was granted an 
additional hundred a year out of the bequest left by Sir William 
Paddy. It is worth noting that ecclesiastical prejudice did not 
refuse to sanction the payment of arrears due to the choir at 
St. John’s and to the organist at St. Mary’s.1 Other Head- 
ships besides St. John’s were felt to be inadequately paid. The 
account rendered to the Visitors in July 1649 estimated the 
Headships of University and Pembroke at only thirty pounds 
a year.? Balliol came next with thirty-three,* Oriel and Jesus 
with forty pounds each. Brasenose allowed its ruler sixty 
pounds, Lincoln ninety and Wadham a hundred. Twelve 
College Headships ranked as impecunious, and augmentations 
seem to have been granted to nearly all of them out of the profits 
of first-fruits and tenths,¢ but not always punctually paid. 
Christ Church and Magdalen, New College, All Souls, Corpus 
and Merton were comparatively well-to-do. 
Hand in hand with this revision of salaries went plans for 
revising College Statutes. A “Modell” was suggested, which 
contemplated changes in any regulations found to be “‘ impiouse, 
superstitiouse, or inconvenient,’”’ and which proposed to institute 
terminable Fellowships to prevent men from becoming “‘ droanes ”’5 
But of the details of the movement we know nothing, and it 
seems to have left no permanent trace. Attempts to enforce 
the old Statutes were probably better supported.* Latin con- 
versation was insisted on: Milton’s employers understood its 
value. It was ordered by the Committee in July 1649 
“ That the Visitors of the Universitie of Oxon be required to see 
either the Latin or Greeke be stricktly and constantly exercised and 
spoken, in their familier discourse within the said severall Colledges 
and Halls respectively, and that noe other language be spoken by 
any Fellow, Scholar, or Student whatsoever.’’? 
1 On the latter point see Reg. T (92). 
2 The salary at Trinity was put still lower, at £25, but the living of 
Garsington was attached. The Headship of Queen’s was valued at £70, 
and that of Exeter at £45 (Burrows, Reg. 246 and 251). 
® There was an odd 6s. 5d., which possibly the Master did not despise. 
« The augmentation at St. John’s from the Paddy bequest may have 
prevented a Treasury grant in that case. The facts about Oriel do not 
seem quite clear. The State Papers show that Professors also claimed 
and received augmentations, and Register T has many references to the 
augmented fees allowed to Registrar and Bedels.

  388 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
But the order required to be republished later. The old rules 
about dining in Hall were repeated. No women must act as 
bed-makers except ‘“‘auncient weomen and of good report.” 
Loose carriage and unseemly apparel were reproved. Powdered 
hair and ribbons were as objectionable as boots and spurs and 
“ bote-hose-tops.”” Wood lamented the neglect of caps and 
hoods, and was shocked to hear of John Owen, when he came 
to be Vice-Chancellor, sitting in Convocation with his hat on, 
“and that many times cockt.” But caps if not hats were 
apparently worn in church.1 Owen, it is to be feared, thought 
too much of appearances for a Puritan divine. It was said of 
him once that Mr. Dean “had as much powder in his haire 
that would discharge eight cannons.” Horses and hounds and 
“unbeseeming noises ” were discouraged, and suppers in taverns 
on fasting nights. There were real efforts to revive the studies 
of the Schools and to raise the level of education. There were 
real efforts to put down drinking, efforts which the Restoration 
largely swept away. On Sundays no tippling in common houses 
was permitted and no loitering in the streets. Coffee-houses 
began to supply an alternative to taverns. In 1650 Jacob, a 
Jew, opened a coffee-house at the Angel in the parish of St. 
Peter in the East. Sober concerts and scientific discussion 
came more into vogue. It is satisfactory to find the Visitors 
reporting in 1651 that, after examining a charge of drunkenness 
brought against certain Fellows of New College, ‘“ they cannot 
find the least inckling ” of it among those concerned, even though 
there is an ugly story of two drunken Chaplains of New College 
misbehaving in the fields near Iffley later on. 
Meanwhile the life of the University gradually reverted to 
the old channels. The Chancellor’s Court resumed its work.* 
In June 1651 the Act was revived. The old contentions with 
the City had revived in force already. The “‘ threatening ruin ” 
of the University ‘“‘ made the Citizens in a manner insolent.” 
They demanded the abolition of the old offering on St. Scholastica’s 
1 Wood (Life, I,290-1). The capping of seniors by juniors was insisted 
on still. 
2 Ib, (221). 
® See Reg. T (30) and a curious little pamphlet of Proposals for the 
veducing of both the Universities unto theiy ancient and intended lustre, 
proposals in regard to hours, fees, studies, colleges for mathematics and 
medicine, and educational tests for degrees (Worc. Coll. Pamph. BB. 8. 
15. 23). 
4 See ante (p. 360,n.). In July 1650, on the recommendation of the 
Delegates, the Visitors sanctioned a Statute vesting the Chancellor’s 
powers in the Vice-Chancellor during a vacancy in the Chancellorship, 
in order to allow the appointment of a Commissary to carry on the work 
of the Court (Wood’s Life, I, 163-4). See also Reg. T (15).

THE GREAT REBELLION 389 
day and of the old oath to observe the University’s liberties and 
customs. They raised questions of trading, of discommoning, 
of jurisdiction. And the University rose with the old spirit 
to the attack. Delegates were appointed to reply. A rate 
was raised to fight the issue. Langbaine tore the citizens’ 
arguments to tatters. The University made good its case, 
and on most points a working treaty was arranged. But the 
old oath and the old offering seem still to have been avoided 
till, after the Restoration, they were enforced on an appeal to 
the Crown.! The prosperity of the Colleges was returning slowly. 
Numbers increased to the old level.2 The manciples were bidden 
to levy the old fees. But in religious teaching, no doubt, the 
change was marked. While Church ritual was forbidden— 
non-submitters could not be tutors—sermons, prayers and 
religious exercises became astonishingly numerous. Goodwin 
was said to hold Independent méetings at Magdalen, where 
every one present made “ an open confession of his sins.” Staun- 
ton had religious meetings at Corpus, Langley at Pembroke, 
Rogers at New Inn Hall. ‘‘I thank my GOD from the Bottom of 
my Heart,” cried George Trosse, a Gentleman Commoner of 
Pembroke,’ ‘“‘ that I went to Oxford when there were so many 
Sermons preach’d, and so many Excellent, Orthodox, and practical 
Divines, to preach them.’”’ The Sectaries on their part com- 
plained that the Malignants molested their worship. Under- 
graduates sometimes broke into conventicles and misbehaved.‘ 
But if the cult of Godliness seemed sometimes excessive or 
ridiculous, it became among many of the leaders of the 
movement the habit and the refreshment of their lives. ‘‘ You 
shall not want my prayers,”’ wrote Cromwell to the University 
from Edinburgh, “That that seed and stock of Piety and 
Learning so marvellously springing up amongst you may be 
useful to that great and glorious Kingdom of our Lord Jesus 
Christ.” 
In January 1650 Pembroke, the Chancellor, died unlamented, 
and a year later, the right of free election having been formally

12, 114, 130), MS. Wood F. 27 (Art. 39), and Wood’s Life (I, 370-6). 
2 Burrows (Register, cxxxi) estimates the resident graduates and 
undergraduates under the Commonwealth at about 2,500. Langbaine— 
a good judgment—puts the total of Oxford students as high as 3,247 in 
1651 (Foundation of Universitie). But his figures generally include the 
College servants, and in some cases his estimates—Exeter is credited with 
230 members, Magdalen Hall with 220 students—seem high. If Lang- 
baine is correct the numbers were substantially higher than thirty years 
before.

  390 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
restored, Cromwell was elected in his place.1_ He accepted the 
post with characteristic hesitation. The offer deserved “a 
fuller return, of deep resentment, value and acknowledgment ”’ 
than he could make.? He felt bound to remind Convocation 
of his unfitness to serve them, of his “‘ being tied to attendance 
in another Land.” From that other land he soon swépt down 
with his unconquerable legions to destroy the Royalist forces 
at Worcester, but not before the authorities at Oxford had 
been scared by the young King’s approach. The Castle works 
were hastily demolished, and New College turned into a fortress 
instead, with much cutting of walls and erecting of defences, 
of which to this day the mound in the College garden remains.® 
And a troop of horse was raised among the scholars, bearing 
the motto Non Arte Sed Marte on its flag. After the battle 
there was an outbreak of anti-Royalist feeling. The King’s 
arms and effigies were defaced in public places. Superstitious 
monuments, ‘‘ postures of Prophets, Apostles and Saints” in 
windows, were destroyed.4 But the new Chancellor was no 
friend of disorder, and under his auspices the Government of 
the University quickly showed both intelligence and strength. 
For the moment John Owen, Cromwell’s old chaplain, was 
supreme, and Owen had from his undergraduate days been a 
remarkable man. He had been a student of Queen’s and a 
pupil of Barlow. He had plunged into every kind of study, 
including theology and Rabbinical lore. He had been no mean 
athlete. He had not disdained to learn the flute. He had left 
Oxford rather than submit to Laud’s autocracy, and had finally 
become one of the most celebrated of Independent preachers. 
He had accompanied Cromwell to Ireland and to Scotland, 
preaching while his leader fought. The General appreciated 
the strong character of his chaplain, and they worked together 
at the University, as they had done in the field. Owen was 
soon made Vice-Chancellor in succession to Greenwood. He 
was deputed, with four other leading members of the University, 
Wilkins of Wadham, Goddard of Merton, Goodwin of Magdalen 
1 Reg. T (120-1). Wood says (Ann. II, 630) that Cromwell was 
unanimously elected. It is significant if there was at any rate no open 
opposition. But all must have realised that Cromwell could be a powerful 
friend. 
2 See Carlyle (Cromwell’s Letters and Speeches, 1870, III, 132). 
® Wood speaks of a new fort built in New College lane, etc. (Life, I, 
170). In September 1649, during a brief mutiny of the Oxford garrison, 
Lilburne’s followers had seized the magazine at New College and had 
imprisoned Ingoldsby there. 
# Wood accuses Henry Wilkinson, the Canon, of joining in the deface- 
ment of Christ Church (Ann. II, 649). But it is doubtful if the outbreak 
amounted to very much.

and Canon French, to exercise the Chancellor’s authority in his 
absence. He joined the first Board of Visitors before its dis- 
appearance, and he was the most prominent member of the 
new Board appointed in 1652. 
The new Board had its origin in a University petition, sent 
up on the dissolution of the original Parliamentary Committee, 
which asked for a smaller body of Visitors, resident in Oxford, 
to carry on the work begun. A review of existing Statutes, 
both in the University and in the Colleges, was to be within its 
powers. Parliament to a large extent accepted the suggestion, 
and Cromwell, it seems, took the chief share in appointing the 
members of the Board. But for reasons not explained, possibly 
owing to opposition in Oxford,® the new Visitors did not begin 
their sittings until June 1653. They included not only John 
Owen, the Dean, but his namesake Thankful Owen, who had 
now succeeded Cheynell as President of St. John’s. They 
included also Goodwin and Conant, Goddard and French.® 
The work of expulsion was practically over, and under its Puritan 
rulers the discipline and organisation of the University improved. 
They did not forget the aims which their leaders had put for- 
ward, ‘“ the advancement of Piety, the improvement of Literature, 
and the good Government of this place.” There were new 
regulations for College Tutors. They must be godly men and 
pray daily with their pupils.” Great stress was laid on preaching. 
Strict rules for College sermons were enforced. Notes were 
expected to be taken. Gentlemen Commoners were required 
to do exercises like others, “to the intent that noe person may 
live idlely in this University, and that gentlemen may answere 
the expectation of their freinds.” The Colleges gradually

and degrees. 
8 The last sitting of this Board recorded in the Registey (Burrows, 
353-5) was attended by Owen, Harris, Rogers, Conant and French, on 
the 13th April 1652. 
8 There are various Lives of Owen, including one by W. Orme, in 
vol. I of Russell’s ed. of his Works, one by Thomson in vol. I of Goold’s 
edition of his Works, one prefixed to the Collection of his Sermons in 1721, 
one in the Biographia Britannica, etc. See references in D.N.B. But 
our knowledge of his action in the University comes mainly from Wood, 
who is strongly prejudiced. 
“See MS. Wood F. 35 (f. 366). 
5 This is Wood’s suggestion (Ann. II, 650-2). There may have been 
political reasons also. 
® The others—they were all intended to be temporary appointments— 
were Staunton, President of Corpus, Basnett of All Souls and Howell of 
Exeter. The Vice-Chancellor was to be a tenth member ex officio, but 
John Owen was Vice-Chancellor already. (See MS. Wood F. 35, f. 367).

recovered their freedom of election.1 And though candidates 
for places on College foundations had still to produce testimonials 
approved by the Visitors, certifying to their godliness and 
proficiency in learning,? the movement for restoring the Uni- 
versity’s independence gathered strength. Cromwell was not 
inclined to tolerate any reckless interference with Oxford and 
Cambridge, and Cromwell’s star was rising higher daily. When 
he assumed the office of Protector a congratulatory address 
from Convocation was forthcoming as readily as in Plantagenet 
or Tudor times. ‘‘ The mind is the man,” the new ruler told 
his followers. ‘‘Ifthat be kept pure, a man signifies somewhat ; 
if not I would very fain see what difference there is betwixt 
him and a beast.” 
In February 1654 His Highness summoned Goodwin, the 
President of Magdalen, to London, and it may be that Goodwin’s 
influence with the Protector to some extent superseded John 
Owen’s.* In September a third set of Visitors was appointed, 
among whom the Dean for a time took a less conspicuous place.* 
Harris, Rogers and Henry Wilkinson reappeared. Conant and 
Thankful Owen continued to sit.5 According to Wood, Goodwin 
packed the Board with his own friends, and the Dean, “ per- 
ceiving himself fool’d,” was unwilling to act with them. Be 
that as it may, John Owen as Vice-Chancellor remained the 
dominant figure in the University, and before long he was 
leading, if not driving, the Visitors again. At the same time 
his activity in theological pamphleteering took a fresh lease 
of life.6 On many points, no doubt, the members of the new 
Board were at one. They seem to have issued very few orders 
until May 1655,? and in April 1658 their activities suddenly 
stopped. The first considerations still were sermons and religious

2 See Langbaine’s letter to Selden, protesting that he would not submit 
to this (MS. Tann. 52, f. 60). 
8 This is Prof. Burrows’ view (Reg. lxxix). But Cromwell re- 
appointed Owen Vice-Chancellor in 1654, 1655 and 1656 (Reg. T, 255, 
269 and 290). 
4 He is not mentioned in the Register as present before Jan. 1657 
(Burrows, 418); but, if Wood’s narrative be correct, he must have 
attended sooner. 
6 Goddard, French and Howell also reappeared, but Staunton and 
Basnett were replaced by two new members, Philip Stephens of Hart Hall 
and James Baron of Magdalen College. Wood (Amn. II, 661-2) gives an 
additional list of 13 laymen, headed by Lord Saye and Sele. But there 
is no evidence that they took part in the work of the Board at Oxford. 
(See also MS. Wood, 35, f. 368).

exercises. Masters and Bachelors were rebuked for neglecting 
public worship. Cromwell was known to desire toleration : 
but practical piety must be enforced. All Bachelors and under- 
graduates were required, every Lord’s Day, to give an account 
of the sermons they had heard. It was ordered “that there 
be catechising weekely ” in every College and Hall on Saturday 
afternoons. At Corpus, which did not provide sufficiently for 
preaching, fortnightly sermons in the Chapel were instituted, 
“about an houre long.” Corpus also required some readjust- 
ment of its salaries, and the Visitors intervened to revise the 
College accounts. Differences of a more serious kind called for 
settlement at Jesus. The Visitors tried to compose quarrels 
both there and elsewhere. Questions arose between artists and 
jurists at New College. The endowments given for Canonists 
were continued, but those who accepted them were “ injoyned 
to professe Divinity.’’ Old tradition impelled even Cromwell’s 
Visitors to fight against the secularisation of the Faculty of 
Law. But an attempt to revive the study of Civil Law in Ox- 
ford, promoted by Dr. Langbaine, was already on foot.1 New 
College gave more trouble by its weakness for corrupt elections, 
and all College electors were sworn to nominate no men to 
Fellowships who were suspected of having directly or indirectly 
paid for their promotion. All Souls was on this point an even 
more obstinate offender. It had for long, ‘‘to the dishonour 
of the University, suffered under a common reputation of cor- 
ruption,” and in 1657 the testimony of one conscience-stricken 
Fellow brought the scandal once again to light. The Visitors 
interposed with vigour. The matter was carried to the Lord 
Protector, who assured the reformers of his sympathy.2 But 
the Board came to an end and the abuse continued, till Arch- 
bishop Sancroft dealt with it in later years. 
On other points the Visitors may have found it less easy 
to agree. It is difficult to say how far John Owen was behind 
the movement towards greater freedom, which led to the appoint- 
ment, in January 1655, of delegates® as influential as Wilkins 
and Greenwood, Langbaine, Wallis and Ward to discuss proposals 
for limiting the Visitors’ powers. The Ordinance appointing 
the new Board had apparently caused some alarm in Oxford, 
and the Colleges were, no doubt, seriously disquieted by pro- 
posals to revise their Statutes. They begged that they might be

Souls see State Papers, 1657-8 (181-2, 236-7, 260, 278-9). 
8 It was technically a Sub-Delegacy with 9 members (see Wood’s 
account, Ann. II, 663-6).
-P-A-G-E-450
  394 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
consulted on the subject, and that no alterations might take effect 
until confirmed by the Protector and Parliament. They asked 
that the Visitors’ powers should not extend to Colleges which 
had Visitors of their own, and should, where no such Visitors 
existed, be limited by College Statutes. They suggested that a 
number of University representatives, Heads of Houses, Fellows, 
Professors and others, should be associated with the Board, 
that Visitors who were members of the University should be 
chosen in Convocation, and that their powers should be limited 
to one year and no more. Palmer, the Warden of All Souls, 
made himself the spokesman of these bold proposals, by which 
the University in effect demanded the right to take its govern- 
ment into its own hands. John Owen seems to have been 
present when the Visitors discussed them, but the Board thought 
it inadvisable to negotiate with the Sub-Delegacy further. 
French and Goddard, who were in London, and were supposed 
to have the Lord Protector’s ear, advised the delegates that the 
Ordinance could not be altered except by Parliament, though 
it might, if necessary, be modified or explained. But their 
answer seems to have relieved the apprehensions felt.1 The 
old spirit of independence in the University was stirring. As 
time passed, its members pleaded with force that nine years 
of supervision were “ sufficient to purge and correct all humours 
and malignity.”” They assured the authorities that Royalism 
was extinguished. They insisted that unstatutable Visitors, 
residing at Oxford and involved in its differences and factions, 
were less satisfactory than the disinterested College Visitors 
of older days. They requested Parliament to appoint certain 
honourable personages to act as College Visitors in the room 
of the displaced Bishops, and to sweep the Board of Commis- 
sioners away. These proposals had support,? though Conant 
threw his influence against them. They came to nothing, but the 
— may have contributed to bring the Visitation to an 
end. 
The Vice-Chancellor may or may not have approved of 
opposition to authority in the case of his colleagues. He was 
clearly no lover of opposition to his own, and he never faltered 
in the expression of his views. In 1654 he was chosen as

Visitor for Lincoln College (Mullinger, III, 504). See also Wood’s list of 
intended Visitors (Ann. II, 679-80). Wood mentions this under 1657, 
but Conant’s Life, written by his son and edited by W. Stanton, dates 
the petitions on the subject “ the latter end of the year 1658” (p. 28). 
The agitation seems to have continued from 1657 to 1659, and the proposal 
to nominate separate Visitors for the Colleges was, no doubt, part of the” 
plan for getting rid of the Commission,

Burgess for the University, but was not allowed to sit. In 
1655, when Royalist risings caused anxiety, he raised a troop 
of scholars and rode out with sword and pistols at their head. 
He objected strongly to the wearing of “‘ formalities,’’ and was 
said to brow-beat those who advocated distinctive symbols of 
degrees. If he could not induce Convocation to put down 
“the use of Habits,’’ he would at least have them dispensed 
with by anyone who wished.1. He would have liked to abolish 
the Act, which had become an occasion for levity and disorder. 
The celebration in 1651 had drawn such crowds that a guard 
of musketeers had been required. He could not tolerate the 
license of the Terre Filit, who had developed perhaps a scandalous 
habit of poking fun at the godly party. On one occasion he 
pulled down an offender with his own hands and packed him 
off under arrest to Bocardo. Owen was a strong administrator. 
He pressed his reforms keenly, the improvement of work and 
morals, the development of disputations, the abolition of treat- 
ing and unnecessary oaths. On many points Convocation was 
not unwilling to follow his lead; and in 1656 new rules were 
adopted, which checked the multiplication of oaths and the 
abuses of entertaining, and which provided careful methods of 
examination for Bachelors seeking the Master’s degree. But 
on other points the Vice-Chancellor went too fast, and to his 
indignation he found his proposals over-ruled. When resistance 
in Convocation was forthcoming, he took it in bad part, and 
urged the Visitors to use their authority to insist on the changes 
he desired. He determined, it seems, to break the power of 
his opponents, to diminish especially the influence enjoyed in 
Convocation by the younger men. The Visitors began to dis- 
cuss plans for remodelling that assembly, and in these schemes 
it appears that Goodwin supported Owen, while Conant and 
Rogers objected to stretching the power of the Visitors too far. 
The Vice-Chancellor was a difficult man to beat. He persisted 
and carried his proposals to London. But pressure was probably 
put upon him there. Goddard advised cautious action, and the 
schemes for re-modelling Convocation fell to the ground. Owen’s 
popularity suffered in the struggle, and it is evident that his 
eagerness carried him too far. When Conant was appointed 
Vice-Chancellor in 1657, the “universal shout of a very full

Wood’s Life (I, 206-7). Elsewhere (Ann. II, 670-1) Wood suggests that 
disputations in divinity were overdone. Declamations had already 
(1652) replaced ‘‘ wall-lectures ’’ by Bachelors in the School of Natural 
Philosophy (Life, I, 177, and Ann. II, 652-3).

convocation ”’ found a vent for the feelings which his predecessor 
had aroused.? 
Owen, whatever errors he committed, left the University 
stronger than before. Its treasury, he proudly claimed, had 
been increased tenfold, its salaries restored, its rights main-— 
tained, its studies and its discipline improved. When he handed 
over his authority to Conant, his work and the work of the 
Independents was done. Wood tries to contrast them with | 
their theological rivals. The Presbyterians were more severe 
in manners, dress and talk. They preached damnation. The > 
Independents were more for liberty : they could be even frolic- 
some and gay. He counts Reynolds and Conant among the 
leaders of the first party, the two Owens and Goodwin among 
the leaders of the second. But he adds that they were apt to 
unite against ‘the common enimy,” and he often finds it 
hard to differentiate in their administration of University affairs. | 
He calls them both impartially factious, saucy, impudent, 
morose. He finds their prayers exaggerated but their disputa- 
tions very keen: the argument would sometimes pass from 
words to blows in the street. He mentions their love of buying 
books : money was “‘ then stirring and comming from the new 
gentlemen.” He dwells on their love of instrumental music, 
their avoidance of taverns—unless there were a back way in. 
But he declares that they introduced entertaining in their 
chambers, where tarts and custards, cheese-cakes and junkets 
replaced the old “ stirr’d machet ” or the cup of College ale.” 
He evidently thinks that the young bloods of the Puritan party 
were as fond of smart clothes as the Cavaliers. He chronicles 
other strange movements in religion—the Quakers arriving, 
“unstable people,” and settling in 1654 in an old stone house 
almost opposite New Inn, the Anabaptists threatening to rise 
in 1658, when scholars as well as troops had to be on guard. 
He chronicles other controversies also, a wrangle in Convocation 
over Dr. Wallis’ election as Keeper of the Archives, so prolonged 
that candles were needed—an unheard-of thing? The “ dregs 
of the people” might have grown wiser than their teachers. 
Upstarts might be replacing the ancient gentry of the land. 
Yet the University was full, well taught, not badly governed.

2 Sweet things and temperance went together (Wood’s Life, I, 298). 
3 In Feb. 1658. Dr. Zouch complained of unfairness in the scrutiny

probably came in. See the pamphlet by Henry Stubbe of Christ Church, 
The Savilian Professours Case Stated, and Wood’s note in the Athene (ed. 
Bliss, III, 1073-6). In 1660 there was a sharp controversy over the

  THE GREAT REBELLION 397 
In Oxford, as in England, the great Protector was supreme. 
He gave manuscripts to the Library. He provided a hundred 
pounds a year for a Divinity Reader. The University seemed 
tobe devotedtohim. Even through Wood’s inveterate prejudice 
a grudging admiration peeps. 
Other observers living in the Oxford of the Commonwealth 
helped to complete the picture of those times. Joseph William- 
son, a not inconspicuous figure in the tangled politics of Charles 
II's reign—a batteler of Queen’s in 1650, a Fellow in 1657— 
kept up for many years a close correspondence with Lamplugh 
and Halton, Barlow and Wallis, Bathurst, Fell and other Oxford 
friends.t One tutor confides to him that his pupils “who go 
back in logic do not go forward in other things.” Another, 
Lamplugh, writes that ‘‘ rudeness and coursing” are being put 
down by the Heads of Houses.2. Another, Halton, describes 
the christening of the younger Gerard Langbaine “after the 
new cut, without godfathers,” or the election of Lamplugh to 
a Queen’s Fellowship after five hours’ canvass, or the growing 
influence of Wilkins, “the rising sun since his marriage with 
the Protector’s sister,” or the battle over hoods in Convocation 
—‘ we had nigh lost formalities, though caps were never more 
in fashion.” We hear of a traveller who had gone to Oxford 
with introductions from Williamson, and who “ cannot recount 
the kindnesses received” in that “enchanted country.” We 
hear incidentally, towards the end of 1657, that Dr. Owen, 
who has ceased to be Vice-Chancellor, seems angry : ‘‘ he cannot 
well digest a private life.”® Queen’s and Queen’s men are 
naturally prominent. The College held an important place in 
the University of that day. 
Outside Oxford criticism might be more outspoken, less 
easily satisfied with a time-honoured routine. Manchester had 
already petitioned for a new University in the North of England. 
Suggestions had been made for Universities in London and in 
York. A proposal for a University at Durham found some 
favour with the House of Cromwell. And attacks on the old 
Universities as “‘ idolatrous high places,” as nurseries of wicked- 
ness, dens of formal drones, were dangerously popular with the 
fanatics of the day. The Little Parliament seemed very ready 
to encourage rash opinions. John Owen once declared that to

from 1655 onwards. It is after the Restoration, as Williamson’s influence 
increases, that the University leaders turn to him most.

run down and confute another in disputation ” (Athena, ed. Bliss, IV,

defend the Universities was regarded by some as an offence 
against religion. Critics drawing their experience from Cam- 
bridge, John Hall, a brilliant student of St. John’s, and William 
Dell, an Army Chaplain who entered Oxford with Fairfax, 
and afterwards Master of Caius College, did not spare the system 
then in vogue! Hall was contemptuous of the “shreds of 
Latine,” the smattering of Greek, the ‘‘ harsh abstracted ” 
logic, the jejune philosophy, the need for a more “ready and 
generous teaching of the tongues.” Dell could not rid himself 
of the idea that there was something anti-Christian in the old 
learning. But he was alive to the need of education. He 
would have recognised it as the duty of the State. He asked 
for more schools, for a wider course of study. He pleaded for 
University teaching for all great English towns. Critics far 
more famous than these were found among the reformers. 
While Englishmen were engaged in fighting one another, Descartes’ 
philosophy had been spreading over Europe, and his disciples 
could not be satisfied with the old idolatry of Aristotle or the 
cramping limitations of the Oxford Schools. Hobbes, if ‘a 
radical in the service of reaction,” did not hesitate to deal hard 
blows at the reactionary spirit in the educational world.2 He 
had no pity for the barbarous Latin of the Schoolmen, the 
“charms compounded of metaphysics, miracles and traditions,” 
the science “strangled by a snare of words.” And Milton, 
who had never forgotten the “asinine feast of sow-thistles and 
brambles,” to which at Cambridge his fine young intellect had 
been condemned, denounced with all the scorn of his rich and 
splendid rhetoric the years mis-spent in learning ‘‘ mere words, 
or such things chiefly as were better unlearned.” Already in 
a well-known tract he had sketched his own ideal of “‘ a virtuous 
and noble education,” an ideal which few scholars would have 
found it easy to achieve. And in 1659 he returned to the sub- 
ject, over-stating his case, as even great controversialists can, 
declaring that the theological disputations of Oxford and Cam- 
bridge did little but ‘“‘leaven pure doctrine with sophistical 
trash,”’ and denying that a University education was in any 
degree necessary for a minister or a divine? 
Hobbes did not realise how much his old University had

altered since he had haunted its bookshops and gaped over 
the maps there half a century before. John Hall would probably 
have been fairer to Oxford science, readier to admit that in the 
Oxford of the Commonwealth there were students rich in pro- 
mise and performance, even apart from Professors and Heads. 
Thomas Sydenham, destined to leave one of the most famous 
names in English medicine, had already passed in 1648 from 
Wadham to All Souls. Christopher Wren followed him at both 
Colleges in turn. William Petty, an intruded Fellow, was 
Vice-Principal at Brasenose in 1651, and with his goose-grey 
eyes and marvellous good-nature was teaching anatomy in 
Clayton’s place.1_ John Locke became a Christ Church Student 
in 1652: Robert South had just preceded him from Westminster, 
Nathaniel Crewe joined Lincoln in the same year. Charles 
Sedley brought his shameless wit to Wadham later. Thomas 
Ken came up to New College with his love of music and his 
large charity for the poor. Wilkins had already gathered 
round him at Wadham a brilliant group of scientific men. It 
was in the Oxford of the Commonwealth that the new birth 
of science found a home. Wilkins had been associated a few 
years earlier with Jonathan Goddard, John Wallis and others 
in the little company of keen inquirers, the “‘ Invisible College ” 
of Robert Boyle, who met in London before the Civil War was 
over, for scientific discussion and research. Goddard became 
chief physician to Cromwell’s armies ; in later days his medicines 
excited the curiosity of Charles II? Wallis, for long a con- 
spicuous figure in Oxford, proved to be a man of remarkable 
powers. He had few rivals in the sphere of mathematics, as 
Hobbes, who challenged him, found to his cost. And Boyle, 
the grave, delicate boy in his teens, who had already studied 
in Florence “ the new paradoxes of the great star-gazer Galileo,” 
and whose earnest industry would not be discouraged from 
reading the Scriptures in Syriac and Chaldee, dedicated to the 
pursuit of the new experimental philosophy an enthusiam which 
won the hearts of older men. Vulcan, he declared, had trans- 
ported and bewitched him: his laboratory seemed to him “a 
kind of Elysium.” He contributed also to the counsels of the 
new philosophers the prestige of his standing and his wealth. 
When Wilkins and Goddard were appointed Heads of Oxford 
Colleges and Wallis Savilian Professor of Geometry, this little 
company of fathers of the Royal Society transferred itself for 
the most part to Oxford. And there it was reinforced by other

celebrated men. Petty was performing feats of dissection, 
which delighted all students of medicine. The revival of Anne 
Green, who had been hanged in the Castle Yard for murder, had 
pleasantly stirred the academic world. Thomas Willis, already 
established in practice in Oxford, was glad enough, churchman 
and King’s man as he was, to meet political opponents upon 
common ground. Ralph Bathurst, Willis’ great friend, who in 
troubled days had also turned to medicine for a livelihood, was 
drawn into the same association. Thomas Millington of All 
Souls, doctor in later days to King William and Queen Anne, 
helped Willis in some of his studies. So did that astonishing 
young scholar Christopher Wren, to whom no form of know- 
ledge came amiss. Seth Ward, Savilian Professor of Astronomy, 
like Wallis a distinguished mathematician from Cambridge, had 
been attracted to Wadham largely by Wilkins’ ability and charm. 
His lectures soon restored the reputation of his Chair. Laurence 
Rooke was another Cambridge astronomer who found a home 
at Wadham, Walter Pope, the friend of Boyle and the biographer 
of Ward, a third. To Cambridge men no small part of the club’s 
success was due. Thomas Sprat, an unwary eulogist of Cromwell, 
a perplexed prelate under James II, a writer of poor verse and 
admirable prose, learned at Wadham enough science to make 
him the Royal Society’s historian. Boyle himself could not 
keep away from friends who looked upon him as a leader. He 
settled in Oxford in 1654, and his rooms at Deep Hall, next to 
University College, became almost as constant a meeting- 
place of the new philosophers as the Warden’s Lodgings at 
Wadham. Wood says that Boyle afterwards settled in these 
lodgings ‘‘ Peter Sthael,” an eminent chemist and Rosicrucian,+* 
a great hater of women and a very useful man, who taught many 
eminent people, including Wood himself. John Locke was 
conspicuous among these pupils for his habit of talking and 
refusing to take notes. Wood also insists that the famous little 
company met first at Petty’s lodgings by All Souls, and only 
transferred their gatherings to Wadham when Petty was called 
away by official work to Ireland,? to win repute as administrator, 
economist and statesman, and as one of the most attractive 
figures of the age. Be that as it may, the “ Vertuosi” did not 
escape criticism in Oxford. Students of the older stamp, lovers

clearly says that the earliest Oxford meetings were in Petty’s lodgings, 
though Sprat (Hist. of Royal Soc. 53) does not mention these, The 
Gresham College meetings apparently continued intermittently all the 
time.

  THE GREAT REBELLION 401 
of polemical divinity, may have wondered at the passionate 
interest in theology which went hand in hand with a passion 
for chemistry in men like Boyle and Rooke. Self-satisfied 
devotees of Aristotle and Galen regarded the new practical 
developments of medicine, which appealed so powerfully to 
Sydenham and to Petty, as fit only for ‘“ Quacks Salvers and 
Apothecaries boys.’”” But the fascination of knowledge proved 
too strong even for the stubbornest University traditions, and 
Oxford science woke to sudden life and splendour under the 
touch of Wilkins, Boyle and Wren. 
Conant replaced Owen as Vice-Chancellor in October 1657. 
He was Richard Cromwell’s nominee. The great Protector 
had resigned the Chancellorship three months before. Conant 
had succeeded Hoyle as Professor of Divinity a few years earlier, 
and his lectures had been received with great applause. He 
had made his College the most popular in Oxford: there were 
more students than could be lodged within the walls. His chief 
care, says his biographer, was “to plant the fear of God in the 
youth there.’? The Exeter tutors were expected to be pious as 
well as learned. The Rector himself supervised the religious 
education, the conduct and the expenses of the scholars. As 
Vice-Chancellor Conant took the same keen interest in the welfare 
of undergraduates outside his own College. He would make 
his rounds, we are told, at late hours, and “ferret ”’ them out 
of the public-houses. He would not wink at punishable things. 
He restored order in the University disputations, and would 
often be present in person. He prohibited the sale of a book 
by Francis Osborne, which was said to breed atheism in country 
gentlemen: ‘‘the book,” Wood notes, ‘“‘ afterwards sold the 
more.” He endeavoured, though vainly, to suppress the Terre 
Filii, whose freedom of expression scandalised decorous minds. 
Lancelot Addison of Queen’s, who lived to be a Dean and 
Joseph’s father, was compelled to ask pardon on his bended 
knees for the offence which he had given : 
“‘ Ego, Lancelotus Adison, agnosco me graviter peccasse in bonos 
mores et almam matrem Academiam, pudenda illa obscaenitate qua 
hesterno meam et Academiae famam laesi.’’ * 
Conant, unlike Owen, was in favour of ‘‘ academical habits,’ 
in which he “‘ could never discern any shadow of hurt.” * Hestood

in the University against them.! He is even said to have sent 
word to Owen in London that “ he must make hast to Oxon for 
godliness layes a gasping” there. But the work of the Board 
had already ceased. Their last order in the Register is dated 
the 8th April 1658, and before long they seem to have quietly 
| disappeared. Conant disliked the proposal that Parliament 
should nominate College Visitors. He led Convocation in 
| opposing the grant of University status to the College which 
| Cromwell had founded at Durham. Oxford had “ great reason 
to be jealous of opening a door by such a precedent.” By such 
multiplying of Universities the “‘maine end of them” would 
be “ quite destroyed.” He kept the University prosperous 
and in good repute. In 1658 the number of matriculations 
reached a figure which was not to be exceeded for very many 
years.* 
In politics Conant was never extreme. He was loyal to 
Richard Cromwell as Chancellor. He joined in proclaiming 
him Protector, and in the difficult days which followed he seems 
to have steered a judicious course. It soon became evident that 
Richard’s Government could not stand. In a letter to Con- 
vocation, dated 6th October 1659, Richard spoke of the 
“signall changes of the hand of God towards mee,”’ and offered 
to “devest ” himself of the Chancellorship if he could no longer 
serve his friends. For a short time the Army leaders made 
and un-made the rulers of the country. But the Presbyterians 
in the University were suspected of praying for the success of 
Royalist rebels. Convocation occupied itself with Selden’s 
great bequest.5 In December 1659 a rate to pay for the carriage, 
binding and installation of the books was levied on all members 
of the University, servitors excepted. Proposals to raise forces 
to defend “‘ the cause ”’ in Oxford apparently fell through. From 
Scotland, as the New Year broke, Monk advanced, to find himself 
a conqueror with all parties bidding for his support. A cry for 
a free Parliament was rising in the land. John Owen was

prominent in the efforts made to secure the General for the Inde- 
pendent party. But the Presbyterians triumphed with the 
triumph of Parliament, and Owen and his friends saw their hopes 
disappear. In March Reynolds returned as Dean to Christ 
Church,! to co-operate with the Vice-Chancellor, his son-in-law, 
in promoting the reaction which most moderate men desired. 
Conant and Reynolds both made up their minds to the return 
of the King. ‘‘ Those that had laid under a cloud for several 
years ” began to reappear with cheerful faces. In January 1660 
an Anabaptist preacher at St. Peter’s in the Bailey, who denounced 
the change in public opinion, was stopped by the Vice-Chancellor 
and turned out of the church. 
On the night of the 13th February there was a wild out- 
break of rejoicing in Oxford. News of Monk’s momentous 
declaration had arrived. Bells were rung and bonfires lighted. 
Rumps were burned at Queen’s College gate, and a rump was 
thrown up against the Warden’s windows at All Souls, where 
Palmer, “a great favourite of Oliver,” lay dying. In April the 
Royal arms and the King’s head reappeared. Monk, invited 
to represent Oxford University in Parliament, suggested Lenthall, 
“a worthy Patriote,” instead. But his letters did not prevail 
on Convocation.? On May-day a Maypole was set up at the Bear 
Inn in the High Street,? and the Vice-Chancellor and Bedels, 
coming to destroy it, were compelled to give way. Many other 
Maypoles were erected, by way of provocation, before the month 
was out. On the 8th May Richard Cromwell at last resigned 
his post as Chancellor: God had been pleased so to change his 
condition that he could not ‘‘ answer the ends ”’ of that office.* 
On the 2oth, the fateful day, Oxford loyalists may be pardoned 
if they lost their heads. The jollity continued till next morning. 
“The world of England,” says Wood, ‘‘was perfectly mad.” 
The Vice-Chancellor went to London to congratulate his Majesty 
in admirable prose and less admirable verses. But neither he 
nor Reynolds nor the moderate men about them had power to 
stem the flood they had unloosed. Conant himself was before 
long swept aside. But he and his colleagues, whether Presby- 
terians or Independents, could at least plead that in the hour of 
their triumph they had rendered good service to the University 
for which they toiled. Clarendon returning, mistrustful and cen- 
sorious, to the beautiful city which he knew so well, marvelled

  CHAPTER XIX 
THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 
“Cuncta aperit secreta dies, ex tempore verum 
Nascitur, et veniens aetas abscondita pandit.” 
“So teach me to number my daies that I may apply my heart 
unto wisdome.” 
Anthony Wood may not always have remembered the 
mottoes which he chose for the diary of his life. But few 
writers have pursued their purpose with an industry more 
single-minded, and none have a better claim to the title of 
“ historiographer and antiquarie of the most famous University of 
Oxford,” which he justly and jealously bestowed upon himself. 
For the latter half of the seventeenth century the authority of 
Wood’s diaries is unrivalled. Their rancours may have to be 
discounted, but their record cannot be spared. His notes, his 
jottings, his scraps of biography, his vivid comments, his un- 
sleeping interest in the frailties and littlenesses of his fellow-men, 
are full of the richest material that a historian can desire. There 
are greater figures of course in the Oxford of the Commonwealth 
and the Restoration. Owen, Conant, Fell and Bathurst, 
many another, fill far larger spaces in University affairs. But 
there is no figure which represents and gathers round it so much 
of the history and spirit of the place, as that of the shy, lonely 
and self-conscious student, denied by infirmities of temper and 
of judgment the homage which posterity has rendered him so 
freely since, poring for ever over his manuscripts in the quiet attic 
of the house in Merton Street, reading, copying, studying, borrow- 
ing, in emergencies even stealing the materials he coveted,! 
building up remorselessly his pungent little chronicle side by 
side with the greater works given to the world, and avenging 
himself for every slight which his sensitiveness too easily imagined 
by a fresh turn of his facile and unsparing pen. 
The Wood family came, as they believed, from Lancashire.? LT is not given to every man to live up to his own standards.

Traditions told of a priest under Queen Mary, who refused to 
conform to the laws of Elizabeth, of women-servants in the 
household of Lord Derby, of near ancestors who settled at Isling- 
ton and gathered wealth. Anthony Wood’s father, Thomas, 
was a student of Broadgates Hall, where in 1619 he took the 
degree of Bachelor of Civil Law.1 He was a man of some little 
property, increased by his first marriage to ‘an antient and rich 
maid,” and he invested largely in Oxford leaseholds, of which 
Postmasters Hall in Merton Street and “the great inne called 
the Flour de Luce ’’ were the chief.2_ He married for the second 
time Mary Petty, of an Oxfordshire family with wide connec- 
tions,3 and Anthony, the fourth child of this marriage, was born 
in December 1632, in the old stone house opposite the gate of 
Merton College, in which by choice or circumstance he spent his 
life. He could recollect being carried in his nurse’s arms to the 
garden of Canon Iles’ house in Christ Church, to see the King 
and Queen arrive in 1636. He remembered being knocked over 
by a horse called Mutton, belonging to the University carrier, 
at his father’s door. He remembered his early schooling in “a 
Latine school” near St. Peter’s in the Bailey, and afterwards 
in the school beside the cloister of New College. He remembered 
how his father, when the musterings began, provided armour 
for one of his servants, how his eldest brother Thomas, then a 
Christ Church undergraduate, longed to put it on, and how the 
school-boys at New College flocked to see the scholars and privi- 
leged men drill in the quadrangle. He remembered, too well, 
the confusion caused by the outbreak of the war, the digging of 
trenches and moving of troops, the King’s entry after Edgehill 
with the young Princes about him—Tom ran away to fight in 
the battle and to win a commission in the Royal forces—the 
removal of Mr. Wood and his family ‘to a little house in his 
backside ’’ when the house in Merton Street was taken for Cole- 
peper’s lodgings, and the removal of the School at New College, 
when the cloister was needed as a magazine, to a “ dark nasty” 
room at the East end of the Hall. 
all in Dr. Clark’s monumental work. Wood’s autobiography, down to 
June 1672, was printed by Hearne in 1730 at the end of his edition of 
Thomae Caii Vindiciae Antiquitatis Academiae Oxon. Wood’s journal- 
notes or pocket almanacs carried the story of his life down to 1695, and 
were to a certain extent used in Huddesford’s edition of the autobiography 
in 1772. But Dr. Clark’s work has superseded every other on the subject. 
Hearne’s Remarks and Collections (O.H.S.), which also have now found 
a devoted editor, contain several references to Wood. 
1 He took his B.A. in 1603 from Corpus, where his son thought he was 
“one of the clerks” (Life, I, 78).

-P-A-G-E-463
THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 407 
Early in 1643 Wood’s father died. His eldest brother, Thomas, 
was then “‘ a rude and boisterous soldier,” and his second brother, 
Edward, “a yong scholler of Trinity Coll.” Anthony continued 
for a time at the New College school, and his christening ‘‘ plate ” 
was swept off to the Royal Mint. But in 1644, when the Parlia- 
mentary armies were threatening Oxford, Mrs. Wood sent 
Anthony and his younger brother Christopher away to Tets- 
worth and afterwards to Thame. At Thame they were “ lovingly 
received” at the Vicarage—the Vicar’s wife was a kinswoman 
of Mrs. Wood—and entered at the Free School, where the master 
also had married a Petty. Anthony tells us that in these days 
—he was barely twelve—he was “‘ very sedulous,” an early riser, 
but given to thinking, to melancholy, and to walking in his sleep. 
He and his brother liked the place, though roving soldiers were 
always disturbing them, and the “‘ juvenile muses in the vicaridge 
house’ were constantly alarmed.1. The boys found occasion 
to talk to the troopers, to enjoy the venison pasties which were 
sometimes left behind, and to note the Parliamentary sympathies 
of Vicar and school-master alike. But as soon as the siege of 
Oxford was over, Mrs. Wood was obliged to take her boys away 
from Thame. They returned to find Oxford ‘‘empty as to 
scholars, but pretty well replenish’d with parliamentarian 
soldiers,” and the young men alike in University and city “ de- 
bauch’d by bearing armes.”’ 
Mrs. Wood’s property had suffered in the great Oxford fire 
of October 1644, and she was evidently hard put to it to provide 
for her sons. Anthony was sent for a time to be tutored by his 
brother Edward, in the cockle-loft over the gate of Trinity 
College. But his mother was ‘‘so silly’ that she was always 
urging him to become apprentice to a lawyer, or even to take 
up some base mechanical trade. In May 1647, however, Anthony 
matriculated at Merton College ; he was not yet fourteen and a 
half. He notes the Christmas customs, the charcoal fires in 
Hall, the ancient practice of ‘‘ tucking ” new-comers, the mock 
oath administered by the senior cook over an old shoe, the speeches 
delivered by each freshman in turn, standing on a form placed 
on the high table—among which his own speech, if delivered 
as he reports it, must have been a formidable example of pre- 
cocious and pedantic wit.

and kitchin-haunters, who noint their chops every night with greese 
and rob the cook of his fees,” etc. 
If the report be even approximately accurate—and there is 
much more of the same description !—Wood as a boy could have 
been troubled comparatively little with the shyness which 
afflicted him in later years. Undergraduates and their sense 
of humour must have altered if his contemporaries took such 
verbiage in good part. 
Beyond this, Wood seems to have won little distinction at 
College. At the Visitation of 1648 he gave annoyance by his 
evasive answers. But his mother interceded with Sir Nathaniel 
Brent, who had been wont, when she was a little girl, to take her 
on his knee, and Anthony was forgiven, or thought better of his 
audacity—“ otherwise he had infallibly gone to the pot.’’ Brent 
proved a good friend, and, though Thomas Wood, concerned in 
the Royalist plot of 1648, abruptly withdrew himself to Ire- 
land, Edward became a Probationer Fellow of Merton, and 
Anthony was lodged in the College over his brother’s head.? 
In 1650 he was made a Bible Clerk, with very few duties to 
perform, ‘“‘ because the Common Prayer and Sacraments in the 
chapel were put downe.”” He began to take an interest in 
churches and antiquities. He began also to exercise his ‘‘ natural 
and insatiable genie ’’ for music and to learn the violin. He took 
his Bachelor’s degree in 1652. He had an accident, riding, and 
put out his arm. He got anague and tried to drink it off, and was 
advised to try country air and following the plough. He learned 
bell-ringing : all kinds of music were ‘“‘an extraordinary and 
ravishing delight.’”” He began to read regularly in the Public 
Library—‘‘ which he took to be the happiness of his life.” He 
was delighted with Burton’s Description of Leicestershire, and 
set to work to make collections from it. He was fascinated by 
books on heraldry. Heraldry, music, painting took the place 
of other studies—‘“‘ so prevalent was nature, mix’d with a gener- 
osity of mind and a hatred to all that was servile, sneaking, 
or advantagious for lucre sake.” To be strongly set against 
working for one’s living is no rare infirmity of undergraduate 
1 For the speech as given by Wood see Life (I, 139-40). 
2 In 1651 Edward Wood was suspended for excessive hospitality 
and for drinking the King’s health. In the same year Thomas Wood 
died in Ireland (Ib. 166-7, 171),
-P-A-G-E-465

days. He indulged in occasional frolics : but for the call of the 
great Library he might have indulged in them too far. In May 
1655 Edward Wood, only lately appointed a Proctor, died, ‘‘ to 
the great reluctancy of his friends and relations,” and a few 
months later Anthony Wood was admitted, on his twenty-third 
birthday, to his Master’s degree. But he failed to secure a 
Fellowship at Merton ; his want of scholarship, his temperament, 
his political opinions may all have stood in the way. He had 
inherited just enough to live upon, and with this very modest 
competence he set himself to follow his own tastes. 
In March 1656 Anthony Wood made his first adventure in 
the world of letters by editing five of his brother Edward’s 
sermons. Dr. Goddard received the dedication and “a very 
fair copie of them bound in blew Turkey-leather with their leaves 
gilt.” But Wood’s pursuit of literature was still unfixed, when 
suddenly 
“This summer came to Oxon ‘ The Antiquities of Warwickshire,’ 
etc. written by William Dugdale, and adorn’d with many cuts.? 
This being accounted the best book of its kind that hitherto was 
made extant, my pen cannot enough describe how A. Wood’s tender 
affections and insatiable desire of knowledg were ravish’d and melted 
downe by the reading of that book. What by musick and rare books 
that he found in the public library, his life, at this time and after, 
was a perfect Elysium.” 
Fired by this great example, Wood began in the following October 
to survey and transcribe inscriptions and quarterings in the 
churches and chapels of Oxford. In the spring of 1657 he set 
out on a “perambulation of Oxfordshire,” starting with the 
monuments in Wolvercote church. In August he found Leland’s 
manuscripts in the Bodleian—‘‘exceedingly delighted in 
them .. . never weary ’”’—and rambled afield to investigate 
at Dorchester, “startled at his first sight” of what he found. A 
visit to Eynsham in September followed, and from that summer 
onwards his systematic wanderings as an antiquary began. His 
mother’s visits to connections in Oxfordshire gave him fresh 
opportunities of inspecting monuments. In September 1659 
he helped Thomas Barlow, who had succeeded Rouse as Bodley’s 
Librarian—“ a library in himself and the keeper of another ”— 
to sort and arrange the great Selden bequest. Barlow presented 
him with a pair of spectacles found in one of Selden’s books. In 
October he started on the Register of St. Frideswide’s, which he 
was allowed to read at Canon Button’s lodgings. And in July 
1660 Dr. John Wallis, at Bathurst’s intercession, gave him 
keys to the Tower where the Archives of the University were 
kept, and where “ his esurient genie in antiquities ” was to lay the 
1 The first edition, published in 1656,

foundations of his greatest work. He was ‘“‘so exceedingly 
delighted ” and set to work so hard upon the records, that after 
two months his friends declared that his cheeks were fading and 
his body falling away. Nothing troubled him except having 
to waste time in meals and sleep. At last Dr. Wallis, ‘‘ seeing 
his deligence,” gave him leave to take the books and writings 
that he wanted home. 
Wood’s career was now settled. In the family house in 
Merton Street he fitted up two attic chambers for himself. In 
one, looking East, he built a chimney. In the other, his study, 
he “ put out a window next to the street ” ; and there, turning 
his back upon family quarrels, he found a resting-place for years 
to come. The choice had disadvantages. A rash surrender, to 
oblige his brothers, of some reversionary interests in the family 
estate left him too much at the mercy of his brothers’ children 
later. His sister-in-law, Mrs. Robert Wood, who lived down- 
stairs, was not congenial. A “melancholy, malitious, and 
peevish ” woman, he always suspected her of slighting him. His 
brother Kit’s wife proved equally morose—a ‘‘ cold clownish 
woman,” who gave him cold meat and cold receptions. Even 
his mother would think herself neglected if he forgot to tell her 
that there was a University sermon in Merton College, and would 
come beating at his door like a mad woman, calling him a rogue, 
a rascal and a gallows-bird for depriving her of such spiritual 
delights. But from these jars the student could escape. He 
had discovered his real vocation. It grew clearer every day. 
In the little upstairs study in Merton Street, in the Tower of the 
Archives, where Wallis took advantage of his help, in the Bod- 
leian, where Barlow was glad to employ him, and where Barlow’s 
successor, Thomas Lockey, “‘ not understanding the managing 
of a library,” might in Wood’s opinion have listened to him 
more,? among the muniments of the Colleges which, as his tastes 
and abilities became known in Oxford, were made accessible to 
him by College dons, above all among the treasures accumulated 
by Brian Twyne, the young antiquary found resources after his 
own heart. 
Twyne’s great collections opened Wood’s eyes to the possi- 
bilities before him. His ideas widened. He planned a compre- 
hensive survey of the city spread out below the windows of the 
Tower, to include the history of its ecclesiastical foundations 
and of the University and Colleges which crowned them all. 
1 See the incident reported in April 1670 (Life, II, 190). Mrs. Robert 
Wood may have had her provocations. Anthony agreed to pay his 
brother Robert £10 a year for his board in 1663, and £12 in 1664 (Life, 
I, 471). His entire income was probably under {£40 a year (Life, V, 77-8). 
2 See Wood’s criticism on Lockey’s failings as Librarian (Life, I, 335).
-P-A-G-E-467
  THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 4II 
Gradually there emerged from this scheme three great treatises, 
one on the City, its churches, parishes and religious houses, 
another devoted to the University’s annals, to its buildings, its 
officers, its lectures and its Schools, and a third to tell the story 
of the Colleges and Halls.1 On Twyne’s materials the whole 
project probably depended. From one point of view Wood 
may fairly be regarded as a splendid if inadequate editor of 
Twyne. He, no doubt, studied some of Twyne’s originals, and 
he looked up many references in them with untiring care. But 
to others, which he quotes, he seems never to have had access, 
and he repeatedly failed to acknowledge what he owed. On 
some points he drew from Twyne practically every reference 
which he gives. With no consciousness of literary dishonesty, 
and with no grave offence to the literary ethics of his day, 
he appropriated and embodied his predecessor’s work wholesale. 
His sturdy industry, his passion for knowledge, his life-long 
labours and researches are beyond dispute. But if the two 
great antiquaries of seventeenth-century Oxford were to be set 
in comparison with each other, it is to Twyne that students 
of history would have to admit the deeper debt.? 
Those early years of labour must have been the happiest 
of Wood’s life. We have close records of his occupations and 
expenses, intimate details as to how his time was passed. 
“‘May.—The 1 day, S., spent up the water, 1s. 10d.—7, F., to 
Jones for pamphletts, 6d.;... 20, Th., given to old Hern for 
shewing me Ousney, 4d.; for 2 brass peices of coine of yong Paine 
the tinker, 2d.—21, F., for mending of stockings, 6d.—22, S., for 
paper, 11d.; for binding Twin’s Antiq., 8d.;... 28, F., spent att 
the Tavern on Mr. Sayer, 1s.—29, S., for a pair of shoes, 4s.? 
There are constant little payments entered for buying books 
and pamphlets and for treating friends. Civilities to “‘ my coz. 
Elizabeth Stampe ”’ and to other connections figure occasionally. 
Hospitality to Mr. Zephaniah Cresset and to other companions 
figure a good deal. Widow Flexney, Mother Laud, Joan of 
Hedington, the Crown, the Mermaid, account for several items. 
It cost a shilling or more to go to his brother Christopher’s ‘‘ a- 
gossiping,” fourpence to see a play at the Roebuck, sixpence for

the elaborate Fasti—chronological notes on the University’s Magistrates 
and on many recipients of degrees—appended to them as well as to the 
Colleges. There are some 50 odd pages of Fasti also appended to the 
original Latin edition of Wood’s History.

vol, IV, 223-6). For a note on the dispersion of Twyne’s papers see

“dressing a hat.”’ For a shirt ‘‘ 3 ells and a quartern at 8 groats 
an ell” ran up to eight and sixpence. There is a delightful 
miscellany of charges: a history of the Anabaptists costs five- 
pence, a pound of candles or “‘ cherrys and whay ” a little more ; 
“yibband for my stuff suit’’ three shillings and ninepence, 
entertaining friends in Merton College orchard two shillings or 
half-a-crown. One eye is always fixed upon antiquities, the 
other on the small joys or necessities of life. 
Wood’s days were spent in work. He was continually 
reading, writing, making excerpts, for ever exploring bookshops 
for old records, ballads, broadsides, curious lore. But he loved 
also to ramble afield with only a note-book for companionship, 
among the Oxfordshire uplands, the Oxford meadows and 
streams, through Godstow’s “‘ fields of breezy grass,” over ‘“‘ the 
warm green-muffled Cumnor hills”; nor was the charm of these 
rambles lessened if a friend was there to share them, or a friendly 
tavern to provide refreshment by the way. Later there were 
gatherings in the newly-founded Common Room at Merton— 
Wood sometimes got into trouble by making notes of his com- 
panions’ conversation there’—meetings with relations or ac- 
quaintances, gossip in some coffee-house or ale-house, music in 
which he liked well enough to take a part. In the days before 
the Restoration there were weekly meetings of musicians in the 
house of William Ellis, the ejected organist of St. John’s College, 
which brought together the chief performers in Oxford—Dr. 
Wilson, Professor of Music, “ the best at the lute in all England,” 
a Sheldon who played admirably on the viol,a young Wren and 
many another of greater or of lesser note. Thomas Janes of 
Magdalen also had meetings for music in his rooms in College. 
So had Narcissus Marsh, at Exeter and later at St. Alban Hall. 
Dr. Wilkins had concerts at the Lodgings in Wadham, where 
Wood was once made to play the fiddle much against his will. 
But Oxford talent paled before the visitors who appeared occa- 
sionally—Davis Mell from London, who had “‘a prodigious hand”’ 
upon the instrument, and Thomas Baltzar, an outlander from 
Lubeck, the greatest violinist in the world. Wood’s deep interest 
in music never failed him. But his serious studies perhaps grew 
more absorbing, as his taste for general company and his wish 
to shine in it declined. 
Wood developed into a great student, degenerated, it may 
be, into a recluse. But his keen eye and his keener pen noted 
all sides of the life around him. No incident of interest was too 
small. The seizure of Waynflete’s mitre and crozier at Magdalen, 
under a general order of the House of Lords ; the fate of James 
Hind, a famous highwayman, “a little dapper desperat fellow,”

who had served under Buckingham and Ormonde ; the hanging 
of two Cavaliers, ex-officers, who had unhappily adopted the same 
trade ; the strange tale of a junior Fellow of New College, with 
“a curl’d shag-pate,” squint-eyed and purblind, for whose sake 
a handsome maid in Cat Street poisoned herself with rats-bane— 
all found their place in his chronicle. He had stranger stories 
still to tell about Heads of Halls and Colleges like Dr. Iles, Dr. 
Spenser, Dr. Anyan, tales which did ss scruple even to reflect 
upon their wives— 
“Dr. Spencer was a wencher And built for us a new house, 
Dr. Anyan was a drinker And built for us a brew house,”— 
seventeenth-century Corpus was responsible for both. He has a 
more pleasing romance of a young Gentleman Commoner of 
Merton who carried off a young lady of fifteen, married her 
early one morning in the Chapel of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, 
and invited Wood and others to his surreptitious wedding-feast. 
He records the habits of a Christ Church student, son to the 
miller of Oseney, a great eater, who once ate up a pound of candles, 
and whose daily life at Oxford was summed up in two ingenious 
if cryptic lines— 
“Morn, mend hose, stu. Greeke, breakfast, Austen, quoque dinner : 
Afternoone wa, me,, cra, nu., take a cup, quoque supper.’ + 
He has notes on the storms and floods which did damage in 
Oxford—one remarkable storm brought down hail-stones as 
large as walnuts and as flat as fritters, and carried away the 
pans at the fire in the kitchen of All Souls—notes on the purchase 
of books from Dr. Langbaine’s library, notes on the help given 
to Dr. Savage of Balliol in writing the history of that College. 
Jottings of every kind lend colour to his pages and show how wide 
and various his interests were. 
Wood’s judgments on his contemporaries were not less 
observant. But they rarely erred upon the side of kindness, 
and they became tinged more and more with bitterness, as the 
years passed and as his grudge against the world increased. 
Clarendon -he remembered as “a great getter of money, not 
kind to old caveliers.” Dean Fell, though he gave him generous 
encouragement, could not be pardoned for his “ pedantical and 
pedagogical ’’ methods and his gross partiality for Christ Church 
men. Dr. Barlow of Queen’s, who was often very friendly, was 
1 “i.e, in the morning, mend his hose or stockings, study Greeke, 
break his fast, study Austen, then go to dinner ; in the afternoone, walk 
in Ch, Ch, meade, crack nuts, and drink, and then for supper ” (Life, I, 
234). 2 See MS. Wood F. 31 (ff. 1-18). But most of these jottings reappear 
either in the Diary or in the Annals,

  414 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
a turn-coat, always ready to truckle to those in power, a 
“most false, busie, and pragmatical person,” who intervened 
unwarrantably in the affairs of Wood’s own College. Thomas 
Clayton, whose selection as Warden of Merton Barlow is alleged 
to have assisted, was ‘‘ the most impudent fellow in nature to 
adventure upon such a place . . . a most lascivious person, a 
great haunter of women’s company . . . a fellow of little or no 
religion, only for forme-sake.” Ralph Bathurst again had often 
befriended Wood, but the diarist had no mercy on‘his political 
compliances and still less on his wife. Mrs. Bathurst appears as 
a scornful, proud woman, “‘ the widdow of a notorious rumper,”? 
who thought herself fit to govern the College, and evidently 
thought little of Anthony Wood. John Hall, Master of Pem- 
broke in later years, was ‘‘ clownish, covetuous, and quarrel- 
some among the fellowes.” South, the Public Orator, was 
another turn-coat, and pushing and impudent as well. And 
Dr. Wallis, who had given Wood access to the Archives, and had 
then earned his gratitude and respect, became later on in the 
same relentless pages not a time-server only but the basest of 
mankind, a taker of all oaths, faithful or faithless to every change 
of ruler, a “liver by rapine’”’ who thrust out others from their 
places and ate up poor men’s bread.? The grounds of this 
extraordinary onslaught appear afterwards in an ingenuous note : 
“Dr. Wallis took away my keyes.’’ Wood’s pen was his enemy. 
He flew to it to vent his feelings, to register every real or fancied 
slight. It may be that posterity has rendered him a doubtful 
service in printing every record of his passing moods. 
But with this keen sense of his contemporaries’ failings there 
mingled a larger outlook on affairs. For all his strong prejudices 
Wood had a certain breadth of view. He had been of course 
no friend to the Rebellion. He had joined in the petition for the 
removal of the Visitors in 1659. But he seems to have watched 
with comparative detachment the reaction which accompanied 
the Restoration in Oxford. That great change was to a large 
extent the act of the whole nation. The Presbyterians had 
taken a leading part in promoting it. Conant had supported it. 
Reynolds had been to Breda to confer with Charles. It was 
impossible to undo the past or to expel wholesale as intruders 
the Fellows and Scholars appointed since the war. Of the 
Royalists who had suffered at the hands of the Parliament 
comparatively few were in a position to return, Some had 
died. Some had married. Some had joined the Roman Church

politics—his principle of ‘‘a moderate compliance with the powers in 
being ’—and also for criticising his election as Keeper of the Archives,

THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 415 
or had passed on to other callings. But wherever they came 
forward and asked for readmission, there was a natural inclina- 
tion to allow their claims. Parliament at once called on the 
Chancellors of the two Universities to restore the old College 
Statutes and to do justice to all persons “ unjustly put out.” 
Lord Hertford, who had resumed his place as Chancellor of 
Oxford, appointed a Commission to comply with these demands. 
But besides undoubted Royalists like John Oliver and Dolben 
these Visitors included several well-known Oxford men, Barlow 
of Queen’s, Blandford of Wadham, Zouch of St. Alban Hall, 
Clayton and others, who had found it quite possible to serve 
under usurpers. Their appointment caused some ‘‘ discom- 
posure,” and in July 1660 it was apparently thought necessary 
to strengthen their position by fresh appointments from the 
King. Certain influential public men were added to the Com- 
mission, among others Hyde, who was now Lord Chancellor, 
Hertford himself, three Bishops, and two Secretaries of State. 
Hood, Rector of Lincoln, was also made a member. A man of 
little force of character, he yet held a unique position as the only 
existing Head of a College appointed before the Parliamentary 
Visitation, and on that account he was nominated to serve as 
Vice-Chancellor in Conant’s place. At the Visitors’ sittings in 
the Convocation House Dr. Skinner, the restored Bishop of 
Oxford, an old Fellow of Trinity, took a conspicuous part.* 
The reaction had come. Loyalists were freed “ from that 
misery and slavery under which they have longe groaned.”® 
But there was no need, and there would have been no justification, 
for such sweeping changes as were made twelve years before. 
The University as a whole was perfectly ready to submit to the 
authority of the King. The Anglican ritual, prayer-books, 
organs, surplices, naturally returned. In vain were indignities 
heaped upon the surplice. In vain did the Presbyterians mock 
at organs as the whining of pigs or compare the chanting of 
Chapel choirs to choruses sung in a blind ale-house.4 At Christ 
Church Reynolds, who had only just displaced John Owen, had 
to give up the Deanery again. But he was consoled with the

F, 35 (ff. 370-2). 4 Hertford’s Commissioners, it seems, began work at Oriel. But 
they may have felt their authority to be insufficient. They were almost 
all re-appointed together with the new members, but Dolben and Dean 
Croft of Hereford dropped out. Hertford himself, created Duke of 
Somerset, died in Oct. 1660 and was succeeded by Hyde. Hertford 
nominated Hood as Vice-Chancellor on July 28. See Reg. Ta (22) and 
Wood (Amn. II, 699 sq. and Life, I, 318 and 324-7).

Wardenship of Merton!: Goddard’s appointment there was 
quietly ignored. George Morley, who had immediately recovered 
his Canonry, was promoted to be Dean in Reynolds’ place. But 
he passed on within a few months to a Bishopric, and relin- 
quished the Deanery to Fell. Allestree and Dolben came back 
as Canons with their friend. Sanderson returned as Regius 
Professor of Divinity : Conant had to surrender his Chair. Three 
noted Puritans among others, Ralph Button, Henry Wilkinson 
and Christopher Rogers, had to surrender their Canonries. Pococke 
recovered his stall?: his two Readerships he had kept all the 
time. Hammond was dead: he had lived just long enough to 
see Parliament vote the recall of the King. Other changes also 
were made at Christ Church, but it does not seem that a very 
large proportion of the College was renewed.* Of the old Royalist 
Heads excluded by Parliament all the survivors were immediately 
restored. John Oliver resumed his place at Magdalen, on 
Goodwin’s resignation, a week before Charles landed in England. 
Sheldon stepped back into the vacancy which Palmer’s death 
had created at All Souls—for a few months only before he became 
a Bishop. Baylie returned to St. John’s, Hannibal Potter to 
Trinity, Mansell to Jesus. Thankful Owen, Seth Ward and 
Howell had to give way. Thomas Walker returned to Univer- 
sity, bringing Obadiah with him, who, like other devoted King’s 
men, had ‘“‘ wandred a long time up and down.”’ Newlyn and 
Wightwicke had the pleasure of supplanting their supplanters. 
Staunton withdrew from Corpus and Langley from Pembroke, 
by no means to the advantage of the Colleges concerned. Yate 
succeeded Greenwood at Brasenose. For the rest Conant still 
held his place at Exeter. So for the present did Rogers and Wilkin- 
son at New Inn and Magdalen Hall. Barlow was strongly 
entrenched at Queen’s. Hood was safe at Lincoln, with Crewe’s 
astuteness at his elbow. Blandford, the Warden of Wadham, 
and Savage, the Master of Balliol, found no difficulty in moving 
with the times. Blandford, in particular, was prepared to move 
rapidly and far. And Provost Say of Oriel, appointed under the 
Commonwealth, survived all vicissitudes until 1691. 
In the case of other members of the Colleges the changes were 
less noticeable. This was not, as Wood suggests, because the 
Royalists were bent on returning good for evil, but because very

little opposition was encountered and comparatively few sur- 
vivors of the old days wished to be replaced. At some Colleges 
like New College and Corpus one would expect to find a strong 
reaction, and it seems that seven Fellows were restored at Corpus 
and about twice as many at New College.1 At Magdalen the 
Fellows and Demies replaced are put at twenty-five? At All 
Souls the changes were fewer, but enough to show that a new 
day had dawned. At Jesus Mansell’s plan of settlement pro- 
posed that four of the old Fellows should be restored, seven 
new Fellows appointed, and five of the intruders allowed to 
remain. The number of actual ejections that we know of is 
comparatively small. At Lincoln there were five,* but these 
were chiefly due to tension between the Presbyterians, who 
supported Hood, and the Independents who had little liking 
either for Crewe or for the Rector. One Fellow of Lincoln, 
George Hitchcock, held out with fierce determination till force 
was applied. But there is no record of serious trouble elsewhere. 
In some Colleges ejections were more noticeable, though attempts 
were made to provide ejected Fellows with chaplaincies or other 
subordinate posts. In others the expulsions were singularly 
few. At Merton and Trinity, for instance, we hear little or 
nothing of ejections,‘ and in this good fortune they probably did 
not stand alone. Wood’s statement that all those restored, 
including Fellows, Scholars and servants, did not amount to 
the sixth part of those ejected in 1648,5 may not be accepted. 
But he is not wrong in suggesting that the Royal Visitors acted 
with moderation and restraint. Old claims and interests had 
to be considered, but no wholesale policy of proscription was 
enforced. 
But the reaction gathered strength as it went on. In May 
1661 the new Parliament met, ‘‘ a parliament,”’ said its enemies, 
1 Prof. Burrows suggests 15 (Register, 527 sq.), but he only speaks of 
9 expulsions. The notes in his Tables do not profess to be complete. 
He mentions some 86 members of Colleges, apart from Heads, as restored 
in 1660, but only notes a little over 30 expulsions. Yet the vacancies 
and the withdrawals can hardly have been very numerous. He gives 
details of 6 Fellows restored at All Souls: Prof. Grant Robertson puts 
the number there at 5. A few other figures can be drawn from College 
histories, but they are not as complete as one could wish. Nor have I 
found better information in the College papers that I have examined. 
2 Mr, Wilson (Magd. Coll. 176-7) says 17 Fellows and 8 Demies. 
Prof. Burrows’ figures in his Tables are not very different. There may 
have been about the same number of ejections. 
8 See Clark’s History of the College (133) and Wood (Amn, II, 702-3).

ories of their humiliation. A few months later Edward Hyde, 
now Earl of Clarendon and Chancellor of the University, visited 
Oxford, driving in state over Shotover Hill in a coach drawn 
by six Flanders mares, with the gentry of the county riding 
before him. He was entertained for the most part at Magdalen, 
and spent several days in the City, staying at his house at Corn- 
bury in between.1 He presided at a Convocation for conferring 
degrees: the lavish granting of degrees to persons who had 
more Court influence than merit was inevitable on the Restora- 
tion,? and became one of the standing abuses of the time. He 
consulted with Fell. He listened to speeches by South, who 
did not hesitate to put in a word in his own interests. He had 
dinners at Magdalen and St. John’s, at All Souls and Christ 
Church. He is not likely to have noticed one troublesome 
young undergraduate, William Penn, at Christ Church, who 
was to be sent down for Non-conformity that year. He refused 
to dine with Henry Wilkinson at Magdalen Hall, and scolded 
him sharply for his opinions. He accepted a Bible, but took 
occasion to emphasise his attachment to the Prayer-Book too. 
Clarendon was less of a bigot than many of his contemporaries, 
but stronger men than he would have found it difficult to stem 
the flowing tide. In 1662 the Act of Uniformity required 
“unfeigned assent ’’ to the new Prayer-Book, and on St. Bar- 
tholomew’s Day some two thousand Non-conformist Clergy 
went into honourable exile rather than comply. At Oxford 
Conant found it impossible to accept the new arrangements. 
He ceased to be Rector of Exeter, and several Fellows of his 
College retired with him.* Two Heads of Halls, Henry Wilkinson 
and Christopher Rogers, adopted the same course. At Lincoln, 
it seems, three Fellows withdrew, including two elected after 
the Restoration. At Pembroke one Fellow was found to suffer 
for his opinions. Everywhere else apparently the spirit of 
conformity or compromise prevailed. In July 1663 Juxon’s 
funeral gave occasion for another display of Church feeling. 
The Archbishop’s body was brought to Oxford in state, with 
heralds and coaches and sixty mourners riding, and was buried 
1 He was in Oxford on Sept. 7-9, Sept. 17, and Sept. 23-4, 1661

with great solemnity in the Chapel of St. John’s.1. A fortnight 
later the bones of another Archbishop, a still more famous 
son of the College, were brought to the same place from the 
Church of All Hallows near the Tower, and laid at night in the 
vault by Juxon’s side. 
A more august visitor was soon to follow. From the 11th 
September onwards the preparations for the King began, the 
Vice-Chancellor, Blandford of Wadham, and the Mayor of Oxford 
issuing contradictory orders as they pleased. There were 
proposals for gifts—a rich purse of gold for the King and the 
richest pair of gloves that could be made for the Queen.? There 
were proposals for Town Councillors’ gowns, of scarlet and 
“black budg,” with ‘“‘satyn or tabby doublets.” Masters, 
Bachelors and students were to line the way to Christ Church, 
but Wood found the junior scholars in North Gate Street dis- 
orderly and rude. On the 23rd the King and Queen, who had 
dined at Cornbury, rode in from the North, with the Duke and 
Duchess of York. Near the mile-stone * they were welcomed 
by the representatives of University and City. The King 
accepted a Bible and pocketed a purse. The Queen and Duke 
and Duchess had their gloves. The Mayor proferred his mace 
and received it back. It was growing dusk as the procession 
entered the City, constables and Councillors and Bailiffs first, 
then the Chancellor in his coach and six, then Masters of Arts 
riding two and two, and Doctors magnificent in their robes 
behind them, the Vice-Chancellor and Mayor together, the 
Royal personages with their retinue, sergeants, maces, lackeys 
interspersed, and Life Guards and servants bringing up the rear. 
It was dark before the King arrived at Christ Church, and torches 
were needed to light him on his way. Next morning he rose 
early and went into Christ Church meadow to view the relics 
of the war. But he found time to pay a call on Lady Castle- 
maine, who was lodged at Canon Gardiner’s house close by. 
Charles stayed at Christ Church from the 23rd to the 30th 
September,‘ the centre of a loyalty at least as deep and pas- 
sionate as any he had met with in Oxford as a boy. He showed 
himself, as his way was, approachable and gracious, listened 
readily to speeches, enjoyed, no doubt, the popularity that was

speech in doubtful taste (Jb, 480-1).

Life (I, 490 sq.).

so easily acquired. We have no record of his wishing to hear 
disputations, but he visited several of the Colleges, Magdalen 
and All Souls, St. John’s and Wadham, New College and Queen’s.? 
At Magdalen there were fortifications still to be inspected, and 
a reception was held “under the great oke.”’ At Queen’s he 
had to see the Devil’s autograph * and to drink beer out of the 
famous College horn. He contented himself with one sermon, 
at Christ Church, on the Sunday. He touched for the King’s 
evil in the Cathedral Choir, while Monmouth and other gentle- 
men of fashion were receiving degrees in the Schools. He was 
taken through the Bodleian and entertained at ‘‘a very rare 
banquet ” in the Selden end.? He seemed to like even the 
verses spouted at him. A hundred and sixteen lines were re- 
peated kneeling by Thomas Ireland, of Christ Church, who was 
reputed to love pleasure better than his books, and who perhaps 
in that respect resembled his Majesty himself. 
“Tis He, ’tis He indeed, it must be so, 
None but that child into this man could grow.” 
The Christ Church students protested that they owed the King 
their aliment, their dress, their learning; that, taken from 
their parents’ charge, on his munificence they lived at large. 
One would have liked to know their parents’ view. They 
inquired whether the Queen were a star or made of nectar. 
They asked 
“‘ What glorie’s that, that hovers by your side, 
And gives you the embraces of a Bride?” 
And though Lady Castlemaine was always of the party, Charles 
was never at a loss for a reply. At the end of a week, on the 
morning of the 30th, the Royal visitors left amid great accla- 
mations. But Clarendon stayed behind. He summoned Conant 
and Rogers and two other leading Non-conformists ¢ to All Souls. 
He scolded them for keeping conventicles and banished them 
beyond the University limits. There was no place in the Oxford 
1 Others were omitted owing only to “ a great shore of rain.”

coming prevents a Comedy being ready—‘‘ the constant part of a Uni- 
versity entertainment ’—as actors cannot be had out of London (State

of the Restoration for the grave traditions of the last few years. 
Of trivial things men noticed that the courtiers left behind them 
the fashion of whistling in an idle, careless way. 
Two years later, in September 1665, the King came again to 
Oxford, to avoid the plague. He and his brother stayed at 
Christ Church, and the Court and the Government came too. 
The Queen arrived and was lodged at Merton, where there soon 
were more ladies than students in the Chapel. The Duchess of 
York followed, with a much larger train than the Queen. The 
Duke of Monmouth and his wife were lodged at Corpus. The 
Spanish and French Ambassadors found quarters at New College 
and Magdalen. Two little sons of Lady Castlemaine’s 1 had 
rooms in the Woods’ house in Merton Street. Their mother 
was in waiting at Merton, where a homely libel was posted on 
her door, with Latin references only too intelligible to the temper 
of the lady and the frailty of the King.?_ In October Parliament 
sat in the Schools and passed the cruel Five Mile Act, one of the 
worst excesses of Anglican intolerance. In November the 
Courts of Law also held sittings in the Schools. The famous 
Divinity School became a clerks’ office. The Oxford Gazette 
appeared, the oldest English newspaper surviving.? Bishop 
Earle of Salisbury, a lovable survivor of more famous days, 
died at University College, and Dolben preached a funeral 
sermon over him. Blandford of Wadham became Bishop of 
Oxford. Clarendon was still a commanding personage : he had 
brought the Chancellor of Cambridge to visit Oxford a few weeks 
before. The world of politics, intrigue and scandal took posses- 
sion of the University precincts till the King left in January 
1666. The courtiers “ high, proud, insolent,” showed little con- 
sideration for the scholars whom they displaced. Wood testifies 
to their gay apparel, their wretched morals, their ‘‘ very nasty 
and beastly’ ways. After the Court was gone the students 
came back more freely. Their numbers were greater than ever 
because Cambridge was invaded by the plague. 
The diaries of the same shrewd critic give ample evidence 
of the reaction which had swept Puritan ideals aside. “‘ Astrang 
effeminate age,” he comments, ‘‘ when men strive to imitate 
women in their apparell”—with long periwigs, patched and

painted faces, breeches like petticoats, muffs and scented clothes 
—and when women on their part try to dress like men. Even 
into Oxford and among the commoner people “ fals hair, lace 
whisk’’ and similar excesses crept. Gentlemen Commoners 
wore round caps of silk, and even assumed square caps before 
they had earned the right to do so. Professed divines rode about 
with swords and with ‘hats tyed up on one side.” But there 
were worse failings than vanity in dress. It was an age of hard 
drinking, among Heads and Fellows and students alike. At 
Exeter Conant’s successor soon changed the character of the 
College. The Bachelors had frequently to lead him to his Lodg- 
ings drunk.! At St. John’s, described as “‘ most debauched,” 
a little group of undergraduates posed as atheists and made 
a point of coming intoxicated to Chapel. Balliol men “ by 
perpetuall bubbeing’’ made themselves “‘ perfect sots.” All 
Souls was ‘‘a scandalous place,” in the opinion at least of one 
contemporary critic.2 Magdalen and New College were too 
fond of buying and selling places. New College was fond of 
drinking and of gaming too. Pembroke, released from the piety 
of Langley, was accused of being the fittest College “ for brutes.” 
Wightwicke, the Master of Pembroke, and Venn, who became 
Master of Balliol later, spent most of their time “in bibbing 
and smoaking,”’ and they were clearly no solitary types. Masters 
of Arts were seen drunk in the streets, Even an ejected Non- 
conformist Fellow was noticed reeling away from the “ Blew- 
bore.” When a vacancy occurred for the Esquire Bedel of 
Divinity, ‘‘an adorer of the pitcher and pint pot ” carried the 
election—‘‘ by which you may know the genius of the University.” 
Another Esquire Bedel, ‘‘top heavy by drinkeing,” fell off his 
horse and broke his neck. A Proctor made his reputation as 
“‘a known boon blade” of the town. Three Masters of Arts 
from All Souls, having already got drunk at the Mermaid, forced 
their way into the Mitre and literally frightened the hostess 
to death. At Christ Church a Bishop’s son, on the look-out 
for a living, was found dead, clutching a bottle of brandy, 
having been drunk almost every night since his return, At 
Queen’s a “drunken scandalous fellow” is noted as dying of 
the same complaint. Once the Act has to be postponed because 
the Vice-Chancellor is sick with drinking. Van Tromp, coming 
_ 3 In 1666 Maynard, a kindly old scholar, was induced to exchange 
the Rectorship with Arthur Bury for a Canonry of Exeter Cathedral. 
In a Canon apparently his failing could be overlooked, 
8 Humphrey Prideaux, from whose Letters to John Ellis, as well as 
from Wood’s diaries, some of these facts are drawn. Those who doubt 
them may remember that Prideaux was once described, unfairly, as “ an 
unaccurate muddy-headed man.”

to Oxford to be honoured by the authorities and ‘‘ much gazed 
at by the boys,” was completely vanquished in a drinking- 
bout with certain choice spirits of the University headed by 
Dr. Speed of St. John’s. 
For scholars of such abounding joviality the three hundred 
and seventy ale-houses of Oxford were perhaps an inadequate 
supply. In 1679 a Puritan Mayor with different traditions 
openly dissuaded gentlemen from sending their sons to so de- 
bauched a place. Dicing and gambling went with carousing : 
so did easy manners, immorality, loose language, disrespect. 
Stage plays were revived, ‘‘to spite the presbyterians,”” They 
started in the yard of the King’s Arms in Holywell. Women 
began to appear among the players, and ‘ made the scholars 
mad.” Discipline was relaxed all round. On occasions like 
the introduction of new Proctors, the noisy rudeness of the 
undergraduates shocked men brought up in stricter days. The 
Vice-Chancellor’s Court was weak. The old exercises were 
neglected. The Faculties were said to be filled with “‘tosts” 
and “dunces.”’ Even Bodley’s Librarian, Thomas Hyde, the 
Orientalist, was thought at times incapable of understanding 
common-sense in his own language, much less the intricacies of 
any other tongue.1 In College elections abuses were not in- 
frequent. Wood speaks of Yate of Brasenose foisting an in- 
competent kinsman into a Fellowship. He suggests that one 
election at All Souls was decided by much grosser reasons. 
He has ugly tales to tell of Christ Church Chaplains, of the 
spread of license and disease alike in University and town? 
He has no mercy on the coffee-houses.? They exist only to 
waste time and discourage study. He has no patience with their 
gossip or their new way of “ bantering.” They overflow with 
“romantick nonsense, unintelligible gibberish, florishing lyes.” 
His criticisms are sharp enough. His prejudices are unsleeping. 
But he had certainly no bias against the Restoration, and it 
can hardly be doubted that in its main features the darkly 
coloured picture which he paints is true. 
Three familiar figures of this period, Lord Clarendon, Arch- 
bishop Sheldon and Dean Fell, filled a large space in the Oxford 
of Wood’s day. Clarendon’s reign was a comparatively brief 
one. Even when he accompanied the King in 1665, and standing 
on Charles’ right hand harangued the Parliament in Christ 
1 But Prideaux, the author of this criticism (Letters, 133), was a rival 
in Oriental studies, 
2 See Life (II, 3-4, 93-4, 95-6, etc.). ® In 1677 the Vice-Chancellor closed them on Sundays until 5 o’clock.

Church Hall, his popularity was waning. If as a Minister he 
failed in the capacity to govern, if as a returned exile he failed 
to understand the England of his later days, his fall was due 
almost as much to his virtues as to his faults. His old-world 
loyalty, his stubborn churchmanship, his inelastic honesty were 
of little use to Charles, who found him at last impossible to live 
with, “insupportable to myself and all the world.” In the 
University Clarendon was, no doubt, respected and admired. 
But even there he showed traces of tactlessness and harshness 
—no wise man would have banished Conant from Oxford—and 
there is little evidence that he made himself beloved. Yet 
he took a real interest in University affairs, and in men like 
Fell and Sheldon he must have found counsellors after his own 
heart. Clarendon had clear views on education.1_ He did not 
share the opinion urged on the King by Newcastle, a survival 
even among the old Cavaliers, that the Universities and Grammar 
Schools had too many scholars, and that the Grammar Schools 
at any rate should be cut down by one half. He realised some 
of the defects of the Oxford system ; but he urged that the old 
discipline and studies should be restored. He advocated the 
teaching of fencing, dancing, riding: Newcastle’s enthusiasm 
for horsemanship at least he understood. But he valued the 
art of logic, the practice of disputation, the old custom of Latin 
speech. He proposed to revive the acting of Latin and English 
plays. He kept a watchful eye upon the Oxford Schools, recom- 
mended exercises in rhetoric, protested against the neglect of 
matriculation and the promotion of “Idle and Impertinent ” 
men.? The guaestiones chosen for discussion still showed the 
accustomed elements of humour. Whether diseases came from 
Heaven was not inappropriate in a year of plague. Whether 
the Polygamy of the Patriarchs was a sin was a problem fit 
for the courtly divines of the Restoration? Still more pointed 
was the refusal of a Grace to a supplicant accused of saying 
that the candidates for examination appeared to examine the 
Masters rather than to be examined by them.‘ Clarendon’s 
Chancellorship represented not unintelligently the dominant 
feeling of the time. It saw the University’s jurisdiction re- 
established, and the citizens again compelled to accept the obliga- 
tions of Saint Scholastica’s day. It saw better arrange- 
ments made for keeping and cleaning the streets. It saw

the University thanked by Parliament for its loyalty, and for 
the “unparalleled testimony ” of its allegiance in “ refusing to 
submitt to be visited by ye usurped powers.’’? 
Clarendon’s celebrated house in Piccadilly, which gave such 
umbrage to his critics, had a magnificent collection of portraits 
and books. He was himself a master of portraiture, with the 
grand style of the age he lived in. Evelyn praised his generosity 
and freedom. Pepys was “‘mad in love’’ with his eloquence, 
with his ease, authority and wit. Clarendon was all his life 
a man of letters, and his famous History of the troubles which 
he lived through is among the prized possessions of his University 
to-day. It was first published in Oxford in 1702-4. The manu- 
scripts of it were presented in the years which followed. The 
profits of it went to build the Clarendon Printing House, a new 
home for the University Press, where the Chancellor’s statue 
still looks down from a niche over the South door. More than 
a hundred volumes of his correspondence found their way to 
the Bodleian later. His writing-cabinet, with its wafers, quills 
and scissors, was installed there generations after his death.? 
Clarendon’s contemporaries did him less than justice, and it 
is not easy to do him justice even now: for with all his high 
gifts and adventures he remains a somewhat ineffectual figure 
in English history, leaving with us a sense of disappointment 
that he cannot move our interest more. Yet the letter of resig- 
nation, which the fallen Minister wrote to the Vice-Chancellor 
in December 1667, rings with a certain dignity and pathos 
“I desire you, as the last suite I am like to make to you, to 
belieue that I doe not fly my Country for guilt, and how passionately 
soever I am pursued, that I haue not done anything to make the 
University ashamed of me, or to repent the good opinion they had 
once of me.’’# 
And in Oxford at any rate posterity has tried to make amends. 
The Chancellor’s memory lingers in its streets and records. 
His fine and portly presence still inhabits the city which he 
knew so well.¢

with characteristic liberality to help clergymen poorer than 
himself. He was from the first in high favour with the new 
King. In October 1660 he was summoned from All Souls to 
be Bishop of London, and on Juxon’s death he moved to Canter- 
bury, and resumed as Visitor his intimate relations with his 
old College. An ecclesiastic of great practical ability, and a 
firm, uncompromising churchman, Sheldon had not only a strong 
sense of duty but ‘‘a brave high spirit ’’ and a certain largeness 
of view. He could stay steadily at Lambeth during the plague. 
He could rebuke King Charles for his vices. He could even 
protect Non-conformist divines. He gave freely of his wealth 
for public purposes. He contributed magnificently to the 
rebuilding of St. Paul’s, and at Oxford he has left a well-known 
memorial behind. Sheldon was elected Chancellor on Clarendon’s 
withdrawal in December 1667. But he resigned in August 
1669 and recommended the Duke of Ormonde as his successor.! 
The Archbishop, it seems, could never find time to visit Oxford, 
and the chief event of his Chancellorship was the opening in 
his absence of the Theatre which bears his name. 
Strict churchmen had for long disliked the use of St. Mary’s 
for secular purposes. Fell’s views on the subject were well- 
known. The Archbishop shared the Dean’s opinions, and he 
offered first to contribute a thousand pounds towards the cost of 
anew building. Finally he took the whole expense of the Theatre 
on himself and provided an additional fund for its upkeep.2 A 
site was found on the old Town moat, immediately to the North 
of the Divinity School. Houses in Candich were bought and 
pulled down. Christopher Wren acted as architect—still at 
the beginning of his great career: and his bold, sane, practical 
genius produced a building admirably adapted to seat a large 
audience, while his never-failing sense of dignity redeemed the 
elements of clumsiness in his design. Fell took keen interest 
in the work. The fine interior was carefully apportioned. 
Places were assigned for Doctors, Noblemen, Inceptors, for 
Regents and Non-Regents, Bachelors and Commoners, for 
ladies, strangers, Cambridge scholars and “ persons of promis- 
+ He was apparently never installed. Wood notes in Oct, 1668 that 
Fell was readmitted Vice-Chancellor by decrees of the Heads of Houses 
and of Convocation (Life, II, 144). 
2 The fund for upkeep was £2,000, The cost of the building has been 
put at {25,000 by Evelyn (Diary for July 9, 1669) on the authority of 
Wren, at over {16,000 by Wood (Athene, IV, 856), at £15,000 by Dr. 
Clark (Bodl. Guide, 22), But Fell’s accounts as-Treasurer preserved in 
MS, Bod}. 898 (f. 188) give a total of {14,470.11.11, including the fund 
for repairs. The building cost Sheldon £12,239.4.11, and there were 
gold cups for Fell and Wren, fees for Loggan, etc. The Vice-Chancellor’s

cuous quality.” 1 The cellars and some other parts of the build- 
ing were reserved for the Press, which had its home here over 
forty years. Sheldon’s name was inscribed above the lintel. 
Sheldon’s and Ormonde’s statues were set on either side. 
And, to enable academic processions to pass direct between the 
Theatre and the Divinity School, Wren fixed a door-way in 
the splendid window opposite, despising architectural tradition 
as only great men dare. The Theatre was inaugurated with 
elaborate ceremony in July 1669. Wood records “a very 
great and splendid Act,’ with a ‘“‘ vast concourse of people.” 
He speaks of the Duke of York’s players at the Guildhall, of 
scholars pawning their books and their bedding to share in the 
fun, of eighty pounds spent on wine at Brasenose for a single 
dinner. Evelyn was present through the long festivities. He 
noted the tactless eloquence of South. He described the music 
and speeches and disputations of Inceptors. He resented the 
ribaldry of the Terre Filius. And he received, incidentally, a 
Doctor’s degree.? 
John Fell was the natural associate of Clarendon and Sheldon, 
and his influence dominated the University of Charles II’s 
day. Dean of Christ Church for more than a quarter of a cen- 
tury, Bishop of the diocese also from 1675 to 1686, few men 
filled a larger place in Oxford annals. None were more active, 
more high-minded, more indispensable than he. Fell may 
have erred, as Wood suggests, in ‘‘ undertaking too many affairs.” 
He may have been a little too fond of carrying things with a 
high hand. He was not free from the prejudices of the party 
to which he belonged. But his ideals, his piety, his tireless 
sense of duty recalled a nobler age. He made his College a 
power in Oxford, and was accused of undue partiality for Christ 
Church men. He completed its buildings, set Great Tom in 
its tower. He was determined that even the young bloods 
of the House should work. He would visit them in their rooms 
and examine them in their studies. At the New Year he had

for caps and hoods and gowns and sleeves—a more serious 
question in those days than in these—and he warned all tailors 
and haberdashers to observe them at their peril.1_ He revived 
the attendance at lectures and at disputations. He would 
often be present at examinations. He would, if necessary, 
intervene to conduct an examination himself. He stopped the 
practice of coursing and the tumults which it led to2 He 
disliked to see St. Mary’s given up to business and had no small 
share in the foundation of the Theatre. In Convocation, perhaps, 
he showed too little respect for the Masters. The ‘ bibbing 
and pot party of the University ” would sometimes revolt and 
reject his nominees. He was certainly no Puritan. He en- 
couraged plays at Christ Church and gave a supper to the under- 
graduates who acted.? Wood puts down the wantonness which 
followed to the credit of the Dean. But Fell was resolved to 
check drinking and disorder. ‘‘He was continually hauling 
taverns and ale houses.”” Wood suggests that he found there 
chiefly Christ Church men, but adds a tale which is just worth 
recalling. 
“One... Drinkwater, an undergraduat of Exeter College 
with a red face was taken at the taverne by Dr. John Fell, vice- 
chancellor. He asked him his name. ‘ Drinkwater,’ answered he. 
‘Is this a place for you ?’ saith the vice-chancellor. ‘ Who is your 
tutor?’ ‘Mr. Goodall’ (quasi good-ale), replyed he. ‘ Excellent 
and verie ridiculous ; get you home for this time.’”’ ¢ 
One of Fell’s actions as Vice-Chancellor was to secure the 
appointment of a Committee of Convocation to review the Acts 
of the University during the Commonwealth—‘ durante tyran- 
nide Parliamentaria.” 5 Good Royalists could not permit them 
to stand. On the other hand it would not do to go into particu- 
lars, for many Oxford residents enjoyed degrees conferred in 
those nefarious days. So the Committee contented itself with 
a sweeping condemnation of all acts repugnant to loyal subjects 
and scholars, to good fame and public honour. This was in- 
1 For the full regulations and the details in regard to shapes and col- 
ours, buttons, sleeves, etc., see Reg. T (220-3) and Wood (Life, II, 84-5). 
2 The College challenges to each other at disputations often caused 
trouble. ; 
* In 1674 the King asked for leave for actors of the Theatre Royal 
to visit Oxford (State Papers, 1673-5, 278). 
“See Dr. Clark’s note (Wood, Life, I], 83). The names and facts 
were true. Vice-Chancellors in those days often seem to have under- 
taken Proctorial duties.

tutes, 304).

THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 429 
serted in January 1667 at the end of the Register of Convoca- 
tions for the black years 1647 to 1659.1 Fell was not always 
so careful about Registers. One Matriculation Book came into 
his possession on the death of the Bedel who kept it. But the 
Dean knew nothing about it, and light-heartedly suggested that 
the Bedel’s widow, who afterwards married a cook, had torn it 
up ‘‘and put the leaves under pies.” ? 
Fell, in spite of his Conservative opinions, was an active and 
vigorous reformer, and he wore himself out with his work. He 
was conspicuous on all great occasions, in the entertainment of 
the King, the Duke of York, the Prince of Orange, of Clarendon 
and Ormonde, of all foreigners of distinction, and he loved to 
present them with copies of Wood’s History. Among his 
visitors in 1663 was an irrepressible young Scotchman of twenty, 
destined one day to enjoy an English Bishopric, and already 
trained as a divinein Aberdeen.* Fell did his best also to prevent 
scandals and to keep the peace. He admitted the Duchess of 
Cleveland’s eldest son, whom his mother confessed to be ‘‘ a very 
kockish idle boy,” and whom the Christ Church authorities 
thought unlikely to attain ‘‘ the reputation of not being thought 
a fool.” He had, as Wood says, a peculiar faculty in “ training 
up youth of noble extraction.” But courtier though he might 
be, Fell had courage. He refused to honour Titus Oates. In 
days of reaction he was known as a Protestant Bishop. Wood 
even accuses him of giving fanatics perferment. He was uneasy 
probably about King James’ views. Had he lived a year or two 
longer he might have found even his deep loyalty severely 
strained. To scholars Fell showed himself a very generous 
friend. Humphrey Prideaux was largely indebted to his kind- 
ness. Wood for all his grumbling was indebted hardly less. It 
was Fell who secured the publication of the History and Anti- 
1 See Register T (357). One result of an embarrassing situation was 
that the degree-lists of the University, which began to be published in 
1689 did not venture to go back more than thirty years, until the Register 
prepared by the Oxford Historical Society plunged into the untrodden 
ground in 1884 (Wood’s Life, II, 91-2). 
2 Wood ultimately recovered it from Fell’s executors. See his inter- 
esting note on the fate of the University Matriculation Books, and of 
Register PP in particular, during the political changes of the time (Life, 
III, 202-3). 
* William received a Doctor’s degree at Oxford in December 1670.

how foreign Princes should be received (State Papers, 1668-9, 258). 
* E.g. when Lord Norris and Brome Whorwood, the Whig Member 
for the city, quarrelled in March 1682. ‘‘ Broom brought an action of 
battery against my Ld, for beateing him, and my Ld. an action of scan- 
dalum magnatum against Broome for calleing him yong fool” (Prideaux, 
Letters, 127).

Pee Oe Se Ee 
430 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
quities of the University of Oxford in its Latin dress. Wood’s 
original racy English was to remain unknown for a hundred 
years and more. Fell bore the entire charge of printing. He 
gave the author a hundred pounds for his work, and fifty pounds 
more for corrections and additional labour. He paid for the 
translation into Latin by Richard Peers of Christ Church, who 
was then eking out a living by doing exercises for idle scholars, 
and Richard Reeve, the Master of Magdalen College School.* 
The History was published in Latin in 1674. David Loggan’s 
Oxonia Iliustrata with its exact and admirable drawings was 
published as a companion volume next year.? And Fell dis- 
tributed copies of both broadcast. 
It is clear that both Fell and the translators took great pains 
to make Wood’s book complete. But Wood, though he owed 
so much to Fell’s support, and not alittle to the Dean’s suggestions, 
could not forgive either patron or translators for the trouble 
which they gave him or the liberties they took. Fell claimed 
large rights of revision—‘ mangling ’’ Wood called it. He would 
“correct, alter or dash out or put in what he pleased.” Many 
new lines and paragraphs were apparently inserted. Many 
passages of the original disappeared. Mistakes, said Wood, 
were introduced into his text, and his correction of them was 
ignored. Other critics besides Fell interfered. The Master 
of University did not like Wood’s account of the strange dealings 
with the charters of that College. Dr. Bathurst of Trinity did 
not like to hear his predecessor overpraised. Wood had repro- 
duced Harris’ epitaph correctly, but the reference to the old 
President’s celebrity had to come out. Another Head, Iron- 
side of Wadham, had no share in the production ; but he bluntly 
told the author later that the book was full of “ contumelies, 
falsities, contradictions,” and that, had he been Vice-Chancellor, 
instead of printing it, he would have had it burned. It must 
be admitted that Wood was sorely tried. He set to work bravely 
to rewrite his book in English,‘ but, as his nature was, he allowed 
his bitterness to overflow. Fell, he declared, had filled his 
History with “base things . . . to please his partial humour 
and undo the author.” Peers, the arch-villain of the transla- 
tion, was “sullen, dogged, clownish, and perverse”: he had 
myeers afterwards grew fat as a Bedel. Reeve became a Benedictine 
monk, 
* Fell writes to Williamson about Loggan’s “' very fine book ”’ in Jan. 
1679 (State Papers, 1673-5, 537). Loggan, who came originally from 
Danzig, was appointed in 1669 engraver to the University at 20s, a year, 
or, as Wood puts it, “ public sculptor ” (Life, II, 153).

‘ It was edited and published by John Gutch, 1791-6.  
-P-A-G-E-491
THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 431 
altered the text merely to annoy the author and to please the 
Dean. Prideaux suggests that Peers and Wood came to blows 
over the matter—in cook-shops, in the Sheldonian, wherever 
they met. ‘‘ Peers always comeing of with a bloody nose or a 
black eye,” was afraid to go anywhere for fear of meeting his 
antagonist. But presently Peers became Pro-Proctor, and then 
Wood, “‘ although he be a good bowzeing blad,’’ dare not be 
about after nine at night, lest Peers should exercise his authority 
upon him.? 
“‘Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?” 
Wood was, no doubt, a formidable example of the irritable race. 
But it is possible that with greater sympathy and patience the 
Dean, who had given him the opportunity which he longed 
for, might have won a larger measure of his gratitude and 
esteem. 
Fell himself was no mean author. He found time not only 
to govern but to write. He produced lives of Hammond and 
of Allestree. He brought out a great edition of the works of 
Cyprian. He prepared learned editions of Fathers and philoso- 
phers for the Press. The University Press was to him a constant 
source of interest and delight. The Oxford printers had been 
closely associated with the Royal cause, and on the surrender 
of the city to the Parliament they had been superseded by less 
competent men. For a time the Press had suffered severely. 
Its publications had almost ceased in 1649. But, as the Uni- 
versity settled down under the Commonwealth, its activities 
revived. In 1658 the first Architypographer or Controller was 
appointed, as the Laudian Statutes had designed, and Fell threw 
himself into the subject with even more than Laud’s energy 
and force. He established a type-foundry in Oxford in 1667. 
He encouraged the fitting-up of a paper-mill at Wolvercote. He 
settled the printers at the Sheldonian : but the building was not 
very well suited for the purpose, and about 1688 it proved neces- 
sary to move the Learned Press to ‘‘ Tom Pun’s house ’”’ close 
by, and to transplant the Bible Press to ‘‘ Fell’s House ”’ in St. 
Aldate’s.2?, When the agreements with the Stationers’ Company 
lapsed, and the University reclaimed its right to print Bibles 
and Prayer-books, there was inevitably trouble with the London 
printers. They complained to the King of the excessive number 
of presses and the “ Deluge of workmen” at Oxford, They

sical Press (Madan, Oxford Press, Chaps. III and V).

resented the University’s lowering of prices. And a sharp con- 
troversy followed which continued for many years, 
In all these difficulties Fell proved a tower of strength. He 
formed a small syndicate, which took over the management of 
the printing and paid the University a fixed rent.2. He spent 
his own money freely on carrying the project through. He was 
tireless in planning, supervising, even correcting the books which 
the Press produced. Boyle’s treatises on scientific subjects, 
Savage’s Balliofergus, the first of College histories, are examples 
of his many-sided interest. Prideaux gives details of the Dean’s 
publishing schemes—Gildas and other ancient historians, Greek 
Fathers, an English-Latin Dictionary, John Malala’s Chronicle, 
which Fell asked him to edit—‘‘ a horrid musty foolish booke ” 
—a translation of the Secret History of Procopius, an account 
of the Arundel Marbles, a book by Lord Clarendon exposing the 
errors of Hobbes. He tells how certain Fellows of All Souls 
tried to print scandalous engravings when Fell’s back was turned, 
and how the Dean, surprising the miscreants, seized their plates 
and threatened to expel them. Fell was always something of 
an autocrat. He insisted on his own views of spelling. He 
shocked Prideaux by “‘ dealeing in most vile small businesses,” 
by stopping to consider whether things would sell. He liked 
to keep the control of the Press in the hands of his own nominees. 
He bluntly told Obadiah Walker, whom he suspected of wishing 
to print Romanist propaganda, that he “ would part with his 
bed from under him’”’ first. But autocrat as he might be, it 
was the autocracy of a generous and high-minded man. He 
loved whatsoever things were just and pure and lovely and of 
good report. Even critics recognised the greatness of his spirit 
and his devotion to the University he served.‘ 
1 The leases to the Stationers’ Company continued from 1637 to 1642 
and after the Restoration to 1672. Then the University refused to renew, 
and began to print Bibles and Prayer-books, The London printers 
imitated and undersold them. Compromise was tried, and some London 
printers were apparently associated with the Oxford business. The 
struggle continued till after Fell’s death, when the Bible printing was 
again leased to the Stationers’ Co., it seems, in order to end litigation. 
(Madan, Chaps. III and V, and Prideaux, 75 and 79.) References to the 
controversy will be found in MS. Tann. 338 (especially f. 200) and in 
MS. Rawl. A 171 (ff. 26-36), where Wallis summarises the controversy 
in a letter to Pepys. If the entries in Reg. Ta (p. 20) and MS. Tann. 338 
(£. 91) are correct, the date of the first lease granted to Hills and Field 
after the Restoration should be July 7, 1660. But see also MS, Rawl. C 
421 and Reg. Ta (140-2).

but praise for Fell. (Cf. the ed. of 1692, II, 555-64, with Bliss’ ed., IV,

  THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 433 
Fell overshadowed most of his contemporaries, but the 
University, even in the days of its degeneracy, was not without 
distinguished men. Bathurst at Trinity was a considerable 
figure, an influential and successful Head. Jeames at All Souls 
was making a courageous struggle against corruption. Ironside 
of Wadham had force of character and force of tongue ; he may 
or may not have been as “‘ forward, saucy, domineering, impu- 
dent, lascivious,” as Wood, still smarting from an old scolding, 
alleged. Barlow was conspicuous at Queen’s, as successful 
under Charles as he had been under Cromwell: his political 
pliancy secured him a Bishopric in 1675. Crewe, a still more 
notorious time-server, Rector of Lincoln after Hood, became 
Bishop of Oxford in 1671. Obadiah Walker, Master of Univer- 
sity from 1676, was destined to exceed most of his contempor- 
aries in devotion to King James. Narcissus Marsh, with his 
love of discipline and music, ruled for some years successfully 
over St. Alban Hall. Dr. Lamphire, of Hart Hall, even if ‘“‘ much 
given to his pleasures,” as Wood who owed him kindness did 
not fail to note, was a man of public spirit, active in schemes for 
draining and improving the City, and something of an anti- — 
quarian too. He came near to being elected Member for the 
University in 1679.1 Mews, a typical old Cavalier, preserved 
at St. John’s the Royalist tradition, and as a Bishop later on 
he stood by the Magdalen Fellows in their hour of trial. Sir 
Leoline Jenkins, even when drawn into the devious paths of 
statesmanship, represented the University in the House of 
Commons, and never forgot the interests of his old College.* 
And Sir Joseph Williamson, another Secretary of State in days 
when the post required some elasticity of conduct, proved ever 
ready to remember his old friends at Queen’s.? 
The group of brilliant men of science, whom Wilkins had 
gathered about him, passed on in time to London and elsewhere. 
But Robert Boyle published important scientific papers before 
he left Oxford in 1668. Wren could not resist the claims of the 
world, as his noble labours crowded upon him. But he remained 
Savilian Professor till 1673, and the “divine felicity of his 
genius” was ever at the University’s service. The University, 
however, preferred in 1674 to elect Thomas Thynne as its Burgess, 
a “hot head ’”’ in Wood’s judgment, who kept “an open table 
for the Masters for a week or ten dayes and went to the coffee 
houses to court stinking breaths and to the common chambers. 
Sir Christopher Wren was not so expert this way.” Petty in

election of Heneage Finch, the Solicitor-General, instead (Life, II, 442-3).

III, 161-2). 3 See State Papers, 1676-7 (281).

Ireland had shared the downfall of the House of Cromwell. 
But the King soon succumbed to his charm, and his friends of 
the Royal Society in London were kept busy discussing his 
suggestions, if their compeers in Oxford knew him no more. 
Wallis continued to act as Keeper of the Archives, and lived, 
in spite of Wood’s diatribes, to see Queen Anne upon the throne, 
and to contribute powerfully to the cause of science. He was 
buried in St. Mary’s at the age of eighty-six. Seth Ward, de- 
prived of his Headship at Trinity, resigned his work at-Oxford, 
but found a new career and high preferment in the Church. 
Sprat of Wadham also “‘ turned about with the virtuosi,” and 
qualified to be a High Church prelate. But he kept his love of 
science unimpaired. 
Both Wallis and Sprat played their part in current contro- 
versies. It was Sprat who in 1664 addressed to Wren a pungent 
reply to Sorbiére’s observations upon England, which had roused 
attention both in the University and outside. But with the 
Frenchman’s appreciation of Oxford neither Sprat nor others 
had much fault to find. For the critic was prepared to admit 
that the meanest of Oxford Colleges might hold its own with the 
Sorbonne. And he did not fail to absorb and to repeat time- 
honoured legends, like that which made the Brasenose emblem 
a representation of the features of Duns Scotus. Wallis was a 
more formidable controversialist, and Hobbes proved no match 
for him in the sphere of mathematics, though he kept up the 
duel to his ninetieth year, Wood had no more regard for Hobbes 
than he had for Wallis. In one of his sweeping generalisations 
he described him as “‘ an enimy to Universities, school-divinity, 
Aristotle, presbyterians, metaphysics,’”’ though quite acute 
enough to corrupt the gentry of the nation. Unfortunately 
Fell altered to Hobbes’ disadvantage the account of him which 
Wood had inserted in his History, a fact which Wood took care 
that Hobbes should know. Hobbes protested, and was not 
appeased by Fell’s suggestion that at his age he had better be 
thinking of his latter end. He appealed to the King, and printed 
an answer, which set Fell in his turn fretting and fuming.! Fell’s 
conflict with another great philosopher was certainly not of his 
seeking. It was at Oxford during Fell’s administration that 
Locke made Ashley’s acquaintance, and was drawn into the 
path of that unquiet star. But it was not Fell’s fault that Locke 
was made to suffer in the misfortunes which attended Shaftes- 
bury’s friends.? 
The Sheldonian Theatre was not the only new building of

the Restoration. In the days of James I a remarkable man 
named John Tradescant, gardener, naturalist, traveller, collector, 
had been employed by Buckingham “‘ to deal with all merchants 
from all places . . . for all manner of rare beasts, fowls and birds, 
shells and stones.”’ After Buckingham’s death Tradescant had 
entered the service of the King and Queen, and had established a 
famous physic garden and museum in South Lambeth, which 
passed in due course to his son. The younger John Tradescant 
published an account of the curiosities which his father had 
collected—birds and beasts and minerals and insects, a “‘ stuffed 
Dodo ”’ whose head and foot are still at Oxford, and many other 
treasures which excited the wonder of his age. And dying, he 
bequeathed the whole collection, not without some resistance on 
the part of his wife, to his friend Elias Ashmole, a virtuoso then 
high in the favour of the Court. Originally a young lawyer from 
Lichfield, Ashmole had come to Oxford on the King’s business 
during the Civil War. He had established himself at Brasenose, 
He had plunged into the study of astrology, alchemy, antiquities, 
and had ever since proved himself an indefatigable collector, 
tireless in the pursuit of unusual learning. Ashmole had become 
Windsor Herald and historian of the Garter. He was an influ- 
ential man in London. He kept in touch with Oxford friends. 
Wood spent some days with him in 1669, taking him round the 
Colleges and showing him curiosities in the Physic Garden and 
elsewhere. And in 1677 Ashmole offered to present to the Uni- 
versity Tradescant’s museum, enriched by valuable additions 
of his own.? 
The gift was coupled with the requirement that a suitable 
building should be provided. A site was secured immediately 
to the West of the Sheldonian,* and Wren’s boundary wall was 
broken through. But there seems to be no evidence that the 
famous architect of the Sheldonian was even consulted in regard 
to the plans.4 Thomas Wood “ y® Stone-Cutter,”” whose name 
appears with that of other workmen in the Vice-Chancellor’s 
1 Wood speaks of John Tradescant (‘ Tredesken’’) senior being 
appointed by Lord Danby as gardener, perhaps to supervise the plant- 
ing of the Physic Garden at Oxford (Amn. II, 897). Tradescant may 
have advised, but Jacob Bobart was in charge from 1632. 
* Ashmole’s library with its valuable MSS, was bequeathed to the 
University later. But his coins, treasures and printed books were seri- 
ously damaged by fire in 1679 (Wood’s Life, II, 435). 
2 The purchase of “ severall Tenements near y* Theater” is men- 
tioned in the Vice-Chancellor’s Accounts for 1677-1678 (not 1678-79, 
as given in a misprint in Clark’s Life of Wood, IV, 78). But there were 
some payments for ground later, 
‘We have a full contemporary account of the Ashmolean building 
in E. Chamberlayne’s Anglie Notitia (eds. 1684 and 1687). He speaks 
of the striking entrance on the East. Wood, who copied Chamberlayne’s

  436 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
accounts, and who is described as Architect on a contemporary 
print, was mainly responsible for the work done and for the 
materials supplied. The men who built the Divinity School and 
Magdalen Tower, who roofed the stair-way up to Christ Church 
Hall, who planned the colonnade and the garden front of 
St. John’s, had needed no architects to teach them taste. To 
that race, already disappearing, the builder of the Ashmolean 
apparently belonged. He may have had little professional 
training. He may have mingled his styles} and borrowed his 
ideas. But he must have known that his work had no need to 
fear comparison even with that of the great genius close at hand, | 
who has left in Oxford an enduring reputation but not the most 
distinguished examples of his art. In the spring of 1679 * the 
first stone of the first public museum of curiosities in this country 
was laid. In February 1683 Ashmole noted in his diary : “ The, 
last load of my rarities was sent to the barge, and this afternoon 
I relapsed into the gout.”” In March of the same year Robert 
Plot, already Secretary to the Royal Society, and well-known 
for his Natural History of Oxfordshire, for his good stories and his 
love of good fare, was appointed to act as Curator. In May the 
account from the 1687 edition in his MS. F, 31 (f. 141), printed by Clark 
(Wood’s Life, III, 54-6), must have seen this ‘‘ magnificent portal,” And 
it must have formed part of the original design—though there was another 
elaborate entrance on the North, opening to a flight of steps (as shown 
in Williams’ Oxonia Depicta of 1733), where a balcony was inserted later. 
We have also a contemporary print by M. Burghers, dedicated to Timothy 
Halton quater Vicecancellavio, which has the words ‘‘ T. Wood Archit ” 
in the left-hand corner. And we have full details of the expenditure in 
the Accounts in the University Archives (Computus Vice-Canc, 1666-1697), 
which show that Mr. Wood the stone-cutter presented many bills for 
payment from 1679 to 1683, and that Mr. Davis, the University Bailiff, 
received fees, varying from £30 in 1679-80 to £10 in 1682-3, for over- 
seeing the work. There are many entries of payments to workmen— 
to Rawlins for lead-work, to Wild the joiner, Young the smith, etc. There 
isno mention of Wren. Dr. Clark has printed extracts from these accounts 
in his Life of Wood (IV, 78-9) : but once or twice—e.g. in the year 1682-3 
-—he has misread the line and assigned the payment to the wrong work- 
man. The total cost of the building he gives in round figures as £4,530, 
site, structure, fittings and overseer included. Mr. Gunther (Notes and 
Queries for March Io, 1923) puts the total expenditure at some £4,380. 
1 See the interesting correspondence in the Times from Feb, 18 to 
March 9, 1923. The records seem to prove that, except for the balcony 
inserted on the North front later, the Ashmolean was erected between 
1678 and 1684 substantially as it exists to-day. 
* Wood speaks in his diary of the laying of the foundation stone on 
May 15, 1679 (Life, II, 451). Chamberlayne, whom Wood follows in 
his MS. F, 31, gives the date of foundation as April 14. 
* Plot, educated at Magdalen Hall, held various posts and followed 
many paths of knowledge. He has been accused of credulity, time-serving, 
acquisitiveness and bad morals.

THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 437 
Duke and Duchess of York and the Lady Anne were received 
there. They inspected the rarities and enjoyed a banquet. 
They found “‘a large and stately Pile,” with a ‘‘ very magnificent 
portal” on the East, with a Museum above, a Lecture-room in 
the middle, and a Laboratory, ‘‘ perchance one of the most 
beautiful and useful in the world,” below. Ashmole was enter- 
tained by the University later, and made himself responsible 
for further gifts. Portraits of the two Tradescants are preserved 
in the collection. But the treasures which they so industriously 
gathered in their “ Ark” at Lambeth have given immortality 
to another man’s name. 
Close beside the Ashmolean, and freely exposed to the Oxford 
climate, the marbles collected by Selden and by Lord Arundel 
found a place. Those given by Selden’s executors, Wood tells 
us, were first set up in 1660 “on the enbattled walls before 
the Divinity School,” and afterwards on the new walls round 
the Theatre. Those collected by Lord Arundel, the “Father 
of Vertu in England,” were presented to the University in 1667 
by his grandson Lord Henry Howard,? and were disposed about 
a curious monumental structure which now conceals the furnace 
by which the Library is warmed. Selden himself had written 
the first description of the Marmora Arundelliana, and Humphrey 
Prideaux’ Marmora Oxoniensia set a seal on Selden’s work. 
Further to the East, beyond the old town walls, the Physic 
Garden had been growing since Lord Danby, its founder, died 
at Cornbury ‘‘ full of honours, wounds, and daies.”” Nicholas 
Stone’s gate-house ? now gave access to a beautiful domain, 
which was said to contain three thousand several sorts of plants, 
and which served not only for use by physicians but for the 
“delight and pleasure of those of perfect health.” Old Jacob 
Bobart, whom Danby had appointed, watched over it for nearly 
half a century.4 Born in Brunswick, “that great Rum-Brew- 
house of Europe,” he had brought to Oxford a varied experience 
gathered abroad. In his later days he was pleased to wear a 
long beard, “ and once against Whitsontide had a fancy to tagg

it with silver ” 1—a sight which many visitors came to see. In 
1669 Robert Morison was elected Botanical Professor—a Scotch- 
man whom King Charles II had brought over from the Duke of 
Orleans’ gardens at Blois. Morison’s lectures in the Physic 
Garden attracted no little attention at Oxford, and his Historia 
Plantarum Oxoniensis proved to be a landmark in the history 
of botanical research. 
Meanwhile other efforts to beautify the University went on. 
St. Mary’s Church was restored and reopened, with new marbles, 
pinnacles and organ.? Many of the College Chapels were renovated. 
All Souls Chapel was deplorably remodelled. At Brasenose and 
at Edmund Hall new Chapels were built. At University 
the new buildings were completed. At Christ Church Wren’s 
familiar bell-tower crowned the labours of Dean Fell. College 
Common Rooms came into fashion, well-pannelled walls and 
well-carpeted floors. The new Library at Brasenose was 
eclipsed by the new Library at Jesus. Jenkins proved a gener- 
ous friend to his old College. Williamson added a new wing to 
Queen’s. The great Library at Queen’s must have been in 
contemplation, and plans were soon to follow for sweeping the 
medieval College away. At Trinity Wren reluctantly sanctioned 
a new “three legged”’ quadrangle. At New College another 
three-sided quadrangle was begun. At New College and Mag- 
dalen the gardens and grounds were developing in beauty. 
Elms, to form ‘‘a shady walke,”’ were planted between Magdalen 
and the East Gate of the city.2 The waste ground to the East 
of New College, ‘an occasion of stench and noysomness,”’ was 
laid out for building, and Long Wall Street designed. The 
high-way near St. Clement’s Church was “‘ pitched with pebbles.” 
St. Giles’ in part at any rate was paved. The roads beyond 
were still at times unsafe for travellers. Claude Duval, the 
highwayman, was hanged in 1669, and Dr. Pope of Wadham 
wrote his biography. Wood notes, among other incidents of 
that description, the execution of a Major Clancie, a familiar 
figure in Oxford with his red coat and silver buttons and “‘ reddish- 
blew ”’ nose, who had found exceptional opportunities of thieving 
when the Court visited the city in 1665. He notes also that a 
Hyde, once a Fellow of All Souls and a kinsman of the Chancellor,

® Wood (Life, II, 344, 348, 358). Oriel contributed freely about 1661 
and 1664. In 1655 also there had been work done in the Church (Jd. IV, 
63 and 65).

because planted in the fanatick times” (Ib. II, 479).

took to the same ways and suffered the same fate.1 But if 
highwaymen survived, the beggars, who ‘‘used to pray at folks’ 
doore for'almes,” had been discouraged by the Commonwealth, 
and by the year 1670 they had disappeared.? 
In spite of the perils of the roads, however, travelling im- 
proved. In 1669 flying coaches were set up, which performed 
the journey from Oxford to London in a single summer’s day. 
The University carriers had to fight for their monopoly. But 
the old University customs for the most part continued, and 
many of the old University disorders. Terre Filit who abused 
their privileges had to be expelled. Masters in Convocation 
sometimes proved refractory and mutinous, especially if the 
Vice-Chancellor strained his authority too far. A few old 
practices, not always desirable ones, fell into disuse. ‘‘ Cours- 
ing” at disputations was abolished. The Collectors’ enter- 
tainment on Egg Saturday ceased. The examinations needed 
reforming. Bathurst exerted himself, when Vice-Chancellor, 
to improve the system of translating Englishand Greek into 
Latin. ‘‘The Master seems ofttimes more satisfyed with his 
owne question than carefull of the scholar’s answer.” 5 Wood 
complained that ‘‘ noblemen’s sons are created Artium Magistri 
for nothing; get fellowships and canonries for nothing, and 
deprive others more deserving of their bread.” Bachelors 
neglected to determine, and in 1675 a new Statute required 
them to give security to do so in the following Lent.* Scholars 
neglected Austins. Masters of the Schools permitted themselves 
to lapse from Latin into English. Negligence was not new, but 
it seemed to be increasing. The younger generation had its 
own standards of comfort, but in other respects its standards 
suffered in comparison with those of the age that was past. 
Even before the publication of the History and Antiquities 
in 1674, Wood had won for himself a reputation in Oxford. 
He has left a delightful description of a journey which he took 
to London to consult authorities in 1667, when he made friends

days, continued apparently to run. 
¢ Wood notes in 1670 that the Chancellor (Ormonde) desired “ the 
Vesper supper to be paid by the inceptors of each facultie and not by the 
senior, as hath hitherto been” (Life, II, 194). As already noted (ante, 
Pp. 340, n.) an addition to the Statutes to that effect was passed.

with Obadiah Walker in the coach. He carried introductions 
from Barlow to Dugdale, whom he found in Ashmole’s rooms 
in the Temple. Dugdale gave him a letter to Sir John Cotton, 
and Wood, posting off at once to Westminster, discovered Cotton 
practising the lute. But he secured access to Cotton’s famous 
library, where he would afterwards spend two or three weeks 
together in Vacation time, working for nine hoursaday. Another 
introduction, from the Provost of Oriel, gave him access to 
Prynne, then Keeper of the Records in the Tower ; and Prynne, 
in a “‘ black taffaty-cloak edg’d with black lace at the bottom,” 
and full of ‘old fashion complements, such as were used in the 
raigne of K. Jam. I.,” took him to the Tower, across the ruins 
of the devastated city, showed him the great store of rolls and 
charters, told him how to find them and where to sit and write. 
There he worked, with Dugdale beside him. He spent most 
of his time in Dugdale’s company while he stayed in town. At 
twelve every day the two great students dined together at a 
cook’s house in the precincts, and enjoyed themselves in each 
other’s society as antiquaries should. 
Two years later Wood was sent up to attend the Duke of 
Ormonde’s installation as Chancellor. He was introduced by 
Dr. Fell to the Archbishop, and found himself dining at Lam- 
beth ‘‘ exceedingly caress’d.”” But he did not like the trouble 
which the Press Delegates gave him to “ unravel” his History 
and “‘ make it fit for a Latin translation.” He did not wish to 
introduce biographies of famous writers. He objected to the 
additional journeys to London which this involved. Later 
again he tells us how Sir Leoline Jenkins took him once more 
to Lambeth and showed the Archbishop some of the proofs 
of his book.1 But the method of publication brought its dis- 
appointments with it. Wood’s over-sensitive importance, his 
anxious jealousy grew worse. His income was still very small 
and taxation pressed upon him. He resented the Poll-tax of 
1666, and appealed in vain against his assessment. He thought 
that, had the University members done their duty, the University 
might have been saved from paying chimney money—‘“ which 
was never knowne before.” 2 His deafness was already trouble- 
some: his notes on his own ailments are detailed. Family 
jars became more serious : he was blamed for surliness: he was 
1 Another Sheldon, Ralph Sheldon of Weston Park in Warwickshire, 
proved of more use to Wood than the Archbishop. Wood paid him 
long visits, catalogued his library, and received presents in return, There 
are many references to him in the diaries. (See especially Life, III, 
98-105.) 
2 Wood notes in February 1662—‘ Every chimney in every college 
and hall pays 2s. per annum,” additional revenue to the King (Life, I, 431). 
 
-P-A-G-E-501
THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 441 
scolded by his friends. There is a rather pathetic entry in the 
diary in June 1669: 
“A. W. was dismist from his usual and constant diet, which 
for many yeares he had taken in the house where he was borne, and 
then lived, by the rudeness and barbarity of a brutish woman, of 
which she afterwards repented, when too late. A. W. was put to 
his shifts, a great deale of trouble, and knew not what to doe... . 
He was asham’d to go to a publick house, because he was a senior 
master, and because his relations lived in Oxon: and to go to Merton 
Coll. (which he had left, as to his diet, for several yeares before) he 
was much resoly’d in himself against it. He had a name in the 
buttery-book there, and took bread and beere, when he could go no 
where else for meat. By his much fasting, and drinking more than 
usually, the whole course of his body was chang’d. Weakness came 
into several of his joynts, especially in the leggs, and great noises 
in his eares.... This disaster A. W. look’d upon as the first and 
greatest misery of his life.” 
There is an entry, perhaps more pathetic, in 1683, which records 
apparently his unsuccessful wooing : 
‘From 25 Oct. I discern’d a decay of love and she grew worse 
and worse. I waited for a returne but found none, so at the Con- 
version of Paul Jan. 25 I left her.” 
And with that curt entry his dreams passed away. 
Wood’s loneliness increased. But his industry remained as 
remarkable as ever. He became more and more wrapped up 
in his books. When the Latin History with its objectionable 
corrections had been issued, he set to work to rewrite an English 
version, destined to remain unpublished until 1792. His treatise 
on the City of Oxford also remained in manuscript, till it found 
an incompetent editor, Sir John Peshall, in 1773: but Wood 
continued to add to it and improve it while he lived. The 
History of the Colleges and Halls remained in manuscript till 
1786. Wood never ceased to amass notes and information. 
He made large collections for a history of Merton. And in his 
later years he devoted himself steadily to the idea which Dean 
Fell had suggested to him, of preparing a biographical dictionary 
of Oxford writers and Bishops. This, under the name of Athene 
Oxonienses, found a publisher in London during his lifetime in 
1691 and 1692.1 For this great enterprise he collected materials 
unwearyingly. He sought assistance and received it upon every

side. Ashmole and Sir Thomas Browne were among those who 
sent him information. Andrew Allam of Edmund Hall, who 
died of small-pox prematurely—‘‘ nothing but years and ex- 
perience were wanting to make him a complete walking library ’’— 
and White Kennet, tlie historian, who was Allam’s pupil, supplied 
him constantly with notes. John Aubrey, whom he knew 
first ‘‘in a sparkish garb . . . with his man and two horses,” 
and afterwards as reduced to “‘a very sorry condition” but 
obstinately cheerful still, was keenly interested and anxious 
to help. Aubrey’s genius for collecting lively details and his 
willingness to impart them must have been of the greatest 
possible service. But an unfortunate note of his reflecting 
upon Clarendon involved Wood in troubles which he never 
forgave. Wood was not too generous in acknowledging such 
assistance, and his comments on this genial coadjutor show 
him in no favourable light. ‘‘ He was a shiftless person,” he 
pronounces, “roving and magotie-headed, and somtimes little 
better than crased. And being exceedingly credulous, would 
stuff his many letters sent to A. W. with fooleries, and mis- 
informations, which would somtimes guid him into the paths 
of errour.” 
One of Wood’s friends and correspondents, an antiquary 
less famous but hardly less industrious than he, has left in 
manuscript in an Oxford Library a whole volume of Wood’s 
letters.2 William Fulman, the son of a carpenter at Penshurst, 
sent to Oxford by the kindness of Henry Hammond, had secured 
a Corpus Scholarship in 1647, only to lose it, like other good 
Royalists and churchmen in the succeeding year. But after 
the Restoration Fulman returned to Corpus. He obtained a 
Fellowship and finally a College living, and he set to work, as 
“a severe student,” to edit among other labours the works of 
his old patron Hammond and the so-called works of Charles I. 
Burnet, with whom he had a difference of opinion, found in him 
‘an odd strain of sourness,” which others sometimes found in 
Wood. But Wood seems to have appreciated his learning and 
his modesty, and there are no signs of sourness in the letters 
gathered here. From 1672 for some fourteen years onwards 
we have communications passing on all sorts of subjects, and 
History of the Colleges, then the Fasti appended to them, and finally 
the Annals of the University in their English dress, must be remembered. 
Philip Bliss’ four-volumed edition of the Athene@ (1813-20), with the 
two portions of Fasti appended to them, remains the standard edition, 
to which I have generally referred. 
1 There are many references to Allam in Wood’s diaries. (See especi- 
ally Dr. Clark’s note, Life, III, 167.) 
2 See vol. XVI of Fulman’s MS. Collections at Corpus, in which there 
are 57 letters from Anthony Wood.

there is something pleasantly familiar and courteous in Wood’s 
tone. 
November 1672. ‘‘ Mr. Fulman. 
I have read my papers and y* corrections 
of them for wh. I heartily thank yo.... 
yr humble servant AV.” 
October 1673. “I find John Hales was elected probat. Fellow 
2. Sept. 1605.” 
December 1676. ‘‘I am informed y* one Dr, Brady of Cambridge? 
is picking holes in my coat and will answer my 
book, If yo know anything of him lets have 
his character.”’ 
Mayday 1678. “ This last munday I returned to Ox6n and found 
y? letter of the 11 Apr. for wh. I thank yo and 
especially for the memoire of convocation 
therein: ‘tis my great unhappiness y* in my 
absence, not one pson (and I beleive I speak 
truth) in this Universitie, doth comit to writing 
any such thing, as of greater moment, y* is 
: done therein.” 
August 1678. ‘‘ Dr. Hinton parson of Islip is dead and Dr. South 
succeeds there—so y*the y* hath enough shall 
have more.” 
March 1680. ‘‘I am so much taken up with ‘ drudgery’ for 
other persons y* I cannot do anything for my 
Self.” 
August 1681. ‘‘ I have recd. my books fro yo for wh. I thank yo. 
yo know yo may have them at any time againe 
or any thinge else.” 
November 1686. ‘‘I send some newsletters for you to keep till it 
suits you to return them.... I have bar- 
gained w. a Coffey woman for y* sake and 
partly for mine own.” 
The letters are full of personal interest. Mr. Sheldon wanted 
to carry Wood off for a visit. But there were no books in his 
house to read. Wood would rather meet Fulman “at the 
blew boare about 9 or ro in the morn.’”’ There are a few notes 
on politics. The French Court was mourning for the death of 
Condé. The Turks had got provisions into Buda and the 
Christians had had to raise the siege. A speech by Shaftesbury 
was worth reading, if only to see what ‘“‘a rascally humour 
he hath.” The Duke of Monmouth had supped with the Lord 
Mayor. But about books and men, about Wood’s work and 
occupations, there are many more intimate details. The Bishop 
of Hereford had published a work on Naked Truth. Parkinson 
of Lincoln was to be expelled for his defence of Milton. Wood 
wanted to see a Life of Ludovic Vives, to borrow the Life of 
1 Dr. Robert Brady, Master of Caius College, was a historian as well 
as a physician, and is stated to have been at one time Keeper of the 
Records in the Tower (D.N.B.).

Cardinal Pole. He had queries to make about Dudley, Duke 
of Northumberland. He needed information about Carew 
Ralegh and his books. He begged Fulman to note any faults 
he found “‘ on a separate paper.” He sought and received cor- 
rections in good temper. There is nothing to mar this inter- 
change of friendly services between two learned and distinguished 
men. 
As time went on, the course of politics made Wood’s life 
harder than before. The growing discontent with the King’s 
misgovernment, the growing distrust of his religious professions, 
had its reactions in Oxford. The Church had triumphed over 
the Non-conformists, but the nation at heart was Protestant 
still. As early as November 1666 Wood, who certainly was no 
fanatic, entered in his diary—‘“ Papists at this time very insolent 
in most parts of the nation.”’ In 1673 Charles’ Declaration of 
Indulgence had to be withdrawn within a year of its issue. 
But the Non-conformist preachers had revived in Broken Hays, 
and Bishop Crewe, advising James to attend the services of the 
Church of England, was frankly told that the Duke “could 
not dissemble with God and man any longer.” In 1675 Andrew 
Marvell, Member for Hull, drafted a mock King’s Speech for 
the meeting of Parliament, in which Charles was made to tell 
his faithful Commons that he had converted all his natural 
sons from Popery, and that, whatever supplies they granted 
him, he would still ‘‘take care to want.” Three years later the 
unlovely scandal of the Popish Plot startled the nation. Poli- 
ticians like Danby and Shaftesbury lent themselves to the scare. 
Even Charles bowed to the storm, and in Oxford the Vice- 
Chancellor, John Nicholas, bent readily before it. He ‘‘ did not 
care,” says Wood characteristically, ‘‘ whome he took, brought 
into danger, or hangd, so he curried favour with the parliament 
for promotion.” In City and University alike preparations 
were made for defence. Dr. Hall of Pembroke preached against 
the Papists. A ‘‘ world of pamphlets’? appeared. Barlow, 
now a Bishop but always in the fashion, brought out a book 
on the popular side. The Pope was burned in effigy at Edmund 
Hall. The Whigs in Oxford showed their colours. The Master 
of University, Obadiah Walker, and the Principals of New Inn 
Hall and St. Mary’s were charged with being Romanists. The 
Heads of Houses were called on to make a return of all persons 
in their Societies suspected of the same opinions. Clayton, 
the Warden of Merton, ill-naturedly sent in Wood’s name. 
1 But it must be admitted that in Wood’s Diary there shows a less agree- 
ae tone: e.g. 23 April 1685—“‘ Mr. Fulm. in towne ; did not come to see 
. . Never gave me thanks for the letters T sent to him. 
Published a book, I never knew it,” etc, (Life, III, 139).
-P-A-G-E-505
THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 445 
Wood had already incurred suspicion. He had Romanist 
friends, Walker and Ralph Sheldon among them.1 He would 
not receive the Sacrament in Merton Chapel—largely, it seems, 
through perversity, because his friends urged him to put a stop 
to rumours of the kind. People began to avoid his company : 
any man “that is studious and reserved,” he complains, “is 
popishly affected.” His rooms were searched by the Vice- 
Chancellor, and in private he consented to take the oaths of 
supremacy and allegiance. But he would do nothing publicly 
to vindicate himself, though there is sufficient evidence that he 
remained a churchman.? The storm increased. A new Parlia- 
ment met. Danby was sent to the Tower. The Exclusion 
Bill was introduced. But within a few months Charles had dis- 
solved the new Parliament, and had faced the rising anger of 
the Opposition. The King was at his coolest when they tried 
to brow-beat him. ‘I will never forsake my friends, as my 
Father did,’”’ he said. His sudden illness rallied the loyalty of 
the nation, and reminded them of the prospect before them if 
he died. Monmouth’s pretensions offended sober people. The 
madness of the Popish scare abated. The tide began to turn. 
Again the Opposition swept the country. Again Charles faced 
it, waited for his opportunity and then suddenly dissolved. 
But the Exclusion Bill had now been defeated: Halifax and 
the Peers had rallied to his side. For once the King was right, 
and he was slowly winning, though men talked of Civil War. 
Another Parliament was summoned, to meet at Oxford: in 
the City of London Shaftesbury was dangerously strong. 
Again Shaftesbury’s followers carried the elections. Mem- 
bers came to Oxford armed, with trains of followers behind them. 
Well might the older generation in the University recall the 
memories of forty years before. 
The new session was opened on Monday the 21st March 
168x. The King was at Christ Church. The House of Lords 
sat in the Geometry School, the Commons in the Convocation 
House—rather crowded quarters—as Wren, the Surveyor- 
General, had arranged.¢ Since January the University had been 
1 “Now Mr. Sheldon being a zealous Papist, and A. W. afterwards 
being often in his company, must be esteem’d a Papist also, as he was by 
many sniveling saints, who make it a most horrible thing to be seen in the 
company of any one of them” (Ib, II, 228). 
2 See his Life (III, 497 sq.) and Hearne (Collections, O.H.S., I, 7 and 
112-13), It is impossible to read Wood’s diary in the days of James II 
and to believe that he was a Romanist at heart. 
® Among comparatively recent books Mr. John Pollock’s volume on 
The Popish Plot is well worth study. 
4 These details are taken largely from Wood’s Narrative in his MS. D. 
19 (3), which Dr, Clark prints (Life, II, 522 sq.).

preparing. The King had dispensed as far as possible with the 
attendance of the students, and they had ‘“‘ packed away apace.” 
Christ Church, Merton and Corpus had been put at the disposal 
of the Court. Early in February Buckingham had arrived to 
influence the election for the City. He had been escorted over 
Magdalen Bridge by torchlight, and had taken up his quarters 
with the local Whig leader, Alderman Wright. The Whigs 
had carried the town, but for the University Jenkins and his 
colleague had been returned unopposed. Young White Kennet, 
then a Tory undergraduate of Edmund Hall, and destined later 
to be a Whig Bishop, had published anonymously A Letter from 
a Student at Oxford, which, had the Parliament lasted, would 
probably have brought down Whig vengeance on his head. 
On the 14th March the King and Queen had entered Oxford 
in state, received by the Lord-Lieutenant and the loyal gentry 
of the county, and welcomed with such shouts and acclamations 
that the clouds were divided and the rain driven back. 
“The throng and violence of people to express their affections 
were such that the coach was scarse able to pass, The youths were 
all on fire, and when love and joy are mixed, cannot but follow rude- 
ness and boysterousness, Their hats did continually fly, and seri- 
ouslie had you been there, you would have thought that they would 
have thrown away their verie heads and leggs, Here was an arme 
for joy flung out of joynt and there a legge displaced, but by what 
art they can find their way back let the R.S, tell you.” ? 
Gushing speeches had been delivered.* Charles had visited the 
Schools “ incognito,’ had inspected the Theatre, the Library 
and the buildings round, the curiosities of the anatomists, the 
“exact effigies” of his grandfather on the Tower. Crewe, now 
Bishop of Durham, had preached before him. A list of “all 
vendibles for the belly of man and horse” had been “ stuck 
up in public places’”—the best beef and mutton threepence 
a pound, eggs six for twopence, “a fat pigg, the best in the 
market,’ two shillings and sixpence. The townsmen were 
asking exorbitant rents. Shaftesbury was staying at Balliol. 
Monmouth was preparing an effective entry.? The Whigs were 
counting on another triumph. They knew the King’s urgent 
need of supply, the unpaid salaries, the shortage of stores and 
of guns, They did not know that Charles at the critical moment 
had outwitted them by a bargain with his cousin, and that the

* He arrived with some 30 attendants on March 22; his last visit 
to Oxford had been to race in Port Meadow six months before. But 
though he was welcomed by the Whigs in the town, the University took 
little notice of him (Ib. 496 and 531).
-P-A-G-E-507
THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 447 
French King’s subsidy had already guaranteed him the inde- 
pendence he required. 
The King’s Speech was firm. He would not alter the suc- 
cession, though he would consider any means suggested to keep 
the government in Protestant hands. But the Whigs would 
have ‘‘all or nothing.” Party feeling blinded them to their 
mistake. Even Shaftesbury pressed Charles to declare Mon- 
mouth his successor. The Exclusion Bill was introduced again. 
For a few days Charles played with the Opposition. He would 
not lose his temper, but on the main point he would not yield 
an inch. The House of Commons found itself overcrowded in 
the Convocation House. Charles was only anxious for their 
comfort. He had the Sheldonian Theatre prepared for their 
reception. He himself supervised the plans. But, before they 
could move into it, a secret Council was held at Merton on 
Sunday the 27th March. During the night the Royal coaches 
were sent out of Oxford under guard. On Monday morning the 
King was carried in a sedan-chair to the Lords, his robes, neces- 
sary for the formal dissolution of Parliament, following in another 
closed sedan behind.1 He immediately sent for the Commons 
to join him, and they were soon crowding into the quadrangle 
below. But they were only allowed access to the Geometry

a small number could have struggled up and made their way 
into the room above, in time to see the Speaker standing, with 
a Russell and a Cavendish on either hand, and to hear the curt 
words, which nobody expected, by which the Parliament was 
summarily dissolved. Charles enjoyed the consternation which 
his stroke created. His eyes danced with amusement as he 
noted his enemies’ dismay. Early in the afternoon he left 
for Windsor. The Whigs were ruined. Charles never met a 
Parliament again. 
The reaction which followed had its echoes in Oxford. In 
June 168r old Lady Lovelace, a notable Whig, was dragged 
from her coach by a party of young Christ Church bloods who

the scene in detail. Wood says nothing of the place of meeting, nor does

had been drinking at the Crown—‘‘ the Bishop (Dr. Fell) ex- 
tremely troubled at it.” Two or three months later Stephen 
College, a Whig firebrand, who had been already tried and 
acquitted in London, was retried at Oxford, condemned and 
hanged. Fell is said to have sent Dr. Marshall of Lincoln 
College to visit him in prison. Tory sheriffs were returning 
Tory juries. The charters of London and other Whig corpora- 
tions were attacked. Oxford, warned that her charter was 
in danger, sent the Mayor and citizens to appear in full numbers 
on St. Scholastica’s Day in 1682. But the old Town and Gown 
jealousies were by no means extinguished. Had not the Uni- 
versity been Tory, the City would probably have been less 
vehemently Whig. Scholars and citizens drank at the Magpie 
to the Duke of York and the Duke of Monmouth, and very 
soon after came to blows in the street. The Pro-Proctor, 
Charlett, carried off a townsman to the Castle. The mob 
followed and the Pro-Proctor had to be rescued by the Vice- 
Chancellor with a posse of Jesus men.’ All over the country 
the Whigs were going under. Monmouth was arrested. Shaftes- 
bury fled. On the 21st July 1683 Lord Russell died on the 
scaffold. On the same day Convocation in Oxford issued a 
sweeping decree, denouncing ‘‘certain pernicious books and 
damnable doctrines destructive to the sacred persons of princes.” 
All Readers and tutors were called on to instruct their scholars 
in the doctrine of passive obedience, ‘“ which in a manner is 
the badge and character of the church of England.’ The books 
condemned were burned in the Schools’ Quadrangle, Doctors, 
Masters and scholars standing round. Hobbes and Baxter, 
John Owen, Milton, Knox, Buchanan were among the dangerous 
authors cast into the flames.2 Parkinson, a Fellow of Lincoln, 
was expelled for his seditious and scurrilous notions : 
“‘Since the University has in public censured and condemned 
several dangerous and wicked positions, how can the same be per- 
mitted to take sanctuary in private colleges, or shall any one who 
has notoriously abetted any of them be quietly indulged therein or 
allowed the opportunity of poysoning others if he please?” * 
Alderman Wright was brought to trial. The City surrendered

1676-7 there had been trouble with a certain chandler, Philip Dodwell, 
who beat one Proctor and insulted another (Ib.II, 381). 
2 See the list of authors given by Wood (Jb. III, 63-4), Wilkins’ 
Concilia (IV, 610 sq.), and the Somers Tracts (VIII, 420-24). The proposi- 
tions condemned included the doctrines that civil authority was derived 
from the people, that wicked Kings might be put to death, and that 
Dominion was founded in grace.

its charter on Lord Abingdon’s advice, and received it back 
again by Lord Abingdon’s mediation.1 Conduits ran claret, 
and sycophantic poets made verses in honour of the day. Mean- 
while the Duke of York visited Oxford. The Ashmolean Museum 
was formally opened, and the Philosophical Society of scientific 
students was organised to meet on Tuesday afternoons.? James’ 
appearance was the signal for a loyalist demonstration. All 
the Colleges were visited in turn, ‘‘except Pembroke, who 
had no chappell.” At Christ Church “the yong earl of Clan- 
cartie, aged 13, a cannon-commoner,”’ recited a copy of verses. 
At Queen’s Theobald Churchill, whose brother and sister were 
bound to James by closer ties, took part in the welcome to the 
Prince. The Tory gentlemen of the district gathered about 
him. James, so long “ vilified and abused and scandalized,” 
had at last in Oxford come into his own. 
Power as well as popularity was now within his grasp. The 
Duchess of Portsmouth still ruled the King of England with an 
empire which even Barbara Villiers had never enjoyed. But 
Charles’ health was undermined, though he sauntered through 
life as pleasantly as ever. On Monday the 2nd February 1685 
the news of his sudden illness spread consternation in the country. 
On Thursday the 5th he was thought to be recovering, and the 
Vice-Chancellor issued a prayer of thanksgiving “ for the deliver- 
ance lately granted to our Sovereign Lord the King, whom 
in thy unspeakeable love to this Church and Nation, thou hast 
brought back from the gates of death.” On the Friday, “ just 
at high water and full moon at noon,” Charles died. Dying, he 
had confessed to Huddleston, the Roman priest who had been his 
friend since Worcester. James had at least one advantage 
over his brother, that even to save his inheritance he would not 
conceal his faith. But the new King was, unhappily, deter- 
mined not to allow his people to keep theirs. In no part of his 
kingdom had he more devoted subjects than in the University 
which had so lately received him with affection. College bonfires 
blazed in the quadrangles, and dons knelt round them drinking 
his Majesty’s health. The Vice-Chancellor and Doctors, intro- 
duced by Jenkins, presented a loyal address. Latin verses were 
published, and many good scholars, whose verses were rejected, 
printed them under the title of Musae repudiatae, ‘‘ Muses kickt 
downestaires.”’ The outbreak of Monmouth’s rebellion in June 
was the signal for fresh displays of loyalty. The University

raised a troop of horse and a regiment of foot for the King. 
Students trained on the bowling green at New College. They 
drilled in the quadrangles of Christ Church and All Souls. They 
drank deep to the cause they defended and came home from 
dining with the Earl of Abingdon “ well fuz’d.” 
But at Oxford, as elsewhere, the course of politics soon 
gave cause for alarm. The Chancellor, Ormonde, one of the 
noblest gentlemen of his generation, returned from his govern- 
ment in Ireland—he had visited the University with some 
ceremonial on his way there a few years before *—to find himself 
obliged to oppose the King’s dispensing power. A standing 
army, with Roman Catholic officers, was formed. Parliament, 
demanding the removal of these officers, found itself suddenly 
prorogued, and Lord Abingdon’s brothers, who had joined in 
the protest, lost their commissions. The Bishop of London 
was dismissed from the Privy Council. Even University digni- 
taries came under suspicion. In March 1686 Obadiah Walker 
declared himself a Roman Catholic. In Wood’s opinion Walker 
had in Oxford only three disciples and a half; the half was 
John Massey, a Fellow of Merton, destined for perilous distinc- 
tion soon.* In April Mass was said in the Master’s Lodgings 
at University. In August a Romanist Chapel for public worship 
was opened in the College. When Fell died Walker tried to 
obtain control of the University Press.‘ In October John 
Massey, still young and undistinguished except for his new attach- 
ment to his Sovereign’s faith, was appointed to Fell’s vacant 
place at Christ Church, “‘to the affront of the antient canons 
there,” and was specially dispensed from coming to prayers 
or receiving the sacrament. In November Samuel Parker was 
installed as Bishop, a man who had exchanged Presbyterianism 
for High Churchmanship already, and whom the Whigs now 
thought a fit instrument “to betray and ruin the church.” 
Sturdy Protestants refused to send their sons to Oxford. The 
numbers of the University declined. In February 1687, when 
the King’s statue was set up at Walker’s College, James was 
lauded for devoutly owning his own religion and at the same 
time “promising his patronage to the religion in use.” In 
March Dean Massey established an Oratory at Christ Church. 
In the same month James informed the Privy Council of his

a iD 1677 (Ib. II, 385-7). 
3 But other converts were forthcoming soon (Jb. III, 176-7, 184, and 
213-14). And even with its curious details Wood’s fuller list is not 
complete. 
4 Walker, however, evidently met with opposition, and had to set up 
a Press of his own at University College (Ib. 209 and 218).

intention to issue a Declaration of Indulgence. Before the month 
was over, Dr. Clerke, the President of Magdalen, died, and the 
University found itself absorbed in the most interesting and 
memorable struggle which since the days of the Plantagenets 
the Church had sustained against the Crown. 
Clerke died on the 24th March. Early in April a Mandate 
from the King nominated Anthony Farmer to succeed him. 
No-one wishing to discredit James’ policy could have suggested 
a worse choice. Farmer had been originally a Cambridge man 
and noted for his riotous life as a student. He had afterwards 
taught in a Non-conformist school. In 1683, incorporated as 
a Master of Arts at Oxford, he had joined Magdalen Hall, and 
while there had been accused of quarrelsomeness and immorality. 
In 1685 he had migrated to Magdalen College, but he had never 
been elected a Fellow. The porter there deposed that he had 
often admitted him drunk. In an orgy at Abingdon he was 
alleged to have thrown the town stocks into a pond. His 
readiness to change his religion would seem to have been his 
only recommendation. The nomination was an outrage, and 
the College could not be expected to submit. The Fellows 
petitioned, pointing out that Farmer was ineligible under the 
Statutes, and asking for leave to make another choice: but 
this petition it seems that Sunderland either delayed or sup- 
pressed. On the 15th April, having waited till the last day 
allowed by the Statutes, they met and elected John Hough. 
Bishop Mews of Winchester promptly admitted him, and Convo- 
cation with hardly less promptitude gave him a Doctor’s degree. 
The Fellows submitted their case to Ormonde and the King— 
a stubborn and groundless resistance to the Royal Will and 
Pleasure being that which their souls eternally abhorred. But 
they were nevertheless cited before the Ecclesiastical Commission, 
which James had re-established in 1686, on the model of the old, 
arbitrary High Commission Court. They had of course an 
excellent defence. In June a formidable list of charges against 
Farmer was preferred. Even Jeffreys had to admit that the 
Court regarded him as “a very bad man.” Yet Hough’s election 
was annulled, and Aldworth, the Vice-President, and Henry 
1 Wood calls him a “demie” (Jb. 217). But, as Dr. Bloxam 
says, he was not on the Foundation (Magdalen College and James II, 
xii, 47). Thomas Smith and Baptist Levinz, Bishop of Man, had both 
decided not to stand—Smith because he could not accept the King’s 
requirements on the question of religion (Bloxam, 3, 4, 15). On the 15th 
April Smith and some others were in favour of deferring the election 
(Bloxam, 24-5), but only two Fellows, Charnock and Thompson, refused 
to take part in it. 
2 This, and other allegations, Farmer denied. (See Bloxam, 69-74.)
-P-A-G-E-512

Fairfax, a prominent Fellow, were suspended. Farmer, how- 
ever, was tacitly dropped. In August another Royal Mandate 
nominated Samuel Parker, the Bishop of Oxford, who was also 
ineligible under the Statutes, in Farmer’s stead. 
In September 1687 James paid a visit to Oxford. He was 
received with elaborate preparations. Rails and posts in St. 
Giles’ were taken down and the highway laid with gravel, which 
the rain, unhappily, turned into mud. Tapestries were hung 
from the windows. Claret flowed from the conduit. Wind- 
music played over Penniless Bench. Doctors, scholars, city 
companies, were all out in their formalities—the undergraduates 
not as orderly as they might have been. Ironside as Vice- 
Chancellor received the King on “the horseway leading to 
Aristotle’s well and Port Mead.”’ James’ old French hat ‘‘ not 
worth a groat ”’ seems scarcely to have done justice to the rest 
of his costume. But he had no cause to complain of his wel- 
come. At Christ Church, where Massey had a Romanist Chapel 
ready for him in Canterbury Quadrangle, he showed himself 
exceptionally gracious. He reminded the members of the 
College that as a Christ Church man he was senior to most of 
them; he had been entered in the Buttery-book just after 
Edgehill. He touched for the King’s evil. He accepted a 
rich Bible printed at the Sheldonian Press. But he preferred to 
talk to Dr. Plot about Holy-well in Flintshire or to Dr. Hyde 
about the theology of the Chinese, and to inquire whether the 
Fellows of All Souls were not bound to pray for the dead. 
Arriving on Saturday the 3rd September, he spent most of the 
Sunday at Christ Church, and heard Vespers at the Master’s 
Chapel in University College. But the most important though 
not the most agreeable incident of the Sunday was his inter- 
view with the Fellows of Magdalen in the afternoon. 
A vivid account of this meeting is given in the Impartial 
Relation of the proceedings attributed to Aldworth, Vice-President 
of the College. The King called sharply on Dr. Pudsey, the 
head of the deputation, to appreach. 
“The King. What is your name? Are you Dr. Pudsey ? 
Dr, Pudsey. Yes, may it please your Majesty. . 
The King. Did you receive my Letter ? 
Dr. Pudsey. Yes, Sir, we did. 
The King. Then you have not dealt with me like gentlemen. 
You have done very uncivily and undutifully . . here they all 
kneeled, and Dr. Pudsey offered a Petition, which his Majesty refused 
to receive, and said ‘ Ye have been a stubborn, turbulent College. 
I have known you to be so these six and twenty years. You have 
affronted me in this. Is this your Church of England Loyalty ? 
One would wonder to find so many Church of England men in such 
a business. Go home and show yourselves good members of the

Church of England. Get you gone, know I am your King. I will 
be obeyed ; and I command you to be gone. Go and admit the 
Bishop of Oxford, Head, Principal, what do you call it, of the College ? 
(one, who stood by, said President) I mean President of the College. 
Let them that refuse it look to it: they shall feel the weight of their 
Sovereign’s displeasure. 
The Fellows going out of the Lodgings were called back. 
The King. I hear that you have admitted a Fellow of the College 
since you received my inhibition, Is this true? Have you not 
admitted Mr, Holden Fellow ? 
Dr. Pudsey. I think he was admitted Fellow, but we conceive—— 
Mr. Cradock. May it please your Majesty. There was no new 
Election or Admission since your Majesty’s Inhibition, but only 
the consummation of a former Election. (They always elect to one 
year’s Probation, then the Person elected is received or ejected for 
ever.) 
The King. The Consummation of a Former Election! It was 
downright disobedience, and it is a fresh aggravation. Get you gone 
home, I say again, go, get you gone, and immediately repair to your 
Chapel, and elect the Bishop of Oxford, or else you must expect to 
feel the weight of my hand. (The Fellows offered again their Peti- 
tion on their knees.) Get you gone, I will recive nothing, from you, 
till you have obeyed me and admitted the Bishop of Oxford.” + 
The King, no doubt, had the advantage at the interview. He 
almost monopolised the speaking, and it is not easy to argue 
on one’s knees. But his threats left the Fellows unrepentant. 
They adjourned forthwith to their Chapel, and with two excep- 
tions protested their inability to obey the King. On the 
Monday James concluded his visit. He was taken to the Bod- 
leian, the Divinity School, the Theatre: he thought it a pity 
that Verrio had not done the painting on the roof. He par- 
took of a banquet in the Library at Selden’s End—three hot 
dishes and twenty-eight cold ones, with plates of fruit and 
sweetmeats “ piled high, like so many ricks of hay.”* As the 
King asked no-one to eat with him, a good deal of food was 
left for the scramble which ensued. James was ‘‘ extreame 
curteous and affable to all.” But before bidding them good- 
bye he turned to the Doctors about him, and discoursed, not

other papers on the subject see Bloxam (85 sq.) and Cobbett’s State Trials 
(vol. XII, Art. 355). Henry Holden had been admitted a Fellow in July, 
in spite of a letter from the King forbidding any fresh elections for the 
present (Bloxam, 77-8). 
2 The exceptions were Charnock and Dobson. Wood speaks of 21 
Fellows visiting the King. But one account gives the names of 22 Fellows 
as taking part in the subsequent meeting in the Chapel (Bloxam, 86).

without a touch of sharpness, on the virtues of charity and 
toleration, and the need of a right understanding among men. 
“T have given libertie of conscience to some of my subjects, 
therefore do not take it ill, for in what I have done, I think I 
have not don harme to you.” 
It was just this point on which his subjects remained uncon- 
vinced. The struggle with the Magdalen Fellows proceeded. 
Penn’s intervention did nothing to help. But there was an idea 
that, if the Bishop of Oxford were once in possession, the Fellows 
might be brought to acquiesce. In October three Commissioners, 
escorted by three troops of horse were sent down to visit the 
College—Dr. Cartwright, Bishop of Chester, Sir Robert Wright, 
Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, and Sir Thomas Jenner, a 
Baron of the Exchequer. On the 21st, declining to sit in the 
Chapel, they met in the Hall, and the Bishop of Chester delivered 
a speech in which sycophancy mingled with warning and reproof. 
“Yours, like all other Corporations, is the Creature of the Crown ; 
and how then durst you make your Statutes spurn against 
their Maker?” Dr. Hough fought for his rights with firmness 
and good temper. “All things,” Baron Jenner notes, ‘‘ were 
very civil and quiet, only a great crowd.” On Saturday morning, 
the 22nd, they met in the Common Room, and Hough was at 
first called in alone. He refused to submit to the sentence of 
deprivation. He declined courteously but staunchly to give 
up his keys. He was declared to be no longer President and 
his name was struck out of the Buttery-book. Dr. Fairfax 
also appeared and told the Commissioners boldly that he had 
been suspended only for refusing to elect Farmer, and that for 
their own credit they were bound to take his suspension off.t 
The Fellows as a whole were then called in and asked if they 
would agree to admit the Bishop of Oxford. Charnock at once 
assented. Dr. Pudsey and Thomas Smith hesitated: they 
would make no active opposition. But all the rest refused. 
In the afternoon a more striking scene occurred. Hough 
came back “with a great company,” and entered a formal 
protest against all the proceedings. The audience broke into 
applause and the Chief Justice lost his temper. He had “ met 
with nothing but affronts from the College.” In the Chapel 
there was no table. In the Hall there was no carpet. These 
things were affronts to the King, and he would “‘ vindicate the 
honour of his Master to the last drop of his Blood.” Hough 
was compelled to give securities for good behaviour, and the 
1 The Impartial Relation (quoted by Bloxam, 129) is evidently mistaken 
in dating Fairfax’s appearance on the 21st. 
2 But there was little reason to complain of the Commissioners’ bear- 
ing as a whole.
-P-A-G-E-515
THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 455 
Court adjourned till Tuesday the 25th. On that day the Bishop 
of Oxford was installed by proxy: Charnock was the only 
Fellow willing to assist. Hough had left on the Saturday night, 
but his Lodgings were broken open, though the first smith 
summoned for this duty ran away ‘‘as fast as he could.” The 
Fellows and Demies as a body, asked if they would now submit 
to Parker, agreed to comply so far as the Statutes allowed. 
The Commissioners evidently thought that the worst of the trouble 
was over, and sent in a satisfactory report to the King. 
But James had not the sense or moderation to allow the 
agitation to die down. He demanded a more definite acknow- 
ledgment of wrong-doing and a full admission of the jurisdiction 
of the Court. On the 28th the Commissioners, who had waited. 
in Oxford for Sunderland’s reply, had to summon the Fellows 
again and to insist upon these new demands. Their efforts at 
conciliation had been wasted—“‘ very grievous to me,’’ Baron 
Jenner notes. ‘‘ The Breach,” wrote one of the Fellows, “is 
now wider than ever.’’ They stoutly refused to incriminate 
themselves by admitting that they had done wrong. The 
Commissioners adjourned their sittings till the 16th November, 
and reports arose that the Fellows would probably give in. But 
public opinion stiffened their resistance, a sense of honour and 
a fear of shame. On the 2nd November Parker took possession 
of the President’s Lodgings : but he was already a dying man. 
On the 16th the Commissioners resumed their sittings in Oxford. 
Two Romanists, nominated by the King as Fellows, were intro- 
duced. The Bishop of Chester indulged in another speech. “I 
hope,” he wound up, ‘that I have said enough to convince you 
that the Fig-leaves, which you have stitched so artificially to- 
gether, will not cover your nakedness.” The Fellows were 
required to prostrate themselves in all humility at his Majesty’s 
feet, and the overwhelming majority of those present refused. 
Thereupon twenty-five Fellows were sentenced to expulsion. The 
decree was posted the same day on the College gates. Not only 
that, but the Ecclesiastical Commission in London, determined 
to deprive the offenders of their livelihood, declared them in- 
capable of taking Orders or of receiving any preferment. Against 
this outrage Sprat, now Bishop of Rochester, found the courage 
to protest, and other Bishops also pointedly disregarded the 
instruction. 
1 T. Smith had fewer reservations to his credit, Charnock none. Fair- 
fax refused all compromise and was expelled. So to his credit was the 
under-porter. 
® For the names see Bloxam (204). T. Smith, Charnock, Thompson, 
and certain absent Fellows were excused (Bloxam, 185, and Wilson, 
Magdalen Coll., 206-7).
-P-A-G-E-516
456 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
So far James’ tyrannical methods had triumphed. But 
public opinion was deeply moved. Troops had to be sent to 
Oxford. A great public subscription was raised for the Fellows, 
and the Princess of Orange contributed two hundred pounds. 
The Demies of the College for the most part refused promotion 
and claimed to share the Fellows’ fate. They were left for the 
College authorities to deal with, and Charnock as Dean had a 
stormy time with students whose love of legality would not 
permit them to obey usurpers. Magdalen Fellowships went 
a-begging, and Roman Catholics were freely nominated to them. 
Wood notes “‘ six new popish fellowes” one day, and four more 
another. But the Vice-Chancellor would not allow them to 
wear gowns until they had complied with all the rules for 
matriculation. In the College disorder increased, and on the 
16th January 1688 some fourteen Demies were expelled.1_ A few 
days later those who remained invited their expelled colleagues 
to dinner in Hall, where “ with their hats cock’d”’ they drank 
confusion to the Pope. Three more expulsions followed. In 
February Wood notes that not one Commoner # or nobleman is 
left at Magdalen, and that the Gentlemen Commoners and 
noblemen at Christ Church have dropped since Fell’s day from 
over forty to two. Even Parker bitterly resented James’ policy 
of packing the College with Romanists. ‘‘Is this the kindness 
the King promised me? To set me here to make me his tool 
and his prop! To place me with a company of men, which he 
knows I hate the conversation of !”” His anger made his illness 
worse, and in the night of the 20th March hedied.? On the 31st 
Bonaventure Gifford, ‘‘a Sorbon Dr., and a secular preist,” 
was installed. Mass was celebrated in the Chapel. Thomas 
Smith could acquiesce no longer, and before long he and six of 
the old Fellows still remaining were deprived. 
But, little as the sufferers guessed it, deliverance was at 
hand. All through the spring and summer of 1688 the tide of 
feeling rose against the King. His new Declaration of Indul- 
gence was generally defied. Not a single clergyman in Oxford 
read it. The Seven Bishops, protesting, were charged with 
rebellion. On the 8th June they were ordered to the Tower, 
all London invoking blessings on them as they passed. On 
the roth the Queen gave birth to a son whom the whole Protest- 
2 One or two documents say 15, and Mr. Wilson accepts this figure ; 
but only 14 names are given, and one of these Charnock is alleged to have 
restored (Bloxam, 233-5). Wood speaks of 14 (Life, III, 254). 
® He may mean Gentleman Commoner (Jb. 257). 
® About 7 in the evening, says Wood. Others say on the 21st. Presi- 
dent Newlyn of Corpus and Dr. Lamphire of Hart Hall died in the same 
month.

ant world denounced as an impostor. The bonfires lit at Mag- 
dalen and at Christ Church only accentuated the refusal of the 
other Colleges to rejoice.1 And the illuminations ordered on 
the 1st July were used by churchmen to celebrate the acquittal 
of the Bishops. On Ormonde’s death the King required the 
election of Jeffreys as Chancellor. But Convocation, happily, 
anticipated his Majesty by electing the Duke’s grandson ? before 
the Mandate arrived. The University representatives had 
already been summoned—a sinister invitation—to give an 
account before the King in Council of the liberties they claimed.* 
James sent down a new Bishop to Oxford, and the Canons of 
Christ Church refused to attend his installation. He threatened 
to summon the disobedient clergy before the Ecclesiastical 
Commission ; whereupon Bishop Sprat, one of the Commissioners, 
resigned his seat. Irish troops were brought to England, but 
a Dutch army was making ready overseas. Before the end 
of September, William’s fleet was reported to be on its way. 
Then at last the blind King awoke to his danger, and hurriedly 
tried to conciliate his people. On the 3rd October he allowed 
the Archbishop to propose the restoration of the Magdalen 
Fellows. On the 5th the Ecclesiastical Commission was dissolved. 
A few days later the Bishop of Winchester was charged to visit 
and settle the College. The exiled Fellows gathered from all 
quarters. The whole University determined to celebrate the 
event. Three hundred gentlemen on horseback escorted Bishop 
Mews to his lodgings. And though he was summoned suddenly 
to London, to attend the meeting of the Privy Council at which 
James exhibited proofs of the birth of his son, he returned with- 
out delay to Oxford and carried through his task. On the 25th 
October a memorable scene took place at Magdalen. In the 
Chapel the Bishop read the King’s order to restore the College. 
In the Hall the books were produced and the names of all the 
intruders struck out. Dr. Hough and his colleagues were solemnly 
reinstated. Charnock was expelled, to become a Jacobite con- 
spirator and to find a death upon the scaffold. Speeches were 
delivered, warmed by something more than compliment. The 
hearts of the bystanders must have been very full. ‘ An extra- 
ordinary great dinner” was served at the President’s Lodgings. 
Bells rang and bonfires burned all over Oxford for the triumph 
of the persecuted dons that night.‘

458 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Ten days later William’s fleet was heading for Torbay. The 
Tory Earl of Abingdon was the first English Peer to join him. 
On the gth November Obadiah Walker left for London. Before 
the end of the month Dean Massey followed him. The Romanist 
Chapels at Christ Church and University were stripped. On 
the 5th December the troops of Lord Lovelace and Captain 
Bertie entered the city. On the 6th William’s declaration was 
read at Penniless Bench. On the r1th both Walker and Gifford, 
the Master of University and the ex-President of Magdalen, 
flying, like a more illustrious fugitive, were seized in their flight 
and committed to prison—an incident which must have given 
rich satisfaction in some Common Rooms which were never to 
know them again. On the 17th the University published its 
congratulations to the Prince :—‘‘ TIllustrissime atque invic- 
tissime princeps.’’ Before Christmas James had landed in 
France. Before the new year and the new term opened, the 
Revolution was happily secure. 
With the Revolution of 1688 another period of history opens. 
But for some years Wood lived on in Oxford, busy to the last 
with his studies and his pen, commenting as closely and incisively 
as ever on the daily life of the little world which he knew best. 
He was a strong man naturally, and not yet old, but his health 
had long been broken. His reserve and unpopularity increased. 
Friends like Ralph Sheldon and Arthur Charlett, who in 1692 
became Master of University, continued to show him kindness. 
Young Thomas Tanner of Queen’s, who could appreciate his 
learning, and who was already training to be an antiquary 
himself, was introduced to him in 1694. White Kennet of 
Edmund Hall had helped him for years past. James Bisse of 
Wadham and Nicholas Martin, Vice-Principal of Hart Hall, 
were often with him latterly. But Wood had alienated many 
of his acquaintances, and the publication of the Athene, with 
its sharp criticisms and incautious judgments, made him fresh 
enemies upon every side. His last years were embittered by the 
rancours which he had excited. He was proud of his book and 
pathetically anxious to know what others said of it. He noted 
eagerly that Queen Mary bought a copy and promised to read 
excerpts from the diaries of Dr. Thomas Smith, Bishop Cartwright and 
Baron Jenner. Mr. Wilson (Magdalen College) has added a few details. 
Cobbett has a full narrative in vol. XII of his State Trials. And in App. 
IX to vol. III of his Life of Wood, Dr. Clark has printed Wood’s narra- 
tives of the Fellows’ expulsion and restoration from MS. Tanner 456b. 
But Wood’s account, though differing a little in details, adds nothing 
material to Dr. Bloxam’s collection. His diary for 1687-8 is of course 
full of references to the subject.
-P-A-G-E-519
THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 459 
it. But he did not spare himself in recording the unfavourable 
verdicts passed. ‘‘ A great deal of ill nature ” was found in the 
two volumes. But Wood would not allow the charge. 
“Who is ill natur’d ? whether the author who speaks the truth, 
or a company of idle fellowes that sit all day in an alehouse or tavern 
to pick holes in the coates of industrious men who labour for the 
honor ofthe University.”’ 
Dr. Bathurst took him to task instead of thanking him for his 
achievement, ‘‘ like a poore spirit and snivling fellow.” Heads 
of Colleges were often critical, though the younger men approved 
of the book. The Master of Balliol lapsed into coarseness to 
describe it. Another dignitary would gladly have subscribed 
to have it burned. A more famous personage, Dr. Burnet, 
was reported to have spoken of the author as “a little silly 
fellow who hath an ill designe to libell honest men.” Dr. Wallis 
was not alone in resenting some of the statements made in it. 
Wood had remembered the grudges of a lifetime, and it was 
no wonder if the publication brought a hornet’s nest about his 
ears. In New College Common Room there were open threats 
of beating him. A Magdalen chorister, whose grandfather 
had been severely handled in Wood’s pages, attacked him one 
day in the street, and the author had to take to his cudgel in 
defence. Above all, Lord Clarendon, less tolerant than his 
Royal niece, determined to punish him for the charge of corruption 
brought against the famous Chancellor, and in November 1692 
Wood, who had relied too readily on an incautious note of 
Aubrey’s, was formally cited before the Vice-Chancellor’s Court. 
In writing the lives of two judges, David Jenkyns and John 
Glynne, Wood had repeated the story that Clarendon as Lord 
Chancellor accepted money from office-seekers, which had been 
made, no doubt, unjustly, one of the counts in the Minister’s 
impeachment.t Wood had said no more than others had said 
freely, and he might well have pleaded that he could not be 
punished for libelling a dead man. Instead of that he took the 
narrow ground that it was not proved that he had written the 
words complained of, and on that plea he was bound to fail. 
Had he behaved with ordinary wisdom, had he offered an un- 
reserved apology in the terms required, it seems that Lord 
Clarendon would have dropped the prosecution. But Wood 
showed himself, as usual, difficult to deal with. He raised 
false issues. He pleaded that his book had been lawfully 
licensed, and that, if any statement in it was objectionable, 
the licenser or the Secretary of State who appointed him 
1 See Bliss’ edition of the Athene (III, 643 and 753). Aubrey was 
certainly responsible for the note about Jenkyns (Wood’s Life, IV, 8, n.). 
   
-P-A-G-E-520
460 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
was to blame. He alleged that Clarendon and the Archbishop 
of Canterbury had both made alterations in his manuscript, 
and that they or the printers, without his knowledge, might 
have inserted the words complained of. He haggled over the 
terms of the settlement proposed. He wrote to Clarendon, 
complaining of his loss of time and money, and warning him 
that it would “sound but ill in the eares of posterity” if he 
dealt unfavourably with ‘‘a zealous pretender to learning.” 
But his letters were not calculated to conciliate his opponent, 
and his ill-judged defences only cost more time and money to 
refute. There was little difficulty in bringing home the re- 
sponsibility for his statements. On the 29th July 1693 the 
Court pronounced sentence. Wood was to be banished as a 
disturber of the peace and to lose his University privileges till 
he subscribed a recantation which the Court approved. His 
libel was to be committed to the flames. And he had to pay 
Lord Clarendon’s costs.1 
Wood poured out his anger at the judgment. To one who 
had spent his life in the University’s service, the terms, even 
if largely a formality, seemed cruelly hard. The expense alone 
was for him a serious consideration. He could not see that he 
had been in any way at fault. Clarendon, he protested, had dis- 
armed him and then fought with him naked, had cut out his 
tongue and then bid him speak, had raked and scraped up 
witnesses to overcome him; and “after al this, the author 
is to submit for what he hath said, and be made a tool to re- 
cover the credit of a person that hath been banished 28 yeares 
and dead 20.” Wood lived down the judgment, but his resent- 
ment remained. Only a few weeks before his death he met 
Lord Clarendon in the President’s Lodgings at Corpus, and there 
“began to ripe up all the matter,”’ and to attack him for dealing 
with him unworthily and “against all law.” But he gained 
little satisfaction from the encounter, and to the last the recol- 
lection of this law-suit hung over and embittered the sensitive 
and lonely man. 
1 Wood’s diary has brief entries on this subject, and the Acts of the 
Vice-Chancellor’s Court in the University Archives (Reg. Cur. Cane. 
1692-98) have various entries dealing with it from Nov. 1692 to Oct. 1693. 
Loose notes of the proceedings seem to have been kept, which found their 
way into print, even before Edmund Curll reprinted them as Original 
Letters, giving an account of the Libel, the Answer and the Sentence, 
in his Miscellanies on Several Curious Subjects (iii-xxviii). The volume 
of scattered papers in the Archives collected by the late Keeper (Arch. 
Univ. Oxon. W.P. y 26) is mentioned by Dr. Clark, who has put together 
the fullest account of the trial in the early pages of the fourth volume of 
his Life of Wood. For the sentence see vol. IV (44-6), for the entry in 
the Proctors’ Black Book, vol. III (438).

  THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 461 
Generations which have long forgotten Wood’s resentments, 
and which remember only his consummate labours, will wish 
that he could have found more happiness in his later years. 
Still his life-long interests held him. Still he went on collecting 
materials for a continuation of the Athen@: he was not mistaken 
in thinking that his work would live. Still he found time to 
enjoy a rare visit to London, a brief excursion into the country, 
an occasional evening at a tavern with a friend. On the 12th 
October 1695 he went out with young Tanner to Binsey, and told 
him the story of St. Frideswide in the Chapel porch, then on to 
_ Godstow, where they talked of Rosamund, and so home through 
Wolvercote after eating a dish of fish. On the 1st November 
he felt ill, but he resolved, as he often did, to ‘‘ walk it out,” ? 
and the diary went on as dauntlessly as usual. On the 9th 
November King William came to Oxford, and Wood was well 
enough to set down the details. But a few days later he had 
made his last entry,? and had laid down for ever his untiring 
pen. His illness increased. On the 22nd Charlett visited him 
at the request of his relations, who reported that he did not 
realise his danger, that he ‘“‘ was very froward, that they durst 
not speak to Him.’ Charlett made his way up into Wood’s 
room, which he had never been allowed to see before; the 
relations ‘‘ ventured to leave his Doors unlockt.’’ But he had 
a hard task to persuade the sick man that he was dying. He 
seems to have discharged it with tenderness and skill, as a 
“very old acquaintance and very loving friend.” He begged 
him to put his affairs in order, to “ settle his papers, that were 
so Numerous and Confused.” He suggested that Tanner might 
take charge of them, and the suggestion was approved. Once 
convinced that he could not recover, Wood showed both bravery 
and patience. He had time to see two or three friends, Tanner 
and Bisse and Nicholas Martin, to sort a “ vast multitude of 
Papers,” to order two bushels of them to be burned. He 
had time also to write—it was characteristic of him—the “ most 
minute Particulars ” about his funeral, to receive the Sacrament 
devoutly and to make his will. But he spent “ his spirits more,”’ 
Tanner noted, “in setting his Papers in Order, than in providing 
for another World.” He bequeathed to the University, to be 
deposited in the Ashmolean, all his manuscripts and all his 
remaining books and pamphlets *—truly, as Tanner pleaded, 
1 He had apparently caught cold, but he was much worse after his 
walk (Life, III, 492-3). 
2 It refers to a letter of Nov. 14. 
8 A few MSS. went to the Bodleian, and some of his books and pam- 
phlets were already inthe Museum. The bequest, collected in a room called 
“Mr, Wood’s study,” and arranged by the Keeper Edward Lhuyd, was
-P-A-G-E-522
462 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
“a most noble gift.” He was gentle and charitable, as the end 
drew near, begging his companions for forgiveness. He talked 
a great while one evening with his sister, with whom he had been 
so long at variance. He died as he would have wished, working 
to the last, and leaving a great legacy of work behind him, and 
they buried him in the Ante-Chapel of his own College, under 
a monument which mis-stated his age. It would have com- 
forted him to know how his writings would be treasured in the 
University for whose fame and honour he had toiled.t 
Wood passed away as the world he knew was passing, the 
world of the Rebellion and the Restoration, of uncompromising 
zealots, of over-zealous churchmen, of new philosophies and old 
ideals. Dimly and unconsciously forces were awaking which 
were to unsettle the foundations of learning. Science was 
beginning to speak with strange authority. Lesser minds than 
Locke’s were asking whether Latin and Greek need be the only 
keys to knowledge. Even clerical Oxford could no longer keep 
her heritage for clerks alone. If the supreme object of University 
teaching was still to train churchmen to vindicate Church 
doctrines, the logic and philosophy developed for those purposes 
no longer exercised the same ascendency. The Cambridge 
Platonists indeed might cling to one great Greek philosopher 
as the fountain-head of wisdom. But they, and the few who 
thought with them at Oxford, had little patience with the 
ecclesiastical contentions of the past. They declared that 
morals were “nineteen parts in twenty of all religion.” They 
turned their backs upon Scholastic learning and found in holiness 
the way to knowledge. They denounced the ‘“‘ ungoverned spirit ”” 
of dogma and the error of carrying reverence for ‘‘ grey-headed 
doctrines’? toofar. They prayed for purity of heart and charity of 
outlook, for “ unspotted righteousness and an unshaken peace.’”? 
very large. ‘‘ Excluding 45 books added at later dates and 12 MSS. not 
of Wood’s writing or collecting, we have, as the present total of the genuine 
Wood Collection, 115 volumes of MSS. (or, if we include also the 39 alman- 
acs interleaved with Wood’s diary, 154 MSS.) and 959 printed volumes ” 
(Clark, Life, I, 10). In 1860 the Collection was transferred to the Bodleian. 
1 Wood died on Nov. 29, 1695. Charlett’s letter, dated Dec. 1, giving 
an account of his death, is in the Bodleian (MS. Eng. Misc. d. 10); and 
Charlett’s letter, dated, I think, clearly in the MS. Nov. 21, recommending 
Tanner to Wood, is in MS. Tanner 24 (£. 92, not 82). Dr. Clark prints 
both (Wood’s Life, III, 497-502) together with Tanner’s account of his 
last hours with Wood, dated Nov. 24, which is found in MS. Ballard 4 
(ff. 28-9). But if the “long letter ” written to Wood by Charlett after 
his visit on Nov. 22 is the letter printed by Dr. Clark (p. 500), as a note of 
his (p. 498) suggests, either the date of the letter or the date of the visit 
must be wrong. Tanner speaks of officious inquiries by Merton men.

  THE OXFORD OF ANTHONY WOOD 463 
But the changes which some foresaw and many dreaded 
were as yet slowtocome. At Oxford the students of the Restora- 
tion returned for safety to the ancient teachers. They handed on 
to their successors the same unsatisfying, unprogressive studies. 
Butler was soon to weary of “ frivolous lectures” and “ un- 
intelligible disputations.” Locke was still a revolutionary 
when he suggested that the Categories of Aristotle might have 
had their day. Greek continued to be the source of science. 
Latin, with its majestic background of Roman theology and 
Roman law, continued to be the universal language of scholars. 
Milton had sharpened it for public controversy. Fell had 
insisted on it for a history of Oxford. The character stamped 
on European education by the Church and the Renaissance 
between them held. With the reaction in politics a reaction 
towards the Schoolmen had set in. At Cambridge a Professor 
lecturing before Clarendon could recommend nothing newer 
than the wisdom of Aquinas. At Oxford the ‘“‘ Latitude-men,” 
with their unseen and intangible visions and their only two 
evident Puritanical traditions, found comparatively few to share 
their tolerance or to echo their appeal. The generation which 
succeeded Falkland had ceased to understand the longings 
which possessed him. The noble passion of the seventeenth 
century hadspentits force. And a new spirit and new impulses, 
still far away, were needed, to bring back to the slumbering 
courts and cloisters of Oxford the manners, virtue, freedom, 
power of which the poet has sung. 
men like Joseph Glanvill and John Norris, see the second volume of Tul- 
loch’s Rational Theology and the fifth chapter of the third volume of 
Mullinger’s Cambridge. At Oxford divines like Samuel Parker were 
more in fashion. He published A Free and Impartial Censure of the 
Platonick Philosophie twenty years before he became a Bishop.

  PREFACE 
The problems of readjustment, for the individ- 
ual and for business and for the state, which in- 
evitably follow war are most important at the 
present moment. Almost five years after the end- 
ing of the Great Conflict, many of these problems 
are still facing us, and it will take many more 
years before they are settled. One who is in- 
terested in the statistics of conditions will find 
many places in which they can be found. Al- 
though statistics show what exists or has existed, 
they seldom provide advice regarding the solu- 
tions. The present work is entirely lacking in 
statistics. It is intended to be of assistance in the 
solution of some problems. 
Man power, which in these days should mean 
brain power and mind power, must always be 
conserved. What should be attempted is to adjust 
individuals to their environments. This is difficult 
enough when we deal with the normal, but it is 
increasingly difficult when we have to adjust the 
crippled and the diseased. Scciety, or the State, 
strives through education to fit individuals into the 
niches which they may best occupy, but at present 
this is poorly accomplished. The defective is left 
to a small group of physicians and others to patch 
up if they can. But, in their efforts, they are met 
with incredulity and disbelief, indifference and

even opposition. It is to show medical men who 
are not specialists in these fields, as well as the 
intelligent public, the general principles and the 
manner of applying them in the neuroses and 
psychoses, that the present work is published. 
No one should read the book with the belief that 
it contains more than general statements of prin- 
ciples, and their application to one class of dis- 
order, viz., that primarily involving the nervous 
system. Nor, even for those disorders, should it 
be understood that necessarily detailed programs 
are laid out for any one or for every patient. 
Each patient differs from every other, and all 
re-education prescriptions must include the final 
admonition of the best cook-books: ‘‘Salt and 
pepper to taste.’’ 
Repetition will be found from chapter to chap- 
ter. This has been purposely done, on account of 
the importance of the matter, because individual 
chapters may be read, and the applications should 
not be forgotten. For all kinds of readers, spe- 
cialists as well as general, it is exasperating to 
find numerous references to earlier or to subse- 
quent paragraphs. These references have been 
kept down to a minimum. 
In the same general field, McKenzie’s Reclaim- . 
ing the Maimed should be read. In it there will 
be found more details regarding some of the 
methods useful in re-education. Some of the illus- 
trations of the present book are borrowed by per- 
mission of Dr. McKenzie, to whom the author 
makes his general acknowledgment. 
A few words may be said regarding some terms 
that have been used. It would be best if the pa-

tient could be called something other than ‘‘pa- 
tient,’’ something which would always convey to 
him, to his family, and to his friends, the fact 
that he is being fitted to take up his life work 
again. ‘‘Pupil,’’ ‘‘learner,’’ ‘‘scholar,’’ and the 
more recently used ‘‘trainee’’ are useful but not 
good. Similarly with the term for the re-educator, 
who may be a physician or surgeon, but who fre- 
quently is not a medical practitioner. If in Amer- 
ica the term ‘‘doctor’’ did not so commonly con- 
note a medical practitioner, this term would be 
most suitable. In place of this we are forced for 
the moment to use the convenient ‘‘teacher,’’ ‘‘in- 
structor,’’ and ‘‘physician.’’ 
My thanks are due to many who have supplied 
me with information, but to none more than to 
those patients who have been subjects of re- 
education.

CHAPTER TI 
WHAT IS RE-EDUCATION? 
Re-education involves the same principles as 
other kinds of education, and in no particular do 
the general principles of educatién and re-educa- 
tion differ. It is well recognized that both the 
general and special education of any individual 
are matters of habit formation. Certain differ- 
ences exist in the various kinds of education, but 
these differences are relatively slight as compared 
with the similarities. In general the difference be- 
tween what is called education and that called re- 
education is a difference of direction or aim, or 
that of material. In education habits are formed 
on the basis of the instinctive tendencies of an 
individual who is endowed with a normal number 
and a normal quality of parts. When the indi- 
vidual who is normal loses some of his parts, or 
the parts become useless because of distant dis- 
turbances, it becomes necessary to utilize other 
parts as replacements if the individual is to be 
self-supporting or an active participant in the 
life of his community. The original instinctive 
tendencies, which depend upon the integrity of the 
parts assumed to be destroyed, cannot now be 
used in the formation of new habits, and other 
instinctive tendencies must be utilized. In some 
cases another part of the body is made use of.

  4 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
In its broadest sense re-education, therefore, is 
a replacement of bad habits with better habits, 
or it is the formation of new habits to replace 
habits which have been lost. We shall appreciate 
this better if we consider briefly certain normal 
habits, how they vary, and what takes place in 
the process of re-education in order that there 
shall be a compensation for lost habits. 
Some of the things we call habits are social; 
each individual in the social stratum has them. 
Others relate to smaller groups, and to belong to 
these smaller groups the individual must have 
certain kinds or constellations of habits. Still 
other habits are purely personal; they are of a 
certain character for one individual in a group or 
ina family. In fact, the term habit is used prop- 
erly to describe more than ninety-nine per cent 
of the daily activities of a waking individual. We 
have habits of eating and of drinking, of dress- 
ing and of purchasing clothing, or using furniture 
and ornaments; we have habits of speech and of 
thought. 
The child, whether black or white or brown or 
yellow, is born with certain instinctive tendencies 
to action. The movements are sometimes spoken 
of as reflex movements, but they do not differ 
materially from many other movements which 
are not of as definite a character. Appropriate 
stimuli will start the machinery so that a certain 
result is obtained. An object placed in the hand 
produces a grasping or clutching movement of 
the fingers, an object placed on the lips brings 
about a grasping movement of the lips and if the 
object is grasped sucking movements follow. As
-P-A-G-E-13

the child grows older the parents, or nurse, make 
an effort to wean the child. Hither the child is 
not presented to the breast of the mother, or the 
nursing bottle is not given to him. The resulting 
lack of satisfaction of hunger by the usual means 
causes the child to take on or assume an activity 
somewhat different from that to which he has 
been accustomed. The milk is presented in a 
spoon or in a cup, or a piece of food is given 
on a fork or on a spoon. At times it is difficult 
for the child to acquire this new method of feed- 
ing; he is, we say, refractory. But after repeated 
efforts the child soon adopts the method of tak- 
ing his food which the parents or nurse desire 
him to adopt. He forms a new habit to take the 
place of the primitive reflex or instinctive activ- 
ity, and this habit, it will be noted, differs accord- 
ing to the social environment. 
After the period of suckling the Chinese baby 
advances to the use of chopsticks. Children of 
the so-called western civilization acquire the 
habit of using a spoon, a knife and a fork. Some 
learn—form the habit—to hold the fork in the 
left hand, and consistently hold it in that hand 
whenever a knife is also employed at the same 
time. Others change the fork to the right hand 
after the meat or other food is cut, and do not 
learn to use the left hand for the manipulation of 
the fork in conveying food to the mouth. A few 
learn to use the knife in the left hand and the 
fork only in the right, these being the left-handed. 
Later in life some of the left-handed also learn 
to use the knife with the right hand and the fork 
with the left as most other persons do. They try 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
thus to conform to the habits of the great major- 
ity of the community in this respect. Other dif- 
ferences in the habits of using table utensils are 
readily seen by an observer. These differences — 
are very evident at the popular lunch counter. ' 
Here there will be observed very different habits 
of manipulation of knife and fork and spoon. A 
variety of ways of using napkins and of arranging 
dishes may also be seen. In addition the actual 
operations of eating, whether one chews his food 
thoroughly or almost bolts it as do many animals, 
the sipping of drinks, and even the insistence on 
certain combinations of foods in a restaurant are 
habits. 
Let the right-handed reader observe himself 
while stirring a cup of tea or coffee with a spoon. 
The movement is made evenly, without difficulty. 
Then let him try to do the same thing with his 
other hand. The movement is irregular, awkward 
or incodrdinate, and difficult. The left hand and 
arm have not been taught to do this; they have not 
acquired the special habit. But if periods of prac- 
tice are taken, the left hand will acquire the habit 
so perfectly that the movements will be performed 
as quickly and as regularly as are those with the 
right hand. The adjustments, nervous and mus- 
cular, are made after a few practice periods, and 
the left hand and arm may therefore be used 
instead of the right. There has been a kind of re- 
education, that re-education which is of the nature 
of substitution. 
In dressing a man habitually places one leg into 
his trousers first, be that the right or the left. 
He has learned—he has acquired the habit—to
-P-A-G-E-15
  
WHAT IS RE-EDUCATION? 7 
make certain movements in a regular course in 
putting on his clothes, and he uses his hands in 
certain definite ways in doing these things. His 
collar is grasped in a certain fashion, his tie is 
turned by the right or by the left hand, he laces 
his shoes and ties the knot in special ways. These 
things are done rapidly and accurately. The re- 
cruit has not acquired any special habit with his 
soldier clothes, his leggings feel peculiar, he works 
over them until they are finally adjusted. His hat 
strap bothers him, and it takes him much time to 
get it in such a position that he is comfortable. 
Compare this with the veteran, who appears to 
make his adjustments with ease and without obvi- 
ously special care. The latter’s habits have, how- 
ever, been formed, and his dressing has taken on 
that habitual character which is noticed in the 
civilian. Let the soldier or civilian encounter a 
condition that makes necessary a new movement, 
and he becomes slow and inaccurate. When the 
buttonhole on the collar band is a trifle large, 
there is considerable fumbling until the proper 
adjustment is made. 
‘When one has been accustomed to wear sus- 
penders and changes to a belt, he usually finds 
the change uncomfortable; he has the feeling of 
incompleteness or of lacking something. He has 
become habituated to making reactions with the 
pressure of the suspenders on his shoulders and 
his reactions are not as ready and as comfortable 
without this pressure. Conversely the reactions 
of an individual are awkward when he begins to 
wear suspenders after having worn a belt for a 
long time. He has acquired the habits of reaction
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
with his trousers supported at the hips, and it 
takes him some time to adjust to the unusual con- 
dition. Let aman don a woman’s sweater and try 
to button it. The buttons are on the left side 
instead of on the right, and he gropes (for he has 
formed this habit) with the right hand for the 
buttons. If he is to wear the sweater for any 
length of time, he must become re-educated to use 
the hands differently. In other words, he must 
form new replacement habits. 
The purchasing of certain foods and of certain 
special articles of clothing and other supplies is 
largely a matter of habit. This may be illustrated 
well by an extreme example. The steady drinker 
of alcoholic liquors forms the habit of stopping at _ 
certain saloons en route from his work. If one 
of his oases is closed he experiences actual discom- 
fort; his schedule is thrown out of plumb. In his 
walk he stops at the usual place, although he 
knows the place has been closed, and for many 
days, even though he may not stop to turn in, he 
hesitates in passing the place. In this case, as in 
many of our activities, the stimuli in sequence 
act successively to bring about reactions. Many 
persons have the habit of using a certain sort of 
pencil and paper, and are unable to perform their 
work if the special kinds are not available. We 
go to special shops for special things, although we 
might satisfy all our wants as cheaply and as well 
in one large store. We buy neckties of a certain 
color or of a limited few colors or patterns. Some 
purchase only ties that are bizarre, and others 
only those that are quiet in color tone, regardless 
of the color combinations.
-P-A-G-E-17
  WHAT IS RE-EDUCATION? 9 
Many persons explain these habits in intel- 
lectual terms. They say they buy a hexagonal 
pencil because that kind of pencil gives them the 
best results; they can holdsit better than a round 
one. They contend that the having of a pocket 
on the left breast of a coat is useless, and at times 
dangerous because of the possibility of loss there- 
from. They require their tailors to make their 
coats without that pocket and with an inside 
upper pocket. It is a fact, however, that we use a 
certain pencil, hard or soft, or round or hexagonal, 
because of habit. That kind of pencil was used by 
us under certain special conditions, and whenever 
these conditions arise we demand the same kind 
of implement for the proper performance of the 
work. So also with the pockets which the tailor 
makes in the coat. We have formed the habit of 
using the left-hand inner pocket for a note book 
and the demand that the coat be made in this way 
is in reality a demand that our habits shall not be 
interfered with. 
An individual wears ornaments to which he has 
become accustomed—which he has formed the 
habit of wearing. There are many peculiar habits 
attached to these decorations. During a lecture 
or an address, or even in ordinary conversation, 
some speakers continually manipulate their eye 
glasses on their chain. Others fumble with their 
watch chains, or twist the chain around one finger. 
By force of habit we wear certain rings on certain 
fingers. If a man is accustomed to wear a pin in 
his scarf and loses his pin, he experiences a feel- 
ing that something is lacking until habit is satis- 
fied and he has another pin. After wearing a

wrist watch a number of years a man may retain 
the habit of raising the arm to learn the time, even 
if he has discarded that kind of watch. Not infre- 
quently the habit of wearing such an ornament as 
a wrist watch results in laughable situations. 
Thus the writer has seen a woman at a bathing 
beach unconsciously continue to wear her watch 
when going into the water. The habit of wearing 
the watch is so firmly fixed that the new situation 
does not inhibit it, even though dangerous to the 
watch. Doubtless if the woman were asked she 
would say she never wore her watch when taking 
a bath. The habit of wearing it was replaced 
by the habit of taking it off under the usual 
conditions of bathing. 
Because of habit we sit on chairs, we sleep in 
beds, and we write on tables and on desks. Were 
it not for habit, what a painful process it would 
be to learn the use of a telephone each time we 
desired to use it! A man that has formed the 
habit of pressing a button beside a table in his 
club, if he desires a bell boy, will experience actual 
discomfort if he is a visitor in a club where bell 
boys are called in another fashion. As an evi- 
dence of habits formed in that way, consider the 
difficulty many persons have in sleeping in Pull- 
man cars. They have formed the habit of sleep- 
ing in their own beds, which have a certain degree 
of softness or of hardness, and which have pillows 
of a certain thickness and ease. When these con- 
ditions are changed, and especially when there are 
added to these special differences the inclosed 
space, the motion of the train and the noise, the 
new combination frequently overcomes the physi-
-P-A-G-E-19
  
WHAT IS RE-EDUCATION? 11 
ological necessity of sleep. These things act as 
stimuli against sleep; they interfere with special 
habits. Some persons have not formed the habit 
of sleeping in one place under one set of condi- 
tions. They travel extensively and their physio- 
logical need for sleep is not adversely influenced 
by hardness of the bed, by the size of the pillow, 
by noise or by other slight variations from what 
most persons consider the normal. They are able 
to sleep on a hard bench or on the ground, they 
sleep in a narrow berth on a steamship, or equally 
well in an upper or a lower Pullman berth. 
Consider how in writing a letter we have the 
habit of saying: ‘‘My dear sir,’’ ‘‘Yours truly,’’ 
“Respectfully yours,’? and so on. All these 
verbal forms are of an habitual nature; they are 
not dictated by intellect. The writer may despise 
him whom he addresses as ‘‘dear sir.’’ He may 
feel nothing but contempt for the man to whom he 
writes ‘‘respectfully yours.’”’ But he has the 
habit of beginning and of ending a letter in that 
fashion, and thus he writes it. One lifts his hat 
when he meets a woman acquaintance. He salutes 
his superior officers. He offers his arm to a 
woman companion. He does these things because 
it is his habit to do them. So an individual has 
an habitual manner of addressing different per- 
sons under varying conditions. He may say 
“How are you?’’ or ‘‘How do you do?’’ or 
“Hello.” Some men have the habit of saying 
“Ah, there!’’ by way of greeting. It is all a 
matter of habit. 
Whether a child learns to speak English or 
Chinese is a matter of the reception of certain 
   
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
stimuli which bring about the special habits. The 
speech mechanisms of a Chinese baby and of an 
American baby are essentially the same. The Ori- 
ental and Occidental manners of speech vary ac- 
cording to the habits that are formed. But not 
only is the kind of language a habit, but most of 
our daily conversation also consists of a collection 
of special vocal habits. We say those words we 
have frequently said before; we use phrases to 
which we are accustomed. Habit, then, not only 
forces us to speak English, French, Chinese or 
Pali, but it also regulates or compels our intona- 
tions and our utilization or non-utilization of cer- 
tain words and phrases. One group of Americans 
is noted for its nasal twang; in other words for its 
habit of so using the vocal apparatus that this 
special intonation is apparent. This manner of 
speaking can be corrected or replaced by a non- 
nasal speech by suitable practice. A new habit 
can be formed—there can be re-education—so 
that the speech approaches that which is called 
normal. Another group of our people is noted 
for a drawl, but this also gives way to a more 
normal manner of speech if attention is directed 
to the production of this habit. Expression also 
is habitual. A man learns to swear, and he uses 
oaths of all kinds to begin, to fill in and to end all 
his sentences. Colloquialisms and provincialisms 
also are matters of habit; they disappear when 
new and more conventional habits are formed. 
Even modes of thought move along paths of 
habit. The physician, habitually looking for them, 
sees pathological conditions everywhere. His at- 
tention is directed to abnormalities—a cough of a
-P-A-G-E-21
WHAT IS RE-EDUCATION? 13 
certain character, a limp, a peculiar expression of 
listening. Many of the things to which he pays 
attention do not attract the attention of the lay- 
man. The machinist has his own habitual methods 
of thought. He considers an engine in terms of 
materials and finish and the methods used to pro- 
duce the object. A humorist can pick out of a 
situation certain elements lost to the majority. 
An experienced newspaper man views an accident 
or a crime or a fire in terms of a ‘‘story.’’ Hach 
has his own habit of thought and applies it to 
every situation. If for any reason the physician 
or the machinist or the newspaper man is com- 
pelled to give up his special work and adopt 
another vocation, he must learn the habits of 
action and of thought appropriate to his new occu- 
pation. The one-time physician who becomes a 
business executive can no longer react to skin 
colors, or to limps, or to other indications of path- 
ological conditions. He is re-educated to think in 
terms of work-hours, or of work-hour-tons, or of 
overhead costs and the like. And the humorist 
cannot be successful as a lawyer if he retains his 
habit of selecting the bizarre and of pointing out 
the unexpected; he must form the habit of looking 
at a case in a different fashion. The physician 
changed into a business executive may retain a 
certain number of his former professional habits 
and the humorist who has been graduated into the 
law may still retain his ability to tell a funny story 
or to make a joke, but neither of these men can 
successfully follow his new calling and retain all 
his old habits. Some of his habits must be 
replaced by others. 
   
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
So much for the education of so-called normal 
individuals. The same principle of habit forma- 
tion obtains in the re-education of the abnormal. 
For instance, the problem that confronts the man 
who has lost his right arm by amputation near 
the shoulder is that of forming a number of new 
habits that will compensate for the loss. All the 
useful habits of the lost arm must be replaced by 
other habits if he is to approach his normal unin- 
jured condition. Some are replaced by the forma- 
tion of habits of using an artificial arm and others 
by the utilization of the left arm and hand. The 
use of an orthopedic appliance, such as an arti- 
ficial arm, involves the learning of many new 
adjustments. Some appliances have been so in- 
geniously constructed that the defects due to an 
amputation near the shoulder can be overcome, 
even to the use of fingers. One of these artificial 
arms, constructed and used under the direction of 
the eminent French re-educator, Amar, permits 
the patient to use a typewriter, play billiards, and 
make many other fine adjustments. It is im- 
portant, however, to realize that these fine move- 
ments are acquired only after a long period of 
practice. New habits must be acquired. The 
many straps and connections on this arm are 
manipulated by movements of the muscles of the 
shoulder girdle, of the neck, and of the other arm. 
There is here a functional replacement in which 
the groups of large muscles learn to move in a 
fixed way, in other words their habitual manner 
of reaction is replaced by a new habit. The Amar 
arm is useful for only a few individuals. The 
time required to learn the use of this appliance is
-P-A-G-E-23
WHAT IS RE-EDUCATION? 15 
long. In many cases it is realized that the finer 
movements are relatively unimportant, and in 
these latter cases use is made of much simpler ap- 
pliances. The grosser forms of adjustment can 
be learned in a short time. This is especially true 
of those efforts toward providing re-education for 
certain kinds of work, such as farming. The use 
of a spade, the driving of a horse, the direction of 
a plow require steady but not fine movements, and 
an artificial arm with a hook or with a claw can be 
substituted for the more elaborate arm which is 
needed for typewriting. 
But even if many habits are regained for the 
lost arm by the use of an orthopedic appliance, it 
takes too long to acquire many important habits 
involving the finer movements. Some habits that 
depend on fine codrdination—such as those in- 
volving use of the fingers—must be replaced in 
another. way. It is impossible to adjust many 
artificial arms so that they can compensate for all 
purpose of the lost arm. It becomes necessary to 
train the remaining hand and arm to perform 
these delicate operations which are most needed. 
This kind of education takes less time than that of 
the utilization of a complex artificial hand and 
arm, and is most frequently attempted. The man 
then learns to use his left hand for the perform- 
ance of those acts in which he formerly used both 
hands, and for those acts in which he formerly 
used the right hand. He learns to button his 
clothing, to tie his shoes and to open his purse. 
Many other common daily tasks are carried out 
with a surprising degree of speed and accuracy 
by his new adjustments. 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
This represents one type of re-education—the 
type in which there has been anatomical loss. 
Re-education in this sense is the formation of a 
new set of habits by one side or by one part of 
the body to take the place of old habits that were 
lost because of the loss of another part of the 
body. This type of re-education takes place also 
in a number of cases of paralysis. 
/ In the re-education of persons with speech de- 
fects an attempt is made to teach the individual 
who speaks badly, who stammers or stutters, to 
replace the old habit of speech by a habit more 
normal. This is done by correcting the defects 
due to nervousness, by showing the individual the 
normal, correct manner of placing his lips and 
tongue to form certain sounds, and by requiring 
him to form new habits of a correct kind, and by 
forming the habits of codrdination of respiratory 
with tongue and lip movements. In this case re- 
education involves the production of a good habit 
to replace a bad or an ineffective habit. 
Persons suffering from aphasia—loss of the 
speech function—must also be re-educated if they 
are to be comfortable and useful. In these cases 
the process is similar to that of the education of a 
young child who has not already learned to speak. 
In reality the aphasic condition is nearly like that 
of the infant, with the notable exception that the 
aphasic has been able to speak at one time and 
has lost this ability. The aphasic must be taught 
anew to use his speech muscles in the proper ways. 
He must also acquire habits of coérdination of 
these muscles, so that his vocalization corresponds 
with that of normal persons. He must learn that

“‘ou-ey.’? He must form the habit of speech reac- 
tion practically from the beginning, knitting or 
combining the movements of his vocal apparatus 
so that he emits sounds which are recognized by 
others. 
Brief mention may also be made here of the 
principle of re-education with another abnormal 
class—that of the insane. A careful analysis 
forces us to conclude that insanity is in essentials 
the condition or conditions in which certain habits 
normal to persons of the indivdual’s station and 
class are lost, or in which the habits of reacting of 
that individual are replaced by bizarre or per- 
verted habits. In other words, an individual is 
insane when his reactions or behavior differ from 
the normal. The individual becomes well, or he 
makes a social recovery, whenever his habits be- 
come like those of his own class and station. The 
re-education of the insane depends entirely, there- 
fore, upon the replacement of bad, perverted, pe- 
culiar, slovenly and unsocial methods of reaction 
by habits which are social and conventional. 
In simple terms, then, the principle of re-educa- 
tion is that of habit formation. It is either a re- 
placement of old, inadequate, or harmful methods 
of reacting with new habits more like those of the 
other individuals in his environment, or it is the 
formation of new habits to take the place of those 
that have been lost. In other words, re-education 
is to the abnormal what education is to the normal 
—it is a matter of the acquisition of habits that 
will enable the individual to take his place in the 
working, playing, social world.

  CHAPTER II 
THE FOUNDATION OF HABITS. 
In order to appreciate better the application of 
the principle of habit formation to re-education, 
it is advisable to know how certain habits are 
formed, and some of the conditions which affect 
habit formation. Much of the knowledge we have 
acquired on normal individuals may be applied to 
those conditions of the abnormal which require re- 
education. Much of the published work on this 
subject deals with the formation of habits of rela- 
tively simple characters. Much of it, which is 
very instructive, also deals with habit formation 
in simpler organisms—animals. The results of 
the studies on the formation of habits in animals 
are important in an investigation of the much 
more complex organism—man. They are also im- 
portant because the consideration of the simple 
habits leads to a better understanding of the far 
more complex habits that man must form. 
Habit has been defined as ‘‘a new form of ad- 
justment acquired during the lifetime of an in- 
dividual. ’’ This excludes such forms of activity 
as instincts and those simple, congenitally present 
reactions which are called reflexes. Every activ- 
ity of an animal requires a stimulus (sometimes 
producing a sensation) which sets off a reaction 
(which is sometimes glandular, but most fre- 
18 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
THE FOUNDATION OF HABITS 19 
quently a movement). It is the constant junction 
or the combination of a special reaction with a 
special stimulus that is properly known as a habit. 
There are, therefore, two main elements in the 
(habit—the sensory and the motor. 
When we carefully examine an individual we 
find that the habits exhibited are of different 
characters. This has already been seen in the 
preceding chapter, in which habits of dressing, 
habits of thought and habits of other characters 
have been mentioned. Not only do the habits of 
a man differ according to the special goal— 
whether the motor response is one for personal 
pleasure (such as dressing as a protection against 
cold) or for social purposes (such as those as- 
sociated with meetings or the theater)—but they 
also differ according as the emphasis is placed on 
the thing that sets off the reaction, or on the actual 
reaction itself. Because of this two great types 
of habits are usually described, the motor and the 
sensory. In essentials these two are the same; 
they differ only according to the direction of the 
emphasis placed upon the ‘‘acquired adjustment.’’ 
The motor habit is a mode of reaction of a cer- 
tain definite character to a certain kind of stimu- 
lus. Thus, we have learned to turn the handle of 
a door away from the door casing, regardless of 
the special shape of the handle. / The sensory habit 
is a mode of reaction in which the movement or 
other activity is considered to be associated with 
one stimulus rather than with another. It is con- 
ceivable that the sight of a large dog might bring 
about the same reaction of running away as does 
that of a wolf of similar size, but the discrimina-  
-P-A-G-E-28
20 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
tion of these two stimuli usually is made, and the 
resulting reactions differ. The emphasis is here 
placed on the discrimination rather than on the 
movement. 
The differences are well illustrated by the reac- 
tions of different animals which are placed in a 
certain environment that gives a definite or fairly 
definite stimulus. Since many observations are 
at hand respecting the habit reactions of cats, let 
us consider briefly these animals as examples. If 
a cat is placed in a box so constructed that the re- 
actions of the animal may be observed, but from 
which it cannot escape except by the manipulation 
of a specially arranged adjustment, the cat goes 
through a variety of activities. These are largely 
of the nature of instinctive attempts to escape 
from the inclosed space. The animal scratches 
the bars, or bites them, or scratches the door or 
the cover, or bites any projecting portion inside 
the box. We say it attempts to escape from the 
uncomfortable situation of confinement. Eventu- 
ally in its instinctive but rather random move- 
ments—random as far as the immediate result of 
escape is concerned—a movement is performed 
which is followed by the opening of the door of the 
box. The fact that the door is opened may not, 
however, be appreciated by the animal for some 
seconds after this has occurred. The first time the 
test is made with an animal escape may not re- 
sult in less than ten minutes. If the experiment 
is repeated it is observed that more of the ac- 
tivities of the cat are directed against the door 
and the immediate neighborhood of the door. If 
the opening of the door can be brought about by
-P-A-G-E-29
    21 
  THE FOUNDATION OF HABITS 
  the manipulation of some mechanism near the 
door the cat may open the door relatively soon in 
the second experiment. The time of opening the 
door in subsequent trials gradually becomes less 
until after thirty to forty trials the animal ex- 
ecutes the certain movement almost immediately 
it is placed in the box. 
The final, or what may be called the purposeful, 
movement need not have any direct relation to the 
means of escape, such as the door or cover or any 
part through which the cat may get out. The 
movement may be as far removed from the situa- 
tion of the confinement as the experimenter 
wishes. The experimenter may predetermine 
that he himself will open the door when the ani- 
mal seratches itself. A habit of this character can 
readily be formed, provided there is a suitable in- 
stinctive basis in the animal and also a suitable re- 
ward or a desired end to be attained. It is well 
to keep in mind that the two habits which have 
been mentioned—the opening of a door by a 
nearby mechanism and the opening of the door 
by the execution of a movement not apparently 
related to the result—may not be acquired equally 
readily. It has been found easy to produce a 
habit when the movement is one fairly definitely 
associated with the means of escape. It is usually 
more difficult to produce a habit in which the re- 
sult (in the case under discussion this is escape) 
is not closely associated with the movement. 
Furthermore, the experiments with cats show 
very well that the same situation may result in 
different habits. A good example of this is with 
respect to the activities of different cats in a box,     
                              
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
the door of which can be opened by moving a 
string which is attached to a latch. One cat 
learned to do this by arching its back and by rub- 
bing against the string, thus exerting enough pres- 
sure to move the latch. A second animal acquired 
the habit of biting and pulling the string, and a 
third cat clawed and pulled the string. All these 
are motor habits. Hach animal has learned to 
move in a special way when it receives certain 
stimuli (the sight and the feel of the particular 
box) and the special habit which is produced de- 
pends upon the instinctive reactions of the parti- 
cular animal. 
The sensory reaction differs in only one respect 
from the motor reaction. Here, as has been men- 
tioned, the emphasis is placed upon the discrim- 
ination of sensory stimuli. Thus, the cat may be 
placed in a box so constructed or operated that 
the door will not open unless certain conditions 
are fulfilled which are not obviously related to the 
movement. Or, to put the matter in other words, 
the movement of pressing a button or pulling a 
string will not open the door unless a red card is 
simultaneously exhibited at the right hand side of 
the box. If a green card is at the right hand side 
of the box no amount of pulling the string or pres- 
sing a button will result in the opening of the door, 
nor will this result be obtained if either of the 
colored cards be at the left hand side of the box. 
The appropriate movement is efficacious only 
when there is this other special condition. The 
habit is said to be formed when the animal makes 
the appropriate movement only when the red card 
is in the correct position. In this case there is
-P-A-G-E-31
  
THE FOUNDATION OF HABITS 23 
some kind of sensory discrimination—‘‘red card, 
right,’’ as distinct from ‘‘red card, left,’’ ‘‘green 
eard, right’’ and ‘‘green card, left.’? Such dis- 
crimination need not be made in actual verbal or 
ideation terms, but if the appropriate reaction 
follows one special stimulus rather than many we 
call the process a sensory habit. 
A third type of habit is sometimes described 
and differentiated. This is the delayed reaction 
habit. This type does not differ in any essential 
respect from the sensory and the motor. In many, 
perhaps most, of the motor and sensory habits, 
the reaction follows the stimulus immediately. In 
the delayed reaction habit the reaction does not 
follow directly upon the stimulus. A little con- 
sideration serves to show that all habit reactions 
are somewhat delayed. In some cases the delay 
is great, but in the motor and sensory habits the 
delay of the movement after the stimulus may be 
only a second or two. It is, however, sometimes 
a convenience to contrast the delayed reaction 
habit with the more direct habits. This type is 
frequent in human conduct. It can be illustrated 
by the action of the man who has learned to use 
a dictionary or encyclopedia. When in his read- 
ing he encounters a word or a statement of an 
historical event he may not have his dictionary or 
encyclopedia at hand, but at a subsequent time 
he does consult one or the other. When the ex- 
perimenter with cats determines beforehand that 
he will not permit an animal to make a movement 
directly a stimulus is given, but will permit the 
animal to react only after an interval, let us say 
five or ten seconds, he tries to produce a delayed
-P-A-G-E-32
    24 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
reaction habit. In a case like this it has been 
found that the habit is not produced as readily as 
are those habits in which the reaction follows the 
stimulus immediately. The application of this 
knowledge to the production of human habits is 
important. 
It has been found that differences in the re- 
quired movement, the distant or close relation- 
ship of the movement to a. particular stimulus, and 
the delay in the response will affect the rapidity 
of habit formation. Other factors are also of im- 
portance. When the adjustments are fine and nu- 
merous and when the sequence of movements is 
intricate a habit is acquired only after a consid- 
erable period of practice. When the movements 
are relatively gross and few, and in direct relation 
to a particular event, habits are learned quickly. 
Let us consider such a situation when the object 
is escape from a box. If the door is pushed, re- 
sulting in the opportunity for escape, this pushing 
of the door is in direct relation to the desired re- 
sult. The movement is also relatively simple and 
gross. When the door is released only by a de- 
finite combination and sequence of movements, 
such as (a) pushing a button at the back of the 
box, (b) pulling a string at the corner opposite 
the door, and (c) standing upon a raised platform 
in the box, the habit is formed slowly. Some ani- 
mals within the limits of the experiment cannot 
learn this indirect, complex, delayed reaction 
habit. 
It must also be recognized that the apparent 
difficulties of movements are not the same for all 
individuals. Some persons are able to execute  
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE FOUNDATION OF HABITS 25 
finely codrdinated movements as readily as others 
execute larger and grosser types. The difficulties 
of movement bring about differences in the rapid- 
ity of formation of habits. This is especially 
noteworthy in dealing with pathological material, 
such as diseased human beings. Moreover, it 
must also be borne in mind in re-education work 
that a disease does not always produce exactly 
the same deficiencies and difficulties. One patient 
with a paralysis may be different physiologically 
from another patient who superficially appears 
to have the same defects. 
Certain reported facts are helpful to us in esti- 
mating the best means of bringing about the de- 
sired results in the formation of habits. To return 
to the facts in animal experimentation it has been 
shown, for example, that if certain animals of the 
same heredity and of the same age are given the 
opportunity of forming the same habit the 
rapidity with which the habit is formed differs in 
accordance with the number of trials given. With 
white rats placed in a simple maze it was found 
that one group given one trial a day learned to 
go through, in other words formed the habit, in 
seventeen days. Those given three trials a day 
took only nine days, and those that had five trials 
a day learned in eight days. It was also found 
that a similar group given only one trial every 
second day took thirty-two days for the forma- 
tion of the habit, and another group, having one 
trial every third day, required thirty-nine days to 
learn it. This illustrates very well that the fre- 
quency of the trials or of the efforts is a potent 
factor in the production of a habit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  26 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
On the other hand, these figures illustrate that 
there is the possibility of wasting time in attempt- 
ing to produce habits under certain conditions. It 
is obvious that the animals that learned the habit 
in eight days had forty tests before they acquired 
it, while those that had one trial a day learned in 
seventeen tests and those that had but one trial 
every third day acquired the habit after thirteen 
tests. It is possible that by permitting an animal 
to have 150 to 200 trials in one day a habit could 
be acquired in that one day. In such a case the 
amount of time, in minutes and hours, spent in 
the formation of the habit is entirely out of pro- 
portion to the time used if the animal is given one 
trial each day. We may look at the rapidity of 
habit formation in these two ways. If speed in 
days be the desideratum, there may be as many 
trials a day as are within the animal’s or the 
man’s limit of fatigue or endurance. If, how- 
ever, it be desired to have the habits produced 
with the least amount of effort, the trials may be 
separated by relatively long intervals of time 
(days or hours). It appears that there may be 
a limit in both directions. If the individual trials 
follow one another too rapidly, mental and physi- 
eal fatigue may be produced and the formation 
of the habit be interfered with. If, on the other 
hand, the time between successive trials is too 
great, the man may not get acquainted with the 
situation, or may forget what he has previously 
done, and each successive trial may be almost the 
same as a perfectly new one. The optimum condi- 
tion probably is one in which the habit can be 
formed with the least effort in the least number
-P-A-G-E-35
THE FOUNDATION OF HABITS 27 
of days, without deleterious fatigue. What this 
optimism is for different habits is yet to be dis- 
covered. In all the applications of the principle 
of habit formation to human individuals the two 
conditions just mentioned must be kept in mind, 
and for each patient worked with a judgment must 
be made, even though this judgment is not based 
entirely on scientifically demonstrated results. 
Another element upon which habit formation 
depends is the recency of the stimulus. Here we 
deal with the so-called delayed reaction. If the 
reaction be very much delayed the habit is very 
hard to form. The reaction must follow the stim- 
ulus closely if rapidity in habit formation is to 
be desired. 
The retention of habits may be considered 
briefly here, since to be of value a habit must be 
retained for some time after the training period; 
in other words, the reaction must follow the stim- 
ulus as a regular event whenever the stimulus 
is given. This is the case after as well as during 
the so-called period of training. In the production 
of habits in animals, and even in children, certain 
arbitrary limits have been placed upon the special 
training periods. In some cases it is assumed the 
habit is acquired if the animal performs the ap- 
propriate movement in three or four successive 
trials within two or three seconds after the stim- 
ulus has been given. In children the arbitrary 
rule in school is much the same. In order that 
the habit reactions may come with more predict- 
able regularity and with less variations in speed, 
it is customary to give practice to the individual 
beyond this point of learning. When this is done, 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
it is called over-training. Over-training results in 
having the habit firmly fixed, so that after, let us 
say, an interval of a year, the special movement 
will follow the special stimulus. In such an event 
the habit becomes like a reflex. If, however, the 
amount of training is only that which just suffices 
to make the reaction follow the stimulus, the habit 
may not be evidenced in the same situation after 
an interval of twenty or thirty days or even three 
or four days. Those speech habits called ‘‘cram- 
ming’’ are examples of this. The student forms 
the habit, by constant repetition for a day or two 
—‘‘Discovery of America, 1492,’’ or ‘‘Franco- 
Prussian War, 1870,’’—and is able to reproduce 
these; he has the appropriate reaction to the stim- 
ulus for a short time (perhaps only twelve hours). 
Certain habits persist even though the special 
stimuli leading to the reactions have not been en- 
countered for some time. These are all habits in 
which there has been over-learning. Thus, for 
example, a man may be able to skate ten or twelve 
years after he has ceased to practice this accom- 
plishment. It is true that the movements may 
have lost some of their accuracy, speed and force, 
but they are still present in sequence, and in 
sufficient accuracy to show the persistence of the 
habit. So one may retain the habit of making the 
proper strokes in billiards, although the accur- 
acy of execution is lost in the years without prac- 
tice. After years without a piano, an individual 
may sit at one and play a selection he learned long 
before. He may not play it as smoothly or as ac- 
curately, but there remains the habit of making 
one movement after another, in a certain direction
-P-A-G-E-37
     THE FOUNDATION OF HABITS 29 
and of a certain amount. The inaccuracy is due 
to the failure of habit in a fine way; failures in 
sequence, failures in force and failures in extent 
of the response. One may retain the habits of 
speech of his childhood after many years in an- 
other land. On returning to his childhood home 
his selection of sentences and ideas may not be as 
smooth as it was, but the speech habit itself is 
retained. In habits of this sort, it is important 
to note, there usually is a loss in one or more of 
three conditions—directness, fineness and speed. 
Thus, for example, an individual who has not 
spoken French for years may respond to a French- 
man in French after framing to himself his reply 
in English; that is a loss of directness. The habit 
of playing a certain selection on the piano per- 
sists, but the music is halting and not nearly per- 
fect—the fingers do not always strike the right 
keys; that is a loss of fineness. After a long ab- 
sence from his machine the typist finds the keys 
readily by habit, but ‘he is unable to write as 
rapidly as formerly; that is a loss of speed, 
The previous training and the general capabil- 
ity of the individual must be considered for any 
kind of job and they have special importance in 
re-education. For instance, one who has learned 
to dance acquires the habit of performing a new 
dance much more readily than one who never has 
learned any sort of dance. The Russians are 
reputed to have notable ability to learn languages. 
If it be so, it is because they have the habit of 
learning languages. A person that has many 
habits has a greater possibility of response to a 
new situation. The more habits an individual has
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
acquired the greater his capability for learning 
yet more habits; he has that which might be called 
a situation reaction. He has an ability to react 
in a general way to many classes of situations 
that present conditions in some ways like those to 
which he has acquired an habitual reaction. He 
has learned to eliminate extraneous movements, 
for he recognizes in a situation a condition that 
calls for a reaction of a general kind, and he cuts 
out the unnecessary steps in reaching the result. 
Thus the cat, once it has learned that it can re- 
lease itself from a box by pulling a string in front 
of the door, will eliminate the scratching and bit- 
ing and searching that preceded its escape in its 
first attempts. In other boxes it directs its efforts 
at once to the door, finding easily in the new situa- 
tion the latch or button that opens the way. 
In education—and thus in re-education—we 
should seek to produce a considerable number of 
situation reactions. We are not concerned en- 
tirely, and perhaps not primarily, with teaching 
the paralytic to use his fingers to grasp a knife and 
a fork. We seek to re-educate his fingers and 
arms so that they will react properly to situations, 
to a razor, to a towel, to a hoe or to a pen. 
This re-education, and all education, is possible, 
however, only if the subject is willing to undergo 
it. The child is sometimes forced to attend school 
and to learn his lessons because of fear of punish- 
ment. He is forced to form habits of cleanliness 
because of a desire to escape the pain or the dis- 
comfort of a whipping. He also forms habits of 
eating from a plate and of using a knife and fork 
and spoon because of his desire for food, and thus 
   
-P-A-G-E-39
THE FOUNDATION OF HABITS 31 
of escaping the discomfort and pain of hunger. 
The usual incentives for a young child to form 
habits are those connected with an avoidance of 
pain. These are incentives which are part of the 
more general tendency acting for self-presevation. 
A second general incentive toward habit form- 
ation is that of sex in its widest meaning. It is 
more usual to speak of these incentives as social. 
As a usual thing this is evident later in life, when 
the desire for freedom from the restraint of par- 
ental authority and the desire to have a home for 
one’s self, as well as the special sexual impulses, 
act as supplemental stimuli in education. The 
wish to be independent, that to ‘‘do as one 
pleases,’’ is a powerful reinforcement to acquire 
those habits which will enable the individual to 
be self-supporting and capable of supporting a 
family. 
These two incentives, self-preservation and sex, 
the personal and the social, must also be made use 
of in re-education. Much attention has recently 
been directed to the mental attitude of helpless- 
ness, of dependence, and of hopelessness, which 
frequently accompanies disease. In some cases 
it has been found an easy matter to replace this 
attitude by one of effort and endeavor, of a desire 
for independence, and of willingness and confi- 
dence and optimism. This latter attitude can al- 
ways be produced and fostered by proper direc- 
tion of the patient’s attention to those two well- 
springs of habit—that of personal advantage and 
welfare, and that of social prosperity.

CHAPTER III 
    
              
     
                      MENTAL ATTITUDE AND INCENTIVE. 
The production of a sound, normal mental atti- 
tude in the patient must have a primary place in 
all re-education work. It is an integral part of 
rehabilitation in all-its stages. An attitude of 
hope and helpfulness must be instilled at the start. 
A will to get well must be created if it does not 
exist. It must be developed as the re-education 
goes on, and it must be firmly established if the 
patient is to attain the mark at which he is en- 
couraged to aim—total victory over the conditions 
that disable him. 
A patient without hope, discouraged by his 
physical abnormalities or disabilities and resent- 
ful of the agency that produced them, is a difficult 
patient. He complains bitterly against a world 
that has dealt hard with him, and from railing at 
conditions in general he falls into the habit of 
railing at things more specific—his food, his treat- 
ment, his bed, his environment. The discouraged 
and hopeless patient believes nothing can help 
him. He cannot see the value of curative work 
in the process of re-education. Hach time some- 
thing is done for him, each time treatment is pre- 
seribed, he asks himself, ‘‘What good will this 
do?’? And always he answers himself, ‘This 
will do me no good.’’ He feels he is helpless, and 
32

                                                               ee f 
MENTAL ATTITUDE AND INCENTIVE = 33 
it may almost be said he has reached a stake at 
which he ‘‘doesn’t want to get well. ’’ Some such 
patients even reach a stage at which they take a 
sort of morose pleasure in their abnormalities, 
and they would probably regret a sudden func- 
tional restoration. 
When the patient is a mental case, when the 
abnormality is a psychosis dominated by depres- 
sion, the helplessness and the hopelessness are 
much beyond those of the physically incapacitated 
patient. -In such a case the removal of the de- 
pression, if that can be accomplished, results in 
the complete restoration of the individual. In 
such an individual the depression is often ac- 
companied by the belief that he is unworthy of 
any attention, and that he should not take up the 
time or have the benefit of the advice of his physi- 
cians, his teachers and his friends. 
There is the listless patient who feels sorry for 
himself and awaits only the day when it all will 
end. He wants to do nothing; he will not exert 
himself to the slightest degree if he can help it. 
He may do the things he is told to do—exercises 
to bring about his restoration, for example—but, 
if so, he does them with the idea of finishing a 
disagreeable task, not with the thought of helping 
himself. Perhaps during the time he is receiving 
the treatment no thought of recovery enters his 
mind; he gives little heed to the thing in hand. 
What is accomplished with a patient of this class 
is done without his codperation and frequently 
against his active opposition. 
Of course very many patients refuse to be dis- 
couraged. They refuse to consider themselves 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  34 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
doomed to a life of helplessness. They strive to- 
return to normal, useful ways of living and exert 
every physical and mental means to assist those 
persons who are trying to re-educate them. Not 
infrequently they refuse to consider that they are 
temporarily incapacitated. They plan optimis- 
tically for the day when they shall return to the 
world of activity. These men of fighting spirit 
have the mental attitude that must be developed 
or fostered in the others. And often the hopeful 
patient, by his optimism and his refusal to accept 
his deficiencies as permanent disabilities, is one 
of the chief agents in the mental re-education of 
his discouraged comrades. He can be made a 
most helpful adjutant to the restoration of his 
more depressed companions. On the other hand 
it must be recognized that too great optimism is 
likely to lead to a reverse condition. If the opti- 
mist is permitted to retain too much assurance, 
and he fails to get well as quickly and completely 
as he expected, he is very likely to become de- 
pressed. With such an individual, however, a lit- 
tle, a very little, cautioning may tend to prevent 
an exaggerated expectation. 
Most patients are keen to take in everything 
that pertains to their conditions, and this keen- 
ness, egoism in a way, may result in their listen- 
ing to physicians, nurses, visitors and friends dis- 
cuss their chances of recovery. A discussion of 
the patient’s chances of recovery by his physician 
may have a good or bad effect. If in the presence 
of the patient the physician tells a nurse or a 
colleague that the patient’s condition is unfavor- 
able, the words need not be heard, the facial ex-
-P-A-G-E-43
MENTAL ATTITUDE AND INCENTIVE 35 
pression and the reactions of the listeners are 
usually sufficient to produce an unfavorable atti- 
tude. Many a patient has been discouraged by the 
words of his physician at the very beginning of 
his disability. A physician may tell a man who 
has been paralyzed because of a cerebral hem- 
orrhage that he never will walk again. The state- 
ment that the paralyzed leg never can regain its 
functions remains stamped in the patient’s mind; 
he comes to regard his condition as hopeless, and 
he makes no plans for a future in which he shall 
be able to walk again. ‘‘The doctor told me I 
couldn’t get well, and this will do me no good,’’ is 
his attitude toward all treatment. At last he 
reaches the point at which he can conceive nothing 
except a restricted life in an institution for the in- 
curable or as a helpless dependent. At times the 
physician’s casual remarks lead to marked mental 
disorder. The case of an officer in charge of an 
ambulance unit is an excellent example of this. 
He had been sent to a hospital near the front and 
there overheard his physician tell another ‘‘There 
is nothing the matter with him.’’ This led to the 
development of the delusion that he was to be 
shot. This idea arose by a course of reasoning 
somewhat as follows: ‘‘The doctor reports there 
is nothing the matter with me; I have reported 
sick; if they decide there is nothing the matter 
with me, they must think I am ‘faking’; this means 
court-martial, and I shall be shot.’’ Great care 
must be taken that nothing is said or done that can 
be adversely misinterpreted by the patient. In 
some instances the neglect to encourage the pa- 
tient is almost as potent in the production of an
-P-A-G-E-44
  386 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
improper attitude as is a direct statement. A 
conference of the family with the physician after 
the latter’s visit to the patient may be very harm- 
ful. The patient is suspicious that something he 
should know is being withheld from him. A de- 
ceptive optimism is a hundred fold more valuable 
than a pessimistic frankness, except in those rare 
instances in which the patient is too eager and 
rash. 
Many factors must be considered in a thoughtful 
attempt to overcome an indifferent or depressed 
attitude in the patient and to replace this by a 
sound mental attitude. Not all discouraged, 
hopeless or deluded men may be approached 
through the same channel. Different incentives 
must be used in different cases; in one man it 
may be a desire to support his family, in another 
it may be a desire for lost comforts, in another 
it may be a desire to escape ridicule, and in still 
another it may be a wish to be released from the 
eare of others. A thing that appeals to one man 
as a goal to be striven for may appear inconse- 
quential to another. It should be the first aim of a 
person attempting to produce a proper mental 
attitude in the patient to look for that incentive, 
or those incentives, having the greatest appeal to 
the particular patient. After the ambitions are 
known, they may be used in varying combinations, 
in various ways, and by direct and indirect ap- 
proach to bring about the desired result of interest 
and effort. 
The treatment itself may be made use of as an 
incentive. The patient should not be dealt with 
as if he were an incapable infant. He should be
-P-A-G-E-45
  
MENTAL ATTITUDE AND INCENTIVE 37 
given such occupation, exercise, or other treat- 
ment that he can appreciate, to some extent at 
least, as appropriate to him. The stringing of 
beads may be an occupation of value to the patient 
for the production of accuracy of movement and 
for training in speed and in concentration, but 
other tasks may be found which will appeal to 
him as more appropriate to his mental capacity 
and to his station in life. If he is capable of doing 
something useful, and if this useful occupation is 
as good for the patient as one which appears to 
him to be useless, the useful occupation should 
be prescribed for him. One danger exists in 
carrying out this general rule, a danger that is 
more frequent with depressed patients. This is, 
that slowness and inaccuracy in doing a simple 
useful task is sometimes more discouraging than 
an equal or greater degree of slowness and in- 
accuracy in doing an unaccustomed task or one 
that the patient considers to be useless. But this 
danger is usually more apparent than real. The 
advantages of demonstrating to the patient that 
he can be of use, and of increasing use, to him- 
self and to the world far outweigh the possible 
danger. Not only should tasks be set that the 
patient can see are not futile, but a goal should be 
set toward which the patient should strive. He 
should be asked to try to do a little more than he 
thinks he can do; he should be made to realize 
that the accomplishment of this task is expected. 
On the other hand, to set the goal too far away 
is a discouragment. Each day’s tasks should be 
complete in themselves as far as they can be made 
so. Much of the lack of success in getting patients 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
to weave rugs and to make raffia baskets is doubt- 
less due to the fact that the completion of the task 
is a matter of weeks rather than of hours. What 
is accomplished must be apparent to the patient. 
The satisfaction of the instructor that he has 
been able to get a patient to perform a certain 
task is of less importance than the satisfaction of 
the patient that he has accomplished something. 
The patient’s belief that he is improving is in 
most cases of far greater importance than the in- 
structor’s measurements. When interest wanes, 
the patient will complain that the task is too diffi- 
cult, and will often give it up. Therapeutic ex- 
ercises of a factory character are, therefore, of 
minor value. They have their place, and, they hold 
a very important position at times, when the 
proper attitude has been formed, but they tend to 
retard or even to prevent the formation of the 
right attitude if they are begun too soon and if 
they are used too exclusively. 
A patient must be taken away from the thought 
that the loss of a leg or the loss of its use has 
turned him into a thing of ridicule for the rest of 
his days. He must be educated to think of the 
day when he shall have gained a complete victory 
over his disability—when the paralyzed leg shall 
be ‘‘as good as new,’’ or the orthopedic appliance 
that replaces his lost leg shall fit into his life, the 
life of a healthy, able-bodied man. But ridicule 
may be properly used, in small doses, to help the 
patient toward an optimistic and rational atti- 
tude toward his disability, and the fear or dislike’ 
of ridicule may be utilized to stimulate the patient 
to greater efforts. A much more difficult, but|
-P-A-G-E-47
  MENTAL ATTITUDE AND INCENTIVE 39 
nevertheless a very important, matter is that of 
getting patients who are or have been insane or 
who have some form of neurosis or psychosis to 
take a suitable attitude toward their eventual re- 
covery and their return to normal social life. The 
complex of anticipated feelings of doubt of their 
own stability, of the possible ridicule of their 
neighbors, of shyness and of lack of initiative, is 
difficult to dispel. 
A factor of the utmost importance in producing 
one kind of mental attitude in the patient is the 
kind of hospital in which he is placed for treat- 
ment. Knowledge that they are confined in an 
institution devoted to the care of incurable in- 
dividuals is bound to have a depressing effect on 
many patients; if they are forced to live in the 
same wards in close association with these incur- 
able persons the effect is worse. The institution 
which hopes to bring about rehabilitation should 
be an institution of hope. It should be one in 
which its function is expressed by the question, 
‘““What can we do for the patient?’’ This includes 
the whole physical, mental and social welfare of 
the individual. Its function is also to be ex- 
pressed in the added questions: ‘‘What can we 
get the patient to do? What can the patient do 
for himself, what can he do for his family and 
what can he do for the community?’’ It is only an 
astigmatic, myopic, or perhaps an amblyopic, in- 
stitution that will dare to ask: ‘‘What can the 
patient do for us?’’ In other words, the im- 
provement and the care of its patient as the goal 
of the institution make for a more hopeful group 
of patients. Asylums for incurables, with their
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
emphasis on custodial care, may be needed for a 
few patients but they are more frequently relics 
of the dark ages. They deny the possibility of 
scientific advances and the patients are con- 
demned to them to await dissolution. 
So also perfunctory, indifferent men in the per- 
sonnel of the institution—men that view their 
work with the patients as a ‘‘job’’ and seek only 
to perform their work with as little effort as 
possible—may destroy the morale of even a nat- 
urally hopeful, helpful patient. The hospital to 
which men in need of re-education are sent should 
be permeated with a spirit of hope. The instruc- 
tors who have the greatest measure of responsi- 
bility for the recovery or non-recovery of the 
patients should be willing men capable of trans- 
mitting to their charges the optimism and hope 
they themselves must feel. And as a gloomy, dis- 
pirited personnel and hospital may retard or 
make impossible a recovery, so may good sur- 
roundings and helpful instructors hasten a cure. 
The manner of finding incentives for recovery 
and producing the proper mental attitude in pa- 
tients in the actual process of re-education is per- 
haps as variable as the combinations of individual 
characteristics of the patients. One man may 
desire to recover so he can marry; another may 
desire to get well so that he can support his par- 
ents; another may wish to return to his wife and 
children; another’s chief interest may be his for- 
mer occupation. There may be a combination of 
desires, and from whatever desires or desire are 
foremost the incentive may be developed. 
A direct appeal to reason may suffice to change
-P-A-G-E-49
  
MENTAL ATTITUDE AND INCENTIVE 41 
into a helpful patient one type of disabled man. 
The patient may be told that the physician who 
said the paralyzed leg never would function prop- 
erly again is not a specialist and knows little of 
these matters, and that the re-educator is a spe- 
cialist, who does know the case thoroughly, and 
will soon have the leg in ‘‘working order.’’ The 
specialist, or one who is reputed to be a specialist, 
has the best opportunity to cheer and encourage a 
disheartened patient. The specialist is consulted 
usually because other advisers do not know, or are 
believed not to know about the particular disease 
or injury. He comes to a patient with a created 
reputation of importance and knowledge and 
power, he is recognized as an expert, and the 
patient trusts and believes that benefit will result 
from the specialist’s advice. Such a recognized 
authority can gain the attention and can create a 
new attitude. He can explain, and he will more 
frequently be believed, that the patient merely has 
lost a habit, and that he will be cured—that he 
will have the use of his paralyzed leg again— 
as soon as he has regained that habit through a 
course of treatment such as he is about to receive. 
Many a patient must be taken into the confidence 
of the physician and have his abnormalities ex- 
plained. If a patient can be appealed to in this 
fashion he becomes of inestimable value in criti- 
cizing procedures, in suggesting new applications 
and in acting as a ‘‘cheerer up’’ of his less 
intelligent fellows. 
Indeed, the process of re-education should 
never be begun with the patient mentally blind- 
folded. He must be made to codperate with his
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
instructors, even though he may not be sufficiently 
intelligent to have his own case discussed thor- 
oughly and even though he may not be able to 
recognize the reason for each exercise, game, oc- 
cupation and other therapeutic measure. He must 
be encouraged by statements of his improvement. 
He must be shown in what ways the treatment he 
receives is improving his condition. If, as should 
always be done, accurate records of his perform- — 
ances are made, a statement of improvement be- 
comes not only a matter of general feeling or 
belief that the proper results are being obtained. 
but there is the possibility of a real demonstration 
of improvement in speed, or in strength, or in ex- 
tent or in accuracy of reaction. These records 
of performances will show at different times vary- 
ing degrees of improvement and will also show 
differences in improvement of different functions, 
but the patient need not be permitted to fall into 
periods of depression due to the fact that his pre- 
vious week’s improvement is slight. These rela- 
tively level periods have their meaning and their 
lesson and they should be explained. It is es- 
sential to keep before the patient not only the 
need of absolute victory, but also the fact that he 
is approaching absolute victory. In short, the 
patient must be shown that he is being helped. 
A patient may be made hopeful if he is told 
what others in his condition have accomplished. 
He may be told that other patients, in worse condi- 
tion than he, have recovered and now are earning’ 
their own livings. ‘‘If they could do it, I can,’’ he 
will say. A recovered individual may in many 
instances make a good instructor, not always in
-P-A-G-E-51
  MENTAL ATTITUDE AND INCENTIVE 48 
a scientific way, but by way of example. The ef- 
fect of having a recovered individual say to a 
patient, for example, ‘‘ My arm was like that once; 
in six weeks I was all right,’’ cannot be over- 
estimated. This can be used as an occasion for 
the development of an incentive of competition— 
the patient sets himself up as as good a man as 
he who has been cured, and strives to make his re- 
covery more rapid or more complete than that of 
the other individual. 
Amusements and games are invaluable means 
of taking a patient’s mind from his troubles and 
are remedies for depression. In the excitement of 
a game of baseball a paralyzed patient forgot the 
cane that had been his inseparable companion for 
nineteen years. After hitting the ball, without 
pausing to pick the cane from the ground he ran to 
first base in a successful attempt to ‘‘beat the 
throw.’’ How little he realized what he had done 
is evidenced by the fact that after reaching the 
base he demanded his cane, saying he could not 
run without it. In the excitement of the moment 
the man forgot that he was paralyzed; he was 
thinking of the game, not of his own disability. 
The patient in need of re-education must think of 
things outside his disabilities, and amusements 
and games provide these things to think about. 
Employment of various kinds has a similar effect, 
as has been said above, but care must be taken to 
avoid types of employment that are likely to make 
the patient believe he is being treated as a child 
and will never be able to do a man’s work. 
Proper friendships between patients should be 
encouraged. Talking to his bosom friend, a man 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
is taken out of himself; a man in need of re- 
education forgets his disabilities and talks of his 
life before he was injured. Patients who are 
mutually congenial will talk of better days that 
have gone and which, they are sure, will return. 
They compare notes on their improvement. Hach 
urges the other to exert himself toward the goal 
of absolute victory. They develop common in- 
terests and, therefore, subjects for conversation 
other than their disabilities. It is not good for 
the patient to be too much alone; he is too likely 
to dwell long and pessimistically on his troubles. 
Lack of acquaintances makes a man sullen and 
suspicious. The patient who feels no one is in- 
terested in him is likely to develop a state of mind 
in which he himself cares little whether or not 
he recovers. On the other hand, the feeling that 
other persons are watching him, hoping that he 
will be cured and expecting that he will regain 
his normal condition, is sure to produce an atti- 
tude of self-help. 
It is well, therefore, to secure the codperation 
of the patient’s family and of his community. Rel- 
atives who only bemoan the fate of a man in need 
of re-education, who pity him and regard him as 
a helpless burden, place a real obstacle in the way 
of his recovery. The family which encourages its 
patient-member, which makes with him plans for 
the day when he shall be ‘‘recovered,’’ which re- 
gards him as a potential asset instead of as a bur- 
den, and which codperates with the instructors in 
charge of the patient, is a potent factor in the 
eventual recovery. Such a family circle develops 
a pride in the patient; it makes him feel certain
-P-A-G-E-53
MENTAL ATTITUDE AND INCENTIVE 45 
he is going to get well; it makes him desire to get 
well, so that he can once again take his place in 
it. The attitude of the community is perhaps 
equally important. The country and the com- 
munity should look upon its disabled men as per- 
sons temporarily withdrawn from useful life but 
bound to return some day. It is now well recog- 
nized that returned soldiers in need of re-educa- 
tion should not be over-idolized; the community 
should let them know that it stands ready to give 
them the chance to become part of its life again, 
provided the patients make themselves fit. The 
community may recognize fully its debt to its dis- 
abled soldiers and civilians, but the method of 
paying that debt must be intelligently considered. 
There should not be a community attitude of will- 
ingness to assume the burden of supporting its 
disabled men, whether the disabilities result from 
war or from industry or from disease. The dis- 
abled man should be taught, if he has previously 
failed to learn this lesson, that he is one of the 
community, and that he as much as anyone else 
has a duty to perform. His duty, like that of his 
fellow men and women, is to do what he can, to 
strive to his utmost, to support himself and his 
family as well as he can, to uphold the State. In 
other words, his duty is the same as that of other 
good citizens.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE FORMATION OF HABITS. 
    
                                              In the previous section the problems of re- — 
education have been shown to be largely those of 
habit formation. Certain perverted habits must 
be replaced by habits which are more like those of 
the normal individuals in the community, and 
those habits which have been lost must be com- 
pensated for by newly formed habits. In general 
all habits are motor but for convenience it is possi- 
ble to divide the habits into three classes, only one 
of which is called motor. The second kind is 
called sensory, and the third is called a delayed 
reaction habit. The motor habit can be briefly 
described as that reaction which invariably fol- 
lows upon a given stimulus of one general char- 
acter. The sensory habit may be defined as that 
reaction which follows a stimulus of a definite 
character when that stimulus is differentiated 
from other stimuli which have the same general 
character. The delayed reaction habit is one in 
which the motor activity does not immediately fol- 
low the stimulus but it is delayed. The delay may 
be a half a second or one second, and in certain 
cases it may be as long as a day or a week. These 
kind of habits can be exemplified best for our 
present purposes by the activities that we carry 
out in our daily lives. 
49
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
The motor habit may be illustrated by those re- 
actions which we execute in the processes of dress- 
ing and eating. In dressing, we pay little atten- 
tion to the way in which the strings of our shoes 
are placed, that is we pay little attention to the 
direction and the amount of the strings projecting 
from the holes. We make the necessary adjust- 
ments immediately without having to judge con- 
sciously how much and in what direction the pull 
has to be made. In eating we do not consciously 
discriminate and bother with the visual differ- 
ences in knives, one with a steel blade and one 
which is silver, or one with an ivory handle and 
one with a metal handle. We pick up the imple- 
ment and use it regardless of how much it may 
differ from other knives which we have handled 
in the past. 
In the sensory habit we have the process of 
discrimination which is the main factor. In daily 
life this kind of habit is best illustrated by certain 
social activities like those of meeting people in 
the street. As we walk about in a crowded sec- 
tion of the city we see hundreds, but when we meet 
a certain individual whom we have met before un- 
der certain circumstances we either lift our hats 
or we stop and shake hands. The visual stimulus 
of the individual has been discriminated from the 
visual stimuli of the other pedestrians, i. e., as 
being different from the visual stimuli of all of 
the other individuals whom we have seen. 
The delayed reaction habit may be illustrated 
also by an activity which is common. That of 
letter writing is an excellent example. A letter is 
received in the morning, it is read but put on one
-P-A-G-E-59
i THE FORMATION OF HABITS 51 
side because of a telephone call or in order to 
read other mail which has also been received. The 
original stimulus which we have received may lead 
to an appropriate reaction, a telephone call or a 
written reply, the day after or a week later, or 
perhaps no reaction of these kinds is called forth. 
All three kinds of habits are utilized in the 
process of re-education. The needs are varied. 
The motor habits are those which we are con- 
cerned with largely in connection with the paral- 
yses. ‘The sensory habits are those with which 
we are concerned in the re-education of a tabetic. 
The delayed reaction habit comes to the fore as 
the important consideration in the re-education of 
the aphasic. In all of the neurological and 
psychiatric conditions with which we have to deal, 
we must produce or get formed habits of these 
three characters if the patients are to assume 
their positions in the social world. 
In different individuals habits are formed with 
different degrees of difficulty. With some persons 
the time for the formation of an habitual kind of 
reaction to certain stimuli may be very short. 
With other individuals it may be relatively long. 
Some are able to form habits of considerable com- 
plexity with apparent ease. Others are able to 
form simple habits readily but those which are 
complex are formed with difficulty or not at all. 
At the same time it is also known that the total 
number of habits which an individual may acquire, 
and the general statement may be made that the 
number and the kinds of habits which may be 
acquired, is dependent upon the individual. 
Although these statements apply to normal in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
dividuals, they are applicable equally and perhaps 
more forcibly to the abnormal who need re-educa- 
tion. In a few days the individual who is para- 
lyzed may learn to flex and extend certain muscles 
or groups or segments, but for many weeks he 
may not be able to learn to utilize the combina- 
tions of activity towards the production of a pur- 
poseful movement. In connection with the prac- 
tical application of procedures to bring about 
activities in abnormal individuals, it is helpful to 
keep in mind the facts regarding habit production 
in normal people. Much light is also thrown upon 
the process of learning in the abnormal if we take 
into account the facts regarding the formation of 
habits in animals. In animal psychology much at- 
tention has been directed to what has been called 
economy in learning. Some of the data obtained 
in the training of animals have almost direct bear- 
ing and application in our re-education procedure. 
Thus it has been found that the number and the 
frequency of the learning periods are important 
in the acquisition of a desired habit. When an 
animal is given one trial a day, it takes seventeen 
days, or in all seventeen trials, to learn to do the 
particular act thoroughly and almost ireflexly. 
Another animal in the same situation given three 
trials a day has been found capable of learning it 
in nine days, or a total of twenty-seven trials. A 
third animal given five trials a day has learned to 
carry out the needed actions in eight days or a 
total of forty trials. A fourth animal that had 
been given one trial every other day acquired the 
habit in sixteen trials or a total of thirty-one days, 
while the fifth animal given one trial with free in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  
   
                           
     
          
        
     
   
   THE FORMATION OF HABITS 53 
tervals of two days learned in thirteen trials or a 
total of thirty-seven days. These facts have a di- 
rect bearing upon the determination of the 
course of the procedure in the re-education of 
abnormal cases. The same general laws apply. 
There is economy in learning up to a certain point. 
If we desire to have the individual acquire a habit, 
which we have set as a task, rapidly and with the 
least expenditure of time on his part, short re- 
education sessions followed by long free intervals 
are most advantageous. If we desire that this 
habit shall be acquired in the least number of 
days, more than one trial a day should be given. 
Anomalous though it may seem, it is true that rest 
periods apparently facilitate learning. James’s 
well known dictum that we learn to swim in the 
winter and skate in the summer is borne out by 
all of the experimental results which have been 
obtained on the formation of habits. A certain 
amount of apparently resting time must be al- 
lowed the nervous system to become organized for 
the required adjustments. The complex nervous 
adjustments are made not only at the time a spe- 
cial exercise is taken, but also in the period of rest 
hich follows one exercise and which precedes the 
ext exercise. This has application to both nor- 
al people and to animals, and probably to a 
reater extent to those who need re-education. It 
s much better to give short periods of training 
ith relatively long rest periods rather than to 
eep a patient continuously at the re-education 
raining as is so frequently done. To have a 
atient under training at the beginning of a series 
or not more than ten minutes at one time, and to  
-P-A-G-E-62
    54 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
give him exercises twice daily with several hours’ 
interval between the two periods, results in more 
benefit than a single period of exercise twenty to 
thirty minutes long at one time. 
Over-enthusiasm is attempting to get a habit of 
a certain character formed may retard the re- 
covery. Having the number of trials per day very 
large may even be harmful to the patient in that 
fatigue may be produced beyond that which is 
advisable. Another fact which we have learned 
from work on animals and on normal subjects 
which can be directly applied in our dealings with 
the abnormal is that habits may be inhibited by a) 
number of mental and physical conditions. It has 
been my experience that in the patient needing re- 
education inhibitions are much more often 
produced. Great care to prevent untoward occur- 
rences must therefore be taken in carrying out th 
re-education procedure. The mental attitude o 
the patient is of primary importance. So far a 
the instructor is concerned it must be appreciate 
that the attitude of the patient is determine 
largely by the attitude of instructor. If the pa 
tient thinks that nothing further can be done fo 
him and by him two courses are open to the in 
structor. One thing is to do nothing further wit. 
the patient in an active manner, but to leave hi 
to himself. However, the instructor should le 
him see what has been done for other patients 
When this has been done it tends to put him in 
mental state to demand that something shall b 
done for him. The other thing to do is to sho 
the patient that something has been done for hi 
and by appeal to pride or self interest to get hi

to believe and to insist that much more can and

The fear of pain, and the embarrassment which 
may be felt when other persons than the instructor 
are around, frequently bring about a disturbance 
or an inhibition of an activity which may have a 
deleterious effect upon the patient. When he dis- 
covers that under certain circumstances he is un- 
able to carry out certain activities, he may develop 
the idea that under those circumstances the activ- 
ities cannot be produced. He may, therefore, have 
a habit of inhibition. To prevent undue limita- 
tions and, therefore, disturbances, it has been my 
custom to permit the presence of anyone who is 
interested in the subject in the room while re- 
education exercises are going on beyond those of 
an experimental character. This is done in order 
that the subject may not acquire a specific habit 
of reacting only to me as an essential part of the 
environment and not to others. 
Care in manipulation will prevent many inhibi- 
tions which are due to the fear of pain. Fre- 
quently a rearrangement in procedure will also 
bring about the same results. That these inhib- 
itions are normal phenomena and that the ex- 
periences are not isolated is illustrated in the atti- 
tude of one who is swimming but who has not be- 
come expert. If in swimming the arm strikes 
unexpectedly an object in the water, there is a 
tendency to lose a stroke or to make a complete 
readjustment of his body before proceeding. Or 
an extra wave which is unexpected and which 
flows over the head may result in a similar loss of 
adjustment. In the abnormal the disturbance of

  56 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
an extra stimulus which is unexpected will some- 
times bring about even a greater disturbance in 
activity than that which is found in the swimmer. 
It will frequently inhibit activity and carry it 
back to an earlier step of incompleteness.

CHAPTER V 
MOVEMENT. 
When we analyze any activity we find it to be 
complex. The movement is known to be composed 
of individual motor activities which can be looked 
at from at least three points of view. The activity 
can be dealt with in terms of contractions and 
relaxations of individual muscles or groups of 
muscles; or it may be analyzed into the elements 
of flexion, extension, and rotation; or we may 
deal with it in simpler terms of strength, and 
amount, and time, each of which is an element in 
accuracy. Since the combinations of muscles 
needed in special activities are detailed in many 
texts of anatomy, they will not be discussed here. 
We shall deal with movement from the standpoint 
which in clinical discussions is least frequently 
considered. 
The movement can be judged from the stand- 
point of its strength or force. We may measure 
the strength in an absolute way, that is the maxi- 
mum amount of strength which can be exerted, or 
we may measure the relative force, that is the 
maximum force of a muscle or muscle group in 
relation to other similar measurements of other 
groups or of single muscles. Secondly, we may 
consider the extent, or the length, or quantity, of 
57 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
    58 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
a movement, and this factor also may be dealt with 
in a corresponding fashion, total or relative. | 
Thirdly, we may deal with the time of movement, 
and when considering the time we may measure 
two time elements or characters, either (1) the 
greatest speed of a single movement or the rela- 
tive speed in relation to other movements; or 
(2) the rapidity with which an individual can 
execute successive movements, in other words, 
the speed with which one movement may follow 
another. 
When we carefully examine a special movement 
of a purposeful character, we find that these three 
elements of strength, extent, and time are inti- 
mately related. When we speak of an accurate 
movement, we mean only that that movement has 
had a sufficient amount of force, a speed which is 
suitable for the movement, and an extent which 
carries the body or one or more of its parts as 
far as is necessary so that activity as a whole is 
properly carried out. In considering the activity 
of an individual we must, therefore, bear in mind 
that inaccuracies may be the result of variations 
in any one or in all of these three characters. At 
the same time in our re-education procedure we 
must bear in mind that a movement may be ex- 
ecuted with sufficient force and sufficient strength, 
but so slowly as to make the activity as a whole 
futile or of no avail. Any one of the elements, 
or all of them, which is found to be deficient must 
be dealt with in re-education procedures and only 
by keeping them in mind can we attain those re- 
sults of accuracy which are the end to be desired.
-P-A-G-E-67
  MOVEMENT 59 
EXTENT OF MOVEMENT 
In the past relatively little attention has been 
paid to this aspect of movement. Clinical studies, 
especially those with poliomyelitis patients, have 
dealt largely with strength tests, and the obvious 
purpose in much of the work has been to deal with 
recovery as if it were mainly that concerned with 
sufficient force of the muscles. It should be ob- 
vious, however, that this is only one of the ele- 
ments. When we examine a part of the body in 
action we see that the extent of any movement can 
be looked at in terms of inches or feet or millime- 
ters through which the part moves. But a brief 
consideration of some of the attendant conditions 
will serve to show that such a measurement is not 
accurate for many of our purposes, because if we 
desire to make comparisons of individuals we find 
that the lengths of the bones and of the connecting 
muscles differ. These differences necessarily 
affect the extent of movement if it be measured at 
the extreme end of the part in question. At the 
same time we must realize that in a compound seg- 
ment, such as the arm or leg, the measurement of 
movement at one joint is bound to be affected by 
the mobility of all the sections. Some measures 
should therefore be taken that will be comparable 
for all cases and for the different parts of the 
same individual. The measure which appears to 
be the best for this purpose is the determination 
of the extent of movement in terms of rotation 
about the joints. All movements about joints are 
rotations, and it is this that should be taken for 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
comparison. This is not the place to enter into 
details regarding the anatomical characters of 
the joints, or the physiology of movements which 
may be produced at these points. It is sufficient 
to know that whether the point be of the ball-and- 
socket type or of the hinge type, whether it be of 
a small or large size, measurement which will be 
sufficiently accurate can be made by the use of 
apparatus which measures circular degrees. Ap- 
  
    
    
              
  Figure 1. A, B, and © are three simple protractors for general 
use. D and E show two other forms of protractors, useful for 
measurement respectively of foot rotation and wrist flexion and 
extension, 
paratus of this kind is readily devised in any 
laboratory or office. 
The type of apparatus which should be gener- 
ally used is a protractor. Because of differences 
in ease of application several are needed for the 
examination of the body. They may be made 
large or small, cardboard or wood or metal, simple 
or elaborate. Some are illustrated herewith. 
Those for measuring movements at the hip or at

MOVEMENT 61 
the shoulder must be larger, those which are used 
for the estimation of finger movements must be 
- small, and others for determining the amounts of 
movements at the ankle and the wrist must be 
medium in size. 
In making a protractor for movement measure- 
ment methods of use must be kept in mind. In 
one the center of the protractor may be placed in 
front of or behind the supposed center of the angle 
or at least near the point of rotation of the joint 
and the movement measured in terms of the cir- 
cular degrees through which the part is moved. 
In other cases there can be fitted to the part, the 
movement of which we desire to measure, a hinged 
piece of material so arranged that the arm or 
finger, for example, moves one of the parts, while 
the other remains stationary. This forces the 
hinged apparatus into an angle and the protractor 
reading can then be made from the position of its 
two parts. 
In the measurement of the extent of movements 
of different individuals, both normal and abnor- 
mal, I have found three defects in the use of the 
apparatus, all of which prevent absolutely correct 
measurements. One of these is that the supposed 
center of rotation at a joint may be determined 
only after many careful measurements and an 
inordinate waste of time, or it is guessed at with 
a large error. The second difficulty is that in all 
the joints which I have measured the center of 
rotation is not a fixed point, but in every case the 
axis of rotation shifts. The location of the center 
differs, therefore, according to the quantity or 
extent of movement executed up to a certain an-

gular measure. I have also found, thirdly, that 
careful estimations of consecutive movements of 
the fullest extent in the same individual will vary

difficulty, or inability, to determine the approxi-

actual difference in activity of the individual 
from time to time. In the measurements which I 
have recorded I have considered that an accuracy 
to five circular degrees is quite sufficient. If ina

pathological case we can not discover that a sup- 
posed abnormality has greater variation than five 
degrees from the normal, we need pay little atten- 
tion to it, and we may doubt that it is an abnor- 
mality. 
The protractor may also be used for measuring 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
the accuracy of the extent of movement for certain 
special activities. An individual may be able to 
make a movement of a certain character. Regard- 
less, however, of the fact that this movement may 
be less or greater than the normal, in some cases 
it is of considerable importance to determine the 
individual variations in this movement. Thus, it 
is useful to know whether or not a patient can re- 
peat a certain movement once or oftener, and if 
so with what degree of accuracy. This is fre- 
quently of more service than it is to determine 
whether or not an individual can make a move- 
ment of a maximum and normal extent. From 
numerous experiments on normal individuals it 
is known that the accuracy of successive move- 
ments should be not far from ninety-five per cent, 
which means that a second movement following 
the first should vary from the 
first by not more than five per 
cent in either direction, less or 
greater. 
STRENGTH OF MOVEMENT 
Various means have been 
devised for measuring the 
aan strength of movement. The

strength of flexors, of the fingers, and sometimes 
of the wrist or the forearm. Oval spring dyna- 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  MOVEMENT 65 
mometers have also been on the market for 
measuring the strength of groups of flexors, such 
as one gets in the grip, others 
for the strength of back move- 
ments or for the adduction 
muscles at the shoulder, ete. - 
These instruments measure, or 
are supposed to measure, the 
absolute force of the muscles 
used in the movement. 
All of them have a place 
in the measurement of the 
strength of movements of cer- 
tain patients or groups of pa- 
tients, but another method 
more recently introduced for 
the measurement of any indi- 
vidual muscle group is of 
greater value. This is the 
spring dynamometer testing 
method of Martin and Lovett, 
who appear to be the first to 
use the method in connection 
with the examination of cases 
of poliomyelitis. For testing 
the strength of all the usual 
groupings of muscles, from 
four to six dynamometers of 
different tensions are needed. 
These range from the small 
and relatively weak dynamo-

meter useful for determining the strength of indi- 
vidual fingers and toes to that for testing the large 
back muscles. 
  The former pulls only as high as
-P-A-G-E-74
66 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
5 kilograms while the latter must show readings 
as high as a hundred and fifty kilograms. 
The method of using these instruments is quite 
simple but at the same time it requires some tech- 
nical experience and skill. If it be desired to test 
the strength of the flexors of the forearm, a loose 
strap is placed about the wrist at a definite dis- 
tance from the bend of the elbow or from the 
olecranon, or level with the exterior processes of 
the ulna and the radius. One of the dynamom- 
eters is locked into the strap at the outside sur- 
face. The patient is then required to contract 
the flexor of the forearm as strongly as possible 
while the operator holds or exerts traction upon 
the dynamometer. At the point where the dyna- 
mometer just compensates or corresponds with 
the strength of the muscle, a reading is made. 
This point is to be more justly determined by 
placing one hand on the contracting muscle or 
muscles and noting the point at which the mus- 
cles just begin to give against the force exerted 
by the operator through the dynamometer. It 
will be appreciated that when the more accurate 
measurements are to be made they can best be 
carried out with the aid of a skilled assistant. 
Any group of muscles may be investigated in 
this manner but care must be taken in carrying 
out the procedure that the tests are made in such 
a fashion that the strength of certain muscle 
groups are determined. If the examiner is care- 
ful in palpating the contracting muscles he will 
often find that unusual combinations, or groups 
in which accessory muscles are brought into play, 
are not infrequently acting together to compensate

for a recognized defect. What may take place at 
times in a movement is well brought out in the 
study of muscle combinations by Beevor. Beevor 
has shown conclusively that different combina- 
tions of muscles may be used for the performance 
of apparently the same act. This has been con- 
firmed by all others who have carefully examined 
muscle groups in action. It has been found, for 
example, that a certain movement is usually pro- 
duced by the activities of two or more muscles 
working together. When resistance to the move- 
ment is interposed additional muscles come into 
play, and when the desired movement as a move- 
ment cannot be made (as for example, when the 
work to be performed is too great for the muscle 
group) there are sometimes brought into play, 
and most actively, other accessory muscles. This 
is also known to be the case in the production of 
extensive movements. A casual examination of 
an individual in the execution of a movement 
which is at the limit of his capability will serve to 
demonstrate this difference. If, for example, a 
patient or a normal individual be requested to ad- 
duct the arm as far as possible, the arm is raised 
from its normal position at the side of the body as 
far as may be by the shoulder girdle muscles, but 
to raise the hand and the arm to an even greater 
degree there come into play many of the trunk 
muscles and sometimes the muscles of the leg. 
There is given herewith a table showing the 
comparative strengths of various muscle groups 
which have been determined by Martin and others 
in their study of this subject. This table will be 
found to be useful in estimating the degree of in-

volvement and the extent of recovery in cases of 
poliomyelitis as well as in other forms of paral- 
ysis.

TIME OF MOVEMENT 
The accurate measurement of the time of an 
individual movement (that is the time elapsing 
between the signal for the beginning of a move- 
ment until it is fulfilled or until the part returns 
to its normal position or comes to rest) is tedious 
and requires a large amount of special apparatus 
which is not always available, and which can be 
used only after considerable practice. Hach of the 
time elements in a single movement may be
-P-A-G-E-77
  
MOVEMENT 69 
measured separately without much difficulty, al- 
though for most clinical purposes any value in 
these measures is not at present known. The 
measurement of an activity in this way is, we 
know, not very important in re-education. It is 
of some interest and also doubtless of importance 
that the latent period of a movement be not too 
greatly prolonged, and that the period of muscle 
shortening be reasonably quick, but these are ele- 
ments in a total activity which can be dealt with 
for our purpose as a whole. In abnormal individ- 
uals we are concerned more with the execution 
of a movement rapidly which is followed by an- 
other movement, and then by a third and fourth, 
ete. In other words, we are more concerned with 
the speed of repeated movements or with the 
change in direction of a movement, than with the 
absolute speed of the individual movement. A 
modification of this statement may be made to the 
extent that the latent period of a movement, that 
period which exists between the time of the stimu- 
lus and the beginning of the movement, is of 
considerable importance to us because if the be- 
ginning of a movement be too greatly delayed the 
movement is ineffective. Since, however, we are 
chiefly concerned with the ability to carry out a 
movement as a whole, the reaction time, or latent 
period, can be estimated along with the other 
parts of the movement. 
Two or three simple experiments are useful in 
determining the speed of movements.1 If the 
2These have already been described in my Handbook of Mental 
‘caminations Methods (2nd edit., The Macmillan Co., 1919) to 
hich reference should be made, but for convenience will be 
riefly repeated here. 
     
                                    
   
             
     
    
-P-A-G-E-78
  70 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
patient is able to carry out a fairly complex move- 
ment such as the circular movement of the hand, 
the determination of speed may be made by using 
a simple apparatus consisting of a piece of wood 
in which a circular track or groove has been cut. 
The patient is directed to place the point of a 
pencil or stylus in the groove and beginning at 
a given signal to run the pencil continually around 
the track until he is ordered to stop. The two 
directions of movement, clockwise and counter- 
clockwise, may be tested. Knowing the length 
of the track and the number of revolutions one 
can then estimate the speed from the total extent. 
For many parts of the body such a test is not ap- 
plicable, but another measure of the speed of 
movement may be obtained by determining the 
rapidity with which one movement follows an- 
other as in the process of tapping. In this test 
all that is needed is a pencil or a stylus which the 
patient uses upon a surface that resounds. For 
most patients needing re-education the number of 
‘taps’? can be counted, and by the simultaneous 
use of a stop watch the speed can be calculated. 
With intelligent individuals who are ambitious 
and able to codperate, one can get a limitation of 
the muscular activity to a certain joint, and if 
the number of taps is counted for a period of five 
seconds there is sufficient determination of the 
speed. Comparison may be then made between 
activities at different joints. 
When it is possible to use a pencil and paper, 
the taps may be made permanent records, and a’ 
a subsequent time they can be counted and com 
pared with later performances. The speed o

         MOVEMENT 7     
tapping movements is so great for some seg- 
ments in normal individuals that it is not pos- 
sible to count them as they are being made, and 
it is necessary to have a permanent record which 
can subsequently be counted. Since we may 
have to compare normal with abnormal people, 
a normal part with an abnormal part, it is ad- 
vantageous so far as possible to utilize the pencil 
method especially if the speed of the repeated 
movements exceeds four taps per second. These 
tests can also be carried out with a metal stylus, 
2 metal plate, an electrical counter, and neces- 
sary batteries, but these are unnecessary labor- 
itory refinements. 
ACCURACY OF MOVEMENT 
Although a movement is made accurate en- 
irely by the combination of appropriate strength, 
xtent, and time, accuracy is our primary goal in 
e-education, as well as in all education. If the 
dividual has sufficient strength, and if he has 
Ihe capability of making a movement to the 
reatest extent or to the slightest degree, as may 
e demanded, and if he is quick or slow enough in 
xecuting a movement at command, the three ele- 
ents are normally carried out simultaneously in 
ch a manner that the movement is called accur- 
te. When the attention of the subject is entirely 
irected to one of the elements, as for example 
e extent of the movement, the movement in 
at particular may be normal, but if the other 
ements are examined we not infrequently find 
at they suffer at the expense of the one to which    
   
   
  
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
attention is directed. This means that the move 
ment is not accurate. Its accuracy is lessene¢ 
because of the failure to attend to the goal of th 
movement so that all of the elements are com 
bined into one whole. 
In many re-education cases it is essential tha 
special exercises be directed towards increase 0 
strength, or towards increasing the speed or th 
extent, of certain movements. In most cases 
and in cases such as locomotor ataxia this i 
sometimes exclusively the case, the re-educatio1 
procedure should be directed primarily and a 
times entirely towards producing the movemen 
as a whole, ie., an accurate movement. More 
over we know that in certain cases (for example 
those with disease of the cerebellum) the indi 
vidual elements in the movements may be per: 
fectly normal but they may not be suitably com: 
bined. This produces an inaccuracy which i 
must be our effort to replace by an accurate ac: 
tivity. 
The control of movement is generally believe 
to be brought about by the use of certain senso 
elements. Afferent impulses of the nature o 
sensations are initiated whenever a movement i 
begun. These arise through end organs in th 
skin, in the muscles and tendons, and perhaps i 
the bones. When a movement takes place the en 
organs are stimulated so that impulses are sen 
towards the central nervous system. In som] 
manner these afferent impulses exert a contr 
upon the outgoing or the motor impulses so th 
the movement is graduated, or its parts are time| 
and harmonized. The neurological mechanis:
-P-A-G-E-81
  MOVEMENT 73 
whereby this control is accomplished is not un- 
derstood, although there are many explanations 
that have been advanced to account for it. We 
know that in locomotor ataxia, in which the sense 
of position is very defective or is lost, the move- 
ments are inaccurately carried out, although the 
individual components of the movements may be 
normal—in strength, extent, and time. The loss 
or defect in the normal afferent apparatus is of 
the greatest importance in cases of this kind. It 
can be compensated for by other sensory ele- 
ents and the direction of re-education must 
mecessarily be towards the production of the 
ormal combinations of speed, extent and force. 
he consideration of ‘‘combined’”’ activity also 
olds in numerous other conditions with which 
we may have to deal. This is true, for example, 
n cases of paralysis agitans and of multiple 
clerosis. In the paralyses due to spinal or cere- 
ral injuries also, after a certain capability is 
ttained, it is frequently more valuable to exer- 
ise the individual in the production of the move- 
ents in an accurate manner, and not to stress 
he components. This in a different field is also 
ound to be the case in patients with so-called 
‘motor’’ aphasia.

for each patient is a separate problem which 
must be solved in accordance with his mental 
and physical condition. 
In planning exercises for the leg, it is very de- 
sirable that attention be directed to getting the pa- 
tient to control the distance and dire tion in which 
the foot is placed. The accompanying diagrams 
(Fig. 6 A, B, C, D,) show some of the means which 
lhave been used in exercising the right leg be- 
cause of a partial paralysis. In these diagrams, 
which are drawn on heavy card-board for the pa- 
tient, the positions of both feet are indicated, the 
eft foot being shown with the crossed lines, and 
he successive position of the right foot by the 
nshaded diagrams. At the beginning of each 
xercise, the position of the right foot is shown 
t 1 and succeeding positions of the foot are in- 
icated by subsequent numerals. In making these 
esigns the distances from 1 to 2, or 3, or 4, or 
, must be adapted to the individual patient. 
ere it may be mentioned again that the demand 
nm the patient for the accomplishment of some- 
hing just beyond his capability, as determined 
y an examination, will usually bring forth a 
reater effort and will very frequently show that 
e is able to extend himself beyond the point that 
n examination indicated to be his limit. 
Figure 6 A shows the simplest of these exer- 
ises. In this exercise the patient stands erect 
pon the spaces indicated, with the feet slightly 
part but pointing directly ahead. From posi- 
ion 1 of the right foot, that foot without drag- 
ing the toe is moved to position 2, firmly planted 
here and the position held for a few seconds.
-P-A-G-E-84
  76 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
Then in a similar way the foot is raised from the 
floor and carried to position 3, then to 4, next to 
5, and it is then returned to its original position 
at 1. In Figure 6 B the diagram shows an exer- 
cise for the rotation of the leg. The foot is first 
carried from position 1 to position 2 immediately 
in front of the left foot. Using the right heel as 
the rotation point, the foot is carried slowly 
around to 3, then to 4, and after returning to 2 
it is lifted back to its original position at 1. A

movements. The eross bars are adjustable in height, and th 
distances between any two hurdles may be changed. 
somewhat similar exercise is shown in figure 6 C 
in which, however, the paralyzed foot is placed 
behind the non-paralyzed, and in which the rota- 
tion takes place with the toe as a rotation point, 
In Figure 6D an exercise similar to that sho 
in Figure 6 A is indicated. In this exercise th 
smaller circles indicate respectively the posi 
tions of the toe of the foot which is paralyzed, o 
of the heel. This exercise should be arranged t 
suit the individual patient both with respect t 
the location and the order of the position o 
points 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
Two special exercises for the control of th 
leg in improving the important movements i
-P-A-G-E-85
  MOVEMENT 77 
stepping, are carried out with other special ap- 
paratus in addition to those in Figure 6. One of 
these exercises is performed with a series of so- 
called hurdles which are pictured in Figure 7. 
These hurdles are constructed individually and 
in such a fashion that the heights of the hurdle 
bars may be changed as 
occasion demands. The 
uprights should not be 
over 24 inches in height, 
and the distance between 
them need not be greater 
than 36 inches. Three or 
four of the hurdles are 
placed at different dis- 
tances from one another 
and with the cross bars at 
different heights. An ir- 
regular arrangement is by 
advised so that the patient Figure 8. High stepping 
must in each case adapt apparatus, for exercising i : subject in flexion and exten- 
himself to a new condi- sion at hip. On the uprights, 
tion, both in length of A and B, there are hooks 
step and in height to which [owerg ef the twine bar. the paralyzed leg must be 
lifted. Figure 8 shows a similar hurdle con- 
structed somewhat differently and for a slightly 
different purpose. This hurdle is a ‘‘high’’ hurdle 
with the uprights 42 inches high. The cross bar is 
la piece of twine which can be attached by a loop 
o one of the hooks on the upright A., and car- 
ied over to a corresponding hook on the side of 
he upright B. This twine is held taut by the 
eight C. The height of the twine can be ar-

ranged for the individual patient. The space be- 
tween the uprights, A and B, should be so long 
that an awkwardness in moving the leg does not 
cause the patient to hit either of the uprights. 
I have used a space of about five feet between 
uprights. The hooks on A and B are placed at 
intervals of one inch. Performance on this ap- 
paratus can be used to show an improvement 
in the capability of the individual in that the 
“bar’? of twine can be raised to determine 
the maximum height to which the leg can be 
lifted. For this purpose it is advisable to make 
at least three measurements and to average 
them. 
In addition to the exercises which have been 
described with the use of specially constructed 
apparatus it is advantageous to utilize the nor- 
mal activities of play as far as possible. This is 
especially true when two or more patients can 
be exercised simultaneously. Under these con- 
ditions resort is made to the competitive instinct 
. which will help to stimulate the individuals in 
the direction of a maximum accomplishment. 
Thus I have been successful in getting groups of 
patients to run races. In exercising a group of 
two or more in this way, I have tested with a 
stop watch the apparent maximum performance 
of each patient, i.e., his speed to run a distance 
of about twenty to thirty yards. In order to} 
bring into play the factor of competition, I have 
taken the records of individual accomplishmen’ 
of two or more patients and handicapped th 
faster in accordance with the records which hav 
been made. When the group race is run it ha       
     
                                
-P-A-G-E-87
     MOVEMENT 79 
usually been found that the time is shorter than 
that in the individual trials. It has been inter- 
esting to note that the handicaps can be so ar- 
ranged that the contestants cross the finish line 
with very little distance between them. The ex- 
ercise can also be used for individual competition 
by having the patient ‘‘run against’’ his own 
record. Improvement can, of course, be plotted 
by using the daily records or weekly averages. 
In a similar fashion one can have competition 
between two or more individuals, or between an 
individual and his previous record, in the distance 
that a football can be kicked over a smooth sur- 
face such as alawn. In carrying out this exercise, 
the round ‘‘association’’ football is better than 
the oval ball. For some patients, especially those 
who show foot drop, it may be necessary to 
“‘tee’’ the ball so that the toes can be placed un- 
der the ball. 
Activities of the hand and arm are so varied 
that many more exercises can be devised for the 
practise of this segment than for the leg. In 
devising individual tests or exercises changes 
must be frequently made, adapting the exercises 
to individual patients who have peculiarities of 
defect. Besides the utilization of dynamometers 
which can be used as exercising instruments as 
well as for measuring purposes, almost any activ- 
ity is worth attempting. When conditions have 
warranted I have not hesitated to ask a patient 
to play basebail, golf, volley ball, or any of the 
games which his physical conditions seemed to 
indicate that he was capable of accomplishing, 
at least in part. Most of the games can also be

used as a measuring rod for determining indi- 
vidual improvement, by applying certain rules 
to the exercise. As an example of this we may 
cite the apparently complex process of hammer- 
ing ten nails into a piece of soft wood. This may 
be measured in the following manner. The ‘‘ex- 
ercise’’ wood must be prepared 
e 200 by having ten nail holes 
é started. This is done by driv- 
: ing ten nails through a piece

Sie, the wood that is used for the 
@ 120 test, and using this as a tem- 
@ /00 plet ten ‘%-inch holes are 
started. The patient places a 
nail in one of the shallow holes 
and using the hammer with the 
affected hand attempts to drive

rounding the place where the nail is placed. The 
procedure of making the nail holes is adopted 
so that it is easy for the patient to set them 
serially in the holes, and so that they are retained Fioor Liney

without holding. The danger of having the pa- 
tient’s fingers mashed with the hammer is thus 
obviated. 
Simpler tests and exercises, not however simple 
in the sense of accomplishment but in the sense 
of being directed to certain activities which can 
be carried out by the patients, are numerous. For 
the exercise of the shoulder segment I have 
placed upon a wall a number of diamonds or

circles or squares as shown in figure 9. They be- 
gan at one meter from the floor and they were 
20 em. apart. The patient was directed to reach 
as high as he possibly could on this scale. The 
results of these exercises can be readily tabulated 
also. Of a similar character, but for movements 
of a different type, I have used a series of squares 
one inch to the side arranged in a line as shown 
in figure 10. The patient sitting at a table is 
directed to point his finger at the first square and 
with successive backward and forward move- 
ments to point to each of the succeeding squares 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
in the series of ten. After this has been accom- 
plished, he is then to return to square 1 and to 
do the series over again and again, and to con- 
tinue until the signal to stop has been given. A 
definite time, 15 to 30 seconds, is taken for this 
exercise and the total number of squares to which 
the patient has pointed dur- 
ing that time is recorded. 
A somewhat similar, al- 
though more complicated, ex- 
ercise involving the use of all 
of the muscles of the arm 
segments, can be used when 
the patient is able to hold a 
pencil. When I have found 
Ficurr 11. Appa- this to be the case, I have 
ratus for training in started him tracing with the accuracy of hand and . : 
arm movements. The aid of a card-board die as 
dark inner square is cut shown in figure 11, from out and the subject is 5 o 2 
instructed to trace this Which the central square has 
square on a paper be- een cut. The die is placed neath. : 
upon a piece of paper and 
held firmly by thumb tacks. The pencil is placed 
by the patient in one corner and carried around 
successively on the four sides. In the first 
re-education trials it will be found that the di- 
rection of the pencil is not well regulated. 
There are many unnecessary lines within the 
square and others which project outside upon the 
die, as well as short discontinuous lines indicating 
an irregularity in the movement. As the patient 
improves these evidences of irregular movement 
decrease in number and in extent. Although no 
absolute numerical value can be given to the ac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
MOVEMENT 83 
complishment, as is the case in many other tests, 
a certain estimation can be made if a series of 
values is adopted and the comparison made from 
day to day, or from week to week. I have cred- 
ited the individual with scores from one to five 
according to the obvious accuracy of his results. 
For a week I have calculated the average and 
have compared it with prior performances to de- 
termine whether or not, and how much, improve- 
ment has taken place. Another exercise of the 
same general character can be made by provid- 
ing a rule with two marks indicating the begin- 
ning and the end of 
desired to have the 
patient draw. The Figure 12. Apparatus for training

upon which the lines are to be drawn it is a rela- 
tively simple matter to determine the accuracy or 
inaccuracy of beginning and ending at the points 
desired. These records may also be evaluated in 
the same manner as the tracing of the square. 
In addition to these exercises in which mechan- 
ical aids are given to the patient, free-hand move- 
ments may be demanded. For examples: making 
straight lines, circles, squares, or other figures, 
and an extension of this in the making of letters 
of the alphabet or in letter writing. Others will 
suggest themselves as a patient’s condition im- 
proves. 
   
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
In many cases of paralysis, especially in those 
of a cerebral type, the movements of extension 
return much later than those of flexion and many 
special exercises must be used in order to bring 
out those capabilities or to exercise the patient 
in these operations. 
A simple method which can be used is to pro- 
vide for the patient a long rule or a long sheet 
of paper on which 
there are vertical 
lines at certain dis- 
tances from each 
other, inches or centi- 
meters, and which are 
numbered. The pa- 
tient is instructed: 
(a) to place his 
thumb (we will take 
the right hand for 
example) at the ex- 
treme left of the 
ruled portion of the 
paper and to stretch as far as possible the fore- 
finger from the thumb, (b) holding the forefinger 
in that position to stretch again with the medius 
finger, (c) holding the position with the middle 
finger to stretch with the ring finger and (d) hold- 
ing that finger to stretch with the little finger. 
The total distance of the stretch from the thumb 
to the little finger is then recorded. 
Another exercise for extension movements is 
provided by taking strips of wood about % inch 
thick and arranging them like a stairway as 
shown in Figure 13. Placing the thumb upon the Ficure 13. Finger stepping ap- 
paratus.
-P-A-G-E-93
  MOVEMENT 85 
lowest step, the forefinger is lifted to the second 
step, the medius finger to the third step, and-so- 
forth. This stairway may be constructed with 
a different height of step from that suggested, 
and at times it will be found advantageous to 
have at least three stairways, with steps 14, %, 
and 2 inches in height. 
An appliance to be used in a different type of 
exercise is illustrated in figure 14. This is essen- 
tially a milled nut (A) and a fine machine screw

(B), so arranged as to permit easy counting or 
calculation of the revolution of the nut. The 
screw is put through a hole in a board (D), and 
close to the milled nut a projecting pointer (C) 
is arranged so that the rotations and partial ro- 
tations may be counted. The patient is in- 
structed to take hold of the milled nut with the 
finger and thumb and to turn it, in accordance 
with directions, in a clockwise or counter-clock- 
wise direction. The nut should first be set, it 
is almost needless to say, with its zero point indi- 
cated at (C). The patient is then requested to
-P-A-G-E-94
86 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
make ten successive turns with the fingers, be- 
ginning a later turn at the point at which the 
former one left off. After the series has been 
completed a reading is made and from this there 
ean be calculated the average extent of his turn. 
Already mention has been made of the fact 
that a tapping test can be used for determining 
the speed of repeated movements (p. 70). This 
test may also be used to exercise the patient, and 
for this purpose it is advantageous to select a 
definite time for the performance, say 10, 20, 
or 30 seconds, and to have the taps recorded on 
paper and subsequently counted. With a patient 
who can give intelligent codperation one can ex- 
ercise him for movements at the wrist, and at the 
shoulder, or for combined movements. 
When the patient becomes able to make op- 
posing adjustments with his finger and thumb, 
I have used many tests so that his movements are 
improved. One of these is to provide him with 
weights which are to be. lifted. These weights 
can best be constructed by using a bottle into 
which shot are placed for added weight. He is 
instructed to lift the bottle to a height of about 
six inches and replace it upon the table. This 
exercise is carried out with the thumb and each 
of the fingers in succession. To make the test 
more difficult after it has been found to be easy 
for him, I have oiled the bottle or covered it with 
soapsuds in order that he may be compelled to 
grip it more firmly and to take special care in 
the performance of the exercise. 
Another test and exercise which can be given 
is with shot or steel balls of different diameters,
-P-A-G-E-95
  MOVEMENT 87 
or with large and small marbles. I have used 
steel balls 14 inch and 1 inch, and shot about %e 
inch in diameter. Ten of one kind are placed on 
the table in front of the patient, with not less 
than two inches separating the individual balls. 
The patient is instructed that at a given signal 
he is to pick up the balls, one at a time, and to 
deposit them in a box which may be placed either 
to the right or to the left. The time for the per- 
formance of this is recorded. After a few days 
or weeks it may be found that all the expected 
improvement in the picking up of the larger balls 
has taken place, and from that time the exercises 
should be given with the smaller balls or with the 
shot. 
Mention might also be made of many other 
exercises which have the character of normal 
sport. Only two will be briefly described here, 
but the number that can be used will depend upon 
the instructor and his pupil. 
One test of this kind is to place a waste paper 
basket in the corner of the room, and near the pa- 
tient to provide another basket containing ten- 
nis balls. Standing at a distance of about three 
yards he throws the balls into the basket if he 
ean. His score is the number of successful trials 
which he makes. A refinement in calculation can 
be made if one desires to do so by giving a small 
credit for those attempts in which the basket has 
been hit, but in which the ball has not gone into 
it, and greater credit for fully successful at- 
tempts. 
A second exercise of the same general nature 
which, however, is much better as far as deter-
-P-A-G-E-96
  88 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
mining improvement, or when the improvement 
has reached a certain point, is that in which the 
_ basket is replaced by a target as shown in Figure 
15. The inner circle of the target is made with a 
radius of four inches, the middle circle with an 
eight-inch radius, and the outer circle with a 
twelve-inch radius, all being placed on a sheet of 
card board which is thirty-two inches square. The 
score value for 
each part of the 
target is inversely 
proportional to the 
approximate area 
covered by the 
part. The patient 
attempts to hit the 
inner circle which 
has the value of 
ten. The score for 
ten trials is taken. 
The target may be

the wall or it can be placed upon the floor. In order 
to avoid mistakes in the determining of the points 
at which a ball has struck, I have used the device 
of having the balls lightly covered with taleum 
powder or with powdered chalk so that when a 
ball strikes any part of the target it leaves its 
mark. In this way a score may be calculated| 
after the completion of the ten throws, or at the| 
later convenience of the instructor. The mark

  CHAPTER VI 
GENERAL RE-EDUCATION METHODS. 
Every means that can be used to bring about 
a rehabilitation of the individual can be called 
re-education. Many of the methods are not dis- 
tinetly re-educational, but are applicable to many 
classes who need physical restoration. It should, 
however, be understood that re-education is not 
to be looked at from a narrow point of view, and 
that psychological procedures and chemicals may 
find their places in the eventual recovery of the 
patients. The immediately applicable methods 
are those that are usually grouped under the 
names electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, and physio- 
therapy. For full accounts of the values, appli- 
cations and limitations of the numerous forms of 
electrotherapy and hydrotherapy the reader is | 
referred to the numerous books dealing with those 
subjects. Here only the briefest mention can be 
made of them." 
Electricity is now used in different forms. 
Magnetism appears to have no value. The value 
of the galvanic battery in the stimulation of 
muscles and nerves is probably very slight. It 
has value in the diagnosis or determination of de- 
generation in the peripheral neuro-muscular ap-

paratus. The faradic, or induced current is of 
importance for the stimulation of muscles and 
nerves, as well as for diagnosis. The rapidly re- 
peated induced current stimulates the striated 
skeletal muscles, and throws them into contrac- 
tion during the time of its application, and in 
this respect differs from the galvanic current 
which brings about contractions only at make and 
at break. Currents of high frequency, having 
large force or voltage, but low intensity or am- 
perage, produce little visible change in the motor 
activities, but they may have value by reason of 
certain general physiological effects. A current 
of this kind produces heat by reason of the re- 
sistance of the tissues through which it passes, 
and it increase the blood supply. It may, there- 
fore, be a valuable adjunct or a preliminary to 
the passive and active exercises which are carried 
out. Static electricity has also more general ef- 
fects, although the single spark may be helpful in 
individual relief for spasm. 
Radiant light and heat act in a general way 
and have their main values in their soothing ef- 
fects as well as by the production of hyperemia, 
which may be local or general. In the form of 
stupes and hot packs heat is allied to hydro- 
therapy. 
Under the heading hydrotherapy there are 
grouped all procedures in which water is applied 
to the body, except internally. There are many 
kinds of baths:—hot; cold; alternating; medi- 
cated; immersion, local and general; and douche. 
The main value of each kind lies in the general 
change which takes place in the part to which it
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
is’ applied, especially because of the changes in 
the blood supply. 
All of the general methods enumerated above 
are in reality parts of physiotherapy, but the lat- 
ter term is most frequently applied to those kinds 
of treatments which are sometimes called me- 
chanotherapy or, more properly, kinesotherapy. 
The different forms of kinesotherapy are the most

important of the physiotherapeutic measures, but 
they are not widely understood. They have lately 
been used by many who have thought them too 
simple to study. They are not spectacular, be- 
cause they are carried out without the use of 
brass knobs and handles and immaculately white 
porcelain or black paint. There are two main 
forms of kinesotherapy—active movement and 
passive movement. Active movements may be 
(a) free or (b) resisted. Passive exercise is of 
two kinds. One is the change in the spatial re-

lations of parts of the body brought about by 
the operator. Functional elements are manipu- 
lated in a manner to resemble active movements. 
Thus, the forearm may be moved in any or all 
of its possible directions. This is usually called 
passive exercise. The second kind is commonly

known as massage, which is another kind of 
manipulation of parts of the body. This is 
mainly a method of dealing with individual 
muscles or parts of muscles, less frequently of 
muscle groups which are associated with normal 
bodily activities. 
Passive exercise in the restricted sense need 
not detain us. It is important, however, to recog- 
nize that different effects are produced by the

slow and the quick movements, and that this 
method of exercise may be advantageously com- 
bined with free exercises. The method is of 
greatest use in those instances in which there are 
limitations of movement, as in stiff joints and in 
partial paralyses. 
Massage, which is the other form of passive

exercise, is carried out in three different ways, 
each of which has its own special value. For the 
purpose of soothing the patient as well as re- 
ducing voluntary effort and involuntary contrac- 
tions, the part is gently stroked from the more 
peripheral part towards the heart. This is tech- 
nically known as effleurage. It is efficacious in 
reducing spasm-like conditions, and it also re- 
duces tremor. Gentle application for a few min- 
utes will help to reduce a tightly contracted

muscle. When stronger pressure is exerted it in- 
creases the circulation and when given strongly 
over the abdomen it may increase the activity of 
the smooth muscles of the intestines. Hffleurage, 
especially when the stronger pressures are used, 
develops into a kneading like process, but when 
this point is reached it is called petrissage. Pet-

rissage is a kneading of the tissue beneath the skin, 
the skin itself moving with the operator’s fingers 
and thumb as the underlying tissues are grasped 
and rubbed. This process squeezes from the tis- 
sues the venous blood and the lymph, and permits 
the freer entrance of the arterial blood. It helps 
to break up adhesions. When performed properly 
it is generally soothing to the subject. The third 
process is the rapid mechanical stimulation of 
tissues by blows. This is called tapotement. It

may be weak or strong, and may best be carried 
out by striking with the ulnar borders of the 
hands alternately, while the operator’s wrists 
and fingers are relaxed and act like flails. De- 
pending upon the strength of the stimulation, it 
may act principally upon the skin or upon the 
tissues beneath. It is most valuable as a stimu- 
lant to muscles, the irritability of which is greatly 
increased after several applications. A more 
rapid and slighter blow may be given to tissues by 
the use of the medius finger which is rapidly 
moved to and fro in a rhythm like a tremor. This 
resembles the vibrations which are given by many 
mechanical appliances. When applied over the 
point of entrance of the nerve to a muscle it is 
very stimulating, and it may result in a clonic 
activity. 
In the application of massage the general rule 
regarding all exercise should be followed. The 
first period should not be longer than a minute 
or two on any one part. If the number of parts 
to be dealt with is great, the whole time of treat- 
ment may be as long as a half hour, but it is sel- 
dom necessary to continue beyond that point. 
Masseurs who give all patients a treatment for 
an hour do not treat the patient, but rather ‘‘put 
in time.’’? In many cases the total time for treat- 
ment should not exceed fifteen minutes, but the 
time should be regulated in accordance with the 
physiological state of the tissues, and it bears a 
relation to the number of parts that require treat- 
ment. Too much massage like any other exercise 
has a tendency to produce muscle fatigue. 
Fatigue diminishes the tonicity of the muscles 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  GENERAL RE-EDUCATION METHODS 97 
and, when long continued in a muscle which is al- 
ready weakened, it may produce a functional loss 
which corresponds with a 
complete paralysis. Pas- 
sive exercise of the nature 
of massage is in all respects 
much better than mechan- 
ical means of exercise, such 
as that produced by an elec- 
trically driven vibrator, un- 
less in the use of the me- 
chanical appliances the 
treatment is interrupted or 
is accompanied by careful 
manipulation or palpation 
of the muscles to determine 
the effect. 
Although the passive ex- 
ercises (by massage, accom- 
panying electrical stimula- 
tion, or with mechanical ap- 
pliances) have their value, 
they are preparatory to, 
but cannot assume the place 
of, exercises that are ac- 
tive on the patient’s part. 
The active exercises are 
usually classed into those 
that are free and those that 
are made against resist- 
ance. However, all active

the part is carefully counterbalanced. The quan-

other, usually mechanical, means. Here also the 
same warning may be given that the utilization of 
mechanical contrivances which resist the activities 
of the patient are much less effective in bringing 
about the desired results than the hand manipula-

and other motor defects it is usually more impor- 
tant to get the individual to recognize his ability,

tal. The patient

carried out by 
Beevor, Du- 
chenne and oth- 
ers. They have 
demonstrated 
clearly that 
when the activ- 
ity of a group of 
muscles is not 
sufficient to over- 
come an outside 
resistance, there 
will be brought 
into play many 
other accessory 
muscles, beyond

or to improve his ability to carry out movements 
of a normal character in which certain combina- 
tions of muscles are normally used. It is, there- 
fore, important that the individual should not be 
encouraged to bring into play those accessory 
muscles which can be used by the patient, but 
which the re-educator does not wish the patient 
to depend upon. If the resistance is too great

medicine ball. From McKenzie. 
the tendency is to make use of the more usable 
muscles, to the exclusion of those muscles which 
should be normally used. 
At the beginning of re-education, variability in 
activity is the rule and not the exception. In the 
re-education of a paralytic, which we may take 
as an example, it is most frequent to find the sub- 
ject is capable at one time of executing a move- 
ment of a certain kind, to a certain degree, with 
a certain strength, with a certain speed. The next 
time the subject attempts to make the movement 
there may be a very considerable exaggeration in 
one or in all of these characteristics or there may 
be a considerable diminution. This variability, 
however, is one which diminishes as re-education 
progresses. It may not be found after the first 
few weeks of training, unless embarrassment or 
emotional upsets intervene. At any time the pa-
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
tient may again show great variations in capa- 
bility but these are most frequently due to his 
mental state. 
The quantity of exercise which a patient may 
take is to be measured essentially by the effect 
that the exercise has. A certain amount of fa- 
tigue in these abnormai individuals is no worse 
than it is for normal people, but it should be kept 
in mind that in general fatigue ensues much more 
suddenly in abnormal conditions than in the nor- 
mal. Between individual movements a_ rest 
should always be taken, even though this rest may 
only be in terms of quarter seconds. If, however, 
in the execution of a second movement it is found 
that this movement is markedly decreased in ex- 
tent, or force, or time, as compared with the same 
movement which has just been executed, it may 
be taken as an indication that the neuro-muscular 
apparatus, or the subject as a whole, is fatigued. 
It may be that the period of rest between the two 
movements has not been sufficient to permit the 
normal amount of recovery. In general the dic- 
tum may be laid down that the patient’s second 
movement should be the equivalent of the first 
and that in a series the later movements should 
not at any time differ from the first by more than 
ten per cent. This, it must be understood, ap- 
plies primarily to those cases in which the re- 
education exercises have been in progress for 
some time, when the patient has shown his capa- 
bility to carry out his exercises in a regular, rou- 
tine manner. 
The accessory apparatus useful in re-education 
are of two kinds, those which are useful in over- 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
GENERAL RE-EDUCATION METHODS 103 
coming defects and those which are useful as 
compensations for defects. The first may be il- 
lustrated by those forms of braces and casts which 
are used for overcoming conditions of deformity, 
ankylosis, and the like. The second class includes 
those kinds of appliances which help weak parts 
to work against stronger parts. The application 
of the first class of apparatus should be left en- 
tirely to the orthopedic surgeon and should be 
changed only in accordance with his direction. 
The usefulness of the second type of apparatus 
is that it may be experimentally shortened by the 
instructor from time to time in order to de- 
termine to what extent the subject has attained 
the capability of carrying on his activities without 
it, or without so much of it. 
In much re-education work the use of rigid 
splints is to be deprecated. Except those which 
are needed for the support of parts in order to 
rest them, as in the case of shoulder muscles, or 
to support the body, as in the case of corsets 
which will enable the individual to stand, they 
should not be used. Whenever possible flexible 
splints should be used and these may be corset 
teels, spiral springs, or even rubber bands. In 
he foot-drop in cerebral paralysis or poliomyelitis 
t is frequent to find that there has been applied 
rigid splint to hold the foot at a right angle to 
he leg. This is done to prevent the pulling ac- 
ion of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles but 
t should not be used as a routine. Valuable as 
t is in certain cases it is more advisable to at- 
ach to the toe of the shoe a supporting spring 
whose tension can be regulated to correspond 
     
                    
     
        
         
       
    
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
with the recovery of the anterior group. This 
may be accomplished with a heavy rubber band 
or a small spiral spring. Attachment may be 
made at the upper end to a garter below the knee 
and at the other end slightly towards the outer 
part of the toe of the shoe. This will help to 
support the anterior group of muscles, but it will 
not fixate the ankle. Similarly with wrist drop, 
the fingers may be incased in thimble-like pro- 
tectors on the ends of corset steels which are 
led up the arm beyond the wrist to compensate 
for the weakened extensors. This will prevent 
the flexors from becoming permanently short- 
ened, and it will prevent over-fatigue of either 
group. 
Whatever apparatus of a semi-permanent type 
is used should be of a character that an attendant 
who is relatively unskilled, or the patient him- 
self, can apply. If the apparatus is cumbersome 
and unsightly the patient will become discouraged 
and disgusted with it and whenever possible he 
will leave it off. If it is heavy it will have a 
tendency to over-fatigue certain muscle groups, 
and with many patients it will therefore be detri- 
mental rather than of value. These three points 
(ease of application, convenience and appearance, 
weight) must be taken into account, and in in- 
dividual cases difficulties must be overcome by in- 
genuity, or the patient must be educated to dis- 
regard them and to recognize their necessity. 
Many exercises, especially those after the sub- 
ject has recovered a certain amount of ability} 
are to be carried out free in a standing position 
This is especially necessary in the so-called fre

          GENERAL RE-EDUCATION METHODS 105 
or gymnastic movements of all kinds. At the 
beginning of the re-education of a patient, how- 
ever, it is not possible to carry out all those proce- 
dures needed by him when he is sitting or standing. 
Most of the exercises may then have to be car- 
ried out when the subject is lying. If this must be 
done a hard couch or a table should be used. A bed 
with springs which vibrates with every movement 
is less satisfactory than the smooth ungiving sur- 
face of a table. If it appears that the exercises 
may have to be carried out for a long period, or 
if usable for more than one subject, a special table 
should be constructed. On this there may be 
fitted such contrivances as are needed to aid the 
patient, in the carrying out of his exercises. For 
many of the movements the table should be pro- 
vided with suitable handles at the head and at 
the side by which the subject may hold when re- 
sistive exercises are being given. A removable 
footboard should be arranged so that during 
many of the arm exercises the patient does not 
become disturbed by the tendency to slide along 
the table. If he is not kept in one place the exer- 
cises will be poorly done and.if the feet and legs 
project over the end of the table the subject will 
pay as much attention to his discomfort as to 
the exercise. A smooth varnished table has an 
advantage in that its surface will permit the de- 
termination of certain activities of very slight 
amount, which even the weight of the pendant 
limb will sometimes prevent. In a very much 
weakened shoulder girdle for example the weight 
lof the pendant arm may be quite sufficient to pre- 
ent an actual movement of abduction, whereas
-P-A-G-E-114
  106 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
when the subject is lying upon the table the me- 
chanical work to be performed in the movement 
is much less than when the arm as a whole may be 
moved. It is advisable also to provide a number 
of bags of sand which can be placed upon the 
table, behind or in front of the subject to sup- 
port him when he is lying upon his side, and 
when movements in the fronto-dorsal plan of the 
body are being carried out. <A table is almost es- 
sential for the proper measurement of the capa- 
bility of various muscle groups, because the ac- 
tion of the individual muscles should be de- 
termined when the movements are free and other- 
wise unresisted by accessory conditions. 
The clothing should be as little as the patient 
can be got to wear. For men bathing trunks 
are advised, and for the women two-piece men’s 
jersey bathing suits or a free bloomer costume 
which does not constrict the waist. In every case 
the clothing must not interfere with the move- 
ments of the legs and of the arms. In those cases 
in which the abdominal muscles are to be exer- 
cised constrictions about the waist during the 
period of exercise are contra-indicated, and the 
closely fitting cotton jersey bathing suit is most 
useful. Through this material the movements 
can be felt and can be controlled without difficulty. 
In all cases in which massage is done the part 
must be bare. 
Since we are concerned with the phenomen: 
of behavior in the processes of re-education of al 
characters, it is important that records be mad 
which enable us to compare the achievement o: 
the individual from time to time. From the pi

GENERAL RE-EDUCATION METHODS 107 
torial side this can best be accomplished by pho- 
tography. Of the various photographic methods 
in use, that of moving pictures is by far the best 
for this purpose. This method of recording per- 
formance is, however, expensive, and it can be 
used only when the subject has sufficient means 
at his command to count little upon the additional 
expense. The initial cost of an equipment for the 
taking of moving pictures of the kinds that are 
needed is not far from $1500, although this may 
be somewhat reduced by using cheaper cameras 
which will make three-quarter size pictures rather 
than the standard film. This also will reduce the 
expense of reproduction to a considerable ex- 
tent, since the smaller films cost less than those 
of standard size. The film must usually be de- 
veloped in a commercial establishment and the 
positives printed there. We may estimate twenty 
cents as the cost of one finished foot of positive 
film, which means ten cents for the negative and 
ten cents for the printing of the positive. The 
positive film can be projected, studied and com- 
pared with past performances. Apparatus may 
now be purchased which permits the stopping of 
the film at any point in order that measurements 
may be made. Any one picture may be compared 
directly with any other one of the series. It will 
readily be appreciated that the cost of this work 
is great, because in a period of an hour there 
may be used two to four hundred feet of film to 
illustrate the various activities of the individual. 
Pictures should be made as frequently as the 
progress of the patient demands it, and in most 
cases it is advisable to have these photographs 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    108 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
made about once a month. Since the work must 
necessarily be carried on indoors, special lighting 
elements must be used in order that a quick ex- 
posure may be properly made. This usually re- 
quires a special room in order that the photo-_ 
graphs may be taken from a vertical position as 
well as horizontally. Recently a camera for the 
taking of 15 feet of exposure has been devised, 
with the advantage that the operator does not 
point the camera obviously at the subject. This 
prevents stage fright. Rapid loading permits the 
use of as many spools of films as are needed. 
For most purposes, however, a much cheaper 
photographic record may be made by exposing a 
plate during the time the patient is carrying on 
an activitity. This will give a picture which 
shows an indistinctness in the extent of the move- 
ment. By the simultaneous photography of a 
rapidly revolving clock hand the time can be 
gauged. The picture also will show simultaneous 
concomitant movements which are used by the pa- 
tient to support or to bring about those activities 
which are attempted. In photographic record 
work of any character it is advantageous to have 
the patient placed in front of a white screen, 
marked with ten em. divisions both vertically 
and horizontally, in order that measurements 
which may be made are comparable and reason- 
ably accurate. It should be needless to say that 
in whatever photographic work measurements 
are desired, it is best that the subject should be 
at a fixed distance from the camera lens in order 
that photographs on successive days or months 
may be directly compared by superposition.
-P-A-G-E-117
  
GENERAL RE-EDUCATION METHODS 109 
In carrying out many of the activities, other 
graphic records may be made showing the quan- 
tity or extent, and the force and time of move- 
ment. The values of these records and other 
ways in which many records are taken are dis- 
cussed in the next chapter, on the measurement 
of performance. Records are valuable for pur- 
poses of comparison with later attempts, and,

whenever it is possible to make such records, this 
should be done. It many cases the records not 
only give evidence of difference in force, time, 
or extent of the activity, but they also show 
differences in quality or in general accuracy. 
This will readily be appreciated from the com- 
parison of the attempts at tracing with a pencil 
a two-inch square. Example of a subject’s per- 
formance at two periods are reproduced herewith.

-P-A-G-E-118
  110 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
Many activities of the hand and arm may be 
measured by the use of large sheets of paper and 
a soft pencil. Comparison can readily be made 
of the activities if the paper is partly transpar- 
ent or translucent so that the records can be 
superimposed and compared by means of trans- 
mitted light. For recording the activity of walk- 
ing one of the best methods is that of using news- 
print paper, about 36 inches in width, which is 
tacked to the floor by thumb tacks, as many feet 
in length being laid down as the room will per- 
mit. Woolen socks are placed on the subject’s 
feet then dipped in a weak solution of perman- 
ganate of potash, and the patient is instructed to 
walk the length of the paper. If a cane or 
crutches are used the ends should also be covered 
with cloth pads which are dipped in the same solu- 
tion. The transfer of part of the solution from 
the socks to the paper leaves a permanent record. 
This record may be filed away for subsequent 
measurement or for comparison with later rec- 
ords. From such a record one can determine the 
character and the extent of the step. Not infre- 
quently at the same time one can determine a 
variation in the force with which each leg is used 
and the amount of dependence upon cane or 
crutch. These records can also be utilized to 
great advantage towards the encouragement of 
the subject just as other records of performance 
are used. Moreover faults in his activities may 
be more readily demonstrated to him and his at- 
tention can the more easily be directed to cor- 
recting the faults than if he is entirely dependent 
upon the verbal admonitions of the instructor.
-P-A-G-E-119
  GENERAL RE-EDUCATION METHODS 111 
In connection with the exercises the patient 
should be accustomed to observe his activities in 
front of a mirror. This is especially important 
in connection with the re-acquisition of those 
movements which are required in vocalization (see 
chapter 11) but the method is equally of value 
in connection with other motor activities. The 
use of long and quite broad mirrors is advisable 
in order that the patient may see all parts of the 
body in action at one time. In some exercises 
it is important that the subject shall carry 
out his activities in a recumbent position. If 
the mirror is used constantly it will be necessary 
to have one applied to the ceiling. This, however, 
is not important. Most of the re-education pro- 
cedures in which the patient’s attention is to be 
directed to his activities and to their refinement 
of control will be carried out with the patient in 
the standing or sitting positions. 
The rule of thumb applied in the measurement 
of the capability of an individual is just as ac- 
curate as it is in relation to any scientific work, 
which means that it has practically no accuracy 
(see chapter 7). It is dependent upon the casual 
examination and determination of more or less. It 
leads to erroneous conclusions and does not result 
in the proper prescription of those exercises 
which are of value. The casual examination, 
which is always a brief and careless one, leads 
to very little good either for the instructor or for 
the patient. Hvery examination which is carried 
out for the purpose of. disclosing the extent of the 
abnormality should be applied as far as possible 
to all parts of the body since frequently unex-

pected inefficiencies are found which sometimes 
are of major importance. This has been well 
shown in the application of the spring balance 
test of Lovett and Martin. 
At the beginning of a course in re-education for 
any subject all exercises should be carried out in 
the presence of an assistant as well as the in- 
structor. There are two reasons for this. The 
first is that the assistant should know what kinds 
of activities are prescribed for and carried out 
by the subject. Secondly, it is important that 
the subject may get the benefit which is very great 
in some cases, of the added personal stimulus. 
In carrying out the re-education work at subse- 
quent periods the assistant will be able to recog- 
nize the most suitable points for encouragement 
and direction. Every action looking towards the 
re-education of a subject should be carried out 
at command. Its time should be regular, and its 
force should be controlled. This cannot be done 
without knowing what the subject’s capabilities 
are, and these capabilities cannot be accurately 
described or transmitted from one operator to 
another in verbal terms or charts. If for any 
reason the instructor cannot supervise a lesson, 
his assistant may be able to carry on the training, 
based upon the knowledge and experience the in- 
structor has gained, and with special instructions. 
Under the immediate direction of an assistant 
who follows up certain routine procedures, the 
patient will improve, but even in these cases it 
is advantageous for the physician or re-educator 
to direct his attention occasionally to the indi- 
vidual patient. This produces or furnishes an
-P-A-G-E-121
GENERAL RE-EDUCATION METHODS 113 
extra stimulus during periods of slight improve- 
ment and its effect is notable in many cases. 
Voluntary codperation is obtained with dif- 
ficulty, or it may not be obtained to any appre- 
ciable extent, in the case of young children and 
with some who are relatively feebleminded. De- 
pendence must frequently be placed upon the 
ingenuity of attendants, mothers, nurses, or 
tutors who may be constantly with the patient, 
and who must then be educated for the particular 
case as re-education assistants. In many in- 
stances rewards are valuable adjuncts. These 
cases are, however, less amenable as a rule to 
re-education efforts. They require much more of 
routine muscle training, and results may be ob- 
tained only over a long period of time, but im- 
provement results even though the exercises may 
be less skillfully applied than with the codpera- 
tive adolescent or adult. 
Some re-education of certain subjects can be 
carried out by correspondence. This can be done 
only after the initial exercises, with the more in- 
telligent subjects and in families in which one or 
more members may be given some special instruc- 
tions applicable to the subject’s condition. In the 
organic cases this can be well done after the sub- 
ject has attained control of his neuro-muscular 
apparatus, and in the psychotic when the reac- 
tions have almost reached the normal plane. 
With the aphasic after the careful examination 
has been made, much can be done by correspon- 
dence with the patient and his family. 
Attention has already been directed to the 
necessity of having the patient adapt himself to 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  114 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
many people in the environment and to meeting 
numerous conditions. At the beginning of the re- 
education of an individual it is best to have all 
exercises carried out by the operator alone with 
the subject, or in the presence of his assistant. 
After the subject has been re-educated to an extent 
that he knows that certain movements can be well 
executed at all times and at command, and that 
other movements cannot, it is well to have the 
subject exhibit his accomplishments to others. 
Beyond the preliminary exercises it is advan- 
tageous to the patient, in so far as his modesty 
will permit, to meet the conditions which he must 
get accustomed to in his daily life. In some cases 
in which re-education is attempted this is of 
greater importance even in the beginning of re- 
education. Certain individuals who show spas- 
modic tendencies (the chronic choreas, paralysis 
agitans, spasmodic laughing or erying accom- 
panying lesions of the lenticular nucleus, and 
those who have tonic perseveration) are cases in 
point. By suitable measures applied to any of 
these cases the re-educator by himself may bring 
about a much more normal activity in the subject 
but when new stimuli, like that of another ob- 
server, are received the subject frequently re- 
verts to his original condition. It is therefore 
essential that self-consciousness or embarrass- 
ment, or whatever else the state may be called, 
should be undermined by training the subject to 
respond at all times, under a variety of condi- 
tions. This applies to the psychotic also, who 
must become social if they are to be normal.

CHAPTER VII 
MEASUREMENT OF PERFORMANCE, 
In all scientific work measurement is not only 
desirable but necessary. Certain of the measures 
we make are necessarily gross and relatively in- 
accurate, but in all work the attempt should be 
made to use as accurate measures as are needed 
for the determination of the limits of the phenom- 
ena with which we deal. When we measure a room 
for a carpet it is not necessary that we shall meas- 
ure its length and breadth to the nearest hun- 
dredth of an inch. Measurement to the nearest 
inch or half inch is quite sufficient. If we wish 
to weigh food for the purpose of sale or purchase 
it is not necessary that it should be done to the 
nearest grain. Weight to the nearest ounce, and 
in a few cases to the nearest half or quarter ounce 
is sufficiently exact for food, whereas when we 
weigh drugs it is often necessary that our meas- 
ure be taken to the nearest tenth of a grain. If 
we employ an individual it is not important to 
measure his working time to the nearest second 
but it is sufficiently accurate to take the time to 
the nearest minute, sometimes to five minutes or 
even to ten minues. These usual methods of deal- 
ing with certain everyday problems may well be 
considered by both the investigator and the pro- 
fessional man in the measurement of the phenom- 
115 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
ena with which they have to deal. Whenever pos- 
sible a measurement of some sort should be ap- 
plied to the thing which is under consideration 
but the limits of the measure required must be 
kept in mind. 
In most cases it is necessary to have a numer- 
ical determination or estimation, and in many in- 
stances it is only by the report of measurements 
that it is possible to represent accurately to 
others what one is concerned with. The phy- 
sician no longer thinks it sufficiently accurate 
to determine in a patient the condition of fever 
or the reverse by feeling him with his hand. He 
applies to the patient a measuring instrument, 
the thermometer, in order that reasonably ac- 
curate data may be obtained, and in order that 
the measurements may be utilized at a later date 
for comparison with subsequent observations on 
the same patient or with other observations on 
other patients. Nor does the physician consider 
it sufficient to feel the pulse to determine the 
systolic or disastolic pressure in the arteries. He 
applies measuring instruments which within cer- 
tain limitations of error can be used for the ac- 
cumulation of more accurate data which are use- 
ful in diagnosis, and which can also be utilized 
for comparison with other similarly obtained 
data from the same patient at other times or from 
groups of patients. 
In re-education advisement and procedures a 
difficulty which has been encountered is that of 
a reasonable measurement of performance of the 
patient which will give an idea of his capability.

       MEASUREMENT OF PERFORMANCE 
  117 
  criteria are not sufficient. It is important to 
know what the defective individual can accom- 
plish. It is equally important to know how his ac- 
complishment varies from time to time under the 
influence of the re-education procedures which are 
being carried out, just as it is important for the 
physician to know how the temperature of the 
typhoid fever patient varies in the course of the 
disease and in accordance with the treatment 
which is instituted. It will be shown later that 
the measurement of performance is also of im- 
portance in the direction that may be called the 
therapeutic or re-education approach. In the lat- 
ter way it points out what should be done. It is 
also known that measurements of a patient’s per- 
formances are of value towards his encourage- 
ment and as a stimulation if the results are prop- 
erly explained to him. This can be done by the 
use either of numerical values or of charts which 
can be simply constructed. 
It should be equally unnecessary to say that it 
is important to determine the capability of a pa- 
tient who appears to be in need of re-education 
as it is to say that the individual who is ill needs 
a careful examination. The patient needing re- 
education cannot be intelligently dealt with until 
those careful tests and measurements are made 
which will adequately represent the condition of 
the patient at the moment of examination. The 
terms weak and strong, large and small, fast and 
slow, have some designating values, but these 
qualitative terms lack that accuracy which is es- 
sential if we are to ‘‘know”’ rather than ‘‘guess,’’ 
and if we are to advise the patient intelligently
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
rather than feed him mental bread pills. If it is 
desirable and important these qualitative terms 
can be put into more scientific ones of strength, 
length, and time. In most cases it is both de- 
sirable and important. How some measures may 
be made is explained in the previous chapter on 
movement. 
It has been said above that the measures are 
of value as an indication of therapeutic or re- 
education approach. By this is meant that the 
amounts of defects which are present are deter- 
mined by making necessary measurements rather 
than by depending solely upon the feelings or re- 
ports of the patient. At the same time the meas- 
urements show the degrees of the defects against 
which our re-education activities are to be di- 
rected. In a subsequent paragraph it will be 
shown how the measurements and the plotting of 
the data are indicative of the emphasis that 
should be given to certain procedures. The meas- 
ures taken from week to week, or from month to 
month, indicate the amount of progress or the 
lack of progress in different directions. They 
show those elements or functions in the indi- 
vidual which need relatively little and those which 
need relatively great amounts of re-education 
attention. 
We may best illustrate the value and some of 
the methods of measurement by taking concrete 
examples. Although the examples refer to the 
extent of movement, the general statement is 
equally applicable to the other characteristics 
with which we must concern ourselves. The pa- 
tients undergoing re-education were paralyzed be-

cause of cerebral lesions. Hach day measure- 
ments were made of the capabilities in accor- 
dance with the various characteristics that were 
thought to be worth observing. These measures 
of extent of movement were made over a period 
of twelve weeks, for two of the arm segments 
and for one kind of movement in each segment. 
On each day five measurements of each of these 
movements were made, and these data are shown

in the accompanying Table II, averaged for 
weekly periods. Examination of the table and 
comparison of results in relation to the normal 
quantity of movement reveal the fact that in a 
period of seven weeks there was a recovery of the 
maximum normal amount of movement of finger 
flexion, whereas the normal amount of movement 
of wrist flexion was not obtained. This fact in- 
dicates that after the first seven weeks the thera- 
peutic attack should have been directed primarily 
to the wrist rather than to the finger movement. 
The individual measurements of another patient 
for part of the re-education period are given in 
Table III. This table shows that the individual 
and the average daily measures are not significant 
and that the variations from day to day are rel- 
atively large. The weekly averages show more

of a gradual improvement than do the large up-

to-day measures, and in those individual serial 
measures which were taken on one day. In later 
work, because the daily measurements did not 
indicate facts of value, weekly measurements

same characteristics of improvement which were 
found by averaging all of the daily observations. 
‘We must also consider the number of measure- 
ments which are necessary to determine the char- 
acter and the amount of a defect, the progress of 
the individual, or the value of the re-education at 
tack. If it was possible to have an absolute meas 
ure of performance for all of the characters whic
-P-A-G-E-129
MEASUREMENT OF PERFORMANCE 121 
we desire to measure, a single measure at any one 
time would suffice, just as one thermometric meas- 
ure is usually sufficient to determine the presence 
or absence of fever. In the chapter on movement 
mention is made of the difficulties in making 
measurements such as we desire. If, for example, 
we desire to determine the extent of a certain 
movement we apply what appliances we have 
which will serve the purpose. The patient 
executes the movement, we record the observa- 
tions. From a critical view of the situation, how- 
ever, we realize that the measurements we make 
are necessarily relative. Their accuracy depends 
upon two factors, or speaking more precisely we 
say that there are two well recognized sources of 
error. One of these is the error of observation of 
the instructor who makes and records the meas- 
urement. His estimation may be relatively rough 
or fine, in accordance with his experience or his 
vision or other personal elements, and in accord- 
ance with the accuracy of the instrument and its 
adjustment. The second error, which is not an 
error in the usual sense of the word, is the varia- 
bility in the activity of the patient, who at one 
time may be able to do a little more or a little less 
than at another time. 
The first of these errors has a tendency to be 
constant, the observer having a proneness to over- 
estimate or to underestimate the amount of the 
performance or to apply his apparatus in one 
special way, and the instrument being equally ad- 
justed for all measurements. Measurements by 
lone observer may be constantly less or greater 
han those of another, even though both observers

  122 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
are equally skilled and as frequently occupied in 
making the necessary measurements. This per- 
sonal equation can be determined and compen- 
sated for, but it is usually not necessary. The 
second error, that relating to the actual perform- 
ance of the patient, is a more variable error be-

cause the condition of the patient, such as fatigue 
or interest or other mental state, will differ con- 
siderably from minute to minute as well as from 
day to day. It is well recognized, however, that if 
several measurements are made, and if these data 
are averaged, there is generally a tendency to 
overcome or to counterbalance the variable er- 
rors in the average. The constant errors are not
-P-A-G-E-131
    MEASUREMENT OF PERFORMANCE 123 
counterbalanced, because they are the same in all 
determinations. If, however, one instructor 
makes the measurements on the same patient or 
on groups of patients from time to time, his con- 
stant errors are of relatively little importance, 
because it is the relative performances of the 
patient from day to day or from week to week, 
to which we attend. 
How the measurements which have already been 
described are to be charted is shown in the accom- 
panying illustration. Two curves are shown re- 
lating respectively to flexion at the elbow and at 
the wrist, Figure 60. In the vertical direction are 
shown the amounts of movement, actually the 
average amounts. The serial weeks of re-educa- 
tion are indicated along the horizontal line. The 
amount of the vertical distance from the main 
horizontal line at any weekly interval shows the 
amount of performance for that particular week. 
On the diagram the points indicating the perform- 
ances at weekly intervals are shown with large 
dots. These dots are connected by light lines 
which make a curve. The inclination of the curve 
indicates clearly whether or not improvement has 
taken place. The upper horizontal line on each of 
the two diagrams represents the usual maximum 
of movement in the normal individual. From the 
lower horizontal line to the upper horizontal line 
is the distance which represents the quantity of 
normal movement. If the tested individual is 
normal the curve of performance would be a 
straight line superimposed upon the upper hori- 
zontal line. In the examples given the ability of 
the patient at the beginning of the re-education is 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  124 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
shown to be much reduced. When, however, the 
curved line approaches the upper horizontal line, 
we say that the patient approaches the normal. 
In comparing the two parts of the figure it will 
be seen that the curve representing the flexions of 
the finger has reached the upper horizontal line at 
the seventh week, whereas at no time in the period 
for which the charting is shown has the perform- 
ance at the wrist approached the upper horizontal 
line. These differences are important to note in 
relation to the conduct of the re-education pro- 
gram. They show that at the end of the seventh 
week little or no further attention need be paid to 
the movements at the finger but that special at- 
tention should be directed to the activities of the 
wrist. Training on wrist movements should, there- 
fore, be continued until the line showing accom- 
plishment, or improvement for those movements, 
has approached or reached the normal line. The 
diagrams show that in all probability during the 
first weeks much more attention should have been 
paid to those exercises which would bring about 
improvement in the wrist segment. 
As has already been noted, plotting of curves 
in this way is of value to the patient for the crea- 
tion of an attitude, for his encouragement and for' 
the securing of his active codperation. For ex- 
ample, the curves can be shown to the patient and 
explained to him. His attention may be directed 
to the lack of improvement in one particular, so 
that he may increase his efforts in that direction,

provement in that segment, and as an example of 
| what is to be expected in another segment which 
has not attained the normal amount of its activity. 
At the same time the charts of improvement show 
progress graphically to the patient, and they re- 
place the instructor’s general statements which 
are not infrequently doubted especially when the

improvement is slow or slight in amount. It is 
possible to compare the patient’s improvement 
with that of another patient. An incentive to 
equal or to surpass the other may also be created, 
and this competition is of special value. 
To this point attention has been directed only 
to the simpler types of movements, curves for 
which are readily constructed when the method of 
obtaining the measurements is relatively simple. 
It should be borne in mind however that practi- 
cally every activity can be represented in the form 
of a curve which will show improvement or lack of
-P-A-G-E-134
    126 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
improvement. In many instances of complex 
activities it may be difficult to represent the quan- 
tities of performance of an activity as a whole, but 
it is always possible to represent it in part. A 
curve of progress can be constructed which will 
represent the course of improvement to the 
patient, however little scientific value it may 
have. There is here reproduced a curve, Figure 
61, for a complex type of activity, that in which 
the individual kicked a round football over a 
lawn. This curve represents the average dis- 
tances the ball was kicked, week by week. Hven 
from a relatively superficial analysis of this ex- 
ercise it will readily be seen that there are many 
variable factors in the conditions which accom- 
pany the experimental procedure, and that the 
kicking is in itself complex and made up of many 
elements. The more important conditions that 
are variable are the placement of the ball, the 
amount and tension of the air within it, the hard- 
ness and wetness of the ground, and the length of 
the blades of grass. A variation in any one of 
these conditions will affect the distance to which 
the ball may be kicked even though the force of the 
kick remains constant. The main factors in the 
complex of the activity are the accuracy of direc- 
tion of movement and the force of the kick. Other 
elements such as the poise of the body and the 
control of concomitant movements are important 
in relation to the two last mentioned. Even 
though the conditions are complex, it is possible 
in this case to represent the results in a manner 
which is obvious to the patient. They can, there- 
fore, be used as an encouragement to him. Fre-
-P-A-G-E-135

quently curves such as these show wide variations 
from week to week on account of the numerous 
variables which are encountered, both external 
and internal to the individual. 
Because of the values to the instructor and to 
patient it is advantageous to construct curves of 
improvement for all exercises or to represent 
the performances in 
graphic terms as far as 
possible. For some com- 
plex activities this can be 7”? 
accomplished only in «@ 
part, because the activity « 
varies in difficulty from , Ly 
time to time. Thus, in

not always on regularly successive days, but at 
times there were intervals as long as three days. 
A total of 42 hours were needed to finish the job. 
Part of the time was consumed in winding up 
the work already done, and on some days, there- 
fore, the amounts of weaving were not greater.

resented by taking the totals or the averages for

six-day periods. When this is done the curve of 
improvement is that shown in Figure 62. It 
should be noted that this curve does not show a 
regular increase in quantity, but if it be desired 
to encourage the patient an allowance for smaller 
performances on certain dates can be made and 
added to the actual accomplishment. This may be 
of special importance at the ending of the job, 
when the ‘‘finishing’’ takes more time. If three- 
day periods are taken for comparison there are 
greater variations. For other complex activities 
measurements may be poor but it is always possi- 
ble to make estimations and to compare longer 
serial periods. In some cases accuracy instead 
of speed should be the data sought. Even in such 
matters as sewing, or in embroidery, where ac- 
curacy is difficult to measure, values estimated in 
numerical terms can be used for the purpose of 
comparison. In all cases in which estimations 
are made, even by those who are not concerned in 
the re-education process, the data will show im- 
provements, especially if the daily fluctuations are 
practically disregarded by combining the measure- 
ments for longer periods.

CHAPTER VIII 
POLIOMYELITIS, OR INFANTILE PARALYSIS. 
Anterior poliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis as 
it is commonly called, has a number of clinical 
forms. These are not entirely distinct and they 
are frequently combined so that the defects of 
different patients may vary considerably, so much 
so that the symptoms of two patients may lead 
an observer to believe that there are two or more 
diseases. Lovett has given an excellent account 
of the various forms, both simple and combined. 
The most simple of the various classifications is 
that by Peabody, Draper and Cochez. They have 
grouped the cases into three classes. The abortive 
form is one in which the infection has produced 
no marked symptoms beyond that of the initial 
fever and its accompanying delirium ete., and in 
which the paralyses, if they exist, are so slight 
that they escape all but the most careful examin- 
ation. The cerebral cases, in which some nerve 
elements in the brain are involved and in which 
the toxic or infective agent acts upon those neu- 
rones to bring about a condition of cerebral par- 
alysis like other cerebral paralyses, in children 
or in adults, due to hemorrhage or to other acci- 
dents. The third group is the spinal group in 
which the lower motor nerve elements are in- 
volved, the paralyses being due to destruction of 
131 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
cells in the mid-brain or the medulla oblongata, 
and especially in the spinal cord. It is this last 
type which is most common. It is considered to 
be typical of poliomyelitis, and it will chiefly con- 
cern us here. Although in poliomyelitis of the 
usual, or flaccid, forms the main manifestations 
are those of paralysis, it is not unusual to find 
that the patient also complains of pains and ten- 
derness over considerable areas. These symp- 
toms are pathologically to be associated with 
interferences with parts of the afferent or sensory 
fibers or cells in the spinal cord. It would be al- 
most unthinkable to believe that, with the ex- 
tensive destructions which sometimes take place 
in the gray matter of the spinal cord, some of the 
afferent conducting fibers and some of the inter- 
calated cells should not also be seriously affected 
or destroyed. Although in many cases there are 
sensory disturbances we are more concerned with 
paralytic conditions that follow the destructive 
lesions in poliomyelitis. We are also chiefly con- 
cerned with the re-education procedures that must 
be directed to the overcoming of, or to the com- 
pensation for, the paralyses. 
Although the resulting paralyses are usually 
limited to one or two bodily segments, the 
paralysis in many cases is widespread. Those 
motor neurons may be involved which control 
practically all the muscles in both arms; or in 
both legs; or those of an arm, a leg, the abdomen, 
and chest, on one side, or the paralysis may be 
spread over the trunk and both arms and both 
legs, involving in these areas widely separated or 
contiguous muscle groups in both halves of the
-P-A-G-E-141
    POLIOMYELITIS, OR INFANTILE PARALYSIS 133 
body. Careful examination of these cases by 
means of the muscle balance test of Lovett and 
Martin reveals that in a very considerable percen- 
tage of cases the paralysis of one muscle or group 
of muscles is not usually complete. Frequently 
parts of muscles have escaped the effects of the 
widespread destruction of the anterior horn cells 
in the spinal cord. Apparently not all the spinal 
cells for the control of certain muscles or muscle 
groups are destroyed. Not infrequently also care- 
ful examinations by available tests show that, 
although certain muscles do not obviously exhibit 
a paralysis, these muscles frequently exhibit a 
weakness compared with corresponding normal 
muscles. With regard to this point Lovett has 
cited the results of the careful examinations of 
10 cases which by ordinary manual examination 
showed that only one leg was affected. By care- 
ful testing with the miuscle balance, nine of the 
individuals also showed weakness of certain 
muscles in the muscle groups of the other leg. 
This result must be understood to mean that al- 
though there was not an extensive destruction of 
the anterior horn cells controlling the muscles of 
the contralateral leg, some of the spinal elements 
were destroyed by the toxin. There was thus 
produced a partial involvement of other muscles 
which was evidenced by the weakening. This 
finding is a good example of the necessity for care- 
ful examination of parts that do not superficially 
appear to be paralyzed and it also shows that the 
determination of even minor defects in all abnor- 
mal cases may be of value. 
The accessory conditions that accompany the 
     
     
                      
-P-A-G-E-142
       134 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
  paralysis in poliomyelitis, as also in the spastic 
paralyses of childhood and those due to cerebral 
syphilis and arteriosclerosis, are of importance. 
Because of the presence of a paralysis not infre- 
quently we find that an arm or a leg which can be 
used readily is used to a much greater extent than 
is normal or good for it. This may result in over- 
compensation and hypertrophy of the muscles 
that are used. Or if in this case the use begins 
during or shortly after the acute illness, the con- 
tinued use of these muscles may overtire them. 
The overtiring tends to bring about in the muscles 
which are extensively used, or in the correspond- 
ing nerve elements controlling these muscles, a 
condition which is practically the same as that of 
paralysis. In other cases in which the paralysis 
is obvious and apparently complete for one seg- 
ment, the arm or leg may be held continuously in 
one position. If this tendency is not properly 
dealt with and overcome, the retention of the part 
in one position is apt to-lead to permanent bony 
changes. This is especially true in those individ- 
uals in whom the poliomyelitis attack has oc- 
curred during childhood or Curing those years in 
which growth is important. Similar permanent 
deformities may be produced by the overactivity 
of nonparalyzed or by slightly paralyzed muscles. 
Thus, if the flexors of the arm are paralyzed, the 
extensors tend to pull the arm into an extensor 
position and to hold it there. This is similar to 
those deformities in the spastic paralyses of cere- 
bral type in which, however, we usually find tha 
the greater strengths of the flexor groups over 
come the extensors and thereby produce contrac
-P-A-G-E-143
POLIOMYELITIS, OR INFANTILE PARALYSIS 185 
tures. In the poliomyelitis cases, although the 
ultimate cause is different from the cerebral cases, 
we find a condition which corresponds, in that 
those muscles which are active or partially active 
can easily overcome those muscles which are con- 
siderably paralyzed or which have relatively little 
strength. This explains the deformities such as 
equinus, or club foot, which is not infrequent when 
there is involvement of the leg muscles. 
Following the acute illness there is evident a 
paralysis. The amount of the paralysis does not 
remain constant, and just as in the cases of cere- 
bral paralysis, a so-called spontaneous or normal 
improvement may appear. Frequently the spon- 
taneous improvement is supposed to be produced 
within the period of six months after the febrile 
disturbance has subsided, but it is now recognized 
that even after a year some voluntary improve- 
ment may take place. An interesting account of 
this by Lovett indicates that in ‘‘one case of four 
years’ duration seventy per cent. of improvement 
oceurred in two months in muscles not being 
trained and four hundred and seventy per cent. 
in the muscles treated with muscle training.’’ 
This shows that even after four years, some so- 
called voluntary or spontaneous improvement may 
take place, but as compared with the improve- 
ment in muscles which are being actively worked 
with by re-education procedures the amount of 
improvement is much less. The same author has 
also cited comparative results in seven other cases 
in which he found that in measurements taken at 
he beginning and at the end of a year, during 
hich the patients had received no treatment,      
     
                                   
  
-P-A-G-E-144
  136 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
there was evidence of a spontaneous gain in power 
in nineteen groups of muscles out of thirty-seven 
muscle groups that were tested. 
The surgical interventions that are needed in | 
certain cases do not concern us here. With this 
exception, the treatment of the paralysis of this 
type may be briefly characterized under two 
heads, rest and exercise. The patient recogniz- 
ing his deficiency and being anxious to overcome 
it, has the tendency always to take too much ex- 
ercise. Hither he wishes to see what he can do 
or he tries to keep up to normal what muscular 
control he retains. As has already been indi- 
cated, in those muscle groups in which relatively 
few muscle fibers are being stimulated through the 
spinal nerve cells, over-exercise may bring about 
the state which is the opposite of that desired. 
It may cause a permanent damage to the nerve 
cells and to the muscles which are over exercised. 
When carried to the extreme the over exercise 
will result in additional paralysis rather than in 
a betterment or an increase in activity. In many 
cases in which the muscles and the nervous ele- 
ments are considerably weakened, rest is of 
greater value to the patient than exercise. Espec- 
ially during the early months following an attack 
of poliomyelitis, few and well regulated exercises 
followed by long periods of rest must be the main 
line of re-education. The emphasis should be 
placed upon the rest periods. In all cases care 
must be taken not to fatigue, or to unduly fatigue, 
the neuromuscular apparatus. As in other re- 
education procedures haste is detrimental. 
Immediately following the onset of the par-
-P-A-G-E-145
  POLIOMYELITIS, OR INFANTILE PARALYSIS 187 
alysis, rest is of much more importance than any 
kind of treatment. At this time, both on the part 
of the patient and his physician there is frequently 
a tendency to attempt active treatment for the 
paralyzed segments, to try to get the patient to 
move whatever can be moved. Massage in its 
different forms is also often utilized to stimulate 
the muscles and not infrequently electrical treat- 
ments are given. None of these should be at- 
tempted for a considerable time after the acute 
febrile disturbances have subsided. The patient 
needs to be instructed in the value of rest, and he 
should be encouraged to rest the affected muscles 
as much as possible. This is primarily for the 
purpose of allowing for the ‘‘normal’’ recovery 
from the acute infective and toxic disturbances as 
much as possible. At this time outside inter- 
ference with the patient’s normal or spontaneous 
recovery should not be permitted. As a rule exer- 
cise should be begun only after several weeks. 
When paralyses have been carefully noted by 
means of the muscle balance tests, it is advan- 
tageous to support by braces, splints, and other ap- 
pliances parts of the body which need support. 
Where opposing muscles are not completely par- 
alyzed, for example in the arm or leg, the patient 
may be materially helped by the use of a brace or 
splint. This support should be used in such a 
position that the nonparalyzed muscle does not 
become permanently shortened as it usually does 
in the non-treated cerebral paralyses. An exam- 
ple of this will make matters plain. Let us con- 
sider a case in which there is a partial paralysis of 
the shoulder muscles concerned in abduction. If 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  1388 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
there is a retention of normal or almost normal 
power in the adductors, if the paralyzed abductors 
are not thoroughly rested and supported by a 
brace, there will result a shortening of the adduc- 
tors. This will then produce a permanent adduc- 
tion contracture. If, however, the relatively 
abnormal pull of the adductors against the weak- 
ened abductors is prevented or compensated for 
by a suitable contrivance, the abductors will not 
be continually pulled upon and stretched, and they 
will not, therefore, be continually fatigued. Such 
a piece of apparatus has a two fold purpose. It 
prevents overstimulation and consequent weak- 
ening of already weakened or paralyzed muscles, 
and, even if these muscles are eventually found to 
be totally paralyzed the use of a support or a 
splint prevents the deformity of a contracture and 
ankylosis. Whatever activity of the abductors 
remains, after the destruction of some of the 
spinal cord cells controlling them, should be pre- 
served until the time comes for active interven- 
tion by exercise. The rest induced by constant 
support will accomplish this. 
In addition to the apparatus for the rest of in- 
dividual muscles and to prevent the formation of 
contracture and ankyloses, special apparatus may 
be needed at later periods for the support of var- 
ious parts of the body which are not supported 
through their own muscle activity. It is not in- 
frequent to find in those patients in whom there is 
an obvious involvement of the arms or an involve- 
ment of the legs a concomitant, but not an obvious, 
paralysis of the abdominal muscles. A wise proce- 
dure to follow in practically all cases in which
-P-A-G-E-147
POLIOMYELITIS, OR INFANTILE PARALYSIS139 
there appears to be any degree of over-weakness 
of these muscles is to use an abdominal support of 
the nature of a corset which will prevent the 
stretching of the abdominal muscles when the 
individual is sitting or standing. If the abdom- 
inal weakness is uncorrected in some way it may 
lead to subsequent symptoms of gastro-intestinal 
disturbance, such as enteroptosis and the like. 
Such a support should be comfortably tight and 
should be placed in position upon the patient 
when the patient is lying down, and when, there- 
fore, the muscles are not stretched by the weight 
of the abdominal viscera. In this connection it is 
almost needless to say that this corset or binder 
must be fitted to the individual patient, and it is 
better to have one especially constructed for him. 
In order that the support may have its best effect 
it is also important that the binder should cover 
the hips and it should be held in place by straps 
which come over the shoulders. 
Braces and similar apparatus for the support 
of other parts of the body may also be needed. 
The true functions of these should be understood 
by the re-educator, and, if possible, their values 
and uses should also be explained to the patient. 
They are accessories—they are to prevent deform- 
ities, to help weak muscles, to overcome the 
greater pull of strong muscles over weaker mus- 
cles of agroup. In themselves they have no thera- 
peutic value beyond this. At no time, except in 
those few cases in which there is total or absolute 
paralysis of a group, should they be considered to 
be primary and to be utilized by themselves as 
means of overcoming any of the paralyses. Ac-
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
tually they are only aids to rest certain muscles or 
muscle groups and to prevent contracture. They 
do not overcome the paralysis, they cannot help 
the weakened muscles beyond protecting them 
from too great strain. Their use should be discon- 
tinued just as soon as the patient is able to make 
his own muscular compensations. They should be 
changed from time to time in accordance with the 
increasing capabilities of the subject, and so far 
as possible they should be discarded when re- 
education has sufficiently progressed. 
Exercises given to poliomyelitis patients may be 
of the two kinds, already described, passive and 
active. The passive exercises should be carried 
out mainly by the various procedures grouped un- 
der the term massage, and by the stimulation of 
the muscles and the nerves by electricity. The 
active exercises which are undertaken are to be 
grouped into two classes. The first of these is 
that group of exercises which are like the activities 
of normal individuals in the execution of move- 
ments as movements. This kind of active exercise 
may be said to be the attempt to get the individual 
to carry out motor activities of definite purposes. 
The second kind of active exercises is that which 
has been called muscle training. Here the effort 
is made to get the patient to concentrate upon the 
contraction and the relaxation of individual mus- 
cles or muscle groups independent of their so- 
called combined values or uses. In the hands of 
certain re-education experts muscle training has 
been found to be very valuable in enabling the 
patient to recognize his absolute control. It is 
especially useful when intelligent patients are
-P-A-G-E-149
POLIOMYELITIS, OR INFANTILE PARALYSIS 141 
being dealt with whose codperation can be easily 
obtained. It has little value in younger children. 
The exercises which are advisable in any one 
case can be determined only after a complete ex- 
amination which has shown the paralyses or 
weakness of individual muscles and muscle 
groups. When the results of the examination 
have been tabulated and the relative strengths of 
muscles compared with those of normal indi- 
viduals in accordance with the table which is to 
be found in the chapter on movement (see page 
68), the appropriate exercises should be planned. 
Although it may be logically incorrect in making 
plans for either children or adults, I have been 
accustomed to keep in mind exercises that will 
correspond to activities which are most needed 
by the patient in his daily life. This has a two- 
fold reason; first, to make the individual use some 
of his paralyzed muscles and prevent a too ex- 
clusive compensation in the non-paralyzed groups; 
and secondly, to encourage the patient by bring- 
ing about improvements that are obvious and 
socially useful to him. It is important, therefore, 
to select those exercises that will tend to improve 
the ability of the patient to the end that he is able 
to use his hand and arm in those processes which 
are needed by him for his daily care, for dressing, 
for eating, for holding, ete., and to use his leg in 
a satisfactory fashion for walking. While this 
plan is not always to be followed accurately, if it 
can be carried out it is of the greatest value in 
impressing the patient with the importance of the 
instruction, and it has also a beneficial effect upon 
the patient’s morale. Giving the patient as it does
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
confidence in the instructor, it provides him with 
the stimulus to follow those other exercises which 
may appear to him to be less necessary, but which 
the instructor advises. It may well be realized 
by the instructor that the other exercises are not 
less important to the patient so far as his general 
activity and welfare are concerned, but the im- 
portance of the patient’s confidence and codpera- 
tion must not be minimized. At times the direc- 
tion of re-education procedures into the more 
immediately useful channels cannot be made be- 
cause the paralyses involve practically all of the 
muscles of a large segment. Such an extensive 
paralysis may make it impossible to direct the 
initial exercises to that part, however important 
the movements of that member may be in the daily 
life of the patient. 
At first, in the carrying out of the exercises, it 
is well for the instructor to demonstrate on the 
patient the activity desired in a certain segment 
by the passive corresponding movement of that 
segment, e.g., flexion, or extension, or rotation. 
The instructor should then urge the patient to 
make a corresponding voluntary movement. This 
method should be carried out with those muscle 
groups which are apparently completely paralyzed 
as well as with those in which some muscular force 
is known to be present. In some cases in which 
the paralysis of a muscle or a muscle group is not 
complete, in which some capability of movement 
is present, it is not infrequent to find that the 
patient can accomplish only a small part of this 
movement, let us say a quarter or a third of the 
whole. When this is found to be the case the 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  POLIOMYELITIS, OR INFANTILE PARALYSIS 143 
instructor should not permit the patient to cease 
his efforts at the point of the patient’s maximum, 
but the instructor should carry the movement to 
its fullest extent, all the time urging the patient 
to assist in the completion of the movement. In 
carrying out these exercises, it should be kept in 
mind, the patient can be materially assisted by 
placing him in those positions in which his muscles 
are not compelled to work against gravity. It 
may be necessary to use a sling or cradle sup- 
ported from a pulley at the ceiling to accomplish 
this for the thigh movements, but for the move- 
ments at the knee, ankle, shoulder, elbow, and neck 
the support can be accomplished through the man- 
ual support of the instructor. 
When it is found that a certain movement can 
be made, freely or assisted, the training of the 
muscles and their exercise against graduated 
resistance is the next step. The instructor is the 
regulator of the resistance, which in all cases 
should be of that quantity that the patient can 
just make the movement. The resistance should 
be great enough so that the movement is as difficult 
for the subject as it can be made. In the resistive 
exercises also it will not infrequently be found 
that the different parts of a movement are of 
different degrees of difficulty for the patient. It 
is, therefore, necessary that the regulation of re- 
sistance should at all times correspond with the 
force exerted by the subject. Until the patient 
can move with normal, or almost normal, facility 
the use of resistive appliances, such as gymnastic 
apparatus and special spring instruments, is not 
to be recommended. These instruments have 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  144 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
either a constant or an increasing resistance to 
overcome, while in the execution of a movement 
the paralytic may have, and frequently has, much 
greater force at the beginning of the movement 
that at the end. If the apparatus resistance is reg- 
ulated for the beginning of the movement, it will 
be too great for the latter part, and if it is reg- 
ulated for the weaker part of the movement it 
will have little value for the stronger part. 
The assisted, the free, and the resisted move- 
ments should also be carried out at different 
speeds and tempo. At first slowness and stead- 
iness should be practised, and only later ‘should 
special attention be directed to producing speed. 
Having regard for the warning about fatigue and 
for the necessity of rest periods, exercises on 
rapidly repeated movements should be given. 
These may be dispensed with until the subject is 
able to carry out the special movement with cer- 
tainty, and in only few cases should they be begun 
until there has been much improvement in the 
force and the extent of the movement. 
The exercises which are prescribed for the in- 
dividual muscles or for muscle groups should al- 
ways be carried out under direction. Especially 
at the beginning of re-education no exercises 
should be permitted except those under the im- 
mediate supervision and control of the instructor. 
After the patient has recovered to a certain extent 
it is to his advantage as well as a saving of time 
to the instructor to encourage the patient to carry 
on some of his exercises independently. The 
point at which the beginning of independent activ- 
ity appears advisable is when the first plateau in

the curve of improvement has continued for about 
two weeks. This is shown at A in the accompany- 
ing diagram, Figure 63, which is a curve of habit

ment. It has already been explained that at the

zation of the ac- 
tivity is taking place. 
Another reason for shifting the direction of 
re-education at this time is to prevent a narrow- 
ness in the patient’s activities. With certain in- 
dividuals there is always the danger that they will 
acquire a dependence upon the instructor, and, 
if it is exaggerated by too exclusive a regime, it 
will tend to retard that recovery which is the aim 
of the re-education, viz., the return to normal so- 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
    146 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
cial activities. The patient should be encouraged 
to try out by himself various kinds of actions, in 
order that he may not be restricted in his activ- 
ities by dependence upon the instructor. The 
actions, exercises, or work that should be at- 
tempted at this time should be prescribed, both in 
character and time, but as he progresses it is ad- 
visable to give him greater latitude in self-selec- 
tion. At this time also ‘‘class-work’’ becomes of 
great value both on account of its ‘‘social’’ effect, 
and because of its stimulating effect in another 
direction. If the group activities can be suit- 
ably arranged so that competition enters, the 
rivalry will be that stimulus which will tend to 
“break through’’ previously unopened channels 
of action. 
In cases which I have dealt with it has been 
found that two exercise periods a day are much 
better than one. This is usually possible only for 
those patients who are in hospitals or institutions, 
and less frequently is it feasible in private work. 
In all cases, however, exercises should be carried 
out at least once a day, the amount of time de- 
voted to each case depending upon the amount of 
paralysis of the individual muscles and the dis- 
tribution of the paralyses. It is usually best to 
limit the exercises which are given to a particular 
patient to about 15 to 20 minutes each day at the 
beginning, and gradually to extend this period of 
time so that the patient is given approximately 
two hours a day. The longer periods should be 
broken up by one or more rest intervals, a rest 
interval following twenty, thirty, or forty minute 
exercise periods, depending upon the ability of
-P-A-G-E-155
  
™~ “eat 
POLIOMYELITIS, OR INFANTILE PARALYSIS 147 
the patient to withstand the fatigue of the 
exercises. 
If the number of paralyzed groups of muscles 
is large it may not be possible in the available 
period of time to go over each group each day. 
In such an event there becomes evident the value 
of frequent measurement as an indication of the 
re-educational needs of the patient. Since, by 
measurement and the continuous plotting of re- 
sults, it is possible to determine those parts which 
are progressing slowly or favorably, it will soon 
be discovered which parts are in most need 
of exercises and which are least involved. 
When a selection of parts is required, those parts 
should be worked with each day which are in most 
need of this, and less time need be devoted to 
those segments or groups in which the improve- 
ment is continuous, or in which there has been a 
return to almost normal level. 
The use of electricity in poliomyelitis is ex- 
tensive. It, however, is not of as great value as 
the manual exercises because it is not as readily 
controlled and because it does not give as good re- 
sults as the resistive movements which have been 
described. In small doses it probably does no 
harm, but it does little good. Its greatest benefi- 
cial effect is that it encourages the patient to be- 
lieve that muscular activity is possible even in 
muscles that he is not able to move voluntarily. 
In that way he may be urged and encouraged to 
try various movements which he has been unable 
to perform, and which because of this he thinks 
are not possible for him. The only organic value 
of electricity is that it gives a certain amount of 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
ee 
148 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
passive exercise to the muscles to which it is ap- 
plied, but in this respect it is of less value than 
the passive exercise of the nature of massage and 
the active exercises against manual resistance. |

CHAPTER IX 
LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA. 
Although in locomotor ataxia there are numer- 
ous symptoms, there are only three important con- 
ditions which demand attention from the re- 
educational standpoint. One of these is purely 
mental, and the other two are quite unlike other 
re-educational conditions in organic nervous dis- 
eases. The first is the patient’s fear or dread of 
injury, the organic conditions are the lack of con- 
trol of the bladder and the incoérdination in 
movement. 
It has recently been emphasized that a large 
part of the difficulty of the tabetic is due to his 
mental state. From experience he has learned 
that he is not capable of carrying out certain activ- 
ities well, some of which are of importance in 
connection with walking and with other neces- 
sary accommodations in his daily life. Because of 
this recognition of inability he frequently gets 
into a state of chronic dread that he may fall or 
become incapable of carrying out many actions of 
which he is capable when these are demanded. 
The first part of the re-education of a tabetic must 
necessarily be a re-education or reconstruction of 
his mental attitude towards his condition. He 
must be freed from the fear which is obsessing 
him. The fear must be replaced by confidence in 
149
-P-A-G-E-158
150 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
his own ability to carry out those actions which 
he was capable of doing prior to the beginning of 
his difficulties. To bring about this attitude is not 
always an easy matter since not infrequently the 
experiences which have led him to consult the 
neurologist or the re-education expert have been 
of those characters which emphasize or produce a 
constant dread of impending harm, that he will be 
run: over, or that he will fall and injure himself 
through his incapacity. The fact, however, that 
he consults someone regarding his deficiencies, 
that he presents himself for the purpose of hav- 
ing the incapacities corrected is the first and, 
doubtless, the most important step in the direction 
of recovery. It indicates that he recognizes that 
the attitude of hopelessness or of fear may be 
replaced by an attitude of hope and of confidence. 
Until well on in the progress of re-education 
at no time should the instructor ask such a patient 
to carry out any kind of difficult action which may 
cause him to lose his balance and thus emphasize 
the fear. Whenever the patient is standing it is 
important that he should have the means of self- 
support immediately at hand if his actions result 
in considerable swaying and a tendency to fall. 
In these cases many of the exercises are to be per- 
formed first when the patient is standing close to 
a wall and with a chair on either side. The chair 
backs should be placed so that he may grasp them 
for support if occasion arises, or so that he may 
hold them as a constant support when his regular 
leg exercises are being carried out. The provision 
of means for protection furnishes the patient 
knowledge that it is not possible to injure him- 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  LOCOMOTOR ATAXTA 151 
self. This physical support and the continued 
suggestion and persuasion of the instructor will 
soon overcome the fear, and will also give to the 
patient a better attitude regarding his own cap- 
ability and his future attainments. 
The other two conditions which are found in 
the tabetic which require re-education are his lack 
of ability to control the bladder and his ataxia or 
incoérdination. The paralysis of the sphincter 
and the attendant impossibility of physiologically 
acting upon the smooth muscles in any certain 
manner leave little to be done. The most that can 
be accomplished is to set for the patient those 
exercises for his abdominal muscles that will en- 
able him to partly compensate for the inactivity of 
the smooth muscles of the bladder. He must be 
instructed to void urine at stated intervals after 
drinking and to regulate the number of voidings 
in accordance with the amount of liquid which has 
been taken. When the abdominal muscles can be 
suitably controlled so that they compensate in 
part for the inaction of the bladder muscles, much 
of the discomfort of the patient disappears. His 
mental state is also improved thereby, because the 
use of appliances for the collection of urine can 
largely be dispensed with. His physical comfort 
and his confidence are increased. 
The ataxia or incodrdination must be dealt with 
in the same manner as other motor defects. In 
conjunction with the ataxia, the patient not in- 
frequently exhibits considerable muscular weak- 
ness. He is seen usually only after the early 
stages of the disease have passed, when he has at- 
tempted to compensate for his loss of codrdination
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
by limiting his activity to a great extent. Be- 
cause of the inactivity the muscles have then lost 
their tone, and this must be regained if the quick- 
est and greatest benefit is to be obtained by the 
patient. 
Many interesting facts regarding tabetics have 
been recorded which indicate the value of certain 
lines of procedure in re-education. In many in- 
stances the attack must be individualized in or- 
der that it may have the benefit which is desired. 
In recent years Maloney, who had under observa- | 
tion a number of tabetics who were blind, found 
that the tabetics of this type did not exhibit the 
marked incodrdinations or inaccuracies which 
were found in most patients who could see. This 
observation suggests a change in re-education 
method from that recommended by Frenkel. 
Maloney’s plan of procedure in the re-education of 
a patient was based upon the assumption that 
most of the body activities or collocations of 
movement are normally carried out in connection 
with the eyes. In these activities both vision and 
the kinesthetic sensations from the eye-ball move- 
ments take part. He believed that in a tabetic 
who shows considerable incodrdination a large 
part of the defect is due to the dependence of the 
individual upon the visual sensations and upon 
the sensations of eye movements, that, in fact, 
these two sensations act as a control upon the 
general body activities. As a corollary, there 
follows the conclusion that if the patient is in- 
structed how to move the part or parts without 
looking at them, and is trained to move these parts 
without reliances upon the visual and visual-
-P-A-G-E-161
  LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA 153 
motor sensations re-education is most readily ac- 
complished. It is undoubtedly true that the lim- 
itation of the patient’s attention to the movement 
in itself is a process of great value in the recov- 
ery of accuracies of movement. There can be no 
question that in the performance of many of our 
daily movements we do rely to a considerable ex- 
tent upon vision. Nevertheless, even the most 
casual observations by the pedestrian of himself 
as he walks about will show that the dependence 
is not very great. He walks along the street, 
makes the adjustment to other pedestrians, opens 
a door, and carries on many other activities con- 
cerned in locomotion while he is looking into shop 
windows or at the traffic. The eye is available 
for use, but it is not used in the manner and to the 
great extent that Maloney believes it is employed. 
The experiment of Stratton, in which he was able 
to demonstrate the possibility of rapid education 
of a normally visual subject to compensate for the 
inversion of the retinal images, is an indication 
that compensation for certain visual sensations 
may readily be accomplished. The visual and 
visuo-motor sensations are not always depended 
upon. In some cases, however, the visual and 
visuo-motor sensations are important in bring- 
ing about the finer activities or finer codrdinations 
which are important in our daily life. A simple 
experiment helping to demonstrate this is that of 
attempting to write one’s signature with the eyes 
closed. Without the visual sensations the per- 
formance is irregular. 
Another fact of interest to us in this connection 
is that the professional dancer and the acrobat 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
can frequently continue their occupations for a 
long period after the beginning of tabes dorsalis. 
When, however, an individual recognizes the nec- 
essity, but realizes a partial inadequacy, for the 
fine codrdinations he may give up trying, and ob- 
sessed with fears of failure or of injury he will 
execute his movements more awkwardly and less 
accurately. With these individuals the giving up 
of their activities means the giving up of their 
occupations. If the onset of the disease is grad- 
ual the continued exercise in their occupations 
compensates for the loss of those afferent impulses 
which are present in normal people, and which 
help to bring about the proper codrdinations. It 
is doubtless true that some patients can be trained 
best by having many of their exercises carried out 
when they are blindfolded. It is equally true that 
some patients recover more readily when they 
have both the visual and the visuo-motor sensa- 
tions to assist in the control of activities. This is 
especially true for the fine codrdinations in which 
the accessory sensations assist in normal people. 
The exercises which have been prescribed by 
Frenkel are well known and need not be described 
in full at this time. For convenience the more 
important of these have been described in many 
texts, but references should be made to the more 
extended description in Frenkel’s book to which 
the reader is directed. 
Exercises recommended for these patients who 
are not able to sit or stand are carried out on a 
bed or the floor, and they are mainly of the simple 
type (flexion, extension, rotation), with some of 
the more important codrdinated activities, such
-P-A-G-E-163
LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA 155 
as lifting one leg and placing the heel of that foot 
on the knee of the other leg. The floor or bed 
exercises are followed by those in a sitting or 
standing position when the subject becomes able 
to sit or stand. For those who are not bed cases 
the sitting and standing exercises may be used 
from the beginning. The main exercises of this 
kind are: those of (1) standing from a sitting 
position; (2) the elements of walking movements; 
(3) complexes of walking activities; (4) the gym- 
nastic ‘‘dip’’ and ‘‘half dip’’; (5) balancing, with 
and without support, and (6) trunk movements. 
Although frequently it is reeommended that the 
exercises be given twice a day in half hour periods, 
in many instances periods as long as a half hour 
are too fatiguing, and they should be shorter but 
may be more frequent. The ability—and the 
fatiguability—of the subject should be the guide. 
This is true for the character of the exercises as 
well as the length of the exercise periods. 
In dealing with the tabetic the first essential is 
to get him in a relaxed condition, and to relieve 
him from the tension which is constantly present 
when he is carrying out his daily round of activ- 
ities. This relaxation can best be brought about 
by placing him in a reclining position and by the 
use of gentle massage. When he is thoroughly 
relaxed the observations regarding his capabilities 
may then be begun. Variations in strength and 
accuracies of movements may be investigated as 
in any other case which requires re-education. 
Since, however, the tabetic is usually tense it may 
be necessary during the course of an examination 
or during the course of any re-education period to 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
156 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
require frequent reclining and massage periods 
so that the relaxation of the individual is kept at 
its greatest height. 
In carrying out any movement, either for pur- 
poses of examination or of re-education, the at- 
tention of the patient should not be directed vis- 
ually to the movement. It is not necessary to keep 
the patient blindfolded but his eyes may be 
directed to something in the room. This is im- 
portant in order that he shall not know or cannot 
see how inaccurate his movements are. A cloth 
screen which can be placed before the eyes or a 
magazine which is to be read will advantageously 
give the instructor the opportunity of making his 
measurements and carrying out his preliminary 
exercises without the interference of the patient’s 
visual sensations. By this means apprehension 
and fear are not produced or strengthened in him. 
It is a well known fact that when an individual, 
however skilled he may be, is carrying out a move- 
ment to which he is unaccustomed, this movement 
will be poorly performed. If the tabetic in whom 
the movement is usually incodrdinate is asked to 
earry out an unusual movement it will be more 
ataxic. If at the same time this inaccuracy is 
appreciated through the visual apparatus it tends 
to ‘‘force’’ the subject. He feels compelled to 
check the movement and to force it into the proper 
direction. In doing this he uses much more energy 
than the normal man, and frequently the result is 
worse than if he is not permitted to look at the 
activity at all. 
The special exercises which are carried out 
with the tabetic should be initiated with the in-
-P-A-G-E-165
LOCOMOTOR ATAXTA 157 
dividual in the supine position. These should then 
be extended to the position in which he is prone. 
He should be exercised in all types of movement, 
especially in those for which he has shown a lack 
of capability, until he becomes capable of carrying 
out these movements at command, accurately and 
quickly but without the aid of the eye. Next 
should follow movements of progression, or crawl- 
ing, when the patient is on all fours. Then when 
lying on his back he should practise the simultane- 
ous movements of the arms and legs; two, non- 
corresponding members such as an arm and a 
leg ; two corresponding members at a time, like the 
legs; the arm on one side and the leg on the same 
side; the arm on one side and the leg on the op- 
posite side of the body; then the four members 
at once. These exercises are followed by similar 
ones in the sitting position until the subject ac- 
quires an ability to carry out all types of move- 
ments properly. The final step is when the patient 
is made to carry out all those activities in the 
standing position. 
In the first periods of re-education it has been 
said that exercises should be carried out only in 
the prone or in the supine position. In subsequent 
exercises even though a patient is able to carry out 
many movements in the sitting or standing 
position it is mentally valuable to him to have 
some exercises conducted when he is lying down. 
If the patient has recovered his normal attitude 
towards the capability of movement, when he 
realizes that it is only a question of time and care 
before he can bring about all those actions which 
are necessary for him in his daily life it is fre-
-P-A-G-E-166
  158 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
quently encouraging to him to see what he is ac- 
complishing. This point may be reached within 
the first week or two of his re-education after 
which it is no longer necessary to keep him from 
making the visual-motor associations for the con- 
trol of his activities. In this respect it is im- 
portant to keep in mind that the improvement of 
the patient as shown by careful measurements 
which are taken from time to time are much more 
important in determining the direction and the 
course of the treatment than theoretical consider- 
ations of the use or nonuse of the visual apparatus 
or of the importance of substitutions of the skin 
sensations for the so-called kinesthetic sensations. 
In the training of the individual, attention must 
not be solely directed to the so-called locomotor 
apparatus for progression, handshaking, eating, 
and the like. The head and the eyes must not be 
neglected. Movements of these parts are not in- 
frequently as ataxic as the movements of the legs, 
and the segments require training to some extent 
even though it may not be to the same extent that 
is required for the arms and legs. For the esti- 
mation of the head movements and to control the 
exercises which should be carried out, special ap- 
paratus is frequently needed. Apparatus for this 
purpose is frequently of considerable complexity 
in order that all of the movements of the head may 
be controlled. Expensive and complicated appar- 
atus is not required. A convenient and easily con- 
structed apparatus for this purpose may be made 
as shown in the accompanying illustration, Figure 
64. This apparatus consists of soft iron wires 
made to fit the head like a cap, to which are at-
-P-A-G-E-167
  LOCOMOTOR ATAXTA 159 
tached four wires about 4 to 6 inches long ex- 
tending from the circumference back and front 
and on both sides, and another wire is at- 
tached at the point where the cap wires join 
at the top of the head. The subject is seated on a 
chair or on a stool and the instructor is seated 
in front of him. Behind the patient a screen is 
placed on which vertical and horizontal lines are 
a

the head, and for controlling exercises. 
marked. The instructor can direct the movements 
of the patient and observe on the measuring screen 
the extent to which the activities are properly car- 
ried out and at the same time he can direct the 
patient in the correction of the motor defects. 
When the subject reaches the point at which he can 
direct and correct his movements in front of a 
mirror the same arrangement is made. 
The eye movements are much more difficult to 
exercise and to determine. The only certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
methods of determining the extent and direction 
of the eye movements is the photographic method. 
This is not especially useful in the carrying out 
of the re-education exercises, but in those cases in 
which the additional expense is not prohibitive it 
may be used to demonstrate the improvement. 
The apparatus is complex and will not be 
described here. Dependence must be placed al- 
most entirely upon the observations of the instruc- 
tor, but much of this observation is sufficiently ac- 
curate to bring about those directions which are 
needed by the patient. Exercises like the follow- 
ing are of value to bring about codrdinated eye 
movements. The instructor should seat himself 
opposite the patient, holding in his hand a black 
rod the end of which is painted white, or an orches- 
tral conductor’s wand with a small lamp at the 
end. The patient is instructed to focus his eyes 
upon this point and to follow it in all of the move- 
ments which are made. The movements of the rod 
are then carried out in the three planes, and the 
eye movements are observed. Observations 
should be made on each eye singly, and on both 
eyes in their simultaneous activities. The rod 
should be brought from outside the visual field in- 
wards and carried from inward outward. The 
movements should be from left to right, from 
right to left, from upwards downwards, from 
downwards upwards. The movements of the rod 
should be regulated so that some of the move- 
ments are slow and others are rapid. When it is 
found that the patient is capable of following the 
painted end of the rod at all times constantly and 
well, two rods may then be used, one in each hand
-P-A-G-E-169
LOCOMOTOR ATAXTA 161 
of the instructor. Varying combinations of the 
positions of these rods may be used. The subject 
should be instructed to focus on one, but at the 
word of command quickly and accurately to direct 
his gaze to the other. When these activities can 
be carried out without great difficulty the patient 
should then be instructed to combine the move- 
ments of the eyes, and the head so as to bring 
about convergence and accommodation by the use 
of these two parts. Here the procedures will vary 
both in number and in quantity in accordance with 
the capability of the individual to learn. The in- 
structor must frequently exercise his ingenuity 
to bring about experimentally those conditions to 
which the patient must adapt himself in his daily 
life. 
Exercises for the legs are of greater importance 
to the individual at the beginning in order that he 
may be able to walk. Too exclusive attention 
must not be directed to these segments, for it is 
equally important that the subject should re- 
acquire the ability of dressing himself, of eating, 
of writing, and of using his hand for those num- 
erous activities in which the hand must be em- 
ployed. When he has been re-educated to the 
extent that he is capable of walking on a smooth 
surface, he should be exercised in lifting his leg 
to appropriate heights and to stand steadily when 
mounting steps. He must be taught to walk on an 
uneven surface where the unevenness is a slant 
to one side or forward or backward, or where 
there is an actual unevenness such as may be pro- 
duced by variation in the heights of different 
parts of the walk. The latter can be accomplished

ercises in walking over an

which the subject is walk- 
ing on a slant can be ecar- 
ried out in the re-educa- 
tion institute by using 
heavy wide boards which 
are slanted in the differ- 
ent directions which are 
needed. For office or home 
use these appliances are 
constructed very simply 
by using two or more 
boards placed upon spe- 
cial supports which - are 
wedge-shaped and of dif- 
ferent thicknesses at the 
sides. Diagrams of some 
of the ways in which the 
apparatus can be made are 
shown in Figure 65. Two 
boards, 114 inches thick 
and about 10 feet long, are 
required, and three sup- 
ports of each kind that are 
found most useful. The 
illustration shows an ar- 
rangement in which one 
foot is used on the level 
and the other foot on an 
inward incline. The

needed to help to overcome the hyper-extension 
which is sometimes present. The bowing at the 
knees can be overcome or can be helped by a sim- 
ple bandage, an elastic one being sometimes suffi- 
cient. Sometimes when the hyperextension is 
very great it is necessary to use appliances in the 
form of braces which are more frequently needed 
in the re-education of cases of spinal paralysis, like 
   
-P-A-G-E-172
  164 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
those following poliomyelitis. In general, how- 
ever, supporting appliances needed for the tabetic 
are few in number. The fewer that are used the 
more confident in his own ability does the patient 
become and the more quickly does he recover his 
voluntary control. During part of his exercises, 
it may be necessary to supply the patient with 
crutches, but these should never be used if a cane 
will accomplish the purpose. During the re- 
education exercises with some subjects a cane may 
be needed, but this should be discouraged as much 
as possible and it should be discarded as soon as 
practicable. If it increases the self-confidence of 
the patient, it may be used when he walks abroad 
among crowds or in unusual situations. What is 
needed above all is to get the patient to depend 
upon himself and to use all the means at his dis- 
posal for the purpose of producing the movements 
of normal quality and extent. Too great de- 
pendence upon his eyes, too great dependence 
upon bandages or splints of any kind or upon 
crutches or canes or other accessories is not to be 
permitted. The patient must be taught to move 
freely and confidently. If a support of any kind 
is needed it should be provided but this should be 
determined only after careful examination. The 
support should be prescribed in exactly the same 
way as the exercises. Moreover its use should be 
prescribed: when it is to be used; how often; when 
it is to be discarded; when it is to be replaced by 
something else, and whether it is to be used con- 
tinuously or not at all. 
Not infrequently the tabetic shows muscular 
weakness. This has already been described as a
-P-A-G-E-173
  LOCOMOTOR ATAXTA 165 
weakness due largely to inactivity. It is due also 
to the perverse idea that he is not capable of mov- 
ing. Although the difficulty may be mental to a 
very great extent, tests with the muscle balance 
like those for the poliomyelitis patient are ad- 
visable. They may show an objective weakness 
and if this is suitably shown, exercises should be 
prescribed to overcome this defect. The strength 
of the muscles can be partly brought back to the 
normal condition by massage and other passive 
exercises as well as by active exercises without or 
against resistance. A convenient method of in- 
creasing the strength of a muscle group in the 
condition of locomotor ataxia and in those other 
states which show irregularities in activity is to 
have the patient execute a movement of a certain 
character to the greatest possible extent and to 
hold the limb in that position as long as it can be 
held. This results in fatigue, but fatigue is normal 
and is not to be entirely discouraged. It should 
not be permitted to go to the extent that the muscle 
or nervous system is exhausted. It will be found 
that at first a patient is incapable of holding a 
certain position for more than a few seconds. 
Gradually, however, the strength of the muscle 
increases and the continuation of these exercises 
brings the muscles to the point that the posture 
‘can be held for a minute or more. 
- In the execution of the movements that are 
prescribed they should be carried out slowly at 
first, but with increasing speed in accordance with 
their characters and as the training progresses. 
Until the necessary movements can be carried out 
with accuracy, which, as has already been men- 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
tioned, means sufficient speed, sufficient strength, 
and sufficient extent, all of the elements sufficient 
in amount that they are appropriate to the indi- 
vidual movements, the patient cannot be said to 
have completed his re-education. 
It has been mentioned and will be mentioned 
again in relation to other re-education cases, that 
it is important that the exercises or performances 
of the individual shall be carried out not only in 
the presence of the instructor but under conditions 
in which other observers are present. This will 
tend to give the patient confidence in his ability to 
walk in public. A good procedure to follow, after 
the patient has recovered from the fear and has 
attained a considerable amount of personal confi- 
dence in his ability to move the various parts of 
his body, is to have two or more subjects in a 
class so that each becomes accustomed to a num- 
ber of individuals about him when his exercises 
are being given.

  CHAPTER X 
CEREBRAL PARALYSIS. 
In cerebral paralysis the outstanding feature is 
that of inability to carry out movements with one 
or more bodily segments. In addition to this 
primary inability, in those cases in which the 
paralysis has existed for long periods of time it 
will be noted that certain muscles are tightly con- 
tracted. The limb of which these muscles are a 
part is not held in a natural position, but it is 
rigid and flexed. The muscular rigidity and the 
flexion just mentioned, which together are called 
contracture, begin in some instances within a few 
days after the destruction of the cerebral cells or 
connections. The early appearance of rigidity is 
usually in the cases where there has been a de- 
struction of the cerebral cortex. In other 
instances the contracture may not develop for 
weeks. The contracted state which develops late 
is most frequently associated with subcortical 
lesions of the motor, or pyramidal, tract in some 
part of its course from the internal capsule down- 
wards. In the long standing cases, in addition to 
the paralysis and contracture there may be shrink- 
age of the muscles. When this atrophy is investi- 
gated it is found to be dissimilar to that produced 
by lesions of the lower neuron (as in poliomye- 
litis), in that the muscles do not completely waste 
167 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
away, and in that its physiological reactions, 
especially noted in connection with electrical stim- 
ulation, remain normal. Examination of the 
muscle cells under the microscope in cases of cere- 
bral paralysis shows that they have retained their 
normal appearance, and that they cannot be differ- 
entiated from the cells of unparalyzed muscles. 
The three conditions, inability to move, contrac- 
ture and slight atrophy, must be dealt with in the 
re-education process. In carrying out the re-edu- 
cation procedures it is not necessary to direct a 
therapeutic attack against each of these defects 
separately because those procedures that are most 
useful work to overcome the defects simultane- 
ously. For our purpose here, however, we may 
deal with the conditions separately and describe 
the methods of use of the re-education processes 
which can be applied to overcome each defective 
state. While it may be anomalous to state the 
matter in these terms, the best way of describing 
what must be done to overcome the paralysis is to 
say that the patient must move, he must make 
voluntary movements. By this is meant that the 
patient can help to overcome and actually over- 
come the paralysis best by his own voluntary 
efforts. By carrying out those procedures which 
are intended to overcome the contracture and the, 
atrophy, he will be helped to this end. 
First, let us consider the atrophies, which are 
due to disuse. The atrophies can be easily over- 
come by those measures which are commonly used 
to increase muscular tone and strength. The in- 
dividual muscles must be exercised, by massage 
and other passive movements, to compensate for
-P-A-G-E-177
  CEREBRAL PARALYSIS 169 
the voluntary disuse. In the examination of a 
patient it will be found that some muscles atrophy 
more rapidly and more completely than others. 
The quantity or amount of atrophy varies in each 
case, depending upon the duration of the paralysis 
and upon the care given to the patient. Most fre- 
quently the greatest amount of atrophy is located

tures which may be encountered and which must

in those muscles which make up the thenar and 
hypothenar eminences of the hand, in the deltoid 
muscle, and in the tibial-peroneal group in the 
leg. In dealing with the atrophy efforts should be 
made to increase the circulation, and thus the food 
supply and elimination, of the muscle. This can 
be done partly by the alternate application of 
heat and cold, as well as by exercises. The exer-
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
cises may be given partly by electrical stimuli and 
partly by manipulation. The manipulations are 
those that are commonly described as passive 
movements and massage. The use of these 
measures should be carefully controlled. Too 
much stimulation is frequently worse than none. 
Care must be taken that the manipulations and 
massage do not unduly fatigue the muscles, which 
condition is very apt to exaggerate the disability. 
It is best to massage the individual muscles not 
longer than one to two minutes for each at the 
beginning of the re-education, and to increase this 
time slowly and gradually so that it reaches the 
limit of about three to five minutes for each 
muscle. By other manipulations the parts to 
which the muscles are attached and on which they 
normally work are moved in all possible directions. 
The contracture is due to the strong pull about 
a joint of a larger muscle which is not balanced 
by a weaker antagonist. This imbalance of a 
larger muscle produces in the upper limb adduc- 
tion of the arm and flexions at the elbow, wrist 
and fingers. In the leg there is usually extension 
of the foot, and there may be flexion at the knee. 
The distribution and the degree of contracture 
are slightly different for individual patients. 
When a patient who exhibits very marked con- 
tracture at the elbow is examined it may be found 
that the angle made by the forearm and arm, the 
elbow joint being taken as the center of rotation, 
is 60 degrees. The normal position is 180 degrees, 
or a straight line. The first thing to accomplish 
is to straighten the arm. The tightly contracted 
shortened flexor must be stretched and relief given
-P-A-G-E-179
  CEREBRAL PARALYSIS 171 
to the lengthened extensor. The contracture is 
at first very difficult to overcome. At first 
straightening can scarcely be done by more than 
five to ten degrees without causing the patient 
considerable pain. Resistance to manipulation 
is immediately perceived. However, means are 
at hand which when properly utilized will over- 
come the increased tonicity and contraction. The 
two methods which I have found most useful are 
as follows: the hand is firmly grasped by the oper- 
ator with his two hands, the whole arm of the 
patient is vibrated very rapidly and with very 
little excursion, and at the same time traction is 
applied to straighten out the fingers, the wrist and 
the forearm. At the first attempt the contracted 
fingers may not be moved much, and the flexion at 
the elbow may not be much changed. After a 
brief rest, this may be repeated, with increased 
success. The same manipulation may be made 
with the same segment several times, each time 
usually with a better result. After the contracted 
muscles are relaxed in this way the extended arm 
is brought over across the chest to a more com- 
pletely adducted position very slowly, and it is 
then moved backward very slowly to an abducted 
position. Movements of this kind are carried out 
in all directions about the shoulder joint and the 
elbow. It takes considerable experience to make 
the vibratory movements fine enough and quick 
enough to get the best effects. It has been my 
experience that the effects are most easily pro- 
duced when the vibratory movement has the 
character of a fine tremor where the individual 
contractions and relaxations are almost imper- 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
ceptible. The explanation for this is that a quick 
and extensive pull on a contracting muscle tends 
to increase its contraction, whereas slight stimuli 
help in relaxation, especially if the stimuli are 
rapidly repeated. Each slight pull tends to ex- 
tend the contracting muscle, very slightly to be 
sure, but with the great number the stretching is 
gradually accomplished. This vibration causes 
no pain to the patient, but the quick extension is 
accompanied by pain, and is strongly objected to. 
If the part which has been vibrated is permitted 
to rest, the extension may persist for a relatively 
long time, ten minutes to a half hour, but grad- 
ually the limb assumes its position in contrac- 
ture. 
After the relaxation has been produced in the 
manner described, other passive exercises of the 
parts of a segment are to be carried out. It will 
be found that after a few of these exercises are 
given the flexor muscles have a tendency to 
shorten again and to go back to the condition of 
contracture which was noted at the beginning of 
the treatment. When there is a recurrence of the 
contracture the vibratory movements must again — 
be carried out, and then passive exercises can be 
continued until we again get the tonic activity. In 
addition to the vibratory method, gently stroking 
of the muscles which are contracted will occasion- 
ally bring about a sufficient relaxation. If this 
stroking (effleurage) is carried on prior to or 
following the vibratory exercises it will tend to 
help to overcome the contracture. By itself effleu- 
rage, however, has not been found to be as 
efficacious as vibration and its value in the over-
-P-A-G-E-181
  CEREBRAL PARALYSIS 173 
coming of a contracture is as an accessory method 
to help vibration. 
The weaker muscles may be exercised by knead- 
ing (petrissage) and by striking (tapotement). 
Those muscles which are tightly contracted are 
not to be stimulated in any way. They are al- 
ready hyperexcitable and stronger than the oppon- 
ents, and whatever is done to them should be to 
lessen their irritability and strong contraction. 
’ The application of heat in the form of stupes, at 
about 110° F., will help to relax those which are 
contracted so that the segment under treatment 
may be more readily worked with. The extensors 
and abductors have in general a lessened irrit- 
ability or excitability. Active massage should 
therefore be directed towards increasing their 
excitability and their power. If they can be in- 
creased in strength they will by themselves bal- 
ance the adductors and flexors. In this way the 
contracture may be partially compensated for or 
even overcome. It is also of importance that the 
irritability of the extensors shall be increased 
so that when slight nerve impulses come down 
from the central nervous system to them they will 
be able to contract against their opponents. Both 
of these results must be sought, on the one hand 
an increased strength for the weaker muscles 
(which may be partly done by decreasing the 
irritability or strength of the stronger) and an 
increased irritability so that they shall be able to 
respond more readily with a contraction to the 
nerve impulses. 
Another means of increasing the irritability of 
the muscles is to vibrate, gently but with a firm 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
    174 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
pressure of the finger, the muscle at the point 
where the nerve enters it. I usually use the med- 
ius finger over the point of entrance of the nerve 
into the muscle tissue but in some cases where a 
greater reaction can be obtained, I stimulate 
slightly above or below. In a man in whom the 
contracture has been of long standing, and fre- 
quently also in the paralytic of recent origin, the 
first or second vibration of the nerve-muscle con- 
nection does not appear to have any great effects. 
If, however, this is repeated daily the vibratory 
movements bring about marked contractions of 
the muscles which resemble the movements in 
clonus. At times also they produce pain. Both 
pain and clonic activity are indications of an in- 
creased excitability, which it is desirable to pro- 
duce if the slight nerve impulses are to have any 
great effect. 
So far there have been described those methods 
of dealing with the individual muscles or muscle 
groups by purely manipulative means. I have not 
utilized to as great an extent as could perhaps be 
used those mechanical means which have been 
found useful replacements for hand manipulation 
in vibration. Vibratory machines, including the 
ingenious but complicated Zander apparatus, have 
been successfully used by many to overcome cer- 
tain muscle defects. For some patients they have 
great value but there is a disadvantage in using 
these modes of manipulation in that the patient 
is not usually watched all of the time and there is 
the danger that many patients will be treated at 
one time, and sufficient attention be paid to none. 
The possibility of over stimulation is always
-P-A-G-E-183
  CEREBRAL PARALYSIS 175 
present. With hand manipulations properly car- 
ried out the experienced operator can gauge the 
conditions of the muscles. By palpation the oper- 
ator can determine whether or not the muscles are 
relaxing or contracting, whether they are becom- 
ing fatigued or are over stimulated, and a variety 
of other conditions respecting tonicity which can- 
not be determined in the application of vibratory 
apparatus or by strapping the part to a Zander 
exercising machine. A similar comment may be 
made with respect to the electrical stimulation of 
the muscles. Much good may come from proper 
stimulation of the muscle by electrical means, but 
so far as I am aware there are no good scientific 
data to indicate the superiority or inferiority of 
this method of stimulation as compared with hand 
manipulation. The apparatus commonly used for 
the electrical stimulation of muscles is painful to 
the skin and much of the good effects of muscle 
manipulation is lost because of the dread of the 
patient and his consequent shrinking from this 
form of treatment. The Bristow coil has been 
advocated and successfully used for muscle stim- 
ulation in other classes of patients, and it seems 
likely that the objection to the use of the induced 
current because of the painful experiences of the 
patient may be overcome by the use of an 
apparatus of this kind. 
In the paralyses of peripheral or spinal origin, 
supports or braces of different kinds have great 
value. In the cerebral paralyses they are of little 
use. They do find application for the support of 
over-stretched muscles. In the form of splints 
they can be of value in overcoming contractures. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
176 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
After a contracted segment has been relaxed, I 
have frequently used a splint to keep the part in 
a normal position for a time. This has the danger 
referred to in connection with the use of vibratory 
appliances, in that the state of the patient’s 
muscles cannot be known at all times. The use of 
a splint should be restricted at first to a few min- 
utes, and in cases of long standing contracture 
where difficulty is experienced in overcoming this 
abnormality the splint may subsequently be ap- 
plied and left on for several hours. The value of 
the splint is to rest the over-stretched extensor 
muscles. Better than the rigid splint are those 
which have springs. For the fingers and wrist, for 
example, I have used long corset steels, one for 
each finger and the five brought together for the 
wrist. These act as partial supports. All bracing 
and splinting have only temporary values. 
The means which have been described are sub- 
sidiary, accessory, secondary, and preliminary, to 
that of getting the patient himself to move. At 
all times, even at the beginning of the course of 
re-education exercises, the patient must be urged 
to attempt to carry out certain activities by him- 
self. At first, because he has been unable to move 
for some time, he will strenuously deny that he is 
capable of moving the part which you ask him to 
move. Perhaps he will say that he has tried and 
tried, and tried again, and has found it impossible. 
Urging that he do this will, however, frequently 
get him to recognize that a certain amount of 
movement is possible in parts which he thought 
were completely incapable of voluntary activity. 
When this point has been reached, the beginning
-P-A-G-E-185
  CEREBRAL PARALYSIS 177 
of his re-education or motor rehabilitation has 
begun. I have had numerous experiences with in- 
dividual patients which illustrate this point. The 
following may be taken as a typical example, al- 
though it should be understood that in individual 
cases the manipulations to be used and the activi- 
ties to be demanded may vary from case to case. 
A young man hit with a high explosive shell had a 
complete hemiplegia involving the face, arm and 
leg segments. This state had persisted for a 
period of about nine months. His arm, unlike 
that of the majority of cerebral patients, was ab- 
ducted, and there was a marked flexion at the 
elbow, wrist and fingers. He entered the room 
hobbling with a cane which he held in his right 
hand. I ordered him incisively to put down his 
cane and take a seat in a chair which was about 
twelve feet distant. He told me he could not walk 
without his cane, but I insisted that the cane be 
laid aside and that I knew he would not fall if he 
were careful. He did as he was commanded and 
found that he was capable of walking, awkwardly 
to be sure, but unassisted by the cane. He reached 
the chair and sat down. I thereupon began the 
manipulations for the relaxation of the muscles 
of his arm. After having straightened the arm 
segments so that the contracture at elbow, wrist 
and fingers had been overcome, and the arm was 
in a normal adducted position, I ordered him to 
take hold of my hand tightly and squeeze it (a 
flexion movement). He denied that he could do 
this, and asserted that he had tried to move his 
fingers ever since the time of the accident and his 
subsequent operation. I insisted, however, that he
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
could do it, and on further urging he discovered 
that there was a certain amount of movement 
possible. Several times I have spoken of these 
cases as being paralyzed, or as remaining par- 
alyzed, on account of a habit of inactivity. While 
it may be scientifically inaccurate to speak of a 
habit of inactivity, from experience it is apparent 
that these patients have been permitted to be in- 
active, because they have a certain amount of 
recognized incompetence. On the other hand they 
may also have a competency of which they are not 
aware. 
As soon as a patient finds there is a capability 
of carrying on certain movements, his tendency is 
to continue to do these movements frequently and 
sometimes continuously. The recognition of his 
unexpected competency and his eagerness to im- 
prove have good and bad features. The encour- 
agement of the patient when he finds that there 
is a capability of movement is the best feature, 
his over-anxiousness to return to a perfectly nor- 
mal state is the bad feature. A few words may be 
said in explanation of the latter. In paragraphs 
above I have frequently called attention to the 
fact that the muscles must not be over fatigued. 
‘When the patient most anxious to be active finds 
that he is capable of making certain movements, 
the tendency to exercise too much may overcome 
beneficial effects from other re-educational proce- 
dures. He is over anxious to get well and there- 
fore too active; neuro-muscular fatigue beyond 
the point which is beneficial may be the result. In 
many patients a lack of improvement from day to 
day or week to week can be traced directly to their
-P-A-G-E-187
  CEREBRAL PARALYSIS 179 
hyperactivity. The over-activity results very 
quickly, because they are not normal, in a condi- 
tion similar to that in athletes which is known as 
“<staleness.’’ At the beginning of their recovery 
many patients must be continually warned to make 
no efforts towards self-improvement beyond the 
exercises, in quantity and character, which have 
been prescribed. In this respect the patient must 
be dealt with in much the same way as a patient 
undergoing treatment of a chemical nature. The 
use of strychine, glandular extracts and other 
chemicals may be beneficial when given in suitable 
doses, but when these chemicals are left with the 
patient to take as he pleases, and in such quan- 
tities as he cares to take, the effect is frequently 
the opposite of that which is desired. Too much 
emphasis cannot be placed upon the regulation 
of the quantity of treatment, and it has been my 
experience that small doses are infinitely better 
than large ones. In this respect a good rule to 
follow is to give homeopathic doses frequently 
rather than a single large dose at infrequent 
intervals.

CHAPTER XI 
SPEECH DEFECTS. 
For convenience we may divide the numerous 
kinds of speech defects into two general classes: 
the functional, and the organic. The latter con- 
sists of two kinds, not in reality distinct, the 
paralytic and the aphasic. Many of the distur- 
bances of speech are not exclusively of one class 
but frequently are combinations of the two. In 
some instances there is difficulty in determining 
how much of each of the two elements is present. 
In many cases there are combinations, difficult to 
differentiate, in which apoplexy brings about a 
condition of aphasia plus a paralysis of the facial 
muscles. There may be added to this a functional 
disturbance not due to the brain disturbance. The 
method of dealing with these cases must neces- 
sarily differ in accordance with the character of 
the defects. 
Without entering into a discussion, which would 
necessarily lead us far afield, regarding the caus- 
ation of the so-called functional speech defects, 
we may take for granted for our purposes that 
there are two kinds of this class. One of these is 
due to certain mental disturbances, or conflicts in 
the Freudian sense. The other kind is caused by 
faulty habits, or it consists in inaccuracies or in- 
codrdinations of those activities which are needed 
180
-P-A-G-E-189
  
SPEECH DEFECTS 181 
for correct and fluent speech. The incodrdinations 
may be matters of improper acquisition or they 
may be disturbances of acquired speech. In ac- 
cordance with the point of view one would deal 
with some of these cases by means of psychological 
analysis or psychoanalysis, and others would be 
dealt with by correcting the faulty habits which 
are apparent. It is not always possible to de- 
termine that one of these disturbances is purely 
psychogenic or purely a matter of habit form- 
ation. A careful analysis may reveal that both 
of these two conditions are present and how much 
each is to be dealt with. 
Some speech disturbances are purely habit 
states which are normal for the subject, however 
much they differ from the speech of others. It is 
almost unnecessary to say that colloquialisms, 
provincialisms, and the regional speech characters 
of individuals are perfectly normal for them. 
They are recognized by others as peculiarities, 
and they are commonly believed to indicate a 
faulty or defective habit production. The slurring 
speech of the negro, the nasal twang of the north- 
erner, may have some relation to the anatomical 
and physiological conditions of the organs of 
speech, but experience shows that most of these 
peculiarities are due to the way in which the 
speech function has been acquired. The sounds 
which the child makes are those which he hears 
others make. He imitates what he hears and he 
forms a habit of speech which is normal for that 
community. In a community a few hundred miles 
away the same speech sounds do not result in 
those reactions which are readily understood. In  
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
these cases, therefore, we may rightly consider — 
that we are dealing with functional speech differ- 
ences. 
From what has preceded we are justified in 
saying that the proper method of treatment is to 
change these peculiar speech habits into those 
which are less peculiar to the environment of the 
individual. Many times this is accomplished by 
the individual himself without special training 
under the direction of others, but the financial 
success of numerous speech institutes and teach- 
ers of elocution indicates plainly that many others 
need more than their own individual efforts to 
overcome the expressional habits which have 
been acquired in early life. In general two correc- 
tional methods are used. One of these is related 
directly to the movements of the various parts of 
the vocal apparatus. The efforts of the instructor 
are directed to training in those correct move- 
ments which are necessary for the production of 
the combinations of tone that may be readily un- 
derstood by most people. To produce the result 
the attention of the patient is first directed to- 
wards the production of certain individual move- 
ments. These are mainly the movements of the 
lips, the tongue, and the breathing apparatus. 
After the simpler movements can be controlled 
training is directed to the combination of these in- 
dividual movements into the complexes which re- 
sult in the sounds. Some instructors start with the 
individual vowel sounds, then the combination of 
these sounds with the consonants, and finally to 
words and sentences. The other method is to start 
the individual in the production of sounds which
-P-A-G-E-191
  SPEECH DEFECTS 183 
are like those which he hears. Less attention is 
directed towards the individual movements but at- 
tention is directed towards the misdirected parts 
of the whole, and to training those activities which 
are of obvious social importance. 
These two methods may be compared rather de- 
finitely with the methods of teaching swimming. 
In one the individual is taught the elements of 
swimming movements, at first those of the arms, 
then those of the legs, thirdly the combination of 
the two. Finally he is allowed to go into the 
water, and he is instructed to bring about the 
combination of those activities which have been 
individually acquired. By the second method the 
individual is placed in the water and, although 
protected through its shallowness or supported by 
a rope, he is urged to execute simultaneously with 
arms and legs those movements which are neces- 
sary to keep him afloat and to propel him for- 
wards. 
With the timid the first method is usually more 
successful, with many others the second method 
results in an early acquisition, and finer details are 
subsequently learned. In dealing with the fune- 
tional speech defects it is sometimes necessary to 
use both methods. These may be called respec- 
tively the part method and the whole method. In 
those cases in which the tongue is so long that it 
results in the condition known as lisping this 
must be dealt with as an individual type of exer- 
cise plus the exercise of all of the muscles sim- 
ultaneously. In stuttering and stammering con- 
ditions, breathing exercises plus the exercises for 
formation of the different vowels, sibilants, aspir-  
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
ates, etc., are given, and to these are added the 
exercises in the complex movements necessary for 
the production of codrdinated and current speech. 
Those cases in which evidence is at hand to 
warrant the belief that the speech disturbances are 
due to mental traumata or complexes in the Freu- 
dian sense may be efficiently dealt with by means 
of psychoanalysis. This is not the place to detail 
these methods and to explain the results. For 
the better recovery of many patients of this kind 
there must be added to the psychoanalysis special 
speech exercises such as are recommended for 
those cases which are not purely mental, i. e., in the 
sense of being due to complexes and conflicts. For 
some individuals of this group the direction of the 
speech exercises must be those of the individual 
movements, and for others the exercises should be 
in the complex activities of all of the muscles of 
phonation. 
In carrying out exercises which are recom- 
mended it is not infrequently found that the indi- 
vidual is capable of making the proper adjust- 
ments when he sings, whereas the speech adjust- 
ments in ordinary conversation are not well pro- 
duced. This fact points to the value of the utili- 
zation of singing as a subsidiary method in certain 
cases. Music in connection with verbal exercises 
is valuable as an adjunct, but the emphasis must 
not be placed on the music. It is not necessary 
that a tone should be held or that a tune should be 
followed by the pupil. In many instances the 
special value appears to reside in the condition 
that the exercises are carried out in a rhythmic, 
music-like manner. After speech difficulties are
-P-A-G-E-193
SPEECH DEFECTS 185 
overcome by these means the music may be re- 
placed by a metronome. The tune gives way to 
simple rhythmicity. This accessory apparatus 
may be gradually dropped and the individual car- 
ried on by the ordinary methods of speech 
training. 
At this point attention should be directed to 
the overcoming of a difficulty which is encountered 
to a certain degree even among normal people. 
This difficulty is not of such character to demand 
frequent attention of the re-education expert, be- 
cause it is so common, and because it is thought 
to be normal. This is the fact that under certain 
conditions the individual is able to speak correctly 
and fluently while under other conditions he 
stutters, stammers, hesitates, or talks almost 
incoherently. He may chop off a sentence before 
it is finished, beginning a new one, and ramble on 
in an illogical manner or with an indistinct mum- 
ble. In conditions of this character the important 
point is the emotional condition of the individual. 
Some men talk fluently, freely, coherently at all 
times, others only when sitting with a half dozen 
people. Some when compelled to get to their feet 
to address more than the accustomed number, or 
to talk to people whom they do not know, find 
their thoughts fly from them, and their speech is 
hesitating, stammering, and a series of discon- 
nected remarks. This speech difficulty can be 
overcome by practice. In those needing re-edu- 
cation one will not infrequently encounter ex- 
aggerations of this state of affair. The patient 
may be re-educated to the point that he can speak 
fluently and well and he can read without hesi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  186 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
tation to the instructor. When, however, he enters 
a social gathering, the environment produces in 
him a certain emotional condition which results 
in a reversion almost to that state for which he 
consulted the re-education expert. To overcome 
this is sometimes, but not always, a difficult mat- 
ter, since it depends upon the control of the emo- 
tional reaction of the individual towards groups. 
Many times after the patient has been sufficiently 
re-educated to carry out his speech reactions in a 
normal manner in the presence of the instructor, 
the exercises must be continued in the presence 
of one or two or more individuals. Or, a small 
audience must be gathered from day to day so that 
the patient becomes accustomed to other people as 
customary stimuli in his environment. In extreme 
cases, but seldom, it is necessary that the instruc- 
tor shall accompany the pupil into some social 
gatherings to furnish his moral support. This 
can be put in other terms, that the instructor shall 
provide the particular stimulus which is needed to 
bring about properly codrdinated speech. These 
added procedures must be applied with great care, 
because they are apt to lead to great dependence 
upon the instructor, whose efforts must be 
directed towards the production of independence. 
The second large group of speech defectives is 
one which is dependent upon paralysis of parts of 
the vocal apparatus or upon accessory disorders. 
The more important accessory conditions are the 
tremors of the lips and tongue, which prevent suit- 
able movements. Two general methods of dealing 
with these cases are also to be noted. The first of 
these is directed towards the production of com-
-P-A-G-E-195
  SPEECH DEFECTS 187 
pensatory movements which will enable the indi- 
vidual to adjust his controllable muscles so as to 
produce sounds which are distinguishable. The 
second is to give exercises slowly aud demand 
accuracy. The tremors are due mostly to general 
nervous conditions. The paralyses which may 
give rise to speech defects are of two kinds; that 
due to lesions of the lower motor neuron where the 
seventh or facial nerve has been sectioned or de- 
generated, the second in which paralysis of the 
upper motor neuron type is due to the destruction 
of the lowermost portion of the precentral cortex 
or to an interruption of the nerve fibers as they 
pass downward towards the nuclei controlling the 
muscles of phonation. 
In the peripheral paralyses relatively little can 
be done provided the destruction of the nerve is 
not followed by regeneration, or cannot be com- 
pensated for surgically by nerve anastomosis. If 
either is accomplished re-education is largely a 
matter for the individual after the nerve has been 
regenerated. In those cases in which the paralysis 
is due to a degeneration of the nerves little need 
be done beyond that of seeing that the patient does 
not acquire bad habits of speech which may result 
in a permanent defect. How poor speech may 
follow this condition can be understood well by 
analogy. In looking at the walking of a man who 
has had a broken hip or a degeneration of the 
sciatic nerve, with a subsequent complete repair 
of the bone or a complete regeneration of the 
nerve, peculiarities of movement will be detected. 
During the time that the leg of the individual is 
in an abnormal condition either because of the
-P-A-G-E-196
  188 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
fracture or because of the nerve degeneration, 
walking must be carried out in a peculiar manner. 
But, long after the repair of the fracture, and long 
after the functional return in the nerve, this 
method of walking which is entirely unnecessary 
may be continued.. In other words, during the 
abnormal period an abnormal method of reaction 
is carried out and this has led to a special kind 
of walking habit. After the nerve regeneration or 
bone repair this reaction is not necessary and the 
bad or ineffectual habit must be replaced by a 
more normal habit. So also after the regener- 
ation of the nerves concerned in the movements of 
the lips, cheek and tongue. After the muscles are 
movable voluntarily many bad habits of speech 
may persist. These have become habitual and 
are unnoticed by the subject. They are, there- 
fore, not overcome by himself but they must be 
corrected by suitable exercise directed towards 
the production of movements of those characters 
which will result in normal speech. 
In those in whom the paralysis cannot be over- 
come, and this is the case in which the muscles 
have degenerated and also in some cases of cere- 
bral paralysis, it is necessary to attempt to bring 
about compensatory movements which will tend 
to overcome the abnormal speech state. Regard- 
less of what may be done the speech will remain 
indistinct and bad in many of these cases because 
sufficient compensation cannot be brought about. 
With other subjects, however, and these make up 
a very large proportion of the cases of paralyses, 
compensatory movements can be produced which 
largely cover up the paralyses. These compen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
    SPEECH DEFECTS 189 
satory movements can be described when they 
occur, but they cannot be predicted for individual 
patients. All that one can do is to carry the pupil 
through those special exercises for the sounds 
which are difficult for him. In many instances the 
results are discouraging at first but they should be 
carried out regularly until their futility is appar- 
ent or until a sufficient amount of compensation 
has taken place. Many in whom the paralysis is 
permanent and who have been re-educated speak 
well, and only a careful observation will determine 
that the accessory movements have not entirely 
compensated for or overcome the defect. In these 
re-educated individuals speech is recognized to be 
different from the normal but it may appear pro- 
vincial rather than paralytic. 
It has already been mentioned that special re- ° 
education exercises are of value in those in whom 
there are involuntary movements of the tongue 
and lips of the nature of tremor. Much can be 
gained in those cases by systematic, carefully con- 
trolled exercises. The exercises must be carried 
out slowly, great care being taken*by the subject 
in clear enunciation. In those diseases which are 
rapidly progressive, as in general paralysis of 
the insane, it would be useless to attempt re-edu- 
cation of speech. In many others, and they make 
up a large number, where the disease has been 
arrested the attempt can be made successfully. 
The third large group of cases is that group 
known as the aphasias. More than a dozen differ- 
ent kinds of speech defects are grouped under the 
general term aphasia, and for descriptions of 
these individual conditions and of the varieties 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
of defects which are to be found reference should 
be made to those books which deal descriptively 
with this subject. In general, however, there are 
two main types of aphasic individuals which have 
to be dealt with. Probably all kinds of aphasia 
are fundamentally the same, but it is usual to make 
two large divisions. The first of these is the in- 
ability to bring about those codrdinations of 
activities which are needed for the production of 
sounds, and the second includes those cases in 
which the sounds, emitted by another, which are 
matters of speech, are not taken in. In other 
words, it has been usual to differentiate the 
aphasic of a motor type from him who is of a 
sensory type. In practice, however, it is unusual 
to find a pure aphasia, one which is entirely motor 
or one which is entirely sensory. In my exper- 
ience with these patients, I have not found one 
whose difficulty was entirely motor or one whose 
difficulty was entirely that of understanding, viz. 
sensory. Those with whom I have been concerned 
have been mixed, in that there were symptoms of 
motor inabilities or difficulties, and symptoms of 
sensory inabilities and difficulties. Whether or 
not, as some investigators contend, all the aphasias 
are primarily sensory aphasias, to which in some 
patients there may be added certain motor de- 
ficiencies which give rise to the condition called 
motor aphasia, need not be discussed at this point. 
In practice it is well to make the distinction, how- 
ever much alike they may appear from theoretical 
considerations. It is necessary to know how to 
deal with these two aspects. The direction of 
therapeutic measures is dependent upon the pre-
-P-A-G-E-199
SPEECH DEFECTS 191 
dominant character of the defect, whether this is 
largely sensory with a small amount of motor or 
largely motor with a small amount of sensory 
disturbance. 
Before dealing with the aphasic it is necessary 
to analyze the condition and to determine so far as 
practicable the fundamental defects which are 
present. It would be absurd to attempt to teach 
an individual who exhibited an inability to read, 
which is a sensory aphasia of a visual character, 
if the individual is mentally blind. If in other 
words the subject cannot take things in through 
his visual apparatus much time will be unneces- 
sarily lost. It is also absurd to attempt to teach 
an auditory aphasic to understand spoken lan- 
guage if that patient exhibits such defects of 
hearing as to indicate a deafness. Moreover, it 
should be said that the motor aphasic who ex- 
hibits paralytic symptoms must first be dealt with 
as a paralytic and whatever motor recovery can 
be brought about should be produced prior to 
or concomitant with the active attempts at speech 
re-education. 
The motor aphasias are of different types, only 
two of which are important for our present con- 
sideration. There is that motor aphasia in which 
the individual is unable to use appropriately the 
muscles of phonation. This is more commonly 
found and is usually given the general name of 
‘“faphasia’’? or aphemia. An equally important 
defect is that in which there is an inability to ex- 
press one’s self in writing. This is called 
agraphia. In sensory aphasia also we find divi- 
sions or distinctions, there being those aphasics     
-P-A-G-E-200
192 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
who take things in through the eye very little 
or with difficulty, and those others who take 
things in through the ear with difficulty. Other 
forms of aphasia and combinations of these, are 
found, but in dealing with re-education we shall 
confine ourselves to the four forms which are the 
most frequent; namely, aphemia, agraphia, visual 
aphasia, and auditory aphasia. 
In dealing with the aphemias it has been advo- 
cated by some experts that the patient should be 
exercised in the formation of the movements 
which are necessary for the production of the 
individual sounds that comprise words and sen- 
tences. The basis for this recommendation does 
not appear to be the analytic study of aphasia, 
but rather the analytic study of language. It 
has been my experience that it is just as easy 
for the patient to start with simple combinations 
of movement which make up the relatively simple 
word sounds, as it is to start with the individual 
vowel sounds, their subsequent combinations with 
the consonantal sounds, and finally to go on to 
the complexes which we speak of as words and 
sentences. The advocacy of the utilization of 
exercises on the simple sounds has been limited 
to the conditions of motor aphasia, but not those 
of sensory aphasia. If the procedure is of great 
value in one type it should also find great use 
in the other. Its usefulnes appears to be mainly 
in the re-education of those in whom the aphasia 
is accompanied by paralyses. It corresponds 
with an analogous procedure in the re-education 
for writing. 
If the patient does not exhibit a paralysis,
-P-A-G-E-201
  SPEECH DEFECTS 193 
and can use hand and arm well, but does show an 
inability to write, numerous exercises can be 
given to produce a return of the writing function. 
Among the first exercises the patient is instructed 
to copy writing or print. This will be done very 
slowly at first, sometimes with gross errors in 
the formation of the individual letters or with 
‘letter omissions. Persistence in the exercise, 
especially when there is the association of the copy 
with those things which have an interest for the 
patient will produce those habit reactions which 
are desired. Later these activities can be devel- 
oped into voluntary writing by combining the 
stimulus of the written copy with auditory stimuli 
of the voice of the instructor repeating the words 
to the pupil. Or if the patient can read either 
silently or aloud he may use this as an addi- 
- tional stimulus for reinforcement of the written or 
printed paper before him. When the subject is 
found to have difficulty in the copying of indi- 
vidual letters special exercises for hand and arm 
movements may be given advantageously. What 
is sometimes lost by these individuals is not the 
grosser activity but finer codrdinated movements, 
or associative movements. The exercises may 
take the form of those penmanship strokes which 
are found in writing exercise books. These may 
be frequently repeated until they can be well per- 
formed, and later they can be used in combina- 
tions. It is advantageous in most cases to have 
the individual make his written copies large. The 
strokes or the letters may be from one to two 
inches high, rather than the one-eighth inch size 
or less which is predominant in normal people. 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  194 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
Special exercises in steadiness, such as those 
which have been used to obtain control in loco- 
motor ataxia or in tremors, are also advantageous 
and may supplement with great benefit those ex- 
ercises which are directed primarily to the writ- 
ing activity. 
The cases of aphemia must be dealt with dif- 
ferently. The individuals who are incapable of 
speaking must be taught to combine the activities 
of the lips and tongue, and other parts of the 
speech apparatus, into codrdinated movements 
which will result in words and sentences. I have 
usually begun by giving these patients either an 
auditory or a visual stimulus or the two in com- 
bination to produce the reaction. The visual 
stimulus may be of several kinds; a printed 
word, a written word, and a picture or an 
object which corresponds with the words. We 
may show the individual the picture of a cat, the 
printed word cat, and simultaneously the word 
cat is written for him. He is then asked to say 
the word or to read it or to name the object in the 
picture. If he is unable to do so, or if he does 
it badly, he is given in addition the auditory 
stimulus of the word cat, and he is urged to make 
the sound which corresponds. 
In many instances the patient is unable to do | 
this immediately from the stimuli which are pre- 
sented to him in this way. The instructor may 
be compelled to add to his procedure other stim- 
uli to bring about the necessary activities. He 
directs the patient to look at his, the instructor’s, 
lips and tongue when the word is being said, and 
then tries to get the patient to form with his own
-P-A-G-E-203
SPEECH DEFECTS 195 
mouth the proper positions for the production 
of the sound. At times also, just as in cases of 
partial paralysis of the tongue, it is necessary to 
manipulate the parts, to take hold of the tongue 
with the fingers, to place it in position and then 
arrange the lips in proper positions to show the 
patient what is to be done. The instructor may 
then urge the patient to hold those positions while 
breathing and make the sound. The use of a 
wooden tongue depressor is frequently of value 
in the placing of the tongue, especially in its 
manipulation beyond the tip. Frequently also 
the tongue depressor or a small piece of wood can 
be inserted between the teeth to show the patient 
how the jaws should be held. If additional pieces 
of thin wood are used for the purpose of placing 
of the tongue the sounds can be produced. This 
is tedious both for the subject and the instructor, 
but its greatest value lies in those cases in which 
there is difficulty in the enunciation of a few 
sounds. 
After the patient has once learned to carry out 
certain of these movements a useful method is 
to require that all of the movements be carried 
out in front of and observed in a mirror. A mag- 
nifying mirror has certain advantages and can 
be used with great benefit to the patient but it 
is not necessary. The instructor should sit oppo- 
site the patient but not more than three feet away 
from him, in order that careful observations may 
be made of the movements made by the patient 
in carrying out the speech function. Each time 
movements are correctly made, the patient should 
be encouraged. Each time incorrect movements 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
are made his attention should be directed to the 
position of the instructor’s lips and tongue to 
compare with those positions of his own lips and 
tongue which he can see in the mirror. 
It is well to keep in mind that those words 
which are of greatest use to the patient are those 
which have the greatest interest for him, and 
therefore the greatest stimulating value. After 
the subject has learned a few words, he should 
be urged to combine the words by the use of con- 
nectives. Speech is not a number of words, but 
a number of words in connections or relations. 
Many words may be learned, many combinations 
of sound may be reacquired without the individual 
acquiring an ability to combine the words into 
larger groups. Many motor aphasics reacquire 
the ability to speak in substantive terms, they can 
unhesitatingly say numerous words which are the 
names of objects, but they lack the ability to con- 
nect them into combinations which are needed in 
ordinary conversation. Connectives, and by 
this we mean conjunctions and certain intransi- 
tive verbs, are reacquired with difficulty. This 
corresponds with what Head has described in 
cases of so-called sensory aphasia in which there 
are defects of recognition of relations. 
In those whom I have re-educated, I have found 
that along with the acquisition of some important 
substantives the patient most readily learns verbs 
relating to actions. These are in a way concrete 
like nouns. Words relating to objects of which 
the patient stands in immediate need as bread 
and butter, shoes and hat, etc., may be readily 
reacquired. Some are apparently difficult. I had
-P-A-G-E-205
  
SPEECH DEFECTS 197 
a patient, for example, who learned many com- 
mon nouns in five days or less but who took twenty 
days to learn ‘‘button.’’ At the some time other 
words dealing with specific activities of the sub- 
ject like ‘‘eat’’ and ‘‘drink,’’ even though they 
are verbs may also be relatively easy to reac- 
quire. Modifying phrases of all kinds, including 
adjectives as well as adverbs, are not easily 
relearned. A few modifying words may be ac- 
quired without difficulty, but as in the case of the 
child they may be more substantive than modi- 
fications. The speech of a re-educated individual 
who has reacquired a certain amount of ability 
may be disjointed, and what has been called 
a-grammatical for a long period of time. The 
speech resembles that of the young child, who 
uses substantives and active verbs quite freely 
but who seldom connects the words that he is 
able to use, and who uses few modifying words 
and phrases. This is similar to the development 
of language in primitive peoples. The most 
primitive language is that in which only verbs of 
action and object words are used. Later develop- 
ments added the connectives, the modifiers and 
the abstract words. The re-educator should not, 
therefore, be discouraged if great difficulty is en- 
countered in attempting to teach a case of 
aphemia certain words. The subject may not 
have reached the stage at which these words have 
much value for him. The emphasis should be 
placed upon those things which are most needed 
by the patient regardless of their conversational 
value. 
It will also be found a matter of much sur-
-P-A-G-E-206
  198 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
prise that frequently a patient will be able to 
acquire the ability to say what appear to us to 
be long and complex words, whereas he may have 
difficulty in saying those words which we consider 
simple and direct. I have found that some pa- 
tients will be able to use long words much before 
they acquire certain ordinary simple words which 
I have tried to teach them. This is not remark- 
ably different from what we find in normal indi- 
viduals. Children and many adults learn to say 
words which are fine combinations of sounds, 
and they may be used without their meanings 
being known, before they acquire other words 
which appear to us to be simple. 
Since the defect in cases of sensory aphasia is 
an inability of sensory association and of recog- 
nition, the procedures to bring about re-educa- 
tion are those which will tend to get the individual 
to associate printed or spoken names with cer- 
tain objects, and names with pictures, the visual 
with the auditory, ete. In this condition we have 
to deal with a deficiency which is similar to that 
in the uneducated child. The principle that is 
applied in the education of children applies here 
equally well. It will be recalled that when the 
child is taught to read he has presented to him 
a picture, let us say that of a horse, with the cor- 
responding printed word. Or the word may be 
written on the blackboard, and it is also given 
verbally by the teacher (auditory stimulus). In 
this education the attempt is made to bring about 
an association between the (visual) printed 
word and the (visual) picture, or between the 
(visual) written word and the (auditory) spoken
-P-A-G-E-207
SPEECH DEFECTS 199 
word. All combinations are frequently repeated 
so that eventually the child learns to associate 
all together, and all with the real object. In addi- 
tion the attempt is made to bring about such 
an association of the printed word with the motor 
activities of the organs of speech, that the printed 
symbols result in certain complex vocal activities. 
This is the method which must be utilized with 
sensory aphasics regardless of their character. 
In general we deal with two types of sensory 
aphasics, the auditory and the visual, although it 
must be appreciated that there is a possibility 
of having an anesthetic or tactile form of aphasia 
which is also sensory. In both classes of aphasia 
of these two main sensory types (auditory and 
visual) the procedures are practically the same. 
If the aphasia is of a visual character and there 
is little defect on the auditory side the approach 
can be made in an auditory way. If the defect 
is largely auditory the approach must be made 
from the visual side. In this work I have used 
simple and complex pictures, shapes, colors, and 
in fact all materials that can be utilized for the 
stimulation of the sense organs on the visual side. 
On the auditory side we are confined in our 
methods since here we have to deal primarily 
with those stimuli which are produced by the vo- 
calization of the instructor. 
Much use may be made of the phonograph, 
with musical and other records. It may also be 
said that rhythm helps, so that poetry, if it is 
simple, is useful in teaching these patients as 
well as for the instruction of the motor aphasics. 
Singing is also of value. Attention has been
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
called to the fact that some motor aphasics can 
sing connected words at times when they are 
unable to carry on a conversation except in sub- 
stantive form. Some sensory aphasics also are 
able to associate words more readily with music 
than when the words are used in conversational 
speech.
-P-A-G-E-209
  CHAPTER XII 
THE PSYCHOTIC. 
Unter the heading psychotic I group for con- 
venience all those individuals whose abnormali- 
ties are sufficiently acute or sufficiently grave to 
make the individuals asocial or antisocial. In 
other words, we include in this group not only 
those persons who are commonly spoken of as 
insane and those others who have frank psychoses 
but also many with the milder manifestations 
of mental abnormality. Some of the latter do 
not act or do not have deficiencies of ac- 
tion which warrant their being legally restrained 
in institutions for their own protection or for 
the protection of the community. Many of these 
lesser asocial and antisocial people go about their 
daily tasks, and partly assume relations to the 
community. Some we speak of as peculiar or 
timorous. We find a few who are over-bold, some 
have phobias, or fears of fire, or of high places, 
or of open or of closed places, or of persons. 
Here we would include all of those commonly 
called neurasthenic or psychasthenic, as well as 
the hysteric. All of the persons of this group are 
differentiated from the other conditions with 
which we have dealt in the last four chapters by 
having the main manifestations mental. We 
must not overlook the fact that in many cases these 
201
-P-A-G-E-210
    202 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
mentally disturbed people may exhibit apparent 
physical disorders which simulate or which re- 
semble those which have already been dealt with. 
The abnormalities which these patients have 
are varied. They range from those disturbances 
of will, or activity, which result in incapacities 
of a motor kind or in hyperactivities, to dis- 
turbances of sensibility, such as hyperasthesias 
and anesthesias. Some show abnormalities of 
emotional condition, which may range from de- 
pression to elation or to indifference, and be spas- 
modie or continual. In every case which we ex- 
amine, we shall note that there is an outward ex- 
pression of a so-called inward state. The condi- 
tion which is called depression leads for example 
to an inactivity on the one hand or to activities 
which are destructive to the life of the individual 
such as attempts at suicide. Numerous external 
stimuli, and also those internally experienced, 
lead to actions which demonstrate that the indi- 
vidual is not normal. Failure to assimilate stim- 
uli, which are spoken of as hypoesthesia or an- 
esthesia may bring about an inactivity which re- 
sembles a disturbance of the so-called will, with 
results somewhat similar to those which are as- 
sociated with an organic paralysis. 
For all of these cases, regardless of the out- 
ward manifestations of the disorder, the general 
principles of treatment already laid down should 
be kept in mind. These principles are that the 
activities of the individual should be so worked 
over or so reconstructed that the individual be- 
becomes capable of behaving like the normal 
people in his environment.
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE PSYCHOTIC 203 
These cases differ from those of the organic 
type principally in that the habits which are evi- 
dent are ineffectual or the patients exhibit per- 
verted modes of reaction. In other words the so- 
cial activities of these patients differ from those of 
the normal people in the environment. This is 
evident to such a degree that they are not only 
noticed and produce comment, but they cause an- 
noyance to those about them. Frequently also 
their actions are harmful to the patients them- 
selves, and to many other individuals in the com- 
munity. These activities must be replaced by 
those habits or actions which are more appropriate 
to the social stimuli, more suitable to the environ- 
ment, and more like those of the other individuals 
in the community. 
Having in mind the general principles and the 
general types of defect which are to be found 
in these eases, there are certain special principles 
which must have their application. None of these 
patients makes a good subject for re-education 
procedures unless we find four conditions met. 
In the first place if the individual does not realize 
that he is different from other people in the com- 
munity, if he does not realize that in certain re- 
spects he is abnormal, it is almost useless to at- 
tempt any kind of re-education. The term in- 
sight is frequently used to designate the capa- 
bility of the individual to recognize his mental 
deficiency or abnormality. It must be understood 
that the quantity of this insight may vary within 
wide limits in individuals. Some realize that ‘‘in 
some way’’ they are different, some realize in 
particular ways that they are different. They
-P-A-G-E-212
  204 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
may recognize the natures of their abnormalities 
and they may be able to define them frequently 
much better than the examiner. Insight may also 
be present in those individuals in whom the recog- 
nition of abnormality comes as a compensation 
for certain of their other deficiencies. Even 
though they recognize in what particular they 
may differ from other individuals, they are fitted 
to retain their individuality in this particular, 
but they are able to make an adaptation. In 
some. cases the insight may be indirect and may 
be part of the mental picture. It may, for ex- 
ample, take the form of the recognition of dif- 
ference, which results in hospital treatment and 
loss of liberty, but which is a social recognition 
of his superiority. 
The second condition which must be met in 
order to bring about a sufficient amount and de- 
gree of re-education in the psychotic is the de- 
sire on the patient’s part to get well. In all 
cases this is not of primary importance although 
in most cases it is important. If the individual 
thinks himself to be a king or another high per- 
sonage, he may lack desire to change his com- 
fortable delusion. He has sufficient insight to 
recognize a difference between himself and the 
others, both patients and attendants, who may be 
about him, but he may lack the desire to become 
different from what he is. Recognizing his own 
superiority he does not want to become like the 
other people. In such a case re-education, no 
matter how long continued or how actively it 
may be carried out, may be futile. It is, however, 
not always essential that the individual desires 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE PSYCHOTIC 205 
to become well, since many procedures may be 
initiated and carried out which will help towards 
the eventual social recovery of the individual. 
The environment may be so constituted or 
changed that there is a growth or a development 
of this desire to become normal even though it 
may not exist in the beginning. 
To these two primary requirements there must 
be added that of self-confidence of the individual: 
confidence in his ability to overcome the condition 
or abnormality with which he suffers and con- 
fidence in the ability of his advisers, his physician 
and instructor, to help him to overcome these con- 
ditions. This also may be a state of mind which 
is not present in the individual at the beginning, 
which may need to be created and fostered by 
many little instances, or stimuli, which are pre- 
sented to him. A deep depression, which the pa- 
tient may have, may prevent his feeling able to 
get well although he may express a desire to this 
end and he may recognize his temporary inability. 
He may also feel that those about him are in- 
capable, but varied means must be used which 
will help to rid him of these feelings. In place 
of the hopelessness efforts must be made to pro- 
duce in him a feeling that something may be ac- 
complished, that there is a possibility of a change 
taking place and that those about him are capable 
of helping him in this particular. 
These three things may be combined and prop- 
erly considered to be of primary importance, but 
even though these three things exist, even though 
he knows he is not well, even though he desires 
to get well, even though he feels that he is able
-P-A-G-E-214
  206 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
about him can help him to overcome them, it is 
essentials as the fourth point that the efforts of 
re-education should be properly directed. They 
should not be hit-or-miss methods, they should 
be directed towards the overcoming of his special 
difficulties. They should be directed to the for- 
mation of those habits of action and of thought 
which are necessary for the normal individual. 
They should be adapted to the patient’s special 
mental condition, to his previous education, and 
to the environment in which he has to live, so 
that he may carry out his life work in the com- 
munity as part of it. 
Not every psychotic case is amenable or suit- 
able for re-education. It is obvious that in pa- 
tients with the organic psychoses, such as general 
paralysis of the insane, the arteriosclerotic and 
the senile dementias in which there are extensive 
alterations of the brain, all of whom may be ex- 
pected to die within a few years, the chances of 
improvement and social recovery by re-education 
procedures are relatively slight. At the same 
time whatever may be accomplished is usually of 
little value to the individual or to the community 
in which he lives. That improvement in mental 
functions or habits may be produced in these or- 
ganic psychoses can be demonstrated by anyone 
who is willing to give sufficient time to the train- 
ing of a patient of this class. HEven the memory 
deficiencies in these organic dementias may be 
partly overcome by systematic training of the na- 
ture of stimulation of the patient, by increasing 
his interest, by causing him to direct his atten- | 
to overcome his difficulty and that the people

  THE PSYCHOTIC 207 
tion to details needed for remembering and by 
compelling him to pay close attention to the vari- 
ous stimuli which come to him. When he attends 
to the stimuli they have more stimulating value. 
Because of this they are retained and they can 
frequently be recalled. Even though the recall 
may not be as good as that of a normal individ- 
ual, it can readily be demonstrated that the recall 
of the stimuli more nearly approaches the normal 
than in his previous condition. 
But, in every case the question which arises 
and which must be answered is whether or not 
the amount of time that has to be expended in 
the re-education is worth while, either for the pa- 
tient or for the instructor. If the expected im- 
provement is not going to be of great value to 
the individual patient, if it is not expected to be 
permanent but only a temporary palliative, or 
only a demonstration of the capability of re-edu- 
cation, it had best not be attempted except as 
a scientific experiment. There may be added to 
this general statement the remark that frequently 
re-education procedures which are applied to 
the individual patient are indirectly of value. In 
some instances this is in relation to the patient’s 
family more than to the patient himself. The pa- 
tient may be taken as an object of re-education 
when the actual object is not to re-educate him, 
but to re-educate the family. In other words, it 
is often of value to change the mental attitude 
of the members of the patient’s family to bring 
about in them more normal reactions than they 
have. Under these conditions the re-education 
procedures with an apparently hopeless case may
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
have considerable value, but it should be at- 
tempted only with full knowledge of what is to 
be accomplished. It may not. be necessary, and 
it is frequently inadvisable to tell the family that 
re-education is for them, but the instructor must 
know and appreciate what he is doing. 
In dealing with the psychotic, much more tact, 
patience, kindliness, forbearance, and all of the 
other characteristics of humility are required 
than in dealing with the organic cases. To bring 
about a proper attitude in the organic cases, 
whether central or peripheral paralysis or 
aphasia, it may be frequently necessary to repri- 
mand him, to tell him how badly he is doing, that 
he is not doing himself justice, ete. With the 
psychotic this is not frequently needed and it 
nearly always leads to a negative reaction which 
will defeat the ends of the instructor. In special 
cases great tact is needed. The individual who 
is depressed must be dealt with quite differently 
from one who is excited. The patient who is 
paranoid whether he be depresed or egotistic or 
exalted, must be humored. Each must be dealt 
with individually, in accordance with his mood 
and in accordance with the conditions of his dis- 
ease and those of the moment. 
An instance of how not to begin with the re- 
education of a patient may well be illustrated. 
This will also illustrate forcibly what has been 
done with many psychotics, who get firmly fixed 
in their disability and who become antagonistic 
to all efforts at improvement. I was requested 
by a physician to see a patient who had been 
diagnosed to have a speech defect of the nature
-P-A-G-E-217
THE PSYCHOTIC 209 
of an aphasia. The aphasic condition was re- 
ported to be due to a gun-shot wound in the neck 
which was supposed in some way to have pro- 
duced a loss of the ability of articulation because 
of severance of some nerves. The patient also ex- 
hibited an inability to write which was also sup- 
posed to be due to an interference with some parts 
of the spinal cord or with some elements in the 
brachial plexus. The symptoms that were ap- 
parent to the examiner were the inability to speak 
or write. These were the facts which were pre- 
sented to me prior to my seeing the patient. 
After having detailed to me the conditions which 
were supposed to be the underlying causes of 
the patient’s defects, and the efforts which had 
been made toward his re-education, the patient 
was brought in and was seated near me. After 
greeting him, I asked the patient his name. His 
lips moved, but the physician who was present 
immediately interrupted with the remark: ‘‘Mr. 
cannot talk.’’ I insisted however that the 
patient had begun to talk to me and that he 
should be permitted to continue without inter- 
ference. I assumed and acted upon the assump- 
tion that he could talk, and I found that he could 
talk. Although his voice appeared weak, some- 
what tremulous, he verbally gave me his name 
and subsequently a few details regarding his life. 
He exhibited no evidences of inability to carry 
on an ordinary conversation and I assumed at 
all times that he was capable of doing this. A 
pencil and paper were then provided which I 
handed to the patient, placing the pencil in his 
right hand with the request that he write his name,  
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
his age, the date, his home address, and the place 
where he then was. Before he could begin this 
task the physician again advised me, sharply and 
in tones distinctly audible to the patient, that the 
latter could not write with his right hand. He also 
took the pencil from that hand and placed it in 
the left which he said was being re-educated to 
take up the writing functions. Without com- 
ment I took the pencil from the patient’s left 
hand and placed it in the right hand, and ordered 
him to write, which he showed he was capable 
of doing. In this instance the well meaning ef- 
forts of the physician were tactless. They were 
based upon an erroneous diagnosis. Hven had 
the diagnosis been correct it is certain that his 
method would not be an encouragement to the pat- 
ient to put forth any effort. His conversation had 
the tendency to overcome the effects of suggestion 
which my presence and my words gave to the pa- 
tient. It had the result of reducing the good at- 
titude which was produced in the patient by hav- 
ing been told that one experienced in re-educa- 
tion of speech defects was coming to see him and 
advise regarding the best means to be used to- 
wards his recovery. From a more careful examin- 
ation it was apparent that the patient was obvi- 
ously psychoneurotic, there was great danger 
that his speechlessness (which was erroneously 
called aphasia) and his inability to write (which 
also was erroneously called agraphia) would have 
been exaggerated or fixed by what the physician 
said at the time of the interview. It is likely that 
the negative suggestions to the patient were 
broken through, to some extent at least, and made 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  
  THE PSYCHOTIC 211 
of little avail by the exaggerated reputation which 
was previously given he. 
Improper handling of psychotic cases is not in- 
frequent. The thick application of sympathy may, 
on the one hand, exaggerate the condition, while 
on the other hand rough handling and lack of 
appreciation of his difficulties cause him to shut 
his shell, so that he cannot be reached. With 
many psychotics the approach must be made 
through his confidence, trust, hope, and expecta- 
tion. And much can be gained by the insistance 
and assurance of the re-educator. In these cases 
there is little to keep in mind beyond that of deal- 
ing with the patient as if he were normal. It is 
possible to demand from him what might be de- 
manded as if he was normal. Many things he 
may be expected to do as a matter of course. If 
dealt with in this manner there is a tendency 
to break down or to replace certain ideas which 
in individual cases bring about unusual reactions. 
Suggestion in all its forms plays a large réle in 
most of the re-education procedures. It may be 
direct, as an encouragement, or it may be indi- 
rect. The suggestion may also come from the 
subject and this is called auto-suggestion. The 
encouragements and assurances that the instruc- 
tor gives frequently lead to auto-suggestions in 
addition to having value as external suggestion. 
And, many other procedures, those of examina- 
tion for example, act to bring about conditions 
of auto-suggestions also. There are some who 
affirm its paramount importance in the therapeutic 
measures of psychoanalysis. Whether one calls 
this ‘‘positive transfer,’’ as does the psychoana-  
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
lyst, or suggestion, or something else makes little 
difference for the patient and the terminology is 
of less importance than the helpful production 
of a hopeful attitude on his part. 
It is, however, well to recognize that the essen- 
tial thing is that the patient shall have confidence 
in the instructor. If a patient who has been 
worked with for a few days has shown during 
this time a lack of confidence in or an aversion 
for the instructor, it is often best for the instruc- 
tor to advise the patient to seek the help of some- 
one else. The instructor may not be able to help 
materially such a patient. His time and efforts 
may better be expended on those patients who 
trust him, confide in him, recognize him as a 
friend and desire his help, and think that he may 
be beneficial. Patients who are antagonistic, or 
who in psychoanalytic terms have a negative 
transfer, are to their own advantage as well as to 
the advantage of the instructor referred to some- 
one else. Occasionally, especially in institutional 
work, this is not always possible. It has some- 
times been found that even where there is a lack 
of confidence in the instructor or physician the 
patient may be persuaded or even compelled to 
do certain things which in themselves may result 
in an improvement. The carrying out of some 
activities under compulsion, just as the adminis- 
tration of drugs under like circumstances, may 
bring about an improvement. Both the pro- 
cedures and the resulting improvement may be 
resented. At a subsequent time, however, they 
help to change the patient’s point of view, so that 
he then becomes confident and willing, and some-
-P-A-G-E-221
Te EN EE EC Te a ey 
THE PSYCHOTIC 213 
times even anxious that more active measures 
be instituted. 
As in all other kinds of cases which require re- 
education the psychotic must have a careful ex- 
amination of his mental state, his accomplish- 
ments, his interests, his plans, and his goal. It 
is not sufficient to know that the patient shows 
depression. In the psychotic it is important to 
know not only that the patient has a phobia or 
has a delusion or is elated. It is necessary that 
the whole mental status of the patient be known 
as far as it can be discovered. At times this 
necessitates intimate disclosures and confessional 
confidences, to the detailing by the patient of 
many shame-provoking occurrences in his past 
life. Many things may be told he has not told to 
others. He opens his mind in the way of a con- 
fession and frees himself from many peculiar 
ideas. By itself this catharsis may sometimes re- 
sult in apparent complete recovery of the indi- 
vidual. He rids himself of those things which 
are burdens to him—many ‘‘old men of the sea’’— 
who have been riding him. I am well aware that 
this has been disputed, and that there are those 
who hold that the ‘‘censor’’ and what he does 
must be understood and that a thorough psy- 
choanalysis must be carried out in these cases if 
the abnormality is to disappear permanently. 
This is not, however, the place in which to dis- 
cuss the relative values of catharsis and complete 
psychoanalysis, or the importances of mental 
explanations. Nor is it necessary to discuss the 
relative values of suggestion, catharsis, psycho- 
analysis, rest, diet, and the other factors that are
-P-A-G-E-222
214 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
usually present in all ‘‘mental’’ treatments. It 
is sufficient to know that with some people ex- 
tensive psychoanalytic measures need not be car- 
ried out and that they cannot be carried out suc- 
cessfully. The length of time needed for the treat- 
ment of individual cases makes it a ‘‘selective’’ 
measure, just as in some bodily abnormalities the 
surgical and medical methods may be selective. 
It is also important to know that the cathartic ac- 
tion of the detailing of symptoms and of the cir- 
cumstances attendant upon the production of 
these symptoms is sometimes sufficient to place 
the individual back into his usual social life. 
The therapeutic approach to the psychotic in- 
dividual must be preéminently a mental approach. 
Numerous other measures are available, both as 
accessory and as primary. Delirium may accom- 
pany high fever, or be the result of alcohol or 
hashish or some toxin in the system. Treatment 
by mental measures in these patients is less ef- 
ficacious than treatment for the elimination of 
the toxin for the rehabilitation of the person. 
The methods which are available are numerous; 
the physical methods of hydrotherapy, electro- 
therapy and kinesotherapy may be used. It is 
well recognized that hydrotherapy in the form 
of baths, packs, douches, ete, has value in 
stimulating or in calming. In conjunction with 
chemotherapy it may help to eliminate certain 
toxins from the body. Together the use of baths 
and drugs may get the individual into a better 
mental state so that he can more readily be dealt 
with by one of the methods of psychotherapy. 
Electrotherapy, perhaps largely through its sug- 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
THE PSYCHOTIC 215 
gestion value, may also be useful. It should be 
recognized, however, that many patients have 
peculiar ideas regarding electricity and electrical 
forces. Only a careful mental examination will 
point out these patients, and if special fears or 
delusions regarding electricity are present the 
use of this means is usually contra-indicated. In 
all mental cases it must be used with care so that 
delusions or fears do not take their origin from 
the treatment. In those cases in which it is em- 
ployed it is apparently more valuable in its more 
spectacular forms, the violet ray, the high fre- 
quency currents, and those induced currents of 
higher voltage which cause considerable skin 
pain. The last form of electrotherapy has been 
found extremely useful in dealing with the 
physical accompaniments of hysteria, such as the 
paralyses, tics, and anethesias. Yealland has 
been able to produce apparently miraculous re- 
sults by its use. The qualification should be made 
to the last statement that in all probability in all 
cases the effect has been solely that of suggestion. 
It is not the direct effect of the electric spark on 
a paralyzed muscle that is of importance but it 
is the mental effect produced on the paralyzed 
mind. Yealland, it should be remarked, did not 
utilize this method until the patient repeatedly 
demanded that something should be done for him 
and that he be cured as Yealland had cured many 
others. Only the patient with confidence was 
treated, and when he was treated, the doses were 
not the minimal ones, and the treatment was con- 
tinued until the symptoms had disappeared. In 
the application of the electric current, therefore,
-P-A-G-E-224
  216 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
the greatest effect is to be obtained because of the 
patient’s confidence in the efficacy of the opera- 
tion, confidence that the therapeutist will be able 
to accomplish almost the impossible. There is 
also required that the instructor shall have con- 
fidence that he will be able to do for the patient 
what the patient needs to have done. 
Movement therapy, or kinesotherapy is also of 
value in getting the individual started on the road 
towards taking up some sort of occupation of so- 
cial value. Misdirected efforts in excitement may 
be altered into efforts which are produced at com- 
mand, as in gymnastics. Slow, incompetent 
movements of the individual who is partially 
abulic or who is much depressed and retarded 
may also give away to movements which are more 
rapid and forceful and purposeful. In many in- 
stances class exercises are of value. The indi- 
vidual patient sees other individuals carrying 
out certain activities. He imitates their actions 
as one of the group. Imitation is nothing but 
the acceptance of another’s activities as sugges- 
tion to action. Association in groups may, there- 
fore, be of value in that what has been called a 
habit of inactivity may be replaced by one of ac- 
tion similar to the activities of a group of which 
he becomes a member. 
Occupation therapy is also useful. Whether 
this is carried out in the form of basket weaving 
or mat making, the making of toys or raffia work, 
the effort is made solely to get the patient active 
in directions which are more like those of the nor- 
mal individual. In themselves such activities 
as mat making may not be of great value to the

patient. They can be of great value to him in 
leading him up to other occupations which are 
normal for his position in the social world, more 
normal in that they are like those to which he 
was accustomed and which are needed by him 
if he is later to be discharged and make his liv- 
ing. Occupation therapy is not, therefore, an 
end in itself. It is a means to an end. It is use- 
ful as the introduction to more usual occupations. 
It is useful in the production of the habits of di- 
rective activity and industry, in the patient. It 
should introduce and lead directly into occupa- 
tions which are more generally remunerative. It 
should help to direct the subject into occupations 
of a professional or of a trade character. 
Occupations which have been called ‘‘bedside’’ 
have values which are largely mental. In them- 
selves they are of relatively little future use. 
Basket making and weaving of belts, the coloring 
of pieces of wood for toys, should be taken as the 
beginnings of more serious work: embroidery or 
sewing, housework or gardening, carpentry or 
plumbing, printing or book binding, and the like. 
The bedside occupations may be used to direct 
destructive tendencies of an individual into those 
which are constructive, or to get the diffuse ac- 
tivities concentrated. In so far as occupation 
  therapy will lead to the return of the individual — 
to the occupation which he had prior to the psy- 
chotie development, or to another occupation bet-— 
ter suited to his mental level and his mental pecu- 
liarities, can occupation therapy be of value. 
If bedside occupations are not needed by the pa- 
tient, if his condition is such that he can be given
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE PSYCHOTIC 219 
a saw, a hammer and nails, and the wood, from 
which he can make a chair or table, without the 
preliminaries of weaving or bead work, he is that 
much farther on and has gained that much time 
towards his eventual rehabilitation. The end of 
the re-education of the psychotic is to return him 
to his family and to the community as a working 
member. At times it is necessary that his occu- 
pation should be changed. It may be necessary 
that the stock-broker should be introduced to 
many new occupations, to see their possibilities 
and his possible adaptation to them, in order that 
he may give up his former occupation, and learn 
to carry on a business of a less nerve-racking 
character. It may be that he will find comfort 
and health as a specialized farmer, or as a small 
town banker. Or he may become an accountant 
or become keeper of an inn, something other than 
that which he formerly was. In other cases it 
may be that the loneliness of farm life must be 
replaced by another occupation in a small town 
or in a large city. These replacement occupa- 
tions must be learned and the learning of them is 
part of the re-education of the individual. They 
are in reality the more important part of occupa- 
tional therapy, because it is the occupation which 
will enable the individual to live, and to live so 
that the psychotic conditions are not again pro- 
duced. 
The untidy and destructive are difficult to re- 
educate. At first sight they seem impossible of 
re-education or scarcely worth the efforts at re- 
education. If re-education is thought to be pos- 
sible, it is also thought to take more time than
-P-A-G-E-228
    220 NERVOUS AND MENTAL RE-EDUCATION 
that which can be given to them. This belief is 
not borne out by the facts. What is required in 
these cases is that the strength of the stimulus 
(or situation) shall be sufficient to hold the atten- 
tion, and lead to another reaction than that of 
being filthy or untidy or of tearing the clothing, 
or fighting with other patients. It is a good plan 
to permit these individuals to associate for part 
of the day with others who are working, to see 
what they are doing, to play with gaudy beads 
and cloth, and to attempt to create the interest 
in the accomplishment of something. When in- 
terest has been created the more formal re-educa- 
tion of the individual may be begun. 
Some patients can be appealed to to help out 
others, to act as assistants, or as crutches for 
their companions who are less capable than 
they. The spirit of help, the knowledge that 
something is being accomplished will soon lead 
to a recognition of the individual’s own useful- 
ness. The assistance to others will serve to show 
the individual that he is capable of doing some- 
thing, and this will tend to rid him of self-depre- 
ciation, and will also create a proper attitude re- 
garding himself. 
The treatment of the psychotic is, therefore, in 
many respects different from the treatment of the 
organic groups in that its object is not to deal with 
muscular activities and motor codrdinations of 
muscle groups. Its object is to deal with the 
social activities of the individual. In these cases 
we deal with those conditions which are the ends 
to be sought in the re-education of the organic 
cases. But in the organic cases, the emphasis must 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  THE PSYCHOTIC 221 
be placed on the neuro-muscular coérdinations. 
And, in the psychotic, where the neuro-muscular 
coérdinations are largely intact, we deal with the 
utilization of them in social complexes. It is some- 
times necessary that the grouping and activities 
of muscles shall be developed in the psychotic. 
More frequently we are concerned solely with the 
production of social activities, with re-education 
exclusively in the sense of getting the individual 
back into his proper and adequate social status. 
This means fitting him into an occupation, getting 
him to modify his views of life’s values, teaching 
him how to get on with his family or to live apart 
from them, letting him find a goal in life and turn- 
ing him in the direction of that goal.

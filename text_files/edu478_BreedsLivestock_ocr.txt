PREFACE 
THE original material of which this book is composed 
was prepared for the Cyclopedia of American Agricul- 
ture, Volume III, by men who have been more or less 
eminently identified with the respective breeds of which 
they write. Since successful breeders are essentially 
specialists in their particular breeds, the most authori- 
tative presentation of the historic facts, points of merit 
and economic importance of these breeds should be 
expected from those breeders who have devoted them- 
selves most exclusively to them. 
This subject-matter has been revised, rearranged, am- 
plified and brought up to date with the view of making 
a book that shall serve as a hand-book for the breeder 
and a text-book for the student. The revision has been 
made by Dr. Carl W. Gay, Professor of Animal In- 
dustry in the University of Pennsylvania, a teacher 
and investigator of wide experience and an author of 
high standing. The revisions of the different parts 
have been approved by the original authors, so far as 
living; and the book therefore has double authority, 
the advantage of statements made by persons who are 
identified with the different breeds, and a comparable 
treatment throughout. Only the descriptive parts of 
the original articles have been utilized in making this

book; for the completer accounts and for the score- 
cards, the reader is referred to the Cyclopedia, which 
was published in 1908. Score-cards of the breeds will 
also be found in Gay’s “Principles and Practice of 
Judging Live-Stock,” Rural Text-Book Series.

THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
INTRODUCTION 
THE STUDY OF THE BREEDS 
IN this era of improved live-stock husbandry it is more 
the exception than the rule to find horses, cattle, sheep, 
hogs and even chickens that do not show the distinguish- 
ing characters of some breed predominating their physical 
makeup. The true mongrel of nondescript breeding is 
in the minority. How has this come about? Does 
it reflect, in exact measure, the success of the breed 
associations and others in their efforts to promote the 
interests of their respective breeds, or a general sentimen- 
tal preference for the pure-bred sire? Neither — it is an 
economic problem. The most convincing basis upon 
which to argue is one of dollars and cents and the grade 
has demonstrated itself to be a better business proposi- 
tion than the mongrel. It is more reasonable to suppose 
that a cow, for example, which has inherited from her 
sire, if not from her dam also, the cumulative high pro- 
duction that has been sought through a long line of an- 
cestors, will be more productive than one whose incentive 
to give milk is merely incident to maternity. 
With a variety of breeds, each endowed with greater 
proficiency for some special performance or production, 
the grade has become the only animal worth feeding. 
Competition in the marketing of products, high-priced

2 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
feed and labor increasing the cost of production and ren- 
dering more imperative the economic efficiency of the 
animal machine itself, affords the strongest argument in 
favor of the high grade animal. 
The breeding of pure-bred live-stock is. too often re- 
garded as beyond the concern of the average breeder. 
While he may not be equipped to engage in it himself he 
must be an indirect patron of the pure-bred stud, herd or 
flock if he is to succeed in his business of marketing animals 
or their products. Furthermore, the high grade animal 
embodies to such a great extent the characteristics of the 
breed from which it is derived as to make the study of 
the breeds of as much importance to the breeder of grades 
as to the breeder of pure-breds. 
Cross-breeding is legitimately practiced to some extent, 
but skillful use of the blood of the breeds crossed requires 
intimate knowledge of their inherent possibilities. Failure 
to reckon with these invisible hereditary forces may result 
in some of the most unexpected occurrences with which 
all cross-breeding is more or less fraught. 
Study of the breeds should be undertaken, however, 
with the proper motive and from the correct point of view. 
Each breed has its advocates and it is well that this is so, 
but it is not advisable to “ vote on principle ” in breeds 
as is done in politics. A blindly partisan allegiance to 
any breed may lead a breeder wide of the mark that he 
is striving to attain. An intelligent choice of a breed 
, involves first, recognition of the conditions to be met, 
such as markets, facilities with which to cater to their 
demands, the existence of community sentiment and 
reputation, and finally personal fancy; second, knowledge 
of the special adaptability of the respective breed to meet 
the conditions imposed.  
-P-A-G-E-25
THE STUDY OF THE BREEDS 3 
The distinctive characters of each breed are the result 
of definite factors operating during the formative period | 
of the breed. The chief of these are the origin, which 
determines their hereditary bent; the environment, in- 
cluding the location, topography, nature of the soil and 
vegetation; and the ideals to which the breeders have 
selected, governed, of course, by the type of farming or 
industry in which they are engaged. Any one exclu- 
sively, two or all may be chiefly responsible for the types 
that prevail im the different breeds. d 
The study of the breeds is most comprehensively con- 
ducted, therefore, under the following headings: Intro- 
ductory statement; history, both ancient and modern, 
the latter dealing with the breeds in this country especially, 
in the case of foreign breeds; a description of the typical 
representative; the uses to which his breed characteristics 
best adapt him; his distribution throughout the world 
as the result of his adaptability and usefulness; the or- 
ganizations which promote the interests of the breed and 
record the pedigrees; and finally, the best sources of 
additional information concerning each breed. 
Breeds of live-stock, unlike many of the poultry breeds, 
for instance, have been builded on a utility basis and 
they can, therefore, be grouped according to the types 
to which their representatives conform. Types, it should 
be understood, are market or producer’s creations, dif- 
ferentiated on the principle that a distinct form is corre- 
lated with a definite function. 
All members of a group possess the type characters 
in common, while the features by which the members of 
the type group may be distinguished constitute the breed 
characters.

THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 
ALL individuals representing the following breeds 
should possess primarily the low station, wide, deep, 
compact, massive and big-boned form typical of the 
drafter. Sharp contrast should be made between these 
features, which are common to all the breeds in this 
group, and the distinctive features or marks possessed by 
each breed in particular and by means of which they are 
differentiated.

1. The Percheron breed of draft horses is native of 
the ancient province of La Perche, a territory about 
one hundred miles square, in the north-central part of 
France. This region lies in the heart of a fertile farming 
country. The land is high and rolling, the soil is fertile 
and the farms are watered by numerous springs and small 
streams. These springs and brooks give rise to some 
eight or ten rivers flowing into the English Channel on 
the north and the Atlantic Ocean on the west. The numer- 
ous valleys are rich and they produce sweet, nutritious 
grasses and bountiful crops of grain. The climate is 
mild, yet sufficiently tonic and invigorating to produce 
horses of good temperament. The land is held mainly

'8 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
by tenant farmers who are frugal and thrifty, and good 
tillers of the soil. The natural conditions of this region 
all combine to make a most favorable environment for 
this widely known and popular breed. Among the breeds 
of draft horses that have been imported to America from 
France, the Percheron leads both in numbers and in 
popularity. 
2. History in France. — France has long been noted 
for good horses. The horses of France, like those of other 
countries, were first improved for the purpose of war. 
The Flemish blood was largely drawn on in early times 
and importations of oriental blood were made at a very 
early date. This blood was infused with the native horse 
stock of France, which may have been Flemish in its 
origin. The oriental blood imparted a degree of refine- 
ment and finish that has ever since characterized the 
modern draft-horse stock of France. 
Since 732, when the French defeated the Saracens and 
captured their horses, infusions of Arabian blood have 
been made, and the subsequent use of Arabian stallions 
on the native mares continued as late as 1820. In this 
way, a foundation was laid for a breed of horses possessing 
activity, quality and strength. The extension of rail- 
roads, reducing the use of the omnibus, seems to have di- 
verted the breed towards a heavier type. This led to the 
use of Flemish stallions. The conditions of La Perche be- 
ing favorable for the growth of strong, active horses, the 
breed started in this way made very rapid progress. There 
are some features of French management that may have 
had an influence also in directing the development of the 
breed. It is a common practice to work the stallions, 
and this may have been a factor of some effect on their 
dispositions, making them more amenable to work.
-P-A-G-E-31
    THE DRAFS BREEDS OF HORSES § 
It should be said that the French government recognizes 
several breeds of draft horses, but the Percheron and the 
Boulonnais are apparently the only two that may be 
considered pure, as they have stud-books separate from 
the others. In addition, there are the Breton, Nivernais 
and Ardennais, all of which may be recorded in the General 
Draft Stud-book of France. [These breeds are discussed 
on pages 18—20.] : 
In addition to controlling the matter of registration, 
the French government has a system of inspection, which 
in some degree assists its horse-breeding interests. The 
veterinary inspection, however, is limited to periodic 
ophthalmia or moon blindness and roaring or thick wind. 
Johnstone (The Horse Book) states that there are only 
two maladies for possession of which approval, authoriza- 
tion or certification is refused in France — periodic 
ophthalmia and thick wind. This being so, the branding 
system carried out by the French government does not 
carry so much weight as is commonly supposed, for inspec- 
tion apparently only discriminates against these two 
diseases, and there is nothing in the law to prevent any 
breeder using such unsound stallions on his own mares. 
The author referred to states further, that when a stallion 
is pronounced free from the unsoundnesses named, he is 
branded on the neck under the mane with a five-pointed 
star. The colt must be over thirty months of age before 
he can stand for public service, and the certificate of 
freedom from these diseases covers only one year. If 
the colt fails to pass inspection for these diseases, or if 
the diseases develop after the inspection, then the letter 
“RR,” meaning refused, is branded over the five-pointed 
star. These are the only brands used by the French 
government. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  10 THE BREEDS OF LIV E-STOCK 
The French Percheron Society, however, uses a brand 
that is put on all stallions and mares recorded in its 
stud-book. It is a monogram of the letters S. and P., 
the initials of the society. It is branded on the neck under 
the mane. ‘ 
After successfully passing the inspection, the horses 
are classified in three grades. The first are known as 
“ subsidized ” or “ approved,” and to such a cash bonus 
is awarded to keep them in France on the owner’s farm, 
and available to outside mares. The other two are 
“authorized ” and “ éertified,” neither of which carries 
with it any subsidy. 
3. Historyin America.—The first importation to America 
was made in 1839, by Edward Harris, of Moorestown, New 
Jersey. The next importation was made in 1851, by 
Fullington and Martin of Milford Centre, Ohio. This 
importation was of far-reaching importance, although it 
consisted of but a single horse named “ Louis Napoleon.” 
This horse was sold and taken to Illinois in 1856, 
where he afterward passed into the hands of Mr. Dillon, 
of Normal, Illinois. ‘Louis Napoleon” stood fifteen 
and one-half hands high and weighed about sixteen hun- 
' dred pounds. He was, perhaps, the most. noted horse 
of the breed that has been brought to America. It is 
estimated that he sired over four hundred colts that were 
used successfully for stud purposes. In 1851 and suc- 
ceeding years, other importations were made which helped 
to lay the foundation of the breed in America. In 1870, 
M. W. Dunham, of Wayne, Illinois, took up the importa- 
tion, since which time he and his family have imported and 
bred Percherons very extensively. Through his efforts the 
breed has gained much popularity in America. Many other 
importers might be mentioned, but the list is now a long
-P-A-G-E-33
THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES a 
one, as the importations of horses of this breed have 
been very extensive.(The Percheron breed has made 
rapid progress in popularity in this country. It is the 
most numerous and the most generally popular of any 
breed of draft horses in America. This is accounted 
for chiefly by the degree to which the Percheron is adapted 
for the work on most of our farms, .as well as to produce 
an active draft horse for the market. ’ 
4. Description of Percherons. — Nearly a century ago 
the aim of the breeders of horses in La Perche was to 
produce a medium-weight draft horse, suited in type and 
action for pulling a “diligence” or omnibus. At an 
early day, the demand existed in France for a horse that 
could haul a load at as rapid a rate as possible. At this 
time, the breed was represented by horses of upstanding 
type, somewhat rangy but strongly built, with attractive 
and unusual action for draft horses. They were then 
gray in color, and these were the first to be brought to 
America. While not so drafty in type as the modern 
Percheron, they were horses of superb style, full of vigor, 
and they had powerful action which enabled them to 
pull strongly and move quickly at the same time. In 
themselves, the gray Percherons of early days were 
unusual draft horses, and it was the degree to which they 
combined activity with pulling power that made the 
Percheron a very popular horse for farm work. But the 
demand in America became more insistent for a heavier, 
blockier, shorter-legged type, that would grade the prod- 
uce of our lighter mares to a draft weight quicker. 
This demand resulted in the modern black Percheron 
of somewhat stouter build, deeper body, more weight, and 
as much quality as the prototype; but there was some 
sacrifice of style, standing or going, with somewhat less
-P-A-G-E-34
12 ‘ THE BREEDS OF LIV E-STOCK 
attractive action. The modern Percheron approaches 
more closely the essentials of a draft horse to meet modern 
A markets, but the old type had some qualities, such as 
style, endurance and activity, which were difficult to 
retain in a shorter and stouter built horse of more 
weight. 
(phe present-day Percheron’s excellencies are to be seen 
in the active temperament, intelligent head, deep body, 
wide muscular croup and clean-cut legs of the typical 
representative. The joints are usually clean and hard, 
and the legs invariably show an abundance of quality 
that guarantees durability; but frequently the set of the 
legs and, particularly, the shape of the hind-quarters, 
is at fault.) A croup too sloping, with deficiency in muscle 
below, cannot give the greatest pulling power, especially 
when associated, as it often is, with legs that are improp- 
erly set, being either too straight, sickle-hocked or other- 
wise cramped in the hind-quarters. The Percheron is 
rarely deficient in quality and activity, and when the 
weight is sufficient to meet the demands of the modern 
draft-horse market, a draft horse of unusual excellencies: 
is the result. The action of the Percheron is almost always 
quick enough for a draft horse, and the feet are generally 
picked up with snap at the walk; but these should not 
be allowed to overshadow desirable mechanical action, 
which is straight and distance-covering, although less 
showy and attractive. 
In size, the Percheron ranges from fifteen and one- 
fourth to sixteen and one-half hands, and from 1500 to 
over 2000 pounds in weight. There are a number of 
medium size, although the largest take rank with the 
largest of any of the draft breeds. In France there is a 
type smaller in size than the medium. These are popu-
-P-A-G-E-35
THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 13 
lar for general traffic and for bus and tram use in cities. 
The demand in the United States is for the larger types. 
5. Uses of Percherons.— The Percheron has little 
use except as a draft horse and as a producer of grade 
draft horses. The usefulness of this breed for draft 
purposes is so well known that it is unnecessary to dwell 
on that feature. But it is well to call attention to the 
fact that a large proportion of our draft teams contain 
Percheron blood, and that the results which follow a 
cross of a pure-bred Percheron stallion on a mare of other 
draft breeds, or even on the heavier types of our common 
mares, are most excellent. 
6. Distribution. — The Percheron breed has proved 
generally popular in nearly all parts of the United States, 
particularly in the farming regions where draft horses 
are raised for market, It is well adapted to farm condi- 
tions and meets with favor on the markets. Plumb 
(Types and Breeds of Farm Animals) quotes Weld as 
authority for the statement that in 1866 there were fully 
5000 Percherons in this country. Illinois has been the 
chief center for the breed, with the adjoining states of 
Ohio, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin following with 
lesser numbers. The same author states that between 
1851 and 1883 nearly 4000 Percherons were imported 
or bred in the United States, and these were distributed 
about as follows: Illinois, 1834; Ohio, Indiana and 
Michigan, 577; Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota, 424; 
New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, 280; Missouri, 
Kansas and Nebraska, 186. These figures are an index 
of the relative extensiveness of the Percheron breeding 
interests to-day, although it is likely the western states 
carry more compared with the others than they did at 
that early time. The southern states have become an
-P-A-G-E-36
eg er EE ees 
14 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
altogether new field for the Percheron, although not many 
of the breed have been brought into the South or into 
Canada, where the British breeds seem to be in more 
favor. Wilcox (Farm Animals) has stated that there 
are 30,000 registered Percheron horses in the United 
States, which is a larger number than any other draft breed. 
7. Organizations and records. —In France, the inter- 
ests of this breed are in the hands of Société Hippique 
Percheronne. It was organized in 1883, and in that 
year published its first stud-book. The Percheron Society 
of America has published sixteen volumes of the Percheron 
Stud-book of America, the first two volumes, however, hav- 
ing been published by the Percheron-Norman Horse 
Association. One hundred and eight thousand regis- 
trations have been made. The Percheron Registry Com- 
pany has published three stud-books. 
There have been many dissensions among the importers 
and breeders of French draft horses, leading to the forma- 
tion of several societies and stud-books. It becomes 
_necessary to discuss these, not because of any desire to 
state which were right or which were wrong, but solely 
for the purpose of explaining the status of the societies 
and stud-books at present representing the breed. 
The first importations of draft horses from France to 
America were almost universally called Normans. There 
was no apparent reason for the name, for none of them 
came from Normandy. This name at that time was 
intended to embrace all the breeds of draft horses in 
France. Those importers bringing horses from La 
Perche considered the horses from that district the typical 
draft horses of France. The French government had 
not at that time established the Percheron stud-book (its 
publication was begun in 1883), consequently there was
-P-A-G-E-37
OE GOMER ASSET EO ee OG 
THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 15 
    
more room for thé discussion of the claim at that time than 
there is now. fn 1876, when the importers of the French 
draft breedsorganized and issued the first stud-book under 
the editorship of J. H. Sanders, a compromise was effected 
by the adoption of the title Percheron-Norman Stud- 
book. Some of the members withdrew, forming another 
association, which published the National Register of 
Norman Horses, and this was afterwards changed to the 
National Register of French Draft Horses. In this stud- 
book are registered all importations that are registered 
in the General Draft Stud-book of France. The Percheron- 
Norman Stud-book was changed to the Percheron Stud- 
book, and it is based on the Percheron Stud-bogk of France 
which, since 1885, has accepted for entryfonly horses 
whose ancestors are registered in the book y As the pres- 
ent stud-books stand, only pure-bred Pererons may be 
recorded in the’ Percheron Stud-book, while in the Register 
of French Draft Horses all the draft breeds of France, 
including Percherons, may be admitted. From this 
unfortunate diversity of stud-books, the Percheron Stud- 
book had reached the point of being recognized as the 
distinct representative of the Percheron breed, when 
jnternal dissension arose over the powers vested in the 
secretary. The outcome was a division into three asso- 
ciations that published stud-books. The American Per- 
cheron Horse Breeders’ and Importers’ Association was 
organized in 1902, but in 1905 this name was changed to 
the Percheron Society of America, with headquarters 
at the Union Stock Yards, Chicago. Also in 1904, the 
Percheron Registry Company was organized with head- 
quarters at Columbus, Ohio. In 1905, the American 
Breeders’ and Importers’ Percheron Registry was or- 
ganized, with headquarters at Plainfield, Ohio.

16 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
About March 1, 1911 the Percheron Society of America 
took over all the books, records and business rights of the 
Percheron Registry Company, issuing to each of the 
206 members of the Percheron Registry Company one 
share of stock in the Percheron Society of America. The 
Percheron Society also recognized as registered horses 
the animals recorded by the Percheron Registry Com- 
pany. The produce of animals with Percheron Registry 
certificates are not accepted for record, however, until 
the certificates for such animals are renumbered, rewritten 
and placed in shape for republication. This ‘rule involves 
only those Percheron stallions bred to pure-bred mares. 
Practically all of the animals that were recorded in the 
Percheron Registry Company that had any produce have 
already been renumbered in the Percheron Society and 
most of their pedigrees have been rewritten. The present 
Percheron Society of America has more than 6700 mem- 
bers and paid in capital stock in excess of $70,000.

8. The northern part of France has been particularly 
fertile in the production of high-class horses of various 
types. This has been due in part to the character of 
the soil and climate and to the food on which they \ 
have been fed, and in part also to the taste and tem- 
perament of the people in this section. In addition to 
the Percheron and Demi-sang Normand, or French Coach 
horse, there have been developed in this region several

THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES LY 
distinctive types or breeds ranging in characteristics from 
coach horses to the heaviest type of drafters. 
These have been introduced into America simply as 
French draft horses. This has led to some confusion in the 
names, as there is no single French draft breed, but rather 
several distinct breeds or types of French draft horses. 
The French draft horse best known in America is the Per- 
cheron (see pages 7-16). Others less well known are 
the Boulonnais, Ardennais, Breton and Nivernais, which 
are here given brief treatment. The Picardy draft horse 
has been said to be a variety or type of the Boulonnais. 
By some writers it is held to be a Belgian breed. 
9. Boulonnais (Fig. 1).—The Boulonnais breed origi- 
nated in the Boulogne district in northeastern France ad- 
joining Belgium. In 
common with the 
other draft breeds of 
France, the Boulon- 
nais horses without 
doubt had their origin 
in the heavy Flemish 
horses. In their gen- 
eral characteristics 
they very much re- 
semble the Percheron, 
so much so that it is 
impossible i in the best 
specimens to distinguish one from the other. In recent 
years more animals of gray color are to be found among 
the Boulonnais than among the Percherons, and there " 
has probably been less change and improvement in type 
in the Boulonnais breed than in the Percherons. They * 
are not so large as the Percherons, and somewhat less 
c

18 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
refined, on the whole. The breed has an excellent repu- 
tation in its native country, where an association has 
been formed and a stud-book kept in the interest of the 
breed. It has been imported in large numbers to America 
and has more largely than any other breed made up what 
is known as the French draft breed. 
The head of the Boulonnais is of good size, being broad 
in the forehead and with a larger eye than the Percheron, 
and somewhat more clean-cut about the lower part of the 
head. The neck is medium in length and clean-cut. The 
shoulders are laid well into the body and well-muscled. 
The body is compact and deep-ribbed, with short and 
broad back and well-muscled loins. The croup is in- 
clined to be short and with a low-set tail. The hind- 
quarters are muscular and broad with well-filled thighs. 
The legs and feet are free from superfluous hair and are 
possessed of excellent quality. Many Americans favor 
the feet of the Boulonnais in preference to those of any 
of the other French breeds. On the whole, the feet are 
larger, more rounded and the pasterns have more slope 
than the Percherons’. The colors are dapple gray, dark 
iron-gray, black, brown and occasionally chestnut. , 
This breed is growing in popularity in America, and its 
interests, together with other French draft breeds, are 
represented in the National French Draft Association 
of, America, which publishes a stud-book. This Asso- 
ciation was first organized as the National Norman Horse 
Association in 1876, but its title was changed to the one 
that it now bears in 1885. The Association thus far 
has published nine stud-books. The present headquarters 
of the Association are at Denver, Colorado. 
10. Ardennais.— This draft breed or stock is a 
native of Ardennais, adjoining the Belgian frontier in
-P-A-G-E-41
   THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 19 
northeastern France, and resembles very much in type 
and characteristics the Belgian draft horse. It is a very 
blocky, compact breed of great usefulness for producing 
heavy farm “chunks,” and one type is used largely as 
heavy draft horses. Individuals of this breed scarcely 
equal in size the Belgians, but are of the same general 
stamp. The heads are strong, with small eyes and ears, 
short, thick necks, heavy shoulders and short, thick and 
compact bodies. The legs are short, of fairly good quality, 
although the feet are high and narrow. The color of the 
Ardennais is more frequently chestnut and roan than 
anything else, although bay and brown are sometimes 
found. Gray is not common and is not looked on with 
favor. When imported into this country, horses of this 
breed are eligible for registration in the stud-book of the 
National French Draft Horse Association of America. 
11. Breton (Fig. 2):—This breed of light draft or 
general-purpose horses belongs to Brittany, in the western 
part of France in a 
section of country that 
is much broken in sur- 
face. 
In general, these 
horses have intelligent’ 
heads, clean-cut necks 
of medium length, 
beautiful, round, well- 
muscled bodies with 
short backs and rather 
longer and_ straighter 
croups than the other 
French breeds, and with more quality in the legs and 
feet, the latter being large and more rounded in form

than the Percheron or the Boulonnais. In color they 
are dapple-gray, with very few exceptions. 
Brittany has been prominent in horse-breeding for 
many years, although the animals bred are rather of 
a miscellaneous type. The Breton horses are exceed- 
ingly useful and of much the same general character as 
the old-style Percherons, but are smaller and more refined 
in type. Many of the Percheron stallions have been 
taken into this district in recent years in an effort to 
improve the breed in size and character. It is stated 
by some historians that English races have been intro- 
duced into this section, which possibly accounts for the 
more luxuriant growth of hair about the legs. Repre- 
sentatives of this type of horses are used very largely 
in France as omnibus horses in the cities. They have 
not been imported to this country to any great extent, 
probably owing to their lack of size and weight. 
Representatives of this breed may be registered in the 
stud-book of the National French Draft Horse Association 
of America. 
12. Nivernais.— The Nivernais is a breed of draft 
horses of French origin. The horses are of large size, with 
good length of neck, well-formed bodies of good length, 
massive shoulders and hind-quarters, and very strong 
bone, giving the legs a rather round appearance. They 
are uniformly black in color. Seldom, if ever, is a gray, 
brown or chestnut to be found. 
This breed of horses has been developed in the Depart- 
ment of Nivernais, or Niévre, in central France, and is 
one of the largest of the French draft horses. Its interests 
have not been very carefully looked after, and the choice 
specimens of the breed are not very numerous. It is 
only within the past nine or ten years that an associa- 
’
-P-A-G-E-43
THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 21 
tion has been formed in France for the keeping of records 
in the form of a stud-book. It is thought by Americans 
who have investigated the matter that the transformation 
in color and size in the Percheron horses in the past ten 
or fifteen years has been brought about, to some extent 
at least, by the use of the best types of Nivernais stallions 
from this district, crossed on the mares of the La Perche 
district. 
Individuals of this breed have been imported to America 
in increasing numbers in recent years; it is classed as one 
of the French draft breeds. Individuals of this breed may 
be recorded in the stud-book of the National French Draft 
Horse Association of America on the same basis as are 
the horses of the Boulonnais breed.

14. History in Belgium. — In the early history of the 
Belgian breed of draft horses, no particular animals appear 
to have been prominent nor has any breeder of outstand- 
ing merit appeared. This breed, unlike most other 
draft breeds that have been developed, has been almost 
entirely the product of its environment. The small 
country of Belgium has a reputation as the home of draft 
horses extending back through several centuries. Many, 
if not all, of the draft breeds of Great Britain and France 
were greatly improved during their formative period by 
the use of the heavy Flemish horses, the early progenitors 
of the Belgians. Modern horse-breeding in Belgium, how- 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  22 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
ever, is of comparatively recent development. A revival 
of the interest in it was stimulated and developed with 
the establishment of government breeding studs in 1850. 
The Belgium government annually sets apart about 
$75,000 for the supervision and encouragement of draft- 
horse breeding in that 
country. By a system 
of prizes, and financial 
encouragement of indi- 
vidual breeders, as well 
as of the National 
Draft Horse Society of 
Belgium and the local 
fairs, it has had a very 
potent influence in the 
advancement of this 
breed. By every means, 
the government seeks to encourage the best efforts of in- 
dividuals, and to discourage the exportation of desirable 
animals. The city of Antwerp, in Belgium, is noted 
throughout the world as possessing many of the finest 
specimens of draft horses to be found, and these horses 
are without exception of the Belgian breed. 
15. History in America. — The history of this breed 
in America is comparatively brief. The earliest importa- 
tion was probably in 1886, when a few horses were im- 
ported into Illinois by A. G. Van Hoorebeke. They 
were at that time incorrectly termed “ Boulonnais.” 
Since 1887, large numbers of Belgian draft stallions have 
been imported into the United States and have been found 
exceedingly valuable for crossing on native grade draft 
mares. In 1888, E. Lefebure began importing and pro- 
moting the interest of the breed in this country. One Bee

-P-A-G-E-45
THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 23 
of the first firms to import these horses was D. P. Stubbs 
& Sons, of Fairfield, Iowa. Since 1897, there has been 
a large and constantly increasing demand for stallions 
of this breed. The leading importers have been A. B. 
Holbart and Lefebure & Sons, of Iowa; J. Crouch & Son, 
of Indiana; McLaughlin Bros., of Columbus, Ohio; 
Dunham & Fletcher, of Illinois, and H. A. Briggs, of 
Wisconsin. Very few mares were imported into this 
country at first for reasons that are not well understood. 
This was due partly to the fact that there was not the 
demand for the Belgian breed to encourage importing 
and breeding, as the trade was better satisfied with the 
Percheron and some of the English draft breeds; and 
partly because of the very high prices asked for Belgian 
mares abroad. 
16. Description. — The Belgian draft horse is one of the 
most compact in form of any draft breed representatives 
found in America, possessing a maximum of weight with 
very short body set on short legs. He is broad, massive and 
well proportioned, as a rule. In quality the Belgian is 
somewhat lacking, the legs appearing round and rather 
coarse. The tendons of the legs are thick and not well de- 
fined. The skin is sometimes fine, although the hair is 
occasionally rather coarse and inclined to curl. The head 
is of good size, the nostrils are large and the eyes small and 
not very prominent. The ears are small, set wide apart 
and generally are not well carried. The neck is short, very 
thick and well crested. The shoulders are a little too up- 
right, but strong and heavily muscled. The chest is deep 
and wide, giving a very large girth. The ribs are long, well 
sprung, and closely ribbed up to the hip, giving a better 
barrel than is found in any other breed of draft horses. 
The back is short, very broad and inclined to sag some-
-P-A-G-E-46
CC ee i eae 
24 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
what more than is desired. The loins are wide, short and 
very thick. The flank is low and full. The hind-quarters 
are inclined to be short, very wide and muscular, and the 
tail is attached somewhat low and not well carried. The 
lower thighs are usually very. wide and well muscled. 
The hocks are round, not clearly defined and too “ meaty.” 
One of the serious faults the American horsemen have 
found with this breed is in the character of the bone of 
the legs, particularly with the hock joints. The feet 
also receive rather severe criticism, as the hoofs are in- 
clined to be small, narrow and very high in the heels, 
predisposing to side-bones and contracted feet. Marked 
improvement in these respects has been noted of late,’ 
however. In action, the Belgians are inclined to stumble 
at the walk, but trot off freely and with apparent vim and 
spirit: In color, the chestnut and roan are most common, 
although brown and bay are frequently found. The grays 
are not in favor, although occasionally one is seen. 
In Belgium, these draft horses are classified somewhat 
according to the sections of the country in which they 
have been bred. Those from Flanders are the largest ' 
and those from Ardennais district’ the smallest, while 
those from Brabant are of medium size and weight. : 
17. Uses of the Belgian horse. — These horses are 
bred entirely for draft purposes, and they rank well 
among the heavy breeds, especially in Europe. The 
short, stocky legs, and low-set, blocky body make them 
very useful for slow, heavy hauling over city streets. 
Belgian draft horses are especially adapted for crossing 
on grade draft mares lacking in weight and substance, for 
the production of heavy draft horses. When crossed on 
grade Percheron or Clydesdale mares, they impart an 
increased depth of body with a comparative shortening

_of the legs, and a general massiveness of form not easily 
secured by the use of any other breed of draft stallions. 
18. Distribution. — The Belgian breed of horses had no 
wide distribution outside of its native home, until within 
the past seventeen years, since which time it has been in 
general demand on the continent, as it is particularly de- 
sirable for use in the heaviest kind of work in large cities. 
Numbers have been imported into Germany, France, 
Holland, Sweden, Austria, and other European countries, 
the Argentine Republic, and other South American coun- 
tries, and to the United States, where they have found 
rather extensive favor, particularly in the central states. 
19. Organizations and records. — The National Draft 
Horse Society of Belgium (Le Cheval de Trait Belge) was 
founded in 1886, and the American Association of Im- 
porters and Breeders of Belgian Draft Horses in 1887. 
The former association has issued a number of stud-books, 
and is very aggressive in the interest of the breed. It 
receives national financial support. For twenty years 
the latter association did very little to encourage the 
breed, which accounts, in part, for the little interest 
taken in these horses in America until within recent 
years. It is now more active. The first stud-book was 
issued in 1905, since which time five more volumes have 
been published.

26 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
21. Origin. — The Clydesdale originated in the low- 
lands of Scotland, with the county of Lanark as the chief 
center of activity in producing the breed. It is fre- 
quently referred to as the Clydesdale district, and is 
divided throughout its length by the Clyde River. While 
the lowlands of Scotland have long been noted for the 
heavy horses bred there, yet it was not until the latter 
part of the eighteenth century that the breed was much 
improved by the importation of some heavy stallions 
from Flanders. John Paterson, of Lochlyoch, is said to 
have imported the first Flemish stallion for this purpose 
early in the eighteenth century. The Flemish stallions 
were large-boned and heavy horses of sluggish tempera- 
ment, with slow, awkward action. The lowlands of Scot- 
land are very favorable for the breeding of heavy horses, 
as the soil is fertile-and the pasturage luxuriant; and 
these, with a suitable climate, have a marked effect on 
the characteristics of the modern Clydesdale, as they are 
favorable for growth of bone and muscle, giving both 
height and substance. 
22. History of breeding. — The Clydesdale of to-day 
is the result of careful and persistent breeding for definite 
ends. The results of the breeders’ efforts in a general 
way may be summed up by stating that they have ulti- 
mately been very successful in combining weight, quality 
and action as the prime essentials of a draft horse. These, 
successfully united, produce a draft horse that has pulling 
power, wearing quality or endurance, in association with 
ability to move properly at a satisfactory pace, either 
walking or trotting. The evolution of this breed of draft 
horses is more than usually interesting because of the 
decided views of the home breeders and the singleness of 
purpose which they have shown. The progress has been
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 27 
secured through concentration on one feature after an- 
other, until it produced the desired results. Without 
government direction or aid to secure uniformity of 
progress, it is safe to say that the Scottish breeders have 
accomplished as marked improvement in their draft 
horses as the breeders of any other nation, and the modern 
Clydesdale of accepted type possesses inherited char- 
acteristics so fixed by consistent breeding that they are 
likely to be passed on to succeeding generations. Archi- 
bald MacNeilage, secretary of the Clydesdale Horse 
Society of Scotland, in a review (Famous Clydesdale 
Sires, Transactions of Highland and Agricultural Society, 
Vol. IX, 1897) of the most noted Clydesdale sires from 
Champion to MacGregor 1487, shows the evolution of a 
type from a coarse prototype, which the author describes 
as being a horse of weight with plenty of strength of bone, 
but not at all “ right at the ground ” in the modern sense, 
nor as “sweet ” in his limbs as horses are liked now. 
For a century the Clydesdale breeders in Scotland 
worked without results that were striking on the surface, 
but when this cycle had passed, the evolution of such sires 
as Prince of Wales (673) and Darnley (222) had crowned 
their efforts. The former is credited with possessing 
style and action in an unusual degree, and these qualities 
were very desirable to graft on to the breed at that time. 
But with the production of Darnley (222), a sire possess- 
ing the true balance of qualities which mark the service- 
able draft horse, with the power to reproduce these, the 
Clydesdale breed received an impetus that effectively 
disarmed the old-time criticism of “light middles.” 
From the Prince of Wales line has come Prince of Albion 
(6178), said to be the highest-priced two-year-old draft 
horse ever sold, up to this time, he bringing £3000. He 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
NER Sea TSE Te ON. ree ee ee eee ene ee TR Vie mee aN ees 
  28 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
was, in turn, the sire of the two-year-old filly, Queen of the 
Roses, with a similar record, she bringing £1000. Also, 
from the Prince of Wales came Cedric (1087), exported to 
Scotland from the stud of Col. Robert Holloway, Alexis, 
Illinois, one of the leading importers of Clydesdales in 
America. From the Darnley line have come MacGregor 
(1487), McQueen (3513), Baron’s Pride (9122) (Fig. 4) 
and his son Baron o’ Buchlyvie, the highest priced stallion 
of any breed ($47,500 at auction) and sire of Bonnie Buch- 
lyvie, sold for $25,000, the second highest price on record ; 
and in such as these the Clydesdale breeders secured that 
combination of substance, quality and action, with right 
set of legs, for which they had striven long and assidu- 
ously. Beginning with a prototype coarse and weighty, 
it was refined without loss of substance; and then by 
concentrating their attention successively on style, 
action, set of legs, slope of pasterns, through years of 
criticism and discussion, the Clydesdale of to-day emerges 
with the desired characteristics very pronounced. 
23. Purpose in the breeding.—JIn their adherence 
to quality, meaning thereby texture of bone, cleanness 
of joints and fineness of skin and coat and feather, the 
Scotch breeders made no mistake in so improving the 
breed at an early day, for it has not only added to 
the appearance of the individuals, to free them from the 
charge of grossness of joints and coarseness of bone, but 
it has also added materially to their durability under 
the strain of steady service. Fineness of feather and 
sloping pasterns seemed fine fancy points to the unin- 
itiated, but a steady demand for them improved the 
quality of the Clydesdale at a rapid rate. The breeders 
previous to this had concentrated on action with a zeal 
that has hardly been equaled by the breeders of any -
-P-A-G-E-53
   THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 29 
other breed of horses. The demand became insistent 
for action in show and breeding stock, and the result is 
that, in the possession of this feature, judged from a purely 
mechanical standpoint, the breed has made marvelous 
progress. The action required had to be straight, regu- 
lar and free, both at the walk and at the trot, with a free 
flexion of the knee, a springiness to the pastern and a 
straight and close passage of the hocks. In the effort 
to secure these improvements, the Scotch breeders were 
very ably supported by the American breeders, although 
the latter did not feel like going so far in the securing of 
quality as the home breeders. It is very likely that the 
latter felt misgivings on the point, for there is no doubt 
but that the slight infusion of Shire blood, which was made 
into the Clydesdale, chiefly through the use of Prince of 
Wales (673), is, to some degree, evidence that they wished 
to regain some substance and weight, which, for the time 
being, had been sacrificed to a degree for quality. 
The Clydesdale breeders ultimately secured what 
they had striven for, even though little attention has 
been paid to the American dislike for splashes of white 
on legs or body. In this connection it may be given as 
a general principle that while it is well to bear in mind 
the peculiar requirements of any trade, yet it is well to 
be careful in the matter of humoring any fad as to color 
or any other fancy point, when it clashes in any way with 
real essentials. Having secured the latter, then the 
question of markings and color may properly be allowed 
to enter as a substantial factor. Another feature is that 
the history of the live-stock trade in this country indi- 
cates that to cater to a color, especially of a fad, has its 
dangers. The preference for red among Shorthorn ad- 
mirers carried to the point of a prejudice against the roan,
-P-A-G-E-54
80 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
has reacted, although not until the breed had suffered as 
a consequence. The Percheron breeders submerged the 
old gray Percheron and gave preference to the more 
modern black in answer to American preference, and 
now that the demand of the draft-horse market in this 
country is said to place a premium on grays, the breeders 
will have to swing back if American preference is to be 
recognized. Uniformity of color and attractive markings 
are admitted by every one to be desired, and the Clydes- 
dale is the sufferer for bizarre markings. 
24. History in America.— The first importations 
were made into Canada in 1842, when Archibald Ward 
of Markham, Ontario, Een ree Clyde, 78; three 
years later, R. Johnson, of Scarborough, Ontario, im- 
ported Sovereign, 181. Other importations were made 
into Canada in 1850-51-54. About twenty years later 
Clydesdales were imported to the United States, both 
directly from Scotland and from Canada as well. The 
largest importations were made after 1880, and in the 
following twelve years many thousands of both sexes were 
brought to America. They are now widely distributed, 
and generally known and used. 
25. Description. — Clydesdales (Fig. 4) have a kind, 
quiet disposition, good courage, and enough spirit. A 
weight of 1700 to 2000 pounds for stallions and 1500 to 
1800 pounds for mares, with an average height of 16% 
hands for the former and 16 hands for the latter, may be 
regarded as the standard for mature, well-developed indi- 
viduals of this breed. The characteristics of the modern 
Clydesdale, in reference to color, vary somewhat, the most 
prevalent being bay, brown, black or occasionally chest- 
nut, with white markings on the forehead or face and 
below the knees and hocks. They vary more in charac-
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES, “31 
teristic markings than most of the other draft breeds, 
but in uniformity of type there is a striking similarity 
among the best. The head is almost invariably intelli- 
gent. The shoulder is exceptionally good, which gives 
a free, easy, long stride. It is somewhat oblique, accom- 
panied by high withers. The arm is usually well mus- 
cled, and the bone clean and flat. The feather (hair on 
the legs) in horses of the best quality springs from the 
edge of the cannon, 
and is fine, silky 
and long. It is not 
considered of much 
importance in itself, 
but is valued for 
what it indicates. 
The assertion is 
made that a proper 
feather protects the 
coronet and back 
part of the pastern 
from filth and mud Fig. 4.— Clydesdale stallion, Baron’s Pride, 
2 leading sire of the breed. 
  and, consequently, is 
preventative of scratches. It has often been objected to 
in America. At any rate, the feather, when fine, indi- 
cates that the other tissues, the bone and skin, are also 
of fine texture. Conversely, when the feather-is wiry and 
coarse and curly in this region, it surely denotes a leg 
predisposed to grease or scratches. The pastern and feet 
have been vastly improved in this breed in recent years, 
owing to the demand for more slope and length in the 
former and larger hoof heads in the latter. The same is 
true to a degree in regard to the coupling, which at one 
time was considered the weakness of the breed, attribut- 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
82 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
able to the lack of depth in the shorter ribs. Increasing 
the depth of body and adding to the length of the hinder 
ribs have been effective in lessening the prevalence of this 
criticism. The croup of the Clydesdale is muscular, and 
the quarters are specially well developed. The set of the’ 
hocks is one of the strong points of the breed. A properly 
set hock forecasts pulling power, and it also implies free- 
dom from curbs and from coarseness, due to thoroughpin 
or bog spavins. With the web of the hock free from any 
filling, the latter works freer and stronger, and is not, 
predisposed to diseases; and such a hock is almost 
invariably properly set, for it will frequently be noticed, 
that it is the bent hock that is more ‘‘ meaty” and 
subject to bog spavins and thoroughpins. Properly set 
hocks, above all other things, insure the hock action which 
is so greatly sought in Clydesdales. To bring the hocks 
well under the body and not to spread too much in passing 
each other are very desirable attributes, and these are 
eminently characteristic of the Clydesdale’s hind action. 
The front action in best form is free, snappy and folding 
at the knee, chiefly attributable to a shoulder of correct 
slope, and springy yet strong pasterns. 
26. Uses of Clydesdales. — The Clydesdale is essen- 
tially a draft horse, bred for that purpose alone. His 
free, straight, rapid gait, and strong, heavy frame, give 
him high rank among draft breeds. 
Good types of pure-bred Clydesdales on native draft 
mares have given grades with considerable snap and 
power, well adapted for medium draft work in the city 
and on the farm. 
The secretary of the American Clydesdale Associa- 
tion has reported the sale of four draft geldings, largely 
of Clydesdale breeding, on the Union Stock Yards market

, (27. Distribution. — 
The adaptability of 
the Clydesdale has led 
to a wider distribution 
of it than of any of 
the other draft breeds. 
It has found favor in 
the leading English- 
speaking countries, 
including, in addition 
to the United States, 
Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Argentina has 
imported many of the best, while several of the European 
nations, notably Germany, Sweden and Russia, have been 
most active in making importations. It has also found 
its way into South Africa. On this continent, the breed 
has been most popular in Canada, and the good effects 
of the use of this breed in grading up farm mares to pro- 
duce drafters serviceable on the farm and marketable on 
the best markets, may be seen on almost any Canadian 
farm, while on the streets of the large Canadian cities, 
such as Toronto, Hamilton and Winnipeg, the teams 
attached to the lorries, showing in their characteristics 
Clydesdale breeding, will compare favorably with others.

after the interest of this breed in America, and nearly 
19,000 registrations have been entered. The Scotch 
Clydesdale Horse Society was organized in 1878. Each 
‘of these associations issues a stud-book, the American 
Association having published eighteen volumes. The 
headquarters of the American Association are in the

29. The Shire horse is recognized as one of the leading 
breeds of draft horses. The best type is specially adapted 
for breeding the heaviest class of draft horses, suited for 
slow work, when weight and strength are prime essentials. 
For hauling large loads on lorries through crowded city 
streets, without jerking but steadily progressing, weight 
and strength are the main factors, and it is because of the 
possession of these qualities that the Shire maintains its 
position as a draft horse. A medium-weight horse may 
succeed in pulling more than one of heavier weight if 
permitted to rush at it; but to start a load steadily 
and keep it moving slowly, repeating this frequently, 
as is done on crowded streets, weight must supplement 
strength. Herein lies the reason for the popularity of 
the Shire for drayage purposes in England, where it 
originated. 
80. History in Great Britain. — The Shire is considered 
to be descended from the old war horse of Great Britain 
and has been referred to as the War horse and the Great
-P-A-G-E-59
     THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 35 
horse in Great Britain. It is reported of Cesar, that 
when he invaded Great Britain, 55 B.c., he was impressed 
with the excellence of the horses that were attached to 
the war chariots of the Britons. The breed attained its 
greatest development in the lowlands of England, in 
Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire especially. Other near- 
by counties contributed more or less to the development 
of the breed. In early times, heavy active horses were in 
greatest demand for war purposes, and this led to the 
importation of heavy horses from Flanders and Normandy. 
Large importations of the heavy Black horses of Flan- 
ders were made as early as the eleventh century, and in 
succeeding years during the reigns of King John, Edward 
II and Henry VIII. One of the early improvers of the 
Shire was Robert Bakewell, who introduced blood of 
imported Holland mares in his breeding efforts. The 
development of the breed received much impetus in 1878, 
when the English Cart Horse Society was formed. The 
name of the society was due to the fact that the Shire 
was known primarily as a cart horse. 
The history of the Shire shows a slow but persistent 
development of an improved type through a great space 
of time. The improvement of action and quality have 
received most attention from the breeders, and the results, 
as shown in a modern Shire, have been marked. 
31. History in America. — The progress of the Shire in 
America has been substantial but yet not so rapid as 
might be expected, considering the decided merits of 
the breed. This, in a measure, has resulted from the 
dislike of the American trade for hairy-legged horses 
deficient in quality. It seems that hairy legs are more or 
less characteristic of all heavy breeds of horses reared 
in low countries, and they have been a breed character-  
-P-A-G-E-60
36 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
istic of the Shire since its inception. At a very early 
time the hair was very abundant, and the writer has seen 
some of the old-time Shires with even the lock of hair 
growing from the region of the knee in front, and other 
locks growing from near the point of the hock. Coarse- 
ness and unusual profusion of hair indicate too much 
grossness of organization, although a fine feather finishes 
a heavy-bodied horse at the ground in a way that is 
usually pleasing to the eye. The first Shires to come to 
America showed these characteristics to an extreme 
degree, and the prejudice of the American trade has not 
in any degree abated with time. The first importation 
to reach America was in 1836, and was made to London, 
Ontario, Canada. The first Shires to come to the United 
States were imported in 1853, and taken to Aurora, IIli- 
nois. The importations since then have been mostly 
into the states of Illinois and Iowa, and at no time have 
been numerous, except, perhaps, between 1880 and 1890. 
82. Description. — In general characters, this breed is 
very like the Clydesdale, being, perhaps, a little shorter in 
the legs, and slightly larger (Fig. 6). The common colors 
are bay, brown or black, with white markings on the face 
and on the legs below the knees and hocks. Other colors 
are found but are not common. In conformation, the 
Shire is generally low, broad and stout, being heavy in 
build and slow in movement. The shoulder is likely to 
be too straight, making the action in front short and 
stilted, although it is generally considered that more 
power in the collar compensates for the deficiency in 
action. The body of the typical Shire is of large girth, 
deep and strongly coupled, with broad back. The quar- 
ters are heavily muscled in the best type. Owing to their 
weight, it is to be expected that some of them are subject
-P-A-G-E-61
THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 37 
to the criticism of being deficient in quality and too slug- 
gish in temperament. In general, they may be considered 
to be of heavier weight than the Clydesdale, although 
the difference is not likely to be great between represen- 
tative animals, as the following weights and measure- 
ments of two prize- 
winners will indicate: 
Vulcan (4145), a Shire 
stallion that was 
champion at the 
London Shire Show, 
in 1889 and 1891, 
when eight years old 
weighed 2240 pounds 
in show condition; 
height, 17 hands; 
girth, 8 feet 7 inches; 
around fore-arm, 2 
feet 7 inches; around

inches. Flashwood Z

stallion that was first 
at the Glasgow Spring Stallion Show, in the same years 
and months that Vulcan was first-prize stallion at the 
London show, and at the same age (eight years), weighed 
2240 pounds; height, 17 hands; girth, 8 feet; around 
fore-arm, 20 inches; around bone below knee, 11 inches; 
above hock, 213 inches; and below hock, 123 inches. In 
the best types the legs are strong, bone flat with a 
“feather ” of fine hair on the rear of the cannons, below 
the knees and hocks. The feet are large and somewhat 
flatter at the heel than is desired.

33. Uses of Shires. — Like the Clydesdale, the ‘Shire 
is a heavy draft horse, slow-moving but sure and steady, 
and makes no claims for other uses, except for crossing 
on native draft stock and for improving other breeds 
with an injection of its blood. : 
The use of the Shire has been an important factor in 
improving our horse stock for draft purposes, as attested 
by the extent to which the best drafters of our modern 
markets have Shire blood on the maternal side. The 
Shire is credited with having produced the highest-priced 
gelding that has been sold by auction on the Chicago 
market, and many more of the best have traced to Shire 
blood on the side of their dams. Dr. Alexander is author- 
ity for the statement that a grade Shire gelding, weighing 
2210 pounds, sold for $660 on the Chicago market in 
1904, which is the highest price paid on that market that 
has been reported. Our breeding stock have surely not 
suffered because of the use of Shire blood, and there is a 
feeling that if the Shire had been more liberally used our 
breeding mares would more surely produce the highest- 
selling class of drafters. It remains to be said that the 
use of the Shire in draft-breeding to such a limited extent 
may be due in a measure to the fact that the source of 
supply for importation is not so large as that of some other 
continental breeds; and furthermore, it is difficult to in- 
duce home-breeders to part with their very best types, so 
much desired in their native land for breeding purposes. 
34. Distribution. — This breed enjoys much popu- 
larity in England, as indicated by its prominence in horse 
shows. From there it has spread into most other English- 
speaking countries. Germany, Australia and Argentina 
have made importations. In America, it is most popu- 
lar in the north-central states,

35. Organizations and records. — The first organiza- 
tion to care for the interests of this breed in England was 
the English Cart Horse Society, organized in 1878. 
Six years later it changed its name to the Shire Horse 
Society. It undertook the publication of a stud-book. 
The American Shire Horse Association, with headquarters 
at Wenona, Illinois, was established in 1885. It has 
published nine volumes registering 15,800 Shires.

36. This breed of draft horses, sometimes called 
“Suffolk Punch”, has not become so widely known 
as other European breeds, such as the Clydesdale or 
Percheron. It cannot be said to be as popular as 
either of these two breeds, yet it has many ardent 
admirers. It is bred in greatest numbers in_ its 
native district of Suffolk county, in the eastern part of 
England. It gets its name from the county and from the 
round, full-made type of body that characterizes the 
breed. 
87. History in Great Britain. — The Suffolk can trace 
its history back to the dawning of the eighteenth century, 
and as early as 1851 it carried off most of the prizes for 
draft horses at the Royal Agricultural Society Show, at 
Windsor. At that time it had a distinct lead over other 
British draft breeds, but it seemed to be content with 
home popularity. Volume 1 of the Suffolk Stud-book 
   
-P-A-G-E-64
40 ' THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
is an exceptionally elaborate and interesting compilation 
of the early history of the breed and should be consulted. 
Mention should be made here, however, of the so-called 
“foundation ”’ horse of the breed —the Crisp horse, 
foaled in 1768, and owned by a man of that name residing 
in Sussex. His blood has been carefully preserved, and 
only horses that are traceable to him are eligible for regis- 
tration in the Suffolk Stud-book. Outside blood was 
introduced in an effort to improve the Suffolk, but it bad 
little effect. Docility, prolificacy and length of life char- 
acterize this breed. These horses have been much im- 
proved in the last thirty years. 
38. History in America. — Although it was first im- 
ported to the United States in 1880, by Powell Brothers, 
of Pennsylvania, yet the progress of the breed does not 
seem to be at all commensurate with its merit. The 
importations have been very slow and very small. In 
1888, Peter Hopley & Co., of Iowa, and Galbraith Brothers, 
of Wisconsin, made importations, and these parties have 
since been the leading exponents of the breed in this 
country. A large importation is reported as having been 
made in 1903. Some other importations have been made 
since, to Virginia and Texas. 
39. Description. — The Suffolk is about sixteen and 
one-half hands high, and weighs about two thousand 
pounds (Figs. 7, 8). The color is exceptionally uniform, 
and it is generally some shade of chestnut. Breeders have 
long adhered closely to a chestnut color. In general type, 
it is a low-set, short-legged, deep-bodied, muscular horse, 
with clean bone and durable feet. The feet were once 
1 Inasmuch as chestnut has been demonstrated to be a recessive 
Mendelian character, the uniformly chestnut color of the Suffolk is 
otherwise accounted for than by the prepotency of the original Crisp horse. 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
THE DRAFT BREEDS OF HORSES 41 
much criticized because of their flatness and brittleness, 
but have undergone great improvement in these respects. 
The head is clean-cut, with small ear, full forehead, and 
a more or less Roman nose. The neck is full, with a very 
strong crest, as a rule, in stallions. Too much thickness 
in the throat-latch sometimes results from undue coarse- 
ness of the neck, The shoulder shows good length and 
is of true draft form, not being too oblique. The chest 
is deep, wide and 
molded with muscle. 
The body or barrel, 
one of the leading 
points of merit in this 
breed, is deep, round- 
ribbed, and_ specially 
well let down in the 
hind flank. This un- 
doubtedly contributes 
to the strength of the 
assertion that the Suf- 
folk is an easy keeper, and of unusual endurance. The 
legs, devoid of long hair, are clean-cut, ¢ordy and well ° 
muscled at the arms and thighs. The degree to which 
the Suffolk is muscled in the hind-quarters, and especially 
in the lower thighs, is one of the special features of the 
breed. Pulling contests at an early time were common 
among the adherents of the breed, and it is said that the 
ultimate outcome of these has been to develop the muscles 
of the thigh and the quarter much beyond what is com- 
monly observed in the representatives of the draft breeds. 
The seeming lightness of limb, compared with the depth 
and weight of body, and fullness of neck, has, in many 
cases, given the Suffolk an appearance of being greatly 
   
-P-A-G-E-66

42 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
lacking in the proper proportion of such parts. It is a 
free mover, and this, with its somewhat lighter weight, 
easy keeping and docile disposition, peculiarly adapts it 
for farm work, express-wagon work and drayage purposes, 
where a certain amount of weight may be sacrificed for 
activity and durability. Individually and, to a remark- 
able degree, collectively, the Suffolk is a superior model 
of the draft horse. 
40. Uses of the Suffolk. — The Suffolk ranks/well)as a 
medium draft horse because of its free action and endur- 
ance.. As an agricul- 
tural horse and as an 
express-wagon _ horse, 
the Suffolk grade is 
superior, while those 
individuals that meet 
the requirements as 
to weight can hardly 
be improved for the 
f heavier draft purposes. 
3 =SAQ The popularity of 
Fic. 8.— Suffolk mare. the Suffolk in this 
country has been held 
in check by the fact that it does not make so heavy a 
cross on the lighter native mares as the weightier repre- 
sentatives of the other draft breeds. Against this is the 
counter claim that it is very desirable for crossing on range 
mares, for the well-known even temper and docility of 
the Suffolk is a valuable attribute to graft on to such 
parent stock. 
41. Distribution. — This breed has found favor in a 
number of countries aside from the United States and 
Canada, and is represented in Spain, France, Germany, /

Austria, Russia and Sweden on the continent, Australia, 
South and North Africa, New Zealand, Argentina and 
other countries; and it has been the self-evident merit 
of the breed that has been the cause of this wide distri- 
bution. The breed has suffered, in America, particularly, 
because of the need of more freely distributed informa- 
tion regarding its good qualities. 
42. Organizations and records.— The Suffolk Stud- 
book Society is the publisher of the stud-book for the breed 
in England. The first volume was published in 1880. 
The breed is represented on this continent by the Ameri- 
can Suffolk Horse Association, with headquarters at 
De Kalb, Illinois. The first volume of the stud-book of 
the latter association was published in 1907, and a second 
has since appeared with a total of nine hundred eight 
registrations.

THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 
Tue form peculiar to all heavy-harness horses is close 
and full made, with a high degree of finish and a stylish, 
flashy way of going, characterized by extreme knee and 
hock action. / He is the horse of fashion, utilized for show 
and park purposes almost exclusively. 
The term “heavy harness ”’ applied to horses is fre- 
quently misunderstood and horses so designated are com- 
monly confused with drafters. The origin of the term is 
clear if three divisions of horses are recognized — work, har- 
ness and saddle. Harness horses are further subdivided 
into heavy and light according to the style of vehicle to 
which they are put and the consequent weight of leather 
which they are required to wear. 
Hackney Horse. Plate III. Fig. 9. 
By John A. Craig 
43. The present-day Hackney is a harness horse 
breed. Among the early English writers on subjects 
relating to the horse, the word “ hackney ” was appar- 
ently used frequently as a synonym for roadster. The 
word occurs in the earliest English, but its meaning, or 
rather the class of horse that it was applied to, is not 
made clear. Mr. Euren, the secretary of the English 
Hackney Horse Society, states that the Normans, at the 
time of their invasion, introduced the word haquenée or 
44

AMERICAN SappLE Horse. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70

-P-A-G-E-71
    THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 45 
hacquenée, which he states was recognized as far back as 
the year 1303. Chaucer also used the word “ hakeney ” 
or “ hacknay,” but does not give any clue as to the class 
of horse referred to. Cully, an early English writer on 
live-stock subjects, does not mention the Hackney. Law- 
rence, however, in some of his writings, gives us an inkling 
as to its application, and, as stated, it meant a roadster. 
44. Qrigin.— The development of the Hackney into 
a breed may be traced to definite stimuli, which have been 
noticeable and in operation with more or less force in the 
development of several other breeds of horses. In the 
evolution of the breeds of light horses, there may be said 
to be a district suitable for rearing light horses of quality, 
which implies a soil well-drained, either light, hilly or 
underlaid with limestone, with good grass, all of which 
should indicate wholesome grazing conditions. With these 
associate men who love a horse, and let them be inspired 
with a definite aim, and the breed takes form and becomes 
popular according to the force and growth of the demand 
and ideals. A variety of sourcesare invariably drawn on, 
frequently very diverse in some attributes, but somewhat 
similar in the breed characteristics desired ; and, these once 
secured, the aim becomes to concentrate and multiply them. : 
With these general conditions in view, let us bring their 
particular application to the Hackney. As bearing on 
this, and also to show that these factors were recognized 
by horsemen at a very early day, a quotation from Law- 
tence will suffice: “ Light soils and a hilly surface of 
ground generally produce clean, vigorous and active 
horses, and probably there is no county in England where 
a better sort are bred than in Shropshire. Yorkshire and 
Lincolnshire are celebrated for carriage horses, and many 
very good ones are reared in those districts.” Yorkshire
-P-A-G-E-72
  46 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
and Norfolk were the original home of the Hackney, at 
an early time known also as the Norfolk trotter; and 
Yorkshire became prominent in the development of this 
breed, through its adaptability to light horses and supe- 
riority over the counties of Shropshire and Lincoln- 
shire in that the Yorkshireman was an enthusiastig, horse- 
man. To carry the postulate to its full afd more 
recent application, it is necessary only to direct attention 
to what Kentucky, Vermont, Virginia, Tennessee and 
other states possessing the character of soil and people 
referred to, have accomplished. Conversely, apply what 
has been stated to be the evolution of draft breeds, and 
it will be apparent that the heaviest breeds of draft 
horses come from the lower and more level lands, with 
their more lush vegetation. 
45. Breeding saddle horses. — Continuing our refer- 
ence to Yorkshire and Norfolk, it should be said that the 
_ demand during the earliest time was for a horse that could 
trot fast under saddle, and the horsemen of these two 
counties vigorously took up the work of breeding a stoutly 
built fast trotting horse of as much endurance as possible. 
It is said (Wallace, Live-Stock) that the Norwegian horse 
was used at a very early day on the common mares of 
these counties, as it was in Norfolk and Yorkshire where 
the Norse invaders had their principal strongholds in Eng- 
land. The influence of this on the breed may be slighted 
when the more potent influence of the Thoroughbred is 
considered. It is also of interest to mention that even 
the blood of the Standardbred trotter found its way into 
some of the Hackney pedigrees through Shepherd F. 
Knapp, No. 282 in the register of Standardbred horses. 
The main source of the Hackney blood lines runs back to 
Arabian origin through the Thoroughbred, being similar
-P-A-G-E-73
THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 47 
in this respect to all the other breeds of light horses. 
Since the eighteenth century, the breed has been under- 
going evolution, and it may be said to have had its in- 
ception with Shales (699), variously called ‘The Orig- 
inal,” “‘ Old Shales,” and so on. This horse, in the history 
of the Hackney or Norfolk trotter, stands in relation to 
the breed very much as Hambletonian 10 does in that of 
the Standardbred horse or American trotter; and, 
curiously enough, their breeding is of surprising similarity. 
Shales (699) was sired by Blaze, a Thoroughbred horse, 
foaled in 1733. It is said that Blaze was not a Thorough- 
bred, but the best evidence we have credits him with 
being about as much so as any other horse of that early 
day. Blaze was by Flying Childers (a noted running 
horse), by the Darley Arabian. The dam of Blaze is 
asserted to have been by Grey Grantham, by Brownlow 
Turk out of a mare by the Duke of Rutland’s Black 
Barb. Now the same Blaze sired Sampson, the sire of 
Engineer, he the sire of Mambrino, and he, in turn, the 
sire of Messenger, which was imported to America and 
was the grandsire of Hambletonian 10. Again, the dam 
of Hambletonian 10 was the Charles Kent mare by Im- 
ported Bellfounder, a Norfolk trotter tracing back through 
the Fireaways to Driver, a son of Shales by Blaze. The 
dam: of the Kent mare was One Eye, by Bishop’s Ham- 
bletonian, a son of Messenger. Yet again, Mambrino 
Chief was by Mambrino Paymaster, by Mambrino, by 
Messenger. So we have the two great lines of the Ameri- 
can trotter, Hambletonian 10 and Mambrino Chief 11, 
tracing back through Messenger to Blaze, and the most 
noted of the early sires of Hackneys or the Norfolk trotters 
going back to the same Blaze. May it not be reasonable 
to assume from these facts that the latter horse orig-
-P-A-G-E-74
48 THE BREEDS OF LIV E-STOCK 
inated the trotting instinct, which has later developed 
into a breed characteristic? . Following the development 
of the Hackney, we find that Shales (699), considered the 
most famous trotter of his day in England, sired Driver 
(187) and Scott’s Shales (692), and, according to the 
statement of a writer of authority, “ to the former of these 
horses many — very many — of the best Hackneys of 
the day owe their origin.” For example, Philip Triffitt’s 
great sire, Fireaway, was by Achilles, by Achilles (Hair- 
sines’), by Fireaway (Scott’s), who was got by Fireaway 
(Ramsdale’s), by Fireaway (Burgess’), by Fireaway 
(West’s), by Fireaway (Jenkinson’s), a son of Driver. 
It may be interesting to state here that John A. Logan 
is authority for the statement that the stock of Triffitt’s 
Fireaway has sold to the amount of $2,500,000, which is 
somewhat of an index to the value of this horse to the 
breed. 
Mention of other noted sires should include Denmark 
(177), sire of Danegelt; Lord Derby II (417), sire of 
Cadet, 1251; Confidence (158), sire of the Champion 
and Reality (665); and Rufus, an Elsenham Challenge 
cup winner and a noted progenitor of Hackney character. 
46. Breeding for driving. — With the change from use 
under the saddle to driving on the road attached to a 
vehicle, the Hackney’s proclivities to trot do not seem to 
have undergone any modification; although there was a 
tendency at this time toward refinement of the type, largely 
through the greater infusion of Thoroughbred blood. 
This also added to the height without changing the form 
much, except to add some to the straightness of the 
croup. Up to this time, and since, considerable evidence 
had been accumulating to indicate that the Hackney 
possessed more than ordinary excellence for long-dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 49 
tance trotting. Such records, it remains to be said, are 
of use only to enable us to understand the original char- 
acteristics of the breed, not for their official value to es- 
tablish the reputation of the Hackney of the present day, 
for speed at the trot, for either long or short distances. 
It is to be remembered, also, that these records, if they 
may be called such, are in nearly all instances dependent 
on hearsay and not on official trials over measured dis- 
tances. It is said that Driver (187), already referred to, 
trotted 17 miles within the hour, and Fireaway is credited 
with having trotted 2 miles in 5 minutes. The perform- 
ance that is most noteworthy is that credited to the mare 
Phenomena, that in July, 1800, trotted 17 miles in 56 
minutes, and shortly afterward repeated the same per- 
formance in 53 minutes. Attention has been drawn to 
the fact that it was not until 1849 that Trustee, in America, 
trotted 20 miles in 59 minutes and 354 seconds. The 
mare’s rate would be 20 miles in 62} minutes, showing 
that at that early day the Hackney or Norfolk trotter 
was noted for ability to trot long distances, with speed 
unusual at that time. 
The secretary of the Hackney Horse Society, Mr. 
Euren, in the first volume of the stud-book, credits the 
era of railroad building with dampening the ardor of the 
breeders of Hackneys; and, for a time, the breed did not 
receive much hearty support. A revival came in a very 
decided manner with the advent of exhibitions, and 
especially .with the inauguration of horse-shows. Until 
the breed began to attract notice for heavy-harness and 
high-stepping purposes, they were not very largely im- 
ported from England, nor did they attain their present ~ 
popularity in England. It was in the spring of 1893 that 
the first notable Hackney exhibition was held in England. 
B 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
50 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
In America, the horse-shows, the growth of recent years, 
as distinct from the usual live-stock shows, were factors 
that did more to popularize the Hackney than any other 
influences. The high-lifting action of the Hackney, 
both fore and aft, made a very attractive feature of the 
shows; and that, coupled with the growth of the high- 
stepping fad, gave the breed a strong impetus, although 
their genuine merit as heavy-harness horses has outlived 
this. The possession of stoutness of form with this 
action has adapted them particularly for heavy harness 
and heavy vehicles. 
47. History in America. — Aside from the first im- 
portation to America of Bellfounder (55), in 1822, by 
James Booth, of Boston, the next importation of note was 
the stallion Fordham, a son of Denmark, brought over in 
1881, by Hillhurst Stock Farm, of which Senator Cochrane, 
of Quebec, Canada, was proprietor. Then comes the 
era of the horse-show, when extensive importations were 
made, chiefly into the New England states and Canada, 
with scattering importations into Ohio, Wisconsin, and 
other states. The largest of these importations was 
made in 1890 by Seward Webb, of Vermont, who imported 
thirty-one horses, four of which were stallions. About 
this time, there was a lull in the profitableness of breeding 
Standardbred trotters, which put many horses of this 
breeding on the market that otherwise would have been 
retained in the breeding stud. Attention was drawn to 
the fact that many horses of Standardbred trotting lines 
were competing with the Hackney, especially in the high- 
stepping classes, in the show-ring. They were more or 
less freaks, with the high stepping exaggerated by heavy 
shoeing and training, but they sometimes made a more 
popular show than the Hackney, by being able to go   
-P-A-G-E-77
   ‘ 
THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 51 
fast as well as high. There was little inclination among 
exhibitors at that time to stop and consider that fast 
going was not a much sought after characteristic for a 
high-stepping or a heavy-harness horse. A lessening of 
the interest in the mere high goer, and more attention to 
the trueness and serviceability of the action, has done 
good in recent years; and the outcome has been to 
strengthen the position of the Hackney and make it more 
decidedly a heavy-harness horse. 
48. Description. — The Hackney of true type is a 
horse of substance, extremely smooth and with gracefully 
curved outlines (Fig. 9). Being full made, owing to 
splendid muscular de- 
velopment, and being 
on short legs, the rep- 
resentative of this 
breed suffers in stat- 
ure in comparison 
with most of the other 
coach breeds. The 
type most sought, and 
the one that may be 
said to be the old- 
fashioned type, repre- 
sents a powerfully 
built horse, round- 
ribbed, muscular loin, and plump quarters, with short legs. 
The desire for more quality on the part of some of the 
breeders, and the use of Thoroughbred blood to secure it, 
had the effect of making some of them more bloodlike and 
rangier in appearance. The question of height in the 
Hackney has been liberally discussed, and the general 
belief is that a height of 15.2 to 16 hands is most com- 
  Fig. 9.— Hackney stallion.
-P-A-G-E-78
52 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
patible with the other features of the type that are de- 
sired. It might be mentioned that until recent years the 
Hackney rings at the exhibitions of the Royal Agricultural 
Society of England were open only to horses not exceeding 
15.2 hands in height. So many of the noted sires of later 
years have been over that height, that it was not advisable 
to enforce the restriction, and consequently it was re- 
moved. A well-known writer states that it is somewhat 
remarkable to note that most of the successful stallions, 
both as sires and exhibition horses, of the present and 
past generations, have stood 15.2 hands high. 
For a horse of such substance, the Hackney is not 
deficient in quality, although to combine the two in a 
right degree is as much a problem with the Hackney 
breeders as it is with the breeders of the other breeds of 
coach horses. Substance, meaning thereby muscular de- 
velopment and size of bone, is easily enough secured ; 
but to have with it the refinement of features and tissues, 
with fluted legs, which makes up quality, is a combination 
of the highest excellencies. 
Such being the general form, a more careful analysis 
of the several features that blend into the type desired 
is necessary to fill out the details of the true type. The 
Hackney head sometimes approaches meatiness, but, as 
a rule, it is well proportioned to the body, clean-cut, with 
full eyes and specially alert and medium-sized ears. It 
has been criticized for a tendency towards being “ bull” 
or thick-necked. In the Hackney, the shoulder is a 
point of particular importance, for it has a great deal to 
do with the high knee-folding action, so very much ad- 
mired in the heavy-harness horse. A long, sloping shoul- 
der, well clothed with muscle, gives it that lifting power 
in front which is a feature of the front action more often

met with in this breed than any other. The body must 
necessarily be deep and round-ribbed, to give that appear- 
ance of substance required, together with the rotundity 
characteristic of the type. A loin swathed in muscles, 
even to the extent of rounding upwards slightly, makes a 
strong, short coupling, which should join smoothly a 
plump rounded and deeply muscled hind-quarter. These, 
with muscular thighs and well-set and strong hocks, are 
derivative of the snappy and propelling hock action 
behind. ~ 
49. The action. — It is in the action of the Hackney 
that the chief merit of the breed for heavy-harness pur- 
poses resides, although this statement is not meant 
to belittle the special type required also. It is styl- 
ish, attractive action, not speed, that is of most im- 
portance. The front feet, in walking or trotting, are 
lifted with snap and spring, and in the trot the foot goes 
forward after being uplifted, as if it were following the 
rim of a wheel. It is not held in the air at any one point; 
that is, the leg is not fully extended when the foot is 
several inches from the ground, but it is still following 
the imaginary rim of a wheel when it reaches the ground , 
and is planted firmly. When pulled up, it does not fly 
toward the elbows as if to hit them, but goes up and out 
without any delay in the knee-folding. While the fore 
action is a point of paramount importance, yet it may 
be said that in its hock action for heavy-harness purposes 
the Hackney has hardly a peer. The hock is lifted 
sharply toward the body, and the action is in no sense 
sprawling. Many horses can be made to step high and 
fold the knee, as a Hackney or heavy-harness horse should 
do, but the true heavy-harness hock action is not sus- 
ceptible to artificial imitation. The weakness of most 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  54 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
horses, other than Hackneys, in the heavy-harness classes, 
is that the hind-leg dwells somewhat like a duck swimming 
in water; it is not brought up quickly to the body. Very 
frequently, the leg from the hock down is thrown stiffly 
forward, making the horse spread or sprawl in his gait, 
as his hind-feet have to be thrown out and past the fore- 
feet. Such a horse, no matter how high or folding or 
even perfect his fore action may be, cannot go with that 
collected and well-balanced stride that a heavy-harness 
horse should have. He may likely go faster, but at a 
moderate gait, such as that which is most useful for heavy- 
harness horses, he cannot go collected and with snap and 
style. Snap and style in hind action are as _neces- 
sary in the view of the critical horseman as that of the 
fore-feet, and, to have it, the hocks must be properly 
flexed, with perhaps less stifle action than that required 
for speed. 
50. Color of the Hackney. — In reference to the color, 
it may be said that these horses are mostly chestnut, bay 
or brown, with white markings. A rich, dappled brown 
is not an infrequent color. 
51. Soundness of the Hackney. — A note should be 
made of the fact that unsoundness is not frequent among 
Hackneys. While not in the least desiring to detract 
from this desirable trait, yet it needs to be qualified some- 
what, especially when it is used to make invidious com- 
parisons with the Standardbred trotter. The Standard- 
bred trotter usually leads a strenuous life, beginning to 
race when two years old. The popularity of the colt 
trotter as a money-maker, because of the large stakes for 
two- and three-year-olds, as well as the large purses for 
free-for-all campaigners, puts our Standardbred trotter 
through a course of racing that is a very trying ordeal.
-P-A-G-E-81
   THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 55 
The Hackney is more carefully kept and is never tried 
out in the sense that our trotting horses are, consequently 
it should be sounder and always fresher. The fact re- 
mains that the Hackney as a breed is unusually free from 
unsoundness. Since the Shire Horse Society of England 
wisely decided, in 1885, that all horses at their annual 
show should undergo veterinary examination conducted 
by three qualified veterinarians, other societies have 
followed the system, although with most of them only 
one veterinarian acts. In regard to the Hackney, it may 
be stated that the Hackney Horse Society for the past 
seventeen years has subjected the entries to its show to 
veterinary examination, and the percentage rejected has 
been very small. Of course, when such a system is in 
vogue, much carefulness on this point would be observed 
by exhibitors; consequently it is hardly a complete index 
to the prevalence of unsoundness in the breed as a whole. 
However, combined with general observation, the figures 
bear out the point that unsoundness is not very prevalent. 
In the years from 1896 to 1904, inclusive, 2108 of the 
horses were examined, and 106 of these were rejected, 
showing an average of not quite 5 per cent rejected. 
52. Uses of the Hackney.— From what has been 
written, it is clear that the special field for the Hackney 
is the production of heavy-harness horses, for the breed 
in itself has been specifically bred for that purpose. The 
high knee-folding action and attractive appearance, either 
standing or in motion, adapt it for the production of stylish 
heavy-harness horses for city driving. Possessing these 
qualities, with the substance and smoothness of type to 
wear heavy leather becomingly, the Hackney as a breed 
has superior claims. 
The degree to which a breed may be useful in producing
-P-A-G-E-82
56 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
a marketable product is a factor that has to be considered, 
as well as the breed characteristics. However useful 
pure-bred horses may be, yet the degree to which they 
-may contribute to the general improvement of the horses 
of a country is a broader and more influential factor 
entering into their standing. In this respect, the Hackney 
has established a reputation. On our common mares of 
much quality and some action, the Hackney makes a 
desirable cross. As Johnstone says, “ the similarity of 
action I count the most salient of its features,” and it is 
because this mechanical action is so deeply bred into the 
Hackney that it is, perhaps, the most likely of any of the 
European light horses to transmit it. It seems to be 
easier to produce the type than it is to secure the natural 
heavy-harness action. The tendency toward this action 
and type is surely stronger in the produce of the Hackney, 
because the breed itself has been bred for years for just 
those things; yet it is not safe to assume that it will come 
spontaneous to the service without proper mannering and 
encouragement. 
53. Distribution. — The good qualities of the Hackney 
have attracted world-wide attention, and, as a conse- 
quence, it is now found in many lands. In general, from 
England it has gone out into France, Germany, Holland, 
Denmark, Belgium, Spain, Italy, far east into Japan and 
south into Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and west- 
ward into the Argentina in South America, and into 
Canada and the United States in North America. It is 
pressing its way into every land where heavy-harness 
horses are in demand. In America, the Hackney is bred 
in the largest numbers east of the Mississippi river, but 
numbers of the breed have become very broadly scattered 
over the states and provinces.

54. Organizations and records.— The societies de- 
voted to the breed are the English Hackney Horse Society, 
established in 1883, with the first stud-book published the 
following year, and the American Hackney Horse Society, 
with headquarters in New York City, established in 1891. 
The first volume of its stud-book was issued in 1893. 
Six volumes of the American Hackney Stud-books and the 
Annual Reports for 1914 and 1915 have been published, 
covering the registration of over 1700 stallions, over 2900 
mares and 224 foundation stock mares.

55. The name “ French Coach ” originated in America, 
and it is here the official designation of this breed of 
coach horses, although not in use in France, where the 
name “ Demi-sang ” prevails. 
There has always been a strong demand in most of the 
horse markets of the world for high-class coach or carriage 
teams. The fact that carriage teams of right type and 
action have brought unusually high prices in the horse mar- 
kets has always been a strong stimulus for their production. 
This of itself has led to the development of breeds suitable 
for the production of ‘such horses in several countries, but 
an additional stimulus was added to the production of 
the French Coach through the French government being 
actuated by the desire to supply its army with the best 
remounts. The wisdom of this has already accrued ta 
the advantage of the private individual, for superior 
carriage horses are always at a premium, and it remains 
for a war to bring to the attention of other nations the
-P-A-G-E-84
  58 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
superior foresight with which France has provided for 
her cavalry and other army corps in the matter’ of re- 
mounts. It is a national work, the matured fruit of 
which will be fully apparent only in a national crisis when 
most needed. 
56. History in France.—JIn the latter part of the 
seventeenth century, the French government, by establish- 
ing the Administration des Haras, began the systematic 
improvement of their horses, and as early as 1690 there 
were 1600 stallions known as “royal” or “ approved.” 
During the many years of disturbance in France, changes 
of government and national reverses, the work has gone 
steadily on to the present day. In 1879, there were 
3239 stallions in the government service, and at the 
present time provision is made for the maintenance of 
3300 government stallions, mostly kept in that part of 
France west of Paris, and particularly in the province 
or district of Normandy. It is in this section that the 
breed has had its greatest growth, and it was because of 
this that some of the earlier importations were called 
Anglo-Normans. In 1833, a stud-book was established, 
and in 1870 the department of agriculture was given con- 
trol of the government horse-breeding interests under the 
supervision of a director general and staff of inspectors. 
The government control is exercised in a way very similar 
to that described in discussing the Percheron, except that 
the government, in the case of the coach horses, does most 
of the breeding, and consequently branded stallions 
among the French Coachers are not so common as among 
the draft breeds. According to the report of the Director 
General for 1903, about fifteen hundred stallions owned 
by private parties were approved and authorized. The 
same classes are made as in the case of the draft breeds, 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
Te, ee Me aE! ae ee Re REALS ee Mae Tere aT ee eee. eee ee 
THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 59 
there being (1) the stallions in the government service, 
(2) the stallions subsidized to the extent of $100 to $1000 
yearly while approved, and (3) the stallions authorized 
for public patronage. All others are prevented by a law 
passed in 1885 from standing at public service, although 
any owner, at his discretion, may use such for private 
purposes, a practice that is not encouraged. 
In the breeding operations of the government, a great 
variety of sources are drawn on. Thoroughbreds have 
been very extensively imported from England since the 
early days of the breed, and Hackneys have been freely 
imported and liberally used; in the inception of the 
breed, twenty to thirty Hackneys were imported annually. 
Heavy importations of Arabians and others from the 
Orient have been made, particularly in the early stages 
of government control, and even stallions of American 
breeding have been used. Niger, whose record is quoted 
elsewhere as among the best, was sired by the Hackney 
stallion Norfolk Phenomenon, and had an American-bred 
mare for his dam. Descendants of Norfolk Phenomenon 
were a popular line of breeding, and enter largely into the 
pedigrees of many of the Demi-sang. Another stallion 
that had considerable to do with the better type was 
Aemulus by Mambrino Pilot, and out of a Morgan-bred 
mare, Black Bess, consequently representing one of the 
old strains, common among our Standardbred trotters. 
This is mentioned to indicate further the variety of sources 
drawn on for foundation stock. In the production of 
trotters among the French Coach horses, one stallion, 
Fuchsia, holds about the same relation to the breed as 
Hambletonian 10 does to that of our American Standard- 
bred trotters, in the extent to which the blood of each 
predominates in the respective breeds.  
-P-A-G-E-86
  60 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
57. History in America.— The French Coach horse 
was most extensively imported to this country during the 
eighties, many of them coming to the eastern states. 
Those sent west were most largely taken to the states 
of Illinois and Ohio. In the middle west they have been 
liberally patronized, and when the foundation mares were 
of suitable size and type, and a fair degree of action, high- 
class carriage horses have been produced. The scarcity 
of the proper type of mares to breed to such stallions 
militated against the reputation of the breed for crossing 
purposes; and especially has the scarcity of genuine 
coach action been the source of some disappointment. 
58. Types of French Coach horses. — Owing to the 
needs of the army, the French Coach horse in France is 
represented by two types, referred to as the Demi-sang 
trotteur, or those of the trotting type, and the Demi-sang 
carrossier, or those of the coach type. There are now 
two stud-books in France for the registrationef these: 
The French Stud-book, A Register of Demi-sang Horses 
Born and Imported in France, established in 1833; and 
the Stud-book Trotteur, compiled and published in 1907. 
Records had been compiled before this, but only in recent 
years has the full importance of these become manifest 
to the patrons of the breed. 
59. Coach type. —— The French Coach horse of the coach 
or “‘ carrossier ” type is in every essential a coach or car- 
riage horse according to the market requirements (Fig. 10). 
These horses stand, on an average, sixteen hands high, 
and in weight may vary from ten to fourteen hundred 
pounds. Most of the horses of this type are upstanding, 
carrying their heads and tails high when in motion or at 
rest. They are smooth, symmetrical and invariably of 
fine quality, with very graceful movement, having high
-P-A-G-E-87
THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 61 
and bold knee action, with regular, uplifting, hock action. 
They have intelligent heads, graceful necks, snugly ribbed 
bodies and muscular quarters. If any part of the con- 
formation might be chosen as fit for general criticism, it 
would be the legs, although these, in most instances, are 
well set and have every evidence of quality. There is an 
airiness and graceful- 
ness about a well set- 
up French Coacher 
that is hard to find in 
any other.coach breed. 
It is due chiefly to 
their unusual length 
and gracefulness_ of 
neck, in conjunction 
with a spirit of alert- 
ness in movement or 
statuesqueness in 
standing which, be- 
sides being due to bodily conformation, is also traceable 
to the excellent training they receive to show their qual- 
ities to the best advantage. The common colors are bay, 
brown or black. Considering the mixed breeding fol- 
lowed in evolving the French Coach, it is exceptionally 
uniform in type, a result due likely to the uniformity in 
the standards of the men who as directors have control 
of the government breeding operations. The greatest 
success in producing the most handsome and stylish 
carriage or coach horses has been attained by using 
mares approaching as nearly as possible the type desired, 
with as much quality and action as possible. 
60. The trotting type. — The production of the trotting 
type for many purposes has been encouraged since 1836,

62 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
when the French government began offering prizes for 
trotting races, with the special object of encouraging long- 
distance trotting, more especially under. the saddle. 
The races are usually for distances varying from two to 
three miles, and are run over sod ground. The records 
are established by the kilometer, which is about five- 
eighths of a mile, without reference to whether the race 
extended one or three miles. They are made under saddle 
from a standing start and carrying not less than 120 
pounds. As might be expected, those of the trotting 
type are racier in appearance, being somewhat like our 
own trotters, finely drawn, more angular than the coach 
type, rangier in appearance and somewhat better in 
quality. A horse of stamina and substance, as well as 
speed, is required, for it is to be remembered that the 
races are for long distances over turf, which demands 
strong, bold going and powerful action on the part of the 
animals. 
61. Speed records and races. — As to speed, M. W. 
Dunham, who was an extensive importer and breeder, 
has compiled the following data from official records: 
In 1891, there were 1399 contestants in races, 312 of 
which trotted races of two to three and three-fourths’ 
miles at less than three minutes per mile; 137 under 
2:50, 112 under 2:45 and 62 under 2:40. One hundred 
and one of the 312 were three-year-olds. The average 
distance was 2;/; miles; average time per mile, 2:50; 
fastest time for three-year-olds, distance 2 miles, 
6:33; fastest time for five- to seven-year-olds, distance 
3% miles, 8 minutes. In further reference to speed it 
may be noted that in 1877, Zacinthe is credited with hav- 
ing trotted 18$ miles over a good road in 59 minutes, and 
Niger in 1873 trotted 2} miles in 6:55. To prevent the
-P-A-G-E-89
THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 63 
sacrifice of size for speed, it is asserted by the authority 
just previously quoted that a law was enacted excluding 
all horses from public races that were under fifteen and 
one-fourth hands high. 
As illustrating the conditions under which most of the 
races are held, the Derby of Rouen may be cited. It is 
worth 20,000 francs, made for three-year-olds, to be entered 
the year of their birth, and trotted in June on turf track 
two miles under saddle, fillies to carry 120 pounds, colts 
125 pounds. From these conditions and the data sub- 
mitted, it is easy to understand that the government’s 
aim is to encourage speed at the trot without sacrificing 
stamina or substance. 
62. Uses of the French Coach horse. — The use of the 
French Coach horse for carriage, cavalry and fast saddle 
purposes will have been gathered from the preceding dis- 
cussion. It remains to mention the use of French Coach 
stallions on common mares bred in America for the pro- 
duction of a grade coach horse for general city purposes. 
Considerable success has followed such efforts when pure- 
bred stallions have been used. Half- and three-quarter 
bred coachers have commanded high prices on the market.” 
63. Distribution. — The French Coach horse has been 
imported into many parts of Europe and America, but 
has not been bred systematically to any great extent out- 
side of its native home. As has been said, it is found in 
America chiefly in the eastern states, Illinois and Ohio 
being, perhaps, the leaders. 
64. Organizations and records. — The stud-books de- 
voted to this breed in France are mentioned in paragraph 
58. The French Jockey Club, organized in 1833, has been 
responsible for much of the development of the breed. 
The French Coach is represented in America by the

65. The title indicates that this is a breed of coach 
horses, taking its name from Germany, where it was 
developed. Horse-breeding in Germany is influenced 
greatly by military requirements, and few of the draft 
types are found there. Although Germany has several 
types or breeds of horses that are suitable for commercial 
and military purposes, she still imports many English 
horses. 
66. History in Germany.— Formerly the German 
Empire was comprised of a number of states or princi- 
palities each with its own form of government. Since 
there was no interchange of ideas, a number of strains of 
horses developed, varying widely in weight, conformation 
and action. Such was the condition of horse-breeding 
at the time of the formation of the German Empire. 
While several of these strains retain their identity at the 
present time, many others have been absorbed. This no 
doubt accounts for much of the hese in the early 
history of the German horse. 
The northwestern parts of Germany, particularly the 
lowlands drained by the rivers Elbe, Weser and Ems, 
which flow into the North sea, have long been noted as the 
horse-breeding section of the Empire. Early records of 
horse-breeding in Germany go back nearly five centuries. 
As early as 1500, important annual fairs were held in
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 65 
Friesland, near the Holland boundary, where buyers from 
Holland, Belgium and Germany found superior horses. 
A government stud was established at Ilo, which con- 
tained 182 horses in 1648. At Harlingerland, in East 
Friesland, government studs were in operation, and re- 
ports refer to these as far back as 1712, when sixteen 
stallions were used for the service of 819 mares. In 
1889, in this same region, fifteen stallions were used 
on 1421 mares. While the Thoroughbred was ex- 
tensively used in the formation of the French Coach 
horse, the Germans made little use of English blood in 
the development of their horses, particularly in the breed- 
ing of horses for cavalry. The Germans demanded a 
horse possessing much substance. In other horse-breed- 
ing countries, particularly England and France, we find 
draft and coach horses being developed side by side, which 
leads to a division of labor, the heavy or draft horses doing 
the heavy work, and the light horses doing the lighter 
work. In Germany, the same breed often serves both 
purposes. It is interesting to note that no attempt has 
been made to breed horses for speed as in England and 
France. It seems that the prevailing idea was to produce 
a heavier horse suitable for general purpose and for mili- 
tary service. 
Government supervision of horse-breeding in Germany 
has obtained for centuries. The use of stallions on mares 
of East Friesland was regulated by royal edict for many 
years. It was made a law that no permits should be 
issued authorizing the use of stallions, unless the latter 
had passed a satisfactory government inspection. At 
the present time, both the government and the agricul- 
tural societies promote intelligent horse-breeding. Prizes 
are awarded to animals of special merit, and such animals 
F

66 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
must remain in the country for a specified term. First 
prizes are awarded only to mature horses and mares that 
have shown merit as breeders. Stallion shows have long 
been held at Aurich, in East Friesland, where the horses 
are brought annually for inspection and approval. Prizes 
for brood mares are also awarded by the government. 
67. History in America. — The history of the German 
Coach horse in America is comparatively brief. It first 
made its appearance in the United States in the eighties. 
Not much prior to 1890 did the breed receive recognition 
at American shows. A. B. Holbert, of Greeley, Iowa, 
was one of the earliest to introduce the breed. Oltmann 
Brothers, of Illinois, and Crouch & Son, of Indiana, have 
also been most actively and prominently identified with 
its promotion in America. 
German Coach horses of importance are not as yet 
found in America in large numbers. Among the earlier 
ones imported, Moltke 13, Kaiser Wilhelm 494, Young 
Altma I 458, and Young Adonis 476, met with favorable 
comment, the latter being a successful prize-winner in 
California in 1891. In the central West, Bertus, brought 
out by Oltmann Brothers, and Euto and Hannibal, 
owned by Crouch & Son, have been distinguished in the 
show-ring, winning against the severest competition for 
years in succession. 
68. Description. — In describing the characteristics of a 
typical German Coach horse as seen in America (Fig. 11), 
the German Hanoverian and Oldenburg coach Horse 
Stud-book says: 
“The typical German horse is bay, brown or black, six- 
teen to sixteen and one-half hands high, and weighs 1350 to 
1450 pounds. He has a deep, round body, close ribbed, 
and well proportioned, neck long and high set on the

  THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 67 
shoulders, neat at the throat, with clean cut head and with 
bright and intelligent countenance. His back is short and 
strong, smooth at coupling, tail well set, plump rounded 
quarters, strongly muscled limbs, strong hock, clean flat 
bone, and the _ best 
possible feet.” 
From the discussion 
of types given below, 
it will be evident that 
these horses vary in 
size. Coarseness: is 
not uncommon, as 
seen in large head and 
joints, with more or 
less grossness of bone. 
In action, from the 
coach horse point of 
view, they are fre- Fic. 11.— German Coach stallion. 
quently deficient. A 
superior folding of knee and flexing of hock, is not a 
prevailing attribute of the American specimens of the 
breed. 
69. Types and families. — As stated above, owing to 
the conditions prevailing in Germany, we have many 
types of German Coach horses. Perhaps the most noted 
are the East Prussian or Trakehner horses, the Hanoverian, 
the Holstein, the Oldenburg, and the Schleswig coach 
horses. Most of these have separate stud-books and are 
well recognized. 
70. The East Prussian or Trakehner horse is perhaps 
the lightest of all. It has a good disposition, great en- 
durance, a fine head, well-formed back and is well ribbed 
up. It is, perhaps, rather long legged, looks rather light

          68 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
for its height, and lacks the action that is admired in a 
carriage horse. In 1732, Frederick William I, King of 
Prussia, founded the stud at Trakehner. This soon be- 
came the home breeding center of East Prussia. Fred- 
erick furnished this stud with something more than 1100 
horses collected from the royal studs. There were a few 
importations from Arabia and a few Thoroughbreds 
added to the stud from time to time. 
71. The Hanoverian horses are larger than the East 
Prussian horses. However, they are softer, and their 
action not so good, due, perhaps, to the Arabian and 
Thoroughbred blood in the East Prussian horses. They 
are used more for draft than for saddle purposes. They 
have strong legs and a good back, on which they can carry 
a load sufficiently heavy to make them serviceable military 
horses. These horses are bred by farmers, who work 
the brood mares on their farms. There is no trace of - 
either Arabian or Thoroughbred blood in their veins. 
72. The Holstein horses are about equal to the Hano- 
verian in size. They are fine powerful horses, with 
good legs and free action, are suitable for both riding 
and driving, and are in great demand; but it is doubtful 
whether they are as enduring as the East Prussian horses. 
For many centuries, Holstein has been noted for its good 
horses. 
73. Oldenburg horses are, perhaps, the parent of the 
German Coach horses, and are used for heavy coach 
work, and as all-purpose horses, but seldom are used 
as saddlers. Some writers contend that these horses 
are not of the best quality, but stand in high favor be- 
cause of their great size, some being seventeen hands 
high, and broad in proportion. They have good dis-

74. East Friesland horses are about as large as the 
Oldenburg horses, and have grown up under similar 
conditions. The East Friesland Stud-book says: ‘‘ The 
object of the breed is to produce a strong, noble and 
docile carriage horse, which will develop quickly, and 
can be put to light agricultural work in its third year, 
in order to refund a part of its cost of rearing.” 
75. Schleswig horses were formerly among the most 
highly, prized of German horses. They were in great 
demand for military purposes as they possessed sufficient 
size and stamina to carry the heavily armored knight 
and to do all kinds of pack and draft work. Possibly the 
most noted stud in Schleswig was that established by 
Frederick IIT in 1648. It is stated that present-day horses 
can be traced to this stud. In 1891 the Registered 
Union of Schleswig Horse Breeding Societies was formed 
with the stated object of ‘‘ supplying a strong work horse 
that can fulfill agricultural, commercial and military 
requirements.” 
76. Uses of German Coach horses. — As stated above, 
in the German Empire this is the horse-of-all-work. At 
home, this breed is called on to do the saddle work, the 
light as well as the heavy carriage work, and the draft 
work. In this country, the German Coach horse differs — 
from other coach horses in at least two respects. In the 
first place, there has never been any attempt to breed 
or train them to speed at the trot ; and in the second place, 
some strains are decidedly heavier than the other coach 
horses, notably the Hackney and the French Coach. 
There may be individual exceptions to this statement, 
but in this country the large German Coacher ranks between 
the French Coach and the Suffolk Punch, the lightest of 
the draft breeds. :

70 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Since we have the two extremes, varying so much in 
size, conformation and action, we might expect them to 
meet a variety of conditions. For example, take the 
East Prussian or Trakehner horses, which have some 
Arabian and Thoroughbred blood in their veins, and we 
would expect these to meet any condition requiring a 
light well-bred horse. They possess much quality, action 
and endurance, and are undoubtedly adapted for light 
coach work. On the other hand, we would not expect 
the heavy horses from Oldenburg, to be so active nor 
enduring. In fact, these big-horses are looked on with 
disfavor by some persons. 
77. Distribution. — The German Coach horse is found 
in many countries throughout Europe, South Africa and 
both North and South America. In Canada, it is per- 
haps most popular in the Northwest. In the United 
States, it is most popular in the states of Indiana, Illinois 
and Iowa, but it is found in many parts of the country. 
78. Organizations and records. — The German, Hano- 
verian and Oldenburg Coach Horse Association of Amer- 
ica was incorporated under the laws of the state of Illinois 
about 1892, and a stud-book was organized, containing 
pedigrees of registered stallions and mares imported, or 
raised in America. Two volumes have been issued. 
Three thousand stallions and 500 mares have been regis- 
tered. Soon after the organization of the German, 
Hanoverian and Oldenburg Coach Horse Association, 
came the Oldenburg Coach Horse Association, which was 
also incorporated in Illinois. So far as the American public 
is aware, the various coach horses brought to America 
from Germany are known as the German Coach breed, 
whether Oldenburg, Hanoverian, or otherwise. This 
difference of title may be accounted for in part by the   
-P-A-G-E-97
THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 71 
variety of types. It would seem that. the advocates of 
the breed would do well to clarify in some permanent 
way this apparent confusion of names.

79. The Yorkshire Coach horse is an outgrowth of the 
Cleveland Bay Coach horse, conceded to be merely an 
improved type. The two are so inseparably associated 
that it is deemed best to consider them together. In 
fact, in America, they are considered to be one breed and 
are registered in the same stud-book. 
80. History in Great Britain.— Perhaps the best 
evidence we have of the ancient origin of this breed is the 
prevalence of so many theories as to the foundation from 
which it started. Martin Doyle, writing in 1843, asserts 
that it is descended from the old war horse of Great 
Britain. There are other authorities, also, who state 
that this breed has the best claim to the distinction of 
being related to the horses that pulled the war chariots 
of the early Britons when Julius Cesar invaded England. 
As a matter of fact the first records of the Cleveland 
horse connect it with being a pack or Chapman horse. 
It is historically certain that the breed originated in 
Yorkshire, one of the northern counties of England. 
’ The conditions of Yorkshire were eminently suitable for 
the production of superior. light horses. The people 
were horsemen, and the fertile valleys and hills, under- 
‘laid in the best grazing districts with limestone, were very 
productive of nutritious grass. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
ce THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
No specific reference to the Cleveland breed is made by 
any of the earlest writers. The first distinct reference to 
the Cleveland seems to be that made by George Culley, 
in his “‘ Observations on Live Stock,” published in 1801. 
In this reference, Culley originates the theory that the 
Cleveland Bay horse is the result of the mixture of the 
Thoroughbred with the cart horse, a theory which some 
writers combat so far as to say that neither the Thorough- 
bred nor a heavy strain like the old cart horse had any- 
thing to do with the formation of the breed. One author- 
ity,| who takes unusual pains to substantiate the war 
horse theory of Cleveland Bay origin, goes to consider- 
able length to disprove the introduction of either cart or 
Thoroughbred blood, and this he has failed to acconiplish, 
as he has been forced to acknowledge that “ Probability 
points to a Thoroughbred Traveler as having had some- 
thing to do with imparting fresh quality and courage to 
the Cleveland Bay.” The straight croup or level hind- 
quarter is a decided Thoroughbred characteristic, and it 
is a trait that most other breeds of light horses tend 
towards when much Thoroughbred blood is used, as has 
been found in the instance. of both the Hackney and the 
French Coach horses. It is a matter of record, too, that 
Dunsley’s Dart, one of the three sires that seem to have 
had most to do in establishing the Cleveland as a breed, 
goes back to the Darley Arabian, and the preface to the 
Yorkshire coach studbook so states. The old Cleveland 
Bay, the horse that was so popular in early days for 
heavy coaches and for matched teams for the London 
market, may not have had very much Thoroughbred 
blood in it, considering the amount that has been used 
later.

-P-A-G-E-99
THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 13 
The best early history of the county of Yorkshire 
appears in three separate prize essays by different writers, 
published in the ninth volume of the Royal Agricultural 
Society (England) Report, published in 1848, from which 
the following reference by George Legard is taken: 
“Formerly, a large, powerful, bony animal was required 
for carriage purposes; the fashion of the present day has, 
however, changed this particular, and now it is necessary 
that the London carriage horse should be at least three 
parts Thoroughbred. Consequently, all traces of the 
~ original pure coaching breed or Cleveland Bay, as it was 
termed, are nearly obliterated.” Another writer on 
Yorkshire in the same report, page 518, says: “The 
fCleveland, as a pure-bred, is losing something of its dis- 
tinctiveness. It is running into a proverb that a Cleve- 
land horse is too stiff for a hunter and too light for a 
. coacher, but there are still remnants of the breed, though 
less carefully kept distinctively than may be wished by 
advocates of the breed.” 
Other causes, too, were operating to change the type of 
the breed and encourage the more liberal use of Thorough- 
bred blood. One of these was that the abundant grass- 
land was converted into tillage-land. The high price of 
grains, due to the war, induced an unusual activity in 
farming, and a heavier horse was called for. The coal 
industry also demanded a heavier horse. Again, the use 
of the horse on the road, because of lighter vehicles, called 
for a lighter horse, so that, in a multitude of ways, the 
old type of Cleveland was undergoing dissolution. When 
the outlook seemed darkest, the American trade opened 
up, and, in 1884, the Cleveland Bay Horse Society was 
formed, and a stud-book established. At this time 
‘Thoroughbred blood was used very liberally. So much  
-P-A-G-E-100
    
74 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
stress would not be laid on the Thoroughbred blood 
introduced, if the writer did not believe that all our 
recognized breeds of light horses have more or less Thor- 
oughbred blood in them, and all are, as a consequence, 
rooted deep in Oriental ancestry, chiefly the Arab. 
In 1889 the Royal Agriculture Society recognized the 
Cleveland Bay as one of the distinct breeds of English 
horses, and offered prizes for it, although it was shown 
with the Yorkshire Coach. At the meeting of the so- 
cieties, in York, as early as 1848, a few Clevelands were 
shown. 
81. History in America. — It cannot be said that the 
Cleveland Bay or Yorkshire Coach horse ever had the 
popularity in this country that has attended the impor- 
tation of some of the other breeds of light horses. Those 
that were imported were considered unusually good 
representatives, but the type and breed characteristics 
never found much favor. In coach or carriage horses, 
high and attractive front action with good hock action 
are essentials, combined with a stylish, smooth and 
symmetrical appearance, associated with quality in all 
parts. In these respects, the Cleveland Bay did not 
approach the excellence shown by other breeds. 
82. Description. —In the Cleveland Stud-book (British) 
there is the following description of the Cleveland Bay 
horse which, in addition to being very accurate, is also 
official: ‘‘ From sixteen hands one inch to sixteen hands 
two and one-half inches in height, he should be possessed 
of good, sloping shoulders, a short back, powerful loins, 
and long quarters. His head is rather plain than other- 
wise, and on the long side, but it is well carried, and his 
general appearance denotes strength, combined in a 
manner not seen in any other light horse breed. His
-P-A-G-E-101

action is not specially high, but it is the kind for getting 
over the ground. In color he is bay — either light or 
dark — with black ee 
legs clear of hair; 
and black, zebra-like 
stripes on the arm and 
above the hocks are 
sometimes seen. 
These are known as 
the black points and 
are supposed to de- 
note special, purity of 
breeding. White, 
save a small star or a 
few white hairs in the 
heel, is not admissible, a blaze or white foot proclaiming 
at once the admixture of foreign blood ’’! (Figs. 12,

makes the following 
comment on the old 
stamp of Cleveland 
Bay, just about the 
time the Thorough- 
bred was to be used 
most liberally : “Very

76 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
the winkers of the bridles and the trappings that adorn 
them, and their heads are borne up by the bearing rein, 
that they acquire the imposing appearance which, when 
well matched, so many of them possess. When stripped, 
a great proportion of them appear a very different sort of 
animal indeed, and, in all probability, a smaller and more 
compact sort of horse would go through double the 
quantity of work that they are capable of enduring. 
Fashion, however, is to be consulted by the breeder, 
to a certain extent; and, so long as he can obtain from 
job masters a large sum for a pair of these overgrown 
animals, he will do well to breed them without refer- 
ence to their being unequal in point of endurance to 
a smaller and better-formed sort of draft horse. It is 
generally supposed that a horse destined for harness 
. should not have a very oblique shoulder, as when so 
formed he is not capable of throwing so much of his weight 
into the collar as when his shoulders are more upright; 
but it must be remembered that grand and lofty action is 
highly prized in London for the purpose of show, and not 
for hard work, and hence a sloping shoulder is a point to 
be desired by the farmer who breeds carriage horses for 
the London market; for, as I have already observed, it 
is one which is mostly accompanied by high action.” 
In the latter part of the nineteenth century, after the 
organization of societies in the eighties, to promote this 
breed, the British public became interested in the horse 
to supplant oxen on the farm. At this time, too, the 
demand changed from a very heavy carriage horse to a 
lighter horse with more quality, more style and more 
coach or high action. The Cleveland had to veer one 
way or the other or become extinct. It is evident that it 
was changed towards the latter largely by the greater
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE HEAVY-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 7 
use of Thoroughbred blood, and that resulted in the type 
more commonly known by the name of the Yorkshire 
coach horse. To indicate the tendency of the change, the 
following extract from the Yorkshire Coach Stud-book 
will be of service: “It cannot be claimed for the York- 
shire coach horse that he is a pure-bred animal, but that, 
on the contrary, by the judicious crossing of large-sized 
good-colored mares with stallions altogether or nearly 
Thoroughbred, a class of horses has been produced suited 
to the wants and circumstances of the times. By univer- 
sal consent, the color should be bay or brown, with black 
eyes, mane and tail abundant but not curly, the height 
from sixteen hands to sixteen hands two inches, with 
fine head, sloping shoulders, strong loins, and lengthy 
quarters, high-stepping action, good sound feet, flat legs 
“and abundance of bone and muscle.” 
83. Uses of the Cleveland Bay horse. — Enough has 
been said to indicate the place of the Cleveland Bay as 
a coach horse. It has found some favor as a roadster, 
especially in England. These horses are very uniform 
in color and markings, and they are very prepotent in 
transmitting these characters when crossed on common 
mares. Because of this their get is uniform and easily 
matched into teams. Their size and power and dis- 
position adapt them for some of the work of the farm 
better than is the case with any of the other breeds of 
light horses; but, owing to their deficiency in quality 
and action, they have not been generally popular in Amer- 
ican horse-breeding districts. 
84. Distribution. — The Cleveland Bay horse has en- 
joyed some popularity, notably in South Africa. Aside 
from importations into America, the horse has been taken 
to South America, Australia and Sweden. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104

85. Organizations and records. — There are two stud- 
books in England, that of the Cleveland Bay Horse Society 
and that of the Coach Horse Society, devoted to the York- 
shire Coach. In 1885, the Cleveland Bay Horse Society 
of America was organized, which registers both ‘the 
Cleveland Bay and the Yorkshire Coach. The head- 
quarters of the society are in Aurora, Illinois. it has 
published two volumes of its stud-book.

THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 
Tue light-harness horse is rangy, long, light, angular, 
narrow and deep, that form which favors the longest, 
straightest stride, most rapidly done and frequently re- 
peated. The significance of the term has already been 
explained in the preceding chapter. 
Light-harness horses are used for road driving and 
harness racing and may be either trotters or pacers. -

86. The trotting horse has entered more largely into 
the pleasures and uses of the American people than any 
of the other classes of light horses, although the gaited 
saddle horse has been to some extent a competitor in 
these directions in recent years. For trotting purposes on 
the track or on the road, no other strain or breed has 
approached the American Standardbred trotter. Its 
development to the present excellence is due wholly to the 
work ‘of the American breeder, although most of the 
original material that entered into the foundation of the 
American Standardbred trotting horse came from outside 
sources.

80 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
87. Origin. — In common with all breeds of light horses, 
the American Standardbred horse (the writer uses the 
word “ breed ” advisedly, for he will show that our horses 
officially known under this name are as much entitled to 
it as any other) traces back through the Thoroughbred to 
the Arab. The Arab is the original source of the Thorough- 
bred, and nearly every breed of light horses worthy of note 
has drawn so largely on these two that it makes the 
Darley Arabian, the Byerly Turk and the Godolphin 
Barb the triune root of all of them. [See the articles 
on the Thoroughbred, the Arab, and the Barb and the 
. Turk.] 
Previous to the advent of these Eastern importations, 
racing had not attracted much public patronage in Great 
Britain. A writer! refers to the time of their advent as 
_ follows: Byerly Turk, about 1689; Darley Arabian, early 
in the eighteenth century; Godolphin Arabian (probably 
a Barb), 1728. Trotting matches seem then to have been 
unknown, but it was about that time that marked the era 
of running races. In 1751, Reginald Heber published the 
first number of the Racing Calendar, and the light-horse 
breeding interests of Great Britain began to assume 
noticeable proportions. 
The Darley Arabian sired the first great Thoroughbred 
or running horse in Flying Childers. While Flying 
Childers was a stout race horse, yet it was through his 
brother, Bartlett’s Childers, progenitor of Eclipse, that 
the most turf performers trace. Flying Childers sired 
Blaze, foaled in 1733, whose pedigree is given very com- 
pletely by Captain Urton (Newmarket and Arabia). 
This pedigree shows that Blaze was deeply bred in Orien- 
tal blood lines, and yet from him it seems a little stream

THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 81 
of trotting blood emanates, which history pronounces to 
be the most ancient source of two modern breeds, — the 
American Standardbred horse and the Hackney. Per- 
haps the chief notoriety of Blaze in Thoroughbred circles 
was attained through his being the sire of the dam of 
Herod. He also had two sons of interest in this discus- 
sion, namely, Sampson and Shales. Sampson shows a 
deviation in type from other Thoroughbreds of the time, 
being considered a very large horse, 15.2 hands high, and 
said to be the largest-boned Thoroughbred horse ever bred. 
He was a noted and proved race horse. He sired Engineer, 
sire of Mambrino, sire of Messenger. He was also the 
grandsire of the dam of Useful Cub, that trotted seven- 
teen miles in less than an hour. Shales, the other son of 
Blaze, sired Driver and Scott’s Shales, both of which were 
trotters, and considered by careful investigators to be 
pillars of the Hackney. 
88. Influence of Messenger.— Messenger was im- 
ported in 1788. His line is an unbroken series of trotters. 
He sired Mambrino, which had about a dozen trotting 
sons, in three of which we are chiefly interested: Mam- 
brino, Bishop’s Hambletonian and the mare Silvertail. 
Mambrino sired Mambrino Paymaster, and Abdallah, the 
former the sire of Mambrino Chief, founder of the family 
of that name among Standardbred horses. Abdallah sired 
Hambletonian 10, the founder of the Hambletonian family 
in the Standardbred breed. Silvertail was the dam of 
One Eye, the dam of the Charles Kent mare; and this 
mare was by Imported Bellfounder, which traces back 
through the Fireaways to Driver, the son of Shales, the 
son of Blaze. To get all this clear, the following chart is 
"submitted :

With the advent of Messenger, the trotting instinct 
becomes decidedly more pronounced. The chief feature 
of his pedigree is that he was not only a Thoroughbred, 
but dips deep into the fountain sources of that breed. 
The records are pregnant with the performances of his 
progeny and also attest to his value as a progenitor of 
trotting speed, through the get of his sons, and the degree 
to which their blood permeates the pedigrees of even our 
most notable of modern trotters. In the catalogue of 
the International Stock Food Farm, there appears an ex- 
ceptionally erudite pedigree of Dan Patch 1:554, the 
champion pacer of the world, and it is shown that he traces 
forty-three times to Messenger. The first noted per- 
former of this strain was Topgallant. Paul Pry, a grand- 
son of Messenger, was ridden by Woodruff 18 miles in a 
fraction less than 57 minutes. Lady Suffolk began racing 
   
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 83 
in public in 1838, and for fifteen years raced the most 
successful trotters off her time. The almost equally famous 
mare, Green Mountain Maid (not to be confused with the 
mare of the same name that was Electioneer’s dam), and 
Princess, another notable campaigner, were of this blood. 
Happy Medium might also be said to be an inbred Mes- 
senger. When we consider that his daughter, Nancy 
. Hanks, 2:04, was out of Nancy Lee by Dictator by Ham- 
bletonian 10, it is easy to understand how deeply bred this 
remarkable trotter of our day embodies Messenger blood. 
Before taking up-the influence of other Thoroughbred 
sources, there are other scattering streams of Messenger 
blood that should be mentioned. The Clay family, 
through the founder, Henry Clay, has a very distant in- 
fusion. The Morgan family, also, has a considerable 
infusion of Messenger blood. Among the old Canadian 
families having Messenger blood, one of the most promi- 
nent is that of Royal George 9. Royal George’s descend- 
ants to-day bear out the fact that the Messenger family 
was the most prolific source of trotting speed in Canada. 
Another Canadian family that runs into some of our best 
Standardbreds originated in the Bullock horse, which 
traces directly to Messenger. Strathmore 408, the 
founder of one of the very best families of the Standard- 
bred trotter, carried much Messenger blood. 
These references, showing the infusion of Messenger 
blood into the families of Mambrino Chief II, Hamble- 
tonian 10, Morgan, Clay and others, will enable one to 
form some idea of the degree to which Messenger blood 
forms a widespread foundation for the present Standard- 
bred trotter. 
89. Other important contributors. — Besides Messenger, 
several other imported Thoroughbreds have contributed 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
       84 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
to the breeding of the Standardbred trotter. Suffice it 
to mention Bonnie Scotland, Australian Trustee, Lapidis 
and Glencoe. The influence of these was chiefly through 
their American-bred sons and daughters. 
90. Influence of American horses. — Let us now con- 
sider the status of the horses in use on this continent as 
road horses or trotters, about the time (1788) that Mes- 
senger was imported. In the earliest colonial days, most 
of the traveling was done on horseback, and a race most 
popular for journeying this way was the Narragansett 
pacer, bred most largely in Rhode Island. In addition, 
this pacer was the racing horse of the people of Rhode 
Island and Virginia as early as the last of the seventeenth 
century. Dr. McMonagle states: “The combination of 
these (Narragansett) with the French stock imported 
from France to Quebec, in 1665, produced the Canadian 
pacers. Out of that combination we have the Pilots, 
which were taken to Kentucky and proved to be the pro- 
ducers of some of the best trotting horses there. From 
the same stock we have the Columbuses, which were taken 
to Vermont, where they produced trotters of which the 
fastest went in 2: 19% — a daughter of Phil Sheridan, the 
most potent sire of the family.” It seems clear to the 
above writer that the Narragansett pacer was chiefly the 
original source of the Canadian blood so largely taken to 
Kentucky and other states at an early day. 
Justin Morgan, the founder of the family of that name, 
was foaled in 1793 (some authorities give it 1789), and 
Pilot, about the first to attract the attention of the Ameri- 
can public, was foaled about 1826. The Pilots, St. Law- 
rences, St. Clairs, Columbuses and Copperbottoms were 
taken from Canada at the beginning of the last century to 
Vermont, New York, Kentucky, California and other 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 85 
states that were trotting-horse centers at that early day, 
and blended well with the other families that were form- 
ing. The Morgans were well under way at this era. The 
three sons that formed leading branches of the family were 
Sherman, foaled in 1809, Bulrush, foaled in 1812, and 
Woodbury, foaled in 1816. Then, too, the Bashaws and 
the Clays were starting under way; for Grand Bashaw 
was imported in 1820. He sired Andrew Jackson, foaled 
in 1728, which, in turn, sired Henry Clay and Long Island 
Black Hawk, both foaled in 1837. The latter sired Green’s 
Bashaw in 1855. Andrew Jackson ranked and was con- 
temporaneous with Abdallah, the latter being foaled in 
1823. A little later Mambrino Chief 11 was foaled in 
1844, and five years later, in 1849, Hambletonian 10 was 
born. 
It is seen that about the middle of the past century 
the leading families of the Standardbred trotter had their 
inception, and the breed began to assume formation on 
this continent, for the chief families, the Canadian Pilots 
and others of that nationality, the Morgans, the Clays, 
the Mambrino Chiefs and the Hambletonians, were mak- 
ing it evident that there were certain blood lines more 
prolific than others in producing trotting speed. 
91. Early trotting records. — The first trotting per- 
formance in America of which we have record is that of 
Yankee, at Harlem, New York, July 6, 1806, when a little 
less than a mile was trotted in 2:50. In 1859, Ethan Allen, 
of the Morgan line, trotted against Flora Temple, when 
the latter trotted a mile in 2:25. In the same year, 
George M. Patchen beat Ethan Allen in 2:24, and in 
turn was beaten by Flora Temple in 2:21. Dexter, which 
began his racing career in 1864, defeated George Wilkes 
in 2:223. According to official records, Lady Suffolk  
-P-A-G-E-114
  86 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
was the first to trot below 2:30, in 1845, when she won 
a heat in a race in 2:293; Pelham, breeding unknown, 
in 1849 reduced this to 2 : 28 ; Highland Man, of Thorough- 
bred breeding, in 1853 reduced it to 2:27; Flora Temple 
reduced this several times, finally bringing it, in 1859, to 
2:192; in 1867, Dexter reduced it to 2:17}; and then 
Goldsmith Maid continued lowering it until 1874, when, 
going against time, she made a mile in 2: 14. 
92. The trotting register.— About this time the 
greatest interest was being taken in trotting races and ° 
trotting families, and it was further added to by the found- 
ing and compiling of the American Trotting Register by 
John Henry Wallace, which was begun about 1865. Wal- 
lace’s Monthly and the Yearbook also gave a great im- 
petus to the study of the pedigrees of the Standardbred 
horse, and out of the racing and the data collected grew 
the enthusiasm for better breeding. 
It was not until Volume IV of the Trotting Register 
was published that the entries’ of stallions were made 
numerically. For that volume a standard was prepared 
in which performance was given precedence and pedigree 
a minor place. Under this standard, Volumes IV to VII, 
inclusive, were compiled. Various changes were made, | 
from time to time, until we now have the following stand- 
ard, as revised and adopted by the American Trotting 
Register Association, to take effect November 1, 1898: 
“When an animal meets these requirements and is 
duly registered, it shall be accepted as a Standardbred 
trotter. 
“(1) The progeny of a registered standard trotting 
horse and a registered standard trotting mare. 
“(2) A stallion sired by a registered standard trotting 
horse, provided his dam and granddam were sired by 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
   ‘HE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 87 
registered standard trotting horses, and he himself has a 
trotting record of 2:30 and is the sire of three trotters 
with records of 2:30 from different mares. 
“ (3) A mare whose sire is a registered standard trotting 
horse and whose dam and granddam were sired by regis- 
tered standard trotting horses, provided she herself has a 
trotting record of 2: 30 or is the dam of one trotter with a 
record of 2:30. : , 
““(4) A mare sired by a registered standard trotting 
horse, provided she is the dam of two trotters with records 
of 2:30. , ; 
(5) A mare sired by a registered standard trotting 
horse, provided her first, second and third dams are each 
sired by a registered standard trotting horse.” 
To assist still further in the establishment of a breed, 
the Register Association has made known (February 5, 
1908) a contemplated change in the requirements for 
admission to the standard, looking to the elimination of 
all the foregoing rules except rule number one. 
93. Influence of the standard. — At first, the impor- 
tance of the standard, both as to performance and pedi- 
gree, had an undue influence. If a horse was standard it 
was thought that that was all that was necessary, and if a 
sire succeeded in piling up a large 2: 30 list that was later 
considered the sum total. Now breeders are also con- 
sidering the fact that a performance of 2:30, with im- 
proved tracks, sulkies and appliances, does not mean 
much, and they are considering the amount of extreme 
speed as a very desirable quality, with a long line of pro- 
ducing lineage in the pedigree. At this point, the impor- 
tance of the breeding of the dam and her value as a . 
producer of speed entered into the operations of most breed- 
ing farms. In conjunction with this, the money-making
-P-A-G-E-116
  88 | THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
value of colt trotters, because of the large stakes, began to 
receive more attention. Breeders also began to find out 
that a horse might be a fine “looker” and at the same 
time a good race horse or a getter of fine “ lookers ” and 
race horses. 
This brings us down to the present era, during which 
the modern breeder seeks performance, individuality and 
pedigree, and it is all traceable to the several stages of 
evolution through which the breed has gone. To guide 
the beginner in breeding, it may be said that nearly all 
the families must necessarily be embraced in up-to-date 
breeding operations, for the history of the breed will show 
that they nearly all have desirable qualities that should 
be apparent in the modern representation of the Standard- 
bred horse. 
94. Families.— The origin and importance of the 
heads of the several prominent trotting families has been 
discussed above. It remains only to call attention to the 
notable horses of each family. 
95. The Hambletonian family, through the male 
line, includes the following sons of Hambletonian 10, 
(1) Electioneer, the sire of many producing sons. In 
summing up the standing of the families in regard to the 
production of colt trotters, Volunteer, in a very able tab- 
ulation,’ gives Electioneer second place to George Wilkes, 
with thirty-three sires and seventy-one performers. 
(2) George Wilkes, the sire of many notable producing 
sons and the champion trotting stallion, in 1868-71. Inthe 
production of colt trotters, Volunteer gives this sire first 
place, with forty-seven sires and ninety-eight performers. 
(8) Abdallah 15, and sire of many notable producing 
sons. Nutwood, son of Abdallah, leads all other sires as 
1 Horse Review, January 28, 1908.
-P-A-G-E-117
THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 89 
sire of producing brood mares. This line has been notable 
for the production of campaigners and race horses rather 
than for colt trotters, although Volunteer ranks it among 
Hambletonian 10’s sons, with ten sires and sixteen per- 
formers. Goldsmith Maid, 2:16$, of this strain, the 
champion trotter in 1871-72, and again in 1874, when she 
reduced her record to 2:14, has been conceded ’to be the 
greatest campaigner of any time. 
(4) Happy Medium, ranks seventh among Hamble- 
tonian 10’s sons, with two sires and six performers. 
(5) Dictator... In the production of colt trotters, the 
writer, Volunteer, in reference already given, places Dictator 
fourth as his rank among the sons of Hambletonian 10, 
with six sires and sixteen performers. 
(6) Strathmore. This line ranks very high in producing 
brood mares. 
Among other noted sons of Hambletonian 10 are Egbert, 
Aberdeen, Harold (sire of Maud S, 2: 08%, champion 
trotter 1883-5, and sire of Lord Russell, sire of Kremlin, 
2:08%, champion stallion in 1892); Volunteer (sire of 
St. Julien, 2:114, champion trotter in 1880); Jay 
Gould, champion stallion in 1871-2. The Hambletonian 
family as a whole is given first place by Volunteer for 
siring colt trotters, with 106 sires of 223 performers to its 
credit. 
96. The Mambrino chief family, through the male line, 
includes the following sons of Mambrino Chief IJ. 
(1) Woodford Mambrino. A striking feature of this 
line is the purity of the trotting gait, for there are but few 
pacers among them. 
(2) Mambrino Patchen. This line has a reputation, to 
which it is entitled, for having in its ranks a large num- 
ber of producing brood mares. Many noted stallions, 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
90 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
sons of George Wilkes, have Mambrino Patchen dams, a 
blend that has been prolific in speed. 
(3) Clark Chief. 
(4) Mambrino Pilot. 
97. The Clay family is generally considered to start 
with Henry Clay, but it really traces back through the 
male line to Grand Bashaw, imported in 1820 from Tripoli. 
The latter was fourteen and one-fourth hands high, but 
was reputed to be a horse of beauty and some speed for 
those early days. Grand Bashaw was bred to Pearl by 
First Consul out of Fancy by Messenger, and from this 
union resulted Young Bashaw, the sire of Andrew Jack- 
son. Andrew Jackson was a trotter of note in his day, 
especially as a two-miler. The Long Island Black Hawk 
line has given us Bashaw 50, and Wapsie. Bashaw 50 is 
the sire of the dam of Joe Young, 2:18. Henry Clay 
sired Cassius M. Clay 18, which sired George M. Patchen, 
2:23}, champion trotting stallion in 1859-60, and sire of 
four trotters. Perhaps the most prolific speed line comes 
through Cassius M. Clay 20, a son of Cassius M. Clay 
18, for Harry Clay, 2:29, with four trotters in the list 
and sire of the dam of Electioneer, is by C. M. Clay 20, and 
Clay Pilot is also by the latter. This family attains its 
notoriety most largely through the remarkably great brood 
mares that are of this descent, among which may be men- 
‘tioned Green Mountain Maid (by Harry Clay), dam of 
nine trotters, including Electioneer and Beautiful Bells, 
dam of eleven trotters and eight producing sires. 
98. The Morgan family takes its name from Justin 
Morgan by True Briton by Imported Traveller by Mor- 
ton’s Traveller, which traces in near and direct lines to 
the Byerly Turk, Curwen’s Bay Barb, the Lowther Barb, 
Bloody Buttocks and the Godolphin Arabian. In his
-P-A-G-E-119
  
\ 
/ THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 91 
book, published in 1857, D. ©. Lindsley describes Justin 
Morgan as about fourteen hands high and weighing 950 
pounds. His color was dark bay, with black points. He 
was a very stylish horse, of indomitable, though easily 
controllable spirit. The three sons of Justin Morgan 
that were most prolific as sources of trotters were Sher- 
man, Woodbury and Bulrush. Sherman sired Black 
Hawk 5; the sire of Ethan Allen, 2: 28, champion trotting 
stallion in 1858. Ethan Allen sired Daniel Lambert. 
Black Hawk 5 also sired King Herod, sire of Herod, 2 : 244. 
From the Bulrush line comes Old Morrill, sire of Young 
Morrill, sire of Winthrop Morrill. The other son of 
Justin Morgan, namely, Woodbury, sired Morgan Eagle, 
whose son of the same name got Magna Charta. Woodbury 
also sired Barnard Morgan, which in turn sired Vermont 
Morgan, sire of Golddust, the founder of that strain. The 
fastest trotters of the Morgan line include Lord Clinton, 
2: 08%, Lamp Girl and Ethel Downs. 
While the Morgan family has produced considerable 
speed, yet its popularity is based chiefly on the endurance, 
beauty and style of its members (Plate IV). Pacers are 
exceptionally rare among them, and the purity of their action 
being bold, free and tireless, is perhaps the most valuable 
attribute of thefamily. ‘In this connection, itmay be stated 
that the government, having recognized the tractable and 
energetic disposition of the Morgans, as well as their 
well-established reputation for endurance, has established 
a breeding station in Vermont in coéperation with the 
Vermont Agricultural Experiment Station, with the object 
of “saving the Morgan.” This stud is headed by the 
stallion General Gates by Denning Allen (the sire of Lord 
Clinton 2: 08%) and out of a Thoroughbred mare. Car- 
mon, the stallion at the head of the stud at Fort Collins,
-P-A-G-E-120
  92 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Colorado, in the efforts to establish a breed of American 
carriage horses, carries some Morgan blood. 
The blood of the Morgan horse has become rather 
widely scattered over America, although there are com- 
paratively few Morgans available. Most of these are 
found in New England and other eastern states, although 
there are pure-blooded Morgans in parts of Iowa, Indiana, 
Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri. The American:Morgan 
Horse Register is published at Middlebury, Vermont. 
99. The Pilot family takes its name from old Pilot, a 
Canadian pacer from near Montreal, afterwards trained 
at both gaits. After passing through many hands and 
sojourning in Connecticut, New York, and Louisiana, he 
reached Kentucky in 1832. There he sired Pilot Jr., out 
of a mare of Thoroughbred breeding. He sired eight 
trotters in the list, but his blood was chiefly valuable 
through the female line because of the number of great 
brood mares he sired. Among the brood mares sired by 
Pilot Jr., Miss Russell is most noted. 
100. Other’ families. — In addition to the foregoing 
recognized families, there are a number of others that have 
been very aptly termed the submerged families. Many 
of these are of Thoroughbred origin, but they are mostly 
descended from Canadian pacers. Among those of 
Thoroughbred breeding are American Star 14, sire of the 
dams of Guy, 2: 091, Dexter, 2: 174, Robert McGregor, 
2:173, Aberdeen and other noted sires. The Canadian 
pacing families are discussed in more detail in the history 
of the Standardbred pacing horse. 
101. Description. — There are many pronounced types 
among the Standardbred trotting horses (Plate III). Some 
are speed marvels, as Lou Dillon, slim, graceful and of high 
nervous organization: others are of the campaigner type,
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 93 
stronger-framed, fuller-muscled, of larger size, with control- 
lable dispoSition, so as to be easily rated, and of remarkable 
strength and durability.—Of such is Sweet Marie. The 
most successfut blend-of these two types is Cresceus, both 
a speed marvel and a campaigner. A pen description 
of him would embody the attributes of the best 
type so far evolved. In general, such a horse should be 
about sixteen hands high, upstanding, well set up, and 
have that poise of body which horsemen refer to when 
they say a horse is “ above himself,” either standing or in 
action. The head, proportioned evenly with the other 
parts, is clean-cut and carried high. The neck has length 
and is muscular, making a noticeable crest in the stallion. 
The shoulder is deep, covered with muscle, and the chest 
is low and only moderately wide. The fore-leg is long 
from elbow to knee, and short from knee to fetlock. The 
knee is wide in front and sharp behind, and the tendon 
drops from there almost vertically to the pastern. The 
pasterns slope nicely, and the feet, both before and behind, 
are even in size, moderately large, and of a healthy, oily 
color. The back is well covered with muscle and is round- 
ing, and the swelling muscles of the loin cause it to rise 
slightly ; those of the hindquarters make the croup plump 
and the quarters full and deep. The leg is long from hip 
point to hock, and short from there to the pastern. The 
web of the hock is thin and the leg below decidedly fluted. 
The action should be clean, quick and frictionless. Above 
all, the disposition should be easily controllable, and yet 
ever ready to race with zest. Good weights are 900 
pounds for a mare and perhaps 1150 pounds for a stallion. 
The color is not fixed, but brown and bay are very common. ~ 
102. Uses for racing.— The Standardbred ‘trotter 
occupies a position about equally divided between pleas-  
-P-A-G-E-122
  94 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
ure and utility. The degree to which the trotter'em- 
braces the former field depends on the popularity of racing, 
both in the circuits and for matinée purposes. Trotting 
races are an adjunct of nearly every county fair, and 
occupy a prominent position at all state fairs. However 
much the attendant gambling may be deplored, the fact 
remains that trotting and pacing races are popular, and 
they also assist in developing a speedier and more durable 
breed of horses. The racing is under the jurisdiction of 
the National Trotting Association and the American 
Trotting Register Association, the rules governing the 
races, under the auspices of either, being almost identical ; 
and they prevail at all race meetings and on all tracks 
over which officially accepted records are made. 
After having finished their racing career and having 
lowered their records so that their money-winning capacity 
is reduced, many trotters are purchased for matinée racing 
in our larger cities. This sport has grown in popularity to 
such an extent that a National League of Amateur Driving 
Clubs has been formed. 
103. Use as a roadster. — It is as a roadster that the 
trotting-bred horse is most useful. This demands a horse 
of medium height, 15.2 to 16 hands, of graceful lines, 
without the least tendency to coarseness in any part. 
Quality of bone, cleanness of limbs, defined tendons and 
all other characteristics that forecast durability, should 
be very much in evidence. With it all there is a refine- 
ment of form that differentiates this type from the coach 
or heavy-harness class. Easy, elastic action and an ever- 
present willingness to cover the ground in jaunty style 
are desirable characteristics. At an early day, the 
Thoroughbred was recommended strongly for crossing on 
common light mares, and such breeding resulted, in many
-P-A-G-E-123
   THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 95 
instances, in roadsters noted for their ability to cover long 
distances at the trot, and to continue it day after day. 
The Morgan horse, however, was soon recognized as the 
strain possessing the highest type of roadster characteris- 
tics, chiefly because of its indomitable perseverance and 
endurance, its willingness, and the style and buoyance 
with which it stood the strain of continuous road riding. 
The roadster, in addition to having style, action and dur- 
able individuality, must be in type in harmony with the 
light harness and light, easy-running road rigs now popu- 
lar. A heavy, slow, but maybe stylish-moving horse is 
as much out of place before a road rig as a slim racer-like 
horse would be in heavy harness. While there are many 
speedy trotters that are far from pleasurable road horses, 
because the ability to go fast for a short. distance is not 
the chief requirement of a road horse, yet the result of 
the continuous racing which the trotter has undergone, 
undoubtedly has given it the durability and the “do or 
die” spirit that is a valuable attribute of the roadster. At 
this day some speed is required of the roadster. 
104. Use as heavy-harness horse. — Of more recent 
years, attention has been drawn to the fact that some 
families of the American Standardbred horse have shown 
marked excellence for heavy-harness use. During the 
time when the horse-shows were perhaps most popular, 
about 1890, the breeding of the trotting horse was under 
a depression. For that reason, many stallions, well bred 
in trotting lines but of heavy-harness conformation and 
action, were purchased at gelding prices and shown in 
heavy harness classes at the leading horse-shows. Un- 
doubtedly they may properly be called freaks, for they 
were not bred for this purpose, but that does not dispose 
of the worth of the acquisition. The trotting-bred heavy-
-P-A-G-E-124
  96 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
harness horse and high stepper became a strong competi- 
tor of the Hackney, and in some instances defeated the 
latter in these classes. The result was that the govern- 
ment realized the possibility of establishing a family or, in 
time, a breed of heavy-harness horses as an offshoot of the 
Standardbred trotter. The Colorado Experiment Station 
conducted the work under the auspices of the Department 
of Agriculture at Washington. Carmon 32917, a grandson 
of Robert McGregor, 2: 173, is at the head of the stud. 
Previous to purchase by the government, he had been a 
prominent winner at leading horse-shows in the harness 
classes under the name of Glorious Thunder Cloud. 
105. Use for breeding “ cow ponies.”’ — At this point, 
to indicate further the versatility of the Standardbred 
trotter, it will not be out of place to mention the fact 
that on many of the large cattle ranches, where “‘ cow 
ponies,” as they are called, are in heavy demand, the 
Standardbred trotter is being used as a sire in preferencé 
to the Thoroughbred. The reason for this preference was 
given the writer to be the better disposition of the Stand- 
ardbred as compared with the Thoroughbred, said to be a 
result of the restraint under which the trotting horse has 
been held, and the necessity of a trotter having a control- 
lable disposition. 
106. Distribution. — Other governments have recognized 
the worth of the Standardbred trotter, for recently those of 
Japan and China have made large importations. Exten- 
sive sales of Standardbred trotters of high merit have 
been made to prominent horse-lovers and breeders in 
Russia, France, Austria, Italy, Germany, England, Aus- 
tralia and the South American countries. 
107. Organizations and records. — The National Trot- 
ting Association was organized in 1870. The office of the
-P-A-G-E-125
     THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 97 
present secretary is at Hartford, Conn. The American 
Trotting Association was organized in 1887, and has head- 
quarters in Chicago. The American Trotting Register 
appeared in 1868, with J. H. Wallace as publisher. The 
first volume contained some 3000 entries ; 62,000 stallions 
and about 250,000 mares have been registered to date. 
Wallace also established the Yearbook, now in its thirtieth 
volume. The Register, the Yearbook, and Wallace’s 
Monthly were disposed of by Mr. Wallace to the American 
Trotting Register Association, in 1891, and the latter now 
publishes the Register and the Yearbook. As has been 
said, a League of Amateur Driving Clubs has been formed, 
with headquarters in Boston. This league publishes a 
yearbook, giving a summary of matinée races and the 
time made. The first volume includes the races of 1901-2. 
Tue Pactnc Horse. Fig. 14.

108. The pacer is not a separate and distinct breed of 
horses. The name is applied to a class of horses that are 
characterized by the pacing gait. The American Stand- 
ardbred trotting horse breed is the most potent source of 
pacers. 
109. History in Europe. — From the earliest writings 
referring to horses and from the earliest representations 
of them in sculptured frieze, we learn that pacing or 
ambling was a gait common to the horse in earliest times. 
This gait is shown in Greek sculpture and referred to in 
the publications of some of the earliest writers in Spain, 
Great Britain and America. It is unnecessary here to 
recount these early references, for they are accessible in 
H
-P-A-G-E-126
98 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
nearly every work devoted to the horse; and it is equally 
unnecessary to attempt to locate the origin of the gait, 
for there is no feature connected with the history of the 
horse that depends more on legendary lore than this. 
Suffice it to say that in Spain, where the saddle horse as a 
pack animal and for traveling was much in vogue, the 
pacing or ambling gait was considered a very necessary 
attribute; and the same is true in perhaps a lesser degree 
when the early history of the pacer in Great Britain is 
considered. 
110. History in America. — It is in America in colonial , 
days that the pacer in’ the New England states seemed to 
reach the highest point of utility; from there and from 
Canada the pacer seems to have spread. The Narragan- 
sett pacer of Rhode Island attained a wide notoriety over. 
the New England states in colonial times, but with the 
improvement of roads and the abandonment of horse- 
back riding for long-distance’ traveling, this strain became 
extinct. Whether or not it drifted over into Canada and 
formed the foundation for the remarkable number of 
pacers common to the Province of Quebec, is not definitely 
known, nor is there any other satisfactory supposition as to 
the origin of the Canadian pacing families. It would 
seem more plausible to account for the Canadian pacers 
in this way than to accredit them to French origin, for 
they were very dissimilar to the French horses of that 
time in their characteristics. 
The theory that the French-Canadian pacer is an off- 
shoot of the Thoroughbred has also been advanced and in 
some instances it may be proved, but in most instances 
the originator of the strain was by a Thoroughbred out 
of a pacing mare. Again, it has been asserted that the 
French-Canadian horse is a descendant of the French
-P-A-G-E-127
     THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 99 
Percheron, reduced in size by the more rigorous conditions 
of climate. This seems to the writer the most untenable 
of all the theories. Long observation of the more com- 
mon types prevalent among the French-Canadian people, 
and attendance at their winter ice-racing, where the 
most of those with speed would congregate, substan- 
tiate the writer’s opinion. In all its characteristics the 
French-Canadian comes nearer the Morgan in some traits 
and nearer the Thoroughbred in others, than those of any 
other breed or family. While like the Morgan in type 
and style of going when trotting, yet it must be admitted 
there are very few pacers among the Morgans. Also, not 
many of the Thoroughbreds pace unless there is a strain 
of pacing through the dam’s side. The French-Canadian 
families, especially those showing inclinations to pace, 
although most of them were double-gaited, have in time 
become submerged in the foundation of other families 
which are now of most prominence. Among the Canadian 
families of early origin, the most noted spring from Copper- 
bottom, Pilot, Daniel Boone, Drennon, Davy Crockett, 
Corbeau, St. Lawrence, St. Clair. Of those of more dis- 
tinctly Thoroughbred origin, might be mentioned Smug- 
gler, Clear Grit, Uwharie and Hiatogas, while perhaps the 
two most noted of all, the Hals, springing from Tom Hal 
in Tennessee and Blue Bull in Indiana, had their origin’ 
so shrouded in misty legend that it is not even advisable 
to speculate on it. From all that we know, it may be safe 
to assume that the Thoroughbred horse has had as much 
to do with the evolution of the pacer as any other up to 
the time of the introduction of the standards, although 
we have to admit that there seems to have been an original 
stock on which the Thoroughbred, ‘as a scion, was grafted 
with more or less success.

The Copperbottoms and Pilots made a reputation in 
Kentucky at an early time; the Columbus family did 
the same in New England, the St. Clairs in California, 
the St. Lawrences in Michigan, the Blue Bulls in Indiana 
and Ohio, the Hiatogas in Virginia, and the Hals in 
Tennessee. While all these were in a general way known 
as pacers, yet with most of them the gait was interchange- 
able, and many of them could trot as fast as they could 
pace, and very few of them sired a majority of pacers. 
As might be expected, the fastest of their get were pacers, 
and those made the reputation of the sire, while as a 
matter of fact that sire would be getting mostly trotters. 
For example, Blue Bull, a fast pacer himself and a getter 
of some fast pacers, sired fifty-six trotters out of a total of 
sixty of his in the list. So also with many of the others, 
with the notable exception of the Hal family. This is the 
leading family of pacers that is justly entitled to be called 
a family of pacers, and the writer does not know of any 
other like it, pacing in origin and breeding on at the pac- 
ing gait. 
111. Present position of the pacer.— What has been 
written may enable the reader to understand the position 
of the pacer in the earliest days. But to explain the posi- 
tion in our own day is almost beyond the possibilities of 
the most earnest student, so intertwined in breeding and 
development are the trotting and pacing gaits. When 
the standard for Standardbred horses was established, 
pacers and trotters came in on almost equal footing. At 
the races, too, trotters and pacers at that time mostly 
competed on equal footing, many of the purses being open- 
class for trotters or pacers. It was soon found that the 
pacers were naturally ‘faster than the trotters, for they 
rs would win most of the races when both competed on 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 101 
equal footing. The craze for speed and the desire to put 
the get of stallions in the list, increased the popularity of 
the pacer at a bound. 
It was found, too, that it was a very easy matter to 
change the gait of most horses from trotting to pacing, 
especially with the use of hobbles or hopples, as they are 
interchangeaply designated. This leads us to say that 
the difference in the gaits is simply that in the pacer the 
two legs on the same side move together, while in the 
trotter the movement is diagonal. By putting a horse 
in hobbles, he must either pace or break the hobbles, 
which are so strong as to be almost unbreakable, or be 
thrown. Hobbles have been permitted in races, but 
owing to the danger to the driver if any entanglement 
occurs, they have not become popular except to keep 
horses that show a tendency to pace at that gait or train 
them until they can do without them. At its meeting on 
February 5, 1908, the American Trotting Register Asso- 
ciation adopted a resolution against the use of hobbles. 
It was found that a change in the shoeing, such as shoeing 
very light all round, would encourage a horse to pace; 
and even the shifting of the bit may accomplish the 
same purpose. 
After the craze for speed at any cost had subsided some- 
what, and a different time limit been set for the pacer 
before he could become standard, the winnings possible 
for green trotters increased, and with that the purses and 
colt stakes for trotters were augmented so that trotting as 
a part of the sport of racing became again more than on a 
par with pacing. ‘The pacing standard now in force is 
appended. It should be said that it is identical with the 
trotting standard except that the word “ pacer”’ is sub- 
stituted for the word “ trotter ” and the word “ pacing ”
-P-A-G-E-130
102 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
for the word “ trotting,” and the speed standard is changed 
from 2:30 to 2:25; furthermore, Rule 6 is an addition. 
112. The pacing standard. — “ When an animal meets 
these requirements and is duly registered, it shall be ac- 
cepted as a Standardbred pacer : 
“ (1) The progeny of a registered standard pacing horse 
and a registered standard pacing mare. 
“ (2) Any stallion sired by a registered standard pacing 
horse, provided his dam and granddam were sired by 
registered standard pacing horses and he himself has a 
pacing record of 2: 25 and is the sire of three pacers with 
records of 2: 25 from different mares. 
“(3) A mare whose sire is a registered standard pacing 
horse and whose dam and granddam were sired by regis- 
tered standard pacing horses, provided she herself has a 
pacing record of 2: 25 or is the dam of one pacer with a 
record of 2: 25. ‘ 
“ (4) A mare sired by a registered standard pacing horse, 
provided she is the dam of two pacers with records of 
2:25. 
“(5) A mare sired by a registered standard pacing 
horse, provided her first, second and third dams are each 
sired by a registered standard pacing horse. 
“(6) The progeny of a registered standard trotting 
horse out of a registered standard pacing mare, or of a 
registered standard pacing horse out of a registered stand- 
ard trotting mare.” 
118. Families.— Among the modern Standardbred 
horses it is not possible to separate the families into those 
that pace as a family characteristic, and those that trot. 
The Hal family is composed most distinctly of pacers, 
for Tom Hal Jr. has fourteen in the list, all pacers, while 
Brown Hal, one son, has seventy-eight, all pacers. The
-P-A-G-E-131
  
THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 1038 
latter has two noted sons, Star Pointer, with fifteen in 
the list, all pacers, and Hal Dillard, with forty-two in the 
list, only three of which are pacers. In some instances 
there is a union of one of the leading families with the Hal 
strain which produces pacers consistently. For instance, 
Direct, 2: 053, of the Dictator family is a pacer and has 
sired forty-two pacers and _ thirty-seven trotters. He 
sired Direct Hal p., 2:044, a leading sire of pacers, 
and a most successful campaigner. While some of the 
families of Standardbreds show a stronger tendency to 
trot than to pace, the reverse is not common, although it 
is possible that in time this may result, as it is ostensibly 
the aim to establish two separate standards. The cham- 
pion pacing stallion, Dan Patch, 1: 55%, is sired by 
Joe Patchen, a noted race horse and a pacer, sired 
by Patchen Wilkes of the George Wilkes-Mambrino- 
Patchen cross; and the dam of Joe Patchen was by Joe 
Young of Morgan breeding. The dam of Dan Patch was 
Zelicia by Wilkesberry, which was a Wilkes on his sire’s 
side and a Clay on his dam’s. There is very little of 
“what might be called pacing blood in her pedigree, although 
the Wilkes strain and the Abdallah 15 strain have pro- 
duced many fast pacers. On the other hand, Lou Dillon, 
a champion trotter, 1:584, comes as near being of a 
pacing line through her sire as almost any noteworthy 
pacer. At present it does not seem likely that the 
pacing families will become separate from the trotting 
families. 
114. Description. — It was a prevalent opinion some 
years ago that there was a type evolving among pacers, 
but this has been largely dispelled. Dan Patch (Fig. 14) 
is as smooth and graceful in line of mold as it would be 
possible to conceive an ideal, and Joe Patchen is con-

sidered among horse-lovers, no matter what their prefer- 
ence as to breed, as being very nearly a model in finish, 
symmetry and style. So many old-time pacers were 
steep in the hindquarters and some crooked in the hocks 
and pitched forward, that it became the opinion of a co- 
terie that a pacing type 
was. being evolved. 
Time demonstrated 
with the pacer as 
with the trotter, that 
symmetry and grace- 
ful lines and _ style 
in action or repose 
were not opposed to 
speed. 
115. Uses of the 
pacer. — For racing 
purposes the pacer 
Fic. 14.— Standardbred pacing stallion. cannot be said to 
  equal the trotter as a 
money-maker, as the purses are not generally so large; 
and the colt stakes for the trotters are also large. For 
road purposes in general, the pacer is not so popular as 
the trotter, although for matinée uses it is held in high 
favor. For the speedway, the pacer is decidedly popular 
for several reasons. One is that in brushing, a pacer can 
get away quicker than a trotter; and usually, also, it is 
the faster gait. Pacing is an easier gait, and in pacing 
a horse does not strike the pavement so hard, a matter 
of some consideration on hard roads. For usage on com- 
mon roads or in snow, the pacer cannot be said to be as 
popular as the trotter. The pacer has not, as a rule, so 
evenly rated a gait as the trotter. Very often it is a slow
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 105 
amble or full speed. However, many pacers jog-trot, and 
when forced to full speed at a trot strike into a pace when 
urged to do more. 
It is considered by some persons that the pace is an 
ungainly gait, but it is to be remembered that, like all 
other gaits, there is a difference in the classes of it. Some 
horses pitch in such a way as to be lumbering in gait, 
but others go as true and as frictionless as the piston of 
an engine. Again, for road-riders, the pacer does not 
develop, as a rule, into a puller, which is sometimes so 
true of the trotter. While the pacing gait is generally 
considered to be the faster of the two gaits, five seconds 
is thought to about express the difference in time. The 
pacer, as a rule, needs the lighter road rig, for the trotter 
seems to have the advantage slightly in pulling power. 
116. Distribution. — From the New England states 
and Canada, especially Quebec, the pacer was gradually 
scattered all over America, and is now found more par- 
ticularly in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Missouri, Cali- 
fornia and Indiana. 
117. Organizations and records.— The same regis- 
tries and the same associations look after the interests of 
the pacers as those that have the Standardbred trotter 
under their auspices.

118. The Russian Orloff takes its name from Count 
Alexis Orloff, who founded the breed. It has been devel- 
oped in Russia as a light-harness horse, harness racing 
being extremely popular there as in this country. 
119. History in Russia. — The real origin of the Orloff 
was in the gray Arab stallion Smetanka which Count 
Orloff secured in the Orient. He was mated with Thorough- 
bred mares chiefly, but his most notable son, Polkan I, 
was out of a Danish mare. Polkan I in turn sired Bars 
I, the dam of whom was a Dutch mare, described as having 
a good way of going at the trot. The quarterbred Bars 
I was bred to Thoroughbred mares and many of his 
descendants were inbred. Count Orloff began his work 
in 1777, and in 1845 
the stud which had 
passed to his daughter, 
and consisted of 21 stal- 
'\ lions and 194 mares, 
was taken over by the 
i Russian government. 
120. History in 
America. — The largest 
single importation of 
Orlofis was of eighteen 
head at the time of the 
World’s Columbian Exposition, where they were shown. 
While American trotters have been exported to Russia in 
large numbers and raced successfully there, it cannot be 
said that there has been any reciprocal favor shown for 
  Fic. 15.— Orloff stallion.
-P-A-G-E-135
THE LIGHT-HARNESS BREEDS OF HORSES 107 
the Orloff breed in this country. Only a comparatively 
few individuals have been imported and most of these 
have been used as heavy-harness horses. When C. K. G. 
Billings returned from Russia with his wonderful string 
of world record trotters in 1913, it was reported that he 
brought a few Orloff mares to be bred to The Harvester. 
121. Description. — The Orloff is characterized by size 
and substance even to the extent of being somewhat gross 
in comparison with 
our American trotters. 
They usually stand 
‘full sixteen hands in 
height and frequently 
weight 1250 pounds. 
They are less of the 
extreme speed form 
than our trotters, yet 
they lack the rotund- 
ity, symmetry and 
style of the heavy- 
harness breeds. Orloffs are quite regularly gray or black, 
although chestnuts and bays are not at all uncommon 
(Figs. 15, 16). 
122. Uses. — In Russia, the only country in which the 
Orloffs are found in any number, these horses are used to 
the three-horse troika. 
123. Organizations and records.— There is no 
American Registry Association for Orloffs, their foreign 
certificates being accepted here. Since the breed is 
practically controlled by the Russian government, the 
official register is the Record of the Imperial Russian 
Horse Breeding Society.

THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 
SappLE horses of whatever breeding should first show 
their ability to carry weight, in short backs, closely coupled, 
muscular loins and comparatively short, stout legs. The 
feature of conformation that serves to distinguish the 
saddle horse most is the long sloping shoulder, and the 
consequent high withers extending well back; also the 
long, shapely, supple neck so essential to a light forehand. 
They must also have a sure, springy step and a collected 
way of going, in order to give a safe and satisfactory ride.

124. The term Thoroughbred, in its correct application, 
is restricted to designate the English race horse or runner, 
only. The incorrect use of the term, as synonymous with 
pure-bred, is so common as to lead to much confusion and 
misunderstanding. A “ thoroughbred ” trotter would be 
an anomaly and a “ thoroughbred ”’ Percheron impossible. 
When it is intended to indicate the total absence of alien 
blood, pure-bred is the proper adjective.. Thoroughbred 
is a noun. 
There is no one best breed of horses, but because of a 
more general adaptability to a wider range of conditions

THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 109 
and a consequent broader usefulness, or as marking some 
special achievement in the breeding art, we may justly 
assign to one breed more importance than to others. 
The importance of the Thoroughbred is attested by the 
following facts: It was the first breed improved and the 
one on which the principles of breeding have been most 
systematically practiced; barring the Oriental, from 
which the Thoroughbred is derived, his is the purest 
lineage possessed by any breed, and for it the first stud- 
book for the recording of pedigrees was established ; 
Thoroughbred blood has been most freely drawn upon 
in the improvement of other breeds and types — in fact, 
there is scarcely a harness or saddle horse that does not 
owe its merit indirectly to the Thoroughbred crosses in 
its ancestry; the Thoroughbred has been a most impor- 
tant means of indulging a love of sport on the turf and 
in the field for three centuries. 
125. History in Great Britain — A knowledge of the early 
horse history of Great Britain is necessary for a complete 
understanding of the origin of the Thoroughbred. It is 
interesting to note first, that there are no indications of 
any horses having been indigenous to Britain, although 
the most recent researches reported by Ridgeway indi- 
cate that horses of the north African type were in 
Treland as early as the sixth century. The horses with 
which Britain was first stocked_are generally held to 
have been derived from the pony t¥pes native to northern 
Europe, and consequently were small in stature. We 
know that the first efforts at improvement were in the 
way of increasing the size. The Norsemen were the first 
to introduce the war horse, and the blood of Normandy 
and Flanders was thereafter drawn on in an attempt to 
produce horses of a sufficient size and strength to carry
-P-A-G-E-140
110 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
an armored knight. Among other edicts enacted in the 
reign of Henry VIII, was one limiting the size of sires 
to be used to not less than fourteen hands. 
The horse as a feature in the sports of the times is first 
mentioned in the latter half of the twelfth century, when 
races of a primitive character and mounted sports were 
conducted at Smithfield, as a recreation for the people. 
The first race reported was run between Richard IT and 
the Earl of Arundel in 1377. Henry VIII was the first 
king who raced horses for hid own amusement. In 1580, 
the horses of Great Britain were classified by Thomas 
Blundeville as follows: “a breed of Great Horses meete for 29 66 warre and to serve in the field, ambling horses of ameane 
stature for to journey and travel by the waie,” “a race 
of swift runners to run for wagers or to gallop the buck” 
and “ a breed only for draftes or burden.” It is important 
to note that at this early time horses were extensively 
used for racing and hunting. They were undoubtedly the 
descendants of the Barbs and Turks, which are known to 
have been in Great Britain at an early date, the Arab not 
having been introduced until 1616. Racing increased in 
popularity under James I, who imported the first Arabian 
for the purpose of breeding horses of greater speed. After 
the example of James I, other and frequent importations 
of Arabians, Barbs, and Turks were made from the Orient 
and Spain. By the time of Charles I, the sentiment in 
favor of racing had become so strong that much concern 
was felt for the defense of the kingdom, as so little atten- 
tion was then being paid to the production of the Great 
or War horse. 
The real era of the Thoroughbred is usually dated from 
the time of Charles II (1660-1685). He not only took an’ 
active interest in racing, but imported direct from the
-P-A-G-E-141
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES nla 
Levant. His most notable importation was of the Barb 
mares, commonly known as the King’s or Royal mares, 
which are regarded by some authorities as the foundation 
dams of the true blood horse. Others, however, doubt 
the accuracy of thus limiting the base of the breed. 
126. Important sires. — The three most important 
oriental sires in the foundation of the Thoroughbred were 
the Darley Arabian, now known to have been a pure-bred 
Anazeh, imported in 1706; the Byerly Turk, imported 
in 1689; and the Godolphin Barb, brought in 1724 from 
Paris, where he was found hauling a water-cart, having 
been discarded, no doubt, by some member of the royal 
family to whom he had been presented. Lclipse, the 
greatest horse of his kind, is a direct descendant four 
generations removed from the Darley Arabian, as were 
also Blaze, three generations removed, the foundation 
Hackney sire, and Imported Messenger, six generations 
removed, the foundation American trotter sire. From 
the Byerly Turk comes King Herod, another noted sire, 
while Matchem, a great race horse and successful sire, 
was a grandson of the Godolphin Barb. Furthermore, 
Justin Morgan, who shares honors with Imp. Messenger, 
already referred to as a foundation American sire, is said 
to be a direct descendant of Godolphin Barb. It is claimed 
that American Thoroughbreds, as a rule, are less remote 
from their oriental ancestry than the average English 
horse, and that they follow more closely their type. 
127. Purpose for which bred. — Thoroughbreds have 
been bred for nearly three centuries under a most rigid | 
system of selection, turf performance alone being the 
standard. The high degree of equine perfection exempli- 
fied by the best Thoroughbred individuals, as well as the 
prominence to which the breed has attained, can be at- 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
Ee ae tc te Renee Ree eee 
112 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
tributed in large part, no doubt, to the fact that the destiny 
of the Thoroughbred has been cast with men who had un- 
limited resources on which to draw. 
Time and altered customs have wrought important 
changes in the system under which these horses are raced, 
with some corresponding modification in type. Whereas, 
up to 1880 these races had been in four-mile heats, the 
custom now is to run dashes, carry less weight, and start 
as two-year-olds, a custom, which, like the horse, has 
come to us from England. The wisdom of the present 
course is doubted by some who hold the stamina and 
weight-carrying ability of the old four-milers in higher 
esteem than the great flights of extreme speed for a few 
furlongs, shown by our modern sprinters. Conflicting 
opinions are expressed, too, with regard to the probability 
of these twentieth-century horses being capable of lower- 
ing the distance-records of a century ago. Those who 
know, however, are reluctant to admit that the Thorough- 
bred of to-day is a degenerate in any sense, and, in support 
of their view, they maintain that in olden times the horses 
ran but a few races a year, with no handicaps, and they 
were especially trained for each race. Against this, the 
modern horse is’ credited with being kept in racing form 
nine months in the year, running many races in a single 
season, and these closely contested because of the number 
of contestants and the method of adjusting handicaps. 
The three classic events run in England are the Derby, 
the St. Leger and the Oaks. The first Derby was run 
May 4, 1780, for a stake valued at fifty guineas, open to 
three-year-olds, colts to carry eight stone, fillies seven- 
stone eleven pounds, over a distance of one mile. It was 
won by Diomed. The first and only American-bred horse 
towin the English Derby was Iroquois, a line descendant of
-P-A-G-E-143
    THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 113 
Diomed, racing in the colors of Mr. Pierre Lorillard. This 
horse, the same season, won the St. Leger, a most notable 
feat in view of the fact that both Derby and St. Leger 
have been won by the same horse but nine times in over 
a century of racing. 
128. History in America.—It is natural that this 
country should have been the first, after England, to take 
up the Thoroughbred and systematically breed and race 
him. It was not long after the colonization of the southern 
provinces by the English gentry that there was established 
an American turf with its Thoroughbred studs. 
In connection with the introduction of the Thorough- 
bred into America, some mention of the so-called native 
horses should be made. While there is abundant evidence 
in the way of fossil remains of the presence and possibly 
the evolution of a prehistoric horse on the American conti- 
nent, still there were no horses of any description found 
here by Columbus. He it was who on his second expedi- 
tion made the first importation of which we have any 
record. These horses are thought by some to have 
perished soon after their arrival, while other authorities 
assert that they eventually gained the mainland and con- 
stitute a part of our foundation stock. Cortez, in his 
conquest of Mexico in 1519, is credited with having landed 
the first horses on American soil. In 1527, Cabeza de 
Vaca brought horses to St. Augustine, Florida, which were 
afterward liberated. Again, horses constituted a part of 
the equipment of De Soto’s expedition in 1541, on which 
he discovered the Mississippi. Thus far these were all 
- Spanish horses of oriental extraction — the same original 
source from which the Thoroughbred sprang. In 1604, 
the French took horses into Nova Scotia, and four years 
later introduced them into Canada. Then followed the 
I
-P-A-G-E-144
114 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
importation of one stallion and six mares into Virginia 
from England. Dutch horses arrived at New Netherlands - 
in 1625, and in 1629 the first horses (Thoroughbreds) to in- 
habit New England arrived at Boston from England. As 
early as 1678, there ranged over parts of the Mississippi 
valley vast bands of wild horses, the descendants of those 
escaped or liberated from early conquests and expeditions. 
In view of the character of the early settlers of Virginia, 
New York and New England, respectively, it is not strange 
that the cradle of the Thoroughbred in America should 
have been in Virginia. Horse-racing was not consistent 
with the Puritan traditions of New Englanders, and the 
Dutchman’s horse in New York was essentially a beast of 
burden. It remained, therefore, for the cavaliers of 
Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland to become sponsors 
for this horse, which was later to play such an important 
part in American sporting and industrial progress. 
The first race horse imported to America is thought to 
have been Bulle Rock, son of the Darley Arabian, brought 
into Virginia in 1730. The first racing organization of 
which we have record was formed in 1760 at Charleston, 
South Carolina. Subsequently there were brought over 
many of England’s best horses, the most notable of which 
was Diomed, winner of the first English Derby. This 
horse, imported when twenty-one’ years old, in 1798, by 
Colonel Hoomes, much against the advice of his counselors, 
is regarded as the real progenitor of the American race 
horse. In a regular line of descent from him come Sir 
Archy, the first truly American Thoroughbred; Boston, 
his grandson, conceded to have been the greatest American 
race horse; and, in turn, his son, Lexington, a scarcely 
less remarkable performer than Boston, and a most in- 
fluential sire, especially through the female line, in the
-P-A-G-E-145
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 115 
American Standardbred and Saddle families, as well as of 
the Thoroughbred. 
The trend of Thoroughbred sentiment was first north- 
ward from its original seat, about the middle of the eight- 
eenth century, centering later about the Union course on 
Long Island, then westward into Kentucky and Tennessee, 
where the first race-course was established at Lexington, 
some time previous to the organization of a chartered as- 
sociation in 1828. The environment of Kentucky proved 
so congenial to the horses bred there, that it soon attained 
its premier position among the horse-producing states. 
Then, in the natural course of events, some of the best 
blood of Virginia and Kentucky found its way into Cali- 
fornia, and there were soon founded studs which later 
achieved national fame. The Civil War proved a serious 
set-back to the breeding operations then well under way, 
but the Thoroughbred soon recovered from this inter- 
ruption, and with the reéstablishment of affairs on a stable 
basis, became generally distributed throughout the length 
and breadth of the land. He is still most extensively bred 
in those regions where he first came to his own. Notable 
patrons of the Thoroughbred in America have been Wash- 
ington, Jackson, Clay, Jefferson and John Randolph. 
129. Description.— The Thoroughbred conforms to 
and is the truest exponent of the long, lithe, rangy, deep, 
narrow, angular type consistent with speed, which is in 
such striking contrast to the low, broad, compact and mas- 
sive form significant of power in the draft horse. It is 
possible, however, to enumerate certain characters that 
are more particularly and distinctly Thoroughbred than 
the type, which is more or less common to all speed horses. 
These characters are derived in part from the oriental 
progenitors, while some may be regarded as strictly Thor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
116 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
oughbred in their origin. Most characteristic are the 
extreme refinement and clear definition of features, the 
small, proportioned head and ear, the straight face line, 
the neat throttle, long sloping shoulders, high withers, 
muscular quarters, and clean, hard, flat bone. These are 
associated with a low, pointing, close-to-the-ground way 
of going, which insures the greatest stride with the least 
effort. Then, in addition to a racy form, the Thorough- 
bred has a racy temperament, possessing a most highly 
organized nervous system. The characteristic ‘“ buck 
knees ” are all too commonly noticeable in the Thorough- 
bred, from the galloping yearling to the seasoned cam- 
paigner. Another objectionable feature frequently noticed 
in the breed is the tendency towards weediness, as it is 
termed, 7.e. long legs and light body. The prevailing 
colors.are bay, brown and chestnut, with one or more 
white markings. The most important modification in 
type during the development of the Thoroughbred is an 
increase in stature, which Sir Walter Gilbey estimates 
to have been.one hand two and one-half inches from the 
year 1700 to the year 1900, the average height of the 
modern Thoroughbred being fifteen hands two and one- 
half inches. The average weight is about one thousand 
pounds. 
130. Technical description. —A detailed description 
of the Thoroughbred follows: Weight, 900-1050; 
height, fifteen to sixteen hands; color, bay, brown

limbs; a very “breedy” head, with sharply defined 
features, a straight face line, trim muzzle, large nostril, 
full, clear, prominent eye, broad forehead, neat ear 
and clean-cut throttle; neck long and rather straight,

a general appearance of quality and refinement (Fig. 17). 
131. Use for sporting purposes. —There may be some 
question as to the propriety of claiming any real usefulness 
for a horse, the only purpose of which is to serve as an 
active factor in the sports and pastimes of the people. Be 
that as it may, no one can deny to the Thoroughbred full 
meed of praise for a most efficient service in his own pe- 
culiar field. The turf, originally an English institution, 
was early transplanted to other countries, and all peoples 
among whom flat-racing, steeple-chasing, hunting, and 
polo are in vogue, may be expected to testify to the use- 
fulness of the Thoroughbred.

There is such diversity of opinion, even among authori- 
ties, as to the relative merits of the Thoroughbred and the 
American Saddle horse for saddle work, and the Thorough- 
bred and the part-bred horse as hunters, that the fairest 
way to treat them would be to review the evidence on 
both sides. By his opponents the Thoroughbred is ob- 
jected to as a saddle horse because of his disproportionate 
yp 
    
Fic. 18.— Thoroughbred saddle mare. height at the withers 
and croup, his un- 
symmetrical appear- 
ance from the saddle, 
his low “ daisy cut- 
ting” way of going, 
which they assert is 
conducive to stum- 
bling, and his erratic, 
nervous tempera- 
ment, which renders 
himuntractable under 
restraint. | Opposed 
to these objection- 
able features are the 
spirit, the indomitable courage, speed, stamina and 
natural gallop which are possessed by no other horse 
in the same degree. Level-headed Thoroughbreds that 
fold their knees a little and do not drag their hocks 
are being strongly supported in the saddle division of 
eastern shows. For riding to hounds the Thoroughbred 
is said by some to be ill-adapted because of his temper- 
ament, which makes him fretful at checks and difficult to 
‘ control with the field in full ery. Furthermore, the aver- 
age Thoroughbred is not up to the weight imposed by 
many riders who care to indulge in this sport. On the 
/
-P-A-G-E-149
   THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 119 
_ other hand, his supporters maintain that his speed, stamina, 
courage and nerve force may be relied on to bring one 
in safely when others fail. It is said that he does not get 
“ doppy ” at his fences, but will jump, as well as gallop, 
on his courage when fatigued, and that altogether his 
performance is more in keeping with the sport than 
that of his colder-blooded contemporary. A logical 
conclusion seems to be that the Thoroughbred horse 
is best adapted to a Thoroughbred rider (Fig. 18). 
As stated by one authority, “Thoroughbreds are horse- 
men’s horses,” and one who understands their disposition 
and eccentricities is not likely to be satisfied with any 
other kind of a mount; while, for those less accomplished 
in horsemanship, and satisfied with a more moderate ride, 
the horse which has his fire cooled to some extent by a dip 
of plebeian blood is more suitable. 
132. Use for crossing. — To estimate properly the full 
utility value of this race, it is necessary to consider, in 
addition to the service which individuals of the breed have 
rendered in performance on the flat and cross country, the 
great influence of the blood in union with that of other 
stocks. Notwithstanding the fact that this horse has 
been the creation of generations of sportsmen, with speed 
performance the standard of selection, it is the potency of 
his blood when blended with common, native stocks which 
is of greatest value in the production of market horses for 
- use outside the realm of sport. In all but the draft breeds _ 
the influence of the Thoroughbred may be demonstrated. 
In the heavy-harness division, the foundation blood lines 
of the recognized breeds are significant. The Hackney 
descends from Shales, a son of Blaze, Thoroughbred, out 
of a strong common mare of Norfolk. Thoroughbred sires 
have produced from native French mares the half-blood
-P-A-G-E-150
120 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
horses from which the French coach has been evolved. 
They are still called Demi-sang (half-blood) in France. 
The German Coach horse has less of the Thoroughbred 
character and foundation, but even here “ the trail of the 
blood ” may be traced. The Yorkshire coach horse repre- 
sents a Thoroughbred-Cleveland Bay cross. The repre- 
sentative light-harness horse is the American trotter, and 
the two individuals accredited with being the foundation 
sires are Imp. Messenger, Thoroughbred, and Justin Mor- 
gan, said to be of Thoroughbred extraction. The Ameri- 
can Saddle Horse, as a breed, is descendant from Denmark, 
Thoroughbred, son of Imp. Hedgeford, and repeated in- 
fusions of Thoroughbred blood are stilladmitted. Further- 
more, the ranks of the hunter, jumper and polo pony 
classes, not breeds, but market types, are chiefly filled by 
either full- or part-bred blood horses. 
133. Part-bred horses. — In accordance with the idea 
- that the term Thoroughbred implies that a horse is totally 
of the blood, the term part-bred has become a common 
means of designating a horse that is not altogether, but 
only partly, of the blood. It is even customary further to 
indicate the proportion of hot or Thoroughbred blood, 
by applying the terms two-parts or half-bred to the get of 
a Thoroughbred sire out of a common bred mare, and 
three-parts or three-quarters bred to the individual whose 
sire was a Thoroughbred, while his dam was two-parts 
bred, as above. In those sections of the country where 
Thoroughbred sires have been available, horses of this 
fractional breeding are common. As a matter of fact, 
horses produced in this way have such a wide field of use- 
fulness as to keep them in steady demand ; therefore this 
is a line of breeding that may be strongly commended to 
many farmers. While these horses are produced principally

  THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 121 
as green hunter material (Fig. 19), the part-bred horse is a 
most versatile equine. It is questionable whether there 
is any type of horse that can fill more acceptably so many 
different vocations as he. While somewhat deficient in 
style and trotting speed, 
his substance and stam- 
ina make him a stout, 
all-day road horse. He 
can be easily schooled 
to the walk-trot-canter 
standard, while his 
greatest accomplish- 
ment is to take up one

two hundred pounds’ 
weight and __ gallop,

tances across country “A.

doing all the jumping requisite to such a performance. 
It has been further demonstrated that the part-bred 
horse has a place on the farm. 
134. Distribution. — The Thoroughbred has found its 
way into all countries where speed horses are popular. 
Other countries to follow the precedent of England in the 
establishment of the race course and the patronage of the 
Thoroughbred, were America, France, Germany, Austra- 
lia, and Argentina, especially. ' 
+ 135. Organizations and records. — The first publica- 
tion of recorded pedigrees and performances was in 1829. 
The official organ and record of the Thoroughbred in Eng- 
land is the General Stud-book of Great Britain. In this 
country, Thoroughbreds are registered in the American

136. The American Saddle horse, as its name indicates, 
is a saddle horse developed in America. While it is 
adapted first of all for saddle purposes, it has long since 
demonstrated its worth for light harness service. Its 
peculiar grace of motion and aptitude for the saddle gaits 
in their perfection, place it in the forefront of horses used 
for saddle work. 
137. History.—The American Saddle horse is the 
outgrowth of necessity. Before railroads were established 
in this country, and while traffic was by horseback over 
unbroken or almost impassable roads, there was a demand 
for a sure-footed, sturdy horse that could travel long dis- 
tances at a steady rate of speed, and at the same time 
carry a pack or a rider. Out of this need grew the Ameri- 
can Saddle horse, very crude and undeveloped at first, 
but to be gradually molded, as necessity changed, into the 
magnificent type as he stands to-day. 
Virginia and the south Atlantic states had given much 
attention to racing, and at a very early date were breeders
-P-A-G-E-153
   THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 123 
of the Thoroughbred. One source of importation was 
Canada. There they had raised a hardy little horse, said 
to be a cross of the French importations, generally with 
such stallions as could be secured from New York and 
New England. Incidentally, these stallions were most 
often of German and Netherland breeding. The Cana- 
dians had given much attention to the development of the 
pace or amble. Many of these Canadian horses drifted 
down into what were then the horse-breeding colonies. 
They had something of the gait and stamina required, but 
lacked in both beauty and courage. Some of these Cana- 
dian mares were crossed with available Thoroughbred 
stallions to produce a saddle horse, with most satisfactory 
results, certain lines of Thoroughbred blood giving the 
best product. The most satisfactory lines of the Thor- 
oughbred blood were selected, and all others rejected. 
Most of the horses brought to Kentucky by the early 
settlers were these “‘ saddlers,” and many of them the best 
that had been produced in the older states. The natural 
character of the Kentucky country led to the concentration 
of the best of these new saddle horses within her borders. 
The importance that attached to the efforts of the saddle- 
horse breeders in Kentucky led to the name “ Kentucky 
saddle horse ’”’ being applied to these horses. 
Imp. Hedgeford was a brown colt, foaled in England in 
1825 by Filho-de-Puta, out of Miss Craigie by Orville. He 
was bred by a Mr. Mylton, imported in 1832 by William 
Jackson of New York, and taken to Kentucky, where he 
died in 1840. Among his get was the great Denmark, 
_which was foaled in 1839, out of Betsey Harrison by Aratus, 
and bred by Samuel Davenport of Kentucky. He was 
a game and consistent four-mile race horse, but not re- 
markable for his speed. Denmark was bred to the Steven-

ee oe ee ere tere 
124 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
son mare 43, a brown saddle mare by Cockspur, the latter 
a saddler of one-half or three-fourths Thoroughbred blood. 
In 1850, Gaines’ Denmark 61 was foaled, out of the Steven- 
son mare. He was the greatest of the sons of Denmark. 
He served through the Civil war, along with John Dillard, 
another famous saddler. Nine-tenths of the successful 
modern sires trace directly to Gaines’ Denmark. Follow- 
‘ ing the war there came a craze for speed horses, and many 
t of the best saddle mares were stinted to trotting stallions, 
much to the detriment of the saddle horse. 
In 1891, the American Saddle Horse Breeders’ Associa- 
tion was organized. In its stud-book were inserted the 
names of the “ foundation stock.” In most of these foun- 
dation stallions there was a strong admixture of Thorough- 
bred blood, and many of them trace their lineage through 
Denmark’s dam. In 1901, after ten years of careful work, 
the list of foundation stallions was revised to include the 
following ten horses: Denmark, John Dillard, Tom Hal, 
Cabell’s Lexington, Coleman’s Eureka, Van Meter’s Waxy, 
Stump-the-dealer, Peter’s Halcorn, Davy Crockett and 
Pat Cleburne. 
138. Notable sires and dams. — John Dillard was by 
Canada Chief out of Lady Jackson, which was a daughter 
of Blackburn’s Whip, which was by Imp. Whip, and he was 
by Imp. Saltram. Imp. Saltram got the Saltram mare, and 
she was the dam of Jenny Cockracy, which produced 
Betsey Harrison, the dam of Denmark; Jenny Cockracy 
also produced Susette, the dam of Berthune, the sire of 
Van Meter’s Waxy, another of the foundation list. This 
illustrates the constant interweaving of the same Thorough- 
bred blood that characterized the early breeding efforts. 
The same intricate interrelationship could be traced for 
the other foundation stallions if space permitted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 125 
Tom Hal was a Canadian pacer imported to Kentucky. 
He was a blue roan, foaled in 1802, and lived to the great 
age of forty-one years. He was the founder of the Hal 
family of Tennessee, of the Blue Bull family of Indiana 
and the noted Tom Hal saddle horses of Kentucky. 
Among many others, he was the sire of the noted horse 
Bald Stockings 76, which was the first horse ever noticed 
to go the running-walk. The dam of Cabell’s Lexington 
was by Tom Hal. Here we catch genuine Morgan blood, 
for Cabell’s Lexington was by Gist’s Black Hawk, 
which was by Blood’s Black Hawk, which was 
by Vermont Black Hawk. In Coleman’s Eureka we 
again find Morgan blood on the sire’s side and Thorough- 
bred blood on the dam’s. He was a dark chestnut, sixteen 
hands high, and won about one hundred and twenty-five 
premiums in saddle and combined rings. Van Meter’s 
Waxy was unquestionably a Thoroughbred horse. On the 
sire’s side he traces to the two Barb horses sent to Thomas 
Jefferson by the Bey of Tunis. Stump-the-dealer was a 
Thoroughbred, tracing on the sire’s side to Saltram and 
on the dam’s side to Imp. Diomed. He was a famous race 
horse. The Halcorn strain is recognized as a separate 
and distinct saddle family. Peter’s Halcorn, the head of 
the family, is described as a remarkably handsome bay 
stallion. Of the breeding of Davy Crockett we know 
nothing. He was imported to Kentucky from Canada 
and has been a great producer of saddle horses. He was 
characterized by power and endurance, and had large, 
yellow eyes which he frequently imparted to his get. Pat 
Cleburne is noteworthy for his production in the hands of 
Missouri breeders. 
This list might be greatly extended by the addition of the 
noted horses of more recent years. Mention should be

made especially of the famous sires Black Squirrel 58, 
Montrose 106, Black Eagle 74, Chester Dare 10, High- 
land Denmark 730, Cecil Palmer 933, Bourbon Chief 976 
and Dominor 2631. ; 
139. Description. —'The most outstanding characteris- 
tics of the American Saddle horse are courage, docility and 
superb finish (Fig. 20). His courage and spirit, coupled 
with his docility, give him his special usefulness on the battle 
field, as well as in the harness. Breeders of this horse have 
held before them an 
ideal type, and it is 
not too much to say 
that this ideal has been 
approached somewhat 
closely. The ideal 
American Saddle horse 
may be described thus: 
The muzzle is small 
and delicate, with dis- 
tended and _ sensitive 
nostril. The head is 
bony, rather small, 
with generally just an 
indication of a dish in 
the face; the eyes full, round and prominent, and set 
wide apart. The small, pointed ears are set well apart, 
and are constantly played; sometimes there is a slight 
cup to the point of the ear. The horse should bear an 
expression of courage and gentleness. Behind the ears 
is the fine muscular throttle, on which the head is set 
at a good angle. The neck is long and gracefully 
crested. The shoulders are sloping. There is good 
depth through the heart, a short, strong back, the barrel     Fic. 20. — American saddle stallion.
-P-A-G-E-157
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 127 
ribbed well back and quite as large around the last rib as 
at the girth. The horse is strong across the kidneys and 
the coupling is powerful. The quarters are level, strongly 
muscled and long from the point of the hip to the hock. 
The tail comes out well up, is carried high, and is heavy, 
long and flowing. The body is set on comparatively 
short legs. The bone of the leg is broad, flat and closely 
knit, and the tendons strong. The fore-arm is powerfully 
muscled and the fore-legs straight. The hind-leg is not 
so straight as in the Thoroughbred, and is well muscled. 
The legs are short from knee and hock to ankle. The 
pasterns are a little long and sloping. The feet are hard 
but elastic, heels well spread and well developed. The 
average height of the Saddle horse is about fifteen hands 
two inches, and the weight approximately 1000 pounds. 
140. The saddle horse in motion. — The methods of 
educating the saddle horse would carry us too far afield, 
but we may consider the motion of the educated horse. 
Beautiful as this horse is, he must be seen in motion to be 
appreciated. 
141. The flat-footed walk should be prompt, brisk, 
elastic, “‘ dead in line” and fast. Speed is important and 
should be equal to at least three and a half miles an hour. 
Horses will occasionally be found that will walk at the rate 
of four and a half miles an hour, but the lower estimate 
is good walking. It may generally be assumed that a 
horse is walking properly if all four shoes may be seen from 
behind him, and the feet on the same side are in line. 
142. The trot should be true, “ dead in line,” well under 
the horse, balanced, prompt and with both shoulder and 
stifle put well into the motion. Unless the shoulder is 
put well into the motion, the mere play of knees yields a 
racking, uncomfortable ride. Unless the stifle is brought 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
128 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
into full play, the recovery is necessarily slow. This is not 
only a bad fault, but gives one an idea that the horse is 
going one gait in front, and another behind. To use a 
trade expression, ‘‘ the horse is going in two pieces.” For 
a comfortable ride, knee and hock action must be equal ; 
and, given this equality, it cannot be too high. With all 
this, the ideal saddle horse must accomplish one more thing 
with his trot: he must trot with all four legs under him — 
the trot must be gathered ; he must come up into the bit, 
and still not pull an ounce. The trot of the ordinary horse 
is straggly and too much extended. The men who best 
accomplish this “ gathering ” of the trot are the most suc- 
cessful educators. 
143. The canter. — This gait, in its modern develop- 
ment, is a thing of beauty. The old “’lope”’ or gallop, 
which seemed to ride one down hill, is relegated with the 
side swiping pace. The canter of to-day is high, bounding, 
elastic, gathered slow, and right under the horse. At this 
gait a horse’s hocks should be right under him, and the 
motion should come almost entirely from the front, while 
the quarters are sparingly used. The horse should lead 
with either foot, and change lead at command with such 
ease that no signal can be detected. His quarters should 
be so thoroughly flexed that they are always turned toward 
the center of the circle in which he may be supposed to be 
cantering. That is, when the horse is leading with the 
right foot his quarters should be well under him, and in to 
the right. In other words, the horse’s body should take 
the curve of the circle in which he is supposed to be canter- 
ing. This is the only possible way to get a comfortable 
and pleasing canter. At the same time, the rider should 
gently raise the horse, with an almost imperceptible pres- 
sure on the bit, at each upward bound. This is the canter
-P-A-G-E-159
   THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 129 
in contradistinction to the gallop, and the American saddle 
horse seems almost to do it naturally. 
144. The slow gait may be any one of three, that is, 
(1) the running-walk; (2) the fox-trot; (3) the stepping- 
pace. 
(1) The running-walk. — This is the intermediate de- 
velopment between the flat-footed walk and the rack. The 
motion, rhythm and recovery are identically the same. It 
is a “ single-foot,” just as are the flat-footed walk and the 
rack. But the tempo is greater than in the walk, and less 
than in the rack. It is much the most graceful of the slow 
gaits, and the easiest on both horse and rider. At this 
gait a horse can cover mile after mile, up and down hill, 
without distressing either himself or his rider. A speed . 
of six to eight miles an hour is not unusual, and occasionally 
a “running-walker ” is found that can do nine miles or 
better. Not all members of this breed can be taught to 
go the running-walk well, and for that reason it has been 
decreed that either the fox-trot or the stepping-pace may 
be accepted as a substitute. 
(2) The fox-trot.— This may be best designated as a 
mongrel gait. -It is not so graceful nor so easy as either 
the running-walk or the stepping-pace. At this gait, the 
horse goes a jog-trot in front and paces behind. 
(83) The stepping-pace is nearly as graceful a gait as the 
running-walk, and when well done is quite as easy on the 
rider and only slightly harder on the horse. It is not 
the side-swiping pace of the harness horse. At this gait 
the horse is going the running-walk with his fore-feet and 
pacing with his hind-feet. , 
145. The rack. — This gait is the highest development 
of the flat-footed walk. It is nothing but the flat-footed 
walk developed to high speed. The rhythm and motion 
K
-P-A-G-E-160
130 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
are identical, and the old name of “ single-foot ” was an 
aptly descriptive term. The feet hit the ground in suc- 
cession, one at atime. It is the flashiest and most attrac- 
tive gait a horse can go, and while tiring to the horse, there 
is no gait more delightful to the rider. 
146. Use as a cavalry horse. — In both the Civil and 
Spanish-American wars the American Saddle horse has 
been put to the test, and in both cases the testimony has 
. been to his unsurpassed excellence as a cavalry horse. His 
endurance, combined with his smooth, fast walk, enable 
him to stand the hard strains with the minimum of fatigue 
to himself and his rider.. He is reliable on the field and 
quick to adapt himself to the maneuvers. 
147. Use as a commercial horse. — The same qualities 
that adapt the American Saddle horse for cavalry pur- 
poses make him valuable commercially wherever horses 
are kept under the saddle. His winnings in the show-ring 
attest his popularity. In the ten years, 1896-1905, at the 
national horse-show in Madison Square Garden, New York 
City, the American Saddle horse won twelve out ofa total 
of eighteen championships open to all breeds of horses that 
wear the saddle. His show-ring winnings add to his com- 
mercial value. Within a recent year, the following sales 
were made: The Moor, a three-year-old stallion, was sold 
for $7500; Tattersall and Mate, a pair of geldings, sold 
for $6000 ; Eugenia and Magna, a pair of mares, brought 
$5000; American Girl, a four-year-old mare, sold for 
$5000. .Prices up to $1000 for a single horse are not 
uncommon. F 
148. Use as a gaited horse. — The demand for gaited 
horses is met by members of this breed. Saddle horses of 
other breeds do the three natural gaits, the walk-trot and 
canter. The American Saddle horse is distinctive in that
-P-A-G-E-161
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 131 
he can be readily taught to go the five gaits, the walk, 
trot, canter, rack or single-foot, and the running-walk, 
fox-trot or slow pace. The gaits are largely a matter of 
training with any horse, but the American Saddle horse 
may be said to have an inherent tendency and aptitude to 
master the gaits more quickly and perfectly than horses 
of other breeds. 
149. Use as a harness horse. — The American Saddle 
horse has also a place as a light harness horse, as is indi- 
cated by the following examples: Emily 855, World’s 
Fair Champion at Chicago in 1893, has frequently gone a 
mile in 2:35 to 2:50. Hitched double with Dorothy 
1210 (winner of seventy-two blue ribbons in succession), 
the pair have driven a mile in 2:52. Rex Arbuckle 1467, 
champion light harness horse at the Kentucky State Fair 
in 1906, has driven a mile many times in better than a 
“forty” gait. This same stallion has won prizes in many 
five-gaited rings. Among others, John Dillard F. S. 
should be mentioned as a notable sire of the dams of light 
harness racers. 
150. Use asa hunter. — Many of these American Sad- 
dle horses have been educated as hunters. A notable 
example was Copeland 1153,.whose name was changed 
to Pisgah. This horse won many ribbons in hunter rings. 
151. Breeding. — But little can be said on this subject 
that is not applicable to all pure-bred stock. The one en- 
deavor since the foundation of the type has been to pro- 
duce a horse fitted in conformation and motion and intel- 
ligence for a definite purpose; to breed a beautiful horse, 
with as nearly perfect motion as possible. To this end, 
breeders have bent their energies in using the process of 
selection and rejection. Out of the years that have 
passed, certain lessons have been learned. The remark- 
  
-P-A-G-E-162
TR Pee NE Ne ee Se Tee NT eT ne PO ee PT Ee et eee ee 
| 132 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
| able prepotency of the blood of Gaines’ Denmark 61, in 
the male line, has been conclusively demonstrated. He is 
a reckless man who undertakes to produce the modern 
American Saddle horse, with a stallion heading his stud 
which lacks the direct male trace to this greatest of the 
Denmarks. Fortunately, his blood has been so diffused 
that there is no danger of inbreeding. The years havealso 
demonstrated that certain lines of blood have produced 
great brood-mare families. The daughters of Peayine 
85, Dave Akin 775, Harrison Chief 1606, Indian Chief 
1718, and that exquisite son of Magic, Beauty 604, have 
produced very successfully when mated to stallions possess- 
ing a direct male lineage to Gaines’ Denmark 61. Not 
yet has the Chief family produced an acceptable sire. 
The general rules followed in the production of the 
present-day American Saddle horse may be stated thus: 
(1) Have the stallion trace directly to Gaines’ Denmark 
61. (2) Have in the brood-mares as many crosses as pos- 
sible of the proved great brood-mare sires. (3) Line-breed 
to the proved great brood-mares of the breed, and remem- 
ber that of these, Nannie Garrett 472 stands easily first. 
It seems hardly necessary to add that the question of 
individuality is even more pertinent here than in other 
breeds. No horse of this breed can carry such superior 
blood lines as to warrant overlooking inferior individuality. 
The ideal must be definite and must be adhered to. 
152. Feeding. — It has been learned from the breeders 
of Thoroughbreds that the essential growth of a horse is 
mainly in the first year of his life. Hence, we antedate his 
birth and keep his dam in prime condition. For twenty- 
four hours after his birth, the dam has no food, but a 
bucket of water with the chill taken off is kept constantly 
before her. At the expiration of the twenty-four hours, 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
   THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 133 
the attendant should begin to feed both foal and dam. By 
the time the foal is seven days old, he and his dam are on 
full feed. When it is available, this feed consists of one- 
third wheat bran and two-thirds rolled oats. This, with 
either timothy or Burt oats hay, makes a well-balanced 
ration for mare and foal. This feed is placed in a trough 
low enough for the foal to reach and eat with hisdam. By 
the time he is three days old, he will have learned to eat, 
and then he must be fed regularly. Whatever food is 
available for the mare and foal, it should contain a liberal 
proportion of protein. 
It may be admissible for the writer here to give a warn- 
ing, even though it may seem to be unnecessary. Both 
alfalfa and clover are dangerous if fed to breeding animals. 
This statement is made out of personal experience in breed- 
ing this horse. There is no better roughage for growing 
horses than clover hay. Alfalfa hay will do for horses if 
clover is not available, but its strong diuretic effect makes 
it necessary to watch it carefully. 
153. Distribution.— The state of Kentucky justly 
claims to have been the nursery of the two American 
breeds of horses, — the American Saddle horse and the 
Standardbred trotter, although Tennessee, and more 
recently Missouri and Illinois, have been very instrumental 
in the development of the Saddle horse. The Saddle 
horse has become distributed over most of the United 
States and parts of Canada. There are at least two very 
creditable studs in Canada and one in Mexico. Seven 
stallions have been sent to South America, two stallions 
to Porto Rico, five stallions to Cuba, one stallion to Hawaii, 
one to New Zealand and five to Japan. Three mares have 
been sent to England. It is probable that representatives 
of this breed have also reached other countries.

154. Organizations and records. — The organization 
devoted to the interests of this breed is the American 
Saddle Horse Breeders’ Association, with headquarters 
at Louisville, Kentucky. When this organization was 
first effected, in 1891, it had the name National Saddle 
Horse Breeders’ Association. The change was made to 
the present name in 1899. The association has published 
six volumes of its register, each volume containing 3000 
registrations. 
AraB Horse. Fig. 21. 
By Homer Davenport 
155. The Arab horse is notable as a saddler, and to im- 
part vigor, quality and intelligence in cross-breeding. His 
blood has been prominent in the development of the Per- 
cheron, Hackney, Thoroughbred, Russian Orloff, Tra- 
kehner, Hanoverian, French and German cavalry, coach 
horses and polo ponies; in fact, a large proportion of 
our present-day types are more or less traceable to the in- 
fluence of the Arabian horse. 
156. Early history.— There has been a great deal of 
query as to where the Arab horse came from. It seems 
probable that he came originally from Mesopotamia, 
although some writers hold that his native home was in 
the vicinity of Nejd. According to Plumb, the Arabs are 
descendants of Ishmael, who according to tradition, in- 
herited a valuable horse of the Kuhl race. The Anazeh 
tribe descended in a direct line from Ishmael, through 
Sheik Salaman, who lived about 1635 B.c. (four genera- 
tions removed from Ishmael), and who owned five famous 
mares. From this ancestry has come the purest and 
best Arab horse blood: This race was in existence many
-P-A-G-E-165
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 135 
centuries before the time of Mohammed. Early in the 
seventeenth century, Arab horses were brought to Eng- 
land, and in the eighteenth century the importations were 
numerous. These exerted considerable influence on the 
development of the Thoroughbred and the Hackney. 
157. History in America. — The first record we have of 
the Arab in America was the importation of the stallion 
Ranger, about 1765, to New London, Connecticut. In 
1838, J. D. Elliott imported a number of both sexes. The 
late A. Keene Richards brought:them to Georgetown, 
Kentucky, in 1856. His plant was making the most rapid 
strides toward success, when it was destroyed by the Civil 
War. The blood of his horses, however, is found in the 
present Kentucky saddle horses, six and seven generations 
back, and there is little doubt that much of the beauty of 
that splendid animal to-day is traceable to the horses that 
A. Keene Richards imported. The next importation was 
the two stallions given to General U. S. Grant by the 
Sultan of Turkey. These were of unknown families, but 
they sired many beautiful and useful horses. 
A number of Arabian horses were brought to the World’s 
Columbian Exposition at Chicago, in 1893. The Sultan 
was induced to permit these horses to come to America for 
the exhibit, and through mortgages they were eventually 
held. Nine were burned to death in their stalls at the 
Exposition by the Syrians that brought them, as the out- 
come of a wrangle. From these horses, however, came the 
best results from any Arab horses brought to America. 
Most of them were bought by Peter B. Bradley, of 
Hingham, Massachusetts, who crossed them on some 
of our best breeds, besides breeding them in their purity. 
With a pure horse of his breeding, Mr. Hess, of New York 
City, won the only blue ribbon ever won over our own 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
136 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
( 
types of saddle horses, with an Arab’in open competition. 
Bradley also bred a trotter, two removes from Arab blood, 
that trotted to a record of 2:30 in the sixth heat of his 
first race. He produced the finest types of polo ponies 
and accomplished much with the Arab blood. 
158. Description. — The Arabian in his purity is a 
horse of high courage, possessing length, strength, power 
and substance, combined with elastic and graceful move- 
ment. He is gentle and affectionate. He seems to have 
no fear of anything, even man, a trait shown particularly 
in young colts. In his native country he stands closer to 
fourteen hands and two inches than any other height ; but 
his size is merely a matter of the feed given him when he is 
a colt, as is shown by the fact that among the Gomussa 
tribe of the Sabba Anazeh, who pay better attention to 
their horses than do others, we find colts at two years old 
standing fifteen hands high; and at the Circassian villages 
up the Euphrates, where even better care of the live-stock 
is taken than by any of the Bedouins, we find the Arab 
horse much advanced in size. 
There is a peculiar balance and harmony throughout 
the frame of the Arab. The beauty of head, ears, eyes, 
jaws, mouth and nostrils is noteworthy. The ears are not 
small, but are so shaped that they appear small; the head 
is short from the eye to the muzzle, broad and well-devel- 
oped above; the eye is soft and intelligent; the nostrils 
are long and appear puckered, drawn back up the face, 
and are capable of great distention; the neck is a model 
of strength and grandeur, of which he can make a perfect 
arch, that matches the arch of his tail. The throat is 
large and well-developed ; it is loose and pliant when at 
rest, and much detached from the rest of the neck. This 
feature is not often noticed, but it is indicative not only of ‘
-P-A-G-E-167
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 137 
good wind, but of the capacity for prolonged exertion with- 
out distress, owing to the great width between the jaws. 
The shoulder is good, as is the deep chest, the appearance 
of which is diminished by the big, deep ribs; the back is 
short, the loins of immense power, and the quarters long 
and strong, the whole beautifully turned. The legs and 
feet are superior. The two great features, possibly, that 
  Fie. 21.— Arab stallion. 
a stranger would notice first in the Arab horse, are the 
forehead, or jibbah, which cannot be too prominent, giving 
a peculiar dish to the lower part of the face, and the tail, 
set high and carried in an arch. The form of the Arabian 
horse is essentially one of utility ; the space for the seat for 
the rider is sufficient, and at once fixes his true position ; 
the weight is therefore carried on that part most adapted 
for it. The rest of the frame is taken up with the powers 
of progression. The color varies, and may be white, gray, 
bay, chestnut, brown and rarely black. Roan, spotted 
or piebald and yellow colors are not found among the 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  138 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Arabs, although roan and yellow are common among 
Barbs. The bays often have black points, and generally 
one or more white feet, with some white in the face. The 
chestnuts vary from the brightest to the dullest shades 
(Fig. 21). 
159. Types and families. — It has been asserted that 
there were two breeds of Arabian horses, a large breed and 
a small breed. This is untrue; there is but one general 
breed of Arabian horses, of which there are many families, 
which are different and distinct in many ways. While 
there are not two distinct breeds, there are a first and a 
second class. A horse, or mare, about whose breeding 
there is the slightest doubt, is disqualified, and not called 
“chubby,” and therefore is of the second class. The 
families originated and descended from some great mare. 
In all cases the breed of the colt is that of the dam, and not 
of the sire; thus, a colt, whose father had been a Hamdani 
Simri, and whose dam had been a Seglawieh Jedranieh, 
would necessarily be a Seglawi Jedran. The Bedouins 
count the father little, so long as he is “chubby,” meaning 
a pure-bred that the Anazeh would breed from, but they 
place everything in the value of the mother’s blood, and 
of her own individuality. 
The Gomussa, of the Sabba Anazeh, are the shrewdest 
horse-breeders of the desert. They have retained, in the 
largest numbers, specimens of the five great families, 
which are called the Khamseh, which means five. They 
also have the choicest of the other families, which are 
rated equal in point of blood. The Khamseh, so the story 
runs, have descended from the five great mares, which, 
with other mares of Sheik Salaman, were drinking at the 
river after long hardships in war, when the trumpet blew, 
calling them back to battle. Only five responded to the
-P-A-G-E-169
We Stee Oe eee Ee tt ene a eee Re Ne Pe, oe ae en ye Tere pera eee 
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 139 
call, and it was those five that founded the five great 
families. 
160. The Keheilan Ajus.— This strain is the most 
numerous, and from it all other Keheilans are offshoots. 
The words Kheleilan Ajus mean the mare of the old woman, 
derived from a legend that the mare was dropped by its 
dam near a well kept by an old woman, where the rider had 
stopped. The traveler rode off in a short time, leaving the 
filly colt with the old woman. The next morning the colt 
was found by its mother’s side, having traced her across 
the desert during the night. Among the Keheilans, bays 
are more numerous than any other color. They are the 
fastest, although not the hardiest horses nor the most 
beautiful. They bear a closer resemblance to the English 
Thoroughbred than any others, as they are more nearly 
related. The Darley Arabian, perhaps the only thorough- 
bred Anazeh horse in our stud-books, was a Keheilan of the 
sub-family called Ras-el-Fadawi. 
161. The Seglawi family have descended from four 
great mares owned by a man of that name. At his death 
he gave his favorite mare to his brother Jedran, and thus 
the Seglawi Jedrans are the favorites of the Seglawies ; he 
gave the second mare to his brother Obeyran; the third 
to Arjebi; and the fourth to El-Abd, meaning the slave. 
The Seglawi Arjebi are extinct, and of the remaining 
strains, the Seglawi Jedran ranks first in the esteem of 
the Bedouins, and Seglawi El-Abd second. Some years 
ago, Abbas Pasha, of Egypt, purchased nearly all of the 
Seglawi Jedran mares from the Anazeh tribe, paying as 
high a price, it is said, as 3000 pounds for a single old 
mare. Many chestnut-colored horses are found among 
the Seglawis; possibly, with the bays, they. would form 
about an equal division.
-P-A-G-E-170
  140 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
162. Hamdani. — The Hamdanis are not common any- 
where on the Syrian desert, the Shammar being supposed 
to have the best. They are mostly grays, although very 
handsome browns and chestnuts are to be found in the 
Shammar. The only strain of the Hamdani that is 
counted “ chubby ” is the Hamdani Simri.*° Mares of the 
Hamdani Simri are very rare. 
163. Abeyan.— The Abeyan is generally the hand- 
somest breed, but it is small and has less resemblance to 
the English Thoroughbred than any of the other families 
of the Arabian horse. The Abeyan Sherrack is the most 
esteemed of the seven strains of the Abeyan (and there 
are but two others of that seven, the Abeyan Zahaine and 
Abeyan Fadaha, that are counted “ chubby ’’). It is the 
name of the family, and the other strains are derived from 
Abeyan Sherrack. Abeyan Sherracks carry their tail 
much higher than other Arabian horses. They are also 
noted for their prominent forehead. or jibbah. Their en- 
durance is remarkable. The colors are bay, chestnut and 
gray. 
164. Hadban. — There are five strains of the Hadban 
family, Hadban Enzekhi being the favorite, and Hadban 
al-Fert being the only other that is considered “ chubby ” 
by the Anazeh. The Gomussa of the Sabba Anazeh are 
supposed to have the best Hadbans at the present time. 
Brown and dark bay are the favorite colors of the Hadban 
Enzekhi family. 
165. Other families. — Besides these five families, there 
are sixteen other families that are esteemed almost as 
much as the Khamseh: (1) The Maneghi, supposed to 
be an offshoot of the Keheilan Ajus. They are plain and 
without distinction, being somewhat coarse, with long 
necks, powerful shoulders, much length, and strong but 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 141 
coarse hindquarters. They are strong boned, and are held 
in high repute as war horses. There are four sub-families 
in this group, the favorite being Maneghi Sbeyel, which is 
counted “chubby ” all over the desert. Maneghi Hedruj, 
the next esteemed, is not counted “ chubby ” at Nejd, but 
is by some tribes of the northern desert. The family of 
Sbeyel of the Gomussa possesses the finest specimens of 
the strain known by that name. (2) Saadan, often very 
beautiful horses; the sub-strain, Saadan Togan, is the 
most highly esteemed. (3) Dakhman. (4) Shueyman. 
The sub-strain of Shueyman Sbah are rated as first-class. 
(5) Jilfan. Of this there is a sub-strain, Jilfan Stam el 
Bulad, meaning the sinews of steel. In some parts of the 
desert, the Jilfan Stam el Bulad is prized equally with 
Hamdani Simri. (6) Toessan. Of this there is the sub- 
strain Toessan Algami. (7) Samhan, with a sub-strain, 
Samhan el Gomeaa. The horses of this family are fre- 
quently very tall, and are much esteemed. (8) Wadnan, 
with the sub-strain, Wadna Hursan. (9) Rishan, with 
the sub-strain Rishan Sherabi. (10) Tamri. The Kehei- 
lan Tamris are highly prized. (11) Melekhan. (12) 
Jereyban. (13) Jeytani. (14) Ferejan. (15) Treyfi. 
(16) Rabdan. Besides these, there are the Keheilan Heife, 
Keheilan Kroash, Keheilan el-Ghazala, Keheilan al-Denais, 
Keheilan al-Nowak, Keheilan al-Muson, Keheilan abu 
junub, Keheilan Rodan, Keheilan Wadman Harsan, Dah- 
man abu Amr, Dahman Shawan, Dahnam Khomais, Abu 
Arkab, all of which are considered “ chubby.” All these 
are Keheilans, and most, or all of them, have descended 
from Keheilan Ajus. 
166. Use for riding and driving. — As a saddle horse 
the Arab horse ranks high. He has always been accus- 
tomed to the saddle, and has developed remarkable en-
-P-A-G-E-172
  142 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
durance, carrying riders long journeys, day after day, in 
a scorching sun, with little feed or water. He can carry 
very heavy weights on his back. When hitched to the 
carriage, he makes a gentle, attractive driving horse. 
167. Use for crossing. — The importance of the Arab 
for cross-breeding purposes is well known. He has entered 
into the development of many of our present-day breeds, — 
trotting, running, saddle, coach and draft, — and has im- 
parted his endurance, quality and intelligence wherever 
used. That he is still valued for this purpose is evidenced 
by the fact that in certain European countries Arab studs 
are officially maintained for breeding purposes. One of 
the most noticeable differences between our best types 
of to-day, especially in America, and the Arab horse, is the 
flat and contracted sides of our horses compared with the 
round, barrel-shaped ribs of the Arabian and the narrow 
openings of the jaw-bones of our horses compared with 
the wide openings of the jaw-bones of the Arab horse. 
Another very noticeable difference is the dropping off 
below the knee of our American horses compared with 
the big, flat bone below the knee of the Arab horse. 
The finer quality of bone that is transmitted by the 
Arab horse in crossing is one of his greatest values. 
Beyond this, perhaps, is his ability to stamp evenness 
and beauty of disposition on his offspring, a quality 
desired in all horses, especially in cavalry horses. 
The very close relation that has long existed between 
the Arab horse and his master, has produced in him a 
docility and intelligence that is seldom found in horses 
of other breeds. The prepotency of the Arab is due to 
the fact that in his veins flows only pure blood, with no 
admixture of cold blood, a fact that cannot be said of any 
other breed.
-P-A-G-E-173
  
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 143 
168. Feeding and care. — Unaccustomed to much feed, 
or regular feed, the Arab is likely to get very fat under our 
method of feeding, so that the horse, once the picture of 
all that is beautiful and graceful, with us may soon become 
a fat horse. He thrives best on half of what other horses 
require. Of all horses, the Arabian is least fit to stand idle 
in his stall. His life for centuries has been under the 
saddle, as a war horse, on the scantest rations any horse 
lives on; and to pen him up in a close stall and feed him 
three meals a day so completely changes his life, that it 
changes his form. 
169. Distribution.— The home of the Arab horse, 
speaking of the pure Arab, is the district that is covered by 
the Nomad Arabs, and is confined to Arabia proper and 
the Syrian desert. In its greatest perfection it is found 
among the Anazeh and Shamar Bedouins, occupying the 
territory east and west along the Euphrates river; the 
Shamar on the eastern shore and the Anazeh west of the 
river. The latter make a circuit of the desert annually, 
going from the summer pastures near Aleppo, in the north, 
to Nejd, in the south, in winter. They swing east past 
Bagdad and Deyr on their way north, and on their journey 
south, go west, brushing near Palmyra and Damascus. 
Within that circuit the home of the Arabian horse may 
be said to lie. The haunts of the pure Arabian are those 
of the desert Bedouins, who still carry the lance. Of 
course, specimens of pure blood can be found sometimes at 
Beyrout, and the coast towns, but such horses have been 
brought there by wealthy citizens. In like manner they 
have been carried into northern Africa, Persia, Turkey, 
Hungary, Germany, France, Russia, England and America. 
The adaptability of the Arab is noteworthy. Accus- 
tomed naturally to the most intense heat, yet he thrives 
‘
-P-A-G-E-174
  144 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
in the extreme cold, and the writer has known one to winter 
perfectly in the mountains of Pennsylvania. His coat, 
while fine and silky in spring and summer, in winter is as 
thick as a beaver’s and has an undercoating of fur-like hair. 
170. Organizations and records.— The Arab Horse 
Club is promoting the interests of the Arab horse and 
registering both pure-breds and colts from Arab sires but 
out of mares of other breeding. Arabian horses are now 
eligible for registration in the American Stud-book and in 
the General Stud-book of Great Britain.

Bars AND TurK Horses 
By Carl W. Gay 
171. The Barb horse takes his name from his native 
habitat, the so-called Barbary states of nothern Africa, 
originally peopled by the Berber tribes. These states are 
Morocco, Algeria, Tunis and Tripoli. The Barb is the 
“ Horse of the Sahara,” of Daumas, the “ North African ”” 
or “ Libyan” horse of Ridgeway. The oriental group is 
composed of the Barb, the Turk and the Arabian, although 
most recent investigations indicate the Barb to have been 
the real source of all oriental blood. A common error re- 
sulting in much confusion is the use of the term Arabian 
in a sense synonymous with oriental. 
172. History in Egypt. — History first records the horse 
under domestication in Egypt, and it is thought that his
-P-A-G-E-175
4 
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 145 
general distribution throughout the civilized world, which 
took place largely through the agency of the conquests of 
nations, was made from this center. Such an indefi- 
nite beginning is given a more satisfactory explanation 
by the modern researches reported by Ridgeway, which 
he maintains are strongly suggestive that the Egyptians 
secured their horses from Libya, where they are thought 
to have been indigenous. This hypothesis has a striking 
significance in view of the fact that the Libyan horse of 
Ridgeway is identical with the subject of this discussion. 
Zoblogically, there have been demonstrated three dis- 
tinct species of horses in the genus Equus besides the 
various species of asses, zebras and the extinct quagga. 
To these, Ridgeway adds Equus caballus libyeus, held by 
him to be a distinct species or at least a sub-species. This 
being the case, we are justified in accepting the Barb as the 
progenitor of all modern light breeds, the Turk and Arabian 
being derivatives, and not antecedents of the Barb. It is 
known that horses existed in Egypt 1500 years before 
they were in Arabia, a fact that is contrary to the popular 
belief that the genesis of all good horses was in Arabia. It 
establishes the Barb as the real origin of the Thoroughbred, 
the blood influence of which is recognized in all horse- 
breeding countries. Furthermore, in view of the fact that 
the Andalusian horse of Spain traces its ancestry across 
the Mediterranean, the Barb becomes an important 
factor in the horse population of America. 
173. History in America. — The most notable oriental 
horses brought to America are Grand Bashaw, a Barb from 
Tripoli, whose immediate descendants founded the Clay, 
Patchen and Bashaw families; Zilcaadi, an Arabian from 
Turkey, and sire of the dam of Gold Dust ; and Leopard, 
an Arab,'and Linden Tree, a Barb, presented to General 
L 
   
-P-A-G-E-176
146 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Grant and used by Randolph Huntington in his creation 
of the Clay Arabian. Most important of recent importa- 
tions are those of Homer Davenport, the most conspicuous 
individual of which is Haleb (Fig. 21). 
174 Description. — The Barb is. fourteen to fifteen 
hands in height, short of body in proportion to length of 
limb, his whole form being conducive to speed. The 
head is beautifully proportioned, with a neat ear, broad, 
full forehead, large, clear, prominent eye, flashing fire and 
yet expressing intelligence, a deep jowl with open angle, 
a trim muzzle and a nostril thin at the margin, capable of 
great dilation and continually in play. The head is nicely 
set on a rather long, high-crested neck, well cut-out in the 
throttle and giving the head a lofty carriage; shoulders 
well laid-in and sloping, well set-up at the withers; deep, 
well-arched rib; somewhat drooping croup, although the 
tail is carried high; straight hind-leg, long pasterns and 
rather deep, narrow feet of the most superior texture of 
horn. 
The prevailing colors in Barbary are dark bay, brown, 
chestnut, black and gray. Ridgeway concurs with other 
authors in his conclusions that bay with some white mark- 
ings, as a star or a blaze, together with white coronets, was 
the original color of the pure Barb. He reasons that the 
rigid course of selection which modern, scientific breeding 
has established for the improvement of the race is, inciden- * 
tally, gradually eliminating all but bays and allied browns 
and chestnuts, and indicates the final exclusion of all but 
the bays. Statistics regarding the winners of the prin- 
cipal racing events bear out this conclusion. Thus, as the 
“blood tells,” the bay color predominates. ; 
175. Use of the Barb. — Some idea of the extent to 
which the oriental blood has proved a potent factor in the
-P-A-G-E-177
   THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 147 
“foundation or improvement of modern breeds may be had 
from a review of the origin of some of them. The term 
ofiental is used in this connection for the reason that 
earlier writers were not specific in their references to 
Barbs, Turks or Arabians. The Darley Arabian, Byerly 
Turk and Godolphin Barb, with the “ Barb mares,” have 
been called the real foundation of the Thoroughbred. The 
Percheron owes his origin to the mating of oriental horses, 
left by the Saracens or brought back by the Crusaders, 
with native French mares of the Flemish blood. Subse- 
quently, there were made at intervals systematic top crosses 
of blood from the Orient. Gallipoli and Godolphin were 
two of the most important of these, and the former is re- 
garded as the most influential sire in the history of the - 
breed. The prototype of the Hackney, the Norfolk 
trotter, was the result of a Barb union with the Black 
trotter of Friesland. The Cleveland Bay was the product 
of a Barb-Yorkshire cart horse cross. The hot blood of the 
desert is mentioned in connection with the origin of the 
German coach horse. Bars Ist, progenitor of the 
Russian Orloff trotter, was three generations removed 
from Smetanka, a gray Arabian taken into Russia. The 
Prussian Trakehner is derived from an admixture of 
oriental and Thoroughbred blood with the native stock. 
176. Importance of the Barb. — The importance of the - 
Barb is a matter of history, although it is only recently 
that there has been available much reliable data concern- 
ing him. Much of the early literature has been more or 
less obscured in mythology and superstition. 
A study of the origin of each of the breeds of horses 
shows that there were two original sources from which 
the foundation blood of each breed was drawn. These 
were the Wild Black horse of Flanders, thought to have
-P-A-G-E-178
148 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
been indigenous to central Europe from the Rhine river 
to the Black sea, and characterized by his great scale, 
grossness, slow awkward movement, sluggish lymphatic 
temperament, black color and extreme development of 
hair; and the oriental horse, native to the desert regions 
of northern Africa, Turkey, Asia Minor, Persia and Arabia, 
the most notable characteristics of which were extreme 
refinement and breediness, beauty of form, spirit and in- 
telligence, speed, stamina and grace of movement, and an 
active nervous temperament. The breeds of the heavier, 
draftier type show a preponderance of the characters of 
the former, while those of the lighter, speed type re- 
semble more closely the latter. The so-called coach 
breeds represent a more or less proportionate blending of 
» the two. 
177. Organizations and records. — Barbs are registered 
in the Algerian Stud-book, a book of record formerly 
recognized by the United States Department of Agricul- 
ture. It is said that the number of English and French 
horses in Algeria has led to the Barb being more exten- 
sively crossed with this blood than in Morocco, where 
there are fewer foreign horses, and systematic efforts have 
been made under the direction of the Sultan to keep the 
blood pure. Some Barbs are also registered with Arabians 
in the General Stud-book of Great Britain. 
178. The Turk horse. — This horse, named with the 
Barb and the Arabian as constituting the so-called oriental 
group, has much less significance than either of his contem- 
poraries. Sanders suggests that the horses of Arabia and 
Persia were originally derived from Turkey. In the light 
of recent investigations we are led to conclude that the 
term Turk does not imply any particular stock, but desig- 
nates merely the horses of Turkey. These have been of
-P-A-G-E-179
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 149 
a different character at, different periods. The originals, 
called Turcoman, were probably offshoots from the pony 
types native to the mountainous districts of southern Asia. 
They were first reported in Turkestan, but became gen- 
erally distributed later in Turkish Asia and Persia; there 
are few horses in Turkey in Europe. These original ponies 
do not represent the Turk as he is referred to in recent 
times, however. Their type has been so completely modi- 
fied by the Arabians with which they have been crossed 
as to leave little evidence of their former characteristics. ° 
However, plain heads with Roman noses, ewe necks, light 
middles and long legs are still noticeable, and are charged 
to the Turcoman foundation. These modified Turkish 
horses are of fair size, bay, black or gray in color, with 
uniform white markings. In those parts of Turkey 
nearest the Arabian border, many pure Arabians are found. 
Captain Hayes reports that the horses in ordinary use in 
Turkish towns at the present time are small, hardy ani- 
mals, gray or bay in color, and are produced by Arabian 
stallions out of Kurdistan pony mares, the latter being 
similar to the Turcoman ponies already referred to, and 
typical of the horses indigenous to Turkey. Probably 
the best Turks, so-called, were not Turks at all, but Ara- 
bians or Barbs.

179. The Hunter, as bred in America, cannot yet be 
called a breed of horses. The Irish Hunter, however, has 
been recognized as a distinct breed for a hundred years or 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
150 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
more. The Hunter has been developed in Ireland as the 
result of a demand for horses with Thoroughbred or saddle 
conformation, that were able to carry much more weight 
than the pure-bred Thoroughbred. Ireland, therefore, 
may be said to be the home of the Hunter, or where this 
type of horse has been bred for so many years that it has 
long since been classed as a distinct breed, and recognized 
as such at all the fairs and horse-shows in Great Britain. 
180. History. — The breeding of Hunters in America 
* has hardly progressed far enough in any one section of the 
country to distinguish such animals as “ pure-bred.””. _How- 
ever, a great many animals are yearly bred in this country 
for the special purpose of producing Hunters. The method 
of breeding is the same as originally adopted in Ireland, 
namely, the use of Thoroughbred stallions on native or 
grade mares. The breeders of Hunters are usually able 
to produce, even in the first cross, saddle conformation, 
and at the same time to have transmitted to such a cross 
sufficient of the courage, intelligence and staying qualities 
of the Thoroughbred to make the first cross (half-blood) a 
most satisfactory animal for cross-country riding to hounds. 
The fact that those half-, three-quarter- and seven-eighth- 
blood horses make such satisfactory Hunters is probably 
the reason why, in this country, there has been no general 
movement in any one section to continue special breeding. 
However, a great many clean-bred horses are favored by 
many persons for cross-country work. This special line 
of breeding has not been followed long enough for the breed 
to become fixed. In fact, the demand for such horses has 
always exceeded the supply in America to such an extent 
that the type has never had an opportunity to become 
thoroughly established. Nevertheless, there has been a 
National Steeple Chase and Hunt Association organized
-P-A-G-E-181
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 151 ' 
in America under the auspices of the Jockey Club, that 
admits to register almost any animal with one or more 
crosses of Thoroughbred blood, that has been regularly 
“hunted ” a certain number of times, with some recog- 
nized pack of hounds, and approved by the master. 
Hunter-breeding in America is conducted to a limited 
extent in the neighborhood of most of the organized hunt 
clubs, of which there are some fifty in the eastern states. 
In such sections one will find one to half a dozen Thorough- 
bred stallions in general use among the farmers of that 
special community. In the Genesee valley in Livingston 
county, New York, for example, there are no less than 
eight Thoroughbred stallions within a radius of fifteen 
miles, being used on the farm mares of the neighborhood 
for the special purpose of breeding Hunters. Virginia 
probably produces more animals that are especially bred 
for hunting than any other state. Of late years, however, 
the Jockey Club has put out many Thoroughbred stallions 
throughout the state of New York. Hitherto, Canada 
has been one of the principal sources from which American 
hunting men have been supplied. The Canadian Hunters 
come largely from between Toronto and London, Ontario, 
where Thoroughbred stallions have been very generally 
used. 
181. Description. — The Hunter should not be high- 
headed, and the longer the rein the better. The fore-hand 
should be light. The withers should be higher than the 
croup, and the bones of the fore-limb comparatively long, 
so as to be able efficiently to raise the fore-hand both in 
taking and landing. The shoulders and pasterns should 
be long and sloping. The muscles that lie above the fore- 
arm should be well developed, as the fore-arm straightens 
the shoulder joint and the latter straightens the elbow
-P-A-G-E-182
  
  \ 
152 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
joint, two actions which help to prevent the horse falling 
when he lands over a jump. The muscles over the loins 
behind the saddle should be particularly strong. The 
hocks should be large and gaskins broad. 
The following is a detailed description of the points of an 
ideal Hunter: Head. —Ears fine, not too large, approach- 
ing each other at the tips, when thrown forward ; cranium 
broad and nicely rounded ; forehead flat and broad; eyes 
wide apart, prominent and bold in expression ; nasal bones 
straight in front, but slightly dished on lateral surfaces ; 
nostrils firm, large and flexible, of large capacity when the 
animal is excited ; lips firm, mouth medium-sized ; muzzle 
small and tapering; cheeks well but not too heavily 
clothed with hard, well-developed muscles; branches of 
lower jaw well spread apart at their angles. Neck. — 
Clean-cut and rangy ; crest well developed and whipcordy, 
but not so heavy as in other classes ; head well attached to 
neck in a graceful, angular manner; jugular gutter well 
developed. Withers. — Well developed, high, and not 
too wide on top. The withers should be sloping and of 
such form that the saddle may be placed well back over the 
center of gravity, which is especially desirable in negotiat- 
ing timber. Shoulders. — Long and oblique, so as to give 
easy action; shoulder-blades well covered with muscles. 
Chest. — Deep, giving good girths, with a well-filled breast. 
Arm.— Thrown well forward, so as to give an oblique shoul- 
der. Forearm. — Long, well developed and strong, well 
clothed with hard, well-developed muscles, having grooves 
of demarcation between them, showing the outlines of 
each individual muscle. Knee.— Clean, straight, large 
and strong in all directions, the bone forming the back part 
being somewhat prominent. Knee to fetlock joint. — 
Cannon short, broad, flat and clean; tendons standing
-P-A-G-E-183
THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 153 
out plainly, hard and whipcordy. The lines of demarca- 
tion between tendon and ligament, and between ligament 
and bone, must be well supported beneath the knee, not 
showing any tendency to weakness. Fetlocks. — Strong 
and well supported. Front pastern.— Strong, medium 
length and oblique. Front feet. — Rather smaller in pro- 
portion than in horses of other breeding, round, strong and __ 
fairly deep wall; soles concave, frog well developed ; heels 
full and not too deep; toes turning neither in nor out while 
standing. Body. — Back strong and inclined to be short, 
with a long under-line ; loin broad and well muscled ; ribs 
well sprung and of good depth. The under-line must be 
long, otherwise the horse will be shortened in his gait. To 
get this long under-line, perhaps a longer back will be 
required than would otherwise be desirable. Crowp. — 
Well muscled, carried out straight to tail, which should be 
full haired and very stylishly carried. Hock.— Deep and 
strong in all directions; all points well developed, but not 
rough; absence of malformations or puffiness; point very 
well developed, straight on posterior border; the whole 
joint clean, hard and of an angular shape. Hock to fet- 
lock. — Cannon short, wider and flatter than in front; 
tendons well marked individually, and must not have a 
pinched appearance below joint in front, but very gradu- 
ally taper in width from hock to fetlock. Fetlock joint. — 
Large, clean-cut and strong. Hind pasterns. — Medium 
length, sloping and strong. Hind-feet. — Smaller and not 
so round as the front ones; sole more concave; frog well 
developed ; heel good width and not too deep. Color. — 
Bay, brown, chestnut, black, roan and gray; with reason- 
able modifications. Skin and hair.—Skin soft, mellow and 
loose, hair fine, silky and straight. Temperament. — Mild, 
energetic, not vicious nor too nervous. Action. — Prompt, 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
154 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
    
    
    
                      free and elastic, not too much knee and hock action, but 
going close to the ground, especially in the canter and 
gallop; no paddle or roll, and feet not to go close 
enough to interfere; a good straightaway walker. 
Weight. — 1000 to 1300 pounds. Height. —15 hands 
1 inch to 16 hands and over (Fig. 22). 
  Fig. 22.— Heavy-weight Hunter. 
182. Classes. — At the leading horse-shows there are 
several classes for Hunters of different types and different 
weight-carrying abilities. Qualified Hunters are those 
that have been registered with the National Steeple Chase 
and Hunt Association, but need not be clean bred. 
Heavy-weight Hunters must carry up to 200 pounds to 
hounds (qualified and not qualified). Middle-weight 
Hunters must carry up to 180 pounds to hounds (qualified 
and not qualified). Light-weight Hunters must carry up 
to 165 pounds to hounds (qualified and not qualified). 
Thoroughbred Hunters must be registered in the stud-book. 
183. Uses.— The Hunter should not have more than 
three or four days of all-day fox-hunting in a fortnight ; 
with drags, some may go three times a week, but much 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
     THE SADDLE BREEDS OF HORSES 155 
depends on the going and the length of the runs. The 
Hunter should be jogged home after the hunt, given warm 
gruel and thoroughly rubbed. A groom should exercise 
him gently on non-hunting days for about five miles early 
in the morning. He should be carefully looked after and 
given the best of oats and hay. The night before he is to 
be “ hunted,” water should be kept in his stall all night, 
so that he may take it at will. He should be fed very 
early and saddled only just before he is ordered. 
184. Steeple-chasers. — The Steeple-chaser is almost al- 
ways a clean-bred horse, that has natural or made adapta- 
bility to jump. He must be more seasoned than the 
Thoroughbred that is to run on the flat, and must be up 
to a good deal more weight. There are certain blood 
lines that have produced natural jumpers, which, when 
“nicked” with certain mares, have produced fencers. 
Many horses that, perhaps, have not enough speed for 
the flat, have been schooled and made good chasers. Un- 
like the steady fox-hunting Hunter, the Steeple-chaser 
must be able to go a good pace and take his fences flying, 
or almost as fast as ina hurdle race. In this type of horse, 
the adaptability for the special performance and the result 
gives the horse his place and name as a Steeple- 
chaser. 
185. Distribution. — As hunting has long occupied a 
place in the sports of nations, horses that may be charac- 
terized as Hunters are widely distributed. From Ireland, 
the home of the breed, the Hunter has been scattered over 
Great Britain and the continent. In 1904, the Dutch gov- 
ernment bought 350 young mares of this breed in Ireland. 
In America, both Canada and the United States are de- 
voting increasing attention to the production of horses for 
hunting purposes.
-P-A-G-E-186
156 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
186. Organizations and records. — In Great Britain, 
the interests of the breed are in the hands of the Hunter 
Improvement Society of Great Britain. Two volumes of 
the Hunter Stud-book have been published and a third is in 
preparation. The pedigree qualifications of the Hunter 
Stud-book are that the stallions shall be by a Thoroughbred 
or registered Hunter sire out of a fully registered mare, and 
the mares shall show. two crosses of Thoroughbred or 
registered Hunter blood, viz., sire and dam’s sire, or if 
dams of winners of races under rules, and accepted after 
inspection. The supplement of the stud-book is open to 
mares (1) by a Thoroughbred or registered Hunter sire, 
winners or dams of winners of prizes or medals at national, 
county or associated shows, or (2) by inspection and veteri- 
nary examination. In America, the Jockey Club, with 
headquarters in New York City, was instrumental in the 
organization of the National Steeple Chase and Hunt As- 
sociation, which registers and otherwise looks after the 
development of the Hunter and the Steeple-chaser. 
Literature. —The literature of the Hunter is for the most part 
interwoven with expositions of the chase, and is not specific and 
direct. Yet some direct discussions will be found in the works 
referred to on page 416. Other references are: Peer, Cross Country 
with Horse and Hound; Walsh, The Horse in the Stable and in 
the Field, London (1871); Goodwin, The Turf Guides; Nimrod, 
The Chase, the Road, and the Turf; Whyte, The History of the British 
Turf, two volumes, London (1840); Curzon, A Mirror of the Turf, 
London (1892).

CHAPTER V 
THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 
By S. B. Elliot 
Pontes are fourteen hands two inches or under, and 
all equine breeds in which that limit is not exceeded are 
classed as pony breeds. All diminutive equines are 
characterized by being especially close and full made 
with an apparent ruggedness expressed in the unusual 
bone and muscular development which they possess. 
AmerIcAN Pontss. Fig. 23. 
187. The dividing line between the horse and the 
pony was vague and undefined until the Hackney Horse 
Society was established in England in 1883. All horses 
measuring fourteen hands or under were then designated 
ponies, and registered in a separate part of the stud-book. 
This standard of height was accepted and officially rec- 
ognized by leading agricultural and horse-show societies 
in England, and subsequently in America. In 1905, the 
American Hackney Horse Society increased the height 
of ponies to fourteen hands one inch, and in the case of 
polo ponies the limit of height had previously been raised 
to fourteen hands two inches, which is now the generally 
accepted pony standard. 
Adverse climatic conditions, promiscuous breeding 
' and privation have had much to do with the development

158 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
of most breeds of ponies. Distinct types of ponies are 
found in almost every country, the chief types being the 
Arab and his near allies, the Turks, Barbs and Persians, 
the Mongolian, Japanese, Korean, Burma and Manipuri 
pony, Sumatra and Java pony, Russian, Scandinavian or 
Norwegian pony, the Celtic or pony of Iceland, the ponies 
of the British Isles, and, in America, the ponies of the 
western states. While some of these, perhaps, are only 
of remote interest in America at present, it has been 
thought best to discuss most of them briefly. 
188. Use and value of the pony.— The usefulness 
and value of the pony is just beginning to be appreciated 
in America. Ponies cost much less to feed, consume less 
and thrive on rougher food than the large horse, and they 
will travel as far; many, in fact, will outdistance the 
large horse. The thirteen-hand pony will do a horse’s 
work on half his feed and requires less attendance. 
Ponies have better feet, legs and wind, and are less sus- 
ceptible to disease than large horses. They stand more 
hardship, recover more quickly from fatigue and live 
longer. They have, moreover, much greater intelligence, 
and for this reason are much less likely to take fright at 
objects on the road. 
The principal cause of the marked superiority in con- 
stitution of the present-day pony over the horse, and 
of his greater intelligence, is accounted for by his having 
to shift for himself on the hills and wastes, and this 
hardiness and intelligence is transmitted to generations 
born in domestication. The horse reared in captivity 
with everything done for his comfort, has not the same 
toughness as the pony; no demand is made on his intel- 
ligence, and his mental faculties remain, to a great ex- 
tent, undeveloped. In the pony, unsoundness of wind  
-P-A-G-E-189
ERPS ee MTS OR ene Ree ae eon a Meee a pea Ce eRe r Te ray VL ee eer ar 
THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 159 
or limb is almost unknown. For generations ponies 
have been accustomed to pick their way up and down 
stony precipitous hillsides. Their feet and legs conse- 
quently are of the very best, and they are remarkably 
sure-footed. 
History of horses in warfare is replete with accounts 
of the endurance of ponies and their ability to thrive on 
poor and scanty food. Sir Walter Gilbey, in “ Ponies, 
Past and Present,” gives an interesting account. Sir ri 
Teddy, a twelve-hand pony, raced with the London mail 
coach to Exeter, a distance of 172 miles. He was led 
between two horses all the way, and carried no rider, 
performing the journey in 23 hours and 20 minutes, beat- 
ing the coach by 59 minutes. J.C. Appleby, in his. book, 
“Nimrod,” mentions the fact that during the drawing of 
the Irish lottery the news was conveyed by express from 
Holyhead to London, chiefly by ponies, at the rate of 
nearly twenty miles an hour. Mr. Whyte, in his “ His- 
tory of the British Turf,” gives an account of a thirteen- 
hand three-inch mare belonging to Mr. Daniel Crocker, 
that in April, 1754, traveled 300 miles on Newmarket 
Heath in 64 hours and 20 minutes, which was 7 hours and 
40 minutes better than the time for which she had been 
backed to perform the journey; namely, 72 hours. On 
one of the days, Tuesday, April 23, she went 108 miles; 
the day before and the day after she covered 96 miles, 
each day. She was ridden by a boy who weighed 65 
pounds, and this did not include saddle and bridle. In 
our own country there are many accounts of endurance 
of western ponies. 
Nor is it only in endurance that the pony excels. His 
greater stamina is also evidenced in his length of life. 
The following instances in which ponies have attained
-P-A-G-E-190
  160 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
to great age are cited by Sir Walter Gilbey: “Mr. Ed- 
mund F. Deane, of Gaulstown Co., Westmeath, lost a 
pony in December, 1894, which had reached the age of 
39 years; in 1896, Mrs. Pratt, of Low Pond House, Be- 
dale, Yorks, lost a pony mare aged 45 years; on Christ- 
mas Day, 1863, there died at Silworthy, near Clovelly 
in North Devon, a pony that had arrived within a few 
weeks of his sixtieth year. Accounts of ponies which 
lived, and in some cases worked, until they reached 40, 
38, 37 and 35 years also recur to mind.” 
Ponies in America are used chiefly for children’s pur- 
poses and for playing polo. In Europe, in England 
particularly, they serve a much greater variety of pur- 
poses. Some are worked in coal mines, but a great 
many more are put to use above ground. Green 
grocers, fish mongers, market men, small merchants, all 
employ them for delivery purposes. Country gentlemen, 
doctors, land agents, in fact all persons having occasion 
to travel, depend upon ponies a great deal. There is good 
reason for stating that ponies could be used to far greater 
advantage in America than they are at present. For 
light work they could be utilized in many places instead of 
large horses at a considerable saving. Ponies in America, 
the western ponies in particular, have long been availed 
of for saddle purposes, but ponies as a first mount for 
children are just beginning to be appreciated. 
189. The polo pony. — The increasing popularity of 
polo is attracting much attention to mounts suitable for 
playing the game. Polo originally was an oriental game, 
being the national game of the Manipuri, from whom the 
Europeans first learned it. It was introduced into India 
proper in 1864, and was played in England by 
the officers of the 10th Hussars in the year 1872, on 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 161 
their return from service in India. It is now played in 
France and other parts of Europe, and is becoming very 
popular in America. The best type of mounts for playing 
the game is scarce and very costly. 
The mount that is in such demand and brings such a 
high price, is really not a pony but a small horse. He 
does not necessarily belong to any distinct breed, and is 
generally the result of 
a cross. The regula- 
tion height has been 
raised to fifteen hands. 
He must be a powerful, 
speedy, sound, handy 
animal, with great stay- 
ing power and courage, 
high in front, with 
sweeping shoulders and 
good strong hocks. ‘The Fia. 23.— Polo pony. 
necessary speed and 
courage are rarely found except in those ponies that have 
a preponderance of race-horse blood in their veins. He 
must be able to carry 160 to 200 pounds’ weight, make 
incessant turns, twists and stops at full speed, and make 
short spurts of hard galloping, all of which take more 
out of a pony than would a race out of a race horse 
(Fig. 23). 
The Thoroughbred race horse has the speed and cour- 
age, but rarely the strong hind-quarters and the power 
necessary to enable him to stop quickly and turn sharply 
at the gallop. The Arab, while having great staying 
power, is rarely sufficiently speedy; and the Mustang 
has not the speed or the courage to make a good polo 
mount, even if he had the other qualifications. The best 
  M 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
162 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
polo mount seems to be one that is three-quarters Thor- 
oughbred.. As laid down by E. D. Miller ‘in his book, 
“ Modern Polo,” the polo mount should be a Thoroughbred 
out of a mare by a Thoroughbred; that is, it should 
be three-quarters Thoroughbred race horse. . 
In America, the mounts used to play the game are secured 
chiefly from the West, and the demand for mounts here is 
not yet anything like what it is in England. The supply 
is entirely inadequate to meet the demand, and polo 
mounts are sought for the English market not only in 
America, including Canada, Mexico and Argentina, but 
in every corner of the horse-breeding world,— Egypt, 
Syria, Barbary, Russia, France, Persia and South Africa. 
‘ While the mounts thus secured are not equal in speed, 
endurance or courage to the English or American race 
horse, the best, when trained and fitted, command very 
high prices. The prices may be said to range anywhere 
from $300 to $3000. In fact, there is no limit to the 
price, as those who play the game are, as a rule, men of 
means to whom a really good animal is cheap at any 
price. The exacting qualifications, however, make first- 
class polo mounts rare. 
Breeding polo mounts at present is somewhat of an 
experiment and presents many difficulties, the chief 
being the limit of height. All breeding of horses goes 
to prove the impossibility of insuring the progeny of any 
given size. In America, the western pony mare is bred 
to small Thoroughbred stallions, and in a very few cases 
to Arabian horses. In England, to keep the size down, 
pure pony blood as foundation stock is being used to 
found a breed of polo mounts, the fillies being bred back 
to stallions of the same breed as their sires, the produce 
of which will be three-quarters Thoroughbred. ‘The   
-P-A-G-E-193
THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 1638 
Thoroughbred race horse of late years has been increas- 
ing in height and small ones are likely to be only runts 
whose produce is likely to exceed the limit in height. 
The Arab in many ways is desirable, as he has the consti- 
tution, the endurance and the strength, but not the speed. 
The Arab, moreover, is more likely to be of the right size, 
and by reason of his great antiquity and the fixed char- 
acter of the breed, he impresses more certainly and more 
markedly his likeness on his stock than any other breed. 
There is generally a good demand for ponies that 
have been discarded from the game because of defi- 
ciency in speed, courage or other essential qualifica- 
tions. They make good hacks and often good saddle 
ponies for children and young persons. The pony 
Battledor (Fig. 23), with her fore-legs bandaged, as in 
playing the game, is a type of light-weight western polo 
mount. 
A polo pony. stud-book has been started in England, 
and there is every reason to suppose that one will be 
started in this country in the near future. 
' 190. The Mustang. — The ponies of the western states 
of America, the Mustangs, are in the case of those of the 
southwestern states apparently of Moorish origin, com- 
ing into this country by way of Mexico and having 
been brought over originally by the Spaniards. To 
these ponies the term Bronco is often applied, which is 
derived from the Spanish word “ bronco,” meaning rough 
or wild. The pony of the northwestern states and 
Canada, termed Indian pony, appears to be of Norman 
origin, although often these two breeds are more or less 
mixed. Very many of the small horses at the present 
time in the western part of the United States have been 
crossed more or less with the American trotter, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
164 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Thoroughbred or the Arabian horses. These still 
are known as Broncos, although in recent years they are 
more commonly termed “ cow ponies,” from the use that 
is made of them in herding and driving cattle on the 
ranges. 
191. The Bronco. — The Broncos, like all horses in a 
semi-wild state, have good constitutions, and the best 
of feet, but because of inbreeding and want of selection, 
they may not be good in general conformation. “In 
general, the Bronco is an exceedingly hardy, wiry little 
horse, possessed of considerable endurance. In the best 
types the head is small, clean-cut and refined, with 
bright, piercing eyes, small ears and attractive appear- 
ance, although many individuals have ill-formed heads. 
The neck of the better class is of medium length, well 
crested and very well carried. The body is short, deep 
and muscular. Broncos are frequently ridden day 
after day for weeks at a time, without shoes, over the 
rough, rocky soil, carrying a heavy man and a cumbersome 
stock saddle (Plate V). They weigh approximately 
850 pounds, and are possessed of enormous strength for 
their size and weight.” (W. L. Carlyle.) 
These ponies of the Southwest, as a rule, do not exceed 
thirteen and one-half or fourteen hands in height unless 
cross-bred. Some of them are handsome, graceful crea- 
tures, but they do not compare favorably with the best 
American horses, or with imported European ponies, nor 
are they as good as the more northern Indian pony. 
They stand a great deal of hard work, however, and if 
broken young, can be made very serviceable. It is 
to be regretted that this race of exceedingly useful and 
picturesque animals is decreasing, as a result of the demand 
for a larger and more fleet horse by the cowmen. which
-P-A-G-E-195
   THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 165 
is met by crossing with Standardbred and Thoroughbred 
sires. The Bronco in the wild state can be ridden down 
and captured without much difficulty by good, domestic 
horses, even when carrying the weight of a rider, if 
it can be approached sufficiently close to allow any- 
thing like equality in the start. 
192. The Indian pony.— The pony of the northern 
states and northwest Canada is a better animal than 
that of the southern states, although often they are inter- 
bred. The northern pony rarely exceeds thirteen hands, 
almost never fourteen, unless he is cross-bred, and is 
more compact, better ribbed up and a better boned pony 
than the Bronco. He is short in barrel and strong in 
limb, has very good feet, heavy mane and tail, and 
often considerable hair on his legs, all of which would 
seem to indicate his Norman origin. These ponies are 
very hardy, and, while not fast, will cover long distances 
with ease. They are, moreover, more intelligent, have 
better dispositions and display more courage than the 
Bronco. 
193. Use of Broncos and Indian ponies. —In the 
West these ponies are used for saddle purposes, espe- 
cially for cow-herding, although they are fast being re- 
placed by better horses. Ponies of both types are brought 
East and used in cities in delivery wagons and for light 
driving purposes, or as saddle ponies. The best of them 
are sometimes used as polo mounts. They are not bred, 
as a rule, except in the western states on large ranches, 
it being more profitable to raise other breeds of. horses 
or ponies in the eastern states, where the cost of feed 
is high. These ponies are used as foundation stock 
from which to breed a more improved type of pony or 
horse, the mares being bred to Hackneys, trotting, car-

riage, Thoroughbred and Arabian stallions, often with 
a view to getting polo mounts. It is difficult, however, 
to get any pony or horse of much value from one cross. 
194. Other American ponies. — Aside from the Mus- 
tangs of the western states, there are in North America 
the Sable Island ponies, the ponies found on the’ coasts 
of the South Atlantic states, and the Creole ponies of 
Louisiana. 
The Sable Island ponies rarely find their way into the 
United States, principally because of the duty. They 
are few in number and run wild, and are not so good as 
some other breeds from which selection can be had on the 
British islands. The Sable is a small pony much like the 
Celtic. 
Ponies of the South Atlantic states. —'The ponies found 
along the coast of the South Atlantic states have been 
known to exist there for many years. They are appar- 
ently of Spanish origin, although somewhat smaller than 
the ponies of the western states. Little effort has been 
made to improve them and they are not superior in any 
way to the Mustangs. They are most numerous on the 
island of Chincoteague and commonly bear that name. 
The ponies of Louisiana, sometimes known as: the 
Creole ponies, also appear to be of Spanish origin. They 
are somewhat smaller and finer in bone than the ponies 
of the western states, but are little different in other 
respects.

195. Ponies have been known to exist in the British 
islands from the earliest times. They were there at the 
time of Julius Cxsar’s conquest and he spoke highly of
-P-A-G-E-197
THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 167 
them. The ponies of the west of England are said to 
have been brought there by the Phcenicians when they 
came to trade for tin. The ponies of the northern part 
of the British Isles, including the Shetlands, have many 
characteristics in common with the Scandinavian pony, 
and were probably introduced by the Scandinavian in- 
vaders some time prior to the fifteenth century. 
The principal ponies of the British Isles are the Hackney, 
Welsh, Exmoor and Dartmoor, Westmorland (Fig. 27), 
New Forest, the Scotch ponies, the Connemara or pony 
of Ireland and the Shetland pony. The last is discussed 
first because of its relative importance in America. 
196. The Shetland pony. — The Shetland, the smallest 
of all ponies, is in many ways the most important 
in America. While in England and other countries he 
has been used extensively in the coal mines, in America 
his use is practically restricted to that of children, and 
as a child’s pony he has no equal. Children and Shet- 
land ponies seem to have for each other a natural affinity. 
Every child desires a pony, and as a considerable propor- 
tion of Americans have the means to gratify their chil- 
dren in such a desire, the Shetland pony is in great demand. 
It is imported in considerable numbers, and many are 
bred here. There are also many in America that are 
cross-bred. 
The Shetland islands are situated to the north of Scot- 
land, from which they are separated by about 150 to 200 
miles of very rough and dangerous sea. There are some 
120 islands, many' of which are uninhabited, merely 
affording pasturage for a few sheep or ponies. The exist- 
ence of two or three distinct types of* ponies on private 
estates has given rise to the untrue statement that a more 
or less distinct typé of the Shetland exists on each of 
   
-P-A-G-E-198
168 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
several of the Islands. There are no trees nor shrubs 
on the Islands, the surface being a succession of hills of 
rock formation with peat and decayed vegetable matter 
in the basins and a light covering of soil on which heather 
and scanty grass grow, affording the only pasturage for 
the ponies. : 
Although far to the north, the climate is greatly moder- 
ated by the surrounding waters of the Gulf Stream. There 
is consequently much mist and precipitation of moisture, 
that accounts largely for the Shetland’s very long, fine 
hair, which in wet weather mats and is almost waterproof. 
This heavy coat is the Shetland’s only protection against 
the inclement weather, as it is not housed, but is born, 
lives and dies in the fields, the hillsides and stone walls 
being the only shelter from the winds that are constantly 
blowing, and which in winter are very penetrating. 
197. History of the Shetland pony. — Ponies have 
been known in the Shetland islands from the earliest 
times of which there is record. From the finding of the 
Bressay stone recently, there appears to be good evidence 
that they were there prior to the Norwegian invasion in 
872. According to some early writers, the Scandinavian 
invaders introduced the foundation stock prior to the 
fifteenth century. 
The government returns for 1891 gave the number of 
horses, which included ponies, in the Islands as 4803, 
but because of the demand of recent years the ponies are 
steadily decreasing. While on a tour of the Islands in 
1906, the writer made a careful estimate of the number 
of ponies, and could not account for over 4000 of all 
ages and sexes, and he doubts whether there are much 
over 400 foals produced on the Islands annually. In 
America there have been registered in the stud-book 
. 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
      THE PONY BRELLS OF HORSES 
about 16,000 of these ponies, and as the stud-book has been 
open for about thirty-four years, this number includes 
those that have died in that time. The Shetland pony 
may be considered to be comparatively rare. 
198. Description of the Shetland pony. — The limit 
of height established by the Shetland Pony Stud-book 
Society is ten hands two inches. Ponies over this height 
cannot be registered, 
although in America 
the Shetland Pony 
Club has __ increased 
the height to eleven 
hands two __ inches. 
The average height 
of the pure Shetland 
may be said to be nine 
to ten hands. The 
size is more or less a ; 
result of the feed, and Fre, 24,—Shetland stallion. 
when food is supplied 
in abundance there is a gradual increase in size in succes- 
sive generations. This increase is less apparent in highly 
bred ponies. The weight of mature Shetlands should ap- 
proximate 325 to 375 pounds, for ponies of average height. 
The best specimens are compact in build, having deep 
body, heavy muscular quarters, short legs, short, broad 
back, deep, full chest, good bone, short, muscular neck, 
small head and ears, prominent eyes and a very docile 
disposition. In color, they are commonly brown, 
black and bay. There are other colors, such as dun, 
chestnut, gray and a few with white markings. Pie- 
balds are not considered desirable, although there is a 
demand for broken colors in America (Fig. 24). 
  .
-P-A-G-E-200
  170 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The coat of the Shetland pony is a revelation to those 
who are not familiar with him. The young ponies under 
two years of age, in particular, have very long, shaggy 
coats. Towards spring the hair loses its luster and has a 
very rusty, shabby appearance. Owing to the hair being 
very fine and matted, it is shed in patches, often hanging 
in taglocks, which makes the pony the very roughest and 
shaggiest little creature imaginable. Once he has shed, 
his coat is fine and glossy and he is much more active 
in his movements. The mane is generally heavy and 
long, and adds much to the attractiveness of a well-kept 
pony. 
The Shetland pony combines with the highest order of 
equine intelligence a disposition wonderfully free from , 
vice and trickiness. 
199. Uses of Shetland ponies.—In the Shetland 
islands, the ponies are used little. They are sometimes 
employed in carrying peat from the hills to the crofts, 
and are the most wonderful weight-carriers in the world, 
a nine-hand pony being able to carry a full-grown man 
over rough ground for some distance. 'They are wonder- 
fully hardy and will cover surprising distances. In the 
coal mines many of the ponies travel upwards of thirty 
miles a day, drawing a load of 1200 to 1400 pounds (on 
rails). In America, as has been said, the chief use of 
the Shetland is as a child’s pony and for light driving. 
Shetland ponies are very salable, the demand being usually 
in excess of the supply. The smaller sizes are most popu- 
lar in England, but not in America. They bring good 
prices, about as much at maturity as the average large 
horse, and are easy and inexpensive to raise. They break 
easily and are a constant source of usefulness and pleas- 
ure, as well as an ornament to any farm.

200. Feeding and care of Shetland ponies. —In the 
winter time, it is usual to feed the ponies. In May, they 
are turned on common pasture lands to shift for themselves. 
In the autumn, the ponies come down from the hills and 
feed on the patches of fresh grass which have been pre- 
served around the cultivated areas. In severe winters, 
when feed is scarce, they eat the seaweed. Contrary to 
the popular impression prevailing in America, the ponies 
do not run wild. They are all definitely owned and cared 
for more or less. There are few large herds. Most of the 
ponies are held by the crofters or farmers in small numbers. 
201. Organizations and records. — The American Shet- 
land Pony Club was organized in 1888. The office of 
its secretary is at Lafayette, Indiana. Thirteen vol- 
umes of the American Shetland Pony Stud-book have 
been issued, registering over sixteen thousand ponies. 
The Shetland Pony Stud-book Society, with the secretary 
at Aberdeen, Scotland, is the official organization of the 
breed in Scotland and Shetland. 
202. The Welsh pony. — The Welsh pony is more nu- 
merous than any other breed that comes from the British 
Isles. It is difficult to discover the exact number, as 
there appear to be no statistics on the subject. He 
wanders over the hills and waste-lands of all the twelve 
counties of Wales and also on the borders of Shropshire, 
Hereford and Monmouth. Inured from the earliest 
foalhood to the roughest and poorest pasturage, he is as 
sure-footed as the goat, has good shoulders, strong back, 
neat head and the best of legs and feet. Many of the 
best hunters in England trace their origin on the side of 
the dam to a Welsh mare. The breed has been improved 
from time to time by the introduction of superior alien 
blood, chiefly Thoroughbred, Arabian and Hackney. 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
172 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The Polo Pony Society makes two divisions of Welsh 
ponies, those of North Wales and those of South Wales. 
By the description given in Vol. 5 of the stud-book of this 
society, the ponies of North Wales do not exceed twelve 
hands two inches. This refers undoubtedly to the Welsh 
pony in a pure state, as the writer has seen many Welsh 
cobs bred in Wales from Welsh mares and Hackney 
stallions that were fourteen hands and over in height. 
The pony of North 
Wales has straight 
legs, well-set-on tail 
and good shoulders. 
The pony of the 
South Wales division 
seldom exceeds  thir- 
teen hands, and in a 
pure state is about 
twelve hands. The 
writer has seen many 
of them not over 
7 eleven hands. They 
Fra. 25.— Welsh stallion are likely to be low at 
the withers, and have 
faulty hind-quarters, the rump being steep and the hocks 
sickled, although these defects are being overcome by 
improved keep of the young ponies and better breeding. 
The color of the Welsh pony most preferred is bay or 
brown. Gray or black is allowable, but dun or broken 
color is considered objectionable. 
The strength and endurance of these Welsh ponies is 
remarkable. They have legs that work cannot seem to 
destroy, and have wonderful carrying power. It is not 
uncommon in Wales to see a man weighing upward of 
  ,
-P-A-G-E-203
THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 173 
200 pounds riding one of these little ponies. As a rule, 
they have good carriage and action, and make desirable 
ponies for children who have had some experience in horse- 
manship (Figs. 25, 26). In England, they are used largely 
as a hack and by tradesmen. There are breeders using 
this pony as a basis 
from which to breed 
polo mounts, crossing 
with small Thorough- 
bred or Arab stallions. 
In America, Welsh 
ponies are used princi- 
pally for’ children’s 
purposes. Many are 
imported and a num- 
ber are bred here. Now 
that the pony is becom- 
ing more popular, and the demand is increasing, the breed- 
ing of the Welsh pony should prove very profitable. 
The organization interested in the improvement of 
these ponies is the Welsh Pony and Cob Society, with 
headquarters at Greenfield, Penybont, Radnorshire, 
Wales. The American Welsh Pony and Cob Society, 
with headquarters at Lafayette, Indiana, has published 
one volume of its ret embracing nearly eight 
hundred entries. 
203. Exmoor and Hasta ponies. — The ponies 
from those districts in England known as Exmoor and 
Dartmoor are much fewer in number than most of the 
other breeds in the British Isles, and are rarely imported 
into this country. They range in height from eleven to 
thirteen hands two inches. The original color of the 
Exmoor was a buffish bay with mealy nose. It is supposed 
    Fria. 26.— Welsh pony mare.

to have been brought to England by the Phcenicians 
when they visited the shores of Cornwall to trade in tins 
and metals. 
Stud-book No. 5, of the Polo Pony Society, contains a 
description of the Exmoor pony. The average height is 
given as twelye hands. The best of the Exmoor ponies 
have strong backs and loins and good substance. They 
are generally bay or brown, with black points, wide fore- 
heads and nostrils, mealy noses, sharp ears, good shoulders 
and back, short legs and good bone. They are very 
tough and hardy, and have been known to cover long 
distances. Youatt states that in the year 1860, a farmer 
who weighed 196 pounds rode an Exmoor pony from Bris- 
tol to South Moulton, a distance of 86 miles, beating a 
coach that traveled the same road. 
The official description of the Dartmoor ponies and 
those of North Wales is identical, with certain amend- 
ments in addition. Those ponies that are over fifteen 
hands would seem to be cross-bred, as the pure Dartmoor 
never exceeds thirteen hands. In color, the Dartmoor 
ponies are brown, black or bay. There are some grays. 
Other colors are considered objectionable. Efforts are 
now being made to improve them by the introduction of 
good stallions of the best pony breeds. 
204. The New Forest pony. — Ponies have been bred 
in a semi-wild state from the earliest times in the county 
of Hampshire in England, a district covering some 92,395 
acres, of which 44,978 are still uninclosed waste land. 
The greater part of this common land is poor and boggy 
moor. It is estimated that there are about 2500 of these 
ponies. Like most of the other ponies in the British Isles, 
they have been much improved in recent years. Lord 
Arthur Cecil owns a large number, and he turns out with
-P-A-G-E-205
   THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 175 
his mares thirty to forty good stallions every season. 
Many of his stallions are from the island of Rum, off the 
western coast of Scotland, and are the original black Gal- 
Joway, found in a wild state on the island in 1840, by his 
father, the late Marquis of Salisbury, and have been kept 
almost pure. In 1888, Lord Arthur secured the whole 
stock of these Rum ponies. They are inclined to be a 
little coarse in the head, but this defect is disappearing 
  Fie. 27. — English Westmorland Fel pony stallion. 
with breeding and good keep. Most of the Rum ponies 
are black, although some are bay or brown; many of 
them have the hazel eye, although this is not unknown 
in the Exmoor and Welsh ponies also. 
The New Forest pony, because of not having had to 
endure the severe climate of the hills, is likely to be less 
hardy than the hill ponies. The height, as given by the 
Polo Pony Society, is twelve to thirteen hands. The 
writer has seen some of these ponies in England, and they 
are not equal to many of the other breeds, but Lord Arthur 
Cecil is very enthusiastic about them, and is doing much  
-P-A-G-E-206
176 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
toimprove them. They are likely to be low at the withers 
and not good in the hind-quarters, being droopy and cow- 
hocked. The cross of the vigorous Rum pony, however, 
will do much to correct this, as he is very strong in these 
points, having excellent hind-quarters and good shoulders. 
Aside from the Rum ponies, Thoroughbred and Arabian 
stallions are also being used, with marked improvement. 
The New Forest ponies are generally more spirited than 
most of the other British ponies. Like all ponies that 
have been brought up on poor pasturage, they improve 
wonderfully on good keep, and, with careful selection in 
breeding, astonishingly good results may be obtained. 
The organization concerned with the interests of this 
breed is known as the New Forest Pony Association. ' 
There is no organization in America for this breed. 
205. The Hackney pony (Figs. 28, 29). —The Hack- 
ney horse has long been bred in England and owes 
his present status to the 
most careful methods 
of breeding, rearing and 
training. Contrary to 
the impression given 
by his name, he is not 
a hack, but is, on his 
native heath, the high- 
est type of driving 
horse. In 1883, when 
the Hackney Horse 
Society was formed in 
England, the standard 
of height for the pony was established as fourteen hands, 
and a separate part of the stud-book was set aside for the 
registration of ponies. Subsequently, this height was in-

THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 177 
creased to fourteen hands one inch, and about nine years 
ago the same height was adopted by the American 
Hackney Horse Society, established in 1891. Inasmuch 
as the Hackney brings 
a higher price, both in | 
England and America, (2) 
than any other pony, 
he may be considered 
the most valuable of all 
ponies. In America, as 
in England, judging 
from the demand and 
prices paid, he appears 
to be steadily growing 
in popularity. 
[The Hackney pony 
is the small-sized Hackney horse. For fuller notes, see 
Hackney Horse, pp. 44-57.] 
206. The ponies of Scotland. — Because of the prox- 
imity of the Shetland islands to Scotland, there are many 
Shetlands there, as in fact there are in England, and many 
of the ponies of Scotland are but a cross between the 
Shetland and a Welsh or some other pony. Many of the 
larger ponies of Scotland resemble much the Welsh cob. 
In times past a pony was often referred to as a Galloway. 
In fact, to this day the name is often seen. 
The Galloway, so-called from the part of Scotland 
known by that name, was once very popular. Youatt, 
in his second edition, 1846, describes it as thirteen to 
fourteen hands, sometimes more, bright bay or brown with 
black legs and small head. As the size was not considered 
desirable, it was crossed with larger breeds, until now the 
original Galloway has entirely disappeared.

207. The Connemara, or pony of Ireland. — The Con- 
nemara, or pony of Ireland, is found chiefly in the County 
Galway, Ireland. It is an extremely wiry pony, showing 
a great deal of the Barb or Arab blood. It stands twelve 
to fourteen hands in height, sometimes more. Like 
other breeds that run practically wild in a hilly country, 
it is hardy, active and sure-footed. It has a thick and 
shaggy coat in response to the climatic condition of its 
habitat. In color, it is black, brown or bay and sometimes 
chestnut, betraying its descent. Often individuals are 
pacers. Since the middle of the last century it has been 
allowed to deteriorate, but for some years past systematic 
endeavors to improve the breed by introduction of Thor- 
oughbred and Hackney pony stallions have been in 
progress. 
Orner Pontes 
208. The Celtic, or pony of Iceland. — The Celtic, or 
pony of Iceland, the Hebrides, north of Ireland, and the 
Faroes, is a small-headed pony with prominent eyes, 
slender limbs and small joints. A typical Celtic pony is 
generally of yellowish dun color, with a dark dorsal band 
and with some indication of stripes on the shoulders and 
in the region of the knees and hocks. ‘These ponies have 
a close resemblance to the Scandinavian pony, and it is 
probable that they. have a common origin. The Shet- 
land, Welsh, New Forest and other ponies of the British 
Isles probably have a certain amount of Celtic blood, as 
ponies are frequently found of the former breeds with 
strong characteristics of the Celtic pony. 
The ponies of the Hebrides, the Faroes and the north 
of Ireland are little known in this country, but the Ice- 
land ponies are sometimes imported into America, although 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
THE PONY BREEDS OF HORSES 179 
few are bred here. They are strong, sturdy, useful little 
animals, rarely exceeding thirteen hands, often reaching 
only eleven and one-half or twelve hands. They are used 
for light driving purposes and as children’s ponies, and in 
England often as pit ponies. 
209. The Arabian pony. — The Arab pony is the Arab 
horse under the given height. For full discussion, see 
Arab Horse, pp. 134-144. 
210. The Russian pony. — Russian ponies are trace- 
able to eastern origin. They are hardy, serviceable and 
often of beautiful appearance. They rarely exceed four- 
teen hands in height, many being but twelve to thirteen 
hands. They are not common in America, but they are 
often seen in England, where they are used for light 
driving purposes or in the pits. In Russia, they are used 
for trade purposes and many of the cavalry mounts are 
but ponies. They have great endurance, and the best of 
them are not surpassed in usefulness by any other breed. 
211. The Scandinavian or Norwegian pony. — The 
Scandinavian pony is closely allied to the Russian, and is 
evidently of the same origin. Not only have these ponies 
worked up through Russia to Norway and Sweden, but 
in the old days of the Vikings there is little doubt that 
many fine specimens of the Arabian were introduced 
into the country. Like the Russian, the Norwegian pony 
is practically unknown in America, but many of them 
are imported into England, where they are used generally 
for light driving purposes or in the pits, some being used 
as polo mounts. 
212. Miscellaneous ponies. — The Mongolian, Japa- 
nese, Korean, Burma and Manipura, Sumatra and Java 
ponies can be of little interest to American breeders. In 
common with all ponies they have to a greater or lesser

extent the hardiness, endurance, sound feet and legs that 
are the inheritance of a half-wild existence under adverse 
conditions. These ponies are exceedingly rare in Amer- 
ica, and we have many types much superior in confor- 
mation and other desirable qualities nearer home from 
which to breed.

CHAPTER VI 
MULES AND JACKS 
By Charles Wm. Burkett 
Tue Mutz is a hybrid, a cross between the horse 
and the ass. An offspring of the male ass or jack and the 
mare is known as a mule, 
while the progeny of a stal- 
lion and a female ass is 
designated as a hinny. 
213. History. — The mule 
has been known from the 
earliest times, some of the 
old Roman writers having 
discussed it in their descrip- 
tions of Roman agriculture. 
In America, the mule has 
been in use from colonial 
days. As early as 1591, 
jacks were brought to this 
country by the Spaniards. 
The first of the kind, no 
doubt, went to Mexico. 
One of the first men to en- 
gage in the production of 
mules was General Washington. The superior qualities 
of the mule were early recognized by southern planters. 
214. Description. — The mule is more valuable than 
the hinny, since it has greater size, more style, finish 
181 
  Fic. 30.—Pair of sugar mules. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  182 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
and stronger bone, requisites that go to make the animal 
valuable for draft purposes (Fig. 30). From this de- 
scription it follows that the hinny is smaller in size, some- 
what unsightly in form, lacking in finish and adapted to 
environments that call for lighter work and effort. Still, 
the hinny is able to endure drudgery and hardship equal 
to and often greater than the mule can stand. 
215. Form.—The mule that most nearly approaches the 
ideal type follows the horse closely in all points of form. 
The body, however, is commonly more cylindrical and some- 
what smaller than the body of the horse, a factor not alto- 
gether in favor of the mule. A large body, therefore, is 
more desirable than a small body; but largeness of body 
must not be confused with paunchiness, for this is always 
objectionable. Producers of mules are realizing that a 
critical trade is demanding animals of a superior conforma- 
tion in the region of the body, much more so than this 
same trade demanded a few years ago. 
Mules of ideal conformation possess straight hard 
legs, showing superiority with every movement. The 
bone should be smooth and dense, but ample; the. 
tendons prominent; and the muscles well developed. 
While the feet of the mule are narrower and longer than 
those of the horse, a large foot is always to be desired. 
216. Market class of mules. — Mules are generally 
grouped into four general classes on the larger markets. 
(1) Sugar and cotton mules. — While these are raised 
in the West, a great majority of them find their way 
into the southern states, where they are used on cotton- 
farms or sugar-farms. It is a good class of mules that 
goes into this section. They are large, heavy and of 
splendid type. On the Kansas City market the cotton 
and sugar mules stand fifteen to sixteen hands, while the 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  
MULES AND JACKS 183 
Chicago market calls for a somewhat higher animal. 
The cotton or sugar mule that stands sixteen hands should 
weigh 1050 to 1350 pounds. The class of mules that 
is used on the sugar plantations is of the best quality, 
owing to the fact that the sugar plantations are worked by 
wealthy syndicates that could not afford to use poor mules. 
They show a very smooth finish, a marked refinement 
about the head and neck and a fine quality of bone. In 
fact, no class is superior to the sugar mule in smoothness 
and finish. The sugar class of mules shows also greater 
uniformity-in quality, height and weight than do those 
used for any other purpose. Cotton 
mules, as a rule, are poorly graded, 
and lack the uniformity observed in 
the sugarclass. Bothcotton and sugar 
mules begin service, usually, at three or 
four years of age, although some at five 
years; but they are at their best when 
six to nine or ten years of age. 
(2) Lumber mules. — For the neces- 
sities of the woods, where mules are 
used in great numbers for purposes of 
lumbering, a very heavy, strong and 
tugged animal is needed; hence, we 
find the lumber mules extremely tall 
and large, usually fifteen to seventeen 
or more hands in height. Quality is \ 
not of so much importance as the Fic. 31.—A good rep- 
ability to do hard and rough work, Lae ae 
and much of it; therefore, weight ; 
is especially essential. There is great variation in 
this class of mules, everything being sacrificed except- 
ing capacity to do hard work, ruggedness to endure 
   
-P-A-G-E-214
184 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
hardships and fatigue, and size and height to supply 
power. 
(8) The general-purpose mule. — This animal is seen 
wherever railroad construction is in progress; he is often 
‘ observed on the farm; he is found on the roads wherever 
heavy hauling is being done, in the cities, towns and 
along rivers. One of the requirements of this class is that 
it be rugged, strong and capable of doing hard work. This 
mule competes with the ordinary draft horse, and compared 
with the average draft horse is superior for many kinds of 
work. In height this class ranges from fifteen to sixteen 
and one-half hands. The weight varies from 1000 to 1400 
pounds. The Chicago market grades the general-purpose 
mule a little heavier and a little higher than either the 
Kansas City, the St. Louis or the St. Paul markets. 
(4) The mine mule. — Mine mules are generally classed 
as either pitters or surface mules. They grade into the 
smallest of these four groups, standing ten and one-half 
to fifteen hands high, are chunky and hardy, and possess 
a heavier bone in proportion to size than those of the other 
classes. The white mule is never used in the mines, for the 
reason that it tends to frighten other animals; hence, dark 
bay, brown or black are the only colors desired for this pur- 
pose. Those mules selected for the pits are of heavy bone 
and of good weight, capable of long, steady pulls with rather 
heavy loads. The surface class, while heavy, is some- 
what taller than those in the pit, and may be lighter in bone. 
217. Use of the mule. — The mule is a draft animal, 
found wherever drudgery is performed and strenuous 
effort demanded. If the earth on which the feet must go 
is broken, marshy and wet, there you will find the mule 
in use; if climates are hot and sultry and harmful to 
health; if paths are precipitous and dangerous, requiring 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
   MULES AND JACKS 185 
surefootedness and steadiness ; if bold courage is required, 
by the great demands made, it is the mule that is drafted 
into service, because it is well known that he will be found 
equal to the occasion. He is found in the cotton-fields 
of the Black-belt, in the sugar-fields of the South, on the © 
stiff prairie lands of the West, and on the difficult moun- 
tain trails. The mule has been born and bred to this 
environment. In it he serves better than any other 
beast of burden, for he asks less and does more; because 
he enjoys immunity to disease in a large measure; his 
span of life is many years; and his demands on his master 
are few, simple and reasonable. 
The mule also has place as a saddle and carriage ani- 
mal, notably in parts of the South and central West. 
218. Feeding. — There is a prevailing opinion that 
mules may be fed on less food than horses of the same size 
and weight; but this is an error. While it may be true 
that the mule will utilize inferior feeding-stuffs to a better 
advantage than his more aristocratic contemporaries, 
still, to do the work that he is called on to do, he requires 
a quantity of food equally as great as that of his horse 
relatives. The mule has marked preference for certain 
foods, or a marked dislike for other foods, a discrimina- 
tion even more sensitive than that of the horse. 
219. Distribution. — An English writer describes the 
distribution of mules as follows: ‘‘ The mule line extends 
north from the equator, including Africa and Europe, 
up to 45° of latitude, and in Asia and North America 
as far as 35°. On the south side of the equator 
we can include most of Africa, the northern part of 
Australia and South America, as far south as 35°. Within 
this vast radius hundreds of thousands of mules are bred 
each year. Many of the mules are big, heavy animals,
-P-A-G-E-216
186 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
with great power and bone, and stand sixteen to seventeen 
hands high.” 
Kentucky and Tennessee have been noted from early 
days as mule-breeding centers. Many noted jacks have 
gone to these states, both native and those representing 
the best of the Andalusian, Catalonian, Majorcan and 
the Maltese types. During recent years, it has been 
learned that while soil and climate may influence quality 
in the individual, care in the selection of feeds and in the 
breeding types is also a requisite of successful mule 
production. Consequently, Texas, Georgia, Missouri, 
Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as many other states, are 
vying with Kentucky and Tennessee in producing mules 
of high quality that find favor in all parts of the world. 
220. Mule production. — Up to the time of the Civil 
War, but two breeds of jacks were used, the Maltese 
and the Spanish. The Andalusian and Catalonian from 
the mainland, and the Majorcan, from the island of 
Majorca, were formerly known as Spanish. So great has 
been the demand for jacks of Malta that practically all have 
_ been exported, and now but few are left on the island. 
The jacks of Italy have not been successful as mule- 
. producers in this country, and consequently have entered 
but slightly into the mule stock here. At the present time, 
there are three noted breeds of jacks : the native, the Poitou 
and the Catalonian. In regard to favor and importance, 
perhaps, these breeds should be ranked as mentioned here. 
Many of our noted mule-breeders prefer native jacks to 
those of foreign breeds. The native jack produces a high 
finish, a good form, strong legs, broad hocks, and is already 
peculiarly adapted to our environments. Besides these 
qualities, he extends to his progeny immunity to diseases 
to an unusual degree, and an exceptionally long life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
   MULES AND JACKS 187 
221. The Poitou jack. — The Poitou jack is a French 
breed of Spanish origin, and is ranked by some breeders 
as first among jack breeds. He is liked especially for 
agricultural use, because of the excellence of his limbs and 
feet. The legs are short and straight with plenty of bone, 
while the pasterns are short, as required of a draft animal. 
The legs are flat and hard, whilst the feet are large and 
more expanded than those of any other breed of jacks. 
In this respect, the Catalonian jack is not equal to the 
French breed, although the Catalonian is finer in limbs 
than the Poitou. 
With the Poitou jack, both the head and ears are enor- 
mous; in fact, French breeders are inclined to regard , 
these as of very great importance,— more desirable 
than the smaller kind. The neck is strong. Withers 
are not well marked, but this is true of all jack races. 
The broad chest and enormous legs of the Poitou jack 
promise much in mule-breeding. 
The Poitou jack varies from thirteen and one-half to 
fifteen hands, which is about the height of native, Cata- 
lonian and other Spanish breeds. The height of a jack 
is not nearly so important as the character of the head, 
ears, legs, feet and barrel. If height can be secured from 
the dam, it is better to sacrifice height in the jack, in order 
to get other and more desirable qualities. The breed is 
of less importance than individual qualities. 
Prices for individuals of the Poitou breed are a little 
higher, perhaps, than for either the Catalonian or native, 
but it is possible to get a good Poitou jack for $1000 to 
$1500, although some have sold at $2500 to $3500 each. 
222. Importance of mules. —- The raising of mules is 
demanding more attention from year to year. Some of 
the reasons for their increasing popularity may be briefly
-P-A-G-E-218
188 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
summarized as follows: (1) It costs less to breed and 
raise a mule to a serviceable size than a horse. (2) Less 
time is required to prepare a lot of mules than a lot of 
colts for the market. (3) Young mules may be sold 
readily at any age, and in any number. (4) Mule 
colts uniformly command a higher price than horse colts 
of similar relative quality and value. (5) Mules are 
subject to fewer diseases and less liable to serious accidents. 
223. The type of jack to use. — The jack for mule pro- 
duction should be at least fifteen hands high and should 
carry maximum weight, but this does not mean that the 
jack should be fat; 
large size, that with it 
may go heavy bone, a 
broad chest and great 
strength in the region 
of the hips; a large 
strong foot is de- 
sirable also. To these 
features should be 
added all the style 
: attainable (Fig. 32). 
its: Portia jask. Associated with size 
will usually be found 
a rather large head, somewhat heavy and coarse, and 
not of the best quality; but it is better to sacrifice 
quality if weight and substance, requisites of the first 
importance in the mule, may be secured. 
224. The kind of mare to breed from. — A common 
error is to suppose that as soon as a mare becomes diseased 
and unfit for horse-breeding she may be used for the 
production of mules. Perhaps this accounts for so many 
inferior mule colts. It matters not how superior the 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  
MULES AND JACKS 189 
jack may be, unless the dam is equally sound, and of 
equally good conformation, one will seldom succeed, if 
_ever, in producing colts of high quality and of great 
usefulness. She should possess good length, with a 
large, well-rounded barrel; her head must be fine and 
clean, and attached to a neck of desirable proportions ; 
her chest broad, her hips wide, and, finally, her style, 
bearing and breeding of high order. 
For the production of big mules, large draft mares 
only will serve. One may take good grade mares of the 
Percheron, Clydesdale, Shire or Belgian breeds; either 
is good and all are satisfactory. Some of the highest 
class but not the largest mules are out of Saddle, 
Standardbred or Thoroughbred mares. A dip of hot 
blood is favored by most mule-breeders. 
225. Color. — Perhaps color is but a play of the fancy. 
Still, in the case of the jack it suggests lineage and purity 
of breeding. Generally speaking, a dark color is prefer- 
able, if not altogether demanded, in the jack. Black, 
with white points, is the best fashion. With mares, let 
the color be dark also: bay, black, brown or chestnut. 
Good color in the dam will insure good color in the colt, 
a matter of no small importance for a discriminating public. 
There is no special merit in the color, and the breeder must be 
careful not to sacrifice quality, size and substance for color. 
226. Organizations and records. — It has only been 
within the last twenty-five years that an American society 
has undertaken to advance the interest in jacks and 
jennets and in mule-breeding. The “ American Breeders’ 
Association of Jacks and Jennets,” issued the first stud- 
book in 1891. The office of the secretary is at Columbia, 
Tennessee. A jack stock registry has recently been organ- 
ized in Kansas City, Missouri.

Canada for army use will be found in Appendix I of 
“The Horse,” by Roberts. 
The classes and types of horses required for the army 
may be generally described as follows: (1) Chargers
-P-A-G-E-228
198 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
(for officers). — Height from 15 hands 1 inch to 15 hands 
3inches. (2) Riding horses (troopers). — Height from 15 
hands 1 inch to 15 hands 23 inches. (3) Cobs (for mounted 
infantry). — Height from 14 hands 2 inches to 15 hands. 
(4) Draft horses (for gun and wagon). — Height from 
15 hands 2 inches to 15 hands 33 inches. 
Age. — From 4 years (off) to 6 years. 
Color. — Bays, browns and blacks preferred, but chest- 
nuts will be accepted. Whites, grays, piebalds or skew- 
balds, ete., are required only for special purposes. Light, 
washy-colored horses are not accepted. 
Sex. — Geldings or mares. Entire or unmanageable 
horses are not accepted. 
Unhogged manes and undocked tails are desired, espe- 
cially in the case of chargers. Good horses with short 
manes and docks can be accepted. 
Soundness. — No horse is accepted without passing a 
veterinary examination; and soundness in wind, eyes 
and limb is insisted on. Stale, upright and over-shooting 
joints, weak or curby hocks, brushing, dishing or untrue 
action, turned-in or turned-out toes and weak feet are 
absolute disqualifications. 
Chargers, riding horses and cobs should be short-legged, 
short-backed, good-barrelled, with good rein and shoul- 
ders, of the hunter stamp, with substance and quality, 
action true and quite clear of the joints. 
Draft horses should not be too big, but fit to carry a 
man driving postillion; active and able to gallop, deep, 
short-legged, well ribbed-up, with plenty of substance 
and quality; action true and quite clear of the joints. 
Very coarse horses and those with heavy rolling action 
are not accepted. 
Note. — No horses will be purchased unless they have 
been handled and are reasonably quiet.

THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 
THESE are quite uniform in the degree to which they all 
conform to the beef type. They are low set, of parallelo- 
gram form from the side, as the effect of their straight and 
parallel top and under lines, with square ends, rectangular 
from any other view owing to their width throughout, 
thickly fleshed, easily fatted and possessed of quality 
yet great scale. In consequence they mature early, fatten 
readily, dress a high percentage of their live weight and 
carry the maximum weight of their dressed carcasses in 
the region of the most desirable cuts; 2.¢., rib, loin and 
round, which are of the highest quality.

231. Shorthorn cattle are a breed possessing both beef 
and dairy types. Registered and grade cattle of this 
breed are more numerous than the cattle of any other beef 
breed. They originated in the valley of the Tees river, 
in northeastern England, and first became prized by 
farmers in the shires of Durham, Northumberland, Lin- 
coln ‘and York. Largely from the localities in which 
they originated, Shorthorns were formerly called Tees- 
water cattle and Durhams. These names as referring 
to Shorthorns have now largely become obsolete.

202 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
232. Origin in England. — As has been said, the Short- 
horn breed of cattle originated in northeastern England, 
and first became popular in the shires of Durham, North- 
umberland, Lincoln and York. From this somewhat 
restricted territory their popularity gradually extended 
throughout England and Scotland, until, early in the 
nineteenth century, they were by far the most popular 
race of cattle in the British Isles. Authorities differ 
somewhat as to the particular stock used in developing 
this breed. All agree, however, that the largest factor 
entering into their production was the native cattle of the 
northeastern section of England. 'That occasional crosses 
of Dutch bulls were used is probable. 
233. Breeding by Colling Brothers. — Improvement 
began about (1750, although very little methodical or 
efficient work was accomplished prior to the cattle-breeding 
operations of Rake and Charles Colling, of Barmpton 
and Ketton Hall.) By careful selection and inbreeding 
they succeeded in setting standards towards which con- 
temporary breeders aimed. Charles Colling’s first Short- 
horn purchase was made in 1784. His herd was dispersed 
successfully in 1810. Robert Colling’s herd was sold 
partly in 1818 and the remainder in 1820. While these 
two brothers operated their farms separately and main- 
tained separate herds, their methods and accomplishments 
were similar. They were unusually fortunate in the pur- 
chase of that first great Shorthorn sire, Hubback (319). 
While this was an undersized bull, yellow-red in color, 
he proved a fortunate “nick” for the late-maturing, 
coarse cows so common in the early history of the breed. 
As breeders of the Durham Ox, The White Heifer that. 
Traveled, Favorite (252) and Comet (155), these pioneer 
breeders established a reputation for breeding good 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
   THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 203 
Shorthorns that has made an impression on every careful 
student of the early history of the breed. 
234. Other English breeders. — Among others, the fol- 
lowing breeders were identified with the early history of 
the breed: Sir William St. Quintin, Sir James Pennyman, 
and Messrs. Milbank, Sharter, Pickering, Stephenson, 
Wetherell, Maynard, Dobinson, Charge, Wright, Hutchin- 
son, Snowden, Waistell, Richard and William Barker, 
Brown, Hall, Hill, Best, Watson, Baker, Thompson, 
Jackson, Smith, Jolly, Masterman, Wallace and Robert- 
son. 
Darlington was for years looked on as the center of 
Shorthorn interests, although, strange as it may seem, 
there is but little activity in breeding Shorthorns in that 
section at the present time. 
235. Thomas Bates of Kirklevington. — Thomas Bates, 
who was destined to become such an important factor 
in the breeding of Shorthorn cattle, purchased his first 
stock in 1800. He had previously been a breeder of Ky- 
loes or West Highland cattle. He was well prepared for 
the work he undertook, and established families of Short- 
horns of such pronounced individuality and recognized 
excellence of pedigree that they were at one time by far 
the most popular strain of the breed. Prices were paid 
during “boom times” for Bates’ Shorthorns that have 
never been approached by Shorthorns of other lines of 
breeding. Thomas Bates was a stickler for pedigree. 
He assumed that cattle bred along certain specified lines 
would produce, when mated, almost invariably certain 
desired results. The particular family or tribe which he 
developed most and favored most was the Duchess. 
Fabulous prices have been paid for representatives of this 
family. The highest recorded price, $40,600, was paid 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
204 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
for a cow of this family at the New York Mills sale of 
September 10, 1873. 
Belvedere (1706) was one of the best bulls used by Bates, 
while the Duke of Northumberland (1940), the acknowl- 
edged champion bull of England in 1842, was undoubtedly 
the best bull ever produced at Kirklevington. Bates’ aim in 
breeding was to produce a dual-purpose cow, and as a con- 
sequence he gave careful attention to preserving the milk- 
ing qualities of his Shorthorns. There was a characteristic 
style and finish about Bates’ Shorthorns that still clings 
to cattle containing a strong infusion of this blood. While 
cattle of Thomas Bates’ breeding were frequently seen in 
the show-ring from 1838 to 1848, and wherever shown were 
unusually successful, he was personally very much opposed 
to training cattle for show. The Bates herd was dispersed 
in 1850, when prices were very low, and as a consequence 
the cattle did not bring what they were worth. 
236. Breeding by the Booths. — The elder Booth was 
a contemporary of Thomas Bates. His first herd was 
established at Killerby in 1790. His especial aim was to 
breed an earlier-maturing beast that would be noted for 
its beef-producing rather than its milk-producing qualities. 
While Booth was very ready to admit that the Collings 
had greatly improved Shorthorns, he did not think, as 
many of the breeders of the time apparently thought, 
that it was necessary to buy the females composing his 
herd of them. Among his early purchases were five 
heifer calves from the herd of Mr. Broader of Fairholme. 
To mate with these heifers, Booth purchased the Robert 
Colling bred bull, Twin Brother to Ben (660), and one 
of his get. Some of the best of the Killerby and Warlaby 
cattle descended from this line of breeding and from the 
following tribes or families : Blossom, Bright Eyes, Isabella
-P-A-G-E-237
  
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 205 
and the Booth Red Roses. Another bull which was pur- 
chased of Robert Colling was Suworow (626), at the disper- 
sion sale of the Ketton Hall herd in 1810. Booth purchased 
the bull Albion (14), which proved to be a most excellent 
sire. Most of his bulls were from the Collings’ herds. Be- 
sides the families of Shorthorns mentioned, Thomas Booth 
was partial to the Strawberry and Bracelet tribes. In 1819, 
Thomas Booth gave up the Killerby farm and a part of 
his herd to his son John, and removed to his Warlaby 
farm, so prominent in Shorthorn history. To another 
son, Richard, who was on the Studley farm, he had also 
sold a number of his Shorthorns. 
Other families of Shorthorns which should be associated 
with the Booth families are the Farewells, the Broughton, 
Dairy Maids or Moss Roses, Gaudy or Lady Betty sort, 
Mantilinis and Belindas. 
Perhaps the three most famous show animals bred by 
Booth were Bracelet and Necklace, twin heifers, sired by 
Priam (2452) and Lady Fragrant. The twin cows men- 
tioned proved excellent breeders. The most famous bull 
used by any of the Booths was Crown Prince (10087), 
“ The bull of all Booth bulls,” the one that was to Warlaby 
what Duke of Northumberland was to Kirklevington, 
and Champion of England was to Sittyton. Crown 
Prince was considered too valuable a stock-getter to be 
fitted for exhibition. 
The Booth family is still interested in the breeding of 
Shorthorns and the operations of this family will always 
remain an interesting chapter in the-history of Shorthorns. 
They were prominent in the leading live-stock shows of 
the country, and undoubtedly the breeding qualities of 
many of their best cattle were affected by high feeding 
for exhibition purposes.
-P-A-G-E-238
  206 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
237. History in the United States. — The first recorded 
importation of Shorthorns to the United States was that 
of Mr. Miller, of Virginia, and Mr. Gough, of Baltimore, 
Maryland. These gentlemen imported from Great 
Britain, in 1783, some cattle that were undoubtedly of 
the Shorthorn breed. In the years 1790 and 1795, it is 
thought that they brought in consignments of cattle of 
the same breed. In 1791 and 1796, Mr. Heaton brought 
several Shorthorns from England to the state of New 
York, which were lost among the common stock of the 
country. A Scotchman named Cox brought a Short- 
horn bull and two cows to Rensselaer county, New York, 
in 1815. The first Kentucky importation was made in 
1817, by Colonel Lewis Sanders, who purchased through 
an agent eight Shorthorns and four Longhorns. At 
_ about the same time, James Prentice, of Lexington, 
Kentucky, imported two good Shorthorn bulls. 
‘Importations were brought to the state of Massachusetts 
in 1817 by Samuel Williams, and in 1818 by Cornelius 
Coolidge. In 1822, Williams sent over the roan yearling 
heifer Arabella, by North Star (460). The Arabellas were 
noted for being heavy milkers, and at one time constituted 
a large and valuable family. Other Massachusetts im- 
portations of an early date were made by Messrs. Lee, Orr, 
Monson, Coffin, Rotch and Silsby. From 1821 to 1828, 
several unimportant importations were made to New York, 
Pennsylvania and Maryland. In 1833, Walter Dunn, 
living near Lexington, Kentucky, imported six head of 
valuable Shorthorns. Another importation was made 
by Dunn in company with Samuel Smith in 1836. 
238. Organization. —The year 1833 was important 
in Shorthorn history, for the organization of the Ohio 
Importing Company, “For the purpose of promoting the
-P-A-G-E-239
  THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 207 
interest of agriculture and introducing an improved breed 
of cattle.” Felix Renick was chosen agent of this com- 
pany to go to England to select cattle for the company. 
While it was not restricted to purchase all Shorthorns, it 
decided, after considerable investigation, to import only 
Shorthorns. Among the herds visited were those of May- 
nard, Booth, Bates, Whitaker, Althrope, Craddock, Raine 
and Paley. Seven bulls and twelve females were carefully 
selected for the first importation. In this lot were the two 
heifers, Rose of Sharon, and Young Mary, which were 
destined to play such an important part in the history of 
Shorthorns in the United States. This importation was 
so satisfactory to the shareholders of the Ohio Importing 
Company that their agent was soon authorized to make 
arrangements for further importations. In 1835 and 1836, 
Whitaker, through Renick’s authorization, sent out two 
shipments comprising forty-two animals to the Ohio 
Importing Company. Among these were Josephine, 
Young Phyllis, Illustrious and Harriet. In August, 1836, 
this company held a sale on Felix Renick’s farm in Rose 
county, Ohio. Forty-three animals were sold at an 
average price of $803.25, or a total of $34,540. The final 
dispersion sale of the company was held in 1837, at which 
the fifteen animals averaged $1071.65. A number of 
importations were made to Ohio from 1836 to 1840. In 
1839, the Kentucky Importing Company brought over a 
number of Shorthorns. 
239. History since 1840. — From 1840 to 1850, agri- 
culture in the United States was in a very depressed state, 
and the cattle industry, along with other farm interests, 
remained practically at a standstill. There was little 
demand for breeding cattle, which resulted in large num- 
bers of Shorthorn breeding stock finding their way to
-P-A-G-E-240
208 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
the shambles. In 1852, the Scioto Valley Importing 
Company was organized. This company, through its 
agents, George W. Renick and Arthur Watts, imported 
ten bulls and seventeen females, which were sold at auction 
at the very high average of $1351.85. This sale proved 
a stimulus to Shorthorn-cattle-breeding interests, and 
other importing companies were quickly organized, 
among which were the Madison County, Ohio, the North- 
ern Kentucky, and the Scott County Importing Com- 
panies, the Clinton County, Ohio, and Clark County, 
Ohio, Associations. 
In 1852 and 1853, A. J. Alexander of Kentucky, who was 
visiting in Great Britain, laid the foundation of the Wood- 
burn herd of Shorthorns. The first shipment of cattle 
to the Alexander farm was made in 1853; subsequently 
other importations were made, which included Duchess 
Airdrie, Duchess Athol, Pearlette, Victoria 20th, Filigree, 
Lady Gulnare, Minna, Constance, Rosabella and other 
cows. Three of the leading bulls imported were Duke 
of Airdrie, Second Duke of Athol and Dr. Buckingham. 
At the Northern Kentucky and Scott County Companies’ 
sales, Alexander made important purchases in the cows 
Mazurka, Maid of Melrose and Equity. The Wood- 
burn herd took a prominent place in Shorthorn affairs and 
was at one time probably one of the largest and best Short- 
horn herds in America, if not in the world. The Duke 
of Airdrie (12730) was used a year by George M. Bedford 
and to some extent by Abram Renick and Jere Duncan, 
as well as by Alexander. Bell Duke of Airdrie (2552), 
Duncan’s Duke of Airdrie (2743) and Airdrie (2478) are 
considered among this great bull’s most famous sons. 
Among the most prominent breeders of Shorthorns 
in the United States at this early period should be men-
-P-A-G-E-241
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 209 
tioned Abram Renick of Kentucky. Perhaps the most 
far-reaching accomplishment of his efforts is to be found 
in the founding and bringing to a high degree of excellence 
that family that for many years attracted international 
attention, viz., the Rose of Sharon. The bull Airdrie 
2478, already mentioned, was spoken of as one of medium 
size, very symmetrical, neat, smooth and stylish, and a 
remarkable sire of high-class bulls. This bull was used 
extensively in Mr. Renick’s herd and sired, among other 
famous Shorthorns, the bull Sweepstakes (6230), Joe 
Johnson, Airdrie 3d (13320), Dick Taylor (5508), and 
Airdrie Duke (5306). It was with the get of Airdrie 
that Mr. Renick began his system of in-and-inbreeding, 
producing the Rose of Sharons that called forth the 
admiration and respect of the entire Shorthorn-breeding 
fraternity. 
Even a brief history of Shorthorns should not omit 
the name of Warfield. Benjamin Warfield secured his 
first pure-bred Shorthorn in 1831. The first great sire 
in the herd was Renick (903). He was noted more as a 
sire than for his individual excellence. | Benjamin War- 
field was succeeded by his son, William Warfield, of Gras- 
mere. One of the famous bulls used by Warfield was 
Muscatoon (7057). This bull proved to be not only an 
excellent show bull, but a sire of superior show animals. 
William Warfield originated the London Duchesses, by 
many persons thought to be one of the best tribes of Short- 
horns evolved in America. 
Several importations were made into the eastern part 
of the United States from 1830 to 1860.’ This stock was 
very largely of the Bates strains. Perhaps the most 
notable importations during this period were by Samuel 
Thorne, of Thorndale, New York. His first importation 
P
-P-A-G-E-242
210 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
was followed by others in 1854, 1855 and 1856. These 
constituted the highest-priced cattle that had thus far 
been brought to the United States. In 1857, Thorne 
purchased the Morris and Becar herd, consisting of fifty- 
three Shorthorns, at the reported price of $35,000. 
While the principal importations were confined to Ken- 
tucky, Ohio and New York, Shorthorn activity was 
apparent elsewhere, notably in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, 
Missouri and Iowa. 
240. History in Canada. — In 1833, Roland Wingfield, 
near Toronto, imported two Shorthorn bulls and five 
cows from England. Other early importations were 
made by the Home District Agricultural Society, Adam 
Furgeson, George and John Simpson, William and George 
Miller and Frederick William Stone. It may be said, 
however}; that the Shorthorns were not imported ex- 
tensively to Canada until Scotch Shorthorns came into 
popularity. Messrs. George and William Miller, Simon 
Beattie, George Isaac and M. H. Cochrane were first 
responsible for Shorthorn activity in Canada. 
The first Canadian to bring Scotch cattle into promi- 
nence in America was Joseph S. Thompson, Mayfield, 
Whitby, Canada. He imported the Champion of England 
heifers, Sylvia and Christobel, also Violet 4th. James I. 
Davidson, Balsam, Ontario, was also one of the early and 
most ardent supporters of the Scotch type in Shorthorns. 
He started his Shorthorn herd in 1860. From 1881 to 
1887, practically all the stock from the Sittyton herd that 
was brought to the United States passed through the 
hands of Davidson. John Dryden, Brooklyn, Ontario, 
founded the Maple Shade farm herd of Shorthorns, in 
1871. He imported that famous Champion of England 
cow, Mimulus, and other good ones representing the best 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 211 
of the Sittyton blood. George Brown, of Bow Park farm, 
will go down in history as a prominent factor in Canadian 
Shorthorn activity. Among other Canadian breeders 
and importers were John M. Armstrong, Arthur Johnson, 
W. B. Telfar, W. Major, William Collum, Thomas Russell, 
Francis Green and George Whitfield. 
241. Important events in Shorthorn history since 
1860. — In 1869 and 1870, Messrs. Walcott and Camp- 
bell, of New York, imported Booth Shorthorns and the 
entire Sheldon herd of Duchesses and Oxfords. This 
was the beginning of the greatest boom in Bates cattle 
in the United States. In 1867, Colonel W. S. King, of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, founded his important herd in 
the northwest. From 1860 to 1880, Shorthorns of Bates 
families were undoubtedly preéminently popular in the 
United States. In Canada, however, Scotch Shorthorns 
were gaining in popularity. 
The first sale of cattle ever held in Dexter Park, Chicago, 
was in the year 1872. These were prosperous times for 
Shorthorn breeders. This prosperity extended into the 
next year and culminated in one of the greatest if not the 
greatest public sale of pedigreed cattle held in the world, 
namely, the New York Mills sale of Walcott and Camp- 
bell, September 10, 1873. This herd contained the only 
living Duchesses which were descended direct from the 
Bates herd without the admixture of blood from other 
sources. The sale was very largely attended by Short- 
horn fanciers from Great Britain, Canada and the United 
States. At this sale the eighth Duchess of Geneva brought 
$40,600, and many others were sold at fabulous prices. 
Almost immediately following this sale there came a 
period of financial depression, and Shorthorn cattle 
gradually decreased in value for a few years. 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
212 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
242. Popularity of Scotch Shorthorns. — Undoubtedly 
the most notable feature of Shorthorn history from 1880 
to the present time has been the growing popularity of 
Scotch Shorthorns. Of all the breeders of Scotch Short- 
horns, Amos Cruickshank is looked on as the most famous. 
He was an Aberdeenshire tenant farmer, who thought that 
Shorthorns had been too much pampered for practical 
use on the tenant farms of Scotland, where climatic condi- 
tions made it necessary for the farmers to choose a hardy 
race of cattle. He was a lover of Shorthorns, and de- 
termined to develop a type that would meet the require- 
ments of the farmers of Scotland. His ideal was a short- 
legged, broad, thick-fleshed beast, carrying a good middle ; 
that is, a well-sprung rib and a thick, fleshy back and 
loin. He selected animals of this type with which to 
found his herd, and was so successful that his herd soon 
became recognized as the foremost one of Scotland. 
His brother, Anthony, was associated with him. Cruick- 
shank got a very strong hold on Shorthorn breeders, 
that remains to this day. To such an extent is this true 
that one Shorthorn may be two to five times more valu- 
able than another of equal individual merit, simply be- 
cause it has a good Scotch pedigree and the other has not. 
Among those who have helped to popularize Scotch 
Shorthorns in America may be mentioned Colonel W. A. 
Harris, of Linwood, Kansas, J. J. Hill, of St. Paul, Minne- 
sota, and Colonel T. S. Moberly, of Richmond, Kentucky. 
Many other names might be added. 
243. Description. — The general form of the Shorthorn 
is that of the beef type (Plate VI). The breed is charac- 
terized by width and depth of form, great scale and sub- 
stance, and symmetry and style. It is the largest of the 
beef breeds. The head should be wide between the eyes,
-P-A-G-E-245
   THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 213 
short from the eyes to the nostrils, and while it should be 
neat and refined, it must indicate good feeding qualities. 
The horns are short and rather fine, should curve grace- 
fully forward, and be waxy white in color, with dark 
tips. A “spike” horn is objectionable. The neck 
should be short and fine, and smoothly jointed to the head 
and shoulders. The 
shoulders are rather 
upright, and _ fre- 
quently inclined to be 
bare of flesh. The 
back should be 
straight, level and 
broad, and deeply 
covered with flesh. 
- The strong feature in 
the make-up of the 
Shorthorn is the hind-quarter, which is said to be the best 
of any breed. The thighs are wide, deep and long, and 
well filled down in the twist. The line of the back of 
the thigh is nearly straight from the tail down, giving a 
characteristic squarely built appearance. As a rule, the 
body is deep, with a good heart and digestive capacity. 
The flanks should be well let down, making a nearly 
straight underline. The legs are medium length and of 
fine yet strong bone. The representatives of this breed 
have a great capacity for the production of flesh, and as 
they become fat there is a tendency to produce patches 
of fat about tail-head and rolls along the sides. 
A criticism of the breed that has been made in the past 
is that Shorthorns were too long in the legs. There was 
probably just ground for this criticism in the old type of 
Shorthorn, but since the breed has received such an in- 
  Fig. 35.— A typical dual-purpose 
Shorthorn cow.
-P-A-G-E-246
  214 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
fusion of the blood of the low-set, short-legged Scotch 
type, this tendency has been largely done away with. 
The color of the Shorthorn is more variable than that 
of any other breed of cattle. It may be pure red, pure 
white, a mixture of these two colors, or roan. Roan is 
distinctively a Shorthorn color and may always be re- 
garded as an indication of Shorthorn blood. Red and 
white were always characteristic colors of the old Short- 
horn breed in England, but after their introduction into 
the United States, white became unpopular, especially 
on the western ranges, and anything except a solid red 
color was greatly discriminated against. The demand for 
red cattle became greater than the supply of good individ- 
uals, and sires of very ordinary character were used for 
no other reason than that they were red, while excellent 
individuals of the lighter colors were rejected. Good - 
sense and sound judgment finally prevailed in the matter, 
and the red color craze has abated so that whites and roans 
have again come into popularity. 
244. Uses for milk. — The Shorthorn ranks high in its 
dairy capacity. In England there have always been 
families or strains, notably those of Bates breeding, which 
have been noted for their milking capacity, and in England 
to-day the dairy qualities of the Shorthorn receive as 
much consideration as its beef-producing qualities. It 
is asserted that 90 per cent of the milk-supply of London 
is furnished by Shorthorns. In America, more attention 
has been paid to the beef side of the question, and the dairy 
qualities have been somewhat neglected, especially during 
the past craze for the thick-fleshed, blocky Scotch type, 
which were poor milkers. At present, however, more 
‘ attention is being paid to the milking qualities in an effort 
to develop milking strains of Shorthorns (Plate VID.
-P-A-G-E-247
 
-P-A-G-E-248

-P-A-G-E-249
  THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 215 
Major Henry E. Alvord, in Farmers’ Bulletin No. 106, 
United States Department of Agriculture, gives some per- 
formances of Shorthorn herds and individuals as follows: 
“Records of several dairy herds in the United States, 
within a quarter of a century, show a milking season of 
about 275 days and an average product of 6500 pounds of 
milk. One herd of ten cows, three to twelve years old, 
averaged 7750 pounds in a year. Single cows have 
averaged much more, several instances being known of 
10,000 to 12,000 pounds in a season. The Shorthorn 
milk is of good quality, rather above the average; the 
fat globules are of medium and fairly uniform size, so that 
cream separates easily; it is rather pale in color. In 
1824, a cow near Philadelphia made over twenty pounds 
of butter in a week without special feeding. Herds of 
forty cows have averaged 209 pounds of butter in a year; 
the herd of ten cows mentioned above averaged 325 
pounds, and single cows have records of 400 pounds and 
over, one being of 513 pounds.” 
245. Use for butter and cheese. — The ’ Shorthorns 
made a very creditable showing in the butter tests 
against the dairy breeds, the Jerseys and Guernseys, at 
the World’s Columbia Exposition at Chicago, in 1893. 
In the ninety-day butter test, the best Shorthorn cow, 
Nora, produced 3679.8 pounds of milk, from which was 
made 160.57 pounds of butter, and during the period she 
gained 115 pounds in weight. The best Jersey, Brown 
Bessie, produced 3634 pounds of milk, from which was 
made 216.66 pounds of butter, and gained 81 pounds. 
In this test the showing made by the Shorthorn was 
very good, considering the fact that not nearly so much 
care and money were spent in selecting the herd as was 
done with the Jerseys and Guernseys.
-P-A-G-E-250
    216 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
At the same time, the Shorthorn made a like creditable 
showing in a 14-day cheese-making test. In this, the 
Shorthorn ranked third against the Jersey and Guernsey, 
yielding 12186.9 pounds of milk, which made 1077.6 
pounds of cheese. Nora, a Shorthorn, ran second to a 
Jersey, making 60.56 pounds of cheese at a net profit 
of $6.27. 
246. Use for beef. — For the production of beef, the 
Shorthorn stands second to no breed, and there are very 
few that equal it. Its popularity as a beef breed both in 
England and the United States is shown by the number of 
its representatives found at the leading fat-stock shows 
of these two countries. The Shorthorn is naturally thick- 
fleshed, with a maximum development of the valuable 
parts of the carcass, which causes it to dress out a high 
percentage of carcass to live weight, although it is not so 
good in this respect as the Aberdeen-Angus. The Short- 
horn is a good feeder, and, when supplied with an abun- 
dance of food, makes large gains, yielding good returns for 
the food consumed. The breed matures early and can 
be made ready for the block at-two to two and one-half 
years of age; but, if so desired, it will stand a longer period 
of feeding. When forced for a long time, there is a tend- 
ency to take on flesh unevenly, with the fat in patches or 
rolls on the rump and along the sides. 
247. Use for crossing and grading. — No other breed 
has been used for grading up common cattle to the ex- 
tent that the Shorthorn has, and marked improvement 
has resulted wherever this method of grading has been 
followed, as may be seen by noting the improvement 
that has followed the use of Shorthorn bulls on our western ” 
ranges. In our American cattle markets, grade Short- 
horns predominate over all other breeds in numbers.

THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 217 
The first cross of a Shorthorn on any of the beef breeds 
makes a good beef animal. The “ prime Scots,” which 
are so popular in the English markets, are crosses of 
the Shorthorn and Aberdeen-Angus. The “ blue-gray ” 
steers, which are also highly prized in the British markets, 
are crosses of the light-colored Shorthorns on the Gallo- 
way. 
248. Distribution. — The Shorthorn is the most widely 
distributed breed of cattle. It is found in Europe, es- 
pecially in Great Britain, in Asia, South Africa, Australia, 
North and South America. It is the most popular and 
most widely distributed beef breed of cattle in the United 
States and Canada, and is found in every state and 
province in these two countries. In the United States, 
Shorthorns are found most numerously in the following 
states, in order of their importance: Iowa, Missouri, 
Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, 
Michigan. They are still growing in popularity. ~ 
One feature which adds greatly to the popularity of 
the Shorthorns is their great adaptability. They have 
the power to adapt themselves to varying conditions of 
food, climate and treatment. Although they are best 
adapted to temperate regions, they readily adjust them- 
selves to greater extremes of temperature and climate. 
They possess a fair degree of hardiness, and do fairly well 
under range conditions. The Shorthorn was the first 
breed used for the improvement of the cattle on the ranges, 
and has been used extensively for this purpose in the 
United States, Argentina and Australia, but in recent years 
has been largely supplanted by the Hereford. Notwith- 
standing its value on the range, the Shorthorn is best 
adapted to a system of mixed farming, such as is followed 
in the Mississippi valley, where land is so valuable that a

cow cannot be kept for the calf alone, but must yield a 
profit in the dairy. George M. Rommel, in Bulletin No. 
34, Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, states that, of the 150,000 registered 
Shorthorns estimated to be living in America, 5 per cent 
are found on the range, and the other 95 per cent are in 
the hands of the small farmer. 
249. Organizations and records.—In 1822, George 
Coates, of Yorkshire, England, published the Shorthorn 
Herd-book, the first registry of live-stock to be issued. 
From this developed the English Shorthorn Herd-book 
(Coates’ Herd-book), of which fifty volumes have now been 
published. Since 1876, it has been in the hands of the 
Shorthorn Society of the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Ireland. 
The work of recording Shorthorns in America was 
first taken up by Lewis F. Allen, of Black Rock, New York, 
who published the first volume of the American Short- 
horn Herd-book in 1846. Allen continued this publica~- 
tion as a private enterprise until 1882, when it was pur- 
chased by the American Shorthorn Breeders’ Association. 
In 1869, A. J. Alexander, of Woodburn, Kentucky, 
published the first volume of a herd-book known as the 
American Shorthorn Record. In 1878, the Ohio Short- 
horn Breeders’ Association published the first volume of 
the Ohio Shorthorn Record, two more volumes of which 
were published later. 
The registration of Shorthorns in the United States 
at present is conducted, entirely by the American Short- 
horn Breeders’ Association, organized in 1882. This 
association purchased the interests of all the Shorthorn 
herd-books in the United States, and continued the pub- 
lication, beginning with Volume 25 of the American
-P-A-G-E-253
  THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 219 
Shorthorn Herd-book started by Lewis F. Allen. Eighty- 
five volumes of this herd-book have been published, and 
Volumes 86 and 87 are now in preparation, two volumes 
being published annually. There have been registered 
425,000 males and 620,000 females, making a total of 
1,045,000. 
The first Shorthorn herd-book in Canada was the Cana- 
dian Shorthorn Herd-book, the first volume of which was 
published in 1867. In 1881, the first volume of the 
British-American Shorthorn Herd-book was published, 
‘and the first volume of the Dominion Herd-book appeared 
in 1887. The latter took over the interests and records 
of the first two herd-books, and now the registration of 
Shorthorns in Canada is through the Dominion Herd- 
book. 
Pottep DurHAM CATTLE 
By Herbert W. Mumford 
250. Polled Durhams, as a breed, have the unique dis- 
tinction of being the only breed of cattle originating in 
the United States. They are very similar to the Short- 
horn, and, in fact, the Shorthorn is chiefly responsible 
for their origin. 
251. Breeders of note.— Among the early breeders 
interested in the development of the Polled Durham 
breed the following were most prominent: William W. 
Crane, Tippecanoe City, Ohio; W. S. Miller, Elmore, 
Ohio; J. F. and A. E. Burleigh, Mazon, Illinois; and 
Shafor and Clawson, Hamilton, Ohio. 
252. Description. — Like the Shorthorn, the Polled 
Durham is massive in size, quiet in disposition, and a 
breed well calculated to meet the requirements of farmers 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  220 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
wanting a hornless race of dual-purpose cattle. They 
are, however, better fitted to give satisfaction as beef- 
producers than in the dairy. During the early history 
of the breed much attention was paid _to color and milking 
qualities. Red was preferred, but in later years roans 
have’ come to be looked on with more favor. With the 
increase in numbers comes the opportunity to make more 
careful selections, and the breed is making rapid advance- 
ment both in real merit and public esteem. It possesses 
considerable prepotency. 
Nearly all Polled Durhams that are being recorded 
at the present time are pure Shorthorn in blood, and 
breeders are striving to produce, as nearly as possible, 
the ideal Shorthorn, minus the horns. Polled Durhams 
are judged by the same standards as are Shorthorns, 
and in nearly all large shows Polled Durhams are judged 
_ by a Shorthorn breeder. ~~ 
253. Standards. — There are two somewhat distinct 
lines of blood to be found among Polled Durhams. These 
are designated as Double-Standard and Single Standard 
Polled Durhams. 
Double-Standard Polled Durhams include the hornless 
Shorthorns that are eligible for record in the American 
Shorthorn Herd-book, as well as the American Polled 
Durham Herd-book. They are the result of retaining, as 
breeding animals, hornless Shorthorns, which occasion- 
ally appear as freaks in Shorthorn herds. The most of 
the Double-Standard Polled Durhams are from the three 
families, White Rose, Young Phyllis and Gwynne. 
Single-Standard Polled Durhams are eligible for record 
in the Polled Durham record only. This branch of Polled 
1 It is now known that the horned and polled characters are Mendelian, 
recessive and dominant respectively.
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 221 
Durhams originated by the attempts on the part of a 
number of breeders, working, at first independently for 
the most part, to develop a race of hornless cattle with 
the characteristics of the Shorthorn breed. This was 
accomplished by the use of Shorthorn bulls on the native 
muley cows. 
254. Distribution. — Herds of Polled Durhams are 
more numerous in Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and_ Illinois 
than in other states, although they are being introduced 
rather extensively into other sections of the country, 
notably in North Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Wisconsin, 
Texas and Nebraska. Several have been shipped to 
Argentina, in South America. 
255. Organizations and records.—The American 
Polled Durham Breeders’ Association, which has for its 
object the furthering of the interests of the breed, and the 
recording of animals eligible to its herd-book, was organized 
in Chicago, November 13, 1889, and was chartered Novem- 
ber 2, 1890. Six volumes of the American Polled Durham 
Herd-book have been published, the first having appeared 
in 1894; over 27,000 animals have been registered. “‘ Ani- 
mals to be eligible to entry in the American Polled Durham 
Herd-book must be at least six months old; must be 
naturally hornless; must have both parents recorded 
therein or have one parent recorded in the book and the 
other parent recorded in the American Short-horn Herd- 
book; and further, must have all ancestry that are eligible 
recorded in the American Polled Durham Herd-book.’’

By Charles Gudgell 
256. The Hereford is a breed of cattle raised for the 
production of beef. 
257. History in England.— The Hereford breed of 
cattle originated in the southwestern part of England, in 
a district the center of which is the county of Hereford. 
It doubtless had its foundation in the native cattle of 
that district in the same way that the other English breeds 
of domestic cattle had their origin. The name Hereford 
was at first used to designate the cattle generally of that 
district. These cattle were historically mentioned at a 
very early date (1627), as possessed of remarkably easy- 
keeping and fattening qualities. Later the term Hereford 
came to be used to designate the improved and pedigreed 
cattle that had been developed into a race with well- 
established breed characteristics that were reliably trans- 
mitted. Many of the early breeders had different objects 
or ideals in breeding, with the result that the Hereford 
cattle of that day had a great diversity of color as well as 
of physical features. 
The colors that predominated among Hereford cattle 
at the time of the preparation of the first volume of the 
herd-book (about 1845) were varying shades of red on 
the body with white face, and the same with mottled or 
spotted face, and also varying degrees of roan or gray, as 
it was called, on the sides of the animal, with all the      
-P-A-G-E-257
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 223 
other parts white. In the establishment of the im- 
proved and pedigreed Herefords, different breeders man- 
ifested a preference for animals of one or the other of 
these markings, and each zealously maintained the same 
during his breeding operations. The result of this was 
that, about 1845, there were several different strains of 
Hereford cattle that were distinguished mainly by their 
color markings, and were designated by the name of some 
prominent breeder, who had originated or was closely 
connected with the development of this particular strain. 
Subsequent breeders very wisely interbred these different 
strains or families, with the result that in a few years the 
breed became of a uniform color and markings, as at the 
present day. 
The Hereford is among the oldest, if not the oldest es- 
tablished of the English breeds of domestic cattle. Some 
of its early improvers were contemporary, and some ante- 
cedent to the operations of Bakewell, who began his great 
work as a scientific breeder about 1755. As an evidence 
of the importance and advancement of the Hereford in, 
production of beef at an early date, it may be cited tha 
the prize for the champion steer over all-breeds at the first 
show of the Smithfield Club held at London in 1799 was 
won by a Hereford steer, and the same for several subse- 
quent years. At a dispersion sale by auction of the breed- 
ing herd of one of the early improvers of the Hereford, held 
in 1819, the average of the sale was about $750 a head. 
258. History in America. — Importations of a few head 
of Herefords were made to America in 1817, 1824 and 
1840. The first two of these importations were unfortu- 
nate in that in one case the bull died, and in the other the 
cow died. The difficulties and risks attending the making 
of importations of cattle at that time were so great that 
   
-P-A-G-E-258
  [ik 
224 THE BREKDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
no attempt was made to keep up the race, and the result 
was that they became merged into other stocks and dis- 
appeared. The importation of 1840 was somewhat larger 
and more successful in that the cattle were maintained 
in their purity and pedigree records were kept. The 
descendants of this importation have continued to the 
present day and are registered in the American Hereford 
Record. 
It was not until the Centennial Exposition at Phila- 
delphia, in 1876, that the cattle-growers of the western 
part of the United States were attracted to the visible 
merits of this breed of cattle. A very attractive herd of 
the descendants of later importations was on exhibition 
on this occasion. To nearly all of the cattle-men of the 
West the Hereford was an unheard-of breed, and their uni- 
formity, color and markings, together with their beef- 
carrying qualities, were revelations to them. As the 
cattle-growing interests were at that time assuming 
-enormous proportions in the country west of the Missouri 
river, these visiting cattle-men were the more easily pre- 
ailed on to give the Herefords a trial under their system 
of production. 
In the few succeeding years all the bulls obtainable 
of this breed were bought and shipped to different parts 
of the range country from Wyoming to Texas. It was 
then developed that the Hereford bull, when bred to range- 
bred cows, transmitted to his progeny his breed characteris- 
tics to a great degree, and ranchmen proceeded at once to 
make arrangements to introduce Hereford bulls into their 
herds. The popularity of the breed steadily grew and 
spread throughout the cattle-growing sections, and it soon 
became evident that they were impressing their characters 
on the improved range stock. This wave of popularity
-P-A-G-E-259
FORE oe ERE. ESOS Ges eT ee 
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 225 
has not been confined to the cattle-growers of the United 
States, but has overflowed the borders into Mexico and 
Canada and now bids fair to leave a similar impress on 
the beef-producing herds of those countries. 
259. Merits of Herefords.— For some years the appre- 
ciation of the Herefords was based mainly on their ability to 
withstand hardships and produce beef on grass and under 
the rigorous conditions of the range. Later, when the con- 
ditions on the ranges had changed somewhat, the range- 
raised grade Hereford steers found their way into the feed- 
lots of the corn-growing states, where they gave an even 
better account of themselves in the matter of quick-feeding, 
economy of production, and quality of product when 
finished, than they did on the ranges. At first only steers 
two years old and over were admitted to the feed-lots, 
but later high-grade steer calves of this breed were taken 
directly from the range into the feed-lots. This opened up 
a new field in the production of high-class beef. The 
experiments in full-feeding high-grade calves were so 
satisfactory that a great demand for this class of feeding 
cattle has resulted: The calves are taken from their 
mothers on the range at weaning age in the fall and are 
shipped directly to the feed-lots, where they are full-fed 
and grazed for about twelve months. Then, as yearlings, 
they go to market weighing 1000 to 1200 pounds, where 
they are known as “ baby beef,” a product that is not 
produced so successfully and profitably from the grades 
of any other breed of cattle as from the Hereford. 
At the time that Hereford bulls were introduced on 
the ranches, herds of pure-bred Herefords in America 
were few in number and small in size, so that they were 
unable more than partially to supply this demand, with 
the result that Hereford bulls were high in price. This 
Q
-P-A-G-E-260
  226 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
awakened a lively interest in the breed, such as had not 
been experienced, and a number of new herds were estab- 
lished. To supply the demand for bulls, importations 
of breeding herds were made from England in such num- 
bers and in such rapid succession in the years 1880 to 
1886, that it looked as though the registered stock which 
was limited to the place of their origin, would become 
exhausted. During this period several thousand head 
were imported and many new herds were established, 
mainly in the cattle-feeding states. Herefords were 
exhibited at all the leading fairs. A fat-stock show was 
inaugurated at Chicago in 1879, and a few years later 
another at Kansas City, Missouri. Steers were secured 
from the available supply and exhibited with remarkable 
success. While the Herefords were able to secure a 
goodly share of the prizes in the older classes and in the 
champion rings at these fat-stock shows, yet it was soon 
observed that they were nearly always successful in the 
younger classes. 
Owing to the shortness of the legs, and general roundness 
of body of the Herefords, they are frequently misjudged 
as to their weight, and are generally thought to be 
smaller in size than some of the other beef breeds of cattle. 
A comparison of the official weights of the prize-winners 
in the classes for Herefords and Shorthorns at the now 
American Royal Live-Stock Show at Kansas City, Mis- 
souri, showed practically no difference in the average 
weights of the prize-winners in the classes for bulls and 
cows two years old and over. But in the classes for calves 
and yearlings, the average weights were always decidedly 
in favor of the Herefords. 
Although in the importations of breeding Herefords 
that were made in the year 1880 to 1886, all the animals

-P-A-G-E-263
   THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 227 
imported were not high-class specimens, there were among 
them many of the very best cattle both individually and 
in breeding to be had in England. From individuals of 
these importations have been developed families or strains 
that have become very popular. On the foundation of 
these importations the American breeder has made a very 
great improvement in the conformation of the Hereford. 
260. Description. — The most distinctive feature of 
the Hereford to the ordinary observer is his color markings, 
or the distribution over the body of the red and white 
colors. The head, including jaws and throat, is white, 
with white under the neck, down the breast, under the 
belly and more or less on the legs. The bush of the tail 
is also white, and there is a white strip on the top of the 
neck from about the middle thereof to the top of the shoul- 
ders. The body, sides ofithe neck, and usually some parts 
of the legs, are red. The red in different animals varies 
from very. light or yellow-red, as it is termed, to very dark 
red. An animal is classed in point of color as a light red, 
a medium red ora dark red. The foregoing is the popu- 
lar distribution of the colors of the Hereford, yet there is 
sometimes a considerable variation therefrom in different 
animals. While asa breed of cattle they are very uniform 
in conformation and color markings, yet they do not by 
any means have the same degree of uniformity as the 
self-colored undomesticated animals. 
The head of the Hereford (Plate VIII) is short, with 
broad forehead; the eyes are full and not sunken; the 
horns are usually rather strong and of a whitish yellow 
color, free from black tips, in the best types, and come 
forward with a more or less drooping tendency; the 
neck is short and thick, merging smoothly into the 
shoulders, free from surplus skin in the under parts; 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
228 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
‘the hide is heavy, loose and very pliable, and covered 
with a dense, soft coat of hair. The body of a well- 
fattened Hereford should be free from any paunchiness. 
The breast should be broad and full, but free from 
loose dewlap, the shoulders smoothly laid and broad on 
top, but not too open between the blades. The crops 
should be wide, the ribs well sprung and extending well 
backward, the loin broad and of good length, the hook 
bones by no means prominent, but down within the lines 
of the ribs, the tail-head on a line with the level of the back, 
and the rump-bones 
wide apart and well 
up, so as not. ito 
present a drooping 
appearance. The legs 
should be short, 
straight, strong in 
bone and set well 
apart. The line of 
the back should be 
practically straight and level from top of shoulders to the 
tail-head. The quarters should be full and well rounded, 
and the outlines of the animal, when viewed from the side, 
should present a somewhat box-like appearance, and from 
the end more that of a barrel (Figs. 36, 37). 
The Hereford has great length and thickness of loin, and 
all the bones of his frame are so well covered that they can 
scarcely be felt through the thick covering of flesh. Along 
his back from shoulder to rump his spine is so deeply 
buried in flesh that the vertebra are not perceptible to 
the touch except at the small indentations, commonly 
called ties, near the middle of the back. These ties, 
usually one to three in number, are the attachments of 
  Fic. 36.— Hereford bull.
-P-A-G-E-265
    THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 229 
the skin to a few of the forward lumbar vertebrae, and are 
common to all cattle. The indentations are caused by the 
uplifting of the skin surrounding the tie by a great 
deposit of flesh along the spinal column. When of a 
pronounced character, these ties are not looked on with 
much favor by the breeders of fancy Herefords, as they 
detract somewhat from the smooth, rounded appearance 
of the body, although they are a very reliable indication 
of the great depth of flesh that covers the frame of the 
animal. Breeders sometimes loosen these ties in animals 
they are fitting for 
exhibition by a slight 
surgical operation, 
that is not very diffi- 
cult of execution, 
whereby the depres- 
sion in the skin dis- 
appears and leaves the 
back perfectly smooth 
and even. 
The coat of hair of the Hereford is regarded by the 
breeders as a feature of much importance. The preference 
is that it should be long, soft and curly, as indicative of a 
certain degree of quality in the animal. Such coats are 
regarded as furnishing some protection against cold in 
winter and, in some animals, a protection against flies 
in summer. At the great fairs and other shows, much 
care is taken by the Hereford exhibitors to have the coats 
of their animals properly cleaned and manipulated, so 
as to present a curly appearance and set off the form of 
the animal to the best advantage. 
The most valuable characteristic of the Hereford is his 
disposition to accumulate flesh at all ages. The Hereford     Fic. 37.— Hereford cow.
-P-A-G-E-266
  230 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
is almost universally credited with being a superior rustler 
under range conditions. His ability to withstand rigor- 
ous conditions is due mostly to his capacity and diligence 
in laying up stores of flesh during the season of plenty on 
which he may draw in a season of want. The superior 
fleshing disposition of the Hereford has been demonstrated 
many times in the feed-lots of the corn-belt, where large 
numbers of the grades of all breeds are collected and fed 
for market under like conditions, and the Herefords are 
the first to be shipped to the market. 
261. Uses.— This breed makes no claim to milk- 
production, and no efforts have been made in America to 
develop this faculty. 
Hereford cattle are primarily beef animals, and in this 
capacity they stand in the first rank. They are especially 
valuable for the production of “baby beef.” In the 
matter of early maturity, they are unexcelled. 
262. Feeding. — The strong point with the Hereford in 
the production of beef is his ability to grow and develop 
on, grass alone. He was developed in a great grazing 
district, and his first reputation was based on his capacity 
for converting grass into beef. While he surpasses other 
breeds as a grazier, he is equally prominent in the.feed-lot. 
All cattle feeds are acceptable to him, and he responds 
as promptly as any to a ration of grain. 
263. Distribution. — The Hereford has been introduced 
and used extensively in most parts of the world where 
attempts have been made to improve the cattle grown 
mainly for beef purposes. They were in use in consider- 
able numbers in Australia and New Zealand some years 
before they were brought to America to any extent. Large 
herds of registered Herefords are now established in these 
countries, and a herd-book society has been organized that 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
   THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 231 
publishes a registry for the breed in that section. Some 
years ago an importation of Herefords was made from Aus- 
tralia to California for the foundation of a herd in that 
state. The Herefords have been taken to several of the 
South American countries, mainly to Argentina and 
Uruguay. 
In recent years some Herefords have been taken to 
Cuba and Porto Rico, to some of the Central American 
states and to the Sandwich islands, where they are re- 
ported as doing extremely well. The breed is preémi- 
nently adapted to the range, with its vicissitudes of cold 
and scant vegetation. For this reason, in the United 
States they are found mainly west of the Mississippi, 
although herds are maintained in New England. It 
has already been said that the breed has made its way into 
Canada and Mexico. 
264. Organizations and records. — The first organiza- 
tion of the breeders of Hereford cattle in America was 
the Breeders’ Live-Stock Association, organized in 1878, 
at Beecher, Illinois. It undertook the publication of a 
monthly periodical called the Breeders’ Journal, which 
was devoted mainly to presenting the merits of Hereford 
cattle. At the same time it inaugurated a herd-book — 
the American Hereford Record, of which Volume I ap- 
peared in 1880, and Volume IT in 1882. In 1883, it dis- 
banded, having sold its interest in this Record to the 
American Hereford Cattle Breeders’ Association, which 
was organized at Chicago, in June, 1881, and was incor- 
porated under the laws of Illinois in 1883. At the second 
meeting of this Association, in November, 1881, the total 
enrollment of breeders as members numbered thirty-four. 
In 1883, it purchased the copyright and unsold copies 
of Volumes I and II of the American Hereford Record. 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
232 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
It continued the publication of the herd-books, and forty 
volumes have been published to date. There are “now 
over 6300 members in the Association. 
The entry numbers in the American Hereford Record 
at the time of its purchase by its present owners were a 
little over 6000. These numbers were assigned to both 
male and females entries, and were very largely of ancestors 
of cattle owned in America. At the present time the 
number of entries is over 500,000. The rules do not 
require an entry to be made until the animal is nearly 
two years old, although the application for entrance must 
be filed with the office before the animal is six months old. 
The office of the American Hereford Cattle Breeders’ 
Association is in Kansas City, Missouri. 
The Hereford Herd-book of England appeared in 1846. 
The Hereford Herd-book Society of England was or- 
ganized in 1878, since which time it has been responsible 
for the publication of the herd-book. A herd-book 
society has been organized and a registry published for 
the Hereford breeders of Australia and New Zealand. 
Herd-books have also been established for the breed in 
Argentina and Uruguay. 
265. Double-Standard Polled Herefords. — Since the 
introduction into the United States of the polled breeds 
of cattle from Scotland, the hornless feature in cattle 
has found favor with some of the breeders and admirers 
of the Hereford. The fact that Hereford feeding steers 
that have been artificially made polled or dehorned are so 
much preferred in the feed-lots to those that are horned 
has led a few breeders to undertake to establish a strain 
of registered Herefords that are naturally polled or hornless. 
This has been accomplished in the case of the Shorthorn 
breed of cattle, and is in a fair way to be realized in the
-P-A-G-E-269
   THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 233 
Hereford. However desirable the hornless feature may 
or may not be (there is a great difference of opinion among 
breeders on this subject), the elimination of the horns from 
the Hereford by a natural process has been no easy under- 
taking. Of the more than 240,000 registered Herefords 
that have been bred in this country in the past quarter of 
a century, a very few, possibly less than twenty head from 
horned sire and dam, have been naturally polled. 
The great rarity of sports of this kind among the Here- 
fords has made the establishment of a strain of registered 
Polled Herefords a slow and difficult undertaking. How- 
ever, several breeders are now devoting themselves to this 
work with considerable enthusiasm and some degree of 
success. At the present time there are about one hundred 
head of all ages of naturally Polled Herefords that are 
registered in the American Hereford Record. These 
Polled Herefords are denominated by their breeders 
Double-Standard Polled Herefords, to distinguish them 
from a class of polled cattle that are registered in the herd- 
book for Polled Herefords exclusively, but are not eligible 
to record in the American Hereford Record. 
The difficulties that the breeders of Polled Herefords 
have encountered are two-fold. In the first place, the 
scarcity of material to work on has necessitated very 
close breeding, in order to preserve the hornless feature. 
In the second place, those hornless sports were unfor- 
tunately not high-class either individually or in breeding, 
so that in strengthening the desired hornless feature by 
close breeding, the breeders at the same time were fixing 
in their cattle some undesirable features in other respects. 
By careful breeding and feeding, these difficulties will be 
overcome in time, but it will take a much longer time under 
the conditions that prevail to establish a strain of Here-
-P-A-G-E-270
234 ' THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
fords that will be popular because of their meritorious 
qualities other than the polled condition. 
Two associations of the breeders of Polled Herefords 
have been organized, one of which is called the American 
Polled Hereford Cattle Club, with the office of its secretary 
at Des Moines, Iowa. The other organization is called 
the National Polled Hereford Breeders’ Association, and 
has its office in Chicago, Illinois. Both of these small or- 
ganizations have begun the preparation of herd-books for 
Polled Herefords, accepting for registration the double- 
standard: variety of Polled Herefords, and also other 
naturally Polled Herefords that are not eligible to registry 
in the American Hereford Record. 
Literature. — In England there is a History of Hereford Cattle, 
by Macdonald and Sinclair (1886), that is very valuable, as treating 
of this breed in its native home. An excellent history of Hereford 
Cattle by Alvin H. Sanders has just been published by the Breeders’ 
Gazette of Chicago.

By John 8S. Goodwin 
266. The Aberdeen-Angus is a breed of cattle main- 
tained primarily for beef-production. It is a hornless or 
muley type. 
267. Origin. — Hornless cattle have existed for many 
centuries. Disregarding the uncertain, although probable, 
references of four to five thousand years ago, such cattle 
are definitely mentioned by Tacitus, the Roman historian. 
Herds of hornless cattle, at different times, have come into 
existence in various parts of the world. One of the largest 
of these is found in South America; another has grown up
-P-A-G-E-271
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 
in Austria, and, within the last few years, hornless cat 
have been developed among the well-established horned 
breeds, such as the Hereford, Jersey and Shorthorn, with 
which the wearing of horns seemed to be a fixed trait. 
Many words have been used to express this hornless con- 
dition in cattle, and they are known variously as humblies 
(humlies), muleys, doddies, hornless and polled. The 
latter term has become most generally in use to designate 
the Scotch hornless cattle. All of these words simply 
mean “ lacking horns.” 
268. History in Scotland. — In Scotland, two breeds 
of such cattle have existed so long that history does not 
record their origins. These are the Galloway, whose 
habitat is the southwestern coast of Scotland, and the 
Aberdeen-Angus, which had its origin in the northeastern 
part of Scotland. It is somewhat difficult to describe 
these breeds so that representatives of each may be 
readily distinguished; both are hornless, both black and 
both come from Scotland. Generally speaking, the 
Galloways are much longer-haired, larger-boned, more 
square-framed and somewhat slower-maturing, while the 
Aberdeen-Angus are sleek-haired, small-boned, round in 
the barrel and hind-quarters and early-maturing. 
The earliest attempt to improve the polled cattle of 
the northeast of Scotland began in Angusshire, which is 
now a part of Forfarshire, and was undertaken by the late 
Hugh Watson of Keillor. His ancestors had been breeding 
these cattle on the Keillor farm for more than two hundred * 
years when Hugh Watson began in 1805. Not many 
years later, cattle-breeders in Aberdeenshire began im- 
proving the same kind of cattle, and a considerable rivalry 
sprang up between the different localities. According to 
the location, the cattle were known as the Angus Doddies    
     
-P-A-G-E-272
     THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
id as Buchan Humblies, and yet again as Polled Aber- 
deens. The word polled was used to indicate the hornless 
Aberdeenshire cattle and thus to distinguish them from 
another breed, now almost extinct, which inhabited the 
same shire and had horns. 
At a still later time the breeders of these hornless cattle 
in the various parts of northeastern Scotland came to- 
gether, and, deciding that the cattle were all of one breed, 
proceeded to choose a suitable name. To please the par- 
tisans of the two districts in which most of these cattle 
were then to be found, the name adopted was Polled 
Aberdeen-or-Angus cattle. This name became shortened 
by dropping out the word “or” and putting a hyphen 
in its place. 
It has been further abbreviated, because of the passing 
of the horned breed, to Aberdeen-Angus, the word polled 
being now deemed unnecessary. This idea has been 
adopted also by the Polled Galloway breeders, so that their 
breed is now known as Galloway cattle. Both in Scotland 
and America, even the name of Aberdeen-Angus has been 
shortened, and in Scotland the cattle are generally re- 
ferred to as the Polled cattle, while in America they are 
called the Angus cattle. 
~————fiése Aberdeen-Angus cattle have been great favorites 
in Scotland for more than a century, but unfortunately 
on two occasions diseases attacked the cattle in that 
country and decimated the herds. Later, when the 
government had stamped out these diseases, the cattle 
again began multiplying, and soon assumed an important 
place among the domestic animals of the kingdom. The 
World’s Fair held at Paris, France, in 1878, gave the breed 
an opportunity to demonstrate its great merit, and, with 
only fifteen representatives, it won the champion-herd
-P-A-G-E-273
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 237 
prize against nearly two thousand other cattle of various 
breeds shown in competition, every animal of the Aber- 
deen-Angus breed receiving either a prize or an honorable 
mention. About this time the breed was introduced into 
England, and a little later into Ireland. ‘ 
269. History in America. — The Paris successes led 
some of the former breeders of these cattle, then in America, 
to bring over a few of their early favorites in 1878, and 
from that time this breed of cattle has grown rapidly in 
public favor until it is now recognized as one of the prin- 
cipal beef breeds of this country. In 1872, two bulls 
were sent to western Kansas, but no females accompanied 
that importation. It was the marketing of the steers 
from these two animals that first attracted attention to 
this breed in Kansas City. Other importations were 
made as follows: In 1876, two bulls and a cow, by the 
Ontario Agricultural College; in 1878, one bull and five 
cows, by Anderson & Findlay, Lake Forest, Illinois ; 
in 1879, by F. B. Redfield, Batavia, New York; in 
1880, by George Whitfield, Rougemont, Province of 
Quebec. Since that time many importations have been 
made. 
The lack of horns wassuch an unusual condition that it 
excited much comment and not a little opposition. When 
breeders and feeders began to consider this feature, its 
decided advantage so appealed to them that a perfect 
furor of dehorning swept over the country. Horns were 
sawed off from aged animals, and horn-cores were gouged 
out or burnt off of calves, until dehorned market cattle 
became the rule instead of the exception. The Aber- 
deen-Angus bull has become a prime favorite as a dehorner. 
Crossed with the ordinary native cow, about 90 to 95 
per cent of the offspring are black in color and hornless,
-P-A-G-E-274
  238 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
although occasionally scurs appear, which, however, are 
no detriment from the feeder’s point of view. 
The Aberdeen-Angus cattle rapidly rose in public favor. 
Sales were held at various points, and the cattle were 
scattered over a large territory. Perhaps there is no other 
instance in which a new and practically unknown breed 
has sprung at once into such prominence and has main- 
tained so high a position. 
270. Description. —Aberdeen-Angus cattle are dis- 
tinguished by the following breed characteristics (Figs. 
38, 39): black color, polled heads (Plate VIII), rotund 
compact type, smoothness of conformation, short legs, 
evenness of flesh 
when fat, and deep, 
full hind-quarters. 
They are uniform in 
type, take on flesh 
evenly, dress a large 
percentage of high- 
class beef, and, as a 
tule, reach in the 
hands of experienced 
feeders a degree of primeness rarely equaled. ‘The mar- 
bling of their flesh, 7.e., its proportion and blending of lean 
meat and fat, is also a characteristic. In slaughter tests 
they have been uniformly successful in competition with 
other cattle, their fineness of bone and high percentage 
of muscle or lean meat giving them dressing scores which 
average above those of competitors. In hardiness and 
prolificacy they do not differ materially from other breeds. 
The females, usually good average milkers, are always 
capable of raising their own offspring. 
In the early days of the breed there was not so much 
  Fig. 38.— Aberdeen-Angus bull.
-P-A-G-E-275
CRM ECON Re eR ERU OM IAT ne Toe ce TAY ee ROR ae 
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 239 
attention paid to what is now known as the fine points, 
but all of the care was directed to the individual merit. 
Color was a secondary consideration, and, while the great 
majority of the cattle were black, yet many good ones 
were marked with a dun-colored stripe down the back, 
while others were brindled, and still others were black 
and white, and not infrequently calves came of a peculiar 
pale red color caused 
by the absence of the 
black pigment, which 
is a characteristic of 
the breed. It was 
Hugh Watson of 
Keillor who first de- 
termined on the de- 
sirability of a uniform 
color in the breed, and who declared himself for the “ Black 
and all black; the Angus Doddie, and no Surrender ! ” 
Not so much care was exercised then as now in the choice 
of the sires, and in some cases animals were used that had 
rudimentary horns called scurs.. These are small horn- 
like excrescences, that are not attached to the skull, and 
have no horn core. This condition is not considered to 
represent any impurity of the blood, but simply is a hark- 
ing back to a time when the progenitors of these. cattle 
were horned. Scurs are extremely objectionable from the 
present standpoint, and males so marked are debarred 
from registration. The fashion in color also demands 
that no white should appear above the under-line, but a 
white udder is said to be an indication of a good milch 
cow. The demand for solid black color is carried, perhaps, 
beyond the proper point. There have been a number of 
attempts to get together the red-colored females and to       Fie. 39. — Aberdeen-Angus cow.
-P-A-G-E-276
240 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
establish that color, but with only limited success, the 
offspring born of red parents coming true too frequently 
to the characteristic black color. 
271. Uses of Aberdeen-Angus cattle.— The breed 
has not been developed particularly for milk-production, 
but in some herds attention has been given to this quality 
with the result that, more particularly in New Zealand, 
entire dairies are now composed of Aberdeen-Angus cows ; 
and in 1895, an Aberdeen-Angus cow was the champion 
at the Dairy Show held in London. 
The cattle and their grades are more especially noted 
for the wealth of flesh carried on very short legs, and are 
easy keepers and early maturing. For twenty years 
this breed uniformly topped the Chicago market each 
year with one exception, and in that year the Pittsburgh 
market paid a higher price than any other, and the 
Aberdeen-Angus topped that market. Their winnings 
in the International Live-stock Exposition are matters ° 
of current history, and they have never failed of represen- 
tation among the prize-winners, both as single animals 
and in carload lots. 
For crossing or grading, the Aberdeen-Angus is in the 
front rank. On common stock, the bulls get market cattle 
of high merit. As dehorners, the bulls of this breed are 
unexcelled. A wider use of these bulls in grading would 
be beneficial. 
272. Distribution. —Cattle of this breed are found in 
Scotland, England, Ireland, Germany, France, Denmark, 
Sandwich Islands, New Zealand, South America, Canada | 
and the United States. In America, the breed is repre- 
sented in not less than forty-two states-and_territories. 
Especially adapted to the rich prairie lands of the Middle 
West, Aberdeen-Angus cattle for years have been most 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
   THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 241 
numerous in the states of Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, 
Kansas, Ohio and Nebraska, in the order given. How- 
ever, they are widely distributed, and in recent years | 
have increased substantially in popular favor in the South, | 
Southwest, West and Northwest. Preéminently a feeder’s | 
beast, the Aberdeen-Angus not only is highly prized by \. 
beef-producers in the corn-belt, but graziers and ranchmen 
of the plains region of the West, Southwest and North- 
west find it a profitable breed for their conditions. It is in 
the surplus corn states, however, that Aberdeen-Angus 
cattle appear to reach their highest excellence. 
273. Organizations and records. — The two leading” 
organizations concerned with the advancement of the 
interests of Aberdeen-Angus cattle are the Polled Cattle 
Society of Scotland, organized in 1879, and the American 
Aberdeen-Angus Breeders’ Association, organized in 1883, 
with headquarters in the Live-Stock Record Building, 
Chicago. Thirty-eight volumes of the Polled Cattle Herd- 
book have been issued since 1862. When the Polled Cattle 
Herd-book was first established in Scotland, Galloway 
cattle were recorded in it as well (in first four volumes), but 
all animals of that breed were designated by an asterisk 
placed in front of their names, and no animals were accepted 
that were a cross between the Aberdeen-Angus and the 
Galloway, but both breeds were kept distinct. Since 1886, 
the American association has published twenty-four vol- 
umes of its herd-book. Over 197,000 Aberdeen-Angus 
cattle have been registered in the American herd-book, 
but of course a considerable proportion of these were the 
foundation animals whose pedigrees were taken from the 
Scotch herd-book; about 15 per cent of the annual prod- 
uce of pure-bred herds is not recorded. There are now 
about 3200 members in the American association.

There are also several state organizations, as the Indiana, 
Towa and Nebraska Aberdeen-Angus Breeders’ Associa- 
tions. These have memberships of seventy-five to one 
hundred and fifty persons, hold regular annual meetings, 
appropriate money for special prizes at the state fairs, 
and in other ways seek to promote the interests of the 
breed.

274. The Galloway is a breed of beef cattle which 
derives its name from the province of Galloway, Scotland. 
Galloway now embraces only the Stewartry of Kirkeud- 
bright and the shire of Wigton, the two southwest counties 
of Scotland, but formerly comprised the six counties lying 
south of the Firth of Forth. 
275. History in Scotland. — The origin of the Galloway 
cattle is lost in the mists of antiquity. When the Romans 
first visited Britain the country was covered with dense 
forests. ‘In these forests the Romans found many wild 
cattle roaming at their will, and it is now conceded 
that they were the progenitors of our modern breed of 
Galloways. Cattle-breeding has been the principal busi- 
ness among Galloway farmers since earliest times of which 
we have record. A history of Scotland alluding to the 
time prior to and including the reign of Alexander III 
(1249) says: “‘ Black cattle were reared in great numbers

THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 243 
during the Scoto-Saxon period.” George Buchanan, 
tutor to James I, of England, writing about, 1566, says 
of Galloway: “It is more fruitful in cattle than in 
corn.” 
The breed was of great importance during the Scoto- 
Saxon period. In the early ages dairying was an object 
of considerable attention. Large quantities of cheese 
were made and the people consumed much animal flesh. 
There was also an extensive export trade in hides. Ata 
later period, immediately after the union of England and 
Scotland, the farmers of England became extensive pur- 
chasers of Galloway cattle. During this activity the 
Galloways found much favor among the graziers of the 
south of England and the butchers of Smithfield market, 
and they invariably sold at an average price £2 a head 
above that of any other breed of the same weight. The 
breed was much improved during this period as well as 
later when turnip husbandry was introduced into the 
province of Galloway. A circumstance worthy of atten- 
tion is that the breed has never been affected by crossing 
with any other breed. The improvement has been brought 
about entirely by the diligent attention and careful 
management of the breeders of Galloway and of the corn- 
belt of America. 
Although the Galloway is the oldest of the pure breeds 
of Britain, there has been very little written about the 
breed, and the records that were collected during the 
early part of the last century were destroyed by fire 
in the Highland and Agricultural Society’s Museum 
and Records in Edinburgh in 1851. Some time later, 
about the year 1862, a book of pedigrees was compiled, 
which contained pedigrees of both Aberdeen-Angus and 
Galloways. Still a little later, about the year 1878, the 
   
-P-A-G-E-282
244 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Galloway Cattle Society of Great Britain, with the able 
assistance of the secretary, Rev. John Gillispie, of Dum- 
friesshire, Scotland, published the first book of Galloway 
pedigrees which is recognized by Galloway associations 
at present. 
276. History in America.— The breed was formally in- 
troduced into America by an importation made by Graham 
Brothers, Ontario, Canada, in 1853, although it has been 
said that one or two individuals were seen in this country 
before that time. The cattle of the first importation 
adapted themselves_so readily to Canadian conditions 
that many large shipments quickly followed, until now 
the hornless, shaggy blacks are found in all the provinces 
of Canada and nearly every state in the Union. The 
breed made its way into the United States slowly at first. 
A few head were brought into Michigan in 1870, and from 
there spread into other central and western states. 
277. Description. — The typical modern Galloway is a 
low, blocky animal, with a long, soft, shaggy coat of black 
hair, hornless, well 
sprung in the ribs, the 
whole make-up re- 
sembling a barrel in 
shape, which is evenly 
covered with juicy, 
lean flesh. (Figs. 40, 
3 41. Plate IX.) The 
Ta! 40= “Galloway bull: Galloways have been 
hornless from time 
immemorial. Some writers mention a tradition to the 
effect that in remote ages they were provided with horns; 
however, notices of the breed centuries ago invariably 
state that Galloways were hornless. If any so-called 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
     
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 245 
Galloway presents the slightest appearance of horns, he 
should be rejected as impure. 
278. Use for milk.— The Galloways, as a breed, can- 
not lay claim to any superiority as milkers. Although 
many herds have been kept for centuries in the south of 
Scotland for dairy pur- 
poses, yet, as a whole, 
the breed has been im- 
proved chiefly along the 
lines of beef-produc- 
tion. Some breeders 
in Scotland have de- 
veloped the milking 
faculty of their herds 
to a very high degree 
by systematically dis- 
posing of cows that 
proved shy milkers. 
It is not an uncom- 
mon thing in the corn- 
belt of this country to 
find Galloway cows that produce large quantities of milk. 
Some of the most noted show-cows exhibited in recent 
years gave large quantities of very rich milk during their 
milking season. The United States Government recently 
purchased a number of animals of the milking strains and 
sent them to Alaska for dairy purposes. Many favorable 
reports have been received from Alaska since these hardy 
blacks arrived at their new home. They seem to be as 
well adapted to the rigors of the northern climate as 
they are to the inclement weather found among the 
rugged hills and fertile glens of their native land in 
southwestern Scotland.

-P-A-G-E-284
  246 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
279. Use for beef. — It is chiefly as a beef-producing 
breed that the Galloways are famous. The quality of 
their beef attracted much attention in the British markets 
centuries ago, and they had the distinction of being classed 
as “prime scots”’ at Smithfield long before these cattle 
were known to the feeders of the corn-belt or the cow-men 
of the western plains. The superiority of the Galloway 
beef arises from the fact that it is always well marbled 
and possesses a large proportion of lean meat intermixed. 
with fat. The packers and butchers have been striving 
to educate breeders, stockmen and farmers to breed 
animals with a greater proportion of natural flesh and less 
wasteful fat. The Galloway has long been bred with 
this essential feature in view, and thus he leads his rivals 
in this respect, and brings higher returns per hundred 
pounds live weight. 
This breed has been vastly improved since its introduc- 
tion into the corn-belt. Greater weights have been secured 
in shorter time than was customary twenty-five years 
ago, and the early-maturing feature has been much in 
evidence. In the past, the statement has been advanced 
by some persons that one could not mature the Galloways 
so soon as individuals of other beef breeds. One need 
only visit some of the leading Galloway herds throughout 
the country, or review the various ages and classes of 
individuals presented every year at the national shows, 
to be convinced of the error of this statement. Ex- 
perienced authorities who have handled two or more of 
the leading beef breeds under similar conditions maintain 
that the Galloways mature at any age just about as readily 
as individuals of any other beef breed. To-day, the Gallo- 
ways have many claims to favoritism. Experiments 
at various agricultural experiment stations show that while
-P-A-G-E-285
      THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 247 
they do not attain so great size as some of the other beef 
breeds, yet they are more economical feeders, especially 
where a large proportion of roughage has to be consumed. 
When the numbers of each breed are considered, the Gallo- 
ways top the market at the great live-stock centers as 
often as any other breed. The killing qualities are in 
their favor because, as a rule, the Galloways have com- 
paratively little offal or excess fat, and consequently they 
dress a very high percentage of marketable beef. 
280. Use for hides. —In midsummer the hide of the 
Galloway has no greater comparative value than that of 
any other breed. From November to March, however, 
when the coat of hair is long and at its best, the Galloway 
hide is worth five to eight cents per pound more than the 
hide of an animal of any other breed. There was a time 
when the western plains were covered with buffalo, which 
. produced millions of robes, but these animals are now 
almost extinct, and the Galloway is the only domestic 
animal of the bovine race that can roam the plains and 
produce a superior quality of beef and robes that can 
take the place of the hides of the buffalo of days gone by. 
281. Use for grazing. — As grazers, the Galloways are 
seldom equaled and never excelled. It has already been 
mentioned that the habitat of the Galloway was for 
centuries in the southwest of Scotland. They were often 
kept on the hills where the pasture was scant, and they 
invariably gave a good account of themselves. They re- 
spond readily to the luxuriant pasture of the valleys, but 
thrive and seem contented on the bleak, scant forage of 
the moorland. For a time they had a struggle for existence 
in this country, due to the keenness of their rivalry with 
the other beef breeds. Their persistent struggles and 
many victories in the show-yard in recent years, however,
-P-A-G-E-286
  248 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
have established a place for them in the corn-belt and the 
ranges of the West and Southwest, which will undoubtedly 
continue as long as our cattle industry remains. The con- 
stitution which was built up from years of exposure to 
inclement weather in Scotland furnishes the breed with 
the required merit to recommend it for the vast graz- 
ing ranges of the Northwest, West and Southwest. In 
summer on the range, the Galloway will make as good 
gains on luxuriant pasture as any breed, and will hold 
his own and often thrive on scant pastures or on drought- 
stricken regions where cattle of other breeds cannot 
exist. While the hardy constitution is put forward as 
a special merit, however, one should not forget that 
Galloways prefer luxuriant forage just as much as the 
softer breeds, and will give increased returns from good 
feed and care. 
On the range where different breeds have been wintered 
it has been found that during severe storms the mortality 
among Galloways is much less, and the loss in weight due 
to disagreeable weather much smaller, than is usually in 
evidence among individuals of the less hardy breeds. 
The Galloway calves are very active and hardy when 
dropped on the open range, and are soon able to rustle 
for themselves. In summer they can endure the broiling 
sun and withstand the severest storms in winter. 
282. Use for crossing. — For prepotency, this breed 
stands in the first rank. It is conceded that the Galloway 
possesses the ability to perpetuate himself as uniformly in 
size, quality and color as any other breed. The stockman 
must have a uniform bunch of hornless steers in order 
to command top prices. By the use of a good Galloway 
bull on average cows the best results are invariably secured. 
The Galloway as a dehorner stands high among the polled 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
   THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 249 
breeds. In this day when practically all feeding cattle 
are dehorned, the naturally polled cattle have a decided 
advantage over their horned rivals, as the dehorning 
process is many times dangerous and occasionally fatal, 
and in every instance it causes a temporary shrinkage in 
weight and tardiness in growth of animals. 
For crossing with other breeds, especially with the 
Shorthorns, they are very valuable. The outcome of 
the cross of Shorthorn bulls on Galloway cows are usually 
known as “ blue-grays.” This system of crossing has 
been practiced for many years in Great Britain and to 
some extent in this country, and the results have been 
very satisfactory. The Shorthorn furnishes plenty of 
size, while the Galloway forms the low type and large 
proportion of natural flesh, qualities which up-to-date 
feeders and butchers are constantly demanding. When a 
pure-bred animal is crossed on any grade beef or dairy 
cow, the results are surprising and the offspring is in- 
variably hornless, black in color and uniform in make-up. 
Galloway bulls are used very freely in the dairy districts 
of Great Britain, and the black calves sell at much better 
prices than those from bulls of the dairy breeds. 
283. Distribution. —Galloways are found mainly in 
Scotland, Canada and the United States, but in smaller 
numbers are distributed also in England, Ireland, Russia, 
South Africa, Argentina, Mexico and Alaska. Recently 
the United States Government has introduced them into 
the Philippine Islands, where they are making a very 
satisfactory cross with the native cattle.

285. Sussex cattle are so called from the county of 
that name in England, where they most abound. They 
are distinctly a beef breed. | 
286. History in England. — The origin of the Sussex, 
like that of all the oldest breeds of English cattle, is in- 
volved in obscurity. According to Youatt and Martin, 
some of the ancient Britons fled before the advance of their 
enemies to the Weald of East Sussex and carried with eee 
their cattle, or found there some of the native cattle of 
the country, and zealously guarded them against all ad- 
mixture. Alfred Heasman, editor of the first three 
volumes of the Sussex Herd-book, and author of a chapter 
on Sussex cattle in ‘The Cattle of the British Isles,” 
doubts whether the breed was imported or found native to 
the country on the advent of William the Conqueror and
-P-A-G-E-289
        THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 251 
his followers. Be this as it may, the breed is universally 
recognized to be a distinct one. It has been a prominent 
feature of Sussex from time immemorial, and has pre- 
served, unchanged through all vicissitudes, the same 
characteristics, — great weight, aptitude to fatten, and 
red color,.— except in so far as improved by better feeding 
and greater care. Originally they were used chiefly for 
draft purposes, their great size and strength and activity, 
withal, enabling them to draw promptly the heaviest loads 
and till the stiffest soil. But, even in remote times, the 
quality of their flesh was highly prized and, when the oxen 
became aged, they were bought up, grazed a year, and 
supplied the markets with animals weighing 180 to 200 
stone (a stone is about 14 pounds avoirdupois, making 
the weight 2500 to 2800 pounds). 
These cattle have always been the favorite of the 
tenant farmer (than whom there is no better judge of 
a profitable animal) of Sussex and adjacent counties, 
and have constituted for many years one of the chief 
attractions at the local stock shows. More recently, 
stimulated by the exportation of large numbers of 
the principal breeds at fancy prices, some of the English 
breeders have sought to bring forward the Sussex more 
prominently at all of the leading shows of the British 
Isles. ‘ 
287. History in America. — The date of the first im- 
portation to America is uncertain. Since 1880, a number 
of importations have been made. In 1884, the writer 
imported a number of this breed of cattle for his farm in 
Tennessee. In 1891, the Ontario Agricultural College at 
Guelph, Canada, made an importation.

ribs broad ; loin thickly fleshed ; hip-bone not very large, 
and well covered; rump flat and long; tail with white 
brush, which should drop perpeeeie'y ; thigh flat

few gray or white hairs, | 
nearly always single, except on the foretop, are regarded © 
most favorably.” (Figs. 42, 43.) 
The special merits claimed for the breed are large size, 
early maturity, propensity to fatten, prime quality of 
flesh laid on the most desirable parts, hardihood of con- 
    Fic. 43.— Sussex cow. 
   
-P-A-G-E-291
THE BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE 253 
stitution, uniform popular color and capacity to im- 
press these characteristics on their offspring. 
289. Uses of Sussex cattle. — As the Sussex is pri- 
marily a beef ‘reed, its milk-giving qualities have not 
been esrecially devéloped. At the same time, the cows, 
almost without exception, give milk of most excellent 
quality and, if milked closely, make surprisingly good 
dairy animals. They fatten when dry more readily, 
jerhaps, than the steers. 
The Sussex has achieved the highest honors “on the 
‘ scale and the block.’ The object of the breeders, as a 
class, revealed by the typical Sussex of to-day, has been 
to produce the most profitable butcher’s beast; to hasten 
the period of maturity and improve the quality, without 
forgetting to preserve these most excellent characteristics 
of the breed, — sound constitution, capacity to rustle, 
fecundity and prepotency. About 1500 pounds for cows 
and 2000 pounds for bulls represent the average weights 
of animals in good breeding condition. The average 
weight of a well-fatted bullock, twenty-four months old, 
may be safely put at 1400 pounds. 
The prepotency of Sussex bulls makes them valuable 
for crossing on native or grade stock, to improve the 
beefing qualities and ability to graze. They readily 
stamp their characters on their crosses. 
290. Feeding and care.—The breed responds as 
generously as any to full feeding and care, and thrives 
on rough and scant pasturage. In cold weather, shelter — 
the lee side of a shed, or wind-shield, or straw-stack, if 
no better is obtainable —is a distinct advantage; at 
other seasons, nothing but fair grazing is required. 
291. Distribution. — Sussex cattle are not yet widely 
distributed. Their local habitat is Sussex and the ad-

joining counties in England. They have been exported 
to Canada and the United States, and to South Africa, 
Egypt and South America. 
292. Organizations and records. — At a comparatively 
early date in the history of registration, the Engtish Sussex 
Herd-book Society established the English Sussex Herd- 
book, tracing pedigrees to the year 1855. The Amerizan 
Sussex Register was established in 1889 by the American 
Sussex Cattle Association. Comparatively few Sussex 
cattle have been imported to the United States, and only 
one volume of the Register has been published (1906), 
containing something less than 300 entries.

REPRESENTATIVES of these breeds are alike milky in 
their form — in every way opposed to beefiness, triangular 
instead of rectangular, spare not thickly fleshed, long, lean 
and narrow in head and neck rather than short, broad and 
thick; light in the shoulder, narrow and lean in the chine, 
showing breadth only in the hind-quarters, which like the 
chine are lean and especially light in the thighs. The 
size, shape and texture of the udder should indicate great 
productive capacity.

293. The Jersey is one of the leading dairy breeds of 
cattle. The island of Jersey, eleven miles long and less 
than six miles wide, lying in the English Channel some 
thirty miles from the southern extremity of England and 
about thirteen miles from the coast of France, is its native 
home. 
294. The use of the term Alderney. — In American 
and English writings there has been some confusion in the 
use of the term Alderney, as applied to cattle from the 
Channel islands. In 1844, Colonel Le Couteur wrote an 
article on the “ Jersey Misnamed Alderney Cow.” This 
article was published in the Journal of the Royal Agri- 
255
-P-A-G-E-294
  256 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
cultural Society of England, Vol. 5, page 43, and was 
afterwards copied into the Transactions of the New York 
State Agricultural Society in 1850, and into Volume I of 
the Herd Register of the American Jersey Cattle Club. 
It forms the basis of our knowledge of the early history of 
Channel island cattle. When Channel island cattle were 
first exported to Great Britain, they were collectively 
called Alderneys, because vessels plying between the 
Channel islands and Great Britain cleared from the port. 
of Alderney. The cattle were actually very largely from 
the island of Jersey, since that is the largest island and 
contains the most cattle. The local government of the 
Channel islands is administered through two municipali- 
ties, the one, the states of Jersey, comprising the island | 
of Jersey alone; the other, the states of Guernsey, com- 
prising Guernsey and the other inhabited islands, of which 
Alderney is one. For more than a century there has been 
no intercommunication of cattle from outside the islands. 
or between the two municipalities themselves. This has 
been one of the agencies in the establishment of the two 
breeds, Jersey and Guernsey, which are now and have 
been for many years sufficiently distinct so as to be readily 
recognized. Alderney is in no sense an agricultural island, 
and the few cattle on the island are kept merely as family 
cows by the inhabitants. They come, of course, from 
Guernsey, and are of that breed. There has never been a 
distinct breed known as Alderneys, and the name “‘ Alder- 
ney ”’ has been more commonly applied to Jersey than to 
Guernsey cattle. 
295. Early history. — The origin of the Jersey breed is 
conjectural, but it is probably the same as the original 
breed of Normandy. ‘The earliest writers on the cattle of 
this Island assert that they were superior to those of Nor-
-P-A-G-E-295
  
THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 257 
mandy and Brittany. Rey. Philip Falle wrote, in 1734, 
“The cattle on this Island are superior to the French.” 
Thomas Quayle, in 1812, asserted an advantage over any 
other breed in the quantity and quality of cream produced 
from the consumption of a given quantity of fodder. 
Garrard, in the first part of the last century, gave the milk 
yield as three to four gallons a day, and the butter yield 
as 220 to 230 pounds a cow a year. According to Inglis, 
the general average produced at that time was ten quarts 
of milk a day and seven pounds of butter a week. 
No distinct characteristics as to.form and color were 
given by the earliest writers, except that Colonel Le 
Couteur mentions the fact that the Jersey farmer was 
content to possess an ugly, ill-formed animal with flat 
sides, cat-hams, narrow and high hips, a hollow back, 
yet ever possessing a lively eye, round barrel, deep chest, 
short, fine, deerlike limbs and a fine tail. Nor do any 
of the writers give the reason why the Jersey was superior 
to other breeds, until the article by Colonel Le Couteur 
appeared in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural 
Society of England, in 1845. In this article Colonel 
Le Couteur says: “The Jersey cow was excellent as 
she has ever been, which has been attributed to the cir- 
cumstance of a few farmers having constantly attended 
to raising stock from cows of the best milking qualities, 
which attention, prosecuted for a long number of years 
in a small country like ours, where such superior qualities 
would soon be known, led to the excellence of milk- and 
butter-yielding qualities in the race. This never could 
have been secured so generally in Normandy, from whence 
our breed probably originated, or in any other extended 
country.” We may assume, then, that the breed owes 
its peculiar qualities to an evolution of persistent breeding 
s
-P-A-G-E-296
258 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
to perpetuate and accentuate distinctive qualities, and to 
the exclusion of all other cattle from the Island. The 
method of tethering, which has always prevailed on the 
Island, may have had its influence. 
An organized attempt was made to give a fixed beauty 
of form to the Jersey about 1835, when, says Colonel Le 
Couteur, a few gentlemen selected two beautiful cows 
with the best qualities as models. One was held to be 
perfect in her barrel and fore-quarters, the other equally 
so in her hind-quarters. From these two, a scale of points 
was laid down to be the rule for governing the judges at 
the cattle shows of the Jersey Agricultural Society. | 
At an early period, steps were taken to keep the breed 
pure by preventing outside cattle coming into the Island, 
and in 1763 an act was passed which has since been rigidly 
enforced, and supplemented by the further acts of 1789, 
1826, 1864 and 1878, prohibiting the landing of cattle on 
the Island except for the purpose of slaughter. Even 
before the enactment of laws, the purity of the cattle was 
maintained by the persistence with which the Jerseyman 
clung to his own breed. Every effort to introduce other 
cattle, even from England, has been invariably render 
futile by the inhabitants. | 
The Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural So- 
ciety, organized in}1833, has been one of the chief means | 
of improving the general character of the breed on the 
Island, and of developing its valuable dairy qualities. In 
1836, the Society recommended that one superior bull be 
kept in each parish, and that encouragement be given to 
keep first-rate heifers in the Island, as the high prices’ 
offered were strong temptations to export them. In | 
1838, it enacted at least two new rules. One was to the | 
effect that any person withholding the services of a prize.

bull from the public should forfeit the premium ; the other 
was that all heifers having premiums adjudged to them 
should be kept on the Island until they shall have dropped 
their first calf. If previously sold for exportation, they 
shall forfeit the premium. 
296. History after 1850. — In 1853, the Society began 
to recognize the fact that it was unwise to ship out of the 
Island the best cattle, and urged the breeders against 
‘selling their best stock to be taken from the Island. In 
1862, the Society reports, “'To a very considerable extent, 
the business of the society is limited to the improvement 
of our insular race of cattle, which in itself is of the highest 
importance. We, therefore, wish to impress an observa- 
tion on those who study the improvement of their stock 
— beauty of symmetry alone cannot ever be the acme of 
perfection. The latter can be obtained only when good- 
ness and beauty are equally combined.” “It is an estab- 
lished fact that the renown which the Jersey cow enjoys 
is attributable to the peculiar richness of its milk, as well 
as to its docility of temper and neatness of form. Now, 
as this richness is not so marked in some specimens as it 
is in others, it becomes advisable to make such selections 
in breeding as will ensure further amelioration in this 
most essential and highly important point.” 
Up to 1865, there appears to have been little attention 
paid to the quantity of milk which the Jersey gave. The 
quality of milk and the quantity of butter and beauty of 
form seem to have been the only points which the breeders 
had considered, up to that time. But, in that year, a 
committee of the Agricultural Society of Jersey urged 
that the Jersey breeder should pay greater attention to the 
milk-producing qualities of the cow, and that every cow 
with the least tendency to deficiency in quantity of milk '
-P-A-G-E-300
260 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK | 
should be weeded out, and suggested that the judges 
especially consider this in awarding prizes. It will be 
seen, therefore, that the Jersey has been bred for quantity 
of milk for only about forty years. It was in the seventies 
that it became the fashion, both in England and America, 
to select solid-colored Jerseys with black points, and for 
some time this color craze had a detrimental influence on 
the breed. But it appears that the Agricultural Society 
of Jersey, ever watchful of the future interests of the breed, 
condemned this color craze, and, in 1873, it reports, ‘ Let 
henceforth such fanciful ideas as black tails and black 
tongues be estimated at their proper value, but let the 
large and rich yield of milk be ever the breeder’s ambition 
to procure.” | 
The Jersey herd-book was started in 1866, and it has 
undoubtedly had a marked influence on the improvement 
of the cattle in the Island. In America or in England, an 
animal may be registered as soon as born, if its sire and 
dam are registered, or are capable of being registered. 
On the Island, however, inspection is made a conditional 
precedent to registering. The following are necessary con- 
ditions to registration : 
(1) Every animal must be inspected by competent 
judges, and, if it is considered fit, it obtains a qualifica- 
tion, namely, commended or highly commended. 
(2) Every bull submitted for qualification must be 
accompanied by his dam, in order that the merits of the 
latter may be taken into consideration in awarding a 
commendation to the former. 
(3) No heifer, althovgh she may be descended from 
registered parents, can be entered in the herd-book until 
she has had a calf, and if at the time of her examination 
she is a poor milker, she receives no commendation.  
-P-A-G-E-301
   THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 261 
It will readily be seen, therefore, that by the method 
of registration on the island of Jersey, not only the 
pedigree can be traced, but it can be ascertained whether 
the dams and sires for generations back have been 
commended or highly commended by the commissioned 
judges. These commendations are shown in pedigree 
by the letter C. if commended, and by the letters H. C. if 
highly commended. 
Jersey cattle were imported into England as early as 
1835, and in large numbers in the forties. L. W. Low, in 
1845, says, ‘The cows are imported into England in 
considerable numbers, and are esteemed beyond those of 
any other race for the richness of their milk and the deep 
yellow color of their butter.” 
297. History in America. — Importation into America 
began in 1850. In that year twelve animals were im- 
ported under the auspices of a club of farmers organized 
for the purpose. Only prize winners were purchased. 
The bull “Splendens” was in this importation, and he 
proved to be a very valuable animal. Other importations 
followed in the fifties, mostly to Connecticut, Massachu- 
setts, New Jersey and New York, and from 1860 to 1890, 
importations were numerous and to nearly every part of 
the United States. More than two thousand head a year 
were imported year after year. Again, from about 1900 
to the present time, many importations have been made. 
In fact, so numerously have Jersey cattle been imported 
and so rapidly have they increased in America, that they 
outnumber the Jerseys on the Island, and they have 
been so largely used for grading, that the Jersey char- 
acteristics are seen everywhere dairy cows are kept. 
_ 298. Description. — The ideal Jersey of to-day has a 
small head, short, broad, lean and dish-faced. The
-P-A-G-E-302
262 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
muzzle, including the under lip, is black or dark in color, 
surrounded by a light or mealy strip of light skin and hair. | 
The eyes are prominent, large, bright and wide apart. 
The horns are crumpled or incurving, small, waxy and often 
black-tipped. The ears are small, delicate and yellow- 
colored within. The neck is fine, clean and small. The 
legs are short, fine boned and small. The body is well 
hooped or rounded, large and deep. The tail is fine boned, 
long, with a full brush. The skin is mellow, loose, yellow, 
with short, fine, silky 
hair. The udder is 
large in size, extend- 
ing well up behind 
and well forward, not 
pendant. The teats 
are medium _ sized, 
placed far apart on 
th the udder, without 
Boe ere having the udder cut 
up between them. The milk veins are generally highly 
developed, tortuous, knotty, and often spreading in several 
branches. The back should be straight from shoulder to 
the setting-on of the tail. So far as beauty is concerned, 
the sloping rump is very objectionable. The general ap-_ 
pearance should be attractive and sprightly. The head 
should be erect when walking and the movements should 
be light, quick and graceful. _ When in full flow of milk, 
the Jersey should carry little flesh, but have muscular 
development enough for healthy activity and full diges- 
tive forces. (Fig. 44. Plate X.) 
299. Use for milk and butter.— For many years the 
Jersey was bred almost exclusively for its butter-produc- 
ing qualities. Many private and official butter tests have 
   
-P-A-G-E-303
   THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 263 
been published, giving phenomenal yields of butter. As 
the result of these tests, so-called families of Jerseys have 
sprung up, as the St. Lambert, the Signal, the Combina- 
tion, the Victor, the Tormentor. But a careful review 
of authenticated tests, and especially the results of the 
official tests at the World’s Columbian and at the Louisiana 
Purchase Expositions, show that the excellence is inherent 
in the breed generally, and is not confined to any partic- 
ular line or lines of breeding. Of late years, much atten- 
tion has been paid to the breeding of Jerseys for milk- 
production as well as for butter, and for beauty of form, 
with excellent results. Jerseys giving four to five gallons 
of milk a day are not rare in most herds, and such cows 
are noted for persistence in milking. Records are given 
of individual cows giving 10,000, 12,000 and even over 
18,000 pounds of milk in a year. Yields of butter-fat 
amounting to 600 pounds are common, and there are 
many records of over 900 pounds, the highest record being 
999 pounds, 2.2 ounces, in one year. 
Very interesting are the results from the dairy test at 
the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, 
and the cow-demonstration tests at the Louisiana Pur- 
chase Exposition at St. Louis, in 1904. In both instances 
the cows were selected and cared for by the American 
Jersey Cattle Club, and it may be assumed, therefore, 
that the best cows in the breed available at that time were 
selected in each case. The test was conducted in each 
instance by a committee of the Association of American 
Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations. The re- 
sults show that the Jersey cows can assimilate a large 
quantity of food, give four to five gallons of rich milk a 
day, and that they are persistent milkers; and if conclu- 
sions can be drawn from comparison of the two tests, 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
264 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
each with the same number of cows, selected in the same 
manner, and under like conditions, it is that in the eleven 
years between these tests the Jerseys had increased largely 
in flow of milk, and in the production of butter. 
The records of the Jerseys in the ninety-day test at the 
World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago, June-August 
29, 1893, give the following summary of results for the |

The cows averaged sixty-nine days in lactation at the 
time the demonstration began, so in reality at the close 
of the test, the cows, on an average, had been in milk — 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 265 
nearly six months. The Jerseys not only gave over forty 
pounds of milk per day, but the milk was the richest of 
any in butter-fat, averaging 4.7 per cent, or an average 
of more than two pounds of butter per day for each cow, 
making a total of 274 pounds in 120 days. In the two 
months in which they were milked prior to the beginning 
of the test, they should have produced about the same 
amount of butter in proportion to the time as they had 
during the test, which would give an average for each cow 
for six months of 4103 pounds of butter. When it is 
remembered that the average dairy cow gives less than 
250 pounds of butter per year, these accomplishments seem 
all the more remarkable. These results were obtained 
without withdrawing a single cow because of sickness. 
They were fed on a profitable basis, each cow earning 
over cost of feed nearly $40, or a daily profit of 43 cents. 
It is interesting to compare results during the first and 
last part of the test for the purpose of showing the per- 
sistency of production and endurance. During the first 
ten days of the test, the Jerseys gave 10,942 pounds of 
milk, or an average to a cow a day of 43.8 pounds; aver- 
age per cent of fat in the milk, 4.25; total pounds of fat, 
466, or an average to a cow a day of 1.86 pounds. During 
the last ten days they gave 9382 pounds of milk, an aver- 
age of 37.5 pounds to a cow; average per cent of fat in 
the milk, 5.13; total amount of fat, 481.1 pounds, or an 
average to a cow each day of 1.92 pounds. While the cows 
decreased in flow of milk, they increased both in percent- 
age and amount. of fat, and a general improvement in the 
productive capacity of the Jerseys is indicated by a com- 
parison of the two tests. 
Subsequent records show that the milking capacity of 
the Jersey is being developed, without detriment to the

content of Jersey milk adapts it especially'to the produc- 
tion of high-class cheese. At the World’s Columbian 
Exposition it was given first place over the Guernsey and 
the Shorthorn in a cheese-making test. The demand for 
Jersey milk for the retail trade and for butter-making 
allows but little of it to be made into cheese. 
The Jersey does not pretend to be a beef-producer. 
The meat is of good quality but is off in color. The 
Jersey dresses out too small a percentage of marketable. 
meat, compared with the beef breeds, to adapt it to the 
butcher’s block.   
   
-P-A-G-E-307
THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 267 
The Jerseys have been much used for grading on native 
cows to increase milk- and butter-production. Carefully 
selected bulls may be used for this purpose with very 
satisfactory results as the Jersey blood is very prepotent. 
301. Feeding and care. — Jerseys have a capacity for 
assimilating large quantities of food and may be forced 
to advantage when in full flow of milk, as all extra food, 
in such case, is converted into milk. When the milk-flow 
begins to slacken, the food should be reduced, especially 
the concentrates. The Jerseys are large eaters of rough- 
age and succulent feeds, as roots. 
On the Island the method of caring for the cows has 
been the same for nearly two hundred years. In the 
summer they are tethered in meadows and pastures, and 
in the winter are warmly housed at night. The same care 
should be taken in the management of Jerseys in this 
country. They should have plenty of pasture to run on 
in the summer, and they should not be confined in the 
winter in day-time except in very cold and inclement 
weather. They should be treated kindly, as they have 
ever been on the Island. Nervous cows should be excluded 
from the herd, as well as those giving small quantities of 
milk, and those not persistent in their milk. 
At one time the Jersey was supposed to be delicate, but 
the American breed of cows at this time seems to be con- 
stitutionally as strong as any other dairy breed, and not 
‘more subject to disease than other cattle, with possibly 
the exception of milk fever. But since the air treat- 
ment for this disease has been used, this heretofore dreaded 
affliction need no longer be considered a dangerous disease. 
302. Distribution. — The Jersey is very widely dis- 
tributed, due to its wide adaptation to conditions. As has 
been said, it is scattered through the United States and 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  
  268 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK ! 
Canada. England, France, New Zealand, Australia and 
many other countries can boast of large herds. 
303. Organizations and records. — The two organiza- 
tions which have done so much for the development of 
the Jersey are the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horti- 
cultural Society, organized in 1833, and the American 
Jersey Cattle Club, organized in 1868, whose offices are at 
324 West Twenty-third street, New York. In 1866, the 
first herd-book of the Island Society appeared. The 
American Jersey Cattle Club has published eighty- six 
volumes of its Herd Register, and the number of reclert 
animals is 479,000, to date (Nov. 1, 1915). 
The American Jersey Cattlé Club has done much he | 
develop and keep the blood of the Jersey pure in this coun- 
try. The Club registers only such animals in its herd 
register as can be traced directly to the island of Jersey. 
The Jersey Bulletin published at Indianapolis, Indiana, is 
devoted exclusively to the interests of the Jersey cow. 
Other organizations are the English Jersey Cattle 
Society, the New Zealand Jersey Cattle Breeders’ Asso- 
ciation, the Canadian Jersey Cattle Club, the Australasian 
Jersey Herd Society, the Japanese Jersey Cattle Club, 
and Le Syndicat des Eléveurs de la Race Jersiaise du _ 
Continent France. The former has published seventeen 
volumes of its herd-book; the latter, organized in 1903, 
has published one volume of its herd-book.

304. The Guernsey is one of the four leading breeds 
of dairy cattle. They constitute, with the Jerseys, the 
Channel Island cattle and are noted for butter-produc- 
tion. 
805. History in Guernsey. — The Guernsey breed of 
cattle originated and was developed on the island of 
Guernsey, which is one of the Channel islands. The 
foundation of the breed lay in the admixture of the large, 
red Normandy, and the little black Brittany breeds, 
which were brought from the neighboring coast of France 
to the Island. It has been generally accepted that the 
large red Normandy males predominated in crossing on 
the little black Brittany cows on Guernsey, and that the 
Guernsey takes many of its characteristics from the Nor- 
mandy breed. The fact that for nearly one hundred years 
no live cattle have been permitted to come on the Island, 
is enough to say that the breed has remained pure, and 
been bred by itself without admixture of foreign blood. 
The Royal Guernsey Agricultural and Horticultural 
Society is largely responsible for the improvement of the 
breed. 
Little more can be said of the history of the breed on 
the Island. The shrewd, careful, sturdy islander, while 
zealously guarding the purity of the breed, paid little
-P-A-G-E-310
270 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
attention to the breeding and development of his cattle. ’ 
In fact, on the Island, the glasshouse and bulb industry 
supplanted that of the cows in the islander’s mind. The 
‘cattle were never bred to the dictate of fashion, but 
developed by themselves into a hardy, sturdy breed, 
commonly spoken of as “ the old-time yellow and white 
cow — the farmer’s cow.” 
306. History in America. —In 1818, a pair of cattle 
were secured from the island of Alderney, by Reuben 
Haines, of Germantown, Pennsylvania. These may have 
been Guernseys. The first definite record of importation. 
of Guernseys into this country was about 1833, when'a sea 
captain, stopping at the Island, brought to this country a. 
pair, of young animals that were sent to his brother on 
what is known as Cow Island, in Lake Winnepesaukee, 
New Hampshire. Traces of this importation are still to 
be found in some Guernseys in that state. Guernseys 
were introduced into private dairies around Philadelphia 
as early as 1840, and are still to be found in the dairies of 
some of those families who first introduced them there. 
About 1865, a few Guernseys were brought over by the 
Fowlers, who were importing Jerseys, and in some herds 
animals can be traced to the importations of that period. 
In June, 1871, James M. Codman, now President of the 
American Guernsey Cattle Club, selected eight cows and 
a bull on the island of Guernsey, and imported them. 
These few cows made a high reputation for themselves, 
and a number of owners of gentlemen’s estates near Bashar! 
were attracted by their merits. This led the Massachu- 
setts Society for Promoting Agriculture to send, in 1874, 
one of their members to import a herd, which was main- 
tained by the Society for a short time, and then sold a: 
auction to its members. This was followed by a number    
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 271 
of Connecticut farmers joining together, and sending a 
representative to the Island to bring over a shipment. 
These importations laid the foundation of the Guernsey 
in this country, and led to the establishment of the herd 
register. ( 
The first real public introduction of the breed was in 
connection with the dairy test conducted by the New 
York and New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Stations, 
when the various breeds were tried, and the Guernsey 
made a most creditable record, the figures showing them 
to be the most economical producers of cream and butter, 
ranking the lowest in cost of food to produce a pound of 
butter-fat, and in the cost of food for maintenance for a 
year. The Guernseys and the sister Channel island breed 
(the Jersey) stood first in the annual production of butter, 
and the profit resulting from sale of cream. Their next 
appearance was at the World’s Columbian Exposition at 
Chicago, in 1893, where amidst rules and conditions which 
failed to credit the breed fully on some of its special 
characteristics, the Guernseys ranked ahead on flavor 
and had the advantage on color of butter, and, as in the 
Experiment Station trials, stood with the Jerseys in the 
front rank as butter-producers. The last public appear- 
ance of the breed was at the Pan-American Exposition at 
Buffalo, where after a careful six months’ test, the Guern- 
seys were awarded the first prize for the greatest net 
profit in the production of butter-fat, and also in the 
production of churned butter. The Guernsey cows in , 
this trial made butter at the lowest cost a pound, and re- 
turned the greatest profit in butter-production for the 
investment of feed. They also ranked in the production 
of total solids next to the heavier milking breeds. Group- 
ing the cows in this test as a whole, the Guernsey cow, 
 
-P-A-G-E-312

| 
Mary Marshall, made the greatest net profit of any cow 
in production of butter, and viewed from the same stand- 
point, we find three of the five Guernseys among the best 
five cows in the entire fifty. | 
307. Description (Figs. 45, 46).—‘“‘ We recognize that 
the Guernsey should be — 
“ (1) A dairy animal with a distinctive dairy tempera- 
ment and conformation, having a strong, nervy structure 
with a corresponding 
flow of nervous energy. 
and every indication 
of capacity and vital- 
ity. 
“(2) In color of 
hair, a shade of fawn, 
with white on limbs 
and under part of 
body, are considered 
the prevailing markings, and some degree of uniformity 
is desirable. 
(3) One of the important distinguishing features of 
the breed is the presence of a yellow color in the pigment 
of the skin, which is indicative of rich golden color in the 
milk. This is very pronounced in the Guernsey and held 
by her to the greatest extent under all conditions of sta- 
bling and feed. The intensity of this trait is more marked 
in some animals and families than in others, but it should 
be kept at the highest standard. It is fast being recog- 
nized that this color is accompanied by a superior flavor 
in the milk and thus in the butter. 
Dairy temperament.—“ By ‘dairy temperament’ is 
meant a strong, overruling predisposition or tendency to 
turn the consumption of food towards the production of 
  Fig. 45.— Guernsey bull. 
   
-P-A-G-E-313
THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 273 
milk with a high content of solids, especially butter-fat, 
as against the constitutional tendency, so often seen, to 
turn food into flesh. Even in the strongest dairy breeds 
there are more or less frequent outcrops in male and fe- 
male of the flesh-making temperament. To breed from 
such animals, while we are striving to establish a pre- 
potent dairy temperament or tendency, is not wise. All 
cattle bred specifically for dairy purposes should possess 
a clear and decided dairy temperament, for it is that 
quality of character , 
we most desire to 
establish, enlarge and 
perpetuate in the 
Guernsey cow. 
“This is especially 
indicated by the shape { 
of the head, showing 
brain capacity, wide 
muzzle, open nostril, 
full, bright eyes, fem- 
inine neck, and a construction of the backbone indicating 
a strong flow of nerve-power and support from the brain 
to all of the maternal organs. 
Constitution. — “In breeding our domestic animals, 
especially for long service like the dairy cow, it is very 
important that they should have abundant vital power, 
which we call ‘ constitution.’ But constitution must be 
judged and measured by the peculiar function the animal 
is bred to fulfill. With the race-horse the function is 
speed; with the steer, the laying on of flesh; with the 
dairy cow, the production of milk solids. In all these 
various functions, the animal that is to represent any one 
of them must show not only large capacity in the line of 
Tr 
  Fic. 46.— Guernsey cow.
-P-A-G-E-314
LUTTE Tee EN LT Pree he eT eh eT ee eT 
274 THE BREEDS OF LIV E-STOCK 
that function, but also the ability to endure long and well 
the strain of such function, and keep in good health. 
Constitution is best indicated by a full development at 
the navel, and strong abdominal walls, showing that the 
animal, when in a prenatal state, was abundantly nourished 
by the mother through a well-developed umbilical cord. 
Prepotency. — “ In the scale for bulls, for the first time 
we believe, in the history of dairy breeds, this point is 
introduced. The reason we have included it is that ‘ pre- 
potency ’ is the chief consideration in the selection of a 
male breeding animal. The pedigree and conformatio 
is often all that can be desired, but because the bull i: 
lacking in prepotent breeding power he is an expensiv 
failure. This quality is, in a sense, difficult to perceiv 
or describe, but we know certain animals have it in hig 
degree and others fail of it completely. It is fairly wel 
indicated by vigor of appearance, strong resolute bearing 
and abundant nervous energy. We would distinguish 
this from an ugly disposition. A bull is ugly by the way 
he is handled rather than by his breeding. What we want 
is strong impressive blood. A dull sluggish spirit and 
action, we consider indicative of a lack of true dairy pre- 
potency, but we would prefer to breed to a rather sluggish- 
appearing bull with first-class rudimentaries than to a 
stylish one with badly placed rudimentaries. } 
Rudimentary teats. — ‘‘ We consider that a well-balanced 
and well-shaped udder in the cow is largely due to thi 
way the rudimentary teats are placed on the sire. If they 
are crowded close together the result is likely to be narrow, 
pointed udders. If they are placed well apart, of goo 
size and well forward of the scrotum, the effect, we think 
will be to influence largely the production of wipe 
udders in the resulting heifers, and counteract the tendenc 
|
-P-A-G-E-315
  THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 275 
to ill-shaped udders inheritable from dams deficient in this 
respect. We believe the future excellence of the Guernsey 
cow will be greatly aided by close attention on the part 
of her breeders to this point.” 
The temperament of both the bulls and cows of this 
breed is very quiet and uniform. The bulls are very 
tractable and the cows have been developed and handled 
on the Island in a way that would indicate gentleness and 
quietude. 
308. Use for milk, cream and butter.— The chief 
characteristic of the Guernsey is her economical production 
of the highest natural colored milk, cream and butter. 
In this she has excelled and proved herself in all impartial 
trials. In England, and to a growing extent in this coun- 
try, there is an impression that with this natural high 
color of her products there is a special and very desirable 
flavor. While the Guernsey is preéminently a cream and 
butter breed, it has been found within the last few years 
that the color and flavor of her milk, combined with a 
good amount which she is able to produce, has placed her 
a favorite in catering to the choicest trade in the sale of 
milk and cream. To-day, in nearly all our largest towns 
and cities, this trade will be found supplied with the 
products of full-blood and grade Guernseys. 
This characteristic has appealed to two classes of 
dairymen— the progressive ones who are producing 
strictly high-class dairy products for a critical trade, 
from which the highest returns are secured, and those 
who desire the best flavored and colored milk, cream and 
butter for use on their private estate. To the former, the 
fact that in impartial trials the Guernsey has shown greater 
returns for a dollar invested in food when cream or butter, 
and even high-grade milk, is produced, is sufficient to win 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
    276 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
for her a good trial. Wherever her golden-colored products 
are shown they are sure to win recognition. Numerous 
instances can be cited in which the products of herds of 
Guernseys are supplying such markets. A good grade 
Guernsey cow is eagerly sought in the higher-class dairies. 
The American Guernsey Cattle Club was the first to 
establish an Advanced Register on a yearly basis. This 
was done in 1901, and since this date 4351 cows and young 
heifers have entered with an official test averaging 8779.91 
pounds of milk and 437.20 pounds of butter-fat and an 
average percentage of 4.979. The improvement which is 
steadily being made in the breed as shown by the average 
annual increase in average fat production is seven pounds 
per year for the last four years. During the time since 
the establishment of the Advanced Register the world’s 
record for the production of butter-fat has been held by 
three different Guernsey cows, the first being made in 
1905 when one cow produced 14,920.8 pounds of milk and 
857.15 pounds of butter-fat. Another cow later produced 
19,673.00 pounds of milk and 1073.41 pounds of butter-fat, 
and still another 24,008.00 pounds of milk and 1098.18 
pounds of butter-fat. 
309. Other uses of Guernseys. — The composition of 
Guernsey milk adapts it for the preparation of high-grade 
cheese, but because of the demand for the milk, cream and 
butter, it is not used largely for cheese-making. 
While a distinctively dairy breed, the size of the Guern- 
sey allows her easily to be converted as a young animal, 
or when past her usefulness as a milker, into beef. There 
are few prettier sights than those seen in the meat divi- - 
sion of the great market of St. Petersport on the island of 
Guernsey, and this testifies what can be done with the 
breed in this respect.     
 
-P-A-G-E-317
THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 217 
The prepotency of the Guernsey bull, or his ability to 
stamp the desirable characteristics of the breed on his off- 
spring, makes him most valuable for improving the com- 
mon dairy stock of any section. If he is employed intel- 
ligently, he will get grade cows yielding rich milk, and 
possessing good constitution and productivity. 
310. Distribution. — The even temperament of Guern- 
sey cattle has been very conducive to the adaptability of 
the breed to the various climates and conditions of the 
world at large. They are found mainly on Guernsey 
island, in England, Canada and the United States. The 
only hindrance to their widespread introduction has been 
the fact that for the last few years there have not been 
enough animals to supply the demand. 
Since the public has learned to appreciate the discrimi- 
nating qualities of milk, cream and butter, the Guernsey 
cow has been in great demand. Her distribution within 
the last few years has made material gains. The transfer 
of ownership recorded in the herd register shows that the 
breed has now an excellent footing in all the prominent 
dairy sections, and every indication points that the de- 
mand for both pure breds and high-grade Guernseys has 
increased materially in the last few years. 
311. Organizations and records. — The Royal Guern- 
sey Agricultural and Horticultural Society directs the 
interests of the breed on Guernsey island. It maintains 
a herd-book for general registration. In 1885, the Eng- 
lish Guernsey Cattle Society was organized. It issues a 
herd-book. The American Guernsey Cattle Club was 
organized in 1877. It has published twenty-nine volumes 
of the herd register, and there were recorded in May, 1915, 
32,320 males and 55,640 females. Over 11,114 entries 
were made in 1914. Since 1910 an official breed organ 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
278 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
known as Guernsey Breeders’ Journal has been published, 
and a department of the herd register is maintained as an 
Advanced Register. At the present time there are 497 
active members of the American Guernsey Cattle Club 
and some 3400 breeders of Guernseys. The headquarters 
of the club are at Peterboro, New Hampshire.

312. The Holstein-Friesian breed of cattle is the Ameri- 
can representative of the great lowland race of cattle 
found on the rich alluvial land in Europe, bordering the 
eastern shores of the North sea. It is a‘ dairy breed, 
exclusively, in this country. 
313. History in Europe. — The Holstein-Friesian cattle — 
originated with the ancient Friesland people, a tribe 
which, at the time of our earliest historical knowledge of 
it, occupied the shores of the North sea, between the river 
Ems and the Rhine. The Friesians were the oldest in-— 
habitants of Holland, and were known as herdsmen, 
hunters and fishermen. Their history dates as far back — 
as three hundred years before Christ. The Batavians 
came two hundred years later. They were likewise herds- 
men, but occupied. themselves more particularly with 
hunting and fishing. Tacitus says of the Friesians and 
Batavians: ‘“ They owned cattle, not excelling in beauty, 
but in number.” ‘The present farmers of North Holland 
   
-P-A-G-E-319
   THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 279 
and Friesland are lineal descendants of these ancient 
people, and the multitude of black and white cattle 
which they own are lineal descendants of the cattle owned 
by their ancestors. In North Holland at the present time 
there are some 80,000 head of pure-bred cattle of this 
breed, and in Friesland at least 125,000. They are found 
in other provinces of Netherlands to a limited extent. 
The lowland race of which this breed is the leading 
representative has been the prolific mother of other breeds 
in Europe. From it have sprung the East Friesian and 
Oldenberg breeds of Germany, the Jutland breed of Den- 
mark, the Kolmogorian breed of Russia, and the Fla- 
mande or Flemish breed of Belgium and northern France. 
These approach each other in color, but differ in other 
important characteristics. They have been produced 
largely by the effect of different environments, and are 
maintained in their purity, in the different localities, by 
well-established herd-books. According to the naturalist, 
Low, also, before the development of English dairy breeds 
Friesian cattle were imported into that country, and 
established especially in the district of Holderness on the 
north side of the Humber, whence they extended north- 
ward through the plains of Yorkshire. It is asserted that 
from the mixture of this Friesian breed with the native 
cattle finally sprang the improved Shorthorn. Friesian 
cattle were also made the basis of the composite Rosen- 
stein breed, which was so greatly admired by Klippart, 
and described by him in his report to the Board of Agri- 
culture of Ohio in 1865. 
314. History in America. — It is probable that cattle of 
this breed were brought to America by the early Dutch 
settlers and that a few were imported late in the eighteenth 
and early in the nineteenth centuries. The Holland
-P-A-G-E-320
280 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Land Company is reported as having sent a few animals 
to Cazenovia, New York, in 1795. William Jarvis im- 
ported a bull and two cows in 1810, for his farm at 
Weathersfield, Vermont. Another importation into New 
York State was made in 1825. The first importer, how- 
ever, to establish and maintain a pure-bred herd, was 
Winthrop W. -Chenery, of Belmont, Massachusetts. He 
made importations in the years 1852-7-9, and 1861. 
Until 1871, these cattle were almost universally known in 
this country as Dutch, although as early as 1864 the 
United States Department of Agriculture had recognized 
them as Holstein cattle. In that year (1871), the Asso- 
ciation of Breeders of Thoroughbred Holstein Cattle was 
organized with Mr. Chenery at its head. This gross error 
in the renaming of a well-known breed was regarded by 
the Dutch breeders as a great injustice to them. They 
protested vigorously, and finally, unable to secure justice 
directly, in 1873, assisted Thomas E. Whiting, of Massa- 
chusetts, to select and purchase a herd of their cattle, 
pledging him to establish in America a herd-book which 
should maintain the correct name of the breed. This herd 
finally came into the hands of the Unadilla Valley Breeders’ 
Association, who, with other owners, organized in 1879 
the Dutch-Friesian Cattle Breeders’ Association of 
America. A sharp controversy ensued, which was finally 
brought to a close in 1885, through the union of the con- 
tending bodies in the present Holstein-Friesian Associa- 
tion of America. 
The significant history of this breed in America centers 
almost entirely about the establishment and maintenance 
of a system of advanced registration. The advanced 
registry system was-.originated by Solomon Hoxie, while 
secretary of the Dutch-Friesian Association. The neces-
-P-A-G-E-321
   THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 281 
sity for it was suggested to him by the fact that many 
cattle of doubtful merit and unknown breeding were being 
entered in the Holstein herd-book. There was need of 
recognized intrinsic standards of merit to serve as guides 
in breeding and selection. Accordingly, he induced the 
Dutch-Friesian Association to maintain an Advanced Regis- 
ter, in which cattle should be entered only in case of special 
merit, determined for bulls by means of an official scale 
of points, and in the case of cows by an additional scale of 
productiveness. While there was much early opposition 
to the Advanced Register, it has abundantly demonstrated 
its value. Since about 1894, it has been recognized as 
the chief means for the advancement of the interests of 
the Association and of its members, and its essential prin- 
ciples have been adopted by other breeders’ organizations 
both in America and Europe. It is to be regretted that 
descriptions and measurements in the practical operation 
of the system have been abandoned. It is also unfor- 
tunate that the Association, while admitting cows to the 
advanced registry only on the basis of the yield of butter- 
fat, tacitly sanctions the use of too low a factor for the 
conversion of butter-fat into butter records. The factor 
80 per cent, generally used, cannot be too severely con- 
demned, since repeated demonstrations show that good 
marketable butter requires the presence in the milk of at 
least 85.7 per cent of its weight of butter-fat. , 
315. Description. —In color, the Holstein\Friesian is 
invariably black and white. It is specially eae 
by great constitutional vigor, flexibility, thrift and enor- 
mous production of milk of comparatively low percentage 
of butter-fat. At the present time, 1915, as a result of 
mutation, many cows are producing milk through whole 
lactation periods in quality exceeding 3.75 per cent fat and
-P-A-G-E-322
282 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
some are making annual records of 4, 4.50, and even as 
high as 5 per cent fat. 
The ideal type of this breed, which has become constant 
in North Holland and Friesland, js designated as “ milk 
and beef form.” This 
form involves great 
breadth and_ length 
of rump; superior 
width of hips, with 
loin slightly rounded ; 
well-sprung ribs; 
rounded body, with 
the abdomen well held 
up; a straight chine; 
shoulders slightly 
lower than hips and 
rounded at tops, from 
whence the neck starts out level, or nearly so, and is 
carried symmetrically to a finely formed throat and rather 
long head, bearing a 
broad muzzle. It also 
involves comparative 
fineness of limbs, and 
quarters broad at sides 
and rear without puffi- 
ness ; a capacious udder 
of considerable depth, 
carried well forward in 
front and well up in 
rear, and a large development of mammary veins. An 
animal of this form will appear slightly wedge-shaped, 
viewed both from front and side (Figs. 47,48. Plate XI). 
This ideal type, however, varies with respect to locality

and breeding purpose. It “ is identified,” says Professor 
Hengerveld, “ with their use, lodging, feeding and manage- 
ment.”’ The tendency of breeding, in the United States, 
is altogether in the direction of milk form. 
The heifers mature rapidly, and, if well fed, are ready to 
breed at twelve to fifteen months of age. As a rule, they: 
deliver their calves without difficulty and may be relied 
on to enter the dairy herd, productively, when two years 
old. 
316. Use for milk. — Freshening between two and three 
years old the heifers produce with first calf about three- 
fifths to three-fourths the quantity of milk produced by 
mature animals of the breed, and if liberally supplied with 
suitable food will produce 8000 to 10,000 pounds of milk 
in one year. They will continue their growth and increase 
in productiveness until four and one-half or five years old, 
at which age they will reach, if in good milking condition, 
an average weight of 1300 pounds. From this time 
forward average cows of the breed will produce when in 
full flow of milk fifty to seventy pounds of milk daily or 
12,000 to 14,000 pounds of milk a year until eleven or 
twelve years of age. Tests of over two thousand ani- 
mals of all ages for a lactation period not exceeding 365 
days show that the average per cent of fat is between 3.3 
and 3.5 and that the total solids average 12 per cent. In 
Holstein-Friesian milk the solids not fat, to the fat, aver- 
age one to two and one-half. That is, in average Holstein- 
Friesian milk for every pound of fat will be found not less 
than two and one-half pounds of solids not fat. 
To the close of the fiscal year 1914-15 on April 30, 
1915, 1992 Holstein-Friesian cows and heifers had com- 
pleted tests covering a lactation period of not exceeding 
365 days as follows: 707 full-aged cows averaged: milk, 
 
-P-A-G-E-324

16,248.5 pounds; per cent fat, 3.41; fat, 554.78 pounds. — 
One hundred and thirty-nine senior four-year-olds aver- 
aged: milk, 15,167.6 pounds; per cent fat, 3.39; fat, 
513.56 pounds. One hundred and sixty-three junior four- 
year-olds averaged: 14,479.2 pounds milk; per cent fat, 
3.44; fat, 498.12 pounds. One hundred and seventy-five 
senior three-year-olds averaged: milk, 13,841.9; per cent 
fat, 3.41; fat, 471.77 pounds. One hundred and seventy- 
six junior three-year averaged: milk, 13,445.8 pounds; 
per cent, 3.46; fat, 465.43. Two hundred and four senior 
two-year-olds averaged: milk, 13,029.6 pounds; per cent 
fat, 3.49; fat, 454.23 pounds. Four hundred and twenty- 
eight junior two-year-olds averaged: milk, 12,167.4 
pounds; per cent fat, 3.43; fat, 417.79 pounds. This 
herd of 1992 produced 28,610,589.6 pounds milk contain- 
ing 980,755.54 pounds of butter-fat, thus showing an 
average of 3.43 per cent fat. The average for each animal 
was 14,362.7 pounds milk containing 492.34 pounds of 
butter-fat, and showing an average of 3.43 per cent fat. 
_ Thirty-four Holstein-Friesian cows and heifers have 
produced within a period of not exceeding 365 days in 
excess of 850 pounds fat, which is several times the num- 
ber of cows of all other breeds combined that have pro- 
duced in excess of that amount of fat. The first and second 
places in butter-fat production among cows of all breeds 
is now held by Holstein-Friesian cows; Finderne Pride 
Johanna Rue having produced 1176.47 pounds fat from 
28,403.7 pounds milk, and Finderne Holingen Fayne 
having produced 1116.05 pounds fat from 24,612.8 pounds 
milk. The California cow Tilly Alcartra has exceeded 
all other cows in milk production, having produced in 
365 days 30,451.4 pounds milk containing 951.23 pounds. 
Dozens of other Holstein-Friesian cows have produced
-P-A-G-E-325
THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 285 
very large amounts of milk running between 24,000 and 
29,000 pounds in 365 consecutive days. These records 
illustrate the highest attainments of the breed thus far 
in the matter of milk- and butter-fat production. For 
such production, the cow, of course, must receive special 
care and food, and must be milked three or four times a 
day. 
The milk of this breed has several peculiar and notable 
characteristics. It is not highly colored. “The absence 
of granules, as a predominant feature, makes the skimmed 
milk especially appear blue.” The fat globules are com- 
paratively small and uniform in size. The cream, there- 
fore, rises slowly, but it is dense in consequence of the 
compactness of the globules. The milk is richer than the 
color or thickness of the cream would indicate. After 
the cream rises to the surface it is easily re-incorporated 
in the milk by stirring or shaking. This renders the milk 
more than ordinarily valuable for direct consumption 
purposes, especially for city supply, since it insures to all 
consumers a comparatively uniform quality. Moreover, 
both the milk and the cream approach the structure of the 
corresponding human products more closely than those 
of any other breed which has been tested in this respect. 
This leads to the inference that the milk of this breed is 
superior to that of any other for the feeding of young 
children. Recent experiments made at the Storrs’ Agri- 
cultural Experiment Station in Connecticut tend to sub- 
stantiate this inference. 
317. Use for butter. — Butter-fat records of the breed 
have been no less remarkable. (See above.) In 1894, 
state agricultural experiment stations began the official 
supervision of the testing of Holstein-Friesian cows at the 
homes of the owners. Thousands of such tests for a  
-P-A-G-E-326
: 286 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
period of seven consecutive days have now been made. 
These tests are annually classified according to the age of 
the cows at date of calving. A summary of such records 
for a single year will serve to show the butter-making 
possibilities of the élite of the breed. During the fiscal 
year 1914-15, 3115 full-aged cows averaged: milk, 475.8 
pounds; butter-fat, 16,947 pounds. Six hundred and 
sixty-one senior four-year-olds averaged: milk, 453.6 
pounds; butter-fat, 16.405 pounds. Nine hundred and 
. twenty-eight junior four-year-olds averaged: milk, 444 
pounds; butter-fat, 16.076 pounds. Nine hundred and 
fifty-five senior three-year-olds averaged: milk, 419.4 
pounds; butter-fat, 14.865 pounds. One thousand two 
hundred and three junior three-year-olds averaged: milk, 
398.7 pounds; butter-fat, 14.194 pounds. One thousand 
one hundred and two senior two-year-olds averaged: milk, 
360.1 pounds; butter-fat, 12.603 pounds. Two thousand 
seven hundred and seventy-nine junior two-year-olds 
averaged: milk, 324.1 pounds; butter-fat, 11.434 pounds. 
Two thousand six hundred and twenty-five cows of the 
breed have official records greater than 20 pounds of 
butter-fat in seven days, and one thousand and eighty- 
four cows of the breed have official records greater than 
80 pounds of butter-fat in thirty days. Such records are 
usually made at ten to fifty days after parturition. A 
lapse of at least five days is required. There can be no 
doubt as to the correctness of these records. In many 
cases, especially when the yield was exceptionally large, 
the cows were re-tested for periods ranging from twenty- 
four to forty-eight hours by representatives of the experi- 
ment stations, who kept constant watch in order that no 
milk or cream should be introduced into the udders sur- 
reptitiously. 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 287 
It is not maintained, of course, that the average pure- 
bred Holstein-Friesian cow or heifer could produce equal 
records. Probably the best one-third of all those owned 
in this country could do so if sufficiently well fed, skill- 
fully cared for and milked three times a day. It is prob- 
able that in butter- as well as in milk-production, the 
average cow of this breed would excel the average cow 
of any other known breed. 
Butter made from the milk of these cows is compara- 
tively mild in flavor and, if not artificially colored, is of a 
pale straw-color in summer, when the cows are fed on 
grass, and of a creamy white in winter when they are fed 
on hay. In keeping quality it ranks very high. The 
butter of Friesland has long been recognized as a standard 
product in the markets of Europe, and the butter of cows 
of this breed is steadily gaining favor in our own markets. 
318. Other uses of Holstein-Friesian cattle. — The 
milk of Holstein-Friesian cattle makes a very high grade 
of cheese, and it has been much used for this purpose both 
in Holland and in America. The milk is rich in solids 
other than fat. 
This breed combines with its great milk- and butter- 
producing capacity, valuable veal qualities. Its calves 
are very large and vigorous at birth, grow rapidly and are 
exceptionally free from disease, — especially from that 
which is known as white scours. When vealed at the end 
of four or five weeks they dress 90 to 120 pounds. The 
veal is of superior color, sweetness and tenderness. 
For crossing on grade cows to increase milk-production 
the pure-bred bulls of this breed give very satisfactory 
results. 
319. Feeding and care. — The extraordinary vigor of 
cattle of this-breed permits very wide latitude in caring 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
288 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
for and feeding them. In some sections of Holland “ they 
are found on lands covered with water plants and grass of 
small nutritive value.” In northern Russia they are 
successfully kept in the frigid climate near the Arctic 
circle. The only hard-and-fast rule for feeding is: 
“ Feed abundantly well-balanced rations.”” The breeders 
in Holland and Friesland confine their cattle in their 
stables constantly from the middle of November through 
the winter till the middle of May, apparently without 
injury to them, at much less expense of food and with 
greater production of milk than results from the practice 
of daily exposure to the outside atmosphere, as in 
America. Their method requires, however, much greater 
air space per animal, and hence that they be confined in 
much larger buildings. 
320. Distribution. —- This race of cattle is widely dis- 
tributed on the continent of Europe, prevailing especially 
in northern France and along the shores of the English 
Channel and the North sea, as far as Denmark. It is the 
leading dairy breed in Russia, occupying the shores of 
the River Dwina and the White sea nearly to the Arctic 
circle. It is firmly established in nearly every province 
of Germany, in Italy, Sweden and Denmark. It is also 
bred in South Africa, and is being introduced into Japan 
and China. Introduced into the United States less than 
sixty years ago, it has spread to every important dairy 
section of this country and to Canada, and more recently 
to Mexico. It is especially adapted to rich, level grass- 
lands and to densely populated, highly civilized countries 
in which milk and its every product, and veal of superior 
quality, are in demand. 
321. Organizations and records. — Organizations for 
the promotion of the interests of this breed were closely
-P-A-G-E-329
THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 289 
associated with the history of the breed in America (which 
see, page 279). Itisa singular fact that while the thoughts 
and energies of so many generations were devoted to breed- 
ing and improving these cattle, the first public herd-book 
of the breed was published in 1872 by an American, Win- 
throp W. Chenery, of -Belmont, . Massachusetts, by 
authority of the Association of Breeders of Thoroughbred 
Holstein Cattle. It was knownas the Holstein Herd-book. 
Three years later a herd-book was issued in the Nether- 
lands, by the Netherland Herd-book Association. It was 
a protest against naming Holland cattle from a German 
province that had no valid claim to the origin of the breed. 
In 1879, the Dutch-Friesian Cattle Breeders’ Association 
was formed in America. In the same year the Friesian 
Herd-book Association was organized in the province of 
Friesland. A few years later the North Holland Herd- 
book Association was organized and a branch was estab- 
lished in America. The present Holstein-Friesian Asso- 
ciation of America was formed in 1885 by the union of 
the Holstein and the Dutch-Friesian Associations. It 
limited importations to a great extent, and in consequence 
of this the Netherland and North Holland Associations 
became nearly moribund. Recently, the former has 
adopted a system similar to the American system of ad- 
vanced registration, and probably may become an insti- 
tution of great value to breeders in all the provinces of 
Holland, with the exception of Friesland, where the early 
association was of a similar character. The Western 
Holstein-Friesian Association was organized in 1892, and 
published its first and only herd-book in 1895, containing 
pedigrees of 2100 cattle. It was united with the Holstein- 
Friesian Association of America in 1898, and its pedigree 
records became a part of the herd-book of the older asso-

ciation. The Holstein-Friesian Association of Canada 
was founded in 1891. 
The Holstein-Friesian Association of America was in- 
corporated for the purpose of importing, breeding, improv- 
ing and otherwise handling pure-bred Holstein-Friesian 
cattle, and for gathering and publishing information in 
regard to them. It maintains a herd-book and advanced 
register of cattle. The entries to its herd-book have 
reached over 152,000 bulls, and 273,000 females. The 
policy of this association has been to maintain the purity 
of the breed in America, to improve the type by selection 
of the most superior animals for separate ‘or advanced 
registration, and to demonstrate the merits of the breed 
through the making of great milk and butter records. It 
has maintained a consistent advocacy of tests at the 
homes of owners under the strictest supervision of agricul- 
tural experiment stations. In this respect it took the 
initiative, and has compelled other breeders’ associations 
to follow.

By Harry Hayward 
322. The Ayrshire is one of the four principal breeds of 
dairy cattle in America. Their popularity is more 
recent than that of the three other breeds, but they 
are making rapid gains in favor. 
323. History in Scotland. — The Ayrshire did not have 
its origin in this country, but was brought from Scotland, 
its native home, in the early part of the last century. It 
takes its name from the county Ayr, although in its for- 
mative period it was known as the Dunlop and the Cun- 
ningham breed. 
From the descriptions of Ayr and the adjacent territory, 
given by Low, an English writer on agricultural matters, 
_ it may be inferred that agricultural conditions in that 
country, at the close of the Revolutionary War, were at 
alow ebb. “There were no fallows, no sown grasses, no 
carts nor wagons and no straw yards; no roots were 
grown, very little straw and no hay, save the small amounts 
cut from the bogs and wastes. Under these conditions 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
292 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
the cattle were starved in winter, being scarcely able to 
rise in the spring, and never were in condition fit for the 
market.” Such were the conditions from which the hardy, 
useful race of Ayrshire cattle has come. Culley, who 
wrote a treatise on live-stock before the year 1790, does 
not mention the Ayrshire as one of the recognized breeds 
of the country. From this we may conclude that their 
history as a breed begins some time shortly after the first 
of the past century; previous to that time, they were one 
of the coarse varieties of cattle which formerly occupied 
all of the southern part of the country. 
The earliest recognition which they received as a breed 
was given by a Mr. Aiton, who published a treatise on the 
Dairy Husbandry of Ayrshire, in 1825. He describes 
them, according to Low, as being a puny, unshapely race, 
not superior to the cattle of the higher districts, referring, 
perhaps, to the West Highland or Kyloe cattle. He 
further states that the Ayrshires, at that time, were mostly 
‘black in color, marked with white in the face, down the 
back and flank, and that few of the cows gave more than 
a gallon and a half or two gallons of milk per day when 
fresh. They were very small in size, so small that the 
average dressed: weight of mature animals was but two 
hundred and eighty pounds. 
This description was written, it is asserted, after the in- 
troduction into the Ayrshire district of the cattle descended 
from the crosses made with the Teeswater or Holderness 
stock from Durham, England. The Earl of Marchmont 
is supposed to have brought this foreign blood into Scot- 
land between 1724 and 1740. This importation of a bull 
and several cows was taken to the earl’s estates in Ber- 
wickshire on the east coast of Scotland. 
It has been thought that the Alderney (presumably,
-P-A-G-E-333

THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 293 
    
                                                             Jersey) cross was also introduced into the Ayrshire district 
at this time. An evidence that the Jersey was used is 
the small head and slender neck possessed in common by 
both these breeds. In spite of the lack of historical evi- 
dence that Jersey cattle were crossed on the old Ayrshire 
stock, Low concludes that the “ Dairy Breed of Ayrshires 
owes the characteristics which distinguish it from the 
older race to mixture with the blood races of the continent 
and of the Dairy Breeds of Alderney.” 
From the above, we may rightly infer that the condi- 
tions which surrounded the foundation of the Ayrshire 
breed were such that the fittest only could survive. 
This factor of hardiness was apparently but little dis- 
turbed, if any, when the Teeswater cross was made. 
Hardihood has been so closely interwoven with every 
fiber of the Ayrshires that they are to-day the most hardy 
of all breeds of dairy cattle, with the possible exception 
of the Irish Kerry. It is probable that the Teeswater 
cross eventually increased the milk-producing ability of 
the Ayrshire. 
What is true of many of our improved breeds of cattle 
is true, also, of the Ayrshire: that no one breeder stands 
out prominently from his fellows as the great improver 
of the breed. The dairy-farmers of Ayr and the adjacent 
counties worked together for the common purpose of 
developing a hardy, active race of cattle adapted to the 
humid climate and sparse hillside pastures, as well asa 
race that would produce the maximum amount of milk 
when fed on chaffed straw and roots during the long winters 
of Scotland. Their success is indicated by the very large 
number of exportations from Scotland to other countries. 
324. History in America. — Ayrshire cattle were first 
imported into America between 1820 and 1830. Importa-
-P-A-G-E-334
(294 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
tions continued to be made into the eastern states with 
more or less regularity up to about the beginning of the 
Civil War. Importations are thought to have been made 
in 1822 by H. W. Hills, of Windsor, Connecticut ; about 
‘1837 by John P. Cushing, of Massachusetts, and in 1848 
by E. A. Brown, of Ohio. While the imported cattle 
gave their owners entire satisfaction as far as hardiness, 
ease of keeping and milk-production were concerned, they 
failed to find much favor where the milking is done by 
men, because of the shortness of their teats. In Canada 
and in Scotland, where women milk by stripping with the 
‘thumb and forefinger, this fault was not the serious objec- 
tion that it was in eastern United States. It is possible, 
too, that another reason why the Ayrshire did not, grow in 
favor more rapidly was that the center of the breed, in 
its early history in the United States, was in New England, 
and in the hands of dairy-farmers. The cattle were kept 
for practical purposes, and but little attention was paid 
to breed characteristics, to exhibiting at the fairs, or to 
advertising the merits of the breed in any other way. 
325. Description.— The individual Ayrshire (Plate 
XI) is an animal of medium size, the standard weight 
for mature cows being one thousand pounds, while bulls 
sbould weigh fifteen hundred pounds or more (Figs. 
49, 50). In general conformation it is, perhaps, a little 
smoother than the Jersey and Holstein, yet it is not so 
smooth as to conceal the wedge shape of the body when 
viewed from behind. A little peculiarity frequently seen 
in the Ayrshire is that the tips of the ears are frequently 
notched. The horns are white, with black tips, and 
curve outward and upward. They may attain large size. 
The body is large and deep and the ribs well sprung; the» 
rump is broad and long, and is usually set high. The, —

This character is rather

326. Types of Ayrshire cattle. —The event which 
served to bring the Ayrshires from their obscurity in 
America, and but for 
which they might still 
have been compara- 
vA) tively unknown, was 
the World’s Columbian 
Exposition, held in 
Chicago in 1893. At 
this great World’s Fair 
two distinct types of 
Ayrshire cattle ap- 
peared in competition: 
; the American or New 
England type, which, having received no fresh infusion of

Canadian or, more properly, the Scotch type. This type 
was represented solely by animals that conformed to the 
type generally held by every one but American breeders 
to be the correct one, and many individuals had been 
prize-winners at the important agricultural shows in 
Scotland. 
The New England cattle differed from those of Scotch 
type in that they were a little shorter in the leg, heavier © 
bodied, and possessed better handling qualities. Their 
udders, while large and capaeious, were hardly level and 
square, and in many cases were rather pendulous. « The 
teats were of good size and length, and of a dark or tan 
color; the horns frequently were crumpled, and the colors 
were dark-brown or cherry-red, flecked with white. While 
these cattle possessed unquestioned dairy merits, they did 
not have the uniformity of type that should be charac- 
teristic of a recognized breed. 
The Scotch cattle were longer and not relatively so deep 
in the body as their competitors; a trifle longer in the 
leg; hardly ‘so rugged, perhaps; straighter from the 
poll to tail-head ; possessed of large, square, level udders, 
whose front quarters were particularly well-developed, 
closely attached to the body, with teats ideally placed, 
but too often not only small in size but very short in 
length. It is stated by some authorities that a closely 
attached udder is very rarely found with ldng teats. 
Other characteristics of these Scotch Ayrshires were their 
heavy skins, broad upward-turned horns, and their color, 
which was white, with varying shades of red spots on 
the head and neck; frequently there were larger or 
smaller spots on the body, but, in most cases, at least, the 
white predominated. Furthermore, all of the cattle ex- 
hibited by the Canadians showed a uniformity of breed
-P-A-G-E-337
  THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 297 
character or type that was very plainly manifest to the 
most casual observer. It was this uniformity, as well as 
their distinctive showy attractiveness, that drew to the 
foreign cattle the attention of the visitors in the stadium, 
as well as that of the American breeders in and outside 
of the judging arena. 
The, judge on this occasion had been selected from 
Canada, and, naturally, was partial to the Scotch type. 
As a consequence, most of the prizes went to the Canadian 
exhibitors. While the American exhibitors were bitterly 
disappointed, the decisions made at Chicago have had a 
far-reaching effect in changing the type of Ayrshire cattle 
in America. Since that time the majority of the most 
progressive breeders either have made direct importations 
* from Scotland, or have placed at the head of their herds 
bulls of the Scotch type. This is particularly true of those 
who exhibit at the leading fairs. And, when competition 
comes between this and the old New England type, the 
‘\ former nearly always wins. 
~- The question of type had become so confusing that 
early in the year 1906 the officials of the American, 
Canadian and Scotch Ayrshire breeders’ associations 
recognized it as worthy of their attention. The result 
was that they agreed on a uniform scale of points, which 
was intended to serve as a guide for the breeders of all 
three associations. 
Breeders of these cattle have never practiced inbreed- 
ing to any great extent, and there are few well-defined 
families or strains, as in other breeds. 
327. Uses for milk and butter. — In point of milk-yield 
alone, the Ayrshire does not compare favorably, individual 
for individual, with the Holstein, nor in butter-production 
alone with either the Jersey or Guernsey. But in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
298 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
yield of milk and butter, on rough, hilly pastures, or with- 
out heavy grain-feeding in the winter, the Ayrshire is in a 
class by herself. It is difficult to give figures of produc- 
tion that are at all representative, since as much, if not 
more, depends on the system of care and management as 
on the cow herself. From reports of a number of herds 
which may be considered reliable, as indicating the dairy 
qualities of the Ayrshire breed, it may be stated that 
herds numbering twenty animals, of all ages, will yield, as 
an average, 6500 pounds of milk and 300 pounds of 
butter-fat. This estimate presupposes that the herd is fed 
for profit, but not forced in any sense of the word. A 
number of herds fed a liberal allowance of grain the year 
round, and managed with the view of yielding the maxi- 
mum amount of milk and butter, have averaged over 8000 
pounds of milk and 350 pounds of butter-fat. Because 
the Ayrshire cow is perhaps not capable of making forced 
weekly, or even yearly, milk and butter records equal to 
those of some of the other breeds, and furthermore, be- 
cause she has been so completely in the hands of practical 
dairymen, she has never been forced in her production in 
the generally accepted sense of the term. As a conse- 
quence, the cows of this breed are in a more normal con- 
dition than those of almost any other. 
Because the butter-fat globules are small, the cream does 
not rise so quickly as in the case of some of the other dairy 
breeds, and as a consequence Ayrshire milk is well adapted 
for shipping to city markets, and for use as a beverage. 
328. Other uses of Ayrshires.—It was formerly 
thought that Ayrshire milk was peculiarly adapted to 
cheese-making. With our present-day information on 
this subject, however, this view is no longer generally held, 
although the milk is used for this purpose.
-P-A-G-E-339
   THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 299 
As far as a dairy cow can be a beef animal, the Ayrshire 
probably excels, for the reason that she is a little smoother 
in conformation than the other dairy breeds, and the fat 
of the carcass, instead of being yellow, which is objection- 
able to the consumer, is white. : 
An Ayrshire bull at the head of a grade herd will greatly 
increase milk-production in its progeny. When used oa 
grade cows the standard of the herd will be materially 
elevated. 
329. Distribution. — The Ayrshires are practically the 
only dairy cattle in Scotland, and nearly every country in 
which dairying is an important industry has drawn heavily 
on Scotland for foundation stock. /The principal coun- 
tries that are using Ayrshires are Canada, the United 
States, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. They are 
also found in considerable numbers in South Africa, New 
Zealand, Australia, China and.Japan. In America, the 
breed is found in largest numbers in Quebec and Ontario, 
in Canada, but it is fast becoming popular in eastern 
United States, notably in the New England States, New 
York and Pennsylvania. There are a few herds in Ohio, 
Illinois, Missouri, Oregon and California. 
330. Organizations and records. — The welfare and 
interests of this race of cattle are in charge of the American 
Ayrshire Breeders’ Association, which was organized on 
its present basis in 1875. The breeders of Ayrshires, how- 
ever, have done systematic work for the breed through 
the Association of Breeders of Thoroughbred Neat Stock, 
as far back as 1859. The latter organization published 
three volumes of a herd register. On the organization of 
the former association, the publication of the Ayrshire 
Records came into its hands. Since 1876 it has published 
twenty-seven volumes (new series recording over 17,000 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
800 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
bulls and 39,000 cows). The North American Ayrshire 
Register first appeared in 1875, devoted to cattle that 
could be traced to importation. It was discontinued in 
1880, after four volumes had been published. Aside from 
guarding the purity of the breed, the American Ayrshire 
Breeders’ Association also conducts a yearly home dairy 
test and an advanced registry. Both of these divisions 
of the Association’s work tend to encourage the develop- 
ment of the breed by creating a greater interest among 
the members of the Association, to excel either in making 
official records, or in making attractive displays of their 
cattle at leading agricultural exhibitions. The present 
headquarters of the Association are at Brandon, Vermont. 
There was organized in 1870 the Ayrshire Importers’ 
and Breeders’ Association of Canada, and in 1889 the 
Dominion Ayrshire Breeders’ Association. In 1898, the 
former was absorbed by the latter. The Montreal Ayr- 
shire Herd-book first appeared in 1886. It was later 
united with the Dominion Ayrshire Herd-book, which 
appeared in 1884, and published as the Canadian Ayrshire 
Record.

331. The Brown Swiss cattle of America are a distinct 
dairy breed. They have been generally known as a dual- 
purpose breed, but the American Brown Swiss Cattle 
Breeders’ Association has decreed it a distinct dairy breed.
-P-A-G-E-341
THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 301 
332. History.— This breed is descended from the 
-Brown Switzer or Schwyzer cattle, established from a time 
beyond historic record in the mountainous country of 
Switzerland, especially in the Cantons of Ziirich, Zug and 
Schwitz or Schwyz. 
The first importation of Brown Swiss cattle, consisting 
of seven cows and one bull, was made by Henry M. Clark, 
of Belmont, Massachusetts, in 1869. They were subse- 
quently sold to D. Hall, of Providence, Rhode Island, 
and D. G. Aldrich, of Worcester, Massachusetts. From 
them and subsequent importations by W. Koch and J. B. 
Eldredge, of New York; Scott & Harris, of Connecticut ; 
E. M. Barton, of Illinois, and McCormick Brothers, have 
sprung the 2500 bulls and 3700 cows since registered as 
pure-bred cattle by the Brown Swiss Cattle Breeders’ 
Association. In 1904, McLaury Brothers, of New York 
State, made a large importation. 
333. Description. — As a breed the Brown Swiss cattle 
are fairly large, the cows averaging 1200 pounds and the 
bulls 1800 pounds, 
with a rugged form, 
covered with a soft 
mellow skin of unusual 
thickness, giving the 
animal a sleek appear- 
ance. The color is a 
shade from light to 
dark chestnut brown. 
The peculiar markings Fia. 51.— Brown Swiss bull. 
are a light tuft of hair 
between the horns, on the inside of the ears and a narrow 
line along the back. The nose is black, with mouth sur- 
rounded with a meal-colored band; a yellow strip along 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
802 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
the middle of, the under lip crosses over to the upper lip 
and extends up the sides of the nostrils. The horns are 
of medium size and length, well set, with black tips; face 
dishing, with a large, full eye, denoting energy and vigor. 
The tail is long, with heavy black switch. The hoofs 
and tongue are also 
black. The hindlegs 
are straight, with thighs 
well cut out before and 
behind. The udder is 
large, extending well 
up in front and rear. 
The teats are large 
and well placed at the 
corners of the udder, 
with a beautifully 
formed escutcheon. The ribs are well sprung. The heart 
girth is large, pelvic arch high and hips broad. The short 
legs give the appearance of under weight, differing from 
other dairy breeds in that they have a stronger and more 
vigorous appearance (Figs. 51, 52). fd 
334. Uses of Brown Swiss cattle. — They are persistent 
milkers and usually produce large ayerages for the yedir, 
occasionally as high as 10,000 pounds of milk and 500 
pounds of butter-fat. The milk is adapted for condensing, 
and for butter and cheese production.. They are reputed 
to produce more milk and butter-fat on rough feed than’ 
any of the other dairy breeds. The average -per cent of 
butter-fat is 4.3. In 1891, the cow Brienz No. 168, at the 
age of twelve years, in a carefully supervised test at 
Chicago, made the very notable record of an average yield 
of 81.7 pounds of milk per day for three days, containing 
9.32 pounds of butter-fat.

THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 303 
Brown Swiss cattle have not been popular as beef- 
producers in America, although they are highly prized for 
this purpose in Switzerland. They fatten rapidly and 
attain good size. They dress out about 60 per cent. The 
calves make excellent veal at six weeks, weighing 250 to 
300 pounds. They produce a white, highly flavored meat. 
The use of Brown Swiss bulls on grade cows to produce 
veal calves is highly recommended. They are also valu- 
able for crossing on debilitated common stock for infusing 
new vigor. 
335. Feeding and care. — As has been said, the Brown 
Swiss cattle originated in the mountainous country of 
Switzerland, where the feed is grass and hay alone ‘and 
where grains are scarce and expensive. They grazed on 
the mountain side in the summer and were fed hay in the 
valley in the winter. 
336. Distribution. — Brown Swiss cattle are in high 
favor in Europe, especially in Russia, Germany and Italy. 
. In Switzerland they are the most popular milk-producing 
cattle. They are rather generally scattered over the 
United States. Some of the larger herds are now in 
Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin, and are used almost 
exclusively for dairy purposes. They are also found 
in Mexico. Their ruggedness and ability to thrive on 
rough, sparse pastures, adapts them to a wide range of 
conditions. 
337. Organizations’ and records.— The American 
Brown Swiss Cattle: Breeders’ Association, organized in 
1880, cares for the interests of the breed in this country. 
It is made up of less than 100 Brown Swiss breeders, many 
of them millionaire farmers who take great pride in this 
stock. To date it has published three small herd-books, 
recording 4900 bulls and over 7000 cows.

338. Dutch Belted cattle are a dairy breed. Their 
native home is in Holland, where they are known as Laken- 
felds, Lakenvelders or Veldlarkers, which means literally 
a field of white, but conveys the idea of a white body with 
black ends. 
339. History in Holland. — The early history of this 
breed is not fully understood, but from the records obtain- 
able, and from conversation with several of the oldest 
breeders in Holland, it seems that these cattle began to 
flourish about 1750, and no doubt the system of selection 
by which this marvelous color breeding was attained, dates 
back into the sixteenth century. One breeder says his 
father informed him that there were gentlemen of wealth 
and leisure near what is now called Haarlem, North Hol- 
land, who conceived the idea of breeding animals of all kinds 
to a certain color, chiefly with a broad band of white in the 
center of the body, with black ends. These noblemen had 
large estates, and it is said that for more than 100 years 
they and their descendants worked on the perfection of 
these peculiar color-markings, until they produced belted 
cattle, pigs and poultry. That these breeders were wonder- 
fully successful, no one questions, as we have the results 
of their labors in the Dutch Belted cattle, Lakenvelder 
poultry of England and America, the Lancheswine of Hol- 
land and Germany and the Hampshire swine of America, 
which were supposed to originate in Hampshire, England, 
but undoubtedly are the descendants of the Haarlem herds 
of long ago. All of these breeds possess a belt, and carry 
out the idea of their originators in a marvelous degree.
-P-A-G-E-345
      THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 805 
340. History in America. — Dutch Belted cattle were 
first imported to America in 1838. D. H. Haight was the 
largest importer. He made his first importation in 1838, 
and a later one in 1848. His herd became scattered over 
Orange county, New York, until one will find a great 
many belted cows in every township in that county to-day. 
Robert W. Coleman also imported a large herd to place 
on his estate at Cornwall, Pennsylvania. The Dutch 
Belted cattle in America to-day are entirely descended 
from these herds. In 1840, P. T. Barnum imported a 
number of Dutch Belted cattle for show purposes, but 
shortly placed them on his farm in Orange county, New 
York. One heifer was imported in 1906 by H. W. Lance, 
of New York City, for his farm in New Jersey, but pre- 
vious to that time none were brought over for more than 
fifty years. This was due chiefly to the very great diffi- 
culty in securing them and to the restriction against im- 
porting them. A number have been exported from this 
country to Canada and Mexico, and a few to Cuba. In 
1893, H..B. Richards, secretary of the Dutch Belted Cattle 
Association, sold his World’s Fair herd, numbering six- 
teen, and nine others to a son-in-law of President Diaz 
and shipped them to Mexico. Later, Richards sold twenty 
to William Van Horne, of Canada. Other exportations 
have been made. There are about fifteen hundred head 
in America at the present time. 
341. Description. — In size, these cattle rank about 
with the Ayrshires, and are also much the same in general 
conformation, being, if anything, a little larger, and hav- 
ing a little more length of leg. Cows range from 900 to 
1300 pounds in weight. Bulls often weigh 2000 pounds. 
The best types of the breed represent a highly developed 
dairy form, having thin necks, small heads, straight backs, 
x

deep chests, hips and rumps high and broad, udders “i

temperament. The 
are very quiet in dis- 
position. The most 
distinctive feature of 
| this breed is the very 
wonderful, pure white 
belt. This belt, when- 
, : ideal, should be a little

and a little in front of the hips, and should extend entirely 
around the body in a line-like appearance. The body is 
coal black, and these combinations of color, so beauti- 
fully blended, are the wonder of all who see them (Figs. 
53, 54). 
342. Uses of Dutch Belted cattle. — Dutch Belted cows, 
as a rule, are large, persistent milkers, giving milk con- 
stantly, almost with- 
out going dry. The 
fact that we have 
many breeders of 
fifteen, twenty and 
twenty-five years’ ex- 
perience who are as 
enthusiastic as ever, 
speaks strongly of the 
merits of the breed. 
In order to convey an idea of the ability of this breed in 
the production of milk and butter, we cite the records of 
the cows of some of the breeders for long periods. J. A. 
Holbert, of New York, at one time had a fine herd of 
    Fic. 54.— Dutch Belted cow.
-P-A-G-E-347
THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 307 
Dutch Belted cattle and he kept a careful record for over 
eight years. Twenty-five of his cows and heifers averaged 
about 9000 pounds yearly, fed eight pounds of grain and 
hay ad libitum in winter and pasture alone in summer. 
Mrs. S. A. F. Servin, one of the largest breeders, who 
has maintained a farm solely for profit, kept a daily rec- 
ord for eleven years, and twenty-five cows averaged be- 
tween nine and ten thousand pounds of milk yearly. 
D. B. Wilson of Connecticut, who has made butter from 
his herd for about twelve years, says that it takes about 
ten quarts of milk to make a pound of butter. Cows in 
the Mountain Lawn Herd of New Hampshire, owned by 
the writer, have averaged as follows: Eleven cows made 
an average of 8579 pounds of milk for eight years. One 
cow produced 12,672 pounds of milk in one year and in 
six years 60,297 pounds. The average production of 
butter by this cow was 596 pounds yearly. 
This breed of cattle has'a use for ornamental purposes. 
Because of their unique appearance and beauty, they are 
constantly sought by persons of wealth who desire some- 
thing novel as well as useful. 
343. Feeding. — These cattle do best on a compara- 
tively light grain ration, usually not over eight pounds 
properly balanced. When fed heavy they return a less 
per cent of profits. This is a reason, also, why Dutch 
Belted cattle do well in sections of country where feed is 
not abundant. 
344. Distribution. — Dutch Belted cattle are not widely 
distributed, but are found in comparatively small numbers 
in Holland, Canada, United States and Mexico. In 
America the largest herds are found in the New England 
States and New York. The cattle are also found in Penn- 
sylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Mississippi and other parts 
   
-P-A-G-E-348
808 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
of the South, and several fine herds are being built up on 
the Pacific coast. 
As many of these cattle have been kept successfully in 
northern New England for years, they have gradually 
assumed a hardy constitution, well adapted to withstand 
New England climates. There also seems to be a place 
for them in hilly sections, as they are active and well able 
to rustle. 
345. Organizations and records. — The Dutch Belted 
Cattle Association of America was organized February 4, 
1886, in New York City, and is the only organization pro- 
moting the breed in America. The Netherland General 
Stamboek, published at the Hague, Holland, is the foreign 
representative. Eleven herd-books of the Dutch Belted 
Cattle Association of America have been published to 
date, recording 3600. The address of the secretary is 
Covert, Michigan. 
FRENCH-CANADIAN CaTTLE. Figs. 55, 56. 
By G. E. Day 
346. French-Canadian cattle, or “Quebec Jerseys ” as 
they are sometimes called, belong to the strictly dairy 
class. They are an American breed, developed in Canada. 
347. History.— French-Canadian cattle are undoubtedly 
descended from cattle brought to Canada from Brittany 
and Normandy by the early French settlers, between the 
years 1620 and 1650. They are thought, therefore, to be 
of the same origin as the Jersey and Guernsey, and their 
appearance testifies to the truth of this opinion. Al- 
though the climate of the province of Quebec, where these 
cattle were brought by the settlers, is much more severe
-P-A-G-E-349
   THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 309 
than that of their native land, these little cattle showed 
wonderful adaptability to changed circumstances, and 
appear to have thriven under a rigorous climate, cold 
stables, coarse fare and very indifferent care and manage- 
ment. The result is a breed that is second to none in 
hardiness ; and it is said that it is a very rare thing for an 
animal of this breed to be affected with tuberculosis. 
348. Description. — French-Canadian cattle are some- 
what small, mature cows weighing 700 to 900 pounds, and 
bulls about 1000 pounds. The rules for registration con- 
tain the following statements regarding color: “ The 
color for cows may be 
black or brown, or 
dark brown, with or 
without a_ yellow 
stripe along the back 
and around the muzzle, 
or a gray stripe around 
the muzzle. The color 
may also be fawn or 
brindle. The color for 
bulls may be black or 
brown, or dark brown 
with or without a yellow stripe along the back and around 
the muzzle, or a gray stripe around the muzzle. Females 
may have a little white under the belly, on the forehead 
or in the switch, and bulls a little white under the belly or 
in the switch. The horns must be white with black tips 
or black with white tips.” In general appearance they 
resemble the Jersey, but have less of the deer-like appear- 
ance possessed by the Jersey, and are somewhat more 
rugged in appearance.’ The type is lean and muscular, 
. and the cows tend to be wedge-shaped (Figs. 55, 56). \ 
  Fig. 55. — French-Canadian bull.
-P-A-G-E-350
810 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
349. Uses of French-Canadian cattle. — The French- 
Canadian is a strictly dairy breed. As yet, milk and butter 
records for the breed are not very numerous. Generally 
speaking, in quantity and quality of milk they resemble 
the Jersey. At the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa, 
Ontario, in 1903, a French-Canadian cow made more 
butter and gave a larger profit than any other pure-bred 
cow in the herd, including Ayrshires, Guernseys and 
Shorthorns. In 1904, 
in the same herd, 
three French-Cana- 
dian cattle made more 
butter and gave a 
larger profit than the 
three best cows of any 
other breed, including 
Ayrshires, Guernseys 
Fig, 56.— French-Canadian cow. and Shorthorns. The 
yearly product per cow 
of these three cows was 8340 pounds of milk, testing 4.52 
_ per cent, or 442.64 pounds of butter. The total yearly 
profit per cow above cost of feed was $56.24. In the 
Pan-American test, the five French-Canadian cows stood 
sixth in total profits from butter and gain in weight, but in 
percentage of profit on value of food, they led all breeds. 
A record of performance has been established in connec- 
tion with the breed, the first cow to qualify under the 
tules producing, in eleven months, 7488 pounds of milk, 
and 332.8 pounds of butter-fat. It will be seen, therefore, 
that the French-Canadian cow possesses dairy qualities 
of no mean character. 
The use of the French-Canadian bulls on native cows 
should be especially appropriate in the Northeast, where 
   
-P-A-G-E-351
   THE DAIRY BREEDS OF CATTLE 311 
dairying is a specialty, and no doubt the offspring would 
show increased vigor over the dams, and in many cases 
the cows would yield milk richer in butter-fat. 
350. Management.— One of the most remarkable 
things about French-Canadian cattle is the degree of excel- 
lence as dairy cattle which they have retained under 
generations of unskilled selection, bare pastures in sum- 
mer, and, as a rule, a winter ration of nothing but straw. 
But they respond readily to more liberal treatment. The 
application of well-known principles of breeding, and the 
following of a judicious system of feeding, should render 
the French-Canadian a really prominent dairy breed. 
351. Distribution. — As might be expected, the head- 
quarters for this breed is the province of Quebec, where 
they are popular with the French-Canadian farmer, or 
“habitant.” It is only within comparatively recent years 
that the breed has become known to the outside’ world. 
The entering of five cows in the Pan-American dairy test, 
where they gave a remarkably good account of them- 
selves, served to advertise the breed more than any other 
circumstance, and they are now to be found in several 
states of the Union, as well as in the provinces of Ontario, 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. 
They have also established themselves on the island of 
Anticosti. These cattle should prove of value on the 
hills of northeastern United States, especially in New 
England, New York and Pennsylvania. As yet, however, 
the number of herds outside of Quebec is comparatively 
small, and it is difficult to say just how far these hardy 
little cattle may extend their domain. 
352. Organizations and records. — The first organiza- 
tion in the interests of French-Canadian cattle was formed 
in 1886, and a record was established to enter foundation
-P-A-G-E-352
312 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
stock. The record was placed in the hands of a commis- 
sion appointed by the Quebec government. In 1895, this 
record was handed over to the French-Canadian Cattle 
Breeders’ Association, organized by J. A. Couture, Quebec, 
who is still secretary of the Association. In 1896, the 
Foundation Herd-book was closed, and since that time 
only the progeny of recorded animals have been accepted 
for registration. In the Foundation Herd-book there were 
recorded 5307 females and 922 males. In 1905, the old 
“ French-Canadian Cattle Book” was taken over by 
the Canadian National Live-Stock Records.

CHAPTER X 
THE DUAL-PURPOSE BREEDS OF CATTLE 
Ir kept true to type, individuals representing this group 
of breeds are larger than dairy cows, have an ample, 
blocky form, approaching that of the beef steer, yet with 
an udder development superior to that found in any but 
dairy cows.

353. Red Polled cattle are a dual-purpose breed, rank- 
ing very highly in both milk- and butter-production. 
354. History in England. — Hornless or polled cattle 
have existed in the county of Suffolk, England, from time 
immemorial. The probability seems to be that they 
were introduced soon after the Roman occupation. Bede 
says that the people who settled in eastern England after 
the Romans had gone, brought with them slaves, their 
cattle and all their live-stock. Certain it is the breed 
has existed in Suffolk as far back as we can trace the history. 
Of the Norfolk strain of the breed, H. F. Euren, in the 
account prepared for the herd-book, says: “ The files of 
the Norwich Mercury show that as early as the year 1778, 
there were whole dairies of polled cows in Norfolk.” In 
the advertisements of that and succeeding years, sales of 
313

814 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
polled cows and bulls are specially referred to. Money 
Griggs, of Gately, who died in 1872, in his hundredth 
year, and who had been for upwards of eighty years a 
tenant of the Elmham estate, informed Mr. Fulcher, 
when making inquiries as to the breed, that “from his 
earliest recollection Red Polled cattle had been kept in 
the neighborhood of Elmham.” 
355. History in America. — There seems little doubt 
that our so-called native muley cows are descendants, 
more or less mixed with other strains, of the Norfolk and 
Suffolk cows brought over by the early emigrants from 
that section. They have been preserved from extinction 
by the persistence of their good qualities. The persist- 
ence with which the old Suffolk traits are transmitted, 
under what would seem most adverse conditions, finds a 
striking illustration in what were known in Massachusetts 
as Jamestown cattle. In 1847, during the famine in 
Ireland, the people of Boston sent a shipload of provisions 
to that country to relieve the distress. As a slight token 
of appreciation, a Mr. Jeffries, living near Cork, presented 
to the captain a Suffolk polled heifer. She was delivered 
by him to the donors of the provisions, and was sold at 
auction for the benefit of the fund. She proved a re- 
markably fine milker, and her progeny (mostly bulls, by 
what were then known as Alderney sires) were used 
largely in the dairy herds about Boston. The progeny 
of these half-blood Suffolk bulls were nearly all hornless, 
and were so superior to the ordinary cattle of the district 
as to become noted. They were known as Jamestown 
cattle, from the name of the vessel in, which the heifer 
came over. At several local fairs they were shown in 
considerable numbers. 
The first regular importation of Red Polled cattle for  
-P-A-G-E-355
   THE DUAL-PURPOSE BREEDS OF CATTLE 315 
breeding purposes was made by G. F. Taber, of New 
York, in 1873. This importation consisted of a bull and 
three heifers. In 1875, he imported four more cows, and 
in 1882, three bulls and twenty-three heifers. From this 
time, the number brought over increased rapidly from 
year to year, until the prices on the other side became so 
high that the business was unprofitable. 
356. Description. — In general, the bull is strong, im- 
pressive, low-set and of good carriage, and weighs 1800 to 
2000 pounds, when 
mature and finished. 
The cow is of medium 
wedge-form, low-set, 
with top and under 
lines straight, except 
at flank, and weighs 
1300 to 1500 pounds 
when mature and fin- 
ished (Figs. 57, 58). 
367. Types. — 
Breeders of these two 
types, striving to 
produce good dual-purpose animals, that should be 
polled and red-colored, gradually worked toward the 
same type. Mr. Euren says: ‘The year 1846 may be 
taken as the date from which the Norfolk and Suffolk 
varieties merged into each other, so as to be spoken of 
as one and the same breed.’ There was a friendly 
rivalry between the two counties at the agricultural 
shows, and a constant interchange of the best blood, 
with a resulting improvement and similarity in the two 
strains. After an exhibit at Battersea in 1862, when 
it was noted that the best forms of the two types were | 
  Fig. 57.— Red Polled bull.
-P-A-G-E-356
  316 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
of the same kind, the name Norfolk and Suffolk Red 
Polled cattle was given them. Later, about 1882, the 
first part was dropped, since which time the cattle have 
been known simply as Red Polled. 
Suffolk Red Polled cattle. — This type was characterized 
by a thin, clean head; clean throat with little dewlap; 
thin legs; a large 
frame; rib  tolerably 
springing from the 
center of the back, but 
with a heavy barrel; 
backbone ridged ; udder 
large, loose and creased 
when empty; milk 
veins remarkably large, 
and rising in knotted 
puffs. It was the 
dairy type, and was remarkable for the large and uniform 
yield of milk. It was developed in the county of Suffolk, 
England, at a very early date. 
Norfolk Red Polled cattle. —This type was characterized 
by small bones, short legs and round barrel, with good 
loins, and the head rather fine. It was a hardy, thriving 
strain, maturing at an early age and making a superior 
quality of flesh. It was the beef type and had poorer 
milking qualities than the Suffolk. It was developed at 
an early date in Norfolk county, England. 
358. Uses of Red Polled cattle. —The Red Polled 
cattle are a dual-purpose breed, and we find that they have 
made a large number of very creditable records, both in 
dairy tests and in slaughter tests. 
For milk and butter. — The cows give a good flow of 
milk, which tests well, and milk right up to calving if     Fic. 58.— Red Polled cow.
-P-A-G-E-357
  THE DUAL-PURPOSE BREEDS OF CATTLE 317 
allowed. Some results of tests may be given to illustrate 
this point. The following dairy tests have been made at 
state fairs. At the Ohio State Fair a three-days’ test re- 
sulted as follows: The cow Queen Bess 20335 gave 99 
pounds of milk and 5.316 pounds of fat; the cow Miss 
McKinley 17203 gave 82.7 pounds of milk and 3.843 
pounds of fat; the cow Cassandra 2d 16305 gave 92.1 
pounds of milk and 3.48 pounds of fat. At the Illinois 
State Fair, in a three-days’ test the Red Polled cow 
Olena 18772 gave 128.4 pounds of milk and 4.533 pounds 
of fat. The next highest cow of any breed in the show 
made 4.234 pounds of fat. At the Wisconsin State Fair, 
in a three-days’ test the Red Polled cow Olena 18772 
gave 125 pounds and _.12 ounces of milk, and made 5.336 
pounds of fat. The cow 24888 Pear made a record in 
twelve months of 13160.6 pounds of milk and 603.66 
pounds of butter-fat. Jean Duluth Beauty, 31725, 1 yr., 
20280.6 pounds milk and 891.58 pounds fat. 
For beef. — The steers make a good growth, are ready 
for market at an early age and furnish a very fine quality 
of meat. The following slaughter tests, made at the 
International Live-Stock Exposition, show the standing of 
the Red Polled cattle in meat-production: For two- 
year-olds (1906), the highest yield was made by an Aber- 
deen-Angus, dressing 69.5 per cent; the next highest was 
a Red Polled, dressing 69.2 per cent. For yearlings 
(1906), the highest yield was a Red Polled, dressing 67.5 
per cent; the next highest was a Hereford, dressing 67.1 
per cent. For two-year-olds (1907), the highest yield 
was made by an Aberdeen-Angus, dressing 66.9 per cent ; 
the next highest was an Aberdeen-Angus, dressing 66.64 
per cent; the next was a Red Polled, dressing 66.6 per 
cent. In this test were fifteen entries.  
-P-A-G-E-358
318 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
For crossing and grading, Red Polled bulls have been 
used extensively and with good results. They transmit 
the color and polled character uniformly, and may be 
used profitably on either dairy or beef common stock. 
They cross well with Shorthorns. 
359. Distribution.—In England, we find the Red 
Polled cattle in their native counties of Norfolk and 
Suffolk. They are also found in South America, Australia, 
Russia, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada and the 
United States. In America we find the greatest number 
of Red Polled cattle in the Mississippi valley, in the 
states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Iowa, the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska and 
Missouri. We also find them on the Atlantic coast, the 
Pacific coast and in Texas. In the last-named place they 
are very numerous and do exceptionally well. 
360. Organizations and records. — The Red Polled 
Society of Great Britain and Ireland was organized in 
1888, at which time it took up the publishing of the Red 
Polled Herd-book, which had been published by H. F. 
Euren since 1874. The Red Polled Cattle Club of America 
was organized at Chicago in 1883. The first volume of 
its herd-book appeared in 1887, since which time twenty- 
seven volumes have been issued recording 69,000 cattle. 
Until 1901, the American Red Polled Herd-book included 
all of the cattle entered in the English series. At present 
only cattle grown in this country are published in the 
American series. There are several state associations in 
America devoted to the breed.

Devon Carrie. Figs. 59, 60. 
By L. P. Sisson 
361.. The Devon is a dual-purpose breed of cattle, 
containing both beef and dairy types. Because of the 
bright red color the animals are sometimes called 
“ Rubies.” 
362. History in England. — From time immemorial 
there has been known in the south and west of England 
and on the borders of Wales, especially in the county of 
Devon, a breed of cattle of uniform red color, rather long 
and graceful horns, well- 
rounded and symmetri- 
cal: bodies and straight, 
broad backs, rather 
lighter in bone than § 
some other breeds and 
shorter in the legs, thus 
possessing many of the 
characters of the present- 
day Devon. They were gentle and hardy, active and 
accustomed to gaining their living while roaming over the 
bleak moors or rocky hills of their rough native country. 
Here they were known as the “red” cows. They were 
the main reliance of their owners for dairy products. 
These mountain-bred cattle were sought after as “feeders” 
in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, as well as in Hereford. 
Among the early breeders of importance should be 
mentioned the Quartly and Davy families, through whose 
efforts the Devons were greatly improved. For several 
generations the Quartly family devoted themselves to 
improving the Devons, and Francis Quartly, who began

320 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
his work in 1793, stands preéminent among Devon 
breeders. The best blood in the breed has descended from 
his herd. John Tanner Davy began the improvement of 
a Devon herd left to him by his father in 1790. On his 
death in 1852, his son, Colonel Davy, continued his work, 
and became foremost among Devon breeders of the time. 
The latter did a great 
deal to popularize the 
breed by his writings 
and by his personal 
efforts. 
363. History in 
America. — The exact 
date of the first impor- 
tations of Devons is 
i ; uncertain, but it is 
Fic. 60. — Devon cow. thought that a few 
head were brought to America in 1623 by the colonists. 
Beginning with an importation in 1800 to Massachusetts, 
several importations were made, the most notable being 
in 1817, when six pure-bred heifers and a bull were re- 
ceived by Robert Patterson of Baltimore. The Patter- 
sons made later importations, and were in no small way 
responsible for the development of the breed in this 
country. Other breeders imported Devon stock into 
United States and Canada, but the breed has not become 
very popular, despite the fact that it is worthy. 
364. Description. —In general, the Devons are a 
docile but hardy breed of cattle, well adapted to thrive on 
short and hilly pasture, while at the same time responding 
to good care (Figs. 59, 60). 
365. Types. — Two types: of Devon cattle have been 
developed. The North Devon, a hardy, compact type, is 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  THE DUAL-PURPOSE BREEDS OF CATTLE 3821 
probably the original form. The animals are smaller, 
and have been developed for beef-production primarily. 
The South Devon, a larger and coarser type, has been 
developed for both meat and milk, and is now almost a 
distinct breed. ; 
366. Uses of Devon cattle. — While the Devons are 
not primarily dairy cattle, still some splendid milk-pro- 
ducers have been developed. Although the quantity of 
the milk-yield is not large, the quality is good, which gives 
them definite value for butter-making. As a rule they 
possess well-shaped udders. 
For beef. — A chief recommendation of the Devon for 
beef is that it dresses with little waste, and the meat is 
of very superior quality. The animals make good gains 
under stall-feeding but cannot be forced to so great an 
extent as some of the other beef breeds, and generally are 
lighter when marketed. The breed is small, which has 
sometimes militated against it for meat purposes. 
For oxen. — The superior intelligence, quick and active 
movements and great strength of the Devons render the 
oxen among the best known and handsomest in the world. 
Their rapid gait and firm step, together with the ease 
with which they are trained, have gained for them this 
superiority. 
For grazing. — As grazers, the Devons stand in the 
first rank, as they are active and hardy, and have been 
accustomed to rustle on light, hilly pastures. 
For crossing. — Prepotency is a characteristic of Devon 
cattle due to their pure breeding for so long a period. 
When crossed on grade cows the results are very satis- 
factory for both meat- and milk-production. 
367. Distribution. — The Devon cattle are widely 
distributed, being found scattered through the south of

  822 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
England, in Ireland, South Africa, parts of Australia, 
Tasmania, New Zealand, the West Indies and in Canada, 
United States and Mexico. The breed is now represented 
in every state in the Union with few exceptions, but is 
most numerous in New England, New York, Pennsylvania,” 
Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin and Texas. Virginia, Mary- 
~ land, the Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama each have many 
herds. It is well adapted to warm climates. 
368. Organizations and records. — In 1851, Colonel 
Davy issued the first volume of the English Devon Herd- 
book, other volumes being put out from time to time until 
1881, when seven volumes had been published. The 
Devon Cattle Breeders’ Society, organized in 1880, bought 
the Herd-book in 1884, and has since increased it to thirty- 
eight volumes. The South Devon Herd-book Society, 
was organized in 1890. It also published a herd-book. 
The first volume of the American Devon Herd-book ap- 
peared in 1863, and in 1879 the fifth and last volume was 
issued. In 1881, volume one of the American Devon 
Record was published, seven other volumes having ap- 
peared since. Yearbooks have also been issued. The 
official organization for the promotion of the interests 
of the breed in this country is known as the American 
Devon Cattle Club, with the secretary’s office at Char- 
lottesville, Virginia.

CHAPTER XI 
LESSER KNOWN BREEDS OF CATTLE 
By Carl W. Gay 
Ar this point we may bring together very brief accounts 
of some of the breeds that occupy a minor place in this 
country, although they may not be closely related to 
each other. ; 
369. Kerry cattle have been developed by and in the in- 
terest of the Irish tenant farmers, and are, therefore, most 
economical producers and endowed with unusual hardihood. 
The true Kerry, distinguished from the Dexter-Kerry, 
is a pony dairy cow, usually black in color, though occa- 
sionally red (Fig. 61). Their appearance is more rugged 
than refined, and their 
size is smaller than that 
of any other bovine. 
They stand from 36 to 
40 inches high and weigh 
from 500 to 600 pounds 
in the case of cows and 
up to 1000 pounds for 
bulls. The most dis- 
tinguishing characteris- 
tic of the Kerry, after size, form and color, is their long, 
rather straight, fine white horn with a black tip. 
Some Kerrys produce a remarkable amount of milk con- 
sidering their size. They have not been especially well

received in this country, their usefulness being somewhat 
restricted. They seem best adapted to the requirements 
of small families who 
desire to keep a cow 
for their own use, but 
do not care for the 
amount of milk yielded 
by a larger cow. 
370. Dexter-Kerry 
cattle. — The Dexter- 
Kerry is a dual-pur- 
pose derivative from 
the true Kerry, the 
prefixed name being that of the man in whose hands they 
were first bred. They are miniature beef cattle which kill 
well, yet they have some dairy capacity. They are as 
small or smaller than the true Kerry and are of less uni- 
form color, being red 
and roan as well as (i

is a very old breed, but has not been extensively taken 
up outside of the district to which it is native. Kyloes 
have the distinction of dressing the highest quality carcass, 
but their small size and the fact that they feed and finish 
slowly renders them of little economic value in competition 
with the great beef breeds.

The limited number that have come to this country 
have been imported more for ornamental than practical 
purposes. Their appearance is more picturesque and at- 
tractive, with their extremely heavy coats of yellow, red, 
brindle or black hair, their long, spreading horns and 
their alert, active demeanor. 
372. Brahmin, Zebu or sacred cattle of India (Fig. 63). 
— While these cattle are usually thought of as exhibits in 
zodlogical gardens and menageries, they have some eco- 
nomic importance. In the South, especially Texas, Brah- 
min bulls are bred to native or even grade beef-bred cows 
in the helief that the one-half- or three-quarter-breds do 
better than the improved cattle on account of their greater 
resistance to parasites, flies, ticks and the heat. 
373. Simmenthal. — This is a Swiss breed named from 
the valley of the Simme. They are triple-purpose cattle 
used for milk, beef and work. It is customary to work the 
steers one or two seasons 
before they are turned 
off for beef. They are 
large, of rugged ap- 
pearance and of rather 
beefy form. The color 
is a peculiar light shade 
of fawn or drab with 
some white markings. 
374. Longhorn cattle 
(Fig. 64). — This is an 
ancient British race of 
cattle most notable on 
account of its having been the object of Robert Bakewell’s

The Texas Longhorn was the earliest race of cattle to 
inhabit our western ranges, being descendants of the 
Spanish stock introduced into Mexico. Their blood has 
been bred out by grading up with pure-bred bulls.

CHAPTER XII 
THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 
SHEEP in this group vary considerably in the matter of 
scale but are all of the block form already described in 
reference to the beef cattle. However, the leg of mutton 
in the sheep carcass has a greater proportionate value 
than the round of the beef carcass, so that this region 
in addition to the back and loin receives special considera- 
tion from the sheep judge. 
SourHpown Suxep. Figs. 65, 66. 
By H. P. Miller 
375. The name Southdown as applied to sheep arose 
from the use of the term in referring to the loyy range of 
chalk hills in southeastern England, in Sussex county, 
where the breed was developed. The’date at which it 
was first used is not known, but in 1794, Arthur Young, 
in an essay, brought the breed into prominence. The 
breed ranks in the first place for mutton-production. 
376. History in England.— The Southdown breed 
was developed through selection from the native Sussex 
sheep on the chalky downs of southeastern England. 
The native sheep were small, ill-shaped and coarse-wooled. 
About 1780 or earlier, John Ellman, doubtless taking in- 
spiration from the success of Bakewell with the Leicester, 
329  
-P-A-G-E-372
  330 THE BREEDS OF LIV E-STOCK 
| 
began the development of the breed, striving for better 
mutton form and constitution, and at the same time to 
improve the fleece. He made rapid progress in fixin 
the present features of the Southdown. About 1820, 
Jonas Webb began breeding Southdowns with a selection 
from the Ellman and other flocks, and he proved to be 
the genius among the breeders. He built on Ellman’s 
foundation, and produced this superior mutton sheep, of 
larger size and better feeding quality. The Southdow: 
was thus the first of the Down or middle-wool breeds to 
be improved, and has been employed in the development 
of the other Down breeds, particularly the Shropshire, 
Oxford and Hampshire. It early became the breed of 
the English royalty and aristocracy, and remains so to 
the present time. 
377. History in America. — The first authentic appr 
tation into America was by Dr. Rose, of Seneca county, 
New York, in 1803. The sheep of this importation, how- 
ever, were crossed with Merinos in 1813. In 1823, Sidney . 
Hawes, of New York, made another importation and 
sold thirty-six ewes and two rams to C. N. Bement 
Albany. In 1834, Francis Rotch, of Otsego county, New 
York, imported six ewes and a ram from the Ellman flock. 
In the same year; Isaac Maynard, of Coshocton count , 
Ohio, made an importation. During the forties and fifties 
of the same century, while wool was very low and Merinos 
falling into disfavor, Southdowns became disseminated 
very widely. With the revival of interest in Merinos from 
the high prices for wool following the Civil War, South- 
downs fell into disfavor, and because of their low wool- 
yield and the relative importance of wool in this country, 
they have not regained wide popularity in the North or 
on the ranges. South of the Ohio river, however, es-
-P-A-G-E-373
THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 331 
pecially in Kentucky and Tennessee, they were for many 
years the prevailing breed, and are still popular. 
378. Description. —It is the smallest of the Down 
breeds that are prominent in America’ at this time, but it 
is the model in form toward 
which all other breeds are 
tending. Its compact form 
and short fleece, however, 
give it a weight greater than 
its appearance suggests. 
Mature ewes weigh up to 150 
pounds, and rams up to 200, 
although average weights are 
somewhat less (Figs. 65, 66). 
In 1788, Arthur Young 
wrote: ‘The true South- 
down, when very well bred, 
has no horns, a long speckled 
face, clean and thin jaw, a 
long, but not a thin neck, no tuft of wool on the fore- 
head, which they call owl-headed, nor any fringe of wool 
on the cheeks, thick in the 
shoulder, openbreasted, and 
deep; both fore- and hind- 
legs stand wide; round and 
straight in barrel; wide on 
the loin and hips; shut well 
in the twist, which is a pro- 
jection of flesh on the inner 
part of the thigh that gives 
a fullness when viewed be- 
hind, and makes a Southdown leg of mutton remarkably 
round and short, more so than other breeds; thin speckled

legs free from wool; the belly full of wool; the wool clos 
and free from projecting or strong fibers. Those flocks n 
bred with particular care are apt to be coarse wooled o 
the back.” | 
The Southdown of to-day presents some contrasts t 
this: It is characterized by very short, straight legs, s 
wide apart; broad, level back, very thickly fleshed ; lon; 
and broad hips, with tail setting very little below level 
of back; short neck, very thick at shoulder and sharpl 
tapering toward head; the head small, but comparativel 
broad and flat between the ears; forehead full; face shot 
and in ewes somewhat dished; eyes very prominent; 
ears small, carried above the level and covered, the English 
association says, with wool, while the American says 
with fine hair. The face and legs are now a uniform red- 
dish brown, except some lingering white hairs about the 
nose. The face has a lively expression, in keeping with the 
quick movements of the Southdown. The hind-quarters 
carry down very heavy; the twist is extremely deep and 
full; the breast very broad and prominent; both fore 
and hind flanks very full, thus giving an almost straight 
under-line. The hoofs are often black. They are of thin 
yet firm horn, making a good foot. There is now a large 
cap of wool on the forehead, and on many specimens the 
wool is working farther down on the legs. A bright pink 
color of skin is desired, and is uniformly found with healthy 
individuals. 'The Southdown may safely be said to be the 
hardiest of all the English breeds under American condi- 
tions and methods. It is freer from catarrhal troubles and 
does not so quickly succumb to the ravages of internal 
parasites. In these particulars it approaches the Merino.

prove highly satisfactory for mating with the long-legged

THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 333 
mountain ewes for the production of mutton lambs. 
Pure-breds are also in favor for production of lambs to be 
sold at weaning time. The rams bred to Merino ewes 
produce highly satisfactory lambs for feeding off at eight 
to ten months of age. They produce a high quality of 
mature mutton, as they do not develop fat in bunches. 
The ewes are not suited for growing winter lambs, as they 
will not breed at the right season, but the rams are very 
satisfactory for siring such lambs. The lambs are good 
feeders and mature rapidly. Single lambs are the rule, 
but a flock of ewes usually produces 125 per cent of lambs. 
Southdowns have rarely been known to produce triplets. 
The Southdown has the shortest and finest wool of any 
of the Down or middle-wool breeds. The attempt has 
been to develop a fleece with a compact, smooth surface, 
that is, without spiral tips on the locks of wool. The 
average weight of the fleece for ewes is about six pounds, 
and for rams about eight pounds. The wool grades as 
one-half and three-eighths. 
380. Distribution. — The general adaptability and good 
grazing qualities of the Southdown, together with its 
superior mutton, have led to its wide dissemination. In 
America it has been especially popular in the Central-East 
and South, although it is found in practically every state 
and territory in the Union and in Canada. In South 
America it is found in Argentina, Chile and other countries. 
It has been introduced throughout Europe, Asia, Japan, 
Africa and Australia. 
381. Organization and records. — English and Ameri- 
can record associations were organized in 1882. The 
Southdown Sheep Society has headquarters in London; 
the American Southdown Breeders’ Association, with 
headquarters at Springfield, Illinois, has issued fourteen
-P-A-G-E-376

volumes of its flock-book registering over 32,000. The 
latter has registered sheep from nearly every state in 
the Union. 
SHROPSHIRE Down SHEEP. Plate XII. 
By dH. P. Miller 
382. The name Shropshire, as applied to sheep, was 
derived from the county of that name in England where 
the breed was developed. The breed is officially known 
as Shropshire Down, but the name is often abbrevi- 
ated to Shrop. It is a mutton breed, or perhaps we may 
properly consider it a general-purpose breed. ; 
383. History in England. — Its friends claim for the 
Shropshire an equally remote origin with the Southdown. 
The name, as applied to sheep, is mentioned in English 
literature as far back as 1341, there being at that time a 
grade of wool designated as Shropshire. The breed had 
not taken on many of its present characteristics, however, 
a century ago, as Plymley, in his “ Agriculture of Shrop- 
shire,” published in 1803, described the sheep of that 
country thus: ‘ There is a breed of sheep in Longmynd, 
with horns and black faces, that seem an indigenous 
sort. They are nimble, hardy and weigh about ten 
pounds to the quarter when fatted. Their fleeces weigh 
about two and one-half poynds.”’- Wilson, in his Journal 
of the Royal Agricultural’Society, Vol. XVI, states that 
when the Bristol wool society, in 1792, procured all the 
information available regarding sheep in England, it 
reported that on Morfe Common there were about 10,000 
sheep kept during the summer that had black, brown or 
spotted faces, a superior quality of wool, and were con-
-P-A-G-E-377
  
THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 335 
sidered a native breed. These are accepted as the pro- 
genitors of the present Shropshire, although it is a common 
belief that the Southdown was used to hasten the improve- 
ment. It is thought, also, that the Leicester and Cots- 
wold were used to increase the size and amount of wool, 
and that the sheep from Cannock Chase, in the county 
of Stafford, were used in the early breeding efforts. Samuel 
Meise, of Barrington, and George Adney, of Harley, were 
among the most successful of the early improvers. The 
Shropshire first attracted attention at the Royal Agri- 
cultural Society Show, in 1855; and in 1859 it was recog- 
nized as a distinct breed and given a class. 
384. History in America. — The first American im- 
portation on record was made into Virginia, in 1855. 
In 1860, Samuel Sutton introduced a number of ewes and 
a ram into Maryland. In 1862 and again a few years 
later, flocks were established in New York. They had 
made their way into Canada also, as they are reported to 
have been taken from Canada to Michigan in the early 
seventies. There were large importations in the early 
eighties. The American Record Association was organized 
in 1884, at Lafayette, Indiana. 
385. Description. — The Shropshire now has uniformly 
dark brown face and legs, is 10 to 15 per cent heavier than 
the Southdown, the standard weight for rams being 225 
pounds and for ewes 175 pounds. Many, however, exceed 
these weights by fifty pounds when in show condition. 
It has a broad head, sho®@face, thick, muscular neck, 
closely knit shoulders, symmetrical body, somewhat 
barrel-shaped, except that it is straight on the back. 
In form it is not so good in the thigh and twist as the South- 
down. In general outline, it is taller and more rangy, but 
the present tendency is toward the Southdown in form.   
 
-P-A-G-E-378
  836 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The Shropshire is possessed of great fecundity, early 
maturity and quick-fattening qualities (Plate XII). 
386. Uses of Shropshire sheep. — Their good mutton 
form and quality and profitable wool production make the 
Shropshires the great American sheep after the Merinos, 
in their Delaine and Rambouillet forms. They have a 
much longer, more open and coarser fleece than the 
Southdown, are covered more extensively over the head 
and legs, and yield perhaps 50 per cent more wool. Ewes 
average eight pounds or more and rams twelve pounds of 
fleece. The fleece is of good fiber and carries consider- 
able oil. They are hardier than the larger breeds, 
although yielding to the Southdowns in this particular. 
The lambs may be profitably marketed at any time 
from five to twelve months of age, though usually the 
earlier they are marketed the greater the profit. The rams 
are very generally used on Merino and native ewes for 
the production of high-class mutton lambs. 
387. Distribution. — Shropshires are now recorded 
from almost every state in the Union and from Canada, 
and far exceed in numbers any other English breed in 
America. They are more popular in the North and East, 
not being extensively found on the ranges. They do 
best on good pastures, as their rustling qualities are only 
medium. They are found very generally throughout 
England and her colonies and, in fact, throughout the 
civilized world, especially in Europe, Africa, Australia 
and South America. 
388. Organization and records. — In 1882, the English , 
Shropshire Sheep Society was organized. The first volume 
of its flock-book was issued in 1884. The American Shrop- 
shire Sheep Association was organized in 1884, and has 
issued twenty-six volumes of its flock-book, registering
-P-A-G-E-379

405,000 sheep. There is also a National Shropshire Asso- 
ciation that has issued one volume of its flock-book. 
Oxrorp Down Surep. Plate XII. 
By H. P. Miller 
389. The name Oxford as applied to sheep is derived 
from the county of Oxford, England, where the breed was 
developed. The Oxford Down is a typical mutton 
breed of sheep. 
890. History in England. — About 1829, John T. 
Twynham conceived the idea of developing a new breed 
of sheep combining the good qualities of the long-wools 
and the Down breeds, by mating the most compact 
Cotswold rams obtainable with his Hampshire ewes. A 
few years later, Samuel Druce and Wm. Gillett began 
-a similar system of crossing, although introducing South- 
down blood to some extent. The Hampshire, however, 
was the chief source of Down blood used in the new breed. 
The cross soon became popular, and several other persons 
undertook the same line of breeding or used the cross-bred 
rams so that there was no necessity for in-and-inbreeding ; 
and it does not appear to have been employed to the extent 
that it was in the case of the Southdown. There is no 
definite record as to how long the cross-breeding was con- 
tinued, but, in 1853, Druce wrote that he had no difficulty 
in keeping the form and size of the animal as it should be, 
and the wool of a desirable quality and not deficient in 
quantity. Up to 1857, however, it was known as Down- 
Cotswold, but in that year the name “ Oxfordshire Down ” 
was adopted. A little later it was changed to Oxford 
Down, and these sheep are now generally referred to as 
Z

338 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Oxfords. They were first exhibited at the Royal Agricul- 
tural Society Show in 1851, but a separate class was 
not granted them until 1862. That may be taken as the 
date when they became a recognized breed with a fixed 
type. 
391. History in America.— This breed had gained 
enough recognition by 1846, so that it was in that year 
imported to America by Clayton Reybold, of Delaware« 
_ In 1853, small flocks were brought to Virginia and Massa- 
chusetts. The following year, J. T. Andrew, of West 
Cornwall, Connecticut, imported a flock that spread the 
fame of the breed. In 1857, Andrew sold a small flock 
to Messrs. Smith, of Middlefield, Massachusetts, and to 
C. L. Whiting, of Granville, Ohio. In 1859, Andrew’ sold 
a flock to C. G. Forshay, of Texas. Interest in the breed 
then subsided, and did not revive until about 1880. 
W. A. Shafer, of Ohio, R. J. Stone, of Illinois, Geo. Me- 
Kerrow, of Wisconsin, and Robert Miller, of Ontario, 
in the next few years imported large numbers and dis- 
seminated them widely through the United States and 
Canada. 
392. Description. — The Oxford is the largest of the 
Down breeds. It stands very much higher than the 
Shropshire, is more rangy, straighter on the under-line, 
and has longer and coarser fleece than any other of the 
group. Being a cross-bred sheep of rather recent origin, 
the type is not so well established as with the other Down 
breeds. Some specimens are coarse and rather open in 
fleece, and others finer and more compact. From the 
Hampshire line of ancestry, it inherits tendency to dark 
or bluish skin and black spots and hairs in the fleece, 
which are very objectionable. However, it is being rapidly 
improved in these particulars. The Oxford Down has a
-P-A-G-E-381
THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 339 
very stately appearance and is a very attractive sheep. 
The color of face and legs is a darker brown than that of 
the Shropshire, but it is often flecked with gray, which 
may even predominate on the nose (Plate XII). 
The ewes are very prolific, probably more so than any 
other breed} even triplets being not uncommon. They 
are heavy milkers. The lambs grow very rapidly and 
are of good form, and the ewes yield large fleeces. The 
one shortcoming of the breed is that it does not seem hardy 
under American climatic conditions. It succumbs easily 
to invasions of internal parasites and to pulmonary dis- 
orders. 
393. Uses of Oxford sheep. —Oxfords are especially 
useful to produce mutton lambs to be marketed in the early 
summer, at four to five months of age. Under high feeding 
the ewes of many families will produce 150 per cent of lambs. 
The rams are well adapted for mating with smaller breeds 
for the production of lambs to be fattened at eight to ten 
months of age. There is a considerable demand for pure- 
bred rams for this purpose. Oxfords will yield about 10 
per cent more wool than Shropshires that is rather coarse 
in quality and of long staple. They produce longer and 
coarser wool than any other Down breed. 
394. Distribution. — This breed is found most largely 
in the states east of the Mississippi river and north of 
the Ohio river, and in Canada, appearing not to be suited 
to range conditions. It has spread from its original terri- 
tory in England to almost every country where other 
English breeds have gone, which includes most of the lead- 
ing live-stock countries. It is adapted to small farms 
where intensive methods are practiced. 
395. Organizations and records: + In 1881, the Ameri- 
can Oxford Down Record Association was organized, with 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
340 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
headquarters at Hamilton, Ohio. Thirteen volumes of 
the record have been issued, and over 70,000 animals re- 
corded. In England, the interests of the breed are in the 
hands of the Oxford Down Sheep Breeders’ Association. 
It has issued a flock-book each year since its inception in 
1888. 
HampsnireE Down Suerp. Plate XIII. 
By H. P. Miller 
396. The Hampshire breed derives its name from the 
county of that name in the south of England, one of the 
counties in which it was developed. It is a mutton breed. 
397. History in England.—The Hampshire Down 
sheep was produced by the use of the Southdown 
on the Wiltshire-horned and the Berkshire-knot sheep. 
The former was a white-faced race, and the latter 
black-faced. The Wiltshire was considered the largest 
_ of the native breeds. William Humphrey, of Newbury, 
Hampshire, who is accredited as being the first and great- 
est improver of the breed, assembled, about 1834, a flock 
of carefully selected ewes of what were then referred to in 
a general way as West-Country Downs, including the two 
above-mentioned local strains. He began his work of 
improvement by selection, but later became imbued with 
the idea that crossing would be advantageous, and in 
successive years purchased three Southdown rams from 
Jonas Webb. A little later, James Rawlence began im- 
provement of what was known as the Sussex sheep. He 
used some Hampshire and West-Country Down blood. 
Later, the two flocks were coalesced to form the Hampshire 
Down breed. Hampshires were first accorded a class at 
the Royal Agricultural Society Show in 1857.
-P-A-G-E-383
THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 341 
398. History in America.— Hampshire Down Sheep 
were imported into America in 1855 by Thomas Messenger 
of Long Island. No further importations are recorded 
until 1881. In that year, Henry Metcalf, of Canandaigua, 
New York, imported the ram, Shepherds’ Pride 2. In 
1883, the breed was introduced into Michigan, and in 
1885 into Ohio. 
399. Description. — The Hampshire is a black-faced 
breed, larger than the Shropshire, and is ranked by some 
persons as the largest of the Down breeds, although that 
distinction is generally accorded the Oxford. An average 
weight should be 250 pounds for mature rams, and 185 
to 195 for mature ewes (Plate XIII). 
It is the coarsest in bone and head of any of this group. 
Its fleece somewhat resembles that of the Southdown, 
although it is coarser and less dense. The breed ranks 
rather low in wool-production, the Suffolk only ranking 
lower. The wool is of about the same grade as that of 
the Shropshire, but shorter, and covering the body less 
completely. The face is inclined to be long, and the nose 
somewhat Roman in the rams. The ears are large and 
drooping, the face and legs are almost black, or a very 
dark brown. As compared with the Shropshire, it is 
somewhat longer in body and leg, and perhaps 10 per cent 
heavier. The ewes are prolific and heavy milkers. They 
strongly compete with the Shropshire in the production 
of twins. , 
400. Uses of Hampshire sheep. — The claim of the 
breed to superiority is based on the rapidity with which the 
lambs grow. In England, the flocks are generally folded, 
and the lambs fed for rapid development. It is not 
unusual for a Hampshire lamb to gain a pound a day. 
The breed ranks very well for mutton-production, es- 
 
-P-A-G-E-384

. 1 
842 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
pecially where early market lambs are wanted. In this 
country, Hampshire rams are especially prized for siring 
lambs to be marketed at three to five months of age. 
They are winning some favor on the range, as sires for 
mating with Merino grade ewes. The lambs are said to 
be good rustlers. Pure-breds will doubtless prove prof- 
. itable for the production of lambs to be marketed in the 
early spring or summer. But pure-bred flocks will be 
chiefly valuable in America for the supply of rams for 
cross-breeding. 
As has been said, for wool-production the Hampshire 
Down is very mediocre. The fleece is light, short and of 
rather inferior quality. 
401. Distribution. — This breed is now widely dis- 
seminated throughout the United States and Canada, 
especially in the eastern sections. It seems hardy and 
well adapted to American conditions, and is a good grazer. 
Tt has made its way throughout the southern counties of 
England, and into all the English colonies. It is now 
found in many countries, among which, aside from North 
America, including Mexico, may be named Russia, Ger- 
many, Portugal, Hungary, South Africa, Australia, New 
Zealand and several parts of South America, notably 
Argentina and Uruguay. 
402. Organizations and records.— The Hampshire 
Down Sheep Breeders’ Association was organized in Eng- 
land in 1889. The Hampshire Down Sheep Breeders’ 
Association of America was also organized in 1889, and 
has issued thirteen volumes of its flock-book in which 
the number of registrations is over 58,000.

403. Suffolk sheep get their name from the county of 
Suffolk, England, where the breed was originally developed. 
They are a short-wooled mutton breed. 
404. History in England. — The Suffolk is the modern 
representative of the old Norfolk breed, crossed with 
the Southdown. In some respects, the old Norfolk 
breed resembled the Black-faced Highland, having 
the same colored face and legs, with full bone, long 
spiral horns, long body, flat ribs, and rather narrow 
loins. It differed from the latter in having very fine 
short wool. The mutton was of that fine, rich flavor 
that is found in many semi-wild animals. The great 
value of the old breed was its mutton, which, when 
long kept, more closely resembled venison than that of 
any other breed. 
The Suffolk is the result of a cross between this old 
Norfolk breed and the Southdown, and shows what very 
important results may be achieved by able and enterprising 
breeders. The modern Suffolk is a conspicuous example of 
remarkable success in cross-breeding. By careful selection 
and management, the horns have disappeared. The 
Suffolk possesses excellent grazing qualities, and yields 
a carcass of lean, well-flavored mutton. Separate classes 
were first made for this breed at the Suffolk show in 1859, 
but it was not recognized by the Royal Agricultural Society 
until 1886. 
405. History in America. — The Suffolk may be con- 
sidered a recent introduction to America. In 1888, sheep 
of this breed were brought both to Canada and to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-386
344 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
United States, the importation to Canada having been 
made by B. D. Sewell, of New Brunswick, and that to 
the United States by M. B. Streeter of Brooklyn, New 
York. They were taken to Iowa in 1892, and have since 
been established elsewhere. 
406. Description. — The Suffolk is a large, rangy sheep, 
black-faced, hornless, with long, clean, black legs (Fig. 67). 
It resembles the Southdown 
in character and wool, but — 
is about one-third larger in 
body, and much longer in 
the leg. The wool is of 
good quality, of the clothing 
type, and the mutton is ex- 
cellent. It is a good feeder, 
and is reputed to be very 
prolific, yielding twins and triplets frequently. 
407. Uses of Suffolk sheep. — The Suffolk has a place 
as a mutton sheep, giving a large percentage of lean meat 
with a rich flavor. It is valuable for crossing purposes, to 
produce a quick-growing lamb of good quality, popular 
both with the butcher and with the consumer. The wool 
is well adapted for hosiery purposes, but is rather small 
in quantity. 
408. Distribution. — In England, the breed abounds in 
the counties of Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridge. It has 
been exported to the continent of Europe, to Holland, 
Germany, France, Spain, Saxony and elsewhere, where 
the rams are in demand to give a superior quality of mutton 
in their produce. It has been taken to South Africa, and 
Australia and New Zealand. It has been tried with success 
both in the United States and in Canada, but it is as yet 
relatively unimportant here:

409. Organizations and records. — The first English 
flock-book was published in 1886, by the Suffolk Down 
Sheep Society organized in that year. Some twenty vol- 
umes have been issued since. In America, the American 
Suffolk Flock Registry Association, organized in 1892, 
has issued the third volume of its flock-book. 
Dorset-Horn SHeep. Figs. 68, 69. 
By H. P. Miller 
410. The Dorset is an English breed that takes its name 
from the county in which it originated. It is a mutton 
breed, specially valuable for crossing to produce early 
lambs. It is characterized by gracefully curving horns 
in both male and female. 
411. History in England. — The Dorset is one of the 
oldest distinct breeds in England, no other race having 
been mingled with it originally, within the time of any 
records referring to it. It was first mentioned in 1707, 
when it was reported to have yeaned in December and 
againinJune. The two counties of Dorset and Somerset 
seem to have been the home of two races, differing some- 
what, which became mingled in the present Dorset. The 
original stock of Dorsetshire was small, light in the 
shoulders, with white face and legs and a black nose. Both 
males and females bore horns. The stock of Somerset 
was larger, coarser, longer-wooled, with flesh-colored nose 
and better form. The Dorset seems never to have had a 
devotee with the genius of Bakewell or Ellman, and at 
one time came near losing its identity through admixture 
of the improved breeds of the day. Its ability to produce 
lambs earlier than any other breed seems to have saved it.
-P-A-G-E-388
  346 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The Dorset was first recognized at the leading English 
shows in 1862. It has been greatly improved since that 
date; in fact, American breeders have greatly modified 
and unified the breed in the 
past quarter century. 
412. In America. — The 
introduction of Dorsets to 
America has been very recent. 
The first specimens were 
shown at the Chicago Fat 
Stock Show, in 1885. That 
same year an importation 
was made into Canada. In 
1887, A. Thayer, of Hoosic Falls, New York, and E. F. 
Bowditch, of Framingham, Massachusetts, made importa- 
tions. In 1889, T.S. Cooper, of Pennsylvania, imported 
153 head. They have not as yet gained the popularity in 
America that other English 
breeds have, and have had 
only a limited trial on the 
ranges. 
413. Description. — In 
form and fleece the Dorset- 
Horn closely resembles the 
Down breeds, but in some 
features presents strong con- 
trasts (Figs. 68, 69). Its face 
and legs are pure white, and the modern American type 
has a flesh-colored nose. Both sexes have horns, the rams 
very heavy ones that have a forward spiral curve. In size 
these sheep are between the Southdown and the Shrop- 
shire, the standard weight for rams being about 200 pounds 
and for ewes, 160 pounds. They generally are taller than 
  Fic. 68.— Dorset-Horn ram. 
  Fie. 69.— Dorset-Horn ewe.  
-P-A-G-E-389
THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 3847 
either of the above, but are not so uniform. In length, 
quality and quantity of fleece they are also between the 
above two breeds. Some of the breed early brought to 
America were excessively tall and inclined to be coarse. 
They were also quite bare of wool on legs and belly. The 
prevailing type at present approaches the Shropshire in 
form, although it is not so heavy in the breast and chest. 
It is now well covered over the body and legs to knees 
and hocks, and has a good foretop. There is still lack of 
uniformity, style and quantity of fleece. A somewhat 
common defect is a constricted heart-girth. The breed 
stands confinement well and is a good feeder. It is also 
prolific. 
414. Uses of Dorset-Horn sheep.— The strong recom- 
mendation of the breed in America, as in England, is for 
the production of hot-house or winter lambs. It will breed 
earlier than any other of the English breeds, and.the ewes, 
being heavy milkers, prepare their lambs for market in 
about ten weeks, so that they command a good price for 
mutton. Under high feeding they will produce lambs 
twice a year in some climates, but it has never proved 
expedient to have them do so. It is doubtful whether 
they have superior merit as a general farm sheep, but for 
the production of early market lambs they are especially 
suited. Rams of the breed are very satisfactory for use 
on grade Merino ewes in the production of feeders. The 
ewes are also bred to Shropshire or Southdown rams to 
produce market lambs. The mutton, except that of fat 
lambs, is not superior. 
For wool-production the Dorset-Horn has a rather in- 
ferior place. The wool is short, and still somewhat scant 
under the body. Ewes average about six pounds and rams. 
about seven pounds of wool of fair quality. The fleece  
-P-A-G-E-390
348 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
probably has the least oil of any of the middle-wool breeds, 
and is less dense. 
415. Distribution. — The principal flocks in America 
are to be found in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Indiana, 
Pennsylvania, Virginia and Canada, although the sheep 
are found in other states. A few have been taken to 
Australia and elsewhere, but they have not the wide 
dissemination of the other English breeds.. They are 
numerous in their native counties of Dorset and Somerset, 
in England, while very excellent flocks may be found on 
islands of Wight and Portland. 
416. Organization and records.— The American 
Dorset-Horn Sheep Breeders’ Association was organized in 
1891, and the Continental Dorset Club in 1897. The 
former issued two volumes of its flock-book bound together 
in 1894, and the latter has issued fourteen volumes, 
recording over 17,000 sheep. The Continental Dorset 
Club publishes a book on the breed entitled ‘‘ The Winter 
Lamb.” The Dorset-Horn Sheep Breeders’ Society of 
England was organized in 1891. 
Cueviot SHerep. Fig. 70. 
By David McCrae 
417. The Cheviot is one of the mountain breeds of 
Scotland, named after a range of grassy hills on the eastern 
borderland between England and Scotland. It is noted 
both for wool- and for mutton-production. 
418. History. —'The Cheviot has been bred for a very 
long period on the Scottish borders. The monks of 
the middle ages had the breed about the pasture lands of 
the old monasteries ; and to the sheep-farming church-men  
-P-A-G-E-391
  THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 349 
of Teviotdale are we indebted for the first improvements 
in the breed. The monks of Melrose had large flocks, 
which were dispersed in the border fields. It was not till 
about 1750 that the border farmer gave much attention 
to the breed or accomplished anything in its improvement. 
Cheviots were taken to Canada early in the nineteenth 
century. In 1838, Robert Young, of Delhi, New York, 
made an importation, followed four years later by other 
importations to the same county. In 1845, they were 
imported into Wisconsin by T. J. Carmichael. Subse- 
quent importations have been made, but the breed did 
not make much progress in America prior to 1880. 
419. Description. — The Cheviot is of medium size, 
hornless, face and legs white, the body closely covered 
with wool of a soft fiber akin 
to the Down wools; but un- 
like the Downs, which are 
always likely to have more 
or less of a gray tinge to the 
wool, the Cheviot gives a 
pure white wool (Fig. 70). 
The head is bold and broad, 
and the fleece of snowy white- 
ness comes close up, forming almost a ruff about the face. 
The ribs are flatter than in either the Southdown or the 
Highland. It is a very active, hardy animal, with a 
bright eye and erect ears. Unfortunately it has a tend- 
ency to scatter rather than flock together. 
420. Uses of Cheviot sheep. — The Cheviot is remark- 
ably hardy, and can live on very poor grazing; but, never- 
theless, it must have grass of some kind, and with it needs 
little else. It yields a good class of well-marbled mutton, 
that is not too fat and dresses a carcass of good weight.

| It bears traveling on foot for long distances better than 
| other modern breeds, and is exceedingly hardy. The ewes 
are good, careful mothers, and highly prolific. The 
Cheviot cannot be said to be superior as a wool-producer, 
owing to the light fleece, which, however, is of good quality, 
medium length and in demand. According to Wallace, 
an average clip for ewes is four and one-half to five pounds 
of washed wool. The tendency of American breeding 
. is to improve wool-production and more compact form. 
Cheviot ewes produce a good class of early maturing grade 
mutton sheep when crossed with Lincoln, Leicester or 
Oxford Down rams. These crosses have been popular in 
the native home of the breed for some years. 
421. Distribution. — In the Cheviot hills, the Cheviots 
are still the leading breed. About the year 1800, Sir 
John Sinclair tried them in Caithness shire, in the extreme 
north of Scotland, and they have spread into Sutherland- 
shire, where they are bred in large numbers. They have 
done well in many parts of the United States, but not so 
well in Canada, where the close confinement of the winters 
is against their active habits. Wherever they can have 
outdoor exercise all the year round, they are at home. 
They are specially adapted for high, grassy tablelands, 
and are most numerous in central and eastern United 
States, but have become very widely scattered throughout 
the country. 
' 422. Organization and records. —The Cheviot Sheep 
Society of Great Britain was organized in 1891, and has 
published a-volume of its flock-book for each year, Volume I 
having been issued in 1893. The American Cheviot 
Sheep Breeders’ Association was organized in 1891, at 
Hartwick, New York, and two years later issued its first 
flock-book. In 1894, the National Cheviot Sheep Society

Leicester SHEEP. Plate XIII. Fig. 71. 
By David McCrae 
423. The Leicester (pronounced Les’ter) sheep are a 
long-wool mutton breed, developed largely in the county 
of Leicester in England. The land in this county is fertile 
and rolling, and well adapted for sheep-raising. 
424. History in England. — The Leicester sheep are 
named from the county of Leicester (Les’ter) in England, 
where the breed had its origin. Robert Bakewell of Dishley 
near Loughborough in Leicestershire, began his sheep- 
breeding efforts about 1755. His object was to produce 
a breed that would fatten quickly at an early age. Before 
this, bulk of body and weight of fleece had been the aim 
of breeders of long-wools. The common sheep of the 
county at that time were large, heavy and coarse-wooled, 
white-faced, flat-sided, with large bones and long, thick, 
rough legs. Bakewell would never tell how he got his 
flock up to the excellence which later distinguished it, 
nor yet the breeds he used, but it is thought that the basis 
was the old Teeswater breed, modified by selections from 
the local breeds of long-wools in the district. This Tees- 
water breed, from the valley of the river Tees in Yorkshire, 
was a tall, clumsy animal, small in the bone, round in the 
rib, and with a thin fleece of long wool. It made good 
mutton, but was slow in maturing. Bakewell bred 
for mutton, with the least bone and the least waste, and 
es: 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
  352 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
for quick-feeding lambs. The breed was called the New 
Leicester or Dishley breed. Formed by careful selection 
and inbreeding, the new flocks had great prepotency, 
but were sometimes delicate in constitution and shy 
breeders. Even now, after 150 years, these features 
occasionally appear. 
The Dishley flock became famous. Bakewell decided 
to let his rams instead of selling them outright. In 1760, 
he let three rams for $4 each, and two for $4.50 each. 
The next year his price was $5 each, and this continued 
with varying success, until in 1780 he reached $50 for his 
best. Then the demand increased rapidly. In 1785, 
the top price was $500. In 1789, he let three rams for 
$6000, seven for $10,000, and the remainder of his flock 
for $15,000. His reputation was established, and the 
New Leicester became the most popular breed in England. 
It was much used for crossing with other breeds to produce 
quick-feeding lambs; and this reputation still holds. 
425. History in America. — Bakewell or Dishley sheep 
reached America in colonial days. It is said that George 
Washington had Bakewell ewes at Mount Vernon. Others 
were known in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. About the 
beginning of the nineteenth century, Mr. Toofy, of Quebec, 
made an importation. Later, about 1806, they were im- 
ported into Massachusetts. In the same year, Captain 
Beanes brought some rams and ewes from England, 
and placed them on a farm in New Jersey. The Beanes 
flock subsequently, in the hands of others, attained much 
notoriety. A number of importations were made later, 
and gradually the breed worked westward. 
In America, a type has been developed that differs 
somewhat from both the English Leicester and the Border 
Leicester, both of which types have been used in many  
-P-A-G-E-397
  THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 353 
of the flocks in Canada and the United States. Some 
owners assert that the modern American Leicester is a 
better sheep than either of the English types, and that this 
is the only English breed of sheep that has been improved 
in America. Certainly the modern American Leicester is a 
fine sheep, evenly developed, and when in good form is 
a beautiful animal. 
426. Description. — The Leicesters are a hornless breed 
of sheep, of large size, rec- 
tangular form of body on 
clean legs, and with bare 
faces or carrying a very 
scant topknot. (Fig. 71. 
Plate XIII.) 
There are two types in 
the breed, the English or 
Bakewell, and the Border 
Leicesters, and these vary somewhat in form and details. 
Both types are recognized by all Leicester associations. 
427. Types. — The Dishley or Bakewell type became 
widely used in England, and has become known as the 
English Leicester. Because of its great prepotency and 
its quality of putting on fat quickly, it became popular 
as the greatest of all the mutton breeds for crossing pur- 
~ poses and for early market lambs. 
The Border Leicester is so named because it is bred in 
the border counties of England and Scotland, Roxborough- 
shire in Scotland being now the headquarters of the breed. 
George Culley, of Denton, near Darlington in Durham, 
. and his brother are looked on as the original breeders of 
the Border Leicester. The Culleys hired rams from Dish- 
ley and crossed them on a stock of Teeswater ewes till 
they had a flock of Leicesters. When they retired in

354 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
1806, their flock, through that of Compton of Learmouth, 
supplied a part of the Mertoun flock of Lord Polworth. 
This flock has been bred with the greatest care since 1802, 
and by judicious selection and without outside blood has 
been made the premier flock of the breed. 
The Border breed has a white face, free from wool. The 
English Leicester may have a small tuft, and may be 
bluish white in color. At one time, blue faces. were in 
fashion. The head and eye are important points in a 
quick-feeding animal. “ Never pick a rascally head and 
a bad eye,” no matter what the carcass may be, is the ad- 
vice of a famous breeder. 
428. Uses of Leicester sheep.— The Leicesters are 
used very much for crossing purposes, to get early lambs 
for the market. Having been bred more for mutton than 
for wool, the breed has so far not been so widely distributed 
in America as its good qualities deserve. Of late years, 
however, the market for fat lambs has become a feature, 
and there is now more demand for the Leicester for cross- 
breeding. For mutton alone, the breed is inferior. It is 
too large and too fat, unless killed young. The cross-bred 
mutton on Hampshires or Merinos is superior to the pure- 
bred. The Border Leicester-Cheviot cross has found 
much favor for the production of choice mutton for the 
British market. : ‘ t 
The wool of the Leicester is fine and long, and the fleeces 
will weigh nine to eleven pounds. Fine-wool rams on 
grade Leicester ewes produce a fine, compact fleece that is 
heavier than that of the Leicester pure-bred. 
For grazing, the Leicester is in no way superior. It is 
not specially hardy, and cannot rustle sufficiently well to 
adapt it to much of the range lands. 
429. Distribution. — The Leicesters are at home in  
-P-A-G-E-399
THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 855 
the border counties of England and Scotland, and in other 
parts of Great Britain. While tried to some extent 
abroad, notably in part of Europe, New Zealand, Australia 
and America, they have not attained the reputation of 
the heavier-wooled breeds. In America they are found 
mainly in Ontario and other Canadian provinces, and in 
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska. 
430. Organizations and records. — The first organiza- 
tion devoted to the Leicester was the Dishley Society, 
which was formed to sustain the efforts of Bakewell. This 
society has been succeeded by the Leicester Sheep Breeders 
Society. In England there is also the Society of Border 
Leicester Sheep Breeders. The American Leicester 
Breeders’ Association has issued eight volumes of its flock- 
book, since its organization in 1888, recording over 16,000 
sheep.

431. This breed is of large size, with a heavy fleece 
of long, wavy or curly wool and a moderate tuft of wool on 
the face. 
432. History. — On the eastern coast of England lies 
the county of Lincoln, which contains a large tract of 
fen or marsh land, lying exposed to the North sea and very 
little above it. On this flat fen land has been bred a race 
of sheep which takes its name from the county, and which 
has made for itself a world-wide reputation. In olden 
times, the sheep raised on the fens of Lincolnshire were 
remarkable for large size and for length of wool. They 
had also large limbs, big hoofs, hollow flanks and flat 
sides. We know little about the origin of the old Lincoln 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
356 | THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
breed. Ellis, who published his “ Shepherd’s Guide ” 
in 1749, is the first to mention them as an established 
breed in the fens of Lincoln. He says that they were 
“the longest legged and largest carcassed sheep of all 
others; and although their legs and bellies were for the 
most part void of wool, yet they carried more wool on 
them than any sheep whatsoever.” The modern Lincoln 
is said to be the product of a Leicester cross on the old 
Lincoln. It is a fine representative of the long-wool 
sheep, and yields a very heavy fleece of combing wool. 
Lincolns were first brought to New England about the 
close of the eighteenth century. In 1825 an importation 
was made to Massachusetts by A. A. Lawrence. In 1834 
they reached Ohio. An importation was made to New 
York in 1836 by L. D. Clift. Since that time importa- 
tions have been made to both Canada and the United 
States. The breed has not been popular in this country. 
433. Families.— Mention should be made of two 
notable flocks. One of the leading flocks in England is 
that of Henry Dudding, Riby Grove, Great Grimsby, Lin- 
colnshire. It is a very large flock and has been bred care- 
fully for about one hundred and fifty years. Rams from 
this flock have sold for $5000 each. In 1907, forty-eight 
rams averaged $450. Another flock which has a notable 
record is that of J. E. Caswell, Laughton, Folkingham. 
484. Description.— For many years, the fleece has 
been made a leading feature of the Lincoln breed. The 
wool is long, somewhat lustrous and of a strong and sound 
combing quality. For length of fiber and strength of 
staple, no other breed but the Cotswold can rival the Lin- 
coln. The color is white. The head is large, and without 
horns. The sheep gives the impression of massiveness. 
It is gentle, a good feeder, matures early, and has fair  
-P-A-G-E-401
  THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 357 
grazing qualities, but cannot be said to be very prolific. 
(Plate XIII.) 
435. Uses of Lincoln sheep.— The Lincoln is bred 
for wool, and its reputation has been made from the fleece. 
Lincolnshire has an area of about twenty-seven hundred 
square miles, and its annual wool clip exceeds nine million 
pounds of washed wool. For many centuries this wool 
has had a reputation for strong, tough fiber, the fen wool 
especially having this marked toughness. It is said 
by many persons that the breed removed from its 
native fen land loses the tough, strong quality of fiber, 
no matter how good the pasture may be to which it is re- 
moved. Eighteen pounds of wool for mature rams, and 
fourteen to sixteen for mature ewes may be considered 
average yields. 
The Lincoln has been widely used, especially in New 
Zealand, for crossing on Merino stock to give a long 
combing wool. It impresses its long-wool qualities on 
its offspring. This cross is also much employed in Ar- 
gentina and Australia, to produce large wool sheep, and 
incidentally mutton, for the English market. The pure- 
bred Lincoln is not popular for mutton purposes, as it is 
too fat, and the mutton is of inferior quality. 
436. Distribution. — Lincoln sheep are still largely bred 
in their old home in Lincolnshire and neighboring counties 
in England. In Australia and New Zealand they are 
favorites for crossing purposes, and they have also reached 
Russia and South Africa. In South America they are 
popular, and very high prices have been paid for export 
rams to go to Argentina, but in North America they have 
not gained the same favor. There are a few good flocks in 
Canada, mainly in Ontario, and some have been tried on 
western ranches with more or less success,

437. ee and records. — The National Lin- 
coln Sheep Breeders’ Association of America, organized 
in 1891, looks after the interests of the breed in this 
country. It has published two flock-books. In England 
there is the Lincoln Long-Wool Sheep Breeders’ Associa- 
tion, organized in 1892. It issues a volume of its flock- 
book each year.

438. The Cotswold is a breed of sheep raised both for 
wool and for mutton. It is of large size, capable of 
_ enduring much hardship and exposure, and well adapted 
to many soils. The name is derived from a range of 
bleak uplands in Gloucestershire, England, known as 
Cotswold hills. , 
439. History in England. — The Cotswold is an old 
English breed, whose antiquity is undoubted. It is one 
of the earliest sheep mentioned by name in Anglo-Saxon 
records. In the time of the Roman conquests, the region 
from which these sheep came is said to have been famous 
for the production of wool. Low suggests that the Cots- 
wold was developed from the sheep found in the counties 
of Warwick and Oxford at an early period. The modern 
Cotswold is not so large nor so high-standing as was the 
older breed, but has more style, being remarkable for 
symmetry, early maturity and weight, with a lofty car- 
riage, a fine, well-covered head, and an abundant fleece of 
white, wavy wool. Much of this improvement is ascribed 
to the use of Leicester rams on Cotswold ewes, a practice 
very common about the beginning of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. ° 
     
-P-A-G-E-403
  THE MUTTON BREEDS OF SHEEP 859 
The type of the breed has been well maintained by the 
English breeders, and the flocks of the various breeders 
now show a uniformity that is very desirable. Garne 
of North Leach, Hugh Aylmer of Norfolk, Gillett of 
Chalsbury and Swannock of Cidencester were notable 
breeders who had flocks of good type. 
440. History in America.— We have a record of an 
importation of Cotswold sheep by Christopher Dunn, of 
Albany, New York, in 1832. Doubtless there had been 
previous importations, for even at that date sheep of this 
type were rather common in New York. In 1834, Isaac 
Maynard took a small flock into Ohio. In 1837 they 
reached Kentucky, where they later became very popular. 
In 1840, Erastus Corning, also of Albany, brought over a 
select lot; and W. H. Sotham made an importation of 
. nineteen about the same time. In 1854, George Miller, 
of Markham, Canada, brought over thirty head, and these 
were shown at the Provincial Fair. In Quebec Province, 
A. H. Torrance, of Montreal, and J. L. Gibb Comptom had 
good flocks, from which they sold into Maine, Massa- 
chusetts and Vermont. Beginning about 1870, with the 
decreasing popularity of Merinos, the Cotswold ex- 
perienced an increasing demand, and many flocks were 
established, especially in central United States. 
441. Description. — The Cotswold is a large, high-stand- 
ing sheep, with heavy fleece of long, white, lustrous wool. 
A mature ram should weigh 250 pounds or more, and a 
mature ewe 200 pounds at least. An ample topknot, 
often covering the eyes, is one of the distinguishing charac- 
teristics of the breed. It is uniform in type, with bold, 
upright carriage, broad back, and shows a fair leg of 
mutton. (Plate XIII.) It is a superior feeder, specially 
well adapted to good pasture land, and fairly prolific.
-P-A-G-E-404
860 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
442. Uses of Cotswold sheep. — The Cotswold is a 
fair mutton sheep, giving a big carcass of strong mut- 
ton, very popular in the mining districts of England. 
It has not been so popular in America for mutton, 
except the lambs. The abundance of external fat is 
against it. In America it has been used for crossing 
on Merino and native sheep, the produce being a 
lamb of the mutton type, quick-feeding and hardy, 
weighing 120 to 140 pounds at a year old and carry- 
ing fair fleece. For wool, the breed has always been 
celebrated, giving a heavy fleece of strong combing 
wool, weighing sixteen to eighteen pounds per fleece 
in the best specimens. The staple should average ten 
inches in length, and frequently exceeds this. The half- 
bred lambs yield a large fleece, giving much profit to 
the wool-grower. 
443. Distribution. — The Cotswold has become wide- 
spread in America. The largest number of breeders are 
in Ontario, although there are many flocks in the other 
provinces of Canada. In New York, there are good flocks. 
Going westward, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa 
and Wisconsin stand in the order named for number of 
breeders, but all are exceeded by Oregon, which has the 
largest number of any state in the Union. There are 
large flocks in Utah, and many half-breeds in Montana 
and other sections of the West. Kentucky at one time 
had large flocks, and the blood there is still in evidence, 
but they have not been kept on record. In England, the 
Cotswold is most popular in its native county of Gloucester 
and neighboring counties. It has been exported to Russia, 
Germany and France, on the continent, and to Australia 
and New Zealand, as well as to many parts of North 
America.

            444, Organizations and records. — In 1878, the Ameri- 
can Cotswold Sheep Association was formed to keep the 
record of the breed. Seventeen volumes of the record 
have been issued, with over eighty thousand animals 
recorded. The list of breeders is steadily increasing. 
The present headquarters of the association are at Wau- 
kesha, Wisconsin. The English representative of this 
breed is the Cotswold Sheep Society of England, organ- 
ized in 1892. It also publishes a flock-book.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE WOOL BREEDS OF SHEEP 
Turse breeds are all derivates or subdivisions of the 
great Merino group, so that wool and Merino are synon- 
ymous. The wool type bears much the same relation to 
the mutton type of sheep that the dairy type bears to 
the beef type of cattle. Their form is of less scale, more 
angular, narrower, with lighter quarters, and the sheep 
are slower maturing and yield a carcass deficient in flesh- 
ing and finish. On the other hand, they produce fleeces 
of the’ finest staple and in greatest quantity. 
Merino SHeep. Plate XIV. 
By Joseph E. Wing 
445. Of the Merinos there are several families, all of 
which are characterized by the production of fine fleece. 
The name “ Merino” comes from Spain and has been 
variously explained. 
446. History in Spain. — Merino sheep are native of 
Spain. The land is of variable topography, there being” 
wide, dry plains, high, cool mountains and tablelands and 
well-watered valleys. 
As to the origin of the Merino, little is rae Pro- 
fessor Low says that the sheep of Spain came originally 
from Phcenicia and Carthage, introduced by the Car- 
362  
-P-A-G-E-407
  
THE WOOL BREEDS OF SHEEP 363 
thaginians and the Moors, and from Italy. At the be- 
ginning of the Christian era, historians related that the 
sheep of Spain had a superior fleece. When in the eighth 
century the Moors took possession of Spain, they intro- 
duced the manufacture of fine fabrics, and the sheep of 
Spain furnished the wool. It seems probable that the 
development of the Merino as a bearer of fine wool was 
begun at a date prior to the beginning of the Christian 
era. 
Sheep in Spain have long been nomadic, spending the 
summers in the highlands and the winters on the low 
plains. The annual movement of these millions of sheep 
was a notable event. In this connection it is interesting 
to note that the sheep were divided into two great groups 
as related to these drives. One group known as Estantes, 
was stationary on the farms,.and was composed of sheep 
of fairly large size, with wool somewhat coarser than that 
of the other type, less exposed, perhaps, to the rigors of 
climate. The second great group, known as Trans- 
humantes, was made up of the migratory sheep that 
constituted the drives. These were subdivided into 
flocks or “squads” of manageable size for the move- 
ments. ~ 
447. History in America. — Successful importation of 
Merinos: to America began in 1801, when Seth Adams 
brought a pair to Massachusetts. In the same year, M. 
Dupont de Nemours is said to have imported one Merino 
ram, which had considerable influence on certain flocks 
in New York and other eastern states. In 1807, Seth 
Adams removed to Ohio, taking with him his Merinos, 
now considerably increased. In 1802, Colonel David 
Humphrey imported from Spain to Connecticut ninety- 
three Merinos, chiefly ewes. The good quality of these
-P-A-G-E-408
364 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
early importations attracted considerable attention among 
sheep-men, which resulted in increased importations. 
One of the most influential of these early importers was 
Robert Livingston, who made his first importation in 
1802. By his writings and by his political influence he 
advanced the interest in Merinos very greatly. Another 
prominent importer was William Jarvis, of Vermont, then 
the United States consul at Lisbon. Mr. Jarvis sent to 
this country a total of about four thousand head, which 
were widely distributed through the East. All of these 
sheep were of superior breeding, and included representa- 
tives from the families of Paular, Escurial, Aguirre, Ne- 
grette, and Montarcos. From this time for many years 
Merinos were on the crest of popularity, and prices ruled 
very high. Plumb states that “ it is estimated that from 
April 1, 1810, to August 31, 1811, there were brought to 
the United States 19,651 Merino sheep.” Most of the 
sheep imported from Spain were of the great migratory 
group. 
Merinos in America are now grouped in three great 
families, designated as the American Merino, the Delaine 
and the Rambouillet. 
448. Families.— The principal families represented 
in the American importatioris, and hence the progenitors 
of our modern American Merinos, were as follows: 
Paular Merinos.—'The Paulars were owned by the 
Carthusian friars of Paular. These friars had one of 
the handsomest flocks in Spain, with soft, silky, close and 
compact wool, carrying less surface yolk than some other 
types. The Paular lambs were hairy at birth. The 
Paular subtype of the American Merino i is a well-estab- 
lished strain. 
ioaete Merinos. — These were very well-comardill  
-P-A-G-E-409
THE WOOL BREEDS OF SHEEP 365 
sheep, with much wool about the face, and a dense, much 
crimped fleece. The sheep had round, broad_ bodies, 
short legs, and much loose skin in folds and wrinkles. 
Atwood Merinos.—The famed Atwood family of 
Merinos, so popular the latter half of the past century, 
was formed by mating Infantados with Paulars, which 
much improved the type of sheep and the fleece. They 
were characterized by many folds. 
The Escurial Merinos were nearly as tall as the Paulars 
but were slighter in build. Their wool was crimped and 
not so thick as the Paular wool. 
Guadalupe Merinos. —'These were heavier in bone than 
the Negrettes and were celebrated for both the quality 
and the quantity of their wool. Their fleeces were thick 
and crimped, and more oily than the Negrettes. 
Negrette Merinos.— The Negrette Merinos were the 
largest and strongest of the traveling sheep of Spain. 
The fleeces were shorter than those of the Paulars. They 
were wooled on the face and to the hoofs. They were 
all loose skinned, with heavy dewlaps, and the rams 
carried large horns. 
Infantado Merinos were bred by the Duke of Infantado 
and were very superior sheep. Their horns came close 
to the sides of their heads, while those of the Paulars and 
Negrettes stood out. Many Infantados were brought to 
America, notably by Colonel Humphrey. 
In this connection, mention should be made of some 
of the families of Merinos that have been built up in Euro- 
pean countries on foundation stock imported from Spain. 
Notable among these families are the Saxon, Silesian or 
German, Australian, French (Rambouillet) and Swedish. 
Saxon Merino.— From the Escurial flocks of Spain, 
about three hundred Merinos were sent, in 1765, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-410
  366 THE BREEDS OF EO 
Saxony. These were naturally among the finest wooled 
of Merinos, and in their new home more attention was 
paid to this quality; so much attention, in fact, that the 
sheep themselves lost stamina and hardiness and. became 
very delicate and hard to raise. The wool of these sheep, — 
however, is of extraordinary fineness and beauty. They 
yield about two to three pounds of washed wool per 
head. There are not many breeders of pure Saxon sheep 
in America, although they have been bred to some extent 
in western Pennsylvania and Virginia. This family is 
now almost extinct. 
Silesian, or German Merino. —'This breed was -estab- ~ 
lished in Silesia by an importation of Infantado and 
Negrette Merinos in 1811, although importations had 
been made earlier with some success, notably those of 
Von Vinke in 1768 and 1778. Since that day they have 
been bred pure, principally on the estate of Ferdinand 
Fischer of Wirchenblatt. For many years a careful 
record of each sheep has been kept on this estate. Sile- 
sian ewes shear eight to eleven pounds of unwashed wool, 
the rams twelve to sixteen pounds. The wool is. two to 
three inches long, dark on the outside, not gummy, 
but with a white, clear oil. The ewes weigh 110 to 130 
pounds and the rams 145 to 155 pounds. There have 
been many Silesians imported into America. Mr. Wm. 
Chamberlin, of New York, imported 246 head between 
1851 and 1856. It is probable that at this day’ most 
Silesians in America have become merged with one or 
the other of the larger Merino families. 
Australian Merino. — As has been said, the Merino is 
the leading sheep in Australia, which places Australia at 
the head of the list of Merino sheep-producing countries. 
Taken to New South Wales in 1797, the sheep found the

   THE WOOL BREEDS OF SHEEP 367 
hot, dry ranges well suited to their needs, and to the 
production of a high grade of wool. 
449.. Description. — The distinguishing characteristic 
of the Merino is its covering, which is of very fine wool, 
usually delicately crimped. This wool is generally short, 
ranging from an inch or less to four inches, and sometimes 
to a greater length. It is dense, that is, there are a great 
number of wool fibers to the square inch of skin. A 
Merino will carry 40,000 to 48,000 fibers to the square 
inch. Wool normally grows over the Merino to the tips 
of the ears and to the hoofs of the feet. In the Merino 
is seen the greatest development of wool in proportion to 
carcass of any breed. In Spain, the best rams of the early 
days are reported to have yielded about 6 to 8 per cent 
of their weight in wool, while in America, in about 1844, 
the yield had increased to 15 per cent. This, of course, 
is unwashed wool. The appearance of the Merino is not 
very pleasing. The form, seen when shorn, is usually 
angular, the shoulders oftén narrow, the back not usually 
so straight or strong as in some English breeds, the legs 
less straight and often of greater length, the neck more 
slender. The Merino ram usually has horns, giving the 
appearance of masculine vigor. The appearance of weak- 
ness in the Merino is hardly borne out by its behavior. 
It is very enduring and resistant, withstanding storm, 
cold and starvation better than most sheep, and its vital 
force is very strong. 
450. Uses of Merino sheep. — Merino sheep are kept 
primarily for their wool. It is true that, after they have | 
served their time for this purpose, they are commonly 
fattened and made into mutton, yet the fleece is usually 
the first consideration with the Merino flockmaster. 
Much attention is paid to the quantity and quality of 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
368 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
wool borne by these sheep. In some families of Merinos, 
the body surface is increased by folds inkles on the 
skin, which increase the Piubele! surlace. These 
folds are especially pronounced about the neck, and 
sometimes make huge “ collars.” 
451. The wool. — Merino wool is most esteemed when 
it is fine. The diameter of a fiber of Merino wool varies 
from yoyo to revo of an inch, while the fibers of the English 
breeds vary from 375 of an inch for an Oxford Down, to 
sts of an inch for a Southdown. It should also have a 
short crimp throughout its entire length, and should be 
strong, silky and well supplied with white oil. This oil 
protects the wool fibers, but at the outer ends it collects 
dust and gives the coat a dark and uninviting appearance, 
which is dispelled when the wool is opened and the beauti- 
ful white and glistening interior is viewed. 
The density of the wool is an essential factor, since on 
that depends the weight of the scoured fleece. Sufficient 
oil to protect the fleece is essential, but a surface of 
grease is unnecessary, and in recent years has been 
recognized as undesirable. During the so-called Merino 
craze that existed in America soon after the Civil War, 
the aim was to get as heavy a fleece as possible, and 
many breeders unwisely sought to attain this result 
by breeding sheep with very greasy wool. It was 
learned, however, that this only enfeebled the sheep 
without bringing any sufficient compensation, and in 
recent years breeders have sought to produce animals 
bearing only sufficient oil to protect the fleece well. 
The amount of oil carried by Merino fleeces varies 
with the different families, the American or Spanish types 
having most and the Rambouillet perhaps the least oil. 
Merino fleeces have been grown so heavy with oil that
-P-A-G-E-415
THE WOOL BREEDS OF SHEEP 869 
they scoured out no more than 12 per cent of clean wool; 
others have made 40 per cent. Perhaps an average yield 
of clean wool would be about 30 per cent of the weight of 
the fleece as shorn. A good ewe should shear fifteen 
pounds and a ram twenty to twenty-four pounds of wool. 
Individual records may far exceed this. 
452. Distribution. — The Merino has become very 
widespread, and is now found in all civilized countries 
where flocks are kept, although it cannot be said to 
be universally popular or successful. It originated in a 
warm climate. It has shown ability to withstand hot 
weather and tropical climates, so long as they are dry. By 
far the greater part of the sheep of Australia are Merinos. 
It has also been important in New Zealand and Argentina. 
The Merino thrives in Vermont, New York, Ohio, and 
other north-central states, in Texas, and all the states of 
the West, where it constitutes by far the majority of the 
range flocks. It has never been popular in Canada, and 
is not raised in England. 
AMERICAN MERINO SHEEP. Figs. 72, 73. 
453. The American Merino was developed from the 
Spanish Merino, the blood of several different families 
having been interbred. In recent years, the Delaine and 
Rambouillet types of Merinos have become more popular 
in America than the American Merino, owing to their 
better form and ability to fatten, and the high prices 
prevailing for mutton. 
454. Description. — The head of a typical American 
Merino is small, broad and short, the rams carrying heavy, 
spirally-twisted horns, and the ewes being hornless. 
The form of the American Merino is somewhat delicate. 
2B
-P-A-G-E-416
370 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The skin is of the most attractive pink. The prevailing 
‘fashion is to have three to five heavy folds on the neck, 
large on the under side, but not on the upper side; 
two or three short folds on 
and immediately back of 
each elbow or arm; fine, 
thick wrinkles running down 
the sides, but not extending 
over the back. Wrinkles 
the hips, sometimes from 
the tail in the direction of 
the stifle and sometimes at 
right angles with them. Folds may occur around the tail 
to give it a wide appearance, and also across the thigh, 
with a deep flank. The fleece 
covers the entire sheep, 
except the tip of the nose 
and the hoofs. Usually the 
eyes are hidden by wool. 
The outside of the fleece is a 
dirty brown, but inside it is 
white and glistening. The 
one-year-old fleece will show 
a length of about two and 
one-half inches. The size of 
the American Merino varies 
much. Ewes may weigh 80 or 100 pounds, rams 100 or 
175 pounds. (Figs. 72, 73.) 
The American Merino does not reach maturity until 
between three and four years of age, and in this respect 
ranks below other breeds. It is characterized, however, 
by longevity.

455. Uses of American Merino sheep. — American 
Merinos surpass all others in the production of a fine, strong 
and heavy fleece. Mature ewes frequently shear twelve 
to fifteen pounds, and rams should attain to twenty pounds. 
Plumb, quoting from a Vermont report, says that in 1812, 
the best rams in Vermont produced but 6 per cent of wool 
to weight of body. In 1844, the wool had increased to 
15 per cent, in 1865 to 21 per cent and in 1880 to 36 per 
cent, showing a very notable increase in the production of 
wool. Unfortunately we do not know what the increase 
in per cent ‘of scoured wool has been. 
The American Merino does not usually fatten so readily 
as other types of the Merino; and when compared with 
the mutton breeds it is inferior. 
In the West, the American Merino was largely instru- 
mental in transforming the coarse and _ thin-wooled 
Mexican ewe into one of far better and heavier fleece, 
with also better form and increased hardiness. The 
American Merino has been much used for crossing in 
this country and others, and the result is invariably an 
improvement in wool-production in the grade over its 
other parent. Merino ewes are crossed with some of 
the middle-wool breeds to produce a good market mutton 
sheep, yielding a somewhat smaller clip of wool. 
456. Distribution. — In America, the American Me- 
rino is widely scattered, and does well under very diverse 
conditions. It is hardy and active, and can glean a living 
under unfavorable conditions. It has been largely ex- 
ported to Australia and Africa. In Australia, Merinos 
are bred pure. In New Zealand, they are largely inter- 
mixed with sheep of mutton type. 
457. Organizations and records. —The Merino has 
suffered from an overabundance of distinct organiza-
-P-A-G-E-418
372 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
tions devoted to its interests, and the absence of one 
centralized and directing body. It was not until 1906 that 
any success was attained toward the formation of such a 
national society. In that year, the American and De- 
laine Merino Record Association was formed, by the 
union of the International Delaine, Standard Delaine, 
and Improved Spanish Delaine Merino Sheep Breeders’ 
Associations. Among nearly a score of associations giv- 
ing attention to Merino sheep may be mentioned the 
following, which are concerned especially with the Ameri- 
can Merino: The Vermont Merino Sheep Breeders’ 
Association, United States Merino Sheep Breeders’ 
Association, American Merino Sheep Register Associa- 
tion, Ohio Spanish Merino Sheep Breeders’ Association, 
New York State American Merino Sheep Breeders’ Asso- 
ciation, Michigan Merino Sheep Breeders’ Association, 
Missouri Merino Sheep Breeders’ Association, National 
Merino Sheep Register Association, Standard American 
Merino Sheep Breeders’ Association. Many of these 
associations issue flock-books, and employ a score-card for 
judging purposes. 
Detaine Merino SHeep. Fig. 74. 
458. The word Delaine means “ of wool,” and is from 
the French. Delaine wool can be combed and spun 
with the fibers of full length, making a fabric of great 
strength and durability. The Delaine type, of several 
families, has been developed from importations of Spanish 
Merinos, by selections from several different flocks as 
noted in the following paragraphs. 
459. Families. — The Dickinson Delaines were devel- 
oped from sheep of the Humphrey importation of 1802,
-P-A-G-E-419
THE WOOL BREEDS OF SHEEP 373 
mentioned above, by William R. Dickinson of Ohio, who 
began his improvement of Merino sheep in 1809. James 
McDowell became possessed of some of the Dickinson 
flock and created the McDowell strain of Dickinsons. 
The standard of excellence for Dickinson Delaines says 
that the sheep shall have a deep, round, wide and long 
Lbody, showing mutton capacity, carrying heavy, thick 
flesh, the top- and under-lines straight, the skin smooth 
and pink and well filled out, being free from folds. The 
head may have small horns, but a polled head is pre- 
ferred. The fleece should be three to five inches long, of 
a quality to grade XX or XXX fine Delaine combing. 
Rams should shear fifteen to twenty-five pounds and ewes 
ten to fifteen pounds of unwashed wool. Mature rams 
should weigh 200 pounds, and mature ewes 150 pounds. 
The National Delaines are descended from an impor- 
tation of Merinos, made by R. W. Meade, in 1820. Alex. 
Reed, of Washington county, Pennsylvania, came into 
possession of a number of this importation the year fol- 
lowing, and his flock may be considered the foundation 
of the Delaine type. Many of the Reed flock were sold 
to other breeders in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, 
who developed the type, perhaps more than Reed had 
done. This type is not very different from the Dickinson. 
It has the smooth body, characteristic of the Delaine, 
«almost free from folds. It does not seem to be desirable 
to dispense with folds altogether, as they appear to be 
associated with density and weight of wool. This 
family does not attain so large size as the Dickinson, 
running perhaps fifty pounds less for both male and 
female. The staple should reach three inches in a year, 
and the fleece should weigh up to nine pounds and be 
comparatively free from oil.
-P-A-G-E-420
  3874 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The Victor Beall strain of this family is the result of a 
cross of Spanish and Black-top Merino blood. About 
1877, a Spanish ram, named Victor, was used in the flock 
of Black-top Merinos owned by R. H. Russell. Fifteen 
years before, a ram of Spanish and Black-top blood, pur- 
chased from the flock of C. H. Beall, of West Virginia, 
had been used on some of the Reed flock, then in the 
hands of McClelland Brothers. The offspring of the de- 
scendants of these two rams were very superior, and the 
strain came to be known as Victor-Beall Delaine Merino. 
The Black-top Spanish Merino.—In 1821, William 
Berry of Washington county, Pennsylvania, purchased 
some ewes and a ram of Mr. Dickinson, which he bred 
very carefully. He was impressed that the sheep having 
the darkest appearance or “top ”’ were the hardiest and 
best feeders. By selecting along these lines, he developed 
a family that he called Black-top. It differs in no mate- 
rial way from the other families, the size being perhaps a 
little greater and the fleece a little heavier. The wool is 
not so much laid on over the head and has a darker ap- 
pearance on the outside. The staple should reach a 
length of three to four inches, and the rams should yield 
thirteen to fourteen pounds, the ewes seven to twelve 
pounds of brook-washed wool. Black-top rams are 
horned, while the ewes have smooth heads. The form 
in general is of the mutton type. 
The Improved Black-top Merino also had its origin 
in Washington county, Pennsylvania, in the hands of 
George Black. Beginning about 1853, and continuing 
for many years, Robert Johnston, also of Washington 
county, used only Black-top rams on his ewes, many of 
his rams coming from the Berry flock. His ewes traced 
to the Dickinson flock. In 1850, Black came into posses-
-P-A-G-E-421
  THE WOOL BREEDS OF SHEEP 875 
sion of twenty-five Black-top ewes, that traced to the 
Dickinson flock. On these he used rams of Berry and 
Johnston breeding, and from this foundation developed 
the Improved Black-top Delaine, the word “ improved ” 
being used because the advocates considered this family 
superior to the Black-top Spanish. 
460. Description.— Delaine sheep have smoother 
bodies than the American Merinos, with fewer folds and 
wrinkles, sometimes with none. They vary considerably 
in type, according to the individual ideals of their. many 
breeders. They are larger 
and heavier than American 
Merinos and fatten more 
readily. The weight of 
matured rams may be given 
as 140 to 200 pounds, and 
of ewes as 100 to 150 
pounds (Fig. 74). Their 
breeders have striven to 
combine mutton qualities, 
to some extent, with the production of a fine fleece. The 
breeders avail themselves rather freely of whatever Merino 
blood they fancy will improve their type. Thus, when 
the flock is losing in weight of fleece, they sometimes 
resort to the use of American Merino rams to thicken the 
fleece and make it heavier, or to Rambouillet rams to 
increase the size. The important item sought is to keep 
good size and mutton quality, while furnishing fleece of 
good length and staple, grading XX or better. 
461. Uses of Delaine Merino sheep. — The Dolaing 
Merinos bear wool a little longer and coarser in fiber than 
the American Merinos, with a little less crimp and less 
oil, and with stronger fibers well adapted to carding. 
  Fic. 74.— Delaine Merino ram. 
 
-P-A-G-E-422
  376 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The fleece in-a well-kept matured ram should average 
twelve to eighteen pounds and in the matured ewe about 
nine to fifteen pounds. 
Much may be said in praise of the quality of Delaine 
mutton. It easily leads in the Merino families. The 
wethers mature rather quickly, and sell at a good price. 
The Delaine Merino has been used to good advantage 
in crossing to produce better shearing qualities without 
detriment to the mutton qualities. This result has fre- 
quently been secured on the western ranges. 
462. Distribution. — Among breeds of Merinos, the 
Delaine is growing in popularity. It is found in New 
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and in ad- 
joining states. For use on the ranges, the Delaines are 
finding increasing favor, especially where the pasturage 
is good. The Black-top Spanish Merino is especially 
numerous in parts of Pennsylvania where it was devel- 
oped. They are less hardy than the American Merino. 
463. Organizations and records.— At present, the 
most representative organization caring for the interests 
of these sheep is the American Delaine Merino Record 
Association, mentioned under the American Merino. 
Starting with the organization of the Victor-Beall De- 
laine Merino Sheep Breeders’ Association, established in 
1882, in Pennsylvania, a large number of societies have 
heen formed, of restricted membership and more or less 
restricted influence. Several of these have published 
flock-books, and have established score-cards for judging 
purposes.

RAMBOUILLET OR FRENcH Merino SHEEP 
Figs. 75, 76. 
464. The Rambouillet is a very large type of Merino, 
developed in France from Spanish Merino stock, and tak- 
ing its name from the Royal farm at the village of Ram- 
bouillet, near Paris. 
465. History.— The first importation of sheep from 
Spain to the Royal farm at the village of Rambouillet 
was in 1786. Other importations were made at later 
dates. The improvement was secured principally by 
selection, the object being to produce a large carcass, of 
good mutton form, covered with a good fleece. Much 
success was attained in point of size, although the fleece 
did not increase in the same ratio. The French govern- 
ment officials kept careful records of their breeding opera- 
tions at Rambouillet for upwards of a hundred years. 
Besides the flock at Rambouillet, other flocks were estab- 
lished in France, and from these important breeding farms 
in Germany were stocked. 
Rambouillets were first brought to America in 1840, 
under the name of French Merinos. Many were imported 
during the fifteen years following, and the breed had rather 
widespread popularity. Between the years 1856 and 
1860, a number of Rambouillets, bred by John D. Pat- 
terson, of New York, and descended from an importa- 
tion of his own, were taken to California and became 
the progenitors of several very noted flocks now existing 
in that state. In 1851, a company of Ohio breeders, 
headed by A. P. Howard, made an importation. 
At first, Rambouillets were welcomed, but later they 
went into disfavor, owing principally to an alleged lack  
-P-A-G-E-424
  378 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
of hardiness. The truth is, perhaps, that the Rambouil- 
lets, being larger than American Merinos, require more 
food, which was not always given them. About 1890, a 
revival of interest in the 
breed occurred, and_ since 
then it has greatly increased 
in distribution and in esteem. 
The later breeders have not 
found the Rambouillet to 
lack in hardiness. Much 
blood from the German flock 
of Baron F. Von Homeyer 
has been mingled with the 
bloods of France, and nu- 
merous importations from each country have been made. 
The Franco-Merinos represent the blood of the Ram- 
bouillet and the American 
Merino. 
466. Description. — The 
most striking difference be- 
tween the Rambouillet and 
the American Merino is in 
size (Figs. 75, 76). Rams 
at maturity will average in 
weight 175 to 185 pounds, 
and ewes should average 140 
to 160 pounds. Individuals, 
both male and female, may 
go as much as a hundred pounds heavier. This large 
body, usually smooth and free from wrinkles, except 
perhaps, one or two folds on the neck, is completely 
covered with a fine white fleece, not bearing too much 
oil. The fleece should be dense, and the staple about 
  Fic. 75. — Rambouillet ram. 
  Fie. 76. — Rambouillet ewe.
-P-A-G-E-425
THE WOOL BREEDS OF SHEEP 379 
three inches in length. The head is larger in proportion 
than in the American Merino, the nose strongly aquiline 
and covered with fine, white hair or short, fine wool. 
The rams usually have large, spirally curved horns, 
although horns may be entirely lacking. The ewes are 
hornless. Sometimes the observer is impressed by the 
length of leg. The Rambouillet is also characterized by 
hardiness, early maturity, longevity and prolificacy. 
467. Uses of Rambouillet sheep.— As a wool-pro- 
ducer, the Rambouillet ranks below the other Merinos in 
percentage of fleece to body weight, and in fineness and 
the amount of oil and crimp, although it ranks well when 
compared with other breeds of sheep. The average yield 
of fleece is about fifteen pounds for rams and ten pounds 
for ewes. 
The Rambouillet fattens well, although not equaling 
the English breeds in this respect, and produces a fair 
quality of mutton. Rambouillets on the ranges have 
great popularity, owing to their large size, hardiness and 
the ability of the ewes to hold their wool well with ad- 
vanced age. Rambouillet ewes are prolific and good 
mothers, and their lambs are usually hardy and strong at 
birth, and come on fast. 
For cross-breeding, the Rambouillet is in great favor. 
Crossed with sheep of any of the mutton breeds it nicks 
well, making a very fine lamb, large, quick to fatten, and 
having a good, heavy fleece of excellent wool. It is also 
used very successfully on American Merinos to produce 
a smoother lamb of greater size and hardiness. 
468. Distribution. — The demand for these sheep has 
been wide, especially for the purpose of improving wool- 
production by crossing on other breeds. Aside from those 
brought to North America, importations have been made
-P-A-G-E-426
Se ON ee ee ee ee eT Per ee 
380 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
into many parts of Europe, notably Germany, and to 
Australia, New Zealand and Argentina in South America. 
In America, the Rambouillet is widely distributed, espe- 
cially in the middle states and in Utah, Washington and 
down through California. 
469. Organizations and records. — In 1889, the Ameri- 
can Rambouillet Sheep Breeders’ Association was organ- 
ized at Pontiac, Michigan. It issues a flock-book. In 
1901, the advocates of the sheep imported from the Von 
Homeyer flock organized the Von Homeyer Association 
of Rambouillet Sheep. The Franco-American Merino 
Association was organized in 1900. Neither of the latter 
two associations at any time has been very strong or has 
had much influence on the development of the breed.

CHAPTER XIV 
LESSER KNOWN BREEDS OF SHEEP 
470. There are a great many little-known (in America) 
breeds of sheep that are worthy of mention, as some of 
them have met special needs in special regions, and have 
qualities to recommend them. There are still others, 
such as the Welsh Mountain, the Lonk and the Shetland, 
that are of so little interest to farmers in America, that 
they may safely be ignored. 
471. Barbados or ‘“ Woolless” sheep (Fig. 77). 
By E. Iv Shaw. — Representatives of this breed of sheep 
were imported by the United States Department of Agri- 
culture from the island of Barbados, West Indies, in 1904. 
It is thought to be of African origin. It is hardy and very 
prolific. ‘The ewes breed at any season of the year, and 
produce one to five lambs at a time. The young lambs 
are very attractive. The breed is of medium size and has 
somewhat of a deer-like appearance. The color varies 
from a light fawn to a dark brown. The under part of 
the body and the legs are very dark in color, almost black. 
The ewes are hornless and the rams are usually so, but 
in some cases the rams have small horns curving back- 
ward and downward. The rump is steep, the tail set 
low, reaching the hocks. The breed is practically without 
wool, the body being covered with coarse hair. The 
small quantity of wool is of very fine fiber. The hair has 
a decided crimp. The rams have a very decided beard, 
381

  382 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
which extends from the angle of the jaw almost to the 
brisket. This breed is considered to be valuable in warm 
climates for its mutton. 
472. Black-face Highland sheep. By John A. Craig. 
— This mountain breed of sheep is most commonly 
called “ Black-Face,” although in the effort to be more 
specific it is frequently re- 
ferred to as the “Scotch 
Black-Face ” or the Black- 
Face Highland. It is of me- 
dium size, with a_ bold, 
®: commanding appearance, 
§ added to somewhat by the 
fact that both the ewes and 
the rams have horns. The 
face is mottled or speckled, 
the fleece long in fiber and 
somewhat coarse. The chief point of merit is its thrifti- 
ness under conditions that would result in the extinction 
of almost any other breed of sheep. The mature sheep 
of this breed are very hardy and easily sustained. They 
subsist largely on heather and on the roughest kind of 
land, and withstand extreme exposure during severe 
storms. The newly born lambs share in this strength of 
constitution, and they are singularly equipped to undergo 
exposure by having a short, tight fleece cover them from 
heel to ear as soon as born. 
The Black-Face may justly claim to be one of the 
oldest breeds of Great Britain; and being so, their early 
history is little known. It is commonly thought that they 
are the original stock of the country. The very earliest. 
mention of these sheep is by a writer, Hector Boethius, 
born in 1470, who says that until the introduction of the 
  Fic. 77. — Woolless sheep.

Cheviot sheep, the rough-wooled Black-Face was the 
only kind known in the vale of Esk. The breed at the 
present time has been estimated to comprise about two- 
thirds of the sheep stock of Scotland, and one-third of 
the total sheep stock of the north of England. 
They are mainly confined to this territory, for their 
importation to other countries or localities has not been 
very successful. Some have come to America, being first 
imported into New York state in 1861; but they have 
not been popular here. 
Black-Face sheep are much used for cross-breeding, 
but no infusion of outside blood has been successful in 
improving them for their native conditions. In addition 
to their hardiness, they have other characteristics which 
adapt them peculiarly for the Highlands. They are not 
only capable of traveling long distances on rough ground 
in search of food, but they also have a peculiar “homing” 
instinct, based presumably on 
their strong attachments to 
certain parts of their grazing.

384 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Macdonald says that in the beginning of the last century 
| a ship was stranded on the coast of Cumberland that 
had on board some Scotch sheep, which seem to have 
been unknown in that country. The sheep were landed 
and turned on the neighboring hills. Their excellent 
qualities and adaptation to their new situation became 
speedily evident. Their fleece was considerably finer 
than that of the common black sheep, and the matted 
quality of the wool enabled them to endure any severity 
of weather, and even to pass the whole of the winter with- 
out the smallest quantity of hay being expended upon 
them. By their ceaseless activity they scraped away the 
snow, however deeply the herbage might be buried under 
its 
These sheep are credited with living to a very old age, 
Macdonald stating that the ewes will breed for fifteen or 
twenty years. 
In the English Lake country, the mountains of Cumber- 
land and Westmoreland, in the north of England, these 
small sheep hold their own against the encroachments of 
all other breeds. 
°474. Persiacot and Persiarino sheep. By JL. L. 
Shaw. — The Persiacot is a cross between the Persian and 
the Cotswold breeds. This cross-breed is said to be very 
hardy, and produces an excellent quality of mutton. The 
lambs make very rapid gains, and are in demand at good 
prices. The Persiarino is a cross between the Persian 
and the Merino breeds. This cross-breed is said to pro- 
duce a very hardy sheep and an excellent quality of 
mutton. All grades of these crosses are said to be fertile. 
The Persian resembles the Tunis, has a fat tail, and 
dark, hair-like wool. It has been used in a small way 
in the West for crossing.

475. Romney Marsh sheep. By John A. Craig. — 
This breed takes its name from the district known as 
Romney Marsh in the counties of Kent and Sussex, in 
the south of England, which has led also to its being spoken 
of as the Kent breed. 
The Romney Marsh (Plate XII) may be said to be one 
of the largest of the lowland breeds, being surpassed in 
weight only by the Lincoln. It has a broad, white face, 
and most frequently a tuft of wool on the forehead. It 
does not have horns. The native or original stock of the 
breed was large and coarse, but it is likely that the in- 
fusions of Leicester and Lincoln blood added both to its 
weight and improvement of appearance. The type is long 
and low, with comparatively thick legs and feet, and a 
strong-boned frame. The wool is long, comparatively 
fine, and the weight of the fleece from six and one-half 
pounds upward. | 
The special utility of the breed is its adaptability to 
low-lying lands which produce luxuriant feed, and will 
stand heavy stocking. The Romney Marsh may be run 
more thickly on such ground than any other breed, and 
continue thrifty. Under such conditions, it attains a 
large size and heavy weight, and the records of Smith- 
field and other British. shows bear out the statement that 
it is rarely surpassed in the latter by any breed excepting 
the Lincoln. 
476. Ryeland sheep (Fig. 79). By W. L. Carlyle. — 
The Ryeland breed of sheep originated many years ago 
in the midland counties of England. Its name comes 
from the Ryelands of Hereford, a poor upland district. 
The breed originated by crossing Southdown and Leices- 
ter rams on the old Morfe Common type of sheep, from 
which the Shropshire breed originated. In its blood

lines it is similar to the Shropshire and the Morfe Com- 
mon sheep, being leggy, with light fleece and a speckled 
black and white face. The Ryeland breeder selects the 
lambs with the white faces and legs, and the Shropshire 
breeder takes those with the dark faces and legs. The 
Ryeland is a very compact and hardy sheep, and fattens 
very readily. In form, it is thick and heavy in the 
hind-quarters, with broad, 
Sie». level back, full round body, 
\ a little inclined to be coarse 
in the shoulders, short, well- 
set neck, and broad head, 
with some wool covering on 
the head. Its legs are short 
and straight. The Ryeland 
is an active, vigorous sheep, 
midway between the South- 
down and the Shropshire in type and adaptability. Both 
the lambs and the ewes of the Ryeland breed are hornless, 
and the wool is finer in character, perhaps, than that of 
any of the other medium-wool breeds. 
The first importation of the Ryeland sheep into America 
was made by George McKerrow, of Pewaukee, Wiscon- 
sin, early in the summer of 1907, for the Colorado Agri- 
cultural College. The breed has been but a short time 
in this country, but it is well adapted for the mutton- 
producing sections of America. The lambs are dropped 
very fat, and the ewes are wonderfully good mothers. 
They seem to cross well with both the Southdowns and — 
Shropshires. The fleece of the Ryeland is not so heavy 
nor so dense as that of the Shropshire, but it is longer 
and finer in the staple.

province of North Africa bordering on the Mediterranean 
sea. Much of the land is hilly. The fat-tailed sheep 
living in the upland region of the province are called 
Tunis sheep. 
They are generally hornless; face and legs of a yellow- 
brown or tawny color; a few are brown or mottled brown 
and white. The tail is broad, being five to ten inches 
wide, and is usually docked to about six inches. The 
ears are large, broad, pendulous and covered with fine 
hair. The fleece is soft, fine and fairly compact, about 
three inches long, and varies in color. One may have a 
fleece almost white, another reddish, and another mottled. 
Mature specimens weigh 120 to 150 pounds. 
The origin of the Tunis breed is unknown. The type 
has no doubt existed in Tunis for centuries, and also 
in the adjoining sections of North Africa. Similar fat- 
tailed sheep are found in Syria and are supposed to be 
derived from a variety of the primitive race bred by the 
patriarchs and the early shepherds of Palestine and ad- 
jacent lands. 
The introduction of Tunis sheep to America is said to 
date back to 1779, when the Bey of Tunis allowed General 
Wm. Eaton, then United States Consul at Tunis, to ship 
to America several ‘“ broad-tailed Barbary or Mountain 
Tunis sheep.” Only one pair reached the United States. 
These were placed in the care of Judge Richard Peters, 
on his farm near Philadelphia, where they did well and 
increased in numbers. The original ram was afterwards 
used on the farm of General Hand, in Lancaster county, 
Pennsylvania. In 1807 or 1808, another importation 
was made by Commodore Barron of the United States 
navy. These were bred in Virginia and the District of 
Columbia. In 1825, another importation was made,

some of which went to near Albany, New York. From 
the early Peters flock, these sheep spread into Georgia 
and South Carolina, and were common in the South be- 
fore the Civil War, which nearly exterminated them. 
More recently Roundtree, of Indiana, has been a leading 
promoter of the breed. There are several flocks in Indi- 
ana and Ohio. In 1876, an American Tunis Sheep Breed- 
ers’ Association was organized. 
The Tunis as a mutton sheep has met with much favor. 
The lambs fatten early, and as the ewes will breed at 
various seasons they have been used to raise lambs for 
the Christmas market. Cross-bred lambs are popular, 
as they are easily and quickly fattened and yield mutton 
of an excellent quality. As a wool-producer, the Tunis 
does not rank high. The color is objectionable, and the 
weight of the fleece is only six to eight pounds.

and skin are of a bluish tinge, and this characteristic is 
encouraged, while in nearly all the other breeds a pink 
skin is sought, and the bluish tinge considered undesir- 
able. The wool of these sheep is peculiar in that it is 
unusually lustrous, and is very wavy or full of “ pirls,’ —

as they are called. It is long, strong and comparatively 
fine, considering its length. 
The original stock of this breed seems to have been 
most prevalent in Yorkshire, and at an early day it was 
known as the Teeswater. The new name of Wensley- 
dale Longwool was attached to it about the time the 
Yorkshire Agricultural Society began giving prizes for it, 
it being more common in Wensleydale than in any other 
district. Its origin seems to be akin to that of the old 
Leicester breed, and later infusions of Leicester blood 
undoubtedly have been made. The present type and 
characteristics have long been fixed, however. 
The rams are used to cross on Black-Faced ewes, 
as it has been found that the cross-bred product makes 
a good feeding-lamb, and they have the additional desir- 
able qualification of throwing dark-faced lambs. 
The breed is confined closely to its native district, 
few having been exported to other countries. The most 
notable introduction of Wensleydale sheep to America 
was the importation made by the Wyoming Agricultural 
Experiment Station, which is said to be giving promise 
of valuable results. Aside from this, little attention has 
been given the breed in this country. 
The Wensleydale has two societies and flock-books 
devoted to it—the Pure Select Wensleydale Sheep 
Breeders’ Association, with headquarters at Carperby, 
Bedale, England, and the Wensleydale Longwool Sheep 
Breeders’ Association and Flock-Book Society, with head- 
quarters at Howgrave, Ripon, England.

CHAPTER XV 
GOATS 
THE goat, Capra spp., Bovide, is a genus of quadrupeds, 
very closely allied tothe sheep. It seems probable that the 
domestic goat is descended from the Persian pasang (Capra 
egagrus), which is the most characteristic species of the 
wild goats. The types of domestic goats that have been 
developed under their long period of domestication are very 
numerous, but comparatively few are of economic value in 
America. Perhaps the Angora (Capra angorensis) is the 
best known in this country, although the interest in milch 
goats is increasing. The zodlogical origin of the Angora 
goat is not known. The prevailing opinion seems to be 
that the foundation stock is some derivative of Capra 
e@gagrus, perhaps with crosses from the markhor (C. fal- 
conert) or other wild Asian species. The goat has never 
been held in high esteem in America, but this attitude — 
may change. \ 
Mention should be made of the Cashmere or Shawl 
goat of India, which is valued for its fine, silk-like under- 
wool, much prized in shawls. “ Mountain goat ” is men- 
tioned under Sheep.

meat. The male goat is called a buck, the female a doe, 
the castrated male a wether, and the young a kid.

   GOATS 391 
480. Origin. — The Angora goat derives its name from 
the vilayet of Angora, in Asia Minor. The city of Angora 
is the capital of the vilayet of Angora, and is located 
about two hundred miles south-by-southeast from Con- 
stantinople. The province is mountainous to a consider- 
able extent and furrowed by deep valleys. The climate 
is extreme. Some writers have ventured to say that the 
Angora goat originated in this district over 2400 years ago. 
It is said that the pure Angora goat was nearly bred 
out in 1863. The reason for this was the extensive cross- 
ing with the common Kurd goat. ‘ 
481. History in America. — The first importation of 
Angora goats to America was made in 1849. During the 
administration of President Polk, says Colonel Richard 
Peters, the Sultan of Turkey requested that a suitable 
person be sent to that country to conduct some experi- 
ments in the culture of cotton. James B. Davis, of South 
Carolina, was delegated. On his return to the United 
States in 1849, the Sultan presented to him nine choice 
Angoras. These animals were imported as Cashmeres, 
and were so regarded until after they were purchased by 
Colonel Richard Peters in 1853. This importation was 
frequently exhibited at fairs, and always attracted much 
attention. Colonel Peters is generally regarded as the 
real founder of the Angora goat industry in America. 
There have been, from time to time, various other im- 
portations of Angoras from Turkey and South Africa. 
These are widely disseminated, and the blood of most of 
them has been beneficial to the industry in this country. 
The Civil war was disastrous in its effects on the industry, 
and the Angora goats in the southern and eastern sections 
of the country were practically exterminated. The 
western men who adopted the industry, and finally saved

it, were William M. Landrum, C. P. Bailey and John S. 
Harris. 4 
482. Description. — The Angora goat was formerly 
described as a small animal, but, owing to favorable con- 
ditions, its size has been greatly increased (Fig. 81). 
It is smaller than the common goat, weighing sixty to 
one hundred pounds, although specimens are frequently 
found that weigh considerably more. Both males and 
females have horns and beards, but in rare instances an 
animal without horns may be seen. The horns of the 
male grow to a length of fifteen to twenty inches and 
turn upward and outward with a backward twist, while 
those of the female, which grow to a length of eight to 
ten inches, grow upward and point backward, with only 
a slight inclination to twist. The horns are grayish in 
color, never black. The body should be round, the back 
straight, with shoulder and hips of equal height. The 
chest should be broad ; legs short and-strong ; head broad, 
with a wide muzzle and bright 
eyes; ears either partially 
upright or distinctly pendent, 
and six to eight inches long. 
The fleece should be pure 
white, covering all parts of 
the body, as dense on the 
raver | ANwotaloats, belly and neck as on the back — 
and sides, and it should ex- 
tend to the ears and the jaw. Many Angoras. have 
mohair on the forehead, face and legs. The mohair 
should make an annual growth of not less than eight to 
ten inches, and weigh three to five pounds per fleece. 
It should hang in well-formed ringlets from all parts of 
the body, and should be fine, soft, lustrous and strong. 
   
-P-A-G-E-439
GOATS 393 
The fleece should be free from kemp. The fibers become 
coarser, thinner and straighter as the animal grows older. 
The best mohair grows on goats of the best blood; and 
among these, that on the kids, yearling wethers and does 
is superior in the order named. 
The offensive odor from the bucks of the common goat 
is entirely absent in the Angora breed, except at the rut- 
ting season, and then it is noticeable only in a slight 
degree. The odor in a fleece of mohair is milder than 
that in a fleece of wool. 
483. Types. —Some strains of Angoras have fox-like 
ears, but those with the pendent ears are preferred. In 
this country, care must always be exercised to cull the 
off-colored kids from the flock. These may be the result 
of atavism, from a cross made on a common goat, either 
red or black. It is reported that different colors are 
found in the province of Angora among what were sup- 
posed to be pure-bred animals. Some Angoras have very 
little or no mohair on the forehead and legs, while others 
have a tuft on the forehead, and the legs are well covered 
down to the feet. 
484. Distribution. — Angora goats are widely distrib- 
uted throughout America. They are found in almost 
every state and territory in the Union, the largest numbers 
being in Texas, New Mexico, California, Arizona, Oregon 
and Montana. They are found in large numbers in Cape 
Colony. The census report for April, 1904, gives the 
number in Cape Colony as 2,775,927. It is estimated that 
in 1894, there were over 1,230,000 Angoras in Asia Minor. 
485. Breeding of Angoras. — Goats of both sexes will 
sometimes breed when they are five or six months old, but 
from the fact that at this age they are but a month or 
two from weaning time, and are not fully grown, it is
-P-A-G-E-440
EES IRE Ree er ee ATL Lae . hen 
394 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
obvious that they should not be permitted to breed. 
They reach maturity when about sixteen or eighteen: 
months old, and they should not be bred before this 
time. If bred earlier, the kids will not be so strong, nor 
so well developed. The goats are in their prime when 
two to six years old. Does should not be kept until they 
are very old, unless they produce kids of exceptional 
merit, for their mohair becomes coarser and less valuable 
as they mature. The average life of goats is about twelve 
years. 
Bucks usually come in heat about the middle of July, 
and continue so about six months. Does.do not usually 
come in heat until the latter part of August or the first of 
September. The period of gestation is 147 to 155 days. 
The kids should not come before the warm days of spring, 
or when vegetation begins to put out vigorously. The 
only objection to early kidding is the extra care required 
to preserve the life of the kids, for they are delicate for 
the first few days. 
A buck should be in the best possible condition when 
put to service, and should be fed some grain during the 
breeding season. For the best results, about forty or 
fifty does should be allowed to a buck. The pure-bred 
Angora does not often drop more than one kid at a time, 
while the common goat nearly always drops two. » The 
kidding season is the most important in the life of the goats. 
For several days after the kids are dropped, they naturally 
demand good care. After a few weeks they are able to 
care for themselves, and can follow the flock. 
A few days before a doe is due to kid, she should be 
separated from the flock. Some breeders would put her 
alone in a pen, while others would put as many as twenty 
in one pen. If the facilities are at hand, a small pen for
-P-A-G-E-441

GOATS 395 
each doe is better, for the reason that the doe will own 
the kid sooner, and there will be less danger of injury. 
If kids are dropped on the range or in the pasture, they 
must be carried home and special care given to see that 
the does are made to own them, for many times they will 
refuse, especially if they have no milk. 
There are in use two methods of handling the does and 
kids at kidding time, namely, the corral method and the 
staking method. Each of these methods has its advan- 
tages. \ 
(1) The corral method may be used with any number 
of goats. When a large number of does are expected to 
kid, it is necessary to have one or two large corrals and 
several smaller ones. The does expected to kid, or those 
that have kidded, are put in the small corrals, and after 
a day or so are removed to one of the larger ones. This 
procedure is repeated until all the does have kidded. 
(2) The other, the Mexican or “staking method,” is 
used largely in Texas and New Mexico. When a kid is 
born, it is taken to a convenient place to “ stake ” and the 
mother is coaxed to follow, and the kid is “ staked ”’ or 
“toggled ” with a string about twelve inches long. This 
string is tied to one leg, being changed occasionally from 
one leg to another to avoid lameness. The string should 
have a swivel on it to prevent twisting. ids are usually 
staked for a week to ten days. 
Kids should not be weaned until they are about four 
months old. The buck kids, not intended for breeding 
purposes, should be castrated when about two weeks old. 
The earlier it is done, the better will be the meat and 
mohair. ( 
No amount of cold will prove injurious to goats if they 
are kept dry. A shed of easy access is one of the essentials  
-P-A-G-E-442
\ 
396 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
of goat-raising. Angoras are able to withstand both ex- 
treme heat and extreme cold if proper shelter and feed be 
provided. They require a large amount of fresh air and 
exercise. 
486. Feeding. — The browsing habit of goats is an im- 
portant factor in their feeding. In some sections, they 
secure browse all through the winter season, as in the 
Southwest, where there is an abundance of live-oak. 
Corn fodder, cowpea hay, clover hay and alfalfa are all 
excellent coarse feeds. Oats, corn and bran are valuable 
winter rations. Goats require more salt than do sheep, 
owing to the more astringent character of their feed. A 
running stream in a pasture is valuable, but if it is not 
present, good, fresh water should be supplied. 
487. Marking. — Several devices for marking goats are 
in use, but the metal tag in the ear is probably best known. 
A practice which appears to give satisfaction is to tattoo 
the numbers into the ear, using indelible ink. It is found 
that the metal is sometimes pulled out by brush. 
488. Shearing. — In Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and 
sometimes in California, shearing is done twice a year, 
usually in the months of March and April, and in Septem- 
ber or October. The reason for this practice is that, owing 
to the warm climate, the fleece will often shed in the fall 
if not clipped. In other parts of the country, shearing is 
done but once a year, and that in the months of March, 
April and May. The shearing machines largely employed 
among sheep-raisers are coming into general use among 
goat-breeders. 
Goats are not so gentle in the hands of the shearer as 
sheep, and many men, especially among beginners in the 
industry, desire to know how best to handle them during 
_the operation of shearing. For this purpose, a simple 
 
-P-A-G-E-443
  GOATS 397 
combination trough and table was devised by F. W. 
Ludlow, of Lake Valley, New Mexico. This table is first 
used in the shape of a trough. The goat is placed in 
it on its back and held down by means of a strap across 
its throat. While in this position all the underparts, 
sides and legs may be worked on. In machine shearing, 
it is a good practice to start at the brisket and shear all 
the belly as far back as possible; then shear the front legs 
and neck; then start at the hocks and shear up the hind- 
legs and along the sides to the point of beginning. After 
shearing one of the sides allowed by the trough, the goat 
is tied — “ hog tied,” to use a western expression — that 
is, all four feet are tied together. The sides of the trough 
are now dropped, forming a table on which to finish the 
operation. There is now free access from the tail to the 
head, and the goat remains helpless. The proper course 
is to leave all the fleece on the table until the goat is liber- 
ated, and then roll it up inside out. 
Ludlow’s description of this table is given herewith: 
“The table is simple in construction. It is about 22 
inches high, 2 feet 10 inches long and 21 inches wide. 
The top is composed of two 9-inch sides, which are hinged 
to the 3-inch centerpiece. On the lower side of these 
movable flaps is a narrow piece 8 inches long, which catches 
on the framework of the table when the sides are lifted 
and holds them stationary. When the sides are elevated, 
the top of the table forms a trough 3 inches wide at the 
bottom and possibly a foot wide at the top. Into this 
trough the goat to be shorn is thrown, feet up. A small 
strap, which hangs from the end of one of the sides, is 
run over the goat’s neck and fastened to the other side. 
The goat’s head is hanging over the end of the table and 
the strap prevents it getting free. The belly and legs are 
 
-P-A-G-E-444
398 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK , 
then shorn. The legs of the goat are then tied together, 
the strap removed from the neck, and the sides of the 
table dropped, so that one has a plane surface on which 
to shear the rest of the animal. An untrained man can 
shear 100 goats a day with a shearing machine and such 
a table.” 
Few breeders wash their goats before shearing, and if 
the animal has been properly cared for during the winter 
and early spring, washing is not necessary. Breeders find | 
it to their advantage to ship the mohair in as clean a con- 
dition as possible. Colored fleeces, tag locks, mohair that 
is clotted and that which is dirty, should be packed sepa- 
rately. As kid hair is usually the finest, it should be 
packed by itself; the doe hair‘and that from the wethers 
may be placed together. Fleeces should not be tied with 
twine, as parts of it are likely to adhere to the fleece, and 
can be removed only by great care and effort. Fleeces 
from Turkey and Cape Colony are not tied at all, but are 
simply rolled up inside out; this is the condition in which 
the mills desire to receive them. 
489. Uses of Angoras.— The Angora goat is considered 
one of the most useful of the domestic animals, and has 
been so held from remote times. This usefulness is mani- 
fested in many ways. 
The mohair.— The fleece, called ‘‘ mohair,” is used 
extensively in the manufacture of plushes. It is not 
generally known that practically all of the plushes used in 
railway passenger coaches and street cars are made of 
mohair. Besides these plushes, which are usually plain, 
large quantities of frieze and crush plushes are used in 
upholstering furniture. The designs for the frieze plushes © 
are limited only by the ingenuity of man. The carriage 
robes, couch covers, sofa-pillow covers and rugs are dis-

tinguished by their high pile and rich coloring. Most of 
the so-called astrachan now in use is made of, mohair. 
Besides plushes, dress goods of various designs, coats 
and coat-linings, table covers, knit mits, mittens and 
gloves, are made from mohair. 
In addition to the mohair, there grows on the Angora 
goat coarse, chalky white, stiff, straight hair, varying in 
length from half an inch to four inches, technically known 
as “‘kemp.” It is generally thought that kemp is a relic 
of the common goat blood in the Angora, as it is a matter 
of history that the Angora flocks of America, as well as 
those of Asia Minor and South Africa, have been largely 
increased by crossing does of common blood. It is ob- 
jectionable. ‘ 
The skins. — The skins of the Angoras, if taken when 
the-hair is about four inches long, make very handsome 
rugs. The hair retains its original luster, and may be 
used in the natural white, or dyed any color desired. 
Carriage-robes are frequently manufactured from the 
skins. The smaller skins of the does, wethers and kids 
find a use as robes for baby carriages, and are extremely 
attractive. The skins are also used in the manufacture 
of children’s muffs, and as trimmings for coats and capes. 
The finest kid fleeces adorn the collar and border of some 
of the ladies’ opera cloaks. 
To clear brush land. — Goats are browsers by nature, 
and there is no vegetation they will eat in preference to 
leaves and twigs of bushes. The Angora has been used 
in many parts of the country for clearing land covered 
with brushwood. In localities where valuable land is 
completely overgrown with brushwood, the goats are con- 
sidered of more value for clearing it than for their mohair 
or meat.

400 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The milk. — The Angora is not primarily a milch goat, 
and is not often employed for that purpose. Information 
at hand shows that the quantity of milk given by an 
Angora doe is uncertain, and in exceptional cases only 
does it approach in quantity that produced by the estab- 
lished breeds of milch goats, such as the Toggenburg, 
Saanen, Maltese and Nubian. 
The meat. —'The flesh of Angora goats is exceedingly 
nutritious and palatable. When properly fattened, they 
produce a meat so nearly like the best lamb that it takes 
an expert to detect the difference. A large number of 
Angoras are slaughtered annually in Texas, Arizona, 
New Mexico and California. In Cape Colony, it is 
said that old does are slaughtered to furnish meat for 
farm hands, and young wethers are sold to butchers in 
the towns. 
Kansas City is the leading goat market, over sixty 
thousand head having been sold in this one market in 
one year. i 
Protection for sheep. — There is very little complaint 
heard from breeders of Angora goats concerning the 
ravages of dogs. Bucks can be trained to fight dogs and 
thus be a protection to sheep. A few goats will stay with 
a flock of sheep, but if there are many of them they will 
be likely to separate. 
Pets. — As pets for children, Angora goats are popular. 
They are remarkably intelligent and are easily trained. 
They are often harnessed to carts. 
490. Organizations and records. —'The American An- 
gora Goat Breeders’ Association, organized in 1900, main- 
tains the only record of pure-bred Angora goats in America. 
This organization has a membership of over five hundred 
breeders, representing nearly every state and territory in
-P-A-G-E-447
GOATS 401 
the Union. Over sixty-five thousand animals are recorded 
in the Angora Goat Record.

By William C. Clos 
491. The breeding of goats for the production of milk 
is a growing industry in some parts of America. In the 
development of the dairy type, numerous breeds and 
varieties of goats have been produced, adapted to meet 
different conditions. 
492. Description. — According to the best authorities, 
the following general points and qualities are applicable 
to all types of milch goats. They must possess good 
forms, indicating constitutional strength and high pro- 
ductiveness. The head must be light (dry), eyes fresh 
and lively, horns (in all horned breeds) small, neck broad, 
breast wide, ribs well sprung, back long and straight, hips 
broad and strong, legs sinewy and straight. Healthy

402 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
claws, a fine, thin skin and a well-developed, but not too 
pendent, udder (Fig. 82) and good teeth are also necessary 
requisites. 
493. General history. — Goats are among the oldest 
domestic animals, and have contributed their share to 
the subsistence of 
mankind as far back 
as historic evidences 
reach. Rutimeier dis- 
covered their remains 
among the ruined piles 
of the ancient lake- 
dwellers in Switzer- 
land. Goats and their 
. products are men- 
Fie. 82.— Milch goats with udders tioned frequently in 
ee ree ae the Bible, and by 
Herodotus and Homer, and have maintained their popu- 
larity, especially among oriental nations, to this day. 
The question of their origin is still in dispute. Accord- 
ing to Julmy, a majority of zodlogists maintain that the 
European goat is descended from the Persian Pasang or 
Bezoar goat (Capra egagrus), while others seem to trace 
it to the alpine Ibex (Capra ibex). 
Whatever may have been their origin, they have exerted 
a strong influence on the economic welfare of the peoples 
among whom they have been found. Their growth in 
numbers, outside of America, has been noteworthy ; 
although even in this country their popularity is increas- 
ing. The following statistics indicate their popularity. 
G. F. Thompson states, in his “ Information concerning 
Common Goats,” published in 1903, that there were 
1,871,252 goats of all kinds kept on farms in the United 
   
-P-A-G-E-449
GOATS 403 
States, as reported in the census for 1900, represent- 
ing a total value of $3,266,080. Besides these, there 
were 78,353 goats reported for cities and villages, which 
would bring the total up to 1,949,605 head. He estimates 
the number of Angoras at 700,000, and the remainder, he 
says, ‘‘ are all sorts of animals except recognized breeds of 
milch goats, of which there are so few as not to affect the 
total materially.” This is indeed a small number, but it 
indicates the need as well as the possibilities of improve- 
ment. 4 
European statistics give far more satisfactory results. 
Germany had (in 1883), according to Dettweiler, 2,639,904 
milch goats; Switzerland (in 1896) possessed 416,323 
head (Stebler). Pegler, in his work (The Book of the 
Goat), gives the following figures: France, 1,794,837 ; 
Russia, 1,700,000; Austria, 979,104; Spain, 4,531,228; 
Italy, 1,690,478, and the grand total for continental Europe 
as 17,198,587 head. The Yearbook of the United States 
Department of Agriculture for 1906, in its statistical 
columns, gives the total number of goats for South Ameri- 
can countries as 5,662,239; North and Central America, 
6,296,192; Africa, 17,557,590; Asia, 40,557,402, while 
Australia (total Oceanica) is marked down to a total of 
only 114,865 head. 
494. History in America. — As has been said, little 
effort has been put forth to improve the common goat of 
America, and no important milking strains or families 
have been produced. It is only under the stimulus of 
recent importations of some of the best European types 
that interest in goats for milk production has sprung up. 
The first importation on record was that of W. A. Shafor, 
of Ohio, who brought over four Toggenburg goats in 1893. 
The next importation of note was made by F. S. Peer, of  
-P-A-G-E-450
  404 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Ithaca, New York, in the spring of 1904, when he brought 
over a large number of Toggenburg and White Saanen goats 
for individuals in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey 
and Maryland. In 1905, the United States Department 
of Agriculture became interested, and through G. F. 
Thompson imported sixty-eight Maltese goats for experi- 
mentation in America. The results of this experiment 
were not satisfactory. 
495. Distribution. — At the present time goats are dis- 
tributed over a large part of the globe, but it is to be re- 
gretted that statistics furnish but very meager information 
in regard to their dissemination. Such statistics as are 
available indicate that they are found in larger or smaller 
numbers in nearly every inhabited land. In America 
they are widely scattered. An idea of their geographic 
distribution will be gained by reference to the statistics 
given above. 
496. Breeds and types. — Following are brief notes on 
the most prominent breeds and types. 
The Nubian milch goat is a long-legged goat, with 
generally a polled head, sunken nostrils, projecting lower 
jaw, long, hanging ears in most specimens, large, well- 
shaped udder and teats. The color is brown or black. 
The hair varies in length. It is native in Nubia, northern 
Egypt and Abyssinia. Huart du Plessis and Pegler recom- 
mend this breed very highly because of its large size and 
unsurpassed milking qualities, giving four to twelve quarts 
per day. However, it is very sensitive to cold and for 
that reason is not adapted for northern climates. Its 
ameliorative value, however, is not to be lost sight of 
in cross-breeding experiments, especially with southern 
varieties, as the New Mexican. 
The Maltese goat. — According to Thompson, this type
-P-A-G-E-451
GOATS 405 
is about two feet and six inches in height and will often 
weigh 100 pounds. It is usually hornless, and the pre- 
dominating color is white, although there are many other © 
colors, as red, brown and black. The ears are moder- 
ately long and horizontal. The body is low and stocky. 
It is said that the milking quality of the breed has been 
so perfectly developed that nearly every doe kid becomes 
a good milker. The udder is large and is carried low, and 
yields two to four quarts of milk daily. In Malta it is 
asserted that Maltese goats never do well when exported. 
The New Mexican goat. — By this somewhat arbitrary 
name is distinguished the only native American breed of 
goats known. They are common in New Mexico, Texas 
and the Southwest, where large numbers of them are kept 
by the Spanish-speaking populace. They are not uni- 
form in color and size, but have the reputation of being 
fairly good milkers. 
The Spanish-Maltese goat. — B. H. Van Raub, of Van 
Raub, Texas, is the most prominent breeder of this type, 
and his efforts in improving and developing this variety 
are said to have given to the United States the first pure- 
blooded breed of milch goats of its own. Thompson indi- 
cates that these Spanish-Maltese represent several varieties. 
The Toggenburg milch goats (Fig. 83) are one of the 
oldest and best known of the numerous breeds of milch 
goats in Switzerland. They are hardy and hornless, and 
their slender bodies are covered with silky hair of varied 
length and of a peculiar brown color. The males carry 
a heavy, coarse beard. The legs and ears are white, the 
latter of medium length and well carried. The breed is 
further distinguished by two white stripes on their heads, 
running parallel on each side of the face from the ears to 
the mouth, and also by two peculiar small cartilaginous  
-P-A-G-E-452
  406 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
appendages or “ wattles ”’ on the side of the neck, called 
“coetteli.” (These ‘‘wattles”’ are not, however, peculiar 
to Toggenburgs, but are found in nearly all breeds of 
: goats.) ©The Toggenburgs 
are splendid milkers, yielding 
four to six quarts daily, and 
carry the well-developed 
udders rather high. They 
bear confinement well, a fact 
that should not be under- 
estimated in considering this 
breed. 
The White Appenzeller 
goat. goat may be regarded as a 
white variety of the Tog- 
genburg breed, and is native in the Canton Appenzell 
adjoining the Toggenburg valley in Switzerland. Like 
the Toggenburg breed, it is large, hardy and productive. 
The White Saanen goat (Fig. 84) is another very popu- 
lar Swiss breed. It is gener- 
ally hornless and of large 
size. It is a good milker, 
and has been exported ex- 
tensively from Switzerland 
for ameliorative purposes. 
The Black-necked Valaisan 
goat is a very pretty and 
attractive variety covered 
with long, silky hair, black 
on the head, neck, breast and front legs, and snow-white 
on the entire middle and rear parts of the body. It is a 
fairly good milker, has a splendid constitution, but does 
not thrive under continuous confinement.

anagement and feeding. — Milch goats are very 
gnuch more so than Angoras or sheep. They 
oh rop twins and often triplets, and as their period 
ation is only about five months, they increase very 
zy, because they will breed shortly after kidding, 
yearling does are fit for reproduction. Bucks should 
be chosen carefully; only those descended from good 
milking dams should be used, and then only when they 
are of good form and constitutional vigor. Because of 
their repulsive smell, bucks should be kept entirely sepa- 
rate, and as far away from the does as possible. 
Milk from rutting does should not be used for domestic 
purposes. Observance of this rule will effectually pre- 
vent the complaints that goat’s milk has a bad taste. 
Breeding should be so managed that does will kid three 
times within two years, and if several animals are kept, 
their lactation periods may be easily arranged so as: to 
provide a steady and even supply of milk for their owners. 
The lactation period is about five or six months in the 
milking families. 
Cleanliness is absolutely necessary when goats are 
confined in stables. These animals are sensitive to cold 
and damp and therefore should be kept in warm but light 
stables, with always dry bedding. They like variety in 
their feed, and this peculiarity should not be overlooked. 
They should be given clean, sweet hay, and the good vege- 
table trimmings from the kitchen. A handful of oats or a 
little bran is a very good addition to the ration, especially 
during the period of heavy lactation. They must have 
salt regularly, and as much clean water as they will drink. 
In the winter they should have provided for them occa- 
sionally, if possible, some hazel-brush, birch, maple, box- 
elder, or similar twigs. They like to nibble such things 
    
  
-P-A-G-E-454

and will pay for the trouble. Willow, oak or a 
| bitter or acid barks should not be used for this pt 
| because they impart unpleasant tastes to the milk. ly 
summer a good pasture having a variety of forage an 
fresh water is a splendid place for them. If these direc- 
tions are observed, goats will give good wholesome milk 
plentifully. If the milk has an uncommon flavor, the 
cause is usually in the feed, unless the animals are sick. 
If pasturage is not available, then they should be let 
out into a clean yard daily, for they must have exercise, 
as in their natural environments they, like to romp and 
play. Fences must be tight, otherwise the goats will get 
out even in places where it would seem almost impossible 
for them to crawl. All braces should be on the outside, 
and no boards should be allowed to lean against the fence, 
otherwise the goats will climb over. Breechy goats should 
be provided with so-called “ puzzles ” or frames. 
Kids should be separated from their mothers and fed 
from a nursing-bottle, because their mother’s teats are 
usually too large for them. They should be weaned 
gradually, and, when they are accustomed to eat well, 
they will readily take care of themselves, as long as they 
have plenty before them to eat. Young bucks that are 
not needed as reproducers should be castrated early and 
butchered when a few months old. Their meat is then 
even more of a delicacy than lamb. 
498. Use for milk.— Contrary to common opinion, 
goats have decided virtues and capabilities that will 
eventually gain for them a prominent place in the estima- 
tion of the people, especially among the working classes in 
the suburbs of large cities, and it is not at all improbable 
they they may win favor even with the rich. 
The principal value of the milch goat is its eminent

milk-producing quality. While it has thus far been of 
relative unimportance in this country for its milk, this is 
not true in many other lands. In Switzerland, milch 
goats are commonly called the “ poor man’s cows,” and 
well they may, as they take the place of cows not only 
because of their cheapness and the comparatively low cost 
of their keep, but also because they enable poor persons 
to enjoy the advantages usually derived by the better _ 
situated classes from their cattle, under conditions abso- 
lutely prohibitive to the successful maintenance of milch 
cows. In that mountainous land, three or four well-kept 
milch goats of good breeding are commonly rated equal in 
milk-producing qualities to an average cow, and six to 
eight goats may be kept on the quantity of feed required for 
one cow. It should also be borne in mind that two or three 
goats properly managed will provide a steady supply of milk 
the year round, while the single cow does not. Goats also 
are not nearly so susceptible to the diseases that have 
proved to be such dangerous enemies to mankind, from 
the fact that they can be transmitted by cow’s milk. It is 
generally held that goat’s milk is much more wholesome 
than cow’s milk. Goat’s milk may be used fresh or cooked, 
just as cow’s milk, and is-recommended as preferable for 
infants and invalids by the best medical authorities. 
Milch goats are most productive at four to eight years of 
age, and may live to be twelve or more years old. 
Dr. Kohlschmidt’s experiments on the milk-yield of 
goats, conducted with twenty-four animals in Saxony, 
demonstrated an average yearly quantity of 725.7 litres a 
head. The highest yield ascertained by him was 1077.5 
litres; the lowest, 612.37 litres; the average per cent of 
butter-fat obtained was 3.43 per cent (maximum 4.41 per 
cent). Huart du Plessis cites the example of a pure-bred  
-P-A-G-E-456
peer ts re 
410 ' THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Nubian goat giving an average of 4.5 litres a day, with 
8.5 per cent butter-fat. This author estimates the capacity 
of a good milch goat at two litres a day for 270 days each 
year. Professor Anderegg says that there are four breeds 
of Swiss goats capable of a daily yield of four litres per 
head. Stebler states, on the authority of a Swiss farmer, 
that the total yearly expense for keeping a common 
goat, exclusive of summer pasturage, is a trifle over $2 in 
American money, against a yearly income of above $5, or 
a profit of over $3 a year on an investment of about $7. 
499. Other uses of milch goats.— Butter may be made 
from goat’s milk, but, owing to the irregular size of the fat 
globules, the cream is very slow to rise. The milk should 
be carefully and very slowly heated on the back of a stove 
until a wrinkled scum forms, and then be removed to the 
pantry for further rising. The longer time it takes to heat, 
the more cream is secured. In churning, coloring must be 
added, or else the product will be as white as lard, owing to 
the whiteness of the milk. Perfect cleanliness and special 
care are necessary or the butter will develop a bitter taste. 
Goat’s milk makes most excellent cheese, as all who have 
ever been treated to “ tome de chévre ”’ or “ Geisskaes ” 
in Europe will admit. The milk of goats is an ingredient 
that enters largely into the manufacture of very expensive 
kinds of cheese, as the famous Roquefort, Mont d’Or, Lev- 
roux, Sassenageandothers. Goat cheese has the disadvant- 
age that it usually will not keep well unless extra care and 
pains are taken in its manufacture and cure. For ordinary 
use, however, the process is as simple as that employed in 
the making of any common home-made curd cheese. 
As their, name indicates, milch goats are not intended 
as meat-producers. The flesh of older animals, therefore, 
is of minor quality, although capable of great improvement   
 
-P-A-G-E-457
GOATS 411 
by proper fattening. The flesh of well-fattened older goats 
may be rendered very toothsome by smoking and drying. 
Kid meat is esteemed as a popular delicacy in Europe and 
elsewhere. 
The skins of milch goats are important articles of com- 
merce, furnishing, as they do, the raw material for the 
finest leather (kid, morocco, saffian and the like). At 
present, most of the hides used for this purpose are im- 
ported. This may very readily be made an important 
source of income wherever goats are kept in numbers. It 
is a means of profit that has been underestimated in this 
country. 
500. Organizations and records. — In November, 1903, 
The American Milk Goat Record Association was organ- 
ized to care for the interests of milch goats in America, 
and to promote the importation of good types. A regis- 
try is maintained, entrance being based on milk-produc- 
tion and satisfactory ancestry and individual qualities.

THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 
Tue differences between typical representatives of the 
lard breeds of hogs are marked, yet they are all primarily 
short legged, broad, deep and smooth, conforming to the 
block or meat type common to the beef steer and mutton 
wether. Smooth shoulders and trim sides, broad, thick . 
backs and loins and full, deep hams in hogs from 250 to 
300 pounds weight attained in the shortest feeding period 
constitute the standard applied to all market fat hogs, 
irrespective of breed. 
BERKSHIRE Swine. Plate XV. Fig. 85. 
By G. E. Day 
501. Berkshire swine are of the “ fat-hog ” type, and 
are greatly valued in America, ranking among the first in 
popularity. 
502. History in England. — The name Berkshire comes 
from Berkshire in England. The breed is not by any 
means confined to this county, but is now spread all 
over the British Isles. The original Berkshire was of 
ancient origin, and very little is known regarding its origin. 
The color of the old Berkshire was commonly a sandy, or 
reddish brown, spotted with black, or white with black 
spots. It was very much coarser than the present type 
415
-P-A-G-E-464
  416 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
and possessed lopped ears; but even in its unimproved 
state, it had a reputation for producing a good quality of 
meat. " : 
As to the method of improvement, it is said by some 
that black Siamese boars were used on the old Berkshire 
sows, and some persons state that white, and black and 
white Chinese boars, were also used. It is easy to under- 
stand how breeds of the type of Siamese and Chinese 
swine should be eminently well adapted to modifying the 
original coarse type of Berkshire. A. B. Allen favors the 
theory that Chinese blood was used to some extent, and 
from his investigations in England, fixes the beginning of 
improvement in the Berkshire by crossing at some time 
previous to 1780. 
(503. History in America. — According to Allen, the 
first importation of Berkshires to America was made in 
1823, by John Brentnall of New Jersey. The next im- 
portation was in 1832, and great numbers have been 
brought into the United States since that time. It is 
stated that the first importation to Canada was made 
about 1838. Coburn states that for ten years subsequent 
to 1831, speculation in importing and selling Berkshires at 
inflated prices was rife in the United States, and that the 
methods employed by speculators did much to prejudice 
persons against the breed, and seriously retarded its 
progress. The breed has outlived this prejudice, how- 
ever, and has firmly established itself in the confidence 
of both American and Canadian farmers. 
504. Description. — The Berkshire is a stylish, hand- 
some hog, the best type being of rather more than medium 
size, although not so large as the Large Yorkshire or the 
Tamworth (Fig. 85 and Plate XV). The snout is of me- 
dium length, and the face dished. The ears are generally
-P-A-G-E-465
THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 417 
nearly erect, although in the larger strains and in aged 
animals they frequently incline forward. They should 
be well carried. The jowl is rather heavy, and the 
neck short, usually carrying considerable crest. The 
shoulder, back and rump are of good width, although 
the back is probably not quite so broad as that of the 
Poland-China. The ham is thickly meated, and is gener- 
ally somewhat trimmer in appearance than that of the 
Poland-China. The Berkshire generally has good depth 
of body, and indications of a strong constitution. The 
bone is of excellent quality 
in the best specimens, and 
the animal usually stands 
well on its feet. The stand- 
ard color is black, with a 
white mark on the face, 
white on each foot, and 
‘white on the tip of the tail. 
Sometimes, some of these white markings are absent, and 
sometimes white occurs on other parts of the body, such 
as a white blotch on the jowl, on the shoulder or else- 
where. The standard of excellence prepared by the 
American Berkshire Association does not disqualify an 
animal for defective markings, but in selecting breeding- 
stock, some breeders shun animals too freely marked 
with white. 
505. Types. — The type of the Berkshires is affected by 
the methods of individual breeders, and, to some extent, 
by the market demands of the countries in which they are 
bred. In the United States there was a tendency for 
some time to breed a fine-boned, somewhat undersized 
type, emphasizing smoothness and quality rather than 
size. Fortunately, however, some of the leading American

418 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
breeders are maintaining both size and quality, and the 
future of the breed is no doubt safe in their hands. In 
Canada, owing to the demands of the market for bacon 
hogs, and owing to the competition of strictly bacon breeds, 
the tendency on the part of the best Berkshire breeders 
has been to select for a lengthy, strong-boned type, which, 
compared with the American type, looks somewhat leggy 
and coarse, but which, in reality, is a first-class farmer’s 
hog. A good deal is heard at present about the so-called 
Large English Berkshire. The Large English Berkshire 
is no different in breeding from the ordinary Berkshire, 
but in England, as in any other country, the Berkshire 
will be found to vary more or less in type, and some im- 
porters select the larger, stronger-boned animals for im- 
portation to America, and call them Large English Berk- 
shires. As a matter of fact, they may be litter mates of 
animals of the very finest-boned type. 
506. Uses of Berkshire hogs. — The Berkshire is better 
suited for supplying the market demand for fat hogs than 
it is for producing bacon hogs. When backs, shoulders 
and hams are the main requirements, the Berkshire fits in 
exceptionally well; but for the export bacon trade in 
what are known as “ Wiltshire sides,’ the Berkshire has 
scarcely enough length of side, and has too heavy a neck 
_and shoulder, because the neck and shoulder furnish cuts 
which are low in price and difficult to sell in connection 
with a ‘“ Wiltshire side.” When crossed with the Large 
Yorkshire or Tamworth, an excellent farmer’s hog is the 
result, although it is perhaps a little nearer to the bacon 
type than to the fat type. Berkshires have made an 
exceptionally good showing in the market classes at lead- 
ing American shows, where they come into competition 
with other breeds. 
 
-P-A-G-E-467
THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 419 
It is difficult to secure data regarding the relative early 
maturity of different breeds, but the Berkshires certainly 
stand well in this respect. They attain reasonably good 
weights at an early age and fatten readily. It is a matter 
of dispute whether they are equal to the Poland-China in 
point of early maturity, some good authorities placing the 
Poland-China first, while others would place the Chester- 
White or Duroc-Jersey at the head of the list. As a 
matter of fact, it is quite probable that among the best 
representatives of the breeds mentioned, there is not any 
very marked difference in point of early maturity. 
As an economical converter of feed into pork, the Berk- 
shire is probably not excelled, although it would be too 
much to say that it leads other breeds in this respect. 
Breed experiments have been conducted at several agri- 
cultural experiment stations, but if we study each individual 
experiment carefully, we will be forced to the conclusion 
that the ability to make economical use of food is appar- 
ently a question of individuality rather than one of breed. 
With our present knowledge of the problem, we feel safe 
in stating that the Berkshire will produce pork as cheaply 
as any other breed. 
The flesh of the Berkshire is of excellent quality, and 
carries a large proportion of lean to fat. Investigations 
regarding the quality of meat from different breeds gener- 
ally agree in giving the Berkshire a high place both in 
quantity of lean and fineness of quality. With more 
length of side, and less tendency for the fat to run unduly 
thick over the top of the shoulder and neck, the Berkshire 
would make a capital ‘‘ Wiltshire side ” of bacon. 
Berkshire sows of the more lengthy type are prolific, and 
generally make good mothers. The extremely fine, short 
type of sow does not, as a rule, produce such large litters.

  420 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The boars are prepotent, and cross well with almost any other 
breed, as well as being useful for improving common stock. 
‘507. Distribution. — Berkshires are found in every 
state and territory of the United States, the most im- 
portant centers being Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, 
Indiana, Texas, Ohio, Kansas, Iowa, New York, Michigan 
and Tennessee. During the last two years more Berk- 
shires were sold into Pennsylvania than into any other 
state. They also are found in every Canadian province, 
the province of Ontario taking the lead. They are found 
in practically all parts of the British Isles, in South 
America, in Hawaii and in some European countries. 
508. Organizations and records. —The American Berk- 
shire Association was organized in 1875, and has the dis- 
tinction of having started the first record of swine in 
America. The first herd-book was published in 1877, and 
up to the present forty-seven volumes have been issued, 
containing the names of nearly 208,000 animals. _ 
Registration of Berkshires in Canada was begun in 
1876, and was conducted by the Agriculture and Arts 
Association until 1891, when the records were taken over 
by the newly organized Dominion Swine Breeders’ Asso- 
ciation. The first volume of the Dominion Swine Breeders’ 
Record was published in 1892. This record recorded all 
breeds of swine represented in Canada. In 1905, the 
Dominion Swine Records, together with nearly all the 
live-stock records in Canada, were placed under the direct 
supervision of the Canadian Department of Agriculture 
at Ottawa, but are under the control of a “ Record Board,” 
comprised of representatives elected by the various breed 
organizations. This National Live-Stock Record records 
all breeds of swine in Canada, but the herd-book still keeps 
the name of Dominion Swine Breeders’ Record.

By G. E. Day 
509. Poland-China swine are entirely the product and 
development of American swine-breeders. They are of 
the lard-hog type. 
510. History. — The Poland-China originated in Butler 
and Warren counties, Ohio. These two counties are 
drained by the Great Miami and the Little Miami rivers. 
The valley of the Miami is a very fertile district, and its 
name is closely associated with the early history of this 
breed. -The history of the origin of Poland-China swine 
is not altogether clear, and some points have been the 
subject of lengthy controversies. From the varying 
theories and claims put forward, we may accept the fol- 
lowing statements as being reasonably accurate. Previous 
to 1816, the Russia and Byfield breeds were largely used 
for crossing on the common hogs of the Miami valley. 
These were both white breeds, possessing more or less 
merit as feeders. In 1816, the Society of Shakers, of 
Union Village, Warren county, brought a boar and three 
sows from Philadelphia. The pigs were represented to the 
Shakers as being of pure Chinese blood, and they were 
called Big Chinas. The boar and two of the sows are said 
to have been pure white, and the other sow was white, 
with some sandy and black spots. These Big Chinas and 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
ree eT TT ae er En Cee GeO en ene open Seay 
422 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
their descendants were extensively crossed on the hogs 
then in the county, and the resulting type came to be 
known as the Warren county hog. The Big China was a 
medium-sized breed, of fine bone and good feeding quali- 
ties, and its use on the hogs of Warren county effected a 
marked improvement. It is also stated that subsequent 
to the introduction of the Big China, other China hogs of 
finer and smaller type were brought into the county. In X 
1835 or 1836, Berkshires were introduced and extensively 
used, and about 1839 or 1840, the Irish Grazier was im- 
ported and used on these pigs of complicated breeding in 
Warren county. The Irish Grazier was a white breed of 
considerable merit and did its share toward modifying the 
Miami valley hogs. It was also said by some persons that a 
Poland breed was used for crossing on Warren county ~ 
hogs, while others maintained that no such breed was ever 
introduced. An extended controversy ensued, which was 
finally ended by the findings of a committee that was 
appointed to investigate the origin of the breed, and which 
reported its findings to the National Swine Breeders’ Con- 
vention held in Indianapolis in 1872. This committee 
reported against the theory that a Poland breed had been 
used, but recommended that the name Poland-China be 
recognized as the accepted name of the breed. The 
recommendation was adopted, and since that time the 
breed, which previously had been known by a great 
variety of names, has been known as the Poland-China. 
It is said that since 1845 no outside blood has been infused 
into this breed. 
611. Description. — The Poland-China is a medium- 
sized hog, and, as commonly bred, is not so large as the 
large type of Berkshire; but the average Poland-China is 
well up to the average Berkshire in weight. The face is  
-P-A-G-E-471
THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 423 
slightly dished; the jowl full and heavy; the ears should 
be fine, firmly attached to the head, and about one-third 
of the ear should droop. The neck is short, thick and 
heavily arched on top. The shoulder is heavy, the side 
rather short, but deep, and the back wide, with a slightly 
. arched top-line. The whole 
hind-quarter is heavily 
fleshed, the ham being ex- 
ceptionally wide and deep. 
The legs are short, and the 
bone fine. Some years ago, 
Poland-Chinas were freely yy. 5, —Poland-China boar. marked with white, but the 
fashionable color to-day is black, with six white points, 
namely, white in face, on the feet, and tip of the tail. 
A limited number of white markings on other parts of 
the body is not seriously objected to (Plate XV and 
Fig. 86). 
512. Types. — As is the case with other breeds, the 
Poland-China differs more or less in the hands of different 
breeders. The older type of Poland-China was a larger, 
more rangy and heavier-boned hog than the Poland- 
Chinas seen in the show-rings of to-day. Breeders of 
Poland-Chinas have gone rather to an extreme, on the 
whole, in the matter of selecting for fineness of bone, and 
the result, in many cases, is a hog that lacks somewhat in 
size and in fecundity. These facts have been brought 
forcibly before breeders during recent years, and any 
defects of the nature stated will be remedied, no doubt, by 
thoughtful breeders. Even now, we can see evidences of | 
a change in methods, and there is little doubt that the 
Poland-China will be bred to retain its high quality with- - 
out sacrificing its utility. 
   
-P-A-G-E-472
424 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
513. Uses of Poland-China hogs. — The Poland-China 
has been developed especially to meet the market demand 
for a fat or lard hog. Its heavy shoulder, wide back and 
heavily developed hams render it an exceptionally good 
yielder from the packer’s standpoint. 
The quality of the meat produced by the Poland-China 
has frequently been criticised because of its large propor- 
tion of fat to lean. The development of a tendency to 
produce lean along with fat has been largely overlooked 
in bringing this breed to its present stage of perfection 
from a feeder’s standpoint, but it'appears to meet the 
demands of the American packer, and he is willing to pay 
top market price for it. 
In early maturity, that is, in ability to produce a finished 
fat carcass for the packer at an early age, the Poland- 
China is unexcelled. It has been bred for early maturity 
for generations, and has attained an enviable reputation 
in this connection. 
As a feeder, the Poland-China is a favorite with corn- 
belt farmers. The breed has been developed on corn- 
feeding, and seems to thrive on an exclusive corn ration 
better than many other breeds. In a colder climate, and 
on a mixed ration, the Poland-China might not show to so 
good advantage as some other breeds, but for the purpose 
of turning corn into pork, it is difficult to beat. The 
Poland-China has also demonstrated its usefulness as a 
grass hog, making good gains on pasture with a light grain 
ration. Experiments with breeds of swine have resulted 
differently at different stations, and it would seem that 
economy of production is more a question of individuality 
than of breed. Their exceptional tendency to fatten ren- 
ders animals of this breed especially valuable for crossing 
purposes, and the Poland-China is highly esteemed for
-P-A-G-E-473
  
THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 425 
crossing on other breeds, as well as on common, or grade 
stock. A cross between the Large Yorkshire and the 
Poland-China has been found to give an excellent hog, 
both from a farmer’s and a packer’s standpoint. For 
crossing with the Berkshire, Duroc-Jersey and Chester- 
White, the breed is very highly esteemed, and the cross- 
breds are generally regarded as superior to the pure- 
breds for feeding purposes. 
The most serious criticism directed against the Poland- 
China is on the score of fecundity. In any breed in which 
so much attention has been paid to the development of 
fine bone and a very marked tendency to fatten, it is only 
natural to expect that there would be some loss of fecun- 
dity, and statistics appear to indicate that the Poland- 
China is no exception to the rule. This criticism applies 
especially to the very fine-boned types. 
514. Distribution. — The Poland-China is widely dis- 
tributed over the United States. The principal states in 
which the breed is found, according to the Secretary of 
the American Poland-China Record Association, are Iowa, 
Illinois, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Indiana, 
Ohio, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Oklahoma 
and Michigan, but there are few states where Poland- 
Chinas are not to be found. 
In Canada, the breed has not obtained a very strong 
foothold. Outside of the United States and Canada the 
breed is but little known. 
515. Organizations and records. — Organizations in 
the interests of Poland-Chinas are numerous. The largest 
organization is the American Poland-China Record Asso- 
ciation, which was organized in 1878 and published its 
first herd-book in 1879, and has published sixty-four 
volumes to date, containing the names of 390,000 animals. 
 
-P-A-G-E-474
426 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The Ohio Poland-China Record was organized in 1877, 
and up to 1906 had published twenty-seven volumes. 
The Central Poland-China Association was organized in 
1880, and published twenty-six volumes of its Record up 
to 1906. In 1906, the Ohio and Central Associations 
amalgamated under the name of the National Poland- 
China Record Company, and since amalgamation thirty- 
six volumes have been published, which begin where: the 
Ohio herd-books left off. The Ohio Association recorded 
103,000 head, the Central Association 48,000 head, and 
since amalgamation, 150,000 head have been recorded in 
the National. The Standard Poland-China Record Asso- 
ciation was organized in 1887, and has published thirty- 
five volumes since that time with over 256,000 registrations. 
The Northwestern Poland-China Swine Association was or- 
ganized in 1881. The Southwestern Poland-China Record 
Association was organized in 1896. These associations 
in the main are thrifty and influential, as indicated by the 
large number of registrations; but the best interests of 
the breed demand greater unity of effort and of ideals. 
In Canada, Poland-Chinas are recorded in the Dominion 
Swine Breeders’ Record.

516. The Duroc-Jersey is an American breed of swine, 
and is of the fat- or lard-hog type. It has earned an 
enviable reputation with corn-belt farmers for early matu- 
rity, rapid fattening and prolificacy.

States for a great many years, and there seems to be no

THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 427 
satisfactory account of their origin. It is said that slave 
traders brought in a red breed of hogs from western Africa, 
known as the Guinea breed. It is also stated that Henry 
Clay imported Spanish red pigs in 1837, and that Daniel 
Webster brought red pigs from Portugal in 1852. It is 
further stated that the Berkshire, which, in its early days 
was freely marked with red or sandy hair, is responsible 
for some of the red pigs. Whatever breeds, or mixture of 
breeds, were responsible, it is certain that a large breed of 
red hogs attained to considerable prominence in New 
Jersey, and was eventually given the name of Jersey-Red. 
The Jersey-Red had large lop ears, and good length of 
body. It was rather long in the leg, and coarse in bone 
and hair. It was valued because of its size, strong con- 
stitution and rapid growth. é 
The Duroc originated in Saratoga county, New York, 
and, to put it briefly, resulted from crossing a red boar on 
the common sows of the district. It is uncertain whether 
the boar came merely from another part of New York 
state, or from England. It is said that the boar was 
named “ Duroc” after the famous stallion, and hence 
the name of the breed. The Duroc also had lopped 
ears, but it was a much finer type of pig than the 
Jersey-Red, 
- In the course of time, the breeders of Jersey-Reds and 
Durocs came together, and the two breeds were blended 
~ into one, under the name of Duroc-Jersey. The amalga- 
mation took place in 1883. ) 
‘618. Description. — The Duroc-Jersey is similar in size 
to the Chester-White and the Poland-China. Some speci- 
mens are of very large size, but the tendency of modern 
breeding is toward a medium size, with rather fine bone. 
It is possible that breeders are going too far in reducing  
-P-A-G-E-476
  428 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
the size of the animal and the weight of its bone, and the 
larger, heavier-boned hog will always find an important 
place in this breed, as, indeed, in all others. . The snout is 
of medium length; the face slightly dished; the ear 
drooped, much the same as that of the Poland-China; 
the jowl heavy; the body wide and deep, set on short 
legs of medium to fine bone ; 
the ham heavily fleshed, and 
the body generally noted for 
thickness rather than for 
> length. Cherry-red is the 
popular color, but yellowish 
red and chestnut are fre- 
quently seen. A few black 
spots on belly and legs do not disqualify, but are objec- 
tionable. Black markings on any other parts of the body 
are very serious objections (Figs. 87, 88). 
519. Types. — Like other breeds, Duroc-Jerseys present 
variations in type. On the whole, breeders have been 
striving for a fine-boned, 
smooth type of hog of medium 
size. It is asserted by some 
persons that this refining 
process has been carried too 
far, and breeders are to be 
found who are producing 
hogs of more bone and more 
size. These larger, heavier-boned hogs are attracting con- 
siderable attention among Duroc-Jersey breeders, and ‘it 
would seem that they would yet perform an important 
work for the breed. 
520. Uses of Duroc-Jersey hogs. —The Duroc-Jersey , 
is essentially a producer of fat or lard hogs, and it seems to 
    Fig. 88.— Duroc-Jersey sow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-477
THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 429 
be meeting the demands of the American packer in a satis- 
factory manner. As a bacon hog, it is not a success. 
It is an early maturing hog, and makes economical 
gains, as has been demonstrated by experiments. It must 
be repeated again, however, that individuality is much 
more important than breed in regard to economy of pro- 
duction. It is safe to say that the Duroc-Jersey will 
make as cheap. gains as any other breed. The Duroc- 
Jersey has considerable reputation as a grazer, and also 
takes kindly to corn-feeding. It has an advantage over 
most white breeds, in that its skin does not blister with the 
sun, and it is therefore gaining favor in the South. The 
meat of the Duroc-Jersey is similar to that of the Chester- 
White and the Poland-China when fed under the same con- 
ditions. If fed a mixed ration, it is capable of producing 
meat with a good proportion of lean. 
The Duroc-Jersey, for a fat hog, is prolific, although it 
can hardly be said to equal the Large Yorkshire and the 
Tamworth in this respect. 
The Duroc-Jersey crosses well with other breeds, and a 
cross with the Poland-China or the Berkshire is very 
popular. The boars do excellent work as improvers of 
common stock. 
521. Distribution. — The Duroc-Jersey is found in a 
great many states, the most important of which are Iowa, 
Illinois, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, 
Minnesota, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee, 
Michigan and Wisconsin. The breed is also largely repre- 
sented in many other states. The breed has been intro- 
duced into Canada, but has not made much progress as 
yet in that country although there are some good herds, 
especially in the western provinces.

CHESTER-WHITE SwINE. Fig. 89. 
By G. E. Day 
523. The Chester-White is an American breed of swine 
of the fat- or lard-hog type, but possessing good bacon 
qualities. It ranks with the three other great lard 
breeds. 
624. History. — Most authorities on this breed recog- 
nize three strains of Chester-White swine, the origin of 
which may be briefly summed as follows: 
(1) The original Chester-White founded in Chester 
county, Pennsylvania, whence the name. Large, white 
pigs were common in Chester county many years ago. 
They were taken there by the earliest settlers, although 
just where these original pigs came from is not altogether 
clear. About the year 1818, Captain James Jeffries im- 
ported from England a pair of white pigs, which are spoken 
of as Bedfordshire pigs, and as Cumberland pigs. Captain 
Jeffries used the boar on the native white pigs of the dis-
-P-A-G-E-479
Ee Re Le Ae ee et she oe NSE eT Si 
THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 431 
trict with good results. Later, it is stated, white Chinese 
pigs were imported to Chester county and crossed on the 
native pigs. Eventually the different strains of blood 
were combined, and from this combination came the original 
Chester-White breed. 
(2) Todd’s Improved Chester-White has a somewhat 
complicated history. About 1827, Norfolk Thin Rind 
pigs were imported from England to Connecticut. Two 
brothers, named Todd, bought a boar of this breed, and a 
sow of what was called the Grass breed, and took them 
to Ohio, where they were bred together with considerable 
success. Later, a Joseph Haskins brought to Ohio a boar 
of the Byfield breed, and a sow similar to the original 
Todd sow. The Todd and Haskins pigs were freely bred 
together. Isaac Todd also used other boars in his herd, 
one of which was said to have been of the large Grass 
breed, and another was called a Normandy boar; little 
is known of the breeding of either. Both of these boars 
were white in color. In 1865, Isaac Todd introduced 
Chester-White blood. His son, S. H. Todd, made further 
use of the Chester-White, and by careful breeding and 
selection evolved what is known as Todd’s Improved 
Chester-White. 
(8) The Ohio Improved Chester-White is the product of 
thé efforts of L. B. Silver, of Ohio, who, in 1865, began 
breeding Chester-Whites, and who aimed to produce a 
superior type through selection. 
525. Description. — Some years ago, the Chester-White 
was rated as the largest breed in the United States, but 
modern methods of breeding have decreased the size and 
produced an animal of more quality than the original type. 
As bred at present, the Chester-White may be ranked as of 
medium size, or about the same as the Poland-China. 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
  432 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The.face is straight, or very slightly dished, and the snout 
is generally somewhat longer than that of the Poland- 
China. The ear droops, somewhat like that of the Poland- 
China, although it is generally heavier, and the droop, ot 
break, is usually farther from the tip. It is common for 
the ear to be somewhat loosely attached to the head. In 
ra general conformation, the

although it is common for 
black or bluish spots to occur on the skin. In many 
specimens, the hair has a decided tendency to be wavy, 
and even curly (Fig. 89). 
526. Types. — The Chester-White is capable of show- 
ing extreme variations of type in the hands of different 
breeders. In American show-rings, the short-legged, fine- 
boned, deep, thick, smooth type is generally preferred by 
the judges, who seem willing to sacrifice considerable size 
in order to get smoothness and quality. Larger, heavier- 
boned types occasionally appear, but are generally dis- 
couraged by the judges. In Canada, greater importance 
is attached to length, and some very lengthy, heavy-boned 
Chester-Whites are frequently seen in Canadian show- 
rings. At the 1907 Provincial Winter Fair, at Guelph, 
Ontario, a pair of Chester-White carcasses were exhibited 
in the bacon class in competition with Yorkshires, Tam- 
worths and Berkshires, and though they were not ideal 
bacon carcasses by any means, they were good enough to 
win sixth prize; and a number of Yorkshire and Tam- 
   
-P-A-G-E-481
  THE. FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 433 
worth carcasses, together with all the Berkshire carcasses, 
were ranked below them. Any person who has seen the 
unequaled exhibit of bacon carcasses at Guelph, will under- 
stand that these hogs must have been about as far away 
in type from the American prize-winning Chester-White 
as it is possible to get. This is an extreme case, but it 
illustrates the possibilities of the breed under different 
systems of selection and feeding. As to the different 
strains mentioned in the history of the breed, they have 
now all assumed very much the same type. 
527. Uses of Chester-White hogs. — Although the 
Chester-White can be made to approach the bacon type 
through selection and feeding, as mentioned in the pre- 
ceding paragraph, it can never be made an ideal bacon, 
hog, and it Bee rcgl ona easton oTneneneaat to attempt 
“to-take it a bacon breed when first-class bacon breeds 
are already available. The Chester-White is especially 
adapted to the fat-hog trade, and will no doubt continue 
as such. Crosses of the Chester-White with the Large 
Yorkshire and Tamworth have given very satisfactory 
results in Canada, and it is only through crossing that 
Chester-White blood can be used successfully in the bacon 
trade. For the requirements of the American packer, the 
Chester-White is eminently well suited. 
“The qu “quality of meat produced by the Chester-White is 
good, but is somewhat lacking in lean: It is generally 
conceded that the Yorkshire, ‘Tamworth and Berkshire 
produce more lean in proportion to fat. 
In early maturity, the Chester-White compares favor- 
ably with other breeds, and it is an economical producer 
of meat.: In feeding trials it has given a good account of 
itself, but, as previously stated, no breed can claim su- 
periority over other breeds in this respect, so far as we can 
2F  
-P-A-G-E-482
  434 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
judge from experimental work and from practical experi- 
ence. The Chester-White is also a good grazer, and in 
this feature probably excels the Yorkshire and the Tam- 
worth, which are better adapted to pen feeding. 
It is said that the Chester-White, as a breed, is some- 
what more prolific than the Poland-China and the fine 
type of Berkshire. The assertion is supported by the 
findings of A. W. Bitting, who investigated the matter 
in 1897. 
For crossing purposes, the Chester-White is highly 
esteemed, a cross with the Poland-China being regarded 
with especial favor by feeders. The grade Chester-White 
sow is a very useful farmer’s pig, and pure-bred boars are 
very effective in improving common stock. 
528. Distribution. —’The Chester-White is largely dis- 
tributed over the United States. It is very popular in 
the eastern states, and is strongly represented in Ohio, 
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania 
and other states. It has also spread to the South, to 
some extent at least, and seems to be giving satisfaction. 
For some reason it has gained a much stronger foothold 
in Canada than the Poland-China, probably because it 
seems more easily bred to a lengthy type than the Poland- 
China. 
529. Organizations .and records.— The American 
Chester-White Record Association took over the business 
of the Chester-White Record Association in 1894. The 
Chester-White Record Association was organized in 1884, 
to support Todd’s Improved Chester-White Swine, and 
issued four volumes previous to 1894, when it was changed 
to the American Chester-White Record. The Ohio Im- 
proved Chester-White Swine Breeders’ Association was 
organized in 1897. For registration in the herd-book of
-P-A-G-E-483
THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 435 
this Association, pedigrees must trace to the herd of L. B. 
Silver, who has already been referred to as the originator 
of the Ohio Improved Chester-White, or the O. I. C. strain, 
as it is generally called. The Standard Chester-White 
Record Association was organized in 1890, and the National 
Chester-White Record Association in 1880. On June 15, 
1913, the Standard Chester-White Record Association and 
the American Chester-White Record Association consoli- 
dated into the Chester-White Swine Record Association. 
On March 11, 1915, the National O. I. C. Chester-White 
Record Association also joined, making a total member- 
ship of 2500. The aggregate number of animals recorded 
in the three associations that now form the Chester-White 
Swine Record Association is 90,000. In addition there are 
the Ohio Improved or O. I. C. Swine Breeders’ Association 
with 50,000 animals recorded and a membership of 900 
and the National Chester-White Record Association with 
25,000 registrations and 300 members. 
In Canada, Chester-Whites are recorded in the Dominion 
Swine Breeders’ Record. 
Literature. —The American Chester-White Record Association 
has undertaken the publication of an annual called “The Annual 
Chester-White Bulletin,” which contains some information regard- 
ing the breed, names of breeders and advertisements. ‘‘The Chester- 
White Hog Breeders’ Directory,” by Frank F. Moore, Secretary of 
the Standard Chester-White Record Association, contains consid- 
erable information, of interest to Chester-White breeders.

436 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
Hampsuire or Tun Rinp Swine. Plate XV. 
By G. E. Day 
530. The Hampshire or Thin Rind is said to be a 
bacon hog, but it may be placed more correctly between 
the bacon and fat-hog types. Its show-ring winnings in 
this country have been in fat classes. 
531. History. — The original American name of this 
breed is Thin Rind. In 1904, the organization which looks 
after the interests of the breed changed the name to 
Hampshire, which is now the official name of the breed. 
It is the latest addition to the recognized pure breeds of 
swine in the United States. 
According to H. F. Work, the Hampshire traces to pigs 
brought to Massachusetts from Hampshire, England, 
about 1820 or 1825. It is also stated that descendants of 
this importation were taken to Kentucky about 1835. 
Be this as it may, the breed has been known in Kentucky 
for many years. Various theories regarding its origin 
have been advanced, but it seems impossible to secure 
definite and reliable information regarding the origin of 
the breed. 
532. Description. — The Hampshire is only medium in 
size, and, if there is any difference, it will scarcely equal 
the Chester-White and the Duroc-Jersey in weight. The 
face is straight, and the ear is inclined forward but does 
not droop like that of the Poland-China. The jowl is 
lighter than that of the general run of fat hogs, as is also 
the shoulder and the ham. The back is of medium width, 
and the side has fair length but is not so deep as that of 
a typical fat hog. The legs are of medium length, and 
the bone is of good quality. It may be described as 
 
-P-A-G-E-485
THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 437 
between the bacon and the fat type. H. F. Work, at one 
time Secretary of the American Hampshire Association, 
describes the color as follows: ‘“ In color, they are either 
listed or blacks, the most fashionable colors consisting of 
black extremities with a white belt four to twelve inches 
wide, encircling the body and including the fore-legs, which 
should also be white.” The term “ listed ”’ means that 
the white belt is present. Work further states that there 
are some breeders who try to run their herds all black, 
and asserts that breeders should not be too particular re- 
garding color, except in cases when white spots occur. 
533. Types. — Hampshires do not vary extremely in 
type, if we may judge by exhibits made at the leading 
shows, and the breed has not yet attained sufficient 
prominence to admit of an intelligent study of this phase 
of the question. 
534. Uses of Hampshire hogs. — It is claimed for the 
Hampshire that it isa bacon hog. In regard to this claim, 
we must bear in mind that what the American packer calls 
a bacon hog is a very different animal from the one re- 
quired to make a “ Wiltshire side ” for export to Eng- 
land. It is animals suitable for making “ Wiltshire sides ”’ 
that have given rise to the market term, ‘“ bacon hog,” 
and if judged from this standpoint, the Hampshire would 
fall far short of requirements. It is altogether too short 
in the side, too thick in the shoulder, and too heavy in 
the neck to make a number one “ Wiltshire side,’ but 
as a light-weight hog for supplying bacon for home con- 
sumption, the Hampshire answers the purpose very satis- 
factorily. 
In early maturity and feeding qualities, the Hampshire 
seems to be giving good satisfaction to those who are 
handling it, and it is highly esteemed as a grazer. It is
-P-A-G-E-486
438 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
an active, hardy breed, and there is no apparent reason 
why it should not give as good an account of the food it 
consumes as any other breed. 
In quality of flesh, the Hampshire has an enviable 
reputation. It has made an excellent record in the 
dressed carcass competitions at the International Live 
Stock Exposition at Chicago, and the packers appear to 
regard it with high approval. Its strong point is the large 
proportion of lean. 
The Hampshire ranks high in regard to fecundity, and 
- appears to be one of the most prolific of American breeds 
so far as we are able to investigate the matter. 
The value of the Hampshire for cross-breeding is not 
well known, but it seems reasonable to suppose that it 
should cross well with the fat types of hogs. 
The belted color arrangement of the Hampshire is not 
invariable, both belted and black pigs appearing in the 
same litter. Therefore too strict adherence to this color 
characteristic may actually retard practical improvement 
in the breed. 
535. Distribution. — According to the secretary of the 
Hampshire Association, the breed is to be found in a large 
number of states, but the numbers in any one state are 
not large, comparatively speaking. Kentucky, Illinois 
and Indiana are probably the most important centers, 
but the breed has been making rapid progress of late. 
A few importations have been made into Canada, but 
the breed is not as yet largely represented. 
536. Organizations and records.—The American 
Hampshire Swine Record Association was organized in 
1893, and published its first herd-book in 1906. Ten 
volumes of the herd-book have been published to date, 
with a total of 93,000 registrations.

THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 439 
CHESHIRE SWINE. Fig. 90. 
By G. E. Day 
537. Cheshire swine are a breed of American origin, 
and may be classed under the fat-hog type. They have 
not attained much popularity outside of a restricted area 
in New York state. 
538. History.— The Cheshire originated in Jefferson 
county, New York, and dates from about 1855. J. H. 
Sanders, of Chicago, who bred Cheshires for some years, 
stated in a letter to F. D. Coburn, that he considered the 
Cheshire to be “ simply a derivative of the Yorkshire.” 
The Yorkshire was brought into Jefferson county and 
used on the white pigs of the district. Early in the sixties 
hogs of this breed were shown at the agricultural fairs, 
where they attained some popularity. The Swine Breeders’ 
convention, in a meeting at Indianapolis, Indiana, in 
1872, adopted the name Cheshire for the breed. It is 
thought that Suffolk blood was also used in the combina- 
tion, which eventually resulted in the Cheshire. 
539. Description. — The Cheshire is about medium in 
size, but some specimens attain heavy weights. It 
is said that the Cheshire 
weighs well for its appear- 
ance, and is a heavier breed 
than is generally supposed. 
Although the body is not 
noted for depth, it gener- 
ally has good length, and 
the shoulders and hams are 
usually well developed. The face is slightly dished, and 
the ear rather small and erect. The bone is fine and     oe Beas 
Fie. 90.— Cheshire barrow.
-P-A-G-E-488
440 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
of fair quality. The color of the breed is white. Black 
spots frequently occur on the skin, which, though objec- 
tionable, do not disqualify (Fig. 90). 
540. Types. — In his letter to F. D. Coburn, previously 
referred to, J. H. Sanders stated that in his herd he had 
produced “‘all the different types of Yorkshire, from the 
Large York down to the Lancashire Short-Face.” The 
type he succeeded in producing “‘ was almost identical, in 
size, form and quality, with the most approved medium 
Berkshire.” As bred at present, the type probably does 
not vary any more than that of other breeds. 
541. Uses of Cheshire hogs. — The Cheshire, as gener- 
ally seen, belongs more to the fat hog than to the bacon 
class, although it should not be difficult to develop it into 
a fairly good bacon breed. It appears to be a good feeder, 
ee dresses out well, and its meat is admitted to be of excellent ° 
quality. The sows are fairly prolific and breed very read- 
ily, and the boars appear to be prepotent, although but 
little is known regarding their value for crossing purposes. 
542. Distribution. — The Cheshire is found mainly in 
New York state, thé Animal Husbandry Department of 
the New York State College of Agriculture being one of 
the most ardent advocates of this breed. A few scattered 
herds are kept in other states, more particularly in certain 
of the New England and middle states. The breed has 
made but little progress, and does not seem likely ever to 
attain prominence. No doubt a few have been taken into 
Canada, but none have ever been recorded in the Cana- 
dian record. 
543. Organizations and records. — The Cheshire Swine 
Breeders’ Association was organized in 1884, and has pub- 
lished six volumes of its herd-book to date, registering over 
5800 hogs. The first volume appeared in 1889.

THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 441 
Victoria Swine. Plate XVI. Fig. 91. 
By G. E. Day 
544. The Victoria breed of swine originated in America, 
but unlike the Poland-China and the Duroc-Jersey, the 
great American breeds, it has not gained much popularity. 
It is of the fat-hog type. 
545. History. — At one time there were two breeds of 
Victoria swine, but only one breed and type is now recog- 
nized. The breed that has secured the ascendancy was 
originated by George F. Davis, Dyer, Indiana, and was 
formed by combining the blood of the Poland-China, 
Berkshire, Chester-White and Suffolk, accompanied by 
careful selection to a type. The origin of the breed dates 
to about 1870. 
The other breed was established about 1850 by Colonel 
F. D. Curtis, of New York state, who is said to have used 
Trish Grazier, Byfield, Yorkshire and Suffolk blood. 
This breed seems to have disappeared as a recognized pure 
breed. 
546. Description. — The Victoria ranks with the 
medium-sized breeds, being similar to the Berkshire in 
size. The snout is rather 
short, the face dished, and 
the ear, which is of only 
medium size, is firmly at- 
tached to the head and erect. 
The body is broad and deep, 
and the hams and shoulders 
reasonably well developed. 
The color is white, with occasional dark spots on the 
skin (Fig. 91). 
  Fie. 91.— Victoria sow.
-P-A-G-E-492
442 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOOK 
547. Uses of Victoria hogs. — The Victoria belongs to 
the fat class. We have little information regarding its 
early maturity and feeding qualities, but from the fact 
that it does not increase rapidly in popularity, it would 
seem that the public does not recognize any outstanding 
merit or advantage over other breeds. In quality of meat, 
it appears quite equal to other breeds, and it has a good 
reputation for being prolific. 
Its value for cross-breeding has not been well demon- 
strated. 
548. Distribution. — According to Plumb, the Victoria 
is found mainly in Indiana, Ohio and _ Illinois, with 
scattered herds in_a few other states. A very few Vic- 
torias have found their way into Canada, but the breed is 
now nearly extinct in that country. For some reason the 
breed does not make much progress. 
549. Organizations and records. — The Victoria Swine 
Breeders’ Association was organized in 1886, and the Vic- 
toria Swine Record is published by this association. In 
Canada, only nine animals of this breed have been recorded 
in the Dominion Swine Breeders’ Record. 
Essex Swine. Fig. 92. 
By G. E. Day 
550. The Essex is a small, easily fattened pig of the 
American or fat-hog type. It originated in England. 
551. History.— The Essex pig takes its name from 
the county of Essex in England. The original Essex pig 
was an extremely undesirable feeder’s type, being coarse 
in bone, flat in the rib and long in the leg. It was hard 
to fatten and slow to mature. In color it was generally
-P-A-G-E-493
THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 443 
black and white. In 1830, Lord Western imported black 
Neapolitan pigs from Italy, and crossed them with the 
Essex pigs. In the course of time he evolved a type that 
was a wonderful improvement on the old Essex, and it is 
said that he used other blood than that of the Neapolitan. 
Itisstated that Lord Western inbred too closely, and that his 
pigs became weak in constitution and lacking in fecundity. 
Soon after Lord Western began his work of improve- 
ment, one of his tenants, named Fisher Hobbes, took up 
the breeding of Essex-Neapolitan pigs, and in his hands 
the breed was much improved, increasing in size and im- 
proving in constitution and breeding qualities. The 
Hobbes strain was called Improved Essex, and gained in 
popularity very rapidly. 
It is said that some of the old Essex pigs existed in the 
United States as early as 1820. When the Improved 
Essex had established its reputation, importations to 
America became common, and large numbers were brought 
out, but of late years very few importations have been made. 
552. Description. — The Essex must be classed with 
the small breeds, being, as a breed, decidedly smaller than 
the Berkshire or the Poland- 
China. It is a short, thick, 
deep, chunky type of pig, 
with short, fine-boned legs. 
The snout is short, the face 
dished, the forehead broad, 
and the ears small, fine and 
erect, but inclined to droop 
slightly with age. The neck is very short, and the 
shoulders and hams largely developed. Altogether, it is 
a very smooth, compact type of hog. The color is all 
black, no white being admissible (Fig. 92).

-P-A-G-E-494
a 
444 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
553. Types.— To meet the modern demand, many 
breeders of Essex swine are striving to develop a type with 
more size, heavier bone and greater length. That they 
are meeting with some degree of success is evidenced by 
the types of Essex placed on exhibition at some of the fairs 
during the past few years. This recent type gives more 
promise of present-day utility than the type we have 
been accustomed to see. 
554. Uses of Essex hogs. — The Essex belongs to the 
extremely quick maturing, easily fattened type.’ Its lack 
of size prevents its becoming popular with the general 
farmer, and it is more suited to the requirements of the 
villager, who keeps one or two pigs, and who wishes to 
use the minimum amount of food. He will not have so 
many pounds of pork, but he will have a finished hog with 
a small outlay. The breed is regarded as being a cheap 
producer of meat, and no doubt such is the case; but it 
would not be safe to assume that it will always produce 
meat at a lower cost than larger breeds. The meat from 
the Essex is fine-grained, but excessively fat. 
The sows are not regarded as prolific, but a great deal 
depends on how they are fed and managed. 
For cross-breeding, the Essex is suitable for crossing 
with unduly coarse types. In the past, it played an im- 
portant part in improving other breeds, but as the breeds 
of swine have been brought to a finer type, the field of the 
Essex has become narrowed, until the breed is now more 
famous for what it has accomplished than for what it is 
capable of doing at present. About the only important 
opening for it in the United States at present, is the con- 
quest of the “ Razorback” of the South, and on this 
mission it has already set forth. 
555. Distribution.— The Essex has spread from its
-P-A-G-E-495
  
  THE FAT OR LARD BREEDS OF SWINE 445 
native county into several other English counties. It has 
been exported to several European countries, to Australia, 
Canada and the United States. It would be difficult to 
select any state as an important center for this breed, but 
it occurs, scattered here and there in small lots, in a large 
number of states. It has become very popular in the 
South. f 
The Essex has nearly disappeared from Canada. None 
of the Canadian exhibitions makes a separate class for 
this breed. 
556. Organizations and records. — The American Essex 
Association was organized in 1887, but its membership is 
not large. It has published two volumes of its record, 
which contain some 1500 names. In Canada, Essex 
swine are recorded in the Dominion Swine Breeders’ 
Record, but only 286 animals have been recorded. 
SurroLk Swine. Fig. 93.

557. The Suffolk is an English breed of swine, closely 
identified with the Small Yorkshire, and of little impor- 
tance in America. It may be classed with the fat- or lard- 
hog types. It is best adapted to intensive conditions, 
where land for grazing is scarce and soiling food is used in 
addition to pasture. 
558. History. — The Suffolk is undoubtedly of the same 
origin as the Small Yorkshire, and is an offshoot of the 
Small White breed in England. There is no such breed 
as a White Suffolk recognized in England, but the name 
Suffolk was sometimes applied locally to the Small Black 
breed, of which the Essex is a representative. 
 
-P-A-G-E-496

446 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
The breed is said to have been brought to the United 
States in 1855, but it has never made much progress, and 
seems to be losing ground steadily. 
559. Description. — At the National Swine Breeders’ 
Convention at Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1872, the follow- 
ing description of the Suffolk was approved: “ Head 
small, very short; cheeks prominent and full; face 
dished ; snout small and very short; jowl fine; ears short, 
small, thin, upright, soft and silky; neck very short and 
thick, the head appearing almost as if set on front of 
shoulders, no arching of crest; chest wide and deep; 
elbows standing out ; brisket wide but not deep; shoulders 
thick, rather upright, rounding outward from top to 
elbow ; crops wide and full, long ribs, well arched out from 
back, good length between shoulders and hams; flanks 
well filled out and coming well down at ham ; [oack broad, 
at e tail; hams wide and full, well rounded out, twist 
very wide ‘fe full all the ap straight from crest to tail, not fallingSoff or down 
  way down; legs small and 
very short, Standing wide 
apart #- in sows, just keep- 
ing belly from the ground ; 
bone fine, feet small, hoofs 
rather spreading ; tail small, 
long and tapering; skin thin, 
of a pinkish shade, free from color; hair fine and silky, not 
too thick ; color of hair, pale yellowish white, perfectly free 
from any spots or other color; size, small to medium.” 
In size, the Suffolk is probably slightly larger than the 
Small Yorkshire, but it is practically the same breed (Fig. 
93).

garding Small Yorkshires under this heading applies here, 
as the breeds are essentially the same. 
561. Distribution. — The so-called Suffolk pig is: con- 
fined to the United States and Canada, although it has 
practically disappeared from the latter country. In the 
United States it is found mainly in the Mississippi valley, 
but herds are not at all numerous. 
562. Organizations and records. — The American Suf- 
folk Association was organized many years ago, but no 
herd-book has yet been published. In Canada, Suffolks 
are recorded in the Dominion Swine Breeders’ Record, 
only 850 animals having been recorded. 
SMALL YORKSHIRE OR SMALL WuITE Swine. Plate XVI.

By G. E. Day 
563. The Small Yorkshire is an English breed of pigs, 
and may be said to be of the fat-hog type. It is of rela- 
tive unimportance in America. 
564. History. — The Small Yorkshire comes from Eng- 
land, where it goes by the name of ‘‘ Small White,” the 
name ‘Small Yorkshire” being of American origin. 
The breed is thought to be of Chinese origin, modified, of 
course, by the methods of the English breeders. Various 
types or strains of Small Whites have been bred in England, 
but at present they are not regarded as a distinct breed. 
The Small Yorkshire was brought to the United States, 
according to Curtis, in 1860, and numerous importations 
were made between that time and 1878. 
565. Description. — The Small Yorkshire may be con- 
sidered the smallest breed of swine kept in the United
-P-A-G-E-498
448 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
States. It has a very short, turned-up snout, wide face, 
small, erect ears, heavy jowl, and a very short, heavy neck. 
The body is short, thick, deep and smooth, and the legs 
are very short and fine in 
the bone. The color is white 
and the hair is abundant, 
but fine (Figs. 94, 95). 
566. Uses of Small York- 
shire hogs. — It is somewhat 
Fra. 94.—Small Yorkshire boar. ‘ifficult to give any very im- portant use for Small York- 
shires in America: The breed matures very early, and 
fattens easily, but produces excessively fat meat. It is 
probably most suitable for the cottager who wants a pig 
that can be matured with a small amount of feed. 
There is no American breed that requires crossing with 
a breed like the Small Yorkshire, unless it is the “‘ Razor- 
back,” and the Essex seems to be rather better adapted 
to this purpose, as it will stand the hot sun of the South 
better than a white pig. Any advantage from crossing 
with ordinary breeds would accrue to the Small York- 
shire, rather than to the [Oe raat eae 
other breed. * es 
The Small Yorkshire is } 
not noted for fecundity, and 
it would seem as though the 
breed were destined gradu- 
ally to disappear, unless 
some unforeseen conditions 
arise which call for the services of a pig of this kind. 
567. Distribution. — Small Whites still are found in 
many parts of England, although not recognized as a pure 
breed. In the United States, under the name of Small

Yorkshire, small herds are to be found, mainly in the 
East. The breed no longer attracts much attention. 
568. Organizations and records. — The American Small 
Yorkshire Club was organized in 1878, and has recorded 
some 1500 pigs in its herd-book. The American Yorkshire 
Club also records Small Yorkshires, the Small Yorkshires 
being recorded in what is called Class A and the Large 
Yorkshires in Class B. No small Yorkshires have been re- 
corded under this name in Canada.

THE BACON BREEDS OF SWINE 
Since side meat is the most important yield of the 
bacon hog, length instead of breadth is of primary con- 
sideration. Both bacon breeds are characterized by 
extreme length and all that is correlated with it — longer 
legs, less width throughout, trimmer jowl and under line, 
lighter shoulders and tapering hind-quarters or gammons, 
devoid of any fullness.

569. The Large Yorkshire is an English breed of swine. 
It possesses very superior bacon qualities, and stands pre- 
eminent among the bacon-hog types. 
570. History in England. — The _large-Yorkshire_un- 
doubtedly descended from a race of large, coarse-boned, 
leggy, white hogs, that were common in Yorkshire and 
adjacent counties for so long a time that we have no 
definite knowledge of their origin., These coarse white 
hogs possessed the merit of size, and hence it was possible 
to improve them by crossing with finer breeds, and still 
retain plenty of size in the improved type. It is only 
within the past sixty or seventy years that any marked 
improvement was effected in the Large White hogs of 
450
-P-A-G-E-501
  THE BACON BREEDS OF SWINE 451 
Yorkshire./ According to Sidney, the first important step 
was the crossing of the Yorkshire with the white Leicester, 
a large breed, but finer in bone, and more easily fattened 
than the original Yorkshire. Perhaps the most important | 
improvement was effected by crossing with the Small 
Whites, or, as they are now called in America, the Small 
Yorkshires. These small, fine-boned, easily fattened hogs 
produced a very marked improvement in the old York- 
shire, which has been still further improved and brought 
up to its present high standard of excellence by judicious 
selection in the hands of skillful breeders. 
571. History in America. — Large White hogs have been 
brought to the United States at different times during the 
past century, but-the improved type of Large Yorkshires 
can scarcely be said to have attained a standing in the 
United States until 1892. Among the first to import 
them into Canada were some of the packing houses, who 
brought them into the country for the purpose of improv- 
ing the bacon qualities of Canadian hogs. During the 
, past twenty or twenty-five years, the breed has made 
wonderful progress in Canada, and has more animals 
recorded in the Canadian record than any other breed. 
572. Description. —'The Large Yorkshire is one of the 
largest breeds of swine. The snout is of medium length, 
and should possess little or no dish, although there is a 
moderate dish in the face. The jowl is of good width and 
muscular, but it should not be flabby, nor heavily loaded 
with fat. The ears are rather large, and sometimes in- 
clined forward, especially in old animals, but they should 
be firmly attached to the head, should not be coarse, and 
should be fringed with fine hair. The shoulder and back 
are only of medium width, the side is long, and the ham 
carries very little surface fat, making it lighter than the  
-P-A-G-E-502
452 THE BREEDS QF LIVE-STOCK 
ham of the fat or lard type of hog. The flesh of the ham 
should be carried well round the inside of the thigh, and 
the ham generally shows a tapering appearance toward 
the hock. The bone is fairly heavy, but should be clean 
and flinty in appearance. The leg is longer than the leg 
ee H of the fat hog. The color is 
white. Black hair on any 
part should disqualify. Black 
or blue spots on the skin do 
not disqualify, but are ob- 
jected to, and the aim of 
breeders is to reduce these 
spots to a minimum. In the 
description of the snout of the Large Yorkshire, the stand- 
ard of excellence prepared by the American Yorkshire 
Club falls short of the ideal of the best breeders of the 
present day. The short, turned-up snout is no longer 
popular, although it is very frequently seen (Figs. 96, 97). 
573. Types. — Large Yorkshires vary more or less in 
type, and it requires skill in 
selection to keep them true 
to the best type. Some 
years ago, it was common to 
find Large Yorkshires with 
very short, turned-up snouts. 
This style of snout is gener- 
ally associated with a rather 
heavy jowl, neck and shoulder, which, from a bacon 
standpoint, are very objectionable. Another type, which 
is frequently seen, has a long, scrawny neck, narrow chest 
and long coarse-boned legs. This type is generally very 
long in the side and smooth in the shoulder, both very 
desirable features from a bacon curer’s standpoint; but 
  Fig. 96.— Large Yorkshire boar. 
  Fie. 97.— Large Yorkshire sow.
-P-A-G-E-503
THE BACON BREEDS OF SWINE 453 
it has too much bone and too coarse a skin, and lacks in 
quantity and quality of flesh. It is also a somewhat slow 
feeder, and is therefore objectionable from a farmer’s 
standpoint. The most desirable type has sufficient length 
of side to make a good packer’s hog, and has constitution 
and quality to such a marked degree that it is unexcelled 
from a feeder’s standpoint. 
574. Uses of Large Yorkshire hogs. — As previously 
intimated, the Large Yorkshire is especially valued for 
bacon-production, where a long side abounding in lean 
meat, and a light shoulder and neck are especially desir- 
able. The large size and strong bone of this breed make 
it valuable for crossing on breeds that have become un- 
' duly fine in the bone, and lack size. It crosses remark- 
ably well with the Berkshire, Chester-White and Poland- 
China, as well as other fat breeds, increasing the size and 
the proportion of lean meat without impairing the feed- 
ing qualities. 
The Large Yorkshire is frequently spoken of as being 
“slower maturing ”’ than the fat types of hogs, but this 
is not a fair way of stating the case. From the bacon 
curer’s standpoint, the breed will reach desirable market 
weight and condition at as early an age as any existing 
breed, and there are few breeds that equal it in this respect. 
Therefore, from the standpoint of the farmer who is feed- 
ing hogs for the bacon trade, no breed excels the York- 
shire in point of early maturity. For the production of a 
fat carcass at an early age, however, the Large Yorkshire 
is not so well adapted. It is a special-purpose breed, and 
must be regarded as such. 
From the fact that the Large Yorkshire grows rapidly 
‘and develops bone and muscle more readily than it 
develops fat, feeders are inclined to regard it as an expen-   
 
-P-A-G-E-504
454 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
sive hog to feed. Careful experiments go to show that 
such is not the case, and that, under most circumstances, 
it is capable of giving as good results for food consumed 
as any other breed. . It is, perhaps, not so well adapted to 
grazing as some other breeds, and a hot sun is likely to 
blister the skin. It is probable, too, that an exclusive 
corn ration would not agree with it so well as with some 
other breeds that have been developed especially to con- 
sume corn. The Large Yorkshire has been developed in a 
country where a mixed ration is used, and where feeding 
in pens is largely practiced; and under such conditions it 
gives an excellent account of the food it consumes. 
For quality of bacon, the Large Yorkshire is rivaled 
only by the Tamworth. The large proportion of lean to 
fat, the thick, fleshy belly and great length of side, render 
the breed peculiarly desirable from a bacon curer’s and a 
consumer’s standpoint. At the Provincial Winter Fair, 
held annually at Guelph, Canada, there is the largest 
exhibit of bacon carcasses of any show in existence, and the 
Yorkshires and Yorkshire grades always carry off the 
largest share of the prizes. 
Large Yorkshire sows are very prolific, and are splendid 
nurses. The boars are exceptionally prepotent and stamp 
their character and color on their progeny to a remarkable 
degree, no matter what they are crossed with. 
575. Distribution. — On the American continent, Large 
Yorkshires have made the greatest progress in Canada, 
owing to the fact that Canadians have been paying special 
attention to the production of bacon hogs. In the United 
States, their progress has been comparatively slow, and’ 
it is doubtful whether they will ever attain a high degree 
of popularity, especially in the corn-belt, where the fat 
type of hog seems better adapted to prevailing conditions.
-P-A-G-E-505
THE BACON BREEDS OF SWINE 455 
Minnesota is the headquarters for the breed, and they are 
also found in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, New 
York, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Virginia, Massachu- 
setts and some other states. In Canada, they are to be 
found in every province, Ontario taking the lead. 
Large Yorkshires occupy a very important place in 
Denmark, and there are comparatively few countries of 
any importance, from a live-stock standpoint, where the 
breed is not represented. 
576. Organizations and records. —The American York- 
shire Club was organized in 1892, and the first herd-book 
was published in 1901. Five herd-books have been pub- 
lished, in which 22,000 animals are recorded. In Canada, 
Yorkshires are recorded in the Dominion Swine Breeders’ 
Record. For further information regarding Canadian 
records, see under Berkshires. 
TamwortH Swine. Plate XV. 
By G. E. Day 
577. Tamworth swine are of the bacon type, and as 
such have been accorded a high place by breeders. They 
are much more popular in Canada than in the United 
States. 
578. History in England. — The Tamworth takes its 
name from Tamworth, in Staffordshire, England, but is 
also to be found in adjoining counties. It is of ancient 
and uncertain origin, and there seems to be no well authen- 
ticated account of where it came from. As first known, 
it was an extremely leggy, narrow type of hog, but it has 
been greatly improved during the past thirty years. 
Whether this improvement was wrought solely by selec-
-P-A-G-E-506
456 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
tion, or whether cross-breeding was resorted to, is uncer- 
tain. Professor Long favors the theory that the Tam- 
worth was crossed with some white breed, but apparently 
no proof exists as to the correctness or incorrectness of 
this claim. Although it is one of the oldest English breeds, 
it was not given a separate class at the Royal Agricultural 
Society’s Show until 1885. 
579. History in America. — Representatives of the 
Tamworth breed were brought to the United States nearly 
thirty years ago, but the breed does not make rapid 
progress. The long snout tends to prejudice the average 
farmer, and the fact that the production of bacon hogs 
receives little or no encouragement in the United States 
also tends to work against the general adoption of the breed. 
Like the Large Yorkshire, the Tamworth was brought 
to Canada by the packers about 1888, with a view to 
improving the bacon qualities of Canadian hogs, and 
large numbers have been imported by Canadian breeders 
during the past twenty years. The Tamworth has not 
attained the degree of popularity in Canada that is en- 
joyed by the Yorkshire, although it is always well rep- 
resented at the leading Canadian fairs. 
580. Description. — According to the standard of excel- 
lence adopted by the National Pig Breeders’ Association 
of Great Britain, the Tamworth should have “ golden red 
hair on a flesh-colored skin, free from black.” However, 
the shade of red varies considerably in individuals, and a 
chestnut shade is very common. In aged animals, it is 
not uncommon to see such a dark shade of chestnut that 
the casual observer might mistake it for a dull black. 
The snout is long and straight, and the ear large, and 
somewhat more pointed than the Yorkshire ear. The 
ears should be firmly attached to the head. The jowl is
-P-A-G-E-507
  
THE BACON BREEDS OF SWINE 457 
narrower and lighter than that of the Yorkshire, the neck 
and shoulder are light, the back and loin of medium 
width, and the side of good length and only moderately 
deep. Deficiency of ham is a common weakness of the 
Tamworth. Since the Tamworth belongs to the bacon 
type, it is not desirable that it should have a heavy, fat — 
ham like a fat hog; but the ham is often lacking seriously 
even from a bacon standpoint, and the breeders are mak- 
ing an effort to strengthen this point. The Tamworth is 
a large hog, strong in the bone, and looks leggy beside a 
hog of the fat type. The Tamworth and Large Yorkshire 
are similar in size, and are the two leading breeds of the 
bacon type (Plate XV). 
581. Uses of Tamworth hogs.— The Tamworth is 
especially adapted to the production of bacon. Its light 
shoulder, neck and head, its good length of side, and its 
tendency to produce a large proportion of lean to fat, 
render it well suited to the bacon curer’s requirements. 
Being a large breed, and strong in the bone, it has become 
popular for crossing on finer and fatter breeds in districts 
where it is well known. A cross between the Tamworth 
and the Berkshire is very popular in Canada. 
As to early maturity, it is similar to the Large York- 
shire. For producing fat carcasses at an early age, it is 
unsuitable, as this is not the purpose for which it is bred. 
It will reach suitable weight for the bacon curer, however, 
at as early an age as any of the fat breeds, and will not 
carry the excessive fat which renders the fat breeds un- 
suitable for bacon purposes. For bacon-production, 
therefore, it matures early, and it is from the bacon stand- 
point that the Tamworth must always be judged. 
There is a popular belief among farmers that the Tam- 
worth does not make economical use of food. A good
-P-A-G-E-508
  458 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
deal of this prejudice is due to the appearance of the 
animal, and the man who is used to the short, thick, fine- 
boned type of hog, finds difficulty in reconciling himself 
to a hog of Tamworth type. Experiments show, how- 
ever, that the Tamworth is capable of making good use 
of the food it consumes, and that it compares very favor- 
ably with other breeds in this respect. Like the York- 
shire, it is rather better adapted to pen feeding than to 
pasture. It has been impossible to secure much informa- 
tion regarding its ability to stand exclusive corn-feeding. 
Available information indicates that the breed is not par- 
ticularly well adapted to this purpose. 
It is asserted by some persons that Tamworths produce 
higher class bacon than any other breed, but this is too 
sweeping an assertion, and when they have come together 
in dressed-carcass competitions, the Large Yorkshire has 
won the largest share of prizes. There is no question, 
however, that the Tamworth produces excellent bacon, 
which is well mixed with lean of fine quality. The Large 
Yorkshire and Tamworth are the only strictly bacon 
breeds with which we are familiar in America. , 
Tamworth sows are prolific and are good mothers. The 
boars are prepotent, but perhaps scarcely equal to the 
Large Yorkshire in this respect. According to Shaw, the 
Tamworth as compared with the Chester-White shows 
greater adaptability, is more active as a grazer, more 
hardy, and produces a superior quality of bacon. The 
Chester-White is heavier at maturity and ready for slaugh- 
ter at an earlier age. 
582. Distribution. — As already stated, the Tamworth 
has not made rapid progress in the United States, although 
representatives are to be found in Illinois, Kentucky, 
Iowa, Kansas, Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio. In Canada,
-P-A-G-E-509
  
ee THE BACON BREEDS OF SWINE 459 
it is more numerous in Ontario than in any other province, 
but it is to be found in practically every province. Eng- 
land and Canada are the two leading countries in the 
production of this breed. 
583. Organizations and records. — The American Tam- 
worth Swine Record Association was organized in 1897. 
The first volume of the herd-book was published in 1903. 
In Canada, Tamworths are recorded in the Dominion 
Swine Breeders’ Record. 
In Great Britain, Tamworth swine are recorded in the 
herd-book of the National Pig Breeders’ Association.

CHAPTER XVIII 
LESSER KNOWN BREEDS OF SWINE 
By G. E. Day 
584. There are certain little-known breeds or types of 
hogs that are of interest historically, or in restricted areas. 
In order to make the discussion of swine in this book more 
nearly complete, brief notes on several of these breeds are 
introduced. ; 
585. Historic breeds. — It is an old opinion, apparently 
well substantiated, that the English swine, from which 
the modern American types are derived, sprang from 
breeds introduced from the East, as Chinese, Neapolitan 
and Siamese pigs. Even in such a noted live-stock coun- 
try as Great Britain, the pigs of less than a century ago 
were, on the whole, a rather undesirable lot, according to 
descriptions that have been handed down to us. Long 
legs, general coarseness and slow fattening propensities 
were then commonly characteristic of British breeds. It 
is out of the question, even if it were desirable, to attempt 
to trace all the steps that led to the establishment of 
British breeds as we know them to-day, but there is no 
doubt that much of the improvement came from the in- 
troduction of foreign breeds, which were crossed on the 
native stock. Although these foreign breeds are now 
practically unknown in Great Britain and America, there 
are three breeds whose influence has been so far-reaching 
as to render them worthy of at least a passing notice. 
460 
 
-P-A-G-E-511
LESSER KNOWN BREEDS OF SWINE 461 
The introduction into England of these Chinese, Nea- 
politan and Siamese pigs wrought a revolution among the 
earlier types of swine, and the crossing and inter-crossing 
of various types, which followed the introduction of foreign 
blood, and which is too intricate and too little known to 
admit of complete investigation, resulted eventually in the 
English breeds of the present day. ; 
Chinese, Neapolitan and Siamese swine were also im- 
ported into the United States. The great bulk of Ameri- 
can foundation stock came from Great Britain, especially 
England, and as was the case in England, the use of 
Chinese, Neapolitan and other similar blood, followed by 
the crossing of various local types, has led to the establish- 
ment of what are known as American breeds. 
586. Chinese swine. — Youatt writes of these swine as 
follows: “ There are two distinct varieties, the white and 
the black; both fatten readily, but from their diminutive 
size attain no great weight. They are small in limb, 
round in body, short in the head, wide in the cheek, and 
high in the chine; covered with very fine bristles growing 
from an exceedingly thin skin; and not peculiarly sym- 
metrical, for, when fat, the head is so buried in the neck 
that little more than the tip of the snout is visible. The 
pure Chinese hog is too delicate and susceptible to cold 
ever to become a really profitable animal in this country 
(England); it is difficult to rear, and the sows are not 
good nurses, but one or two judicious crosses have in a 
manner naturalized it. . .. Many valuable crosses have 
been made with these animals; for the prevalent fault of 
the old English breeds having been coarseness of flesh, 
unwieldiness of form, and want of aptitude to fatten, an 
admixture of the Chinese breed has materially corrected 
these defects.’ Youatt’s description is so clear that it 
 
-P-A-G-E-512
  462 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
requires no explanation, and it is easy to understand how 
this extremely fine hog would help to correct the faults - 
the coarse English pigs. 
587. Neapolitan swine.— This breed came from the 
country about Naples in Italy, and was also of the ex- 
tremely fine-boned, easily fattened type. It is especially 
noted for the part it played in the formation of what is 
now known as the Essex breed, although other breeds 
were influenced, either directly or indirectly, by the blood 
of this remarkably quick-maturing breed. j 
588. Siamese swine. — A. B. Allen, who bred Siamese 
swine many years ago, describes them in part as follows: 
“They varied in color from deep, rich plum to dark slate 
and black; had two to three white feet, but no white on 
the legs or other parts of the body. The head was short 
and fine, with a dished face and rather thin jowl; ears 
short, slender and erect; shoulders and hams round, 
smooth and extra large; back broad and slightly arched ; 
body of moderate length, deep, well ribbed up and nearly 
as round as a barrel; . . . legs fine and short; hair soft, 
silky and thin; no bristles, even on boars; .. . flesh 
firm, sweet and very tender, with less lean than in the 
Berkshire.” 
~ 589. Large Black swine.— The Large Black, as its 
name implies, is a large breed, all black in color, and 
possessing very large drooping ears. In general confor- 
mation it approaches the bacon type, having a good length 
of side, medium width of back and shoulder, a rather light 
neck and jowl, and fairly heavy bone. 
The origin of the breed is not well eat but it has 
been bred for a great many years in the east and south of 
England. It is hardly known outside of England, and is 
not widely distributed even in England, being confined
-P-A-G-E-513
LESSER KNOWN BREEDS OF SWINE 463 
mainly to the southern part of the country. Some years 
ago, representatives of the breed were brought to the 
Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa, Canada, but did 
not prove very satisfactory. At present, the breed is 
practically not represented on the American continent. 
The main claims for the Large Black are its bacon 
qualities, its fecundity and its value as a scavenger. Its 
bacon is highly esteemed in England, containing, ‘as it 
does, a large percentage of lean. It is worthy of note, 
_ however, that at Ottawa the bacon of the Large Black 
was not equal to that of the Large Yorkshire or the Tam- 
worth. The sows are excellent nurses, and the breed is 
regarded as a first-class farmer’s breed in England. 
The interests of the breed in England are looked after 
by “The Large Black Pig Society of Great Britain.” 
This organization publishes the only herd-book for the 
breed. : 
~ 590. Middle White or Middle Yorkshire swine (Plate 
XVI. Fig. 98).— The Middle White, as the name im- 
plies, is intermediate in type 
between the Large White 
and the Small White. It is 
recognized in England as a 
distinct breed, but it is a 
difficult breed to describe, 
because of its variations. é uN, 
Some representatives of the 4,4. 98. — Middle White boar. 
breed might easily pass as 
Large Whites, and from this extreme they shade down 
nearly all the way to the Small White type. There is 
little doubt that many so-called Large White pigs carry 
some Middle White blood, and that many Middle Whites, 
or pigs containing a large percentage of Middle White 
 
-P-A-G-E-514
  ‘ i 
464 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
blood, have been brought to America and passed as Large 
Whites. Generally speaking, they are smaller than the 
Large Whites, have a shorter side, shorter leg, finer bone 
and a heavier neck and jowl. They usually have a shorter 
snout than the Large White, and have more dish in snout 
and face. They belong to the fat type of hog. 
The Middle White originated from a cross between the 
Large White and the Small White breeds. Even at present, 
pigs may appear in Large White litters that are classed by 
their breeders as Middle Whites, so that it sometimes 
happens that Large Whites and Middle Whites may come 
from the same litter, especially in those herds in which 
Middle White blood is occasionally used to refine the Large 
White. Sometimes Middle Whites are produced by one 
cross of Small Whites on Large Whites, and animals pro- 
duced in this way should scarcely be regarded as a distinct - 
breed. 
The Middle White is unknown outside of its native _ 
country, and if any have been brought to America, they 
were introduced under the name of Large Yorkshire. 
The utility of the Middle White is necessarily limited. 
The practice of crossing, followed by many breeders, has 
told against the usefulness of the breed. Middle Whites 
which have been bred pure for a number of generations 
would no doubt prove satisfactory, but so many of them 
possess recent crosses of other blood, that the breed as\a 
whole lacks prepotency and trueness to type. The mix- 
ing of Middle White blood with that of Large White, as 
practiced by many English breeders, cannot be too 
strongly condemned. A so-called Large Yorkshire boar 
produced in this way may look more attractive to the in- 
experienced breeder of Large Yorkshires than a pure Large 
Yorkshire, but he makes a very unsatisfactory sire.
-P-A-G-E-515
LESSER KNOWN BREEDS OF SWINE 465 
Breeders of Large Yorkshires soon learn to avoid boars 
showing any evidence of Middle White blood. 
591. Lincolnshire Curly-coated swine.— This breed 
takes its name from Lincolnshire, in England, where it has 
been bred for many years. Though an old breed, it did 
not receive recognition until within comparatively recent 
years. It has now a herd-book society of its own, and 
Sul     
Fic. 99.— Razorback sow with litter. 
is the most recent addition to the recognized pure breeds 
of swine in Great Britain. 
The Lincolnshire Curly-coated is a large white breed, 
with curly hair, and long thin ears which cover the eyes 
and snout. It is claimed for these pigs that they are 
hardy, thrifty, quick growers, and that the sows are prolific, 
and good milkers. 
As yet, they are not much known outside of their native 
county. y 
‘592. Razorback swine (Fig. 99).— Whether it is 
strictly correct to call the “ Razorback ” a distinct breed 
may be open to question, but since it represents a type of 
hog existing | in some ‘parts of the United States, it should 
receive passing notice. 
The “ Razorback ” is characterized ie totigt coarse legs 
and snout; coarse ears, coarse skin and a bristly coat; 
narrow Bale, slab sides, no hams worth mentioning, and 
2H 
 
-P-A-G-E-516
466 THE BREEDS OF LIVE-STOCK 
an absence of any tendency to fatten. In spite of its un- 
desirable qualities, it is more or less amenable to improve- 
ment, and some of the finer breeds, notably the Essex, 
have been crossed on it with a fair degree of success. Its 
hardiness and its ability to look after itself are its main * 
recommendations. 
There is little doubt that the “ Razorback” is a de-. 
generate descendant of pigs brought into the country*by 
the earliest white settlers. Hunger, exposure and the 
necessity for looking after itself and foraging its own living 
have been the chief factors in evolving the type. 
The “ Razorback” is now found almost exclusively in 
a comparatively limited area of the South, and this area 
is becoming more and more restricted as improved agri- 
culture advances. It is only a question of time until the 
type entirely disappears.

PREFACE 
Tuts book has been written in the ever strengthening 
conviction that psychology is most naturally, consistently, 
and effectively treated as a study of conscious selves in 
relation to other selves and to external objects—in a 
word, to their environment, personal and impersonal. 
However he defines his science, every psychologist talks 
and writes about selves—of myself and yourself — as con- 
scious of people, of things, or of laws and formule. The 
psycholog: y of self, which this book sets forth, is a con- 
scious adoption 1 and scientific exposition of this natural 
and practically inevitable conception. 
The book differs in several ways from its predecessor, 
“An Introduction to Psychology.” In general, 1, I have 
tried to make a simpler, directer approach to the subject. 
In the earlier book, I treated psychology in a twofold 
fashion, both as science of selves and as science of ideas 
(or ‘mental processes’), discussing all forms of conscious- 
ness from both points of view. I have here abandoned 
this double treatment, with the intent to simplify exposi- 
tion, not because I doubt the validity of psychology as study 
of ideas, but because I question the significance and the 
adequacy, and deprecate the abstractness, of the science 
thus conceived. In a second fashion this book differs from 
the other. I have tried to embody what appear to me to 
be the important results of so-called functional psychology. 
That is to say, I have taken explicit account of the charac- 
vii
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii Preface 
teristic bodily reactions on environment which accompany 
perception, thought, emotion, and will; and I have briefly 
considered the various forms of ynanesitas as factors in 
conduct, and as significant in individual and in social de- 
velopment. The order of topics has been radically changed. 
I have included in the Appendix the sections on the physi- 
ology of nervous system and sense organs, and on abnor- 
mal consciousness, as well as the brief discussions of moot 
points in psychology. The consideration of the different 
classes of elements of consciousness instead of being massed 
together at the beginning of the book, have been introduced 
singly, as subordinate parts of the chapters, or groups of 
chapters, on perception and imagination, recognition, and 
thought, emotion and will. 
This is, then, a new book, not the condensation of an old 
one; yet it does not teach a new form of psychology. The 
same conception of psychology underlies the two; and I 
have not scrupled to transfer, though seldom without some 
change, pages, paragraphs, and sentences from the earlier 
book. 
' Time would fail me to name all the people whose help 
in the preparation of this book I gratefully remember. 
My greatest indebtedness is to Professor Eleanor A. McC. 
Gamble, for her discriminating criticism of the book as a 
whole. My warm thanks are due, also, to my colleague, 
Dr. Helen Dodd Cook, and to my former colleague, Pro- 
fessor L. W. Cole, for their ctitical reading of portions of 
the text. And I am glad of this opportunity to acknowl- 
edge the expert assistance of Miss Helen G. Hood, who 
has prepared the Index.

  PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 
Many minor changes have been made in the second edi- 
tion of this book, but none of them affect its essential teach- 
ing, and only one—the transfer of a paragraph from page 
89 to page 92 at the end of Chapter V.— alters the paging. 
The more important changes are, perhaps, the following : a 
restatement (pp. 12-14) of the distinction between percep- 
tion and imagination ; a withdrawal (p. 147) of the teaching 
that negative judgments are always analytic; a new sum- 
mary (p. 91) of the forms of bodily reaction ; a more accu- 
rate statement (p. 305) of the detail of the Franklin color- 
theory ; additions (pp. 283, 284) to the Bibliography; and 
the substitution of a few new review questions in the last 
section of the book. 
JANUARY, IQII. 
PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION 
THE present revision of this book has been made with 
three main ends in view: to emphasize the essentially 
social nature of the conscious self, to accentuate the fact 
that the study of the self, as thus conceived, involves a 
study of behavior, and finally to prune the book of expres- 
sions which lend themselves to interpretation in terms of 
an atomistic psychology. The first end has been sought 
. ix
-P-A-G-E-10
  x Preface to the Third Edition 
not only by the addition of sentences, paragraphs, and 
pages (10, 92 ff., 179, 183), but by the transfer of the 
contents of the chapter formerly devoted to ‘the social 
consciousness’ to other portions of the book (pp. 98 ff., 
251 ff.). This change was made lest the separate treat- 
ment of the social consciousness obscure the truth that 
consciousness is through and through social. The second 
end has been furthered by adding to Chapter V. a sec- 
tion on ‘Habit’ and sections — consisting in part of pas- 
sages transferred from the Appendix— on ‘Instinct’ and 
‘Learning.’ 
All these are shiftings of emphasis and of position, and 
involve no amendment, but rather a reénforcement, of the 
original teaching of the book. Changes in conception will 
be found in the discussions of attention (pp. 104 f., 112), 
of volition structurally analyzed (pp. 231 ff.), and of the 
consciousness of time (pp. 85, 140, 231, 330). The enu- 
meration which follows is an incomplete list of the pages 
containing further additions or corrections: pp. 3 f., 14, 
35 £., 41, 71, 143, 150, 158, 163, 183, 185 ff., 217, 226, 232, 
233, 247, 252f.,333f. From page 90 onward the number- 
ing of pages has of necessity been altered, yet by. far the 
greater number of pages are entirely or essentially un- 
changed. 
It is perhaps permissible to state explicitly that the book 
is intended for two classes of students and readers. Those 
for whom psychology is primarily (in the words of William 
McDougall) ‘the essential common foundation on which 
all the social sciences must be built up’ will do well, cer- 
tainly in their first reading, to omit Chapters III. and IV.,
-P-A-G-E-11
Preface to the Third Edition xi 
and all save the last section of the Appendix. Those, 
however, to whom psychology is not only a means but an 
end, should be aided by the specific references, topic by 
topic, to the manuals of experimental psychology, by the 
bibliographies (amplified in this edition by the Supple- 
ment, pp. 411 ff.), and by the Summaries, in the Appendix, 
of the recent literature, experimental and theoretical, on 
such difficult and disputed topics as the space-conscious- 
ness (pp. 336-352), the relational consciousness (pp. 362 ff.), 
and the Wundtian theory of the affective elements (pp. 
370 ff.). 
I venture to add, in conclusion, a comment on the proper 
use of a text-book in psychology. I am confident that the 
reading of every chapter should be preceded, accompanied, 
and followed by independent introspection and observa- 
tion. To this end I urgently recommend the use of pre- 
liminary questions, such as those which are formulated on 
page 11, of review questions similar to those which are 
gathered together at the close of the book, and, so far as 
possible, of experiments performed by students themselves. 
PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION 
Tue chief changes of detail in this edition are the fol- 
lowing: the completer description and classification of the 
different forms of attention (pp. 105 05 ff.) and of c conception i 
(pp. 147 £.); and the discussion (p. 181) of emotion di- 
ny Other_changes, including a second Supplement _to the bibliography, ¢ occur 
on pages 40, 44 f,, 67, 75 f., 91, 228, i 237, 290, 308,   
  
403, 413.

  xii Preface to the Fourth Edition 
More significant than any of these Beth cation and 
corrections is the use of the HC ie osu ‘consciousness’ as 
synonym for ‘personal attitude” or or ‘the self’s relatedness 
to_its objects.’ From this follows. the “conception of the 
sensational, affective and relational ‘elements’ (the so- 
called ‘structural elements’ of consciousness) as constitu- Pee 
ents of all fo f the telatednéss of self. to its objects. 
This allows the abandonment of my earlier view (a survival, 
in my thinking, of ‘idea-psychology’) that these elements 
are discovered only by an analysis of consciousness which 
leaves the self out of account. My critics have not failed 
to point out the inconsistency of this conception for one 
who insists, as I insist, that psychology is a science of 
self; and I believe that my present treatment of the sub- 
ject meets the objection. The altered passages in the 
text occur on pages 1, 3, 14, 140, 182-3, 232. The most 
consecutive consideration of the subject will be found in the 
Appendix on pages 330-334 of Section III. The expression 
‘structural element’ is used as a purely conventional desig- 
nation of the sensational, affective, and relational elements 
taken together. I ought perhaps to apologize for retaining 
the term when I deny its metaphorical implication. 
A second change which must be noted is the conception 
(pages 231, 245-247) of the consciousness of realness no 
longer as an attributive element, parallel with the affec- 
tions, but aS equivalent to the experience of congruence 
or harmony and thus as belonging among the relational 
elements of consciousness. 
I take advantage, in conclusion, of this opportunity to 
comment briefly on certain questions of terminology. If 
I were writing this book de novo I should throughout refer 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  Preface to the Fourth Edition xiii 
to the sensational, affective, and relational elements in 
such a way as to emphasize the fact that they are found 
through analysis of consciousness conceived as relation 
of self to object. Thus, Ishould use the expressions ‘seeing 
colors,’ ‘hearing tone-qualities,’ ‘liking,’ ‘distinguishing,’ 
along with, or even in place of, the parallel expressions, 
‘visual and auditory qualities,’ ‘affective element of pleasant- 
ness,’ ‘relational element of difference.’ The reader is asked 
to supply these expressions in the appropriate contexts. 
Some allusion should be made, in the second place, to the 
possibility of confusing the ‘relational elements,’ just re- 
ferred to, with the more fundamental relations of self to 
object which I have called ‘personal attitudes.’ If I were re- 
writing the book I should be tempted (for the sake of avoid- 
ing this ambiguity) to renew my search, thus far unavail- 
ing, among the many synonyms of the term ‘relational ele- 
ment,’ for one which would serve as well. I must, however, 
here content myself with calling attention to the difficulty. 
Another verbal change which I should gladly have 
made concerns the use of the term ‘imagination.’ This 
might profitably be employed in the popular sense, to refer 
to the consciousness of particular, absent objects, personal 
as well as impersonal. The verbal noun imaging might 
then be used (in the sense to which this book actually 
limits the word ‘imagination’) to refer to the conscious- 
ness of impersonal and particular absent objects. 
Finally, I wish to call attention to th » fact that “experi- 
ence’ is employed through this book as synonym for ‘con- 
sciousness.’ This convenient usageis perhapsphilosophically 
ambiguous but presents no difficulty to the psychologist.

A FIRST BOOK IN PSYCHOLOGY 
CHAPTER I 
   
  INTRODUCTION: THE NATURE, METHODS, AND USES OF 
PSYCHOLOGY 
I. THe ‘NATURE or PsycHOLOGY 
PsycHotocy has most often been defined as science of 
consciousness, but this definition does not go far enough. 
For consciousness does not occur impersonally. Con- 
sciousness, on the contrary, always is a somebody-being-con- 
scious. There is never perception without 'a somebody who 
perceives, and there never is thinking unless some one thinks. 
And this somebody is not an isolated self but a self which 
is affected from without and which expresses itself in its 
behavior. In view of these facts psychology is more 
exactly defined as /ecience of the self in relation to, or 
conscious of, its environment.! /

observer pick up, each, a stone from the roadside. The 
latter will tell you that he has found a big, smooth, gray 
stone. The former describes his stone as a smoothed and 
striated boulder of granite, rich in mica, and explains it as 
dropped from some glacier. Similarly, the unscientific ob- 
server of consciousness tells you that he better remembers 
Booth’s Hamlet than Patti’s Lucia. His psychologically 
trained friend will describe the memory of Hamiet as a case of 
visual imagination, distinguishing it as more intense than the 
auditory imagination of Patti’s singing; and will explain the 
difference as due to the fact that he has been trained to draw, 
whereas he does not know one note from another. In a word, 
the scientist in each of these cases first describes phenomena, 
that is, observes them analytically, compares, and classifies 
them; and he next seeks, if he can, to explain phenomena — in 
these cases, the stone by the roadside and the vivid memory. 
This attempt to distinguish science from everyday observa- 
tion must be followed by an effort to mark off science from 
philosophy, for the psychologist, it must be confessed, is 
sometimes tempted to overstep the border. In brief, the 
distinction is 1 is this: philosophy seeks to discover the ultimate 
or irreducible nature of any (or of all) reality, whereas a   
science voluntarily limits itself to one group of facts, takes for 
granted the existence of codrdinate groups, and does not; seek >   to reduce one to the other or both to any deeper kind of reali 
‘The philosopher, for example, asks whether mind is a func- > 
tion of matter, or matter an expression of mind, or whether 
both are manifestations of a more ultimate reality, whereas 
the psychologist takes for granted, on the basis of ordinary 
observation, that minds and material objects exist. 
Psychology has been defined as science of the self-being-
-P-A-G-E-25
The Nature of Psychology 3 
conscious; and we rightly therefore ask for a further de- 
‘scription, even if only a preliminary description, of the self. 
The conscious self of each one of us is not a reality which 
is merely inferred to exist: it is immediately experienced 
as possessed of at least four fundamental characters. I 
immediately experience myself as (x) relatively persistent — 
in other words, I am in some sense the same as my childhood 
self; as (2) complex —I am a perceiving, remembering, 
feeling, willing self; as (3) a unique, an irreplaceable self — 
Tam closely like father, brother, or friend, but Iam, after all, 
only myself: (there is only one of me) I-experience myself 
(4) as related to (or, conscious of) objects either personal or 
impersonal. For example, I am fond of my mother (rela- 
tion to a personal object) and I am tasting an orange (re- 
lation to an impersonal object). It would be impossible to 
enumerate all the ‘personal attitudes’ or relations of self to 
its objects. The following, however, are fundamental and 
will be named again and again in the description of different 
formsof consciousness: receptivity and activity ; sympathy, 
in the wide sense of the consciousness of community of ex- 
perience; attention in its modifications: egoism, that is, 
attention to myself, and altruism, or attention to my object. 
My relation to a personal object is called a social relation. 
As the last sentences have indicated, a person or an imper- 
sonal fact, to which the self is related, is called its object — 
that of which it is conscious. And every. such object, 
whether personal or impersonal, may be further distinguished 
as either private or public (common) object. The com- 
mon, or public, personal object of any self is some other self. 
For example, President Taft, as he greets me at a White 
House reception, is my personal object — but my common, 
   
-P-A-G-E-26
  4 A First Book in Psychology 
not my private or peculiar object, since the sight of him 
is shared by all the other people in the line behind me. 
‘When, on the other hand, I am conscious of myself as, for 
instance, enchanted to meet the President — I am my own 
personal and private object; that is to say, I am conscious 
of myself in a peculiar way in which no one else is conscious 
of me. Within the class, also, of impersonal objects a dis- 
tinction may be made between private and common objects, 
that is, between (a) my experiences — my feelings, for exam- 
ple — regarded as peculiarly mine and (0) impersonal objects 
of anybody’s consciousness, such as chemical formule and 
sidewalks. And there is, finally, the important distinction 
between externalized and non-externalized impersonal’ ob- 
jects. Thus, the sidewalk is an externalized object, that is, 
it is conceived as if independent of any and of all selves. 
On the other hand, neither my feeling, a private impersonal 
object, nor the chemical formula, a common object, is ex- 
ternalized. Rather, each is realized as experience — the 
feeling as the experience which one self has, the formula as 
the common experience of many selves. 
The distinctions which the last paragraphs have made may 
be summarized in the following way : — ,

  The Nature of Psychology 5 
The establishment of these distinctions between objects 
of consciousness serves thus to differentiate groups of sci- 
‘ences. It appears that psychology deals with ‘private ob-_ 
ee) primarily with my particular, intimately known ‘own 
self,’ but also with percepts, thoughts, and feelings as they 
appear to me and to nobody else. The concern of Sociology _ 
on the other hand is with selves as common, or universal, 
phenomena, objects of anybody’s consciousness ; and logic 
and mathematics deal with thoughts — with arithmetical 1 
rules and logical axioms, for example — which are public” 
property, parts of common experience. ‘Sharply distin- 
guished from all these are the physical sciences which con- 
cern themselves with externalized objects — with plants, 
animals, stones, acids, falling bodies. Three further state- 
ments must be made concerning the different sorts of 
object: First, I am always, inattentively or attentively, 
conscious of the private, personal object, myself, whateva 
the other objects of my consciousness. Second, there afe 
certain externalized objects, in particular my body, of 
which I am so persistently and attentively conscious that 
I often seem to regard them as part of myself. And, ~~~] 
finally, preéminent among the objects of my environment, 
are the other selves with whom I find myself in close and 
constant relation. I cannot indeed adequately describe 
myself except in terms of these social relations as child of 
my parents, friend of my friends, citizen of the state. 
It must be pointed out that certain real difficulties at- 
tend this classification of the self’s objects. There is, 
first, the difficulty of conceiving the self as both subject 
and object. And there is, second, the difficulty involved 
in conceiving the ‘thing,’ the externalized object, as in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  6 A First Book in Psychology 
dependent of all selves, when yet the self is related to it 
and conscious of it. But both these are difficulties only for 
the metaphysician. The psychologist who, like every scien- 
tist, must accept certain facts, without looking for their ulti- 
mate explanation, rests in the first case on the immediate 
certainty that I am conscious of myself. He avoids the sec- 
ond difficulty in that he does not assert that external objects, 
independent of all selves, really exist. He teaches merely 
that, in perceiving, one uncritically assumes the existence 
of such independent objects. 
This account, brief as it is, of the self as related, provides 
the outline for our study of psychology. The chapters which 
follow will develop these distinctions. They will include also 
some attempt to explain these facts of psychology; and in 
the effort to explain they will range beyond the domain 
of psychology proper and will look for facts of physics, of 
biology, and of physiology, for phenomena of vibration, of 
adaptation, of anatomical structure, with which to link the 
psychic changes. 
II. Tue Meruops or PsycHoLtocy 
‘ The methods of psychology are, in general, the two meth- 
ods of every science : description (that is, analysis and classi- » 
fication) and explanation. But besides these fundamental 
orms of procedure, every science has certain methods pe- 
culiar to itself; and the method which distinguishes psy- 
chology is that of introspection. This follows directly from 
what has been said of the subject-matter of psychology. 
Its facts are not the common, independent, externalized facts 
of the physical sciences, but the inner facts, selves,-and ideas. 
To observe the psychic fact one has not, therefore, to sweep

  The Methods of Psychology 7 
the heavens with a telescope, nor to travel about in search of 
rare geological formations ; but one has merely to ask oneself 
such questions as: “How ‘dol actually feel?” ‘What do 
I mean when I say that I perceive, remember, believe?” 
The method has obvious advantages. It makes no especial 
conditions of time and place; it requires no mechanical ad- 
junct; it demands no difficult search for suitable material ; 
at any moment, in all surroundings, with no external outfit, 
onemay study the rich material provided by every imaginable 
experience. In an extreme sense, all is grist that comes to   
      
the psychologist’s mill. The apparent facility of introspec- 
tion is, however, one of its greatest dangers. Nothing seems 
easier than to render to ourselves a true account of what goes 
on in our consciousness. We are tempted, therefore, to over- 
look the need of training in introspection and to minimize 
its characteristic difficulties. Chief among these is the 
change which it makes in its own object. To attend to a 
particular experience actually alters it. If I ask myself in 
the midst of a hearty laugh, “Just what is this feeling of 
amusement?” forthwith the feeling has vanished, and a 
strenuous, serious mood has taken its place. Much the same 
is true of every form of consciousness. To observe myself 
' perceiving, remembering, or judging is no longer simply to 
perceive, to remember, and to judge, but to reflect upon 
, perception, memory, and judgment. It is true, therefore, as 
many psychologists have shown, that introspection is never 
of the immediate present, but is peu a case of “memory, 
The verification "of our r introspection is best sécured F 
an important subsidiary method shared by psychology with 
many of the physical sciences — the method of experiment.
-P-A-G-E-30
  8 A First Book in Psychology 
To experiment is to regulate artificially the conditions of 
phenomena in such wise as to repeat, to isolate, and to ) vary 
them at will. In a multitude of ways, therefore, experiment 
aids scientific observation. Repetition of phenomena insures 
accuracy of analysis, and makes it possible to verify the re- 
sults of a single observation ; isolation of conditions narrows 
the object of study, and avoids the distraction of the ob- 
server’s attention ; and, finally, variation of conditions makes 
it possible to explain a phenomenon exactly, by connecting 
it with those conditions only which it always accompanies. 
But because psychic facts differ from physical phenomena 
_in that they can never be repeated or exactly measured, 
psychological experiment directly concerns itself with the 
physical stimulation of psychic facts and with the physical 
reactions to these stimuli. For example, though I cannot 
measure the vividness of a memory image, I can count the 
number of repetitions of a series of words which I read aloud 
to the person on whom I experiment ; and I can compare the 
number of errors he makes in repeating the word-series when 
he has heard it once only, three times, or five times. In this 
way I can gain, experimentally, a conclusion about.the rela- 
tion of memory to frequency of experience, and by repeat- 
ing the experiment many times with the same individual 
and-with others, I may arrive at some trustworthy general 
conclusion. 
III. THe Forms or PsycHoocy - 
This chapter has so far dealt, as this book will mainly 
deal, with the fundamental form of psychology — normal, 
introspective psychology, the scientific study of oneself being 
conscious. Based on this introspective study is a second 
important, though subsidiary, branch of the science, com-
-P-A-G-E-31
  The Use of Psychology 9 
parative or inferential psychology, the science of infer- 
ence from the structure or from the behavior of living or- 
ganisms, human or merely animal, to the nature of other 
selves. The objects of normal comparative psychology are 
animals, children, and primitive men. Its methods are the 
careful observation of the words or actions of the animals 
and people whom it studies, and the inference of the con- 
scious experiences which underlie these outer manifesta- 
tions. Such inference involves introspection, because it 
consists in attributing one’s own experience, under given 
circumstances, to other selves; but this introspection, 
because imputed to others, has not the same value as the 
study of one’s own consciousness. Yet comparative studies 
of structure and of behavior have usefully directed intro- 
spection and have richly contributed to the explanatory 
side of psychology. The following summary enumerates 
these different forms of psychology : —

Io A First Book in Psychology 
  The technical psychologist may be tempted to ignore the 
question on the ground that it should never have been asked, 
that — rather — the student must assume at the outset the 
essential importance of all study, the vital significance of 
knowing anything. But the psychologist, in our sense of the 
term, has no need to take this ground. He studies the related 
self ; and human conduct is the active relation of self to other 
selves. A fuller understanding of these relations in their 
complexity and a deeper acquaintance with my own nature 
may surely, therefore, have a significant influence on my 
behavior. True, the study of behavior as such belongs to 
ethics, to social science, and to pedagogy rather than to 
psychology; but psychology is the necessary foundation 
for all these sciences, and the study of psychology may 
therefore contribute directly to my social efficiency.

CHAPTER II 
PERCEPTION AND IMAGINATION 
I. PERCEPTION AND IMAGINATION AS EXPERIENCES OF THE 
RELATED SELF 
Waar am I at this present moment? I ama self, conscious 
of holding a blue celluloid pen, of looking down upon a white 
page, of hearing ‘‘ The Road to Mandalay” whistled by a man 
who is mowing beneath my window, conscious also of the 
fragrance of the freshly cut grass and the warmth of the day, 
and, all the while, imagining a Tyrolese mountain landscape 
which I have never seen. Iam, in other words, a perceiving 
and imagining self, and though this is certainly no exhaustive 
account of me, still I may well attempt no more, at this stage 
of my psychologizing, than the close description and the ex- 
planation of perception and imagination, the experiences so 
far enumerated in the self of the present.* 
It will be convenient to begin with the analysis of perception. 
I notice first that in perceiving pen, paper, and tune I am 
directly aware of a certain inevitableness and involuntariness 
in the experience. I must see and touch just this pen; I can- 
* Before reading further, and without consulting any coe the student 
should state, in writing, all the likenesses and the differences which he can 
observe between (1) his experience as he perceives the desk (or rug, or hat) 
at which he is looking, and (2) his experience as he imagines a similar desk 
(rug, or hat) in some other room. The record of this introspection may 
profitably be compared with that of other students. 
Ir

  12 A First Book in Psychology 
not help feeling warm; I must hear this tune and must smell 
the odor of the falling grass. I may wish that I held a silver 
pen, that I were cool, not warm, that I were smelling roses 
instead of hay; but. I am bound down, in my perceiving, to 
precisely this experience. I am, in a word, directly conscious 
of myself as receptive. And this direct consciousness of 
receptivity, prominent in my perception, is wanting to my 
imagination. In some sense, at least, my imaginings are 
under my own control. In the present case, for example, I 
can turn from the inner contemplation of the mountain 
view to the imagining — let us say — of the prosaic interior 
of a German psychological laboratory. 
A second significant difference between perceiving and 
imagining is revealed not of necessity during the perception, 
but as I reflect on it or look back on it. To such reflective 
observation it is evident that my perception has been shared, 
or at any rate that it might have been shared, by other selves; 
whereas I need not, unless I will, share my imaginings. For 
example, the housemaid dusting the room can see my blue 
"pen and white paper, can hear the whistled melody, and smell 
the hay and feel the warmth. But the housemaid does not 
share my imagination of the Tyrolese mountains any more 
than I read the imagination which has brought a smile to her 
lips. People share our imaginings in a sense, when they try 
to reproduce them, yet, evidently, the world of imagination 
has a privacy foreign to the common world of our perceptions. 
Perception, finally, is reflectively regarded as my con- 
sciousness of my relation to a present external object, 
whereas the object of my imagination is never conceived as 
present and need not be conceived as external, that is, as 
independent of me. The remembered breakfast table, for
-P-A-G-E-35
Perception and Imagination 13 
example, is external, the fancied mermaid is creation of my 
mind, but neither is regarded as a present object. On the 
other hand, the perceived pen is realized as an external 
object present here and now. 
Three differences have thus been emphasized as distin- 
guishing perception from imagination: (1) my immediately 
realized receptivity, or passivity, in perceiving; (2) the re- 
flectively realized community of my perception with the 
experience of other selves; (3) my relation in perception to 
an object which I regard as independent and present. But 
these distinctions must not obscure the likenesses. Percep- 
tion resembles imagination in at least three ways. (1) Both 
are known (to reflection, if not immediately) as impersonal 
consciousness, in the sense that in perceiving and imagin- 
ing I am not predominantly conscious of selves. I perceive 
or imagine pen, paper, tune, but I do not perceive or 
imagine you or myself. In the second place, (2) both per- 
ception and imagination are forms of particularizing con- 
sciousness. I do not, for example, perceive or imagine pens 
in general, or even the class of celluloid pens, but rather this 
particular, individual pen. A final, highly important like- 
ness of perception and imagination is the following: (3) Both 
are chiefly sensational experiences concerned with vision, 
touch, and hearing rather than with feeling or with the con- 
sciousness of relation. This consideration will lead us to a 
psychological analysis different from that already attempted. 
To summarize our results: Perception has been described 
as sensational, passive consciousness reflectively realized as 
impersonal, particularizing, common to other selves, and as 
related to present external objects. Imagination has been 
described as sensational, impersonal, and particularizing,
-P-A-G-E-36
  14 A First Book in Psychology 
it as lacking the consciousness of passivity, the relation to 
present objects, and the community. 
II. PERCEPTION AND IMAGINATION AS SENSATIONAL 
We have already enumerated certain fundamental per- 
sonal attitudes, or relations, of self to environment: recep- 
tivity and activity, sympathy, and attention. It is, how- 
ever, obvious that these different relations, or attitudes, 
of the self resemble each other in certain significant ways. 
vThus, I may either attentively or inattentively see or hear ; 
I may be either sympathetically or unsympathetically 
happy or unhappy; and I may passively remark or actively 
recall a resemblance. In more technical terms: it is 
possible by attentive introspection to detect within every 
complex consciousness, or relation of self to object, certain 
elemental (that is, further irreducible) factors, or constitu- 
ents. These have/been called ‘elements,’ or ‘structural 
elements,’ of consciousness. They seem to fall into three 
main classes: (1) sensational, (2) affective, and (3) rela- © 
tional. Seeing blue is a sensational element; disliking 
warmth is an affective element; and contrasting one shade 
of blue with another is a relational element. The ground of 
this distinction will later be discussed more fully, but it may 
at once be noted that we tend to refer the sensational 
elements to external objects which we then call ‘blue’ 
and ‘warm.’ From this point of view, perception and 
imagination obviously are chiefly sensational in char- 
acter. 
Between perception and imagination as sensational com- 
plexes three further distinctions may ordinarily be made. 
If I close my eyes, and then imagine the oval gilt frame
-P-A-G-E-37
  Perception and Imagination 15 
which stands on my desk, and if I then reopen my eyes and 
compare perception with imagination, I shall find that the im- 
agination differs from the perception, first, in that it is sensa- 
tionally less intense — the gilt of the imaged frame is duller; 
second, in that it is less complex — I lack altogether the con- 
sciousness of certain details of the frame; and finally, in that 
it is more evanescent, more readily displaced by other imag- 
inings. And yet there are cases of imagination which lack one 
or more of these characteristics. The perception of one’s 
bodily attitude, for example, may be less intense, less accurate, 
and less permanent than the visual imagination of a face or 
the auditory imagination of a melody; one’s perception of an 
unknown substance, which one merely tastes or smells, may 
be less vivid, also, than one’s visual imagination of a bowl 
of strawberries or of a roasted duck. All this proves that 
intensity, detail, and stability are merely common and not 
necessary characteristics of perception. Indeed, the only 
invariable distinctions are those enumerated in the preceding 
section of this chapter. 
In perception and in imagination alike, my sensational 
experiences are of different sorts: I see, hear, smell, and touch. 
And one way of classifying both perception and imagination 
is according to predominant sense-factors. Such a classi- 
fication is, however, of most significance as applied to imagi- 
nation, for, as has appeared, my imagination is in some degree 
controllable; ‘and I may therefore make practical use of the 
discovery that my imagination is chiefly visual or auditory” 
In what follows we shall study imagination as sensational, 
but we must remind ourselves that all the distinctions which 
are made are equally, though less fruitfully, applicable to 
perception.
-P-A-G-E-38
16 A First Book in Psychology 
Concrete imagination — that is to say, the imagination of 
things, scenes, and events — must, in the first place, be dis- 
tinguished from merely verbal imagination. Concrete imagi- 
nation may belong to any sense-order, but it is in the main 
either visual, auditory, or tactual; or else it belongs to a 
‘mixed’ type, including elements of several kinds. Every 
student of psychology should undertake an introspective 
study of the sense-type of his imagination by the use of some 
such questionary as the following : * — 
a. In imagining a pink rose, 
1. (a) Do you see its color and the green of its leaves? 
(6) Are the pink and green as vivid as those of a real rose? 
2. (a) Can you see its shape? 
(b) Is it as distinctly outlined as the objects now before you on 
the table? 
. Can you smell it? 
. Can you feel the smoothness of its petals and leaves? 
. Can you feel the coolness of its petals and leaves? 
. Can you feel the prick of its thorns? Anh 
w 
6. In thinking of the words of ‘‘My Country, ’tis of thee,” 
Can you see them printed? 
. Can you hear yourself say them? 
. Can you hear yourself sing. them? 
. Can you feel yourself form the words in your throat and with 
your lips and tongue? 
5. Can you hear the organ play ‘‘America” ? PonrdH 
c. Arrange the following experiences in order of the distinctness (i.e. 
clearness or vividness) with which you can remember (or imagine) 
them: — 
1. A triangle drawn with black lead on white paper. 
2. A plane surface of lemon-yellow. 
3. The hum of a mosquito. 
4. The crack of a whip. 
* Condensed from a questionary formulated by Professor Gamble and 
used in the Wellesley College Laboratory since 1898-1899. These questions 
should be answered, in writing, before the student reads further.

It is obvious that one who ‘sees’ the pink and green and 
shape of the rose has a visual imagination, and that visual 
imaginations differ according as colors or forms are more 
distinctly visualized. The person with auditory imagination 
can ‘hear’ the sound of the organ and the crack of the whip; 
and, in similar fashion, the other types of concrete imagination 
are tested by these questions. It should be noted that, in 
many experiences, visual imagination supplements the per- 
ception of pressure and of sound, as when we ‘localize’ a 
touch by imagining the look of wrist or of forehead, on 
which it falls, or imagine the puffing red motor-car at sound 
of its bell. 
There is no character in which individuals differ more 
widely than in the prevailing sense-type of their imagination. 
In recalling, for example, the balcony scene in “ Romeo and 
Juliet,” some people see with the eye of the mind the shadowy 
form of Romeo and the figure of Juliet, clear-cut against the 
lighted window, the ‘stony limits,’ the cypresses, statues, and 
fountains of the Italian garden, and the “blessed moon . . . 
that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops”’; others, like 
Juliet, may “know the sound of that tongue’s utterance,” 
and may hear, in imagination, Romeo’s deep-voiced love- 
making and the “‘silver-sweet sound” of Juliet’s replies “like 
softest music to. attending ears.’’ Still others, finally, may 
image Romeo’s movements as “with love’s light wings” 
he “did o’erperch these walls.” (

  18 A First Book in Psychology 
The study of an imaginative writer often reveals the pre- 
dominant sense-order of his imagination. His pages may 
glow with color or thrill with music or quiver with rhythmic 
motion. The blind poet, Philip Bourke Marston, for exam- 
ple, describes a garden ravaged by “‘winds in the night, 
without pity or pardon,” in verses which contain no color- 
word, though they make mention of the garden’s ‘scent and 
sound,’ and are full of striking images of pressure and of 
cold: — 
‘All my song birds are dead in their bushes — 
Woe for such things! 
Robins and linnets and blackbirds and thrushes 
Dead, with stiff wings. 
“Oh, my dead birds! each in his nest there, 
So cold and stark; 
What was the horrible death that pressed there 
When skies were dark? 
“What shall I do for my roses’ sweetness 
The Summer round— ~ 
For all my Garden’s divine completeness 
Of scent and sound? 
This colorless garden stands in sharp contrast to Shelley’s 
forest, swept by the 
“. . . wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being, 
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead 
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing, 
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red.” 
Sometimes, indeed, a poet’s lines seem to disclose to us 
his peculiar delight in special colors or sounds. So Shelley, 
once more, seems most readily to imagine the greens and *

blues and purples of nature. He looks off upon wide land- 
scapes, and 
“Beneath is spread like a green sea 
The waveless plain of Lombardy.” 
He looks downward, from his boat, and sees

With green and purple sea-weeds strown. ” 
He looks outward to far horizons and 
“Blue isles and snowy mountains wear 
The purple noon’s transparent might.” 
He does not see the “‘ legion’d rooks ” who “ hail” the rising 
sun as black, but compares 
“—their plumes of purple grain 
Starr’d with drops of golden rain” 
to clouds “ fleck’d with fire and azure.” Even his gardens 
are full of ‘tender blue bells,’ of ‘‘flowers azure, black, 
and streak’d with gold,” and of “broad flag-flowers, purple 
prank’d with white.” 
The most common type of concrete imagination probably 
‘is the visual,\for, in spite of individual differences, most people 
can imagine objects in some vague outline and in some dull 
color. Every sculptor, painter, or architect who sees his vision 
before he embodies it has visual imagination. The inventor 
also ‘sees’ his engine or his dynamo in all its parts and con- 
nections, before he enters upon the actual construction of it; 
and the well-dressed woman sees the end from the beginning, 
the completed gown within the shapeless fabric. Above all, 
visual imagination is the endowment of the geometer and of 
the scientist. The one imagines the projections and inter- 
sections of lines and planes; the other beholds the planets

moving in their courses, peoples the earth with the forms 
of animals long extinct, or makes of every common object 
a palpitating dance of atoms and subatoms. Even a poet’s 
imagination may hesitate before the challenging hypotheses 
of science, for it is said that Wordsworth once exclaimed, 
“T have not enough imagination to become a geologist.” 
Yet in spite of the value of visual images to artists, inventors, 
and mathematicians, it must at once be acknowledged that, 
even to them, the visual type of imagination is not indispen- 
sable, but that it may be replaced by what we know as the 
tactual-motor type, the imaging of the movements by which 
one traces the outlines of figures or of designs. Galton 
found, as result of careful inquiry, that “men who declare 
themselves entirely deficient in the power of seeing mental 
pictures — can become painters of the rank of Royal Acade- 
micians.”” And James says of himself, “I am a good 
draughtsman and have a very lively interest in pictures, 
statues, architecture, and decoration, and a keen sensibility 
to artistic effects. But I am an extremely poor visualizer, 
and find myself often unable to reproduce in my mind’s eye 
pictures which I have most carefully examined.” * In these’ 
cases, a quickness to recognize and to discriminate colors 
and forms is combined with the inability to imagine them. 
Evidently, visual imagination is here replaced by pressure 
imagination — imagination of the motions necessary to the 
production of sculpture, machine, or figure: a sculptor of this 
type reproduces in imagination the movements of his chisel, 
and the geometrician draws his figure or indicates by imaged 
movements the sweep of orbits and the intersection of lines. 
Kiilpe discovered, experimentally, the same lack of visual

  Sense-types of Imagination 21 
imagination.* He tested the color-imagery of several stu- 
dents by pronouncing in a darkened room the names of colors 
and requiring them to describe the resulting experiences. 
One of these young men proved utterly incapable, with the 
strongest effort, of imagining any color whatever. Another 
historic example is Charcot’s patient, a man whose visual 
imagery was impaired through nervous disease. ‘Asked to 
draw an arcade, he says, ‘I remember that it contains semi- 
circular arches, that two of them meeting at an angle make 
a vault, but how it looks I am absolutely unable to imagine.’ 
He complains of his loss of feeling«for colors. ‘My 
wife has black hair, this I know; but I can no more recall 
its color than I can her person and features !’” 
The auditory type of imagination is unquestionably less 
common than the visual, and it is almost always closely com- 
bined with imagery of the motor-tactual sort. It is the image- 
type of the great musicians, of Beethoven, for example, who 
composed his symphonies when totally unable to hear a note 
of them. But though less significant to most of us than the 
visual images, the concrete auditory imagination belongs, at 
least in some degree, to all people who are able to recall 
‘voices and melodies. The prevalence of auditory imagery 
is suggested by the ordinary ruse of violin players, who pro- 
duce the effect of a diminuendo, lengthened beyond the actual 
sound, by continuing the drawing motion of the bow when it 
no longer touches the string. 
The most significant type of tactual (or pressure) imagina- 
tion is frequently called the tactual-motor type — the imagi- 
nation of the pressures, often internal, which are originally

due to bodily movements; the imagination, for example, 
of one’s shortened breath as one is running. Imagination 
may be, also, of some other dermal sense-type, that is, of 
pain, of warmth, or of cold. Such experiences are perhaps 
rare, but they unquestionably occur. Keats, for example, 
vividly images the coldness of 
“a draught of vintage, that hath been 
bas Cooled a long age in the deep-delvéd earth.” 
One must carefully distinguish between such imagining 
and the corresponding peripherally aroused sensation. The 
vivid account of a wound or a physical injury may excite, 
through the connection of cortical neurones through motor 
neurones with organic reactions, the actual, visceral pressure- 
sensations which constitute the feeling of faintness, and it 
may even excite the pain end-organs. In the same way, 
I grow actually hot over a remembered mortification and I 
shiver with cold at a revived fear. 
Smell and taste imagination are relatively infrequent and 
their occurrence is, indeed, often denied. It is said that when 
we imagine objects fragrant in themselves, such as roses or 
cheese or coffee, we imagine their look or their feel without 
imagining their odor; and that when we suppose ourselves 
to imagine tastes, we are really imagining the colors and the 
forms of food. It will be admitted that from our dream 
dinners we are apt to wake before tasting anything, and that 
poetic descriptions of banquets dwell chiefly on the color of 
‘dusky loaf’ of ‘golden yolks’ and ‘lucent syrops,’ and on the 
texture of ‘fruit . . . rough or smooth rined’ or of ‘jellies 
soother than the creamy curd’! Yet no one will deny that 
the poet must have imagined odors, and not colors, when he 
writes in the fifth stanza of the “’ Ode to a Nightingale” : —
-P-A-G-E-45
Sense-types of Imagination 23 
   
   
  ‘I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, 
Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, 
ut, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet 
Wherewith the seasonable month endows 
ff The grass, the thicket, and the fruit tree wild; 
a 
And mid-May’s eldest child, 
‘The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine.” 
Besides this unintended evidence from imaginative writers 
we have well-attested instances of the smell and taste imagina- 
tion, both in waking experience and in dreams, of well-trained 
observers. An inquiry among fifty Wellesley College stu- 
dents, somewhat trained in introspection, disclosed the fact 
that thirty-one were sure that they could imagine the odors 
of certain substances, such as burning tar, burning sulphur, 
and mignonette. 
More common than any of these classes of concrete imagi- 
nation is that to which we have already referred as the 
‘mixed type.’ The imagination of any object is likely, in 
other words, to include elements of more than one sense- 
order: it is not wholly visual and still less is it entirely audi- 
tory or tactual. Either the visual or auditory elements may 
predominate, but the imagination — of a dinner-party, for 
example — is rarely a mere complex of the colors and forms 
of dresses, faces, candles, flowers, foods, nor yet of the sounds 
of conversation, laughter, and service, but it includes both 
visual and auditory images, perhaps with a pressure image 
also of the ‘feel’ of linen or of silver, and a gustatory or 
olfactory image of the taste of beef or the odor of roses. 
Contrasted with all these classes of concrete imagination 
are the verbal types, which are far more prevalent than any

one, save the psychologist, realizes. In the expey 
many people these altogether crowd out concrete i 
We suppose ourselves to be imagining the Heraion 
the ‘‘Madonna della Sedia,” or Liszt’s “ Hungarian 
sody,” when, as a matter of fact, we are mainly sayin, 
ourselves the words ‘Heraion,’ ‘madonna,’ ‘rhapsody.’ 
course this is an artificial state of affairs. Words are con- 
ventional symbols, not instinctive reactions; they play no 
part at all in the imaginative life of animal or of baby, 
and little part in that of the savage. The civilized being, 
however, is born into a world of people whose most char- 
acteristic activity is neither eating, walking, nor fighting, but 
talking. At first, through pure imitation, and afterwards 
because he recognizes the utility of language, he largely occu- 
pies himself with words, first heard and spoken, and later 
read and written. And as habits fall away through disuse, 
so, little by little, in the experience of most of us, word-images 
take the place of concreter images of color, sound, and the 
like. It is unnecessary to dwell on the immense utility of 
verbal imagination, for we are already victims of what Mr. 
Garrison calls ‘the ignorant prejudice in favor of reading and 
writing,’ and, he might have added, ‘of talking.’ Words . 
serve not only as the means of communication, and thus as the 
surest method of social development, but — by their abstract, 
conventional form — as an aid to rapid memorizing and to 
clear reasoning; they are indispensable parts of our intel- 
lectual equipment; yet they are in themselves but poor and 
insignificant experiences, and they work us irreparable harm 
if they banish, from the life of our imagination, the warm — 
colors, broad spaces, liquid sounds, and subtle fragrances 
which might enrich and widen our experience.
-P-A-G-E-47
  Verbal Imagination 25 
We have ample proof that this is no purely fictitious danger. 
Galton’s most significant conclusion from his statistical study 
of imagination is that the “faculty of seeing pictures, .. . 
if ever possessed by men of highly generalized and abstract 
thought, is very apt to be lost by disuse.” Many of the ‘men 
of science,’ whose imagination he tested, had ‘no more no- 
tion” of the nature of visual imagery “than a color-blind 
man ... hasofthenatureof color. ‘It is only by a figure 
of speech,’” one of them says, “‘‘that I can describe my rec- 
ollection of a scene as a mental image that I can see with my 
mind’s eye, . . . I do not see it . . . any more than a man 
sees the thousand lines of Sophokles which under due pressure 
he is ready to repeat.’”’ Every mixed figure is in truth a wit- 
ness to the common lack of concrete imagery. The earnest 
preacher who exhorted his hearers to water the sparks of 
. grace, and the fervid orator who bewailed the cup of Ireland’s 
misery as ‘long running over, but not yet full,’ were, of course, 
without the visual images which their words should suggest. 
Doubtless, most of their hearers received these astounding 
statements without a quiver of amusement — not, primarily, 
because they lacked a sense of humor, but because they failed 
to translate the words into visual imagery. 
The study of the varying forms of verbal imagination 
discloses the fact that, like the forms of concrete imagina- 
tion, they belong usually to a visual, an auditory, a tactual, 
or a ‘mixed’ class, though they may conceivably be of other 
sense-types. The good visualizer images his words as they 
are printed on a page, reading them off, sentence by sentence 
or verse by verse, recalling the precise part of the page on which 
a given word or sentence appears. Galton tells of a statesman 
_ who sometimes hesitates in the midst of a speech, because  
-P-A-G-E-48
    
       26 A First Book in Psychology 
plagued by the image of his manuscript speech with its origi- 
nal erasures and corrections. Even musicians may be helped 
by symbolic imagery and may play by mentally reading their 
scores. Again, verbal imagination may be of words as heard; 
and such masters of musical verse as Sophokles, Tennyson, 
and Swinburne must have auditory verbal imagery. One 
may ‘hear’ words spoken by oneself or by others, one may 
listen in imagination to conversations between different 
people, or one may recall whole scenes of a play in the char- 
acteristic intonations of different actors. ‘‘‘When I write a 
scene,’ said Legouve to Scribe,* ‘I hear but you see. In each 
phrase which I write, the voice of the personage who speaks 
strikes my ear. Vous qui étes le theatre méme your actors 
walk, gesticulate before your eyes; I am a listener, you a 
spectator.’ ‘Nothing more true,’ said Scribe; ‘do you know 
where I am when I write a piece? In the middle of the 
parterre.’”” 
One’s verbal imagery, finally, may be of the tactual-motor 
type; one may imagine oneself as speaking, or, less often, 
as writing the words. A simple proof of the frequent 
occurrence of these motor images was suggested by Dr. 
Stricker: ¢ the attempt to imagine a word containing several 
labials — such a word as ‘bob’ or ‘pepper’ — without the 
faintest imaged or actual movement of the lips. Most people 
will be unsuccessful in such an experiment, which brings to 
light the presence, in verbal imagining, of the imagination 
or perception of movements of the throat and lips. Even 
the distinct effort to visualize words may result in tactual- 
motor images. James, for example, “can seldom call to

  Verbal Imagination 247 
mind even a single letter of the alphabet ’in purely retinal 
terms. I must trace the letter,” he says, “by running my 
mental eye over its contour.” 
The various phenomena of aphasia, the cerebral disease 
affecting the word-consciousness, confirm these results of 
introspection. "They show that verbal imagery is impaired 
by injury to’the visual, to the auditory, or to any tactual- 
motor centre, or by injury to the neurones connecting these 
areas, and that corresponding with these different patho- 
logical conditions there may. be independent loss of words 
as read, as heard, as spoken, or as written. 
Several general conclusions follow from the study of the 
sense-orders of our images: the impossibility, first of all, of 
supposing that any normal person is unimaginative. Since 
imagination is not of necessity an artistic impulse, a lofty 
soaring in empyrean isolation from the everyday life, but 
merely, as we have seen, the imaging of colors, sounds, pres- 
sures, odors, tastes, or even of words, it follows that every- 
body who is conscious of anything whatever, in its absence, 
is in so far imaginative. When I am conscious of the hat 
which I yesterday bought or of the dinner which I shall eat 
. to-day, no less than when I muse upon the picture I shall 
paint or of the world I shall discover, I am, in a strict sense, 
imaginative. Our study, furthermore, makes it clear that 
almost everybody is capable of inciting himself to vivid and 
accurate imagination of one sort or another. If, try as he 
will, the colors are washed out and the outlines indistinct in 
his visual images of an opera or of a country outlook, he may 
hear, in imagination, the varying parts of strings and horns 
in the orchestral prelude, the melodies of the songs and the 
harmonies of the choruses, or the liquid bird-notes, lapping

waves, and murmuring leaves of the summer afternoon. 
Even the minor image-types may be well developed, as the 
experiences of many defectives show. Helen Keller, who 
has been blind and deaf from earliest childhood, so that she 
can have neither visual nor auditory imagination, none the 
less imagines with peculiar vividness and detail pressures, 
movements, and even tastes and smells. A passage from 
her ‘‘ Story of My Life” illustrates this lively and accurate 
imagining and may fitly close this chapter: — 
“Everything,” she says, “that could hum, or buzz, or sing 
had a part in my education — noisy-throated frogs, katydids, 
and crickets held in my hand till they trilled their reedy 
note. I felt the bursting cotton bolls and fingered their soft 
fibre and fuzzy seeds . . ., I felt the low soughing of the 
wind through the corn stalks, the silky rustling of the long 
leaves, and the indignant snort of my pony .. . as we put 
the bit in his teeth. ... Ah, me! How well I remember 
the spicy, clovery smell of his breath.”

CHAPTER III 
THE SENSATIONAL ELEMENTS OF PERCEPTION AND 
IMAGINATION 
In the second section of the preceding chapter, imagi- 
nation — and, by implication, perception — have been de- 
scribed according to sensational content. But the sensational 
elements themselves have been only incidentally considered. 
To repair this neglect, it will be well to recur to our initial 
example — I am writing with a blue pen on a warm summer’s 
day within sound of a gardener’s whistling. My present 
consciousness includes, therefore, the experiences of blueness, 
of whiteness, of tone, of warmth, and of pressure. These 
sensational elements of my consciousness may be studied in 
any order. In this chapter, the first to be considered are 
I. ELemMentaAL VisuaAL ExPERIENCES 
a. ENUMERATION 
1 (a) Visual Qualities: Experiences of Color 
Here we come at once upon a curious fact. An elemental 
consciousness of color, the experience of green, for example, 
is utterly indefinable. Every normal person realizes, yet no 
one can tell, what itis. I may say, “I am conscious of green 
‘in looking at the trees;” or, “my consciousness of green is 
produced by a mixture of blue and yellow pigments;” but 
these are statements about the consciousness of green, not

descriptions of it. In truth, such descriptions are inherently 
impossible because description, or definition, involves an 
analysis of content, whereas an elemental experience is irre- 
ducible, that is, further unanalyzable. 
It follows that very little may be said, in terms of mere 
description, about the sensational color-qualities, that is, 
the elemental kinds of color-consciousness. At least four 
sensational color-qualities (that is, kinds of color experience) 
are admitted by almost all psychologists as unanalyzable, or 
Red Yellow elemental. These four are the con- 
sciousness of red, of yellow, of green, 
and of blue; they are often described, 
also, as ‘principal colors,’ and for the 
following reason: If we have a succes- 
sion of color-experiences in the spec- 
Peacock trum order, we are certain’to recognize

sciousness of yellow to consciousness of green, and so on; 
and that the experiences nearest to each end term differ 
from it by being like one or other of the contiguous end 
terms. For example, my consciousness of yellowish orange 
differs from that of yellow by being like both the conscious- 
ness of red and the consciousness of yellow; whereas my con- 
sciousness of olive differs from that of yellow by being like 
both the consciousness of yellow and the consciousness of 
green. We rightly, therefore, distinguish between the ele- 
mental experiences of red, yellow, green, and blue, and the 
other color-experiences, each of which is like two of the ele- 
ments or ‘turning-points’ of the colot-square. Some “psy-
-P-A-G-E-53
  
Elemental Visual Experiences 3r 
chologists believe that only the four ‘principal’ color-qualities 
are elemental and that all the others are fusions of two 
or more of the four. Other psychologists hold that there 
are as many elemental as distinguishable color-experiences. 
Into the details of this rather academic discussion we need 
not enter. 
| (b) Visual Qualities: Experiences of Colorless Light 
' Besides our experiences of color — of red, green, blue, and 
the like — we have also the introspectively different expe- 
riences of colorless light, that is, of white, gray, and black. 
There is wide diversity among psychologists in their account 
of the relation of these experiences. Some reckon the con- 
sciousness of gray as a complex experience which includes 
that of white and of black; others hold that there is but one 
colorless light quality — the consciousness of gray, and that 
te experiences of white and of black are really experiences of 
light and dark gray.* A third view enumerates among the 
colorless light elements the consciousness of white, of black, 
and of all distinguishable grays. A fourth view recognizes 
three colorless light qualities (the consciousness of white, of 
black, and of gray), explaining the differences in sensations 
of gray as distinctions in intensity. It is unnecessary and 
‘ings impossible to choose between these accounts. The 
important point is to note the evident distinction between the 
fdploriése light qualities,’ the consciousness of white, of gray, 
and of black on the one hand, and the ‘color-qualities’ on the 
other. Significant also is the fact that though one may have 
the colorless-light consciousness without the color-conscious-

ness — in other words, though one may see white, gray, ot 
black untinged by color— one is never conscious of color with- 
out colorless light. In the terms of physics: we never see an 
absolutely pure or, as it has been called, a ‘saturated’ blue or 
red. Most of our colors, indeed, are decidedly ‘unsaturated,’ 
that is to say, they seem to be mixed with colorless light. 
All told, we are capable of an indefinitely large number 
of visual experiences. Besides the consciousness of colorless 
waite light we have first (1) the 
principal color-qualities; next 
(2) experiences of hue — the 
_ consciousness of —greenish- 
blue, for example — of which 
each is like two of the princi- 
pal color-elements; (3) expe- 
riences of ‘tint’ — such as the 
consciousness of straw-color 
or pink —of which each is 
like some consciousness of 
color (or of hue) and the 
consciousness of light gray 
or white; and (4) experiences

Titchener, with altered wording.*) that of bottle-green — each 
of which resembles both the consciousness of color or hue 
and that of dark gray or black. An admirable way in which 
to represent to ourselves this wealth of our visual experience 
is by the figure known as the color pyramid.* The base of

this symbol represents the experiences of most saturated 
color — those in which there is least consciousness of white, 
of gray, or of black. Its rectangular form suggests the 
fact that the consciousness of red, of yellow, of green, and of 
blue are, as has been shown, turning-points in the color- 
quality series. The dotted vertical represents the ex- 
periences of white, of gray, of black. Toward the top, 
the surface of the pyramid represents the experiences of 
pale green, of straw-yellow, of sky-blue, and of pink; toward 
the bottom the experiences of indigo-blue, of brown, of 
dark red, and of bottle-green, are represented. “All these 
tones,” to quote Titchener again, “are the most saturated 
possible, the most coloured colours of their kind,” but “if 
we peel the figure” (like an onion), “leaving the black and 
white poles untouched, we get precisely what we had before, 
save that all the colour tones are less saturated, lie so much 
nearer to the neutral tones.” 
2. Visual Intensities: Experiences. of Brightness 
One cannot be conscious of a color, a red or a blue, for ex- 
ample, or of a colorless light, a white or black or gray, with- 
out being at the same time conscious of brightness. The 
; experience of brightness as well as that of color or of gray, 
is a distinct and unanalyzable element of consciousness. It 
cannot, of course, be separated from the consciousness of 
colorless light with which it is combined, but it may be per- 
fectly distinguished from it. The visual intensities are, as 
very one admits, indefinite in number. They are further- 
more distinguished from sensational qualities of color and of

colorless light, by their capacity for direct and simple serial 
arrangement.* * But, partly because our practical and 
zsthetic interests are concerned only with extremes of in- 
tensity, we are not interested in naming the experiences of 
brightness as ‘we are in naming those of color. For these 
reasons, the visual intensity-elements are estimated by com- 
parison with each other, and not with reference to absolute 
standards; and the intensity-series can be indicated only by 
words: “bright — brighter — still more bright, etc.” 
3. Visual Elements of Extensity 
Always with our consciousness of color we have the experi- 
ence of a certain bigness, or extensity.**? This, too, is an ele- 
mental sensational consciousness, an unanalyzable experience 
quite distinct from every other. In the words of James, it is 
‘an element in each sensation, just as intensity is. The latter 
every one will admit to be a distinguishable though not 
separable ingredient... . In like manner extensity, being 
an entirely peculiar kind of feeling indescribable except in 
terms of itself, and inseparable in actual experience from 
some sensational quality which it must accompany, can it- 
self receive no other name than that of sensational element.” 
b. THE ATTEMPTED EXPLANATION OF VISUAL EXPERIENCES 
1. The Physical and Physiological Conditions of the 
Consciousness of Color and Colorless Light 
(a) The Physical Conditions of the Visual Consciousness 
We have so far enumerated and, though roughly and par- 
tially, have classified our sensational visual experiences. We

  } Elemental Visual Experiences 35 
have next to seek some explanation of them. A brief reflec- 
tion will convince us that this explanation cannot be in terms 
of psychology, for very evidently it does not depend on me 
whether my present experience includes consciousness of 
green or of blue, of bright or of dull. The accepted expla- 
nation of every sort of sensational consciousness is in terms 
of physics and physiology, and the explanation of the color- 
consciousness is somewhat as follows: I have the sensational 
consciousness of green, let us say, because green light, namely, 
ether vibrations nearly 600,000,000,000,000 to the second, 
are refracted by the lenses of my eye to the retina, and there 
he a physiological process which is propagated by the optic 
nerve to the occipital lobe of my brain. Thus the physical 
condition of our consciousness of color is ether-vibrations. 
The ether is described by physicists as an ‘incompressible 
medium’ of extreme tenuity and elasticity which is supposed 
to pervade all space and to penetrate within the molecules of 
material substances. So impalpable a material has never 
been actually observed, but its existence is hypothetically 
assumed, because it offers the only plausible explanation of 
many physical phenomena. Because the ether pervades 
all bodies, it must be thrown into motion by their vibrating 
molecules, and its periodic, transverse vibrations are assumed 
to be the physical stimuli which condition the sensational 
qualities of color. Thus the colors vary according to the 
number of ether vibrations in a given time. The slowest 
vibrations, about four hundred and fifty trillion each second, 
condition the retinal process which accompanies the sensa- 
tional quality ‘red’; and the swiftest vibrations, about seven 
hundred and eighty trillion each second, form the physical 
stimulus to ‘violet.’ The following table includes these

figures for five colors, naming also the length of the ether- 
waves, that is, the distance from wave to wave. It is evident 
that the longer the waves the smaller the number which can 
be propagated in a given time: —

The external conditions of the consciousness of color- 
less light are more complicated. Two sorts of relation 
between stimulus and consciousness must be distinguished; 
the consciousness of white, gray, or black is due either 
(x) to a mixture of colored lights or (2) to a single colored 
light. 
(1) Not every combination of colored lights produces the 
colorless-light consciousness, but for every colored light an- 
other may be found such that, if the two be mixed and if they 
fall simultaneously on the retina, a consciousness of colorless 
light will result. Color-stimuli which stand in this relation 
to each other are called complementary. Furthermore, a 
mixture of three, of four, and of more color-stimuli, rightly 
chosen, will produce the consciousness of colorless light; 
and daylight, which is physically a compound of ether-waves 
of all wave-lengths, of course has the same effect.* (2) But

the colorless-light consciousness results not only from mixture 
of colored lights; it is sometimes excited by a single stimulus. 
The three most important cases in which one colored light, 
falling on the retina, is seen as gray are (a) in the faint light 
or twilight when, as the saying is, “all cats are gray”; (0) in 
color-blind eyes * to which some one color (most often red 
or green) or even all colors appear as gray; * (c) when the 
colored light falls on the peripheral or outer edge of the retina. 
If, for instance, a small colored object be brought toward the 
field of vision from the right side, while the left eye is closed 
and the right eye firmly fixated on something directly in front 
of the face, it will be found that the colored object at first 
seems gray, and that it is seen in its true color only as it 
approaches the centre of the eye.f

(b) The Physiological Conditions of the Consciousness 
{ of Color and Colorless Light 
Even the attempt to offer a physical explanation of our vis- 
ual sensations has led us, thus, to refer to physiological retinal 
conditions. We must now undertake a completer enumera- 
tion of these physiological conditions of vision. And it will 
be convenient to describe together the conditions of the color- 
consciousness and the colorless-light consciousness. 
In brief, the main physiological conditions of vision are the 
following: (x) A specific retinal process; (2) an excitation of 
the optic nerve which connects retina and brain; (3) an ex- 
citation of the visual brain centre — probably the cortex of

the occipital lobe. Besides these antecedent, or condition- 
ing, physiological processes, there occur always (4) accom- 
panying and following movements of eyes and head. 
In considering the nature of the retinal process which 
excites color-vision, it is necessary to have in mind the struc- 
ture of the human eye.’ Roughly speaking, it is a sort of 
spherical camera obscura, protected by a shutter, the eyelid, 
and containing a compound lens whose refractiveness (or 
ability to focus light-rays) changes, so that clear images now 
of near and now of far objects may be’thrown upon its 
plate, the retina. More literally, the eyeball is a sphere, 
moyed by six strong muscles, composed of three membranous 
layers enclosing certain transparent substances, and pierced, 
from the rear, by the optic nerve. The outside layer of the 
eyeball is an opaque, whitish membrane, the sclerotic, which 
in its forward part becomes transparent and is called the 
cornea. The forward portion of the second, or choroid, 
coating of the eyeball is the iris, which we see as the ‘blue’ 
or ‘brown’ of the eye. It is a sort of ‘automatic diaphragm’ 
with an opening, the pupil, which grows larger in faint light 
and smaller in bright light. Behind the iris is the crystalline 
lens, most important of the transparent substances of the 
eye. By an automatic muscular contraction it becomes more 
refractive when near objects are fixated. The third coating, 
the retina," covers the posterior two-thirds of the inner sur- 
face of the eyeball. It is composed of several layers, and the 
ninth of these layers consists of minute structures, of two types, 
known as rods and cones. These are so arranged that there 
are many cones and few rods in the centre, and many rods on 
the outlying portions of the‘retina. The rays of light from 
an object are refracted by the lenses of the eye, pierce through
-P-A-G-E-61
  i Elemental Visual Experiences 39 
the inner layers of the retina, and excite the rod and cone 
layer. The activity of rods and cones stimulates the optic 
nerve, and the optic nerve, in turn, transmits this excitation 
to the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. 
The retinal processes which condition the color and the 
colorless-light consciousness are very probably the following: ” 
(1) Colored light — for example, red light (that is, ether waves 
four hundred and fifty trillion to the second, six hundred and 
ninety millionths of a millimeter long) — partially decomposes 
a chemical substance in the cones of the retina. There are 
four possible phases of the decomposition of this cone-sub- 
stance, and corresponding to them are the sensational ex- 
periences of red, of yellow, of green, and of blue.** (2) A 
mixture of colored lights which totally decomposes this cone- 
substance conditions the consciousness of colorless light. 
(3) The consciousness of colorless light due to a single color- 
stimulus is excited by the decomposition of a similar, but less 
complex, chemical substance found in the rods of the retina. 
_ Any light stimulus suffices to break up this substance, and it 
is decomposable not in separate stages but only all at once. 
The three cases, already named, in which colored light excites 
colorless-light consciousness are thus explained: (@) When, 
as in twilight, the colorless-light stimulus is very faint, it 
lacks the intensity necessary to excite the processes of the 
cone-substance, whereas the rod-substance is particularly 
sensitive to faint light." (6) When a colored light falls on the 
outlying, or peripheral, part of the retina, it excites only the 
rod-substance, since this part of the retina contains no cones. 
(c) In partial color-blindness the cones of the retina may be 
supposed to be only partly developed, and the cone-substance 
to be decomposable in only two ofthe normal four stages.
-P-A-G-E-62
40 A First Book in Psychology 
In total color-blindness (if due to retinal and not to brain 
conditions) it may be supposed either that the retina contains 
only rods, and not cones, or that the cone-substance is as 
undeveloped as that on the rods.* 
2. The Physical and Physiological Conditions of Visual 
Brightness and Extensity 
By a little amplification this account of physical and phys- 
iological processes may be expanded so as to explain also the 
consciousness of brightness and of visual extensity. The 
visual qualities are conditioned by the length, and the corre- 
sponding number per second, of the ether waves; the visual 
intensities, that is, the brightnesses, are conditioned by the 
wave amplitudes; the visual extensities, or bignesses, are con- 
ditioned presumably by the number of waves of equal length. 
The physiological conditions of these elemental visual ex- 
periences are probably the following: The ‘qualities’ (ex- 
periences of color and of colorless lights) are conditioned by 
the mode of the retinal excitation (partial or total decompo- 
sition of a retinal substance), whereas visual intensities are 
conditioned by the degree of excitation; and visual extensities 
are conditioned by the number of nerve-elements excited.” 
It must be noted, in conclusion, that color sensations stand 
in more constant relation to physiological than to physical 
conditions. The phenomena of color contrast offer an ad- 
mirable illustration.” If one look fixedly for ten to twenty 
seconds at an illuminated green window and then look off 
at a neutral background, the background will appear not white 
or gray, but pinkish-purple; or, if the illuminated window 
is blue, the background will appear as yellow. That is,
-P-A-G-E-63
Elemental Auditory Experiences 
  if a brightly colored object has been fixated, gray light fall- 
ing on the same part of the retina results in the complemen- 
tary color sensation — a case of successive contrast.* Here 
the objective stimulus, colorless light, occasions a sensation 
‘not of gray but of a color. No fully satisfying explanation 
of contrast phenomena has yet been found. The following, 
in terms of the special case, may be proposed: the green 
light partially decomposes the photochemical substance on 
the cones of the retina and thereby leaves this substance in 
a state of unstable equilibrium. After the removal of the 
green light, and because of the instability of the cone-sub- 
stance, the remaining decomposition-processes set in; and 
these processes, in combination, condition the conscious- 
ness of purple. 
Cases of simultaneous contrast also occur: that is, gray 
objects, seen on a colored background, appear to be of color 
complementary to the background.}

We have so far studied the visual elements in my _per-

  42 A First Book in Psychology 
istic factor of my consciousness that a tone is high or low, that 
a voice is soprano or alto. The most notable character of 
the pitch-qualities (experiences of pitch) is their capacity 
for arrangement in recurring series, the octaves. The num- 
ber of these tonal qualities (of pitch) is variously stated. On 
the ground that the trained hearer can distinguish about 
eleven thousand different tones, most psychologists assume 
an equal number of pitch-qualities. But on the ground of the 
close resemblance between a tone and its octave it has been 
urged that there are only as many pitch-qualities as there are 
distinguishable elements in an octave.* ” 
Psychologists are not agreed about the nature of our con- 
sciousness of noise. Many, teach that it is a mere conglomer- 
ate of many pitch-qualities ; and in favor of this view it may 
be urged that in most if not all noises — in the roar of the 
streets, and in the hum of insects — we detect what we call 
pitch. Other psychologists hold that a consciousness of 
noise, even when complex, includes some characteristic noise- 
quality — as, for example, the consciousness of puff, of thud, 
or of rumble.t These alleged noise-qualities have been 
distinguished as continuous or momentary, but have been, 
on the whole, insufficiently studied. On the other hand, 
experiences of pitch have been the object of minute consid- 
eration as forming an important factor of the esthetic con- 
sciousness. 
The elemental consciousness of a sound-quality, a pitch 
or a noise, is always fused, or combined, with the elemental 
experience of an auditory intensity, or loudness: that is, 
one is conscious of every sound as more or less loud or soft. 
* For experiments, cf. Sanford, 67-68; Titchener, § 12 (1). 
+ For experiments, cf. Sanford, 65; Titchener, § 12, (2) and (3).
-P-A-G-E-65
  Elemental Auditory Experiences 43 
And according to many (though not to all) psychologists, 
the consciousness of quality and of intensity are fused also 
with that of auditory extensity, or bigness.” This auditory 
extensity, or voluminousness, is the predominant factor in our 
distinction of one instrument from another —’cello from 
organ, or flute from violin — when both are playing at the 
same pitch and intensity. 
To sum up the results of the preceding paragraphs: the 
following auditory, sensational elements of consciousness ; 
occur: (1) auditory qualities (pitches, or tonal qualities and, 
perhaps, noise-qualities) ; (2) loudnesses, or auditory intensi- 
ties; (3) auditory extensities. A fusion of loudness and 
voluminousness with predominating pitch-quality is a tone. 
A fusion of loudness and voluminousness with noise-quality 
is a noise. (Or, if the occurrence of specific noise-qualities 
is denied, a noise may be defined as a complex of tones with- 
out any one prolonged or emphasized pitch-quality.) 
b,. ATTEMPTED EXPLANATION OF ELEMENTAL AUDITORY 
EXPERIENCES 
The main explanation of the specific nature of the auditory 
elements of consciousness is, once more, physical and physio- 
logical. , 
‘1. The Physical Conditions of Auditory Sensation 
We ‘shall find it convenient to consider the physical, and 
therefore secondary and remote, conditions of pitch and 
noise-quality, before regarding the more immediate physio- 
logical antecedents. The physical condition of the auditory 
consciousness in general may be described as oscillation of air- 
particles, producing rarefactions and condensations of the 
air. A rarefaction followed by a condensation is called an 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  A First Book in Psychology 
  atmospheric wave. (a) The consciousness of pitch is, in all 
probability, occasioned by a succession of simple and regular 
atmospheric waves. The experience of noise is probably 
due either to a momentary unperiodic vibration, or to a com- 
bination of air-waves of nearly identical length —for example, 
to'the complex of air-waves which are set into vibration when 
one ‘simultaneously strikes a great number of piano keys. 
Different qualities of pitch are found by experiment to cor- 
respond to the varying length of the atmospheric waves. 
The swifter the atmospheric vibrations, that is, the greater the 
number and the shorter the length of the air-waves in any 
second of time, the higher is the pitch-quality; and, on the other 
hand, the slower the vibrations, that is, the fewer and longer 
the air-waves in a second, the lower or deeper is the pitch- 
quality. This is the principle on which all stringed instru- 
ments are constructed. The shorter strings of the piano are 
struck to produce its higher notes; and the violinist’s finger 
divides his string to obtain from the swifter air-vibrations, 
propagated by the motion of each half, a tone an octave higher 
than that produced by the slower vibration of the entire length. 
As, therefore, a definite number of ether-vibrations corre- 
sponds with each experience of color, so each consciousness of 
pitch has its air-vibration number : the consciousness of low c, 
for example (in what is called the small octave), is produced, 
through the excitation of nerve-endings and brain-cells, by 
one hundred and twenty-eight vibrations; and that of its 
octave, c’, is excited by exactly twice as many, or two hundred 
and fifty-six vibrations. (6) The amplitude of an atmos- 
pheric wave, that is, the length of the extreme excursion (one 
way or other) of each air-particle is the condition of our con- 
sciousness of sound-intensity ; and (c) the wave complexity
-P-A-G-E-67
| Elemental Auditory Experiences 45 
4 
(due to combining waves of given length and amplitude) 
probably explains our consciousness of sound-extensity. 
But these physical phenomena are conditions of the audi- 
tory consciousness only indirectly as they bring about physi- 
ological processes. . 
2. The Physiological Conditions of Auditory Sensation 
Air-waves pass from the outer ear,'* through a short tube, 
and strike upon a stretched membrane (the tympanic mem- 
brane) at the entrance to the middle ear. This membrane 
is thus thrown into vibration and transmits its motion to a 
series of three small bones, which serve to transform ampli- 
tude into strength of vibration. The foot of the ‘stirrup,’ 
or inmost of these bones, fits into an opening in the inner ear; 
and the inner ear is a complex of bony tubes, lined with mem- 
brane and filled with liquid, embedded in the temporal bone 
of the skull. Probably only one of the three main divisions, 
namely, the cochlea, of the inner ear has to do with sensational 
elements of sound. The cochlea contains a structure, the 
basilar membrane," made up of fibres graded in length so 
"as to correspond to vibrations of different periods; and the 
auditory nerve has its ending in certain cells supported by 
these fibres. : 
The process which conditions hearing is, according to 
the theory of Helmholtz, the following: The tympanic 
membrane, set in motion by an air-wave, say of one hun- 
dred and twenty-eight vibrations per second, communi- 
cates this motion to the bones of the middle ear and thence 
to the liquid ‘contained in the inner ear. The movement 
of this liquid excites those only of the fibres of the basilar 
membrane whose vibration number is exactly, or approxi- 
nel  
-P-A-G-E-68
46 A First Book in Psychology 
  mately, one hundred and twenty-eight. If several basilar 
membrane fibres are excited by a compound vibration, the 
complex consciousness of a clang, or chord, follows. The 
consciousness of noise is perhaps best explained as due to the 
excitation of basilar membrane fibres in which “one fibre 
does not vibrate more strongly than the rest.” * This ex- 
planation covers not only cases in which the consciousness 
of noise is excited because ‘a considerable part of the basilar 
membrane is thrown into uniform vibration’? by a complex 
of air-waves of closely similar vibration-number, but also 
those in which the consciousness of noise is due to an un- 
periodic stimulus which “lasts for an exceedingly brief 
time.” For, in both cases, there is “no well-defined point 
of maximal stimulation.” 
‘It should be added that the air vibrations which produce 
very high and very loud sounds may be directly carried to 
the cochlea by the bony walls of the skull. Very high and 
very loud sounds are therefore audible to persons who have 
lost the organs of the middle ear. But however the 
cochlear process is stimulated, and whatever is its nature, 
it excites the auditory nerve terminals in the basilar 
membrane cells, and the excitation is conveyed to the 
auditory centres in the exterior temporal lobes of the 
brain.” As in the case of visual stimulation, such excitation 
always passes over into outgoing motor nerves, and bodily 
movements, especially head movements, result. Character- 
istic among these movements, in the case of the higher ver- 
tebrate animals, are adjustments of the outer ear such as we 
know so well in the dog and in the horse. Most human 
beings have lost the capacity for ear movements. ‘

IL. Peewee: ConscrousNEss OF SMELL (OLFACTORY 
| “EXPERIENCES) 
While listening to the mower’s whistling I am, it will be 
remembered, faintly conscious of the odor of freshly cut grass: 
that is, my sensational experience includes smelling as well 
as seeing and hearing. In purely descriptive technical terms, 
there seems little to be said about the elements of smell-ex- 
perience. I can in truth discriminate many odors, which 
means that my smelling includes different sensational qualities 
and intensities; but nobody has succeeded in discovering 
in the experience irreducible elemental qualities, fixed by defi- 
nite names. Complex smell-experiences are named, ordi- 
narily, from objects to which they belong; or are known 
simply by the feeling which accompanies them, as pleasant 
or unpleasant. 
Little is known of the external conditions of smell. The 
smell stimulus must be gaseous in form, and it affects end- 
organs lying in the membranous lining of the upper part of the 
nostrils.* The nostrils open into the pharynx; and thus the 
smell end-organs may be excited by way of the mouth cavity, 
and it is also true that particles may reach the mouth 
through the nostrils. The following section will call atten- 
tion to one result of this close connection between smell and 
taste-organs. The cerebral centre for smell is in the median 
side of the temporal lobes,” and the excitation of this brain 
centre is normally followed by characteristic movements. 
IV. ELementaL Taste EXPERIENCES 
We are familiar already with the psychologist’s method 
of approaching every experience, — the effort to discover
-P-A-G-E-70
  48 A First Book in Psychology 
  its ultimate elements. The method has now to be applied 
to the experiences which we know as tastes. 4 
The ordinary individual, asked to name what he had 
‘tasted’ at dinner, might answer that he had tasted beef- 
bouillon, roast duck, potato, onion, dressed celery, peach ice, 
and coffee. But the psychologist would conclude at once that ~ 
some of these experiences were complex, including simpler 
elements. And the experimentalist would go farther: he 
would take means to isolate, so far as he could, the conditions 
of taste, so that other sense-elements should be shut out from 
consciousness. To this end he would select, if possible, 
as subject of the experiments, an anosmic person, that is, 
one without smell-sensations, or else he would close the sub- 
ject’s nostrils, so as to eliminate most of these smell-sensa- 
‘tions; and he would certainly blindfold the subject, to pre- 
vent his seeing the articles which he tasted. These substances 
would be presented to him at an even temperature, and the 
solids would be finely minced so as to be indistinguishable in 
form. Judging by the results of actual experiments, in par- 
ticular those of Professor G. T. W. Patrick, the results of 
such a test, as applied to our suggested ménu, would be the 
following: the blindfolded and anosmic subject would as 
likely as not suppose that he had tasted chicken broth, beef, 
potato, an unknown sweetish substance, another unknown 
material mixed with a thick, tasteless oil, a sweet unflavored 
substance and a slightly bitter liquid— perhaps a dilute 
solution of quinine. A normal person, also blindfolded, but 
without closed nostrils, would recognize the onion, the peach, 
the coffee, and often the olive oil; but would be likely to 
confuse the beef and the duck; whereas, if these were un- 
salted, the anosmic subject would fail to recognize them
-P-A-G-E-71
  Elemental Taste Experiences 49 
even as meats. Certain substances, on the other hand, for 
instance, the different sorts of bread, of white, graham, and 
rye flours, would be better discriminated by the anosmic 
subject. 
These results are easy of interpretation. What we know 
as tasting is a complex experience ‘made up’ of experiences 
of odor, of pressure, and of pain — not to speak of visual ele- 
ments — in varying combination with a limited number of 
distinct experiences of taste. (1) The consciousness of odor 
is the significant factor in ‘tasting’ egg, fruit, wine, onion, 
chocolate, coffee, and tea. Tea and coffee are, indeed, un- 
distinguished from quinine, when the odor-elements are ex- 
cluded, and are differentiated from each other only by the 
slight astringency of the tea, that is, by the peculiar pres- 
sure-experience, the ‘puckering,’ which it incites. (2) The 
experience due to tasting nuts, vegetables, or grains forms a 
second class, for it consists, in large part, of pressure-sensa- 
tions excited by stimulation of the tongue. It follows that — 
because of his trained attention to degrees of roughness, 
smoothness, hardness, and softness, the anosmic person can 
distinguish better than the normal person, if both are blind- 
folded, breads made of different grains. (3) The experi- 
ence of pungent taste, in the third place, is largely distin- 
guished by sensational elements of pain and perhaps of heat. 
(4) And finally, in another kind of tasting, the important 
feature i is visual, as is proved by the fact that the varieties 
of meats and of bread are so frequently undistinguished by 
the blindfolded observer. 
But, though so-called tasting is thus proved to contain the 
sense-consciousness of smell, of pressure, and of color, it 
is characterized also by certain distinctive elemental taste- 
; E

experiences. According to experimental introspection, there 
are four taste-qualities: sweet, salt, sour, and bitter, besides 
an indefinite number of sense-intensities. Some psycholo- 
gists believe there are also taste-extensities, that in eating 
roast beef, for example, one has a consciousness of bigness, 
absent from the consciousness of lemon. It should be noted 
that the taste-qualities, the experiences of salt, sweet, sour, 
and bitter, do not introspectively order themselves either 
(like.the color-qualities) in an articulated series; or (like 
the auditory qualities) in a periodic series. Like the color- . 
qualities, however, they are capable of contrast effects — for 
example, lemonade is very sour after ice-cream.* 
Concerning the external stimulus of taste, little can be said. 
Chemically distinct substances may even arouse the same 
sensational quality; for example, both sugar and acetate of 
lead give a ‘sweet’ taste. The stimulus must, however, be in 
liquid form; for, if the top of the tongue be carefully dried, a 
grain cf sugar or of quinine placed upon it will not be tasted 
till the tongue becomes moist again. The physiological end- 
organs of taste are minute structures contained in the mucous 
membrane of mouth and of throat, especially in the papille 
(or little hillocks) of the tongue.” The cerebral centres are 
probably near the smell-centres,’? and the characteristic 
motor accompaniments are movements of the tongue.

new-mown hay, but I am conscious of grasping my pen. My 
sensational consciousness certainly includes the experience 
of tactual quality, of tactual intensity, and of tactual bigness. 
Everybody admits that there are indefinitely many pressure 
intensities and extensities, and it has been thought that as 
there are many qualities of color and of pitch, so also there are 
many pressure-qualities — the experiences, for example, of 
contact, of hardness and softness, of roughness and smooth- * 
ness, and of wetness. On close inspection these turn out, 
however, to be complex (though relatively simple) experiences 
in which pressure-quality is the essential component. Thus, 
the consciousness of contact is that of faint pressure; the ex- 
perience of smoothness seems to be that of uninterrupted pres- 
sure; and the alleged sensation of hardness is a complex 
whose chief constituent is the sensation of intense pressure 
due to excitation of end-organs in the joints. The experience 
of “wetness seems, at first thought, unambiguously elemental 
and unanalyzable, but it is really a complex of warmth or cold 
consciousness combined with the experience of smoothness 
and, often, with a visual image of the liquid stimulus. This 
is proved by the fact that one often cannot tell the difference 
between dry or wet hotness or coldness. One does not know, 
for example, by the mere ‘feeling’ of them, whether one’s 
feet are wet or merely cold; and whether a hot compress is 
dry or wet. 
The physical stimulus of our pressure-sensations is mechan- 
ical. As it affects the skin, it must produce an actual defor- 
mation; and we therefore feel the surface pressure of a large 
object only at its terminal lines: for example, if the hand is 
plunged in water, the pressure is felt only where the wrist 
emerges. But contact with the skin does not always result
-P-A-G-E-74
52 A First Book in Psychology 
in pressure-sensation. For, contrary to our usual view, the 
skin is not, as a whole, sensitive to pressure stimuli.” If I 
am blindfolded, and a small blunted point of cork or wood is 
drawn gently over the surface of any part of my body, for 
example, of my arm, I shall feel it as touching my skin at cer- 
tain points only —usually at the roots of the hairs of the skin, 
but in hairless spots also.* This shows that certain minute 
structures embedded in the skin are end-organs of pressure; 
and it has been found that these organs are of two sorts: 
(z) hair-cells and (2) more developed structures known as 
Meissner’s corpuscles.”” ‘ 
1 ' 
b, EXPERIENCES, MAINLY OF PRESSURE, THROUGH INTER- 
NAL EXCITATION 
  End-organs of pressure are found not only in the skin but 
on the joint-surfaces, and perhaps embedded in the muscles.” 
Pressure-sensations through bending the joints are, indeed, 
strong and readily discriminated. One may readily convince 
oneself of their occurrencé if one lower a weight by a string 
attached to the forefinger till it strikes floor or table. At 
the moment when it strikes, one experiences a Sensation, 
evidently of pressure, which can only be due to the backward 
movement of the lower upon the upper joint-surface of the 
arm.f 
Besides these admitted pressure-sensations, there are several 
other sensational experiences due also to internal excitation, 
of which, probably, or possibly, pressure-sensations are the 
main constituent. These internally excited sensations are

Elemental Pressure Experiences 
  lifting weights and by assuming rigid bodily attitudes. A ° 
simple way to excite it, for example, is to clench the hand 
firmly, but in such wise that its surfaces do not touch each 
other. No external pressure can then be felt, but the resulting 
experience is said to include, not only a weak’ sensation of 
pressure from the moving of the surfaces of the finger-joints 
on each other, but also a new experience, that of strain, 
regarded by some as elemental, by others as a complex con- 
sciousness of pressure and of pain. It is specifically due to 
excitation of the tendons. 
(2) A second alleged sensation from internal excitation is 
that of dizziness, due to excitation of the semicircular canals."* 
What is known as dizziness is probably either a complex 
experience or a mere pressure-sensation. It includes, or is 
closely accompanied by, moving visual images of objects and 
figures rotating slowly, or slipping and swimming about in 
one’s field of vision. It is furthermore sometimes, though 
by no means invariably, accompanied by the feeling of 
nausea. For the rest, it seems to consist of a pressure- 
sensation ‘located’ within the head. 
6) So-called ‘organic’ sensations are more evidently 
complex experiences. These include (a) the so-called sen- 
sations from excitation of the alimentary canal, hunger, thirst, 
nausea, and (b) the so-called circulatory and respiratory 
sensations. Carefully analyzed, each of these, in the writer’s 
opinion, will disclose itself as complex, and not, in any 
sense, elemental. Thirst, for example, is a complex of pres- 
sure and warmth sensations; it is due to a drying of the mu- 
cous membrane of the mouth-cavity, which becomes a poorer 
conductor of warmth. The chief element in hunger, also, is 
probably that of pressure, brought about by some chemical  
-P-A-G-E-76
‘54 A First Book in Psychology 
  action on the lining of the stomach. What is called nausea 
is a still more complex experience, but its essential ingredient 
is pressure, due to the antiperistaltic reflexes of the oesophagus. 
The alleged respiratory sensations, such as breathlessness, 
suffocation, and stuffiness, are evidently experiences including 
several elements: first, and most important, pressure-sen- 
sations; often also, sensations of strain, as when one holds 
one’s breath; and, finally, for most people, a visual image 
of the part of the body — chest or throat — which is affected. 
The ‘circulatory’ sensations are either, like itching and fever- 
ishness, compounds of warmth and pressure-sensations, or 
else they are the massive pressure-sensations from abnor- 
mally strong heart-beat. 
These ‘organic’ experiences, though seldom attended to, 
are nevertheless of great significance, for they may form part 
of our most complex ideas and moods. Emotions are, as we 
shall see, especially rich in ‘organic’ sensations. When, for 
example, I am afraid, my heart flutters; when I am grieved, 
my throat is choked; when I am perplexed, there is a weight 
on my chest. And though I concern myself little with these 
seemingly unimportant experiences, they none the less effec- 
tively color my moods.* 
The cerebral condition of pressure-sensation, whether 
from external or from internal excitation, is, in the view 
of most physiologists, excitation of the region about the 
fissure of Rolando.’ From this centre, motor nerves 
spread outward and downward to all muscles of the body 
(and limbs) and pressure-sensations are, therefore, normally 
accompanied and followed by bodily movements of all 
"varieties.

  Elemental Pain Experience 55 
| VI. ELEMENTAL. PAIN EXPERIENCE 
The pin point which, gently applied, excites first a sensa- 
tional experience of pressure, may bring about, an instant 
later, a very different sort of consciousness, that of pain. 
This is evidently distinct from all other sensation-elements 
through stimulation of the skin, and no good observer con- 
fuses the pressure-consciousness with the pain due to a heavy 
weight. But it is perhaps less easy to realize that the con- 
sciousness of pain is quite distinct from that of unpleasantness. 
It is unpleasant, for example, not painful, to discover that 
one has given to the deck steward twice too large a fee; and 
‘the sight of the rose-pink gown of the lady with auburn hair 
is unpleasant and not painful. The confusion is mainly due 
to the fact that the sensational experience of pain is always 
accompanied by unpleasantness. In the case of apparent 
exceptions, as of the slight pain which we intentionally inflict 
upon ourselves to see how it will feel, the pleasantness is 
probably that of the novelty, not of the pain. But it does not 
follow from the fact that pains are always unpleasant, that 
unpleasantnesses are always painful, still less that the two are 
identical. Our first conclusion, therefore, is that painfulness, 
an experience which follows upon the burning, bruising, or 
cutting of the skin and upon certain internal changes, is 
different from unpleasantness or disagreeableness. 
Some psychologists believe that there is one quality of pain, 
as of pressure, and that the experiences which we differentiate 
as acute, dull, stinging, gnawing pains are qualitatively the 
same, though differing in intensity, perhaps in extensity or 
bigness, and in steadiness. Professor Ebbinghaus, on the 
other hand, teaches that there are two pain-qualities, the
-P-A-G-E-78
  56 A First Book in Psychology 
consciousness of acute (stechend) and of dull (dumpf) 
pain.* 
When we ask for the physical condition of pain we are met 
by an unusual relation. For every other form of sense-qual- 
ity we have found a definite, even if vaguely characterized, 
physical stimulation. In the case of pain, however, it is 
obvious at once that no specific form of energy occasions it, 
but that the same stimuli which excite sensations of pressure, 
warmth, and cold, and possibly even those which excite visual 
and auditory sensations, may bring about painfulness also, if 
only they are very intense, long-continued, or often repeated. 
Hard or long-continued pressure, intense heat and cold, and 
‘possibly blinding lights and crashing sounds may be called 
painful; whereas excessive sweetness and heavy fragrance, 
are merely unpleasant. 
It used to be held that just as, physically, pain seems due 
to high degrees of mechanical and thermal stimulus, so, 
physiologically, it must be referred to excessive functioning 
of pressure (perhaps, also, of warmth and cold) end-organs. 
But this is disproved by the fact that certain anesthetics 
destroy the sensitiveness of the skin to pain stimuli, 
whereas other drugs make the skin insensitive to pressure. , 
If the oculist treats one’s eye with cocaine, one is distinctly 
conscious of the contact of his instruments, but feels no pain; 
a similar use of saponin annihilates pressure-sensations and 
leaves pain. Furthermore, ‘pain-spots’ have been found on 
various areas of the skin t — whereas, from ther parts, large 
areas of the cheeks, for example, they aré,lacking. When 
these spots are excited by any stimulus, or or thermal,

  Elemental Experiences of Temperature 57 
electrical or chemical, consciousness of pain without 
pressure results. Either, then, the skin must contain 
special end-organs of pain *’” — as most physiologists now 
hold—or, as Goldscheider the discoverer of pain-spots 
suggests, pain is physiologically due not to the activity of 
any nerve end-organs in the skin but to a transforma- 
tion, in the gray substance of the spinal cord, of 
nerve-excitations conveyed from especially exposed pressure- 
organs. 
Pain-sensation, like pressure-sensation, may be excited 
within the body; yet the abdominal organs are, in the main, 
insensitive to mechanical and thermal stimulation, “may be 
handled, pinched, or cauterized,” as Foster says, “ without 
pain or indeed any sensation being felt.” The consciousness 
of pain is, however, conditioned by excitation of the exter- 
nal peritoneum and the lining of the abdomen, and by press- 
ure against the diaphragm. No special cerebral centre of 
pain is known. Movements of avoidance and withdrawal 
accompany the experience. 
‘VII. ExementaL EXPERIENCES OF TEMPERATURE 
Experiences of warmth, cold, and hotness are grouped 
together because of apparent similarity. Nobody questions 
that the consciousness of warmth and that of cold are ele- 
mental experiences, further unanalyzable and radically dif- 
ferent from other sorts of sensational consciousness — from 
the consciousness of pain or of pressure, for example. It is 
less easy to classify, introspectively, the sensational experience 
of hotness. Clearly, it is not, as is often assumed, merely 
an intenser consciousness of warmth. But whether it is a 
third elemental experience or a complex of warmth and
-P-A-G-E-80
  58 : A First Book in Psychology 
pain consciousness is harder to determine. Evidently many 
intensities of warmth, cold, and hotness are distinguish- 
able. 
No direct relation can be discovered between the degree 
of the thermometer and the cold, or warmth, or heat sensa- 
tion. In other words, we are not always warm when the 
thermometer registers a high degree, and cold when it stands 
at a low figure. On the contrary, the room which seems 
warm to me as I enter it after a brisk walk seems chilly an 
hour later, though the height of the mercury is unchanged; 
and if I warm one hand and cool another, the same lukewarm 
water will seem cool to the first and warm to the second.* 
These experiences, and others like them, seem clearly to 
show that the surface sensation of warmth or of cold or of 
heat is not determined by the actual temperature of an organ, 
but by the relation between the temperature of an organ 
and that of its environment. When the physical temperature 
of the organ exceeds that of its environment, the sensation is 
of cold; and, on the other hand, when the temperature falls 
below that of the environment, one has the experience of 
warmth, changing — as we have seen — at a certain point to 
that of heat. 
The thermal stimulation of the skin is occasioned in 'two 
ways: by radiation of heat from outer objects and by mus- 
cular activity, which means loss of energy in the form of 
heat. I may grow warm, for example, by basking in the sun, 
or by swinging dumb-bells. Not the skin as a whole, how- 
ever, but certain definite end-organs are affected. This is 
shown by applying warm and cold surfaces of very small 
extent to different parts of the body. A bit of metal may

-P-A-G-E-81
  i Elemental Experiences of Temperature 59 
be moved along for some little distance on the surface of 
the body, without rousing the experience of cold, which, 
however, will suddenly occur as the stimulus reaches one 
‘of the ‘cold spots’ over an end-organ of cold. There are 
fewer of these than of pressure or. pain spots, and the 
warmth-spots are least frequent of all and most scattered.* 
The cornea of the eye is sensitive to cold, but not to press- 
ure; and both warmth and cold spots are found within 
the mouth-cavity where no pain-spots have been discovered. 
Most of the inner surfaces of the body, however, seem to lack 
warmth and cold end-organs. Even the mucous lining of 
the mouth-cavity is less sensitive than the outer skin, so that 
one may drink, with perfect comfort, coffee which seems un- 
bearably hot if it touches the lip.” 
The specific end-organs of warmth and of cold have not 
been definitely determined. But experiment seems to show 
quite conclusively that I feel hotness when end-organs for 
cold and for warmth are simultaneously excited. No special 
‘cerebral centre is known, and no peculiarly characteristic 
movements follow. i} 
With this consideration of our consciousness of warmth 
and of cold we have come to the end of our account of the 
elemental sensational experiences embedded in perception 
and imagination.{ Two points must be touched upon, in 
conclusion. It must be noted in the first place that a sen- 
sational quality always occurs in close combination with an 
intensity and often with an extensity. One is, for example, 
simultaneously conscious of bigness, brightness, and blue- 
ness as one looks at the summer sky. The fusion of quality t

tT Cf. above, p. 14.
-P-A-G-E-82
  60 A First Book in Psychology 
with intensity (and with bigness) is called sensation. Some 
psychologists treat the sensation as unit of perception and 
describe the qualities, — of color, pitch, and the like, — the 
intensities — brightnesses, loudnesses, and so on — and the 
extensities, not as ‘sensational elements but as attributes of 
sensation.”® 
The succeeding chapter will speak further of fusions. 
In the meantime, a word must be said of the physiological 
conditions of perception and imagination. In ordinary 
perception, some sensational elements are excited. throvgh 
stimulation of end-organs (that is, ‘peripherally’ excited), 
whereas all sensational elements in imagination are con- 
ditioned by brain excitation (‘centrally’ excited). So, when 
I imagine the Theatre of Dionysos, at Athens, only my oc- 
cipital lobe is excited, but when I look out at Symphony Hall, 
my retina is excited as well; when I imagine the flute-like 
song of the hermit thrush, only my temporal lobe is excited; 
but when I hear the telephone bell ring, the inner organs of 
my cochlea are in vibration. 
It should be noted that this account of the physiological 
condition of perception does not hold in the case of the halluci- 
nation. The hallucination, like the illusion, is a perception 
which does not directly correspond with any external ob- 
ject.* Both hallucination and illusion are perception — that 
is, involuntary and predominantly sensational experience, 
reflectively attributed to other people, of objects regarded as 
impersonal and external. But whereas the illusion includes 
peripherally excited elements, a hallucination contains only 
centrally excited sense-elements. The dream or delirium

(z). On Hallucinations, cf. Appendix, Section XV.

  Elemental Experiences of Temperature 6r 
image of a ghost, for example, is a hallucination, because 
it is not excited by any external object, whereas the tradi- 
tional confusion of window-curtain with ghost is an illusion. 
Evidently, therefore, the hallucination, though a form of 
perception, is not ese by physiological condition, 
from imagination. 
There is perhaps a danger lest this long, though at every 
point abbreviated, study of ourselves as sensationally con- 
scious may retard our apprehension of the essential nature of 
our perceiving and imagining. We run the risk of not seeing 
the woods for the trees — of missing the figure for the de- 
tails. For this reason, we shall here again summarize the 
basal conclusions of the two preceding chapters without spe- 
cial reference to the structural analysis undertaken in this 
chapter. According to these conclusions, perception, like 
imagination, is the complex and predominantly sensational 
consciousness of a particularized impersonal object in 
relation to myself. But the perceiving self differs from 
the imagining self (1) in that it knows itself to be 
involuntarily conscious; (2) in that it may later regard 
itself as having shared its experience with unparticularized 
other selves; and (3) in that it regards its impersonal object 
as external, that is, independent, and present. The imag- 
ining self, on the other hand, to some degree controls its ex- 
perience, which, accordingly, is regarded as more ‘ private’ 
and as normally unshared; and its objects are not present. 
To recur to our initial example: I am_ sensationally 
conscious both of the desk which I see and of the Tyro- 
lese landscape which I imagine; but I realize that I 
am inevitably conscious of this external desk, whereas 
I may direct my ‘attention away from my mountain-

image; and (as I later reflect), I share my consciousness 
of the desk with the housemaid who dusts it, whereas she 
does not know that I am imagining snowy mountains any 
more than I know what enthralling image brings the smile to 
her lips and diverts her attention from the dustiest corner of 
the desk. '

  CHAPTER IV 
PERCEPTION AND IMAGINATION AS COMBINATION AND 
DIFFERENTIATION .OF ELEMENTS 
A. PERCEPTION AND IMAGINATION AS FUSION AND ASSIMI- 
| LATION 
Ir has been shown, in the preceding chapters, that sensa- 
tional elements may be distinguished within perception and 
imagination. It is necessary now toemphasize the fact that in 
ordinary perceiving and imagining one is not aware of these 
elemental constituents of consciousness, the different qualities, 
intensities, and extensities. Such analysis is the reflective 
work of the psychologist, not the immediate experience of the 
perceiving self. Thus, one’s immediate consciousness of a 
tone is an undistinguished, unitary consciousness, and is 
not an awareness of a pitch, an intensity and a timbre, 
though, in after-reflection, we discover these factors in the 
tone-consciousness, and though it is due to distinguishable 
physical and physiological conditions. Similarly, the imme- 
diate consciousness of a tone sounded simultaneously with 
its ‘octave is rarely an experience of two tones as distin- 
guishable from each other, though united; indeed, it is 
often difficult to differentiate these tones even by an effort 
of attention. 
The unity of an experience, in this merely negative sense 
of the absence of differentiation, is often known as fusion.’ * 
* These Arabic numerals, throughout this chapter, refer to numbered 
divisions (§§) of the Appendix, Section IV. 
| Y 63  
-P-A-G-E-86
  64 A First Book in Psychology 
By fusion is meant, therefore, the absence of discrimination 
in an experience which is nevertheless due to several end- 
organ excitations, and in which therefore after-reflection 
can distinguish different elements. The combination, for 
example, of the Cand G, the loudness, and the volume of a 
given chord, is a case of fusion; and so is the combination of 
the experiences of redness, yellowness, colorless light, bright- 
ness, bigness, odor, coolness, pressure through joint and skin 
stimulation, and of pleasure, from an apple which one is 
rolling about in one’s hand. Each one of the combined or 
fused elements must be directly excited by the stimulation of 
an end-organ, and not merely indirectly excited through the 
stimulation, by connecting fibres, of the corresponding brain- 
centres. 
Fusions differ from each other only in the degree of close- 
ness with which the diverse elements are connected, and this 
is tested by the difficulty of the analysis in different cases. 
The closest fusions which we know are those of the different 
elements invariably connected in a sensation, the quality, 
intensity, and extensity.* Almost, if not quite, as close as 
this fusion is that of a color with colorless light: this is 
the closest combination which we know of different qualities. 
Other examples are the fusion of taste and smell in many so- 
called tastes, of the experiences of pressure and of tempera- 
ture in what is named touch, and of the consciousness of 
extensity and pressure in the experience of smoothness or of 
roughness. , i 
Assimilation is the negative unity, that is, the absence of 
discrimination, in an experience realized as including 
' simpler experiences of which one (at least) is a recurring

  Fusion and Assimilation. 65. 
consciousness, cerebrally excited. As I look, for example, 
at a polished marble or at a velvet cloak, I get (besides the 
experiences of color and form, light and shade) a distinct 
impression of its texture, even though I do not touch it. Such 
a texture-feeling is, of course, cerebrally excited (for the end- 
organs in my fingers are not stimulated), and I explain it as 
due to my past simultaneous experience of similar light-effects 
with feeling of roughness or of smoothness. Every adult per- 
ception is an assimilation as well as a fusion of simpler experi- 
ences. ‘I perceive the automobile, — that is, I am conscious 
of its color, form, and motion, — though the only experience 
peripherally excited is the auditory consciousness of puffing 
and ringing. And I perceive the orange which the child in 
the street-car seat behind me is eating, — I am conscious of 
its color, and roundness, and rough, cool ‘feel,’ — though 
only my olfactory end-organs are excited. The reason in 
both cases is that I have often before received simultane- 
ously the different sorts of impression. It follows, of course, 
that every perception is the result not only of present 
stimulation but of past experience: that a man _per- 
ceives more than a child, and a child than a savage. The 
baby, for example, burns his hand because his visual 
perception of flame does not include the assimilated con- 
sciousness of heat; and the West Indian negro carries the 
wheelbarrow on his head because his perception of it does 
not include the assimilated consciousness of its being 
wheeled.*. * ’ 
* The term ‘assimilation’ is used, in this section, as equivalent to ‘simul- 
taneous association.’ For the distinction often made between these expres- 
sions, see Appendix, Section VII. (§ 1). For discussion of Successive 
Association, see Chapter VII,

B. PERCEPTION AND IMAGINATION AS REALIZED COMBI 
NATION AND DIFFERENTIATION 
Perception, like imagination, is sensational consciousness, 
and is, thus, a unity in the negative sense that the perceiver 
fails to differentiate elements of consciousness which are 
distinguishable to after-reflection. But both perception and 
imagination include also a certain consciousness, very often 
vague and unemphasized, of the connectedness, the harmony, 
the ‘together-ness’ (to borrow a term from Dickens), and 
at the same time of the distinctness, of sense-elements. These 
experiences of unity and of distinctness may be called forms 
of elemental relational consciousness. ‘They are more promi- 
nent in recognition, in thought, and in will than in perception 
and imagination; and the detailed discussion of them will 
consequently be postponed to later chapters.* Yet the con- 
sciousness of combination, or together-ness, and of distinct- 
ness, or apartness, form a part of certain experiences so pre- 
dominantly sensational that they are best treated’as forms of 
perception and imagination. Three such experiences form 
the topic of this chapter, but only one of these, the conscious- 
ness of space, will be considered in any detail. 
I. THe ConsctousnEss oF SPACE 
a. The Elements of the Space Consciousness 
In my consciousness of space are structural elements of 
three sorts: first and foremost, the sensational consciousness, 
visual or tactual, of mere extensity or bigness; second, certain 
relational experiences of distinctness and unification; third. 
the sensational experiences, mainly tactual, due to move- 
* Cf. Chapter VIII., pp. 137 ff. :
-P-A-G-E-89
  ~ The Consciousness of Space 67 | 
ment of my limbs, or eyes, or body. The elementary con- 
sciousness of extensity or bigness is fused with our visual 
consciousness of color and colorless light and with our tactual 
consciousness of pressure. That is to say, we are conscious 
both of colors and of pressures as extended.?_ The conscious- 
ness of this blue or of this heavy object as more or less extended 
is, however, an indefinitely less complex experience than that 
which we call the consciousness of space. Such a conscious- 
ness of ‘mere extensity’ —a possible constituent, of the - 
experience of the new-born child — is not a consciousness 
of precise size, of definite form, or of exact position; it is 
not even a consciousness of surface or of depth; it is a 
vague, unrelated, elemental consciousness, to be compared, 
perhaps, with such spatial consciousness as a grown person 
has when opening his eyes in a dark room. This elemental 
consciousness of extensity may be discovered within all the 
complex varieties of our spatial consciousness. 
b. Important Varieties of Complex Spatial Consciousness 
1. The Consciousness of Apartness 
' The simplest form of my complex spatial consciousness is 
the experience, visual and tactual, of apartness or distance.* 
I see, for example, that my ink-bottle stands apart from my 
paper-weight; and I am conscious, with closed eyes, that the 
collar and the cuff which chafe me are apart from each other. 
Some psychologists have regarded the experience of apartness 
as an elemental consciousness incapable of further analysis, 
but careful introspection will disclose that it is made up of a 
consciousness of the two-ness, or duality (of sense objects or 
qualities) fused with a consciousness of intervening exten- 
sity. Thus, when I perceive that a red dot lies apart from 
|
-P-A-G-E-90
    * 68 A First Book in Psychology 
a blue dot, I am simultaneously conscious (1) of the redness 
and the blueness, (2) of their distinctness, and (3) of a certain | 
extensity (that of a portion of the sheet on which the dots are 
written) as (4) condition of the distinctness of the dots. I 
am conscious, in other words, of extensity intervening be- 
tween two colors. And when, with eyes closed, I am con- 
scious that a warm object lies, at some distance from a cold 
object, on my arm, I experience the cold and the warmth, 
the distinctness, or two-ness, of them, and, once more, an 
intervening extensity. The nature and conditions of this 
complex experience of apartness must be studied in some- 
what more detail. To begin with the experience of two- 
ness: light-stimuli falling about .004 to .oo6 millimetre 
apart on the retina are realized as two.‘ With cutaneous 
stimulation the case is different: Experiment has shown 
that the consciousness of two-ness does not follow on a two- 
fold stimulation of closely contiguous spots on all parts of 
the skin. If two points be placed upon any surface of the 
skin, some distance may be found at which they will excite 
the consciousness, not of two pressures, but of a single one. 
This distance varies in different localities, and is smaller on 
the mobile organs: about one millimetre, for example, on 
the tongue, two millimetres on the finger-tips, and sixty-five 
millimetres on the middle of the back. The areas within 
which two points are felt as one are called ‘sensory circles,’ 
and it is important to notice that they are relatively, not 
absolutely, defined. That is to say, the skin is, not mapped 
off into definite portions, such that a point near the edge of 
one portion is felt as distinct from.a very near point which, 
however, is over the border of the given ‘sensory circle.’ On 
the contrary, the distance between any two points felt as one
-P-A-G-E-91
  The Consciousness of A partness ; 69 
must be virtually the same in neighboring regions of the 
skin.* ’ 
The condition of the consciousness of two-ness is evidently, 
therefore, double excitation of skin or of retina (providing 
always that the stimulating objects be at sufficient objective 
distance from each other). The consciousness of an extensity 
as separating or intervening between these distinct stimuli 
cannot be so simply explained. It will be convenient to 
consider first the cutaneous and next the visual intervening 
extensity. (1) There is no objective, or physical, stimulus, 
of the experience of an extensity ‘between’ two pressures: 
two separated points touch my skin, and the intervening 
surface is not stimulated. Yet I am conscious of interven- 
ing extensity. The explanation is probably the following: 
When two points touch my skin, I not only perceive the pres- 
sure and the two-ness, but I imagine the extended pressure 
of an object ‘stimulating the intervening extensity. This 
imagination of an intervening extensity is. probably to be 
explained by the fact that the two pressure organs have most 
often been excited not by separate points, but by a single 
object exciting both at once.t On the physiological side, the 
explanation probably is the following: Nerve excitation 
spreads from the place of excitation to contiguous nerve- 
tracts, especially to. those which have been frequently excited 
together. Therefore, the cerebral excitation due to the stim- 
ulation of separated points of the skin tends to rouse the 
cerebral excitation corresponding to the frequent stimulation 
of the intervening area of the skin. 
(2) The case of the visual consciousness of intervening

  extensity appears more simple. The extensity which is real- 
ized as separating the red and the blue dots is that of the 
white background; and in retinal terms, end-organs or sub- 
stances, between those stimulated by the red and blue light 
are excited by white light. The problem, here, is to explain 
why — when the whole retina is stimulated by the white light 
from the paper background — just this particular part of the 
stimulating background should be realized as in especial 
relation to the red and the blue dots; in other words, why 
this particular part of the total consciousness of extended 
whiteness should be combined with the consciousness of dis- 
tinct red and blue. Again the explanation may be given in 
terms of habitual experience. Weare accustomed to the 
sight of objects with edges in accentuated color; and we see 
the ‘middle ground’ of these objects as extensity intervening 
between the two: borders. We therefore gain the habit of 
regarding that part of a background which lies between 
lines, or even between dots, rather than any other part of 
the background, as related to these lines or dots. 
2. The Consciousness of Form 
(a). Of Two-dimensional Form 
My spatial consciousness is'more than a mere awareness of 
extensity and apartness. I am at this moment, for example, 
conscious not only that my letter-paper has bigness and lies 
apart from my penwiper, but also that the paper is oblong’ 
and the penwiper round; and I am furthermore conscious 
that the paper is flat and the ink-bottle cubical. I am con- 
scious, in other words, of two-dimensional and of three- 
dimensional form. 
‘The consciousness of form differs from other sorts of spatial

{ The Consciousness of Form 71 
consciousness in that it explicitly includes the experience of 
unification of points. ‘The point’ is ‘the apart’; the form 
is a unification of points. The consciousness of two-dimen- 
sional form is almost certainly due, in part, to the movements 
made by eyeballs or hand in outlining or tracing an ob- 
ject; and probably, also, includes a vague consciousness of 
these outlining movements. Such movements are instinc- 
tively performed as one perceives an object.* When I am 
visually conscious of my paper as rectangular and then of my 
pen wiper as round, my eyeballs make two series of move- 
ments, characteristically and markedly differing from each 
other. If with closed eyes I am tactually conscious of these 
objects, my finger makes (or starts to make) in the one case 
a broken movement, in the other a sweeping movement, 
as it follows their outlines. Such outlining movements, 
whether of eye or of hand, may be more or less completely 
executed. The baby, who is finding out that the plate is 
round, continues the outlining, exploring movement of his 
finger all about its circumference. The grown person makes 
merely the first part of the movement; or he makes a slight 
and unnoticed movement. But these movements (of eye- 
balls, hands, and tongue) play an important part in the | 
development of the space-consciousness. The unattended- 
to ‘experience. of such movements (whether performed, and 
thus perceived, or merely imagined) probably constitutes 
a part of my consciousness of two-dimensional, or surface,

forms. The experience of surface-form may, thus, be de- 
scribed as a fusion of (r) the sensational experiences of ex- 
tensity and of sense quality due to excitation of end-organs 
bystimulating object; (2) the relational experiences of distinct- 
ness and of unification; and (3) the experiences, also sensa- 
tional, due to the instinctive movements of the eyeballs and 
hand.

furnish a good example. The straight line, a—0, for instance,

attraction of the eye, as it follows the horizontal line inward 
toward the oblique lines. An inattentive consciousness of 
these movements seems to be part of a consciousness of form. 
(6) The Consciousness of Three-dimensional Form 
The consciousness of three-dimensional or depth form has 
still to be discussed.* I am conscious not only of rectilinear 
and circular figures, but of cubical and spherical forms. 
Our present problem concerns the nature and the conditions
-P-A-G-E-95
  \ 
| The Consciousness of Form 73 
of this experience of depth. Some psychologists hold that it 
is an elementary experience, differing from the consciousness 
of surface-extensity somewhat as the consciousness of red 
differs from that of green. The more usual and, in the view 
of the writer, the truer opinion is the following: The con- 
sciousness of depth-form is not an elementary and unanalyz- , 
able experience; rather, it is a consciousness of two-dimen- 
sional form fused with a very complex but very vague con- 
sciousness of the bodily movements necessary for apprehen- j 
sion of the object. These movements are either movements 
of the body-as-a-whole, or (in the case of such three-dimen- 
sional objects as are within grasp) movements of arm and 
hand outward from the body. Thus, the consciousness of 
the three-dimensional form of a house includes a conscious- 
ness of my body moving toward it and around it; and the 
consciousness of the depth-form, the specifically cylindrical 
character, of a barrel probably includes a dim consciousness 
of the movements by which I explore its form, as out- 
ward from my body. The notable feature of the conscious- 
ness of solid or depth-form is thus mot the occurrence or con- 
sciousness of bodily movements, — for this belongs also to 
the experience of surface-form, — but the realized character 
of these movements as either motions of the body-as-a-whole 
or as movements of one of the limbs from or toward the-rest 
of the body. 
It is important to realize that this consciousness of the body, 
which is so inherent a part of the consciousness of depth, 
is not instinctive but, rather, very gradually developed. I, 
grown-up person, feel — let us say — the pressure of one hand 
which I lay upon the other. The little baby may make a 
precisely similar movement of his hand and may gain a pre-
-P-A-G-E-96
  74 A First Book in Psychology 
cisely similar touch consciousness. But he has not yet con- 
sciousness of his hand or of his body; that is to say, he does 
not connect the visual consciousness (the ‘look’) with the 
tactual consciousness (the ‘ feel’) of his hand at rest; nor does 
he connect the tactual consciousness, due to excitation of 
joint and muscle, of his moving hand with the visual appear- 
ance of it. Indeed he does not realize the identity of hand at 
rest with moving hand; and still less is he conscious of any 
connection between hand, foot, and head. Not till the baby 
becomes conscious of all these experiences as related, and as 
relatively permanent, or reproducible, has he a consciousness 
of his hand; and in similar fashion he must gain the conscious- 
ness of other parts of the body, and of the body as a unified 
whole. 
An important condition of the depth consciousness is the 
occurrence of right and left eye images differing slightly. 
The experience of closing first one eye, then the other, when 
looking directly at a solid object, will convince every one that 
the right ‘sees’ slightly more to the right of a given object, 
the left eye rather more to the left of the object. The facts 
of stereoscopy” prove that the simultaneous occurrence of 
such images is followed by the depth consciousness; for in 
looking through a stereoscope with eyes unmoving and 
parallel, pictures drawn separately for right and for left eye 
fall upon the two retine; and I see the pictured object as 
single and solid.* The occurrence of right and left images 
is not, however, an essential or invariable condition of the 
consciousness of tridimensional form, for experiment shows 
that, with one eye closed, I may perceive depth. In this case 
a muscular change im the accommodation, and thus in the

refractiveness, of the eye may condition the depth experience; 
or some visual character, perhaps the distribution of shadow 
on the object, may suggest it.* 
3. Localization: The Consciousness of Position 
My spatial consciousness includes, finally, the consciousness 
of position. I am conscious not only that the paper is oblong 
and the ink-bottle cubical; but also that the ink-bottle lies 
behind the paper and to the right of the letter-scale. I am 
conscious also that the date of my letter is written above the 
signature; I am conscious that the palm of my hand is touched 
near the thumb by a heated object, and touched near the 
little finger by a cold object; finally, I am perhaps conscious 
that a piano is being played above me. 
It is usual to group all cases of localization in two classes : 
of three-dimensional and two-dimensional localization, as we 
name them. The experience of the horizon or of the stars or 
of the outgoing ship as far away from me, and the experience 
of the ink-bottle as behind the paper, or of the desk as beyond 
the chair, are cases of three-dimensional localization. Expe- 
riences of the name as below the date, or of the cold object as 
inward from the warm object, seem to be instances of the 
consciousness of two-dimensional position. Localization of 
either sort differs from the consciousness of form, in that it 
emphasizes apartness rather than unification. Yet localiza- 
tion, the consciousness of position, is more than mere con- 
sciousness of apartness, for one is sometimes conscious of 
objects as apart without being conscious of their position. 
. One is sometimes conscious, for example, of the spatial 
distinctness of two stimulated points of the skin without 
* Cf. below, pp. 77 ff.
-P-A-G-E-98
  76 A First Book in Psychology 
  being able to designate either one as above or below, 
right or left, of the other. In truth, the consciousness of 
position includes, besides the bare realization of apartness, a 
specific consciousness, emphasized or unemphasized, of the 
body or of parts of the body. Thus, ‘up’ means ‘near the 
head,’ and conversely, ‘down’ means ‘near the feet.’ ‘ Right’ 
means ‘toward the more readily moving hand.’ ‘Out’ and 
‘in, ‘in front’ and ‘behind,’ are terms used with reference 
to the body as a whole in its relation to the field of vision. 
It follows — since all localization involves the conscious- 
ness (in itself three-dimensional) of the body in movement 
—that there is no strictly two-dimensional localization. 
Three-dimensional localization is a consciousness of the 
apartness of an object from my body, and includes the con- 
sciousness of a movement imagined, initiated, or completed, 
of my whole body (or of a limb ‘outward’ from my whole 
body). Thus, the consciousness that the sky is over me in- 
cludes a vague consciousness of my body floating upward, 
and the consciousness that the cake plate is in front of me 
includes the movement, or tendency to movement, of my 
arm. In its developed form, three-dimensional localization 
involves a consciousness of three-dimensional space, an 
image gradually built up by the imagined addition of dis- 
tance to distance, in all directions, from my body. So-called 
two-dimensional localization, the consciousness, for example, 
that the red stripe of the plaid is above the blue one, is 
conditioned by movement (complete or incomplete, imagined 
or perceived) of eye or of hand toward the head. It thus 
involves a reference to the body and is consequently rightly 
classed as three-dimensional. 
Three-dimensional localization in space — the conscious-
-P-A-G-E-99
  Localization 1 
ness of objects as near or far from my body, as in front or 
behind, to right or to left of me — is of great biological sig- 
nificance. An animal able to react promptly and accurately 
to the sight, sound, or touch which reveals the presence of 
dangerous foe, of friend, or of mate is evidently favored in the 
struggle for existence. It follows that the localizing reactions, 
and the consciousness of them, must have been advanced 
by the extinction of poor localizers and by the preservation 
and propagation of good ones. 
Visual localization is conditioned by muscular changes, 
chiefly of two kinds. When (within certain limits) an object 
is moved nearer or farther from the eyes, there is first a change 
in ‘accommodation,’ * that is, in the contraction of the 
ciliary muscle, such that the crystalline lens of the eye either 
bulges farther forward or is more flattened, thus becoming 
more or less refractive as the object is nearer or farther; there 
is, second, a change in the convergence of the two eyes such 
that the angle of convergence is more or less acute according 
as the object is farther or nearer. As I look, for example, 
from the sail on the horizon to the rosebush at my window- 
sill, my eyes converge. 4 
Other conditions of the consciousness of visual distance are, 
first, the occurrence of differing retinal images,* and second, 
a number of so-called ‘signs’ of distance, notably: (x) the 
distribution of shadows, (2) the apparent interference of inter- 
; vening objects, and (3) mistiness of the atmosphere. The 
significance of these factors may be shown in many ways. 
Thus, a mask, hollow side to the observer, if so placed that

  no shadows are cast inside it, will seldom look concave; the 
arch in the design here outlined seems to lie behind the pillar; 
and, since far-away objects appear hazy, hills and trees and 
houses look farther away on a misty day, while the horizon line 
‘seems almost to strike one in the face on a very clearday. That 
is, indeed, a reason why painters love foggy days and misty 
landscapes more than the high 
lights and brutal frankness of 
phenomenallyclearatmospheres. 
In no one of these cases is the 
consciousness of shadows, of 
intervening objects, or of hazi- 
ness a constituent of the experi- 
ence of depth. Rather, these 
Fic. s.—(From Sanford,“ Ex. €XPeriences have so often accom- 
perimental Psychology,” p. 205.) panied the depth consciousness 
that they at once excite, or suggest, it. 
Auditory localization has next to be considered — the 
experience, for example, that a mosquito is buzzing behind 
me or that a street-car is approaching from the right. Such 
localization may be described as consciousness of the position   
of a sounding object as above or below, before or behind, to 
right or to left, of my body: it includes a vague consciousness 
of a more or less incomplete movement toward thé sounding 
object. Recent experimental investigations have concerned 
themselves with the nature and the conditions of auditory 
localization.° It has been experimentally established that 
sounds from the right are never confused with sounds from 
the left, that sounds from in front are constantly confused 
with sounds from behind, and yet that two sounds, close to- 
gether, are best discriminated when given in front or behind.
-P-A-G-E-101
  Localization ? 99 
These facts are best explained by the hypothesis, experi- 
‘mentally tested, that the chief condition of the consciousness 
of auditory position is the comparative intensity of sounds 
as stimulating the right and the left ears. A sound front 
the right stimulates the organs of the right ear strongly, 
those of the left ear faintly; and it calls out a movement or 
tendency to movement of the head toward the right. On the ' 
contrary, a sound from exactly in front and a sound from 
behind stimulate right and left ears with equal intensity and 
are readily confused. ‘Two sounds, finally, given close to- 
gether, in front or behind, are well discriminated because a 
change in the ratio of intensities, received by the two ears — 
from sounds which readily reach both, is easily perceptible. —— 
The measurement of the mere distance or apartness of sounds °® 
from my body is mainly, as experiments have shown, an 
inference from the greater or less intensity of the sounds; 
though the consciousness of differences in timbre may con- 
tribute also to the distance consciousness.* 
The main results of this chapter may well be summarized 
ina concluding paragraph: The significant elemental con- 
stituents of the space-consciousness have been found to be: 
first, the sensational consciousness of extensity; second, re- 
lational experiences primarily of distinctness and of unifica- 
tion; thitd, the tactual sensational experiences due to move- 
ments of the body. The successive stages of the spatial 
consciousness,” it has appeared, are, first, the consciousness of 
mere apartness — a consciousness of extensity intervening 
between two colors or between two pressures; second, the 
consciousness of form, or unification of separated points ; 
third, the consciousness of position either of objects apart

    ¥o A First Book in Psychology 
from the body or of objects apart from each other. The 
consciousness of one’s body and, in particular, of bodily 
movements has been shown to be an important factor in the 
consciousness of position and of depth. 
The discovery of the importance of movement as condition 
of the space-consciousness, with the realization that a con- 
sciousness of movement is part of many spatial experiences, 
has given rise to a mistaken analysis of the consciousness of 
space —a denial of the occurrence of any elemental con- 
sciousness of extensity. According to this view, the conscious- 
ness of color or of pressure as ‘extended,’ ‘big,’ or ‘spread 
out’ consists solely in a consciousness of bodily movements 
gained by experience of the colored or tactual objects. This 
‘empiricist’ account of the spatial consciousness must, how- 
ever, be rejected.’ In the first place, it contradicts intro- 
spection, to which the bigness, or spread-outness, of an object 
surely is as distinct and unanalyzable a character as its 
blueness. The empiricist doctrine is in opposition, also, to 
the results of experiments on persons who have recovered, 
through operation, from total congenital blindness. Such 
persons are able to recognize at once a difference between 
round and square objects, seen and not touched. The em- 
piricist theory — that the extensity consciousness consists in 
the consciousness of eye or of hand movements — is founded 
on a correct analysis of our consciousness of form and of 
position, and on the correct observation that we learn, by 
experience only, to estimate sizes and to measure our move- 
ments to the actual distances of objects. But the proof of 
the significance of movement and the consciousness of move- 
ment, in our complex and developed consciousness of space,
-P-A-G-E-103

is no disproof of the occurrence of the elemental experience 
of extensity. 
II. THE CoNnsciousNEss OF HARMONY 
A second perceptual experience of combination with dif- 
ferentiation — a consciousness, as Ebbinghaus calls it, of 
‘unity in diversity’ —is that of auditory harmony." This 
consciousness of the differentiated unity of tones must be dis- 
tinguished carefully from tonal fusion. When one vibrating 
body, a string, rod, or plate of some musical instrument, is. 
set into motion, the untrained listener is conscious of a tonal 
fusion, a sound in which he does not distinguish different 
‘elements of pitch, but hears only the one pitch. The tone 
which he hears may, to be sure, be different from that which 
he would Hear if the string vibrated only as a whole; but 
he knows this difference (if, indeed, he is aware of it at all) 
as voluminousness or timbre, not as a combination of differ- 
ent pitch-elements.* The trained listener, on the other hand, 
is conscious of a unity of differentiated elements; and among 
‘these he recognizes not a single pitch, but several. These 
distinct elements of pitch are due to the fact that the vibrat- 
ing body vibrates both as a whole and also (more swiftly) in 
sections.f 
It thus appears that, for the trained listener, consciousness 
of harmony, that is, of a unity of different pitch-elements, is 
produced by the vibration in sections of a single vibrating 
body. In place of a fusion he experiences that combination 
of a lower, stronger tone, the fundamental, with one or more 
higher tones called overtones, partials, or harmonics. The 
* For experiment, cf. Sanford, 87a, 
+ For experiment, cf. Sanford, 88,
-P-A-G-E-104
  82 A First Book in Psychology 
lowest of these overtones is always at least an octave higher 
than the fundamental, that is to say, its vibration-rate is 
twice as great. For example, if the C-string of a violin be 
vibrated, the trained listener may hear a combination of the 
pitch-element C, its octave c, the g above the octave, and the 
c, e, and g of the next higher octave. 
(2) But untrained as well as trained listeners are conscious 
of harmony when, in the second place, combinations of air- 
waves are due to the simultaneous vibration of several dif- 
ferent bodies, instead of being due to the sectional vibration 
of a single body — string, rod, or plate* The consciousness 
of harmony is, in fact, physically conditioned by a combina- 
tion of air-waves such that their vibration numbers stand to 
each other in uncomplicated ratios as 1:2 or 2:3. The 
vibration ratios of the modern musical octave are: — 
Cape Pu G As Be 
8 9g 10 103 12 13$ 15 16 
The so-called perfect intervals are accordingly: the oc- 
tave (C-c), the fifth (C-G), and the fourth (C-F), with 
vibration ratios of 1: 2, 2: 3, and 3: 4, respectively. (To the 
untrained listener the octave, even when produced by the 
vibrations of different bodies, is ordinarily a fusion, not a har- 
mony — in other words, the two pitch-elements are not dis- 
tinguished.) 
Besides these perfect intervals or experiences of harmony, 
there are also the ‘imperfect intervals’ conditioned by the 
major third (C-E), the minor third (C-yE), the major sixth 
(C-A), and the minor sixth (C-pA), with vibration ratios,

respectively, of 4:5,5:6,3:5,and5:8. In these experiences 
the consciousness of the difference of the tones is relatively 
emphasized. When this consciousness of difference obliter- 
ates, or almost obliterates, that of unity, the agreeableness 
characteristic of the consciousness of harmony disappears, and 
we have the experience of discord or disharmony, conditioned 
by the union of air-waves of complicated vibration-ratios.!® 
The principal discordant intervals, with their vibration-ratios, 
are the major second (C-D), the minor second (C-»D), 
the major seventh (C-B), and the minor seventh (C-pB), 
with the vibration ratios 8:9, 15:16, 8:15, 9:16. 
The nature of the physiological processes, excited in the 
end-organs of the ear by these combinations of air-waves, 
and the nature of the cerebral processes, assumed to condi- 
tion the experiences of unity and of difference, are still 
topics of conjecture rather than of established hypothesis. 
The occurrence, however, of the consciousness of the har- 
mony of different tones is indisputable. 
III. THe Consciousness oF RHYTHM AND OF MELODY 
One is conscious of rhythm” in dancing, reading poetry, 
playing an instrument, and in watching the dance and listen- 
ing to poem or to music.* Such an experience of rhythm 
is a consciousness of the regular alternation of temporally 
distinct sense-phenomena, either bodily movements or sounds. 
It is based on the alternation of regularly varying bodily 
processes — in particular, on the alternations of short inspira- 
tion with long expiration, and of strong with weak pressures 
in walking. To quote from Professor Titchener: “As we run 
* For experiment, cf. Titchener, § 46; Myers, op. cit., Exps. 145-146. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  84 A First Book in Psychology 
or walk, the legs swing alternately, and with each leg swings 
the arm of the opposite side. Here we have the basis of the 
idea of rhythm; a strong sensation-mass from the leg whose 
foot rests upon the ground, the leg that carries the weight of 
the body, followed at equal intervals by a weak sensation-mass 
from the leg that swings through the air... . As the leg 
swings, the arm swings; and at the moment that the foot 
is set down, the arm pulls with its full weight upon the 
Shoulder...) 3.4128 
These natural tactual rhythms are, however, mere alter- 
nations of two bodily phases. Dance-rhythms and auditory 
rhythms —regular alternations of sounds, weaker and 
stronger, longer and shorter, are capable of much greater 
variation and are consequently far more complex. The unit 
of musical rhythm is a measure; measures are combined in 
phrases; and phrases are grouped in musical periods. The 
unit of word-rhythm is a poetic foot; and verse and stanza 
are progressively complex combinations of poetic feet. The 
consciousness of these more complex rhythms is an experience 
of group within group. : 
It is important to observe that auditory and motor rhythms 
are normally combined. The chorus-dance, out of which the 
drama developed, is an expression of this close relation be- 
tween the sensory and the motor nerve structures, which we 
illustrate whenever we keep time, with hand or foot, to music. 
The consciousness of melody ‘is a complex experience of a: 
rhythmic series of harmonious tones in which the harmony 
is successive, not simultaneous. As in the case of the rhythm- 
consciousness, the unified terms are temporally distinct. 
* “A Primer of Psychology,” revised edition, 1899, § 47.
-P-A-G-E-107
  Perception as Combination 85 
Fundamental, therefore, to both experiences, that of rhythm 
and of melody, is the consciousness of time. Just what this 
really is it is very hard to tell. Many psychologists hold 
that, at its core, the consciousness of time is a unique and 
indescribable experience. But such a view leaves open 
many questions: the relation, for example, of the conscious- 
ness of duration to the consciousness of succession, and the 
fundamental question whether our time-consciousness is (or 
includes) a unique personal attitude or a structural element. 
The writer of this book inclines to the view that the imme- - 
diate experience of the self as changing is the foundation for 
all forms of temporal consciousness, and that the temporal 
consciousness includes not, merely (1) a wealth of relational 
elements, and (2) such affective elements as are involved in 
regret, hope and fear, but (3) a certain elemental experience 
comparable to the elemental consciousness of extensity 
embedded in all experience of space. It is doubtful, how- 
ever, whether such a time-element should be grouped with 
the sensational elements of our experience. 
C. PERCEPTION AND IMAGINATION AS COMBINATION OF 
LimireED GROUPS OF SENSE-ELEMENTS 
The study of all these forms of perceptual unity shows 
clearly that in perception and imagination the consciousness 
of unity and of difference is combined with a limited group 
of sense-elements — that is, with a part only of the total 
sensational experience of the moment. Another way of 
stating this contrast between the sensational experience as 
undifferentiated total and perception as limited complex is 
in terms of the object of each. The merely sensational con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  86 A First Book in Psychology 
sciousness conditioned by any, combination of physical - 
stimuli has an object, the undistinguished mass of colors, 
sounds, pressures, and the like. The perceptual conscious- 
néss conditioned by the same stimuli has differentiated 
objects. The distinction may be illustrated by comparing 
my consciousness at this moment with that of the baby 
whom Iam holding in my arms. His sensational con- 
sciousness may be as rich as my own, for he is sensationally 
conscious of a totality of colors, brightnesses, bignesses, 
tones, and noises; but he has not yet the perception of, 
objects. The object of his consciousness is, rather, in the 
often-quoted words of James, a ‘great, blooming, buzzing 
confusion of undistinguished colors and sounds.’ This is 
an experience which the adult occasionally approximates — 
—for example, when, in his first waking moments, he is 
vaguely conscious of colors, warmth, pressures, and sounds 
which, as he slowly wakens, seem to range and round them- 
selves into wall, furniture, bed-coverings, and knock-upon- 
the-door. In a word, perception, like imagination, is the 
consciousness not of an undifferentiated totality but of 
differentiated objects. And the differentiation is plainly due 
to the habitual occurrence of certain experiences in close 
connection. So, when the experiences of wetness, whiteness, 
warmth, and sweetness have often enough coincided, the 
baby has the consciousness of milk; and when the experi- 
ences of redness, softness, woolliness, and roundness have 
often enough occurred together, he is conscious of the ball. 
The outcome of this chapter is, then, to amplify the ac- 
count of perception and imagination by regarding each as 
the fusion and assimilation of a limited group of sense- 
elements with the consciousness of unity. and of difference.

THE BODILY REACTIONS IN PERCEPTION AND IMAGI- 
NATION 
OF all so-called external objects, my body stands in closest 
relation to myself. It is related also in a twofold fashion 
to other external objects: through its sense-organs and 
ingoing nerves it is affected by them; through its out- 
going nerves and muscular contractions it affects them. 
Indeed, the physiological process. initiated by the exci- 
tation of a sense-organ is unfinished until it is terminated 
in a muscular contraction; in other words, a complete 
physiological process is neither sensory nor motor, but 
sensori-motor.* 
It was shown in Chapter III. that the different mddes of 
sensational experience — visual, tactual, and the rest — are 
marked off from one another not only by the excitation of 
different end-organs and of different cerebral areas, but by 
the characteristic bodily ,movements — of eyeball, hand, 
and tongue — which accompany them. This chapter will 
treat of perceptual bodily reactions and will describe them

impulsive. a 
(1) Perceptual reactions, and even sensational reactions 
of the more developed type, are codrdinated, or unified. 
The significance of this character will be clear if one contrast 
the behavior and the probable consciousness of a little baby 
with that of an older child in the presence of a visual object 
— let us say, of a woolly red ball. The older child fixes his 
eyes upon the ball, follows it, if it is moved toward one side, 
by his eyes and his turning head, and seizes hold of it if 
it is within reach. The week-old baby, far from fixating it, 
does not even converge his eyes upon it, for each eye still 
moves more or less independently of the other; he does not 
turn his head toward it if it is moved away; and though his 
hands move aimlessly and may accidentally strike the ball, 
the two hands do not meet on the ball, and there is no co- 
ordination of the complex movements necessary for seizing’ 
it. Yet the baby is reacting to the ball: his eyeballs make 
more movements, his hands flap more wildly than before the 
ball was held and moved before him. , Such a reaction, some- 
times called an ‘excess-reaction,’ is due to the diffusion of 
incoming nerve-impulses over outgoing nerves and muscles. 
It differs as widely from the unified and coérdinated move- 
ment characteristic of perception as the sensational con-   
sciousness of redness differs from the perception of a red 
object.* 
(2) Perceptual and therefore coérdinated bodily reactions 
tend, in the second place, to be repeated, that is, to become 
habitual. My reactions, at different times, to the same 
object or class of objects are closely alike. I make the

same jaw-movements whenever I eat, and I hold and move 
- my pen in the same fashion every day. These habitual 
movements are, as will appear, of twofold origin — in- 
stinctive or acquired.* 
(3) From thehabitualness of the perceptual reaction follows 
a noticeable character: itsrelativeimmediacy. The reaction 
which accompanies not only perception but also many forms 
of imagination, and even certain kinds of thinking, is rela- 
tively immediate as compared with the reactions distinguish- 
ing reasoning and choice. The distinction between imme- 
diate and delayed activity is, to be sure, relative and not ab- 
solute, but is readily made between extremes of the two classes. 
Hold out an apple —or, for that matter, a caterpillar — to 
a baby of eight months: he will promptly seize it and carry 
it to his mouth. Offer the same dainty to’a three-year 
old: he will hesitate. Memories of disagreeable tastes or 
of sharp penalties vie with the impulse to grasp at every 
object; his response, whether of advance or of withdrawal, 
is hesitating-and-delayed. Or again, shut away in a high 
cupboard the lunch of a hungry dog and of a hungry little 
boy. The dog’s response is immediate: he barks, he leaps 
up into the air, he runs madly around the room. For sev- 
eral minutes the boy makes no obvious motion; then he 
slowly piles footstool into chair, climbs. up and tries to 
open the cupboard door—again a case of delayed as, 
contrasted with relatively immediate reaction. These are 
examples of advantageously delayed reactions. In many 
situations, on the other hand, immediate perceptual _reac- 
tions, to dangerous.or to momentarily favorable environ- 
* On instinct and learning cf. the later sections of this chapter and 
Appendix, Section V,

ment, are of crucial importance for the individual and for 
the race. 
(4) The observation that the perceptual reaction isrelatively 
immediate must not lead to a confusion of it with the reflex 
reaction. A reflex act is an act which follows on a stimulus 
without intervening consciousness. It may be consciously 
performed; in other words, it may be accompanied by con- 
sciousness, but it is not excited, or invariably_preceded by, 
consciousness. I sip my coffee at the sight of the brimming 
cup and I move my fan to the sound of the music, that is to 
say, a-unified consciousness of the object precedes my reaction 
toit. In technical terms, my perceptual reaction is impulsive, 
not reflex; although the consciousness of reaction is a con- 
stituent of the complete perception. 
This statement leads to a final distinction. A perceptual 
reaction, though impulsive, isnot volitional. To pick up one’s 
handkerchief when one has dropped it is an impulsive act 
following on the consciousness of it as it lies on the ground; 
to throw one’s handkerchief to the lions (after the fashion of 
the lady in the poem), that one’s lover may risk his life to 
snatch it from them, is a volitional act. Or again, to pick up 
my cards from the table is an impulsive act, whereas to dis- 
card from a strong and not from a weak suit is a volitional 
act. The distinction is readily stated. Both perceptual 
and volitional reaction are conditioned by consciousness; 
in technical terms, both are ideo-motor acts. But only the 
volitional, not the perceptual, act is planned or anticipated. 
I do not say to myself: ‘I will drink this coffee, or move this 
fan,”’ but the bare sight of coffee or of fan excites the habitual 
reaction. The perceptual reaction is sometimes, indeed, 
opposed tomy will. For example, I may drink the coffee —
-P-A-G-E-113
  The Bodily Reactions in Perception and Imagination 91 
in spite of having definitely planned to delay coffee-drinking 
until after taking my tonic; and I may find myself moving 
my fan, even though I am deeply principled against keeping 
time to music. It must be noted, in conclusion, that im- 
_pulsive movements are not always preceded by perception 
or by-imagination ; they may follow on any undeliberative 
consciousness. Such an impulse conditioned by sensation 
or by emotion may be, unlike the perceptual reaction, un- 
coérdinated. 
The main distinctions made in the last two paragraphs 
may be summarized as follows : —

as either acquired or-instinctive, and as either habitual or 
_seldom performed. In the remainder of this chapter, we 
shall study instinct, habit, and acquisition, or learning; but 
instead of confining our attention to bodily reactions we 
shall consider also the instinctive, the habitual, and the 
learning consciousness.

II. Instinct, Hapit, AND LEARNING 
a. INSTINCT 
The instinctive bodily reaction is the innate, or unlearned 
reaction; and similarly the instinctive consciousness is the 
natural, the temperamental psychic.attitude.For example, 
the movements which I make in drinking are instinctive, 
whereas my reactions to my knife and fork have been 
learned, perhaps with toil and pain. The study of biology 
substantiates the fact, open to ordinary observation, that. 
instinctive reactions are common to all members of a 
family or species — that all ducks take to the water, all 
dogs bark, all normal children learn to talk. Obviously, 
these instinctive reactions are hereditary; and all perma- 
nent instincts are useful in the perpetuation or development 
of the race. 
Instincts may be classified from several points of view. 
Most fundamental, perhaps, is the distinction between the 
altruistic, adaptive instincts of approach and surrender, 
the instincts of caressing and giving, for example, and the 
egoistic instincts of aversion and opposition, such as flight 
and pugnacity. A study of instincts, grouped in this way, 
discloses the fact that the greater number of them are-pri- 
marily social — reactions_to_persons and not Be a merely 
impersonal environment. ‘ 
Other classifications of instinct may profitably be con- 
sidered. There is a contrast between habitual instincts ~ 
such as walking and swimming, and the instinctive “move-_ 
ments which are seldom, or even once, performed — the 
reaction, for example, of the yucca-moth to the flower 
which, once only, it fertilizes with the pollen of another
-P-A-G-E-115
d 
Instinct, Habit, and Learning 93 
flower that opens on one night only. More important, 
practically, is a chronological distinction. There are early 
instincts, such as pecking and sucking, and deferred in- 
stincts — biting, for example. Indeed, specific instincts, 
mental as well as bodily, mark off successive life stages from 
“each _other.* The final distinction, pedagogically most 
important of all, is that between modifiable and unmodifi- 
able instincts.. Professor James is probably correct in his 
‘contention, that the main difference, from this standpoint, 
between animals and men is not, as usually stated, that 
animals have:‘many instincts and human beings only a few. 
On the contrary, the difference seems to be simply this: 
that animal instincts are largely unmodified, whereas human 
instincts are altered, transformed, sometimes_completely 
“checked (or inhibited). A later paragraph of this chapter 
will discuss this control of the instincts. 
6. HABIT 
An aim of all study is to promote efficiency, and accord- 
ingly my psychological study of myself is largely for the 
purpose of making me more efficient, more ready in my re- 
sponses to the stimulations of my environment. To secure 
this end I must not only make fresh acquisitions but I must 
“hold fast what is given” to me in the game of life and must 
reproduce it as it is needed. My imental endowment is   
      
a Senrhchiee and of my_ instinctive interests and capacities ; ‘i 
and the preservation and recurrence of these experiences is 
called habit. For just as we call recurring bodily reactions 
habitual, so we designate recurring feelings and modes of 
* Cf. pp. 94-95. 
  
ES
-P-A-G-E-116
  94 A First Book in Psychology 
consciousness mental habits. (In the case of the repeated 
sensational experience, the mental habit is called memory.) 
Of course, not merely our instinctive interests and reac- 
tions, but our acquired feelings and activities may recur and 
become habitual; and habits are commonly, therefore, 
classified according as their origin is or is not instinctive. 
Habits, whether mental or physical, contribute to our 
efficiency by economizing our time and our attention. This 
is evident to any one who reflects upon the history of his 
own activities. Suppose for a moment that dressing had 
not become a habit and that I had to force buttons into 
buttonholes and shoe-laces into eyelets with the same 
expenditure of reflection and effort which I once devoted to 
these operations. Or, suppose that the casting up of col- 
umns of figures had not become a habit and that I had to 
face each new grocer’s bill in the way in which I used to 
turn to my problems of addition in arithmetic. It is obvi- 
ous that I accomplish all these operations in a fraction of 
the time they required before they became habitual; and, 
as will later be shown in more detail,* I perform them more 
accurately, as well as more swiftly. The practised hand, 
not the novice however well trained and painstaking, hits 
the bull’s eye, keeps the straight course, recites without 
error. 
The problem of-efficiency is, at this stage, to discover 
means~by- which-.one-may-convert the useful,—transitory 
instincts and the acquired proficiencies into habits. The 
permanent instincts become habitual of themselves, but 
the transitory instincts, as well as the acquirements, will 
lapse without voluntary exercise. The wise teacher will 
* Cf. Chapter XIL, pp. 240 ff.
-P-A-G-E-117
  Instinct, Habit, and Learning 95 
therefore foster and stimulate such transitory instincts as 
should survive in permanent habits, and will limit the out- 
flow of the dangerous instincts. He will, for example, take 
advantage of the age at which the child is instinctively 
social in order to form gracious habits of intercourse by 
which to tide over the shallows of the shy age; and he will 
see to it that the child outgrows the tormenting instinct 
without forming habits of cruelty. 
In his classic chapter on habit, Professor James has em- 
phasized the fixedness of early habits, and has formulated 
certain practical maxims which may well be quoted in con- 
clusion: ‘‘The first is that in the acquisition of a new habit, 
or the leaving off of an old one, we must take care to launch 
ourselves with as strong and decided an initiative as possible. 
The second maxim is: Never suffer an exception to 
occur till the new habit is securely rooted in your life... . 
A third maxim may be added: Seize the very first oppor- 
tunity to act on every resolution you make, and on every 
emotional prompting you may experience in the direction of 
the habits you aspire to gain.” * 
¢. LEARNING 
Not only by repeating, and thus preserving, my original 
experiences, do I gain mental efficiency. I must change, 
supplement, modify, control my experience if I am to live 
fully. and effectively. Such change or modification of 
sense-images and of instincts is called learning, or acquisi- 
tion. : 
Learning may be_either individual or social, and either 
form may, like habit, be mental or physical.. Normally, 
* “Principles of Psychology,” I., pp. 123, 124.
-P-A-G-E-118
  96 A First Book in Psychology 
however, mental and physical learning are combined. The 
education of hand and arm implies a corresponding training 
of reasoning and will; and the codrdination of movements 
accompanies the codrdination of thoughts. The two fun- 
damental forms of mental learning have, as objects, per- 
cepts and _images-on the one hand, instinctive feelings on 
the other. These distinctions may be summarized and 
amplified as follows : 
  
    
  
  Learning 
Individual Social Impulsive. (‘Trial and Error’) (including Imitation) | Voluntary. 
Physical Mental whose objects are 
Images _Instinctive Concepts Emotions 
The acquisition of images and concepts is through creative 
 imagination-and-reasoning, and the control of instincts and 
emotions is, in large part, through volition. Thus, most of 
the succeeding chapters of this book will contribute to the 
discussion of these various kinds of learning. It ‘will, 
however, prove useful to make, at this point, the distinction 
between individual and social learning, and to notice the 
changes brought about in the mental life by the control of 
the instincts. 
1. To begin with the last point: the control of the in- 
stincts should take two forms: the drastic form of inhibit- 
ing, crushing, stamping out the positively harmful instincts, 
such as cruelty and jealousy, and the milder form of trans- 
forming or making-over-instincts-which are harmful only in 
certain applications or relations. Acquisition, for example, 
betomes useful when fused with generosity, and a child 
may be taught to save for the purpose of giving. Or, again,
-P-A-G-E-119
7 ‘ 
  Instinct, Habit, and Learning 97 
an instinct may become of value when a suitable object is 
provided for it; for example, a boy may profitably spend his 
combative fury on a woodpile in the place of a human foe, 
and may wisely hoard minerals, postage-stamps, or quota- 
tions in place of pennies. The methods of control will 
become clearer in later chapters* but we may anticipate by 
pointing out that the modification of an instinct is usually, 
if not always, brought about by the premeditated or else 
involuntary occurrence of a counter-instinct. To the little 
child, for instance, a strange object is naturally both inter- 
esting and terrifying; and it therefore arouses in him the 
opposite instincts of approach and of withdrawal. The 
child may slowly come close to the strange dog or to the new 
motor car, or he may gradually shrink back, or finally one 
instinct may balance another and he may hold his ground, 
neither advancing nor fleeing, but revealing by hesitating 
movement and changing expression the conflict of instincts. 
In quite parallel fashion, the instinctive selfishness of the 
older child may struggle with his instinctive generosity. 
One may watch his vacillation between the egoistic impulse 
to snatch from his playmate the coveted marble and the 
altruistic instinct to give up those which he has himself 
won. 
2. This consideration of the control of the instincts has 
evidently taken for granted the social relation of pupil to 
teacher, or of child to parent. Learning, however, as has 
been stated, sometimes occurs through individual experi- 
ence, and it is important clearly to distinguish the two forms, 
individual and social. Learning through individual—ex-

XIII, pp. 253 ff.
-P-A-G-E-120
98 A First Book in Psychology 
  perience, is clearly to be found among animals. Contem- 
porary psychologists have largely concerned themselves 
with the experimental study of animal learning and have 
abundantly shown that animals learn by accidental suc- 
cesses and failures (‘trial-and-error’), that is, by individual 
experience. Thus, Yerkes has shown by his experiments 
that turtles can learn new reactions: his turtles, while 
crawling to the base of an inclined plane for food, acci- 
dentally fell from its side, and learned to repeat this for- 
tunate method of shortening the path to food.* Evidently 
this perpetuation of an accidental reaction indicates that 
the turtles remembered the fall.and its results. Similar 
experiments on birds, rodents, and the higher vertebrates, 
‘ offer conclusive proof of their ability to obtain food by es- 
caping through novel barriers, and by finding their way 
through strange labyrinths. In parallel fashion, a baby 
may learn to grasp a ball by repeating and adapting his 
accidentally and partially successful movements toward it. 
3. It is evident also, from experiments such as have just 
been described as well as from everyday experience, that 
animals can be trained; in other words, that they learn 
through social means. But it is not so certain that this 
learning involves social consciousness, that is, that animals 
reflectively obey or imitate their teachers. It is, in fact, a 
moot question whether animals acquire new movements or 
new images through imitation. Many experiments, not- 
ably those of Thorndike, have told against the probability of 
animal imitation. Dogs, cats, and monkeys have been shut 
up with other animals which have learned to perform certain 
simple movements, by which to release themselves from 
* Popular Science Monthly, 1901, LVIII., pp. 519 ff.
-P-A-G-E-121
  Instinct, Habit, and Learning 99 
captivity or to obtain food, and yet the newcomers have 
failed to imitate the successful reactions of their companions. 
With still other animals, however, notably with anthropoid 
apes, experiments have indicated the presence of imitative 
reflection; and the unsuccessful cases are perhaps due to 
the difficulty of inducing animals to fix their attention on 
each other. 
The contrast between the human and the animal con- 
sciousness is nowhere more striking than at this point. 
Like an animal, a child may learn through individual trial 
and error, but unquestionably most of his learning is of the 
definitely social type ; and whereas there is, as has appeared, 
a doubt of the animal’s capacity for imitation, most human 
learning, of whatever sort, is definitely social, and much of it 
consists in the imitation of other selves — of their feelings 
and thoughts and of the movements of their bodies. Most 
of our daily acts and experiences are, in truth, imitations of 
those of other people. To be sure, not all resembling ac- 
tivities are imitative, for example, roosters crow not in imi- 
tation of each other, but through a common instinct. But 
when we weed out from the tangle of our repeated acts and 
experiences those which are mere instinctive or else acci- 
dental repetitions, a goodly growth of imitations still re- 
mains. For example, though we sleep, not because others 
do, but because of the conditions of our individual bodies, 
yet we sleep on the ground or on beds, and from eight 
o’clock till five, or from dawn till noon, simply because the 
people who educated us and the people who surround us do 
the same. So we eat, not because others eat, but to satisfy 
individual needs ; yet we eat tallow or rice or terrapin, we eat 
with our fingers or with chop-sticks or with forks, and we eat  
-P-A-G-E-122
A First Book in Psychology 
  from the ground, from mats or from tables, partly because 
people have taught us these ways, and partly because these 
are the manners of those about us. Again, our wanderings 
from place to place are unimitative, instinctive activities, 
but the manner of our travelling, on horseback, by auto- 
mobile, or by aeroplane is, oftener than we think, a caprice 
of fashion. 
The list of our imitative acts is scarcely begun. The root- 
words of a language, except such as are instinctive vocal out- 
cries, are imitations of nature sounds, and language is always 
acquired by imitation. People speak English or Dutch or 
Portuguese not accidentally, — as the child suggested, who 
feared that his baby brother might speak German, in place 
of English, — but through imitation of the people about us. 
Our handwriting is an imitation of our teacher’s, and the 
earliest handwriting was abbreviated from the pictured imi- 
tation of natural objects. We bow to each other instead of 
rubbing noses; we lace on calf boots instead of binding on 
sandals; we read and write short stories instead of three- 
volumed romances; we revel in sociological heroines in 
place of romantic ones; and.we study psychical research and 
no longer burn witches. But all these acts, ideals, and ten- 
dencies are directly due to custom or fashion, that is, to imi- 
tation. We do and think all these things, and scores of 
others, because others act and think in these ways. 
These illustrations suffice to show that imitation, like 
habit and instinct, may be_psychical or physical, ‘imitation 
_of thought or of movement. And imitation, whether psy-   
      
chical or physical, may take the form of fashion, imitation 
of the present, or of tradition, imitation of the past. In 
Paris, for instance, dress is regulated by fashion which
-P-A-G-E-123
  Instinct, Habit, and Learning IOI 
changes with every season, and every woman dresses as her 
neighbor dresses. In Brittany, dress is a tradition and 
every woman’s coif is like her great-grandmother’s. 
Far more important than either of these distinctions is 
that of voluntary or reflective imitation from the undevel- 
oped, or mechanical, imitation, in which the subject does 
not recognize his own act as the repetition of another. So, 
a very young child will be attracted by the rhythmically 
moved finger of a person opposite to him in a street car, 
and will presently attempt, evidently without premedita- 
tion, a similar movement of his own fingers. This is move- 
ment of the impulsive, perceptual type which forms the 
special topic of Part I of this chapter. It is wholly different 
from the reflective, voluntary imitation which will later 
be discussed in more detail.* These distinctions are indi-

The study of imitation suggests a final remark about the 
human body. At the beginning of this chapter, my body 
was described as standing in close relation to myself. An 
equally important character is the following: my hody, 
through its_gestures and motions, serves as means of com- 
munication--with--other-selves... Accordingly, the complete 
notion of the body presupposes the conception of socially

consciousness of bodily reactions as social media, every 
child shows instinctive interest in gesture and expression — 
follows movements with his eyes, listens eagerly to human 
speech.

ATTENTION 
I. THe Nature oF ATTENTION 
Every one knows that there is a distinction between 
attention and inattention.* Our special problem, at this 
stage of our study, is the nature of attentive perception and 
imagination; but even now we realize that attention is a 
factor also of other experiences. We may profitably begin 
our study by an illustration of perceptual attention. Sup- 
pose that I am perched on a rock, on a sunny September 
afternoon, lazily looking off upon a quiet sea, dotted here and 
there with gleaming sails, some near the shore, others on the 
horizon. I am awake and open-eyed, receptively and sensa- 
tionally conscious. In a word, I am perceiving. Now sup- 
pose that a sloop comes into view‘around the rocky headland 
at my left. I am no longer impartially conscious of sea and’ 
of boat; nor do my eyes wander idly from horizon to shore and 
from shore to horizon again. Rather I bend forward and fix 
* Before reading farther, the student should answer, in writing, the follow- 
ing questions: (r) Name two things to which you naturally (without train- 
ing) gave attention. (2) Name two subjects to which you have learned to 
attend. (3) What bodily movements and attitudes characterize your atten- 
tion to a faint sound? (4) What bodily movements and attitudes character- 
ize a dog’s attention to a faint sound? (5) Describe, in full, your attentive 
consciousness (a) of the irregularity in contour of the period at the end of this 
sentence; and (b) of the boundaries of the state of New York (as you now, 
in imagination, bound the state),

  my eyes upon the sloop; or, to use the everyday expres- 
sion, I concentrate my consciousness on the boat and, so 
long as it remains in view, I am not in the same way 
"conscious of anything else. In other words, I attend to 
the boat. And to-morrow, when I am altogether unable 
to tell whether the rocks in the foreground were brown or 
gray and whether the sky was clear or cloudy, I shall re- 
member that the boat was a yawl-rigged sloop with a 
black hull. 
But though it is relatively easy to describe an attentive 
experience, its bodily accompaniments, and its psychic 
effects, it will be found impossible to define that special 
factor of the experience which is known as attention.!* 
Attention is, in truth, a unique attitude, a basal relation 
of self to object, comparable with receptivity or sympathy 
or activity. This conception may, but need not, be com- 
bined with the teaching that there is a structural element 
of clearness, or attended-to-ness.| From either point of 
- view, attention is unique and indescribable, not to be re- 
duced to more elemental constituents. Attention is — 
‘ just attention. 
We best realize what attention means by contrasting it 
with the inattentive consciousness, for example, with the 
drowsy consciousness, or with our normal consciousness 
of objects which stimulate only the outer zones of the 
retina. So-called inattentiveness, however, is usually a 
lower degree, or ‘level,’ of attention; and there is dispute 
among psychologists as regards the number — two or

divisions of the Appendix, Section VI.

three or four — of these ‘ attention-levels.’ It is not un- 
likely that individuals differ in this capacity to attend 
simultaneously, with varying degrees of attention, to dif- 
ferent objects. 
II. Tue Opjects oF ATTENTION 
Since attention is elemental, — and since, therefore, we 
cannot describe attention, even though we know what it is 
— our further study will turn out to be mainly a study not of 
attention itself but of its objects, conditions, and results. We 
may well begin by considering the objects of attention; and 
three important statements must be made about them, 
(a) We may attend, in the first place, to objects of any kind 
—personal or impersonal, public or private, externalized 
or non-externalized, sensational, affective, or relational.* In 
more concrete terms: my attention may be centred on myself 
or on my friend — personal objects, the one private, the other. 
public; again, my attention may be directed to Botticelli’s 
“Pallas,” or to the emotion with which I regard the picture — 
both impersonal objects, the second private and non-external- 
ized, the other public and externalized; I may attend, finally, 
to the binomial theorem or to my lead pencil — both imper- 
sonal and public objects, but the last only externalized. It 
follows that all kinds of consciousness, perception and emo- 
tion, thought and will, may be ‘attentive,’ accompanied by 
attention. Certain forms of consciousness are indeed, as 
will.appear, necessarily and inherently attentive. 
(b) The object of attention may be in the second place, 
though it need not be, a relatively stable object. In inatten- 
tive perception, my eye moves from object to object; in 
inattentive imagination, one image follows on another in a

swift succession. In attentive perception, on the other 
hand, I may be so absorbed in my object that the restless 
flow of consciousness is checked and the world narrows to 
me and my object. 
(c) The object to which I attend is, in the third place, a 
part only, not the whole, of the total object.of my con- 
sciousness at any moment. Thus, to recur to our initial 
example, I cannot attend simultaneously to rock and ocean 
and sloop. On the contrary, while I attend to the bellying, 
flapping canvas I am inattentively conscious of the sea and 
of the rock. Or, to take another example, I attend not to 
the whole side of the room but to the desk; perhaps not to 
the desk but to the polished brass inkstand; or, finally, not 
even to the whole inkstand but to its carved griffin-top. I 
may even attend to a single inseparable element or factor 
of a given object — to the redness of the rose, to the nov- 
elty of my surroundings, to the pleasantness of my emo- 
tional experience, to the causal connection between stimulus 
and movement. 
No exact limits have been so far set by experimental ob- 
servation to the complexity of the object of attention. In 
general, any group of terms which can be unified can be 
attended to. Experimenters, as well as every-day observ- 
ers, have concerned themselves with this problem, and have 
proved abundantly that small objects, too numerous to be 
separately attended to, are attentively perceived if com- 
bined into a pattern or scheme. If, for example, one drop 
a screen for less than one quarter of a second (an interval 
so short that it excludes eye-movements), thus exposing a 
surface on which five or six small crosses have been drawn, 
in irregular order, one will find that attentive observers 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  The Objects of Attention 107 
often fail in telling the number of the crosses, whereas 
they can reproduce the figure made by the crosses. This 
shows that the observers attended not to the single figures 
(the crosses) but to the complex figure, or scheme, com- 
posed of all the crosses.* About half a dozen small 
objects can thus be unified and attended to. Some psy- 
chologists believe that we may attend also to two (or at 
most to three) independent objects; and to the introspec- 
tion of the writer this seems true. One may train oneself, 
for example, to attend simultaneously to a fixated visual 
object and another object seen in indirect vision ; and it is 
“impossible to unify these. Most cases, however, of so-called 
‘divided’ attention are either instances of the simultaneous 
occurrence of attentive consciousness and a merely reflex 
action, — as when one writes a letter while one mechanically 
hums a tune or repeats a series of numerals, — or else in- 
stances of alternating attention. Julius Cesar did not really 
dictate four letters while writing a fifth, but his attention 
vibrated from one to another; and the phenomenal chess- 
players shift their attention from one to another of the 
games which they are said to play ‘simultaneously.’ 
Attention to part of one’s total object of consciousness of 
course implies inattention to the rest. The ‘absent-minded’ 
person, blind and deaf to the sights and sounds of his en- 
vironment, is inattentive to them precisely because he is 
attentive to something else. Attention to a small part of 
an object, especially attention to a single quality or rela- 
tion, is called ‘abstraction.’ One is also said to abstract

  from, the unattended-to part of the total object of con- 
sciousness ; and the momentary experience of abstracting is 
called an ‘abstract idea.’ Examples of abstraction are the 
consciousness of ‘redness,’ of ‘charm,’ and of ‘refusal.’ 
(d) The discovery that one attends to a part only of the 
total object of consciousness at once suggests the question : 
To what part? The answers to this question may, perhaps, 
reduce themselves to three. It is a matter of common ob- 
servation that I attend (z) to the pleasant or unpleasant — 
for example, to the compliment which some one pays’ me 
or to my toothache; and (2) to the novel, or unusual, for 
example, to the figure of a turbaned Hindu in an Oxford au- 
dience which fills the Sheldonian theatre. My attention to 
a sensationally intense object, for example, to a thunder- 
clap, and my attention to a moving object, for example, 
to a flying bird or to a moving signal, are cases of 
attention to the surprising or unusual. Finally (3) I 
attend to that part of my total field of consciousness 
which is connected with other objects of my attention. IfI 
am studying the problem of immigration from Southern Eu- 
rope I notice the most casual newspaper references to Slavs 
and to Italians, and I remember the southern type of this or 
that face ina crowd. If I have hurried the carpenters out 
of the house which they are building for me, by helping to 
fillwith putty the holes left by the nailsin the woodwork, then 
for weeks I mark the variations of color between wood and 
puttyin the wainscotings and furnishings of the houses which 
I visit. No one of these three characters invariably distin- 
guishes the object of attention — one may attend to the dull 
color or the soft sound ; an object closely connected with our 
ordinary interests may be unattended to ; and,finallyonemay 
attend to an object which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant.
-P-A-G-E-131
  The Objects of Attention I09 
There are, indeed, some objects of attention which can 
hardly be described in any of these terms. Of these inex- 
plicably interesting things we can only say that they are 
objects of instinctive attention. But when attention is 
accounted for at all its object is pleasant or unpleasant, or 
else novel, or it is closely associated with an affective or a 
novel object. - 
III. THe C.iasses, CONDITIONS, AND RESULTS OF 
ATTENTION 
A fourfold classification has been suggested by the pre- 
ceding discussion of the nature and the objects of attention. 
(1) Attention may obviously be distinguished, according 
to degree, as strong or weak or, in figurative phrases, as 
‘focal’ or ‘marginal,’ or as ‘high-level’ or ‘low-level.’ * 
(2) In the second place, attention is classified according 
to its ‘range’ or, conversely, according to the complexity 
of its object as either of ‘wide’ or of ‘narrow’ span — in 
Miinsterberg’s terms as ‘expansive’ or ‘concentrated.’ 
Of the former type is the attention of a workman who simul- 
taneously supervises “‘half a dozen large machines,” whereas 
the man whose “industrial activity demands the attentive 
observation of one little lever,” { uses concentrated atten- 
tion. ; 
(3) Attention, in the third place, is either stable (or 
sluggish) with relatively persisting object, or else it is 
unstable (or mobile). The student, the artist, and the man 
obsessed by one idea have attention of the former type. In 
fact, stability, because it is altogether lacking to the in-

attentive consciousness, has usually been emphasized, at 
the expense of mobility, or alertness, in attention. But the 
successful chauffeur is certainly attentive and yet his atten- 
tion shifts constantly ; now he attends to the child who is 
likely to cross the road from the left, next to the carriage 
which he is passing on his right, next to the car ahead 
which is slowing down. Evidently this unstable, or mo- 
bile, attention is likely to be, also, wide-spanned.* It 
should be sharply distinguished from mere fluctuations of 
intensity in sense-consciousness— alternations of bright and 
dull color or of loud and soft sound. 
(4) Attention, finally, is classified according to origin 
as natural (that is, instinctive) or acquired. Attention of 
the first sort is untaught, whereas attention of the second 
sort is acquired through individual experience or through 
imitation. All natural attention is evidently, therefore, in- 
voluntary. Acquired attention is either involuntary or vol- 
untary, that is, willed. To illustrate: five minutes ago I was 
instinctively attentive to the whistle of theincoming steamer ; 
whereas I willed my present acquired attention to this chap- 
ter on attention. If I were attending neither to the whistle 
nor to the scientific discussion, but to a thrilling page of some 
novel, my attention would be acquired, indeed, —for a printed 
page is not naturally interesting, — but involuntary. Natu- 
ral attention is in fact directed to objects which are unusual, 
pleasant, or unpleasant. The objects of acquired attention 
are, directly or indirectly, connected or associated with these. 
We have, thus, the following classification of attention as —

b. The novel. 
. II. Acquired 
Involuntary) to the object associatively connected 
Voluntary } with an object naturally attended to. 
The relation between will and attention, which is sometimes 
denied, will be further discussed in a later chapter.* It is, 
however, immediately clear that acquired attention is of 
great practical significance. If our attention were purely in- 
stinctive, we should go on through life enlarging our primary 
childhood interests — absorbed in the objects, brilliant, 
novel, or pleasant, of our immediate perception. We ac- 
quire new interests through our ability to compel ourselves 
to attend to what is normally uninteresting and unattended to. 
Thus, voluntary attention attests the power of intellectual 
development. As Professor Barrett Wendell says: ‘The 
practical aim of a general education is such training as shall 
enable a man to devote his faculties intently to matters which 
of themselves do not interest him. The power which enables 
a man to do so is obviously the power of voluntary, as dis- 
tinguished from spontaneous, attention.” 
Of the bodily conditions of attention there is little to be 
said. There are evidently no end-organ excitations of at- 
tention. And though we are justified by physiological anal- 
ogy in postulating some special neural condition of attention, 
the physiologists speak in vague and more or less divergent 
terms of the nature of such a neural process., Some sort of 
_ special ‘preparedness of brain-centres’ must be assumed to 
exist. The characteristic muscular contractions which ac-

company attention are more readily described. They are of 
two sorts: in the first place, contractions, usually instinctive, 
of the muscular apparatus of the sense-organs, tending to 
adapt these organs to the conditions of distinct consciousness. 
For example, we instinctively change the convergence or the 
accommodation of our eyes in order to obtain a distincter out- 
line of the object which interests us; we turn our heads tow- 
ard the source of the music to which we are attending; and 
we follow a moving object with our eyes. Muscular contrac- 
tions of this sort are, of course, peculiar to sense-attention. 
A second class of muscular contractions is characteristic of 
all sorts of attention — such contractions, namely, as prevent 
disturbing movements of any sort. The rigidity and stillness 
of the body is, indeed, an obvious accompaniment of attention. 
In the successive sections of this chapter attention has 
been described as a fundamental personal attitude; the 
object of attention has been ‘distinguished as a relatively 
stable part of the total field of consciousness and as sensation- 
ally novel, or affectively toned, or associatively connected; 
attention has been distinguished as instinctive or acquired, 
involuntary or voluntary, and, finally, the bodily correlates 
of attention have been indicated. It remains to speak briefly 
of what may be named the results of attention. First and 
most important is the normal recurrence of the attentive 
consciousness. In concrete terms, we are likely to remember 
what we attend to, and, conversely, we forget what we inat- 
tentively experience.* 
In thesecond place, attention determines the direction of my :

imagining; it forms, in a word) the starting-point of associa- 
tion. The next chapter will lay more stress on the relation 
of attention to association.* Here we need merely name and 
illustrate this connection. Not the whole experience of a 
given moment, but the emphasized, that is, the attentive, part 
of it is likely to form the starting-point of my imagination. 
For example, my outlook on the view from my window is 
probably followed not by the imagining of a closely similar 
landscape, but by the imagination — let us say — of a lighted 
Christmas tree due to my attentive consciousness of the 
evergreen tree near my window. Attention is thus a con- * 
dition alike of association and of retention. The chapters 
which follow will make this more evident. 
A word should be said, in conclusion, of ‘the relation be- 
tween interest and attention. - The term ‘interest’ is best used 
as synonym for involuntary attention. I am interested in the 
objects to which, without effort of will, I attend.

CHAPTER VII Yo 
PRODUCTIVE IMAGINATION, MEMORY, SUCCESSIVE AS- 
SOCIATION 
I. PRODUCTIVE AND REPRODUCTIVE IMAGINATION’ 
Tus chapter is devoted to the study of imagination from a 
new point of view.* Imagination has, up to this point, been 
described as sensational, unified, and ‘private’ consciousness 
of particularized objects, and has been classified according to 
sense-types. We are now to take account of the distinction, 
practically and esthetically significant, between . reproduc- 
tive (or recurring) and productive (or inventive) imagination. 
‘Relatively accurate and complete reproductive imagination is 
called memory. ) 
It must at once be noted that the ‘structural elements’ of 
imagination always are reproduced (that is, repeated) and not 
in any sense ‘novel.’ They are part of our original endow- 
ment, instinctive forms of consciousness, as we may call them. 
I can imagine no brand-new color, and no new taste. The 
novelty involved in so-called creative imagination is therefore 
a novelty of combination, for one complex experience may 
differ from every previous one, though, taken singly, no ele-

ing questions: (1) What seems to you to be the difference between imagining 
and remembering? (2) What method would you use in order to memorize

  Productive and Reproductive Imagination II5 
ment or part of the ‘novel’ experience isnew. Every instance 
of creative imagination illustrates this statement. In imagin- 
ing a centaur, one combines the image of a man’s head with 
that of a horse’s body; in inventing the telegraph, Morse 
prolonged in imagination the image of charged wire, and united 
it with that of vibrating lever and writing point. These are 
instances of the combination of images in themselves far 
from simple. The parts combined may, however, be much 
less complex — mere elements or very simple images. 
The forms of imagination thus provisionally illustrated 
must be more closely considered. Of creative imagination 
two main forms are ordinarily distinguished: the mechanical 
and the organic. The mechanical image is a complex, not of 
qualities, but of relative totals, of experiences complete in 
themselves, as if a painter were to paint a picture of Tuscan 
olive trees on a New England hillside. The organic image 
is a complex of single elements or of fragmentary aspects of 
different objects, which fuse into a new whole of organically 
related parts. Within the class of organic imagination oné 
may distinguish, also, the fanciful from the universal imagi- 
nation, on the ground that the first lays stress on more 
or less bizarre and accidentally interesting characters, the 
second on essential, universally appealing qualities. Thus, 
Kipling’s description of the “Workers” includes a bold 
fancy: — 
“They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comet’s hair.” 
Miss Jewett employs a similar figure, but the wide appeal of it 
marks the more universal imagination : — 
“Madonna mia! if in truth 
Our Raphael from heaven’s palaces

* * * * * 
Even he might find a study, fair 
As his last fresco in the skies, 
Might pause, untouched of mortal taint, 
One infinite half-hour to paint 
The motherhood in your dear eyes.” 
The study of reproductive imagination will involve us in 
more detail. It has already been classified as complete or 
incomplete, accurate or inaccurate. These are relative terms, 
and it is probable, of course, that no case of literally complete 
and accurate reproductive imagination ever occurs. , Practi- 
‘cally complete and accurate imagination is called memory and 
lis, as everybody knows, a significant factor in conduct and an 
indispensable basis for thought. The questions, ‘‘ How do I 
‘remember ?”’ and “‘ How may I foster and, if possible, increase 
my chance of remembering?” assume, therefore, a practical 
importance of high order. The admitted answer to the first 
of these questions is as follows: “I remember through 
/association.” The meaning of this term,we have next to

  on a perception (or another imagination), a sequence which 
is attributed (in after-reflection) to the previous occurrence, 
simultaneously or in swift succession, of the two experiences.** 
* The term ‘association’ is often used in the sense of ‘successive’ associa- 
tion, For the distinction between ‘successive’ and ‘simultaneous’ associa- 
tion, cf. Chapter IV., p. 65, with Note, and Appendix, Section VII. (§ 1).

  The Nature of Association 117 r 
For example, my present memory of a Parisian dinner-table 
—the brightly lighted salle-¢-manger, the long’ table, the 
white-haired hostess — is associated with my present percept 
of a knock on my door, that is, it follows upon the knock and 
is explained by the fact that, night after night, just such a 
muffled tap from the servant who summoned me preceded 
my consciousness of the dinner-table. 
The most important and obvious classes of association may 
best be described by the terms ‘total’ and ‘partial.’ * ‘Total 
association’ is that between complex experiences which are 
complete in themselves. It is an external and prosaic sort of 
connection explained as due to the simultaneous or the suc- 
cessive occurrence of ‘the same’ experiences in the past. 
The association, one after. another, of the imaged notes of a 
melody, words of a poem, or implements of a trade, are ex- 
amples of this common form of association which may be 
readily symbolized by the following diagram: — 
Past percept or with Past percept or

In this diagram, the small letter (y) stands for ‘image’ and 
the capitals stand for ‘either percept or image’; the arrow 
designates the fact and the direction of the association, and the 
line connecting X" and Y" indicates that the two experiences 
* These terms were suggested by James. The expression ‘total’? must 
not, of course, be interpreted as if it required that the entire experience of a 
given moment should be associated with the imagination which follows on it. 
On the other hand, the term ‘total’ covers cases in which the first term of the 
association is very limited in extent, in which, for example, the first term is 
th>. consciousness of a single word.

  occurred either simultaneously or successively; the index 
suggests that X" and Y” are past experiences. 
Partial association is that of structural elements of con- 
sciousness or of groups of elements. Its most extreme 
case, which James aptly calls ‘focalized association,’ is the 
observed connection between one single element and another 
elemental or complex experience. This type of association 
is more varied in form and less obviously attributed to con- 
tinuity in past experience, and must therefore be considered 
in more detail. 
‘First’ of all, let us assure ourselves that the partial asso- 
ciation does indeed involve the assumed identity of its terms 
with past experiences, which were either simultaneous or 
successive. We may select, as an extreme instance, the asso- 
ciation implied in these verses of Shelley: — 
“And the hyacinth, purple and white and blue, 
Which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew 
Of music, so delicate, soft and intense, 
It was felt like an odor within the sense.” 
Now, it is in the highest degree improbable that Shelley 
had so often or so vividly experienced together the fra- 
grance of hyacinths and the sound of bells that the one 
should suggest the other. At first sight, therefore, this seems 
to be a case of association which does not involve an assumed 
identity of the connected terms with past experiences occurring 
together. But on closer scrutiny we discover that the actual 
connection, for Shelley, between imagination of sound and 
perception of fragrance was the consciousness of the bell-shape 
of the flower. None of the other elements of the perception of 
the hyacinths, the consciousness, for example, of their color, 
their height, their texture, has any connection with the imagi-
-P-A-G-E-141
  The Nature of Association 119 
nation of the peal of music. But this connecting link, the 
consciousness of the form of the flowers, is not’associated with 
the imagination of sounding bells ‘as a whole, for it is itself 
one element of this imagination; in fact the only association 
involved is that between (1) the elemental consciousness of 
‘bell-shape,’ common to both the perception of the fragrant 
hyacinth and the imagination of the pealing bell, and (2) the 
remaining elements of the imagination of the bell, the audi- 
tory imagination of pitch, intensity and volume of tone, and 
the visual imagination of the color and form of the bell. 
This will be made clearer through the following diagram : —

Here the Roman numerals, I. and II., represent the total,

bell-image; X is the element common to both (the conscious- 
ness of shape) ; y represents the group of elemental imaginings, 
of pitch, intensity, and the like (m, m, and 0), associated by X 
and forming with it the image of the pealing bell; whereas W 
groups together those elements, the consciousness of color, 
height, and so on (a, b, and c) of the hyacinth-percept, which 
have no part in the association. Comparing this, therefore, 
with the concrete associations, we find that it. has the fol- 
lowing distinguishing characteristics: first and foremost the
-P-A-G-E-142
  120 A First Book in Psychology 
starting-point of the association is very narrow, either a 
single element or — as we shall see — a group of elements, 
but never a concrete total. This first term (X) of the as- 
sociation is, in the second place, a part both of the first 
and of the second of the successive, concrete experiences 
(the hyacinth-percept, I., and the image of the bell, II.) and 
the association is, thus, entirely within the second of these 
experiences, the image of the bell. It follows, also, that only 
this second one (II.) of the concrete totals of consciousness 
need be regarded as identical with any former experience; 
in the present case, for example, Shelley need never before 
have seen a hyacinth, but he must already have seen and 
heard a pealing bell, in order to have the association. Finally, 
it is evident that, in cases of successive association, the first 
of the associated elements or groups of elements (X) neces- 
sarily persists in consciousness, whereas the elements com- 
bined with it in the earlier complex (I.) fade gradually away; 
and that the persisting element is then surrounded by the 
added elements (m, n, 0) of the second concrete (II.). This 
persistence of the earlier experience, though occurring in 
concrete association, is especially characteristic of the ‘par- 
tial’ type. 
The connecting term of a partial association (the X) 
may include more than a single element. We have then an 
instance of what may be named ‘multiple association.’ 
When Wordsworth, for example, says of Milton: — 
"Thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart,” 
the star reminds him of Milton’s soul, not merely by its 
aloofness but by its light. Or, to take a more prosaic 
illustration, if the sight of an Italian salt ship calls up an
-P-A-G-E-143
The Nature of Association 121 
  image of a Roman trireme, the association is not between 
consciousness of salt ship and of Roman trireme as total 
experiences, for I surely have not been conscious of them at 
one time or in immediate succession on each other. But 
neither does this association start from any single feature of 
the perceived ship. Rather, a highly complex combination 
of elements (falling short, however, of a concrete total) — the 
consciousness of dark hull, of masts, and of rigging — is 
common both to the perception and to the imagination; and 
these factors common to both experiences are associated 
with the images, cerebrally excited, of banks of oars and 
Roman figures, which complete the consciousness of the 
trireme. ; 
It has thus been shown that the partial, like the total, 
association is accounted for by the assumed identity of 
associated experiences with earlier experiences; but that 
these recurring experiences, instead of being concrete wholes, 
are either elements or’ groups of elements, which have 
been combined in former perceptions or imaginings — of peal- 
ing bells and of Roman trireme, for example. An association 
should always, therefore, be analytically studied. The ‘im- 
portant point is the determination of its first term, and the 
common error is the supposition that a complex experience 
is invariably to be taken as a whole in tracing the associative 
connection. On the other hand, as we have seen, all sub- 
tler associations are instances of association between more 
or less elemental parts of total experiences. Undoubtedly 
the greater number of associations are of the total sort — 
associations between consciousness of object and of use, 
between the percept of a face and the image of a name, and 
between the terms of verbal and motor series. But the 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  Are A First Book in Psychology 
associations which distinguish the imaginative from the 
prosaic type of mind, which are the essence of all metaphor 
and the very heart of humor, belong, all of them, to the 
‘partial’ type. No opposition is too fixed, no separation 
of time or place too wide, to be bridged by this sort of 
association. 
We have, therefore, the following types of association :? * — 
ASSOCIATION 
I. Total or Concrete Association, of complete experiences (with or with- 
out persistence of the first term). 
II. Partial Association, of persisting elements of consciousness: — 
a. Multiple Association (starting from a large group of elements). 
b. Focalized Association (starting from a single element or from 
a small group of elements). 
Before taking up the more practical question of the definite di- 
rection of association, two theoretical comments must be made. 
It must be pointed out in the first place that one’s experiences 
never recur, in the sense that the percepts or images of one 
moment are actually identical with those ofa preceding mo- 
ment. On the contrary, my present image of Faneuil Hall, of 
my uncle, or of the date of the fall of Khartoum is quite a 
different event from my earlier perception or image of the 
same building, person, or date. Unquestionably, however, 
Tassume a certain ‘recurrence’ of the pastexperience, and this 
assumed identity or recurrence is rightly recognized by the 
psychologist as a character of association. A further dis- 
cussion of the possibility and nature of recurrence would be 
metaphysical. 
A second theoretical remark is the following: evidently 
* The student should not fail to practise himself in the analysis of cases 
of association. For suggestions, cf. Appendix, Section XVI., 31.
-P-A-G-E-145
  The Direction of Association 123 
the study of association involves the distinction, already dis- 
cussed, between (1) my subject-self, the unique and persist- 
ing subject of complex experiences; and (2) these same ex- 
periences regarded as impersonal, though not externalized, 
objects belonging to a special point of time. Such a treat- 
ment proves to be necessary to adequate psychological 
description. It is dangerous only if one forget that the dis- 
tinction of subject-self from its experiences is an abstrac- 
tion — that the experiences never occur except as experienced 
by a self and that a self is not absolutely divorced from, or 
opposed to, but rather inclusive of, these experiences. 
III. Tue Direction or ASsociaTION 
The discussion of association has thus made evident the 
close interweaving of partial contents of our complex total 
experience. It is evident that when one of these partial 
experiences ‘recurs,’ as perception or imagination, some other, 
previously continuous with it, recurs also, as imagination. A 
very vital question concerns the actual direction of association. 
.Given a recurring perception or imagination, it has perhaps 
already occurred a score of times in as many different connec- 
tions. Which, then, of the images that might conceivably 
follow on it will actually be associated? If, for example, the 
sight of a topaz necklace is the starting-point of the associa- 
tion, will it be followed by a vague imagining of Delhi, from 
which it came, by an imagination of the crown jewels in the ~ 
Tower of London, or finally by some mainly verbal image — 
the image, for example, of the words ‘topaz necklace’ or of 
the verses —- i 
“And I would lie so light, so light 
I scarce should be unclasp’d at night.”  
-P-A-G-E-146
124 A First Book in Psychology 
  Obviously, it is of practical importance to learn, if we can, the 
principles according to which one image rather than another 
is associated; for thus we may increase the chance of recalling 
what is useful or pleasant rather than the indifferent or harm- 
ful parts of our earlier experience. / Now experiment confirms 
the every-day observation that experiences are likely to be 
associated in proportion as they are’(1) naturally interesting 
or (2) frequent or (3) recent.*) By naturally interesting ex- 
periences are meant those which involve instinctive attention, 
and it has appeared already that the objects of instinctive 
attention —-so far as they can be characterized — are sensa- 
tionally intense, or novel, or affectively toned. Two sorts of 
frequency, also, should be distinguished. An experience may 
occur frequently in the same connection — for example, a 
bell may ring thirty times a day, always by pressure of the 
same button; or the experience may recur frequently but in 
different connections — for example, pressing a button, turn- 
ing a handle, and working a treadle, each a dozen times a day, 
may ring the same bell. Recent experiences need not be 
further classified. : 
We may readily find examples of associated imaginings of 
these different sorts.* If the sight of the necklace suggests the 
words ‘topaz necklace,’ it is because of the frequent connec- 
tion of visual impression and words; if, on the other hand, it 
reminds me of the verses, this is because I was last night re- 
reading “The Miller’s Daughter”’; if it suggests an imagina- 
tion of Delhi or of the crown jewels, it is because these are 
images inherently interesting through sensational intensity or 
* Similarly, it is true that, of the percepts or images of a given moment, 
the suggestive one — that which forms the starting-point of association — 
will be interesting, recent, or repeated.
-P-A-G-E-147
  The’ Uses and Methods of Memorizing 125 
through emotional thrill. Or, to take another illustration: if 
the sight of a surrey, with yellow awning, reminds me of 
the carriage, in which I drove from landing-dock to hotel, in 
Gibraltar, this is because the Gibraltar experience was very 
vivid — sensationally novel and intense as well as markedly 
pleasant; if the surrey, however, reminds me of the rugged 
Maine farmer who drives it, this is because he yesterday drove 
me to Bar Harbor in it; if, finally, it reminds me of a prosaic 
train-hack, this is because my most frequent drives are to 
and from railway stations.* 
The practical applications of these principles of associa- 
tion will be referred to again in the concluding part of this 
chapter. The discussion of this section may be concluded 
by a brief statement about the probable physiological expla- 
nation of association. In a general way it may be said that 
the physiological condition of association is the excitation of 
intra-cortical fibres connecting different cerebral areas. The 
larger these connected brain-areas, the more nearly total’ 
is the association; and the more continuous the cerebral ex- 
citation, the more persistent is the consciousness. It is also 
natural that connecting fibres which have been frequently or 
recently or strongly excited should offer little resistance to the 
excitation; and in this probability we have the suggestion of 
a physiological basis for the secondary laws of associative 
frequency, recency, and interest. 
IV. THe Uses AND METHODS OF MEMORIZING 
The functions of imagination are by this time evident. By 
reproductive imagination, or memory, I hold to my pasts and

  in creative imagination I reach out also beyond the limits of 
past and present. As a merely perceiving self I am bound to 
this desk, this loom, this plot of ground; but as a remember- 
ing self I live through, once more, the exhilarating adventures 
and the beautiful scenes of my past experience, and as a 
creatively imagining self I am hampered neither by ‘now’ 
nor by ‘then.’ I go beyond my own actual experience, I 
see visions, I dream dreams, I create new forms. In Steven- 
son’s words :— 
“When at home alone I sit 
And am very tired of it, 
I have just to shut my eyes 
To go sailing through the skies.” 
Evidently, therefore, we shall wisely seek to foster both mem- 
ory and creative imagining. But it is plain at once that one 
cannot directly will novelty or spontaneity or independence in 
imagining; and that one may as well try to harness Pegasus 
as to frame rules for the fancy. dn other words, the cultiva- 
tion of imagination is limited to.the cultivation of memory — 
the effort to reproduce accurately and vividly. ) Indirectly, in- 
deed, this cultivation of the memory lays the foundation, as it 
were, for creative imagination and baat In other words, 
memory is not a mere end in itself, and we memorize not only 
in order to re-live our past experiences, but in order to become 
capable of new ones. "ror all creative imagining, as has ap- 
peared, consists in the novel combination of the reproduced 
images of color, sounds, and movements, or of words. The 
creative suggestion, the flight of fancy, follows only on the vivid 
and faithful reproduction of the actual experience; and imagi- 
nation, lacking this accuracy and fidelity, is insignificant and ~ 
ineffective. Thus, the “truly imaginative poet-is endowed
-P-A-G-E-149
  The Uses and Methods of Memorizing 127 
with what Lewes called ‘vision,’ and his work is distinguished 
by “great accuracy in depicting things . . . so that we may 
be certain the things presented themselves in the field of 
the poet’s vision and were painted because seen.” * 
Not only creative imagination but all forms of thought are 
based on memory. Thus, I could not generalize without 
memory — for example, I could not be conscious of chairs as a 
class, if I could not remember different sorts of chairs which 
I have seen; and I could not reason — for example, I could 
not reason out the solution of an algebraic problem — if I 
could not remember the values, once learned, of the different 
terms. , Now analytic reasoning and creative imagination are 
the two psychological forms of learning, that is, acquisition of 
new experience; and it is therefore true that memory (though 
in itself a preservation of old experiences) is essential to 
learning.) Even physiological learning, the acquirement of 
new bodily dexterities, is dependent on memory; for the old in- 
stinctive reactions would be repeated again and again — the 
fish would always snap the hook and the child would invari- 
ably touch the flame — but for memories of the painful results 
of such activities. 
Obviously, therefore, it is well worth our while to concern 
ourselves with methods of memorizing; for, despite great 
individual differences in the ability to memorize,(experimental 
investigation has failed to disclose any one utterly incapable 
of improving his memory. ) On the contrary, unexpected 
capacity for improvement has been brought to light. In a 
long series of experiments carried on in the Wellesley College

laboratory,* one subject was trained to reproduce correctly 
series of eighty-one colors or odors or nonsense syllables; 
another learned to reproduce series of sixty-one terms; 
and no subject failed to show some improvement through 
practice. ’ 
Methods of memerizing have been formulated en the basis 
of*the principles of attention and of association.‘ ) These 
methods vary somewhat according as one seeks to Memorize 
one fact or many, and according as one wishes to memorize 
facts as ordered or facts irrespective of order. Certain con- 
clusions, however — one may perhaps call them rules for 
memorizing — emerge clearly from the experimental study of 
methods.t The first of these has already been stated: One 
should attend to that which one wishes to remember. 'To pro- 
mote memory one must, therefore, observe with attention; to 
secure the recurrence of an experience, one must concentrate | 
oneself upon it. A classic’ illustration of the dependence of | 
memoty on attentive apprehension occurs in Wordsworth’s 
“Daffedils” : — 
  “T gazed — and gazed — but little thought 
What wealth the show to me had brought, 
For oft, when on my couch I lie 
In vacant or in pensive mood, 
They flash'upon that inward eye 
Which ‘is the bliss of solitude.”

the conclusions of this book.

The Uses and Methods of Memorizing 129 
The second rule for memorizing is designed to meet a 
difficulty inattentive apprehension due to the multiplicity of 
objects which it is desired to attend to, and thus to remember. 
Altention, it is evident, should be directed to those parts of a 
complex or of a series which are normally most often forgotten. 
So far as series are concerned, ordinary observation and ex- 
periment alike disclose the fact that the middle part of a series 
is most likely to be forgotten — a fact readily understood when 
one remembers that the first of a series has a certain interest, 
and that the last of a series possesses the advantage of recency 
in experience. It is exdently, then, expedient to direct one’s 
attention toward the middle of the series — experimental indi- 
cations point to the part just beyond the middle. Thus, 
if one is trying to visualize a series of the colors green, gray, — 
brown, pink, blue, white, red, black, mauve, the attention 
should be directed not to green and gray, nor to black and 
mauve, but to blue and white. 
Another method for attending to a group of facts is recog- 
nized by the third rule for memorizing: single facts to be 
remembered should be grouped or unified. Words, for example, 
are most readily remembered as linked in sentences or in 
stanzas; and the streets in a city or rooms in a building are 
best recalled as related parts of a map or plan. Even mean- 
ingless material, if one is trying to remember it, should be 
grouped — nonsense syllables, for example, in rhythmical 
measures, or colored papers in blocks of three or four. In- 
deed, every-day observation shows that’ facts of any sort are 
best remembered when grouped. Thus, I learn the date, 
1690, of the publication of Locke’s “Essay” by connecting 
"it with the date, 1688, of the coming of William and Mary and 
with the fact that Locke returned from his exile in Holland on 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    130° A First Book in Psychology 
the ship which bore the Princess of Orange; and I connect 
the invention of printing and the discovery of America with 
the late fifteenth century by regarding both as manifestations 
of the renaissant spirit of adventure. 
The fourth rule for memorizing follows from a principle 
of association: that an experience occurring frequently in 
different connections is the more likely to recur. If the 
professor of economics and the professor of German and ‘the 
professor of ethics alike quote Nietzsche in their lectures, I am 
likely to be reminded of Nietzsche more often than if he were 
favored by one only of my teachers. It follows that one 
should emphasize existing connections and form new connec- 
tions of the fact-to-be-remembered with other facts likely to 
recur and to suggest it. ‘This rule, though important, needs to 
be guarded. For, first, the greater the variety of facts in- 
directly or directly connected, the greater the likelihood that, 
in a given situation, an undesired image — or no image — will 
recur. If the nonsense syllable mej appears in the fifth place 
of a series which I am trying to learn, the fact that it has held 
second place in yesterday’s series and eighth place in a last 
week’s series makes it likely that, on trying to repeat to-day’s 
list, I assign mej to second or eighth, not to fifth, place, or that 
I am altogether doubtful of its position. The formation, in 
the second place, of artificial connections is commonly of very 
questionable value, for such connections lack the very condi- 
tions of associative recurrence. It is futile, for example, 
to transfer one’s ring to the middle finger for the sake of re- 
minding oneself to wind the clock. Clock-winding and ring- 
on-third-finger are not normally connected in my experience, 
but occur together seldom, and there is therefore little likeli- 
hood that the sight of the ring, a-few hours hence, will recall
-P-A-G-E-153
  
The Uses and Methods of Memorizing 131 
precisely the image of clock-winding. Indeed, the artifi- 
cial auxiliary image, expressly formed to suggest some other 
image, has a pertinacious way of absorbing attention and thus 
of preventing the association desired.. If I try to remember 
Mr. Saltmarsh’s name by ‘connecting’ it with the term ‘Fresh- 
meadow,’ I am more than likely to strain our relations by 
- calling Mr. Saltmarsh ‘Freshmeadow’ when next I meet him. 
A final rule for memory has already been implied: one 
should repeat the fact, or the series, or the group of facts to be 
remembered. ‘This rule is based on the principle underlying 
association that the frequently occurring experience is likely , 
to be suggested, or remembered; and that it\is also, by virtue 
of mere repetition, likely to be suggestive. However common- 
place or naturally uninteresting the scene or the paragraph, 
let it often enough be repeated in one’s experience and one is 
bound to remember it — perhaps to the exclusion of the vivider 
- landscape or stanza. This is a truth of very great pedagogical 
importance. We know that naturally interesting and recent 
and frequent experiences are likely to recur. But the inter- 
est — that is, roughly speaking, the pleasantness or unpleas- 
antness, or unysualness — of an experience is, for the most 
part, beyond our direct control. We cannot at will make our 
experiences vivid in order to remember them, nor dull their 
poignancy in order to forget them. And though we are often 
able to secure the recency of our experience — to refresh our 
memories and to ‘cram’ overnight for examinations — yet this 
sort of memory is notoriously evanescent. In repetition, on 
the other hand, we have a memory-method which is, in great 
degree, directly subject to our control and variation and which 
is also significant and relatively permanent in effect. With a 
sufficient number of repetitions one may remember, for a while
-P-A-G-E-154
  ? 
  132 A First Book in Psychology 
at least, almost anything; one may supplement associations 
which have been formed through impressive or through recent 
experiences; and one may even supplant harmful associa- 
tions already formed.. A child who often enough repeats, 
from the safe vantage-ground of his father’s arms, the experi- 
ence of stroking Jack, the dog, will in the end exorcise from 
his mind the memory of Jack’s overrough welcome; and any- 
body may correct the most ingrained misspellings who will 
often enough copy the misspelled word in its proper form. 
Ordinary observation, supported by a certain amount of 
experimental study, suggests that this voluntary repetition of 
facts to be remembered is more trustworthy when slow than 
when fast. It is true that swift learning, when successful at 
all, is more effective than slow learning, in proportion to 
the time spent on it; but many series and groups of facts are 
too large to be learned at all after this fashion, and facts 
quickly learned — for example, Shakespearian lines and 
chronological tables ‘crammed’ for examination — seem to be 
forgotten far more quickly than facts more slowly acquired. 
Doubtless the great advantage of slow learning is that it 
facilitates what Miss Gamble calls ‘good technique’ in memo- 
rizing; and by this is meant, wisely distributed attention, 
artificial grouping, and emphasis upon the connection be- 
tween terms in a series. 
Experimental investigation has concerned itself especially 
with repetition as a factor in memorizing series and has sup- 
plied two corollaries to the theorem that repetition strengthens 
memory. These are: first, that repetition has a diminishing 
effect: that I learn more in the first few repetitions than in 
many later ones; second, that repetitions are more effective 
if distributed than if massed — that it is better, for example,
-P-A-G-E-155

The Uses and Methods of Memorizing 133 
to repeat a stanza three times every hour for four consecutive 
hours than to repeat it twelve times on a stretch. 
We conclude then that, for each one of us, there is good hope 
of cultivating the memory. ( By discriminating attention, by 
careful grouping of the diverse, one may wisely apprehend 
one’s material; and by patient repetition one may increase 
the likelihood of its PEELE ey Even the man with the 
wretched verbal memory should not give over hope of im- 
proving it; for an exact verbal memory is a priceless posses- 
sion. A word may summarize, as no other can, a mass of 
details or may express a meaning which no other can carry. 
And a beautiful word-sequence on the lips or on the pen of a 
master of style has an irreplaceable music and charm.

  CHAPTER VIII 
RECOGNITION 
I. RECOGNITION AS PERSONAL ATTITUDE 
THE word ‘memory’ is commonly used with two distinct 
meanings. “I remember” Goethe’s ‘Erlkénig” when I can 
correctly repeat it; but “I remember” the teacher who set 
me to learning the poem when I recognize her, twenty years 
later, an unexpected figure in the Potsdamer Bahnhof. 
These two experiences, though very often combined, are 
utterly different and are therefore wisely distinguished by 
different names. In this book, accordingly, the word ‘rec- 
ognition’ is used to indicate the consciousness of an object 
as identical with an object of my earlier experience, whereas 
‘memory’ is used of accurate reproductive imagination, the 
repetition of former consciousness. Memory, in this sense, is 
very often supplemented by recognition, yet is possible with- 
out it. For example, I am remembering if I “see with my 
mind’s eye” a vision of the Dent du Midi, even though I do 
not at the moment realize that this imagined mountain is 
called “Dent du Midi,” or that I have ever before seen it. 
But I am recognizing when I say to myself, “I saw this moun- 
tain on a July day from the Montreux terrace,” or even if I 
reflect, “I have seen this mountain. before, though I don’t 
know where or when.” Recognition may accompany per- 
ception, and indeed every sort of experience as well as memory. 
The example just given is of recognition with memory; but 
134
-P-A-G-E-157
  Recognition as Personal Attitude 135 
when in the summer of rgor I actually saw the Dent du 
Midi, for the second time, I recognized it as the same moun- 
tain which I had first seen ten years before — and this was 
recognition with perception. Recognition is distinguished, 
also, as more or less complete. When I recognize a figure in a 
Paris crowd as one I have seen before, but try in vain to recall 
name or home or other association, this is very incomplete 
recognition. The recognition is relatively complete if, on the 
other hand, I recognize the figure as that, for example, of Pro- 
fessor Harold Héffding;/ if I recall that I first met him in the 
World’s Fair Building at St. Louis in 1904; that he has 
written a book on psychology, a history of philosophy, and a 
philosophy of religion; that he has a son who is much con- 
cerned in problems of Danish education, and so on. 
It is evident that there are indefinitely many grades of com- 
pleteness of recognition, and it must now be shown that this 
completeness consists in the supplementation of recognition 
by associated imagination. Totally incomplete recognition, 
which occurs seldom (according to some psychologists, never), 
is that in which one perceives or imagines an object without 
any associated imagination of former place or circumstance. 
The recognition is nearly incomplete if there occur only a 
single supplementary imagination — for example, if the recogni- 
tion of a face suggests one image only, that of a steamer-deck ; 
it grows fuller if there follow more images — for instance, if the 
steamer-deck image is succeeded by the verbal image, “ Devon- 
ian, 1902”; it is more nearly complete when there follow — 
probably after a pause and in a rush — still other images, verbal 
or concrete, for instance, the images of “Colonel Blake, Civil 
.War veteran, travelling with a pretty young wife.” 
Supplementing imagination plays so important.a part: in
-P-A-G-E-158
y 
136 A First Book in Psychology 
  useful recognizing that some. psychologists have described 
recognition as any experience supplemented by imagination. 
This account of recognition is, however, discredited by cer- 
tain experimental studies. These show at least three types 
of recognition which would be impossible if the recognition 
consisted in supplementing imagination pure and simple. 
There are, first, cases in which imagination follows on the 
consciousness of an unrecognized object, as when I call an 
unfamiliar object by a totally incorrect name. Obviously, 
recognition cannot consist in the image of a word which does 
not have any connection with the object recognized. Cases 
occur, in the second place, in which the recognition precedes 
the supplementary imagination by a marked interval — in 
which, for example, an odor is recalled as familiar long be- 
fore the imagination of name or of circumstance. Here, the 
recognition precedes the supplementary imagination and can- 
not, therefore, be identical with it. There are finally a few 
cases on record — too few, however, to be, in themselves, 
decisive — in which an object has been recognized without 
the occurrence of any supplemental imagining.’ * ; 
Up to this point, recognition has been described and illus- 
trated in a more or less untechnical way. We must now 
discover and formulate its essential characters; and first of 
these is the emphasized persistence of the self in recognition. 
When I recognize, I regard my present self as experiencing 
in the present what I, this same self, experienced in 
the past. John Stuart Mill dwells on this character of rec-_ 
ognition in a well-known passage about memory (by which, 
as will appear, he means what we are calling recognition). 
* Tuese Arabic numerals, throughout this chapter, refer to numbered 
paragraphs of Appendix, Section VIII.
-P-A-G-E-159
  
  Recognition as Relational Consciousness 137 
“What is memory?” he asks.* “It is not merely having the 
idea of [a] fact recalled. It is having the idea recalled along 
with the belief that the fact, which it is idea of, really happened 
... and... to myself. Memory implies an Ego who,for- 
merly experienced the facts remembered, and who was the 
same Ego then as now.” ‘The consciousness of myself as 
‘same’ through changing experience is thus an integral part 
of recognition. 
We may next ask: Of what besides my persisting self am I i 
conscious in recognition? in other words, what is the object of 
my recognition? Apparently it may be of any type. I may 
recognize a person; an external thing or scene; an impersonal 
rule or law; or, finally, my own experience as such. More 
carefully scrutinized, the object of recognition is person, 
thing, or impersonal fact regarded as identical with the same 
object experienced in my past. The object of recognition, 
in a word, is an object related to myself. é 
The structural analysis of recognition will form the final 
stage of this description. From perception and imagination, 
in which (it will be remembered) we distinguish elements 
mainly sensational, recognition is distinguished by the prom- 
inence of elements of a totally different sort, relational 
elements, as they have been called. The nature of these 
_telational elements has next to be considered. 
II. RECOGNITION AS RELATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS 
RELATIONAL ELEMENTS ? 
Some psychologists claim that our structurally elemental 
experiences are exclusively sensational; and still others « 
* Note 33 to Vol. II., Chapter XIV., Section 7, of James Mill’s “ Analysis 
of the Phenomena of the Human Mind.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
    138 A First Book in’ Psychology 
hold that there are but two classes of elements: sensational 
elements, the color-qualities, taste-qualities, and the like, 
and affective elements, the feelings of pleasantness and of 
unpleasantness.* The element of attention, or clearness, is 
sometimes named in addition to these.t But many contem- 
porary psychologists, including the writer of this book, are 
convinced that all these analyses are inadequate; that we 
have certain experiences which are not completely analyzed, 
even structurally, when the sensational and the affective ele- 
ments and the attention, which form part of them, have been 
enumerated; that there are, in other words, elements of 
consciousness other than the sensational and affective ele- 
ments and attention. ‘These neglected elements of conscious- 
ness have been named relational, and it is not difficult to dis- 
cover experiences into which they enter as significant part. 
When, for example, I try to match one green with another, my 
consciousness of greenness, of colorless light, of brightness, 
and of extensity are not the only elements of my conscious- 
ness. On the contrary, the consciousness of the likeness or 
difference of the given green as compared with the standard 
is the very essence of the experience. Again, when. I think 
of a vibrating string as cause of a sound, the consciousness of 
causal relation is as distinct a feature of my experience as the 
sensational consciousness of pitch or of loudness. 
But, easy as it is to point out experiences characterized by 
relational elements, the attempt to enumerate them discloses 
extraordinary obstacles. They have no special physical 
stimuli, and they are physiologically conditioned not by any 
end-organ excitation but by brain-change only — either by

  Recognition as Relational. Consciousness 139 
the excitation of the so-called association centres, or by the 
excitation of transverse fibres, or in both ways.* On account 
of this lack of distinctive physical stimuli, the relational ele- 
ments cannot easily be isolated and varied by experimental 
devices, since experiment must be applied to pltysical stimuli 
and not directly to consciousness itself.t In our study of these 
relational elements we are in great part, therefore, thrown 
back upon individual introspection — notoriously untrust- 
worthy and at this point especially difficult. We are thus 
liable to mistake a relatively simple yet analyzable experi- 
ence for one which is really elemental. For all these rea- 
sons it is unwise to attempt a full classification of relationa! 
elements. The following enumeration is incomplete, and in- 
deed merely tentative. Of the experiences which it names, 
some, doubtless, are not wholly unanalyzable; but all are 
irreducible to mcrely sensational and affective elements: The 
experiences of ‘one’ and of ‘many’ are peculiarly constant 
elements of this class, that is, they seem to lie at the base of 
most relational experiences; and what James calls the ‘feel- 
ings’ * of ‘and,’ and of ‘but’ — that is, the consciousness of 
connection and of opposition — and the experiences of ‘like’ 
and of ‘different,’ of ‘more’ and of ‘less,’ are certainly rela- 
tional experiences and are probably also elemental. 
‘Few wide-awake adult experiences are destitute of these 
relational elements. Perception and imagination, for example, 
though predominantly sensational, are characterized, as we 
have seen, by a consciousness of unification (or together-ness) 
and of separateness.t{ And whenever, as in the experience

mental relational consciousness believe that recognition may 
be adequately described without recourse to it. When, for 
example, I recognize a certain picture in the Hague gallery, 
my consciousness includes, they hold, merely (1) the vi: 
elements involved in my consciousness of the rich brown tints, 
the high lights, and the contour of the face; (2) the verbal 
imagination of thenames of picture and of painter — “ Homer,” 
by Rembrandt; (3) the organic sensations due to my re- 
laxed attitude as I come upon a well-remembered picture 
among many unfamiliar ones; and (4) a feeling of pleasure. 
But though all these are truly elements in my consciousness of 
the picture, by themselves they would not constitute recogni- 
tion. ‘ For, in the first place, these elements are forms of 
self-relatedness, whereas the persistence as well as the re- 
latedness of the recognizing self must be emphasized ; and in 
the second place this enumeration of structural elements is 
palpably incomplete. For in recognizing a picture I do 
not merely see it but I identify it with a picture previously 
seen, that is, I realize the sameness of my present with my 
past experience of it. Now ‘identifying’ or ‘the conscious- 
ness of sameness’ is an obviously relational element of 
consciousness. And the temporal consciousness also of the 
‘past’ is by no means a purely sensational, nor a sensational 
and affective, experience. In an earlier chapter it has been 
briefly suggested that the time-consciousness contains a 
unique factor and that, structurally analyzed, it probably 
includes an unsensational and distinctive element.* The

experiences of past, of present, and of future are evidently, 
however, very complex and must include much besides such 
a time-element. Thus, a consciousness (partly affective) 
of irrevocableness seems to distinguish the consciousness of 
past from that of present and future. No serious attempt 
is made in this book to settle these difficult problems, but 
so much is certain: the consciousness of time is an aware- 
ness of moments, past, present, and future as linked to- 
gether, and it therefore includes certain relational elements 
of connectedness. , 
The study of volition will involve a consideration of another 
sort of relational consciousness of time, that is, the conscious- 
ness of the future.* But the chapter immediately following on | - 
this will discuss, instead, those impersonal forms of relational 
consciousness which are called thought. The results of the 
present chapter may be recapitulated in the statement that 
the recognizing self is (1) relationally ‘conscious of (2) itself 
as persistent and of objects as related to its past. ‘ Comparing 
recognition with perception and imagination we find, there- 
fore, that it differs mainly in two respects from both. It is, 
first, an explicit and emphasized consciousness of myself, and, 
in particular, of myself as persistent.. Every experience, it is 
true, includes this consciousness of persisting self, but in 
perception and in imagination the awareness of self is 
unemphasized and unattended-to, whereas, in recognition, 
it is the centre and core of the consciousness. (Recognition 
is, in the second place, an experience in which not sensational 
but relational elements are predominant. 
A word should be said of paramnesia, so-called ‘false

memory,’ which is better named false recognition. It has 
two forms, perceptual and imaginative recognizing. An exam- 
ple of the first is the ‘been-here-before’ feeling which some- 
times overwhelms us when we enter strange places and new 
scenes. Rossetti has vividly described this experience: — 
“T have been here before, 
But when or how I cannot tell: 
I know the grass beyond the door, 
The sweet, keen smell.” 
In the second type of paramnesia one “recognizes,” as be- 
longing to one’s past, imaginations which correspond with 
no past occurrence. Many of our dream imaginations 
and many experiences of the mentally deranged are of this 
type; but even commoner illustrations of it are the inaccurate 
testimony and the fictitious ‘recollections’ of perfectly honest 
people. Nicolay and Hay, the biographers of Lincoln, are 
quoted as saying, from their experience in editing recollec- 
tions, that “mere memory, unassisted by documentary evi- 
dence, is utterly unreliable after a‘ lapse of fifteen’ years.”

  _ CHAPTER IX 
THOUGHT: CONCEPTION 
Tue words ‘thought’ and ‘thinking’ are often on our lips 
and are used with many shades of meaning. _ To begin with: 
‘thought’ is often identified with ‘consciousness,’ and is thus 
contrasted with ‘matter’ or ‘extension.’ This is the meaning 
which Descartes gives to the word in his famous proposition : 
“Cogito ergo sum.” Again, ‘thinking’ is often used to de- 
scribe all non-perceiving consciousness: “What are you 
doing in the dark?” some one asks me; “ Just thinking,” I 
may answer — and ‘thinking’ here means imagining, indulg- 
ing in revery. The psychologist, however, is wont to use the 
terms in stricter and narrower fashion and to mean by ‘think- 
ing’ not consciousnéss in general, but a form of consciousness 
to be distinguished as well from imagination ‘as from percep- 
tion — namely, the consciousness of objects as related to each 
other. The thinking self is the self (x) relationally conscious 
(2) of related.objects_which (3) it knows, reflectively if not : 
immediately, as objects, _ eee) of other selves. By its 
thinking, therefore, it organizes and_unifies. the objects of 
common experience. We shall begin by seeking illustra-    
tions of the difference between perception and imagination, 
on the one hand, and thought, on the other. I see or im- 
agine a strawberry and a tomato; a scaly lobster; an elec- 
tric drum which revolves after I touch a button. But I 
think about the likeness of strawberry to tomato; of the 
143
-P-A-G-E-166
    144 A First Book in Psychology 
class of crustacea; and of the causal connection between 
electric contact and moving drum. Un my thinking I 
am, in other words, attentively conscious, not of color, — 
sound, or fragrance, nor of happiness or unhappiness, but 
of likeness, of causal relation, or of logical grouping. 
The related objects of thought may be of.any_sort, personal 
or impersonal, external or non-external, public or private. 
I may, for example, compare (and thus think about) selves, 
about things, about formule, even about my own experiences. 
I think about these objects, however, as related, and as re- 
lated not to me but to each other. Otherwise stated, the 
elation is impersonal, even when the related objects are per- 
sonal. Herein thought-objects are sharply distinguished from 
recognized. (or familiar) objects, from the objects of my 
love, my hate, and my other emotions, and from the 
objects of my will. Of all these objects I am directly aware 
as related to myself; whereas, in thinking, I am only 
vaguely conscious of myself but attentively conscious of 
the objects, as related. 
We have next to notice that thinking is not, like imagination, 
a ‘private’ experience. As in the case of perception I am 
conscious, either immediately (during my thinking) or reflect- 
ively (as I look back on my thinking), that I am sharing the 
experience of other thinking selves.t* Otherwise stated: 
thought-relations are public, universal; not peculiarly my 
own. There is something private and particular about my 
reveries and my day-dreams, but my thoughts are never 
regarded as personal property. My castles in Spain are 
private dwellings, but the great halls of thought swing wide to

every comer. This is most readily illustrated from the more 
abstract sorts of thinking, and the most striking of all examples 
are from logic and mathematical science. No man appro- 
priates the multiplication table orthe axiom that things equal 
to the same thing are equal to each other, or the theorem that 
the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles, as 
an experience peculiar to himself. 
i The character of thought which has still to be emphasized 
“is revealed by a structural analysis. My consciousness of 
objects as related is distinguished by elemental experiences of 
a special sort—relational experiences, or feelings, as the pre- 
ceding chapter has designated them. These feelings of like- 
ness and of difference, of totality, of opposition, are experiences 
as distinct as the sensations of blue, of noise, of saltness, and 
the affective feeling of pleasantness. ) There are no physical 
stimuli, and no well-established or finely differentiated neural 
phenomena with which we may coérdinate them; but they are 
all, none the less, distinct experiences, and not to be resolved 
into sensational and affective elements. There are as many 
kinds of thinking as there are impersonal relational ex- 
periences, and these forms of thinking are most readily 
grouped according as their objects are temporally or non- 
temporally related. Causal thinking, involving a reference 
to temporal order, belongs to the first class; comparison, 
the consciousness of objects as like or different or equal, 
is a form of non-temporal thinking, for 2 x 2 is 4, and 
white is other than black, not now or to-morrow, but with- 
out any reference to time: To discuss in detail all the 
forms of thought would carry us beyond our limits. We 
shall, therefore, consider only three: conception, judgment, 
and reasoning.

I. CONCEPTION 
a. The Nature of Conception? 
Conception is the relational consciousness (reflectively at- 
tributed to other selves also) of a group or of an object as 
member of a group. Conception is, indeed, distinguished 
from all other kinds of consciousness by its generalized object. 
I perceive or imagine, for example, my own striped pussy or the 
pumpkin on the kitchen table, but I conceive the class ‘cats,’ 
or ‘any pumpkin.’ Conceptions of both sorts are the terms, 
as will appear, of general judgments expressed in such prop- 
ositions as “cats eat mice,” or “‘ pumpkin is for making pies.” 
The relational experiences especially distinctive of concep- 
tion are the experiences of generality. These are two (corre- 
sponding with the two sorts of object of conception): the 
consciousness of class, and the consciousness of ‘anyness,’ that . 
is, of membership in a class. Thus, my consciousness of the 
pumpkin includes not only (x) the sensational consciousness, 
probably indistinct and shifting, of the yellowness, smoothness, 
“and roundness of the pumpkin and (2) the vague relational 
consciousness of oneness and of distinctness — for if this were 
all, conception would not be structurally different from per- 
ception and imagination — but also (3) one of the two rela- 
tional experiences of generality, the consciousness. of class 
or the consciousness of ‘any.’ Neither of these is a strictly 
elemental consciousness. The first is the consciousness of 
the oneness of many similars, and therefore involves at least 
three elemental experiences. The second is the consciousness 
of similarity to the many forming a group, and is consequently. 
even more complex. But somewhat as the sensational con- 
sciousness of quality, the consciousness of intensity, and that
-P-A-G-E-169
The Nature of Conception 147 
  of extensity fuse in a sensation, so the relational elements 
fuse in a consciousness of generality. 
Though there is no accepted classification of conception, 
it may best be distinguished as sensational, relational, emo- 
tional, or volitional according as the consciousness of gener- 
ality fuses with (z) a sensational experience (imagination 
or perception), (2) relational consciousness, or thought, 
(3) emotion, or (4) an active experience of will or of loyalty. 
Examples of (1) are the concept ‘any cat’; of (2) the con- 
cepts of ‘causality’ and ‘connection’; of (3) the concept 
‘hatred’; and of (4) the concept ‘self-sacrifice.’ 
Traditional psychology has recognized only sensational 
concepts (though it has not called them by this name) 
and has commonly stressed the distinction between verbal 
and concrete — that is, non-verbal — sensational concepts. 
In truth, verbal conception normally occurs in abstract 
thinking, and such concepts as ‘justice,’ ‘power,’ and ‘muta- 
tion’ may possibly consist mainly of verbal imagination 
augmented by a consciousness of generality. Yet the 
réle of the purely verbal conception has been overempha- 
sized. When, for example, in studying logic or theoretical 
natural science, I conceive series, function, or causality, my 
consciousness is best described as a relational experience 
accompanied by the consciousness (also relational) of 
generality; and when I think of fear, the consciousness of 
generality accompanies a genuine, though certainly faint, 
experience of that emotion. In each of these cases I prob- 
ably have also the consciousness of the word — ‘series’ or 
‘fear’ — but this verbal consciousness is not the distinctive 
feature of the experience with which the characteristic 
conceptual factor (the feeling of generality) is fused.
-P-A-G-E-170
  t Cie ‘ 
148 A First Book in Psychology 
Concrete sensational conception is in great part of the 
motor type. It is the consciousness of a class (or member 
of a class) whose common character consists in this, that 
each one of the class calls forth a similar reaction. The 
generalized feature of my ‘hat,’ for example, is not the 
material, or color, or form, because no one of these is com- 
mon to the innumerable, widely different objects known 
as hats. Between the minister’s silk hat and his wife’s 
picture-hat with the ostrich feather there is, in fact, little 
in common except the characteristic motor reaction called 
forth by each. The hat is thus the ‘to-be-put-on-the-head,’ 
and this imagination of bodily reaction is probably the 
part of my consciousness of ‘hat’ which is accompanied by 
the experience of generality and followed by a series of 
images, — of mortar-board, cardinal’s hat, and peasant’s 
cap, — very different objects, similar in this one respect, 
that they are things to be put on the head. In the same 
way, foods differ in every conceivable particular of color, 
form, and consistency, but agree in calling forth a 
common system of bodily movements, the pen is the 
‘to-be-written-with,’ the flower is the ‘to-be-smelled’ 
or ‘to-be-picked,’ the chair is the ‘to-be-sat-down-in.’ * 
The upshot of this whole, discussion is that any experi- 
ence — imagination or perception, thought, emotion, 
or volition — becomes conception when the relational con- 
sciousness of generality attaches to it; and that a 
class of objects of any sort—personal or impersonal, 
public or private, externalized or non-externalized (as well 
as any member of such a class) —may be the object of 
conception. 
A final teaching about conception is the following: The
-P-A-G-E-171
  The Nature of Conception 149 
conception belonging to a given moment is associative of 
a series of images of closely resembling objects." In other 
words, a conception forms the starting-point for a series of 
partial associations. This mark of conception, it will be ob- 
served, is not a constituent feature but a function of it — not 
a part of it, but a result of it, as it wete. There can be no 
doubt that a conceptionis, as a matter of fact, followed by a 
series, longer or shorter, of images of objects said to belong 
to aclass. The conception of ‘boat,’ for example, suggests a 
panoramic series of images of canoes, sloops, fishing schooners, 
and warships; and the conception of ‘bag’ is followed by a 
rapidly shifting procession of images of travelling bag, shoe bag, 
rag bag, knitting bag. This function of suggesting the images 
of similar objects is often expressed by saying that a concep- 
tion, or generalization, “represents” or ‘“‘stands for” a group 
of similar objects. Herein it is sharply contrasted with un- 
generalized perception or imagination. My perception of one 
particular kind of opal ring is likely to associate an imagi- 
nation of the odd little shop in “la rue de la Grosse 
Horloge,” where I bought the ring, and this in turn may 
be followed by the image of the, friend who incited me 
to buy it and by the memory of her disquisition on ancient 
gems. The images succeeding on perception or imagina- 
tion may thus be of objects very different from each other 
and from the initiating experience. In the case of con- 
ception it is otherwise. The conception ‘ring,’ for example, 
associates a series of images of rings, each resembling all 
the others in the possession of certain common qualities, 
and the conception ‘theorem’ is followed by the conscious- 
ness of propositions and of figures from the different 
books of Euclid, each more or less similar to the rest.’

  b. The Uses and Dangers of Conception 
There is no more insistent mental impulse and no more per- 
sistent mental habit than that of framing conceptions. Once 
I have learned to generalize I am eager to refer every new 
object, event, or situation to its class, and to regard it as ‘any’ 
or as ‘one of agroup’ and not merely as ‘this.’ Isee an oddly 
shaped piece of metal; it is an irregular, oblong ‘object, 
silvery, carven, hollow: I am uneasy until I classify it as a 
vase or as a tea-caddy.or as a paper-weight, that is, until I 
group it with other objects similar to it in few or in many char- 
acters. Or I find, as I walk for the first time in the Maine 
woods, a flower which I never have seen, and I do not rest 
until I group it with the orchids, regarding it asoneof a class. 
This ineradicable tendency has its justification, and — in 
a way — its explanation, in the significance of conception in 
the mental life. The conception has been well described 
as a ‘tool of the mind,’ a means of simplifying both my 
mental attitudes and my bodily reactions. By grouping 
my experiences in conception, I wisely sort out and dis- 
tribute and preserve the results of past experience. In a 
word, conception is a form of mental thrift, a canny econ- 
omy of one’s mental attainments. It will, however, ap- 
pear in the next chapter that the general judgment (which 
is merely the conception supplemented by a feeling of whole- 
ness and analyzed by. discriminating attention) is an im- 
portant constituent of reasoning ; * and in this way concep- 
tion, like memory, though mainly a preserving function, 
lays the foundation for creative experience, for acquisition. 
It will be shown, also, in our study of will, how conception

-P-A-G-E-173
  The Uses and Dangers of Conception IST 
  simplifies choice by helping us to subordinate particular 
possibilities of thought or action* to classes which we have 
earlier chosen or rejected. In brief, generalization groups 
objects of our consciousness, and the result of this group- 
ing is that a single pulse of attention covers a mass of 
phenomena that must otherwise be dealt with singly, at 
great loss of time, or utterly neglected. 
It will later be shown that conception has a social as well 
as a mainly individual value in that it facilitates intercourse 
between conscious beings by making possible conventional 
language.{ Conception aids intercourse also in an éven 
more fundamental way. We communicate with people the 
_ more readily because we and they form conceptions. For in 
conceiving we lay stress on common experiences and we ab- 
stract from that which is peculiar to ourselves. Thus, we 
may talk or write to people who have met few or none of the 
particular. objects of our acquaintance precisely because we 
have common conceptions; because, for example, we mutually 
know ‘friends’ and ‘ foods’ and ‘amusements,’ though we 
have no common friends, and live on different fare, and amuse 
ourselves in very different ways. 
It is time to turn from this enumeration of the advantages 
to a consideration of the dangers of conception. Conception is, 
as has appeared, a form of generalization, and may therefore 
menace the: life of imagination, of will, and of emotion. 
We are best fitted, at our present stage of progress, to under-- 
stand the first of these perils. The fundamental excellencies 
of imagination are vividness and accuracy of detail. Concep- 
tion, on the other hand, implies indistinctness and vagueness

-P-A-G-E-174
  — 
152 A First Book in. Psychology 
of sensational detail. My conception of andirons may be, to 
be sure, an imagination (supplemented by a feeling of gen- 
erality) of andirons; but the sensational experiences of color, 
of shape, and of surface, are far less vivid and detailed than 
in concrete imagining. Indeed, if I were vividly imagining | 
the andirons, I should be absorbed in this particular expe- 
rience; it would no longer ‘stand for,’ or associate, a lot of 
similar images; it would be a ‘this’ not an ‘any.’ Evidently, 
therefore, one never forms a conception save at the expense 
of one’s imagination; and it follows that one should never 
generalize when sensational richness is one’s chief concern. 
Obviously, also, conception is peculiarly opposed to creative 
imagining, the consciousness of the novel, for to conceive is _ 
precisely to ignore what is new, to seize on every novel object, 
scene, or event, and triumphantly to shut it in with its pred- 
ecessors in a pigeon-hole already labelled. It is, of course, 
true that conception may effectively work over the products 
of creative imagination, but too exclusive occupation with 
the general leaves no scope for originality or initiative. For 
a similar reason, conception imperils emotion and will. 
These, as will later appear, are intensely individualizing ex- 
periences, whereas conception, ignoring differences, reduces 
people and objects to groups and to classes. There is, thus, 
a double reason why the artist should eschew generalizations. 
-For the work of art should be an embodiment of the imagina- 
. tion of its maker and an incitement to the esthetic emotion 
of the observer; and both imagination and emotion are 
particularizing experiences which have no concern with the 
general as such. : 
Yet conception, rightly guarded, is of highest importance 
to us. For though our lives are mere colorless routine if we
-P-A-G-E-175
The Uses and Dangers of Conception 153 
generalize where we ought to cherish the vivid and the indi- 
vidual, yet our lives are chaos unless they are ordered by 
the awareness of rule and group. Without encroaching on the 
province of imagination we may wisely, therefore, train our- 
selves to frame useful conceptions. And such training will 
be gained both by attention to' similarities of: appearance, 
behavior, and relation, and by the attempt to follow general 
reasonings as embodied in scientific and philosophical works. .

VY CHAPTER X 
  THOUGHT, (continued) : ‘JUDGMENT AND REASONING 
II. JupGMENT 
Jupement is still another kind of organizing conscious- 
ness. By ‘judgment,’ as the term is used-in this book, is 
meant the relational consciousness of a whole as including: 
or excluding certain emphasized features, an experience re- 
flectively known as shareable with other selves. The term 
‘judgment’ is used, also, both technically and popularly, 
to indicate affirmation or belief; but, in the opinion of the 
writer, no other single word can express the consciousness 
of a whole, and it is better, therefore, to use ‘judgment’ 
in this sense. From the definition just formulated, it is. 
evident that judgment, structurally regarded, is a complex 
of elements of consciousness, characterized by the relational 
experience of ‘wholeness.’ The related object of judgment 
may be of any type: external thing, other self, inner ex- 
perience; I may, for example, make judgments about my 
hat, my friend, or my theory — that is, I may regard any 
one of the three as a complex whole and may emphasize by 
my attention a character included asa part of this whole 
or else excluded from it. The judgment whose object is an — 
external thing evidently is a perception, an imagination, or 
a concrete conception, supplemented by this relational con- 
sciousness. The distinction between these different sorts of 
consciousness of external thing is vague and shifting. For 
154
-P-A-G-E-177
Judgment ; 155° 
  example, I look off at a gray church spire, half a mile below 
me, and have a consciousness of grayness, form, roughness, 
oneness, and limitedness. I do not reflect upon this object nor 
analyze it; and no one part of it— grayness or tapering 
height a impresses me more than another. So far, then, my 
experience is mere perception. But now, for some reason, the 
grayness of the spire draws my attention; I lay little stress on 
’ its form, but I am interested in its color, — in other words, 
I have an ‘abstract notion’ of the color. Finally, however, 
I am conscious of the grayness as a part of the spire, as belong- 
ing to it, as forming with its shape and other features one 
whole; and now for the first time I am judging, conscious 
of a complex asa whole inclusive of an emphasized part. Per- 
ception and perceptual judgment alike are distinguished, first, 
from abstraction by their complexity, and second, from the 
total, sensational complex by their limitedness. But judg- 
‘ ment is distinguished from perception by the added feeling of 
wholeness, and by the invariable emphasis of some part within 
its total or of some excluded factor. The three sorts of expe- 
rience — perception, abstraction, perceptual judgment — may 
be represented in words, by the expressions: “I am conscious, 
. of grayness,” “. . . that this spire is of this gray spire,” “. . 
gray.” The propositional form of the last clause emphasizes 
both the totality of the object of the judgment and the empha- 
sized part of it. These are examples of particular judgments, 
A similar general judgment would be expressed in the words, 
“T am conscious that Gothic spires are gray.” 
Judgments are classified in several ways.'* To begin with, 
they are, as has just appeared, (r) perceptual or conceptual, 
* These Arabic numerals refer to the numbered paragraphs of Appendix, 
Section X. 
e
-P-A-G-E-178
  156 A First Book in Psychology 
according as they start from perception (or from imagination) | 
or else from conception. Judgments are grouped, in the 
second place, as (2) positive or negative, according as an ~ 
emphasized factor is included or excluded from the object of 
the judgment — that is, from the whole of which, in judging, 
one is conscious. Judgments, finally (3), may be classified 
from the manner of their formation, as analytic or synthetic, 
‘that is, as judgments of reflection or of discovery. An 
analytic judgment is the result of attention to a whole (ex- _ 
ternal thing, or self, or my own experience). For example, 
I have seen shadows on the snow a hundred times, but at 
last I emphasize, by attention, the distinctly blue color of the 
shadows cast by tree trunks; and then for the first time I 
make the judgment expressed in the words, “the shadows are 
blue.” I am then definitely conscious of the whole “blue 
shadows,” within which I emphasize the character of blue- 
ness. I may make, in similar circumstances, a negative ana- 
lytic judgment if I am conscious that “the shadows are not 
gray.” In this case the ‘judgment’ is rather to be described 
as complex of succeeding imagination upon persisting per- 
ception (or upon imagination) than as simple perception or 
imagination. For example, this experience of being conscious 
that “the shadows are not gray” is a succession of the 
‘imagination of gray shadows upon the perception of blue 
ones. The feeling of wholeness attaches to the perception 
of blue shadows; but the emphasis of attention falls also on 
the excluded character, the grayness, 
A synthetic judgment arises through the successive con+ 
sciousness of different objects. In the positive synthetic 
judgment the two objects are then regarded as parts of one 
whole. Thus, on the perception of a toad quietly sunning
-P-A-G-E-179
Judgment 157 
himself follows my perception of his mouth opening to engulf 
afly. The character of eating flies forms, henceforth, a factor 
of the whole, ‘toad eating flies,’ which is the object of my 
judgment. In this case (of synthetic judgment), though the 
judgment is reached by a sequence of perception on percep- 
tion, the judgment itself is complex perception or dmagination 
(with emphasized part), characterized by feeling of wholeness. 
It should be noted that the object-of a judgment may con- 
ceivably include more than one emphasized part. Since, 
however, our attention is very limited, it is probable that the 
greater number of judgments include, psychologically as well 
as logically, but a single predicate. The judgment, for ex- 
ample, “paramecia are unicellular and have but one form 
of reaction,” though expressed in a single proposition, is, for 
most of us, two judgments, in which the feeling of whole- 
ness attaches successively to the consciousness of the complex 
objects, ‘paramecia-unicellular’ and ‘paramecia-reacting-in- 
one-way.’ 
It is impossible to distinguish unambiguously by our 
language between an analytic judgment of reflection and a 
synthetic judgment of discovery. For the same proposi- 
tion may express what for one person is an analytic, for an- 
other a synthetic judgment, or what for the same person is 
at first a synthetic and later an analytic judgment. When, 
for example, one first handles aluminum one makes the 
synthetic judgment, ‘‘ Aluminum is light,’ but after one is 
familiar with aluminum its lightness may become as much 
an inherent character of it as the ‘feel’ of its surface, so 
that the judgment “ Aluminum is light”? becomes analytic. 
The best way in which to learn the distinction is by exam-

  Judgment is best known as reasoning, that is, as con- 
tinuous, or mediate, judging. A reasoning is a succession 
of judgments leading to a new judgment. It has two 
main forms — deductive reasoning, in which the conclud- 
ing judgment.is narrower in scope than some one of the 
preceding judgments, and inductive reasoning, in which the 
conclusion is widerthan-any preceding judgment. Usually 
inductive reasoning leads to the formation of a new concept 
or else to the reconstruction of an old one; and deductive 
reasoning modifies our consciousness of an individual by 
bringing a new individual into a class already known. 
The objects of the succeeding judgments of deductive rea- 
soning are related in the following way: each of the partial 
objects forming the total object of the conclusion, or final 
judgment, has been combined (as object of a preceding 
judgment) with another partial object, the ‘middle term’; 
and this middle term does not form an emphasized part of 
the object of the conclusion. The objects of these succeed- 
ing judgments may be symbolized thus: xy, yz, «2, where y 
stands for the suppressed middle term. In more concrete 
fashion, this description of deductive reasoning is illustrated 
by any actual instance. Suppose, for example, the succes- 
sive judgments expressed in the following propositions: —
-P-A-G-E-181
  
The Nature and Classes of Reasoning 159 
Here the first judgment is the consciousness of the bell, with 
emphasis on the excluded character of ringing. The second 
judgment is an accentuation of still another character of the 
bell — the fact of its being an electric bell, and consists in the 
consciousness of the bell as a whole, with special stress on the 
fact of its electric connections. In the third judgment most 
characters of the bell are unattended to, but the consciousness 
of it as electric is still emphasized and is supplemented by a 
new consciousness, that of connection with renewed batteries. 
Finally, in the conclusion, the character of the bell as itself 
electric is relatively unaccented, but the two characters suc- 
cessively connected with this, (1) that of the bell as ringing (or 
not ringing) and (2) that of the bell as connected with a re- 
newed battery are realized as emphasized parts of the whole, 
‘table bell which rings because connected with renewed 
batteries.’ Thus, the concluding judgment is .the realized 
connection of the terms of two preceding judgments; ‘each 
of these terms was previously connected with a third 
term, now unemphasized; and the whole experience is 
properly called ‘deductive reasoning’ or ‘mediate judg- 
ment.’ 
Inductive reasoning is less complex. A series of parallel, 
particular judgments is followed by a judgment, general 
or particular, more inclusive than any of the preceding 
judgments. From several observations, for example, of 
the fact that sal ammoniac added to the batteries 
makes the bell ring, I formulate the general judgment 
expressed in the proposition, “all electric bells ring 
when the batteries are renewed.” Such inductive reason- 
ing is thus expressed in a syllogism of the following 
sort :,—
-P-A-G-E-182
160 A First Book in Psychology 
The electric bell in the physiological laboratory rang when 
sal ammoniac was added to the battery. 
The electric bell in the laundry rang when sal ammoniac 
was added to the battery. 
The electric bell in the fire-engine house rang when sal 
ammoniac was added to the battery. 
All electric bells ring when sal ammoniac is added. 
It is clear that induction is a normal precursor and pre- 
liminary to deductive reasoning. For example, the conclusion 
of this inductive syllogism about electric bells forms part of 
the deductive reasoning about the table bell. Most scientific 
reasoning is, in truth, a combination of induction with deduc- 
tion —a series of particular judgments leading to general con- 
clusions confirmed by the application of these conclusions to 
still other particulars. The law of the conservation of energy, 
for example, was formulated as a result of successive judg- 
ments, based on observation. The repeated observations of 
Carnot, Joule, Mayer, and Helmholtz, that mechanical en- . 
ergy is convertible into an equal amount of heat led to the 
formulation of the general principle that “ to create or an- 
nihilate energy is impossible and that all material phenomena 
consist in transformations of energy.’”? The law, once formu- 
lated through induction, was applied to energy of all sorts — 
of light, of electricity, of magnetism; and again these deduc- 
tions have been inductively established. Thus, induction and 
deduction supplement each other in all effective scientific pro- 
cedure. It must be noted, however, that deductive reasoning 
is not universally based on induction. Instead, it may be 
based upon immediate judgments: axioms or assumptions. 
An example is expressed in the following syllogism : —
-P-A-G-E-183
The Nature and Classes of Reasoning 161 
  Angles A and B are alternate internal angles. 
Alternate internal angles are equal. 
Therefore A and B are equal. 
Here the second judgment is perfectly general, or universal, 
but its universality is not derived from the enumeration of 
many instances of equal alternate-internal angles. 
Reasoning, whether deductive or inductive, may consist 
of varying combinations of many sorts of judgment. The 
judgments which it includes may be positive or hegative, 
particular or general, analytic or synthetic. In the example 
of page 158, for instance, the first judgment is negative, the 
others positive; the first, second, and last are perceptual 
judgments referring to my own table bell, but the third is 
a conceptual judgment, the consciousness of an important 
character, connection with renewed batteries, of the whole 
class of ringing electric bells. The final distinction, that - 
between analytic and synthetic judgments, since it con- 
cerns only the manner of formation, not the character of 
the finished judgment, is not readily expressible in words. 
It is, however, probable that the first and fourth of these 
judgments are analytic, and that the third is synthetic. 
The second judgment may be either analytic or syn- 
‘thetic. It is the business of formal logic to study sep- 
arately these different forms of reasoning in order to dis- 
tinguish them as valid or as invalid. Thus, the logician 
teaches that reasoning is illicit if it is made up entirely of 
negative judgments, or if the conclusion is wider in scope than 
the premises taken together. Psychology, on the other hand, 
‘studies actual cases of reasoning irrespective of their validity 
or invalidity, taking account primarily of the way in which 
people do reason, not of the way in which they should reason.
-P-A-G-E-184

162 A First Book in Psychology : 
But though the psychologist may concern himself with all 
sorts of reasoning, it will be convenient to select for discussion 
the especially effective type of deductive reasoning + founded 
often on induction — which may be known as analytic- 
synthetic reasoning. It consists of the following order of 
. judgments: there is, first, an analytic judgment in which some 
one feature of a whole object is singled out and brought to the 
foreground of attention; second, a synthetic judgment whose 
object is the emphasized part of the first judgment’s object 
combined with some new character; and, finally, a judg- 
ment whose object is the originally unanalyzed whole, supple- 
mented by this new character. Analytic-synthetic reasoning 
may thus be described in the words which James applies to 
judgment in general, as the ‘substitution of parts and their 
implications or consequences for wholes.’ One concerns 
oneself, for example, with the question of the restriction of the 
power of the British House of Lords. One’s consciousness 
of the House of Lords is highly complex and very vague: it 
includes visual imaginings of hall and of figures, many verbal 
images, and relational consciousness — in particular the ex- 
perience of wholeness. If any conclusion is to be reached, 
it must be by the emphasis of some one feature of that com- 
plex object, the House of Lords — the fact, let us say, that it 
is a hereditary house. At once the simpler consciousness of 
“hereditary house’ suggests (as the consciousness of the more 
complex object had failed to suggest) that a hereditary body 
under constitutional government should not interfere with 
legislation. This character supplements the initial object of 
judgment, the British House of Lords, and is realized as 
forming with ita whole. We have, therefore, as expression 
of this reasoning, the syllogism : —
-P-A-G-E-185
° 
  The Uses and Dangers of Reasoning 163 
The British House of Lords is a hereditary house; 
Hereditary bodies should not interfere with legislation ; 
The British House of Lords should not interfere with 
legislation. 
A final remark must be made. It must expressly be noted 
that a given result may often be reached without reasoning 
as well as through reasoning. The perception that my bell 
does not ring might, for example, be followed immediately, 
without intervening analysis, by the consciousness of adding 
salammoniac to the battery. This would bea case of associ- : 
ated imagination. Cases of supposed reasoning, for example 
of animal reasoning, are often of this sort. On the other 
hand, reasoning from a suppressed premiss may be mistaken 
for imagination. So, if I say, ‘You should not drink tea, 
for you are nervous,”’ I am probably reasoning from the un- 
expressed premiss, ‘‘ Nervous people should not drink tea.” 
b. The Uses and Dangers of Reasoning 
The chief function of reasoning is to make discoveries, to 
carry us beyond the limit set to observation, memory, and 
the simpler forms of thought. Reasoning is thus an impor- 
tant form of self-development, or learning, a means of acquir- 
ing new outlooks, new points of view, new bases for action. 
It follows that effective reasoning furnishes the means for 
solving the problems which confront us, for escaping dangers, 
making use of novel materials, acquainting ourselves with 
strange situations. Analytic-synthetic reasoning attains 
these ends primarily by means of the analysis involved 
in the first judgment. For this judgment, since it is 
analytic, emphasizes a quality or an attribute within a whole 
object or situation; and because this discriminated part is
-P-A-G-E-186
  164 A First Book in Psychology 
less complex than the total in which it belongs it has fewer 
possible consequences; and because it has these definite 
consequences, the analytic judgment is likelier than a more 
complex experience to form the nucleus of a second judgment. 
When, for example; I judge that a certain mosslike substance 
is animal, not vegetable, — that is, when I emphasize its 
animal characters — I readily reach conclusions impossible by 
mere observation of it as a whole. All this is clearly taught 
by James.* “Whereas the merely empirical thinker,” he says, 
“stares at a fact in its entirety and remains helpless or gets 
‘stuck’ if it suggests no concomitant or similar, the [analytic] 
reasoner breaks it up and notices some one of its separate 
attributes. This attribute has . . . consequences which the 
fact until then was not known to have.” 
This enumeration of the uses of analytic-synthetic 
reasoning will be checked by a very natural question. It 
has been pointed out that this sort of reasoning is not the only 
method, though the usual one, of enabling us to reach new 
results. For it is always possible that immediate judgment 
may replace even analytic reasoning in any given case. One 
man may gain by a flash of intuition the same result which 
another attains only by the closest reasoning; and the bare 
result is as valuable in the one case as in the other. But 
granting that the mediate method of analytic reasoning 
is not the only way of attaining the adequate solution, there 
still remain several unassailable advantages with the analytic 
reasoner. His results, in the first place, are readily repeated. 
Intuitions, that is, immediate judgments or mere associations, 
occur we know not how; and we cannot reproduce them at 
will. The result which a man has reached by an unexplained 
* Op. cit., Voli IL, p. 330.
-P-A-G-E-187
  The Uses and Dangers of Reasoning 165 
association, once forgotten, is beyond his voluntary control. 
On the other hand, he can repeat at will the reasoning founded 
on close analysis. A student has forgotten, let us say, the 
accusative singular of the Greek word, é7&. He remembers, 
however, the reasoning process by which’he first fixed in his 
mind the fact that third declension nouns in-ts, when ac- 
cented.on the last syllable, have the lengthened accusative, 
to avoid the abrupt stop. Thus the accusative éA7éSa, for- 
gotten in itself, is remembered as one link in a chain of reason- 
ing. In the same way, one can repeat a geometrical demon- 
stration, though one has forgotten it, by beginning with the 
close analysis of the figure; one can recover the lost date, by 
reasoning from some fact associated with it, by arguing, for 
example, that, a statesman who smoked could not have 
lived before the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It behooves, 
therefore, even the person of quick intuition and of ready 
memory to train his reasoning power. The flash of inspi- 
ration may be more brilliant, but is surely far less steady, 
than the light of reason. The Aladdin réle in the mental 
life is no sustained part; the genius which appears at one’s 
first bidding may well forbear to come at a second summons. 
In plain English, the power to analyze and to reason is rela- 
tively stable, whereas unreasoned association is capricious 
and untrustworthy. It is, therefore, the part of wisdom to 
secure a reasoned theology or scientific system or practical 
philosophy, precisely because one thus has the chance to 
review and to recall it. 
This suggests another advantage of reasoning over’ im- 
mediate association: the opportunity which ‘it offers to the 
candid person to revise and to amend his results. ‘The most 
dogmatic and unyielding of individuals is the man who has
-P-A-G-E-188
  166 A First Book in Psychology , 
jumped at his conclusions. He is naturally tenacious of them, 
because he has no idea how he came by them and no hope of 
gaining any others if he lets them go. So the most ardent 
sectarian is the one who doesn’t know the raison @étre of his 
own sect, and the most zealous political partisan can give you 
no reason for his vote beyond the utterance of a talismanic 
name or symbol. It would be too much, of course, to claim 
that every reasoning person is open-minded; but it is quite 
fair to say that only persons who reason are open-minded. 
For nobody can reverse his decision who cannot retrace the 
path of deliberate reasoning which has led up to it. 
So far, only the mainly individual advantages of reason- 
ing have been considered. Reasoning has, none the less, a 
distinctly social value. For the reasoner has at least a fight- 
ing chance of sharing his results with other people’s. The 
lucky man who guesses correctly may be brilliant and in- 
spiring, but he is not likely to convince. He may be abso- 
lutely certain that prohibition does not prohibit, or that 
Sophocles is greater than Aeschylus, or that Hegelianism is 
absurd; he can even’ temporarily impose his enthusiastic 
beliefs on other people, but he does not work permanent 
change in their intellectual convictions. We are constantly 
hearing that argument is futile, and yet there seems no other 
way of deliberately trying to share one’s conclusions. 
. It would, however, be unwise to conclude that the results 
of reasoning are inevitably good. On the contrary, there is 
always danger lest deductive reasoning be trivial, and lest 
inductive reasoning be misleading. \Deductive reasoning, 
in the first place, is a waste of time if it is concerned with 
unimportant matters which are as well turned over to the 
swifter process of associative imagination;. and deductive
-P-A-G-E-189

  reasoning is deadening and dulling when it chokes the spon- 
taneity of imagination. There is no more tiresome human 
being than the man who insists on arguing every unimportant _ 
detail) Even greater peril attends the abuse of inductive 
reasoning — namely, incomplete induction based on scanty 
and overhasty observation. General "conclusions, inade- 
quately established yet obstinately cherished, are terrible 
barriers in the way of progress, Indeed, strictly speaking, 
no absolute certainty attaches td a general proposition based 
on an induction. As Hume says, “experience can be allowed 
to give direct and certain information of those precise ob- 
jects only . . ..which fell under its own cognizance;”’ and 
it is very rarely possible to examine directly all instances 
referred to in an inductively grounded universal judgment. 
One cannot, for example, measure the results of all trans- 
formations of energy; and one cannot observe that every 
particle of matter in the universe attracts every other. The 
highest degree of probability attaches to the great induc- 
tions of science; and there-is undoubted utility in inductions 
based on fewer observations, provided such inductions 
are used purely as working hypotheses to be thrown aside 
when found to conflict with fresh observations. But there is 
absolutely no excuse for the hasty induction except as starting- 
point for further investigation. The progress of science has 
been constantly obstructed by this over-tenacious clinging 
to the results of incomplete inductions — to the corpuscular 
theory of light, for example, or to catastrophism as expla- 
nation of the extinction of prehistoric forms of life. And 
the progress of culture is perpetually retarded by the hope- 
lessly persistent generalizations of shallow thinkers and 
superficial observers. Hasty inductions about people and
-P-A-G-E-190
108 A First Book in Psychology 
  nations are especially unsafe, because human beings, as com- 
pared with physical phenomena, are peculiarly irregular in 
behavior. And yet books about America and France and 
Turkey are still written as the outcome of three-months’ ob- 
servations and we are still taught that all Frenchmen are in- 
sincere, that all Americans are materialistic, and that all Ger- 
mans are musical. To be sure, many observations contradict 
all these conclusions, but the motto of the inveterate general- 
izer has been well stated in the words, “If the facts don’t cor- 
respond with my theory, so much the worse for the facts.” 
The truth is that there should be no exception to the rule: 
inadequate inductions are never to be made except as basis 
for necessary decision or for further scientific testing. 
c. Bodily Conditions and Accompaniments of Thought — 
in Particular of Reasoning 
We reminded ourselves at the outset of our study that 
physiological and psychical phenomena seem to. correspond 
closely, and that the human body is the most constant of 
the objects of our perception. Accordingly we undertook to 
classify and, as far as possible, to explain the facts of our 
consciousness by constant reference to regularly preceding, 
accompanying, and following bodily processes. We have 
now to carry out this part of our programme with reference to 
thought, and in particular with reference to reasoning. So 
far as brain processes are concerned, little need be added 
to what has been said about the brain conditions of rela- 
tional experience.* More obviously significant than these 
hypothesized brain conditions are the observable bodily re- 
actions which accompany thinking. They vary, of course, 
* Cf. Chapter VIII., pp. 138 f.
-P-A-G-E-191
  Bodily Accompaniments of Reasoning 169 
with the different forms of thought, but we should notice 
especially first, the habitual reactions called forth by concep- 
tions (as by perceptions);* and second, the delayed and 
often hesitating reactions which accompany reasoning. The 
habitual movements corresponding to our conceptions 
have been discussed in the preceding chapter.t The hesi- 
tating reactions of reasoning demand further comment. As 
contrasted with the relatively immediate reactions which 
accompany our perceiving, our imagining, and even certain 
forms of thinking, — swift comparisons, for example, — the 
outward behavior in reasoning is markedly slow. Let us 
suppose, for example, that a boy jumps into his dory and 
pushes off for a ‘row. To place the oars in the rowlocks is 
a reaction, codrdinated through experience, which follows at 
once at sight of the oars. But suppose that the oars have been 
left behind, and that he reasons out, somewhat as follows, 
the way of getting back to shore: — 
An oar is simply an oblong board; 
Any oblong board will serve as oar; 
The seat or the board in the bottom is an oblong board; 
The seat will serve as oar. ; 
The bodily reactions which accompany this reasoning do not 
follow instantaneously on his consciousness that the oars are 
gone. There is perhaps a moment, while he is thinking of 
the forgotten oars, when he makes no movement; then his 
eyes wander from one end to the other of the boat; then he 
grasps the board in the bottom of the boat and tries in vain to 
pry it up; finally he loosens the seat and begins awkwardly 
* Cf. Chapter V., p. 88. 
¢ Cf. Chapter IX., p, 148. 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
170 A First Book in Psychology 
to paddle with it. Such a series of bodily motions is sharply 
contrasted on the one hand with the instantaneous and co- 
ordinated reaction which would have followed on the percep- 
tion of the oars, and on the other hand with the equally 
immediate but uncoérdinated, chaotic, excited reactions which 
would have accompanied a mainly emotional (that is, fright- 
. ened), unreasoning consciousness that the oars were gone.* 
In this latter case there would have been no pause, no regular 
movements of eyes and hands, but rather excited, interrupted 
movements — shrieks, excited waving of the hands, jumping 
from one end to another of the boat. Conceivably, one of 
these excited movements might have turned out to be suc- 
cessful in getting the boat to shore, — for instance, he might 
accidentally have seized the boat-hook, have swept it back and 
forth in the water, and so have brought himself toward land, — 
but this success would have been neither a result nor a proof 
of his having reasoned out the way of reaching the shore. 
It would have been the accidental outcome of the random 
movements that accompany emotional consciousness. » 
The obviously hesitating and delayed character of reason- 
ing reactions has furnished. to comparative psychologists an 
important objective criterion of the occurrence of reasoning 
in young children and in animals.’ Untechnical observers 
incorrectly suppose that the spontaneous, untaught per- 
formance of any successful action, which is not an instinctive 
response, is in itself a proof of reasoning. Accordingly, a 
dog who opens a new gate or who, unbidden, brings a sponge 
when his’ master is bailing out a boat is held to reason. The 
objection to this conclusion lies in the fact that the animal. 
may have performed the supposedly reasoned act either’ 
* Cf, Chapter XI., p. 216, 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  Bodily Accompaniments of Reasoning HT 
through accidental immediate reaction or else through mem- 
ory, not through reasoning. The dog who brings the sponge 
has, presumably, often seen the sponge both in the boat and 
in the shed to which he runs to fetch it; immediate association 
without reasoning suffices to explain his action. And the 
dog who opens the gate may have opened it first by an acci- 
dental movement, and later by memory of that movement. 
To test this last hypothesis, many psychologists have ex- 
perimented in the following fashion: The dog, cat, bird, i 
monkey, or other animal on whom the experiment has been 
made, has been confined, when more or less hungry, in a cage, 
or large box; food has been placed in. sight of him, but outside 
his enclosure; and this has been so arranged that the ani- 
mal may escape by “manipulating some simple mechanism” 
through movements which he is perfectly capable of making — 
for example, by “pulling down a loop of wire, depressing a 
lever, or turning a button.” The animals have invariably 
responded by instinctive, excited, random movements of all 
sorts — by leaping, biting, clawing, trying to squeeze through 
holes. In other words, they have responded with the imme- 
diate, random, excess movements characteristic of the affective 
and excited consciousness, not with the delayed and relatively 
calm responses of the reasoning mind. In the course of 
these excited movements they have, it is true, chanced, ordi- 
narily, on the successful reaction which has released them from 
confinement. But such a reaction is certainly no proof of 
reasoning. For not only is it made in the course of the 
animal’s chaotic, random movements; it is often, though 
not always, an action never repeated. To quote Professor 
Thorndike: ‘In the case of some difficult associations,” 
the animals “would happen to do the thing six or seven 
M
-P-A-G-E-194
  172 A First Book in Psychology 
times, but after long periods of promiscuous scrabbling, and 
then forever after would fail to do it.” This observation has 
been substantiated by other experimenters, and shows abun- 
dantly that in these cases the successful acts are performed 
accidentally, and not through reasoning. For what one has 
reasoned out, one remembers: in Thorndike’s words: “If 
they had acted from inference in any case, they ought not to 
have failed in the seventh or eighth trial. What had been 
inferred six times should have been inferred the seventh.” * 
It is fair to conclude, on the basis of this evidence, that 
there is so far no proof of the occurrence of animal reasoning. 
None the less, many animals possess an alert and many-sided 
intelligence; for the immediately associated imagination may, 
as has been pointed out, lead to the same result, in action, as 
the reasoned conclusion. In questioning the ability of higher 
animals to reason, we are not, therefore, questioning their 
capacity to act effectively, or their possession of rich percepts 
and of swift-coming images. 
IV. THoucHt AND LANGUAGE 
A brief consideration of the nature and the function of 
language is rightly included in this chapter; for conventional 
language is, in a way, both effect and condition of the two 
significant factors in thought: generalization and abstraction. 
Generalization in its two forms, conception and general judg- 
ment, has already been considered. By abstraction * is meant 
attention, with emphasis upon the excluding aspect of atten- 
tion. For in attending to anything one abstracts from the 
unattended-to part of the total object of experience; and in 
* Monograph Supplement, No. 8, of the Psychological Review. Cf 
Psychological Review, Vol. V., p. 550.
-P-A-G-E-195
  Thought and Language 173 
this sense the attended-to is the abstract (more literally, the 
abstracted), and attention is abstraction. Language is pri- 
marily a social phenomenon, an aggregate of bodily reactions. 
(or results of bodily reaction) — in particular of articulate 
sounds or of gestures — by which conscious beings communi- 
cate with each other.’ Of language, thus defined, there are 
two forms; and the first of these is natural language in which 
the communicated sounds and gestures are mere immediate 
and instinctive reactions, imitative and interjectional in their © 
origin.* The different barks by which a dog signals to an- 
other, ‘food,’ ‘danger,’ ‘friend,’ are instances of this so-called 
‘natural language.’ Obviously it is highly significant in the 
development of social relations, emotional and purposive, of 
conscious beings with each other. Certainly, however, it need 
not involve thought of any sort. And — what seems at first 
sight more curious — natural language can be understood by 
such animals only as are of common species and environment. ° 
Mr. Garner, for example, who spent many months in learning 
the ‘language’ of monkeys, in one of our Zoos, was disap- 
pointed in the hope of gaining thereby an understanding ~of 
the cries and calls of monkeys in the African jungles. This 
is because the natural sounds and movements are so variously 
modified by differences in bodily structure and in environ- 
ment. 
With conventional language the case is different. The 
word, just because it is not, in its present form, the instinc- 
tive expression of any feeling, or the copy of any natural sound 
or shape, may be learned by all individuals who are capable 
of apprehending and producing it. A word is, in fact, an 
* Cf. Chapter V., p. 89, and Appendix, Section V. The student is ad- 
vised to read: C. H, Judd, “ Psychology, General Introduction,” Chapter X.
-P-A-G-E-196
  174 * A First Book in Psychology 
artificial sign realized as representative of something besides 
itself. The ability to know a given sound or gesture as a sign 
demands first; abstraction, that is, exclusive attention to the 
representative character as distinguished from all the more 
naturally interesting sense-qualities of the sound or the 
gesture; and second, generalization, that is, the grouping 
together of a lot of sensibly dissimilar sounds and motions 
by virtue of this likeness of function. Animals seem to 
lack this ability to abstract and generalize the sign-character, 
that is, to learn that phenomena so different as words pro- 
nounced, barks, and paws crossed are alike in the character 
of standing-for-something.’ It follows that animals make 
and understand sounds and movements which actually serve 
as signs, but that they do not know sounds and movements as 
belonging together to the class ‘signs.’ Thus, I may teach my 
dog, Doc, that a sharp bark will secure release from confine- 
ment, or that crossing his paws will bring him food, and I may 
even teach him to distinguish certain words, as ‘food’ and 
‘water,’ and to associate them with the appropriate objects. 
But he knows these words and barks and postures, each for 
each, as associated with a particular object, not as. possessed 
of the general character of standing-for-something else.* 
It has thus appeared that abstraction and generalization are 
essential to the formation of conventional language; and it 
must now be shown that abstraction and generalization (the 
important factors of thought) are greatly facilitated by con- 
ventional. language. Conventional language aids abstrac- 
tion or attention, because the reference of any word may be 
so limited. I may, it is true, abstract without the use of 
words — for example, in looking at a marble, I may attend

to its shape, abstracting from its color; but I cannot help 
seeing the color with the shape, and therefore the use of the 
word ‘spherical,’ referring as it does to form exclusively, 
assists abstraction. In other words, verbal imagination lacks 
the distracting complexity of concrete imagination. 
Language must, in the second place, aid generalization, since 
every word of a conventional language (exclusive of its proper 
nouns and its interjections) is a general term — that is, the 
consciousness of a word may suggest any one of a whole group 
of objects. Of course a concrete image sometimes serves this 
same purpose of suggesting a group of similar objects, but 
the very poverty and simplicity of the word specially fits it for 
this general reference. The image, for example, of my special 
lynx muff will be followed by the consciousness of places where 
T have carried it, railroad stations in which I have left it, and 
the like, whereas the perception or imagination of the word 
‘muff,’ free of vivid, particular associations, more readily 
recalls the whole class of muffs. Thus, words serve often as 
a sort of tag, or sign, for the class once formed, an artificial 
help toward distinguishing and remembering it. 
But while it is thus abundantly evident that thought and 
language are closely related, we must guard ourselves against 
two psychologically untenable views: first, the supposition 
that words invariably suggest classes of objects, and second, 
the belief that every general term implies a corresponding 
conception. As to the first point: experience shows that 
though a word is always a general term in the sense that it 
. May suggest a class of objects, yet it actually often suggests 
a single particular object or relation. The word ‘wave,’ 
for example, in the lines, “The breaking waves dashed high, 
on a stern and rockbound coast,” may, of course, suggest the
-P-A-G-E-198
  176 A First Book in Psychology 
class ‘waves’ and may be followed by a series of resembling 
images — say of waves of the sea and of air-vibrations. More 
likely, however, the word at once suggests a concrete object or 
scene; and one has a vision of a headland of the rocky New 
England coast. Indeed, the aim of poet and of narrator 
is precisely to hold words to the function of suggesting particu- 
lar scenes and emotions and to prevent their use as representa- 
tive of the class or group. Thus the potential general term 
may remain a mere verbal.image. In the second place, a 
word may be a general ferm and perform its function of sug- 
gesting similars while yet it corresponds to no conception 
or general notion. This is the case wherever the word-con- 
sciousness is unaccompanied by an awareness of generality. 
I may read the word ‘chest,’ for instance, and it may suggest to 
me a series of boxes of different shapes and sizes, and yet I 
may not be conscious of any generality. In this case, 
though the spoken or written word ‘chest’ may be called a 
‘general term,’ the verbal imagination of ‘chest’ is not, 
according to our doctrine, a conception. : 
It is thus evident that words need not correspond directly 
with conceptions. It is equally important to realize that 
conception arid, indeed, all forms of thinking, are possible 
without language.® It is true that most of us think in words. 
We find it difficult or impossible to carry out a long train of 
reasoning without formulating in words the different stages of 
it; and even when we reason silently, we are likely to discover 
ourselves imagining sub silentio the words of our argument. 
In conception, also, the verbal imagination often forms the 
centre of our experience; so that, for instance, the conception 
‘truth’ almost always includes a verbal image. Etymologists, 
indeed, argue that the absence from a given language of a
-P-A-G-E-199
  Thought and Language 177 
particular sort of words or signs is probably indication of a f 
lack of the corresponding conceptions. Savages unpossessed 
of a system of numerals count up to five or six only, and 
perform no intricate arithmetical operations ; and from the 
paucity of color-terms in Homeric Greek it is argued, not un- 
reasonably (though not decisively), that the Hellenes of this 
period discriminated few colors. But all this simply shows 
that conventional language facilitates and establishes thought, 
and that the two develop by a sort of mutual interrelation. To 
insist, as Max Miiller insists, that thought is impossible with- 
out language, is to overlook the outcome of much introspec- 
tion and to misapprehend the nature as well of thought as of 
language. Conventional language is, as has been said, a 
system of signs, composed of certain images, usually auditory, 
motor, or visual. Thinking, on the other hand, necessarily 
includes a consciousness of impersonal relations. It is ab- 
surd to assert that the experience of objects as related is abso- 
lutely dependent on one’s possession of any specific set of 
images. 
Certain experiences of the deaf and dumb furnish interest- 
ing testimony on exactly this point. D’Estrella, an educated 
deaf-mute, has given a detailed account of his moral and 
theological reasoning in the very early years of his neglected 
childhood.* He had never attended school, knew nothing 
of the conventional gesture-language, and possessed, in fact, 
only a few rude signs, none of them standing for abstract 
ideas. Yet, during this time, he not only gained a belief that 
the moon is a person, —a conclusion carefully reasoned from 
_ facts of the moon’s motion and regular appearance, — but, by 
meditating on other nature-facts, he found for himself a god,

  178 i A First Book in Psychology 
a Strong Man behind the hills, who threw the sun up into 
the sky as boys throw fireballs, who puffed the clouds from 
his pipe, and who showed his: passion by sending forth the 
wind. Mr. Ballard, another deaf-mute, describes a parallel 
experience,* his meditation “some two or three years before 
. initiation into the rudiments of written language,” on 
“the question, How came the world into being?”’ Testimony 
of this sort, though of course it may be criticised as in- 
volving the memory of long-past experiences, confirms the 
antecedent probability that thinking may be carried on in 
any terms — concrete as well as verbal. Whenever one is 
conscious of a group, or of a member of a group, then 
one is conceiving. The conception may include a verbal 
image, but need not. Whenever one is conscious of the 
wholeness of a complex, with emphasized part, then one is 
judging. The judgment often includes an imaged proposition, 
but does not necessarily contain it. Whenever, finally, one is 
conscious of successive, connected, discriminated wholes, one 
reasons. Reasoning, to be sure, more often than conceiv- 
ing or judging, has a verbal constituent, yet reasoning also 
may be carried on without words. 
- Conversely, the use of the general term, proposition, or 
syllogism, is no sure indication of judging or reasoning. 
For these forms of word-series have become so habitual 
that one may use them without full realization of their 
meaning. For example, the proposition, “the apple is yel- 
low,” may not mean more to the man who speaks it than 
the words ‘yellow apple,’ that is to say, no judgment at all, no 
experience of differentiated wholeness, need be involved; and 
the propositional form of the words may be a mere unconscious 
* James, ‘‘The Principles of Psychology,” Vol. I., pp. 266 seq.
-P-A-G-E-201
  f hought and Language 179 
reflex, due to habit. Evidently, therefore, the psychologist 
must be on his guard against the false supposition, that wher- 
ever proposition or syllogism is, there also is judgment or 
reasoning. He, of all men, must be alive to the possibility that 
words do not always reveal, or even conceal, any ‘thought 
within,’ but that they may be used without any meaning, for 
mere pleasure in their liquid syllables, their rotund vowels, 
their emotional impressiveness. 
It will be well to emphasize, in closing, the truth already so 
often illustrated that thinking is a social experience. The so- 
called ‘lonely thinker’ is a pure fiction, for every thinker 
assumes — or, at the least, may assume — community of 
experience with his fellow-thinkers ; and objects of thought, 
scientific, mathematical, and logical laws, differ from im- 
ages precisely, though not wholly, in this social reference. 
Conventional language, a product of thought, is the most 
significant proof of the social nature of conception and 
reasoning; but other specific illustrations may be found. 
The revival of classic learning, the reformation, the rise in 
the nineteenth century of the theory of evolution — all these 
are examples of social movements of thought characterized, 
though in greater and less degree, by a quickening of thinker 
by thinker, a response of thought to thought, a growth upon 
one man’s hypothesis of another’s conclusion.

  CHAPTER XI 
EMOTION 
I. Tue Nature oF Emotion 
a. Emotion as Personal Attitude 
Tue I, or conscious self, as so far described, is an exclusively 
perceiving and imagining, recognizing and thinking self. 
But nobody merely sees and hears, thinks and imagines: 
rather, every self also loves and hates and enjoys and is 
disappointed. We shall turn now to the study of this affec- 
tively and emotionally conscious self. Emotion is, first and 
foremost, an intensely individualizing experience. In loving 
and fearing I am conscious of myself as this self and no other ; 
and I am, furthermore, conscious of the individual and unique 
nature of the friend whom I love or of the superior whom I 
fear. In more technical terms: both the subject and the 
object ** of emotion are realized as unique or irreplaceable. 
In this doubly individualizing character, emotion is distin- 
guished from perception and from all forms of thought, for 
in these I lay no special stress on myself, as just this indi- | 
vidual, nor do I regard the object of my consciousness as 
peculiarly individual. Rather, I realize, reflectively if not 
immediately, that other selves see and hear as I do, and I 
assume that any other self must think asI do. It is true that, 
* These Arabic numerals, throughout this chapter, refer to numbered, 
divisions (§§) of the Appendix, Section XT. 
1890
-P-A-G-E-203
  Emotion as Personal Attitude 181 
as I reflect on my life of imagination, I seem to have been in my. 
imagining a peculiarly isolated, unique self. Yet this unique- 
ness and individuality forms no inherent part of the imagining. 
In my emotion, on the other hand, I immediately realize 
myself as a unique self; I find it difficult to believe that there 
is any other lover or hater in the world, that there is any grief 
save my grief: in a word, I individualize myself in emotion. 
And with equal emphasis I individualize the object of my 
love or hate or fear. I love this child; I hate that man; I 
delight in this sunlit stretch of river. I do not love any 
child, and hate men in general, and enjoy any river sceye. 
‘Phe occurrence of such emotions as patriotism, or oh of 
country, is sometimes urged as an argument against this 
view because the object of patriotism seems to be a 
group, or class, rather than an individual. In reply, the 
distinction must be drawn sharply between the general- 
ized class, formed by abstraction, and the social group 
which is individualized, conceived or treated as an indi- 
vidual. Patriotism is not love of the generalized group of 
beings possessed of American or Spanish characters, it 
is love of the individualized community of ‘which the 
single Americans or Spaniards are members. I may feel 
love or hate toward such a social group, never toward a 
merely general class. In this sense emotion individualizes 
its object. 
Ina sepia character, its receptiveness, emotion evidently 
resembles perception. In happiness and in unhappiness of 
every sort ty hope and in fear, in enjoyment and in dislike, 
in envy and in sympathy — I am conscious of being affected 
by my environmént, that is, by the selves and by the things 
of which I am conscious. : “My soul,” as Coleridge says, lies 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
    182 A First Book in Psychology 
“passive, driven as in surges.” All emotion includes this — 
awareness of being influenced or affected — in a word, emos~ 
tion is a receptive, or passive, experience. This character 
of emotion is often overlooked, partly because emotion is 
normally preceded or accompanied by very obvious bodily 
movements and partly because it is so often followed by the 
assertive, or active, conscious relations, will and faith. In 
the later study of these two other individualizing, yet assert- 
ive, experiences the inherent receptiveness of emotion will 
become more apparent.* 
b. Emotion as Affective Consciousness 
The Affective Elements 
As so far studied, emotion is, thus, an evidently complex, 
receptive, doubly individualizing experience with either 
personal or impersonal object. Emotion as complex or in- 
clusive experience has now to be regarded from another point 
of view. Perception, it will be remembered, is an experience, 
(1) immediately realized as receptive consciousness of exter- 
nalized and impersonal object, and (2) reflectively realized 
as shared with other selves; it is also -(3) a sensational 
experience. The description of perception as sensational is 
gained by discovering different elemental kinds of conscious- 
ness, such as seeing blue and green, feeling warmth, and tast- 
ing salt, within a complex perceptual experience; that is, 
within a ‘shared’ receptivity of the self. Such an analysis 
must now be undertaken of emotion. We must know 
whether love and fear and envy and the rest include only 
sensational elements, — say, of warmth and of pressure 
* Cf. Chapters XII., XTII.
-P-A-G-E-205
  Emotion as Affective Consciousness 183 
due to heart-beat, — or whether they include other ele- 
ments of consciousness. When we put the question in this 
way, there is little doubt about the answer. Besides contain- 
ing relational elements, an emotion is characterized, always, 
as pleasant or unpleasant (or both): for example, liking is 
pleasant and terror is unpleasant ; and pleasantness and un- 
pleasantness are clearly elemental feelings. One can no more 
tell what one means by agreeableness or by disagreeableness 
than one can tell what redness and warmth and acidity are: 
in other words, these are distinct and irreducible experiences. 
From the class of sense-elements affections are, however, 
plainly differentiated. The most striking difference is 
the following: The sense-elements, as we have seen, are 
often referred to externalized objects. I am, in fact, more 
likely to say ‘‘The pansy is purple, fragrant, and warm” 
than ‘‘I have the sensations indicated by the terms ‘ purple- 
ness,’ ‘fragrance,’ and ‘warmth.’’’ The affective elements, 
on the other hand, though they too may be externalized, 
are more often referred to the self who likes or dislikes, is 
.pleased or displeased. Indeed, it is more natural to say “I 
like olives” than ‘Olives are'pleasant to me.” A second 
difference is found in the fact that we sometimes neither like 
nor dislike our surroundings; in other words, that much of 
our every-day experience is neither pleasant nor unpleasant, 
but, rather, indifferent to us. Finally, it may be noted 
that the affective elements do not occur by themselves 
but seem, as it were, to ‘belong with’ other experiences. 
On this view (sometimes disputed) I do not merely ‘ feel 
happy,’ but am happy in this or that color or taste. The 
fact that the affective elements are not dlways present and 
that they seem to belong with other experiences of
-P-A-G-E-206
  184 A First Book in Psychology 
any order,* may be indicated by calling them ‘attributive’ 
elements of consciousness.} 
Some psychologists maintain that besides pleasantness 
and unpleasantness there are four other affective elements 
of consciousness (or ‘ feelings’); namely, excitement and 
tranquillity, tension, and relief.? On this theory, there would 
be six affective elements of three sorts, opposed to each other 
two by two. In the opinion of the writer of this book, this is 
a mistaken view; and for the following reasons. In the first 
place, though emotions are rightly characterized as exciting or 
tranquillizing, ‘excitement’ and ‘tranquillization’ are complex 
rather than elemental experiences, fusions of temporal-rela- 
tional with organic-sensational consciousness. ‘Tension,’ in 
turn, seems to be nothing more nor less than attention; and 
attention, though classified as attributive element, and so 
codrdinate with the class of affections, is not an affection: 
‘Relief,’ finally, seems to mean little more than absence from 
tension. We shall, therefore, abide by the traditional view 
that the elemental experiences peculiar to emotion are the 
two: pleasantness and unpleasantness’ 
Emotions are characterized also — and that by common 
admission — by the organic sensations which they include.’ 
Most conscious experiences contain, of course, the vague aware- 
ness of bodily processes; but in emotion these organic sensa- 
tions are peculiarly prominent. The experiences of quickened 
heart-beat, of faintness or of dizziness, of growing warmth or 
of creeping chill, are factors of most emotional experiences. 
* By the words ‘of any order’ the attributive elements are distinguished 
from extensity, which, even if not always present, attathts only to sénsatidnal 
elements. :

  The Forms of Emotion 185 
The mention of these experiences due to internal bodily 
changes suggests the problem of the physiological explana- 
tion of emotion. It-will be convenient, however, to postpone 
this discussion to the fourth section of this chapter and to 
turn at once to a more detailed psychological analysis of 
emotions. 
II. Tue Forms or Emotion 
In the effort to be true to the distinctions of actual experi- 
ence, we shall find that emotions are commonly grouped 
according to the varying relations of different selves to each 
other and on the basis of the contrast between pleasantness 
and unpleasantness. Our study of emotional experiences 
will start from the following outline of the basal emotions :* — 
SOCIAL EMOTIONS. (WirH PErsonat Osjects.)

II. Axrruistic (absorbing): —

etc. 
The fact must be emphasized that this outline makes no 
pretence of including all forms of emotion. Two omitted 
distinctions should specially be named: that between certain 
emotions according as their objects are past or future; and 
the distinction, already mentioned, between exciting and de- 
pressing emotions. From the former point of view, anxiety 
is distinguished from disappointment as having a future, not 
a past, object; and from the latter, hatred is different from
-P-A-G-E-209
  The Forms of Emotion 187 
extreme terror in that it is exciting and not depressing. All 
these distinctions might be added to the table of emotions, 
but at the risk of complicating it too greatly. 
a. Social Emotion 
We have first to study the most primitive and most signifi- 
cant of the forms of emotion — social emotion. It appears 
in the two well-marked phases which underlie all personal 
relation, as egoistic or a. altruistic, that is, as laying stress on 
myself or on other self. We must, however, guard against 
the error of describing egoistic emotion as if it included no 
awareness of other self or selves. If this were true, there 
would be no social emotion at all, for that demands the 
relation to a particular other self, and exists only in so far as 
it emphasizes and individuates the other self or other selves. 
Like and dislike, fear and gratitude, and all the rest, are ob- 
viously expressions of one’s attitude to other selves, but 
these ‘others’ are not realized as themselves caring and hating 
and fearing, but only as the conscious, yet unfeeling, targets or 
instruments to one’s own emotions. 
It follows from this distinction that many kindly, good- 
natured feelings are rightly classed as unsympathetic. Mere 
liking, for example, is as unsympathetic and egoistic an 
experience as dislike. By this particular self one is 
pleasantly affected; by this other, unpleasantly. But the 
pleasure is as distinctly individual and unshared as the dis- 
satisfaction. The other selves are means to one’s content or 
discontent, and are thought of as subordinated to one’s own 
~ interests. 
We have, therefore, two distinct types of unsympathetic *~ 
emotion. On the one hand, there is the moroseness, the - 
N 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
1 
  188 A First Book in Psychology 
discontent, the hostile fear or hate or contempt, of the man 
who realizes himself as unfavorably related to other selves. 
Quite as significant, on the other hand, is the unruffled / 
good nature, the sunshiny content, the unaffected liking, or 
even gratitude, of the individual who feels thet he is happy 
in his relations with other selves. The common temptation 
is, of course, to give to these genial feelings an ethical value, 
and to contrast dislike, as selfishness, with liking, as if that 
were unselfish. The truth is, however, that the one attitude 
is as ‘egoistic’ as the other. To like people is to realize them 
as significant to one’s own happiness, not to identify oneself 
with their happiness. - And, in truth, a great part of what is 
known as ‘love’ of family or of country is of this strictly 
egoistic nature. Dombey loved his son because the boy was 
’ ‘important as a part of his own greatness’ ; and many a man 
loves family, church, or country merely as the embodiment 
of his own particular interests and purposes. 
It is even possible to secure other people’s pleasure and to 
avoid paining them, not in the least to gain their happiness, 
but because their cries of grief assault our ears as their 
happy laughter delights us. The most consummately heart- 
less figure of modern literature, Tito Melema, is so tender- 
hearted that he turns his steps lest he crush an insett on 
the ground, and devotes a long afternoon to calming a little 
peasant’s grief. ‘‘ The softness of his nature,” we are told, 
“required that all sorrow should be hidden away from him.” 
But this same Tito Melema betrays wife and foster-father 
and country, in the interests of his own self-indulgence: other 
people’s emotions are insignificant to him in themselves; he 
regards them only as the expression of them rouses him to 
» delight or to sorrow; he never for an instant enters into
-P-A-G-E-211
  Social Emotion 189 
them, identifies himself with them, or makes them his 
own. — 
The avoidance of another’s pain does, it must be added, 
require what is sometimes called sympathy, the involuntary 
tendency to share the organic sensational consciousness of 
other people. The pain which one feels at the sight of some- 
body’s wound is an illustration of this experience, known as 
‘organic sympathy.’ We are, however, here concerned with 
emotion not with sensation. 
Besides this fundamental difference between the social 
emotions, liking and reverence and love, which involve pleas- 
antness, and the opposite ones, dislike, terror, and hate, which 
are unpleasant experiences, we must take account also of 
another ‘difference, which marks off the simpler from the 
more complex form of these feelings. In all these experi- 
ences, our happiness or unhappiness is referred, as we have 
seen, to other selves, and is realized as connected with them. 
When the consciousness of this relation becomes explicit, 
that is, when other people are clearly and definitely realized 
as affecting us and as sources of our happiness or unhappi- 
ness, then those vaguer social feelings of like and dislike 
give way to emotions in which the realization of others is 
more sharp-cut and more exactly defined. Closely regarded, 
the distinctions among these complex emotions are found to 
be based on the estimate which is formed of those ‘other 
selves’ who are means to-one’s happiness or unhappiness. 
When these other selves are realized as greater, stronger, 
than oneself, the resulting emotions are reverence and terror; 
when they are conceived as on an equality with oneself, the 
emotions are love and hate; when they appear, finally, as 
weaker or inferior, the feelings are scorn and tenderness.
-P-A-G-E-212

190 A First Book in Psychology 
It is not difficult to illustrate these abstractly worded 
definitions. Reverence, the individualizing, receptive, happy 
consciousness of a greater self, is the emotional attitude of 
child to father, of soldier to commander, of worshipper to 
God. It is the emotion thrilling through the lines of Cole- 
ridge to Wordsworth, “‘ friend of the wise and teacher of the 
good,” and culminating in the last verses : — 
“. . . Friend! my comforter and guide! 
Strong in thyself and powerful to give strength!” 
For the parallel emotion toward a self conceived neither as 
greater nor as weaker than oneself, there is no precise 
name. ‘The terms ‘love’ and ‘friendship’ are employed in 
this chapter; but to this usage it may well be objected 
that these are no mere emotions, but that, in their 
complete form, love and friendship include the active atti- 
tudes of loyalty and trust. But, named or unnamed, there 
is surely a happy emotion which obliterates distinctions 
of greater and weaker. To paraphrase Aristotle: love is the’ 
character of friendship, and by love friends, however out- 
wardly unequal, ‘“‘make themselves equal.” The word 
‘tenderness’ even more inadequately expresses the happy 
emotion centred in some one weaker than oneself. It is the 
feeling of the mother for her child, of the master for the 
cherished pupil, of every lover for the beloved one who is weak 
or afraid. It is the feeling which stirred the heart of Alkestis 
for Admetos, the emotion which Sokrates felt when he played, 
in that “way which he had,” with the hair of Phaidon, as 
he said, “To-morrow, I suppose, these fair locks will be 
severed.” ' 
To turn to the unhappy emotions: every revolt from tyr-

anny and oppression is a living illustration of the contrast 
between terror or fear and hatred. Why did the French 
peasantry, who endured the burdens of Louis Quatorze, rebel 
against the materially lessened impositions of Louis Seize? 
What is the nature of the emotional contrast between the two 
generations, only a century apart: in the earlier period, hap- 
less suffering from disease, starvation, and exaction of every 
sort, without the stirring of opposition; a hundred years later, 
fierce and furious resentment against oppression and misery ? 
There is only one answer to questions such as these. The 
peasants of the older period were still bound by the traditional 
belief that court and nobles were naturally above them, lof- 
tier and more powerful than they. Their feeling to ‘these 
superior beings, realized as instruments to their own undoing, 
was of necessity, therefore, the paralyzing emotion of terror; 
but the feeling, though intense, remained impotent and 
futile, and led to no effective reaction so long as the nobles 
held, in the minds of these peasants, their position of lofty 
isolation. The French Revolution was, in fact, directly due 
to the spread of the doctrine of social equality. _Rousseau’s 
teaching of the essential likeness of man to man, once it took 
root in the mind of the French people, grew of necessity into 
the conviction that peasants and nobles were no longer 
separated by an impassable barrier. And with this convic- 
tion of their equality, the unnerving emotion of terror gave 
way to hate with its outcome of fury and rebellion. So in 
England, four centuries earlier, the peasants rebelled under 
Wat Tyler not through mere discontent with industrial con- 
ditions but because the levelling emotion of hate had been 
excited by the teaching of the Lollard priests and of John 
Ball. The men of Kent and of Essex, persuaded of the
-P-A-G-E-214
192 A First Book in Psychology 
  essential equality of serf with master and of villein with 
landlord, no longer feared but hated the lords of the manor 
against whom they rose. 
Apparent exceptions are really illustrations of this prin- 
ciple, for the outburst of fury against one’s superior always 
turns out to be due to a momentary denial of his superiority, 
a temporary tearing of the god from its pedestal. The fear 
of the superior beings readily, however, reasserts itself, and 
this explains the temporary nature of many revolts and the 
easy resumption of authority. A handful of soldiers may 
check the violence of a mob, because the vision of brass 
buttons and uniforms inspires an unreasoning conviction of 
the superiority of military force, and transforms hate and 
rage into futile fear. The insubordinate fury of usually 
obedient children is like mob-violence, a temporary assertion 
of equality with their old-time superiors; and like mob-fury, 
the anger of children readily gives way to the old acceptance 
of authority. : 
The emotion of scorn, finally, involves the conviction of 
another’s inferiority. It is evidently impossible to despise~ 
a man, so long as one regards him as one’s own superior, or 
even as one’s equal. Contempt is, thus, the dissatisfaction (/ 
involved in one’s relation to an inferior person. The infe- 
riority may be real or imagined, and of any sort; but just 
as reverence or respect may be regarded as a virtue, so con- 
tempt is readily considered from the ethical standpoint, and 
it is rightly rated as morally unworthy if it takes account of 
the superficial inferiority of fortune or of station. 
These emotions have other selves as emphasized object. In 
contrast to them are emotions whose chief object is myself. 
‘OTis evident,’ Hume says, “ that pride and humility have

the same object . . . sel’, of which we have an intimate 
memory and consciousness. According as our idea of our- 
self is more or less advantageous, we .. . are elated by 
pride or dejected by humility. . . . Every valuable quality 
of the mind,’ Hume continues, “ . wit, good sense, 
learning, courage, integrity; all these are the causes of pride, 
and their opposites of humility. Nor are these passions con- 
fin’d to the mind. . . . A man may be proud of his agility, 
good mien, address in dancing, riding, fencing... . This 
is not all. The passion, looking farther, comprehends what-- 
ever objects are in the least ally’d or related to us. , Our 
country, family, children, relations, riches, houses, gardens, 
horses, dogs, cloaths; any of these may become a cause either 
of pride or of humility.” * Spinoza sums up this conception 
in fewer words: Pride, or self-approval (acquiescentia), is, he 
says, “joy arising from the fact that a man contemplates” 
himself and his power to act,” whereas “humility is sadness 
arising from this, that a man contemplates his own power-/ 
lessness.” + 
Besides this obvious distinction between the happiness of 
self-content and the unhappiness of self-depreciation, there 
is a difference between emotions in which the core of my 
happiness or unhappiness is my relatively independent valu- 
ation of myself and those in which my elation and dejec- 
tion consist primarily in my consciousness of others’ estima- 
tion of me. From this point of view, we may distinguish 
pride, as “‘ isolated self-esteem” in which ‘‘the mind stops at 
home, turns in upon itself, and sits before the glass in pleased 
admiration,” from vanity, the “dependent and sympathetic 
type of self-esteem,” which is “uneasy till confirmed by

other voices; unable to refrain fom inviting applause.” * 
And, similarly, we may contrast humility with shame, the 
shrinking consciousness of the loathing of one’s fellows. 
Spinoza names these emotions ‘glory’ and ‘shame.’ They 
arise, he says simply, “when a man believes himself to be 
praised or blamed.” : 
It is not necessary to insist on just these meanings for the 
words pride and vanity, humility and shame. ‘Vanity,’ for 
example, is often limited in application to baseless and empty 
self-conceit ; and ‘humility’ may be used of a tranquil realiza- 
tion, untouched by sadness, of one’s low estate. But what- 
ever names be chosen to express the distinctions, it is im- 
portant to the analyst of human emotions to recognize the 
experiences to which these terms are here applied. Aristotle’s 
great-souled man who, “being worthy of great things, rates 
himself highly,” is proud, not vain. His supreme content 
is rooted in self-satisfaction, and he disregards, if he does 
not scorn, the approval of other people. Malvolio, on the 
other hand, is vain: he delights in his appearance precisely 
because he believes himself to be.the observed of all observers. 
The despairing self-contempt of Philip Nolan, “the Man 
without a Country,” is so deep that he has no thought for 
the estimate of his companions; but Sigismond’s shame is 
his consciousness of the scorn of the Bohemians who have 
heard the stinging reproach of John Hus: I came here 
trusting in the word of an emperor. It is probable, indeed, 
that the social forms of these emotions are original and 
primitive; and it may even be that pride and humility are 
never utterly self-sufficient; and that, in one’s seemingly 
isolated approval or contempt of self, one is, after all, judg-

  Social Emotion 195 
ing oneself by the standard of the ideal spectator or by that 
of society. 
The experiences which we have so far described have all 
been characterized by their egoistic narrowing of conscious- 
ness, by their heavy emphasis on one’s own concerns and 
interests, by their incurable tendency to regard other selves 
merely as ministers to one’s own individual satisfactions and 
dissatisfactions. ‘The sympathetic emotions are manifesta- 
tions of the altruistic phase of self-consciousness, the widen- 
ing embrace of other people’s interests, the sharing of other 
people’s happiness and unhappiness. In one’s sympathetic 
relations with other people, one regards them as possessing 
a significance of their own, quite aside from their relations 
of advantage or disadvantage to oneself, and one shares 
these new interests and ideals in such wise as to enlarge the 
boundaries of one’s own experience. 
Emotions of personal sympathy are of two main types: 
I am happy in another’s happiness or unhappy in his 
grief. There is no English word to express the sharing of 
joy, and we are forced to borrow from the Germans their 
exact and perfect word, Mitfreude. The poverty of the 
English language expresses, unhappily, a defect in human 
nature. I certainly am quicker to sympathize with 
people’s sorrow than to delight in their happiness. It is 
easier to weep to my friends’ mourning than to dance to 
their piping, easier to share their griefs than to share their 
amusements, infinitely easier to console them than to make 
holiday with them. 
The greatest distinction in these simple feelings of sym- 
pathy is in the narrowness or the wideness of them/ There 
may be but one individual whose experience I actually share,
-P-A-G-E-218
  
  196 A First Book in Psychology 
whose joys and sorrows I feel as mine. In the presence of 
this one other self my strictly individual happiness is disre- 
garded, and the boundaries of my self-consciousness are 
enlarged. I live no longer my own life, but this other life — 
or rather, my own life includes this other life. Yet my 
relations to ail others save this cherished one may remain 
narrowly egoistic: I may still be concerned only for myself, 
and interested in these others only as foils to my emotions. 
Life and literature abound in examples of sympathy within 
the narrowest limits, of egoistic emotion giving way at one 
point only. Aaron Latta is a modern illustration of this 
attitude: he lives his self-centred life undisturbed by the 
wants, the hopes, the cares, of the village life about him, but 
he is quick to notice the shade on Elspeth’s brow and the 
merest quiver on her lip. With a true intuition, indeed, 
the novelists and the dramatists have united to represent the 
most unsympathetic of-mortals as vulnerable at somie point. 
Dickens, the keen student of the emotions, has only one 
Scrooge, ‘quite alone in the world . . . warning all human 
sympathy to keep its distance,’ and represents even the 
Squeerses as possessed of ‘common sympathies’ with their 
own children. 
Closely following upon the narrowest form of sympathy, 
which recognizes the claims and adopts the interests of one 
individual only, are family-feeling, club-feeling, college-feel- 
ing, church-affiliation, and all the other sympathies with 
widening groups of people. For sympathy is normally of 
slow growth. The more primitive emotions are naturally 
self-centred, and they give place only gradually to the iden- 
tification of oneself, first with the joys and griefs of one’s 
mother or nurse or most intimate playmate, then with the
-P-A-G-E-219
  Social Emotion : 107 
emotional experiences of the whole family group, later with 
the hopes and fears and regrets and delights of a larger 
circle. It is interesting to observe that, with every widening 
of one’s sympathy, the limiting circumference of one’s own 
self is pushed farther outward. The sympathetic man has 
always a richer, concreter personality than'the self-centred 
man. He has actually shared in experiences that are not im- 
mediately his own; he has seen with others’ eyes and heard 
with their ears, and his pulses have beat high to their hopes 
and joys; his experience has been enlarged by his sympathies. 
There is something abnormal, therefore, in the checking 
at any point of this outgrowth of sympathy. People whose 
sympathies embrace only the members of their family, their 
cult, or their class, are only incompletely human, for a lack 
of emotional comprehension, or sympathy, marks a stunted 
personality. Even patriotism, so far as it limits sympathy 
to feeling with the inhabitants of any one corner of the globe, 
deprives a man of his birthright: communion in the joys 
and sorrows of life with ‘all nations of men,’ or rather, with 
that which Tolstoi calls ‘the one nation.’ 
We have, finally, to consider heterogeneous sympatheti® 
emotions: happiness through realization of another’s un- 
happiness, that is, malice, and unhappiness through con- 
sciousness of another’s happiness, that is, envy. By common 
consent, these are morally undesirable emotions, yet there 
can be no question that they are sympathetic, as well as 
egoistic, that is, that they require a genuine sharing of an- 
other’s experience. I cannot envy you, if I am so deeply 
occupied with my own emotions that I do not realize you as 
happy. And I cannot really know that you are happy with- 
out, in some degree, experiencing or sharing your happiness.
-P-A-G-E-220
    198 A First Book in Psychology 
This, to be sure, is often denied: I am said to possess the 
‘idea of an emotion without experiencing the emotion itself. 
But, surely, to be conscious of emotion means nothing if it~” 
doés not mean to have the emotion. I may, of course, have 
the purely verbal images, ‘happy,’ ‘unhappy,’ ‘emotion’, 
without any affective consciousness and without any realiza- 
tion of myself in relation to others; but nobody’s emotion 
can influence my own,without my experiencing or sharing: 
it to some degree. The resulting relations to other selves 
are, therefore, heterogeneous sympathetic, or mixed, emotions. 
‘Not only do they combine happiness and unhappiness, but 
they supplement a sympathetic by an egoistic emotion: the 
happiness which we faintly share with another, in our envy, 
is swamped in the egoistic unhappiness which it arouses, 
and the unhappiness of our fellow, dimly felt in our mali- 
ciousness, is swallowed up in a surging happiness that is 
quite our own. 
It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that malice 
and envy exhaust the nature of this emotional experience. 
Barrie has shown us a perfect embodiment of mixed emotion 
in the figure of Sentimental Tommy. Never was anybody 
more sympathetic than Tommy, boy and man. He entered 
into the feeling of friend and of foe alike: divined and shared 
in Elspeth’s loneliness, Aaron’s bitterness, Grizel’s passion 
and scorn, and Corp’s loyalty. He never could have been 
what he was to all of them, had he not, up to a certain point, 
shared actually in their feelings; had he not believed in 
himself as Elspeth and Corp believed in him, hated himself 
as Aaron hated him, alternately loved and despised himself 
as Grizel loved and despised him. And yet all this sym- 
pathetic communion with others was merely a stimulus to
-P-A-G-E-221
  The Forms of Emotion 199 
his own private emotions, a ministry to the luxury of his self- 
occupation, whether delicious pleasure or equally delicious 
misery. Such sympathy, as element of one’s egoistic and 
unshared happiness or unhappiness, is that which is here 
called heterogeneous sympathetic emotion. 
: 6. Non-social Emotion 
This chapter has so far been concerned with social 
emotion, the conscjous relation of happy or unhappy self 
with other selves. But one may like or dislike the furnish- 
ings of a room as/cordially as one likes or dislikes its in- 
mates, and one ‘may be as desperately frightened by a 
loaded gun as by a tyrannical master. This means that 
emotion, thougl primarily a realized relation of oneself 
to.other selves, may be also a relation of oneself to imper- 
sonal objects. 
Some emotions, to be sure, are necessarily social. 
Every form of sympathy presupposes our realization of 
other selves, and reverence, like contempt, is felt toward 
selves’ and not toward things. Hate, also, is a social 
emotion — since, although we often feel a certain irritation, 
more than bare dislike, for inanimate objects when they 
thwart our purposes, yet in these cases we probably per- 
sonify the things at which we are angry. Such personifica- 
tion of inanimate objects is ridiculously clear ina child’s 
anger at the stones which refuse to be built into forts, or at 
the doors which resist his efforts to open them; and even 
grown-up resentment against smoking fires and catching 
hooks involves a personification of the offending object. 
’Non-social emotion, the ‘conscious relation of happy or 
unhappy self to event or to thing is, like social emotion,
-P-A-G-E-222
    200 A First Book in Psychology 
an individualizing, or particularizing, experience. Just as I 
love or hate, pity or envy, this particular person or these 
people, and do not impartially and indiscriminately care for 
‘anybody,’ so, also, I like or dislike this special thing or these 
things, am bored by this monotony, and pleased with that 
familiar experience; and my esthetic pleasure is always an 
absorption in this Chopin Mazurka, this tree white with 
blossoms, this Shakespeare sonnet, not an indiscriminate 
delight in a class or group. 
We have already instanced non-social like and dislike 
for things, not people. We have many experiences, also, of 
Satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the relational aspects of 
things or events. Our outline names only two of these: 
enjoyment of the familiar, and the parallel distaste for the 
repeated or monotonous. Both feelings are well known: 
the cosey comfort of the old chair and the worn coat, even 
when one can find a thousand flaws in both; and, on the 
other hand, the flat, stale profitlessness of the well-known 
scene and the every-day objects. We, poverty-stricken, 
English-speaking people, have no noun by which to desig- 
nate this latter experience: we may call it tediousness, or 
may speak of ourselves as ‘bored,’ but we are often driven 
to borrow one of the adequate foreign expressions, ennui or 
Langweile. 
Like and dislike and the relational emotions are dis- 
tinctly egoistic, laying special stress on myself and my con- 
dition. Among the non-social emotions, however, are 
certain highly significant experiences which are embodi- 
ments of the other phase, the altruistic, self-effacing phase 
of consciousness. The first of these, esthetic emotion,‘ 
must be considered briefly: a full treatment of it would
-P-A-G-E-223
  Zisthetic Emotion 201 
require another volume, and would lead us far afield into 
domains of philosophy and of art. A®sthetic emotion is the” 
conscious happiness in which one is absorbed, and, as it 
were, immersed in the sense-object. No. words describe 
esthetic emotion better than Byron’s question: — 
‘Are not the mountains, waves, and skies a part 
Of me and of my soul, as I of them?” 
For the esthetic consciousness, as truly as sympathetic i 
emotion, is a widening and deepening of self — never a loss 
of self — by identification of the narrow myself, not with 
other selves, but with sense-things. 
It is important to dwell on the consciousness of self in- 
volved in the esthetic feeling because there is, as we have 
seen, a sense in which the esthetic consciousness, because 
it refers to things, not to people, is rightly called impersonal. 
But absorption in the beautiful is never a loss of self. Most 
of that with which one is usually concerned is indeed lost: 
one’s practical needs, one’s scientific interests, even one’s 
loves and hates and personal relationships are vanished, but 
in place of these there is the beauty of this or that sense- 
thing, which one feels, accepts, and receives, widening thus 
the confines of one’s personality. There is an easy intro- 
spective verification of this account of the esthetic conscious- 
ness. Let a man scrutinize closely the feeling with which he 
emerges from one of those ‘pauses of the mind,’ in which 
he ‘contemplates’ an object ‘zsthetically’: he is sure to 
experience a curious feeling of having shrunken away from 
a certain largeness and inclusiveness of experience, and 
though .he has regained interests which he had temporarily 
lacked, he has also lost something from his very self.
-P-A-G-E-224
  202 A First Book in Psychology 
From this general description of esthetic emotion as an 
adoption and acknowledgment of sense-objects, an immer- 
sion of oneself in the external and objective, we enter upon 
a more detailed consideration of its characteristics. The 
esthetic emotion is, first and foremost, enjoyment, not dis” 
satisfaction, a mode of happiness, never of unhappiness. 
This follows from the completeness of absorption in the 
esthetic object, for unhappiness and dissatisfaction involve 
always desire, aversion, or resentment, the effort to escape 
from one’s environment. The esthetic emotion is, therefore, 
a consciousness always of the beautiful, never of the ugly. 
Not the emotional esthetic experience but the reflective 
esthetic judgment has to do with ugliness; for ugliness is 
not a positive term at all, ‘but a reflective description of an 
object as unesthetic) an epithet which can only be applied 
after one has had experience of the beautiful. | 
The description of the esthetic consciousness as absorp- 
tion of oneself in the sense-object indicates a second charac- 
ter of the esthetic experience, its attentiveness. This con- 
ception of <sthetic emotion, as involving attention, helps us . 
account for the things which people call beautiful. It is an 
open question whether simiple experiences, such as single 
colors or tones, have any beauty; but if we do attribute 
beauty to them, it is certainly by virtue of their intensity or 
distinctness, as when we admire the bright color or the 
distinct sound. For intense and distinct experiences are, as 
we know, ready objects of attention, so that it is fair to con- 
clude that sensational experiences are beautiful, if ever, when 
easily attended to. A careful scrutiny of complex objects 
of beauty shows that they, too, are easily attended to, though 
for another reason. The sense-object which is beautiful is
-P-A-G-E-225
  Aisthetic Emotion 203 
always a unique totality of characters, and both by the unity 
in which its details are united, and by the individuality of 
the combination, it is readily attended to. Every beautiful 
object is an illustration of the principle. Thus, curves are 
_ beautiful, and broken lines are ugly, in part because the 
curve is a whole, readily apprehended, whereas the broken 
line is a series of unessentially connected sections, with diffi- 
culty grasped as a whole; and rhythm is beautiful because 
it binds into a whole, expectantly apprehended, the succes- 
sive movements, tones, or words of the dance, the melody, or 
the poem. The more complex the parts which are bound 
together, if only the complexity does not overstrain the atten- 
tion, the more organic the unity and the greater the beauty. 
By this principle we may explain what we call the de- 
velopment of our esthetic consciousness. To a child, the 
couplet or the quatrain may well give more esthetic pleasure 
than the sonnet, precisely because he can attend to the one 
and not to the other, as harmonious whole. He will prefer 
the short lines of the ‘Cavalier Tune” — 
“Kentish Sir Byng stood for his king, 
Letting the crop-headed Parliament swing,” 
to the more complicated metre of ‘Hervé Riel” — 
“On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two, 
Did the English fight the French, — woe to France!” 
Consciousness of the beautiful is, in the third place,\/ 
direct and immediate, not reflective and associative; that 
is, the beautiful is always an object of direct and immedi- 
ate perception. An object may gain interest, significance, 
and value, but never beauty, by its suggestiveness. This 
is an important point, for sentimental moralists and even 
sober psychologists are constantly contrasting what is called 
°
-P-A-G-E-226
  204, A First Book in Psychology 
the beauty of expression, or significance, with immediately 
apprehended beauty. We are told, for instance, that the 
bent figure of a laborer is ‘beautiful’ because the man has 
worked bravely and faithfully, or that an ill-proportioned, 
wooden building is beautiful because it is a happy home. 
These are misleading metaphors: nothing can be beautiful 
which is not a direct and immediate object of sense-percepY 
tion; the figure is ugly, though the man’s life is an inspira- 
tion; the building is hideous, though it enshrines happiness. 
Nothing is gained, indeed, by confusing every value with the 
distinct and well-defined value of the beautiful. What we 
mean by esthetic consciousness is a direct experience; and, 
as Miinsterberg teaches, only the unconnected, the ‘isolated 
fact in its singleness,’ can be beautiful — can bring about, in 
other words, the complete absorption of self in sense-object. 
A final feature of the esthetic consciousness has already 
been suggested; it is a characteristic emphasized by Kant, 
by Schiller, by Schopenhauer, and, indeed, by all the great 
teachers —the entire disinterestedness of esthetic pleasure. 
This means that the contrast between one self and other selves 
is all but vanished in the esthetic experience, and that one 
becomes, as Schopenhauer says, ‘a world-eye,’ a perceiving 
and enjoying, not a grasping or a holding self. To enjoy a 
bronze or a painting because it is mine, or to delight in a view 
because it stretches out before my window, is thus an utterly 
unesthetic experience, for the sense of beauty admits no joy 
in possession, and(beauty does not belong to any individual.) 
This disinterestedness of the esthetic consciousness explains 
the mistaken opposition, sometimes made, of the ‘beautiful,’ 
to the ‘useful.’ It is quite incorrect to hold that a useful 
object may not also be beautiful; and, indeed, men like
-P-A-G-E-227
  Aisthetic Emotion 205 
Morris and Ruskin have fairly converted even this Philistine 
age to the possibility of welding together use and beauty, in 
the practical objects of every-day life, in buildings, furnishings, 
and utensils. But it is true that one’s consciousness of the 
utility is not identical with one’s sense of the beauty, and that 
one seldom, at one and the same moment, appreciates the 
convenience of a coffee-pot handle and the beauty of its 
curve, or realizes the brilliancy of a color and the likeli- 
hood that it will not fade. While, therefore, objectively 
regarded, the union of beauty and utility is the end of all 
the arts and crafts, subjectively considered, the conscious- 
ness of utility must not be identified with the sense of beauty, 
precisely because the esthetic sense demands the subordi- 
nation of narrow, personal ends. 
The common distinction of esthetic from unesthetic sense- 
experiences may be accounted for in a similar fashion. The 
organic sensations, such as satisfied hunger and thirst, bodily 
warmth, active exercise, — all these are pleasant but they are 
not ‘zsthetic’ pleasures, because they are, of necessity, sharply 
individualized and referred to my particular self. Tastes, 
also, and smells are experiences which serve narrow and 
definite personal ends of bodily sustenance. They are sel- 
dom, therefore, artistically treated as objects of esthetic 
pleasure. For the beautiful object is cut off as utterly from 
my narrow needs and interests as from the associative con- 
nection with other facts; in the words of Schopenhauer, it is 
‘neither pressed nor forced to our needs nor ‘battled against 
and conquered by other external things.’ Thus the world 
of beauty narrows to include one object of beauty. 
Two other forms of altruistic or adoptive non-social 
emotion. must be mentioned. The first of these is the
-P-A-G-E-228
  } 
206 A First Book in Psychology v 
‘enjoyment of logical unity, often discussed under the name 
‘intellectual sentiment.’ Every student knows the feeling, 
and counts among the most real of his emotional experi- 
ences the satisfied contemplation of an achieved unity in 
scientific classification or in philosophical system. The 
feeling should be sharply distinguished from another char- 
acteristic pleasure of the student, the excitement of the in- 
tellectual chase, the enjoyment of activity in even unrewarded 
search. The pleasure in logical unity follows upon this 
tormenting pleasure of the chase, as achievement follows 
upon endeavor. It clearly resembles esthetic emotion not 
only in its absorption and disinterestedness, but also in 
the characteristic harmony, or unity, of the object of delight. 
For this reason, the enjoyment of logical unity is sometimes 
reckoned as itself an esthetic experience. The writer of this 
book, however, approves the usage which restricts the appli- 
cation of the term ‘beautiful’ to sense-objects. This limita- 
tion, of course, forbids the treatment of enjoyment of logical 
unity as a form of esthetic pleasure. 
Brief reference must be made, finally, toa third form of non- 
social and altruistic emotion — the ‘sense of humor.’* For 
our present purpose, it is most important to dwell upon the 
self-absorbing, externalizing nature of the experience. Just 
as we are said to forget ourselves in our apprehension of the 
beautiful, so also we forget ourselves, that is, our narrow 
individuality, our special interests and purposes, in our ap- 
preciation of the humor of a situation. What Professor 
Santayana has well said of the esthetic consciousness we may 
equally apply to the saving sense of humor: there is hardly 
a “situation so terrible that it may not be relieved by the 
momentary pause of the mind to contemplate it zsthetically ”
-P-A-G-E-229
  The Bodily Conditions and Correlates of Emotion 207 
or humorously. It is because we have such need of pauses, 
in the arduous business of living, that we value the sense of 
humor so highly, and for this same reason we find the most 
estimable people, if devoid of humor, so inexpressibly tire- 
some. . 
There are as many theories of the comic as of the beau- 
tiful, but virtually all of them agree in defining the sense 
of humor as enjoyment of an unessential incongruity. Nar- 
rowly scrutinized, every ‘funny’ scene, every witty remark, 
every humorous situation, reveals itself as an incongruity. 
The incongruity of humor; must, however, be an unessen- 
tial discordance, else the mood of the observer changes from 
happiness to unhappiness, and the comic becomes the pathetic.

a. The Physiological Conditions 
This section, which concerns itself with less purely psy- 
chological considerations, will first discuss the physical and 
physiological conditions of emotion, — more precisely of 
those elements of Consciousness which a structural analysis 
at least the following: (1) affective elements of pleasantness 
and unpleasantness, and (2) organic sensational elements. 
(1) The affections are distinguished from sensational ele- 
ments in that they have no definite physical stimulus, no dis- 
tinct form of physical energy which corresponds with them, 
in the way in which vibrations of the ether normally condition 
sensations of color, and atmospheric waves condition sensa- 
tions of sound. This independence of physical stimula- 
tion is admitted by everybody, so far as the mode of physical
-P-A-G-E-230
  | 
208 A First Book in Psychology 
stimulus is concerned. Ether or atmosphere vibrations, 
and mechanical or electrical, liquid or gaseous, stimulus may 
bring about now a pleasant, now an unpleasant, now a per- 
fectly indifferent, experience. It is true that certain sensa- 
tional qualities — pain and probably also certain smells 
and tastes — are always unpleasant, and there may be certain 
sensational qualities which are always pleasant; but, none 
the less, every class of sensational qualities (except that of 
pain) includes both agreeable and disagreeable experiences; 
and many sensational qualities are sometimes pleasant, at 
other times unpleasant, and again indifferent.* It follows, as 
has been said, that the affective tone cannot vary with the 
mode of physical stimulus. 
* Some psychologists have, however, supposed that a definite 
relation may be found between the degree — and possibly 
also the duration — of physical stimulation and the affective 
experience. This relation is usually formulated as follows: 
any stimulus of great intensity, and many stimuli of prolonged 
duration, occasion unpleasantness, whereas stimuli of medium 
intensity bring about pleasantness, and very faint stimuli 
excite indifferent experiences.” But this is not an accurate 
statement of the facts. Both moderate stimuli, and even 
stimuli which at one time are strong enough to be unpleasant, 
may become indifferent — for example, workers in a factory 
may grow indifferent to the buzz of the wheels which is in- 
tolerable to visitors; and low degrees of stimulation, for in- 
stance, the faint pressure of fingers on the skin, are sometimes 
pleasant. The pleasantness and unpleasantness of all save 
sensational experiences of great intensity seem to depend, so 
far as they can be explained at all, not on the physical inten-

sity of their stimuli, but on two other factors — the unexpect- 
edness and the intermittence of the stimuli. The constantly 
repeated stimulus, unless very strong, is indifferent, whereas 
a similar unexpected stimulus occasions pleasure, 
We have thus been unsuccessful in the effort to discover 
definite, physical stimuli of the affections. We have, how- 
ever, reached certain positive, though as yet uncoérdinated, 
results. Very intense and intermittent stimuli occasion un- 
pleasantness; unexpected and moderate stimuli usually ex- 
cite pleasure; and habitual stimuli are indifferent. A fur- 
ther consideration of these results of our inquiry leads us to 
a study of the physiological conditions of affective elements 
of consciousness. These, to be sure, can be only hypotheti- 
cally assigned, because they have_eluded discovery by direct 
experimental or by pathological methods. We must proceed 
cautiously in the absence of direct experiment, but we are safe 
in asserting, first of all, that there are no peripheral or surface 
end-organs of pleasantness or unpleasantness, since such end- 
organs could only be excited by special physical stimuli, of 
which, as we have seen, there are none. It is also probable 
that pleasantness and unpleasantness are not brought about 
by the excitation of the sensory cells in the brain, that is, of 
the cells directly connected by afferent nerves with the surface 
end-organs. For variation in the locality of these function- 
ing cells, in the degree of their excitation, and in the number 
excited, have been seen to correspond, in all probability, with 
sensational qualities, intensities, and extensities. 
Bearing in mind that any theory of physiological conditions 
is uncertain, until it has been verified by experimental ob- 
servation, we may still profitably guess at the physiological 
basis for the affections. In the writer’s opinion, one plaus-
-P-A-G-E-232

ible account of this physiological condition is the following: 
(pleasantness and unpleasantness are occasioned by the ex- 
citation of fresh or of fatigued cells in the frontal lobes of the 
brain, and the frontal lobe is excited by way of neurones 
from the Rolandic area of the brain. When the neurones 
(or cells) of the frontal lobes, because of their well-nourished 
and unfatigued condition, react more than adequately to the 
excitation which is conveyed to them from the Rolandic area, 
an experience of pleasantness occurs; when, on the other 
hand, the cells of the frontal lobe, because they are ill 
nourished and exhausted, react inadequately to the excita- 
tion from the Rolandic area, then the affection is of un- 
pleasantness; when, finally, the activity of frontal-lobe cells 
corresponds exactly to that of the excitation, the given ex- 
perience is neither pleasant nor unpleasant, but indifferent.* 
. This theory is assumed, as working hypothesis, in this chapter. 
From this suggested explanation of the affective factors in 
emotion we must turn'to an attempted account of (2) the 
sensational constituents.” These are of two main classes: 
first, those which are brought about by internal bodily changes, 
especially by changes of heart-beat and of arterial pressure; 
second, those which are due to the movements of head, limbs, 
and trunk, including respiratory movements. Many psy- 
chologists have tried to discover, experimentally, exact dif- 
ferences between bodily conditions of pleasantness and 
unpleasantness respectively. The results of these inves-

The Bodily Conditions and Correlates of Emotion 211 
tigations are not unambiguous, for the difficulties of experi- 
menting on emotional conditions are very great. It is, in 
the first place, hard to bring about any genuine emotion 
under laboratory conditions —to rouse keen joy or pro- 
nounced grief while one is encased in apparatus destined to 
measure the bodily processes; and, in the second place, 
emotional states are so complex that it is hard to isolate 
pleasantness and unpleasantness for experimental testing. 
The following distinctions may, however, be accepted as 
_ more or less probable : *— 
(x) Pleasantness is characterized by a slow and strong 
pulse, by dilating arteries, and by bodily warmth. Un- 
pleasantness is characterized by a fast, weak pulse and by 
bodily chill. This is the result best established by experi- 
ment and by introspection. 
(2) Pleasantness is perhaps characterized by relatively 
quick and weak breathing; unpleasantness by slow and 
deep breathing. This conclusion is not so well substantiated. 
It should be added that all these bodily conditions may con- 
ceivably occur without our being conscious of them; but that 
the consciousness due to the internal changes (the conscious- 
ness of heart-beat, of warmth, of cold, and the like) are prob- 
ably always a part, even if an unemphasized part, of emotion; 
whereas the consciousness of some, at least, of the external 
changes, of altered breathing or of actual movements of the 
body, is only a frequent and not an invariable, constituent of 
emotion. My amusement, for example, often includes my 
consciousness of my smile, yet I may be amused without 
smiling. ie : 
It is thus evident that certain bodily changes, internal and 
external — changes in dilation of blood-vessels and in pulse, 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  212 A First Book in Psychology 
in respiration, and in the movements of face and limbs — 
condition and accompany the emotions. But we have not 
completed our study of the bodily conditions of emotion until 
we try to discover the brain or nerve changes which condition 
these changes in pulse, respiration, and the rest. A prob-- 
able account of these brain changes is the following. First, 
(a) sensory brain-centres are excited through perception or 
imagination of a given object; next (b) the excitation of these 
sensory neurones spreads to the brain-centre of bodily sensa- 
tions and movements, that is, to the region forward and back 
of the fissure of Rolando, and there excites motor cells.* This 
excitation of the motor neurones of the Rolandic region is 
then carried (1) downward to lower brain-centres in the 
medulla oblongata, which control the unstriped muscular 
coatings of inner organs of the body, such as blood-vessels, 
heart, and intestines. In this way the internal circulatory 
changes are brought about: the heart-beat and pulses are 
checked or increased, and the arteries (not the big ones near 
the heart, but the smaller, thin-walled vessels in outlying 
parts of the body) are dilated or constricted, thus occasioning 
either a flush and rising temperature or pallor and chilliness. 
The downward excitation is carried (2) to the striped or 
skeletal muscles attached to the bones of the body, and thus 
“the ‘external’ changes in breathing and muscular contraction 
are occasioned. Both sorts of bodily change, the ‘internal’ 
and the ‘external,’ excite end-organs of pressure, and the in- © 
ternal changes excite also end-organs of warmth and cold; 
and these excitations of the end-organs of pressure and of 
warmth or cold are carried upward by ingoing nerves to the 
sensory cells of the bodily-sensation-and-movement-centre 
* Cf. Appendix, Section III., § 7. -

  The Bodily Conditions and Correlates of Emotion 213 
(the Rolandic area). The excitation of these sensory cells 
is the immediate condition of all the organic sensations 
(whether due to internal changes or to external movements) 
which are present in emotional experience. And from the 
Rolandic area, excitations carried to the frontal lobe bring 
about that adequate (or inadequate) excitation of neurones 
which conditions the pleasantness (or unpleasantness) of 
emotion. j 
We may illustrate this complicated description by the 
hypothetical account of the bodily conditions of some special 
emotion — for example, of the delight with which I hail the 
unexpected arrival of a friend. The conditions of this joy 
are, presumably : — 
First, (a) the spread of excitations from the sense-centres, 
excited by the sight of my friend, to motor neurones in the 
Rolandic area; and (0) the excitation of downward motor 
neurones. ; c 
Second, stronger heart-beat and pulse, and dilation of the 
smaller arteries which results in bodily warmth ane in redden- 
ing of the skin. 
Third, probably, swifter and shallower breathing, as well as 
other changes (due to the contraction of skeletal muscles) such 
as smiles and hand-clapping. 
Fourth, (a) excitation of end-organs of pressure, occa- 
siuned by the internal bodily movements which always occur, 
and by the external muscular contractions when they occur; 
and (6) the upward spread of these excitations to sense-cells 
of the Rolandic area. The excitation of one group of these 
sense-cells occasions the sensations of internal warmth and 
pressure, which are always a part of the emotion of joy; and 
the excitation of another group of these cells, when it occurs, 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  214 A First Book in Psychology 
conditions the sensational consciousness of external move- 
ment which often forms a part of ‘joy.’ 
Fifth, the spread of excitations from these Rolandic sense- 
neurones, to the frontal lobes, followed by the adequate ex- 
citation of frontal-lobe cells. This vigorous excitation may 
be explained, at least in part, in the following manner: the 
stronger heart-beat, characteristic of joy, pumps blood from 
the heart, and all parts of the body, including the brain, are 
therefore relatively well nourished. The result of this 
adequate excitation of well-nourished frontal-lobe neurones 
is the affective element of the emotion — its pleasantness in 
this instance. A diagram may make all this clearer (see 
page 205): — 
6. The Instinctive Bodily Reactions to Environment 
in Emotion 
Important to a study of emotion is a consideration of those 
bodily reactions which accompany and, in part, condition 
emotional states. They are noticeable, in the first place, as 
interruptions of preceding bodily reactions of every sort. On 
the one hand, they are interruptions of those regular and 
habitual reactions which normally accompany perception; 
and, on the other hand, they interrupt the deliberate and pur- 
posive bodily movements, of thought and of will. A second 
character of emotional reactions allies them with sensational 
and with perceptual reactions: they are swift and immediate, 
following directly on stimulation. Emotional reactions, in 
the third place, like all merely sensational and like some per- 
ceptual reactions, are instinctive, untaught. The deliberative 
reaction to a new situation — the movements necessary, for 
example, in setting up a new piece of apparatus — and even

  216 A First Book in Psychology 
the less complex perceptual reactions —the movements, 
for example, with which I react to the ringing of my 
telephone bell — have all been acquired, that is, learned 
through imitation of somebody else or through my indi- 
vidual experience of success and failure; but my caress, 
my shudder, my laughter, — all these are instinctive bodily 
responses. 
Emotional reactions are classified in two ways. They are v 
distinguished, in the first place, as either chaotic excess-¥eac- 
tions or as codrdinated hereditary reactions. The distinction 
may best be brought out by illustration. Suppose that I am 
seated at my desk and dictating a letter to my stenogra- 
  pher, in part reading from manuscript and in part composing. 
My consciousness is quite unemotional. My bodily reactions 
are compounded of (x) the habitual bodily reflexes which 
accompany and follow my perception of the letter which I 
read, and of (2) the more deliberate and hesitating reflexes 
which accompany my adoption of the phrases which I add. 
At this moment I am frightened, let us say, by the sight of a 
beast escaped from a travelling menagerie. What now is the 
character of the bodily response to this environment? It is of 
“course, an instinctive reaction, and it involves an instanta- 
neous ‘checking’ of the behavior of the previous moment: I 
at once drop the letter I have been holding and I stop speak- 
ing. And it is either a chaotic and unordered reaction — a 
helpless shriek, and an impotent running to and fro — or it is 
a codrdinated action of the hereditary type; for example, I 
run away from the beast or I attack him with some bludgeon. 
Professor Angell has admirably explained emotional reac- 
tions of these two types. The stimulus of the emotion — 
whether external object or image —checks the reaction,
-P-A-G-E-239

The Bodily Conditions and Correlates of Emotion 217 
habitual or volitional, of the preceding movement, so that 
(in Angell’s words) * “the motor channels of acquired coér- 
dinated . . . movements are somewhat obstructed.”’ These 
motor impulses “ overflow .. . into channels leading partly” 
to the “involuntary pathways,” and thus resulting in aimless, 
futile movements, “and partly, through hereditary influences, 
to the voluntary system,” resulting in useful and coérdinated, 
though unplanned, reactions. 
Like all instinctive movements, emotional reactions are 
also distinguished, in the second place, as (1) altruistic, or 
adoptive, reactions of approach, such as the baby’s out- 
stretching of his arms to his mother, and as (2) egoistic 
movements of withdrawal or of aggression, such as the 
child’s shrinking from the unfamiliar or his striking in 
anger. All these instinctive hereditary reactions may be 
studied from the standpoint of their biological signifi- 
cance. Darwin and others have shown that the bodily 
changes in emotion are modified survivals of instinctive 
reactions of animals and of primitive men to their en- 
vironment.? The trembling of fear, for example, is an in- 
stinctive movement which takes the place of actual flight 
from the enemy; the snarl of hate is a modified survival 
of the way in which an animal uncovers his teeth in order 
to tear and devour his prey, and the quickened breath 
of anger is a survival of the labored breath of an animal 
or of a savage, in a life-and-death contest with an 
enemy.

IV. THE SIGNIFICANCE or EMOTION 
The two fundamental characters of emotion press to the 
foreground of our attention as we turn again to the practical 
question: What is the bearing of our psychology on our 
behavior? Precisely because of these basal characters, 
emotion is an important factor in behavior. Emotion is, in 
the first place, an individualizing experience: it fosters ex- 
plicit self-realization and direct personal relations and it 
makes other people real tome. And it is, in the second place, 
a receptive experience, and makes me sensitive to my envi-’ 
ronment and responsive to every aspect of it. A secondary 
character of emotion is also significant from the point of 
view of conduct. By its very vividness and coerciveness — 
emotion tends to interrupt the habitual course of perception 
and of thought — somewhat as the emotional bodily reac- 
tion breaks in on the habitual response or on the deliberate 
chain of reactions. And this emotional interruption has, of 
course, its uses and its corresponding defects. If my habitual 
  activities are never interrupted by emotion, I shall react in 
undeviating fashion to my environment for all the world 
like a well-wound wax figure; and if my reasonings are never 
broken in upon. by feeling, I am little more than a calculating 
machine. On the other hand, if my thinking is never secure 
from the inroad of my emotions, I am like a heap of fire- 
works, ready to be set off by any chance spark. ' 
The practical conclusions from this estimate of the sig- 
nificance of emotion are very obvious and yet are worth a 
restatement. All of them presuppose, of course, the possi- 
bility of stimulating, checking, modifying—in a word, the 
possibility of controlling the emotions. On this point one 
preliminary observation must be made. The emotions are -
-P-A-G-E-241
  The Significance of Emotion 219 
only indirectly controllable. Nobody can wave a wand and 
“Say to himself, “Now I’ll be happy,” or “Now is the time 
to feel mournful.” This is a fact which people are always 
overlooking. ‘I’ve brought you here to be happy, and you 
shall be happy,” says the mother to the little girl on a coun- 
try-week excursion; but a shriek compounded of discontent 
and indignation is the well-directed answer of the child. 
Yet, though one may not by a feat of will exorcise the evil 
passion or the gnawing melancholy there are devices for 
removing the conditions of emotion. I may mechanically 
turn my attention to an absorbing and distracting book or 
occupation; I may open my mind to some tranquillizing 
influence; or I may arbitrarily assume the bodily postures 
which accompany pleasure. I shall be most successful in 
these indirect efforts to expel emotion if, by their means, I 
can rouse a strong emotion opposed to the one which I am 
trying to banish. Love that is perfect casts out fear because 
I cannot be at the same time vividly and happily conscious 
of another self in equal companionship with me and yet 
unhappily conscious of the same-self as my superior and as 
cause of my unhappiness. And in like fashion love may 
exorcise demons of unhallowed desire and of sullen melan- 
choly. Shakespeare, great analyst of the human passions, 
vividly emphasizes this truth: — 
“When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes, 
Tall alone beweep my outcast state 
And trouble deep heaven with my bootless cries 
And look upon myself and curse my fate 
* * * * * * 
Haply I think on thee and then my state 
Like to the lark at break of day arising 
From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven’s gate.” 
P 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  220 A First Book in Psychology 
From this preliminary study of the ways of controlling 
emotion we must turn back to the more specific problem: 
What are the helpful and what the harmful emotions?” At 
the outset, we must recognize that emotion is an important, 
and indeed an inevitable, constituent of the psychic life. 
We are not to try, therefore, to suppress all emotion — and 
not to suppose that we can be successful if we try. To be 
universally bored or blasé is for most people a pose and an 
affectation; and in so far as the effort is sincere it is a mere 
sign of incompleteness, an admission that one is only half 
a human being. 
But though it is alike futile and mistaken to attempt to 
banish emotion from experience, it is none the less certain 
that emotions may be harmful. Emotions are positively 
harmful if they interfere with essential habits; they are 
harmful also if they do not stimulate to active consciousness 
— that is, to volitions or to beliefs. The first of these asser- 
tions is so obvious that it hardly needs to be enlarged upon. 
I simply cannot go on living unless I can protect my use- 
ful habits from the incursions of my emotions; and I cannot 
carry on any train of reasoning while I am strongly swayed 
by my passions or by my feelings. It is even more necessary 
to emphasize, in the second place, the truth that emotion is 
not an end in itself; that emotion, though in itself receptive 
or passive, is significant in so far as it is incentive to activity ; 
and that emotion turned upon itself, and issuing in no action 
not only fails of its particular result but inhibits the future 
tendency to activity. Indulgence in emotions never leading 
to action may become, in truth, the starting-point of actual 
disease, nervous and mental; and one of the soundest meth- 
ods of scientific psychotherapy is the discovery of a patient’s
-P-A-G-E-243
Sense-types of Imagination 23 
“(I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, 
Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, 
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet 
Wherewith the seasonabie month endows 
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit tree wild; 
And mid-May’s eldest child, 
The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine.” 
  Besides this unintended evidence from imaginative writers 
we have well-attested instances of the smell and taste imagina- 
tion, both in waking experience and in dreams, of well-trained 
observers. An inquiry among fifty Wellesley College stu- 
dents, somewhat trained in introspection, disclosed the fact 
that thirty-one were sure that they could imagine the odors 
of certain substances, such as burning tar, burning sulphur, 
and mignonette. 
More common than any of these classes of concrete imagi- 
nation is that to which we have already referred as the 
‘mixed type.’ The imagination of any object is likely, in 
other words, to include elements of more than one sense- 
order: it is not wholly visual and still less is it entirely audi- 
tory or tactual. Either the visual or auditory elements may 
predominate, but the imagination — of a dinner-party, for 
example — is rarely a mere complex of the colors and forms 
of dresses, faces, candles, flowers, foods, nor yet of the sounds 
of conversation, laughter, and service, but it includes both 
visual and auditory images, perhaps with a pressure image 
also of the ‘feel’ of linen or of silver, and a gustatory or 
olfactory image of the taste of beef or the odor of roses. 
Contrasted with all these classes of concrete imagination 
are the verbal types, which are far more prevalent than any 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
24 A First Book in Psychology 
  one, save the psychologist, realizes. In the experienc: of 
many people these altogether crowd out concrete imaginings. 
We suppose ourselves to be imagining the Heraion ‘t Argos, 
the “Madonna della Sedia,” or Liszt’s ‘Hungarian Rhap- 
sody,” when, as a matter of fact, we are mainly saying to 
ourselves the words ‘Heraion,’ ‘madonna,’ ‘rhapsody.’ Of 
course this is an artificial state of affairs. Words are con- 
ventional symbols, not instinctive reactions; they play no 
part at all in the imaginative life of animal or of baby, 
and little part in that of the savage. The civilized being, 
however, is born into a world of people whose most char- 
acteristic activity is neither eating, walking, nor fighting, but 
talking. At first, through pure imitation, and afterwards 
because he recognizes the utility of language, he largely occu- 
pies himself with words, first heard and spoken, and later 
read and written. And as habits fall away through disuse, 
so, little by little, in the experience of most of us, word-images 
take the place of concreter images of color, sound, and the 
like. It is unnecessary to dwell on the immense utility of 
verbal imagination, for we are already victims of what Mr. 
Garrison calls ‘the ignorant prejudice in favor of reading and 
writing,’ and, he might have added, ‘of talking.’ Words . 
serve not only as the means of communication, and thus as the 
surest method of social development, but — by their abstract, 
conventional form — as an aid to rapid memorizing and to 
clear reasoning; they are indispensable parts of our intel- 
lectual equipment; yet they are in themselves but poor and 
insignificant experiences, and they work us irreparable harm 
if they banish, from the life of our imagination, the warm : 
colors, broad spaces, liquid sounds, and subtle fragrances 
which might enrich and widen our experience.
-P-A-G-E-245
  The Significance of Emotion 221 
‘suppressed emotions,’ and the effort to guide them into safe 
outlets of action.* To hug one’s emotions to oneself, to 
seek or cherish them after Rousseau’s or Werther’s fashion, 
for the mere delight or excitement of having them is, there- 
fore, to run the risk of crippling one’s power to will, to choose, 
and to play an active réle in life. Constant theatre-going 
and novel-reading are injurious precisely because they stimu- 
late the emotions without providing any natural outlet of 
activity. The reality of this danger and the practical method a 
of guarding against it have been well set forth by Professor 
James. “Every time,” he says, “a fine glow of feeling 
evaporates without bearing practical fruit is worse than a 
chance lost; it works so as positively to hinder future reso- 
lutions. . . . One becomes filled with emotions which ha- 
bitually pass ‘without prompting to any deed, and so the 
inertly sentimental condition is kept up. The remedy would 
be, never to suffer oneself to have an emotion, . . . without 
expressing it afterward in some active way.” f 
This conclusion about the relation of emotion to activity 
furnishes, as will at once appear, the most important 
criterion of the value of particular emotions. Emotions are 
of very manifold sorts and kinds, and are consequently of 
diverse and unequal value. In fostering and in checking 
emotion we must, therefore, recognize the different values of. 
the different emotions. For the complete estimation of emo- 
tions, as adapted to varying situations, there is here no op- 
portunity, but the main principles of such an estimate may 
be stated. In brief: I should seek, in the control and 
development of my emotions, as complete an emotional 
* Cf. Appendix, Section XV.

-P-A-G-E-246
    222 A First Book in Psychology 
experience as is consistent with the function of emotion to 
stimulate helpful activity. On this basis, three practically 
significant conclusions may be formulated. First, in and 
for themselves, the pleasurable emotions are helpful and 
the unpleasant emotions are harmful.) This statement 
stands in direct opposition to the teaching of asceticism that 
pleasure is in itself an evil, but follows immediately from the 
principle that emotion is useful in so far as it stimulates 
activity. For pleasure more often and more intensely than 
its opposite, pain,* leads to activity. The desire to avoid 
pain is, to be sure, a stimulus alike to conscious and to 
bodily activity. But greater decisions are made, truer 
loyalty is shown, more seemingly impossible results are 
achieved through hope than through fear, through love 
than through hate, through confidence than through anxiety. 
Evidently, therefore, other things being equal, one should 
seek to rouse and to perpetuate pleasant emotions; and, con- 
versely, it is absurd to urge any one to choose a profession or 
an occupation or a course of study because it is unpleasant 
and therefore salutary. It will appear immediately that 
many pleasant emotions are harmful; but this is always by 
virtue of some character other than their pleasantness. 
Second, altruistic emotions, because most of them are 
less instinctive, are more in need of cultivation than egoistic 
emotions. ) In general, only people whose instincts have 
been warped by unnatural training need to be exhorted to 
seek happiness for themselves. Most of us, surely, would be 
larger and more effective selves if the scope of our sympa- 
' * The word ‘pain’ is here used, in its popular sense, to designate the oppo- 
site of pleasure; not in its technically correct meaning, to designate a sen- 
sational consciousness.
-P-A-G-E-247
The Significance of Emotion 223 
thies were widened, and if the happiness and unhappiness 
which we share with other selves were intensified. In order 
to widen my own personality and in order to transform 
merely passive emotion into active loyalty, I should there- 
fore cultivate my altruistic emotions. 
Third, neither the social nor the non-social emotions 
should be cherished to the exclusion of the others. This 
‘rule’ is primarily in the interest of completeness of experi- 
ence. There are people who are never stirred by the beauty 
of harmony, of form, or of color, who never draw breaths of 
satisfaction at the completeness of a demonstration or at the 
nicety of a logical distinction. Such people may be vividly 
emotional — they may be moved to their depths by personal 
contact, they may love and hate and envy, and may quiver 
with sympathy. And yet they miss part of what life might 
give them; and for lack of the occasional detachment from 
the personal, their emotional life is one-sided and thwarted. 
The opposite defect is, however, more serious. By miss- 
ing the impersonal joys of life one defrauds mainly one- 
self; but by lacking the social emotions one impoverishes 
other selves as well. The characteristic temptation of 
certain temperaments is to regard the personal as if imper- 
sonal, to look at all human happenings from the stand- 
point of esthetic and intellectual emotion. Thus regarded, 
a squalid tenement house is merely picturesque, and a de- 
falcation is an interesting social situation. The dangers 
of this attitude are apparent. The non-social emotions

situations which demand action. ; 
It will be observed that the cultivation of my altruistic 
and my social emotions leads often to my abandoning the

  happy for the unhappy experience. But this abandonment 
should never be from choice of the unhappy-as-such. In 
spite of, not because of, the unhappiness which it brings me, 
I should exchange my delighted contemplation of the thatched 
cottage for a sympathetic consciousness of the discomfort of 
its damp and smoky interior. The estimation of the com- 
parative value of pleasure is one of the concerns of ethics. 
Every student of ethics and every keen observer of life admits 
that the desire for pleasure must be strictly controlled, not 
because pleasure is evil in itself but because it is so instinc- 
tively sought that it tends to displace more important objects 
of choice. 
A brief reference must be made, in conclusion, to the 
unhealthy fashion of stimulating unpleasant emotion in the 
alleged interest of completeness of experience. The popu- 
larity of sensational novels and of problem-plays is the con- 
temporary indication of this tendency. But nobody needs to 
seek unpleasantness merely in order to enrich’ his experi- 
ence, for life is bound to furnish enough that is unpleasant. 
The only safe rule is never to create or to seek the unpleasant 
save as it leads to action individually necessary or socially 
helpful. Such a principle lies at the basis of a sound esti- 
mate in the New York Nation of certain widely read novels. 
“Their revelations of the hideous conditions of life,” the 
Nation says, “are not calculated to make any person of 
good-will seek out that suffering and relieve it.... Ina 
time when sensationalism and overemphasis of all kinds bid 
fair to be regarded as the chief literary virtues, these sordid 
infernos go a step farther and deal consciously in the revolt-

lowest human depths, bearing aid, is well; to classify a new 
gangrene is well if it evokes a remedy; but to pry about a 
pathological laboratory that one may experience the last 
qualm of disgust, and then to exploit such disgust for literary 
purposes, is to create a public nuisance.”

CHAPTER XII 
WILL 
I, THe Nature or WILL 
  a. Will as “Personal Attitude 
SHARPLY contrasted with the receptive, passive relations 
of my conscious self to its object, or environment, are 
two supremely assertive, active, experiences: will, or 
volition, and faith. In perceiving, I cannot help seeing and 
hearing and smelling; and though I can, to a degree, control 
my imaginings, yet I am a victim, often, of my imagination, 
for, in normal as well as in abnormal states, insignificant 
word-series may repeat themselves with wearisome itera- 
tion, and grewsome scenes may thrust themselves upon me. 
In emotion, finally, I am influenced by people and things, 
‘prostrate beneath them,’ as Goethe somewhere says. 
Opposed to all these receptive attitudes are will and faith: 
the dominant assertive relations of the self to objects of 
any sort.* Will is a consciousness of my active connection 
with other selves or with things, an egoistic, imperious rela- 
tion, a domineering mood, a sort of bullying attitude. In 
will I am actively, assertively, related to my environment, I 
am conscious of my superiority and my independence of it, 
*For ‘will’ and ‘faith’ the terms ‘self-assertive’ and ‘adoptive will’ 
may be substituted; and these may be regarded as codrdinate forms of 
will taken in the wider sense of self-activity. For preliminary questions,

T conceive of it as existing mainly for my own use or gratifica- 
tion. 
Every leader or captain among men is thus an embodi- 
ment of will: his domain may be great or small, spiritual or 
physical, civil or literary; he may be king or cabinetmaker, 
archbishop or machinist, inventor or novelist; whatever his 
position, if he consciously imposes himself on others, if he 
moulds to his ideals, on the one hand, their civic functions, 
their forms of worship or their literary standards, or, on the 
other hand, their furniture and their means of transportation, 
he stands to them in the relation of imperious, domineering, 
willing self. 
The rebel and the stoic are even more striking embodi- 
ments of will than the mere leaders of men. For stoicism 
and rebellion are instances of imperiousness, in the face of 
great or even overwhelming natural odds, — assertions of 
one’s independence in the very moment of opposition or de- 
feat. The stoic, in spite of his conviction that apparent 
success is with his opponent, is unflinching in the assertion 
of his own domination. ‘In the fell clutch of circum- 
stance,” he declares the more firmly — 
“T am the master of my fate, 
< I am the captain of my soul.” 
Prometheus defying Zeus who tortures him is the classic type 
of the rebel: — 
“Fiend, I defy thee! with a calm fixed mind, 
All that thou canst inflict I bid thee do. 
Foul tyrant both of Gods and humankind, 
One only being shalt thou not subdue. 
* * * * * * 
Ay, do thy worst. Thou art omnipotent 
O’er all things but thyself... 
And my own will... .” 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  228 A First Book in Psychology 
It is this attitude of mind, not any specific direction of 
consciousness toward a definite result, which constitutes what 
we call will, in the most intimate meaning of that word: a 
realization of one’s independence of people and of things, a 
sense, more or less explicit, of the subordination of one’s en- 
vironment to one’s own use, bodily or spiritual, —such a pos- 
session of oneself as is, in its completest development, a sub- 
jugation of every outlying circumstance, of every opposing 
self, and even of every insubordinate desire and thought. 
For only then is my self-assertion complete when I can say — 
“Yet am I king over myself and rule 
The torturing and conflicting throngs within.” 
Will is an egoistically assertive consciousness. It is ob- 
viously a profoundly attentive and a doubly individualizing 
experience. Never am I moreattentively conscious of myself 
as single individual, as I-and-no-other, than when I assert 
myself in domination over my environment or in opposition 
to it. And with equal emphasis I individualize the object of 
my will: I assert my superiority over this individual, I com- 
mand this soldier, I dominate this obstacle. 
There are two fundamentally important forms of will — 
will directed toward a future object and will without temporal 
reference. Will of the first type has as object a specific future 
event. Will without temporal object is the consciousness of 
my domination of opposing person or of outlying circumstance, 
and need not include any contemplation of future change. 
It is a more fundamental experience than will directed toward 
future object, for this latter form of will is the expression, 
ordinarily, of the underlying non-temporal volitional attitude. 
One often, indeed, issues commands solely as expression of an 
overbearing disposition, after the fashion of the mother who
-P-A-G-E-253
  Will as Personal Attitude 229 
sends a messenger to the garden “to see what Willie is doing 
and to make him stop it.” 
From the objects of thought of which one is aware as re- 
lated primarily to each other,* objects of will, like objects 
of emotion, are sharply distinguished in that they are 
immediately realized as related to the self. In truth, the 
assertiveness of will ‘implies the subordinate relation of objects, 
personal and impersonal, to me, the willing self. These 
future objects of will are called ends. They are often, but 
not inevitably, conceived as pleasant. 
The end of will is, in the first place, real; that is to say, 
what I will, I always will to be real. Whether it be the will 
to make my moorings, or to fit together the pieces of a picture 
puzzle, or to resist a temptation to drive a sharp bargain, the 
end of my will is always regarded as a real occurrence, in the 
sense that I will it to be real. This is, indeed, the distinction 
between the object of my will and the object of my wish. 
The wish no less than the volition is directed toward a future 
object, but whereas I may wish for a fairy godmother or for a 
canal-boat in Mars, the ends of my will never seem to me to be 
unattainable. Another obvious character of the end is pre- 
cisely its temporal relation, its futurity. A moment is that 
which-is-linked-in-two-directions, with its past and with its 
future. From both past and present the future moment is, 
however, distinguished by a lack of the irrevocableness which 
attaches to past and to present. Past and present are beyond 
change, whereas the future appears to be undetermined. 
The object of will is realized, finally, as in a way dependent 
on the willing. It is, to be sure, an open question whether 
there is justification for this conviction that the end is in any 
* Cf. Chapter IX., p. 144.  
-P-A-G-E-254
  230 A First Book in Psychology 
sense dependent on the volition; but unquestionably the 
object of will is so regarded and is thus distinguished from 
the object of desire or of belief.* 
6. The Structural Elements of Will 
‘The Feeling of Realness’ 
Many psychologists have held that will is a. complex of 
structural elements consisting mainly in sensational ele- 
ments and, in particular, in the consciousness of move- 
ment. Suppose, for example, that in rowing I will to 
feather my oar. According to the sensationalists, my will 
consists in (1) the sensational consciousness of the slight and 
mainly unnoticed movements which, instinctively, I actually 
make during volition, and (2) the sensational consciousness 
which constitutes the image preceding the deliberate volun- 
tary movements of my rowing. This antecedent image may 
be either of the movement to be executed in feathering the 
oar, or of the way in which the oar will look when feathered. 
Even in inner volition, the sensationalists. teach, — in the 
effort, for example, to solve the problem or to remember the 
forgotten date, — one is apt to wrinkle one’s forehead, to 
clench one’s fingers, and to hold one’s breath; and volition 
is simply the sensational consciousness of these movements. 
Now it doubtless is true that the willing consciousness in- 
cludes these sensations of movement ; but there is a conclu- 
sive objection to the view that volition consists wholly in 
the consciousness of such movements: experience furnishes 
each of us with countless examples of movement preceded 
by imagination of movement, which we never think of call- 
ing voluntary. I imagine an operatic air, for instance, 
* Cf. Chapter XIII, p. 246f.
-P-A-G-E-255
  The Structural Elements of Will 231 
and am surprised to find myself humming it, or I listen to 
an orchestra, and my waving fan moves unconsciously to 
the rhythm of the symphony. These are instances of 
movement preceded by the consciousness-of-movement, yet 
nobody calls the antecedent images — of operatic air or of 
musical rhythm — volitions ; and one names the movements 
impulsive, not voluntary.* But this admitted difference 
between impulse and volition would be impossible if voli- 
tion were merely imagination antecedent to movement. 
Even from the standpoint of structural analysis volition 
must include other than sensational elements. Attentive 
introspection shows that these unsensational factors are 
the consciousness (1) of futurity, (2) of connectedness, and 
(3) of realness — experiences corresponding with the char- 
acters, just discussed, of the willed object. The conscious- 
ness of connectedness is of course relational. The nature 
of the consciousness of futurity involves us again in diffi- 
culties. Evidently the consciousness of ‘future’ lacks the 
feeling of irrevocableness (partly affective, partly relational) 
which characterizes the consciousness of ‘past.’ It cer- 
tainly includes unsensational experiences of relatedness and 
it probably also includes some sort of elemental conscious- 
ness of time. 
The feeling of realness is to be grouped with the relational 
experiences. It is essentially a consciousness of harmony 
or congruence—of the harmony, for example, of one object 
with another or of my present with my past experience. 
I have the feeling of the realness of the mucilage-bottle 
and of the unrealness of an imaged orchid inasmuch as 
* Cf. Chapter V., p. go. 
T Cf. Chapter IY., p. 85; Chapter VIIL., pp. 16. 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  o53 A First Book in Psychology 
the first is, and the second is not, harmonious with my 
total desk-percept. (Such an experience of congruence is 
ordinarily called a feeling of realness only when it is a 
factor in the active attitudes of will and of belief.) 
The truth is, that will is very inadequately described by 
structural analysis alone, even when such analysis takes ac- 
count of more than the sensational elements. For, unlike 
perception and imagination, which are so markédly sen- 
sational, and unlike emotion, with its evidently affective 
nature, will contains no specific structural element. It 
should be added that will as self-activity includes the con- 
sciousness of the dependence of my object (other self or 
future event) on myself as willing, and that this awareness 
of dependence-on-me is itself irreducible to merely struc- 
tural terms. 
II. Forms or WILL

-P-A-G-E-257
  The Forms of Will 233 
This outline, it will be observed, concerns itself mainly with 
volition directed to the future. An attempt to distinguish 
the delicately varying non-temporal relations of self to other 
selves — command from aggression, or mere opposition 
from inventiveness — will be found in the next chapter.* 
The outline is based on the distinction of the will to act, or 
outer volition, from the will to think, or inner volition, — on 
the distinction, for example, of the volition to sign a check, 
or to fire a gun or to make an electric contact, from the volition 
to attend to the elusive analogy, to remember the forgotten 
name, or to think out the unsolved problem. 
a. Outer and Inner Volition (Will) 
Outer volition, or the will to act, may have as object either 
a bodily movement or a result of movement. In the expres- 
sion of James, it may have either a ‘resident’ or a ‘remote’ 
end. It is thus a consciousness of straining muscle or of 
moving hand, or else a consciousness of the effect of these 
movements, of the note to be sounded, the button to be 
fastened, or the outline to be drawn. This consciousness of 
the remote end may be visual, auditory, or, in fact, of any 
sense-type whatever. Such a consciousness of the remote 
end is followed by movements; but the movements are 
involuntary, though the consciousness is volitional, because 
the image which precedes them is an imagination of result, 
not of movement. A man wills, for example, to reach the 
railway station, and involuntarily he breaks into a run 
toward it; he has a visual consciousness of the platform, 
which means that a centre in his occipital lobe is excited; 
this excitation spreads along neurones which lead to the Ro- 
* Cf. Chapter XIII., pp. 253 ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
234 A First Book in Psychology 
  Iandic centres of leg-muscle activity, and by the excitation of 
these centres his movements of running are excited. He is 
conscious of the running, but only after it has begun, and he 
is even unconscious of some of the leg-contractions involved 
in the running. In other words, he actively relates himself 
to the railroad station, not to his leg-muscles, and the move- 
ments follow as reflexes, without being specifically willed.* 
Two corollaries about outer volition are of such im- 
portance that they must receive special emphasis. The 
volition, in the first place, though called outer volition, is 
named from the anticipated end, not from any perceivable 
result; that is, it occurs quite independently of any external 
result. The fact that I am prevented, by bodily inca- 
pacity or by external circumstance, from carrying out my 
purpose, does not alter the volitional nature of the conscious- 
ness itself. The volition is, in other words, not an external 
event, but rather the anticipation of an outer event (of an act 
or of its result), including the feeling of anticipation, the 
consciousness of the necessary connection of this definite 
experience with a future real event. The physiological 
phenomenon which follows on volition certainly is the exci- 
tation of outgoing motor neurones. But this nervous im- 
pulse may exhaust itself before the contraction of any muscles 
occurs; or the contraction may indeed take place, but 
insufficiently; or, finally, my successful action may miss the 
needed support of other actions. I may address the ball 
with infinite pains, but top it ingloriously; or I may throw 
the tiller hard over, but fail to bring my boat into the wind. 
In every case, whatever the reason of external failure, outer

Q
-P-A-G-E-259
  Outer and Inner Volition 235 
will, or volition, remains what it is by virtue of its inherent 
nature. ‘ 
The second of these corollaries of the doctrine of outer 
volition is the following: movements conditioned, or 
regularly preceded, by consciousness are not of necessity 
voluntary movements. Every conscious experience, sen- 
sational, affective, or relational, as well as volitional, stimu- 
lates motor reaction; but such stimulation is volition only 
when it includes the active relation of myself to movement. 
As mere involuntary stimulus to action, every percept, emo- 
tion, or relational experience may be termed an impulse.*? 
(A practically useful application may be made, by way of. 
digression, from the observation that actions follow normally 
from impulses as well as from volitions — in other words, 
that actions and bodily conditions and mental states are 
likely to follow on the vivid consciousness of them. For, if 
this is true, it is evident that one’s volitions should be positive 
rather than negative. To say to oneself, “I will not run 
my bicycle into that tree” is to cherish an image that is 
only too likely to prove an impulse to action long before the 
tardier volition can inhibit it. So, to resolve that “I will not 
lie awake to-night,” or “I will not fill my mind with these 
corrupting thoughts,” is. to occupy oneself with the very 
experience which should be avoided. The most effective 
volition is always therefore affirmative: one wills to keep to 
the road, not to avoid the tree; to breathe deeply and sleepily 
not to stop lying awake; to “think on .. things ... 
honest, .. . just . . . and pure,” not to avoid evil thoughts). 
These illustrations have suggested the contrast between 
inner and outer volition. Inner volition may, however, be 
* Cf. Chapter V., p. go.  
-P-A-G-E-260
  236 A First Book. in Psychology 
passed without detailed discussion. Like outer volition, it 
is active relation of myself to an end. The end is how- 
ever, in this case, another consciousness, not a physical action 
or situation but a psychic experience. The volition to re- 
member the forgotten name or date, to guess the riddle, and 
to understand the working of the intricate mechanism, are 
examples of what is meant by inner volitions. Compared 
with outer volitions, it is evident that they do not so closely 
resemble their ends (or objects). The volitional image of 
an act may be, in detail, like the act as performed; but 
the object of inner volition is itself consciousness, and to 
have the volitional consciousness of a consciousness, pre- 
cisely similar yet not identical, is impossible. A second dis- 
tinction is the following: the inner volition contains, or else 
is accompanied by, what James calls the ‘feeling of want,’ the 
consciousness, affective and relational, of a lack or gap. 
b. Simple Volition and Choice 
Within each of the classes, outer and inner will, there is 
another fundamental distinction: the distinction between 
simple will and choice, that is, will after deliberation. De- 
liberation is a conflict of will with will, an alternation in the 
tendencies or directions of self-assertiveness. It is a sort of 
clashing and warring between my varying attitudes toward 
different selves and things; a successive subordination to 
myself now of one, now of another, person; the will to possess 
now this object, now that, to suppress now this’ inclination 
and again this other. I choose, let us say, to sail to South- 
west Harbor instead of walking to Turtle Lake, but my choice 
is preceded by what is called deliberation, a sort of mental 
see-saw of forest and ocean consciousness: now I hear 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  Simple Volition and Choice 237 
in imagination the sound of the wind in the tree-tops, but 
its music is drowned by that of the water on the keel of the 
boat; again, I imagine the vivid brown of the brook bed 
and the patches of sunlight sifting through the interlaced 
boughs of the birch trees, but the vision is blotted out by 
that of the mountains rising sheer out of Somes’s Sound. 
Imaginings of the accompaniments and of the results of 
rival objects of choice may play leading réles in my delibera- 
tion. If I am deciding between a course of violin lessons 
and a stateroom on the Mauretania, not merely the images 
of fiddle and of steamer alternate, but the imagination of 
myself as playing “ Schubert’s Serenade”? will be confronted 
by the imagination, let us say, of Winchester Cathedral Close. 
If I am wavering between a set of golf clubs and the new 
Clarendon Press translations of Aristotle, the imagination 
of a round on the Myopia links may be crowded out by a 
vision of myself as reading, before my study fire, a good 
translation of the ‘‘ Metaphysics.” This whole experience 
of alternating imaginations is attended by feelings of per- 
plexity and unrest, the characteristic discomfort of ‘making 
up one’s mind.’ 
In differentiating choices, we shall do well to follow James, 
who teaches that in the choice without effort, I fully abandon 
one alternative, whereas, in the choice with effort, I choose 
one alternative in full view of the other. By effort is meant 
a complex experience in which the emotion of regret and sen- 
sations of strain are predominant. The choice without 
effort, however prolonged and restless the deliberation

pp. 528-538. 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  238 A First Book in Psychology 
which has preceded, is an easy choice, because at the exact 
time of making it no other act or result is contemplated. 
The choice without effort usually conforms with our habits 
of thought, inclination, and action. I am deliberating, let 
us suppose, whether to have the Bokhara or the Persian 
carpet. The Persian is more subdued in color, but the 
Bokhara is silkier in texture. The Persian is larger, but the 
Bokhara follows more nearly the shape of my room. So far 
I am undecided, but now I see that the blue of the Persian 
rug does not tone with the blue of my hangings, and at once, 
quite without effort, I decide upon the Bokhara. Or I am 
trying to decide whether or not to buy this volume of 
Swinburne. The paper is poor and the print is fine, but the. 
price is low and the poems are complete. “I really must 
have it,’ I say to myself. “But the print is impossible,” 
I reflect. My indecision, however prolonged, is ended by 
the discovery that the book is an unauthorized American 
reprint. Now I long since decided to buy only authorized 
editions of English books, and my actual decision, to reject 
the book, is made without effort, that is, without even a 
thought of the advantage of the book. 
When confronted, therefore, with what seems a new 
decision, one wisely tends to consider its relation to former 
choices, to fundamental inclinations, and to habitual actions. 
The result of such a ‘classification,’ as James calls it, is usu- 
ally a decision without effort. An action, clearly realized as 
essential to the fulfilment of a choice already ‘made, will 
promptly be chosen. The advantage of what the older 
psychologists called ‘governing choices’ is precisely this, 
that they make ‘subordinate choices’ easy. 
The choice with effort is not, of necessity, preceded
-P-A-G-E-263
  Simple Volition and Choice 239 
by longer or more painful deliberation (that is, vacillating 
consciousness) than the effortless choice. The essential dif- 
ference is simply this, that the choice is made with full 
consciousness of the neglected alternative. ‘“ Both alter- 
natives,” James says, “are steadily held in view, and in the 
very act of murdering the vanished possibility, the chooser 
realizes how much he is making himself lose.” George 
Eliot has suggested this experience in the story of Romola’s 
meeting with Savonarola, as she sought to escape from Tito 
and from Florence. “She foresaw that she should obey 
Savonarola and go back. His arresting voice had brought a 
new condition to her life, which made it seem impossible to 
- her that she could go on her way as if she had not heard it; 
yet she shrank as one who sees the path she must take, but 
sees, too, that the hot lava lies there.” * 
The most strenuous deliberations of all these types are 
those of the moral life: the fluctuations, between good and 
evil, right and wrong, desire and obedience. Lifelike de- 
scriptions of deliberation are, for this reason, almost always 
accounts of moral choices. Of this fact the dramatists and 
the novelists give abundant illustration; and even on the 
pages of the moralists one may find vivid suggestions of the 
warring of personal tendencies in deliberation. “I see an- 
other law in my members,” St. Paul exclaims, “warring 
against the law of my mind.” “Clearly there is,” says 
Aristotle, “besides Reason, some other natural principle 
which fights with and strains against it.” 
A practical outcome of this study of will is the conviction 
that there are some situations in which will, in any of its 
* Italics mine.
-P-A-G-E-264
240 A First Book in Psychology 
phases, is out of place. A parallel statement may be made 
about faith, or loyalty, and the following paragraphs enforce 
this conclusion concerning both these forms of self-activity. 
There are times when I have no responsibility for action, 
when I would better contemplate or observe or enjoy with 
utter receptivity, abandoning myself to stimulations frommy 
environment. In the second place, even in my active rela- 
tions, I should aim to reduce the number of my specific 
volitions and acknowledgments. Will and faith are, essen- 
tially, the active attitudes, imperious or adoptive, of the self 
as a whole to other self or selves, and to inclusive interests or 
to complete situations. Therefore will and faith are not most 
effectively directed to single acts or thoughts; but these 
result, with greater precision and with distinct economy of 
consciousness, not from the specific volition, but rather from 
the underlying will and from the wide-reaching loyalty or be- 
lief. It is true that I am not always capable of these inclusive 
and fundamental volitions and loyalties. While I am training 
myself tounaccustomed habits of mind or of body, and when- 
ever will and faith are made difficult by opposing inclinations 
or desires, then I must make frequent special volitions and 
must espouse near and not far-away ideals. I must learn to 
dance, for example, by practising steps, that is, I must will 
the special movement of the foot and bend of the body. And 
the most effective way to make myself study an uninteresting 
subject may well be to will the mechanical operations of ris- 
ing, getting and opening my book, following with eyes and 
with voice the lines and paragraphs. But these detailed and 
repeated volitions are characteristic of the will-in-training, 
not of the disciplined and educated will. When I haye 
learned to dance, it is sufficient for me to direct my will to the   o 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  Simple Volition and Choice 241 
accomplishment of a certain figure, and when I have habitu- 
ated myself to study, the thought of the subject to be mas- 
tered will be followed mechanically by the movements in- 
volved in reading. In a word, reactions once willed tend 
to become involuntary, and, indeed, bodily reactions tend 
to become unconscious; and not only involuntary and un- 
conscious bodily reactions, but immediate and unwilled 
mental reactions are likely to be more precise and exact 
than those which result from specific volition. Only when 
we no longer have to will the particular turn of the wrist 
or position of the hand are these movements mechanically 
accurate; only when we no longer need to bend to our 
will the words of poem or of formula can we put it to 
adequate use. In technical terms, the objects of our will 
and of our faith should be, as far as possible, inclusive and 
‘remote,’ and our specific acts and experiences should be, 
as far as may be, the unwilled means to these remoter ends 
and the unwilled aids to loyalty. 
It thus appears that self-development involves a gradual 
reduction in the number of our volitions and beliefs. In like 
fashion, deliberation should give place to simple volitions 
and beliefs. In the beginning, almost every situation which 
involves either will or faith calls for deliberation. There is a 
possible alternative to every action, and every decision may 
be debated. But unquestionably the ideal is to attain voli- 
tions so comprehensive and beliefs so fundamental, so far- 
reaching, that the particular acts and conclusions of life 
follow from them without anticipation or as results of simple 
volition and faith. The Rubicon once crossed, Julius 
Cesar has no place for further deliberation; the road to 
Rome once taken, Victor Emmanuel need not pause till the

breach is made in the wall by the Porta Pia; his allegiance 
to the party once fully given, William Gladstone has no need 
to debate this issue as every new bill is introduced into Parlia- 
ment. In other words, when once the governing purpose is 
formulated, when the large allegiance is given, lesser deci- 
sions become effortless, former deliberations become need- 
less ; even simple volitions, for the most part, give place to 
unpurposed conclusions and acts. This is the reason why 
the lives of great men are always, relatively speaking, simple 
lives. So fundamental and abiding are the great choices 
which they make, so encompassing and deeply rooted is 
their loyalty, that they perform naturally, even mechan- 
ically, the trivial acts on which lesser men deliberate. 
III. Tue Bopitry ConpITIONS AND CORRELATES OF WILL 
A statement concerning the neural conditions and the 
motor consequents and accompaniments of volition will con- 
clude this chapter. So far as the neural conditions are con- 
cerned, there is little to say: the brain changes, whatever 
they are, which condition the feeling of realness and the re- 
lational consciousness of time, along with the ever present 
excitations of sense-centres, must be the physiological con- 
ditions of will. More significant is the distinction, already 
made, of voluntary movements, as delayed and hesitating, 
from the impulsive movements following on perception and 
emotion. The delay is especially marked in deliberate acts ; 
yet every voluntary act (like every act preceded by an 
antecedent image of itself or even of its end) must be 
performed less promptly than an action excited mechani- 
cally and instantaneously without the intervening brain 
excitation corresponding to the antecedent imagination.
-P-A-G-E-267
The Bodily Conditions and Correlates of Will 243 
The relation between these volitional reactions and reflex, 
instinctive reactions should be noted carefully. Instinctive 
actions are untaught, and all reflex acts (whether instincts or 
lapsed habits) are immediate, whereas our volitional and our 
thought reactions are always learned through imitation or 
through individual experience, and are always delayed. Re- 
garded, however, merely as muscular contractions, without 
reference to their immediacy, to their origin, or to the con- 
sciousness preceding and accompanying them, voluntary 
movements may be similar, as well as dissimilar, to purely 
instinctive reactions in a given situation. Indeed, the simple 
movements of which a complicated voluntary movement is 
composed — the bending, grasping, pulling, for example — 
cannot differ from these same movements performed as 
mere reflexes. And one may also definitely will to perform 
an originally instinctive act, in a word, one may supplement 
instinct by will. It follows that voluntary, like instinctive, 
emotional reactions of the egoistic type may be classified as 
reactions of withdrawal or of opposition. The next chapter 
will further develop these distinctions.

  CHAPTER XIII 
FAITH AND BELIEF AS RELATED TO WILL 
I. THe Nature AND Forms or FaitH AND BELIEF 
Fairu, as distinct from will, is an adopting or acknowledg- 
ing, not an imperious, demanding phase of consciousness; it 
lays emphasis not on myself but on the ‘other self.’ In the 
attitude of will, I subordinate others to myself; in that of 
faith or loyalty, I submit myself to others. In the mood of 
will, I am ‘captain of my soul’; in my faith, I acknowledge 
another leader. Yet faith, like will, is an assertive, not a 
receptive, attitude of one self to other selves. It is no emo- 
tional sinking beneath the force of opponent or environment, 
but a spontaneous, self-initiated experience, the identification 
of oneself with another’s cause, the throwing oneself into 
another’s life, or the espousal of another’s interests. In the 
words of Edmund Gosse: “No one who is acquainted with 
the human heart will mistake this attitude for weakness of 
purpose;” it is not “poverty of will” it is ‘‘abnegation.” 
More accurately, such a relation is a supreme instance of 
faith; and men of faith have always, like the heroes of Hebrew 
history, “subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained 
promises, stopped the mouths of lions,” and this, through 
the active identification of themselves with great selves, great 
ideals, and great theories. Primarily, this attitude of ac- 
knowledgment and adoption is a relation to other selves: in 
other words, the object of faith is a self or selves. By belief, 
244
-P-A-G-E-269
‘ 
A First Book in Psychology 245 
on the other hand, is meant the assertive attitude of a self 
to an impersonal object. A man has faith in his father, his 
physician, his fellow student, his God; he believes the neces- 
sity of tariff reform, the doctrine that acquired characters 
are inherited, the dogma of the inspiration of the Bible. 
Faith and belief differ from will mainly in that each is, as 
has appeared, an altruistic not an egoistic, an adoptive 
not an imperious, attitude toward other selves or ideals 
or facts. So much for the difference. The similarities 
are more striking. Evidently faith and belief, like will, 
are assertive and doubly individualizing experiences, with 
personal or impersonal, external or non-external, ‘real’ 
objects. Structurally analyzed, faith and_ belief — still 
like will — include the elemental consciousness of reality 
or congruence.* In other words, the object of belief is 
always an object congruent with its environment. That 
which seems real to me at the same time seems harmonious. 
It follows that the objects of belief are of the most varied 
sort, but that they all agree in being regarded as congruent. 
When objects of our perception are called ‘real,’ by con- 
trast with objects of our imagination, they are known as 
harmonious with each other: the meeting-house which I 
see accords perfectly with its surroundings, the mosque 
which I imagine is incongruent with every architectural 
feature of this New England town; the electric bells which 
I hear are congruent with the sounds of the city streets, 
the strains of the “Pastoral Symphony” which I imagine 
‘are unrelated with my entire surroundings. 
From this it follows that a given object of consciousness 
may seem from one point of view real and from another un- 
* Cf. Chapter XII., pp. 231 f.
-P-A-G-E-270
  246 A First Book in Psychology 
real, according as it is compared with one set of facts or with 
another. James has brilliantly illustrated this truth under 
the heading, “The Many Worlds of Reality,” and has sug- 
gested seven such worlds,* including the worlds of sense, of 
science, of abstract truths, of fiction, and of: individual 
opinion. The motion of the sun, which is real in the sense- 
world, is thus unreal in the world of science; Goethe’s 
Lotte, though unreal in the sense-world, is so real in the 
world of poetry that we sharply contrast with her Thack- 
eray’s parodied Charlotte, whom we unhesitatingly pro- 
nounce unreal. And these distinctions mean merely that 
the motion of the sun is a phenomenon, congruent with the 
facts of our every-day observation, — sunrises, moons, and 
twilights, — but contradicted by the Copernican conception 
of our earth and the other planets of our system, in revolu- 
tion about the sun; and that the romantic Lotte is a figure 
congruent with the life and environment of Goethe’s Wer- 
ther, whereas Thackeray’s prosaic Charlotte is utterly un- 
related to the Werther world of Goethe’s creation. Faith 
and belief are thus distinguished by the feeling of realness, 
or congruence; and the objects of faith and belief are 
harmonious with their environment. 
Besides the fundamental difference between faith and be- 
lief, on the one hand, and all forms of will, two distinctions 
must be named between the ends, or objects, of will as directed 
toward the future, and the objects of belief. : These objects 
of belief, in the first place, are not necessarily future. One 
may believe a past or a present as well as a future event, as 
when, for example, one believes that Kleisthenes reformed 
* The student is advised to read James, “‘The Principles of Psychology,” 
IL, Chapter XXI., pp. 291 ff.
-P-A-G-E-271
  Faith and Belief as related to Will 247 
the constitution of Athens, or that some one is at the front 
door. In the second place, the object of belief is not regarded 
as in any sense dependent on myself. My belief that my 
new fur-lined cloak will be sent home to me next Thursday 
differs from my volition that it shall be sent home, because the 
belief lacks, what the volition has, a sense that I, as active 
self, have a certain influence upon the result which will 
follow. Belief, therefore, differs from will not only because 
belief is an altruistic, not an egoistic, form of self-activity 
and because the consciousness of the future is unessential 
to belief, but because belief lacks the consciousness of the 
dependence of the result on myself which constitutes so 
significant a factor of will. 
Brief mention only need be made of the physiological con- 
ditions and of the bodily reactions characteristic of faith and 
belief. Of the brain conditions little need be added to what 
was said of the neural conditions of will.* The bodily 
movements which accompany faith or belief resemble those 
which follow on will in being hesitating, or deliberative, but 
differ from them in a marked way. For, whereas will-re- 
actions are movements of opposition and of aggression, the 
reactions characteristic of trust and of belief are movements 
exclusively of approach: they are, as will appear, imitative 
and coéperating reactions. 
Certain corollaries of the doctrine of faith or belief, as 
characterized by the feeling of realness, are so important that 
they demand consideration. It should be noted, in the first 
place, that side by side with the experience of realness grows 
*Cf. Chapter XII, p. 242. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
   
     248 A First Book in Psychology 
up what may be called a feeling of not-realness. This is 
evidently a composite of the consciousness of opposition with 
the consciousness of reality. Neither the consciousness of 
realness nor that of unrealness can be a first consciousness 
in any life, because both are learned through experience of 
such contrasts as that between perception and imagination, 
fulfilment and hope, execution, and volition. In illustration 
of the fact that the feeling of unrealness is not a primitive 
experience, James supposes * ‘a new-born mind’ for whom 
experience has begun, ‘in the form of a visual impression of 
a hallucinatory candle.’ ‘What possible sense,” he asks, 
“for that mind would a suspicion have that the candle was not 
real? ... When we, the onlooking psychologists, say that 
it is unreal, we mean something quite definite, viz. that there 
is a world known to us which is real, and to which we per- 
ceive that the candle does not belong. . . . By hypothesis, 
however, the mind which sees the candle can spin no such 
considerations about it, for of other facts, actual or possible, 
it has no inkling whatever.” From this correct doctrine 
that the naive mind has no inkling of an unreality, James and 
Baldwin and other psychologists draw, however, the errone- 
ous conclusion that the undisputed, uncontradicted objects 
of the primitive consciousness are felt as real. The ‘“‘new- 
born mind,” James says, ‘‘cannot help believing the candle 
real,” because “the primitive impulse is to affirm the reality 
of all that is conceived.” But the proof that no object is 
primitively regarded as unreal falls far short of a proof that 
it is thought of as real; and, on the contrary, our observation 
of ordinary experience shows us many instances in which we 
are conscious neither of realness nor of unrealness. When I 
* Op. cit., Vol. IL, p. 287.  
-P-A-G-E-273
Faith and Belief as Related to Will 249 
am really absorbed in the adventures, for example, of Monte 
Cristo or in a Giovanni Bellini “ Holy Family,” I am not say- 
ing to myself, ‘this event is not historical,” or “this is a por- 
trait figure.” In a word, I am conscious neither of realness 
nor of unrealness, but exclusively of stirring event and of 
glowing color. 
The second of the corollaries from the doctrine of this 
section is the following: Though faith and belief certainly 
include the consciousness of reality, such consciousness may 
be so vague and unemphasized as to be truly an unimportant 
constituent of the total belief or faith. This fact is of high 
practical importance, for the doctrine of faith is most often 
obscured by confusing it with the bare consciousness of reality. 
A certain consciousness of reality is, it is true, essential to 
the active attitude toward selves and toward things, that is, 
essential both to faith and to will. But the mere awareness 
of reality is a very subordinate part of the experience of faith 
or belief. Faith is always an active, personal attitude tow- 
ard another self; belief is always an active, personal attitude 
toward things, events, or truths; and both faith and belief 
involve, but are not exhausted by, a consciousness of the real- 
ness of selves or of things. 
The relation between faith and the mere awareness of 
reality is most often discussed on an ethical basis. We re- 
ceive, from great teachers of righteousness, fervid exhorta- 
tions to have faith and to believe. But still other teachers 
warn us, as solemnly, that it is alike irrational and immoral 
to proclaim an obligation to hold opinions. These moralists 
insist that it is meaningless to assert the ethical superiority 
of one opinion to another, and they teach that the alleged duty, 
to hold this or that view of reality, is in opposition to the only 
   
-P-A-G-E-274
  250 A First Book in Psychology 
intellectual obligation, unswerving honesty in investigation. 
This revolt against the “duty to believe” would be justified, 
if it did not presuppose a wrong interpretation of the exhorta- 
tions to faith. The truth is, that the great moral teachers 
always regard faith as personal acknowledgment of great 
selves and of great personal ideals. Such acknowledgment 
may involve, it is true, a certain consciousness of reality, and 
is never possible toward self or toward cause which is held as 
definitely unreal. On the other hand, such a personal ac- 
knowledgment does not presuppose any reasoned conclusion 
or any philosophic conviction about reality, and may even exist 
along with an unemphasized or a fluctuating consciousness of 
the reality of the self whom one follows or of the cause 
which one espouses. The duty to have faith is always, there- 
fore, the obligation to identify oneself with the persons or the 
causes which seem the highest; and the exhortation to faith 
is always, on the lips of the great teachers, an incentive to | 
loyalty. Thus, the New Testament commands to believe 
emphasize, always, the need or the duty of an affirming, con- 
senting, personal attitude toward a divine self, and do not re- 
quire that one hold an opinion about him; and the great 
creeds, also, are expressions of a personal relation. For, 
from this point of view, a conception of the duty of faith 
may clearly be held, since personal relations, not convictions 
of reality, are the objects of obligation, and since faith is the 
assertive, adoptive attitude of one self toward another. 
Faith and belief are thus described as assertive, doubly 
individualizing adoptive attitudes to objects of any sort, and as 
distinguished by the elemental consciousness of realness and 
by that of congruence. An attempt to classify will show that,
-P-A-G-E-275
Faith and Belief as Related to Will 251 
like volition, faith and belief may be inner or outer, that is, 
may consist in the acknowledgment of ideal or of deed, and 
may be deliberative or simple. Deliberative struggles of 
faith with faith, of belief with belief, are universal experi- 
ences. Antigone’s faithful love for her brother in opposi- 
tion to her obedience to the state, the loyalty of the Soeur 
Simplice to Jean Valjean battling with her devotion to the 
ideal of truth, Robert Lee’s allegiance to his state in 
conflict with his love for the Union, — are classic examples 
of an experience to which nobody is a stranger. Midway 
between this form of deliberation and the purely voluntary 
conflict. of will with will — the alternating impulses to 
subordinate to oneself now one, now another, person 
or external thing —are the crucial struggles between will 
and faith. The crisis in the life of Neoptolemos was such 
a conflict between will, the impulse to crush Philoctetes de- 
spoiled of his weapons, and faith, the loyal acknowledgment of 
the rights of Philoctetes and the active adoption of his cause. 
Romola’s deliberation, also, is essentially the vibration be- 
tween these two fundamental tendencies toward self-assertion 
and self-effacement, toward the satisfaction of her own cray- 
ing for a new life and the acknowledgment of a higher author- 
ity than her own desire. Both these are instances of an alter- 
nation, not between one willing tendency and another, but a 
fluctuation between will and faith, the egoistic and altruistic 
tendencies, the imperious and the acknowledging modes, the 
decision to lose one’s life for another’s sake or to save it. 
II. FarrH AND WILL As SociaL ATTITUDES 
Both faith and will are most completely expressed in our 
social relations. As social attitudes they are so closely con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
252 A First Book in Psychology 
  nected that we may profitably consider both in a single 
section. It is certain that only in will and in faith — in my 
self-assertion and in.my devotion —do I come fully to 
myself; and that only in will and in loyalty, only as asser- 
tive, active self — as leader or as follower — do I influence 
my environment. Obviously, therefore, these are practi- 
cally significant experiences; and indeed all other forms of 
consciousness — memory, reasoning, and, notably, emotion 
— are estimated always not for themselves merely, but as 
material or incentive for self-assertion and for loyalty. No 
quickness of discernment, no power of thought, no depth of 
emotion, can ever take the place of what may be named 
energy of spirit. He who lacks it may well echo the cry, 
“Ce n’est pas de conseils, c’est de force et de fécondite 
spirituelle que j’ai besoin.” 
The contrast between the two forms of mental energy has 
been made repeatedly. Will, in its social reference, is the 
egoistic and imperious attitude, whereas faith is the adoptive 
and acknowledging attitude, not toward event or physical 
environment but toward other self or selves. In other 
words, will and faith have here a personal object — either a 
single individual self or a group of selves. 
Innumerable are the phases, the aspects, the forms of 
these two great modes of activity, will and faith. The more 
important of them are suggested in the following summary, 
and in the comment upon it : — 
Will Faith (Loyalty) 
(Imperious Attitude) (Adoptive Attitude) 
Aversion Approach 
Opposition (including Invention) Imitation 
Command Obedience 
Leadership 
Aggression Self-sacrifice
-P-A-G-E-277
  Faith and Will as Social Attitudes 253 
Aggression and self-sacrifice are alike in that each seems 
to aim at the destruction of a self — either at that of the 
object self who is tyrannized over, subjugated, trampled on 
in aggressive will or at that of the subject self who destroys 
himself in the self-sacrifice of loyalty. At the other extreme 
are bare aversion and approach, and (more significant) oppo- 
sition and imitation in which I assert and express either my 
difference from another self or my likeness to him. Imita- 
tion has been discussed in an earlier chapter as a form of 
social learning, under the two heads, physical and psy- 
chical, with special reference to impulsive, or mechanical, 
imitation.* Our present concern is with active, adoptive 
imitation, that is, with imitation as a form of loyalty ; and 
at once the object of imitation appears in its completeness 
as neither idea nor movement, but rather as other self or as 
social group. Active imitation consists, indeed, in a con- 
scious attempt to make oneself into this fascinating person- 
ality or to become one of this attractive circle. So the child 
imitates his father’s stride, because it is his father’s, not from 
any intrinsic interest in the movement in itself, and is a fierce 
Jingo because his father sides with the imperialists, not 
because he himself inclines toward these principles rather 
than toward others. The life of the child shows most 
clearly, indeed, the intensely personal nature of imitation. 
The development of his own personality is, as Royce has 
taught, t by the successive assumption of other people’s per- 
sonality. Now, he imitates, or throws himself into, the life 
of the explorer; he harnesses his cocker spaniel to an Arctic 
sledge made of an overturned chair, and he reaches the

-P-A-G-E-278
  254 A First Book in Psychology 
North Pole ahead of either Cook or Peary. A little later, 
his ideals are incarnated in the persons of military heroes: 
you will find him gallantly defending the pass at Thermopyle 
behind a breastwork of pillows, or sailing out to meet the 
Spanish Armada on a precarious ship of tables; he adopts 
a military step, organizes his companions into a regiment, 
attempts military music on his toy trumpet, cultivates in 
himself, and demands from others, the military virtues of 
obedience and courage. And in all this he is primarily 
imitating people, and is imitating specific acts and ideals, 
only as they are characteristic of these people. 
One need not turn, indeed, to the life of childhood for 
illustration of the fundamentally personal nature of imita- 
tion. For there ‘surely are few adults whose aims are not 
embodied in human beings. Whether one’s ideal is that 
of the student, the physician, or the diplomat, it stands 
out before one most clearly in the figure of some daring and 
patient scholar, some learned and sympathetic physician, 
some diplomat with insight and training. One’s effort is 
often explicitly, and almost always implicitly, to be like this 
ideal self, to realize in oneself his outlook and his achieve- 
ments; and one is consciously satisfied with oneself when 
one has completed an investigation, made a diagnosis, or 
negotiated a treaty as this ideal self might have done it. 
The moral life, perhaps, offers the most frequent illustration 
of the personal character of imitation. Our ethical ideals 
live in the person of some great teacher, and our moral 
life is a conscious effort to be like him; our aims, also, are 
set before us as a supreme personal ideal, and we are bidden 
to “be perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect.” 
Contrasted with imitation, and of codrdinate social sig-
-P-A-G-E-279

nificance, are opposition, the negation of other selves through 
mere assertion of difference from them; and invention, the 
constructive expression of this difference through the crea- 
tion of fresh combinations and new ideals. Unquestion- 
ably this tendency has been underrated, in consequence of 
the almost exclusive interest of the sociologists in the func- 
tion of imitation. Yet in all save the most servile forms of 
the social consciousness there occurs alongside of the impulse 
to follow one’s neighbors the instinct to show oneself unlike 
them, or —as the impulse is sometimes formulated — to 
show one’s own individuality. We are most likely, of course, 
to find opposition ‘writ large’ in the actions of children. 
But the mischief of a child which prompts him quite wilfully 
to say ‘dog’ or ‘cow’ when he knows well that he has spelled 
c-a-t, to run when he is expected to walk sedately, and to 
talk when silence is demanded, is merely a more obvious 
expression of the opposition instinct, which lies at the basis 
of all eccentricity in dress, repartee in conversation, and in- 
ventiveness in science or in art. Throughout these varying 
manifestations we may descry the tendency to be different, to 
attain what Royce calls the ‘contrast effect,’ quite for its own 
sake and sometimes without effort to influence other people. 
The inventor who intends to be imitated, who produces 
his novel results with specific design to be imitated, partakes 
of the character of the commander who sets up ideals and 
examples for others to follow or — more accurately — sets 
himself up to be followed. Similarly, the obedient disciple 
is an imitator in the fullest sense of that word: his imitation 
is neither mechanical, nor emotionally impulsive, but con- 
sists rather in an active recognition and acceptance of com- 
mand. 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  256 A First Book in Psychology 
Up to this point, the transitions from one form to another 
of will and faith have been wavering and shadowy. But the 
line which divides command and obedience from aggression 
and self-sacrifice is sharply drawn. For command is devoid 
of violence and is unaccompanied by scorn and anger; and 
obedience may be unmixed with pain. The aggressors are 
“the beaked and taloned graspers of the world” ; whereas the 
commanders dominate and control, instead of attacking and 
despoiling. 
The hope of the world, however, is with the leaders, 
not with the commanders of men. Leadership is a fusion of 
will with loyalty, of self-assertion with comradeship. The 
leader shares the experiences of his followers. He is no 
general directing the battle from a distant position, but a 
captain storming the fort at the head of his men; he is no 
‘boss’ imperiously giving orders, but a fellow-worker as well 
as a guide. The distinction is one of crucial importance to 
society. Doubtless the great commanders, the Cesars, the 
Napoleons, and the Bismarcks, have played a great réle in 
the drama of the world’s history — have determined the fate 
of nations and diverted the current of events. But the 
work of moulding permanent character, developing individu- 
ality, raising the level of civilization has been begun and 
remains to be done not by the commanders but by the 
leaders. For many centuries the great teachers have real- 
ized this and, like Socrates, have treated their followers not 
as disciples but as companions, or, like Jesus, have known 
them not as servants but as friends. But in political and 
in industrial life we are still in the grasp of the conception 
of society as constituted of masters and servants. When 
the great masters have learned to be leaders of men,
-P-A-G-E-281
  Faith and Will as Social Attitudes 257 
the next step in our social enfranchisement will have 
been taken. eo 
We have so far considered will and faith in their different 
phases as distinct social attitudes. But it must already have 
appeared that both — the dominating assertiveness of will 
and the adoptive assertiveness of faith or loyalty — are 
essential aspects of any complete self. In other words, a 
normal self both obeys and commands, and every fully social 
individual assumes the dominating, inventive attitude as 
well as the imitating, acknowledging position. Imitation 
and invention are never separate in the sense that some 
people and some achievements are imitative and others in- 
ventive. The truth is that every normal person unites in 
- himself, in varying proportions, these two fundamental 
tendencies of consciousness. Nobody could be absolutely 
original, if that means unimitative; and conversely, one 
could hardly be a self without some trace of opposition to 
one’s environment. Thus, the most daring inventor makes 
use of the old principle, and the most original writer is imi- 
tative, at least to the extent of using language. On the 
other hand, few copies are so servile that they are utterly 
undistinguishable from the model. 
The intimate union of the two tendencies is shown, also, 
by the fact that the usual road to inventiveness is through 
imitation. In truth, any honest effort to imitate intelli- 
gently must result in transformation rather than in mechani- 
cal copying. The healthy mind simply cannot follow copy 
without the spontaneous and unexpected occurrence of 
suggestions for change — of hot air instead of steam, an iam- 
bic metre in place of a trochaic, burnt umber rather than

sienna, or zinc solution in place of chloride. It matters not 
whether we work at machinery, at poetry, at painting, or at 
chemistry: we all become inventive by trying to imitate. 
A curious, yet common, result of this relation is the in- 
ventor’s inability to realize the extent of the changes 
which he brings about. Fichte, for example, supposed 
that he was merely expounding Kant, until Kant dis- 
claimed the exposition and stamped Fichte’s doctrine as 
an injurious and heretical system of thought. 
Not only is it true that invention is always by way of imi- 
tation. It is also certain that the practically successful, that 
is, the permanent innovation, is the one which can readily be 
imitated. The inventor of machinery so complicated that 
the common man can not use it will not succeed in introduc- 
ing his machines, and the promulgator of doctrine so pro- 
found that few men can apprehend it will not greatly in- 
fluence contemporary thought. This is the reason why the 
most original thinkers are so seldom leaders of their own 
age; why, for example, the teachings of Socrates, of Jesus, of 
Galileo, and of Spinoza exerted so little influence on con- 
temporary thought. On the other hand, the brilliantly suc- 
cessful man almost always has that highest grade of common- 
place mind which strikes out nothing essentially new, but 
which is yet keenly susceptible to most suggestions, selecting 
from these, with unerring good judgment, the readily imi- 
tablefeatures. ‘Too original a thought is,” as Baldwin says, 
“a social sport.” Neither Rousseau nor the French Revolu- 
tion, he points out,* could make a democracy of France; for 
centuries under absolute rule had unfitted the French to imi- 
tate and to adopt ideals of Liberté, égalité, fraternité. For a

  Faith and Will as Social Attitudes 259 
like reason, Constantine could not christianize his legions by 
baptizing them; and indeed nobody ever yet foisted on a 
group of people any ideal which they were unprepared to 
imitate. 
Not only invention and imitativeness but will and faith 
at every stage are united, though in varying proportions, in 
every normal self. Most of us, unhappily, are prone to 
overestimate the significance of will. Like the little 
boys in their play-regiments, we all want to be officers, and 
we extol leadership at the expense of loyalty. But self- 
assertion, though it deepens, cannot-widen, my self-realiza- 
tion; imperiousness and domination may be relatively ex- 
ternal attitudes toward my environment. Only if I adopt 
and espouse and take into myself the aims and ideals of 
other selves do I make of myself what I may be. Even 
more obviously, I inflict irreparable wrong on my fellow if 
I imperil his individuality by subduing his will to mine, by 
imposing my personality upon him; and I fail of the con- 
tribution to the social good of which I am capable, if I do 
not follow where others lead and espouse causes which I 
have not initiated. It isa commonplace of every-day ethics 
that only those who have learned to obey know how to lead, 
and the study of the lives of the really great leaders makes 
this clear. Only the second-rate commanders are sticklers 
for recognition. ‘I will hold his horse for him if he will win 
me a battle,” Lincoln exclaims of one of his generals. 
Itis equally one-sided, though perhapsnot equally common, 
to follow where one ought to lead, to imitate where one ought 
to initiate, to obey where one should take command. The 
truth is that both will and faith, both self-assertion and loyal 
acknowledgment, are essential factors of the complete life.

CHAPTER XIV 
THE RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS 
I. TypicaL PERSONAL RELATIONS 
From the conception of psychology as science of myself in 
relation to my environment, personal and impersonal, it fol- 
lows that every concrete personal relation may be the basis of 
a psychological study. My relation to this friend and to that, 
to brother or father or wife or child, to my employer or to 
my servant — every one, indeed, of the relations, in which my 
life consists, may be reflected on, analyzed, and explained after 
this manner of the psychologist. The truth is, however, that 
a very healthy instinct prevents us, ordinarily, from this sort 
of analysis of our personal relations. We are too deeply 
absorbed, in living these relations, to reflect about them from 
the dispassionate scientist’s point of view. We hesitate, and 
rightly, to pluck out the heart of our own mysteries; we pre- 
fer to love and to have faith, to sympathize and to enjoy, to 
command and to yield, without rendering up to ourselves 
a balanced account of our attitude to other people. But 
though we rarely expose our personal relations to the dissect- 
ing knife of the psychologist, there is yet no reason why the 
text-book in psychology, in so far as it treats of the relations 
of selves, should not supply the lack of scientific analysis in 
our own lives, by furnishing us with a series of studies of 
typical, personal relations — studies, for example, of the filial, 
the fraternal, or the civic relation, or even more general studies, 
260
-P-A-G-E-285
  Typical Personal Relations 201 
after the fashion of Hegel’s analysis of typical moods of youth 
— the romantic, the Quixotic, and the Byronic. But there 
is a practical reason why the text-book on psychology does 
not, ordinarily, include such studies of typical and universal 
relations. The novel and the drama have already usurped 
this function of the psychological treatise, and just because 
their characters, however typical, are also particular and 
highly individual, therefore the psychology of novel or of 
drama is more absorbing and closer to life than that of any 
treatise. It follows that the novel has become, in some 
degree, the popular introduction to psychology. 
The novel or drama is, of course, a study in the psychol- 
ogy of personal relations only. With the enumeration of 
structural elements of consciousness and the assignment of 
each to a physiological condition, it is only incidentally con- 
cerned; but the complexity and richness of the relations 
of its dramatis persone are the very soul of it. The interest 
of a Shakespeare play does not centre in the scene — the 
witches’ heath or the field of Agincourt — nor in the rhythm 
and melody of the verses, but in the developing and con- 
trasting relations of the central figures to each other and to 
the lesser characters. Thus, the plays of which King Henry 
the Fifth is hero are a study of a youth of prominently active 
nature, in whom the emotions are undeveloped and unaccen- 
tuated. The love scene is sufficient proof of this: King Henry 
complains that he has “no genius in protestation,” and that he 
“cannot look greenly nor gasp out his eloquence,” but though 
he doubtless himself believes that he lacks only expression, the 
discrim‘nating reader realizes that he is not capable of deep 
emotion, and that even while he laughs and plays pranks with 
Frustaff, and makes love to Kate, he is never carried out of 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  262 A First Book in Psychology 
himself, never a prey to feeling; in a word, never in passive 
emotional relation to anybody, even to his sweetheart. Al- 
ways, therefore, on the battle-field or in the court of love, he 
is the plain soldier, actively and imperiously related to men, 
whether he hand them their death-warrants or give them his 
gloves as favors, whether he boast of his army’s prowess or 
hearten his soldiers in their discouragement. 
But though, for the most part, we are content to leave in 
the hands of dramatist and of novelist the treatment of 
concrete personal relations, there is one such relation so 
universal, so significant, and so often misapprehended, that 
we shall here consider it. This is the relation of human to 
divine self. 
II. THE REticious CONSCIOUSNESS 
The study of religion may be undertaken from several 
points of view. One may study the history of religions, 
tracing the development of one from another and taking 
note of the place of religion in the life of different peoples; 
or one may study the philosophy of religion, assigning to its 
objects a place in the whole universe of reality. Funda- 
mental, however, both to the history and to the philosophy 
of religion is the psychological study of the religious con- 
sciousness. Such astudy must begin, like every psychological 
investigation, by a study of my own consciousness, but will 
be supplemented by reference to historical records of reli- 
gious experience. Its specific starting-point must be some 
admitted definition of the religious consciousness. Many 
definitions may be found, but simplest and most adequate, 
in the opinion of the writer, is the conception of religion as 
the conscious relation of human self to divine being, chat
-P-A-G-E-287
  The Religious Consciousness 263 
is, to a being or beings regarded as greater than this human 
self, or than any of its fellows, and either conceived or 
treated as personal.? 
If there were space to argue in detail for this conception 
of the religious consciousness, one would first of all point 
out that it lies at the base of all historical forms of religion. 
As is well known, living beings and nature phenomena are 
the objects of the primitive religious consciousness. An- 
cestor-worship is the most important form of the worship 
of conscious beings ; fetichism and the worship of the heavenly 
bodies are the extreme forms of the nature religions. Now it 
is obvious that the worship of the dead warrior or patriarch, 
and indeed the worship of any person, or even of any ani- 
mal, living or dead, is a conscious relation of the worshipper 
to another self. But it seems, at first sight, as if the wor- 
ship of a nature phenomenon could not be in any sense a 
conscious relation to a greater self. A fetich is an insig- 
nificant object, a bit of bone or a twig or a pebble, not a 
living being; and sun, moon, air, and water, the gods of 
the nature religions, are inanimate beings. A closer study, 
however, shows that these objects, fetiches as well as sun 
and moon and stars, are worshipped, not for what they are, 
but because they are looked upon as embodiments of con- 
scious selves. No savage is so ignorant that he fears and 
reverences a bit of bone, as mere bone; he worships it be- 
cause he looks upon it as, in some mysterious way, the instru- 
ment or symbol of a powerful, though unseen, self or spirit. 
And no Aryan, we may be sure, ever bowed down before the 
sun, feeling that his god was a mere flaming, yellow ball. 
He worshipped the sun as a being apart from him and in- 
finitely greater than he, yet none the less a self, however 
 
-P-A-G-E-288

  vaguely conceived. Nature souls, in the words of Pfleiderer, 
a well-known historian of religion, “are originally nothing 
but the livingness and active power of the phenomena of 
nature, conceived after the analogy of animal and man as 
willing and feeling beings.” * 
If this were a book about religion, instead of being a book 
about psychology, it would go on to show that the systems 
which seem to diverge from this conception are no true 
exceptions. It would show, also, that the history of reli- 
gion chronicles, in a sort of pendular succession, a reaction 
of two motives, one upon the other. A given religion, while 
it must include both factors, emphasizes either the superior 
power of its gods or else their essential likeness to human 
beings. In the lower forms of animism, for example, there 
is little difference between god and worshipper; and the 
gods of the Hellenes, who live among men, feasting, plot- 
ting, making love, come perilously near to losing the divine 
attribute of power. The higher nature-deities, on the other 
hand, are revered as immeasurably greater than human 
beings. 
The history of religious rite offers another proof of the * 
personal nature of the religious consciousness. ‘‘To speak 
boldly,” Clement of Alexandria says, “prayer is conversa- 
tion with God.” + In similar fashion, Tylor defines prayer 
as “the address of personal spirit to personal spirit.” tf The 
prayer, often quoted, of the Samoyed woman on the steppes 
shows very clearly how simple may be this communication 
of the human with the divine. In the morning, bowing

down before the sun, she said only, ‘When thou risest, I The Religious Consciousness 265 
too rise from my bed,’ and in the evening she said, ‘When 
thou sinkest down, I too get me to rest.’* Here we have 
neither petition, confession, nor explicit adoration, but mere 
intercourse, that is, acknowledgment of common experience. 
Prayer may be, indeed, a mere request for material good like 
the Gold Coast negro’s prayer, “God give me rice and 
yams, gold and agries, give me slaves, riches, and health,” * 
or it may be a prayer for forgiveness, like the Aryan’s cry, 
“Through want of strength, thou strong and bright God, 
have I gone wrong; have mercy, almighty, have mercy;” f 
but whatever its form, prayer, like sacrifice, is always the 
communion of the human with the more-than-human spirit. 
This introductory reference to the history of religions 
and of religious rites prepares us for our specific problem, 
the nature of the religious consciousness. ‘The conception 
which we have gained enables us, in the first place, tt to limit 
the essentials of the religious experience. Ritual and cere- 
monial, theories of heaven and hell, and even hopes of im- 
mortality, are religious only in so far as they grow out of 
the consciousness of God or grow up into it; in the realiza- 
tion and immediate acquaintance with God, the religious 
experience has its centre and its circumference. We shall 
gain a truer understanding, therefore, of the religious con- 
sciousness, if we do not regard it as an experience radically 
different from the other personal relations of our lives. For 
if God be just a greater self, then one’s attitude toward him”

cannot be utterly unlike one’s attitude toward a powerful 
human friend or chief. In our study of the religious con- 
sciousness, we must thus be guided throughout by the 
analogy of human relationships. 
Now human beings are, first of all, liked or disliked, 
feared or thanked, loved or hated, and in the same way the 
religious experience is always, certainly in part, emotional. 
At its lowest emotional terms, it includes at least the feeling 
of the dependence of the human on the divine. But ordi- 
narily the religious experience is far richer in emotion, and 
there is, indeed, no significant phase of human feeling 
which may not as well characterize the relation of man to 
God as that of man to man. Abject fear, profound grati- 
tude, bitter hatred, or devoted love may be factors of the 
religious experience. The savage, who bribes his gods 
through fear of them, and the rebels who cry out, “All we 
are against thee, against thee, O God most high,” are as 
truly religious in their emotion as the humblest and most 
self-forgetful worshippers. 
We have found, however, in our analysis of personal 
relations, that there is an active as well as a passive atti- 
tude to other selves, a relation of faith or will, as well as 
an emotional relation of fear or reverence. This active 
, acknowledgment of loyalty or faith is the second charac- 
teristic phase of religious experience. It may be touched 
by emotion, yet it is sometimes an utterly unemotional 
acknowledgment of the divine self, a submission to what 
one conceives to be his will, an adoption of what one looks 
upon as his ideal, a resolute loyalty unlighted by emotions 
supported only by a sober and perhaps rather dreary con- 
viction of duty. It may be questioned whether there is a
-P-A-G-E-291
  
The Religious Consciousness 267 
more heroic type of religious experience than just this cold 
adoption of what one conceives to be the right relation to 
God. 
We are thus brought, face to face, with the significant 
problem regarding the connection between the religious 
and the ethical experience. Our definition of religion, as 
relation of the human self to the divine, provides us with 
a standard by which to test the frequent claim that morality 
is religion. This claim is often strongly opposed on his- 
torical grounds. It is pointed out that primitive religions 
are full of positively immoral customs and rites, that the 
Borneans, for example, gain new spirits by head-hunting, 
and that the Oceanians have a god of thieving, to whom 
they offer a bit of their booty, bribing him to secrecy with 
such words as these: “Here is a bit of the pig; take it, good 
Hiero, and say nothing of it.” * Such an argument, how- 
ever, is inadequate, no matter how firmly established the’ 
facts on which it is based. For though Borneans and 
Oceanians and all other savage people perform acts, which 
we call wrong, as parts of their religious observance, it may 
be that they do not thereby violate their own moral codes. 
The opposition between religion and morality lies deeper. 
The religious experience is fundamentally a consciousness 
of God or of gods, a realized relation of the worshipper to 
a spirit or to spirits who are greater than he and greater 
also than his fellow-men. The moral consciousness, on the 
other hand, is, as has appeared, a form of the social con- 
sciousness, a man’s recognition of his place in the whole 
interrelated organism of human beings. Now, just as any 
human relation is incomplete and unworthy, if it lacks the 
* Cf. Ratzel, “History of Mankind,” Vol. I., p. 304.  
-P-A-G-E-292
  268 A First Book in Psychology 
moral experience, the consciousness, in some sense, of obli- 
gation toward another self, so the religious consciousness is 
superficial, unhealthy, and fragmentary, if it does not include 
the acknowledgment of duty toward God. But though reli- 
gion without morality is ethically degrading, it is none the 
less religion. Any conscious relation to God, however low 
and lifeless, however destitute of moral responsibility, is 
religion; and no morality, however sublime, no life, how- 
ever noble, is religious, if it lack this conscious relation to 
God. It follows, of course, that a bad man may be reli- 
gious and that a good man may lack the consciousness of 
his relation to God. Undoubtedly, therefore, certain ethical 
systems are better and safer guides than certain religious 
creeds. Religion, however, is not and cannot be morality, 
simply because religion is, and morality is not, a conscious 
relation of human self to the divine. 
The esthetic, almost as frequently as the moral, experi- 
ence is mistaken for religion. The profound emotion, with 
which one falls upon one’s knees with the throng of wor- 
shippers in a great cathedral, is named religious awe, though 
it is quite as likely to be what Du Maurier calls mere ‘sen- 
suous attendrissement.’ The stately proportions of nave and 
transept, the severe beauty of pillar and arch, the rich color- 
ing of stained glass, the thrilling sounds of the organ, and 
the heavy odor of the incense may hold one’s whole soul 
enthralled, and leave no room for the realization of any 
personal attitude to a God who is in or behind all this 
beauty. In the same way, the absorbed study of nature 
beauty is a self-forgetful, but not, for that reason, a religious, 
experience. 
This teaching, it must be admitted, is in opposition to the
-P-A-G-E-293
    The Religious Consciousness 
endency to class experiences as religious if they 
, teal directly with material needs and conditions. 
‘Svery breadth and comprehensiveness of these con- 
make them, in the writer’s opinion, valueless. It 
\ d true that the religious, the ethical, and the esthetic 
consciousness are alike, in that they are, in a greater or less 
degree, altruistic rather than merely egoisti¢ experiences. It 
is, however, misleading to confuse relations which, though 
similar in one respect, are none the less sharply distinguished. 
Our study of the religious experience has not yet even . 
named what is ordinarily accounted its most important fac- 
tor: the conviction of God’s reality, or — as it is commonly 
called — belief. The truth is that belief, in this sense, is 
not a part of any personal experience, that is, of any rela- 
tion of one self with another. We are not occupied, in our 
personal relationships, with reflections upon one another’s 
reality: we merely like or dislike each other, and are loyal 
or imperious. We may, to be sure, be conscious of the 
reality of God and of our human fellows, but this reflection 
upon reality is usually a phase of the philosophical con- 
sciousness, and not even an ingredient of the religious ex- 
perience. Certainly, a bare conviction of the actual exist- 
ence of another self, human or divine, by whom one does 
not feel oneself affected, to whom one is utterly unrelated, 
is not a personal experience at all. A belief of the reality of 
the deposed Turkish Sultan, Abdul Hamid, is no personal 
relation with him; and the mere persuasion that there 
exists a Supreme Being does not constitute a religious ex- 
perience. 
But though the conviction of reality does not enter into 
the immediateness of the personal experience, it is evident     
 
-P-A-G-E-294
270 A First Book in Psychology 
  that no relationship with God is possible to one vw 
tinctly convinced that there is no God. Some deg: 
the conviction of God’s reality must, therefore, form \. 
background of every religious experience, except the primi- 
tive personal relation in which one neither questions nor 
believes.* But this sense of God’s reality has unsuspected 
gradations of assurance, lying between the extremes of 
doubt and reasoned conviction. The consciousness of 
God’s reality may attain the completeness of philosophical 
dogma, but it may, on the other hand, be incomplete and 
illogical; it may be firmly held or it may be feeble and 
vacillating. For the truth is, as we have seen, that this 
consciousness of reality is, at most, a secondary and unem- 
phasized part of religious experience; and religion is, as we 
cannot too often repeat, a relation with God, like our rela- 
tions with our fellow-men. In Fichte’s words: “Herein reli- 
gion doth consist, that man in his own person and not in 
that of another, with his own spiritual eye and not through 
that of another, should immediately behold, have, and 
possess God.”

SECTION I* 
I. THe Conception oF PsycHOLoGY AS SCIENCE OF RELATED 
SELVES CONTRASTED WITH OTHER CONCEPTIONS 
a@. PSYCHOLOGY AS SCIENCE OF IDEAS 
§ 1. Psychology, as we have studied it, is the science of self in 
relation to environment. This conception must be compared 
with two others widely held. According to the first of these, 
psychology studies not the self but the succession of ideas (so-called 
mental processes) one upon the other, each as belonging to a 
definite moment. From this point of view, the psychologist is 
concerned not with the self as perceiving, but with the percept; not 
with the self as willing, or in assertive relation to other self or thing, 
but with the volition — in a word, not with the self as conscious of 
objects, but with consciousness regarded impersonally without 
reference to any self. 
In the opinion of the writer of this book, this conception of psy- 
chology is self-consistent and possible. In other words, con- 
sciousness may be treated, scientifically, as series of ideas; and 
percepts, images, thoughts, and the rest may be analyzed, classified, 
and explained by reference to parallel physical and physiological 
phenomena. But there are two conclusive objections to such a 
procedure. In the first place, it arbitrarily neglects a part of our 
immediate consciousness, and, in the second place, it offers an

sections, indicated by Arabic numerals; and indices from each chapter of

Appendix comments. 
T 273

274 Supplement to Chapter I: [Pages 
inadequate description of consciousness. To begin with the 
first of. these criticisms: on this view, psychology is science of 
ideas. But I cannot be conscious of an idea except as idea of a 
self; implicitly, if not explicitly, I am always conscious of a self, as 
having the idea or experience. If, therefore, I define psychology 
as science of ideas, I raise the inevitable question: ‘‘whose idea?” 
and then refuse arbitrarily to answer the question. 
Idea-psychology, in the second place, though it unquestionably 
offers a scientific treatment of consciousness, does not adequately 
describe the different forms of human experience. The character- 
istic methods which it shares with all forms of psychology are, 
(x) structural analysis and (2) classification and explanation* by 
reference to regularly preceding, accompanying, and following 
physical and physiological conditions. But our study of psy- 
chology has surely shown that perception and recognition and 
thought, and, more obviously but no more truly, emotion, will, 
and faith, are incompletely described when analyzed into merely 
structural elements and referred to bodily conditions. Perception 
is, indeed, indistinguishable from imagination except as it is re- 
garded as a shareable and not a private experience; emotion is 
not merely pleasant or unpleasant: it is an individualizing and a 
receptive experience. For both the reasons which have been 
named, the conception of psychology, as science of ideas, must 
be rejected as an unsatisfactory programme for the psychologist. 
b. PSYCHOLOGY AS SCIENCE OF MENTAL FUNCTIONS 
A second contemporary conception of psychology is as science 
of mental functions, or functional psychology. This doctrine is 
not so clearly cut nor so precisely formulated as that of idea- 
psychology, for the word ‘function’ is used with different shades of 
meaning by different writers of this group. Common to all ‘func- 
tional’ theories is the conception of function as activity; but — 
partly, no doubt, because of the indefiniteness of this term ‘activity’ 
* On the sense of explanation in psychology, see a paper by the writer, 
Journal of Philosophy, 1908, V., pp. 16 ff.
-P-A-G-E-299
  3-6] Appendix, Section I., §r 275 
— many functional psychologists define it more precisely as re- 
action directed toward environment; and often proceed to describe 
the reaction as biologically useful.* 
To this, as a complete conception of psychology, there is an objec- 
tion exactly parallel to the first of those advanced against idea- 
psychology. A function, whether defined merely as activity or as 
useful reaction to environment, is the function of a functioner; 
and there is no activity which is not the activity of an actor. 
Therefore, I simply cannot study mental functions without at 
the same time studying the functioning self. For just as the study 
of ideas raises the unavoidable question, “whose idea?” so the 
consideration of mental functions directly involves the question: 
“functions of whom?” To define psychology as science of mental 
functions without referring the functions to the functioning self, is, 
therefore, an entirely artificial proceeding. 
More closely scrutinized, functional psychology turns out, in 
the second place, to be either a synonym for self-psychology or 
else, once more, only a partial psychology. If the term ‘function’ 
be taken with the meaning ‘reaction to environment,’ and if the 
environment be then described, in Professor Angell’s words, as 
‘social’ and not merely ‘ physical,’ it must follow that a ‘func- 
tion’ is a social relation, — in other words, a personal attitude. If, 
on the other hand, the term ‘function’ be taken in a strictly bio- 
logical sense, then the account of different sorts of conscious- 
ness as different reactions to environment, — as adaptations or 
variations, as self-preservations or propagations, — these ac- 
counts will explain and classify psychic phenomena, but will in no 
sense describe them psychologically. ‘To call fear, for example, an 
instinctive, self-preservative reaction of withdrawal, classifies and 
(in a way) explains the emotion: of fear, but no more describes it 
than the statement, “a Watteau painted fire screen protects from 
the heat of the fire’ describes the Watteau figures. The classi- 
fication of a psychological experience as biologically useful is both 
correct and significant, but so far from fulfilling the requirements

    276 Supplement to Chapter I. [Pages 
of psychological analysis, it is not psychological description at all. 
Such description is, indeed, impossible without the study of a self, 
in personal relation, emphasized or unemphasized, receptive or 
assertive, egoistic or altruistic, to an environment which is personal 
as well as biological. 
¢. CONSIDERATIONS IN FAVOR OF SELF-PSYCHOLOGY 
1. Answers to Objections 
The discovery that many psychologists oppose or ignore this 
conception of psychology, as science of self, obliges us to marshal 
the arguments for the theory. We may profitably begin by con- 
sidering the objections which have been urged against it. These 
are chiefly three. It is objected, in the first place, that the con- 
ception of self, however justified, is a philosophical rather than 
ascientific conception. This objection is, perhaps, too technical 
to be discussed here in detail. Those, however, who believe with 
the writer, that any fact open to everyday observation — a stone, 
a word, a manceuvre — may be scientifically studied will see no 
difficulty in the conception of a scientific study of facts so univer- 
sally admitted to exist as selves. 
/One form which this objection takes must, however, be opposed 
with energy. Briefly stated, it consists first in identifying the self 
of psychology with some philosophical conception of self and then 
in arguing, rightly enough, that the philosophical conception is out 
of place in psychology. But between the philosophical and the 
psychological conception of the self there is a well-marked distinc- 
tion. The psychologist does not ask whether or not the self is 
material or immaterial, inherently worthy or worthless, endless or 
finite. By self (or subject, ego, mind, soul) the psychologist may 
mean much less than the philosopher means. Certain characters 
of the soul as conceived by medizval and modern philosophy are 
entirely excluded from the psychologist’s self. Obviously, there- 
fore, the self cannot be drummed out of the psychologist’s camp 
by arguments directed against one form or another of the philo- 
‘ sophical conception.

A second objection to the doctrine of self as set forth in this book 
is brought forward by some of the functional psychologists. This 
conception of the self is, they urge, too exclusively psychological. 
We know no disembodied selves, and the psychologist should 
therefore study the mind in the body. Or, as this theory is some- 
times stated, the unit or basal conception of psychology is the 
psychophysical organism, the unity of mind and body. To this 
objection the following reply. may be made: Unquestionably, the 
self whom, as psychologists, we study, is a self in close relation 
to a body; and the study of the physical conditions and of the 
bodily reactions accompanying consciousness is of great impor- 
tance. But there is no complete ‘unity of mind and body.’ Even 
the advocates of this theory are obliged to distinguish between 
purely physiological functions, such as digestion and circulation, 
and purely psychical, or conscious, functions. By this distinction 
they implicitly refer the physiological functions to the physiological 
organism, the body, and the psychical functions to a conscious 
functioner, the self.* Psychology may well treat this conscious 
functioner as its peculiar subject-matter. 
A final objection is urged against self-psychology (and, for that 
matter, against functional psychology) by the idea-psychologists. 
These claim that the structural analysis into elements — sensa- 
tional, affective, and the like — is possible only if consciousness be 
conceived as stream of ideas. [f this objection were well-founded, 
it would be decisive; for it is evident that perception, for example, 
is sensational; that emotion is affective — in a word, that con- 
sciousness is incompletely described without the structural analysis 
into elements. But the self-psychologist rightly denies the prem- 
iss of this argument. One can as well analyze ‘my perceiving’ 
as ‘a percept’ into sensational elements; one can as well reduce 
‘my fear’ as ‘a fear’ to elements among which unpleasantness 
and organic sensations are prominent.

2. Positive Considerations 
The answer to objections is an insufficient basis for any theory. 
The doctrine of psychology as science of self has, however, a more 
independent foundation — the testimony of introspection. Because 
I am directly conscious of a unique, a relatively persisting self in 
relation to its environment, therefore I assert the existence of a self 
and scientifically study its constituents and relations. 
It follows that the self-psychologist has no way of answering an 
opponent who asserts, ‘‘I have no consciousness of self.” In 
other words, psychology as science of selves can be studied only by 
one who believes, or assumes, that he is directly conscious of him- 
self. But even to an opponent who denies the fact from which he 
starts, the self-psychologist can at least show the plausibility or 
respectability of his position by pointing out, first, that some or all 
of those who deny the existence of a self-for-psychology implicitly 
assume the existence of such a self; and second, that many psy- 
chologists of admitted worth explicitly adopt the conception. 
To substantiate the first of these statements, one has only to 
tead the books of the idea-psychologists and to notice how con- 
stantly they describe and define consciousness in terms of the self, 
or I. Professor Ebbinghaus, for example, though he describes 
the soul as “nothing save (nichts ausser) the totality” of mental 
contents, none the less says that the soul is ‘‘a being,” that it “has 
thoughts, sensations, wishes, is attentive or inattentive, remembers 
(erinnert sich), etc.”* And Dr. Witasek, though he teaches that 
“we (1!) find in our consciousness only ideas, feelings, etc., and not 
something else besides which should be fundamental to them,” 
yet says unequivocally: ‘‘Psychic facts belong to individuals: 
a feeling, for example, is either mine or somebody else’s.” + 
The idea-psychologist has, it is true, two answers to this charge 
of making implicit use of the conception of self. In the first place, 
he urges that he means by ‘self,’ as he uses the term, merely my

body — either my physical organism as a whole or my nervous system 
in particular. But in this case he should regard the body, not the 
mind, as the real object of psychology; and this is foreign to the 
point of view of idea-psychology. Again, the opponent of self-psy- 
chology justifies his use of its words by the observation that, provided 
he define his terms, he has a right to employ everyday lauguage 
in a technical sense. If, then, he define ‘mind’ as ‘sum-total of 
ideas,’ and ‘self’ or ‘I’ as ‘human body,’ he may say “‘I fear,” and 
should be understood to mean: ‘A process occurs which is re- 
ferred to the human body, and is analyzable into unpleasantness 
and organic sensations.” The conventional expression, ‘I,’ he 
holds, no more binds the user to the obvious everyday meaning 
of it than the remark “‘the sun has set” marks an advocate of the 
Ptolemaic theory of astronomy. One may reply to this argument 
by carrying the illustration further. Surely, no Copernican, 
particularly in the days when the doctrine was still in dispute, 
would have claimed the right to describe astronomical phenomena 
in terms of the Ptolemaic theory. Similarly, the opponent of self- 
psychology should describe the phenomena of consciousness with- 
out use of a term which, to say the least, predisposes his reader to 
substitute for the conception of self as body, and of mind as sum 
of ideas, the conception, explicitly denied, of conscious self in 
relation to environment. The self-psychologist has then some 
right to urge that idea-psychologists are implicitly assuming or 
leading their readers to assume the existence of a self, when they 
describe consciousness in such words as “I attend to a color,” 
“T perceive objects’; and still more when they mark off certain 
experiences as peculiarly personal; that is, as especially related to 
myself. 
In addition to these challenged implications of self, many un- 
compromising assertions that psychology is science of the self may 
be found in the writings of contemporary psychologists, though 
they often substitute, for the word ‘self,’ some one of the expressions, 
subject, ego, mind, or even soul. Thus, Professor Ward defines the 
standpoint of psychology as that ‘of the living subject in intercourse 
with his special environment.’ And Professor Judd says ex-
-P-A-G-E-304
  280 Supplement to Chapter I. [Pages 
plicitly, ‘Psychology deals with the self.” Other supporters of 
self-psychology, and its critics as well, are cited in the bibliography 
at the close of this section. 
II. THE CoNCEPTION OF THE OBJECT IN PsycHOLOGY 
§ 2. The conception of object which this book sets forth is so 
likely to be misunderstood, that it will here be amplified. It 
should first be noted that the standpoint from which one speaks of 
objects of the self is, as James says, dualistic; but that it is psy- 
chologically, not ultimately, dualistic, so that the monist in phi- 
losophy may, as psychologist, unconcernedly adopt it. The basis of 
the conception is the fact that I always find myself conscious of an 
object: of myself or my experience, of other self or thing or 
relation. More fully stated: In being conscious, I am always 
conscious (even if vaguely conscious) of myself as related either to 
_an object or to that totality of objects which I call my environment. 
Psychology, if it is to take account of the self, must, therefore, take 
account of the object. Indeed, all psychologists, whether or not 
they purport to study the self, really describe and classify conscious- 
ness with reference to objects. They classify attention, for ex- 
ample, as sensational or intellectual, according as one attends to 
sensational or to unsensational objects; or they refer to color and 
to tone not only as sensations, but as existing outside eye or ear. 
This book follows Ward and James in the explicit recognition of 
the object of consciousness. In the words of the former: 
“Psychology deals with the subjective standpoint of individual 
experience, but we find that in this experience both subject and 
object are factors.” ** Or, to quote Professor Mitchell (who, how- 
ever, for ‘object’ uses the word ‘content’), ‘‘ When conscious, I am 
always conscious of a definite something or other; and this is 
called the content of my experience or consciousness.” + 
It is important to emphasize the wideness of application of the 
word ‘object,’ thus used, and expressly to repudiate certain incor-

rect uses of the term. The object of the psychological self may take 
one of several forms, and cannot therefore be forthwith identified 
with any one of them. These forms, already enumerated,* are the 
following: (1) public objects of many or all selves whether (a) 
personal (that is, other selves) or (6) impersonal, and in this case, 
either external physical objects, or non-external relations, laws, 
and the like; (2) private, or psychological, objects, either (a) 
myself, in relation to environment, or (b) my experiences. Our 
greatest danger is that of confusing the object, in the general and 
inclusive sense, with the public object — what Ward calls the 
epistemological object — and especially with the external object 
of the physical sciences. It is permissible, however, but only 
where no ambiguity thereby arises, to use the word ‘object’ in 
what was perhaps its primary meaning, as indicating the ‘ other- 
than-myself’ (that is, as including all forms of object except the 
private personal object), + and even to use the term, in either of 
the narrower senses, to mean ‘ public’ or ‘ external’ object. 
A common confusion of the object with one special form of 
external object must be avoided with particular care. By the 
object of the self or of consciousness is never meant the stimulus, 
physical or physiological, of consciousness. The two are, indeed, 
to be contrasted sharply. When the object of my consciousness is, 
for example, the theatre curtain, the physical stimuli are ether 
vibrations, and the physiological excitations are obscure processes in 
retina and in brain of which I need never have heard and which, at 
best, I infer and do not perceive. In a word, the physical and 
physiological stimuli of consciousness are the phenomena of phys- 
ical science, usually inferred, not perceived, whereas the object of 
consciousness is that of which I am conscious, without reference 
to which I cannot adequately describe my consciousness. 
It has been pointed out in Chapter I. that important questions 
are raised by the conception of the object of consciousness: a 
fundamental question about the identity of subject and object; a 
second question about the alleged externality of objects of percep-

tion; and, we may here add, a special problem about the precise 
nature of the objects of the relational consciousness. None of 
these questions, it must be reiterated, force themselves upon the 
psychologist so long as he holds steadily to his own business, 
the description and explanation of consciousness, regarded as the 
relation of self to environment. The psychologist, in other words, 
assumes, on the testimony of his direct consciousness, that a self 
related to object exists. By reflection, he distinguishes different 
attitudes of self and different forms of the object. The ultimate 
nature of both he leaves to the philosopher to discuss.

PERCEPTION AND IMAGINATION 
Note on the ‘reflective observation’ of perception and imagination 
(of. Chapter II., p. 12). The discussion of perception introduces the 
important distinction between an immediate consciousness and the 
reflective observation of such a consciousness. Reflective observation 
is the after-consciousness of an earlier experience, the psychologist’s 
awareness of an experience — his own or another’s. To say that I am 
immediately conscious of the characters or relations which only after- 
reflection attributes to my experience is to commit what James calls 
the psychologist’s fallacy. Yet, on the other hand, immediate and 
reflective observation may coincide. In any case, it is as allowable to 
classify an experience by taking account of the characters regularly 
attributed to it in after-reflection as to classify it by reference to 
physiological conditions.

A. Ture Human Bopy FrroM THE PsycHOLoGIst’s 
STANDPOINT 
§ 1. It is not the specific province of psychology to study the 
human body, yet the psychologist must possess an acquaintance 
with the structure and functions of the body in order to explain and 
to classify those facts about the conscious self which are the proper 
objects of his investigation. A formal definition of ‘the body’ need 
not here be attempted. It may be described first in its relation 
to myself; second, in comparison with other objects. From the 
first point of view, my body is an object of which I am sensationally 
conscious; it is the object of which I am most persistently con- 
scious; and it is, finally, a medium of relation between me and 
other external objects. From the second standpoint, — that is, in 
comparison with other objects, — the body is an organism, a sys- 
tematic complex of structures and activities such that each is sub- 
ordinated to the whole. 
The function of the body as, so to speak, mid-term between self 
and external things is due to two fundamental characters: it is 
readily affected by environing objects and, in turn, it easily affects 
them. Though it consist, as in the case of the protozoén, of a 
single cell, that cell affects, and is affected by, its environment. 
The ameeba, for example, moves aside from an obstacle, attaches 
itself to a solid body, and unites these forms of reaction by pro- 
jecting parts of its body and closing them over food.* 
But though all living cells are fundamentally alike in function, 
yet with the development of the animal body there goes on in the 
cells a progressive differentiation both in structure and in function. 
The changes of especial importance to the psychologist are the

following: Certain structures, known as sense-organs, situated for 
the most part on the bodily surfaces, become specially adapted to 
excitation by the environment; other organs, bones and muscles, 
take over the essential function of motor reaction to the environ- 
ment; and connecting the two (though histologically closely re- 
lated to the sense-organs) is the group of structures known as 
the nervous system. 
I, THE MOTOR STRUCTURES OF THE BODY 
§ 2. For the purposes of the psychologist it is sufficient merely 
to name the muscles, masses of contractile tissue, penetrated by 
blood-vessels, most of them ending in tendons, fibrous cords which 
are connected with the more than two hundred bones of the body. 
The bones, moving on each other at the joints, form a peculiarly 
flexible framework. 
Motions of internal organs—for example, heart-beat and 
movements of the alimentary canal — are the contractions of the 
muscles composing these organs. 
Il, THE CEREBRO-SPINAL NERVOUS SYSTEM 
§ 3. From this reference to the specifically motor and the defi- 
nitely sensory organs of the body, we turn to the closer study of 
the structure connecting the two. Rudimentary forms of such a 
connective system are found low in the biological scale, among the 
simpler (if not the simplest) of the metazoa. Beginning with the 
lowest of the vertebrates, we find the essential features of a cerebro- 
spinal nervous system — a central system of nerve-centres con- 
nected on the one hand with all the sensory surfaces and, on the 
other hand, directly connected with all the skeletal muscles, and 
indirectly connected with the internal organs. (Besides the 
cerebro-spinal nervous. system, the body contains both scattered 
‘sporadic ganglia,’ and a number of nerve-centres, loosely united, 
the so-called ‘sympathetic nerve system.’ These centres, which 
are partly ‘ self-directing,’ partly excited through the central ner- 
vous system, control the activity of the internal organs, digestive, 
respiratory, and circulatory.)

a. Nerve-elements: Neurones 
§ 4. The cerebro-spinal nervous system is made up of connected 
nerve-centres; and a nerve-centre is a tangled mass of neurones, 
or branching cells which are anatomically distinct. The structu- 
rally distinguishable parts of a typical neurone are the following: 
  Fic. 6. — Motor cell of gray matter of cord. From human fetus. The asterisk 
(*) marks the axone; the other branches are dendrites. From W. H. Howell,

(x) the cell-body, a bit of protoplasm containing a nucleus; and 
(2) nerve-processes, prolonged from the cell-body, of two sorts, (a) 
the dendrites, broad in their origin from the cell-body and devious 
in their course, which give off intricately branching, ‘ antler-like’ 
processes beginning near the cell-body, and (6) the axone, a nar- 
_ Yow fibre, usually direct in its course. . The axone is either a long

  288 Supplement to Chapter III. 
fibre, enclosed in an albuminous covering (the medullary sheath), 
giving off few branches until it breaks up into a bunch of fibres at 
the end, or it is a short fibre “breaking up in a dendritic manner into 
a large number of fine branches.” * As a whole, the neurone has 
been said to resemble ‘“‘a bit of string frayed out at both ends and 
here and there along its course.” 
Cell-bodies are embedded in a spongy substance, the neuroglia. 
Masses in which these cell-bodies predominate are called ganglia and 
are grayish in color, because the fibres which they contain are with- 
out medullary sheath. Masses in which nerve fibres predominate 
are called ‘nerves,’ and look white. The nerve impulse is 
conducted, in the human body, at the rate of approximately 33 
meters (100 feet) per second, by the nerve fibres; it spreads from 
the terminal fibres of the axone of one neurone to the contiguous 
dendrites — sometimes to the cell-body — of another. According 
to the direction in which the nerve impulse is conducted, nerves are 
distinguished as (1) afferent, or ingoing, nerves which convey in- 
ward the impulse communicated from some outer stimulus; and 
(2) efferent, or outgoing, nerves which convey the nerve excitation 
toa muscle. Midway between the two are found (3) the neurones 
of the nerve-centres of brain and spinal cord, whose function seems 
to be the redistribution, perhaps the modification, of the excitation 
conveyed by afferent nerves. Some psychologists hold that the 
function of redistribution belongs peculiarly to the cell-bodies. 
b. Nerve-centres 
1. The Spinal Cord 
§ 5. Aside from the sympathetic system, there are two main groups 
of nerve-centres; that is, of neurones massed together, those of spinal 
cord and of brain. The spinal cord, enclosed in its bony sheath 
of linked vertebree, contains fibres which run (1) inward from the 
surface of trunk and of limbs, (2) outward, and (3) up and down

Appendix, Section III., § 5 289 ° 
within the cord. The afferent (ingoing) fibres enter through the 
spinal ganglia, which lie inside the spinal column but outside the 
cord in the posterior nerve-roots. The efferent (outgoing) fibres 
are found in the anterior roots. Of the up-and-down fibres, 
some connect different levels of the 
cord, while others connect the cord 
with the brain. The outer por- 
tion of the cord is made up mainly 
of axones each in its medullary 
sheath; the inner portion consists 
chiefly of cell-bodies and of den- 
drites, but contains also axones 
with and without medullary 
sheaths. 
When an excitation is trans- 
mitted by an afferent nerve to the 
spinal cord, it may either be im- 
mediately redistributed by the 
spinal nerve-centres to an efferent 
nerve, or it may be transmitted 
along one of the upward fibres to 
a redistributing centre in the brain. 
The immediate spinal reaction is 
unaccompanied by consciousness,

response to stimulation of the skin, 
occur after such injury to the spinal cord as prevents transmission 
of excitation to the brain. The spinal cord is thus, first, a centre 
for unconscious reflex movements from cutaneous stimulation, 
and second, a transmitter of excitations to the brain. Many of 
the fibres running downward from the brain to the spinal cord 
cross from the right side of the brain to the left side of the cord 
(Figure 8); and consequently the stimulation of one side of the 
brain is followed by motion of the opposite side of the body.

necting them, as the diagram suggests, with the spinal centres and 
with the hemispheres. They therefore transmit to the hemi- 
spheres excitations origi- 
nated in lower portions of 
the body, and they are also 
centres for the redistribu- 
tion both of nervous im- 
pulses, transmitted by the 
spinal cord, and of excita- 
tions conducted to them 
directly by the facial nerves 
and by the nerves of the 
special senses. In one 
centre of the lower brain 
(the medulla) there are 
also automatic centres, 
masses of cells which coér- 
dinate excitations from the 
interior of the body and 
regulate such automatic 
movements as the heart-

spheres, also, are connected 
with each other by transverse neurones.) 
It is a moot question whether sense-consciousness accompanies 
the functioning of these lower and interior centres. The proba- 
bility,* however, is that in the case of the lower vertebrates, with 
less developed hemispheres, the excitation of lower and of interior 
brain is accompanied by consciousness, and that, on the contrary, 
excitation of the hemispheres is necessary to human conscious- 
ness. It is certain that excitation of the hemispheres is the es-

sential cerebral condition of memory and of foresight. The bodily 
movements characteristic of cerebral activity are, therefore, no 
longer the unconscious reflexes of the spinal cord nor even acts of 
which one has a bare sense-perception; they are deliberative acts 
performed with a memory of past results and an image of future 
happenings. It follows that the response to a particular stimulation 
is not, as in the case of a spinal reflex, inevitable and determined. 
We may illustrate this by a diagram (Figure 9). The unconscious 
spinal reflex (a-b-f-g), following upon the touch of a hot sur- 
face, is the withdrawal of the hand. Suppose, however, that the 
stimulus conducted by the afferent nerve (a-b-c) is transmitted to 
the hemispheres instead of being at once redistributed in the spinal 
centres. The centre (e), corresponding with the sensation of 
warmth, is first stimulated, but the impulse is at once transmitted 
to other brain-centres (y and x) and the total cortical excitation 
is accompanied by the conscious reflection that a hot application 
will cure neuralgic pain. The efferent nerve (d), which is finally 
stimulated, in turn excites a muscle whose contraction checks the 
instinctive movement away from the hot surface. Thus the motor 
response (d-h-i), to the excitation transmitted to the hemispheres, is 
a firmer grasp of the heated object, whereas the instinctive spinal 
teflex (a-b-f-g) would have consisted in the withdrawal of the hand.

and consciousness as associated with different nerve-centres: —

§ 7. It is possible to study, in even greater detail, the relation 
of the excitation of the cortex to different functions of con- 
sciousness. For this purpose, it is necessary to gain a clearer 
notion of the conformation of the hemispheres. It has been shown 
already that the immense expansion of each hemisphere results in a 
folding of its surface in upon itself. Each hemisphere thus con- 
sists of an irregular mass of folds, the convolutions, separated by 
deep gullies, the fissures. The most important of these appear

very early in the growth of each embryonic hemisphere, on its outer 
surface. They are the fissure of Sylvius, which starts from a point 
below and in front of the middle of each hemisphere (cf. Figure 9), 
and runs backward, curving upward at its termination; and the 
fissure of Rolando, which runs downward and forward, from the 
median, upper part of each hemisphere (Figure 9) to a point near 
to that where the fissure of Sylvius begins. These fissures and 
others form the basis of the ordinary division of the hemisphere 
into five areas, or lobes. Roughly speaking, the frontal lobe lies 
forward of the fissure of Rolando and above the fissure of Sylvius; 
the parietal lobe lies back of the frontal, and also above the fissure

of Sylvius; the occipital lobe lies behind the parietal, and is sepa- 
rated from it by a fissure which appears most definitely on the 
median side of the hemisphere; and the temporal lobe lies below 
the fissure of Sylvius and forward of the occipital lobe. (The 
fifth lobe, the ‘island of Reil,’ is folded in within the temporal and 
the parietal lobes, and is not represented in the diagram.) On the 
median surface of the hemisphere (cf. Figure 10), it is important 
to distinguish, first, the triangular area of the occipital lobe, called

from its wedge shape the cuneus; second, the convolution along 
the upper edge, called ‘marginal’; and finally, the curving con- 
volution, called the uncinate (or hippocampus). 
The study of cortical areas is important to the psychologist only 
for the following reason: investigation has shown that the excita- 
tion of certain parts of the cortex is accompanied by definite forms 
of sense-consciousness and of bodily movement. There is much 
dispute, among the anatomists, about special features of cere- 
bral localization, but the following results may be accepted as 
practically assured : —

  The area which lies forward of the fissure of Rolando is admitted 
to be a centre of bodily movements — of all movements of trunk 
and limbs, and of such movements of eyes, tongues, nostrils, and 
ears as are indirectly brought about by mechanical stimuli. Many 
psychologists believe that the Rolandic area is the centre also of 
cutaneous sensation; but Schafer, supported by some others, 
holds that the median gyrus fornicatus is the centre of cutaneous 
sensation and the direct centre of the movements initiated by 
cutaneous stimuli.* 
The centre of hearing is the first temporal convolution ; the corti- 
cal smell-centre, and possibly the taste-centre, are in the uncinate 
convolution of the median temporal lobe. These probably are 
centres also for such movements of ear, nostrils, and tongue as are 
directly due to stimulation of the end-organs of hearing, smell, and 
taste. The following summary of the sensory centres in the 
hemispheres combines these data: —

distinguished from a percept, not merely by the different degree 
and duration, but by the different locality of its cerebral excitation.

they may occur when merely association-centres, not the Sense-

centres, are excited,* whereas the sense-centres must, of course, 
be active in perception. James Ward bases a similar argument on 
the case of patients who are able to recall familiar objects, but 
totally unable to recognize them when they are seen. He con- 
cludes that the centres for percept and for image must differ, how- 
ever little, in locality.| But both these arguments are insufficient. 
The people who could recall and describe objects named to them 
may have had purely verbal images, and need not have visualized 
the objects at all. And every image, however ‘vague,’ contains 
sense-elements and must, therefore, be conditioned by the excitation 
of sense-centres.}f 
Ill. THE SENSE-ORGANS AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
OF SENSATION 
a. The Eye 
1. The Structure of the Eye 
§ 9. The lowest form, biologically, of end-organ sensitive to 
light stimulus is a pigment-spot on the skin of an animal as far 
down in the scale as the volvox, an organism midway between uni- 
cellular and multicellular animals.§ But there is nothing to show 
that the consciousness corresponding to these stimuli differs from 
that which follows on mechanical stimulation. Next in the scale 
of light-adapted organs is the faceted eye, found in some crustacea 
and in insects, familiar to us in the fly and in the bee. It consists 
in a large number of little cone-shaped organs, each of which trans- 
mits only the ray of light which passes directly through it; oblique 
rays are absorbed by the pigmented material with which these 
cones are surrounded. The result is a miniature ‘stippled,’ or 
mosaic, reproduction of the field of vision, since each of the thou- 
sand cones transmits light from one point only. A third type of 
eye, found also in insects, is the ocellus — a small eye, consisting

mainly of lens, retina, and rods, and of use, it is supposed, in dark- 
ness and for near objects. There is, finally, the true eye, with its 
lens and its retina, found in crustaceans and in most vertebrates. 
§ 10. The human eye has already been described, but in insuffi- 
cient detail. It is a sphere, moved, in a bony cavity of the skull, 
by six muscles — up- 
ward, obliquely up- 
ward and_ inward, 
downward, obliquely 
downward © and _out- 
ward, outward and in- 
ward. Its three mem- 
branous layers or 
‘coats’ are (1) the out- 
ermost sclerotic mem- 
brane (Sc/) completely 
covering the eyeball, 
whitish and opaque 
except in its forward 
part, the transparent 
cornea (c); (2) the 
choroid membrane

fibres, and color pig- 
ment, whose forward portion is the iris (J); (3) the retina (R) 
which surrounds the posterior three-fourths of the eyeball. These 
membranes enclose three transparent bodies: the aqueous humor, 
a very fluid substance behind the cornea; second, and most impor- 
tant to vision, the double-convex crystalline lens (Z), enclosed in 
an elastic capsule attached (by a circular ligament) to the choroid 
coat; and finally, the vitreous humor (VH) a jellylike substance, 
full of floating particles, which occupies more than two-thirds of 
the cavity of the eyeball and “gives it substance.” Together, 
aqueous humor, crystalline lens and vitreous humor form a 
double-convex lens.

The eye is adapted by three sorts of muscular adjustment, for 
reaction to objects at different distances: (1) Convergence and 
divergence are movements of the eyeballs, by the eye-muscles, 
which facilitate vision of near and far objects. When the eyeballs 
are parallel, clear images of indefinitely distant objects, for ex- 
ample of the stars, are formed. As the eyeballs converge more 
and more, that is, as the fronts of the eyeballs roll together and 
the backs roll apart, rays of light from every point of a nearer object 
are brought together at corresponding points on the retinz of both 
eyes, so that the two eyes act as one.* (2) Accommodation is a 
bodily process which changes the refractiveness of the lenses them- 
selves. Accommodation is due to the contraction of the ciliary 
muscle (C.P)., ‘a muscle lying in the forward part of the choroid 
coat, outside the iris, composed in small part of circular fibres 
parallel to the circumference’ of the iris and in large part of fibres 
radiating from this edge of the iris.” This muscle, contracting 
somewhat after the fashion in which a purse-string is pulled up, 
“draws the forward half of the choroid coat forward and inward, 
thus lessening the tension of the elastic capsule in which the crystal- 
line lens is swung, and allowing the lens to bulge from front to 
back.” ¢ (3) The third of these muscular adjustments is. the 
purely unconscious reflex movement by which the pupil, an opening 
in the iris of the eye, is enlarged or narrowed according to the 
distance of the object and the intensity’of the light. There are 
great differences in these reflexes. The pupils of night-seeing 
animals — owls, for example — dilate far more widely in the 
night than the pupils of human eyes, and contract, in daylight, to 
a mere slit. : 
To sum up the main features of this description: The diver- 
gent rays from each point of a relatively near object are (r) brought 
together on the fovew of both eyes by convergence; are (2) bent 
more sharply by the bulging of the crystalline lens through ac- 
commodation, and are (3) kept, by contraction of the pupil, from 
striking on the edges of the crystalline lens and producing chro- 
matic effects.

and the structure of this innermost coat of the eyeball must there- 
fore be described in slightly more detail. It is composed through- 
out most of its extent of ten layers; a layer of pigment cells (I); 
the layer (II) containing the minute transparent structures, rods 
and cones, which are the only parts of the retina directly affected by 
light; several interconnected layers of branching neurones; and 
the layer (X) formed by nerve-fibres ramifying in all directions from 
the optic nerve (O.N. in Figure 13). This nerve pierces the scle- 
rotic and choroid membranes from the rear; and the part of the 
‘retina at which it enters (displacing other retinal elements) is, as 
experiments show,* unaffected by the light. Outward from this 
‘blind spot,’ in the centre of a colored yellow spot (the macula 
lutea), there is a little pit or depression (the fovea, f.c.) in which 
the retina has thinned so that light more directly affects the cones, 
which here appear in unusual numbers with few or no rods among 
them. The retinal excitation is transmitted by the optic nerve, 
to the occipital lobe of the cortex; and the following fact, already 
mentioned, concerning the correspondence of retina to brain-cen- 
tres is important. When the branches of the optic nerve from 
right to left eyes meet (in what is called the optic chiasma), the 
fibres cross in such wise that fibres from the nasal side of the 
right retina and from the temporal side of the left retina are 
continued to the left brain hemisphere, whereas fibres from the 
temporal side of the right retina and from the nasal side of the left 
are continued to the right hemisphere. Thus, the two retine — 
including the macule, or places of clearest vision — are represented 
in both hemispheres. 
2. Phenomena and Theories of the Visual Consciousness 
(a) Color Theories 
§ 12. To this account of the structure of the eye must be added 
a brief statement of certain theories of retinal process which differ 
from the hypothesis adopted in Chapter III. It must be borne 
in mind that these color theories are, one and all, hypothetical

-P-A-G-E-326
    302 Supplement to Chapter III. [Pages 
descriptions of retinal processes which have so far eluded direct 
observation. Chronologically first is the theory independently for- 
mulated by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz. It 
holds that there are three retinal elements or processes whose 
excitation conditions three color sensations — red, green, and violet. 
It explains sensations of colorless light as due simply to the com- 
bination in equal degrees of these three color-processes. Evi- 
dently this is a possible explanation of the cases in which a 
mixture of ether-waves of all lengths conditions the consciousness 
of colorless light. The Young-Helmholtz theory also explains, 
in the following manner, the excitation of colorless light sensations 
through the mixture of only two color-stimuli: ether vibrations 
of a given rate tend to set up in the retina not only the processes 
specifically corresponding with them, but also those which cor- 
respond with other vibration numbers. So blue light excites 
the retinal process which conditions the sensation-quality green, 
as well as that which accompanies blue; and yellow light stimu- 
lates the processes for red as well as for green. Therefore the com- 
bination of two complementary color-stimuli produces the same 
effect, physiologically, as the combination of all the color-stimuli. 
The specific physical condition of the sensation-qualities of color- 
less light is thus such a mixture of ether-waves as will stimulate 
simultaneously and nearly equally all physiological color-processes. 
The conclusive objection, though not the only objection, to the 
Young-Helmholtz theory is the fact that it fails utterly to account 
for the four cases in which a sensation of colorless light follows 
upon a single color-stimulus. It is impossible to suppose that three 
color-processes are aroused when a single color-stimulus falls on 
the outer rim or on a small part of the retina, or when the color- 
stimulus is very faint. And, finally, the theory cannot possibly 
be reconciled with the facts of color-blindness. For in color- 
blindness one at least of the normal retinal processes. is wanting, 
and there can therefore be no combination of three retinal processes. 
A far more satisfactory explanation is that of Hering. He holds 
that a sensational consciousness of color is physiologically due to 
the activity of one of two antagonistic processes of an inferred
-P-A-G-E-327
  39-40] Appendix, Section III., § 12 303 
retinal substance. Of these substances, he believes that there are 
two, each capable of an anabolic, that is, assimilative or ‘building 
up’ process, and of a katabolic, that is, destructive or ‘tearing 
down’ process. ‘To these four processes correspond the sensations 
of red, yellow, green, blue, whose exact relation may be seen by 
the following summary : — 
SUBSTANCES PROCESSES SENSATIONS OF 
cs ee Green. ed-green. Katabolic. Red. 
Anabolic. Blue. Yellow-blue. { Katabolic. Yellow. 
So far Hering has explained simply our color sensations. To 
account for the colorless-light consciousness, he assumes another 
retinal substance with opposed processes: — 
SUBSTANCE PROCESSES SENSATIONS OF 
s Anabolic. Black. 
Whie-plags teratole White. 
An equilibrium between the two processes occasions a sensation 
of middle gray; and an unequal combination of the two processes 
excites sensations of light or dark gray. The white-black sub- 
stance is excited by every light-stimulus, and is more widely spread 
than the color-substances over the surface of the retina. 
With these presuppositions Hering explains as follows the vari- 
ous ways of exciting the consciousness of colorless light: When 
such consciousness is due to the combination of color-stimuli, 
antagonistic processes in the color-substances destroy each other 
by simultaneous action, and the white-black substance remains in 
activity. When, for example, blue and yellow light fall simultane- 
ously on the retina, the blue tends to set the blue-yellow substance 
into anabolic activity, whereas the yellow tends equally to stimu- 
late the katabolic activity of the blue-yellow substance. These 
opposite processes cancel each other; and so equilibrium is main- 
tained and the blue-yellow substance, equally stimulated in two
-P-A-G-E-328
  
  304 Supplement to Chapter ITI. [Pages 
opposite directions, remains inactive, whereas the white-black 
substance, as has been said, is always active. Excitation by white 
light, that is, excitation by ether-waves of all lengths amounts to 
excitation through the combination of two pairs of complementary 
color-stimuli, red and green, blue and yellow, and results therefore 
in the inactivity of both color-substances. 
In explanation of the colorless-light consciousness as conditioned 
by a single stimulus, Hering advances far beyond Helmholtz. He 
supposes (1) that sensations of colorless light arise when small 
extents of the retina are excited by a single color-stimulus, because 
the stimulation of such small extents of the red-green or of the 
blue-yellow substance is not sufficient to rouse it to activity, whereas 
the ever active white-black substance is excited even by a small 
amount of light; (2) that excitations in faint light are not intense 
enough to affect a color-substance, but do excite the sensitive white- 
black substance; (3) that stimulation of the retinal periphery by 
color-stimuli excites sensations of colorless light, because only the 
white-black substance is found on the outer zones of the retina. 
Hering teaches finally (4) that a color-stimulus excites a sensation 
of colorless light when the subject is color-blind, because the retina 
of a color-blind person lacks one or both color-substances so that 
the color-stimulus affects only the easily excited white-black sub- 
stance. Hering has certainly, therefore, furnished a plausible 
explanation for sensations of colorless light whether conditioned 
by a single stimulus or by a combination of stimuli. Grave ob- 
jections have, however, been brought against the Hering theory. 
The most important of them may be briefly stated: (x) It is 
highly improbable that an assimilative bodily process should con- 
dition consciousness. (2) It is inconsistent to suppose that 
opposite color-processes, simultaneously excited, balance each 
other, and result in an absence of color-consciousness, whereas the 
opposite processes of the black-white substance, if excited together, 
occasion the consciousness of gray.* (3) As a matter of fact, a 
* Accordingly contemporary upholders of the theory supplement it by 
G. E. Miiller’s hypothesis that the consciousness of gray is due to exclusively 
cerebral conditions. For criticism, cf. C. L. Franklin, of. cit. on p. 307; et al.

mixture of red and green lights occasions yellow not, as Hering 
implies, colorless-light sensation. On the contrary, the color- 
stimulus which, mixed with red light, produces a colorless-light 
sensation, is blue-green. 
§ 13. The theory set forth in Chapter III. is that of Mrs. C. L. 
Franklin, with which that of von Kries is in partial agreement. 
Its main teachings are the following: (1) Sensations of color are 
due to the partial decomposition, or dissociation, of a photochemi- 
cal substance in the retinal cones. In an early stage of its de- 
velopment this cone-substance is capable of two sorts of decom- 
position according as it is acted on by light of short or of long 
ether vibrations, occasioning sensations of blue and of yellow 
respectively. Later, “ the yellow-producing constituent is in its 
turn broken up into two parts . . . that respond respectively to 
. .redlightand. . . green light.” In this advanced stage, four 
kinds of partial decomposition are possible, one occasioning the 
sensation of blue, another resulting in the consciousness of red, a 
third conditioning the sensation of green, and a fourth, which oc- 
curs when yellow light or when red and green light together fall on 
the retina, conditioning the sensation of yellow. This last form of 
dissociation corresponds to the yellow-producing process in the 
more primitive form of the cone-substance. (2) A mixture of 
blue and yellow lights, or of blue, red, and green lights, totally 
decomposes the cone-substance and gives the sensation of color- 
less light. (3) Sensations of colorless light are conditioned also 
by the total decomposition of an undifferentiated photochemical 
substance in the rods of the retina which “goes to pieces all at 
once under the influence of light of any kind.” The special ad- 
vantages of this theory are these: First, it admits with Hering the 
psychical distinctness of the sensations of red, yellow, green, and 
blue, while yet, with Helmholtz, it explains the facts of color- 
mixture. Second, it readily explains the facts of peripheral and 
of twilight vision. For rods, not cones, are found on the periph- 
ery of the outer zones of the retina, and are known by experi- 
mental observation to be readily affected in faint light. (Mrs. 
Franklin supposes that the visual purple, a retinal substance 
x
-P-A-G-E-330
  306 > Supplement to Chapter III. [Pages 
actually observed on the rods, reénforces faint light vision by 
absorbing a large amount of the light which usually passes 
entirely through the transparent rods and cones.) 
§ 14. In the third place, these theories accord notably well with 
certain facts summarized under the name of the Purkinje phenom- 
enon. These facts are the following: (1) Green and blue seen in 
faint light have a greater intensity than red and yellow.* (2) If 
two grays —one produced by the mixture of red and blue-green 
lights, the other by the mixture of blue and yellow lights — be 
precisely matched in a bright light, the first of the two will be 
seen as brighter than the other when both are observed in faint 
light. Both facts give support to the theory that the rods, and 
consequently the visual purple which lies on the rods, have to do 
with colorless light-vision. or all forms of the Purkinje phe- 
nomenon appear only in faint illumination, and the visual purple 
is active only in faint light; moreover, the visual purple absorbs 
green rays —and, after green, blue rays — most readily; finally, 
the Purkinje phenomenon does not occur by excitation of the 
fovee of normal and partially color-blind eyes which lack visual 
purple and rods.f 
§ 15. The von Kries and Franklin theories, finally, offer a plau- 
sible explanation of color-blindness. The facts, though not undis- 
puted, may be summarized as follows: There are two general 
classes of color-blindness, partial and total. Red-blindness (in 
which the spectrum order of colors appears as gray, yellow, blue) 
and green blindness (in which the order is yellow, gray, blue) are 
the most common form of dichromasia, or partial color-blindness ; 
but there are also a few alleged cases of yellow-blue blindness, in 
which the patient sees grays, reds, and greens, but no blues and 
yellows. There are two forms of achromasia, or total color- 
blindness: in one, probably retinal in origin, the fovea is totally 
blind, and there are accompanying defects of vision; in the second 
form of achromasia, very likely due to cerebral defects, the fovea 
is not totally blind, and there are no defects of vision other than

the color-blindness. These facts absolutely contradict the Helm- 
holtz theory; are with difficulty harmonized with the Hering theory ; 
support, or at least do not oppose, a theory of the general type of 
the Franklin hypothesis. 
The conformity of the Franklin theory with these facts may best 
be shown by a somewhat more detailed discussion of red and green 
blindness. The red-green blind person has a normal vision of blue 
and of yellow, but confuses red and green objects with each other. 
Dalton, for example, could not see his scarlet academic gown as it 
lay on the grass; and another red-green blind man could not dis- 
tinguish one branch, turned scarlet, of a maple tree from the rest 
of the tree which was still green. In these cases Hering assumed 
that both objects were seen as gray, and explained the color-blind- 
ness as due to the total lack in the retina of the green-red substance 
and the ceaseless functioning of the white-black substance. But 
this explanation does not cover the distinction, experimentally dis- 
covered, between two sorts of red-green blindness. In that of 
the first type, the red is matched with gray and the green with 
yellow; for example, color-blind subjects examined by the Holm- 
gren test, that is, required to sort a lot of worsted skeins of differ- 
ent color and hue,* throw the unmixed red skein into the pile of 
the grays and the green into the pile of the yellows. In color- 
blindness of the second type, the red is matched with yellow and 
the green with gray. But according to the Hering theory there 
is no reason to suppose that, because the red-green substance is 
lacking from the retina, red or green light should affect the blue- 
yellow substance.t \fhe Franklin theory certainly has a negative 
advantage in that it does not meet this difficulty. Positively, it 
offers a plausible explanation of the two forms of red-green blind- 
ness by the teaching that color molecules in their primitive form 
contain two, not four, vibrating parts or atoms, one which excites 
the sensation of blue and one which excites the sensation of yellow, 
* For experiment, cf. Sanford, 135. 
+ More recently, Hering explains the distinctions in red-green blindness 
as due to individual differences in the macula lutea, or yellow spot. For 
comment on the inadequacy of this view, cf. C. L. Franklin, Psychologi- 
cal Review, VI., p. 82.

and that this yellow-exciting part is later differentiated into the 
parts which excite sensations of red and of green. This hypoth- 
esis explains both the greater commonness of red-green blindness, 
since organs: and functions latest acquired are always first lost, 
and the tendency of red and green light to set in vibration the 
yellow-exciting atom.

(6) Contrast Phenomena 
§ 16. Brief reference has been made in the text of Chapter 
III. to the phenomena of color contrast. Three supplemen- 
tary statements must be made. (1) Contrast appears not 
only in hue, but in brightness; and (2) when the contrasting 
surfaces are white, black, or gray, this is the only observable 
form of the phenomenon. White, for example, seems brighter 
against a dull gray than against a bright gray ground. (3) A 
colored, as well as a gray surface shows a contrast effect 
against a background of another color: yellow is yellower and 
blue is grayer seen on a blue ground. 
The simplest experimental verification of simultaneous con- 
trast consists in the examination of squares or rings of gray, on 
colored surfaces, through a tissue paper covering, which obscures 
the outline of the gray figures; these gray figures will then 
appear in the color complementary to the background.
-P-A-G-E-333
40-41) Appendix, Section III., § 16 309 
An exact explanation of this curious phenomenon has never 
been given, but it has been established by Hering, against the 
teaching of Helmholtz, that the explanation, whatever it is, of 
simultaneous contrast, must be physiological in its nature. Helm- 
holtz taught that simultaneous contrast is no more nor less than 
a psychological illusion. According to his theory, we ‘really’ 
see, not a complementary contrast-color, but the physically excited, 
actual gray figure, though we fallaciously suppose that this gray 
is yellow, if it lies'on a blue background, or green, if it is seen 
against purple. The explanation, for so widespread an illusion, is 
found in the admitted fact that people are accustomed to look at 
familiar, colored objects through a complementary colored medium 
which makes them seem gray. For example, we see a red brick 
wall through the green lights of a hall door; the wall seems gray, 
but we still think of it as red. Or again, the blue gown looks gray 
in the yellow gaslight, but is known to be blue. The gray figures 
of the simultaneous contrast experiences are thus, Helmholtz holds, 
inferred — not actually seen — to be of a color complementary to 
that of the background. But opposed to this theory of Helmholtz 
are insurmountable obstacles. In the first place, it directly con- 
tradicts our introspection. We not only do not naturally see 
objects, in simultaneous contrast, as gray, but in most cases we can- 
not force ourselves to do so; the gray ring on the colored back- 
ground is immediately, and inevitably, blue or yellow or red. 
It is highly improbable, in the second place, that our comparatively 
infrequent and unnoticed experiences of colored objects, in light 
of a complementary color, should have formed in us such a 
habit of inference as this theory supposes. The Helmholtz 
theory is disproved, finally, by direct and unambiguous experi- 
ments.* 
It is fair to conclude, with Hering, that simultaneous contrast 
is physiologically conditioned; in other words, that when one part 
of the retina is directly excited by a colored light, retinal processes 
which condition a complementary color are set up in the neighbor- 
ing retinal regions. This undoubted fact can be stated in terms

of any color-theory, but it has never been, in any strict sense, ex- 
plained, or accounted for.

§ 17. The simple structure from which, biologically speaking, 
the ear seems to be developed, is a sac (the so-called otocyst or

varied in length. These structures are found in certain of the 
lower invertebrates — for example, in jellyfish, in crustacea, and, 
in insects — and in the lower vertebrates. It is probable, however, 
or at least very possible, that these are organs not of hearing, but of 
pressure consciousness, and that the sensations which accompany 
the excitation of these organs do not qualitatively differ from sen- 
sations due to mechanical stimulation. The vibration of air or 
water striking on these organs then acts merely as a jar. It will 
appear that one part of the human ear has probably the same 
function. % 
§ 18. The human ear has three rudely distinguished divisions: 
the outer ear, inner ear, and middle ear. The outer car consists 
in the pinna or concha (M/) opening 
into a hollow tube, the external 
meatus (G); and this tube is closed 
by a surface, the tympanic mem- 
brane (7). This is thrown into vibra- 
tion by the motion of air-particles, 
and its motion is transmitted to a 
series of three bones, called, from 
their shape, malleus, incus, and 
stapes (that is, hammer, anvil, and 210.5 19) eg oon cu ancne ey : oa the semicircular canals (to the stirrup). These bones lie within the sight cf the diagram). Utricle,

ear communicates by two foramina, or windows, with the inner ear, 
a complex bony tube embedded in the spongy part of the tem- 
poral bone of the skull. The inner ear has three main divisions, 
and these must be described in some detail. They are (1) a 
middle chamber, the vestibule (V), which is an irregularly rounded 
envelope containing two small membranous bags, or sacs, the sac- 
cule and the utricle; (2) the three semicircular canals, at right 
angles to each other — one horizontal, one running forward and 
back, one running right to left, all of them opening into the utricle.

vestibule and each membranous canal is surrounded by a liquid, 
the perilymph, and filled with a liquid, the endolymph. A branch 
of the auditory nerve penetrates each of these ampulle and the 
vestibule as well, ending in cells from which hairs project; and in

the vestibule, at least, there are small, hard substances, the ear 
stones, or otoliths. The essential feature of the apparatus is its 
extreme sensitiveness to changes of bodily position. The slightest 
movement which tends to unbalance the body must alter the 
position of the semicircular canals, and thus put in motion the 
endolymph. This movement, with or without the additional 
pressure of an otolith, bends the hairs of the ampullz and stimu- 
lates the vestibular section of the acoustic nerve, and this excitation 
teaches the cerebellum, which is the subcortial nerve-centre for 
the movements affecting bodily equilibrium. Actual experiments 
show the connection of these organs with the preservation of bal- 
ance. Animals deprived either of cerebellum or of semicircular 
canals stagger and fall about in an unbalanced and helpless way; 
and deaf people whose semicircular canals are injured cannot pre- 
serve their equilibrium if they are blindfolded and therefore unable to 
regulate their movements by the visual perceptions of bodily position. 
As so far described, the ear, like the otocyst, seems an organ 
adapted rather for excitation of pressure sensations, due to change 
of position, than for the excitation of the auditory consciousness. 
Auditory consciousness results, in all probability, from processes 
excited in (3) the cochlea, a bony spiral of two and one-half coils 
around an axis. From this axis a projecting spiral shelf, made 
up of a bony part, the lamina spiralis (Lam. sp. in Figure 17), 
and of the basilar membrane (m. b.), divides the coil into two 
winding half-coils, the scala tympani (Sc.T.) and the scala ves- 
tibuli (Sc.V.). The former opens by the round foramen 
into the middle ear; the latter is connected with the vestibule. 
Each contains a liquid, the perilymph. A third division, the 
cochlear canal, or scala media (C.CHil.), is partitioned: off by a mem- 
brane (m.R.) from the scala vestibuli. The cochlear canal forms 
the membranous cochlea and contains a liquid, the endolymph, 
whose vibrations, as will appear, excite the auditory end-organs. 
§ 19. The basilar membrane consists of cross-fibres, radially 
stretched strings varying in length from bottom to top, base to 
apex, of the cochlea — the longest strings near the top, where the 
lamina spiralis, or bony side of the partition, is narrower. Some of

these fibres support the inner and the outer rods of Corti, which 
number respectively about six thousand and about four thousand, 
These are tiny membranous rods increasing in size from base to 
apex of the cochlea and leaned against each other to form an 
arch. The cochlear branch of the auditory nerve runs through

  45-46] Appendix, Section III., § 20 : 315 
It is impossible to state with certainty the function of all these 
structures in hearing. It used to be thought that the rods of Corti 
play the part in our ears of strings in a piano, vibrating because of 
their differing length and span with air-waves of different rates. 
Several arguments, however, tell strongly against this view. The 
rods are neither sufficient in number, nor sufficiently varied in 
size, to serve this purpose; they are not found in the auditory end- 
organs of birds whose ability to discriminate pitches can hardly 
be doubted; and finally, they are not directly connected with the 
fibres of the auditory nerve, which terminate, as has been said, in 
the hair-cells of the basilar membrane. The following is a more 
probable, though by no means a definitely justified, account of the 
function of these structures. It is based on the general assump- 
tions of the Helmholtz theory: When certain fibres of the basilar 
membrane are thrown into sympathetic vibration, the rods of 
Corti are moved upward, and with them hair-cells lying on their 
sides. The filaments projecting from these hair-cells are, thus, 
pushed against the tectorial membrane and the downward reaction 
from this contact excites the auditory nerve-endings in the hair-cells. 
2. Phenomena and Theories of the Auditory Consciousness 
(a) Beats and Combination Tones 
§ 20. A noticeable feature of the auditory consciousness excited 
by the simultaneous vibration of two sounding bodies is the occur- 
rence of beats, swift and regular alternations of loud and weak 
sound. Beats are occasioned by a combination of pendular air- 
waves whose vibration numbers are near each other. Such air- 
waves ‘‘reénforce the vibration of air particles which they affect 
so long as their phases are alike,” but when one of these air-waves 
by itself would set the air particle vibrating in one direction while 
the other would affect the air particle in the opposite way, the two 
counteract each other; and at a given moment the air particle will 
be held in equilibrium so that it will not vibrate at all. Professor 
Myers distinguishes “four stages” in the beating of two tones 
free in the endolymph. Cf. Howell, “ Text-book of Physiology,” 1906, 
p. 368, with citation.  
-P-A-G-E-340
  316 Supplement to Chapter III. [Pages 
according as a tone of, say, 256 vibrations beats (1) with a tone of 
fewer than 264 vibrations, (2) with a tone of 264 to 284 vibrations, 
(3) with a tone of 284 to about 300 vibrations, and (4) with a still 
higher tone. ‘‘In the first stage,” he says, the beats “have a 
surging, in the second a thrusting, and in the third a rattling char- 
acter; finally they fuse and pass into a stage where only rough- 
ness remains, beyond which they completely disappear.” * Helm- 
holtz attributed disagreeable auditory combinations of pitch, or 
dissonances, to the occurrence of beats. 
Simultaneous pendular vibrations, not too closely alike, produce 
so-called combination tones of two sorts—difference tones and 
summation tones. In the first case, the attentive listener hears not 
merely two fundamental tones, but a sound whose vibration number 
equals their difference, sometimes also a second difference tone 
whose vibration number is the difference between the lower primary 
and the first difference tone, and sometimes even lower difference 
tones. In the second case, but with more difficulty, the practised 
listener hears a sound whose vibration number is the sum of the 
two fundamentals. Combination tones are sometimes ‘objec- 
tive’; that is, they are due to external air-waves, but more often 
they are ‘ subjective,’ that is, due to conditions within the ear. In- 
deed, difference tones must always be in this sense subjective, unless 
produced by some secondary vibration of the sounding body. It 
is likely that combination tones are due to the vibrations of the 
tympanic membrane — perhaps also to the vibrations of the mem- 
brane of the fenestra rotunda.t 
(6) Theories of Hearing 
§ 21. Certain alternatives proposed by contemporary psycholo- 
gists to the Helmholtz theory should briefly be named. In criti- 
cism of the theory it is urged, first, that the basilar membrane fibres 
are not capable of vibrating so freely as the theory requires; and 
*C, S. Myers, “A Text-book of Experimental Psychology,” Chapter III., 
p. 39. For experiments, cf. Sanford, 79-81; Titchener, §§ 13, 14. 
+ Cf. Myers, op. cit., pp. 43 ff. For experiments, cf. Sanford, 82; Titch- 
ener, § 15.
-P-A-G-E-341
  45-46] Appendix, Section III., § 21 317 
second, that their variations in length — only 0.04 to 0.49 between 
the longest and the shortest of the 24,000 fibres — is too slight to 
permit vibrations ranging from 15 to more than 20,000 per second. 
In lieu of the Helmholtz hypothesis, and to avoid these difficulties, 
the following theories, among others, have been advanced: — 
(1) The hypothesis of Rutherford (the so-called telephone theory) 
regards the cochlea merely as a transmitting instrument, and holds 
that the special characters of a sound sensation have purely cere- 
bral explanation. 
(2) The theory of Ewald is based on experiments with elastic 
membranes, some of them of minute size and of great delicacy. 
Ewald found that such a membrane vibrates throughout its length 
at each stimulation and that, examined under a microscope, it 
presents the picture of a series of waves, visible as ‘dark, trans- 
verse streaks.’ These sound-pictures, as Ewald calls them, vary, 
that is, the crests of the waves vary in their interval for each tone; 
and Ewald supposes that, at these intervals, hair-cells and nerve- 
fibres are stimulated. 
(3) The theory of Max Meyer is not easily stated in abbreviated 
form. He supposes that successive sound waves, of a given vibra- 
tion number, travelling up the scala vestibuli, press down the basilar 
membrane, and that pitch is due to the number per second of these 
downward pressures, and loudness to the extent of basilar mem- 
brane, and thus to the number of nerve terminations, excited. 
The first of these theories is rather a confession of ignorance 
than a positive hypothesis. The objection to them all is that they 
fail to take account of the very elaborate differentiation of struc- 
tures in the organ of Corti.* Yet both the Ewald and the Meyer 
hypotheses are worthy of further study.

(c) The Qualities of Pitch 
§ 22. The hypothesis that there are as many elemental qualities 
of pitch as there are distinguishable qualities in an octave is sug- 
gested by McDougall, and supported by the following considera- 
tions: “(r) The analogy of the other senses, in which . . . the 
elementary qualities are few, renders improbable the assumption 
of a very large number in the case of hearing. (2) We know that 
it is impossible for some ears to analyze complex tones or clangs 
which are easily analyzed by others, and that even a well-trained ear 
may find difficulty in analyzing the complex form of a tone and 
its octave or first overtone. (3) Pure tones are not merely more 
or less different in pitch; some that are of very different pitches 
have nevertheless a great resemblance; ... The first overtone 
or octave of any tone differs from it, as regards pitch, more than 
any of the intermediate tones of the scale, and yet is, in another 
indefinable fashion, more like it, so much like it that even a trained 
ear may mistake a tone for its first overtone. This fact suggests 
that each pure tone is a fusion of at least two elementary qualities, 
one of which is common to it and all its upper and lower octaves, 
another which is peculiar to it and . . . constitutes its pitch. 
(4) If each distinguishable tone were an elementary quality, we 
should expect to find that when the air is made to vibrate at a 
steadily increasing rate, as when a violinist runs his finger up the 
bowed string . . . the pitch would rise by a series of steps from 
one elementary quality to another; but this is not the case; the 
transition is perfectly smooth and continuous. . . . We are there- 
fore driven to believe that the so-called simple tones are . . . com- 
plexes, and we have no certain guidance as to the number of 
elementary qualities by the fusions of which all the tones are pro-
-P-A-G-E-343
  41-42] Appendix, Section III., § 23 319 
duced... . Perhaps the most satisfactory view, if the physical 
mechanism of the internal ear can be shown to admit of its adop- 
tion, is that all the elementary qualities are contained in a single 
octave, which might be likened to the complete color-series, and 
that the differences of pitch that distinguish the same qualities in 
different octaves are not properly differences of quality, depending 
upon specific differences of the psycho-physical processes, but are 
rather of the same order as differences of extensity or voluminous- 
ness in the case of visual, tactual, or temperature sensations, and 
are due to differences in the number of sensory neurones excited, 
the deep pitch (the voluminous) being due to simultaneous stimu- 
lation of many neurones, high pitch to stimulation of few.”* 
The physiological assumption of this theory is not, on @ priori 
grounds, incompatible with any one of the theories of tone. 
c. End-organs of Taste and of Smell 
§ 23. Evidently, the ability to respond to the chemical stimulus 
of food is at least as potent a factor in the preservation and de- 
velopment of animal life as the sensitiveness to mechanical stimu- 
lation from external objects. As a matter of fact, certain unicellu- 
lar animals, amoebe and many metazoa of simple form, respond 
by a special reaction to chemical stimulation. A hydra, for ex- 
ample, always avoids mechanical objects, but seizes on food with 
its tentacles.| We must guard ourselves, however, from attributing 
either taste or smell, as we know them, to animals who have no 
trace of distinct taste and smell end-organs and who give no evi- 
dence of reacting in different fashion to liquid and to gaseous 
stimulus. Such differentiated organs and reactions are not found 
in animals lower in the scale than insects, and are lacking in many 
of the lower vertebrates.}j The comparative psychologists give 
the name ‘chemical sensations’ to the simple consciousness which 
may be supposed to accompany the undifferentiated reactions to 
chemical stimuli.

§ 24. In the human body the end-organs both of smell and of 
taste are structurally similar to those of contact, though they occur 
neither on the outer or joint surfaces nor in the muscles, but in the

of smell are situated in the upper part of the nose. The nasal 
cavities are divided,

facts are (1) partial anosmia, or permanent insensibility to some 
smells, not to all, an infrequent but well-established experience; 
and (2) the normal effect of fatigue. A person, for example, 
whose end-organs of smell have been fatigued by continuously 
smelling camphor, can smell creosote as well as ever, almond but 
faintly, and turpentine not at all. If smell end-organs were of one 
type only, all would be alike fatigued, and complete insensibility 
would be the result.* We have, however, no list of elemental 
smell qualities by which to test in an exact way the differentiation 
of smell end-organs. Zwaardemaker has, to be sure, proposed a 
classification on the basis of that of Linnzus, into ethereal, 
aromatic, balsamic, amber-musk, alliaceous, burning, hircine, re- 
pulsive, and nauseating smells.t Obviously, however, this is no 
list of elemental qualities, but an empirical grouping of complex 
odors. 
The olfactory nerve leads from the smell end-organs in the peak 
of the nostril to the olfactory lobe, originally a projection from the 
hemispheres, but, in the adult brain, lying on the lower surface of 
the frontal lobe. From the olfactory lobe, nerve-fibres lead to the 
median surface of the temporal lobe. The olfactory lobes and 
tracts are much more developed in other vertebrate brains than 
in the human brain: and it will be remembered that the sense 
of smell, in the higher vertebrate animals, though perhaps less dif- 
ferentiated, is far keener than ours. 
§ 25. The end-organs of taste are situated near the entrance 
to the alimentary canal, within the papille or folds formed by 
the membranous covering of the tongue and the forward part of 
the palate. _Two kinds of papilla have to do with taste excita- 
tion: large circumvallate papille, like castles surrounded by moats, 
found mainly near the root of the tongue; and elongated fungiform 
papille, visible as red dots on the forward and middle part of the 
tongue. All the circumvallate papilla and some of the fungi- 
form papille carry taste-buds, minute globular bodies containing

In children, all parts of the tongue and even the mucous mem-

adults, the cheek linings and the middle part of the tongue are 
completely insensitive. Different parts of the tongue are sensi-

is important also to know that a given papilla may be sensitive to 
several stimuli as well as to one.* This fact, taken in connection 
with the phenomena of ageusia, or loss of taste, indicate that the 
taste-buds (or other taste end-organs, if there 
be such) are differentiated to respond, some 
to one stimulus, some to another; and that 
they are distributed in varied proportions in 
the different regions of tongue and of palate. 
The cerebral centre of taste is probably in 
the median temporal lobe.

have been developed from differentiated structures in the skin. 
The uncritical observer thinks of the skin as ‘organ’ of contact, 
of temperature, and of pain sensations; but the skin — besides 
serving as excretory organ — merely contains and protects the 
minute organs affected by the external physical stimulus. The 
most important of these organs are: (1) Hair-bulbs, from which 
project the fine hairs which transmit any movement with accel- 
erated force. (2) Tactile corpuscles (Meissner’s), found chiefly 
in the papille of the dermis of hand and of foot. (3) Touch 
cells (Merkel’s) ‘of the same essential structure,’ but receiving only 
one nerve-fibre each, distributed all over 
the skin. (4) Pacinian corpuscles widely 
distributed in the skin, the periosteum of 
the bone, the covering of the viscera, the 
muscles, and the tendons. (4) Articular 
end-bulbs, found on joint surfaces. (5)

in tendons, cross-striated muscles, outer

gans of pressure sensation due to stimulation of the skin. For 
the hairy parts of the skin are especially sensitive to pressure; 
and one or more pressure spots are almost always found near the 
place where each hair leaves the skin. On the hairless surfaces 
(which however are few and of small extent) the corpuscles of 
Meissner correspond fairly well in number with the actually dis- 
covered pressure-spots. Furthermore, with the exception of the 
hair-cells and the Meissner corpuscles, no end-organs occur in 
numbers at all equal to those of the pressure-spots of any given 
locality.

There is less certainty concerning the end-organs of pain, cold, 
and warmth. Von Frey teaches that the end-organs of cutaneous 
pain sensation are the so-called ‘free’ nerve-endings — that is 
to say, the endings of nerves without differentiated terminal 
organs — in the epidermis, or bloodless upper layer of the skin.* 
He reaches this conclusion on the ground that the relation of weight 
of stimulus to intensity of sensation proves that the pain end- 
organs lie above the pressure organs, a condition fulfilled by the 
free nerve-endings only.* An apparent objection to this theory is 
the fact that pain, with end-organs nearer the surface, is less easily 
excited than pressure. This difficulty is met by the supposition 
that, in the case of stimuli of moderate intensity and duration, 
the inelastic epidermis, in which are the free nerve-endings, simply 
transmits the stimulus to the lower-lying cutis, in which are the 
pressure organs. The fact that the warmth spots on the skin are 
so much less easily determined than the cold spots suggests the 
possible identification of organs of cold with the ‘end-bulbs of 
Krause’ and of warmth organs with the deeper-lying ‘endings of 
Ruffini.’ The excitation of cold spots by a stimulus above 45° 
centigrade gives the so-called ‘paradoxical sensation’ of cold. 
Comparing the sensitive spots of the skin — the pressure spots, 
pain spots, warmth and: cold spots which cover end-organs of these 
various sorts — we reach the following results: In spite of the 
differences in distribution, already noted,t the greater part of 
the skin may be said to contain pressure, pain, cold, and warmth 
spots. The pain spots are most frequent, though pain is less 
easily excited than pressure sensation. There are on the average 
at least roo pain spots,t 25 pressure spots, 12 cold spots, and 2 
warmth spots on a square centimeter of the skin. All the end- 
organs, except those of pain, seem to become adapted to long- 
continued stimulation : for example, we no longer notice the warmth

of the room or the pressure of our clothes; but pain does not wear 
away while the stimulus persists, even, though we grow relatively 
inattentive to it. | 
It should be added that recent experiments point to the existence 
of a second, previously undiscovered, otaneots sensory appara- 
tus. Phenomena which attend the) healing, after cutting, of 
afferent cutaneous nerves indicate that accurately localized sen- 
sations (of light contact and of moderate cold and warmth, not 
of pain) occur independently of the sensations due to excitation 
of the end-organs just described.* 
§ 28. In addition to the sense-organs in the skin, end-organs 
differing from these in external form which are yet (in all proba- 
bility) modifications of essentially similar endings are found in 
the muscles and joints. These deeper-lying end-organs condition 
sensations of which the greater number, at least, seem to be of 
the same nature as cutaneous sensations: pressure, cold, warmth, 
and pain. Among these deeper-lying organs are the Pacinian 
corpuscles in the muscles and joints, to whose excitation are due 
the sensations, probably of pressure, following on the independent 
stimulation of muscle and of oo Strain-sensation, due to 
excitation of the tendons, very likely has as end-organs the so- 
called ‘spindles of Golgi.’ 
Some psychologists have attributed to subcutaneous end-organs 
what they regard as the sensational consciousness of bodily posi- 
tion and of bodily movement — so-called ‘static’ { and ‘kinesthetic’   
* Cf. the writers cited in paragraph 3 of the Bibliography. This newly 
discovered ‘epicritic’ sensory mechanism is distinguished from the ordinary 
‘protopathic’ system in that excitation of this ‘epicritic’ system is not 
punctiform. In other words, not specific areas of the skin but the whole 
surface seems sensitive to light contact, cold, and warmth. Furthermore 
the sensations due to excitation of the epicritic system (not those due to ex- 
citation of the protopathic apparatus) may be graded in intensity and ac- 
curately localized. The relation between these two systems of sensibility 
and the cutaneous end-organs, described in the text, has not been satis- 
factorily determined.

sensation. In the opinion of the writer of this book these are, 
however, complex not simple experiences, perceptions not sensa- 
tions. According to this view, the perception of bodily position 
includes along with pressure sensations due to supporting objects 
—chair, couch, or floor —a visual consciousness, perceptual or 
imagined, of the body. Where this visual consciousness is lack- 
ing, as when one wakes suddenly, there is a loss of consciousness 
of position. Similarly the consciousness of movement of the body 
is made up of the pressure consciousness due somewhat to muscular 
contraction but mainly to the movement of joint-surfaces on each 
other and supplemented by the visual consciousness of the body 
in successive positions.

§ 29. The theory of elements of consciousness which this book up- 
holds is based on the conception of an ‘element of consciousness,’

as a further unanalyzable result of a structural* analysis of con- 
sciousness — a distinguishable, though never separate, constitu- 
ent of experience. Other criteria which have been proposed 
are ‘independent variation’ (cf. M. F. Washburn cited below) 
and absolute, atomic distinctness (cf. H. Miinsterberg, “‘ Grundziige 
der Psychologie;”’ Kap. XV., sec. 4). For defence of the conception 
of qualities, intensities, and extensities as ‘attributes’ of the sensa- 
tion, regarded as element, cf. E. B. Talbot, Philos. Review, 1895, 
IV., pp. 154 ff.; for summary, cf. M. F. Washburn, Philos. Review, 
1902, XI., pp. 445 ff. : 
§ 30. The conception of sensational intensity and extensity 
as elements of consciousness has been opposed on the ground that 
no physical and physiological conditions of intensity and extensity 
can be assigned. For detailed consideration of this objection, cf. 
Psychological Review, 1899, pp- 506 ff. 
§ 31. Within the class of sensational elements, psychological 
method recognizes three subclasses, usually distinguished as 
qualities, intensities, and extensities. The fundamental ground 
for this division is the observed distinctness of these groups of 
elements, the fact that the experiences of hue, of pitch, and of taste 
seem, from one point of view, to belong together, and to be equally 
distinct from the experiences of brightness, of loudness, and of 
taste intensity, or from the consciousness of visual and auditory 
bigness. The experiences of intensity and of extensity are further 
distinguished on the ground of their capacity for being ordered 
in direct and simple sensational series. For amplification of this 
distinction, cf. the writer’s “An Introduction to Psychology,” 
second edition, 1905, pp. 43 ff., 105 ff., with citation, and Miin- 
sterberg, “Grundziige,” Kap. VIII., pp. 276 ff., 283 ff. 
§ 32. For further discussion of sensational extensity, cf. Chapter 
IV., pp. 66 ff., and Appendix, Section IV., § 2, pp. 333 ff. For 
emphasis on the distinction between the elemental experience of — 
extensity, or bigness, and the complex consciousness of position, 
cf. pp. 67 ff. It is still a moot question, even among psychologists 
who admit the elemental nature of visual and pressure extensity, 
* For the meaning of this term, cf. pp. 14, 182, above.

whether we may be said to have a consciousness of extensity 
accompanying sounds, tastes, and other sensational qualities. 
§ 33. Duration is often named along with quality, intensity, 
and extensity as a sensational element (or, in the older termi- 
nology, ‘attribute of sensation’). But the consciousness of 
duration seems to be a complex rather than an elemental ex- 
perience; and seems not even to form a necessary part of all 
sensational experience. It should be noted that this conclusion 
is not incompatible with the conviction that we have some sort 
of elemental consciousness of time. (Cf. pp. 85, 140 f., 231.) 
§ 34. This book recognizes three sorts of structurally ele- 
mental consciousness: sensational, affective, and relational. I 
find these ‘ elements’ embedded within my consciousness, that 
is, within my relatedness to objects, whatever form this related- 
ness may take. The three groups of these ‘ structural elements’ 
(the common factors of all forms of the self’s relation, or atti- 
tude, to objects) may be distinguished, as follows, from each other. 
(t) The sensational elements are differentiated in that they 
are so readily externalized, that is, referred to external ob- 
jects. Thus, I am more apt to speak of blue or hot objects 
than of the forms of my visual and cutaneous consciousness. 
(2) Affective elements differ from sensational in that they are 
more naturally, and probably primitively, referred to the self. 
Liking and disliking, being happy and unhappy, are the basal 
elements of consciousness from this point of view. To be sure, 
we speak also of pleasant and unpleasant, agreeable and dis- 
agreeable, objects, but it is universally admitted that pleasant- 
ness and unpleasantness are not external qualities. (3) Rela- 
tional elements, finally, occupy a sort of midway position. They 
seem to be less inevitably externalized than sensations, yet they 
are, perhaps, less ‘ subjective’ (in the sense of being less defi- 
nitely referred to the subject-self) than the affections. We com- 
pare objects with each other and are conscious of their likeness. 
But relational elements differ from both the sensational and the 
affective at one important point. The relational consciousness 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
    
Appendix, Section IIT., §§ 33-34 Ban 
always presupposes the presence of a multiple or complex object ; 
or, stated from another standpoint, the elemental relational 
consciousness is always fused with at least two other expe- 
riences, elemental or complex. Thus, I cannot compare or 
connect without comparing or connecting at least two objects 
‘or parts of objects. 
There is another distinction — not specifically psychological 
—between the sensational elements and the other two classes 
of elements. Corresponding with every sensational element 
there is some assignable change both in an area of the brain- 
cortex and in a peripheral nerve end-organ; and for almost 
every sensational element there is a distinct physical condi- 
tion. Thus the rate of ether-wave vibration conditions the 
consciousness of color-quality, and the amplitude of the wave 
the consciousness of color-intensity. On the other hand, there 
are obviously no definite physical modes of stimulation and 
thus no end-organs of the attributive and the relational con- 
sciousness. 
These criteria of the elements of consciousness are, one and 
all, reflectively observed characters, facts later ‘known about’ 
the elements of consciousness. This statement is of impor- 
tance as guarding against the charge of treating the ‘ objec- 
tivity,’ ‘subjectivity,’ and ‘presupposition of at least two 
objects’ as if they were constituents of the elements of con- 
sciousness.

A reference to the ‘personal attitudes,’ as related to the 
structural elements’ is not out of place at this point. The fol- 
lowing enumeration does not, however, claim to be either defini- 
tive or complete. 
ParTIAL ENUMERATION OF PERSONAL ATTITUDES 
I. (Unsympathetic; either social or non-social) 
Receptiveness and Activity 
Attention (Egoistic and Altruistic) 
II. Sympathy ( lways social) 
a. Non-emotional 
6. Emotional 
The position of the ‘structural elements’ with reference to 
these ‘personal attitudes’ has been stated repeatedly. The 
elements are the constituents, introspectively discovered, of each 
‘attitude,’ each form of consciousness, that is, of each form of 
relation of self to object. Whether I am receptively or ac- 
tively, attentively or inattentively conscious, whether or not I 
am sharing my object with other selves, whether I am conscious 
of individual or of class, I may always, by introspection, find 
within my consciousness further irreducible factors, the struc- 
tural elements. 
The preceding chapters of this book have sought to justify 
the enumeration of personal attitudes by making clear the fol- 
lowing points: (1) The receptive attitude characterizes percep- 
tion and emotion, whereas will and faith are the essentially active 
experiences. Similarly, in imagination and in thought images 
and comparisons ‘flash’ upon me and I am, indeed, often ob- 
sessed by my imaginings and profoundly impressed by the 
inevitableness of the conclusions which thrust themselves upon 
me. For these reasons, thought and imagination are not active 
experiences and yet both lack the direct consciousness of pas- 
sivity, and both are often preceded by inner volition, as when 
I seek to remember a name or to trace an elusive analogy. 
(2) Attention, it has appeared, is everywhere manifest, and the
-P-A-G-E-358
' 
. 334 Supplement to Chapter III. 
contrast between egoism and altruism (attention to myself 
; and to my object, in particular to my personal object) is well 
illustrated by the opposition of egoistic to altruistic emotion 
and by the distinction between will and faith. (3) Sympathy. 
(in the sense of participation or assumed community of experi- 
ence) is sometimes directly, and may always be reflectively, or 
retrospectively,.a realized factor not only of a group of emotions 
but also of perception and of thought. 
Besides concerning itself with the personal attitudes and the 
structural elements, psychological description, as attempted in 
this book, takes account of the distinctions between objects of 
the self. The most important of these is that between ‘imper- 
sonal’ and ‘personal’ objects. As has been shown, any volition, 
emotion, or recognition is social when it has a personal object, 
but the sympathetic consciousness is always social and has a 
three-fold object: thus, in perception and in sympathetic emo- 
tion my objects are myself, the other self, or selves, and the 
object (personal or impersonal) which is common to us. A 
second significant contrast is that between the ‘ generalized’ 
object of conceptual thinking and the emphatically ‘individual- 
ized’ object of emotion, will, and faith. Individualization, it 
has been noted, is primarily an awareness of the uniqueness of 
a self, and is referred only secondarily to impersonal objects’ 
Still further distinctions have been made between the ‘ external- 
ized’ objects of perception and the ‘non-externalized’ objects of 
non-perceptual experience ; and between the ‘ non-temporal ’ ob- 
jects of many forms of thought and the ‘ temporal’ objects of 
some forms of thought and of many forms of emotion and 
of will. And it has appeared, finally, that this consciousness 
of past and of future involves (what is emphasized in recogni- 
tion) an awareness of the persistence of the self. 
This summary of the chief teachings of this book recalls the 
fact that the self was described, in the first chapter as unique, 
persisting, related to objects, and complex. It has now become 
evident that every feature of this description is essential to 
an adequate self-psychology.

C. Tse PsycnopHysicaAL Law 
§ 35. The psychophysical law formulates a well-known rela- 
tion between physical stimulation and sensational consciousness: 
the more intense a stimulus to sensation the more it must be 
altered in order that the accompanying conscisusness may vary. 
If, for example, I am carrying a quarter pound of tea I shall feel 
the weight of an added ounce, whereas the same ounce, if it were 
added to a pound or two-pound package, would be followed by 
no consciousness of additional weight. Similarly, in a quiet 
room I hear a fly’s buzzing which I should not hear in a whirr. 
ing factory. Psychological experimenting, especially in the 
early days, was largely concerned with the verification and. the 
application of this law. The general outcome of it is the follow- 
ing: to obtain a series of sensational intensities, just perceptibly 
different from each other, the series of physical stimuli must 
- differ, one from the other, by a certain definite proportion. 
The proportion varies with the form‘of stimulus: the degree 
or sound stimulus must increase by one-third, of gaseous ol- 
factory stimulus by about one-fourth, of mechanical surface 
stimulus by one-twentieth, of mechanical pull by one-fortieth, 
and of light stimulus by one one-hundredth. For example, if 
one can just tell the difference between weights of one hundred 
and one hundred and five grams applied to the ends of the 
fingers, one will not be able to distinguish weights of two hun- 
dred and two hundred and five grams, but will barely discrimi- 
nate weights of two hundred and two hundred and ten.

THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SPACE 
a. The Extensity Consciousness 
§ 2. The teaching of this book, that there is an elemental 
consciousness of extensity, accords with the prevailing doctrine 
of contemporary psychology. It has been disputed, none the less, 
by acute psychologists who urge that the consciousness of ex- 
tensity is no distinctive and elemental experience but rather a 
fusion in which the consciousness of eye or hand movements 
predominates. This account (the empiricist theory, as it is called) 
of the extensity consciousness is based mainly on two facts, 
abundantly proved: (1) that the newly born and those recently 
recovered from congenital blindness are unable rightly to estimate 
distances and to compare shapes; and (2) that our consciousness 
of form and of position includes the consciousness of eye and 
of hand movements. But these admitted facts do not disprove 
the occurrence of an elementary extensity consciousness. They 
prove that the space consciousness is a complex, including con- 
sciousness of movement; and that the capacity to measure and 
to compare forms and distances grows with experience. In other 
words, the empiricists prove that the consciousness of space is more 
than an elemental extensity experience, not that the conscious- 
ness of space is devoid of an elemental extensity consciousness. 
The truth is that the empiricist theory is intended to oppose 
the so-called nativistic doctrine — the assertion that we are born 
with a ready-made consciousness of space. Against such a view 
336

the arguments of the empiricists do hold. But it is not proper 
to confound the ‘nativistic’ teaching about the time of the earli- 
est space consciousness with the ‘sensationalist’ doctrine of an 
extensity element. For bibliography, cf. M. W. Calkins, “An 
Introduction to Psychology,” pp. 495, 496; and add on the sen- 
sationalist side, Ebbinghaus, Grundziige, pp. 422 ff.; Titchener, 
“Text-book,” I., 1909, § 12; S. Witasek, ‘‘ Grundlinien der Psy- 
chologie,” 1908, p. 187. 
b. The Consciousness of A partness 
§ 3. On the consciousness of apartness, cf. especially, Ebbing 
haus, op. cit., 436-437, and Lipps, cited by Ebbinghaus, p. 431. 
The doctrine of Chapter IV. differs from that of Lipps and Ebbing- 
haus in regarding the consciousness of apartness not as elemental 
but as fusion of the sensational consciousness of extension with 
the relational experience of plurality (‘more-than-one-ness’). Eb- 
binghaus tends to confuse this elemental but relational conscious- 
ness with the more complex and partly sensational experience of 
apartness. 
Von Frey has shown by experiment that successive excitation 
of end-organs of pressure lying side by side, however close to each 
other, gives rise to distinguishable pressure sensations; but that 
the pressures thus distinguished are not always localized, either 
correctly or incorrectly. Thus, a subject may recognize two 
stimuli on his wrist, but may be unable to tell whether one is above 
_ or beside the other. Von Frey inclines to the belief that the basis 
of distinction between these sensations must be a difference in 
pressure quality (ein qualitatives Merkzeichen); but it is not 
improbable that the two sensations differ in intensity or in ex- 
tensity, rather than in quality.*

stimulus applied to the skin. If I sit blindfolded and some one 
touch me with pencil point on forehead, hand, or chest, and if 
I am then required myself to touch the point of stimulation, I 
shall succeed approximately, although not without errors. And 
I shall be able to describe in words the place of contact. Evi- 
dently, this consciousness of the point of contact presupposes the 
consciousness of the body as a whole. The problem is to ex- 
plain why the stimulation of a single point of the skin should 
excite the far more complex consciousness of the body as a whole, 
or that of a region of the body. Since the time of Lotze, that 
character or accompaniment of a tactual sensation through which 
it is referred to one part or another of the body has been called 
the tactual local sign. Similarly, the character of a visual sensa- 
tion through which it is ‘referred’ to one part or another of the 
field of vision is called the visual local sign. 
There are two theories of the local sign. (1) According to the 
first, or kinesthetic, theory, suggested by Lotze, the local sign of 
either a visual or a pressure sensation is the consciousness (per- 
ception or imagination) of an habitual reflex movement of eye or 
of hand. (Such consciousness of movement may be supplemented 
by a concrete visual image of the part of the body stimulated, or 
by a verbal image, as of the word ‘forehead,’ ‘arm.’) The local 
sign of a visual sensation is the eye movement necessary to secure 
excitation of the fovea by the stimulating object. The local sign 
of a pressure sensation differs with the portion of the body 
excited —it may be, for example, the imagination of the move- 
ment by which a pencil, touching the wrist, slides toward the 
fingers. 
According to (2) the other view, which may be called the ele- 
ment-theory, there is in every sensation an immediately realized, 
unspatial character due to the specific position of the bodily 
structures which are excited — due, for example, to the excitation 
of more or less closely crowded skin end-organs or retinal structures. 
This unnamed character * is to be confused neither with the con- 
sciousness of color or of pressure, nor with the experience of visual 
* Cf. Von Frey and Metzner, quoted, P- 335, above,
-P-A-G-E-363
       68-72] Appendix, Section IV., §§ 4-5 339 
or of pressure intensity and extensity. For all these may remain 
unchanged while yet the position is known to vary.* 
The two accounts of the local sign differ therefore in the follow- 
ing way. The kinesthetic theory conceives the local sign as 
associated perception or imagination of movement; the ‘nativistic’ 
or elemental theory conceives it as an indescribable element of 
the sensation. But both agree in the important negative teaching 
that the local sign, because it is the character of a single sensation, 
is not itself a consciousness of place. For the consciousness of place, 
or position, is a consciousness of apartness — that is, of more-than- 
one-ness. It cannot then be a constituent either of the conscious- 
ness of stimulation of one skin-point, or of the consciousness of 
any one point in the field of vision. In the words of James: 
“although a feeling of . . . bigness may, a feeling of place cannot 
possibly, form an immanent element in any single sensation.” +

the line ab, though objectively equal to cb, appears longer; and 
(2) illusions of direction. To the latter class beiong (a) the two-

lines ab and cd, though parallel each with ef, yet seem to diverge 
from it in opposite directions, { and by the Poggendorf illusion,

has been no time for setting up habitual eye movements.

a continuation of ab, seems displaced down-

best known is Schréder’s figure. This seems

of the Miiller-Lyer illusion, for example 
(Figure 24), it would suppose that the

but, as a matter of fact, the line ab seldom

(2) The second perceptual theory of these illusions offers different 
accounts of different illusions, but these all agree in explaining 
the illusions not through eye movements but through certain 
innate retinal factors.

ments.{ In its earlier form this theory supposed that corre-

eye movements perceptions of these movements occur, and that 
accordingly these spatial illusions are the consciousness of actual 
movements: that the line cb, for example, in Figure 24, seems 
shorter than ab because the eye actually executes a shorter move- 
ment. In this extreme form the eye-movement theory is, however,

t The enumeration of these three types of explanation leaves out of ac- 
count not only many detail-explanations and all forms of the explanation of the 
illusions as mainly phenomena of attention, but the systematic doctrine of 
Lipps (‘‘Raumaesthetik u. geometrisch. optische Tauschungen,” 1897),

bination of opposing mechanical forces.

experimentally disproved by the experiments of Stratton,* Dodge,{ 
Judd, and others. These experimenters have photographed 
the actual eye movements made during observation of different 
‘forms, and have shown that we do not have an exact conscious- 
ness of the movements actually performed by our eyes. For, in 
the first place, as any ordinary observation of a moving eye con- 
firms, the eye invariably makes a jerky movement in passing 
slowly over the field of vision, and yet we are totally unconscious 
of these pauses in the apparently continuous movements of the 
eye. And, in particular, the movements of our eyes in regarding 
such figures as that of Miiller-Lyer are not of the sort which, on 
this theory, are demanded. It simply is not true that, in looking 
at Figure 24, I am conscious of my eyes as following the outward 
sweep of the lines ad, ae, bf, bg, and that thus I overestimate ab, 
whereas I underestimate cb because my eye movements are arrested 
by the inward turn of ch, ci, bf, and bg. For experiments have 
shown cases of the Miiller-Lyer illusion in which there were no 
‘frequent or marked modifications of the eye movements’ in 
overestimating ab, and in which a short movement in looking at cb 
was supplemented by ‘a secondary movement which . . . carries 
the eye to the true extremity of the underestimated figure.’§_  Ex- 
periments on the Zéllner illusion show that for three out of four 
subjects the eyes were deflected in a direction opposite to that of 
the illusion.|| 
Evidently the theory that the eye movements vary precisely 
with the illusion and that the illusion is itself a consciousness of 
definite eye movements must be abandoned. Yet, none the less, 
the Yale experiments show a parallelism, though irregular and

incomplete, of eye movements and illusion.* The writer of this 
book accordingly holds it probable that (1) some more or less 
vague consciousness ‘of eye movements is a constituent not only 
of our ordinary space consciousness but of this consciousness of 
illusions; that (2) it is impossible that specific illusions can be 
explained by precisely corresponding eye movements; that (3) 
we must therefore suppose a characteristic, but so far undescribed, 
cortical change produced by the eye movements and in part, at 
least, conditioning the illusion.f It must, however, be admitted 
that so general a conclusion leaves almost unanswered the special 
problems raised by these geometrical illusions. And it well may be 
that the illusions are explicable rather in terms of attending and 
of relating than in terms of sensation, whether retinal or motor. f

depth as distinguished from surface. Cf. Hering, Beitrége zur

impulses can be brought into codrdination and equilibrium by a single act 
will be grouped together. Whatever sensory impulses must be responded

Op. cit. p. 225%.)

all space consciousness, yet teach in agreement with the doctrine 
of this book that the consciousness of distance, or depth, is com- 
plex, including, along with the elemental consciousness of mere 
bigness or extensity, other elements and, in particular, either a 
consciousness of movements or, at any rate, a consciousness due 
tomovements. Cf. Ebbinghaus, of. cit., § 38, pp. 423 ff., and Lipps 
there cited. 
2. The Conditions of the Depth Consciousness 
(a) Disparate Images 
§ 7. It is certain that the occurrence of disparate retinal images 
— that is, of right and left eye images which differ slightly — 
is an occasion of our consciousness of depth; for otherwise the 
stereoscopic illusion could not exist. Hering holds, indeed, that 
the occurrence of these disparate images is the sole and sufficient 
explanation of the visual depth consciousness. An apparently 
decisive objection to this view is the fact that depth is perceived 
in monocular vision when the occurrence of more than one retinal 
image is entirely excluded.* 
(6) Accommodation 
§ 8. The monocular visual perception of depth is probably 
conditioned by accommodation, since it occurs when one eye is 
closed so that only a single retinal image can be formed. Yet (1) 
as Baird has shown, some individuals seem to lack, or nearly 
to lack, the monocular consciousness of depth.t And (2) as 
Judd has proved, by photographing eye movements, parallel 
movements of the closed eye are present in monocular vision: 
in other words, accommodation does not occur alone, but is ac- 
* Cf. Baird, cited below, p. 192. 
t For the statement and criticism of a theory, that of F. Hillebrand, which 
denies the influence on the depth consciousness of sensations due to accom- 
modation, cf. J. W. Baird, “The Influence of Accommodation and Convergence 
upon the Perception of Depth.” Amer. Jour. of Psychol., 1903, XIV., pp. 
150-200, esp., pp. 163, 165, 192, 200.
-P-A-G-E-369

companied by binocular eye movements.* Finally (3) all ex- 
perimenters agree that, in monocular vision, the distance of far 
objects is less accurately measured than that of near objects or, 
in technical terms, that “the limens of approach are uniformly 
less than those of recession.” Baird explains this phenomenon 
by the supposition that the relaxation of the ciliary muscle, when 
one regards far objects, occasions fainter tactual-motor sensations 
than the tension of the muscle when one accommodates for near 
objects.t 
(©) Convergence 
§ 9. Changes in the convergence of the eyeballs, like disparate 
images, are invariable correlates of the binocular consciousness 
of depth and distance. There is, however, a marked difference 
in the two situations. In perceiving depth one obviously cannot 
at the same time perceive the retinal images, whereas one always 
perceives, however inattentively, the changes in convergence of the 
eyes. If I hold my two forefingers before my eyes, approximately 
in the line of clearest vision, the one about a foot and the other 
about two feet away from me, and if then I look from one to the 
other I am distinctly conscious of the movements which are made 
as the eyeballs converge less or diverge more. Not merely, 
then, are convergence and divergence conditions of depth percep- 
tion, but the consciousness of the greater or less convergence is a 
constituent of the depth or distance consciousness. 
f. Auditory Localization 
§ 10. A discussion of auditory localization must take account of 
its physical and physiological conditions and of its psychic nature. 
Such a discussion may profitably be based on an enumeration of 
the more important facts of auditory localization, as established 
by experiment. These are the following: — 
1. Monaural localization, that is, localization with one ear 
* Cf. Yale Psychological Studies, 1907, pp. 396-397. 
t Op. cit., pp. 196-197. Hillebrand had urged the phenomenon as proof 
that accommodation is not a condition of monocular depth consciousness.

when the other is deaf or else artificially closed, is far less accurate 
than binaural localization.* 
2. Asound from the right is never confused with a sound from 
the left. This is the outcome of many thousand tests.* 
3- (a) Sounds given in the median plane, that is, from front 
to back, are constantly confused. All investigators agree on this 
point. Yet median plane localization is capable of great im- 
provement.t (6) Many other pairs of ‘confusion points’ occur, 
symmetrically situated with reference to the point at which the 
monaural stimulus is most intense.{ 
4. Discrimination of the direction of two sounds is keener when 
the sounds are given near the front and near the back (not, how- 
ever, in the exact front or back) than when given at the sides.§ 
5. Equidistant sounds seem to vary both in intensity and in 
distance with different positions. In particular, a sound at the 
side (near the ‘aural axis’) seems louder and nearer than a sound 
in another position. || 
6. (a) Sounds seem: to vary in timbre and even in pitch with 
different positions. (6) Complex tones — the tones of the voice, 
for example — are better localized than simple tones, such as those 
of a tuning-fork. { : 
On these results of experimentation a consideration of the 
physical conditions of localization has now to be based. Several in- 
ferences from the facts may be made with some assurance. First, 
binaural localization depends either (a) on the intensity, or (b) on the 
pitch and timbre, of sound stimuli. (a) A sound stimulus affects 
the right and left ear differently according as it is situated more to 
the right or more to the left. Localization is due in large part to 
this ‘binaural ratio of intensities.’ This is argued from the facts 
(x and 4, in the enumeration just given) that binaural localiza-

tion is superior to monaural; and that sounds at the front or back 
are better discriminated than sounds at the side. For a sound near 
the front or the back affects the two ears with nearly equal in- 
tensities, and consequently a change in the ratio of these intensities 
is readily noticed. The occurrence of confusion points is another 
argument to this conclusion, for the binaural ratio of sounds at 
confusion points is the same. Yet () variations in timbre and in 
pitch, as well as variations in intensity, are conditions of binaural 
localization. This is argued from the introspection of observers, 
(cf. 6 above), and from the improvement, through practice, in 
median plane localization when sound intensities are equal for 
the two ears. (Cf. 3 (@).) 
Second, monaural localization, also, is due both to variations in 
the intensity and to variations in the pitch and the timbre of sound 
stimuli. (xt) The dependence of monaural localization on the 
intensity of sound is shown by the relatively accurate and mainly 
monaural localization of sounds given in the aural axis. (Cf. 5, 
on p. 344). (2) The significance of pitch and timbre is shown 
by the cases of monaural localization (inaccurate, to be sure) of 
sounds which are not near the aural axis. 
The physiological conditions of auditory localization are next 
to be discussed. They are not so readily assigned, and four 
different theories have, in fact, been held. Auditory localization 
has been attributed: first, to the excitation of specific organs in 
the semi-circular canals ;* and second, to the cutaneous excitation 
of the shell and drum of the ear.| With greater probability, audi- 
tory localization is explained as due, third, to specific brain pro- 
cesses, in particular, to processes corresponding respectively with 
the consciousness of right and of left.{ Fourth and finally, as the 
preachers used to say, auditory localization has been‘attributed to 
the occurrence of reflex movements, especially of head movements.§

Of these four physiological theories, the first has been decisively 
disproved * and for the second there is no important evidence. 
In default of any further explanation one has, thus, to choose be- 
tween the last two; and such a choice at once involves the problem: 
What is the nature of the consciousness of the position of sounds? 
Two types of description are in the field —the nativistic and 
the empiricist. The first or nativistic theory, corresponding with 
the theory of specific brain processes, either holds, with Stumpf, 
that special sensations of right and left occur or, with Pierce, it 
asserts simply that “auditory impressions originally possess 
positional characters.” The second, or empiricist, account of 
auditory localization teaches that the primary constituents of the 
distance consciousness are certain movements or tendencies to 
movement excited by the varying intensities and qualities of 
sounds. 
The writer of this book inclines to adopt the ‘motor’ theory 
just stated. According to this view, auditory as well as visual 
Tocalization is primarily describable in terms of perception or 
imagination of bodily motion supplemented, for all seeing people, 
by visual imagination of the body and its environment. The 
movements, perceived or imagined, which condition this con- 
sciousness may be movements of the body as a whole, or even eye 
movements, toward the source of sound. The physical conditions 
of these movements are the varying intensities and qualities of 
sound stimuli.   Two amplifications of this statement are necessary. It must 
be noticed, in the first place, that such a motor theory need not 
imply that every consciousness of position is conditioned by a 
definite reaction, reflexly excited, and that it consists in the con- 
sciousness of this precise reflex movement. The notorious errors 
* Cf. Breuer, Bloch, p. 18; Pierce, 139 ff., esp. p. 142. The point of 
Bloch’s criticism is that all sound waves must affect the semicircular canals 
alike, since all reach it through the external meatus. 
+ Cf. Angell and Fite, pp. 236, 246. It should be stated that this criticism 
does not deny the fact that the pinna, or shell of the ear, may deflect the 
direction of sound-waves and thus, indirectly, affect localization, Cf 
Bloch, pp. 36°, 48°; Starch, 1905, p. 24.

of localization, and the failures of attempts to demonstrate an 
exact parallel between bodily movements and accurate localiza- 
tions, make this view untenable.* It will be observed, in the second 
place, that a motor theory is entirely compatible with an admission 
of the significance of visual imagination (either the imagination 
of feet, face, or hair, or the imagination of certain parts of the 
ordinary environment) in the consciousness of ‘up’ and ‘down,’ 
‘front’ and ‘back.’ It is even possible that, in the developed 
localizing consciousness of some subjects, these visual images may 
have crowded out the motor consciousness. Originally, however, 
and probably in most adult experiences, these visual images are 
supplementary to the percepts or images of instinctive motor re- 
actions to the source of sound. 
It is at once evident that this theory is readily harmonized 
with the facts established by observation. In particular, it 
accounts for the lack of confusion between right and left. And 
it explains the errors in localizing sounds in the median plane, for 
such sounds are equidistant from right and left ears, and there is 
consequently no tendency to move rather in the one direction than 
in the other. It has furthermore a decisive advantage over every 
visual theory in that it offers an explanation of the consciousness 
‘of right and of left. For how conceivably can right be distin- 
guished from left in purely visual terms? Right and left, as Kant 
long ago pointed out, are perfectly symmetrical, and accordingly 
there seems to be nothing by which to distinguish either the visual 
(or the merely tactual) consciousness of the right of my body 
from that of the left. The psychologist has, therefore, to adopt 
either the motor theory, which conceives the right as ‘that which 
is realized to be more mobile,’ or he has to espouse the Stumpf- 
Preyer theory of specific right and left sensations. This Stumpf 
theory, it will be admitted, is readily harmonized with many facts 
of localization, yet it is open to important objections: (1) The 
* This admission, coupled with the recognition of body and eye move- 
ments, as well as head movements, as conditions of localization, seems to 
meet the objections raised by Bloch (p. 19) and by Pierce (pp. 150 ff.) to the 
Miinsterberg theory.
-P-A-G-E-374
  350 Supplement. to Chapter IV. [Pages 
theory requires the hypothesis of precisely similar end-organs 
whose excitation results in different sensations merely because 
the organs are situated respectively to right and to left. This sup- 
position clearly is contrary to physiological analogy. (2) Many 
children learn but slowly to distinguish right from left, and 
some people never learn to make the distinction save through 
artificial associations, that, for example, of the left with the ring 
finger. This would scarcely be possible if there were immediate 
and original sensations of right and of left. (3) Simultaneous 
sounds of the same quality, given one to the right ear and one 
to the left, fuse into one sound attributed to an intermediate posi- 
tion. This fact is readily explicable by the supposition of a single 
movement as resultant of stimuli to two opposed movements, but 
is not easily harmonized with the hypothesis of distinct right and 
left sensations. For these reasons, the Stumpf theory can scarcely 
win assent, and Pierce’s form of the nativistic theory is too in- 
definite to serve the purpose of a localization theory.* 
The strongest objection to this modified form of the motor 
theory is based on the results of experiments showing that two 
sounds of different quality simultaneously given, one from the 
right and one from the left, are often simultaneously attributed to 
approximately their actual positions. Such localization seems to 
involve an opposition and consequent cancelling of rightward by 
leftward movement.t The objection, however, loses most of its 
force when it is remembered first that the memory of movements 
* Pierce seems virtually to admit that undifferentiated ‘positional charac- 
ters’ play no part in localization, for he says (p. 193”) ‘“When I say that asound 
is ‘here’ or ‘there’ . . . Imean . . . the sort of reaction that must be made 
in order that the sounding body may be seen or touched or brought to the 
position of most distinct hearing.” His main argument for positional charac- 
ters is based on the fact that, under experimental conditions, a sound may 
be localized in the head, and on the conclusion that such localizatidn must be 
elemental because (p. 181) ‘‘neither vision nor touch has any actual experience 
with the endocephalic masses.” This observation, however, directly contra- 
dicts that of the writer and of others, who certainly sometimes have a visual 
image, very schematic, of the interior of the skull.

may perhaps persist when actual movement is checked, and 
second, that so-called simultaneous localization may well consist 
in a consciousness of rightward swiftly succeeded by that of left- 
ward movement.

  SECTION V. 
I. Instinct 
§ 1. The study of instinct is common ground to biologist and 
to psychologist proper. From the biological point of view the 
instinct is an unlearned, or innate, reaction of organism to environ- 
ment, normally characteristic of a family or species, and pre- 
sumably of use to the race and often, also, to the individual. 
(A distinction sometimes made between the instinctive as co- 
ordinated and complex reaction and the reflex as simple seems to 
the writer to add an unnecessary character. A baby’s first vague 
movements, though uncoérdinated, are properly called ‘instinctive. ’) 
The psychologist is concerned both with the instinctive bodily 
reaction as sequent or accompaniment of the conscious relation 
of self to environment and with the instinctive consciousness — 
whether perceptual or emotional. (For modes of consciousness 
as well as movements may be distinguished as instinctive or 
acquired.) In both cases the fundamental distinction, never to 
be obscured, is between the unlearned and the acquired. In 
‘other words, a mode of consciousness or a reaction which has not 
been acquired is to be called instinctive, even if one cannot as yet 
prove it to be a race-activity, and even if one cannot prove it to 
be useful in the perpetuation or development of the race. In 
truth, the utility of an activity or experience is a trait too difficult 
of observation and demonstration to be named as primary mark of 
instinct. Accordingly, the definition of ‘instinctive action’ as 
‘something purposive but involuntary’* subordinates the funda- 
mental to the secondary character. 
* Wundt, ‘Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology,” XXVIL., § 1, 
Eng. tr., p. 395. Cf. Schneider, ‘‘Der thierische Wille,” p. 61, and James,

354 Supplement to Chapter V. [Page 
Yet, though the instinct be not defined as useful, it remains 
true that the constant result of biological study is to discover the 
usefulness of instinctive reactions. For the individual, indeed, 
an instinctive act may be useless or perilous — for example, the 
water hen flicks her tail before the undertail has grown white 
so as to serve as signal; and the insect dies in the act of laying 
her eggs; but for the race the instinctive activity is reasonably 
inferred, if indeed it is not observed, to be of use. And the utility 
of instinctive reactions is the presupposition of all theories about 
their origin. 
It should be added that many instincts are neither exclusively 
psychical nor exclusively physical, but what McDougall calls 
psychophysical—a combination of consciousness with reaction. 
McDougall indeed teaches that “there is every reason to believe 
that even the most purely instinctive action is the outcome of a 
distinctly mental process, one which is incapable of being de- 
scribed in purely mechanical terms, because it is a psychophysi- 
cal process, involving psychical as well as physical changes”’ ; ! 
but certainly McDougall does not disprove the occurrence of 
perfectly unconscious, unlearned reactions. He overstates his 
position, once more, when he declares that this “mental process 
. . . can only be fully described in terms of the three aspects of 
all mental process — the cognitive, the affective, and the cona- 
tive.” + For, though many instincts are of this complete type, 
surely not all are. McDougall, however, is clearly right in his 
opposition to the prevalent identification of instinct with me- 
chanical reflex reaction. 
II. Learnine 
Experimental testing of the ability of animals to acquire new 
forms of reaction has an important bearing on the question: 
how low in the scale of animal life does consciousness occur ? 
For the ability to modify instinctive reaction (where the stimu- 
lus to movement remains unchanged) is the severest criterion of 
the presence of consciousness. The experiments of Professor

SECTION VI. 
ATTENTION 
§ 1. For advocacy of the view that attention is elemental, the 
student is referred to Titchener, as cited below. Attention, or 
‘clearness,’ is, according to Titchener, ‘an independent attribute 
of sensation’ — that is, attention is codrdinate with sensational 
intensity and extensity, and thus (in the terminology not of 
Titchener, but of the writer) itself elemental. 
§ 2. A second difference between the teaching of Titchener 
and that of this book has been indicated in the last sentence. 
Titchener holds that attention, ‘sensible clearness,’ as he calls it, 
is purely sensational, —in other words, that we can attend to 
‘sensible objects only,’ to sights and sounds, never to our affective 
experience, our emotions.* The introspection of the writer does 
not confirm that of Titchener on this point. Unquestionably, 
prolonged attention to emotion as such, to one’s happiness or un- 
happiness, diminishes, perhaps even destroys, the affective quality. 
In the words of Maeterlinck, “il n’y a aucun bonheur dans le 
bonheur lui méme tant qu’il ne nous aide pas a songer % autre 
chose.” But similarly, attention to perception — as distinguished 
from attention to the perceived — is likely to destroy perception 
as such, that is, to turn perceiving into thinking. The truth is, 
that introspection is attention.t We must therefore be able, if 
only for a brief time, to attend to pleasantness and unpleasantness, 
else we should not introspectively distinguish the affections from 
their sensational accompaniments. 
* The question whether we attend to relations does not, for Titchener, 
exist, because he believes that the relational consciousness reduces to sensa- 
tional elements. (Cf. p. 364.) 
+ Cf. Titchener, of. cit., p. 175. ‘Psychological observation,” or intro- 
spection, means, he says, ‘‘attention to the phenomena.’ 
t For Titchener’s consideration of this point, cf. his Oudline, § 33. 
356
-P-A-G-E-381
  Appendix, Section V., §§ 1-2 357 
There is great vagueness and indecision in most discussions of 
attention, and many writers have recourse to unexplained meta- 
phors in place of scientific description, distinguishing the object 
of attention as ‘focus’ from the unattended-to as ‘margin,’ or 
‘periphery,’ or referring to attention as ‘crest’ of the ‘wave’ of 
consciousness. The reader is referred especially (1) to the dis- 
cussions of Wundt, in the “Lectures on Human and Animal Psy- 
chology,” XVII., the ‘‘Grundriss” (§ 15), and the “ Grundziige 
der physiolog. Psychologie,” III.>, 1903, pp. 331 ff.; (2) to C. 
Stumpf, ‘‘Tonpsychologie,” I., 67 ff.; II., 276 ff.; (3) to E. B. 
Titchener, “The Psychology of Feeling and Attention,” 1908 
(with bibliographies). 
The doctrine of Titchener has been briefly summarized. Wundt 
teaches the elemental character of attention,* or clearness, though 
not always froma purely structural standpoint. Stumpf’s opinion 
is that “attention is identical with interest and interest is a feel- 
ing.” Accordingly, he defines attention as “Lust am Bemerken 
selbst.” | He emphasizes the prolongation, through association, 
of the object of attention. The writer of this book has amended 
her former account of attention as mere structural element, 
being convinced that attention is a fundamental personal atti- 
tude. This is perhaps the real meaning of Kiilpe’s conception of 
attention as ‘condition,’ not element, of consciousness. 
In the forefront of discussion, at present, is the problem 
of the number of degrees, or levels, of attention. Cf. L. R. 
Geissler, ‘The Measurement of Attention,” Amer. Journ. of 
Psychol., 1909, XX., 473-529, especially 524 ff.; E. B. Titchener, 
op. cit., pp. 220 ff.; ‘‘Text-book of Psychology,” § 77, and 
p. 302. 
For discussion of the neural conditions of attention, cf. Titchener, 
op. cit., pp. 206 and 359 (Note 42); W. McDougall, Mind, 1903; 
M. Meyer, Psychol. Review, 1908, XV., pp. 358 ff.; 1909, XVI., 
* Cf. “Lectures” (cited above), Eng. Tr., p. 247: “It is as impossible 
to define the clearness of an idea as to define the intensity or quality of a 
sensation.”

AssOcIATION AND Memory 
§ 1. The following table states the relations between fusion 
and association on the one hand, successive and simultaneous. 
association on the other., The term ‘assimilation’ may, however, 
be used, as on page 65 of this book, to cover both the elemental 
and the complex form of simultaneous association. A simul- 
taneous association consists essentially in the persistence of the 
first term of a successive association. 
FUSION AND ASSOCIATION 
I. Fusion (of peripherally excited elements). 
II. Association (of terms, one or both of which are centrally excited) : — 
a. Simultaneous. 
1. Assimilation (of elements). 
2. Complex simultaneous association. 
b. Successive. 
For slightly varying uses of ‘these terms, and for further distinction 
between forms of fusion, cf. Kiilpe, “ Grundriss der Psychologie,” 
§§ 42 ff.; and Wundt, “Grundziige,” II, pp. 526 ff. 
§ 2. On the, classification of association as total or partial, 
cf. James, “The Principles of Psychology,” Vol. I., pp. 569 ff., 
578 ff., and “Psychology, Briefer Course,” pp. 259 ff. For criti- 
cism of the older division between ‘association by contiguity’ and 
‘association by similarity,’ cf. F. H. Bradley, “The Principles of 
Logic,” p. 294; James, “ Principles,” I., pp. 590 ff.; M. W. Calkins, 
“ Association,’’ pp. 12 ff. For examples of association suitable for 
analysis, cf. this Appendix, Section XVII., pp. 403-404. 
§ 3. The study of the nature of associations, as these vary from 
time to time, and from individual to individual, has been carried 
on by experiments of two main types, ‘spontaneous’ and ‘con- 
359
-P-A-G-E-384
360 Supplement to Chapter VII. [Pages 
trolled.’ Spontaneous associations ‘are very readily studied 
through a simple experiment (which may indeed be performed with 
a whole class of students as subjects). The instructor pronounces 
a word, directing the students to write, as quickly as possible, 
a word or phrase descriptive of the first suggested image; next, to 
write a word (or phrase) descriptive of the second image sug- 
gested; and so on, for a given period — one minute, for example. 
The resulting series of associations is worked over by each writer, 
in order to discover the type of connection. Thus, the association 
of ‘swallow’ with ‘nest’? may be due to the writer’s interest in 
birds, the association of ‘nest’ with ‘boy’ may be due to his recent 
reading of a story of robbing nests; the association of ‘boy’ with 
‘blue’ may be due to the frequency of his repetition of. “Little 
Boy Blue.” Experiments of this sort are well suited for com- 
paring the associations and imagery of different individuals and 
groups. A child’s list of associations differs materially from an 
adult’s, a farmer’s from a sailor’s. Such a comparison is facilitated 
if the suggestive word is ambiguous — some such word, for ex- 
ample, as ‘swallow’ or ‘ball’; for the first word on a given list 
is likely to indicate an interest or occupation of the writer: Thus, 
a boy might write ‘nest’ after ‘swallow,’ while a physician would 
write ‘throat.’ 
In experiments of the ‘controlled’ variety, the subject is not left 
free to imagine what he will, once he has been started. Rather, a 
list of words is read him and he records his first association to 
each. The list is carefully selected, usually with a view to further- 
ing one sort of associations rather than another. The more 
serious experiments are carried on with one subject only, and the 
time of the association-reaction is measured, that is to say, the 
time which intervenes between the moment when the subject 
hears a word and the moment when he responds with the word 
thus suggested to him. Controlled association experiments of 
this type are nowadays used as a method of mental diagnosis. 
It is found that the association-reaction is lengthened, even against 
the will of the subject, when the suggesting word has to do with 
an emotionally interesting experience,

Professor Miinsterberg has proposed to test the connection of 
suspected persons with a given crime, by requiring them to in- 
dicate the ‘idea associated’ by each one of a list of words, and by 
including in the list words suggestive of the crime or its surround- 
ings. Similar experiments have been used in the effort to discover 
both from the nature and from the time of the associations the 
source and objects of the mental disturbance of the cerebrally 
diseased.

I. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF RECOGNITION 
§ 1. Experiments on the nature of the familiarity consciousness 
were planned and carried through by A. Lehmann (Wundt’s 
Philosophische Studien, Bd. VII., pp. 169 ff.). He tested several 
observers with a series of 66 odors, and found (in opposition to 
his own prepossession) that in 7 per cent of the cases the subjects 
recognized the odors without being able to name them or to connect 
them with other experiences. Similar experiments were carried

II. RELATIONAL ELEMENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
§ 2. The doctrine of elements of consciousness which are neither 
sensational nor in any sense coérdinate with the affections or 
feelings is upheld by psychologists of the most diverse schools. 
Herbert Spencer was the first to name and to discuss them,!* but 
his teaching attracted little notice, and thirty years passed before 
Ehrenfels rediscovered the Gestaltqualitdten,? and James wrote 
of the ‘transitive feelings’ of ‘and,’ ‘but,’ and ‘if.’* To-day 
two groups, or schools, and several individuals among Continental 
psychologists and a considerable number of English-speaking 
psychologists more or less unequivocally teach the occurrence 
of elements of consciousness neither sensational nor affective. 
There is, first, the school of Meinong,‘ Héfler,> and Witasek,*

which discusses relational elements under the names ‘fundirte 
Inhalte’ and ‘Gegenstinde héherer Ordnung.’ The second of the 
Continental schools is that of Kiilpe and the students and workers 
in the Wiirzburg Institut, Watt,’ Ach,’ Messer,’ Biihler,’? and 
others. Individual upholders of the theory are Binet,"' Stumpf ” 
with his doctrine of Gebilde and Verhdltnisse, Cornelius, and, 
finally, in spite of great divergence in terminology, Ebbinghaus “ 
and Miinsterberg.* 
Of writers in English, Stout,’* R. S. Woodworth,!? and the 
writer of this book,'® have most explicitly taught the occur- 
rence of these elements of consciousness, neither sensational 
nor affective, which are especially characteristic of what is called 
thought. Judd, also, describes concept and judgment in terms 
of relation; '° and Angell, in spite of his denial of literally image- 
less thought, seems to indicate by his term ‘meaning’ a relational 
experience.” 
It thus appears that the introspection of a score of psychologists, 
of different periods, prepossessions, and training, speaks un- 
equivocally in favor of the occurrence of elements neither sensa- 
tional nor affective. 
It must be added that this testimony has been fortified, in 
recent years, by the attempt to control introspection through 
experimental conditions. One of the latest of such investigations 
is made by Biihler, whose method —a modification of that of 
Marbe and Messer — is, in brief, the following: He puts to his 
subjects, trained introspecters, questions answerable by ‘yes’ or 
‘no,’ which are intended to excite their thought. After a ques- 
tion has been answered, the subject at once analyzes the con- 
sciousness preceding and leading to his answer. The questions 
are suited to the interests of the subjects. Illustrations are: 
“Can you reach Berlin in seven hours?” ‘Does monism mean 
the annihilation of personality?” The results of the investi- 
gation have been (1) the assertion in most cases by the observers 
that they are distinctly conscious of unsensational and non- 
affective experiences; (2) the apparent occurrence of some cases 
where no image, verbal or concrete, can be detected; (3) the
-P-A-G-E-388
  364 Supplement to Chapter VIII. [Pages 
confirmation of this introspection by the discovery that a subject 
often remembers not the images, but only the relation — say, 
of likeness or of opposition —in an earlier experience. Wundt*4 
has very sharply criticised the method of these experiments on 
the ground, mainly, that it involves disturbance of the subject, 
and that it does not admit of repetition and variation of the ex- 
perience to be studied. In the opinion of the writer, Biithler suc- 
cessfully meets this attack, appealing to the records of his subjects 
for evidence of their being undisturbed; and holding that repeti- 
tion and variation are, in fact, obtainable in the essential sense 
that questions of the same or of regularly varying types may be 
repeated. 
Woodworth’s method and results resemble those of the Wiirz- 
burg school, except that he confines himself to the study of com- 
parison (the discovery of equivalent relation), and that in one 
group of his experiments he offers concrete material — colors 
and forms — for comparison. Earlier experimenters have found 
traces of felational experiences in the course of investigations 
concerned primarily with association. The experiments, for 
example, by which Professor Gamble and the writer tested Leh- 
mann’s assertion that recognition consists in associated images, 
disclosed a large number of cases in which the consciousness of 
familiarity, occurring markedly earlier than any associated images, 
is, in the view of the writer, most readily described as relational 
experience. 
The criticism of the relational-element doctrine has, however, 
achieved one important result: it has effectively challenged the 
assertion that imageless thought occurs. For it is always possible 
to question the completeness and the accuracy of the introspec- 
tion on which this conclusion is based. And, as Professor Titch- 
ener* and others have shown, it is probable that introspecters 
have often overlooked the occurrence in thought, and in recogni- 
tion, of characteristic kinesthetic and organic sensational ele- 
ments. But the admission that thought and_ recognition 
contain ,sensational factors does not disprove the result of 
such multiplied introspection: that along with imagery, and often

in the focus of attention when one compares and reasons and 
recognizes, are elements neither sensational nor affective.

III]. Tue AppiicaTIon oF THE TERM ‘ FEELING’ 
§ 3. The term ‘feeling’ is nowadays usually employed to cover 
the consciousness of pleasantness and unpleasantness and any 
strictly codrdinate elemental experiences. Both Spencer* and 
James,} on the other hand, and more recently W. Mitchell,} refer 
by the term to any experience whatever, elemental or complex. 
This usage seems to the writer of this book highly convenient, 
because there is no other single word which can well be put to 
this service, whereas ‘feelings’ of pleasantness and unpleasantness 
may be termed ‘affections’ and grouped with any codrdinate 
experiences under the term ‘attributive elements.’ This general 
application of the term ‘feeling’ has, however, met with little 
approval, and accordingly the word is seldom used in this book 
except in the narrower sense.

“Mental Development in the Child and Race,” pp. 325 ff.; 
Royce there cited on p. 330; C. H. Judd, Journal of Philosophy,

§ 4. According to a recent theory, conception is identical ex- 
cept in function with imagination. That is to say, imagination 
becomes conception merely by virtue of associating similar images. 
On this view, no characteristic attitude or element is involved in 
conception ; and a given experience is conception, or generalization, 
not for what it is but for what it does. 
A very clear statement of this view is that of Professor Dickin- 
son Miller (Psychological Review, Vol. II., pp. 537 ff.). In the 
opinion of the writer, Dr. Miller is altogether right in this view 
that the function of conception is the association of similar images, 
but wrong in the denial of the structurally simple consciousness 
of generality which distinguishes conception. The suggested 
images are sometimes called ‘the meaning.’ Cf. I. E. Miller,

feeling (Affekt or Gemiitsbewegung) on the other. He then de- 
scribes unpleasantness as pain-sensation and pleasantness as 
faint form of the sensations of ‘itch,’ of ‘tickle,’ etc. This account 
is based mainly on the following considerations: (a) the alleged 
invariable unpleasantness of pain; () the alleged difficulty of 
assigning physiological conditions of pleasantness regarded as 
unsensational; (c) the belief that this account is less complex 
than other theories. No one of these arguments is undisputed.

6. THE TRIDIMENSIONAL THEORY OF WUNDT* 
Wundt includes in the group of the affections, or feelings, four 
elements or (rather classes of elements) codrdinate with pleasant- 
ness and unpleasantness. These four are: tension and relaxa- 
tion (Spannung-Losung), excitement and quiescence (Erregung- 
Beruhigung). Relaxation is opposed to tension and quiescence 
to excitement, as pleasantness is opposed to unpleasantness, so 
that we have three pairs of opposites, or, as Wundt calls them, 
‘dimensions’ of feeling. 
The arguments for this view may be summarized as follows: 
The Wundtians point out in the first place that emotional states 
differ, according to common consent, not merely as pleasant and 
unpleasant, but also as exciting or quieting, straining or relax- 
ing. Both melancholy and terror, for example, are unpleasant 
emotions, yet the first is quieting, or depressing, while the second 
is as clearly exciting. This purely introspective argument is veri- 
fied and supplemented by experiment. Alechsieff, whose experi- 
mental study is one of the best and most recent of those put forth 
by members of the Wundtian school,} stimulated his subjects in 
such wise as presumably to bring about emotional experiences, 
and recorded both pulse and breathing, and introspection. The 
introspective records first (1) clearly indicated the occurrence of 
straining and relaxing, exciting and depressing emotions; next 
(2) sometimes asserted the occurrence, in emotional experiences, 
of elemental consciousness other than sensations, pleasantness 
and unpleasantness; finally (3) seemed to show that pleasantness 
or unpleasantness may occur in combination with any one of the 
four other ‘feelings.’ In other words, the records indicated that 
in pleasurable emotion subjects were sometimes in a state of tension, 
butsometimes relaxed, sometimes excited, and Sometimes depressed ; 
and that in unpleasant emotion subjects were now relaxed, now 
strained, and now excited, again depressed. The objective results

of these experiments are summarized by Alechsieff in the follow- 
ing scheme adapted from Wundt:— 
    
  
  Pulse 
Retarded Quickened 
Strengthened Weakened Strengthened Weakened 
PLEASURE TENSION QUIESCENCE EAC Ee pA sess 
Quickened Retarded ended nals 
Weakened Strengthened 
Breathing | a 
The Wundtian conclusion from both sorts of evidence is the 
following: Experiences which are thus shown to be, on the one 
hand, introspectively elemental, distinct, and independently 
variable and, on the other hand, accompanied by clearly dif- 
ferentiated yet coérdinated circulatory and respiratory phenom- 
ena, are elements of consciousness belonging in a class together. 
Therefore tension-relaxation and excitement-quiescence form, with 
pleasantness-unpleasantness, the enlarged class of the ‘feelings 
(Gefiihle).’ 
This doctrine has, however, found little favor outside the nar- 
row circle of Wundt’s fellow-workers and students. Against the 
Wundtian arguments from experiment it is rightly urged that 
the outcome of experiment is far from conclusive in Wundt’s 
favor, and that even experiments undertaken from the same 
theoretical standpoint as Alechsieff’s issue in results of a very 
conflicting nature.* In default of experiment we are thrown 
back on introspection and, on this basis, the writer of this book 
agrees with the opponents of Wundt that elemental affective 
elements — or feeling-elements strictly coérdinate with pleasant- 
* Cf. Alechsieff, op. cit., p. 175? et al, for admission of the opposing results 
of experimental investigations of the breathing. For Alechsieff’s attempts at 
explanation, cf. op. cit., p. 207; also pp. 180-200. For the report of experi- 
ments carried on in the Cornell laboratory indicating, in opposition to Alech- 
sieff, that the alleged elements do not vary independently, cf. Hayes and 
Titchener, cited below.

  372 Supplement to Chapter XI. [Pages 
ness and unpleasantness — are not discovered in our emotional 
experience. Most of these critics attempt to reduce all four of 
the new ‘feelings’ to kinesthetic and organic sensations, but, in 
this reduction, they ignore the introspective testimony of Alechsieff’s 
subjects, which has at least the face-value of their own. In the 
opinion of the writer, the following conclusions are truer to in- 
trospection : — 
(z) Tension is reducible to attention, or clearness, plus the 
organic sensations which accompany attention. (The signifi- 
cance of this assertion varies, of course, with one’s doctrine of 
attention.) 
(2) Relaxation probably is merely the absence of strain. 
Alechsieff himself seems virtually to imply this.* So far as re- 
laxation is a positive experience, it seems to reduce, as Titchener 
teaches, to organic sensations. 
(3) and (4) The case is different with excitement and qui- 
escence (Erregung-Beruhigung). ‘These are complex, not ele- 
mental, experiences; and the distinguishing feature of them is 
neither the organic sensations — though these are present and 
significant — nor any new kind of feeling, but rather the vivid 
consciousness of doubtful future or of irrevocable past. In the words 
of Royce: “we tend to regard with restlessness whatever tendency 
involves our interest in immediately future changes. The emo- 
tions of . . . fear, of hope, of suspense are accordingly especially 
colored by restless feelings. On. the other hand, the feelings of 
quiescence predominate when . . . we regard the past.” 
This analysis of the Wundtian theory has led, accordingly, 
to the conclusion that Wundt is unjustified in his teaching of the 
two new pairs of feelings codrdinate with each other and with 
pleasantness-unpleasantness. Only one of the four, namely, ten- 
sion, is either elemental or —in any sense — parallel with pleas- 
antness-unpleasantness. Relaxation, a second of these alleged 
elements, seems to reduce to bare sensation, where the name 
does not indicate mere absence of strain. The other two, excite- 
ment and quiescence, are, indeed, as the Wundtians insist, un-

(1) Professor Titchener hazards the guess that the peripheral 
organs of affection are the free afferent nerve-endings . . . 
distributed through the various tissues of the body... The 
nervous excitations,” he holds, “will vary with the tone of the 
bodily systems in which they are set up, and that tone can itself 
vary only in two opposite ways.” 
(2) Professor Max Meyer argues that “if pleasantness and un- 
pleasantness are different in kind from sensation ... then 
the kind of . . . relation between nervous activity and pleas- 
antness and unpleasantness is likely to be ... different.” 
Accordingly he attributes pleasantness and unpleasantness to 
intensity of nerve current. He supposes that “while the cor- 
relate of sensation is the nervous current itself, the correlate of 
pleasantness and unpleasantness is the increase or decrease of

the intensity of a previously constant current if the increase ot 
decrease is caused by a force acting at a point other than the point 
of sensory stimulation.”

§ 7. The emphasis upon the occurrence in emotion of sensa- 
tional constituents — sensations due to heart-beat, dilation of 
arteries, breathing, and the like —is a contribution to psychology 
of Professors William James and K. Lange. Both lay such 
stress on this factor of emotion that they tend to underestimate 
or even to ignore the other structural constituents of emotion — 
the pleasantness or unpleasantness. It should be noted that this 
James-Lange doctrine stands in close relation to the conception 
of emotion as doubly personal. For precisely organic sensation 
is an important sensational factor in my consciousness of myself; 
and kinesthetic sensations of movement — of approach and with- 
drawal, codperation, and antagonism — are at least constituents 
of my consciousness of other selves.

sum of visceral and bodily changes in which it expresses itself

Varieties of Religious Experience,” p. 171: ‘The first thing the 
intellect does with an object is to class it along with something 
else. But any object that is infinitely important to us... 
feels to us also as if it must be swi generis and unique. Probably a 
crab would be filled with a sense of personal outrage if it could 
hear us class it without ado or apology as a crustacean. ‘I am 
no such thing,’ it would say, ‘I am Mysetr, MysEtr.’”

WILL 
§ 1. In support of the teaching, contrary to that of this book, 
that there is a structural conation element, cf. G. T. Ladd, Psy- 
chology, Descriptive and Explanatory, 1895, pp. 211 ff. 
It should be pointed out that I have abandoned the use of the 
term ‘volition’ to designate exclusively the anticipatory image 
regarded from the standpoint of the idea-psychologist. In this 
book ‘ volition’ is used as a synonym for ‘will.’’ A more impor- 
tant modification of my earlier teaching is the omission, from the 
enumeration of the unsensational factors of volition, of an expe- 
rience of dependence, or linkedness of future with present. A 
volitional experience of dependence is still insisted on, but is 
conceived as realized personal attitude to the future. 
§ 2. Professor Thorndike opposes the conception of volition 
which this book upholds on the ground that actions may be, 
and often are, performed without any antecedent image of them. 
“Any mental state whatever,” he says, “may be an impulse, — 
may take on the aspect of impeller to an act” ;* and he adds that 
“Dercepts, sensations, and emotions” more than “images and 
memories” impel action.* All this, doubtless, is true. Pro- 
fessor Thorndike rightly suggests that even an exhortation to 
choice, such as “Make up your mind,” may in actual fact result 
in an impulsive act and not in an act preceded by anticipatory 
image. Yet it does not follow that because an act may be impul- 
sively performed, therefore volition is identical with impulse. 
The truth is that there are two sorts of ideo-motor act: the more 
common impulsive movement which Thorndike describes, and 
the strictly voluntary act. A given action may be performed

either impulsively or voluntarily — either without, or with, an- 
ticipatory consciousness. Cf. G. Stout, Mind, N.S. V., p. 356’: 
“Volition is a desire qualified and defined by the judgment that 
so far as in us lies we shall bring about the attainment of the 
desired end.” 
§ 3. On will as self-activity, cf. J. A. Symonds, quoted by 
Cooley, ‘Human Nature and the Social Order,” pp. 169 ff.: 
“The main thing which sustained me was a sense of self, impe- 
rious, antagonistic, unmalleable. My external self was being 
perpetually snubbed, mortified. Yet the inner self hardened 
after a dumb, blind fashion. I. kept repeating, ‘Wait, wait, I 
will, I shall, I must.’ . . . This primal need of self-effectuation 
is the essence of ambition.”

SECTION XIV. 
Tue RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS 
§ 1. The scientific study of personal relations forms the most im- 
portant problem of what Professor Stern calls ‘psychography,’ the 
study of individual selves. In the effort to codrdinate such studies, 
the Institut fiir angewandte Psychologie has appointed a special com- 
mission (cf. Zeitschrift fiir angewandte Psychologie, III., Heft. 3). 
§ 2. Most of the current conceptions of religion are defective 
for one of two reasons: (1) Some of them are so wide that they 
do not serve to distinguish religion from other forms of immateri- 
alism. So, when Wundt says, “All ideas and feelings are religious 
which refer to an ideal existence,” an existence which fully corre- 
sponds to the wishes and requirements of the human mind,* he 
does not sufficiently distinguish religion from personal desire or 
from moral striving. (2) Over against these inclusive conceptions 
are those which unduly narrow the conception of religion. Thus, 
Schleiermacher makes of religion an exclusively emotional ex- 
perience when he defines it as “a feeling of absolute dependence 
upon God.” + And, on the other hand, Herbert Spencer confuses 
theology with religion, that is, philosophy with experience, when 
he conceives religion as “the recognition of a mystery pressing for 
interpretation.” { In opposition to these one-sided views: Professor 
Leuba’s words deserve quotation; § Religion, he says, is “com- 
pounded of will, thought, and feeling, bearing to each other the 
relation which belongs to them in every department of life.”

  The Religious Consciousness 381 
The writer of this book has modified her former definition of 
religion, as conscious relation of human to divine self, and now 
describes religion as conscious relation to being, or beings, re- 
garded as greater than the human self. This change has been 
made in order to recognize what Professor Leuba calls the ‘god- 
less’ as opposed to the ‘personal’ religions. It should never, 
however, be overlooked that even if the object of the religious 
experience is not conceived as personal it is always treated as 
personal — in other words, it is always the object of prayer, or of 
sacrifice, or of mystic adoration.

SECTION XV. 
ABNORMAL PsycHOLOGY 
Barely incidental reference has been made, in this book, to an 
important branch of psychology — the study of abnormal forms 
of consciousness. The neglect has been, it must be admitted, 
intentional. The ‘abnormal’ is simply that which diverges from 
the normal, and must therefore be studied from the standpoint 
of the normal consciousness. Obviously such a study can be 
undertaken only after one has concerned oneself with the facts 
and principles of normal psychology. 
This closing section will speak briefly of certain of the more 
important phenomena and forms of the abnormal consciousness 
—discussing, however, only non-pathological experiences and 
leaving out of account all forms of insanity, the abnormal con- 
sciousness due to cerebral disease. The abnormal phenomena 
to be considered are, in the main, the following: (1) perceptual 
hallucinations and illusions; (2) abnormal motor phenomena, 
usually known as automatisms; (3) abnormal suggestibility; 
and (4) abnormal dissociation. All these experiences occur in 
dreams, in hypnosis also, and in the waking life as well. We 
shall, therefore, first briefly study our dreams, shall next consider 
the state of hypnosis, and shall then discuss the abnormal ex- 
periences of our waking life. A final section will be devoted to 
a consideration of the veridical phenomena alleged to occur in 
all these states. 
I, THE PHENOMENA (EXCLUSIVE OF VERIDICAL PHENOMENA) 
a. Dreams 
Dreaming is consciousness during sleep. It is hardly correct 
to speak of it as ‘abnormal,’ for it is likely that every one dreams 
382
-P-A-G-E-407
  Abnormal Psychology 383 
at one time or another. People who declare that they do not 
dream have probably merely forgotten their dreams.* 
The essential likeness of the dream consciousness and the waking 
consciousness should first be noted, for it is often overlooked. 
All sorts and kinds of consciousness occur in dreams. A structural 
analysis will disclose not only visual and auditory, cutaneous, 
olfactory, and gustatory sensational consciousness, but affective 
and relational consciousness as well. It is indeed admitted on 
all hands that people remember and feel in their dreams. It 
is equally true, though more often disputed, that they think and 
reason and choose, though choice and reasoning are based on 
absurd premises leading to impossible outcomes. 
Yet, spite of the likeness of dreams to the waking consciousness, 
dreaming is characterized by three, at least, of the four abnormal 
phenomena which have been named. (1) The distinguishing 
mark of every dream is the fact that it is essentially hallucination 
or illusion.{ In my dreams I externalize unreal people and far- 
away scenes and impossible situations. The hallucination (or 
illusion) is doubtless due to the dissociation to which reference 
will presently be made. It remains uncorrected because of the 
lack of perceptual and habitual images with which to compare 
dream images. In the daytime the tendency to externalize vivid 
images is corrected by the incongruity of the image with the per- 
ceptual experience: the imagined apple tree in bloom cannot well 
form a part of the perceived winter scene. When, on the other 
hand, I am asleep with eyes closed, nothing contradicts the ex- 
ternality of the vivid image. 
(2) Dreams may be, in the second place, accompanied by motor 
reactions which, after waking, one is unaware of having made. 
Many people speak during their sleep — in all probability while 
they are dreaming; and sleep-walking is no uncommon occur- 
rence. Such bodily ‘automatisms,’ of which the waking self is

  384 Dreams 
unaware or forgetful, is called somnambulism when it occurs in 
sleep. 
(3) Closely connected with the hallucination is the dissociation in- 
volved in our dreaming. By dissociation is meant the interruption 
of ordinary habitual associations, the abnormal narrowing of our 
experience through the dropping out of images and memories 
which are normally present in the waking life. Such a narrow- 
ing of the ordinary consciousness has one (sometimes both) of 
two results. Either the remaining consciousness is more intense, 
or else other, more remote, imaginings take the place of those 
which have dropped out. The greater vividness of fewer 
objects is an explanation of the dream hallucination; the oc- 
currence of unusual imagery characterizes most dreams. On 
its neural side, dissociation implies what may be described, some- 
what figuratively, as a blocking of ordinary ‘association paths’ 
and a consequent damming up of cortical energy. This results 
on the one hand in the more intense functioning of the sense centres 
still excited, and on the other hand in the spread of the cortical 
energy through less frequently used ‘brain paths.’ 
It must, however, be noted that dreaming is not purely dis- 
sociative. On the contrary, dreams are connected in two ways 
with the waking life: they are due to past waking experience and 
they are remembered after waking. As regards the first point, 
most dreams can be traced associatively to a starting-point in the 
waking life; and some dreams even include specific memories 
of waking experience. Out of 194 of my own dreams, carefully 
studied, I found only 22 (11.3 per cent) in which I could trace no 
suggestion from the waking experience. Professor Sigismund 
Freud believes that the relation of dream to previous life is always 
emotional — that every dream is, in fact, a wish fulfilled.* In my 
* “Die Traumdeutung,” 1900, 1909. Dr. Freud offers as proof the care- 
fully analyzed and valuable records of many dreams, mainly his own. Un- 
questionably he shows that many dreams may reasonably be explained as 
fulfilments of wish. He does not, however, —in the nature of the case, he can- 
not, — show that all dreams correspond to actual wishes; indeed, he does not, 
in the opinion of many critics, successfully exclude the possibility that some 
of his own dreams might be otherwise explained.
-P-A-G-E-409
  Abnormal Psychology 385 
opinion this account of the dream unduly limits the forms of its 
connection with the previous life. But the fact of such connection 
is undeniable. 
Besides this connection with the previous life, dreams, as already 
stated, play a réle in later experience. We often remember our 
dreams; and are sometimes puzzled to know whether we have 
really experienced or dreamed some event. And yet, notwith- 
standing the connection of dream with waking life, dreams are 
also markedly dissociative, cut off from the ordinary waking 
consciousness. Thus, the dream self commonly adjusts himself 
without surprise to changed surroundings; he fails to imagine 
names and scenes whieh in waking life would certainly be sug- 
gested to him; and he may even forget his name and circumstances 
and take to himself a new set of characters. 
b. Hypnosis 
By hypnosis is meant a state in which one is abnormally in- 
fluenced by one person’s suggestions and abnormally unaffected 
by any suggestions of an opposite sort. Hypnosis is induced in 
various ways, as by ‘rhythmic passes,’ or by fixing the attention 
of the subject on a bright surface; but all these methods agree in 
directing the attention of the subject upon the hypnotizer and in 
diverting his attention from other objects. The hypnotic subject 
is deaf and blind to all that goes on about him, but keenly alive 
to every look, word, and movement of the hypnotizer.* In a 
word, hypnosis consists in abnormal suggestibility in a single 
direction, coupled with extreme dissociation — the dropping out 
of memories, images, and even perceptions which would normally 
be present. : 
The suggestion of the hypnotizer may affect both the bodily 
reactions and the consciousness of his subject; that is, he may 
bring about both automatisms and hallucinations. There are 
two main forms of bodily control. In the lighter stages the 
* Auto-hypnosis, or self-hypnotization, is not specifically discussed in this 
section,
-P-A-G-E-410
  386 Hypnosis 
hypnotizer affects, positively or negatively, the voluntary muscles 
of his subject, preventing him, by a command, from opening his 
eyes or inducing him to hold his arm outward and rigid for minutes 
at a time. More complicated acts may also be brought about: 
for instance, the subject may lift books from a table or may 
whirl several times round. In deeper hypnosis the involuntary 
muscle contractions, and thus the pulse and the secretions, may 
be affected. Structural bodily changes sometimes occut. There 
are, for example, well authenticated though infrequent cases, in 
which blisters have been produced by a hypnotizer who assured 
his subject that a'burning object would be applied to his skin. 
We may quote, in illustration, from Krafft Ebing’s account of 
his well-known patient, IIma S : “The experimenter draws 
with the percussion hammer a cross on the skin over the biceps of 
the left arm, and suggests to the patient that on the following day 
at twelve o’clock, in the same place, a red cross shall appear. . . . 
On the next day at eleven o’clock ... the patient wonders that 
she has an itching, excoriated spot on her right upper arm. . . . 
The examination shows that a red cross is to be seen on the right 
arm exactly at the place corresponding with that marked on the 
left side yesterday.” Later a ‘sharply defined scab’ is formed.* 
Hypnosis is marked, finally, by perceptual illusions and hallu- 
cinations. These may be positive or negative. A positive illusion 
may, for example, be induced if the hypnotizer, pointing to cracks 
in the wall, tells the subject that these are interlacing tree tops, 
thus suggesting the vision of a summer landscape. Or the 
hypnotizer may hand to his subject a cup of water, or even of ink, 
telling him that it is coffee. The subject drinks it eagerly, com- 
plains, perhaps, that it is warm, and shows by the expression of 
his face that he is quite unconscious of its real nature. Indeed, 
the alleged coffee may produce actual bodily effects, a flushed 
face, for example. These, of course, are instances of illusion 
brought about by means of an external object. Genuine hallu-

Cf. pp. 78, 96.
-P-A-G-E-411
  Abnormal Psychology 387 
cinations can also be induced: a subject, for example, will hear 
the sounds of a piano if they are merely suggested by the hypnotist. 
The negative illusions and hallucinations of the hypnotized sub- 
fect are far more difficult of explanation. The hypnotizer, for 
example, indicates some person who is present, and says decidedly, 
“This man has left the room; he is no longer present.” Forth- 
with the hypnotized subject utterly disregards the banished in- 
dividual, failing to reply to his questions, and even running against 
him. In like manner, the hypnotizer may suggest to his subject 
that he is unable to see or to hear or to feel pain. Pain-sensa- 
tions are not, however, very suspectible to suggestion, and the 
‘value of hypnotism as an anesthetic has been very much ex- 
aggerated. 
It has thus been shown that hypnosis is characterized by sug- 
gestibility, automatism, hallucination, and dissociation. In its 
extreme forms the dissociation and the new set of imaginings 
which replace the old seem to involve a loss of the normal per- 
sonality and a transformation into a new self. Thus, the deeply 
hypnotized subject, if told that he is Paderewski, talks about music 
and devotes himself to the piano. Krafft Ebing’s subject, Ima 
S , when it was suggested to her that she was eight years old, 
played contentedly for hours at a time with a doll, wrote an un- 
formed hand, and made childish errors in spelling words which 
she normally spelled correctly. The new personality may persist 
for a long period and recur regularly. One of the best-known 
cases is that of Janet’s patient, Leonie,* who “has been hypnotized 
by all sorts of persons from the age of sixteen upwards. Whilst 
her normal life developed in one way in the midst of her poor 
country surroundings, her second life was passed in drawing- 
rooms and doctors’ offices, and naturally took an entirely different 
direction. In her normal state, this poor peasant woman is a 
serious and rather sad person, calm and slow, very mild with every 
one, and extremely timid; to look at her one would never suspect 
the personage which she contains. But hardly is she put to sleep   
* Pierre Janet, “‘L’automatisme psychologique,” 1889, pp. 132 ff.

    388 Hypnosis 
hypnotically, when a metamorphosis occurs. She is gay, noisy, 
restless, sometimes insupportably so. She remains good-natured, 
but has acquired a singular tendency to irony and sharp jesting. 
To this character must be added the possession of an enormous 
number of recollections, whose existence she does not even suspect 
when awake, for her amnesia is then complete. . . . She refuses 
the name of Leonie, and takes that of Leontine (Leonie 2) to 
which her first magnetizers had accustomed her. ‘That good 
woman is not myself,’ she says, ‘she is too stupid!’ To herself, 
Leontine or Leonie 2, she attributes all the sensations and all the 
actions; in a word, all the conscious experiences which she has 
undergone in somnambulism, and knits them together to make 
the history of her already long life. To Leonie x [as M. Janet calls 
the waking woman], on the other hand, she exclusively ascribes the 
events lived through in waking hours. But it is the same with her 
second or deepest state of trance. When after the renewed passes, 
syncope, etc., she reaches the condition called Leonie 3, she is 
another person still. Serious and grave, instead of being a rest- 
less child, she speaks slowly and moves but little. Again she 
separates herself from the waking Leonie 1. ‘A good but rather 
stupid woman,’ she says, ‘and not me.’ And she also separates 
herself from Leonie 2: ‘How can you see anything of me in that 
crazy creature?’ she says. ‘Fortunately, I am nothing for her.’ ” 
The dissociation of hypnosis from the waking life is evidently 
not complete. The hypnotized subject remembers not only the 
events of former hypnosis but facts of his waking life. On the 
other hand, unlike the dreamer, he seldom remembers, after wak- 
ing, the experiences of the trance. Yet hypnosis, in its deeper 
stages, has a curious influence on the later waking life, known as 
post-hypnotic suggestion. The hypnotist, for example, before 
waking his subject, addresses him in some such fashion as the 
following: “To-morrow, at twelve o’clock, you will stop the clock 
on the stairs.” At twelve o’clock on the following day, the sub- 
ject, apparently in his normal condition, actually stops the clock, to 
all appearance on his own initiative, without remembering the 
suggestion of the hypnotist,
-P-A-G-E-413
  wh Abnormal Psychology 389 
It is obvious that the main value, as well as the chief danger, 
of hypnotism lies in just this susceptibility of the hypnotic subject 
to post-hypnotic suggestion. Physicians and ‘mental healers’ . 
who make use of hypnotism suggest to the patient that he is freed 
from disturbing symptoms, and that he will remain freed from 
them after waking. Not merely nervous diseases, so called, but 
all diseases and symptoms which have no anatomical cause have 
been successfully treated by hypnotism. 
In unscrupulous hands the ability to give post-hypnotic sug- 
gestions may, of course, be grossly abused. There are reasonably 
well-attested instances of crimes committed and of large sums of 
money given away, in accordance with post-hypnotic suggestion. 
In such cases the discovery of the guilty hypnotist is made difficult 
by the fact, already indicated, that the hypnotized subject so seldom 
remembers the events of the hypnotic state. The best authorities, 
however, agree in the conclusion that only individuals predisposed 
to criminal acts can be influenced to actual crime. 
It should be stated very emphatically that no person can be 
hypnotized against his will. Hypnosis is induced only when the 
attention is concentrated on the hypnotizer. On the other hand, 
the habit of yielding attention, like all other habits, is readily 
formed. It follows that a person several times hypnotized be- 
comes very readily susceptible. Evidently there is grave danger in 
a tendency to yield oneself to the exclusive control of others. For 
these reasons the hypnotic state should be induced only for serious 
purposes — to cure disease or to extend knowledge; and only 
persons possessed at once of medical and of psychological training 
should give hypnotic suggestions. 
c. Abnormal Experiences in the Waking Life 
(1) There are countless authentic illustrations of waking halluci- 
nations and illusions. The voices which called to Joan of Arc, 
the devil who used to argue with Luther, and the daimon of Sokrates 
are illustrations which at once suggest themselves. It is not always 
easy to decide, from the descriptions which we have of them,
-P-A-G-E-414
    390 Abnormal Waking Experiences 
whether these visions are illusions, that is, conditioned in part by 
peripheral excitation, or whether they are hallucinations, that is, 
conditioned by cerebral excitation only. Sometimes, however, 
the distinction is obvious. For example, the phantoms which 
haunted Charles IX. after the massacre of St. Bartholomew were 
hallucinations, but the image of Byron which appeared to Sir 
Walter Scott was a mere illusion, for the clothes of the figure con- 
sisted, Sir Walter discovered, of the folds of a curtain. 
Far more important as materials for study than these vivid, 
yet often confused and unverified, stories from which we have 
quoted, are the massed results of an International Census on Waking 
Hallucinations, made by the Society for Psychical Research.* 
The question on which this study is based is the following: “Have 
you ever, when believing yourself to be completely awake, had a 
vivid impression of seeing or being touched by a living being or in- 
animate object, or of hearing a voice, which impression, so far as 
you could discover, was not due to any external physical cause?” 
To this question, 27,329 answers were given, and of these, 3271, 
or 11.96 per cent, were affirmative; in other words, one out of every 
twelve of the persons reached by the investigation asserted that 
he had experienced hallucinations. This percentage, however, 
is, in all probability, too high to be representative, for the larger 
the number of answers received by any one collector of these 
statistics, the smaller was the number of affirmative replies. It 
follows that if the investigation were further extended, the percent- 
age would probably fall still lower.f Yet, with all allowances for 
overestimation, the fact remains that waking hallucinations must 
be commoner than many of us think. | Visual hallucinations far 
outnumber the others: of 2232 cases completely described, 1441 
included visual elements, 850 were partly auditory, and only 244 
were tactile. Most of these hallucinations related to people, living 
or dead, but a few represented angels or supernatural beings, and 
a slightly larger number were grotesque or horrible figures. About

one-twentieth of them were indefinite or indescribable. Persons 
between the ages of fifteen and thirty reported more than one-half 
the number of these illusions and hallucinations, and men reported 
only two-thirds as many as women, 9.75 per cent as compared with 
14.56 percent. The general conclusion of the Report is “that this 
apparent difference should, to a great extent, be attributed to the 
fact that men, among the pressing interests and occupations of their 
lives, forget these experiences sooner.” * 
Besides the involuntary hallucinations and illusions, there is 
the whole class of illusions which are voluntarily induced. These 
may be regarded as cases of self-hypnotization. The commonest 
method of bringing about illusions is known as crystal vision: the 
experimenter looks fixedly at a glass sphere, at a mirror surface, or 
even at a glass of water, until there appear pictures in its reflecting 
surface. The images which appear within these different crystals 
are usually reproductions of former experiences, and often of long- 
forgotten objects or scenes. One sees, for instance, a forgotten 
name or a room familiar in early childhood. The images, on the 
other hand, may be purely imaginary, as when Mrs. Verrall sees in 
her crystal} colors so vivid that they leave an after-image in com- 
plementary colors. The images. seen in crystals may be, finally, 
veridical images of actual scenes beyond the range of the normal 
vision of the crystal seer. f 
The phenomena of synzthesia, of which the most important are 
so-called ‘colored hearing’ and ‘mental forms,’ are sometimes re- 
garded as waking illusions. Colored hearing consists in the regu- 
lar sequence of a consciousness of some particular color upon the 
consciousness of a letter, a name, or a musical tone. A mental 
form is a regularly recurring imaged arrangement of serial terms — 
numerals, for example, or names of the months of the year — in 
some special form, perhaps in a circle or in a zigzag line. But 
these are, in great part at least, cases of vividly associated images, 
not illusions.

  392 Loss of Personality 
(2) Not only hypnotic and hysteric subjects, but many well 
and apparently normal people, exhibit the phenomena of auto- 
matism, that is, relatively complex bodily movement executed 
without the knowledge, or at least without the after-memory, of 
the normal waking self. The best-known form of automatism 
is automatic writing, and is of the following nature:* the subject 
provided with a pencil, and so placed that the hand which 
holds the pencil is hidden from his eyes, unconsciously responds 
to stimulation of the hand. If the hand be pressed three times, 
it will make three marks when these pressures are over; if the 
hand is guided and made to draw a single letter, it may go on 
to complete a word. Normal persons possess the rudiments of 
automatic writing, passively repeating uniform movements when 
the experimenter has initiated them, following the rhythm of a 
metronome, or even outlining imagined figures, and writing im- 
agined names. The significant feature of this- experience is 
the subject’s entire unconsciousness of the movements of his 
own hands. 
(3) In the waking life, as in dreaming and in hypnosis, dissocia- 
tion, that is, the loss of the old memories of the normal life, 
sometimes seems to involve a so-called Joss of personality; and the 
new complexes of imagination which replace the old seem to 
make up a new personality or self. Often the two personalities 
alternate; sometimes the new one supplants the old. An early 
instance is that of Ansel Bourne, a Rhode Island carpenter who 
disappeared in January, 1887, just after drawing five hundred 
dollars from a bank. In March of the same year a man who 
called himself Brown, and who, for six weeks, had been intelligently 
carrying on a small fruit and candy store in Norristown, Pennsyl- 
vania, waked as Ansel Bourne, in frightened ignorance of his 
surroundings. 
A more recent and more complicated case is that of Dr. Prince’s 
neurasthenic patient, Miss Beauchamp, who comes to herself after 
longer or shorter periods of forgetfulness to find that she has done

surprising things — broken appointments or walked unheard-of 
distances, that she is in strange situations, wound round and 
round and tangled in yards of worsted, for example. Sometimes 
she finds before her a note written to herself in her own handwriting, 
and on her own notepaper, purporting to come from another self 
which has taken the walks, broken the appointments, involved her 
in difficulties.* 
Il, THE EXPLANATION 
The most common explanation, nowadays advanced, for abnor- 
mal phenomena of consciousness, is the hypothesis, already sug- 
gested, of secondary selves, or personalities. Such a secondary 
self is variously known as sub-conscious or co-conscious, as sub- 
liminal or supra-liminal. It is conceived as a self other than the 
ordinary waking self, yet in some way connected with it. There 
may be several of these alternating secondary selves. Dr. Prince, 
for example, believes that the facts of Miss Beauchamp’s case can be 
explained only by the hypothesis of six distinct personalities, one of 
whom —the mischievous Sally who writes the notes and tangles her 
alter ego in the yarn — is entirely antagonistic to the main self. This 
hypothesis is believed to be necessary to account for the extreme 
forms of dissociation just illustrated; and the theory is then often 
extended to apply to other abnormal phenomena. ‘Thus, on such 
a theory, the dreaming self, or the hypnotized self, or the self who 
sees figures in the crystal, is the sub-conscious or co-conscious self. 
There is no time to discuss in detail the complicated issues in- 
volved in such a theory. The following comments are, therefore, 
dogmatically stated, though they run counter to the view of many 
psychologists: The majority of so-called abnormal phenomena are 
perfectly well explained without recourse to a secondary self hy- 
pothesis. It has appeared already that dream illusions are the 
natural result of the dissociation natural in sleep. It is likewise 
obvious that abnormal automatisms are extreme instances of the 
natural outcome of consciousness in action, and of the anatomical 
unity of afferent and efferent processes. Hypnosis, also, strik-

  304 The Secondary Self 
ingly as it differs from the waking state is, after all, essentially an 
exaggerated form of the suggestibility which makes everybody, at 
least on occasions, imitate slavishly some dominating self. Up- 
holders of the subliminal self theory often admit the theoretical 
possibility of explaining many phenomena of dreams, hypnosis, and 
automatism, by analogy with the normal waking consciousness. 
They argue, however, that other facts, in particular, many phe- 
nomena of dissociation, require a secondary self hypothesis; and 
that continuity requires the explanation of all abnormal phenomena 
by the hypothesis essential to the explanation of this one group of 
them. This application of the principle of continuity is not be- 
yond cavil; but it is more important to question the premise of the 
argument. The writer of this book believes, with many psycholo- 
gists, that the phenomena of dissociation, even the most pronounced 
of them, have not been shown to differ, ultimately, from the fluctua- 
tions of mood and the alternations of memory of so-called normal 
experience. . I am elated to-day, to-morrow depressed; I am living 
to-day with the memories of my summer in the woods; to-morrow 
I have forgotten the very name of my forest retreat and am im- 
mersed in my workshop and its associations. The complete 
change of mood, the more absolute loss of memory, are but extreme 
forms of this normal dissociation. 
To state this differently: what I call my normal experience 
is a complex web woven of many strands of memory, that is, of 
series of connected images, each series distinct from the others; 
it is a composite of many distinct groups of interest and pre- 
occupation. I may regard these memory series and these vary- 
ing circles of interest as aspects of myself, or as partial selves, 
distinguishing, for instance, my professional from my personal 
self, my business from my family self or, perhaps, my frivolous 
from my strenuous self. So-called dissociation of self involves 
the peculiar prominence of some one of these lesser selves, or as- 
pects of myself, coupled with unusual forgetfulness of all that 
lies outside this circle of interest and memory. But whether or 
not the ‘secondary selves’ of the abnormal consciousness differ in 
kind or in degree from the partial selves, with their distinct
-P-A-G-E-419
  Abnormal Psychology 395 
memories and feelings, of the normal life, three statements must 
be made about them: — 
In the first place, the term ‘subconscious’ must not be taken 
as referring to a mysterious something neither conscious nor uncon- 
scious. There is no such middle term between the two: what is 
} not conscious is unconscious. By ‘subconscious’ should be meant, 
therefore, either the unconscious physiological process or the inat- 
tentive consciousness. In both senses of the term, ‘the subcon- 
scious,’ so far from being occult or mysterious, plays an important 
part in the normal experience.* On the one hand, all sorts of 
muscular reactions are performed subconsciously, that is, through 
unconscious reflexes, and one finds to one’s surprise that one has 
already wound one’s watch, or one goes to the front door only to 
find that one has already locked it. And, similarly each one of us 
is at every instant ‘subconsciously,’ or inattentively, aware of a 
multitude of facts in the environment — of the visual objects which 
do not excite the visual centre, of faint sounds or odors. The out- 
come of the inattentive perception is, not infrequently, an appar- 
ently sudden and unaccounted for image of name or date or event 
which one does not remember that one has ever witnessed or 
heard.* 
It must be insisted, second, that the dissociations of personality 
never involve, what they are sometimes said to imply, a loss of 
personality. This will be admitted by those of us who sometimes 
experience a doubling of the dream-personality. I dream, for 
example, of watching at my own sick-bed, and always I am identi- 
fied with one, if not both, these selves. And no matter what the 
hypnotic self forgets, the I-which-forgets remains. 
It should be noted, in conclusion, that the secondary self —in 
the extreme cases of changed personality — might be conceived 
not as an alternating or partial self, but as a self totally distinct from 
the normal self, though connected with the same body. This is 
an older view, yet it has modern support.

    396 Veridical Phenomena 
IM, VERIDICAL PHENOMENA 
Reference must be made, in conclusion, to so-called veridical 
phenomena — experiences of people, events, or things, which are 
beyond the limit of the normal observation or communication. 
Prophetic dreams, clairvoyant visions, mediumistic revelations, are 
the phenomena most commonly grouped under this head. It 
should be noticed, first of all, that people are very readily mistaken 
in attributing a veridical character to their experiences. Nothing 
is more common than the false impression, after an important 
event, that one has previously experienced it. Just as places seem 
familiar to us, when we have never seen them before, so we meet 
events, especially overwhelming ones, with a curious sense of hav- 
ing always known or expected them. More than this, veridical 
experiences may be due to information normally acquired, but for- 
gotten. For example, Mrs. Holland’s automatic reproduction of 
Mr. Myers’s epitaph may be due not to the fact that the spirit of 
Mr. Myers is speaking through her, but to the fact that, though 
she has no memory of the epitaph, she has read parts of his auto- 
biography.* It is, however, believed by careful students that many 
veridical phenomena are incapable of explanation, either through 
coincidence or through forgotten normal experiences, and that they 
presuppose an influence of self by self through other than the 
usual means of language and bodily expression. Such supra- 
normal communication between living persons is named telepathy, 
or thought-transference; and it is held by some that it may have a 
physical basis — ethereal vibrations of extreme minuteness due to 
changes in one brain and resulting in changes in another.t Alleged 
instances of telepathy are either spontaneous or experimentally 
induced. Under the first head may be reckoned, in the first place, 
the ordinary cases in which people who know each other well

and note his remark: ‘‘No such connection between thinking brains has been 
proved,” and his statement (p. 12) of the main objection to the hypothesis: 
the difficulty of conceiving such vibrations to be effective at a distance.

Abnormal Psychology 397 
make the same remark at the same instant, or respond, as we say, to 
unspoken questions. More impressive are the cases in which figures 
of absent people appear in dress and surroundings corresponding, 
as afterward discovered, with their position and surroundings at 
the time of the ‘vision’ or ‘message.’ Thus, Captain Beau- 
mont, in London, rises to greet his wife, who is wearing a ‘mauve 
dress,’ which he has never seen, at a moment when she, in Tenby, 
is speaking to friends of his absence.* Far more important, 
evidently, than the accounts of these ‘spontaneous’ cases are the 
records of experiments in thought-transference. The most impor- 
tant of these were carried out, in 1889-1891, under the direction of 
Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick and of Miss Johnson. In go out of 
617 cases one numeral, out of 81 possible, was intently fixated by 
the experimenter and correctly stated by the subject of the experi- 
ment, who was so placed that he could not see the numerals. By 
chance alone, only 8 correct statements would, presumably, have 
been made. The number of correct statements is reduced when 
subject and experimenter are in different rooms, yet is still too 
large to be attributed merely to chance. There are also a few 
cases in which one person, at an hour previously set, draws dia- 
grams or fixates an object which (in one instance four times out of 
ten) is reproduced or distinctly imagined by a person far distant. 
Similar communications, many people hold, are made to living 
persons by those who have died. The evidences brought forward 
for this conclusion are mainly (1) the occurrence of clairvoyant 
visions concerned with death; and (2) alleged communications, 
through mediums, from the dead. One may quote, in illustration 
of the first sort of evidence, the authenticated story { of Captain 
Colt, an officer of the British army, who had a vision on the eighth 
of September, 1855, of the kneeling image of his brother, a soldier 
who was then before Sebastopol. The figure had a wound on the

right temple. Captain Colt described the vision to the members of 
his household, and both his accounts of it and his statement of 
the date are substantially corroborated by his sister. A fortnight 
later he had news of his brother’s death on the eighth of September. 
His brother’s body had been found “in a sort of kneeling posture 
. . . propped up by other bodies, and the death wound was where 
it had appeared in the vision.” It is clear, however, that such 
cases do not necessarily involve communication with the dead, 
since one may suppose a telepathic message from living witnesses. 
Theevidence from alleged mediumistic revelations presents greater 
complexity. On the one hand, it is agreed on all hands that the 
great bulk of the abnormal physical phenomena popularly attributed 
to spirit influence — the table-tipping, phosphorescent lights, fra- 
grances, and sounds — are due either to automatic movements un- 
consciously performed by the mediums, or to their fraudulently 
concealed bodily movements, sleight-of-hand performances and 
mechanical devices. Records of the exposures of alleged mediumg 
furnish accumulating and incontestable evidence of these state- 
ments. On the other hand, several investigators, foremost in the 
exposure of these spiritualistic frauds, hold that there are instances 
of revelations through mediums which may be explained only as the 
direct communion of the dead with the living. Such is the com- 
munication said to be made through the medium, Mrs. Piper, to 
Sir Oliver Lodge by an uncle long dead, who related occurrences 
known only to one living person who was miles away and unaware 
of the ‘séance’ with Mrs. Piper.* More important is the evidence 
furnished in very recent years by the phenomena of cross-corre- 
spondence in which one automatist is impelled to write statements 
unintelligible to her, which are later understood through statements, 
by themselves equally unintelligible, written by another automatist. 
So, certain Latin passages written automatically by Mrs. Verrall 
on March 2, 4, and 5, 1906, were a riddle to her until the words 
“Ave Roma immortalis,” written at a distance, on March 7, by

Mrs. Holland, clearly referred the descriptions to Rome and to a 
picture by Raphael. The picture was well known to Mr. Myers, 
who — in the belief of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland, and others — 
is controlling their automatic writings. 
Three scientific attitudes toward this evidence are possible. 
A group of trained investigators, including the late Professor 
Sidgwick, the late Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Mrs. Sidgwick, and 
many others, believe that there is at least preponderant evidence 
of “direct supersensuous communication of mind with mind,” * 
and that this communion is not only between the living, but of 
dead with living. It should be added that even those who accept, 
more or less definitely, this conclusion do not assume to understand 
the nature and, above all, the strange limitation of the communica- 
tion; that they do not claim to offer a positive estimate of the 
value of the messages or to interpret their meaning. At most 
they hold that the fact of the communication is established. (2) 
Another group of psychologists includes some who admit that the 
“theory which assigns” the phenomena of cross-correspondence 
“to a controlling intelligence external to either of the two autom- 
atists must rank, prima facie, as a good scientific hypothesis.” + 
Yet these students hold that the “evidence . . . strong as it 
is, is inconclusive.” { Among these men who value the evidence 
on which the spiritistic hypothesis is based, while yet they reject 
spiritism, are those who accept the hypothesis of telepathy, supra- 
normal communion among the living. Mr. Frank Podmore is 
prominent in this group. (3) To a third group of psychologists, 
when “the question is. . . whether departed spirits enter into 
communication with living men by mediums .. . the scien- 
tist does not admit a compromise; ... he flatly denies the 
possibility ... the facts as they are claimed do not exist and 
never will exist.” § Even so-called telepathic communications 
between the living are, for these critics, explicable through un-

intended suggestions —for example, through ‘involuntary whisper- 
ing,’* or else the alleged communications only accidentally or 
superficially resemble the originals. 
In the face of this divergence of opinion, the duty of the lay- 
man is fairly clear. He will be theoretically open-minded, neither 
accrediting nor rejecting, uncritically, evidence brought forward 
on either side. But remembering the proved frauds in medi- 
umistic revelations, and the disagreements among experts, and 
noting the admitted ignorance concerning the nature and value 
of alleged veridical phenomena, he will never direct his own con- 
duct by consulting mediums, interpreting dreams, gazing into 
crystals, or playing with planchettes and ouija-boards.

  The Persistent Problems of Philosophy 
BY MARY WHITON CALKINS 
Professor of Philosophy and Psychology in Wellesley College 
AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY THROUGH 
A STUDY OF MODERN SYSTEMS 
Cloth, octavo, 575 pages, $2.50 net. First Edition, 1907; Second, 
Revised Edition, 1908; Third, Revised Edition, 1912 
“To expound the metaphysics of modern Europe is no light task, 
but Professor Calkins has accomplished it for the most part in a 
clear and scholarly manner. Beginners may read her ‘Introduc- 
tion’ with understanding; and even those who are weary with the 
confusion of metaphysical tongues will be interested in the freshness 
of her comment and criticism. The chapters on Descartes and 
Leibnitz are good examples of the way in which the history of 
philosophy should be written and the criticism of philosophy per- 
formed. . . . The exposition of Fichte is undertaken in such sym- 
pathy with that philosopher, that it is almost dramatic. No author 
writing in English has surpassed Professor Calkins in giving a clear 
and simple interpretation of Hegel, free from the uncouth language 
which disfigures most Hegelian commentaries. 
* * * * * * * 
“Professor Calkins not only criticises, but constructs, and sets 
forth her own doctrine with such ability that she should have a dis- 
tinguished place among contemporary Hegelians/'’—From The 
Nation, New York. 
“The historical and critical portions of the volume are written 
with a facile pen. Few recent treatises on philosophy have com- 
bined so constant reference to the sources with so readable an ex- 
pository style. The writer exhibits a comprehensive acquaintance 
with the history of modern thinking, at the same time that she 
exercises independent historical judgment. . . . Unstinted com- 
mendation must be given to the spirit of Miss Calkins’s work. 
Never has there been a fairer attempt to solve the difficult problem 
of evolving doctrine from historical analysis.’’— Professor A. C. 
ARMSTRONG, in The Journal of Philosophy. 
“Tt is exceptional in lucidity, candor, and the freshness with which 
it surveys well-worn doctrines. More than any Introduction to 
Philosophy with which I am acquainted, it will induce its reader to 
turn to the original sources, and to find pleasure in seeing Philosophy 
as it rises in the minds of the great thinkers. While the book is 
unusually attractive in style, and well fitted for popular use, it is the 
work of an original and critical scholar. The temper with which 
the history, of ‘philosophy should be studied finds here admirable 
expression.”—Professor GEorGE H. PALMER, Department of Phi- 
losophy, Harvard Waivetsttyt

An Introduction to Psychology 
Cloth, octavo, 509 pages, $2.00 net 
First Edition, 1901; Second, Revised Edition, 1905 
“The reader of this book is impressed, first of all, by the wide range of 
topics discussed. Most of the text-books on psychology do not attempt to 
cover more than one phase of the subject. If they treat of the normal con- 
sciousness of the developed adult, they do not attempt to do more than refer 
to the phenomena of abnormal mental life, or to the facts of undeveloped 
child life, or to the still more remote facts of animal consciousness, Miss Cal- 
kins, on the other hand, has given to all of these subjects a sufficient degree 
of attention to justify the statement that the book is a general text-book, 
covering all departments of this now complex science of psychology. 
“Tn the second place, the reader will find in this book a very great deal of 
attention given to what may be called the social phases of mental life. It is 
not merely the analysis of one’s own mental experiences, nor merely the 
explanation of one’s own ideas that we find here undertaken; there is also a 
full discussion of the ‘ relations between selves,’ or, to put it in other terms, 
of the facts and results of social interaction, and social consciousness.” — 
Professor CHARLES H. JUDD, in the Journal of Pedagogy. 
“A satisfactory college text-book . . . calls for lucidity of treatment, .. . 
accuracy of statement, and readableness. In these regards the present book 
is one of high merit. ... Those readers whose study is not assisted by 
explanatory lectures will appreciate the rare skill with which the author has 
translated abstract terms and concepts into concrete images and brought the 
formal discussion of mental functions into touch at every point with the 
literary expression of experience.” — Professor ROBERT MACDOUGALL, in The 
Psychological Review. 
“ Miss Calkins is an excellent guide to follow. Her arrangement of her 
material is admirable, her summaries come in just at the right places... . 
The whole field . . . is surveyed in a masterly way; comparative and abnor- 
mal psychology is treated briefly but with much judgment; a history of 
psychological doctrines is added.” — From The Scotsman, Edinburgh,

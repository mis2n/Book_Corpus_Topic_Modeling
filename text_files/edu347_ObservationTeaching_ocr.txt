EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
‘A SMALL manual on the observation of teaching 
will be welcomed by all those in the profession of 
education who are responsible for the inspection 
and the improvement of the teacher’s classroom 
work. Superintendents, special supervisors, prin- 
cipals, and training-school teachers will be glad to 
Ihave a convenient treatise which will offer some 
direct aid to the conscious appreciation of good 
and poor teaching. 
As things are at present, the observation of 
teaching is an activity pursued without much 
system. It is conducted without adequate pre- 
liminary or immediate intelligence, and the judg- 
ments to which it leads are not subsequently 
subjected to much critical thought. All this care- 
lessness must be corrected if we are to have a 
stable method of improving the practice of teach- 
ing, one free from dependence on personal in- 
tuitions and chance impressions. 
Of late we have made some very conspicuous 
scientific advances within the field of supervision. 
The profession has evolved standard tests of

efficiency in many subjects, and developed more 
or less accurate statistical means of measuring 
student achievement under given forms of in- 
struction. Yet no amount of zeal for scientific 
educational judgments can blind us to the fact 
that practically all these recent contributions to 
the science of ascertaining efficiency are long- 
range methods. However accurate these may be 
within the restricted fields they reveal, they are 
never an adequate substitute for the intimate 
personal observations of a competent supervisor 
who lives in the classroom and scans the whole of 
the educative life found there. Indeed, our con- 
temporaneous measurements reveal inefficiency 
pointedly and accurately, but seldom do they 
diagnose the causes and suggest the remedies. 
They require supplementation on the part of the 
wholesome and sane supervisor. 
Classroom observation must be systematic 
rather than impressionistic if it is to be valuable. 
Even educational officers of unusual power rely 
too largely upon what they may happen to see in 
the classroom, and what they may happen to see 
is determined in very great degree by the partic- 
ular educational doctrines and interests they may 
happen to have in mind at the moment. The 
antidote is to be found in an increase of thought-

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
fulness preliminary to the actual visiting of class- 
rooms, in the use of comprehensive classifications 
of facts to be observed, and in the development of 
a critique of observations. 
The need of an adequate preliminary theory of 
observation is clearly brought out the first time 
that a normal school student is sent to observe a 
lesson in the demonstration school. He scarcely 
knows upon what to focus his attention. He re- 
turns to the class in theory with a mind confused 
with detail, and he has no method of telling what 
he has observed save that of ordinary narration 
and description. In consequence, what he recites 
is without pedagogical significance. Too fre- 
quently such a condition remains uncorrected for 
a long period, and the time given to observation 
is practically wasted. The presentation of an 
outline of facts to be observed, with some dis- 
cussion of the same, at once gives definiteness 
to subsequent observations. If the instructor 
shows the additional wisdom of restricting the 
beginner to a small number of factors, the ob- 
servations of the student observer begin to be 
valuable. 
Even the mature and experienced school prin- 
cipal finds that a systematic plan of inspecting his 
school has great advantages. Ordinarily he is a

casual visitor. His moments of freedom fron 
office duties are likely to cover the same periods o 
each day. The classrooms nearest his office ar 
likewise favored. He scarcely realizes that he i 
not covering all the ground. In addition, lik 
every other mortal, he thinks of certain considera 
tions more often than others; these he watches, th 
others he fails to stress. A half-hour’s review of ; 
chart or outline of factors to be observed at onc 
redeems him from one-sidedness. He proceeds t 
watch ventilation, the voice of the teacher, or th 
social spirit of the classroom — items which h 
has overlooked for a month. 
' His work will be improved still more if he re 
solves to specialize on certain phases for a give 
period, passing on to others in turn. His in 
spection may be made by subjects for a time, thet 
by grades, later by aspects not ordinarily sug 
gested by grade and subject classifications. H 
will be surprised to note how much keener h 
becomes in his casual observations once he ha 
followed some systematic and specialized metho 
of observation. 
The manual here presented will suggest in : 
comprehensive way the factors which are to b 
observed in the classroom. It affords the basi

PREFACE 
OBSERVATION of teaching is considered an inte- 
gral part of the professional work in most train- 
ing-schools for teachers. Few definite outlines on 
the subject are available, consequently the work 
varies from carefully organized courses to desul- 
tory observation by students who are without 
specific plans or purposes. 
This manual has been an outgrowth of the 
work in a course in observation of teaching, and 
while in no way exhaustive, the outline aims to 
present in a very brief form the most pertinent 
problems. The manual is designed for the use of 
students in training, for the use of teachers who 
are desirous of analyzing the various elements 
in the teaching process, and for the use of other 
persons who are interested in the observation of 
teachers at work.

THE OBSERVATION OF 
TEACHING 
I 
THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM 
Mocs of our knowledge rests on observation. It 
is one of the necessary elements in the study of 
any science, and it is also a requisite in the pre- 
liminary preparation for the practice of an art. 
Its value in the study of the natural sciences has 
long been recognized, and its use is beginning to 
be extended in the investigation of the sciences 
of the mind. We appreciate the dangers of rely- 
ing on the testimony of the senses, but this error 
is usually caused by lack of skill on the part of 
the observer, by carelessness in considering the 
essential elements, or through failure to realize 
how fallacies may arise. 
Skill in observation, as in any art, is acquired 
by practice. Observation of mental phenomena, 
to be of value, must be exact and accurate. It 
requires patient endeavor on the part of a student 
to understand the means employed by a skillful 
I

teacher to realize the ends he wishes to attain in 
any class exercise. The observation of children, 
in order to note their reaction to mental stimuli, 
is valuable to one who is to enter upon the work 
of teaching. The opportunity offered for obser- 
vation of children in the institutions devoted to 
the training of teachers indicates the importance 
of the problem. 
In an investigation of the professional work 
that is given in the normal schools of this coun- 
try, the writer finds that courses in what is com- 
monly called pedagogy have two aspects; one, 
the theoretical and the other the practical. The 
former is called by many different names owing 
to the lack of a definite and consistent terminol- 
ogy in our discussion of educational topics. It is 
given under the guise of Theory of Education, 
Principles of Education or of Teaching, General 
Methods, etc. No doubt the subject-matter, 
method of approach, and the point of view may 
be quite the same in each, but the names are not 
indicative of this fact. Again, the subject-matter 
of two courses called by the same name may be 
found to be quite different in their nature. The 
other aspect, the practical, seems to be more def- 
inite in its terminology, as when we speak of 
observation and practice teaching we have defi- 
2

THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM 
nitely in mind what is being attempted, although 
the means utilized for this attempt may be some- 
what different. 
Of these two elements, practice teaching is 
more nearly standardized than is observation, 
but even here a great variation exists in methods 
of carrying on the work. The general plan, how- 
ever, is to have a small group of children taught 
by a student in one subject, under the close su- 
pervision of a critic teacher. The length of time 
that a student teaches varies from ten weeks to 
one year. 
The results of this investigation show consider- 
able agreement as to aims and purposes of obser- 
vation; the methods utilized for realizing them 
vary greatly. In some cases observation is con- 
ducted in organized classes following a definitely 
outlined plan, while in others it is promiscuous 
and desultory observation by individual stu- 
dents, following no definite outline. The first 
type of observation furnishes an opportunity for 
a student to become acquainted with the type of 
work he is preparing to do. It presents to him 
the situation in which he may see pedagogical 
principles applied, and it furnishes an ideal that 
may be reached by thoroughly trained, experi- 
enced persons; that is, if the right type of teach- 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
ing obtains in the classrooms observed. The 
second type of observation should have little 
place in any institution. The student who visits 
a class without a definite problem conscious in 
his mind rarely sees what it is hoped that he may. 
Often his attention is focused on the relatively 
unimportant and thus his observation may be a 
hindrance rather than a help. If the work has not 
sufficient content to be organized or outlined as 
are other subjects of study, it should be relegated 
to the scrap-heap with other obsolete subjects. 
Observation must justify its place in the cur- 
riculum of the professional school because it 
meets a particular need, because it fills a real 
want, because it makes a contribution to the 
training of teachers. Unorganized observation 
holds the place in educational theory that excur- 
sions occupied a few years ago in the teaching of 
geography and nature-study. It was popular to 
take classes on excursions to factories and manu- 
facturing plants, or on field trips, to see land and 
water formations, birds and trees, in the hope 
that something might be assimilated that would 
be of educational value. When a justification 
other than a pleasure jaunt was demanded, the 
advocates found themselves in a predicament. 
The result has been that we are conducting ex- 
4
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM 
cursions to-day, but before we embark on them, 
we realize that our plans must be definite, con- 
crete, and worthy. 
Before entering upon practice teaching, the 
‘student should be equipped with all the knowl- 
edge, both theoretical and practical, that is at 
the command of the institution in which he is 
trained. In practice teaching the student will 
tend to acquire the tone of voice, the poise, the 
habits of action in conducting the routine of the 
school, that will persist in his later work. We 
should strive, therefore, to inculcate the desirable 
habits at the very beginning of the work. It isa 
well-known fact that teachers trained along the- 
oretical lines may be cognizant of the principles 
underlying effective teaching, but yet revert to 
methods employed by teachers under whom they 
acquired the knowledge of the subjects they 
themselves are attempting to teach. Our problem 
is to relate theory to practice so that theory will 
function in controlling and guidirig practice. 
A teacher in training usually has courses in 
psychology, methods, child-study, which treat of 
the instincts and interests of children, and the 
characteristics of mental and physical develop- 
ment. These courses make a study of children 
and of subject-matter from a theoretical stand-

point. ‘The fundamental facts that are common 
to all children can well be given in this way, but a 
theoretical and abstract discussion of child nature 
will not present concretely to the prospective 
teacher, the living, virile, red-blooded, energetic, 
resourceful child, that we know and love. Chil- 
dren are the material with which the teacher 
lives,.and to understand and appreciate them, 
he must view them at first hand. Froebel gained 
his knowledge of the sacredness of child life, not 
from treatises about children, but by living with 
them. We no longer give textbook courses in 
science. A school that would teach physics, 
chemistry, or biology from a textbook without 
making use of the laboratory to explain and 
make real the phenomena that classes are study- 
ing, would soon fail to get support from the pub- 
lic. In our schoolrooms, we have available the 
best type of laboratory, and it should be as im- 
portant an adjunct to our courses in educational 
theory as is the physics laboratory to the lecture- 
room in that subject. This is a place where the 
arguments of economy cannot be offered as an 
excuse for its absence. Separation of educational 
theory and schoolroom procedure has existed be- 
cause the people who have exploited theory have 
had, in many cases, little knowledge of child life, 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM 
and the teachers of children have had no funda- 
mental theories in regard to their work. 
The apprenticeship system is faulty in that it 
does not give and develop principles that may be 
applied in changing situations, as there is little 
attempt to analyze the process. It is efficient in 
that it demonstrates, objectively, what is to be 
done and how to doit. To overcome the evils and 
to retain the good of this system, we are begin- 
ning to appreciate, both in the trades and in the 
professions, that it is desirable to learn the theory 
of the art or craft before entering upon inde- 
pendent practice. 
_ The teacher needs theory that establishes an 
ideal. He needs to observe a skilled teacher to 
appreciate the relation of the ideal to the prac- 
tical, and finally, when both aspects of the prin- 
ciples are clearly in the consciousness of the pro- 
spective teacher, he is ready to take charge of a 
school. If he is unable to make the adjustment, 
if his theory does not function in his teaching, if 
he cannot think through the subject-matter in 
terms of the students he is to teach, a further 
apprenticeship in observation of a skilled teacher 
is needed before independent practice should be 
permitted. 
In his preparation for surgery, the student is

given an opportunity and required to attend 
many clinics where he observes the skilled oper- 
ator. To supplement his training in the medical 
school, the young surgeon joins the staff of the 
hospital in order that he may have further ad- 
vantages in observation before practicing his art 
independently. He serves his apprenticeship in 
observing those skilled in the art he wishes to 
practice, so that the physical life of his patients 
may not be jeopardized. Is it not just as essential 
that the mental life be given as much considera- 
tion as the physical? If so, it would seem that a 
carefully outlined course in observation should 
be an integral part of a teacher’s training.

{THE PURPOSE OF OBSERVATION 
WE observe the performance of an act, either to 
appreciate the skill of the performer, or to gain a 
more complete understanding of his methods in 
order that we may be able to use them ourselves. 
Our pleasure in observing the skilled acrobat, 
professional baseball pitcher, or sleight-of-hand 
performer, is due to the satisfaction we derive 
from seeing one who is master of the technique 
of the art he practices. Our attitude toward an 
exhibition of one of these arts just mentioned is 
quite different from that of a person who is en- 
deavoring to become proficient in this art him- 
self. We are interested in the act itself, and not 
in the means by which the actor has been able 
to accomplish his end or act. The novice in the 
art gives his attention to every movement of 
the skilled performer, endeavoring to discover the 
exact relation that one part bears to another, the 
value of each part in the total act, and the con- 
servation of energy in the whole process. On the 
other hand, he is keenly observant of the loss of 
9
-P-A-G-E-22
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
energy due to utilizing means that do not assist 
in the performance. 
There is the same pleasure in watching a skill- 
ful teacher at work that there is in observing a 
skillful performer in any walk of life. Owing to 
the organization of our schools, their isolation 
and the few really great teachers that we have, 
one rarely thinks of the school as a place where 
skilled craftsmen are at work. Because of the 
nature of the work, and the detrimental influence 
on the pupils, the school will never be a suitable 
place for enjoying the exhibition of the art of a 
skilled workman, any more than will the great 
surgical clinics. The work of the teacher will be 
observed for the purpose of showing the novice in 
a concrete way desirable ideals in the practice of 
his art. 
The skill of the teacher must be even greater 
than the skill of the worker in other vocations. 
The worker in all crafts is reasonably sure of the 
response he will receive, as the material on which 
he works is incapable of assuming a variety of 
forms. The problem of the teacher is much more 
complex, as he is confronted by a group of chil- 
dren whose mental content is anything but uni- 
form. Here we find the precocious child, the 
indifferent, the indolent, the slow, the deficient, 
10
-P-A-G-E-23
THE PURPOSE OF OBSERVATION 
the products of diverse hereditary influences and 
environmental conditions. It requires a master 
mind to analyze the elements in such a situation 
and to anticipate the manifold possible responses. 
Fortunately, children have more common expe- 
riences, and the range in their ability is more 
nearly the same than a cursory glance would 
indicate, otherwise the task of teaching children 
in classes would be well-nigh hopeless. 
The attitude of an observer toward a teacher’s 
work is affected by his purpose. One may visit a 
school to judge the effectiveness of the proced- 
ure, to commend. the desirable characteristics, to 
criticize and suggest means that would be more 
effective, to endeavor to find in the conduct of 
the work ideas that could be utilized elsewhere, 
or to see the mode of activity and the methods 
employed by a skillful teacher. These different 
attitudes are assumed by superintendents, princi- 
pals, supervisors, teachers, and students in train- 
ing. Superintendents, when not acting as super- 
visors, usually visit a school with the attitude of 
a judge to estimate the worth of the teaching. 
Principals and supervisors should view the work 
with the attitude of a helpful adviser who sees 
the situation in its wider relationship. The 
teacher who visits another should do so with an 
Ir

  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
open mind, endeavoring to find suggestions that 
will be helpful, and the student in training should 
have consciously in mind the relation between 
theory and practice. Each group is on the alert 
to see skillful teaching, and the questions they 
ask themselves as to the effectiveness of the 
instruction should be practically the same. 
The first group, — the supervisor, the superin- 
tendent, or the principal, — visits a class to see 
wherein a teacher is teaching in accordance with 
correct pedagogical principles, to note wherein 
he is sincere, enthusiastic, well prepared, con- 
siderate of the children, sympathetic, well poised, 
firm. He notes the points in which that teacher 
is strong, where the source of his greatest possi- 
bilities lies, what his undeveloped potentialities 
are, and he considers ways and means whereby 
the teacher’s ambition and aspirations may be 
aroused to realize his possibilities. The super- 
visor must be judged by his ability to develop 
and inspire his teachers and not merely by his 
knowledge of the factors that are involved in 
good teaching. The supervisor’s function as an 
inspector has been emphasized to such a degree 
that many supervisors are content to be inspec- 
tors of the teachers and classes they have in 
charge. They are satisfied with their labors when 
: 12
-P-A-G-E-25
  
THE PURPOSE OF OBSERVATION 
they have passed judgment as to whether or not 
the teaching meets with the standards they have 
established. The investigations that have been 
made of the work of such school officials lead one 
to question the general prevalence of any stand- 
ards for measuring the efficiency of teachers, but 
taking for granted that norms are used in measur- 
ing efficiency, the teacher’s work is not improved 
by inspection. 
The manager of a department store does not 
dismiss a salesman even though his sales are 
not what it has been anticipated they would be 
in that department, until he suggests ways and 
eans whereby that clerk may be made more 
fficient. The building contractor does not dis- 
harge his masons because they have not laid 
heir bricks with sufficient rapidity, but rather 
e suggests ways and means by which more may 
accomplished with the same expenditure of 
mergy. If his workmen are unable to act on sug- 
estions to secure the desired results, then, and 
ot until then, does he seek others. Should not 
he administrative officers in our schools be as 
nxious to bring to the attention of their teachers 
he principles of scientific management as have 
en the administrative officers in other lines of 
deavor? The supervisor should have a definite 
3
-P-A-G-E-26
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
idea of the purpose of education, he should hav 
a clear conception of the purpose of the schoc 
under his charge, and he should have distincth 
in mind the essential elements that he ought t 
find in each recitation he visits. Supervisor 
under these conditions are a help to their teach 
ers, because they are in a position to point ou 
both the excellent and the poor qualities in th 
recitation. The teacher in such a situation wil 
be able to use this criticism in improving hi 
work, for he can be made to see that his effort 
have been at variance with the standards of th 
system of which he is a part. Unfortunately 
teachers are frequently either complimented o 
criticized without being given the basis for eithe 
judgment. Teachers desire their work analyze 
and welcome a frank discussion with one who i 
prepared to assist them in their work. 
The second group interested in observation ar 
teachers in the field. They feel they can gai 
inspiration and assistance from observing thei 
fellow teachers who are confronted by the sam 
problems that beset them. The fact that ; 
teacher may be benefited by such visits, is recog 
nized both by school officials and by laymen 
Consequently, we find many cities grantin; 
teachers a certain number of days each year fo

  THE PURPOSE OF OBSERVATION 
the purpose of visiting schools. The teacher is 
granted his salary for these days, and they are 
usually called ‘‘ Visitation Days.” The teacher is 
benefited, no doubt, for he has had a change of 
scene, he has met new people, and the social in- 
tercourse has been stimulating, but the amount 
of good that accrues to the system of which he is 
a part, and to the children in his charge, is ques- 
tionable. If he is a teacher capable of outlining 
the problems he wishes to investigate, and if he 
uses his initiative in adapting results to his own 
use, such a visit will be profitable. However, if 
much good is tv accrue to a teacher from visit- 
ing other teachers, and observing their work, he 
ust, previous to such visits, have definitely in 
ind points upon which he needs assistance. 
In observing a lesson, one must not be satisfied 
getting an impression of the lesson as a whole, 
or be content until every part of the lesson has 
een analyzed, to see whether or not it measures 
p to standards in accordance with correct peda- 
ogical principles. A teacher who lacks this latter 
ualification may see devices that appeal be- 
ause of apparent results when they are incorrect 
in principle, and the apparent results may be in- 
dequate. Many fads in education are due pri- 
arily to the lack of a critical attitude of school 
15

officials and teachers. The vertical system of 
handwriting and the spiral treatment of arith- 
metic are examples of undigested thinking on the 
part of school people. 
The third group of observers — that is, teach- 
ers in training —is the most important. The 
child is the hope of our civilization, and if we 
can train his teacher aright, we are tapping the 
stream at its source. /‘This group-observes a 
teacher to see theory made real or vital. Teachers 
in training should see model lessons taught by 
exceptionally strong, resourceful teachers; they 
should appreciate essential elements in good 
teaching because of their courses in psychology 
and education. Such model lessons observed 
should be measured by the standards evolved in 
these basic subjects. A student is better able to 
apply a principle of psychology in his own teach- 
ing if he has seen it function in the work of a 
teacher he observes. The young surgeon receives 
theoretical instruction in ligaturing an artery, 
but it is not considered that this instruction is 
adequate. It is necessary for him to see compe- 
tent surgeons perform the act before he is ex. 
pected to do it himself. In the profession o: 
teaching we are too prone to take for granted, i 
we tell a novice how a class should be handled 
16
-P-A-G-E-29
THE PURPOSE OF OBSERVATION 
that he will be able to execute in accordance with 
our ideal. We forget the gap between theory and 
practice, between the ideal and the end accom- 
plished, between thinking how and doing. This 
class of observers, like the other two classes dis» 
cussed, needs a carefully outlined plan with defi 
nite, specific questions that are to be asked and 
answered about the recitation. It is the part of 
the teacher to get the right perspective, to be 
‘cognizant of relative values, to become conscious 
of the great field of opportunity open to him. , 
The previous discussion has been based upon 
the hypothesis that observation is one of the 
essential factors in the process of teaching. The 
position has been taken that a teacher’s work is 
observed by his superiors in order that helpful 
suggestions may be given, in order that he may 
be able to render more efficient service. We have 
assumed that teachers observe the work of fellow 
teachers to get suggestions and to see devices that 
may be adopted and modified to improve their 
own work. It has been taken for granted that 
students in training-schools should be required 
to observe skillful teachers so that theory may be 
exemplified in practice. The person who observes 
for the purpose of getting suggestions needs an 
insight that can recognize the vital elements, the 
17

relative worth, the originality, the initiative, and 
the sympathetic codperation between teachers 
and pupils in every phase of school life. The 
teacher who observes fellow craftsmen needs the 
insight that enables him to accept, adapt, and 
adjust the correct principles that will furnish aid 
in solving new problems. The student in training 
needs the insight that will enable him to acquire

THE VALUE OF OBSERVATION 
‘THE worth of observation of fellow craftsmen to 
one who is to practice an art must be judged by 
its influence on his attitude, ideals, and activity. 
For an adequate appreciation of-the problem 
confronting him, it is necessary to analyze the 
important basic elements of a craft, to investigate 
whether or not these elements can be seen, and 
whether they can be viewed in a perspective that 
will furnish a means for employing this experi- 
ence in his own practice. The value of observa- 
tion to the teacher will depend on his ability to 
utilize in his own teaching the essential factors 
that he has witnessed elsewhere. If we take for 
granted such ability, it is only necessary to point 
out the indispensable principles available to jus- 
tify its worth. 
To present the teacher with the actual situa- 
tion he will meet upon entering the service of the 
public schools, we shall need to have him observe 
the typical schoolroom, which will be something 
like the following: A group of about forty chil-

dren is divided into two classes taught by one 
teacher, usually a woman; the physical features, 
seating, lighting, heating, and ventilation, are 
passable; considerable blackboard space is avail- 
able, and illustrative material, maps, globes, 
charts, etc., is provided; while one class recites, 
the other prepares the lesson to be recited imme- 
diately; sometimes, between recitation periods, 
the teacher spends a few moments answering 
desultory questions. This, in brief, is the general 
type of situation in which our prospective teach- 
ers will be placed. In many instances, the condi- 
tions mentioned would be rather ideal. In a few 
instances one will find them even better. These 
conditions are not ideal, nor do they present the 
right model that we should wish imitated by our 
teachers; but they are facts that cannot be ig- 
nored by institutions that are training teachers 
for service in public schools. The teacher needs 
to understand and appreciate the conditions that 
he will meet in his first contact with his life-work, 
and he is improperly and inefficiently trained if 
all his observation has been of models that are in 
no way a replica of existing situations. Many 
training-schools are guilty of presenting to their 
students a hollow, imitation of the actual thing, 
impressing upon them its forms without realizing 
20
-P-A-G-E-33
  
THE VALUE OF OBSERVATION 
that the aid they are receiving will be as service- 
able as an evening gown in a berry patch. Some 
of our schools, realizing the futility of such train- 
ing as has been given in the past, are now pro- 
viding facilities that one finds in a good public 
school. In this way students meet a typical en- 
vironment that will be of assistance to them in 
interpreting public school conditions. 
A course in observation that is an integral part 
of a teacher’s training furnishes a standard of 
excellent work in an objective way. A model is 
then available that may be used by a teacher in 
measuring his own work. The importance of a 
model to imitate is appreciated in all phases of 
mental life. The child instinctively tends to per- 
form the acts he has observed performed by 
another. The acts that are novel attract his 
attention, and these are the ones he first en- 
deavors to make his own. The problem in train- 
ing children is to get the child to copy and 
emulate the model that furnishes the desired 
ideal. It may seem a narrow conception of edu- 
cation to hold that teachers should acquire a part 
of the technique of teaching through imitation, 
and it would be a hopeless outlook for the future 
generations if a large amount of educational the- 
ory should be formulated in this way. Neverthe-

less, certain ideals will be better impressed on 
most pupils by observing correct models. We 
know that teachers without professional training 
invariably teach as they were taught. The model 
imitated is usually the last or the most popular 
instructor. Sometimes it is a teacher who had a 
personality that appealed strongly to the student 
without any reference to his skill as a teacher. It 
is a well-known fact that teachers with profes- 
sional training revert, at times, to methods used 
in their earlier instruction, which violated correct 
pedagogical procedure. This fact is an indication 
that example is a powerful influence in shaping or 
moulding the work of a teacher. It points to the 
fact that observation of schoolroom work on the 
part of students in training should not be hap- 
hazard, but should be continued for a sufficiently 
long period so that correct models will be inter- 
preted in the light of educational principles. 
The craftsman in other lines of human en- 
deavor in his period of apprenticeship studies the 
work of the masters of the art which he hopes to 
practice. The great painters who have taught 
the technique of their art have first presented the 
fundamental principles, but before the series of 
lessons was closed, the student saw many demon- 
strations of the artist’s work. The sculptor dem-

THE VALUE OF OBSERVATION 
onstrates in his studio the method by which he 
secures his results. In the practical arts based 
upon a minimum of theory, the student is trained 
through doing, having first observed how the 
thing is done. Since observation is an important 
factor in most arts, should it be made an excep- 
tion in teaching? It is sometimes held that prep- 
aration for teaching does not require training 
in observation as every aspirant for a teacher’s 
position has been taught, and he needs merely to 
recall the procedure of his early experience. It 
would be just as plausible to say that because 
a boy has run races during his childhood, he is 
prepared to take part in a Marathon race. 
The model classes that a teacher will see during 
his period of training will be the standard by 
which he will judge his own work. A model lesson 
’ is theory objectified. It is just as important for 
a young teacher to see the theories, which have 
been presented to him, objectified, as it is for the 
child in the primary grades to have objects avail- 
able when he is being taught the fundamental 
facts in arithmetic. The model lessons, which 
the student sees taught by experienced and skill- 
ful teachers, are ideal in that they are beyond the 
accomplishment of the novice, but valuable for 
the reason that they represent a standard capable 
23

of accomplishment by an ambitious teacher. 
This will mean that the teacher who conducts 
classes for the purpose of demonstrating methods 
of presenting subject-matter must be both skill 
ful and resourceful — skillful because the tech. 
nique is being taken as a model which will be 
influential in forming the habits of his class, and 
resourceful in that he must be able to take ad- 
vantage of new and unexpected situations that 
cannot be anticipated. 
One of the problems that confronts the teacher 
is the proper organization of subject-matter, and 
the observation of a teacher skillful along this 
line should be of great value to a novice. Teach- 
ers trained in the higher institutions of learning 
tend to teach children subject-matter organized 
in the manner in which it was taught to them. 
The inexperienced teachers in our high schools, 
fresh from the university, are teaching courses in 
English, history, etc., with the same organization 
that was used in these courses in their university. 
Our elementary schools are not. affected in this 
respect to such a degree, but even here instances 
are not rare where the material taught is not 
adapted to the needs and abilities of the child. 
The organization of subject-matter is relative to 
the child that we are to teach. We have the sci- 
24
-P-A-G-E-37
THE VALUE OF OBSERVATION 
entific or logical organization that does not take 
into consideration the experience of the learner. 
McMurry indicates the place of logical organiza- 
tion of subject-matter by saying: “Attention is 
called to these facts here in order to suggest that, 
while the scientific and logical bases of organiza- 
tion are in common use, neither of them is ade- 
quate as the main basis of organization for a 
young student who is studying a subject for 
the first time. . . . It must be admitted that they 
are of great assistance in securing thoroughness 
of comprehension by their revelation of the re- 
lations existing among facts, and also that they ~ 
classify facts in a convenient way for finding 
them later; but they are of greatest use to the 
advanced student who is already supplied with 
motive and with standards for judging worth 
and who has proper habits of study already 
formed; they can well follow, but they should not 
supplant the psychological basis.” 
Owing to lack of experience with children, most 
young teachers follow the scientific or logical 
organization of subject-matter. It is necessary 
that a teacher have his material organized before 
he attempts to teach it. One of the prerequisites 
for students in professional schools for teachers

25
-P-A-G-E-38
THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
preliminary to teaching should be to have defi- 
nite problems assigned in arranging subject-mat- 
ter suitable for children. The student needs to 
observe children both in and out of school, to 
note their interests, capacities, and needs. The 
teacher gets the child’s point of view by reviewing 
in retrospect his own childhood and by studying 
the children under his charge. The teacher who 
observes children closely will say that they are 
pragmatic in their attitude toward knowledge. 
The child will study our shade trees from the 
standpoint of the enjoyment and value they are 
to us in the summer time, but he is not interested 
in the structure, the relation of various parts to 
each other, that is, the scientific classifications. 
In geography the child is not so much interested 
in man’s response to his physical environment 
as he is in comparing his life with the life of the 
people, particularly that of children in other 
lands. The organization of the subject-matter 
that appeals to him and holds his interest will not 
be the organization of the scientific geographer, 
but it will meet the needs of the undeveloped 
child. The subjects that are dominantly content 
subjects lend themselves readily to organization 
that appeals to children in their immaturity. 
The formal subjects also give a teacher an op- 
26
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE VALUE OF OBSERVATION 
portunity to consider constructive organization 
from the standpoint of motive. The teacher who 
appreciates the importance of the proper organi- 
zation of subject-matter has a conception that 
will be an invaluable aid to him in his work. This 
means, however, that he will know the type of 
material that best lends itself to development; 
the portion that he must emphasize, in order that 
its relationship to other fields of knowledge may 
be seen; the phase of the work that will help 
children to enjoy the beautiful in nature and in 
art; and he will need to make provision for that 
part of the subject, which to be useful must be 
habituated. If the children grasp the significance 
of the material, note the essential points, see its 
relationship to other facts, and realize that when 
organized and classified it is of future service, 
then we can feel that we have succeeded in our 
aim. Are teachers considering the importance of 
leaving with the pupils in their charge a body of 
organized knowledge, classified according to rela- 
tive values, specific aims, and present and future 
needs? 
The classroom is the best and only place for the 
teacher to study the responses of children when 
they are being taught. Owing to the faulty or- 
ganization of our schools, we may not see the 
a7

free, spontaneous, joyful expression of child life 
that we see in other environments, but we see 
here organized activities that represent the will 
and purpose of the school. This is the plane on 
which the children will be met later and, there- 
fore, most attention will be given to studying 
them in this environment. The normal class- 
room is also the best place to study the different 
types of children. In a random distribution such 
as we have in our public schools, we shall find the 
dull and the bright, the slow and the quick, the 
backward and the precocious, the strong and the 
weak, the retarded and the accelerated. The 
novice needs to see the slow child in the class to 
appreciate his needs: a theoretical treatise on the 
topic does not do justice to the problem. Again, 
the novice is often surprised to note how a skillful 
teacher adapts the subject-matter to the major- 
ity of the class. It is necessary, however, to call 
attention to the fact that a few members of the 
class are capable of assimilating more than is 
‘expected c of the majority of their fell fellows, a and that 
about an equal percentage will need special atten- 
tion if they are to comprehend fully the signifi- 
cance of the lesson. It is important for the ob- 
server to note what methods the teacher employs 
with these two groups, in order that they may be

THE VALUE OF OBSERVATION 
given proper consideration. Elimination of waste 
in education will mean that the groups at both 
ends of the normal distribution will be provided 
for in separate classes, but we need to realize that 
there is no hard and fast line of demarcation be- 
tween any of these classifications. The dull and 
e bright pupils grade insensibly into each other. 
‘he scales that are being tested and used will

epresent standards of accomplishment. In this 
ay, we shall be able to note what differences

A classroom presents the opportunity to see 
eoretical principles made real and vital. Much 
f our teaching is abstract, lacking realness and 
ence not serviceable in controlling values. We 
tate that the interest of all pupils should ‘be. 
roused in the lesson under consideration. If this 
erest ‘is not immediate, we should secure it by 
elating the facts to some value or need which the 
shildren feel. We may see that such an interest

may be inculcated by making use of the desire 
the pupils may have to emulate the standard set 
by the teacher. The way in which such illustra- 
tions can be made real, concrete, and objective is 
to see a teacher work them out with a class. They 
will] then become significant in the experience 
of the observer. It may not be possible for the 
novice to execute a similar plan, but he will have 
in mind a much clearer ideal of a process that has 
been demonstrated. Again, consider the prin- 
ciple that all pupils shall be active in the recita. 
tion. How can the manner of accomplishing thi: 
aim be better emphasized than by watching « 
skillful teacher? In many of the professiona 
courses which teachers pursue, the method o! 
presentation is mostly by lecture, and while the 
instructor is active the students are for the most 
part in a passive attitude, taking notes in a des. 
ultory way. To counteract such an influence 
stimulating models where pupils are thinking 
vigorously all the time are needed as a corrective 
to insure effective teaching later. : 
We are beginning to give more attention to thi 
social aspect of the school. Professor Dewey hi 
made the school conscious of its functions; con: 
‘scious that it is not an isolated portion of experi 
ence, but that it represents a real life situatio:

The classroom is a good index of the social life of 
the school. If the teacher is a dictator governing 
his class by 1 th ‘authority vested in him asa 
teacher, it will manifest itself in the mechanical_ 
responses in the classroom. On the other hand, if 
the teacher is an integral part of the group, muslin

where the teacher was the autocratic ruler, indi- 
viduality was repressed, initiative was deeoet 
and independent thinking was a crime. The 
model pupil was not the one who conformed to 
the conscience of the group, but the one who 
could and would obey without question the man- 
dates of the teacher. Under the newer conception 
of the school the pupil is guided by motives that 
find their meaning in the social conscience of the 
entire group. Is it necessary for us to ask which 
type of training best fits the pupil to take his 
place in the wider social environment outside the 
school? 
Observation of teaching will present many 
problems of significance both to the novice and 
to the one who has practiced the art: To both, it

THE TEACHER 
TuE tribute which Garfield paid to Mark Hop- 
kins is a conspicuous illustration of the influence 
of a powerful personality. Our continued em- 
phasis on methods and devices that will be a 
panacea for all our educational ills sometimes 
blinds us to the importance of the teacher as the 
most potent factor in the educational process. 
“Personality ” is an illusive term, and it connotes 
different ideas to different people. One may say 
that Miss B has a pleasing personality and he 
may mean several different things. However, in 
any case, he means certain attributes that are 
applicable to the person in question, but they are 
usually complex. He may mean that Miss B has 
a sweet, winsome face, that her features are cast 
in such a mould that she presents a pleasing ap- 
pearance, that she has good manners, is refined 
and cultivated, that her voice is soft, low, and 
sweet, her enthusiasm contagious, that she is 
sincere and wholesome, that her character is such 
that makes an appeal, or that her general appear-

ance attracts and holds the attention of any one 
who sees her. One may mean all these things and 
more. Or he may mean only one certain aspect 
in making the statement that her personality 
is pleasing. Probably to most people personality 
means merely good looks, beauty of form and 
feature, and the unfortunate condition in the 
teaching profession is that many teachers are 
selected on this basis alone. An attractive face 
may hold the attention for a moment, but if there 
is not a sterling character underneath, the at- 
tractiveness is no great asset. 
spires the children so that they will hes: He het their 
school tasks cheerfully and well, live in happy 
association with their fellows, and feel that school 
is a place where they may express themselves in 
a natural manner, then his score in personality 
should be high. Any teacher who wins the affec- 
tion of the child is beautiful to that child. We may be biased in our judgment of a person in 
meeting him casually, depending somewhat on 
our attitude at that time. It is impossible to tell 
the true character of a person by casual acquaint- 
ance. We can learn by observing the influence of 
a teacher on a group of children, and children are 
34
-P-A-G-E-47

as sensitive as an adult. They readily detect in- 
sincerity, carelessness, timidity, egotism, affecta- 
tion, lack of sympathy, and inefficiency in their 
teachers. The teacher who can impress the posi- 
tive virtues on the children so that they will be 
manifested in life outside of the schoolroom is the 
teacher who should be scored highest in person- 
ality. In judging the personality of the teacher 
we observe, we should note the relation between 
the teacher and pupils, the respect they have for 
each other, their codperation, their unity of aim, 
and the mastery of the tasks they have under- 
taken together. 
“The outward and visible sign of an inward 
and spiritual grace” is manifested through the 
teacher’s appearance, voice, and manner. To 
have the right influence, he should be possessed of 
good physique, in good health, without any no- 
ticeable deformity, should be businesslike, and 
dressed in appropriate taste, and not in the garb 
that fashion might require of its devotees, but in 
the dress that the conventional American feels is 
suitable for business hours. 
A teacher with a pleasing, clear-toned, well- 
modulated voice possesses an invaluable instru- 
ment of control. I recall a teacher who could 
always bring his class to immediate attention 
35   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
merely through the modulation of his voice, and 
the testimony of his pupils was that they en- 
joyed not the substance of what was said, but 
the music of his speech. A harsh, strident, high 
voice has a tendency to upset a class, making the 
keenly sensitive children irritable, noisy, and dis- 
orderly. Our training schools for teachers place 
too little emphasis upon voice culture. 
The manner of a person is usually an index of 
his station in life, and the teacher expresses in an 
outward way his opinion of himself. His attitude 
toward his work tends to beget a like attitude on 
the part of his class. The vigorous, well-poised, 
enthusiastic, confident teacher gains the respect 
and confidence of those he teaches; whereas the 
teacher who is timid, vacillating, and nervous 
usually fails to get active codperation. Some- 
times the casual observer may be misled by con- 
sidering bluster as vigor, egotism as resourceful- 
ness, and stolidity as self-control. The list of 
adjectives under manner are suggestive, and the 
observer should note others that would be suit- 
able in describing a person. 
Many people think that the teacher’s person- 
ality is the sole factor in determining his worth to 
the community. As has been said, this is a very 
illusive term, and after the personal characteris- 
36
-P-A-G-E-49
THE TEACHER 
tics have been considered, we should proceed toan 
analysis of the work to see what factors contrib- 
ute to success. The personal characteristics may 
be wholly desirable, but if there is no dynamic 
force, if the teaching efficiency is low, the person 
would fail to become a vital factor either in the 
school or community and hence not be desirable 
as an instructor. The great influence of a teacher 
is in his work in the classroom as this, after all, is 
his particular sphere, and it is for his skill in this 
position that he is employed. There are prerequi- 
sites that the profession should demand for those 
entering it, such as a good character, intellectual 
capacity, preliminary training, etc. They should 
be considered fundamental, but beyond these the 
most important is skill in the classroom. The 
teacher needs to be an aggressive force in any 
class he teaches whether it be in the primary 
grades, in the university, or in any of the inter- 
mediary groups. Some teachers interpret ag- 
gressiveness as meaning to take the initiative 
on all occasions, repressing the pupils whenever 
originality manifests itself. The teacher of power 
is quick to seize any evidences of originality and 
direct them to constructive educational ends. 
We have little respect for the person who is un- 
able to perform the task for which he purports to

be prepared. This is as true of teaching as of the 
performance of an acrobat. 
Unfortunately, there is a type of teacher in the 
schools, that follows the line of least resistance, 
that does what he finds easiest to do, that follows 
mechanical routine, that could not deviate from 
this fixed orbit any more than could the mechani- 
cal toy. The springs of his being seem to becast in 
an inflexible mould as is the spring that controls 
the motions of the toy. He teaches as well this 
year as last, but will teach no better next year 
than he did two years ago; in fact, he gradually 
deteriorates with age as he does not have within 
himself the power to be rejuvenated. It is this 
static teacher who is the millstone about the neck 
of our educational system. These are the people 
who should be discovered in our training school, 
and guided into some other profession, where 
their talents will be of more service to the State. 
In analyzing our teachers in respect to their 
teaching power, we find a larger group neither 
among the dynamic nor static group, but among 
a group that, for lack of a better term, we may 
call mediocre. If carefully supervised and di- 
rected, these teachers get fair results. When 
problems are suggested they see their signifi- 
cance; when a new situation presents itself they

are able to recognize familiar factors, and to meet 
it by relating it to previous experience. They 
are not people we would choose to furnish an ideal 
solution to a problem, but we are, nevertheless, 
assured that they will not go very far astray. 
They do not see new problems that require great 
initiative, that require great resourcefulness, or 
that require independence in thinking, but they 
are able to aid in working out theories which are 
elaborated by other people with greater construc- 
tive ability, This is the type that we need to 
reckon with as the predominating element in our 
schools, as in all phases of life they comprise by 
far the largest group. Our aim should be to in- 
crease the number in the higher mode, to elim- 
inate all in the lower. It is desirable to do this in 
all phases of our civilization, but it is especially 
necessary in the group that is differentiated to 
take charge of the training of our future citizens. 
'The caliber of our teachers is, however, much in 
ladvance of our ideals of social service, and our 
opportunity for a superior product in the profes- 
sion will come only through raising our general 
ideas of social efficiency. 
The importance of the school as a social insti- 
ution is coming to be realized. With an increas-

the teacher’s problems of necessity increase in 
importance. His influence both on his pupils and 
in the community must be investigated in order 
to give a just estimate of the worth of his serv- 
ices. If the school is to exert the most desirable 
influence on its students, a spirit of codperation 
must exist. The students must feel that the 
school exists for the development of the social 
group. They must have respect for authority, 
but this authority must be the will of the social 
group rather than the arbitrary wish of an indi- 
vidual. Discipline will be administered from this 
standpoint. A person who does not conform to 
the group consciousness must be made to feel 
that he is out of harmony with the purpose that 
prevails. The ideals should be those of social 
service, and he is of greatest service who makes 
the greatest contribution. This does not pre- 
clude the ideal of personal efficiency, as personal 
efficiency finds its interpretation only through 
participation with the others of his group. The 
relation of the parents to the school will reflect 
to a great degree the ideals of the teachers in 
service. Again, the attitude of the parents will be 
reflected in the work in the schools. The teacher 
should endeavor to have the patrons feel that the 
school and home are institutions in a larger social

whole; that each has its specific tasks to perform; 
that each must be conscious of its relation to the 
other, and that through this relation both gain 
added meaning. This will mean that the school 
will be interested in all civic movements; that it 
is not always to be a follower or leader, but that 
it plays its own part and takes its place in all 
active movement for social betterment. This con- 
ception of the teacher’s duty is from the ideal- 
istic standpoint, yet our schools will never exert 
their just influence until teachers are conscious 
of the problem. The efficiency of the teacher 
should be judged from this point of view as well 
as from the standpoint of personality or teaching 
power.

THE PUPILS 
In our preliminary discussion we mentioned the 
importance of seeing children at work. By study- 
ing them at first hand, one appreciates their abil- 
ities, attitudes, and interests more clearly than 
when he considers these traits in an abstract way. 
Many elements influence the work and conduct 
of a group of students, and we need to consider 
specific points upon which attention should be 
focused in visiting a classroom. 
A study of the psychology of childhood will 
show that children of different ages must be ap- 
pealed to in different ways. Translated to the 
classroom this means that the problem of teach- 
ing children changes with their advancement in 
school. An obvious question will be whether or 
not methods employed are suitable for a partic- 
ular grade. In the primary grades, the children 
are confiding, impulsive, and lacking in social 
restraint; their attention fluctuates easily, and 
they soon become fatigued. As they advance in 
the grades, the power of self-direction should in- 
44
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE PUPILS 
crease. Concentration on a problem for a longer 
period of time should be expected, greater power 
of self-restraint should be demanded, increased 
ability to work with abstract ideas should be 
anticipated, and less emphasis should be placed 
on sense material. A dogmatic attitude is out of 
place with the child at any age. Appeal should be 
made at all times to the rational nature. 
A casual observer frequently is unduly in- 
fluenced by the appearance of a class. It cannot 
be used as a basis for conclusions that are valid. 
However, appearance indicates, to a great ex- 
tent, social status, nativity, age, etc. In ex- 
treme cases it is an index of intellectual caliber. 
Racial characteristics condition to a certain 
degree the response that one may exact from a 
group. The response that one gets from a viva- 
cious type from southern Europe will be quite 
different from that of the well-poised American 
child. The appearance of the individuals in the 
group will need to be considered by one who ob- 
serves a recitation; he needs to be careful that 
he is not making inferences that would not be 
justified by a careful study. 
The number in a class has a marked influence 
on the effectiveness of the teaching. A class of 
fifteen or twenty presents possibilities impos- 
45
-P-A-G-E-58
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
sible of accomplishments with one three times as 
large. In topical work only a limited number of 
students will be able to make contributions to the 
class recitation, and even if the mode of procedure 
is by question and answer it will be impossible 
to call on all members of a large class. The prob- 
lem of holding all pupils responsible for the ma- 
terial presented in a large class requires careful 
planning. To large classes, teachers are prone to 
present subject-matter in lecture form, and this 
method is not conducive to the best thought on 
the part of the members of a class. It is also 
more difficult to create an ideal social situation 
when the class is large. If to take an active part 
is an essential element in securing the best re- 
sults, a small class has the advantage. It is the 
give and take among students that makes class 
teaching more profitable. We do not know the 
size of a class which presents ideal conditions for 
the highest development of each member; the 
best opinion would seem to hold that fewer than 
twelve or more than twenty-five students in 
a class is undesirable for each to receive the at- 
tention that he should. This is a problem for 
experimental study, and until we have such data 
teachers must adjust themselves as best they may 
to situations in which they are placed. 
46 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE PUPILS 
A close examination of a class is required if one 
is to discover the sub- or super-normal. The 
average teacher is able to discover those individ- 
uals at both extremes; he is unable to make a 
valid judgment of the individuals near the border 
ine. The present-day trend in educational prog- 
ress indicates that we may hope for definite intel- 
ligence tests that will be of value to teachers, but 
the tests that have thus far been elaborated are 
imperfect, and much more constructive work will 
be necessary before the results of such tests can 
be considered as final evidence in the majority 
of cases. At the present time, the results in con- 
ventional school work are used as a means for 
testing the intelligence of the individuals in a 
ass, however faulty this method may be. 
Many cities are attacking the problem through 
e ungraded room, but the basis of selection is 
unscientific that the achievements are much 
less than they would be if the plan could be bet- 
er administered. The movement is valuable, be- 
ause it has aroused the public to an appreciation 
f the problem of giving to the child who is not 
ormal a type of education that will be condu- 
ive to his highest development. 
The response that one finds in a classroom 
rnishes one of the best means of judging the 
47
-P-A-G-E-60
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
efficacy of the methods of instruction. These 
responses show also, to a large degree, the mental 
characteristics of the class. We can observe the 
slow, the weak, and the strong; those students 
who are working independently of the teacher 
in advance of the class; those who are finding 
the work difficult; those who are hopelessly in 
the rear; those who are following, through their 
ability to lean upon others; and those who have 
ability but who are indifferent to the work of 
the class. The alert teacher diagnoses these cases 
and gives the best remedy in her power. For 
many, it means the repetition of the work; it 
should mean, in most instances, a special class. 
The problem of retardation is receiving consid- 
erable attention in most school systems, and the 
ungraded room is the means most frequently 
utilized to cope with the problem. A class may be 
composed of normal children but, due to faulty 
teaching, only a limited number are taking part. 
A teacher who is working to secure independence 
from her class will not be satisfied unless prac- 
tically all members are actually interested in the 
subject under discussion. The successful teacher

be taught that the fundamental problems should 
be to clarify and enlarge their knowledge of any 
topic under discussion. . 
The attitude of the class toward the teacher is 
a good index of the social efficiency of the school. 
Children may show a spirit of insubordination 
if the teacher has an individualistic attitude 
toward his work; yet a teacher who has a fund 
of sympathy, tact, and broad understanding of 
child life will secure obedience, respect, and good- 
will even from a class of children who have the 
influence of a bad environment outside the in- 
stitution. The attitude of the children in the 
room and on the school grounds will give a casual 
observer a fairly good basis for drawing conclu- 
sions as to the social atmosphere that prevails. 
Both the teacher and the community should be 
conscious of this fact.

THE LESSON PROCEDURE 
Bota laymen and teachers think of each day’s 
work in the schoolroom in terms of lessons. The 
emphasis of the word “lesson” restricts and con- 
fines our thinking in regard to the broader aspect 
of the function of the school. We shall use it, 
however, in this discussion as it connotes a def- 
inite mode of procedure in the minds of people, 
when we are discussing the work of the school. 
We shall think of it as the series of reactions that 
one witnesses when he visits a class. On the one 
hand we have in mind the teacher and on the 
other, the pupils and their relation both to the 
teacher and to each other in getting control of 
the new experience that is being considered. This 
_ procedure will be analyzed from the standpoint 
of purpose, the means employed in reaching the 
desired goal, and the results obtained. 
In our teaching we wish either to broaden the 
student’s outlook through the presentation of new 
material, to habituate knowledge already pre- 
sented, to reorganize knowledge or experience 
5r
-P-A-G-E-64
  
THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
from a new point of view or in larger wholes, or to 
arouse desirable emotional reactions. Each type 
of lesson has a certain technique that demands 
consideration in a critical investigation of the 
teaching process. In a lesson period one may find 
more than one type, but the lesson as a whole 
should be dominated by a conscious purpose. 
For example, the purpose of a lesson in arith- 
metic may be the development of the meaning of 
per cent and yet a part of the day’s work may well 
be a drill on fractional equivalents. Again, one 
may wish to teach the appreciation of the poem 
“The Night before Christmas” to a second-grade 
class, and the plan of presentation will be the 
development of the broader conception here pre- 
sented with the child’s previous experience of 
Christmas and his idea of Santa Claus. 
Lessons should be analyzed first as to purpose, 
second as to the type made use of to gain control 
of this particular subject-matter, and third as to 
the elements that we should find in a properly 
presented lesson of the given type, the particular 
points of excellence, the place wherein it was 
inadequate, and the means that could have been 
employed to make it more efficacious. This last 
point needs especial emphasis, as too little at- 
tention is given to a constructive view of lessons 
52
-P-A-G-E-65
THE LESSON PROCEDURE 
observed. A student who has been trained to 
make constructive criticisms is in a better posi- 
tion to consider his own work with the same at- 
titude of mind. 
The lesson types are analyzed in slightly dif- 
ferent ways by writers on this subject; it would 
seem that practically all types of instruction are 
formulated when we consider development, in- 
ductive, deductive, informal; drill; appreciation; 
and review. Several writers include the recita- 
tion and study lesson as distinct types, but if we 
analyze the process carefully, we shall find that 
these two are rather, as Bagley says, “exercises 
involved in the technique of using textbooks.” 
In all recitations the teacher who secures re- 
sults in the day’s work is guided by a conscious 
aim, a specific purpose that serves to unify and 
concentrate the effort of the class. It would seem 
that this point is so obvious that it would scarcely 
be necessary to mention it; after one has ob- 
served much teaching, noting the aimless pro- 
cedure of much of it, he will find that constant 
reiteration of this point is in order. 
The teacher needs not only to have the specific 
purpose of the lesson in the foreground of his own 
consciousness, but he must also view it from the 
standpoint of the class. He must put himself, for 
53 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
    THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
the time being, in the position of the learner who 
is confronted by the conditions of the present 
situation. It is not always the person with the 
broadest understanding of a certain field of knowl- 
edge who is the most efficient teacher in this field, 
as oftentimes this may be a handicap. It is the 
teacher who has himself met the problems in 
securing control of knowledge that best appre- 
ciates the point of view of the one who first ap- 
proaches that field. We realize that a teacher who 
has struggled to acquire a language at the age of 
the people whom he is teaching, other things be- 
ing equal, will be the most proficient teacher of 
languages. Many times the teacher may havea 
clearly conscious purpose and fail to realize it 
because this purpose is not conscious to his class. 
They may be running in the dark, striking unfore- 
seen obstacles, for the lack of sufficient light. 
A clear, definite, concrete aim serves as a focus 
for holding attention, as a standard for the selec- 
tion and rejection of pertinent subject-matter, 
as a check for evaluating results. In observing 
a lesson, no matter what its purpose, the observer 
should be cognizant of the teacher’s purpose, as 
exemplified either through an explicit statement 
or through a procedure which shows without a 
doubt a clear, consistent aim. 
54
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE LESSON PROCEDURE 
One’s success in teaching is conditioned by his 
preparation. Occasionally there is a person who 
seems to see a situation intuitively; the great 
mass of mankind achieves through patient, ardu- 
ous effort. A teacher must plan carefully, seeing 
all difficulties that confront the learner. He must 
view them with the attitude of the one who first 
approaches the new obstacles. He must devise 
the most economical means of overcoming the 
handicap that confronts the layman. No matter 
what the type of lesson is being taught, a suitable 
approach is necessary. The approach or 
and we need to be cognizant of this fact, in ob- 
serving the teacher at work. This will be men- 
tioned under different types of lessons, but it is 
so important that it should be considered as a 
factor in every recitation. 
The basis for presenting new experiences, 
habituating facts, or securing emotional reaction 
is found in the relation that they bear to other 
modes of experiences. The need for the control 
of this new material must be felt if the desired 
results are to accrue. The elements that will be 
of assistance in interpreting the new experiences 
should be analyzed so that aimless effort is not 
expended. The preparation must be adequate and 
55
-P-A-G-E-68
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
enough amplification of the related matter must 
be made to intelligently understand the relation- 
ship. Much of the work in preparation is done 
haphazardly, but if the lesson is to be seen as @ 
unified whole, it is just as necessary that the work 
be logically done in the approach as in the pres- 
entation. 
The presentation, like the approach, will be 
conditioned by the purpose of the teacher. A 
drill lesson needs to be presented quite differently 
from a lesson for appreciation; the development 
lesson quite differently from a lesson for review. 
A teacher may be an excellent person to habitu- 
ate facts, but inefficient in arousing the necessary 
emotional tone in properly presenting a lesson 
for appreciation. Teachers do not always realize 
their shortcomings in this respect, and it is the 
duty of the supervisor to discuss and point them 
out. 
The approach should provide for motive that 
will function in the presentation, but the teacher 
should be conscious as to whether or not it is 
functioning throughout the lesson. The impor- 
tance of motive on the part of the pupils is rec- 
ognized by most teachers. Dr. Frank McMurry 
has dignified motive by including it as one of the 
four standards he used in evaluating the quality 
56
-P-A-G-E-69
THE LESSON PROCEDURE 
of instruction in his investigation of the New 
York City schools. He made the following state- 
ment: “Instruction cannot, therefore, rest satis- 
fied with cold facts alone. Its quality is to be 
measured partly by its provision for growth in 
motive. One object of teaching a pupil how to 
keep the skin healthy should be to arouse in him 
a desire to obey the laws of health. One object of 
teaching him to play games should be to make 
him want to learn more games, even throughout 
life.” 1 A teacher should investigate his work to 
find whether or not his pupils have this attitude 
toward school work. 
Instruction that does not call forth the inde- 
pendence of pupils fails in its purpose if self-di- 
rection is considered a desirable outcome of school 
procedure. Teachers are oftentimes prone to feel 
that so long as authority and responsibility for re- 
sults rest with them, the class is the passive agent 
to be moulded as they desire. If we believe that 
the mind develops through its own activity, the 
opportunity for self-expression must be given. One 
of the best classes the writer ever visited was one 
where the teacher was acting in the capacity of 
referee and the class felt the responsibility for 
carrying on the work. Recently a student re-

marked, “‘I get the most out of Miss A.’s class 
because she takes for granted that we have the 
ability to carry on the work ourselves.” This 
is the goal toward which we should constantly 
strive. 
Presentation without attention is a labor of 
Sisyphus. Attention of a class does not neces- 
sarily mean a desirable presentation, but unless 
it is secured we may be certain that one of the 
essential requisites is lacking. The methods of 
securing the attention should be noted; the means 
employed in holding it should be investigated; 
and the educational influence should be evaluated. 
The failure to secure it should be discovered, and 
the ways that this lack could have been remedied 
should be ascertained. 
Children enjoy working their own problems. 
The two-year-old child prefers to build his own 
block house rather than have it done for him. He 
will ask you not to supply the word in the nurs- 
ery rhyme that he has forgotten temporarily, yet 
how few teachers act on the assumption that 
children are capable of, or delight in, exercising 
this power. Many times when they do, they fail 
to give problems that are within the experience 
of the children they are teaching. The recitation 
should offer opportunities for clear thinking; the 
58
-P-A-G-E-71
THE LESSON PROCEDURE 
problem must of necessity be within the experi- 
ence of those taught. 
Logically organized material is often presented, 
but it lacks significance because it does not make 
the right appeal. Again, results are left in an un- 
organized mass because no specific purpose domi- 
nates the procedure or because the importance of 
organization is not understood. Material that is 
presented demands organization, not necessarily 
the organization of the trained scientist, but from 
the point of view of meeting the needs of a par-_ 
ficular class. The organization of material on the 
maple tree would not be the same in a class in 
nature-study in the normal school that one would 
find in a fourth-grade class; each organization will 
be equally valuable if adapted to the develop- 
ment of the topic in accordance with the needs 
of each class. 
A consideration of relative values bears a close 
relation to organization. If we are not interested 
in arranging facts, ideas, or principles, in accord- 
ance with definite standards, all material will be 
on the same level. If we aim to classify our 
knowledge in a proper sequence, we must give 
attention to values. Some of the subject-matter 
in each recitation is vital because of its broad 
significance and representative character, while 
59
-P-A-G-E-72
THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
much is merely detail. In life situations it isneces- ; 
sary to be constantly cognizant of relative worth, 
and the ability to recognize it is a desirable trai‘ 
that should be fostered. 
Many opportunities are given in the conduct of 
a recitation to make the work clearer through the 
use of illustrative material. This may be sup- 
plementing the material with some other of a like 
nature which is more representative; it may mean 
the use of experience from other sources which 
will make clearer the point at issue; or it may 
mean the use of concrete material which brings 
out in a striking way qualities that cannot be 
grasped through an abstract presentation. Prac- 
tically all schoolrooms are equipped with black- | 
boards, sand tables, maps, objects, etc.; rarely 
are they used to best advantage. In most in- 
stances a wide enough use is not made of these 
valuable adjuncts, while in other cases their use 
adds to the dependence of the class. In observing 
the presentation of a lesson, the use of this ma- 
terial should be carefully investigated and any 
criticisms noted. 
When the presentation of a lesson is finished, 
yne should trace the entire course, noting wherein 
the preparation was adequate, in what respects 
faulty, in what ways it lacked definiteness, and 
60
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE LESSON PROCEDURE 
what provision was made for a proper motive; 
how the pupils’ desire for self-direction was util- 
ized; what means were employed for holding at- 
tention and what point of view was the basis for 
the organization of the material; how material 
was classified as to relative values and what 
means were employed to make it concrete. 
The assignment is one of the most neglected 
factors in instruction, due largely to the failure 
on the part of the teachers to appreciate its sig- 
nificance. It has been the tendency for so long 
atime to view the recitation as a place where 
knowledge is tested that the assignment has 
meant merely telling the student his task. The 
newer conception of the study recitation has 
brought into greater prominence the importance 
of proper analysis of the work to be done. From 
this point of view a typical assignment, ‘Take the 
next four pages, read from the middle of page 
thirty-five to the top of page forty, work all the 
examples on the next two pages,” would have no 
place. The assignment ought, first, to present the 
problem that is next to receive attention; second, 
to furnish the motive for pursuing the task; third, 
to clarify the insurmountable difficulties per- 
taining thereto; and fourth, to show continuity 
of the plan in the subject under consideration. 
61
-P-A-G-E-74
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
If we accept the purpose of the assignment, we 
should grant that it ought to be an organic part 
of the day’s lesson. It is this relation that gives 
it meaning. The proper time to make the assign- 
ment will depend upon the nature of the subject; 
at times it may be well to give it either at the 
beginning or the close of the recitation, but the 
most vital assignments usually come through the 
problems that are raised during the development 
of the lesson, and then a few moments are taken 
at the close to summarize the problems which 
need further investigation. The amount of time 
in relation to the whole lesson will be governed 
by its nature. No arbitrary time limit can be 
fixed. Enough time, however, should be given to 
bring clearly to the consciousness of the class the 
essential elements that require further investi- 
gation. The assignment that is confined wholly 
to the textbook rarely provides a live, vital mo- 
tive. This does not mean the textbook should be 
discarded, but rather that a judicious use of it 
must be made. It is the teacher’s duty to impart 
the assignment so that it will be understood by the 
whole class. The test of the understanding cannot 
be made by the observer whose visits are not con- 
secutive, as the development of the lesson from the 
assignment will contain the proof of its adequacy.

VII 
THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 
THE development lesson has received more con- 
sideration from writers on methods of teaching 
than has any other type of teaching exercise. 
The writers on education who were influenced by 
the educational theories of Herbart made a great 
contribution to educational practice by making 
conscious the value of developmental instruction. 
These theories made the inductive type of devel- 
opment prominent and the implication of this idea 
failed to be understood. Hence many errors were 
made in the name of logical development. A 
reaction from the extreme. position that every- 
thing should be developed inductively combined — 
with a keener analysis of the teaching process has 
placed the development lesson in its true rela- 
tionship. The formal steps of the inductive 
method while improving teaching have in many 
cases tended to make it more narrow. One of the 
best statements we have of the place of the formal 
steps is given by Dewey: “It may be said that 
just because the order is logical, it represents the 
66
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 
survey of subject-matter made by one who already 
understands it, not the path of progress followed 
by a mind that is learning. The former may 
describe a uniform, straight-away course, the 
latter must be a series of tacks of zigzag move- 
ments back and forth. In short, the formal steps 
indicate the points that should be covered by the 
teacher in preparing to conduct a recitation, but 
should not prescribe the actual course of teach- 
ing.” ! 
The teacher’s skill in outlining effective tools 
in instruction will be demonstrated by the 
methods used in developing particular lessons. 
A certain lesson in geography may be treated 
inductively while in another lesson in this same 
subject, the procedure should be deductive. For 
example, in the study of wheat in the United 
States, it may be economical to develop the factor 
essential to its growth inductively, but when the 
production of wheat in Russia is considered, the 
principles already developed in the study of wheat 
in the United States will be the most economical 
mode of treatment. 
In the inductive lesson the problem needs care- 
ful statement. The pupil needs to know the 
situation that concerns him. His experiences that

  would bear upon it need to be aroused. He should 
feel that the solution will be worth while, of some 
value when the result is obtained. The data 
used must be representative and adequate. The 
teacher must guard against presenting data that 
require little thought on the part of the pupil, and 
again, must be alert to see that sufficient ma- 
terial is given to furnish an incentive for con- 
tinued effort. This is the point where develop- 
mental teaching presents the most difficulties. 
A teacher who has consciously in mind the devel- 
opment of a generalization may tend to present 
materjal that requires too little initiative on 
the part of the class, while the teacher who has 
thought of the development of independence on 
the part of the class may err in failing to give 
sufficient data to reach a conclusion that will be 
apprehended. 
The deductive development lesson has re- 
ceived less attention relatively than the induc- 
tive. It is complementary to the inductive, for 
the complete development of an idea or principle 
includes both aspects. The principle that multi- 
-plying the numerator of a fraction multiplies the 
fraction cannot be considered thoroughly under- 
stood until it can be applied to any fraction. In 
the deductive lesson, the problem needs careful 
68
-P-A-G-E-81
THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 
statement. The pupil needs to realize that he is 
confronted by a situation that demands investi- 
gation. He should feel that he has a basis for his 
own experience but that considerable effort will 
be required to answer questions satisfactorily. 
He should consider his data in the light of the 
principles at his command, make his inference 
and verify it. The teacher’s duty is to see that 
the principles necessary for the solution have been 
rationalized, that the inferences made are valid, 
and that they are thoroughly tested. 
When we have developed a type in accordance 
with the principles previously developed, we 
may find it necessary to redevelop a portion of 
the generalization’ with which we are working. 
Cancellation based on the principle that com- 
mon factors can be taken out of both terms with- 
out affecting the value was being taught to a 
class in fifth-grade arithmetic; ‘a part of the 
class had difficulty with the idea of the common 
factors and this was redeveloped inductively. 
Again, there are few lessons taught inductively 
which do not depend in part on known generaliza- 
tions. 
In his Methods of Teaching Charters discusses 
another type of development. He says: “For 
want of a better word, we use the term ‘informal’ 
69 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
to indicate those developments in which no con- 
scious use is made of explicit principles.”! As 
said above, it is a matter of course that both in- 
duction and deduction are implicit in every les- 
son, but in a great number of lessons we do not 
refer to them explicitly. This idea has rarely been 
conscious in the minds of writers who have dis- 
cussed the development lesson, but when one 
visits classroom work, observes development les- 
sons taught, and analyzes the method of pro- 
cedure, he will find that the larger number of 
development lessons are of this type. Again, 
quoting from Charters, “In literature at least we 
cannot always develop lessons either inductively 
or deductively, likewise in much of the work of the 
early grades, principles are not formulated. We 
must be willing to allow generalization to grow 
in part unconsciously.” ? This statement should 
be extended to include other subjects because 
there are very few subjects in the curriculum 
which are taught in this way. Nevertheless, they 
should be taught so that the generalization may 
grow rather than be formulated. 
The development lesson is one of the most dif- 
ficult school exercises for the observer to analyze.

THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 
This is due to its different aspects, to the fact that 
only segments are seen if the observer does not 
make consecutive visits, to the fact that few 
teachers are skilled in its use and also to the fact 
that it needs evaluation in reference to the sub- 
ject-matter under discussion.

VIII 
THE DRILL LESSON 
Mucs of our knowledge to be serviceable must 
be reduced to an automatic basis. Facts that are 
constantly appearing in various phases of our 
experience in the same form are most valuable 
when immediately recognized. In writing, one is 
greatly handicapped in expressing his thought if 
he must pause to attend to the spelling of the 
words he uses. In oral language one is handi- 
capped if he must stop to consider the conven- 
tional forms of speech. In everyday experience 
in numbers, one needs to be both rapid and ac- 
curate in the fundamentals of arithmetic. There 
are elements in practically every situation in life 
that should be habituated if efficient action is to 
follow. 
If people do not question the necessity of the 
value of being equipped with a sufficient number 
of habits to meet the exigencies of everyday life, 
they frequently raise the question as to the best 
method of securing the proper habituation.) The 
argument is made by many that the time for 
73
-P-A-G-E-86
THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING | 
proper habituation is when the situation where it 
is needed arises. The other point of view is that — 
the habits should be formed before the situation | 
in which it is necessary arises. The beginning of | 
the process of habituation should be found in a 
case of need, but rarely does this method continue © 
to function throughout the entire process. To 
become facile in a process and to acquire skill 
in its application requires much emphasis. The 
necessary emphasis is secured through drill. 
One of the essential elements in_drill is proper 
motivation. It is a difficult problem to secure 
motives that will appeal to a student so that 
he will continue his task until it is thoroughly 
mastered, particularly when such mastery means 
repetition in unvarying form. There is less waste 
of time and effort under proper motivation, but 
the situation that demands an automatic re- 
sponse must be mastered, whatever its cost. The 
teacher’s efficiency will be judged by his attain- 
ment of his aim in the shortest period of time. 
This condition is best achieved by motives that 
function throughout the process; many situations 
will arise where it is difficult, if not impossible, 
to secure such motives. 
The devices that the teacher uses to hold the 
attention are worthy of careful attention by the 
74
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE DRILL LESSON 
observer. The device must be’simple, Suited to 
the class, based-on accurate psychological prin- 
ciples, ddministered without waste, and>discon- 
tinued before it becomes monotonous. Many 
devices are so elaborated that a waste of time 
ensues when used. Again, they are sometimes so 
artificial that they are not representative of the 
true situation. Both extremes should be avoided 
in selection of devices. It is essential to have 
maximum attention in the process, and the de- 
vice should be considered from this angle. 
Habituation is frequently incomplete because 
drill ceases too soon. The first impression should 
be clear and] logical with careful presentation, 
for the first i impression is essential in retention. 
_ The first impression must be followed by many 
repetitions if retention is to be lasting. Drill 
should be continued until the desired skill at any 
stage of development is acquired. It should not 
be continued, however, beyond this point as it 
means a waste of time and energy. It should be 
remembered that the ratio of retention to time is 
an inverse one and that drill will need to follow 
closely the presentation if the greatest conserva- 
tion is to accrue. Some words in a spelling list 
require three times as much effort as others, while 
in arithmetic, all teachers know that some com- 
75 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
binations require more attention than others. 
The ability that a teacher shows in this phase of 
work will be a good indication of his ability to 
analyze his problems. 
A drill exercise is not an easy teaching exercise. 
It requires a teacher who is alert, vigorous, re- 
sourceful. It requires a careful analysis of the 
subject-matter, emphasizing the parts that pre- 
sent the greatest difficulty, giving less considera- 
tion to those which are relatively unimportant. 
It requires an insight into the psychology of at- 
tention and fatigue; the proper selection of de- 
vices that secure the maximum attention and a 
knowledge when the continuance of drill will be 
ineffective.

THE REVIEW LESSON 
THE purpose of the review lesson needs to b 
conscious in the mind of an observer if he is t 
profit by consideration of a lesson of this type 
Ordinarily, we find teachers confusing drill anc 
review. The confusion is caused by a failure t 
analyze carefully the two processes. Drill, as w 
have discussed previously, is given for the purpos 
of making automatic the elements in knowledg 
when the fact rather than the process is the neces 
sary element. Reviewis for the purpose of gettin; 
a new viewpoint, seeing the valleys through whicl 
we have passed from a higher elevation than wi 
have previously attained. It means reorganiza 
tion on a larger scope than our first endeavor; i 
means grouping subsidiary points about a cen 
tral one that comprises all the relations whicl 
could not be seen until the subject-matter ha 
been considered in its entirety. Knowledge is o 
use to the student when it is organized, and re 
view fails if it does not clarify, amplify, and re 
construct our old organization. 
78
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE REVIEW LESSON 
We hold facts in mind through the number and 
quality of their associations, and review fails if 
associations that we wish on a final view are not 
intensified. The proper organization of subject- 
matter is important, and we may have either the 
logical, organized from the standpoint of the sub- 
ject-matter itself, without respect to the needs 
of the students, or we may have the psychologi- 
cal, which represents the organization of subject- 
matter from the standpoint of needs, purposes, 
and aims. The final organization of the review 
lesson should be the organization of the subject- 
matter that will be of most value to the student 
in his later experience. 
The method of treatment may be topical, 
uestion and answer, or textbook. The topical 
eatment gives the best opportunity for testing 
roper organization. In the organization of the 
opics, important elements receive their neces- 
ry emphasis, while details have their rightful 
lace in the relation to facts. The test of one’s 
nderstanding will be his ability to show rela- 
ionship among ideas. The person who has no 
ommand of a given unit of subject-matter will 
end to have facts of unequal value assume the 
ame proportion. Hills will be as high as moun- 
ains, and the ant heap may be the residing place 
79
-P-A-G-E-92
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
of a behemoth. The topical recitation affords an 
opportunity for class discussion and elaboration, 
in important element in good instruction. Con- 
ceptions are clarified in this way, when this would 
not be the case through dogmatic statements by 
teacher or pupil. 
The question and answer method will find a 
place in all types of instruction, but a minimum 
use of this plan should be made in a review les- 
son. Teacher and students will need to ask ques- 
tions to secure additional information, to secure 
tests for the validity of statements, or to test 
knowledge of facts. The standard for judging the 
value of questions in a review exercise will be 
measured by the value of a question as a means 
of organizing material. 
The larger number of lessons that we see taught 
in our school are recitations from textbooks. It 
is by no means the ideal type; if conducted with 
care and judgment, it is of estimable value. One 
function of the school should be to teach the 
students how to get information from books, 
and the judicious use of textbooks furnishes th 
best means that the teacher has at his command. 
Tf the textbook is used as the sole criterion, thi 
pupil will gain an exaggerated idea of the im 
portance of a textbook and his initiative, ind 
80
-P-A-G-E-93
  
THE REVIEW LESSON 
pendence, and originality will be atrophied. The 
textbook is the condensed organization of topics, 
and should be used in this sense, and not as an 
exhaustive treatise of any subject. The organiza- 
tion represents a general attitude that the author 
has in mind to meet many different situations. 
The teacher should have his students approach 
each topic with a specific aim in view, and the 
organization of his subject-matter should be such 
as to realize this definite purpose. The organiza- 
tion of the material in the text should not be ac- 
cepted unless the organization happens to fit the 
particular need. It should be used rather as a 
means to aid in the solution of the problems on 
which the class is working. If this attitude is 
assumed, one will not have a slavish attitude to- 
ward the text, nor will he have the attitude that 
the text is worthless, but rather the judicious 
attitude of mind will be inculcated, i.e., the selec- 
tion and rejection of pertinent material for his 
purpose. If the text gives a condensed organiza- 
tion of a topic, it is necessary that much ampli- 
fication be done. Material should be collected 
from all sources that are available and within 
the experience of the class. When this viewpoint 
is taken toward the textbook, the review of any 
topic will not depend upon the organization of

any text, but it will give a body of knowledge that 
will be serviceable in other phases of experience 
where the viewpoint is more often different than

THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 
Heywoop, in his book on the Lesson in A pprecia- 
tion, says the idea of the lesson in appreciation 
has been of rapid and quite recent growth and 
no single individual can be held responsible for 
its inception. One who examines the writings of 
those who have discussed this lesson will soon 
be convinced of the truth of the assertion. The 
eagerness with which teachers have sought in- 
formation on the subject indicates that it is an 
idea that has been half conscious in the minds 
of many people. Itis j rtant to arouse 
desirable emotional attitudes as it is to implant 
habits of right ‘conduct. The former being the 
purpose of the lesson i in appreciation makes this 
exercise as justifiable as other school procedure, 
The writers on this subject mention three as- 
pects — intellectual, social, esthetic. Those who 
emphasize the first phase consider any material 
valuable that makes appeal to our intellect as a 
system of perfect knowledge; thus, we find the 
mathematician has this attitude toward the field 
84
-P-A-G-E-97
THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 
of knowledge in which his interests lie. The at- 
titude of the devotee of pure science is another 
illustration of similar nature. Science makes its 
appeal to him not because of its relationship to 
human welfare, not because of the value of its 
application in solving problems outside his par- 
ticular realm, but because of its intellectual ap- 
peal. The value of the pursuit of knowledge for 
its own sake is being questioned to-day; never- 
theless, there is a group to whom the purely in- 
tellectual makes a strong appeal. 
The second phase, the social, makes conscious 
the ideals, the aspirations, and desires of the in- 
dividual in his relation to the social group of 
_ which he is a part. The necessity for this type of 
| appreciation is receiving increased recognition. 
This attitude is depicted in literature, in geog- 
raphy, in history, and in fact in all subjects that 
are based on or get their meaning from human 
life. The fifth-grade class that wrote the dialogue 
that supposedly took place at the meeting of the 
Pilgrim Fathers prior to the Boston Tea-Party, 
designed the costumes that the different patriots 
might have worn at this time, and took the parts 
of the various patriots, were in an attitude to 
appreciate the significance of this incident in the 
history of our country. The desired outcome is 
85 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
that the individual shall appreciate the social 
situation in order that he may be a contributing 
member of the social group. 
The third phase is the one that most people 
consider when the lesson in appreciation is men- 
tioned. The purpose is to arouse emotions in the 
presence of the beautiful in art, music, or litera- 
ture. Properly to appreciate and to secure the 
desired reaction from a great picture, an inspir- 
ing piece of music, or from a noble poem, neces- 
sitates an emotional tone. A cold intellectual 
state may serve to analyze the different elements, 
but the entire being will not be suffused with the 
glow that comes when the emotions are aroused. 
The actor, the orator, and the preacher have long 
realized the necessity of arousing the emotions 
of. their audiences if they are to get a suitable 
response; the teacher has been slow to recog- 
nize the fundamental principle underlying such 
a procedure. Subjects such as music, or litera- 
ture, are frequently considered to be the only ones 
in which where the emotional setting is valuable, 
but many other school exercises offer admirable 
opportunities for arousing emotions, before the 
material can be adequately assimilated. 
The teaching of a lesson in appreciation de- 
mands both skill and imagination on the part of 
86 :
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 
the teacher. In the preparation for a lesson, it is 
essential to first prepare the class emotionally. 
The emotions that are aroused will, of course, 
depend upon the subject taught. If it is a master- 
piece of art, the fundamental principles underly- 
ing the work may need some elaboration. If it is 
a piece of music, there must be sufficient training 
of the ear to give a basis for the interpretation 
of the selection. The question often arises as to. 
whether teaching should be direct or indirect. 
Should the beautiful picture or beautiful music 
be left to make its own appeal, or should there 
be an interpretation by one who is more skilled 
in the technique of the art? If we believed in the 
indirect being sufficient, there would be little 
justification for this type of lesson, but most 
people will agree with Heywood when he says: 
“Pictures hanging silently in the classroom or 
music played without comments or discussion 
have not much influence of any kind upon taste 
or character. If, indeed, they have exerted a very 
large influence, the esthetic outlook from mod- 
ern nations would be gloomy in the extreme; for, 
presumably bad pictures and bad music would 
then also be tremendously influential on taste 
and character, and the sights of our ugly streets 
and the banal music of our halls would be caus- 
87
-P-A-G-E-100
THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
ing, every day, a fatal deterioration in taste.” 4 
The significance of the material is appreciated 
through the explanation of an interpreter, but, on 
the other hand, the class must be actively think- 
ing of the subject in hand. It is difficult for 
teachers to find the golden mean where technique 
is sufficiently utilized to explain and interpret 
the masterpiece. Some teachers emphasize tech- 
nique to such a degree that the exercise is purely 
formal and there is not the emotional reaction 
that is the end point in the exercise. It is used as 
an end in itself, and their class is acquiring the 
mechanics without substance. A person may be 
trained in music so that his sensibilities are stirred 
by a false note, but the grandeur of the selection 
as a whole has little appreciable meaning. On the 
other hand, we find some advocates of appre- 
ciation holding that technique has no place; that 
the persons without any technical knowledge of 
painting will gain as great an inspiration from 
a masterpiece as will one who is skilled in the 
art. This point of view is as faulty as the 
other, where technique is considered the prime 
element. 
The expression of appreciation is often misin- 
terpreted; words are accepted as a substitute for 
1 Lesson in Appreciation, p. 196, 
88
-P-A-G-E-101
THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 
an emotional reaction. A class that can glibly 
imitate terms used by a teacher is oftentimes con- 
sidered the one that has appreciated most deeply. 
Words oftentimes show how superficially the ap- 
peal has been made. The child who has said lit- 
tle about his appreciation of a great painting, but 
who gazes frequently in a contemplative way 
after the lesson has been given, has imbibed a 
much deeper meaning than the one who has glibly 
told why he likes it though he later never gives 
it a passing thought. 
The lesson in appreciation should have the ex- 
cellent points that one ought to find in a good 
development lesson. The teacher should have a 
definite purpose. He should know clearly what 
he proposes to accomplish. The children should 
be prepared adequately for the exercise. In this 
exercise, appreciation means largely the arousal 
of the emotions so that the material presented 
will be properly interpreted. The presentation 
should be clear and definite, giving sufficient 
opportunity for the children to use their own ini- 
tiative. Technique should be used for explana- 
tion and interpretation and not as an end in it- 
self. The value of the exercise should be judged 
by the influence that it has upon the group; by 
outward expression in conduct in the presence

QUESTIONING 
THE question, as a means of imparting knowl- 
edge, has been a subject of considerable interest 
to educators since the days of Socrates. Since 
it is such an important factor, we are at first 
thought at a loss to know why teachers ask so 
many poor questions; when we consciously en- 
deavor to frame several good questions that have 
a logical relation on any topic, we find that it 
requires clear thinking, careful planning, and con- 
siderable skill. 
We may tell our students in the theory and 
art of teaching that questions should arouse 
and stimulate thought; how many heed the ad- 
monition, how many in their own class practice 
the doctrine they preach? If, during a large part 
of their school life, our prospective teachers had 
been exposed to questions that required clear, 
consistent thinking to be answered properly, our 
problem of questioning would not be so serious. 
A question focuses the attention to the prob- 
lem under consideration. The question is the 
means of bringing the specific problem to con- 
gr 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
sciousness, whether it is a mere fact, a state of 
feeling, or a process of reasoning. It is a command 
that requires all available forces to be directed to 
the strategic position in the lines. A specific prob- 
lem holds attention and gives a means about 
which relevant material may be grouped. A 
question that does not furnish a center for fo- 
cusing the attention of a class has no place in 
instruction, and in observing a recitation, this 
point should be conscious in the minds of ob- 
servers in testing the validity of the questions. 
It is unnecessary to discuss the psychology of 
attention and interest, yet any factor that chal- 
lenges the attention will foster interest. This 
does not mean that interest will continue be- 
cause questions are asked, but it does mean that 
the teacher has an instrument in the questions, 
by which the work may be brought to the pupil, 
so that he realizes that it is his problem. When 
a child has no particular interest in a situation 
ecause he fails to see the relation to his own 
problem or or needs, skillful questioning on the part 
of the teacher is usually the most potent means 
by by which he sees the relation . to his own _experi- 
nce. When the questions in any recitation fail 
to arouse or hold the attention of a class, the 
recitation fails of its purpose.

QUESTIONING 
Good questions secure vigorous responses from 
pupils through contribution or by additional 
questions. If the recitation is to test the knowl- 
edge, the response will, of course, be conditione¢ 
by the excellence of the earlier teaching. If the 
teaching has been faulty and the questions suit- 
able, a response in the form of other questions 
will be secured. By his questions, the teacher 
stimulates the indifferent, the timid, the slow, 
and represses the impulsive, superficial child. 
Inde lependence in th in thinking may be encouraged 
by skillful questioning. A child who is naturally 
dependent, if constantly confronted by questions 
that require him to use his own intellect, his own 
experience in answering them, will, after a time, 
see that he has the power, the ability, the means 
within himself to solve his own problems. A 
teacher who will ask a class of children in a sugar- 
beet section how maple sugar is made, without 
having carefully taught the different methods of 
sugar-making, does not contribute to this end, 
but rather undermines this quality. The one who 
has, however, related the process to the one they 
already know through a series of skillful questions 
is encouraging the use of their own experience, 
without which it is almost impossible to develop 
independence. Skillful questions that encourage

  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
the right type of response and that foster ques- 
tions from the class will help to clarify knowl- 
edge. They indicate where and how misconcep- 
tions have arisen; what portions of the lesson 
have not been properly developed; in what way 
misunderstandings have arisen; whether indi- 
viduals or the class as a whole have not been 
thinking clearly. If our questions serve to bring 
out deficiencies in the way of thinking as well as 
deficiency in knowledge, our methods of instruc- 
tion will improve. 
The purpose of the recitation should determine 
the type of question that should predominate, 
although one should expect to find other types. 
Some questions are found which have little place 
in instruction, and it is necessary to consider 
them so that we may know what prominence 
is given to material that should be eliminated. 
Questions of fact are oftentimes contrasted 
with questions of thought to the detriment 
of the former; when we do this we are not 
thinking clearly of the function of each. If our 
purpose is to drill or to test knowledge, we 
must ask questions that will elicit the exact re- 
sponse which shows whether or not the person 
questioned has the requisite knowledge. If we 
wish to find out whether or not a person knows

-P-A-G-E-107
  QUESTIONING 
the name of the President of the United States, 
we should ask a question that gets the direct 
response rather than one that arouses a process 
of reflective thought. One phase of a teacher’s 
duty is to test the knowledge that his class has 
of the topic under discussion. 
Few people will object to the statement that 
the thought question is one of the most impor- 
tant tools in instruction. Most life situations de- 
mand the exercise of the rational powers of the 
individual who meets it successfully. Therefore, 
the school needs to cultivate and develop such 
ability. The teacher’s question should require the 
pupil to consider the data involved, analyze it 
“into constituent elements, reject the irrelevant, 
choose that which bears on the problem, and give 
a statement of its solution. Thought questions 
need to be carefully framed. They should bear 
specifically on a definite problem. The data for 
the solution should be available to the one ques- 
tioned. Many thought questions are of no value 
as they are based on broad generalization beyond 
the capacity and understanding of the pupils in 
our schools. 
The topical question gives an opportunity for 
the teacher to discover the ability of a pupil to 
reorganize material in a logical manner. Many 
95
-P-A-G-E-108
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
topical questions test only the pupil’s ability to 
reproduce material from a textbook; it should 
go much beyond this, as the test of the assimi- 
lation of a topic in any subject is the power 
of reorganizing it from a different point of view. 
We are usually surprised when we investigate 
carefully the limited character of the work in this 
respect in our recitations. In the upper grades 
of the elementary school and in high school we 
usually find that a pupil’s resources are exhausted 
after he has talked for a minute on the topical 
question that has been given him. This is not 
due to the fact that he has not the ability. It is 
due to the faulty methods of questioning. 
More questions that appeal to the emotions 
should be given. A situation is rarely appreciated 
unless one places himself in the attitude, as 
nearly as possible, of the person whom he is con- 
sidering. When children are studying the Boston 
Tea-Party, its meaning will be much clearer to 
them if they are asked such questions as: How 
do you think the patriots felt who attended the 
meeting? What would be their attitude in ad- 
dressing the assembly? Show how you think they 
walked on their way to the harbor. Questions of 
this type will tend to arouse the interest to a 
much greater degree than questions of fact or 
96
-P-A-G-E-109
  
QUESTIONING 
those that merely arouse the intellectual appre- 
ciation of the situation. The teacher who ques- 
tions a statement of this character should test it 
before rejecting the idea. 
The purpose to which the question is put should 
to a great degree determine the type. If we wish 
to test knowledge that a student has of a subject, 
- we usually ask a question of fact. If we wish to 
- supplement the material of a textbook, that is, if 
we wish to find out whether or not the wider re- 
lationship of the subject under discussion is ap- 
preciated, we should ordinarily ask a thought 
question. If we wish the student to organize the 
subject-matter of a recitation, we should ask a 
question that demands a topical answer. If we 
wish to quicken the feelings, stimulate the emo- 
tions, a question that arouses the desired emotion 
would be the one to demand attention. 
Unfortunately, many questions of a recitation 
have little or no purpose. They are wholly ir- 
relevant, useful only to fill in the gap while the 
teacher is getting the thread of the organiza- 
tion himself, but such conditions are due usu- 
ally to lack of preparation and they may be 
rejected. Efficiency of instruction from the point 
of view of the question should be judged by 
the absence of the irrelevant question and the 
97 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
judicious use of the type in harmony with the 
purpose. 
The mode of asking questions has an impor- 
tance that is often overlooked. A class is do- 
ing effective work when all members are think- 
ing vigorously during the entire recitation. The 
method of questioning that challenges the atten- 
tion of all members of a class should be the one 
utilized. The questions that are asked promis- 
cuously, calling the name of the pupil after the 
question has been given, command the attention 
of every one. When the class does not know who 
will be held responsible for the answer, every one 
needs to be alert to the situation, and cognizant of 
its significance. The objection that some mem- 
bers of the class will be called on very frequently 
and that others will be neglected is sometimes 
raised to this method of questioning. Many times 
we do note that a few pupils who respond readily 
receive the major amount of attention, due to 
the fact that the teacher has no definite order of 
procedure in mind; this is easily remedied by 
having the names on cards and shuffling the pack 
each time after all pupils have been called for a 
contribution. The mechanical method of calling 
on pupils in regular order makes recitations dull 
and lifeless, and only the person without imagina-

QUESTIONING 
tion will proceed in such course. It is unneces- 
sary to discuss the reasons why this is not a good 
policy from a psychological point of view. 
Many times we are prone to believe that chil- 
dren possess knowledge when they give glib re- 
sponses in unison, but this is no indication that 
a very large number of the class possess much 
of the information that is so easily given. The 
folly of this method was discovered in the work 
of Lancaster and Bell. When we wish to tune the 
ear of the children to the correct enunciation of 
a word it may at times be wise to have the re- 
sponse given in unison. The rote singing in the 
primary grades calls for work of this kind. When- 
ever correct impression of form is the requisite 
element, or when one wishes to secure harmony 
of action as a unit, then concert work is in place. 
One needs to be on the alert to see that when in- 
dependence of action is necessary that concert 
work has no place. 
The number of questions asked i 
period ‘by the acher, as a ‘usual rule, 
great. However, this would be anticipated when 
direct questions or questions of choice predomi- 
nate. It requires very little time or effort to say 
yes or no. A teacher must be saying something 
to keep the children from indulging in profitable

slumber. The writer visited a class in history 
recently, where the teacher was asking questions 
at the rate of six per minute. This is not an ex- 
traordinary case, and can be duplicated if a per- 
son holds a watch on the teacher during the class 
period. There is not much opportunity for stu- 
dents to think when they are subject to such rapid- 
fire questioning. 
, An observer should give careful attention to 
the questions asked in the recitation. He should 
be cognizant of the fact that questions are an 
index of the efficiency of the teacher. The factors 
in questioning should be kept clearly in mind. 
The purpose of the recitation should be analyzed, 
and the questioning should be evaluated from 
this point of view. A teacher who is developing 
material would be accomplishing little if a great 
majority of his questions were those of fact, and 
the one who is testing the results of teaching a 
topic would be equally open to criticism if many 
emotional questions had place. Questioning is 
an art that is accomplished by persistent, strenu- 
ous effort, and the teacher who is master of this 
art is a desirable model.

' GLASS MANAGEMENT 
A TEACHER may have a desirable personality, 
may be skillful in presenting subject-matter, may 
have at his command all aids known to a modern 
schoolmaster, and may be housed in a building 
that is the last word in school architecture; he 
may fail to be one hundred per cent efficient 
because of his poor methods of management. 
Efficiency is the watchword of the modern world 
in which we are living, applied to all classes of 
workers from the humblest street sweeper to the 
president of the great transcontinental railway 
line. The coal heaver and the bricklayer are able 
to perform much more labor at a less cost of 
energy than formerly through a scientific investi- 
gation of their work, through the elimination of 
unnecessary movements, through mechanizing 
routine, and through having materials so easily 
accessible that there is no waste motion. If 
scientific management has increased the efficiency 
of workers in other fields, through the elimina- 
tion of waste energy, should not teachers be 
102
-P-A-G-E-115
  CLASS MANAGEMENT 
cognizant of the advantages thus gained and 
conduct their work accordingly? 
Many factors in school management can be 
relegated to the realm of mechanical routine. 
Activities that are performed at a specified time 
each day, that have always the same specific 
purpose, that by their very nature would pro- 
vide no opportunity for individual initiative, 
should be carefully considered and the most 
mechanical means of procedure should be dis- 
covered. We find certain elements in this cate- 
gory, such as the passing of classes, passing of 
class to the board, distributing supplies, fire 
drills, etc. It requires careful discrimination in 
the type of activity, as teachers sometimes have 
a habitual routine for activities that ought never 
to be on this basis, for example, calling on pupils, 
conducting morning exercises, etc. The perform- 
ance of any task that demands the will of the 
group acting as a unit should be reduced to the 
basis of routine, and tasks that give opportunity 
for individual initiative should never be placed on 
this basis. 
The discipline of a school is conditioned by 
good management. If the teacher is skillful in 
managing his class, the problem of discipline 
means that all pupils are conscious of the purpose 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
of the school, that all are working to attain this 
end; it means harmony of action, respect for the 
rights of others, coéperation in community tasks, 
and interest in the part the individual plays. If 
this is not the attitude in a school, the reason for 
its failure should be investigated and the means 
that the teacher uses to overcome the obstacles 
in the way should be noted. 
A teacher who is a careless housekeeper rarely 
has the most potent influence on those instructed. 
We know the moral influence of a well-kept 
home, and this is as applicable in the school. The 
failure of a teacher to be a careful housekeeper is 
obvious in a casual survey, for one cannot cover 
the evidence of an untidy room, poorly kept sup- 
plementary material, torn books, broken furni- 
ture, and marred desks. An orderly, well-kept 
room is indicative of the habits of the one who is 
in charge. 
A large amount of time is wasted in our school- 
rooms. No institution, unless it is the church, is 
so prodigal of time. There is an historic reason 
why this is the case, but it is no reason for its 
continuance in modern civilization. The school is 
bound to be judged by its products, by the habits 
it inculcates in those it trains, and by their effi- 
ciency in the world of men and affairs. When 
104
-P-A-G-E-117
  
CLASS MANAGEMENT 
the cry is “Efficiency” in the business world, the 
school cannot afford to ignore this conception in 
its own organization. In viewing the conduct of 
a school, we should note where time is wasted. A 
few places where time can be economized are 
mentioned in the outline; one should also note 
means employed that conserve energy, facilitate 
rapid movement, and profitably utilize otherwise 
wasted time. 
The program is another evidence of a teacher’s 
efficiency in management. The program rep- 
resents the teacher’s systematic plan for con- 
ducting the day’s work, and it is a good indica- 
tion as to his knowledge of both the nature of the 
subjects and the psychology of fatigue; that is, if 
the teacher is given the responsibility for con- 
structing his program. A program that places in 
succession the subjects that require much work 
with the hands would be undesirable. Again, a 
program that requires intense mental application 
for a long period of time is faulty. It has been 
found that short periods of drill at more frequent 
intervals are more efficacious than long periods 
less frequent; one should note this provision in 
looking at a program.

THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE 
SCHOOLROOM 
WHEN one visits a classroom, the element that 
commands attention next to pupils and teacher 
is the physical features, the hygienic conditions, 
the sanitary arrangements of the building. How- 
ever, the importance of this factor is rarely ap- 
preciated. The science of school architecture, 
decoration, and sanitation is in its infancy. Until 
recently little thought has been given to the con- 
struction of school building either from a prac- 
tical or an esthetic point of view. The architect 
who could plan a comfortable dwelling-house was 
considered wholly competent to direct the con- 
struction of a school building, and the results of 
this are the monstrosities that we find in many 
cities, labeled school buildings. It is a healthful 
sign to find reputable architects specializing in 
school construction. People are beginning to ap- 
preciate the fact that school buildings should be 
artistic and practical; that they are measures of 
the community’s ideals; that they should be the 
107
-P-A-G-E-120
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
center of public life; that they should be utilized 
during all the working hours and not merely dur- 
ing a brief period in the middle of the day. Stand- 
ard units are being developed for the construc- 
tion of school buildings and schoolrooms, and 
teachers should be familiar with these units. 
When a room is entered, they should have a 
standard in mind in order that they may be able 
to judge intelligently the conditions of the room 
in respect to light, heat, ventilation, seating, 
decoration, equipment, and accessories. It is not 
the purpose here to discuss minutely the stand- 
ards that should be followed in the construction 
of buildings and rooms; the purpose is rather to 
make the problem conscious in the minds of peo- 
ple visiting schools. There is considerable litera- 
ture on school hygiene which should be familiar 
to all teachers. 
Many of the physical features of a schoolroom 
are beyond the control of the teacher. When the 
problem is carefully analyzed, however, it is seen 
that many of them may be remedied, if not 
changed. The teacher has no control over the 
length, breadth, or height of his room, neither has 
he over the window space, but if the light is de- 
ficient it is within his power to have the shades 
adjusted and seats so arranged that the light 
108
-P-A-G-E-121
  
THE SCHOOLROOM 
is most advantageously distributed. How often 
are teachers prone to complain of poorly lighted 
rooms without using the means under their con- 
trol to better conditions. Only recently have 
buildings been erected to furnish light that is 
adequately distributed over the entire space. In 
some buildings teachers through concerted effort 
have been able to have changes made, but as yet 
there is a woeful lack of attention given to this 
important factor. 
Schoolrooms both with and without mechani- 
cal systems of ventilation are frequently poorly 
ventilated because in those with good systems 
the windows are opened, and in those without, 
the windows are kept closed. If ventilation must 
be by the direct method, teachers should devise 
a plan whereby the air can be constantly changed; 
if by a mechanical system, they should under- 
stand the principle of its construction in order 
that they may not do anything to interfere with 
its efficiency. Most engineers in school buildings 
where the ventilating system is adequate com- 
plain about the lack of codperation on the part 
of teachers, due to their ignorance as to the work- 
ing of the system. Teachers in training need to 
be taught the essential facts in regard to venti- 
lation in order that they may understand that 
10g
-P-A-G-E-122
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
raising a window may be a handicap as well as a 
help to the proper ventilation of a schoolroom. 
Adjustable desks are helping to lessen the 
problem of proper position, but, like opportu- 
nities, it carries responsibilities. In the days of 
wooden benches, none of which fitted any pupils, 
the teacher had no problem in seating; when 
the desks can be adjusted to each pupil, the 
teacher must be constantly on the alert to see 
that each child has a seat properly adjusted. 
Rapid growth on the part of the child will mean 
two or three adjustments of his seat during a 
school year, so that although the adjustments 
are perfect in September they may not be in 
June. Attention should be given not only to the 
adjustment of the height, but also to the adjust- 
ment of the relation of seat and desk. Most 
authorities at the present time seem to agree that 
they should be at two inch minus. 
Schoolroom decoration furnishes an opportu- 
nity for a teacher to develop the esthetic sense of 
his pupils. The finish of the woodwork is usually 
fixed by authority other than the teacher, but 
pictures, hangings, and artistic arrangements of 
these transform a barren, desolate, unadorned 
schoolroom into an attractive, bright, homelike 
place. It is interesting to note the pleasing effects 
110
-P-A-G-E-123
THE SCHOOLROOM 
that some teachers are able to secure with simple, 
inexpensive material. The influence of the teacher 
is often portrayed by the appearance of his room. 
The furnishings of the room bear a mute testi- 
mony to the character of the citizenship of the 
city or district. Were this appreciated in many of 
our American communities, it would mean more 
artistic school buildings. The moral atmosphere 
is oftentimes affected by the physical surround- 
ings. Filthy desks, floors, coat-rooms, and toilets 
are debasing in their influence. The defaced con- 
dition of many school buildings encourages van- 
dalism, destroys respect for public property, and 
makes it difficult to inculcate desirable standards 
of conduct. A boy or girl who is surrounded by 
such conditions does not have a great incentive 
to be neat and orderly about his person or in his 
work. The pernicious influence of the vulgar and 
obscene material inscribed about many school 
buildings is known to most experienced teachers. 
The ideals of a school can often be measured 
by the equipment that is furnished. Maps, 
globes, blackboards are as essential to proper 
instruction as are a teacher and a textbook. In 
cities where children are required to provide their 
own textbooks, there is oftentimes a woeful lack 
of supplementary and illustrative material. It 
IIL   
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  THE OBSERVATION OF TEACHING 
seems at times as though the cities that furnish 
free textbooks are more cognizant of the neces- 
sity of supplementary aids. However, it would 
be unjust to make this statement as a generaliza- 
tion. A teacher in visiting a school should have 
clearly in mind the equipment that is necessary 
for the most effective work, and this should be 
used as one of the elements in forming his entire 
judgment. 
The accessories of a schoolroom are important 
factors in furnishing proper conditions for the 
most effective work. The coat-room should be eas- 
ily accessible from the room, but from no other 
source, in order that it can be under the immedi- 
ate supervision of the teacher. It should be prop- 
erly ventilated and sufficiently spacious so that 
each child has his own place in which to put his 
belongings. In our modern schools the common 
drinking cup has been abolished. This has been 
due as often to state laws as to the desire of the 
community to have proper sanitary conditions. 
In our modern school buildings sanitary toilets 
are found, and under efficient administration 
they are kept sanitary. Lunch-rooms are pro- 
vided in many schools where conditions do not 
make it feasible for the pupils to return home for 
the noonday meal. This is rare in elementary 
rI2

  THE SCHOOLROOM 
schools in cities, but is very essential in nearly 
all country and high schools. 
There is no excuse whatever for finding a school 
building unclean. No matter if the building does 
not provide adequate light, heat, or ventilation; 
no matter if it has seats that cannot be adjusted; 
no matter if no attention has been given to xs- 
thetic effects; no matter if the equipment is in- 
adequate — this is no justification for filth. It 
costs very little to keep clean, and there are no 
factors more conducive to good health than clean- 
liness and ventilation. A school should be se- 
verely criticized if it does not have a sufficient 
force of janitors to keep it clean.

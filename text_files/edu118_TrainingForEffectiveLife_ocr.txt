PREFACE , 
Tue first five chapters in this little 
book are speeches I made to newcomers 
to Harvard University at the opening of 
the academic year in five years between 
1904. and 1912; the sixth chapter is an 
address made in 1909 to the Hotchkiss 
School, a preparatory school at Lakeville, 
Connecticut; and the last chapter is an 
after-dinner speech made to the Asso- 
ciated Harvard Clubs at St. Louis in 
1903. Each of these speeches was taken 
down at the time by a shorthand re- 
porter, and subsequently revised by me. 
They. have all been printed before in 
newspapers or magazines; but Houghton 
Mifflin Company have thought it desir- 
able to put them into a more permanent 
form as a volume of the Riverside Liter- 
ature Series. As I read them anew, they 
seem to me to present to boys and youths

THE TRAINING FOR 
AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 
I 
THE SOLID SATISFACTIONS OF LIFE: 
I suppose I may fairly be called one 
of the elder brethren; because it is fifty- 
six years since I came hither in the same 
grade many of you now occupy. So I 
have had a chance to watcha long stream 
of youth, growing up into men, and pass- 
ing on to be old men; and I have hada 
chance to see what the durable satisfac- 
tions of their lives turned out to be. My 
contemporaries are old men now, and I 
have seen their sons and their grandsons 
coming on in this everflowing stream.

2 THE SOLID 
For educated men what are the sources 
of the solid and durable satisfactions of 
life ? (That is what you are all aiming at 
_—the solid, durable satisfactions of life, 
not primarily the gratifications of this 
moment or to-morrow, but the satisfac- 
tions that are going to last and grow. So 
far as I have seen, there is one indispen- 
sable foundation for the satisfactions of 
life— health. A young man ought to be 
a clean, wholesome, vigorous animal. 
That is the foundation for everything 
else, and I hope you will all be that, if 
you are nothing more. We have to build 
everything in this world of domestic joy 
and professional success, everything of a 
useful, honorable career, on bodily whole- 
someness and vitality. 
This being a clean, wholesome, vigor- 
ous animal involves a good deal. It in- 
volves not condescending to the ordinary 
barbaric vices. One must avoid drunk- 
enness, gluttony, licentiousness, and get- 
ting into dirt of any kind, in order to bea 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
  
SATISFACTIONS OF LIFE 3 
clean, wholesome, vigorous animal. Still, 
none of you would be content with this 
achievement as the total outcome of 
your lives. It is a happy thing to have 
in youth what are called animal spirits 
—a very descriptive phrase; but animal 
spirits do not last even in animals. They 
belong to the kitten or puppy stage. 
It isa wholesome thing to enjoy for a 
time, or for a time ashi day all through 
life, sports and active bodily exercise. 
These are legitimate enjoyments, but if 
‘ made the main object of life, they tire. 
They cease to be a source of durable sat- 
isfaction. Play must be incidental in a 
satisfactory life. 
What is the next thing, then, that we 
want, in order to make sure of durable 
satisfactions in life? We need a strong 
mental grip, a wholesome capacity for 
hard work. It is intellectual power and 
aims that we need. In all the professions 
—learned, scientific, or industrial — large 
mental enjoyments should come to edu-
-P-A-G-E-10
‘ 
  4 THE SOLID 
cated men. The great distinction between 
the privileged class to which you belong 
— the class that has opportunity for pro- 
longed education — and the much larger 
class which has not that opportunity, is 
that the educated class lives mainly by 
the exercise of intellectual powers, and 
gets therefore a much greater enjoyment 
out of life than the much larger class that 
earns a livelihood chiefly by the exer- 
cise of bodily powers. You ought to ob- 
tain here, therefore, the trained capacity 
’ for mental labor, rapid, intense, and sus- 
tained. That is the great thing to get 
in college, long before the professional 
school is entered. Get it now. Get it in 
the years of college life. It is the main 
achievement of college life to win this 
mental force, this capacity for keen ob- 
servation, just inference, and sustained 
thought, for everything that we mean 
by the reasoning power of man. That 
capacity will be the main source of 
intellectual joys and of happiness and
-P-A-G-E-11
o 
  SATISFACTIONS OF LIFE 5 
content throughout a long and busy 
life. 
But there is something more, some- 
thing beyond this acquired power of in- 
tellectual labor. As Shakespeare puts it: 
“The purest treasure mortal times afford 
is spotless reputation.” Howis that treas- 
ure won? It comes from living with 
honor, on honor. Most of you have be- 
gun already to live honorably, and hon- 
ored; for the life of honor begins early. 
Some things the honorable man cannot 
do, never does. He never wrongs or de- 
grades a woman. He never oppresses or 
cheats a person weaker or poorer than 
himself. He never betraysa trust. He is 
honest, sincere, candid, and generous. It 
is not enough to be honest. An honor- 
able man must be generous; and I do 
not mean generous with money only. I 
mean generous in his judgments of men 
and women, and of the nature and pros- 
pects of mankind. Such generosity is a 
beautiful attribute of the man of honor.
-P-A-G-E-12
  6 THE SOLID 
How does honor come to a man? 
What is the evidence of the honorable 
life? What is the tribunal which de- 
clares at last: “This is an honorable 
man”? You look now for the favorable 
judgment of your elders, — of parents 
and teachers and older students; but 
these elders will not be your final judges, 
and you had better get ready now in col- 
lege to appear before the ultimate tribu- 
nal, the tribunal of your contemporaries 
and the younger generations. It is the 
judgment of your contemporaries that 
is most important to you; and you will 
- find that the judgment of your contem- 
. poraries is made up alarmingly early; it 
may be made up this year in a way that 
sometimes lasts for life and beyond. It is 
made up in part by persons to whom you , 
“ have never spoken, by persons who in 
your view do not know you, and who 
get only a general impression of you; 
but always it is contemporaries whose 
judgment is formidable and unavoidable,
-P-A-G-E-13
  SATISFACTIONS OF LIFE 7 
Live now in the fear of that tribunal, — 
not an abject fear, because independence 
is an indispensable quality in the honor- 
able man. There is an admirable phrase 
in the Declaration of Independence, a 
document which it was the good fashion 
for the boys of my time to commit to 
memory. I doubt if that fashion still ob- 
tains. Some of our public action looks as 
if it did not. “When, in the course of 
human events, it becomes necessary for 
one people to dissolve the political bands 
which have connected them with an- 
other, and to assume among the powers 
of the earth the separate and equal sta- 
tion to which the laws of Nature and of 
Nature’s God entitled them, a decent 
respect to the opinions of mankind re- 
quires that they should declare the 
causes which impel them to the separa- 
tion.” That phrase — “a decent respect ” 
—is a very happy one. Cherish “a de- 
cent respect for the opinions of man- 
kind,” but never let that interfere with
-P-A-G-E-14
8 ‘THE SOLID 
your personal declaration of independ- 
ence. I say — begin now to prepare for 
the judgment of the ultimate human 
tribunal. 
Look forward to the important crises 
' of your life. They are nearer than you 
are apt to imagine. It is a very safe pro- 
tective rule to live to-day as if you were 
going to marry a pure woman within a 
month. That rule you will find a safe- 
guard for worthy living. It is a good 
tule to endeavor hour by hour and week 
after week to learn to work hard. It is 
not well to take four minutes to do what 
you can accomplish in three. It is not 
well to take four years to do what you 
can perfectly accomplish in three. It is 
well to learn to work intensely. You 
will hear a good deal of advice about 
letting your soul grow, and breathing 
in without effort the atmosphere of a 
learned society or place of learning. 
Well, you cannot help breathing, and 
you cannot help growing; these proc-
-P-A-G-E-15
  SATISFACTIONS OF LIFE 9 
esses will take care of themselves. The 
question for you from day to day is 
how to learn to work to advantage; and 
college is the place and now is the time 
to win mental power. And, lastly, live to- 
day and every day like a man of honor.

  II 
LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE: 
Ir is sixty-three years, gentlemen, 
since I stood where you now stand. As 
T look back over that long stretch in my 
life, I see it filled day by day with the 
duties and enjoyments of the passing 
moment; and I wish that I had reflected 
more on the things past, and looked for- 
ward more to things future. It seems to 
me that many healthy, active men have 
this defect in the conduct of their daily 
lives, and especially, that they are apt 
not to lay out beforehand their own 
ideal career. Many young men, standing 
as you now stand on the threshold of 
what we hope is to be a useful and 
happy life, seldom look ahead, seldom 
use their imagination with regard to their 
x An address to new students at the Harvard 
Union, September 26, 1912. 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 11 
own future lives, laying them out, in 
broad lines, of course, but clearly enough 
to define to themselves what they are 
going to aim at, what they hope for, 
what they mean to be. 
In regard to your college life, that 
process of looking ahead begins now; 
because under some new good rules 
about the administration of the elective 
system you are expected to shape at the 
start your whole career in college, and 
to make the choice of studies which will 
determine that career. Make a deliber- 
ate and far-seeing choice in accordance 
with your taste and wishes, and your 
reasonable expectation of success and 
enjoyment. In the choice of your stud- 
ies do not omit to take account of your 
own expectations of enjoyment in your 
work; because your satisfaction in life 
is going to depend largely on your en- 
joyment of habitual labors. Many young 
people think that it must be pleasures 
that tell most toward the enjoyment of 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  12 LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 
life; but that is not the fact. GE you will 
allow an old man to testify on that sub- 
ject, I can assure you that the main sat- 
isfactions of life come through hard 
work which one enjoys, Look forward, 
then, to the profession you are going 
to follow, remembering that nowadays 
many kinds of business provide a highly 
intellectual profession. Be guided in 
your choice by your own convictions 
about the kind of work you like, the 
kind of employment which itself sup- 
plies you with a strong motive for stren- 
uous and constant exertion. I am sure 
that after but a little experience you will 
find that altruism is an important ele- 
ment in the enjoyment of most kinds 
of work. This looking for the work you 
love, this looking for the profession you 
are going to enjoy all your life will carry 
“you some distance ahead from your 
present standpoint. 
But very soon you will be ready to 
practice some profession. Then look
-P-A-G-E-19
  LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 13 
ahead very sharply; because the most 
important event in your whole lives 
should then be imminent. Look ahead 
to marriage —and I should almost say, 
the sooner the better. It is the fashion 
nowadays among educated young men 
to wait) many years before they marry. 
That is a place where the life of the 
highly jeducated man is inferior to the 
life of |the mechanic, operative, farmer, 
or farmhand. Postponed marriage is a 
great evil in modern educated society. 
You will hear such conduct justified. 
You will hear some young man say, “I 
cannot invite a girl, who has been 
brought up to do nothing for herself, 
and to have every gratification and 
every luxury provided for her, to marry 
me until I can earn an income which 
will enable her to live with me in that 
way.” I have two remarks to make 
about that doctrine, —first, that if a girl 
has been brought up in that manner the 
sooner she has a chance to live differ-
-P-A-G-E-20
  14 LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 
ently the better for her; and secondly, 
that it is only fair for a young man who 
loves a-young woman to consult her 
as to whether or not she wishes to 
marry him before he can earn a large 
income. The young woman has a clear 
right to say a word on that subject to the 
man she loves, and not to be obliged 
to wait until he is thirty-five years 
old before he asks her to marry him. 
This, gentlemen, is a matter of looking 
ahead at a critical point in your lives. 
You are not in the habit, perhaps, of 
contemplating this event of marriage. 
It would be wiser to do so. The sooner 
you begin to think about it the better; 
because it will be thinking about the 
most important event in your lives in 
respect to the development of your 
own characters and to the happiness not 
only of yourselves, but of the women 
you will marry, and of the family life 
which will normally result. 
This looking forward will bring you  
-P-A-G-E-21
LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 15 
on to being twenty-six or twenty-eight 
years old at best. But the years will fly; 
and soon you will find yourselves in the 
presence of little children every day, your 
own children. Look ahead to that situa- 
tion. The very thought will protect you 
from evil-doing, and will prepare you 
for the greatest joys of life and the most 
lasting. When the time comes, you will 
see how much this happiness surpasses 
all other human joys, and how it is the 
real foundation for the enjoyment of work 
and the earning of a living, —no matter 
whether the way in which you earn your 
living be in itself satisfactory or not. He 
who has the domestic joys will get in- 
tense satisfaction even from the most 
monotonous and tiresome employment. 
He will have the satisfaction of earning 
the livelihood of wife and children. 
The years will go on, and you will be 
forty to forty-five years of age. To what 
experiences are you going to look for- 
ward at that period beyond the loves 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
    16 LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 
and joys of family life? You ought to 
look forward to, and plan for, the love 
of the home town or city, of the com- 
munity in which you dwell, of the insti- 
tutions which have served you and which 
you hope will serve your children, of the 
country whose ideals have improved, and 
are improving, the common human lot. 
You will see herein not only high mo- 
tives for active work and sympathetic 
coéperation in good works, but also new 
sources of durable satisfaction. By the 
time you are forty to forty-five years of 
age, you ought to be in position to con- 
tribute largely to the welfare of the com- 
munity in which you dwell. You, with 
your education and training, ought to be 
ready by that time to do what thousands 
of Harvard men are doing all over this 
country and all round the world,—to 
be serviceable in your day and gene- 
ration to multitudes of people; and 
this service may be rendered in business, 
in public office, in any of the respon-
-P-A-G-E-23
  
LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 17 
sible functions of civilized communi- 
ties. 
The time will go on, and you will be 
fifty to sixty years of age. What is there 
in that period that you had better be 
looking forward to? It is the time then 
to be a grandfather, and.so to secure an 
immense satisfaction to be added to the 
other joys of human life. Now, the time 
of life when a man will become a grand- 
father is something to be considered long 
beforehand, and you had better begin to 
consider it now. Why? Because the 
time at which a man becomes a grand- 
father is determined—normally, of course 
—by the time at which he marries. The 
postponed marriage has the great disad- 
vantage that a man cannot begin to en- 
joy grandchildren till he is almost too 
old to do so completely. A young grand- 
father is a very pleasing object, and one 
oftener seen in the uneducated classes 
and in the barbarous countries, as we 
call them, than among the educated men  
-P-A-G-E-24
  18 LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 
of a civilized country. Look ahead to 
that satisfaction in your later lives. 
Perhaps you are saying to yourselves, 
“These things are, to be sure, desirable; 
but are they obtainable by the average 
man? Is there any use in planning for 
them?” They are attainable with health 
and character. These things constitute the 
indispensable preparation for continuous 
satisfaction in the kind of life we have 
been describing. Therefore, gentlemen, 
look ahead in regard to the care of your 
bodies. Avoid the vices. Avoid lust; and 
avoid the habitual use of any stimulating 
or narcotic drug. The wider my field 
of observation, the more firmly I believe 
that the best rule for the-attainment of 
health, long life, and steady vigor, is to 
use no stimulant whatever habitually, 
neither alcohol nor tobacco, neither cof- 
fee nor tea. Some recent observations 
that I have been enabled to make in the 
East tend toward a possible exception 
to this rule in favor of tea. The Chinese
-P-A-G-E-25
LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 19 
and Japanese make habitual use of very 
weak tea in large quantities, and yet 
have survived by uncounted millions 
as indomitable workers, in spite of the 
fact that they have been subject to fam- 
ines, floods, occasional pestilences, and 
chronic contagions, from which they 
have had till lately no defense. 
With this same object of preserving 
a sound mind in a sound body, look 
ahead with regard to athletic sports. It 
may make some difference to you in the 
next four years, perhaps, if you look 
ahead with regard to this subject too. 
Under modern stresses athletic sports 
are an indispensable part of young life, 
and, indeed, of sound national life. One 
of the most serious aspects of China at 
the present moment is the absence there 
of all the sports we call “athletic.” 
Neither the educated nor the unedu- 
cated Chinese have athletic sports in the 
open air. All their sports are of a gam- 
bling nature. They are sedentary, or
-P-A-G-E-26
  20 LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE 
quiet, games of chance. That is a na- 
tional misfortune on an immense scale. 
By looking ahead in regard to athletic 
sports I mean give preference to those 
sports that last and that you can pursue 
at thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, and, 
I am beginning to hope, eighty years of 
age. You know what the lasting sports 
are, — walking, rowing, sailing a boat, 
tennis, golf, riding and driving,— any 
sport which can be pursued by the aver- 
age individual all through life. Lord 
Bacon says that riding horseback is the 
best recreation for men who use their 
brains. The sports that an individual 
can pursue all through his life are the 
best ones tolearn in youth. The wise 
choice involves looking ahead. 
Let me mention one more point about 
looking ahead. It is wisest to hold a 
hopeful ideal of the power of sustained 
enjoyment as life goes on, an enjoyment 
which increases rather than diminishes. 
How common are laments about the in-
-P-A-G-E-27
  LOOKING AHEAD IN LIFE a1 
capacities and disabilities of advancing 
years and the shrinkage in pleasures! It 
is true that some pleasures which require 
keen senses do shrink; but, on the other 
hand, the intellectual and moral de- 
lights increase in intensity as life goes on, 
and many physical satisfactions can be 
held level to the end. Look forward, 
therefore, to a life which shall grow more 
and more enjoyable as time goes on. 
That expectation corresponds with the 
facts of the normal, healthy life among 
civilized men. It is a delight to look for- 
ward to it; to anticipate it is in itself a 
happiness. 
For many reasons, therefore, gentle- 
men, look ahead!

THE CHARACTER OF A GENTLEMAN:= 
We have been listening to several 
different voices, and have observed in 
what they said notes that were common 
to all. I wonder if I can tell you what 
seefned to me would be the issue of their 
advice in the personal character of the 
Harvard student. (You have heard that 
the Harvard man should be an inde- 
{ pendent, stout-hearted individual, that 
he should be sociable, that he should cul- 
tivate friendship, that he should be a 
hard student, that he should have an en- 
thusiasm and “hitch his wagon toa star.” 
Now, what is this character —is there 
any name for it? I think I saw, as I sat 
here to-night, what this character might 
well be called. It is the character of a a

October 12, 1904.
-P-A-G-E-29
A GENTLEMAN 23 
gentleman who is also a democrat. Let 
me try to state to you ina few moments 
some of the elements of that character. 
When I travel in other parts of our 
country, it often gives me a great deal 
of pleasure to have a lady or a gentle- 
man say to me, “I think I can tell a 
Harvard man by his manners.” J always 
hope that is true. I know it is true of 
some Harvard men, and I wish it tere 
true of every Harvard man—that you 
can tell him by his manners. Manners 
go a long way toward morals. An insti- 
tution of learning confers a great benefit 
on its novices when it improves their. 
bearing, their address, and their manners 
and customs. What are some of the 
characteristics of a gentleman in demo- 
cratic society ? 
In the first place, he will be a quiet 
person. His speech will be gentle and 
his demeanor quiet. I have had many 
visiting college presidents and teachers 
say to me, “ Where are your students ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  24 THE CHARACTER OF 
I don’t hear them about the Yard. It 
seems to me this is avery quiet campus. 
It is not much like ours.” Now, that is a 
fact. The Harvard Yard is favorably 
known as the quietest college enclosure 
in the country. If you hear a fellow 
bawling about the Yard you can be per- 
fectly sure that he is an outsider or a 
newcomer. A gentleman is quiet. He 
does not bluster, or bustle, or hurry, or 
vociferate. He is a serene person. The 
most effective people are generally quiet, 
and for the best of reasons —namely, 
that effectiveness requires steady, close 
attention, and that attention implies still- 
ness and a mind intent. 
Another of his qualities is a disposi- 
tion to see the superiorities in persons 
rather than their inferiorities, and to wish 
to associate with his superiors rather than 
his inferiors. This isan excellent rule by 
which to select your friends. Observe the 
superiorities in men, and associate with 
your superiors. This is a part of the gen-
-P-A-G-E-31
  A GENTLEMAN 25 
erosity of a gentleman — discerning the 
finer qualities in other people and wel- 
coming them. No loneliness or isolation 
for him; because he discovers and seeks 
his superiors. 
A gentleman should be generous, and 
he may be generous, though he be poor 
in money, — that is, he may have a gen- 
erous spirit. He will be reserved about 
the state of his own pocket and budget. 
He will conform his life to his resources 
and say nothing about them, but let 
the facts speak for themselves. He will 
not be generous with other people’s 
money — his father’s or his mother’s, for 
instance. Some Americans seem to think 
that a gentleman should not economize, 
or be frugal, or insistent on getting a just 
money value in his purchases. They 
think that lavishness characterizes the 
gentleman, whereas neither lavishness 
nor parsimony befits a gentleman. 
There is another evidence of generos- 
ity ina gentleman by which you may
-P-A-G-E-32
26 THE CHARACTER OF 
test any person about whom you doubt 
whether he be a gentleman or not. A real 
gentleman will always\ be considerate 
toward those whom he employs, toward 
those who might be considered his infe- 
riors, or who are in any way in his power. 
The real gentleman thinks about their 
comforts, pleasures, and reasonable ex- 
pectations, and does nothing to make 
their condition harder or less enjoyable. 
There is no surer test of a gentleman 
than that, except that a gentleman will 
never do anything that will hurt a woman 
or child or any human creature weaker 
than himself, even if he does not yet 
know the woman or child that might be 
hurt. This is a test which is infallible. I 
think that you will find that this rule of 
conduct will go far toward the preserva- 
tion of personal honor and personal pur- 
ity. 
But there is another quality in a gen- 
tleman, which is illustrated perfectly in 
the life of our democracy —and I am
-P-A-G-E-33
  A GENTLEMAN 27 
trying to describe the gentleman who is 
also a democrat. The gentleman must 
be a power. We have derived our idea 
of the gentleman, in good part, from the 
days of chivalry. The gentlemen were 
then landowners, magistrates, and sol- 
diers, whose responsibilities and risks 
were often great. The gentleman was a 
vigorous doer; and this brave, active, 
influential leader is still the type of the 
gentleman, although the modes of his 
activity have greatly changed. The gen- 
tleman in a democracy cannot be a 
lazy, shiftless, self-indulgent person. He 
must be a worker, an organizer, and a 
disinterested laborer in the service of 
others. )I suppose that was the type of 
gentleman that Professor Fenn had in 
mind to-night. Iam sure that is the only 
true type of gentleman. The solid satis- 
factions of life are won only through labor. 
The young university man who means 
to be a gentleman should therefore cul- 
tivate zealously his powers of effective

work with brain, nerve, and muscle. 
The gentleman is not to be a weakling, 
or a mere pleasure-seeker, but a strong 
and hard-working man. 
T have heard it said a good many times 
in the last few years by thoughtless stu- 
dents that in Harvard College the gen- 
tleman’s mark is “C.” We have five 
grades in Harvard College — A, B, C, D, 
and E. Do you see the bearing of that 
statement? “The gentleman’s mark is 
C!” He is not to be an effective, strong 
worker. He is not to be a man with a 
strong grip and a high purpose. He is not 
to be a strenuous seeker after efficiency 
and power. He is to be an indiffer- 
ent, good-for-nothing, luxurious person, 
idling through the precious years of col- 
lege life. Can there be a stupider or a 
falser idea of a gentleman than that ? 
The gentleman attends to the person 
who is speaking and to the business in 
hand, Considerate attention is always an 
important part of good manners. The

soldier, when an officer approaches him, 
puts his heels together, and stands silently 
in the erect attitude of attention. This 
is an instructive and significant observ- 
ance. It reminds me of another quality 
of a gentleman, too much neglected in 
our day. A gentleman is deferential. He 
is deferential to age, to innocence, to 
beauty, to skill, to excellence; and the 
stronger he is himself, the surer he is to 
show this quality of respect toward merit 
in others. 
I have tried to point out to you what 
the type of character is which unites the 
manly qualities the preceding speakers 
have suggested or emphasized. It is a 
high ideal, a democratic ideal, an Ameri- 
can ideal.

THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE 
Tue Dean has gone back a good way 
in Harvard history, and referred to a 
time long ago when I was fresh in my 
office and had not taken to heart the ad- 
vice which an old friend of my family 
gave me shortly after my election. He 
said to me, “ Charles, I suppose you think 
that in your new office the first quality 
you will need is energy.” I replied, 
«Why, yes, I thought that energy was 
likely to be needed.” “No,” he said; 
“that is not at all the first quality you 
will need. The first quality is patience, 
patience, patience.” I did not believe 
him at that time; but long since I learned 
that Mr. Hillard was right. It takes much 
time to get essential changes wrought in 
t An address to new students at the Harvard 
Union, October 1, 1906.
-P-A-G-E-37
THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE 31 
an institution of education, or in a gov- 
ernmental institution ; and the reason for 
this slowness is that changes which are 
to last must be accepted by multitudes 
of men, — indeed, by generations of in- 
terested and responsible men. In this 
long process arrests and reactions occur. 
In the last few years we have had striking 
illustrations of strong reaction against 
prevailing educational policies. There 
has come upon us, right here in these 
grounds and among Harvard’s consti- 
tuents, and widespread over the coun- 
try as well, a distrust of freedom for 
students, of freedom for citizens, of free- 
dom for backward races of men. That 
is one of the striking phenomena of our 
day, a distrust of freedom. : 
Now, there is no moment in life when 
there comes a greater sudden access of 
freedom than this moment in which you 
find yourselves. When young men come 
to any American college, —I care not 
at all to which college, — to any Ameri- 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  32 THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE 
can college from the parents’ home or 
from school, they experience a tremen- 
dous access of freedom. Is it an injury ? 
Is it a danger? Are you afraid of it? 
Has society a right to be afraid of it? 
What is freedom for? What does it do 
for us? Does it hurt or help us? Do we 
grow in it, or do we shrink in it? That 
is quite’ an important question in the 
management of Harvard University. It 
is an important question in modern 
government. It is pretty clear that when 
young men or old men are free, they 
make mistakes, and they go wrong; hav- 
ing freedom to do right or wrong, they 
often do right and they often do wrong. 
When you came hither, you found your- 
selves in possession of a new freedom. 
You can over-eat yourselves, for ex- 
ample; you can over-drink; you can take 
no care for sleep; you can take no ex- 
ercise or too much; you can do little 
work or too much; you can indulge in 
harmful amusements; in short, you have
-P-A-G-E-39
THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE 33 
a great new freedom here. Is it a good 
thing for you, or a bad thing ? (Clearly, 
you can go astray, for the road is not 
fenced.) You can make mistakes; you 
can fall into sin. Have you learned to 
control yourselves? Have you got the 
will power in you to regulate your own 
conduct ? Can you be your own task- 
master? You have been in the habit of 
looking to parents, perhaps, or to teach- 
ers, or to the heads of your boarding- 
schools or your day schools for control 
in all these matters. Have you got it in 
yourselves to control yourselves? That 
is the prime question which comes up 
with regard to every one of you when 
you come to the University. Have you 
the good sense and the resolution to reg- 
ulate your own conduct ? 
It is pretty clear that in other spheres 
freedom is dangerous. How is it with free 
political institutions? Do they always 
yield the best government? Look at the 
American cities and compare them with
-P-A-G-E-40
ee eR hehe 
v 34 THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE 
the cities of Europe. Clearly free institu- 
tions do not necessarily produce the best 
government. Are, then, free institutions 
wrong or inexpedient ? What is freedom 
for? Why has God made men free, as he 
has not made the plants and the animals? 
The plant is tied to one spot, and it de- 
velops with more or less perfection on a 
fixed type. Itcan be noother. It may be 
a little better oak tree or a little worse oak 
tree, but out of the acorn must come the 
oak. The moving, roving animal has a 
little more freedom ; but it is held closely 
to its type by a group of fixed inherited 
tendencies and habits. But how is it with 
men? They are infinitely freer; God 
made themso. Did He make a mistake ? 
Is freedom dangerous? Yes! but it is 
necessary to the growth of human char- 
acter, and that is what we are all in the 
world for, and that is what you and your 
like are in college for. That is what the 
world was made for, for the occupation 
of men who in freedom through trial win

  THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE 35 
character. It is choice which makes the 
dignity of human nature. It is habitual 
choosing after examination, considera- 
tion, reflection, and advice, which makes 
the man of power. Do you want to be 
automata? Do you want to be cogs on 
a wheel driven by a pinion which re- 
volves in obedience to a force outside it- 
self? Is that what you are aiming to be ? 
The cog is implicitly obedient to an au- 
thority outside itself. The automaton acts 
without willing each time. Do you want 
to be either in after life? If not, then ex- 
ercise your power of choice and the in- 
ternal power of control. It is the will that 
makes the thinker and the inventor. It 
is through the internal motive power of 
the will that men imagine, invent, thrust 
their thoughts out into the obscure be- 
yond, into the future. The will is the 
prime motive power; and you can only 
train your wills in freedom. That is what 
freedom is for, in school and college, 
in society, industries, and governments.

Fine human character is the object in 
; View, and freedom is the indispensable 
condition of its development. 
Now, there are some clear objects for 
choice here in college, for real choice, for 
discreet choice. I will mention only two. 
In the first place, choose those studies — 
there is a great range of them here— 
which will, through your interest in them, 
develop your working power. You know 
that it is only through work that you can 
achieve anything, either in college or in 
the world. | Choose those studies on which 
you can work intensely with pleasure, 
with real satisfaction and happiness. ‘That 
is the true guide toa wise choice. Choose 
that intellectual pursuit which will de- 
velop within you the power to do enthu- 
siastic work, an internal motive power, 
hot anexternal compulsion. Then choose 
an ennobling companionship. You will 
find out in five minutes that this man 
stirs you to do good, that man to evil. 
Shun the latter; cling to the former.  
-P-A-G-E-43

‘Choose companionship rightly; choose 
your whole surroundings so that they 
shall lift you up and not drag you down. 
Make these two choices wisely, and be 
faithful in labor, and you will succeed in 
college and in after life.

FORESIGHT AND CAPACITY FOR 
STRENUOUS EFFORT: 
(Dean Briccs, presenting President Eliot, 
told an.amusing story of a couple at the 
World’s Fair in Chicago, who, entering that 
“Harvard Path,” wished to see a portrait of 
President Angell or Angel, ‘whatever they 
call it,” and were absolutely certain that he 
was the distinguished head of Harvard Uni- 
versity, until they were assured that “Eliot” 
was the way the name under the portrait 
should be pronounced.) 
President Eliot said : 
I like to have my name associated with 
that of President Angell. He deserves his 
name thoroughly, and he is a veteran 
in university work, like myself. Indeed, 
he claims to be the only man who has 
been president ofan American university

longer than I have been. He admits, 
however, that in making this reckoning 
he has to count two universities instead 
of one. He was formerly president of 
the University of Vermont; and I was 
reading to-day the address which the 
present president of the University of 
Vermont made last week to the students 
just entering that university. President 
Buckham is another veteran in univer- 
sity service, but is still young. I noticed 
that he called the young men he was ad- 
dressing, representing the great body of 
youth entering at this season of the year 
the American colleges and universities, 
the “very elect.” That is a good phrase, 
it seems to me. It is highly descriptive 
and isa just description. That small pro- 
portion of the American youth — it is a 
very small proportion — that attains to 
a college or university forms the elect of 
the American nation — the flower of the 
youth. 
Now, how do you get here — you,
-P-A-G-E-46
40 FORESIGHT AND CAPACITY 
the elect, selected in this small propor- 
tion from the thousands of eligible Ameri- 
can youths? I think most of you came 
here, got here, because your families 
or friends had two of the great civiliz- 
ing qualities — foresight and capacity 
for continuous effort toward a remote 
goal. 
Your families, the families of this elect 
youth all over the country, brought 
them to the University, prepared them 
for the University through foresight, 
through a belief that, having a surplus 
over bare necessities, a surplus large or 
small, the very best use they could make 
of that surplus was to train their children 
for higher service in the distant future. 
Foresight and capacity for continuous 
exertion or effort toward a remote object, 
—those are the qualities that brought 
most of you here, because they existed 
in your families. Some of you came 
here without family aid, without the aid 
of friends, because you had in a high
-P-A-G-E-47
  FOR STRENUOUS EFFORT 41 
degree, though young, these great quali- 
ties of civilized men. 
Now, I want to urge on you here to- 
night to carry on your university life 
just in this same spirit, in the spirit of 
those who looked ahead and worked 
hard in your interest; or in the spirit of 
the few among you who showed these 
qualities early in life very resolutely or 
they would not have arrived here at all. 
Look ahead in your university career, 
and then work hard. 
Look ahead. In a few years you will 
come to that very important choice in 
life—the determination of an occupa- 
tion; but you know now that you will 
need, whatever your occupation, highly 
trained capacity for labor and for intelli- 
gent direction or judicious choice in 
effort. You are certain that you will 
need this capacity. You know now that 
the profession or occupation you select 
is going to be the source not only of a 
livelihood, but of your power of useful- 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  42 FORESIGHT AND CAPACITY 
ness and of some of the most solid satis- 
factions of life. 
See now just what the qualities in you 
are which will give you success in your 
chosen occupation. Look ahead to your 
life-work — although not all of you have 
a clear vision of what your life-work is 
to be. The more fortunate among you 
will have this vision; and all of you 
can look ahead and see what the powers 
in you must be to give you success and 
happiness in your life-work. 
And look ahead to other still more 
precious things. Look forward to being 
married. That forward look is one of 
the greatest safeguards of honorable liv- 
ing. Look forward to being married, 
and make yourself fit to give your wife 
the loving service and the unalloyed 
happiness which you expect your wife 
to give you. That is a good thing to 
look forward to— one of the most 
blessed things in life. And look for- 
ward, too, to having children and a 
blessed home of your own. 
   
-P-A-G-E-49
FOR STRENUOUS EFFORT 43 
There is another safeguard for the 
young man. Let him think beforehand, 
think now, what kind of an example he 
would like to set as a father. I have 
known in my lifetime many fathers who 
came with great anxiety to talk about 
their sons’ career in the University, be- 
cause they remembered that their own 
career had not been a good example for 
their sons, and they knew their sons 
knew it. 
Look forward, too, to the great privi- 
lege and joy of being serviceable to 
your community, to your neighbors, and 
to the greater neighborhood of the na- 
tion. One is justified in looking forward 
to attaining that privilege; and he will 
find in that forward look a great incen- 
tive to present work and to present 
self-restraint. 
Did it ever occur to you what an ex- 
traordinarily free government a univer- 
sity exercises, what an extraordinary 
freedom of body, mind, and soul you 
t  
-P-A-G-E-50
44 FORESIGHT AND CAPACITY 
enjoy here? Some people think that 
the freedom of university life is too 
great. I have heard of graduates of Har- 
vard College expressing the opinion that 
there is too much freedom here now. 
There is rather more freedom than 
there used to be; but there cannot be 
too much freedom in a university, That 
is impossible; because it is only in the 
atmosphere of freedom that the soundest 
moral character can be produced. It is 
impossible to produce the soundest moral 
character in an atmosphere of compul- 
sion. The whole military life shows that 
freedom is the only atmosphere in which 
the personal initiative can be highly 
trained. The military life used to pro- 
duce —things change even in military 
life — an implicit obedience, a lack of 
personal initiative, and a codperative 
habit without the element of free per- 
sonal resolution and choice. The at- 
mosphere of a university is precisely the 
opposite. Freedom is indispensable to
-P-A-G-E-51
  FOR STRENUOUS EFFORT 45 
it — indispensable to all academic teach- 
ing, indispensable to the development 
in every student of the highest possible 
degree of personal initiative and self- 
control. 
You will find here the freest Univer- 
sity; and it will remain absolutely free 
for teachers and students alike. The 
American universities in general illus- 
trate government by public opinion 
without any force whatever. In this, and 
in all the American universities, there is 
no use of force to compel the individual 
to do something that he does not wish 
to do. In this University there is only 
one penalty, namely, exile, separation 
from this blessed community. 
There is another spirit, however, in 
Harvard University and in all the Amer- 
ican universities in large degree. It is the 
spirit of friendliest codperation of com- 
rade with comrade, of older students 
with younger students, of teachers with 
the taught. It is impossible to imagine
-P-A-G-E-52
    46 FORESIGHT AND CAPACITY 
a higher spirit of friendly codperation 
than exists in this University and in all | 
the American universities worthy the 
name. 
Just think of the kind of coéperation 
that exists between a competent scholar 
who has been pursuing scholarship in a 
given department for a lifetime and the 
young advanced student who seeks his 
companionship and his guidance. Can 
there be a friendlier relation in the world? 
The elder man leads the younger through 
all the paths he himself has traveled and 
takes him out to the very limits of knowl- 
edge in his department of learning and 
tells him: “Thus far the world has 
brought us. Now you go a little farther. 
This is the way. Walk ye in it.” This 
is as perfect an illustration or example 
of coéperation in friendly effort as the 
world offers — disinterested, intellectual 
in the highest degree, relying on the cu- 
mulative and penetrative forces of the 
mind, the forces which have given prog-
-P-A-G-E-53
  
FOR STRENUOUS EFFORT 47 
ress to society. The old scholar leads 
the young scholar on that way, — shows 
him all the lights of the past and gives 
him the best searchlight he has himself 
invented for further discovery. This is 
the friendly codperation of mind with 
mind which the true university is con- 
stantly exhibiting—the genuine fellow- 
ship in noble pursuits. You will find all 
these things here. Pursue noble aims 
with utmost effort in the spirit of real 
intellectual ambition and of sincerest, 
friendliest codperation. 
There is a good deal said about the 
democracy of the American universities. 
They are very democratic — none more 
so than this ancient institution. The best 
definition of democracy that I remember 
to have seen is that given by Pasteur, a 
French scientist of most admirable serv- 
iceableness, a Roman Catholic whose 
father was a private soldier in the first 
French empire and a tanner. He says, 
“The true democracy is that which per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  48 FORESIGHT AND CAPACITY 
mits each individual to put forth his 
maximum effort.” That is a definition 
not only of democracy, but of true uni- 
versity freedom.

PREPARATION FOR AN EFFECTIVE 
LIFE: 
Tue subject chosen for to-night is, 
“Preparation for an Effective Life.” 
That is the life I am sure you all want 
to live —an effective life. 
Such a life must be based, in the first 
place, on a good, sound, serviceable 
body. None of us can have an effective 
life without a strong, healthy, cheerful 
servant in the body. It should be the 
servant, not the master. But that servant 
is necessary to an effective life. Some 
invalids and feeble persons have proved 
to be men of genius and, therefore, serv- 
iceable to the world. There are not a few 
examples of such triumph of mental and 
moral quality over the feebleness of the 
t An address at the Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, 
Connecticut, January 16, 1909.
-P-A-G-E-56
  50 PREPARATION FOR 
earthly body. But for effectiveness in 
the future career of you young men, a 
sound body is in the highest degree de- 
sirable, and, as a rule, it is essential. 
Now, it is easy to misunderstand what 
we mean by a sound body. It is easy to 
exaggerate the muscular force, for in- 
stance, which is desirable for a good, 
serviceable body. It is not that we need 
a big frame or heavy muscles. The essen- 
tial thing is a sound nervous system, with 
which goes a fairly developed muscular 
system, and a strong digestive system. 
I have been in the habit of saying — 
and I believe it is absolutely true — that 
a person who doesn’t enjoy his food is 
not likely to have a very serviceable life. 
The enjoyment of all the natural physi- 
cal functions is highly desirable through- 
out life; and we need the kind of body 
which permits that steady enjoyment of 
all the natural animal functions of a hu- 
man being. We need what is called a 
“‘tough” body, rather than a superla- 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  
AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 51 
tively strong one. The effectiveness tells 
most in the nervous system. Work does 
not hurt anybody. It is worry, anxiety, 
nervousness in work which tells against 
the bodily comfort and the bodily serv- 
iceableness. Work is almost always 
healthy and developing ; worry, anxiety, 
or nervousness never is. Aim,therefore,at 
keeping your body nervously sound, be- 
cause the nerves are the directing parts of 
the body. Somehow, out from the nerve 
centers and along the nerves go forth 
what we call thought, speech, gesture, 
and emotion. The charm and power of 
life seem to center in the bodily senses 
and in the nerves. So take care of them. 
Do not overstrain them or overwork 
them. It is pretty hard for a healthy boy 
to overwork his muscles; but even a 
healthy boy can readily overwork his 
nerves. 
Among the professors in Harvard Uni- 
versity —and I have been looking at 
them now for sixty years — sleeplessness
-P-A-G-E-58
  52 PREPARATION FOR 
is always a bad sign. If I hear that a pro- 
fessor is getting sleepless, I begin to be 
anxious about his serviceableness. Sleep- 
lessness is an early symptom of nervous 
exhaustion, and always needs attention 
at once, whether it appears in a pupil or 
a teacher, in a bookworm or an athlete. 
Now, you boys are probably not af- 
fected with sleeplessness; but you know 
that sleep is a first-rate, healthy gratifi- 
cation — if we may speak of such an un- 
conscious state as a gratification. And, 
indeed, we may. Poetry is full of praises 
of sleep—‘“ Sleep that knits up the 
raveled sleeve of care”; “He giveth his 
beloved sleep.” Now, sleep is the great 
nerve repairer. 
Consider next the nature of the bodily 
strains you will have to endure when 
you go out into real life. They will not 
resemble those of your outdoor sports 
to-day; not at all. They will always be 
nervous strains. Consider the test which 
a surgeon may undergo at any minute
-P-A-G-E-59
  AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 53 
of any day, a test of the most critical 
kind. He is brought of a sudden to an 
operation which he must perform on the 
spot with such skill as his eye and hand 
possess; and when the knife has been in 
play, he may suddenly find that the dis- 
order is not at all what he expected, 
that the phenomena are not what he an- 
ticipated. What a test is that of a man’s 
nerves; of a man’s readiness, with all his 
knowledge and all his skill literally at 
his finger ends. But it is a nervous test, 
not a muscular test. It is just so in all 
the professions. The strains are really 
nervous strains; and the value of the 
muscular system to a professional man 
is that a well-developed muscular system 
and a habit of using the muscles are real 
safeguards against the nervous strains of 
professional life. It is not only in pro- 
fessional life that these strains occur. In 
all business life there are times when the 
bodily strain is great. It comes from 
anxiety, from not knowing what your
-P-A-G-E-60
54 PREPARATION FOR 
competitors are going to do, from the 
imminent risk of loss and suffering. 
So when you think of the bodily 
soundness which is necessary to success 
in life, to effectiveness in your adult life, 
think of the wiry, tough, active, endur- 
ing body which resists fatigue, and en- 
dures anxiety without a quiver, and faces 
danger in the same way,— steadily, and 
calmly, though alertly. That is the sort 
of body you need in order to have an 
effective life hereafter. 
Now, let us turn to the intellectual side. 
What sort of a mind is the serviceable 
mind in all the professions and in all the 
business occupations of the world? It 
is the mind capable of concentration, of 
an intense application to the task in hand. 
I dare say there are some boys here who 
have been told, “ You don’t know how 
to study; you don’t take hold of a les- 
son with any vigorous grip; you don’t 
apply yourself; you have n’t learned how 
to think hard.” That power of applica-
-P-A-G-E-61
AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 55 
tion, the power of concentrating all your 
forces of memory and reasoning on the 
task of the moment, is the principal thing 
you ought to get while in this school. 
Get that, and you have gone far to se- 
cure an effective life. 
It is immeasurably better to learn a 
lesson in ten minutes than to learn the 
same lesson in an hour. Indeed, the ten- 
minute boy, even if he does n’t learn his 
lesson quite so well, will generally have 
a permanent advantage afterward over 
the hour boy; because he has acquired 
a strong grip, this mental grip by which 
he accomplishes in a few moments what 
another will take an hour to accomplish. 
That is an infinitely serviceable quality 
toward an effective life. It is in part the 
power of absorbed attention, of thinking 
of nothing else except the task in hand, 
or the problem to be solved. Psycholo- 
gists call this power of exclusion “in- 
hibiting” everything else. 
It is a very good sign ina young per- 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
56 PREPARATION FOR 
son if it is difficult to attract his atten- 
tion when he is reading, or doing any- 
thing else which absorbs him. That it is 
difficult to break a boy’s attention from 
his instant task is a very good sign for 
future effectiveness; because it means a 
large power of inhibition, of shutting 
out things that are irrelevant, of shut- 
ting out sights and sounds, the whole 
mind being concentrated on the book or 
the task. It is a good thing to acquire 
that habit of attention in reading, or in 
any mental exercise. It is almost impos- 
sible to exaggerate the value of that 
faculty of inhibiting the irrelevant, and 
paying absolute attention to the rele- 
vant. ; 
There are some intellectual qualities 
which you need to acquire and develop 
here at this time of your life, which will 
have much to do with the play of your 
minds in future years. One is a strong 
taste for reading, for reading of a serious 
sort, as well as of a light sort. Acquire
-P-A-G-E-63
  
AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 57 
a liking for history and biography, and 
for historical romance, a liking, in short, 
for those interesting narratives of the 
world’s experience, and of the intellec- 
tual development of great men and wo- 
men, which inform the opening mind as 
to what men and women have thought 
and done, and tried to do in this old 
world. 
The taste for reading, if genuine and 
strong, is a sufficient source for the most 
prolonged mental enjoyment. Get that in 
a body sound as to nerves and you have 
got almost enough. There is no single 
subject of study which is essential to the 
development of an effective intellect. No 
one subject, no two or three essential 
subjects. The thing to do is to acquire 
certain powers and certain tastes; and 
then power of strenuous attention and 
taste for reading will by themselves go 
a long way toward acquiring affective- 
ness in any profession or occupation in 
after life.
-P-A-G-E-64
  58 PREPARATION FOR 
The time would fail me to describe 
all the intellectual achievements to be 
made in youth as pledges of mature 
effectiveness. But there is one kind of 
intellectual practice which is obviously 
of high importance. The practice of com- 
petition with your mates in things intel- 
lectual. That is the only way in which 
an individual can arrive at a knowledge 
of his own powers. That is the only way 
in which a nation can arrive at a knowl- 
edge of its own powers and capacities — 
through competition. 
It is the fashion to-day to deride 
competition, and to assert that all com- 
petition is cruel and abominable, and 
ought to be somehow prevented and sup- 
pressed in manufacturing, in business, 
and in trade. Monopolies are sometimes 
justified to-day on the ground that they 
destroy competition; and the search for 
enriching monopolies in business is al- 
most universal. 
The liberal professions never feel in
-P-A-G-E-65
  AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 59 
that way. A liberal institution of learn- 
ing never feels in that way. No college 
or university in this country for a mo- 
ment seeks a monopoly. ‘No school 
seeks a monopoly—could not if it 
. would, and would not if it could. It is 
the mark of a liberal profession that it 
always welcomes competition. And the 
real reason for that state of mind is that 
competition is the source of progress, ~ 
individual progress, national progress, 
collective progress of all sorts. The mo- 
ment any group of men shelter them- 
selves from competition, that moment 
they stand still; there is no clearer char- 
acteristic of human nature than that. 
What is the practical application of this 
doctrine in a school? Avail yourselves 
of every possible opportunity to pass 
examinations. 
I know that throughout the United 
States there is a great deal of preaching 
to the effect that examinations are unde- 
sirable. Examinations for admission to
-P-A-G-E-66
  60 PREPARATION FOR 
college, for instance, exist only in a few 
institutions in the Eastern States. To all 
the Western universities and colleges 
boys go in from their school simply on 
certificates; and there are not a few East- 
ern colleges in the same situation. Allow 
me to recommend you, when you choose 
a college, to choose one that holds exami- 
nations for admission. You will have no 
difficulty in doing so. You are near a 
very good college which has examina- 
tions for admission. But if you still need 
a sound criterion of choice between 
colleges that have examinations for ad- 
mission, prefer the college that has the 
strictest examinations for admission. That 
is the way to get the best training out 
of your school work. Cultivate the fac- 
ulty which is developed by passing 
frequent examinations. That corresponds 
in school life to what a lawyer has to do, 
a lawyer who goes into court every day 
of his life. He has to prepare himself 
by what we call in schools and colleges
-P-A-G-E-67
  AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 61 
“cramming” for treating vigorously and 
intelligently, before the court, a subject 
which he was not very familiar with per- 
hapsa month ago. The lawyer’s life who 
goes into court is just a series of quick 
preparations for an examination. Train 
yourselves in such work. You cannot 
choose any profession or business occu- 
pation in which that faculty of passing 
examinations well will not be of great 
advantage to you. Examinations are a 
very important part of all school and 
college training. 
There is another mental faculty that 
you ought to win something of here, be- 
cause there is a good degree of freedom 
in this school — the faculty of independ- 
ent thinking, of thinking for yourselves. 
Read a book, and reflect upon it; reflect 
upon the impression that it has made 
upon you; and think about it for your- 
self. Throughout education there is a 
great deal of pumping into you, so to 
speak. Now, the best part of education 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
    62 PREPARATION FOR 
is giving something out from you. Let 
something of thought and of imagination 
issue from you. Think independently, 
so far as you can; in youth not so much 
as in adult age, but begin in youth the 
process of independent thought. 
The next part of education for an 
effective life, which I want to speak 
about, is manners. It would be difficult 
to exaggerate the importance of manners 
with reference to an effective career in 
the world. Just the bearing of the body 
has great importance in business, in the 
practice of a profession, in public speak- 
ing to an audience, educated or unedu- 
cated, to the masses of the people or to 
the select few. The mere bearing of the 
body is of great importance to your suc- 
cess in future life. Military education 
has an excellent feature of this sort. In 
all military schools the proper bearing 
of an officer is carefully cultivated, and 
indeed the best part of the physical train- 
ing of a private soldier is what is called
-P-A-G-E-69
AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 63 
the “setting-up” drill. A public speaker 
needs to have a firm hold on the ground. 
It is very ineffective to stand in a slouch- 
ing way while speaking, or to limp first 
on one leg and then on the other, or to 
give any sign of bodily feebleness or fa- 
tigue. You know the soldier’s position 
of attention and respect is with heels to- 
gether and body erect. That position is 
always an element in the best manners, 
and there is hardly a more effective ele- 
ment. The mode of speaking is impor- 
tant. Gentleness, clearness, and courtesy 
in speech are valuable in every profes- 
sion and in every business. Cheerfulness 
of manner is everything in some busi- 
nesses. And then/a real sincerity ought 
to be expressed in manners, a difficult 
and yet avery precious thing. Frankness 
is a good part of it. 
When you shake hands with a man or 
woman, look in the eyes, straight in the 
eyes, with no blinking of the encounter. 
There are schools for priests where the 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  64 PREPARATION FOR 
pupils are said to be taught not to look 
in the eyes of the person met, but to look 
a little above or below the eyes. But that 
is not a lesson in effectiveness, because it 
is not a lesson in frankness. 
Many people suppose that manners 
are not necessarily an expression of the 
internal nature; and indeed there are per- 
sons who have in many respects pleasing 
manners, whose real character could not 
be described as pleasing. Even such 
manners as those have their advantages; 
they make living with such persons 
pleasanter; they make business contact 
with them more agreeable, and more 
likely to be profitable. But still those 
manners are never the best. The best 
manners express the character of the per- 
son, and express it so clearly that the 
stranger has no doubt of the character. 
A glance reveals the character of such a 
man or such a woman; even a short con- 
tact, without intimate intercourse, satis- 
fies the stranger that he is speaking to
-P-A-G-E-71
AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 65 
a person of fine or noble character. So 
potent are the best manners. 
Let me recommend all of you to read 
Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essay on “ Man- 
ners.” I think it is the best thing he ever 
wrote. It is full of those contradictory 
passages which are found in all Emer- 
son’s writings; but there is truth often in 
the contradiction. It is often well to look 
at a truth from different and even oppo- 
site sides. Do not mind these difficulties; 
and take to heart the beautiful descrip- 
tions of character, and the wise exhorta- 
tions in that admirable essay. 
There is still another issue of a sound 
education which is too much neglected 
in both our schools and our colleges. 
Every boy here ought to bring away from 
this school some skill, or intellectual 
faculty, which will enable him to give 
pleasure to other people. We sometimes 
hear of boys going from school to col- 
lege who. find it difficult to get into the 
“social swim” of a college; or who go \ 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  66 PREPARATION FOR 
into athletics, though not particularly fit, 
because they hope, through athletics, to 
get into the “swim.” Now, the real way 
to win social success in any walk of life, 
high or low, among the poor or the well- 
to-do, the educated or the uneducated, — 
the real way to get social success in the 
tenement. house, or on the farm, or in the 
palace, — is to possess some power of 
giving pleasure to others. What sorts of 
powers, or gifts, or faculties may these 
be? There is a great variety of such at- 
tainments which will go far to make your 
_ future lives not only effective, but enjoy- 
able. Can you read aloud, for instance ? 
I have met many a time in my life men 
and women who by reading aloud with 
expression and charm gave, all through 
their lives, keen pleasure to great num- 
bers of men, women, and children. Can 
you play a musical instrument? Can you 
sing — if only one song? I have had oc- 
casion repeatedly, in the course of the 
last thirty years, to attend certain college
-P-A-G-E-73
  AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 67 
festivities for graduates and undergradu- 
ates together, where a professor in Har- 
vard College, now a man over fifty, was 
surely called upon to sing his only song. 
That one song, being a very good one, 
made him an entertaining and a welcome 
guest. 
I went once to a great meeting in a 
Mormon tabernacle in the town of Logan, 
an agricultural town having a popula- 
tion of five thousand souls. You know 
when a Mormon has paid his tithe to 
the church, he and all his family have a 
right to go to every entertainment pro- 
vided by the church without fee and 
without fear. There being five thousand 
people in the town of Logan, there were 
that night twenty-five hundred in the tab- 
ernacle — men, women, and children and 
babies in arms. The first number in the 
programme was the “Hallelujah Chorus” 
from the Messiah, four or five hundred 
men and women taking enthusiastic part 
in that sublime chorus. They sang ad-
-P-A-G-E-74
  68 PREPARATION FOR 
mirably and gave great pleasure to the 
whole assemblage. Then there were 
some speeches, few and not very long, 
yet rather too long for the patience of 
the audience, because they were waiting 
for the real thing they had come to hear. 
At last one man rose up and went to the 
front of the platform. He was a large 
man, tall, broad, and vigorous, with a 
brown beard down to his waist. He 
stood up alone, and with a superb bass 
voice sang a ballad. The whole scene 
might have come right out of the Mid- 
dle Ages; the traveling ballad-singer or 
troubadour; the listening populace. He 
had no support; no instrument accom- 
panied his voice. He sang verse after 
verse, always to the same tune. It was a 
long ballad of love and religion, and 
that entire audience hung on his song. 
There was a personal power of giving 
pleasure to others. 
I think you in this school devote 
some attention to acting plays. That is
-P-A-G-E-75
  AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 69 
a useful liberal art, because through it 
you can give pleasure to others. Some 
sort of artistic faculty should be one 
outcome of any thorough education, at 
school, at college, and in the university. 
We have at Harvard now a Cosmo- 
politan Club, that is, a club which rep- 
resents all the foreign elements at Har- 
vard in combination with the American 
element. In this Cosmopolitan Club there 
are Chinese, Japanese, Hindus, one Fili- 
pino, two or three Malays from Siam, a 
considerable number of Europeans— 
German, French, Swiss, Italians, Portu- 
guese —and also a large number from 
Great Britain and its dependencies. I 
lately went to a meeting of this club, 
and was very much interested to see 
how this great mixture of young men 
entertained each other. They all seemed 
to have some faculty by which they 
could amuse the club. A French stu- 
dent played the violin admirably ; a Ger- 
man played the piano; four Chinese  
-P-A-G-E-76
  7o PREPARATION FOR 
gave a serenade, so to speak, only I re- 
gret to say that the Chinese music was 
tather unintelligible to the Europeans 
and the Americans. That club finds no 
difficulty whatever in providing itself 
with entertainment from its own mem- 
bers. I wish I could say that the Ameri- 
cans did their part. It has been one of 
the defects in our education, at school 
and college, that we have not paid at- 
tention enough to this element in an 
effective education, — the acquiring of 
some capacity to give other people pleas- 
ure, a capacity which once acquired will 
last through life. 
May I ask your attention to the dif 
ferent values of sports and bodily ac- 
complishments, according as they are 
temporary or lasting ? There are many 
of the athletic sports which really last 
through life, or till advanced age. I have 
a friend in Boston, now seventy-five 
years of age, who still plays tennis with 
great activity. I heard of a farmer down
-P-A-G-E-77
  AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 71 
in Maine a week ago, who, being sev- 
enty-two years of age, danced the en- 
tire evening at a ball. And, by the way, 
I may mention that that is one of the 
accomplishments that every educated 
youth should acquire — dancing. It isa 
first-rate physical exercise, and there is 
great fun.in it, and it lasts. It is easy to 
mention many other sports which en- 
dure. Rowing, for instance, once ac- 
quired with a good stroke and a tough 
body that can keep up the stroke, will 
stand you in good stead through a long 
life; and you will always be glad that 
you acquired the skill in your youth, 
and if you live by the water a part of 
the year, you will have frequent oppor- 
tunities to avail yourself of that youthful 
accomplishment. 
Any outdoor sport which does not re- 
quire a team, so to speak, is valuable . 
through life, suchas horseback riding, sail- 
ing, skating, and hill-climbing. Those 
which require a combination of many
-P-A-G-E-78
72 PREPARATION FOR 
players, of course, cannot be kept up 
through life; because the individual can- 
not get himself into a team in later years. 
Hence, the relative undesirableness of 
such sports as football and baseball; be- 
cause they are merely temporary. They 
cannot be carried on through mature 
life to age. Give preference every time 
to those bodily accomplishments and 
to those esthetic intellectual delights 
which can be practiced all through life. 
That is as good a rule for the intellec- 
tual accomplishments as it is for the 
bodily. 
Now, I come to the last essential ele- 
ment of education for effectiveness. It is 
the acquisition of sound moral habits. 
There is no acquisition which can be 
more truly said to be essential to an ef- 
fective life than this acquisition of sound 
moral habits. In your position here you 
have every opportunity to acquire an 
habitual moral impregnability —a firm- 
ness of moral purpose which cannot be
-P-A-G-E-79
AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 73 
broken or impaired. Most young men, 
whose training for life is long, acquire 
this moral purpose before they come to 
college. They acquire it, some in their 
homes, some in their schools, and some 
in their churches; but unless a youth has 
acquired it by the time he is eighteen 
years of age, he is in a position of dan- 
ger. He is going out into a broader 
world where temptations are on every 
side. He is going toa city to live; he 
is going to a city college, where all the 
vices and evils of the world can be found 
if sought. He is going toa college in the 
country, where it used to be supposed 
that life was more innocent, or where 
temptations were less conspicuous. If 
that were ever true, it is no longer true. 
In the country college you may easily 
find, if you search for them, all the evils 
of the city. There is no slum worse than 
the rural slum. There is no population 
more degenerate than a country degen- 
erate population ; and our New England 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  14 PREPARATION FOR 
now presents many examples of the rural 
slum and the country degenerate. 
Now, what is to be done, when from 
such a shelter as this you go out into the 
world, where temptations assail you ? 
The first rule is— never experiment with 
any vice. In my own youth I often heard 
young men express an adventurous de- 
sire to try a vice, to try a vicious indul- 
gence. That is always intensely danger- 
ous. Never try any vicious practice; 
never do harm to a comrade by example 
or advice; and never have any share in 
doing harm to a woman. 
It is almost impossible to separate 
morality from religion. You know our 
public schools have been forced by the 
very nature of our population, mixed as 
regards both race and religion, to abol- 
ish religious services within the schools. 
There is, therefore, no systematic or di- 
rect moral training in most of the public 
schools. This is the situation, an almost 
» incomprehensible and wholly deplorable
-P-A-G-E-81
AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 75 
situation; for the schools are the chief 
hope of the country, as regards the pre- 
servation of free institutions, and the up- 
lifting of our extraordinarily heterogene- 
ous population. But must we not believe 
that some way is to be found out of this 
dangerous condition? Must we not be- 
lieve that a way will be found to unite 
again the teaching of essential morality 
with the teaching of a universal religion % 
I was once much instructed by Briga- 
dier-General Casey, the man to whom 
Congress entrusted the building of the 
Congressional Library for the sum of 
seven millions of dollars within a speci- 
fied number of years, and who accom- 
plished this double feat. When the job 
was almost finished, he needed inscrip- 
tions to stand over some allegorical stat- 
ues which adorned the upper part of the 
great reading-room. One of those statues 
represented Religion. He had tried to 
get satisfactory inscriptions from various 
persons, and had failed; and almost at
-P-A-G-E-82
76 PREPARATION FOR 
the last moment he asked me if I were 
willing to provide them. I undertook 
the work, and shortly sent to General 
Casey eight inscriptions to stand over 
the eight statues. One morning General 
Casey came to the building from’ his 
house, called his second in command, 
Mr. Bernard Greene, who is now Super- 
intendent of the Congressional Library, 
and said, “President Eliot has sent me 
these inscriptions for the statues in the 
reading-room. I like them all except the 
inscription over the statue of Religion. 
That is too Christian.” Now, General 
Casey was a Christian. “Too Christian!” 
I thought it singularly appropriate. It 
was, “ For we being many are one body 
in Christ, and every one members one 
of another.” That seemed to me to be 
an accurate description of sound religion 
in a republic. But it was “too Chris- 
tian”; and General Casey said to Mr. 
Greene, “ Won’t you write a letter to 
President Eliot, and ask him to provide 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 77 
another inscription for the statue of Re- 
ligion? I don’t feel well to-day; I am 
going home.” In an hour General Casey 
was dead. Under those circumstances I 
provided another inscription — Micah’s 
definition of religion, “ What doth the 
Lord require of thee but to do justly, to 
love mercy, and to walk humbly with 
thy God”; and that is the inscription 
which stands to-day in that superb room 
over the statue of Religion. 
Can we not have that religion taught 
in all our schools and colleges? In a 
democracy the moral lesson which needs 
to be taught at every turn is, “Do justly.” 
Let the collective force treat the individ- 
ual justly; let the chief industrial powers 
treat all their working people justly; let 
the Government be just. But justice 
is stern, like Nature. “Love mercy,” 
mercy to fellow-man, mercy to animals, 
mercy to children. “ Walk humbly with 
thy God.” O that we could teach in 
every school and college of our land
-P-A-G-E-84
  78 AN EFFECTIVE LIFE 
daily, hourly, this lesson of communion 
with the Great Spirit of Justice, Mercy, 
and Love. “Walk humbly with thy 
God.” That just describes the right re- 
lation of the human being with the 
Heavenly Father; that is a lesson you 
ought to learn here. There is no dogma 
in it; there is no creed in it; it simply 
declares the immanence of a loving 
Father. It invites to a personal sense of 
his presence and his love. And let me 
assure you that there is no sounder prin- 
ciple of education toward an effective 
and happy life than this, “ Walk humbly 
with thy God.”

THE SERVICE OF UNIVERSITIES TO A 
DEMOCRACY: 
I rounp the meeting this afternoon 
oné of the most interesting Harvard 
meetings I have ever attended. It was 
full of earnest thought for the Univer- 
sity, — for its honor, for its service. 
Then I fell to thinking what the Uni- 
versity really wanted from you. Some- 
times I hear it said that Harvard wants 
money from her sons. Yes, the Univer- 
sity does want money; it always has and 
always will, but that is by no means the 
first or the chief thing that Harvard 
wants from her sons. 
What the University desires from you 
is incessant illustration of the benefits to 
t An address at the dinner of the Associated Har- 
vard Clubs at St. Louis, December 5, 1903.
-P-A-G-E-86
  80 SERVICE OF UNIVERSITIES 
the individual and to the public of Har- 
vard’s training, as contributory to an in- 
dependent, steady leadership in the com- 
munity. Such a leadership is one of the 
great needs of our country, one of the 
great needs of any democracy, which 
tends inevitably to look not to the indi- 
vidual man thinking, but to the majority 
of votes. The educated man in our coun- 
try should try to think and speak for 
himself independently. 
Then the University asks of you all, 
each in his own place, the manifestation 
of courage. As I grow older, and see 
more and more of the various strifes and 
contests in which a democratic commu- 
nity engages, it seems to me that the 
great vice ci the democracy is timidity 
in all relations of life, —in politics and 
in professional service, but chiefly in 
business affairs. The extreme timidity 
of the trader and manufacturer is one of 
the most remarkable phenomena con- 
nected with the prevailing industrial war- 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  TO A DEMOCRACY 81 
fare. Now, the University expects from 
all her sons public courage. 
Lastly, Harvard University expects 
from all her sons integrity in private 
and public life. These are the services 
which Harvard asks of her children, — 
services not directly rendered to her, but 
to the communities in which they live, 
and yet the best service her sons can 
give her. 
I mentioned this afternoon the strong 
interest I felt in endeavoring to ascer- 
tain to what extent a college education 
had proved, within your observation and 
experience in your several towns and 
cities, to be available training for suc- 
cessful business life. I had an immediate 
object in view. There is a new phe- 
nomenon visible to those of us who 
study at close quarters the careers of 
Harvard graduates. Last year the ma- 
jority of all graduates that went out 
from Harvard College were going into 
business life. This is a new phenome-

TO A DEMOCRACY 83 
for the professions called learned was the 
chief function of a university. Just here 
has come the great expansion of the 
American universities during the last 
fifty years. 
This expansion has accompanied an 
extraordinary increase in the influence 
and power of the professions, those called 
learned, and those called scientific. If I 
were asked to mention the greatest in- 
tellectual change in my time, I should 
say that it was the increasing power of 
the professions. Harvard has had its full 
part in this expansion. We have claimed 
the new fields as ours; we are proud to 
work them; and we are proud of the ex- 
ploits of the young men we have turned 
into these new fields. I have seen half 
a dozen men here to-day, not beyond 
forty years of age, who have risen rap- 
idly to high places in the scientific pro- 
fessions. I see such facts every year, in 
all parts of the country, and I know 
they are true in good measure of all
-P-A-G-E-90
  84 SERVICE OF UNIVERSITIES 
universities worthy of the name in our 
country. 
Some one mentioned this afternoon 
that in going about Europe he encoun- 
tered in the principal capitals of Europe 
five Harvard graduates established there 
as ambassadors or ministers. It is a very 
interesting phenomenon, and directs at- 
tention again to the great expansion and 
increase of the influence and power of 
universities. 
These are delightful promises for the 
future of the American universities, and 
of our country. 
I have noticed in the past ten years 
much more than in the earlier years how 
frequent are the calls on Harvard offi- 
cials for information about the methods, 
practices, and policies of Harvard; and 
those inquiries do not come from this 
country alone. I have seen with a cer- 
tain satisfaction how high Harvard now 
stands in the list of the universities of 
the world. I have witnessed this year the
-P-A-G-E-91
TO A DEMOCRACY 85 
exchange of a young scholar who comes 
to us from the University of Paris for a 
young scholar who goes from us to the 
University of Paris, each to teach in the 
other’s university. 
We have an excellent institution at 
Cambridge called the Sabbatical Year, 
which means that every seventh year a 
professor may take leave of absence on 
half-pay. We find that we have gained 
power and influence by bringing to Har- 
vard temporary substitutes from other 
universities to take the place of our teach- 
ers on leave. It is a delightful exchange 
of men of weight between the universi- 
ties. 
And that reminds me to speak of a 
matter I touched on briefly this after- 
noon, a matter through which many of 
you gentlemen can perhaps serve the 
University, and your own homes, —the 
migration to Harvard of graduate stu- 
dents from the local university of your 
own residence. That is a kind of stu-

dent which we greatly like to entertain. 
This is a kind of migration which pro- 
motes unity among the educated people 
of our whole country, which promotes 
union among the different parts of our 
country through promoting mutual ac- 
quaintance among the educated men of 
all sections. 
‘When you occasionally come to Cam- 
bridge, perhaps on the tenth, the fif- 
teenth, the twentieth, the fiftieth anniver- 
sary of your graduation, you will find a 
large mechanical or external change in 
the University. The old buildings and 
old trees are carefully preserved; but we 
plant new ones. You will see new fences, 
new gates, new buildings, and a better 
care of the grounds— and, by the way, 
it was a Georgian, and not a graduate of 
Harvard either, who gave us, the other 
day, five thousand dollars to be spent on, 
shrubs, vines, and flowers for the deco- 
ration of the College Yard. There is, in- 
deed, a great external change at Har-

vard, and many internal changes by 
growth; but the informing spirit is the 
same. Our motto remains the same, — 
“Truth.” There never was a better, and 
there never will be.

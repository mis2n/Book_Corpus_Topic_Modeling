PREFACE 
The Maryland Folk-Lore Society was organized February 20, 1895, 
at the suggestion of Annie Weston Whitney, who had long been inter- 
ested in the purposes and work of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
Invitations to a meeting were responded to, and the objects of such an 
association were explained by Professor Henry Wood, of the Johns 
Hopkins University. Dr. J. H. McCormick, Secretary of the Washing- 
ton Branch of the Society, spoke upon the methods usually followed in 
collecting material, and he dwelt upon the opportunities offered in this 
part of the country for getting valuable folk-lore. 
The society was formed with seventeen members, who elected Pro- 
fessor Henry Wood as president, Miss Elizabeth T. King, vice-presi- 
dent, Miss Whitney as secretary, and Dr. Henry M. Hurd, treasurer. 
The Council consisted of Dr. Hurd, Professor Maurice Bloomfield, Mr. 
Zecharias, Miss Mary W. Milnor, Mrs. John C. Wrenshall and 
Mrs. Waller R. Bullock. 
The Maryland Folk-Lore Society drew two classes of members: 
University men, whose work bore, here and there, upon folk-lore inter- 
ests ; many of the other members belonged to Maryland families, some 
deeply versed in the general superstitions and in the family legends of 
their respective neighborhoods. The meetings, being open to the public, 
brought occasional visitors, who often contributed to the value of our 
discussions. 
Branch societies were formed at Washington and at Annapolis. Miss 
Hagner sent us a good collection of folk-lore in her papers ; Mrs. Ridout 
aided in Annapolis ; also Professor C. C. Marden, formerly of the Johns 
Hopkins, now of Princeton University, and Mrs. Marden, both members 
of our Maryland Branch. 
Among other valuable contributors, I should mention Miss M. Win- 
ter, Emmittsburg ; Miss Mary W. Speers, Anne Arundel Co. ; Miss 
Marian V. Dorsey, Dorchester Co. ; Miss Lizette W. Reese, Miss E. C. 
Seip, Mrs. John D. Early, Mrs. Wrenshall and others, of Baltimore. 
Some excellent papers presented at the meetings, I have not been able 
to include in this collection ; as, “ Traditions and Folk-Lore from Tal- 
bot Co., Md.,” Charles E. Shanahan ; “ Witch Stories and Conjuring 
in Western Maryland, ” C. W. R. Crum ; “ Satanic Possession in Planta- 
tion Life,” Mrs. Albert Sioussat ; “ Maryland Farm Names,” Dr. 
Hurd ; “ Horse-shoe Games,” from Emmittsburg; also many items 
given orally at the meetings. Prof. Wood told of variants of the Cin- 
derella tale, not generally known, that are in circulation among Negroes.  
-P-A-G-E-10
  6 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
To Professor Wood and to Dr. Hurd is due whatever success the So- 
ciety met with, through their wise counsel, their visits to the teachers of 
the schools for help, and through their faithful attention in general to 
the interests of the society. 
Annie W. Whitney was well qualified to handle the collection we had 
undertaken to arrange together. She possessed in her memory, from early 
associations in her country home in Western Maryland, a vast store of 
folk-lore ; she also understood its scientific value. Familiar with the 
beliefs of her locality, she also learned others from relatives of New 
England ancestry. In this way, and through correspondence, she was 
the largest contributor to this book. From 1904 to 1906 Miss Whitney 
was a member of the Council of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
It is hoped that this collection will arouse an interest in some of the 
many Marylanders whose memories are richly stored with lore of the 
folk. Old English customs, long since passed away elsewhere, linger still 
in Delaware and Southern Maryland, such as the celebration of Twelfth 
Night. In East New Market, on the Eastern Shore, on Hallowe’en Night, 
boys jump over bonfires or ride over them, as was done in Scotland. Old 
home ways continued late ; a friend of my generation still uses in her 
family blankets woven at her home in Anne Arundel County when she 
was married. From the early settlers we have among our population 
descendants of Germans, Bohemians, French, Dutch, Swedes, Swiss, 
Irish, Sootch, English, and Africans. Beginning at St. Mary’s, we have 
the first settlement by English Roman Catholics in 1634. At Annapolis, 
in 1649, was a settlement of English Protestants, refugees from Virginia. 
Frederick County, laid out in 1745, covered three fourths of the land 
area of the province, and was composed of German, Irish, and Scotch 
settlers. The German element has prevailed since the days when Thomas 
Schley, the schoolmaster, in 1735, led the one hundred families of the 
Palatinate into permanent possession of this region. Frederick County 
is now rich in folk-lore faith and practice. 
As early as 1681, we learn of the erection in Cecil County of Bohemia 
Manor, bought by Augustine Herman, of Bohemia, the first man in the 
colonies to receive papers of naturalization. Later, he sold some of his 
land to Dutch and French Labadists, Protestant refugees from Europe, 
whose names exist to this day in Cecil. Thomas H. Bayard and other 
prominent men have sprung from these Labadists and Bohemians. Into 
Cecil County came Swedes, Norwegians, and Dutch across the Dela- 
ware, living at Swedestown. Quakers of Penn’s settlement were thrown 
into Maryland by the new boundary of Mason and Dixon’s line ; while 
one fourth of the original Welsh tract is now in Cecil County. 
Into Carroll County came Scotch-Irish settlers; and Talbot import- 
ed between six and seven hundred Irish and British to the Eastern 
Shore. Lower down were Welsh again. 
Five shiploads of Acadians were landed in Maryland, helpless and 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
Folk-Lore from Maryland y} 
destitute. These were French Catholics, while those of Bohemia Manor 
were Protestant. Quakers came to Montgomery County, driven from 
other provinces, but finding home and honor here. 
Scattered through the two “Shores” are the negroes of Maryland. 
And lastly, in the islands of the Chesapeake we find a population of 
sailors and fishermen, descendants of a more prosperous stock ; they 
offer a good collecting ground to the lover of folk-lore. 
Thus in the State of Maryland we find original names still surviving 
in each county, proving an uninterrupted descent through two hundred 
and fifty years. And we find abiding with us the sayings and beliefs of 
the earliest settlers.

  The arrangement of the material contained on this volume follows 
on the whole the classification of Wuttke’s “ Deutscher Volksaberglan- 
ben. ” The data was classified and arranged in order by Dr. Isabel 
Gordon and Dr. Ruth Benedict, who also prepared the index. Repetitions 
in the text have been avoided and cross references have been relegated 
to the index in which is also included a full index of Fanny D. Bergen’s 
volumes of New England Folk-lore (Vol. IV and VII of the Memoirs of 
the American Folk-lore Society).

your lover is true and will return ; if it moves away from the wall, he will 
wander away from home.

XIII. CONJURING 
1675. In the Maryland Mountains, the diviner, conjurer, or healer 
of the sick must impart the gift to one of the opposite sex. 
1676. The “ conjurer ” of Maryland differs from the witch ; he is more 
like the sorcerer in that he is a doctor, sometimes called the “ conjur 
doctor. ” For a consideration he will supply the means for laying a spell 
on some on you wish to injure, or for removing a spell. He does less harm 
to cattle than the witch does, but more to human beings. The witch and 
the conjurer are, however, often confounded. : 
1677. Doctor’s medicine is unavailing in cases of spells or “ conjur-

which he mixed with the food of the person he wishes to harm. 
1686. Another method is to sift the powdered shell of the cuckoo egg 
into the hair of the enemy. 
1687. A childless negro woman declared her foe-woman had dosed 
her with “ rain-crow aiggs. ” 
This beliet may have its origin in the refusal of the cuckoo to build a 
nest of its own, and its success in dispossessing other birds of the homes 
they have constructed. The cuckoo wantonly destroys all eggs it may 
find in a captured nest, thus producing barrenness in that bird family.

quartz or of glass are buried in them, or in marks made in the ground by 
his body. He feels the pain as if they had been pressed into his own body.

This will not injure anyone but the person who has offended you.

shot, and put it by the kitchen door. If the person sees the bottle and 
picks it up, the spell is broken. If the knocks it over, the spell works. 
(Negro.) 
1696. Some years back no negro would pick up a bundle of any kind 
that stood in his path on his way to work in the morning. It was always 
supposed to have been put there to “conjure him”. Burying bottles 
with certain things in them is a favorite method of conjuring ; the 
bottles being buried where the one to be conjured will step over them. 
This special method is called “ plantin’ bottles fur’em.” These bottles 
contain a great variety of articles, and must be prepared by a hoodoo 
witch or “conjur” doctor. But an essential ingredient is something 
belonging to the person to be conjured, a bit of hair or finger nail or 
even a bit of clothing. 
1697. Take snakes and scorpions and dry their heads and reduce 
them to powder ; put this into whiskey. Drink it, and snakes and animals 
will appear in your veins and become very painful. They can be seen

removes them by beating the arm or leg, then bandaging the limb so 
they cannot get away. Then he cuts them out. 
1698. A snake is killed and dried and beaten into powder, and the 
powder is sprinkled over food or drink. When this is swallowed, the 
snake comes to life. Sometimes doctors can get it out. Sometimes, if 
milk is put near the patient, the snake will come out. 
1699. If you put salt in your shoes, people cannot conjure you. 
1700. A solution of salt and ashes thrown over anyone that has been 
“ conjured ” will destroy the spell.
-P-A-G-E-87

child under two years of age. Another says that three moles must be

the child by a woman who married a man with the same name as her own.

seen his father must blow into the child’s mouth. This is also a remedy 
for croup.

the infant first drinks water, because the amount of slobbering he will

persons in shrouds. Many people made their own to be ready when the 
time came.

insult to the dead to have the body cared for, prepared for burial, 
watched over or borne to the grave by any but the nearest of kin, or

terms at least. 
2046. In dressing a corpse for the grave, take care to pull off the cloth- 
ing over the feet, and as far as possible, put the fresh garments on

keep it from swelling. ” 
2048. Pillows are still removed from under the head of the dying,
-P-A-G-E-106
  102 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
“to make them die easier.” The pillow may have “ witch wreaths” in 
it, for witches can knot the feathers in a pillow and make wreaths of 
them, and these trouble the dying and hold back the soul. Besides this, 
the feathers of certain birds are harmful and disturb the dying and there 
is a chance that some of these may be in the pillow.

times near the house, going from there to the churchyard. (Emmitsburg, 
Md.)

2072. It is bad luck to be late for a funeral. 
2073. At a funeral all reflecting objects must be covered, not only 
out of respect for the dead, but because any one catching a glimpse of 
himself at the time would be likely to die very shortly after. (Mont- 
gomery Co. Md.)

the friends and neighbors to a funeral, is still practiced in Newburgh. 
Formerly it was the custom for the beadle to walk before the coffin, 
ringing a hand-bell all the way to the churchyard. 
2082. In some parts of Maryland a man on horseback announced the 
death of a prominent person by riding round with the news written on 
a black-edge sheet of paper. From house to house he would go and tell 
his tale. This custom prevailed chiefly in out-of-the-way places where 
paper was scarce. Sometimes notices of important deaths would be plac- 
ed in the pews of the churches. 
2083. Invitations on paper deeply edged with black were sent to the 
family and friends. Among those preserved in Baltimore is one telling 
of Mrs. E. P. ’s funeral. The note reads : “ You and your family are 
requested to attend the funeral of the late Mrs. E. P,, on Sunday 
afternoon at 3 o’clock from her late residence, 361 Eutaw Place.” The 
funeral notice of J. P. G. is on small paper, with a black edge, and 
simply says that “ it is from the house of J. W. P., South street, on 
tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock, June 6, 1845. ” Mrs. C. S. G. ’s and 
Miss T’s cards on highly glazed cardboard are inclosed.
-P-A-G-E-108
  104 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
Mme. Bonaparte’s funeral invitation, though of later date, is of the 
same order. The note reads : “ Mrs. —, you and your family are respect- 
fully invited to the funeral of Mme. Elizabeth Patterson, which will 
take place from the residence of her late son, No. 85 Park Avenue, on 
Monday next, April 7, at 10 o’clock. ” 
2084. Nearly all the old-time funerals were held at homes, and the 
clergy of many denominations then indulged in lengthy addresses. In 
some families the women never went to the graves, while others always 
did so. Flowers were in no great profusion, but there was usually a 
great number of carriages. Many private ones were in line, as people 
liked to show an extra mark of respect by sending their own carriages 
to the funeral of a loved friend or relative. At the home funerals, the 
houses were draped in white, large sheets covering furniture, glasses and 
pictures. 
2085. In the Western Md. Mountains it is customary in some churches 
for the men-mourners to wear their hats during the funeral ceremony 
2086. Negro pall-bearers and men-mourners wear a narrow piece of 
white muslin round the hat, with an end hanging down behind. 
2087. Until within quite recent years, men of the family and the pall- 
bearers were furnished with hat bands of crape with long ends, and with 
gloves. This custom may still be followed by old-fashioned people. 
2088. Formerly, the funeral sermon or address was an important 
part of the services. In country neighborhoods, people came from long 
distances. While a crowd assembled down stairs, the family were in the 
large hall on the second floor. The minister had to stand on the stairway 
landing, forced “ to make his remarks to the pattern on the wall paper. ” 
2089. Great importance is attached to the “ funeral sermon ” by the 
negroes, and by some religious sects of the whites. If not preached at 
the time of burial, it must be given later, sometimes a whole year elaps- 
ing between the funeral services and the sermon. 
2090. The tolling of the church bell at the time of a death was for- 
merly known as the “ passing” or “soul bell.” It served a double 
purpose in its time, even when not used to ward off evil spirits, for the 
number of strokes told the age of the departed, and it called on all good 
Catholics to breathe a prayer for the repose of the soul. 
2091. The bell is still tolled in some cases at the time of a funeral, 
though as a mark of respect rather than in the ancient belief that it 
keeps off evil spirits and gives the soul peace until the religious rites 
are over. 
2092. Step on a grave and you will never grow any more. 
2093. It is bad to disturb an old grave as by putting up a tomb- 
stone ; you will thus herald a death. (Chestertown, Md.) 
2094. If a grave be left open, another grave will soon be needed. 
2095. In the graveyards of Maryland, as elsewhere, the custom still 
prevails of laying the dead with the head to the west and the feet to 
the east. No choice is allowed in this matter.
-P-A-G-E-109
  Folk-Lore from Maryland 105 
2096. In the Moravian graveyard, the stones were formerly laid flat 
on the ground so that all the dead might rise together and all be equal. 
The different classes were separated ; married men, single men, mar- 
ried women, single women, and children, all having their own grounds. 
(Emmitts burg.) 
2097. Should a storm of rain follow the death of a friend, it is washing 
away the sorrow ; if it be a hard wind storm, the friend must be imper- 
fect, because it takes a great wind to blow him over the dark river. 
2098. When a person dies and you pass his door, you should hold your 
breath and not speak one word. 
2099. Never talk when passing the dead. It disturbs them. 
2100. Among many uneducated persons, there is a reluctance to 
speak of the dead at all, and if mention of them must be made, the name 
is avoided and some other term used. 
2io1. Fifty years ago it was customary to make pieces of jewelry 
out of hair mounted in gold, as mementoes of the dead. 
2102. Clothes of dead people will not wear long. They do not bring 
bad luck to the wearer, but if given to the poor, it is remarked that 
however well they may look at first, they do not last long. 
2103. If two deaths occur in a family there will be a third within the 
year. 
2104. When the Chinese bury their dead in the States, they place 
money in the coffin, and something to serve as food for the soul on its 
way to the spirit land. 
3. DeatTu aT SEA. 
2105. A wailing sound heard at sea, caused by the swaying of the 
masts or anything else, the old seamen say is the moaning of the souls 
of sailors lost at sea. 
2106. Sailors who die by drowning are transformed at once into 
Cape Horn pigeons, called, also, Mother Carey’s chickens. Officers 
become gulls, and captains enter the big albatrosses. 
2107. A Baltimore sea-captain became very angry when a passenger 
on his vessel attempted to shoot a gull. “ They are the spirits of drowned 
sailors,” he cried. 
2108. If a bald person dies, he will become a fish, and remain in that 
form until he collects enough hair to make a wig. He can collect only 
one hair a month and at a certain phase of the moon. (Negro.)

The 13th. 
Yesterday was Friday the 13th of the month, and either of these 
facts, according to all precedents, should have operated to cause a 
falling off in the usual number of marriage licenses issued. This far 
exceeds the number usually issued on Friday. It has happened that not 
a single marriage license was issued on a Friday, and this record has not 
been approached by any other day on which the court was open. It has 
often happened that only one or two licenses were issued on Friday. 
The 13th of the month is also considered unlucky, according to the 
record. ”

3. NEW YEAR’S DAY. 
2219. At one time. New Year’s Eve was a favorite occasion for pri- 
vate “ masquerade parties,” at which all the guests were masked and 
remained so until the clock struck twelve, when the masks were removed 
and the identity of the guests revealed. At the present time a large pro- 
portion of the community may be found on the stroke of twelve engaged 
in silent prayer within the various churches, for “ watch meetin’s, ” 
originally confined to one or two sects, are now held in churches of 
various denominations. Among the negroes, attending “ watch meet- 
ing ” is a universal custom, and is looked upon as part of one’s religious 
duty. The custom of ushering in the New Year by the ringing of bells 
and chimes and the blowing of whistles from factories and steamboats 
has recently been introduced into the cities and towns of the state. 
This begins as the town clock strikes twelve, and lasts five minutes. In 
some of the smaller towns, the tolling of the bells announces the death 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
  TI2 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
2 of the Old Year before the new one is rung in. During the “ ringing in, ’ 
those who have remained at home exchange greetings, while from room 
to room where sleepers are aroused, may be heard the calls “ Happy 
New Year!” “Happy New Year!” “ Same to you!” “I said it first !” 
There is always an effort to give the greeting before the person addressed 
can do so. Among those who take no part in any general celebration, 
as the Old Year dies and the New Year comes some may say : 
“Ring out the old, 
Ring in the new, ” 
“ Ring out the false, 
Ring in the true.” 
2220. The custom of making New Year’s calls, once universal, has 
become in some parts of the state a thing of the past. There was a time 
when a woman felt it almost a disgrace to be seen on the street on New 
Year’s Day ; she must be either in her own home or in that of a friend, 
“receiving. ” This “ receiving” was a simple affair at first, when every 
home was open for the reception of New Year’s greetings from the male 
friends of the family, and the table was spread with “ good things. ” 
Many a Maryland hostess made herself famous through the making of 
egg-nog, apple toddy, spiced oysters, fruit cake and various other good 
things she set before her guests on that day ; every hostess had her own 
particular receipts, and many of these are still in the possession of de- 
scendants of the originators. Among the members of the “ New England 
colony,” that settled in Baltimore in the early part of the last century, 
there were those who always expected on such occasions a piece of old 
fashioned New England mince pie. One old gentleman for fifty consec- 
utive years visited the same house to offer his New Year’s greetings 
and received from the same hand a piece of mince pie. 
The custom of calling on New Year’s Day afforded an opportunity 
to young men to increase their acquaintance among women, and was 
often eagerly sought. It was customary for three or four young men to 
take a carriage together and “go the rounds.” At any house where 
one was known, all were made welcome for that day. Any further acquain- 
tance was at the option of the women on whom they called. There would 
perhaps be a cordial invitation to call again ; or there would be no hint 
of any kind, and a failure to recognize when meeting on the street or at 
some future entertaiment, closed the acquaintance. The simplicity of 
this custom disappeared as full dress receptions with elaborate “ spreads” 
became the order of the day. This led in many cases to hanging dainty 
baskets on the door-bells to announce that the ladies of the house were 
“not receiving,” but would like to have the cards of the callers. In a 
short time the whole custom of receiving on New Year’s Day died out 
and in its wake came house parties at country homes, theatre parties 
and fox hunts. A woman no longer feels it a disgrace to be seen on the 
street ; on the contrary, she is the one who does the visiting now, meet-
-P-A-G-E-117
Folk-Lore from Maryland 113 
ing her friends at her club where a New Year’s collation is served, or 
at the houses of those friends who are “ at home ” on that day. Dinners 
and suppers are the order of the day at the men’s clubs. 
2221. Importance may be attached to the nature of the “ first-foot, ” 
or the person who first enters the house after the birth of the New Year. 
This must in all cases be a man or a boy. Some make a point merely of 
sex and arrange to have certain men or boys of the family on hand “ to 
bring in the luck ; ” or they take advantage of the early visit of the mail- 
man, persuading him to be the first to enter. Others attach great impor- 
tance to the complexion of the first-foot, though in regard to this a 
variety of opinions exists. In slavery times a negro man was often 
chosen and ordered to be on hand at the proper time to be the first-foot. 
Some Marylanders still consider the negro necessary as a first-foot, and 
believe “ the blacker the man, the better luck.” Others insist merely 
on a dark-haired man ; on the other hand he is believed by some to bring 
misfortune, the luck bringer being a red-haired or a “ light-haired man. ” 
We have known a Scotchman living in this country who always 
spent New Year’s Eve out of the house, that he might, after midnight, 
be his own first-foot. Luck was formerly supposed to attach itself to 
and follow the first-foot himself. 
Should it be necessary for a woman to enter the house before a man, 
a member of the family need only go out of the house and enter with 
the woman “ kitchen way.” 
If a man enter a house on New Year’s before a woman, a man will 
be the first to die in the family. If a woman come in first, a woman 
will be the first to die. 
2222. The child born on New Year’s Day must be carefully guarded 
or it will not live the year out.

If west, much milk, and fish in the sea ; 
If north, much cold and storms there will be ; 
If east, the trees will bear much fruit ; 
If northeast, flee it man and brute. 
2225. It is bad luck to pass a woman, especially a red-haired one, on 
New Year’s morning ; but good luck to pass a man. 
2226. If on New Year’s Eve, you see your shadow without a head 
on it, you will die before the year is out. 
2227. The first letter received after the beginning of the New Year 
will bring either joy or sorrow. 
2228. Good luck on New Year’s Day will bring luck all the year.

long for his wagon, and wanting an augur, he had to send two miles to 
get it. Going home, his wagon upset, and just as he was about to start 
again a large rattle-snake nearly bit his horses. He never worked again 
on Ascension Day. 
2289 A. At the Bethesda state quarries miners refused to work on 
Ascension Day. Managers tried to break up this superstition and for 
two years succeeded. The men again refused ; there had been fatal 
accidents both years. 
2290. Ascension Day has always been held sacred to fishing. 
2291. It is the custom to go fishing on Ascension Day, for the reason 
that on that day the fish “ascend” the creeks. 
2292. A teacher in Baltimore said : 
“ My mother never allowed us to sew on Ascension Day, It would be 
more sinful than sewing on Sunday. It is the holiest day of the year. ” 
2293. If you sew on Ascension Day, you will be struck by lightning. 
2294. It is bad luck to sew on Ascension Day, because each stitch 
you take pierces the Savior’s side. 
2295. The most holy day of the year in parts of Western Maryland 
is Ascension Day. 
2296. From a newspaper of York, Pa. May 22: 
Sewing was practically suspended in York yesterday because of an 
old superstition that she who plies a needle on Ascension Day is in 
danger of being struck by lightning. Many of the shirt factories in the 
city worked shorthanded and some were compelled to shut down because 
of this superstition. Tailors found it impossible to keep women garment 
workers at work as did also dress-makers. 
14. WuitsuN-Day. 
Fifty days after Easter Sunday. 
2297. Ifyou desire good luck in a special enterprise, wear all new 
clothes on Whitsun-day. 
2297 A. It is bad luck to cut your finger nails on Whit-Monday. 
2298. If it rains on Whitsun-day, and the May Blossoms (called pinks 
by the country people,) are blooming, then it will rain seven Sundays 
in succession. 
2299. If it rains on Whitsun-tide, it will rain for seven Sundays in 
succession. 
2300. A child born on Whit Sunday, or the day after, is supposed to 
die an unnatural death.

15. Apri, Foor’s Day. 
2301. The first of April has always been celebrated as All Fool’s Day. 
2302. The April-first greeting of a teacher who taught about 1864 
was invariably, “ Oh, come out and see the flock of wild geese!” 
2303. The little children would catch each other by calling, “Oh, 
look at that little bird,” “It’s snowing!” “ You have a black mark 
on your face,” etc. Tying a rag on the back of the dress, and pinning 
a label on the back were popular. 
2304. Filling the sugar bowl with salt, stuffing a biscuit with cotton 
and offering an empty egg shell at breakfast, were good old tricks. 
2305. Glueing a penny on the pavement, stuffing an old purse with 
paper and dropping it, tying handkerchiefs to strings and dropping 
them, then pulling them back when almost to be picked up were favorite 
performances. Some sent false orders or April Fool messages through 
the mails. 
16. May Day. 
2306. The may pole, with its garlands of flowers and its songs and 
dances was an early colonial institution and has survived until quite 
recently. 
2307. Gathering flowers in the early morning and hanging baskets 
of them on door knobs was the last May Day custom to disappear. 
2308. In and around Annapolis the day was long known as St. Tami- 
na’s Day, for it was the date set apart by the St. Tamina Society to 
celebrate the memory of the ancient Delaware Chief, Taminend, “ whose 
equal was never known.” Both Pennsylvania and Maryland selected 
this day on which to honor the Chief. In the Journal of a southern girl 
visiting in Philadelphia, is the following item under date of May 1, 1771. 
“This morning was ushered in by the ringing of bells in memory of 
King Tammany as he used to be called ; but now I think they have got 
him canonized, for he is now celebrated as St. Tammany. ” (Penna., 
May 188r.) 
Eddis, in his Letters writing from Annapolis, in 1771 says, 
“The Americans on this part of the continent have likewise a saint 
whose history is lost in fable and uncertainty. The first of May is however 
set apart to the memory of St. Tamina, on which occasion the natives 
wear a piece of buck’s tail, etc.” The St. Tamina Society seems to have 
been founded first in Maryland and to have been in existence there 
until 1841. In Pennsylvania it practically died out during the revolution, 
with spasmodie resurrections from time to time afterwards. 
Why Taminend should have been honored first in Maryland, it is 
difficult to say, for he is associated with the people of Pennsylvania, 
and is said to have been under the elm tree with William Penn. His
-P-A-G-E-124
  120 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
signature to a deed giving property to the latter is still in existence and 
is “a snake not tightly coiled. ” 
Various legends are told of this great “ chief of many days ;” he had 
a hand to hand encounter with the devil; had personal intercourse 
with good spirits ; performed miracles, and when his time came to die, 
set fire to his wigwam, but being too pure and good to perish in the flames, 
was translated. 
2309. The May pole was a feature in the celebration of St. Tamina’s 
Day in Annapolis. It was erected in a public place and garlanded with 
flowers, the members of the St. Tamina Society forming a ring round 
it, danced the Indian war dance “ with many other customs which they 
had seen exibited by the children of the forest.” All citizens who chose 
to take part in this wore a piece of buck’s tail in their hats. There was 
an evening entertainment to which general invitations were issued. In 
the midst of the dancing, the members of the Society, dressed like 
Indians, rushed into the assembly with a war whoop which was followed 
by war songs and dances of the Indians. 
Before the evening was over, a collection was taken up.! 
The celebration of the day in Philadelphia differed from this, a wig- 
wam outside the city taking the place of the May pole. To the Indian 
dances and war songs, was added the calumet of peace. 
2310. If you buy a broom in May, you will sweep the family away. 
2311. If you plant a pole on May Day, no hawks or crows will steal 
your chickens. 
2312. There is a certain day of the year, either the 22nd of February 
or the 1st of May, when, if you want your bees to stay near home when 
they swarm, you must not leave the house alone. 
2313. Move your bees on the first of May. 
2314. On the first of May look down into an old well, not in use, and 
you will see the face of your future husband. 
2315. If on the first of May at midnight you set the table, your future 
husband or wife will knock at the door. 
2316. If you look down a well on the first day of May, at noon, you 
will see an image of your future husband ; but if you are not going to 
be married, you will see a coffin. 
2317. If you look down a well the first of May, you will see your future. 
2318. For Freckles : If you wash your face on the first of May in stump 
water, your freckles will go away. The first day of May, go to the rye 
field, and as soon as the sun strikes the rye, rub your face in the rye 
three times and your freckles will leave. 
2319. For Freckles: Commencing on the first of May, you must 
neither speak, eat nor wash. Go down stairs backwards in your night 
gown, wash your face in the dew that collects on the clover.

summer night. 
IQ. JULY32, 
2325. July second. “ Mary comes over the mountain, ” according 
to the Almanack of Hagerstown, is a common saying among the moun- 
tain people of Maryland. 
The Virgin Mary goes over the mountain to visit Elizabeth and returns 
after forty days have passed. The weather on that day foretells what it 
will be for the next six weeks. 
2326. In western Maryland there is a saying of the same kind. “ Mary’s 
gone over the Mountain.” If clear, forty days of clear weather will 
follow ; if rainy, forty days of rain will follow.

23. Peccy Stewart Day, OcToBER IQTH. 
2332. A special Maryland day is October 19th, commemorating the 
burning of the Peggy Stewart, in 1774, when the owner, Mr. Stewart, 
was compelled to burn the vessel with its cargo of tea in the harbor of 
Annapolis. 
24. NOVEMBER 22ND (SAILING Day). 
2333. “Sailing day” is a recent Maryland festival to celebrate the 
departure of the Maryland pilgrims from England, in “The Ark and 
the Dove.” 
The Knights of Columbus instituted this day a few years ago as their 
particular feast day; since then other patriotic organizations have 
adopted the day. 
25. HARVEST CUSTOMS. 
2334. It was customary during corn husking for the finder of the 
“red ear ” to throw it to the prettiest girl, and then chase her until 
he had caught and kissed her. Then they danced together. 
2335. “ Harvest homes” are observed in the churches of different 
denominations, the fruits and vegetables that are used being given to 
thepoor. 
2330. Harvesters were in some places liberally supplied with a drink 
of cold water, ginger and molasses, and they always had an extra dinner 
given them. In other places ginger bread and egg-nog was the standard 
treat, and sometimes beer was substituted, this being in most cases 
home made, and made from hops. 
The last day of the harvest was celebrated as a “ Harvest Home, ” 
and the evening was given over to merriment, the neighbors coming 
from miles around to take part. 
2337. There were also husking parties ; and a feature of this in some 
places was a chicken potpie baked in a Dutch oven, ! sweet potatoes 
and preserves being its necessary accessories. The favorite games at 
these husking parties were “ sock-a-bout, ” “ foul and fair, ” “ and watch 
the candle. ” 
26. HALLOWE’EN. 
2338. Hallowe’en has been called “ nut-crack night” from the num- 
ber of nuts and apples used in the “ projects” so generally performed 
at this season. 
1. Dutch ovens are still used in the mountainous counties. 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  Folk-Lore from Maryland 123 
2339. If you are born on Hallowe’en, you can see and read things in 
dreams. 
2340. On Hallowe’en, melt some lead and pour it from an iron spoon 
into cold water. The form that it assumes will be prophetic of your future 
life. One girl who tried it saw the lead take the shape of a coffin, and her 
husband took up the trade of an undertaker after her marriage. 
2341. On Hallowe’en, run around the square with your mouth full 
of pins and needles. Come home and look in the glass, and you will see 
your future husband, if you are to be married ; but if not, you will see 
a coffin. 
2342. If you drop two needles into a bowl of water, you can tell 
by the way they move in the water whether you and your lover will 
come together. 
2343. On Hallowe’en, put some apples in a tub of water, and name 
them with a label. Let a girl kneel over the tub, shut her eyes, put her 
hands behind her, and try to catch an apple with her teeth. The one 
she succeeds in catching will be her future husband. 
2344. Suspend some apples, labeled with names over a doorway, 
blind-fold a girl with her hands behind her, and let her try to bite an 
apple. The one she bites, will be her future husband. 
2345. Walk around your house three times or around the town, with 
a mouthful of water in your mouth, and you will marry the first man 
you meet. 
2346. Walk into a room backward at twelve o’clock at night on 
Hallowe’en, looking over your left shoulder, and you will see your future 
husband. 
2347. It is an old custom to throw corn at doors and windows on 
Hallowe’en. 
2348. On Hallowe’en, cut the rind off an apple, throw it over your 
shoulder, and it will form the initial of your lover’s name. The correct 
way to do this is to select first a large apple : 
It must be carefully pared and swung cautiously around the head. 
If the peel breaks, there is calamity ahead and an interrupted love. If it 
break twice — once while being pared and again while being thrown — 
then it means still more disaster ; for the twice-parted peel means 
twice-parted love. The peel must be twirled around the head three 
times and then must be tossed lightly from the finger. It will find 
its way in a great swirl to the floor, and there it will lie, ready to be 
read. If the moon is full the peeling must be read from the north ; if the 
time be midnight it must be read from the south ; if the night be rainy it 
must be read from the east, and if it be clear it is read from the west. 
The letter is studied out, and the girl knows what letter shall be embroi- 
dered upon her linen at her marriage. 
2350. Put three chestnuts on a hot stove. Name one for yourself and 
the others for two men. If one jumps and bursts, that lover will be
-P-A-G-E-128
  124 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
unfaithful ; if one blazes or burns, that one has some regard for the one 
making the test. If the girl’s nut burns with one of the lovers, they will 
marry before the next Hallowe’en. 
2351. On Hallowe’en go chestnutting with a party. The one finding 
the first burr will be the first to marry. If the burr opens easily, the love 
will not last long, if it is hard to open the love will last. 
2352. Take three bowls and put colored water in one, clear water in 
another and leave the third empty. Blindfold each of the party in turn 
and let them. put the left hand in one of the bowls. If it is in the clear 
water, the one trying it will marry a maid or a bachelor ; if the colored 
water is chosen, a widow or a widower will fall to the lot of the diviner ; 
if the empty bowl is selected, a life of single blessedness is all that can 
be excepted of the future. 
2353. If you cut out the letters of the alphabet in paper and put them 
face downward in a basin of water and place the basin under your 
bed, you will find in the morning the letters of your future husbands 
name turned facing you. 
2354. Blindford a girl and turn her round three times, and if she cannot 
blow out a lighted candle placed in the room, she will never marry. 
2355. Go into a garret at twelve o’clock at night, throw a ball out 
of the window, and say, “I wind, who unwinds ?” (Winding the ball 
on your own side) Repeat the words several times, or until they are 
answered by a voice that gives the lover’s name. 
2356. Take your under-garment off at midnight on Hallowe’en, wash 
it backwards, dry it backwards and then sit down before the stove 
backwards, without speaking, and if you are to marry, you will see 
your future husband come down the steps; if you are not to marry, a 
black cat will come down the steps, followed by four men carrying a 
coffin. 
2357. On Hallowe’en, hang an apple on a string attached to a nail. 
The number of people passing under it will indicate the number of 
months that will elapse before you will be married. 
2358. If you make biscuits without talking on Hallowe’en night, and 
jump in bed backwards, you will see your future husband if the room 
is dark. 
2359. Bake small cakes, and put in one a piece of money, in another 
a ring, in a third a rag, and in a fourth a thimble. You can tell who will 
be rich, who will be married, who will be poor, and who will earn her 
own living. 
2360. Take three dishes, and in one put clear water, in another milky 
water, and have the third one empty. Blindfold a girl, and if she touches 
the clear water, she will marry a bachelor ; the milk water, a widower ; 
the empty one, she will not marry at all. This must be tried three 
times. 
2361. If you eat a salt cake and go to bed backwards without speak-
-P-A-G-E-129
Folk-Love from Maryland 125 
ing, you will dream that your future husband will bring you a drink 
of water. If the cup be of silver or gold, you will be wealthy ; if of glass, 
moderately rich, and if of tin, you will be poor. If you help yourself 
to a drink, you will never be married, and if the vessel out of which you 
drink is a gourd, you will be a pauper. 
23602. A salt cake was eaten by a girlin Emmittsburg on Hallowe’en. 
She went to bed without speaking, and dreamed that she was sitting 
in a certain house looking out of a window and longing for someone to 
bring her a drink of water, and getting weary of waiting, she went into 
the kitchen and helped herself from a tin bucket with a tin cup. Return- 
ing to the window, she was just in time to see a dark-haired man ride 
away. She was never married, and is terribly poor. 
2363. Make nine corn balls and write three men’s names three times, 
putting the names in the balls, and dropping in water. The name of 
the man that is exposed the most, will be your future husband. 
2364. Listen outside of windows on Hallowe’en, and the first man’s 
name you hear will be the first name of your future husband. It is said 
you must have a mouthful of water which you must neither swallow 
nor throw out until you have heard the name. 
2305. One Hallowe’en trick is to go backwards into a cabbage bed 
and in that position pick a cabbage, and the name of one’s lover will 
be pronounced. 
2366. “ One Hallowe’en night my father and some boys were sitting 
on a bench concocting plans for raiding a cabbage bed, when two balls 
of fire exploded before them. 
2307. “ Two boys who had been raiding a cabbage bed on Hallowe’en 
night, were going through a wood when two balls of fire exploded before 
them. ” 
2308. If you walk backward into a cabbage bed, you can tell whether 
you will marry a fat man or a thin one by the kind of cabbage you 
stumble over. A tall cabbage denotes a tall man and if you stumble 
over something else, you will not marry at all. 
2369. If on Hallowe’en, a girl takes a mirror and walks twenty paces 
backwards, her future husband will look in the glass. 
2370. If you hold a candle and stand before a mirror on Hallowe’en, 
you will see your lover look over your shoulder. 
2371. On Hallowe’en, if you walk backwards into a garden and pull 
up a cabbage behind you, you can tell the condition of your future hus- 
band. A fine large cabbage means a handsome man; a deal of dirt 
means wealth, and a poor lean cabbage means a poor -man. 
2372. On Hallowe’en pull a cabbage and put it under your bed, and 
do not speak after it is pulled. Whatever you dream of will come true. 
2373. On Hallowe’en, pin a garter to the wall, saying as you do do, 
“T pin my garter to the wall, I hope to hear my true lover call.” During 
the night you will dream of raps, and whoever it is that raps will be your
-P-A-G-E-130
  126 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
husband. If he passes you water in a glass, he will be rich, but if in a tin 
cup, he will be poor. 
2374. If you write a list of seven names on Hallowe’en, and put it 
under your pillow, you will marry the one you dream of. 
2375. The girl who is in love with four men can decide between thein 
on the night of Hallowe’en. She must light four candles and seat herself 
in front of them, naming each candle for one of the four men. The candle 
that burns longest will be the most constant. The one that burns most 
evenly is the one that will make her happiest ; while the one that flickers 
and goes out is the one that will make her life a series of heartachese 
and will fill life with its bickerings; while the candle that burns up the 
quickest indicates a short and brilliant life. 
2376. In order to see the face of one’s future mate, one need only 
stand before a mirror in a darkened room and eat an apple in front of 
a mirror at midnight. The face of the future husband will appear over 
the shoulder. 
2377. On Hallowe’en, if you walk backwards toward a mirror with 
one in your hand, you will see a man in the one behind you. 
2378. On Hallowe’en night, walk backwards down stairs with a 
candle in one hand and a mirror in the other, and on the last step you 
will see the man you are going to marry looking into the mirror. 
2379. Stand before a mirror on Hallowe’en at midnight, eat an apple, 
and brush your hair for some time, and then you will see the face of 
your future husband in the glass. 
2380. If you eat dumb cake on Hallowe’en night, walking up the 
stairs backwards, and do not speak from the time you eat it until the 
next morning, your future husband will bring you a drink in the night. 
2381. Put popcorn, nuts or apple seed sin the ashes of a fire ; name 
them, and whichever pops first is your lover. 
27. PATRON Satnts’ Days. 
2382. Eddis, the Englishman, in his “ Letters” from Annapolis, in 
1773, tells of the celebration in Maryland of the Patron-Saints’ Days 
in the colony ; and they are still festival seasons in Baltimore : 
St. Andrews, St. George’s, St. David’s and St. Patrick’s, most festive 
of all, with its green banners carried in procession through the streets. 
And there is St. Thomas’s Day,

2385. It has become a custom with The Woman’s Literary Club of 
Baltimore to decorate the graves of the authors and artists of Maryland 
on All Souls’ Day. 
30. NOVEMBER 2IST. 
2386. The 21st of November settles the winter. Whatever kind of 
weather we have then will predominate until spring. 
31. CHRISTMAS. 
2387. In making a study of current Christmas customs, members 
of the Maryland Folk-Lore Society 1 sent out a questionaire to different 
sections of the State, and received sixty-six replies, which represented 
the ways of about one hundred families. 
These observances of the season seem to be handed down by the mo- 
ther, while the customs of the father’s childhood are lost entirely or pre- 
served in a very fragmentary manner. 
Everywhere they had the tree, the stockings, presents, cornucoptas 
of candy and fancy ornaments ; formerly, most of these articles were 
hung upon the tree, each person present at the lighting or the chief 
ceremonies about the tree, receiving a gift. 
There are various ways of undressing the tree as well as of dressing 
it. In one case the undressing was by “ switching the tree,” hung prin- 
cipally with candy. A childrens’ party is given and the mother with a 
little stick, switches the tree and as the good things fall, the children 
scramble for them, Sometimes the children dance to music around the 
tree, singing, “ Here we go round the’Christmas tree ; ” suddenly the 
music stops, the dance ceases and each child is given a candy cane, a 
bag or box of candy or sometimes little gifts. 
Such parties were very common in my young days at certain houses, 
the presents given with the bonbons were always very pretty and worth 
keeping. The tree would be lighted at any preferred time during Christ- 
mas week. Among intimate families, they had to fit in the different 
dates, though there were one or two families who kept the same day 
from year to year ; and no one ventured to encroach upon their choices. 
In some parts of the West and South, and in parts of New England, 
a Christmas tree in a private family was unknown. A western woman 
says she saw her first Christmas tree in Germany after she was married 
2388. The stocking is always identified with Santa Claus, while the 
tree is only sometimes supposed to be his work. 
1. Mrs. C. C. Marden.
-P-A-G-E-132
  128 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
He may find the stockings hung in one place in this house ; and in 
another, elsewhere ; but he always finds them, whether by the tree, by 
the chimney, or the bed post, on the wall, on the door knobs, on the 
window, or hanging from chairs. Sometimes a new stocking is used, 
sometimes the oldest, past wearing. An extra long one should have a 
knot in it as good form to Santa Claus. 
In many families the servants hang stockings, which are usually 
provided for them and hung by the “ white folks, ” and generally depend 
from the kitchen mantel, though the servants’ door knobs are often 
used if the other stockings hang in the mother’s bedroom, Ours hung 
from heavy mahogany chairs in the back parlor before the open fire 
place, as the place most convenient to the overburdened Santa Claus. 
Many weary Christmas Eves have I labored over these stockings of 
many sizes, belonging to members of three generations gathered for the 
Christmas meeting ; and no one was too old to believe, and to demand 
his stocking filled with “ goodies.” Sometimes plates were used for the 
servants and were placed on a side table in the dining-room. 
The filling of the stocking varies. Almost invariably an orange fills 
the toe ; in the heel may be a bit of jewelery or a coin or whatever is 
the most valuable gift, or a penny for luck and a “ quarter ” for church. 
A naughty child may get a switch from Santa. 
2389. Notes are written to Sante Claus, or the children call up the 
chimney what they most desire; or cry “ Christmas gift!” “ Caught 
the other Christmas gift!” 
2390. Some Baltimore children always put a pillow in the chimney 
place that Santa Claus might alight in comfort. 
2391. In former days in Maryland manors, the servants would select 
the great Christmas log and they soaked it in the creek that it might 
last the longer. Old servants would come home to see Master and Mis- 
tress, and receive gifts of clothing and money, with rum, gin, eggnog 
or apple toddy as a Christmas treat. 
2392. “ Cattle low and rooster crow” for a month before Christmas, 
to herald the coming anniversary. 
2393. At midnight, on Christmas, cattle kneel down to pray, and 
water in springs turns to wine. 
2394. On the stroke of twelve on Christmas Eve night, all the roosters 
begin to crow. 
2395. At twelve o’clock on Christmas night cattle talk. 
2396. Cows are supposed to get down on their knees at twelve o’clock

5. ASSEVERATIONS. 
2641. “I cross my heart,” at the same time making the form of 
the cross over the heart to prove that the truth is being told. It is also 
used as a solemn promise that what is about to be told by another will 
be kept inviolate. 
2642. “ Over the right shoulder ” and “ Over the left ” are expressions 
used to designate the truth or falsehood of a statement. The latter is 
often said under the breath in the hope that the other party may not 
hear it. 
“ Honor bright, ” “ Really truly, ” “ Honest Injun, ” “ Hope I’ll die, ” 
are other asseverations. 
2643. “ Deed and deed and double deed ” is another expression used 
to emphasize the truth of a statement and is often accompanied by the 
following rhyme or a variant. 
2644-5. Deed, deed and double deed, I sowed a garden full of seed, 
When the seed began to grow, like a garden full of snow, 
When the seed began to melt, like a garden full of hemp, 
When the hemp began to peel, like a garden full of steel, 
II
-P-A-G-E-166
  162 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
When the steel began to rust, like a garden full of dust, 
When the dust began to fly, like an eagle in the sky, 
When the sky began to roar, like a lion at the door, 
When the door began to crack, like a hickory on my back, 
When my back began to smart, like a penknife in my heart, 
When my heart began to bleed, I thought’ twas time to die indeed. 
Variant : 
When my heart began to bleed, like a garden full of seed, 
When my heart began to bleed, deed, deed and double deed, 
When my heart began to bleed, deed, deed and double deed, 
When my heart began to bleed, like a bloody hog indeed. 
Variant beginning : 
Indeed, indeed in double deed. 
2646. A man of words and not of deeds 
Is like a garden full of weeds, 
And when the weeds began to grow 
*Twas like a garden full of snow. 
Old English Version : 
2647. Aman of words and not of deeds 
Is like a garden full of weeds ; 
And when the weeds begin to grow, 
It’s like a garden full of snow ; 
And when the snow begins to fall, 
It’s like a bird upon the wall ; 
And when the bird away does fly, 
It’s like an eagle in the sky ; 
And when the sky begins to roar, 
It’s like a lion at the door ; 
And when the door begins to crack, 
It’s like a stick across your back ; 
And when your back begins to smart, 
It’s like a penknife in your heart ; 
And when your heart begins to bleed, 
You’re dead and dead and dead indeed. 
6. Sones. 
2648. My experience with the negro melodies in Maryland has been 
with songs with a body movement as accompaniment. Sometimes this 
was simply the clapping of the hands ; sometimes the shuffle ; some- 
times both ; sometimes shuffling round the fire which was a necessary 
adjunct no matter how hot the night, or whether the singing was in the 
open or in the “ quarters. ” Darkness has untold terrors for the negro.
-P-A-G-E-167
  Folk-Lore from Maryland 163 
In singing there was always a leader, who would sing a line or two alone, 
which was often impromptu, and sometimes introduce personal remarks 
about those present or about the people in the “ big house. ” The refrain 
would be a familiar one as, 
“ Way down in de Corn fiel’. ” 
The refrains were the key note for the rest of the singers and were 
often sung first to give the rythm and the swing. Sometimes these songs 
were remembered and after being sung several times, would become 
popular in the section of the state, where first sung. The following is an 
example : 
2649. Hooray, hooray, ho! 
Roun’ de corn Sally ! 
Hooray fer all de lubby ladies ; 
Roun’ the corn Sally ! 
Dere’s Marster Howard lub Miss Betty, 
Roun’ de corn Sally ! 
I tell you what, she’s mighty putty ; 
Roun’ de corn Sally ! 
And den dey means to lib so lordly ; 
Roun’ de corn Sally ! 
Up at de manor-house at Audley; 
Roun’ de corn Sally ! 
Dere is Marster Bunt, he lub Miss Susan. 
Roun’ de corn Sally ! 
He ’clar’ she is de pick and choosin’. 
Roun’ de corn Sally ! 
An’ when dey gains de married station, 
Roun’ de corn Sally! 
He‘ take her to de old plantation, 
Roun’ de corn Sally ! 
2650. “ Patting the Jub ” or “ Juba ” as it was sometimes called 
was an accomplishment within the reach of those whose ear for music 
was especially fine. To succeed in it, one must be able to clap the hands 
and slap his knees in regular rythm while another shuffled. There were 
certain songs sung to this Juba dance of which the following is a speci- 
men: 
Corn Pone Song: 
2651. Sif? de meal an’ gi’ me de husk, 
Bake de bread an’ gi’ me de crus’ ;

2654. Juba in and juba out, 
Juba, juba all about ; 
Dinah stir de possum fat, 
Can’t you hear de juba pat ; 
2655. A correspondent sent to the Baltimore Sun, several years ago, 
an old Maryland corn husking song, with a short account of the corn 
husking itself, which we give below. 
The Jack Snipe said unto the Crane, 
Whisky Johnny, 
I wish de Lord there would come rain. 
Oh, Hilo! 
The Wild Goose said unto the Swan, 
Whisky Johnny, 
The coming winter will be sharp and long, 
Oh, Hilo ! 
They say old master’s sick again, 
Whisky Johnny, 
He suffers many an ache and pain, 
Oh, Hilo! 
When my old master’s dead and gone, 
Whisky Johnny, 
This old nigger will stop husking corn, 
Oh, Hilo! 
Oh, my old master’s good to me, 
Whisky Johnny, 
And when he dies he’Il set me free, 
Oh, Hilo!  
-P-A-G-E-169

We’ve possum fat and taters, too, 
Whisky Johnny, 
Good enough fir me and you, 
Oh, Hilo! 
If you have cider good and strong, 
Whisky Johnny, 
I'll be to see you before very long, 
Oh, Hilo! 
The watermillons now in their height, 
Whisky Johnny, 
I stol’d two out de patch last night, 
Oh, Hilo! 
The nigger who finds the most red corn, 
Whisky Johnny, 
Will be de next leader ’sho as he’s born, 
Oh, Hilo! 
The corn is husked, the supper is o’er, 
Whisky Johnny, 
And now we’ll pull for the other shore 
Oh, Hilo! 
And all you niggers start tonight, 
Whisky Johnny, 
So you’ll get home before daylight, 
Oh, Hilo! 
And now my friends I’ll bid you all adieu, 
Whisky Johnny, 
I’ve done the best I could for you, 
Oh, Hilo! 
And remember that we niggers all, 
Whisky Johnny, 
Will be on hand next fall, 
Oh, Hilo! 
And now, my friend, again good night, 
Whisky Johnny, 
We husked that corn good and all right, 
Oh, Hilo! 
We stripped the husk off like a shirt, 
Whisky Johnny, 
And left no silk that would ever hurt, 
Oh, Hilo! 
2656. The leader or “ singer ” has not lost his power ; a power that 
has gained frequent recognition. A case in point is that of a gang of colored 
men who were at work grading for a railroad in Maryland. One of the 
men sang harder than he worked and was discharged by the superin-  
-P-A-G-E-170
  166 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
tendent. The gang of men seemed dispirited and worked in a half-heart- 
ed way and at last told the boss they wanted the “ singer” back. Inquiry 
made known the fact this so-called “ singer ” led them as they sang at 
their work. The singer was taken back and the men worked with renewed 
energy and good cheer. But the leader did not always work less than 
his followers. On the contrary, he was at times the hardest worker of 
them all. This was especially the case when the body motion was in 
rhythm with the song. (The Sun, 11-12-1903.) 
Probably the finest examplification of this in Maryland is to be found 
in the planting of tobacco which for some years after the Civil War was 
one of the staple crops of the state. From the time the seed was sown 
until the crop was marketed in great hogsheads ready for foreign ship- 
ment, it could be handled only in wet or rainy weather. In “ planting ”, 
which meant a transfer of plants from the seed bed to the field, it was 
often necessary after a long dry spell to keep the men at work till mid- 
night, or even till morning, to get the crop in. The leader here was more 
thana “ singer ”. He led in the work and was a leader almost by natural 
selection, It was his ambition to get as much work out of the men as 
possible, they always following his lead, and the music and the body 
motion were his aids. When the time for the planting came, the plants 
were taken from the seed beds in baskets and on every hill in the great 
field a plant was dropped, the first hill in every row having two plants. 
When a portion of the field was thus supplied, the real planting began. 
The leader ranged his men, each in front of one of the long rows of “ hills,” 
and at a signal from him and the starting of the song, everbody was 
bowed, a hole was made in the hill with the finger, a plant was put in 
the hole, the roots covered up, the second plant on the hill picked up, 
the body raised, a step taken over the hill just planted and the process 
repeated, everything being done in unison with the leader and the song 
until the far end of the great field was reached and a fresh start was 
made. 
2657. Song-singing for a negro of Southern Maryland is today an 
unthinkable sin. For him the old plantation songs have passed and gone. 
He has taken kindly to the Moody and Sankey hymns, as have his 
brethren throughout the States, though he retains a few of the older and 
more gruesome negro hymns. The re iterated refrain of one of these runs 
as follows : 
Oh, won’t that be dreadful 
To make you’ bed in hell! 
Two other snatches of song that come from the same part of the state, 
are as follows : 
2658. De Zicco made a wheel an’ laid it on de groun’ ; 
De wheel turned over an’ de worl’ tu’n roun’.  
-P-A-G-E-171
2659. 
  Folk-Lore from Maryland 167 
De stars in de ailimint’s a-shinin’, 
De moon all dipt in blood. 
On a clear night the negro will say, “ Not a cloud on de ailiment. ” 
The following is a group of negro songs we have taken down as they 
are sung today. 
2660. Sinner man. 
A sinner man sat on the gates of hell, 
A sinner man sat on the gates of hell, 
A sinner man sat on the gates of hell, 
The gates fell in and down he fell, 
No hiding place down there. 
I thought I heard my sister yell, 
I thought I heard my sister yell, 
I thought I heard my sister yell, 
*Way down deep in the middle of hell, 
No hiding place down there. 
I went to the rock to hide my face, 
I went to the rock to hide my face, 
I went to the rock to hide my face, 
The rock called out, “Go wash your face, ” 
No hidding place down there. 
Variant :

XXI. TALES. 
I. FOLK TALES. 
THE MARRIAGE OF MR. BULLOCK AND MISS HEIFER. 
2691. Mr. Bullock and Miss Heifer were to be married, and they 
intended to celebrate their wedding by giving a feast to their friends, 
and to include in the festivities a sail down the river. Accordingly 
they sent out their invitations to all their friends ; the sheep and the 
horses and the rabbits and many others, but they did not invite 
Mr. Dog, because he was known to be cruel and cross and had on some 
occasions actually killed some of Brother Rabbit’s family. 
This wedding made quite a stir and talk among the animals, and the 
more Mr. Dog heard it talked of, the more he wanted to be present. At 
last he thought of a plan, by which he might be able to attend, and he 
determined, if possible, to break up the wedding feast without letting 
himself be known. Accordingly he disguised himself in a white sheet 
and put upon his head a pair of heifer’s horns and hid himself near the 
place where the boat was upon which the bridal party were to sail down 
the river. 
After the boat had started, he came to the shore and called out, “ Ship 
ahoy, ship ahoy.”” This made quite a commotion among the guests, and 
several young Bullocks insisted upon turning back for the pretty Miss 
Heifer, as they supposed. 
“There’s a young lady left behind,” they said. So the boat came 
back and took Mr. Dog on board. He sat still and acted so like a bashful 
young lady, that every one was charmed with him. Everything went 
on well till supper time, when they put him between Mr. Possum an 
Mr. Coon. Try hard as he could, he could scarcely keep from betraying 
himself, and after awhile Mr. Possum and Mr. Coon began to get very 
uneasy. 
“ What’s the matter ?” said Mr. Fox, who was on his good behavior. 
“Oh, nothing, ” they said. 
But after a while Mr. Possum leaned over Mr. Dog, and said in a low 
voice. “ Mr. Dog is on board, Mr. Dog is on board, ” but Mr. Dog sat 
very still and said nothing. Soon Mr. Possum leaned over Mr. Dog and 
said to Mr. Coon again, 
“Mr. Dog is on board, Mr. Dog is on board, ” and this made Mr. Dog 
very angry but still he sat quiet. 
Soon Mr. Coon, leaning over, in a low voice said to Mr. Possum, 
“ Mr. Dog is sure on board, Mr. Dog is sure on board, ” and leaned upon, 
as he supposed, Miss Heifer’s side. 
This was too much for Mr. Dog. Snarling he sprang at them both, 
pulling off the sheet and soon had Mr. Coon and Mr. Possum tearing
-P-A-G-E-181
  
Folk-Love from Maryland 177 
round the boat with him after them. At this, the Heifers and Bullocks 
and other animals became frightened, and some jumped over into the 
river and so Mr. Dog broke up the wedding feast, but not without 
showing himself in his true colors. 
WOLF AND THE LAMB. 
2692. A Wolf and a Lamb went down to the spring to drink. The 
Wolf said to the Lamb, “ Why do you come and drink out of the spring 
with me ! I heard you spoke ill of me last year. ” 
“Tt could not have been me, ” cried the Lamb, “I was only born 
last spring. ” 
“Tf it was not you, it was one of your race, ” said the Wolf, “ and I 
shall pay you for it.” 
So he jumped on the Lamb and tore it limb from limb. 
Moral : 
Often in family quarrels or feuds the innocent suffer for the guilty. 
MR. ALLIGATOR AND MR. FOX. 
2693. Mr. Alligator was big and black and used to lie all day in the 
sun, blinking his big black eyes and taking into his great mouth any- 
thing that came his way. Sometimes Mr. Fox’s little children used to 
come too near Mr. Alligator, and then he’d open his big mouth and eat 
them up. Then poor Mr. Fox would come round looking very sad, and 
find Mr. Alligator lying out in the broom sage in the marsh. And when he 
thought about his children he would sigh very hard and Mr. Alligator 
would say, 
“Why, what’s the matter, Mr. Fox ?” And Mr. Fox would answer, 
“Oh, I am in trouble, Mr. Alligator.” Then Mr. Alligator would laugh 
and say, 
“Why, what is trouble, Mr. Fox ? I don’t know what trouble is. ” 
One day Mr. Fox came running by and Mr. Alligator was lying out 
ready to catch him, so he looked very sad and Mr. Alligator asked him 
what was the matter, and said he didn’t know what trouble was. 
“ Wait till I come back and I’Il tell you ! ” Mr. Fox cried out. 
So Mr. Fox set fire to the broom sage all around Mr. Alligator, and 
Mr. Alligator when he saw the fire, tried to get out of the marsh, but he 
found out that he could not and he cried out, 
“Oh, Mr. Fox, come help me out, I am in so much trouble ; I never 
knowed what trouble was, till the ma’sh caught fire. ” 
But Mr. Fox sat off one side and laughed. So Mr. Alligator found out 
what trouble was, but he was burned up in doing so. 
Moral : 
Some people laugh at the misfortunes of others. It is not until they 
have trouble of their own that they realize what it is.

THE GUNNY WOLF. 
2694. A man and his little daughter lived alone in a forest and there 
were wolves in the forest. So the man built a fence round the house and 
told his little daughter she must on no account go outside the gate while 
he was away. One morning when he had gone away the little girl was 
hunting for flowers and thought it would do no harm just to peep through 
the gate. She did so and saw a little flower so near that she stepped 
outside to pick it. Then she saw another a little farther off and went for 
that. Then she saw another and went for that and so she kept getting 
farther and farther away from home. As she picked the flowers she 
sang a little song. Suddenly she heard a noise and looked up and saw 
a great gunny wolf and he said, 
“ Sing that sweeten, gooden song again. ” 
(This is said in a low, gruff voice.) 
She sang, “ Tray bla-tray bla-cum qua, kimo. ” 
Pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat. 
(This is said softly to represent the child’s steps.) 
She goes back. Presently she hears, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, 
(coarse deep voice) 
coming behind her and there was the wolf, an’ ’e says : 
“ You move, ? ” (Gruff voice.) 
“O no my dear, what ’casion I move? ”(In childish voice.) 
“Sing that sweeten gooden song again. ” 
She sang, “ Tray-bla, tray-bla, cum qua, kimo. ” 
Wolf he gone. 
Pit-a-pat, pit a-pat, pit-a-pat. 
She goes back some more. Presently she hears, 
Pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, 
coming behind her, and there was the wolf, an’ ’e says, 
“You move. ” 
“O no, my dear what ’casion I move ? ” 
“ Sing that sweeten, gooden song again. ” 
She sang, “ Tray-bla, tray-bla, tray-bla, cum qua, kimo. ” 
Wolf, he gone. 
Pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat coming behind her and thare was the 
wolf, an’ ’e say, 
“You move. ” 
“Ono my dear, what ’casion I move ? ” 
“Sing that sweeten gooden song again. ” 
She sang, “ Tray bla-tray bla-cum qua, ki mo. ”

Wolf he gone. 
Pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat. 
She goes back some more and this time when she hears pit-a-pat,pit-a- 
pat, pit-a-pat coming behind her, she slips inside the gate and shuts 
it and wolf, he can’t get her. 
THE SINGING GEESE. 
2695. A man went out one day to shoot something for dinner, and as 
he was going along, he heard a sound in the air above him and looking 
up saw a great flock of geese, and they were all singing. 
“ La-lee-lu, come quilla, come quilla, bung, bung, bung, quilla bung, ” 
He up with his gun and shot one of the geese and it sang as it fell, 
“ La-lee-lu, come quilla, come quilla, bung, bung, bung, quilla bung. ” 
He took it home and told his wife to cook it for dinner and each 
feather, as she picked it, flew out of the window. She put the goose in the 
stove, but all the time it was cooking, she could hear in muffled tones 
from the stove, 
“ La-lee-lu, come quilla, come quilla, bung, bung, bung, quilla bung. ” 
When the goose was cooked, she set it on the table, but as her hus- 
band picked up his knife and fork to carve it, it sang, 
“ La-lee-lu, come quilla, come quilla, bung, bung, bung, quilla bung. ” 
When he was about to stick the fork in the goose, there came a tre- 
mendous noise, and a whole flock of geese flew through the window 
singing, 
“ La-lee-lu, come quilla, come quilla, bung, bung, bung, quilla bung. ” 
And each one stuck a feather in the goose. Then they picked it up off 
the the dish and all flew out of the window singing, 
“ La-lee-lu, come quilla, come quilla, bung, bung, bung, quilla bung. ” 
DOMINI PROTECTOR. 
2696. A master told his servant he must call him Domini Protector, 
and instead of “ bed” he must say, “ esidegree ;” instead of “ slippers ” 
he must say “ toe clippers ;” instead of “ poker” he must say “ hoppo- 
polorum ; ” instead of “cat” he must say “ white faced Simian ;” 
instead of “ water” he must say “ explusion ;” and every morning he 
was to come to his room and rouse him by saying : 
“© Domini Protector, rise off thy esidegree, put on thy toe clippers 
and follow me, for hoppopolorum fell on white faced Simian and without 
explusion, we shall all be destroyed. 
A STORY. 
2697. Soshe went into the garden tocuta cabbage leaf to make an apple

pie. At the same time a great she-bear popped her head into the window 
“What, no soap ?” so she died. And she very imprudently married the 
barber and to the wedding came the Job lillies, the Bob lilies, the Gar- 
ryoolies, and the great Panjamdrum himself with a little round button 
at top, and they all fell to playing at catch as catch can until the gun- 
powder ran out of the heels of their boots. 
STORY OF THE MAN IN THE MOON. 
2698. A man was gathering sticks on Sunday. He was forbidden to 
do it ; he kept on saying — “ sticks, sticks, everywhere. ” He was 
told a second time to stop as it was Sunday. He kept on, saying as he 
gathered — “ sticks, sticks, everywhere. ” So as a punishment he 
was put in the moon, where he may still be seen gathering sticks. 
2699. The negroes believe that guineas stay awake all night and make 
“a constant noise, because at some ancient time a fox which had always 
been on friendly terms with the guineas suddenly took it into his head 
to taste one of them, “ and tasting, he ate it all up. ” 
THE ORIGIN OF THE Black MAN. 
2700. Once ’pon time, ol’ Nick got lonesome down in his dominyon

an’ to keep from jes’ nater’ly ’xplodin, he got hole in de top o’ de haid —

No cullud pesson ever see de debbil when de stream an’ fire warn’t rushin’ 
out, ’n so’t wan’t no use fur him to wear a hat. ” 
2702. The devil has teeth like harrow teeth, nails like nail rods, ears 
like cabbage leaves, and breathes smoke like a tar kiln. (Anne Arundel

ve It is said that holly-berries were white until Christ was cruci- 
fied. He was crowned with holly and his blood turned the berries red.

2704. The berries of the Maryland Judas tree (Cercis Canadensis) 
were made red when stained by the blood of Judas who hanged himself 
on this tree. Hence the name, they say in Maryland. 
2705. The spot in the middle of the smartweed was caused by a drop 
of blood from the Savior’s brow as he bore the cross to Calvary. 
2706. An Irish seamstress in Baltimore said she had often seen the 
fairy ring and heard the fairies talking, but could not understand what 
they said, she was so frightened. (A. W. W.) 
2707. There was an old woman who ased to tell the children that if 
they took a bag and sat on the banks of Tom’s Creek, the Elkeritches 
would come in. The story goes, that the children took the bags and sat 
on the banks of Tom’s Creek, but the Elkeritches never came. (Emmitts- 
burg.) 
2708. A witch told a man if he wanted to steal corn out of a corn 
house, he need only say, “ Seesang open the door, ” and the door would 
open and lock behind him ; but when he was ready to come out he must 
say the same thing for the door to open again. The man followed her 
directions until his barrels were filled with corn ; but when he was ready 
to leave, he forgot what he was to say and could only repeat over and 
over again all night long, “ Seesang barrel de corn.” In the morning his 
master found him there by the corn he had intended to steal. 
JACK-O-MY-LANTERN : A MARYLAND VERSION. 
2709. One day wuz a man name Jack. He wuz a mighty weeked 
man, an’ treat he wife an’ chil’en like a dawg. He did’n do nuthin’ but

Den de Debble say :

Den he say, “ Mr. Debble, I’ll letcher out ef yo’ ’clar fo’ gracious yo’

“ Yo’ kin git some ef yo’ wan’ ’em, ” said de Debble and he stop and

“ How yo’ ’spec’ a man wid ’lirium trimblins to climb a tree ? ” said

2710. Among the mountain people, the will-o’-the wisp is thought 
to be an unearthly visitor, called by the Pennsylvania Dutch a drach 
(dragon). 
A Baptist church near Taneytown, when abandoned, was reported 
to be the scene of strange lights inside and strange sights outside. A 
figure from the graveyard would chase the passers-by. Back of the church 
are woods where children are told the witches hide. A man living near 
says that when he was a boy, he saw in the woods a large circle that 
looked as though it had been made by cart wheels turning round and 
round. His father told him that it was a meeting place for witches. 
2. GHOST STORIES AND FAMILY LEGENDS. 
2711. A sea captain left his wife in England, and lived with another 
woman in this country. Wishing to live in seclusion, he went to a small 
town in Maryland. His first wife followed him to Baltimore, and when 
he heard of it, he committed suicide, and the place in which he lived has 
ever since been considered unlucky. There are now three houses on this 
spot, and within forty years there have been three bankruptcies there. 
There have also been three notably severe deaths, accidents, unhappy 
marriages, and fire which destroyed everything. A man built a house on 
the premises but can neither sell nor rent it now, and everyone who 
has ever opened business in it has been forced to give it up. 
2712. Numerous reports of the existence of headless men are sent 
from different parts of the state. In the city they inhabit alleys, and in 
the country, groves and ridges. 
2713. On the Eastern Shore a headless horseman is said to frequent 
the lanes leading to those houses where the former tenant has come to 
an untimely end. The horseman can be seen at certain hours of the night. 
In Northumberland are legends of the death hearse, drawn by head-

less horses, and driven by a headless driver, in the direction of the church- 
yard. When this appears, “ the death of some considerable person in 
the parish is sure to happen at no distant period. ” 
(Henderson, F. L. N. C. 326. Emmitisburg Reports of Headless Men.) 
2714. Tales of headless men were numerous in the first half of the 
past century. They were even said to walk in the town. Almost every 
alley was supposed to have been haunted by a headless man or other 
spirits. One for many years lived in a grove about a mile east of the 
town. He would come out and walk in the road. A house close-by con- 
tained people who used to watch him as he wandered about. In 1884 
or thereabouts, a young girl driving with some people along that road 
declares she saw him. 
2715. Another one lived by a ridge several miles farther on. Once a 
man passed there, and, hearing foot-steps, turned and saw the headless 
man. 
2716. When Granny O. was a young woman somewhere about 1810, 
she was visiting at a house where a headless man used to prowl around. 
She was a firm “ disbeliever ” in ghosts and often went around the house 
at night by herself. But one night she came face to face with this dreadful 
object. “ And that settled me on the ghost question, ” said the old lady 
when I asked her if she believed in ghosts. 
2717. An Emmittsburg man about 1887 was riding with a native 
of Warfieldsburg, after dusk near the Ore Mine Bridge, somewhere about 
Warfieldsburg. A large black dog came through, not over, a fence, cross- 
ed the road, and went through the fence on the other side. “ Wasn’t that 
a large dog!” exclaimed the Emmittsburg man and the other answered, 
“Did you see it ? It was the Phantom Dog.” The Emmittsburg man 
had never before heard of it. 
The Phantom Dog has been known in this region for a hundred years 
or more. It is supposed to be the spirit of a man who owned the land 
around, and who was thought to have been cruel. 
2718. A gentleman of Emmittsburg asked a citizen of Warfieldsburg 
to give him some facts concerning the Phantom Dog. He was told that 
it had been seen for at least fifty years ; that it was supposed by the 
superstitious to be the spirit of Lee Masters, a cruel landowner ; that it 
never was seen more than once by the same person ; that it was imma- 
terial, for a man once struck at it with his whip which went through the 
dog ; that it had intelligence, for another man spoke to it saying, “Come 
here and walk beside me, ” and it came ; that the man who told these 
facts saw it once. The Dog is black and about three feet high, it is generally 
seen with a huge chain clanking with it. Its foot-prints have been seen in 
the snow. If you cut after it with a whip near the spot where it is seen, 
it disappears. 
2719. A man driving a wagon and two horses once came to this place 
when a large black dog, dragging a chain walked with him quite a dis- 
tance—about a hundred yards probably.

2720. The following story refers to the Phantom Dog. 
A man told another man that on a certain night he should go to a 
certain bridge and stand one hour under a tree and a dog would go by. 
He did as he was told and the dog passed and followed him a “ little 
piece. ” 
2721. Ina graveyard near Emmittsburg, there is a grape-vine under 
which money is supposed to be buried. A large white horse is seen going 
down to it frequently. People are afraid to try the charm of walking 
backward and leaving an overcoat on the spot. 
THE GHOST OF THE WHITE MULE OF THE MARSHES. 
2722. “ Many years ago on a farm near Tobacco Stick, Dorchester 
county, a white mule was born ; its coat was spotless, not a dark hair 
appearing upon his body. From its very earliest days this mule manifested 
unmistakable signs of deviltry. This disposition was fatal to his use- 
fulness ; every effort to tame him proved fruitless. His master, thinking 
that time would effect a cure, allowed the young animal full freedom. 
No one could put a halter on him. His heels would fly out like a 
flash ; it was impossible to get within fifty feet of him, it seemed that 
his legs could stretch that far. Theman who had approached him near- 
est with a halter was Tim, a negro. He approached stealthily from behind, 
and the animal didnot seem to notice him. He was within fifty feet 
of the mule when out flew his heels. The negro soon after- 
wards lost consciousness ; but after recovering, he is said to have remark- 
ed to the mule’s owner : “ Yas, boss I’s ’bout fifty feet ’ob dat mule 
when he’gan kickin’ ; I couldn’t git out de way his limbs kept stretching 
an’ stretching until he clipped me one on de haid. Dat mule am de debil, 
an’ I fools no longer wid him. ” 
Thereafter the blacks said that the mule was the devil himself. They 
said his eyes were green and glassy, and that he had the evil eye. Some 
wanted the owner to let the mule have his liberty ; but he was deter- 
mined to keep him, and, if possible, to break him in to service. 
One morning the mule was found to be missing. There was no hole 
in the fence through which he could have escaped. The fence was five 
feet high and the only means of escape was by leaping over it. He seemed 
to have been swallowed up by the earth. All these circumstances tended 
to intensify the fears of the blacks. About three weeks after his disap- 
pearance, some wicked citizen, who shocked the good people of the 
neighborhood by staying up to 12 o’clock at night, saw what he swore 
to be the white mule galloping wildly down the road near the woods, two 
miles from his master’s pasture. After this a number of reports were 
made confirming the experience of the first observer.
-P-A-G-E-190
186 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
It was generally at night he was seen ; but once he was seen in the 
daytime in the marsh near the head of Church Creek. The citizen who 
saw him had an excellent reputation for veracity and he said the animal 
ran as lightly and easily over the soft, spongy soil as on the firmest road 
ever built. Soon when he heard these reports his master decided to 
make efforts to recapture him. 
In spite of all well-laid plans, these efforts proved fruitless. The mule 
always managed to elude his would-be-captors when they thought they 
had him cornered. They would start out in pairs, get on the trail of the 
fugitive, drive him into a wood, have him surrounded either by marshes 
or heavy brush ; the only way open for his escape was through the ranks 
of his pursuers ; but none of these disadvantages seemed to break his 
spirit or discourage him. On the contrary, on these occasions, he seemed 
inspired with renewed courage ; he seemed to court danger. Suddenly 
without warning, with a rush as of a cyclone, his pursuers would see 
a white mass moving madly towards them, hesitating not a moment, 
swerving not an inch and instinctively, to save themselves they step 
aside, and the mule would rush to freedom through the breach thus made. 
At other times he would simply pass through the almost impenetrable 
brushwood like a thing spiritual, or he would go right into the marsh 
and in a few minutes would soon be lost to view. The slimy waters and 
bogs soon closed up all traces of his hoofmarks. 
In spite of these failures, the owner did not despair of regaining his 
treasure ; the increased difficulties served only to increase the value 
he set upon him, and his determination to recover the animal. One day 
he was able to gather a number of farmers and neighbors together with 
the express purpose of continuing upon the trail of the mule until he was 
run down. They armed themselves with whips, halters, ropes and clubs, 
and, incidentally reinforced themselves with refreshments, — both 
liquid and solid — so that they could camp upon the trail of the fugitive. 
This was the most systematic.raid that had been organized. 
The farmers, taking warning from previous failures, did not hurry 
headlong after him and needlessly alarm the animal ; but went leisurely 
along, strengthening their position as they went. The mule gradually 
and unconsciously allowed himself to be driven towards the swamp 
at the head of the creek. It was not until he was well within the confines 
of the marsh that he noticed his pursuers at all. When he did, he looked 
apparently with disdain upon their laborious efforts and simply quicken- 
ed his movements. 
Gradually, like the coils of a great serpent, the farmers gathered closer 
around him ; but still he manifested no alarm or fear. This time they 
forced him towards the quicksands, which they had been unable to do 
hitherto because of the lack of numbers. At this turn of affairs, the mule 
became visibly alarmed ; he pricked up his ears and looked eagerly 
around him ; then he plunged madly towards the steadily approaching
-P-A-G-E-191
Ce ee ee 
Folk-Lore from Maryland 187 
circle of men. Contrary to his expectations and prior experiences, the 
circle did not waver, but stood steady —with ropes and halters to put 
over his head and limbs. Then he brayed, wheeled quickly, and sent 
his hind heels flying into the air ; but no one was near enough to be 
injured. 
The mule was thoroughly alarmed now and rushed madly forward ; 
but the circle gradually grew closer around him. Steadly and surely he 
was driven to the edge of the quicksands. When the beast saw this, he 
seemed to realize his position, and it is said that a decided tremor was 
seen to pass over his body ; but he kept doggedly on until he was on the 
very edge of the fatal sands, and there he stood defiantly challenging 
his pursuers to come closer. This they did, and he met them with flying 
heels ; but they never hesitated. The men with the whips stepped forward 
and commenced to lash him. They continued this until the mule ceased 
kicking, apparently from exhaustion, not from broken spirits. An instant 
after this, a change seemed to come over his entire nature, his fierceness 
gave place to docility ; a constant trembling shook his limbs ; the men 
thought he was conquered. But it was not so. A farmer with a halter 
approached him to place it on his head. As the man left the crowd, 
almost instantly another change came over the beast. His tremb- 
ling ceased and his old-time fierceness came back ; he was the white 
mule of the marshes once more. The man approached from the side and 
was about to toss the halter over his head, when the mule, with a bray 
almost human in intensity and reproach, rushed madly into the quick- 
sands to sink almost immediately to his death. Before the pursuers could 
get up to him, he had sunk to his back; as he felt the sand gradually draw- 
ing him under, he began to struggle for life ; but it seemed only to hasten 
his doom. His pursuers went gallantly to his rescue ; but they were too 
late; his back was submerged. He stopped struggling and became 
resigned to his fate ; he looked sorrowfully at his would-be captors and 
seemed to reproach them for thus cutting short his life. In a few moments 
all was over ; he disappeared from view and the sands came together 
once more and were as smooth as ever. 
Since then the ghost of this mule has haunted the roads, fields, and 
byways of this section. Time and time again have stories been told of 
his appearances ; and generally he was the fore-runner of evil. If he 
stumbled and fell when seen, the observer was doomed to some misfor- 
tune, or even death, within three days. If he did not stumble, there was 
no danger. 
A man named Clase is said to have had a personal encounter with this 
ghost. He was a huge man, inclined to idleness. The only distinguishing 
characteristic he possessed was an enormous thirst : He could drink as 
much as two men together. Every Saturday night, it was his weakness 
to become intoxicated ; and when he was in that condition, there was 
no doubt as to his identity. Up to the time of his adventure with the   
 
-P-A-G-E-192
    188 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
white mule, he had been a scoffer of its influence ; he even denied its 
existence. 
One Saturday night, he started for home, singing, as he went, various 
drinking songs. He had drunk long and deeply ; his basket in which he 
was to place provisions for his family’s sustenance was empty and hung 
upon his limp arm. He had reached the fork of the road that went past 
his house, when something caused him to look backwards. Just as he 
did so, he beheld a white object coming rapidly towards him. As he 
watched it, the object stumbled and fell. 
At this, he gave one yell and fled homewards, and never stopped until 
he had reached his house and placed the doors between himself and the 
dread object. The next day he went to church and remained sober all 
day. The following day he manifested some signs of industry which he 
had not done for many years. He apparently had reformed, and the 
reason was that he had seen the “ white mule of the marshes, ” and it 
had stumbled and fallen. He seemed to realize that he was doomed to 
some dire misfortune within three days, even death. 
At last, on Tuesday, the second day after his vision, he could withhold 
his secret no longer, and he made a confident of his wife. He told her 
that he was sincerely sorry for whatever griefs he had caused her ; asked 
her forgiveness and her prayers. He went to prayer-meeting and was 
converted that night. The next day, the day of his doom arrived, and he 
was resigned to his fate. The day passed and nothing unusual happened 
to him. At this he thought he was spared for some great end : that he 
had a work and duty to perform. As he further pondered upon it, the 
resolution came to him to preach the Gospel and save sinners from the 
burning, just as he realized that he had been rescued. 
He became a preacher ; was successful in converting sinners ; and 
always, when other arguments failed, held himself up as an example 
of the wonders that could be accomplished by faith and determination. 
His story, apparently was the exception that proved the rule as to the 
truth of the supernatural powers of the white mule of the marshes. ” 
(H. H. Bowen.) 
2723. A boy was thrown out of a wagon near Mount Carmel Church 
and killed, and the ghost of the empty wagon was heard long afterward. 
2724. One night a man saw something like a long-handled hoe moving 
about. 
THE WHITE LADY. 
2725. Toward midnight the long disused water wheel of a mill, 
belonging to a country place in Washington Country. Md. begins to 
turn, slowly at first, and gradually it moves faster until it is going at a 
terrific rate. Then a White Lady appears, standing on a little platform 
above the wheel. Suddenly she utters a wail and casts herself upon the 
wheel. Then the wheel stops whirling and everything is quiet again.

THE FIGURE IN THE SPRING HOUSE. 
2726. On the grounds of the same estate stands a spring house. It is no 
longer used and has but few visitors. A terrible tragedy is re-enacted 
there at night by ghostly actors long since dead. There had been a strain 
of insanity in the family and it appeared in one of the daughters. During 
the day she would be very quiet and stay by herself, but at night, accom- 
panied by a huge hound, she would walk around singing little snatches 
of song. One of her favorite spots was the spring house, and she would 
wander there each night. A weary tramp, seeking refuge there one night, 
was found by the lady, and killed by her in a fit of insane rage. 
She afterward hung herself from the limb of a tree near the house, 
and the present owner had to cut off that limb in order to keep any 
servants. (Hagerstown.) 
THE HAUNTED STAIRCASE. 
2727. If you were to pass by acertain old house in Washington Co., 
Md., exactly at midnight, you would hear a terrible scream ; and if you 
could look into the house at the spot whence the cry came you would see 
avery narrow, crooked staircase at the bottom of which, according to 
some, lies the body of a man. But when the voice dies away the vision 
vanishes. The cause of this outcry is as follows: Many years ago the 
house was occupied by an old man and his daughter. One night a young 
man came to the house to transact a matter of business with the old 
man. The young man was unknown to the father, but he was the lover 
of the daughter. As there was a bad storm approaching, the visitor 
was compelled to spend the night. As the evening wore on, however, 
the older man became very angry as the result of a serious quarrel with 
his guest. When it was time to retire, the father, candle in hand, mount- 
ed the stairs ahead of the young man. Almost at the top the guest fell, 
whether form a misstep ora push from above, no one could say, and 
dropped the entire length of the steps. The girl, standing below, rushed 
forward in time to see her lover stretched on the floor with a broken 
neck, It is her shriek and his fall that are heard each night by the passer- 
by. (Hagerstown.) 
2728. Some years ago a young girl promised the man she was in love 
with that if he died she would make a daily visit to his grave whether 
she herself were alive or dead. Her lover died and she did not long sur- 
vive him. But she has faithfully kept her promise. Every day during 
her lifetime she went to his grave and since her death she is still to be 
seen following the path that leads to the grave. The path remains as 
it always was, though it is never used by others. 
2729. A young Indian is said to haunt a spot near Thurmont, and 
to give out war whoops as he walks.

2730. A man walked over an Indian battle field one night, and after 
groping around as if blindfolded, lost his way. He could hear the Indian 
spirits all around him whooping. After a while he came to himself, and 
found he was near home. He thought it was a spell the Indian spirits 
had put on him. 
2731. A friend, whose cook came from the “ Wilderness,” was one 
day surprised by having her refuse to enter the butler’s pantry. She 
asked her why she objected to going in. The woman said, “ Deed, Miss 
Helen, I ain’t gwine in dere no more, kase dem ejyclips is in dere ; three 
times I’se lit dat light, an’ jes’ as soon as I turn my back, dey is out 
again. ” 
THE LEGEND OF DARK HOLLOW. 
& 2732. Near the village of Glyndon, Md., a road, dark from the shade of 
tall trees and steep banks on each side, leads into the beautiful Worthing- 
ton Valley. In the dimmest part of this road, perched high in the bank over- 
looking the highway, a huge rock stands out against the dark background. 
On stormy nights, when the wind howls through the woods, a headless 
man appears there on the stroke of midnight. Such tales are current 
about this strange ghost that children are afraid to pass the rock even in 
the daytime. 
“ WIZARD’S CLIP.” 
2733. There is a small town in West Virginia not far from Maryland, 
variously known as Smithfield, Middleway, and Clip or Wizard’s Clip. 
The origin of the last name dates back to the latter part of the 18th 
century, when, according to tradition, the home of Adam Livingston 
was the scene of weird, unusual happenings such as the clipping of gar- 
ments, sheets, counterpanes, blankets, and even boots, by means of 
invisible shears, the sound of whose clipping and snipping could be 
heard from morning to night and from night to morning. 
Not only did Livingston’s own family suffer from these mysterious 
visitations, but the stranger who ventured within his gates was liable 
to have the clothes on his back so riddled with these strange clippings 
that he would be forced to borrow others to wear home, while the very 
saddle-cloth on the back of his horse hitched outside would suffer the 
fate of his clothes. The clippings were always in the shape of half moons. 
Many weird stories are told of the experiences of individuals who ventur- 
ed to the house either from curiosity or with the idea of defying the 
wizard, until a Roman Catholic priest came with belt, book and candle 
and succeeded in exorcising the evil spirits. 
The cause and the history of these weird happenings are found in 
a portion of the life and actions of Adam Livingston. In 1794 a strang- 
er took lodging with him ; and, being ill soon after, asked that a Roman 
Catholic priest be sent for. Livingston, who is described as a bigoted
-P-A-G-E-195
  Folk-Lore from Maryland Igi 
Lutheran, not only refused to grant his request, but declared that no 
Catholic priest should ever cross his threshold. Further entreaties of the 
sick man proving futile, he died unshriven. But from the moment the 
breath left his body the home of Livingston became the scene of strange 
sounds and disturbances. 
The tramping of horses was heard at night around the house, the barn 
was burned, the cattle died, chickens and turkeys had their heads snipped 
off as if by great shears, money that Livingston had saved mysteriously 
disappeared, and then the clippings began. 
Efforts were made from time to time to exorcise the demons, but in 
vain. At length in a dream, Livingston saw a man in a long white robe 
and heard a voice assuring him that this man could bring him relief. 
Being told that the McS. family, at Leetown, were at times visited 
by a Roman Catholic priest, Livingston went there and found in Mrs. 
Anastasia McS. a sympathizer and adviser. Following her advice, and 
accompanied by Mrs. McS. and Mr. McS, Livingston attended service the 
following Sabbath in the Catholic church at Shepherdstown. A dramatic 
account is given by the Rev. Demetrius Gallitzen of the way in which 
Livingston, recognizing the officiating priest, wept aloud and cried out 
to the astonishment of the congregation. “ That is the man I saw in my 
dream. ” 
The service being over, Father Cahill, the priest, was appealed to for 
relief ; but he laughed at the whole thing and insisted that Livingston’s 
friends were playing jokes on him. Continued entreaties at last prevail- 
ed on the priest who went to the Livingston house. Father Cahill pro- 
ceeded to sprinkle it with holy water, and then the money that had been 
lost mysteriously appeared on the door sill, though the clipping con- 
tinued. The invisible shears ceased their work only after mass had been 
celebrated in the house. Many strange stories are told of future commu- 
nications between Adam Livingston and his ghostly visitors. But the 
interviews were always of a friendly nature, as a thank offering for deliver- 
ance from their unwelcome visit. Adam Livingston donated a tract of 
thirty acres to the Roman Catholic church, this tract being still known as 
Priest’s Field. A partial account of the strange happenings that gave 
Smithfield the name of “Wizard Clip” may be seeninahistory of Jef- 
ferson County, but it quotes largely from the account written by the 
Rev. Demetrius Gallitzan, a Russian prince, who came from his home 
in Pennsylvania to investigate the weird happenings and spent several 
months in Smithfield, dividing his time between the homes of Richard 
McSherry and Ada Livingston. There are persons still living who declare 
they have seen some of the garments clipped by the invisible shears. 
2734. The following tale is told of one of the old homes iu Maryland : 
One of the former owners, a rich old man, left his fortune in equal 
shares to his three sons, but the eldest changed the will so that he might 
have the lion’s share and the care of the property. All went well for a
-P-A-G-E-196
  192 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
year. Then one night he was on his way home with friends from a long 
and fatiguing bird hunt. They were all walking, and to save time and 
distance, they cut across a field which led them to the family burying 
ground and to the fence over which the old man had fallen in climbing 
and lost his life. On nearing the fence, they halted ; for barring their 
way was a shrouded, ghostly form. The son recognized the form as that 
of his father and trembled violently, as a cold, sepulchral voice said 
distinctly : 
“My son, do not wrong your brothers, but do right by them as you 
hope for mercy when you die. ” 
Then the ghostly form turned, placed a hand upon the top rail of the 
fence and leaped over. Where his fingers touched the fence a flash of 
fire and sulphurous smoke burst forth. The next day the imprint of 
a hand was found burned on the rail. The son hastened to the County 
Court House to right the wrong he had done his brothers. 
2735. In Calvert County on a high bluff commanding the Chesapeake, 
stands an imposing mansion, known, from the name of its owner, as 
“Bond Castle.” The house is in the shape of a cross, and has success- 
fully withstood the assaults of time. In this dwelling is a chimney about 
the size of a small room, in which according to tradition, treasures have 
been concealed since Revolutionary days. Many assert that there is a 
secret door, which, if its discovery were possible would open upon 
this hidden wealth. But no one has been willing to remain long enough in 
the stalking place of ghosts to secure the hidden treasures. 
2736. Phosphorescent lights were sometimes seen on the grave of 
an aged miser. This was the old man’s grasping soul come back to earth 
for a little space to mourn over the scattering of his hoards ; and the 
lonely hillside graveyard with its funereal cedar was always passed with 
fear and trembling. 
STORY OF A MYSTERIOUS SNAKE, TOLD BY WILLIAM JOHNSON. 
2737. The scene is laid in Pennsylvania, 16 miles west of Johns- 
town, in Somerset Co., Jenner township, at the Cross roads. 
He first knew of it when he was a schoolboy perhaps sixteen years 
old, and he saw it as long as he lived there. As he was thirty years of 
age when he moved away it must have been a cause of terror to the 
people of this little place for at least 15 years. 
When he first began to go to school, he had to go a long way round 
as the school-house was situated in the middle of a field, and much time 
was lost for all the pupils, as it was in such an out-of-the-way place. 
In consequence of this, the people had a meeting and decided to build 
another school-house at the cross roads, which place was easy of access 
and in every respect a more suitable site than the other. Mr. Johnson 
relates that although the proposed location seemed so desirable, an cld
-P-A-G-E-197
  
Folk-Lore from Maryland 193 
gray haired man who walked with a staff opposed the change, and told 
the trustees or whoever had the matter in hand that if they persisted 
in putting the new school-house at the Cross roads they would never 
have any good of it as the place was haunted. The new house was built 
at the place selected, and every month in the dark of the moon, an 
immense snake would appear.. While its head and tail seemed to be 
hidden under the school-house, its long scaly body, over a foot in diame- 
ter, was laid across all public highways leading to the place. He said 
they often had evenings at the school-house, and spelling schools and the 
like, and had to get over the serpent before entering the house. He 
described it asbeing covered with sharp scales, and said if any one stepped 
on it, in getting over, they would stick to it and would in consequence 
be thrown to the ground. The children became so familiar with it that 
they lost the horror it created when it first appeared. 
_ Among the people who lived there at the time, Mr. Johnson mentioned 
Joe Boyer who owned a place there and Jeremiah Mowery, a preacher 
who taught school there one winter. A man named Frame became fright- 
ened, and after selling his property to Joe Leverson, moved away ; 
Joe Leverson remained there and raised a large family. 
Mr. Johnson said that some could not see the snake but that all could 
feel it. If any one who was unable to see it tried to get over it, he fell 
just as the rest did. He said he had, on more than one occasion, seen 
a drunken man fly at it with a fence stake and beat it as hard as he 
could, but no impression was made on the serpent, though the stake 
would be broken to pieces. 
2738. There are several families in Maryland who are always warned 
in some way of approaching death in their circles ; the warning in each 
family being distinctive, and different from the “death tick,” which 
is usually heard on wood. There are also many old clocks that‘have 
been out of order and not wound up for years, that always strike before 
a death in the family. 
2739. In one family of good standing in Dorchester, there is seen, 
previous to a death, a hand holding a lighted candle, both reflected in 
the window of a lonely back hall. 
2740. In another family, the harbinger of death is the blooming 
in mid-winter of the mock-orange vine — a white flower that usually 
blooms in spring. 
2741. In the family of Dr. and Mrs. De L., who lived on Calvert 
St. near Madison, just before the Civil War, it was said that death to 
their family was announced by a cricket that chirped upon the hearth. 
2742. “In our family,” said Mrs. H. S. L. to me, “ we always hear 
three raps, close together, just before a death occurs. This has been the 
case for the past hundred years ; it is never heard at other times. ” : 
2743. “ An owl has been a herald of death in my father’s family, ” 
said this same lady, Mrs. H. S. L. 
13

2744. “Once an insect, never before heard in this country, came at 
the time of a death, with a strange wiz, wiz, wiz, wizing song. A neighbor 
heard it.” 
2745. At another place a hen crows, or tries to crow, as a prognos- 
tication of death. 
2746. In one house, if you put your ear to a certain log and hear the 
death watch a member of the family will die within the year. This house 
has been introduced by George Miles into his story called “ The 
Governess. ” 
2747-8. Mrs. J. D.E. gives the following account of a series of coinci- 
dences as they have happened in her family, beginning with Anne 
Hutchinson, her ancestress. 
One morning just after sunrise Anne Hutchinson and her grand- 
daughter were busy dusting. In the midst of the peace and quiet of 
this early hour, they suddenly heard the gallop of a horse, accompanied 
by the clicking noise of a loose horse-shoe. Anne Hutchinson started, 
listened, and turned pale. 
“Once before, dear child,” she said, “ I heard that noise in England. 
It was the day before the events occurred which made your grandfather 
and me determine to come to New England. ” 
The sound grew nearer, and presently Sir Harry Vane made his 
appearance. He had ridden out to the forest to commune alone with his 
God ; but he stopped to talk, telling Anne Hutchinson he had been 
praying much for her. As he rode away, he remarked that he must have 
his horse shod, as it had a loose shoe. The next day the summons came 
to Anne Hutchinson to appear and stand trial for her heretical teachings. 
She was excommunicated from the visible church in Boston, March 2nd, 
1638. After that, she left Boston, staying about eighteen months in 
Rhode Island and then settled in the Netherlands in New York. Anne 
was a warm friend of the Indians, and taught her children and grand- 
children to be as hospitable to them as to any one who came to the 
house. One family of Indians in particular was especially looked after 
by her. In it was a girl who seemed at one time to be wasting away 
from consumption. The girl’s father, an old chief, brought her to Anne 
Hutchinson to see if she could tell what was the matter with her. The girl 
was about the age of Anne’s granddaughter, Martha Hutchinson. Anne 
kept her in the family during the winter. 
Under the influences of a comfortable, happy home, together with a 
generous amount of kindness and nourishing food, Lenni, the Indian 
girl, improved rapidly ; her cough decreased and she gained flesh. When 
her father took her home in the spring, the change in her was looked 
upon by the Indians as a miracle. 
In 1643, some time after this occurred, as the Hutchinsons were sitting 
together one evening, a horse was heard approaching and with it the 
now ominous sound of the click of a loose horse-shoe. Again Anne started
-P-A-G-E-199
  Folk-Lore from Maryland 195 
and grew pale as the horsemen drew near. It was the Indian chief, Lenni’s 
father, who, after eating something, asked permission to take Martha 
back with him to see his daughter, who was five miles back in the forest. 
Though even for an Indian he seemed gloomy and uneasy, his request 
was granted ; Martha was desirous of going, and she carried a few pre- 
sents and kind messages to Lenni. 
After having ridden many miles, Martha began to grow uneasy and 
suspicious ; but any inquiry as to where the encampment was elicited 
always the same reply, “ Only a little farther on.” Sleep at last over- 
powered the girl and when she woke the sun was rising and the encamp- 
ment was in sight. Her fears and suspicions of the night increased by 
day ; for though Lenni was glad to see her, and every one was kind to 
her, no one would tell her why she had been brought here. In the weeks 
that followed, she realized that she was a prisoner. After a while, they 
all began to travel and Martha soon recognized familiar scenes in Rhode 
Island. She had been away from home a month when she was left, as 
strangely as she had been carried away, near her uncle’s house. 
The night she was taken away was the night of the terrible massacre 
in which her grandmother, Anne Hutchinson, her parents and most 
of her kindred perished, either by the flames or by the tomahawk. 
The latter part of the seventeenth century, Martha Hutchinson mar- 
tied Samuel Macfarland. During the Revolution she lived with her 
husband’s family, her husband being in the army. While he was at 
Valley Forge, she roused her brother-in-law one night, telling him she 
could hear her husband’s horse coming down the long hill. As this was five 
miles away, her brother-in-law told her it was impossible ; but she insist- 
ed that she heard it and the click of a broken horse-shoe. She finally 
grew so excited that her brother-in-law yielded to her entreaties that 
he should dress and be ready to welcome the husband or news of him. 
The young man got up, but before he could get to the stable the horse 
came up led by a neighbor, Samuel Macfarland being dead. 
In the year 1795, William Graham Macfarland, great-grand-father 
of Mrs. E., went as missionary beyond the Ohio river, then the Wild 
West. His home was in Bloomfield. He left his wife and children behind, 
but soon news came that he was ill and dying, and his brother went to 
bring him home. Some weeks later during evening service, while the 
last prayer was being said, the click of a broken horse-shoe was heard, 
William Macfarland’s wife started from her seat and went to the church 
door, where she saw, coming up the hill in the moonlight, her husband’s 
riderless horse with his knapsack fastened to the saddle. She fainted 
and never left her home again, dying herself a few months later. 
Next comes Mrs. E. ’s grandfather, a Presbyterian clergyman with 
a church called “Beulah”, near Pittsburg. On Christman Eve, 1837, 
his wife and son were sitting by the fire waiting for him to return from 
a visit to a dying parishioner. He rode an old horse, and as he was very  
-P-A-G-E-200
  196 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
stout, his family feared that in coming down steep hills the horse might 
stumble ; but man and horse knew and loved each other, and though 
he was now seventy, nothing of the kind had happened. He had told 
his wife he must go to the blacksmith’s and have new shoes put on his 
horse. His wife was talking to her son, when they both heard the click 
of a broken horse-shoe. They did not know at the time of the part that 
sound had already played in their family history, but they both ran at 
once to the door where they saw the horse and an empty saddle. The 
old man lay dead not far away, having fallen on his head and been 
instantly killed. The next strange experience occurred at the time when 
the Confederate army was very near Maryland. Mrs. E., then a young 
girl, sat with her mother and family on the porch of their summer home 
in Baltimore County. The moon was silvering the lawn and all was still 
and peaceful, but they sat there with anxious hearts that were full of 
foreboding. Suddenly came the sound of a horse galloping rapidly and 
the click of a broken horse-shoe, as well as the rattle of harness. Up the 
road came a colored man riding a horse, evidently taken from a broken 
vehicle, as the harness was hanging loose about him. The negro asked if 
they would send help to a gentleman down the road who had been 
seriously hurt. The horse which he was driving had cast a shoe, shied, 
and thrown the buggy into a ditch. 
The gentleman proved to be a young man in the Confederate army 
to whom Mrs. E. was then engaged to be married. She had no idea he 
was near Baltimore. He had obtained leave of absence and gone through 
the line and hired this horse and buggy in Baltimore. He was taken to 
the house and cared for, but only those who lived in Maryland during 
the War can realize the danger surrounding any family that harbored a 
Confederate soldier. When he had recovered sufficiently to return, in 
trying to get through the lines, he was captured, tried, and would have 
been hung as a Confederate spy had not one of Mr. Lincoln’s private 
secretaries, who was a friend of his family, taken the letters found on him 
to the President. He comprehended the situation at once, and remitted 
his sentence to imprisonment. When the war was over, he was released 
only to die of broken health and spirits. 
There are other descendants of the Hutchinsons and Grahams living 
in the Cumberland Valley, Maryland, and in many other parts of this 
country. 
Since Mrs. E. told the incidents narrated above, she herself has died. 
One of her daughters tells us that shortly before her mother’s death, 
she and her sister were sitting with their mother one evening when a 
horse galloping up the road attracted their attention. They were in the 
mountains and the road was a dirt one, but Miss E. said she remarked 
on the metallic sound of the horse’s hoofs ; it sounded, she says, as 
though he were going over cobblestones. Presently the mother said 
earnestly, “ Thank God you heard it! I thought I was the only one
-P-A-G-E-201
  
Folk-Lore from Maryland 197 
that heard it!” It was not till after her death, two weeks later, that 
her daughters realized that Mrs. E. had connected the metallic sound 
with that of the broken horse-shoe. 
2749. A member of the Maryland Folk-lore Society reports this 
incident in their family. As they were seated around the tea table, the 
mother said to the servant, “ Go tell Mr. M. we are waiting for him; 
I saw him, not long since, go upstairs.” But no one was found upstairs, 
and soon a message came that their father had died suddenly in his 
office down town. 
3. STORIES OF WITCHCRAFT, DEVIL’S BABIES, ETC. 
2750. Aunt Sarah was very black and very old and she was fond 
of her pipe. She had learned to smoke from her mammy, who learned it 
from her grandmammy who was a witch. This grandmother was phthi- 
sicky, and often called for her pipe at night, as smoking relieved her. 
It was her granddaughter’s duty to fill her pipe just before going to bed 
and also to get up and light it, if necessary. Some nights, though, the 
grandmother would say, “ Guess you needn’t fix my pipe to-night ; I 
don’t reckon I’ll want it,” and on those nights, if the granddaughter 
woke up, she found herself alone, and her mother and grandmother 
gone. 
One night when grandmother had declined her pipe, the girl pretended 
to be asleep, and she saw the two women get the lump of rabbit’s fat 
off the mantelpiece, rub themselves all over, and say, “ Up and out and 
away we go!” The third time, away they flew up the chimney. She 
quickly got up, rubbed herself with the rabbit’s fat, saying. “ Up and 
about and away we go!” And up and about she went. flying around 
the room, bumping and thumping herself against the wall and rafters 
until daylight. Her ambition was not satisfied, however, by this experi- 
ence. The next time she observed more closely, and saw that her 
maternal relatives greased themselves with downward strokes, and 
said not, Up and about, but, “ Up and out and away we go!” She care- 
fully repeated this procedure, and slipped up the chimney after them. 
Mammy and grandmammy each took a horse out of the field, leaving 
nothing for her but a yearling. So she took the yearling and rode until 
cock-crow. (Miss K.) 
2751. Once there was a man who kept a store. His wife was a witch, 
but he didn’t know it. Things were frequently stolen from the store, and 
they couldn’t find out who took them. It was really the clerk who stole 
them, and the storekeeper’s wife always helped him to get away ; for 
after he’d stolen anything she’d say, “ Over the woods and over the 
water, follow me. ” And then he’d fly off with her to some safe place, 
where he could hide the things, and then fly back to the edge of the 
town, and from there he’d walk to the store, so he wouldn’t ever be
-P-A-G-E-202
  
  198 Memotrs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
caught. At last the storekeeper watched one night, and caught the 
clerk stealing, and they were going to hang him for it. But when he was 
on the gallows, the witch came along and said, “ Off the gallows, and 
over the water, follow me, ” And so he got off clear. 
2752. A man was invited to dine at the house of a woman who was 
supposed to be a witch and to be able to “ conjure” him through the 
food he ate. He put a ten cent piece in his mouth when he went there, 
and ate a hearty dinner and when he left, he took the ten cent piece 
out of his mouth. It had not changed color, so he knew he had not been 
“ conjured. ” 
2753. My mother, she knew a woman that was mightily bothered 
by a witch. En’y night, soon as de woman went to bed and tu’n over 
on her back, dat witch would come and jump on her and ride her hard, 
so she couldn’ move. So one night she fix for dat witch. She put pins in de 
seat of a chair, and when de witch come, she sot right down on de pins. 
Witches have to set down befo’ dey can git out de skin ; dey can’t ride 
you as long as dey is in dey skin. Well, de witch sot down on de pins, 
an’ she stuck fas.’”” She couldn’ git up out o’ de chair, and she beg de 
woman to let her go and she promise ef she did, she wouldn’ come back 
no mo’. Den de woman let her go. Nor’m, I aint never seen no witch, 
but den I got a horseshoe up over my do’. Dey say de witch go to travel 
all over de road dat horseshoe been, ’fo she can get in de house, and time 
she git back ’twould be day. Some folks puts a sifter over de do’, and de 
witch got to count all the holes in de sifter and a witch con’t count but 
five, and when she gits to the five, she jumps through dat hole and is 
gone. Some folks can see witches better than others. A’n Abby’s son 
Allan, he went with me one night to sit up with a girl that died, and all 
along de road he’d stop and say he saw somethin’, and them he’d walk 
around and say somethin’ was in his path and he couldn’ pass. Some- 
times it was a dog, and sometimes it was a man with his head off, but I 
aint seen nothin’ and I ain’t gwine wid him no mote. ( Told to Mary. 
Willis Minor by a Negro.) 
2754. Miss K. tells a story of her grandfather, named Stokes, who was 
a famous witch-finder. He was called in once by a farmer who promised 
him fifty dollars if he could cure a valuable horse that the farmer had rea- 
son to think was bewitched. Stokes proceeded to work by taking a hoop off 
a barrel and passing it over the horse’s head, repeating a secret formula. 
He then replaced it and began to hammer it down. “ Shall I drive it 
hard ?” he asked the farmer. “ Yes,” was the reply. “I don’t care if 
you kill the witch!” Just then the farmer’s little boy ran out of the 
house, crying, “ Little old Stoke, my mother says if you don’t stop, 
you'll kill her!” At this the owner of the horse became very angry with 
Stokes for harming his wife. And he refused to pay the fifty dollars. 
Miss K. says they went to law about the money. 
2755. A woman was suspected of bewitching her husband’s horse,
-P-A-G-E-203
  
  Folk-Lore from Maryland 199 
The animal refused to eat or drink, pulling back from the trough in 
fright as if struck by something. A neighbor, who was said to be able to 
overcome the power of witches, was called in ; and after some myster- 
ious muttering and pacing around the horse and in and out the stall, 
he gave the horse a kick in the side. At this, the woman, who was look- 
ing on, walked away, holding her side, as though she felt the effects 
of the kick. As the man was leaving the farm, the woman crossed his 
path in the form of a snake, but he avoided her, and escaped harm. He 
could have killed the snake, but would not, knowing what it was. 
This woman’s reputation as a witch seems firmly established. I heard 
many stories of her. She was known as a very industrious, honest woman, 
not very quarrelsome, but capable of using abusive language when 
angered. She died but recently. 
2756. This witch woman, going to a neighbor’s one day on an 
errand, prolonged her stay without apparent reason, till it was almost 
night. Although she was very uneasy all the time, and kept saying 
there was sickness at home and she ought to be there, still she didn’t go. 
Finally, it was discovered that the broom had fallen across the door. 
When it was taken away, she fairly flew. Of course, this looked very 
suspicious. But, not to be rash in their judgment, the people of the house 
sought further proof. So, the next time she came, salt was thrown under 
her chair, and there she sat, as though bound, until it was removed. 
Then, as her visits were now considered undesirable, nails were driven 
into her tracks, but the place in the ground was marked, in case the 
footprints became obliterated. It soon became known that she was laid 
up with sore feet, which refused to heal until the nails had been dug up. 
2757. The year 1889, was a bad year for peaches. Coming home late 
one night, some young men passed a place where the only peaches in the 
neighborhood were said to be. They all “ felt for peaches.” But the 
owner of the peaches was likewise the owner of a savage dog. But one 
of the party bethought himself how to lay the dog. He took his pocket- 
knife and drove the blade into a stake of the stake-and-rider fence, 
saying three times, “ Dog, keep your mouth shut until I release you. ” 
In the language of an eye-witness, “ that dog nearly tore his toe nails 
off getting to the back of the house. And there he stayed, with never a 
word out of him, until we had all the peaches we wanted. Of course, we 
only took a few to eat. As Jake pulled the knife out, the dog flew around 
the house again, raging like mad, and we made good time down the 
road!” 
2758. Old “ Aunt Tilly” is quite lame. It was said that some man, 
suspecting her to be a witch, fired at her picture; but she says her 
lameness came from rheumatism. 
2759. A young man’s visit to his sweetheart was sadly marred by 
the antics of a black cat, which would appear in the room every night 
and fly from floor to ceiling in the most surprising manner. Sometimes 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  200 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
a black squirrel would relieve the cat ; and all the time there was a 
terrific accompaniment, as of armies of rats, scratching and scrambling 
in the walls and under the floor. Finally, the man provided himself 
with a pistol and a silver bullet, stopped the key-hole and waited. But 
after these preparations had been made, neither cat nor squirrel re- 
appeared. 
2760. There was a baby said to be bewitched ; it would eat nothing 
but meat, and it grew thinner and thinner. Some friends thought they 
could cure the child by catching the witch. The mother was told on no 
account to speak or scream at the time appointed for the witch to appear. 
At this time, a large cat jumped through the window and ran towards 
the child ; on reaching the child, the cat turned into a woman. The mother 
screamed ; the charm was broken, the witch escaped, the child died. 
2761. The following story of witchcraft was told by a mulatto or 
quadroon stewardess of Baltimore, on a steamer sailing from Boston 
to Baltimore. The stewardess had learned the particulars from her 
mother, who, with the mother’s half-brother, the hero of the story 
lived in Salisbury, Md. Every night a black cat came and rode on the 
man’s chest. He was told that it was not really a cat but a witch, and 
was advised to set a trap for it in the usual way ; that is by thrusting a 
fork through a sieve, so the tines would project inside of it. This he did, 
placing the sieve close beside him. The cat, in attempting to leap on his 
chest as usual, was impaled on the fork and unable to get off. Next morn- 
ing it was found that the next-door neighbor, a woman, was sick abed 
with a “ misery in her breast,” the location of the pain corresponding 
exactly to the wounded place on the chest of the cat. This neighbor 
died of the injury within the week. 
2762. The same woman related the following: Her mother, when 
a girl, lived in Salisbury, Md., in service with two reputable and well- 
to-do old maiden ladies. She noticed that one of these old ladies was in 
the habit of going out very late, remaining out perhaps all night. She 
told her mother of this, saying she thought there was something queer 
about the old ladies ; and the mother suggested that possibly they were 
witches. One night the old ladies asked the colored girl to have her 
mother come to stay with her, as they were both to go away that night. 
The mother came, bringing a companion with her. As the evening wore 
on, the old ladies sent the colored girl and the mother to bed, saying 
that they themselves would lock up the house. Then the ladies went 
to their chambers, ostensibly to dress. The negroes, suspecting some- 
thing, watched them through a keyhole, and saw them go to the hearth 
in their chamber, and there slip out of their human skins, appearing 
| as two black cats, which then scrambled up the chimney. One of the 
witnesses put salt and pepper on the empty skins that lay on the hearth- 
rug. Afraid to stay to watch the consequences, they ran from the house, 
telling the neighbors to watch in the morning and see what would happen. 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
Folk-Lore from Maryland 201 
The neighbors were on hand at an early hour, and, on peeping through 
the shutters, saw first one, and then the other of the black cats crawl 
back into the human skin that belonged to it then leap out in an agony 
of smarting, and so in and out, in and out for a long time. 
2763. Physicians with negro patients often have to humor them 
when “ possessed” and profess to remove the intruder ; though it is 
the hoodoo doctor who is adept at that. An old colored woman declar- 
ed she had a snake in her back that whistled. Sometimes it .would 
work around to her chest and then she would clutch at it and hold it 
tight for fear people would hear it whistle. She told Miss J. in whose 
family she had formerly lived for years, that she knew a doctor who 
would lift the spell for § 15.00. Miss J. determined to find out something 
about this doctor before the old woman spent her money on him. Having 
obtained his address, she went to his office which was ornamented on 
walls and ceilings by bunches of herbs of various sizes and shapes. The 
doctor, she discovered, was from the West Indies. He was a graduate 
of a Medical school in the United States but as he expressed it, he had 
become disgusted with the regular practice of medicine and had gone 
“back to nature ;” hence his herbs, from which he compounded his 
own medicine. Miss J. spoke to him about the old woman and asked 
how he proposed to “ lift the spell..” He said the old woman needed a 
course of medicine, and he said that if he gave her that and cured her 
he would “lift the spell.” 
A real hoodoo doctor would show the snake after he had removed it 
and probably turn it against the individual who had cast the spell, as 
in the following case. 
2764. A colored woman was taken with violent attacks of chills and 
fever, having two and three chills a day. She concluded she must be 
“spelled, ” so she went to a hoodoo doctor to have the spell taken off. 
The doctor, a woman, told her who had laid the spell on her and that 
she had done it by putting things in her feather bed. She proceeded to 
“lift the spell” and the patient made her a present of the feather bed. 
Out of this the “doctor” took some little balls, some snake sheds, 
lizards, etc. These she planted near an old stump, wishing them back 
to the woman who had cast the spell. This woman died suddenly ; but 
the woman on whom she cast the spell lives today to tell the story to her 
grandchildren. 
2765. A man’s well laid scheme went wrong because he couldn’t 
hold his tongue. His cattle had died unaccountably. So he built a pyre 
of brush and cordwood and began to burn the bodies. Soon, across the 
field, a woman was seen, circling round in her approach to the fire. At 
last her clothing nearly touched the flame. “ Gad ! but that was close!” 
he exclaimed. Instantly she shot away, released from her punishment. 
2766. I happened to be present when an old lady, who had been 
away visiting, was asked for news of friends down the country. 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  202 Memotrs of the American Folk-Lore Society 
“Oh, ” she said, “I didn’t get tosee them. I was on my way to their 
house when someone told me that their cow had died, and they were 
trying for the witch. Of course I didn’t go then.” 
2767. When Mr, F’s child was taken with crying spells at night, he 
stood it as long as he could; but being a workingman, as he said, he 
couldn’t afford to lose his rest. So, when all remedies failed, he decided 
that the child was tormented and he must try for the witch ; especially 
as his wife admitted having met an old woman some days before who 
admired and caressed the child. His preparations were elaborated ; but 
neglecting to take his mother-in-law into his confidence, they failed. 
For, when the witch came a-borrowing, she accommodated her. Other- 
wise, he assured me, the witch’s punishment would have been dire : 
“She would have busted!” 
2768. A story was freely circulated in 1902 of the birth of a devil 
baby in Baltimore. A short time before, the members of a Polish church 
had objected to having a certain priest placed over them. Their protests 
proved unavailing, they had openly rebelled and refused to recognize 
the Cardinal or Pope. The mother and father of the so-called devil 
baby were members of this church and were fiercely rebellious. Some 
time before the child was born, according to the story as it came to us, 
a peddler had tried to persuade the mother to buy a picture of the 
Virgin. She declined to purchase, and when he persisted in his efforts, 
and said that she ought to have a picture of the Virgin on her walls, she 
said angrily that she would rather have a picture of the devil there. 
When, therefore, her child was born, it had horns and a tail and spoke 
saying, “ I have come to curse you; I have come to curse you!” 
When we heard the story, we were told that the rush of people to see 
the child was so great that the parents were charging admission of ten 
cents. We arranged with an intelligent negro woman to go to examine 
the child to see if there was anything abnormal about it. She reported 
the child as perfectly normal in form. Some months afterward in speaking 
of the subject to an officer of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, he told us 
there was scarcely a day when some one did not apply at the hospital 
for permission to see the devil-baby, for the report had gone forth that 
it had been given to the hospital. 
Two or three weeks after this notice appeared, the New York Journal 
published a similar account of the birth of a devil-baby in “ Little Italy, ” 
New York. Illustrations were given showing a child with horns, cloven 
feet, hairy hands and a tail. 
2769. Among the slaves on my grandfather’s plantation was an aged 
negress who had at one time been an African princess. Before belonging 
to my grandfather, she had been owned by another old family in the 
county, to which she was deeply attached. When her master lost the 
greater part of his property, Aunt Sukey took an axe, and deliberately 
chopped off two fingers of her right hand on the horse block, so that it 
would be impossible to sell her into the far South as a field hand.
-P-A-G-E-207
Folk-Lore from Maryland 203 
She was held in great awe by the children of the plantation, as she 
was commonly supposed to be in league with a familiar spirit, one 
Parti-gee-ho, whom she frequently threatened to call out from his 
hiding place in the wall the moment they became in the least trouble- 
some. 
This Parti-gee-ho was pictured as having cloven hoof, horns, tail and 
body of a great black ox, with nostrils that breathed forth smoke and 
flame, and eyes like live coals. 
2770. The colored people of the county had many legends concerning 
the lords of the manor, some of which were told with bated breath, in 
“the dark of the moon.” Thus it was whispered concerning a distant 
relative of mine, whose record had been such an evil one that few express- 
ed a doubt as to what was to be his reward in the next world, that on 
the night he lay dying, a terrific thunder roared about the house. The 
single watcher saw the heavy shadows creep around the sick man. 
Suddenly, over the rush of the storm, came the echo of an infrequent 
sound, — the galloping of a gigantic horse. Nearer, nearer, up the low 
veranda, to the very window of the dying man’s room, dashed a great 
black stallion with nostrils and eyes of fire and hoofs that gleamed with 
sparks, and on its back a dark shrouded figure with eyes like red flames. 
Only a moment they paused, and with them the man’s soul passed to 
its own place. (Dorchester County Md.)

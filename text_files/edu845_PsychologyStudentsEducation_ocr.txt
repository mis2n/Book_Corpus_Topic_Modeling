    PREFACE 
This book has been written to meet the needs of 
students of education who are seeking from psychology 
the facts and principles that have a bearing upon their 
problems. It is designed to serve both as a text for col- 
lege and normal school courses and as a book for general 
reading by the student. already engaged in professional 
service. 
In selecting materials, I have been guided by the aim 
of presenting clearly and accurately the important prin- 
ciples of psychology with illustrations and applications 
that are of distinct significance in education. The out- 
come of this effort has been a departure in several respects 
from the usual introductory textbook of psychology. Per- 
haps the most conspicuous deviation is the omission or 
reduction of space devoted to some of the experimental 
and descriptive studies of the sensory processes and per- 
ception. The facts of color combinations, the theories 
of vision and audition, illusions, and the perception. of 
‘time and movement are samples of topics that have been 
omitted entirely or relegated to a subordinate position. 
A brief account of the introspective analysis of the con- 
tent of consciousness has been included, however, partly 
to give the student some familiarity with this field of 
research and partly to introduce portions of the technical 
vocabulary essential to the understanding of later sec- 
tions and much of the suggested collateral reading. The 
various mental processes, such as perception, memory, 
and conception, are treated mainly as varieties of re- _

actions and types of learning rather than as mental 
structures. 
A relatively large amount of space and emphasis is 
given to the mechanics and dynamics of human nature 
for which much of the first part of the book is prepara- 
tory. The treatment of the receiving, connecting and 
reacting mechanisms, however, is schematic and brief. 
Attention is centered on the functions rather than the 
structures of these organs, and little is presented that does 
not bear upon the genuinely psychological problems that 
follow. 
The investigations of learning in the case of the 
“higher” mental processes of analysis, abstraction or con- 
ception and reasoning are few, but the need of guidance 
in educational practice is here most keenly felt. My at- 
tempt to meet this need on the basis of available facts 
may have resulted in an impression of dogmatism. I 
have, however, preferred to state what seem to be the 
best solutions of the problems rather than to confuse the 
student with divergent views or to neglect important 
issues. . 
My obligations for assistance in the preparation of 
the book are heavy. To Professor E. L. Thorndike, 
I am indebted, not only for many suggestions for the 
revision of a first draft of the manuscript which he 
read, but for the wider influence of his teachings and 
writings that will be obvious throughout the book. 
Lam grateful to Miss Eloise Boeker, Miss Donah Lithauer 
and Miss Dorothy Van Alstyne who have read the 
manuscript and proof in whole or part. Most deeply 
of all, I am indebted to my wife, Dr. Georgina 8. Gates, 
who has written a large number of the exercises appended 
to the chapters and whose tireless interest in reading 
and criticising the manuscript in every stage of prepa-

CHAPTER I 
THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER OF 
PSYCHOLOGY 
By the use of methods similar to those employed in the . 
natural sciences, psychology attempts to solve many of 
the problems concerning human behavior which have 
long been treated in less exact fashion. Teachers, phy- 
sicians, lawyers, preachers, business executives, in fact, 
people in all walks, of life attempt to understand, as best 
they may, by observing their own impulses; feelings, 
thoughts, and acts, as well as the behavior of others, the 
general characteristics of human conduct, and the pe- 
culiar traits of particular individuals. As a result of our 
observations, most of us have acquired notions concerning 
the motives which may be relied upon to stir us or others 
to action; concerning the acts and situations which please 
and displease; concerning the signs by which. emotions 
and thoughts are made manifest. We have acquired 
methods of estimating traits of character such as honesty, 
sociability, ambitiousness, and traits of mind, such as 
alertness, depth, and sagacity. We have convictions 
concerning the relative mentality of men and women; 
concerning the temperaments of negroes and whites; con- 
cerning the learning capacity of children and adults. 
We have beliefs about the influence of the weather, fa-

tigue, or coffee upon efficiency in thought or skill. Long 
the subject of ordinary speculation, these problems and 
many similar ones when attacked by scientific methods 
constitute psychology. 
Tue GeneraL Meruops or Screntiric INvesTicatTion 
The Unreliability of Ordinary Observation.—Ordi- 
nary observation of human behavior is extremely un- 
trustworthy and as a consequence personal opinions are 
likely to be incorrect. Several investigations, under con- 
ditions similar to those of actual life, have disclosed a 
fallibility of observation and report which. seems almost 
incredible. For example, an act involving a quarrel was 
once_carefully rehearsed, the stage photographed, the 
conversation memorized, and the brief scene then per- 
formed before a group ‘of professional men. Thinking 
the quarrel real, and anticipating the use of their testi- 
mony in court, the witnesses wrote out a full report. 
Among the forty men, only one had observed and re- 
membered as much as 80 per cent of the important facts, 
twenty-six had omitted from 20 to 50 per cent, and 
thirteen more than half. Besides these omissions, from 
5 to 50 per cent of the statements were erroneous; some 
of them pure inventions. 
That the surprise and emotional upset are not mainly 
responsible for such results has been frequently demon~ 
strated by experiments upon witnesses who were aware 
of the artificiality of the scene. A section of a motion 
picture requiring about three minutes’ time was shown 
to a group of college students who were familiar with 
the character of errors in such experiments. Following 
the display, a list of 60 questions concerning more or 
Jess obvious details were asked. From 10 to 40 per cent
-P-A-G-E-22
4 ' THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 3 
were unanswered, and of the replies from 8 to 50 per cent 
were wrong. When the task is made even more simple 
by giving the subject an ordinary colored picture for a 
half minute of study, the reports still show glaring omis- 
sions and errors. 
Methods of Increasing the Reliability of Observation. 
The unreliability of observation noted in such experi- 
ments is due partly to the subject’s inexperience in the 
particular field, partly to the complexity of the events, 
and partly to their brevity. The scientific worker at- 
tempts to improve the conditions of observation in these 
three directions. First, he must secure training in per- 
ceiving the particular items of interest. Just as the 
physician must learn to detect with greater accuracy the 
physical signs of disease, the psychiatrist those of in- 
sanity, the teacher those of inattentiveness, as the result 
of continued practice, so in psychology the investigator 
must learn to observe his own mental states, the fleeting 
images of memory or imagination, the feeling content of 
anger, excitement or fear, or the qualities of organic sen- 
sations, as well as the eye-movements, facial expressions, 
vocalizations or other results of activity in other people. 
Although nearly every one has observed the eyes of others 
during the act of reading, few people have noticed with 
any precision the jerky, start and stop character of the 
movement of the eye as it follows the printed line. Even 
when attention is called to the eye-movements, they“are 
not readily perceived at first, although after a period of 
practice they may be observed with considerable pre- 
cision. Practice will greatly improve the accuracy and 
precision of observation along any line, hence the scien- 
tific method demands trained observers. 
Observation becomes more effective when the facts to. 
be considered are isolated and controlled. Isolation may
-P-A-G-E-23
4 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
be secured partly as the result of training, inasmuch as 
one may learn to attend to certain facts while neglecting 
others. One reason for the incompleteness of observa- 
tion and report in such experiments as those mentioned 
above, lay in the fact that attention was under no definite 
control, was guided by no particular question. The sub- 
jects observed in general. Attention must be specifically 
controlled and directed to the pertinent matters lest the 
observer be led astray by irrelevant details or place em- 
phasis on the wrong facts. 
The Conditions of an Experiment.—The facts of ob- 
servation must be isolated in another sense, in the me- 
chanical sense that the observer must control all of the 
conditions which may conceivably affect the factor under 
study. The character of the eye movements, for ex- 
ample, may vary according to the length of the line, the 
difficulty of the material, the size of the type, or the 
brightness of the illumination. Usually the subject, 
therefore, is seated in a room from which unusual light, 
sounds, and other distractions are excluded. The mate-_ 
rial to be read, the distance of the eyes from the copy, 
and all other factors which might affect the performance 
are controlled and reproduced when the experiment is 
repeated. 
When the investigator is attempting to discover the 
causes and effects of an observed fact, it is especially im- 
portant to isolate the fact and control all other factors. 
Thus, to ascertain the effect of the difficulty of reading 
material upon the character of the eye movements, it 
would be necessary to hold constant all of the factors— 
length of the line, size of type, illumination, fatigue, etc, 
—while the difficulty of the material alone varied in re. 
peated tests. In studying the effects of ventilation on 
mental efficiency, subjects were kept in a room in which
-P-A-G-E-24
  THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 5 
temperature, movement of the air, humidity, the per- 
centage of oxygen, and the percentage of expired matter 
could be mechanically and independently varied. Under 
these conditions, the specific effects of temperature could 
be determined by securing samples of work under differ- 
ent degrees of heat, while other factors were held constant. 
Similarly the influence of humidity or of other factors 
could be ascertained by varying each while all others are 
controlled. : 
Human subjects are played upon by so many forces 
and their adjustments to them ure so subtle, that extraor- 
dinary care must be exercised to secure adequate control 
of the conditions. A business-college teacher had de- 
veloped a system of teaching handwiiting. It was urged 
that this system was better than any other because most 
of the pupils became unusually good writers. But the 
truth was that the unusual amount of time and relentless 
insistence on achievement rather than the merits of the 
system were responsible for the pupils’ success. Causes 
can be determined only when all of the influences are 
taken into account. The writing system must be tried by 
many different teachers on many different classes and 
the results compared with those obtained from trials of 
other systems, when the length of practice, the skill of 
teachers, the initial ability and interest of the pupils, and 
other factors are equalized. Comparison of the school 
grades of students who smoke with the marks of non- 
smokers is usually of no scientific value for the same 
reason: we cannot tell whether the difference is due to 
smoking or to some one or more of many other factors 
such as differences between the groups in home sur- 
roundings, general intelligence, or to drinking or other 
habits. 
In addition to isolating the facts to be observed and
-P-A-G-E-25
6 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
controlling all. other significant influences, the scientific 
method demands that an observation must be repeated 
before it is finally accepted. The possibility of repetition 
must be insured by a careful description of the experi- 
mental conditions. This is an important scientific safe- 
guard. It is not sufficient that the same observer repeat 
an experiment, although this is desirable. He must state 
his procedure in full so that another investigator, per- 
haps one who is skeptical, may set up an identical outfit 
and repeat the experiment. In this way, errors in ob- 
servation, recording, and computation, and mistakes due 
to failure to observe all of the influences at work or to 
other defects, are frequently discovered. 
Isolation of the facts to be observed, control of other 
factors which may influence the results, and the provision 
for repetition of the whole procedure constitute the ex- 
perimental method. An_experiment thus differs. from 
ordinary observation in that it is more carefully carried 
‘out,it.is more rigid, cautious, tious, and systematic. 
The Use of Mechanical Aids to Supplement Observa- 
tion.—Even with all of the precautions which character- 
ize the experiment, the results may be incomplete and 
often erroneous since, even when well trained, observa- 
tion is not infallible. Greater precision may often be ob- 
tained by the use of mechanical devices. The astronomer 
utilizing the telescope, and the botanist the microscope, 
are able to make more accurate and detailed observation. 
than could be accomplished by the unaided eye. Espe- 
cially useful for scientific purposes are the instruments 
which yield a permanent record of the facts which may 
be studied at any time by any person. Thus, both ag. 
tronomers and botanists utilize extensively the photo— 
graphic camera. Similarly, in psychology, instead of de— 
pending upon the report of an investigator who studieg
-P-A-G-E-26
THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 7 
the movements of the eyes by ordinary observation, we — 
prefer the photographic records that may be secured by 
use of an ingenious invention. Instead of estimating the 
changes in distribution of the blood, the force of the heart 
~beat or respiration during an emotion, it is better to se- 
cure graphic records by the use of a variety of delicate 
recording devices. Instead of describing the facial ex- 
pressions verbally, it is better to photograph them. Ad- 
vances in psychology, as in other sciences, have been oc- 
casioned, in part, by the development of instruments 
which have not only made observation more trustworthy 
but more detailed and refined. 
The Need of Measurements.—Of prime value are those 
instruments which make provision for a quantitative 
statement—a measurement. One can estimate roughly 
the heights of men, but for scientific purposes they must 
be measured with standard instruments under standard- 
ized conditions. One can estimate roughly the relative . 
speed of muscular reactions, but with a delicate timing 
device they may be measured in thousandths of a second. 
The brightest pages in the history of psychology are 
those relating to the development of measurements, and 
many inventions of measuring devices have made possible 
great progress in knowledge. The technique for measur- 
ing the frequency and duration of eye movements has 
been utilized in the study of a wide variety of problems 
in reading. The measurement of general mental ability 
mainly the work of the last decade has already led to 
researches that can scarcely be summarized in a single 
volume. The invention of measuring scales for educa- 
tional achievement was the forerunner of much of the 
scientific work in that field. Human traits‘are most of 
them unusually difficult to measure because of their com- 
plexity and because of the variations in performance from
-P-A-G-E-27
8 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
test to test. For some of the more complex human 
traits such as initiative, social sagacity, or persistence no 
very accurate measuring devices have as yet been de- 
veloped and in proportion as these abilities cannot be 
measured, our knowledge of them remains inexact. Thus, 
in addition to isolation of the factors to be observed, in 
addition to control of all the significant influences, and 
in addition to the provision for repetition of the whole 
procedure by trained observers, the scientific method 
ideally supplants, or supplements, ‘ordinary observation 
by objective records, given whenever possible in the 
form of a quantitative statement or measurement of 
_ the facts. 
Statistical Methods.—In most investigations of human 
behavior, another difficulty is encountered: human sub- 
jects differ markedly from each other in their behavior 
and the same individual reacts differently at different 
times. Care must be exercised therefore that the results 
of an experiment are typical of the behavior of the par- 
ticular subjects, and that the subjects adequately repre- 
sent the whole class of people of which they are but 
samples, A single test of the speed of muscular con- 
traction or a three-minute test of comprehension in read- 
ing is unlikely to yield a fair measure of an individual’s 
ability. Perhaps it will require ten, twenty, or fifty tests 
of muscular contraction, or ten, twenty, or fifty minutes of 
time to secure a fair measure of ability to comprehend in 
reading. Even if it had been determined, furthermore, 
by very thorough testing that a small number of children, 
who comprehended very well were also very slow readers, 
it would be unsafe to generalize that very slow readers 
have great depth of comprehension. If we found in q 
particular sixth grade that the brightest children were al] 
rather nervous children, or that the boys of the group

surpassed the girls in memorizing poetry, statements 
about the general characteristics of bright pupils or of the 
sexes should not be hastily made. _ If we desire to solve 
general problems such as: what is the relation of speed 
and depth of reading; what is the relation of intelligence 
and emotional stability; or what are the relative abilities “ 
: of boys and girls in general, we need. ewe than a tpch- \.

tistical methods. 
By means of statistical devices it is possible to astertain 
how many times or for how long a time we must test an 
individual to secure a reliable measute of his reading or 
of any other ability. Similarly it is possible to determine 
how many individuals of a given age or sex must be 
‘tested to produce a measure fairly representative of the 
age or sex groups. In the event of an insufficient num- 
ber of tests or individuals, it is possible to compute the 
magnitude of the error of the measures. This is but one 
of the statistical devices which form a part of the pro- 
gram for accuracy and precision characteristic of the 
scientific method. 
Summary.—The scientific investigation should embraee 
the following characteristics: (1) The investigator 
should be properly trained; (2) he should isolate-as ef- 
_fectively as possible the events to be observed; (3) he 
should control all other variables that might conceivably. 
“influence the results; (4) he should define the setting and 
procedure so that he or other investigators or both may 
be able to repeat the investigation;.(5) when possible, 
he should employ objective measurements ‘instead of or- 
Sey observation and he should state his results in 
and characteristics of the subjects, by means of which

knowledge the statistical reliability of the results may be 
-ascertained. . 
Tur DrvELOPMENT or HyPoTHESES AND Laws 
The immediate aim of experimentation, guided by such 
rules as those just given, is to secure facts. An appear- 
ance is admitted to be a fact when several investigators, 
under identical conditions, observe it. The aim of— 
science, however, is not merely the accumulation of par- 
ticular facts; it is more than this, namely, the interpreta- 
tion of facts, the discovery of principles, laws or general 
truths. When Benjamin. Franklin flew his kite in a 
thunder-storm, he observed a phenomenon, an electric 
spark jumping from the cord. Verified on other occa~ 
sions, it was recognized as a fact. When Franklin stated 
as a result of his observations that lightning was merely 
a huge electric spark, he had gone beyond the observable 
facts. _He had developed an hypothesis which was borne 
out by later investigations and finally accepted as a gen~ 
eral principle, a law or general truth. . 
-An-hypothesis is any conception by means of which the 
mind goes beyond the facts and seeks to establish rela. 
tions betwegn data that have been observed. It is q 
conjecture, a guess, a provisional explanation; it is an. 
interpretation or eplargement of what is observed. The. 
development of hypotheses is one of the important fea— 
tures of the scientific work. The ability to generalize or 
theorize has been the outstanding characteristic of most 
eminent men of science. Conjecturing, guessing, theoriz 
ing, is not confined to any one period of an investigation ; 
it is usually incessantly active, preceding, accompanying, 
following, and guiding all experimentation. 
Just as the development of checks and controls of
-P-A-G-E-30
      THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER it 
observation in science reveals the history of man’s en- 
deavor to secure reliable perception and testimony, so‘ 
the gradual formulation of a series of rules to govern the 
development of hypotheses, portrays the discovery of 
many typical errors of thinking and reasoning and ef- 
forts to remedy them. As a result, the scientific method 
now ernbraces a number of rules; all of the rules of logic 
‘and in addition certain others that aim to secure precision 
in the construction of hypotheses. Of these, we shall 
discuss but one, the Law of Parsimony. 
The Law of Parsimony.-The Law of Parsimony 
which in one form or another has been accepted by all 
sciences, states that of several rival hypotheses, we should 
accept the one which is the simplest and which explains 
dhe most. Science favors, for example, the adoption of 
one group of explanations for learning of all sorts, type- 
writing, dancing, singing, memorizing, reasoning, rather 
than one set of hypotheses for memory, another for ac- 
* quiring muscular skills, another for developing apprecia- 
tion, and so on. What explanations are simplest must be 
determined by each science for itself. In psychology, 
- this aspect of the Law of Parsimony has been rather 
generally adopted in a form known as Lloyd Morgan’s 
Canon, which is here quoted from his “Inttoduction to 
_ Comparative Psychology” (1894): “In no case may we 
interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a 
- higher psychical faculty (mental process) if it can be in- 
térpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which 
stands lower in the psychological scale.” oe 
To illustrate Lloyd Morgan’s Canon, let, us suppose 
that our dog, caught in the forbidden pantry, cowers and 
‘whines piteously. What are the possible explanations of 
such conduct? Since the dog has been-carefully trained 
to keep away from the pantry, and is an intelligent and
-P-A-G-E-31
  12 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS. OF EDUCATION 
well meaning animal, he is suffering pangs of conscience. 
. One can discern remorse and penitence in his tones; he 
ply regrets the sinfulness of his ways. Another ex- . 
plaxation might be this: when the master happens upon 
’ the dog, the animal consciously remembers—has in fact a 
vivid mental picture—of what happened when he was last 
surprised in the pantry. On the basis of this memory 
revival, it was easy to reason what would probably be 
shortly forthcoming, hence the cowering and whining. 
A third explanation would be: the dog has for good rea- 
sons cowered and whined when previously caught in the 
pantry. Now, being confronted by the man-pantry situ- 
ation, he reacts by cowering and whining, a direct motor 
reaction unattended by “conscience,” “reason,” “con- 
scious memory” or any other “higher” mental process. 
The psychologist would probably accept the last explana- 
tion (or one somewhat like it) because it-is simplest in 
the sense of being lowest in the scale of psychological 
explanation. 
Psychology more than most sciences must be rigid in 
applying the Law of Parsimony, because fanciful and 
mystical explanations are supplied with such readiness. 
The prevalence of beliefs in magic, clairvoyance, telep- 
athy, mind reading, mystic inspirations, premonitions, in- 
tuitions, and mind cures is illustrative of the readiness, 
with which the supernatural rather than the simplest 
of psychological explanations are accepted. A New Eng 
land girl, Beulah Miller, found herself possessed of aq 
mysterious ability to divine many of her mother’s 
thoughts; for example, she could tell whether her mothey 
was thinking about the clock, the carpet, or the window, 
about the number 6 or 10. "The girl was entirely igng_ 
rant of the means by which she accomplished these feats 
While thought transference, independent of the channe   
     
     
                 
-P-A-G-E-32
THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 13 
of the ordinary senses, is suggested by such a perform- 
ance, the psychologist must search for simpler explana- 
tions. In this case it was found after careful investiga- 
tion that the girl, without knowing it herself, was getting 
her cues from slight eye, lip, or bodily movements of 
the mother who was not aware of having made them. 
Stages in the Development of Laws and Principles.— 
General truths, laws, or principles are arrived at grad- 
ually,” First, we have the guess or speculation. When 
you read original investigations, you will find reported a 
number of particular observed facts and usually an ef- 
fort to explain the facts, to generalize from the facts. As 
additional facts are secured which harmonize with the 
preliminary guess, the term hypothesis becomes proper. 
When the hypothesis is further substantiated by investi- 
gations, it may be dignified by the term theory, and when 
‘very thoroughly verified and proved the theory becomes 
a law or principle. The Law of Gravitation, for example, 
was first a mere guess, then a fairly well-rounded hypo- 
thesis, then a theory, until finally it became a law inas- 
much as it held good in all of the cases in which it was 
experimentally tested. 
In psychology, but few final principles or “laws of na- 
ture” have as yet been worked out. What we have are 
great numbers of particular facts and many hypotheses or 
working hypotheses as they are commonly called. The 
working hypothesis is a generalization formulated to ex- 
plain the facts at hand but recognized as a provisional or 
approximate explanation. It is a general statement de- 
signed to explain faithfully and simply a large body of 
facts, a formulation with which one proceeds to work 
but which one attempts to correct, improve, and refine as 
additional evidence is secured. It is a law or principle 
in the process of perfection.
-P-A-G-E-33
14 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
The Use of Laws in Prediction.—Because of its gen- 
eral applicability, the law or principle provides the means 
of making predictions, foretelling consequences. The 
astronomer utilizing the laws concerning the movement of 
planets can predict the exact moment at which the sun 
will rise each day for many years in the future. The 
physician observing certain symptoms, pulse, tempera 
ture, and the locus of pain, by virtue of known principles 
predicts, with more or less accuracy, the course of a 
disease and arranges the treatment accordingly. The 
psychologist, utilizing the principles of mental growth, 
predicts, at least roughly, from the results of an examina~ 
tion made at age seven, the degree of mentality that a 
particular pupil will possess at fifteen, and as such pre- 
dictions become more precise, the educational and voca— 
tional.treatment of children may be more adequately 
selected and controlled to suit the ability and needs of the 
particular individual. In so far as we are able to predict 
the future from the present, we may be able to meet the 
future more adequately. Prediction is an ultimate aim of 
scientific endeavor. 
Science, then, does not differ necessarily from everyday 
interests in the materials studied; any subject matter 
may be studied properly by scientific methods. It is not 
necessarily more or less practical in point of view. Scien— 
tific knowledge differs from ordinary knowledge chiefly in, 
‘thaie respects! it i (1) more predise and definite; (2) more certain and valid; (3) better r organized; and and (4) 
more universal in application. ~~ 
. Some of the general features of scientific study hay 
now been mentioned. These features are common to ay 
sciences and in so far as psychology or any other study 4, 
scientific, it abides by the rules and regulations of th 
scientific game. What distinguishes one science fro
-P-A-G-E-34
THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 15 
another is primarily the subject matter studied. Psy- 
chology, then, is the application of the methods ofseieace 
to the study “of ¢ f certain data. We shall next consider 
briefly the h nature of the subject matter of psychology.

The Study of Human Behavior.—Psychology seeks to 
discover the general Jaws which explain th ior, of 
Satan beligee “Te UnaeraRes TS feterine the role of 
the sense organs, of the nervous system, the muscles, 
glands, and other bodily organs.in everyday conduct. It 
attempts to describe and classify the several types of 
activity of which the normal individual is capable. It 
seeks to explain these activities in several ways. It en- 
deavors to ascertain what bodily organs are engaged in 
walking, speaking, judging distance, in anger and fear, in 
satisfaction and discomfort, in reading and thinking. It 
undertakes to determine what forms of action appear 
without learning; activities, which, like the breathing, 
swallowing, and crying of the newly-born infant, are the 
results of inner growth rather than training. Psychology 
also attempts to determine the principles which govern 
the process of learning to speak, dance, or read; to con- 
trol one’s temper or appreciate music; to solve geometri- , 
cal problems or to learn in any field whatsoever. It at- 
tempts to disclose the nature of differences among indi- 
viduals in capacities to learn, in temperamental and 
moral traits, and in specialized abilities of many kinds. 
It attempts to account for the causes of such differences, 
the character of their interrelations and the significance 
of each in the work of the school, in vocations, or social 
life generally. 
When the subject of the investigation is another person
-P-A-G-E-35
16 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
whose activities are observed either directly or by the aid 
of recording or measuring devices, the method is com- 
monk described as objective. The acti activities | of the. othe: 
person become the object of observation. What he does 
may be observed “as objectively as the operations of 
a machine, the activities in a mixture of chemicals, or 
the opening of the petals of a flower moved from darkness 
to light. The human being may be studied in the same 
manner that other natural objects are studied by such 
sciences as physics, chemistry, or botany, and all of the 
devices and precautions which constitute the scientific 
method may be utilized. Many of the problems of hu- 
man behavior may be solved by this objective method 
used in common with all other natural sciences. We can 
observe movements of the limbs, of the eyes, of the facial 
muscles; we can hear and record vocal expressions; we 
can secure graphic records of respiration and pulse and 
chemical activities from glandular secretion. With one 
exception, every kind of human activity of of which we now 
“have a congsplion-miag-be- hjeatiualy studied. The one 
exception is consciousness, that is, 0 one’s subjective mental 
experiences, one’s sensations, images, memories, feelings, 
emotions, and nd impulses, and the study of these activities 
dies rather exchisively- witht the province of psychology4 
The Study of Consciousness.—The description, classi- 
fication, and explanation of conscious or mental activity 
is one of the most important, even if one of the most 
difficult tasks of psychology. To secure some idea of the 
kind of problem that psychology may attempt to solve, 
suppose you try an experiment, now classic, by means of 
which the eminent scientist Sir Francis Galton was the 
first to disclose some interesting facts about conscious 
states. Seat yourself comfortably and try to recall ag 
vividly as you can the morning’s breakfast table. Can  
-P-A-G-E-36
Se THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 17 
you see, in your mind’s eye, the table, dishes, faces, food, 
and other details? Are these visual images dim or clear? 
Are they as bright as the actual scene? Can you really 
image the colors of the china, of the toast, eggs, coffee, 
ete., quite distinctly? Can you image the whole scene at 
once? For example, can you image all four walls of the 
room at once, or only the area that you could see from 
the particular position in the room? Where do the im- 
ages seem to be situated? Within the head, within the 
_eyehall, just in front of the eyes, or at a place correspond- 
ing to the real situation of the room? Can you retain the 
image steadily ¥“With or without effort? Can you pro- 
ject it to the wall? Yue 
In these, and other studies of consciousness, the data of 
investigation are purely subjective experiences, observa- 
tion of which is called introspection as distinguished from 
observation of the acts of another individual or of other 
events external to the observer. The investigator here as 
elsewhere should be properly trained, he should isolate 
the mental state to be examined and control other vari- 
ables by excluding irrelevant factors, especially distrac- 
tions, and by setting himself a particular task and holding 
to it; he should repeat the observation and apply statis- 
tical methods to the results. In two respects, introspec- 
tive investigations fall short of the ideal scientific pro- 
gram: (1) the facts under observation cannot be readily 
objectified or measured and (2) they cannot be observed 
by other investigators. There is no way, for example, 
by which your mental image of the breakfast table can be 
photographed or otherwise reproduced, nor can it be ex- 
posed to the observation of others. If you report, as one 
person did, that an image of the factory whistle comes as 
if colored brown, whereas the sound of the church bell is 
blue, iow is any one to discover whether this is a correct
-P-A-G-E-37
18 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
observation or not? The introspectionist answers that if 
similar experiences are reported by different people inde- 
pendently or if the same observer, known to be well 
trained and trustworthy, has the experience repeatedly, it 
should be considered reliable evidence quite like other 
types of experimental proof. In Galton’s experiment, for 
example, many trustworthy individuals repeatedly found 
that their imagery of the breakfast table was “brilliant, 
distinct, never blotchy,” others found it “fairly clear, 
brightness at least from one half to two thirds of the 
original” while others found their imagery to be “zero— 
no visual memories—recollect but do not see the scene.” 
These reports are at once of useful reliability and in 
rough quantitative terms. The investigator may arrange 
-a “scale” in which the highest degree of vividness, as 
quoted, is connected with the lowest by a number of steps _ 
or units which are roughly equal. : 
Introspective study is admittedly difficult, and unusual 
care must be exercised in utilizing the results of its use. 
Despite its limitations, it is the only mode of approach to 
many important problems in psychology, and in the 
hands of experts it has been and will continue to be fruit- 
fully employed. 
Tue Frevp or INVESTIGATION AND SuBsEcTS UTILIZED 
General psychology embraces the principles and expla- 
nations which hold for human behavior in general. The 
principles are drawn from investigations in many more 
or less specialized fields in which the immediate purposes 
of study are very diverse. Thus there are studies by 
psychological methods in the fields of business, education, 
law, medicine, religion, social service, etc., with many 
subdivisions in, and much overlapping among these fields,
-P-A-G-E-38
THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 19 
Each of these special fields borrows facts and principles 
from the others and applies them to its own problems. 
In turn, each contributes facts and principles to the body 
of the general science. In fact, the general science is a 
compact and systematized statement of principles. based 
upon the studies in the separate fields. 
The facts and principles of general psychology are not 
based entirely on the behavior of normal human adults. 
Indeed, some of the most important advances have re- 
sulted from the study of children, animals, and abnormal 
individuals; and. to these fields of research some attention 
should be given. 
The Study of Children—Infants and children are 
studied not only to provide an understanding of their 
behavior, but also to make more intelligible the behavior 
of adults. Because less complex and less distorted by 
training than those of adults, the native or inherited ten- 
dencies of infants and children are especially worthy of 
study. The learning of children, because of its relative 
simplicity and because it may be observed from the be- 
ginning, has been a fruitful field of research. The intro- 
spective reports of children are not highly reliable, and 
the analysis of consciousness is therefore extremely 
difficult. : 
A profitable procedure in the study of children is the 
genetic method which consists in following from year to 
year the growth of vocalization and ‘speech, emotional 
tendencies, the capacity to memorize, and other traits. 
Among the early genetic studies are a number of detailed 
' biographies based on observations of significant acts, re- 
marks, and interests of individuals from birth to various 
stages of childhood. More recently, a larger number of 
infants in maternity wards have been the subjects of 
daily observation by more carefully controlled methods.
-P-A-G-E-39
20 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
Where the behavior of such infants could not be objec- 
tively measured by timing devices, graphic recording ap- 
paratus, etc., it was frequently recorded by motion pic- 
tures, thus providing ample opportunity for observation 
by any number of interested investigators. ws 
Of the whole period from birth to maturity, the span 
from 6 to 14 years—that is; roughly, the period corre- 
sponding to the elementary s¢hool—probably has been 
most thoroughly studied, partly because a larger propor- 
tion of the total population is available for investigation 
at these ages and partly because the schools, more than 
most other institutions, are alive to the value of scientific 
studies of their problems. It is in this field that measure- 
ment of human traits by means of standardized tests and 
scales, and studies of learning in school and other func- 
tions, have made the greatest advances. It is here that 
studies of individual differences, the character of varia- 
tions in abilities, and their correlations have been most 
extensively applied. 
The Study of Animals.—In attempting to arrive at the 
general laws which govern human conduct, the study of 
animals, like the study of children, has been fruitful—and 
for much the same reason: the relative simplicity of their 
behavior. In dealing with animals there is another great 
advantage; their activities can be much more thoroughly 
controlled. Whether cats will catch mice, or whether 
birds can fly without practice or without observation of 
the performances of others, may be determined by com- 
pletely isolating the animal until the time when these 
activities usually appear, whereupon the animal is con- 
fronted, for the first time, with a mouse or an opportunity 
to fly. 
Under conditions similarly controlled, the learning of 
animals, because of its relative slowness and simplicity,
-P-A-G-E-40
THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 21 
has been the subject of extensive investigations by which, 
probably more than by observations of humans, the prin- 
ciples of learning have been determined. In addition to 
studies of instinctive behavior and the learning process, 
the relation of the sense organs and the nervous system 
to behavior has been investigated by methods often more 
adequate than those applied to human subjects, for the 
reason that it is possible by means of operation to ob- 
serve the loss or distortion in behavior which follows the 
removal of bodily organs in whole or part. Finally, the 
evolution of bodily organs from the simple to the complex 
may be followed in the animal species and correlated with 
the development of behavior. Since there is every reason 
to believe that human behavior, like human structure, 
is in many respects similar to that of animals even if 
much more complex, the study of the relation of struc- 
ture and behavior in the latter has been of great utility 
in interpreting human conduct. . 
The consciousness of animals, of course, cannot be di- 
rectly studied. At best, it may be indirectly inferred 
from their behavior; and such practice is too risky to 
yield information of much value in interpreting the 
human mind. 
The Study of Abnormal Individuals—Among ani- 
mals, children, and adults, individuals who deviate widely 
from the average either by inherited deficiency or 
aptitude or by acquired defects or ability have been found 
worthy of study, not only for their own sake, but because 
they often disclose in sharp relief the presence or ab- 
sence of a normal function. Just as a defective part of 
an automobile attracts our attention and leads to a closer 
understanding of its function, so among children who are 
normal except with respect to their incapacity to learn to 
read or spell we may often by the identification and study
-P-A-G-E-41
22 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
of a particular defect secure a better understanding of 
the child and the function. / 
Studies of the blind or deaf, of those suffering less 
severe sensory defects, of patients whose brains have been 
partly destroyed by accident or disease, have contributed 
greatly to knowledge of the functions of these organs in 
normal life. In delinquent children, criminal adults, the 
insane, in the emotionally or nervously instable, common 
human functions are often found in exaggerated form 
and are’ consequently the more readily observed. The 
equipment of the extraordinary musician, mathematician, 
mechanic, or executive may display other traits in extreme 
form. 
The Study of Groups—To profit most fully from 
studies of the extremes, whether above or below the aver- 
age, it is necessary to consider the intermediates as well. 
To this end many statistical methods have been devised 
by which the whole array of abilities, from one extreme to 
the other, may be considered at once. Of these, the tech- 
nique of correlation is most familiar. It is a device by 
which the interrelations of two (or more) abilities in a 
group of individuals may be determined. Thus, by de- 
termining both the speed of memorizing and the length of 
retention of material by a group of subjects, we may as- 
certain whether, in general, rapid learning is associated 
with rapid forgetting, with slow forgetting, or with 
neither. By the same device it is possible to determine 
whether the rate of reading is, and to what degree it is, 
correlated with depth of comprehension, with general 
mental ability, or with any other ability that can be 
measured. 
Doubtless the largest group study by means of scien- 
tific instruments under standardized procedure in the fielq 
of psychology was the measurement of the mental abilj-
-P-A-G-E-42
  THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 23 
ties of more than one and a half million men in the 
American Army during the Great War. From these data, 
correlations of mental ability with height, weight, na- 
tionality, schooling, vocation, army achievements, and 
other abilities have been or may be computed. In this 
way, much is learned concerning the organization of hu- 
man abilities and the factors, native or acquired, that 
influence them. : 
Psychology for Students of Education.—In a Psychol- 
ogy for students of education most -of the laws and 
principles which constitute General Psychology will be 
utilized,” Of the innumerable par'icular facts gathered 
in the several branches of the science, many of them—of 
use to the physician, the lawyer, the advertiser, the sales- 
man, ‘the musician, or other people—are of relatively 
little importance for the student of education. The 
following chapters will include those principles and many 
of the particular facts from psychology (and many bor- 
rowed from other sciences, as well) which seem to have 
the most important bearing on education. They will be 
presented in four main divisions: (1)_a description of the 
form and function s and mechanisms 
upon which human behavior depends; (2) a discussion of 
an’s equipment of unlearned (instinctiv S 
and capacities; @) the 
       cneral laws 8 of learning and their 
5 0 ope) 
    
other functions. ‘and (4 i facts an i- 
ples of individual differences, their significance, correl 
ons, and the devices by whi ‘y are measured. 
THe ReEAcTION HyPoTHEsIs 
Before undertaking any of these problems, a working 
hypothesis, quite fundamental to all of them, should be 
stated in abbreviated form to establish the general point
-P-A-G-E-43
24 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
of view that will be elaborated and substantiated through- 
out the book. The hypothesis is this: all forms of ‘human 
behayior, whether. muscular ‘activities, s such as those of 
grasping, striking, or speaking; glandular activities, such 
as the secretion of tears, saliva, or gastric juice; or mental 
“activities, such as percéiving, imaging, remembering, 
‘thinking, or reasoning, are reactions to definite 
_stimulation.. This may be called the reaction hypothesis. 
If we prick lightly with a pin an earthworm, a rat, or a 
dog, an infant or an unsuspecting adult, we will invariably 
secure a sudden and pronounced reaction from the organ-~ 
ism stimulated. The stimulus, here as in the following 
illustrations, is that force or action which produces a 
reaction. By a.reaction is meant some effect or change 
produced by the release or transformation of energy. In 
the case of the start on the event of the pin prick, the 
reaction is due to the sudden release of energy stored in 
the muscles. The amount of energy released or trans- 
formed may be very much greater than the amount 
transmitted to the organism by the stimulus. A reaction, 
as the term is here used, means more than the mere 
transmission of energy from one object to another, as 
when a moving billiard ball striking another throws the 
latter into action. The human body on receiving a bump 
does not topple over like a dummy; it makes an imme- 
diate adjustment or reaction to the stimulus. A tiny 
prick, occasioned by a very slight amount of force, may 
cause a reaction in which a very large amount of energy 
is consumed, or, more accurately, transformed. The body 
contains large amounts of energy stored in various react- -* 
ing mechanisms which, during the transformation of 
energy, are thrown into action as the result of appropriate 
stimulation. 
To the statement that muscular activity is initiated by
-P-A-G-E-44
¢ THE METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER 25 
some stimulus no one would object, because motor re- 
actions have been so thoroughly studied and because their 
characteristics can be relatively easily observed: Every- 
day activities, as well as the experiments of the physiolo- 
gist in his laboratory, afford samples. A pinch causes a 
jerk, a tickle causes a quiver or a sneeze, a sharp sound 
causes a turn of the head, and a strong light causes the 
narrowing of the pupil or a wink. In all these cases, the 
reaction is more extensive than these descriptions would 
indicate, If a strong light or a cinder strikes the eye, the 
muscles of the eyelid react, causing a wink; but careful 
observation would show other activities, such as the 
secretion of tears. The tears, like movements, are the 
results of a reaction; the reacting mechanism in this case 
being a gland—the lachrymal gland. 
The physiologist has for a long time been acquainted 
with glandular mechanisms whose activities, or better, re- 
activities, are fairly well understood although not so well 
as muscular activities. While glands may differ greatly 
from muscles in structure and in the products which their 
activities yield, they seem to be very similar in the way 
their activities are controlled. Normally, there must 
somewhere be a stimulus which throws the mechanism 
into action, and investigations indicate that normal 
muscle and gland activities are alike in the sense that they 
are forms of reactivity. 
When the human subject is stimulated by a pin prick, 
a bright color, or a sharp sound, characteristic muscular 
reactions and usually glandular reactions occur, but these 
are not all. He is aware, he is conscious of the pain, the 
color, or the sound. These subjective experiences are 
classified as mental activities, or states of consciousness. 
They are often popularly conceived as rather mysterious 
manifestations, as different from any other human ac-

tivities, as governed by quite different laws than muscular 
or glandular reactions. The facts seem to be, however, 
that all of our conscious experiences, our sensations, im- 
ages, ideas, or emotions, are really reactions occasioned 
by definite stimuli, and that mental activity is quite as 
uniformly law-abiding as muscular or glandular activity. 
Sensations, thoughts, and feelings do not appear without 
causes; they are definitely determined, susceptible to 
analysis. 
Most of the stimuli with which psychology is concerned 
are very complex; many forces, some from within and 
some from without, are acting on the organism at the 
same time. A complex group of stimuli is called a situa~- 
tion. If we are observing human reactions to a pin prick, 
to a patch of red or blue, to a sound of high or low pitch, 
or to an application of cold, stimulus would be the proper 
term. If we were examining human reactions to any 
combination of stimuli, such as the sight of the teacher, 
the sound of her voice—in general, to the events in the 
school room as a whole—we would use the term situation. 
A situation, then, is a combination or complex of par- 
ticular stimuli. These terms mean the same thing, ex- 
cept that situation implies greater complexity. 
The response is also very complex as a rule. When 
the teacher calls the name of a pupil in the classroom, 
careful examination would disclose a highly complex 
group of almost instantaneous reactions in the child’s 
organism, There would be, of course, awareness or per- 
ception of the name and other mental responses as well 
as muscular reactions of straightening up, coming to at- 
tention and contraction of muscles in all parts of the 
body. Striking changes in breathing, in heart action, im 
many other internal organs—prominent among them the 
glands—would be disclosed by the application of propey

instruments. The whole reaction is complex, involving 
all types of responding organs in all parts of the body. 
What distinguishes one reaction from another is the pat- 
tern; many of the mechanisms, particular muscles or 
glands, are involved in a great many different total 
reactions. 
Psychology undertakes to analyse the situations which 
the world affords and the reactions that human beings 
make to them. In addition, our task is to account for the 
one in terms of the other. Given a certain situation, how 
will the six-year-old child react to it? Observing the 
child’s reaction, what was the probable cause of it? How 
may we kill off those reactions that are undesirable? 
How may we modify where only modification is needed? 
How may we strengthen the desirable reactions? What, 
in_general_are the important facts concerning human 
~reactions as we find the: ions of life? 
This is, broadly stated. the question which psychology 
attempts to answer.

CHAPTER IT 
THE RECEIVING MECHANISMS 
To understand the operation of any mechanical device, 
an electric motor or a steam engine, we find it profitable 
to take the device to pieces in order to study the form of 
the individual parts. The work of the whole machine is 
better understood when the contribution of each of its 
parts is known. So in the study of the behavior of man 
we shall find it profitable to dissect the organism in order 
to further our acquaintance with the component parts. 
The mechanisms that we shall need to know may be 
considered conveniently in three groups: (1) the receiv- 
ing organs, such as the eye and ear; (2) the connecting 
organs, the elements of the nervous system; and (3) the 
reacting organs, of which the most familiar example is the 
muscle. ‘These organs are so arranged that the human 
mechanism is able to make many varieties of reactions to 
stimuli that originate within or without the body. 
Tue StimuLtus—Response UNIT 
First among these organs is the receiving apparatus, 
which may be called also the receptor, the sense organ, or 
the sensory apparatus. The receptor is highly sensitive 
to certain kinds of stimuli and when stimulated it initiates 
a nerve impulse. The sense organ always contains the 
end of a nerve which conducts the nerve impulse inward 
toward switching stations found in the spinal cord or 
brain stem, Here various connections with other nerves.

are made until the impulse finally issues into muscles or 
other mechanisms where the reactions occur. The order 
of events then is: (1) the stimulus affects the sense 
organ, which (2) initiates a nerve impulse, which (3) is 
conducted through the nervous system, and (4) finally 
issues into the responding mechanisms. The whole sys- 
tem is usually thought of as a unit, a reaction unit or a

stimulus-response unit. A very simple reaction unit in- 
cluding sense organ, connecting neurones and a muscle is 
shown in Figure 1. 
Our everyday experiences lead us to think of the sense 
organ in connection with the sensations which go with it. 
When we think of the ear we think of sounds; the eye 
goes with colors; the nose with odors; the skin is thought 
of as the seat of cold, warmth or pressure. In many cases, 
we think of the sensation as being in the sense organ,
-P-A-G-E-52
THE RECEIVING MECHANISMS ® 
pain in the skin, taste in the mouth, odor in the nose. 
As a matter of fact, the mere effect of the stimulus on the 
sense organ does not produce the sensation. All that the 
stimulus does is to arouse a nerve impulse. The sensa- 
tion, the sweet or the cold, is the result of a reaction set 
up in the brain by the nerve impulse. For the present we 
will be concerned only with the sense organs and the 
stimuli which influence them, leaving the sensations to 
a later chapter devoted to reactions. 
Each receptor represents a high degree of specialization. 
Each is specially sensitive to one kind of stimulus. The 
receptors in the eye are highly sensitive to light waves but 
not to sound waves, to which the ear is attuned. Neither 
of these stimuli has an effect upon other sense organs 
under ordinary conditions. Certain intense stimuli such 
as a blow, electrical shock, or a strong chemical may 
arouse almost any sense organ, but this is an unusual 
event and such stimuli are termed inadequate stimuli. 
‘The adequate stimulus is the one to which a sense organ 
. is specially adapted, the one which ordinarily affects it. 
Sense ORGANS IN THE SKIN, Muscizs aND INNER ORGANS 
The receptors are so minute and numerous that no one 
has been able to make even an approximately complete 
inventory of them. The skin probably contains between 
3,000,000 and 6,000,000 receptors. From 2,000,000 to 
4,000,000 of these are called “pain spots,” the simplest 
form of sense organs. They are responsive only to rather 
intense mechanical, chemical, or thermal forces, to severe 
pressure, blows, pricks, stings, heat, cold, acids, ete. There 
are probably at least half a million “touch spots” of many 
varieties in the skin. Some of these, lying close to ths; 
surface, are responsive to the slightest touch with a hair or

tuft or down; others, lying imbedded, are aroused only 
by rather heavy pressure, while many are scattered be- 
tween the two extremes. Another variety of receptors, 
commonly called “cold spots” and numbering at least a 
half million, are aroused by heat radiations of a degree

are responsive to temperature higher than that of the

probably—similar to those of the skin, are found in the 
inner linings of the body, the nasal membranes, the gul- 
let, stomach, and intestines, in the wall of the blood

vessels, in the ligaments and joint surfaces, in the fibres 
of the muscles, in the tissues of the lungs, diaphragm, 
glands, and other internal organs. The activities in- 
volved in muscular contraction and relaxation, the circu- 
lation of blood, breathing, digestion, glandular secretion, 
and other bodily activities, as well as the effect of chemical 
substances, bacteria, and internal temperature, may 
arouse some of these receptors. The importance of these 
receptors im daily life is very great. Each bodily process, 
such as breathing or moving the limbs, depends in part 
upon nerve impulses that are aroused by other bodily ac- 
tivities. . One act, by stimulating the sensory mechanisms 
in the vicinity, becomes the stimulus to a second, the 
second to a third, and soon. Thus, in writing your name, 
the act of making one letter leads to the next in the 
series. 
Sense Organs or Taste 
The tongue contains in addition. to organs sensitive to 
pressure, pain, warm and cold, other receptors, the “taste — 
buds,” so named because in ap- 
pearance they resemble a rose 
bud, the stem of which is the 
nerve. The taste buds, whose 
sensitive endings project from 
the sides of little trenches in the 
surface of the tongue, are respon- 
sive to certain chemicals con- 
tained in liquids which may fill , 2" un embedded an the 
the trenches. The organs of taste walls of a crevice in the

In the upper part of the nasal cavity, somewhat re- 
moved from the pathway of the air currents of ordinary 
breathing, is an area, about the size of a dime, which con-

tain gaseous particles. As yet there is no reliable infor- 
mation concerning the number and kinds of substances 
which are adequate stimuli for the organs of smell. While

the number is probably large, there are doubtless many 
gases and air-floating substances that are not smelled. 
The sense organs so far described are rather small in 
size and simple in structure comprising always the end- 
ings of a sensory nerve and, with few exceptions, some 
simple form of accessory apparatus. The accessory ap- 
paratus is not itself sensitive to the stimulus; it does not 
directly take part in initiating the nerve impulse, but 
serves to collect, modify or intensify the stimulus, and 
frequently, to protect the sensitive nerve endings from 
injury. The réle of the accessory apparatus is most con-

spond to sounds of high pitch affect others, according to 
one theory. According to another theory, a low pitch 
stimulates a very large number of the sensitive cells, 
whereas higher pitches stimulate a smaller number—the 
higher the pitch the smaller the number. There are 
other theories, no one of which has been universally 
accepted.

ments of the head. These organs consist of bony cavities 
filled with liquid, into which tiny sensitive hair cells 
project as reeds may project into a stream of water. 
Slight movements of the body disturb the liquids, whose 
changes of position are the immediate stimuli of hair-like 
sense organs. These receptors are involved in the acts of 
maintaining equilibrium when the body is moved in 
various ways, as by an elevator, a ship, or a street car, or 
when it moves by itself, as in walking, jumping, and 
stooping over. Any movement which involves the head, 
by its influence on these sense organs, activates nerve 
impulses that bring about appropriate bodily adjust- 
ments. The leaning inward by the child on the merry- 
go-round is a reaction mainly occasioned by the effect of 
the movement on these sense organs of the head. When 
they are injured, the maintenance of appropriate bodily 
positions under such circumstances is difficult or 
impossible. 
In these brief descriptions of the sense organs, it will 
be apparent that the accessory apparatus—which in the 
case of the two most complex mechanisms, the eye and 
the ear, is similar to familiar instruments of human con~ 
struction—serves merely to collect and modify the ade- 
quate stimulus. The really sensitive organs are very 
minute and, in appearance, fairly simple sensory cells, 
In them, the stimulus arouses the nerve impulse which is 
conducted into the central nervous system, there to be 
redirected to the organs of response. The stimulation of 
_ the sense organ is the first of the series of events which 
makes possible active adjustment to the environment. 
While the number of different forces to which humay,) 
receptors are sensitive is very large, there remain man.

air waves we do not hear, light waves we do not see,

we are responsive to many but not all of the happenings 
of the universe. Whether’ a more extensive sensory 
equipment would make possible a more satisfactory ad- 
justment to the conditions of life is an open question. 
But there is no doubt. that the loss of a single type of

THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 
Tue Marin Features or THE Nervous System 
A stimulus starts in the sense organ a nerve impulse 
which eventually occasions a responsg, Between the 
sense organs and the organs of response is a series of con- 
necting links called neurones, which constitute the nerv- 
ous system. First in order are the sensory neurones,’ 
distinguishable by the fact that they always originate in 
a sense ofgan and lead to the central nervous system, 
which is encased in the backbone and skull. From every 
receptor—from every tiny sense organ in the skin, in the 
muscles, internal organs, the eye, ear, tongue, ete—run 
the delicate thread-like fibres of the sensory neurones 
which enter the central system. 
The central nervous system comprises the brain, which 
occupies the large cavity in the skull; the mid-brain at 
the base of the skull; and the spinal cord, which fills a 
long slender hollow in the backbone. - Most of the sen- 
sory neurones from the receptors in the head enter the 
central system at the base of the skull, the mid-brain 
level. The sensory neurones from the remainder of the 
body enter the spinal cord at levels which correspond to 
the levels of the sense organs in the body; that is, those 
neurones from the lower limbs enter at the lowest por- 
tions of the-spinal cord, those from the upper limbs at 
the upper levels of the cord, and those from the trunk at 
intermediate levels.

muscles of, the head, arms, trunk, limbs, feet, and internal 
organs. The neurones which carry the nerve impulses 
from the sensory to the motor neurones are called central 
neurones or inter-connecting neurones. 
There are millions of neurones of each of the three

plex structure in nature. To count the neurones in the 
body, assuming a rate of two per second for eight ho 
a day, every day in the year, would require at leas: 
thousand years. 
STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE NEURONES : 
Although differing greatly i in size, shape, and complex- 
ity, neurones are alike in certain important respects. 
They always include a cell body and a number of fibres. 
The cell body is a small but complex structure essen- 
tial to the life and function of the neurone as a whole. 
The long, wire-like fibres which conduct the nerve im- 
pulses from one place to another are called azons. Thus, 
from a sense organ on the foot, an axon runs up through 
the leg and hip until it reaches the spinal cord just below
-P-A-G-E-63
48 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
the waist line. Usually a number of axons from adjacent 
sense organs are grouped together to form a nerve, as 
telephone wires are collected to make a cable. All of the 
central neurones contain axons which run from one part 
of the central system to another, sometimes for very 
short, sometimes for long, distances. The axons of the 
motor neurones are the long processes which connect the 
organs of response with the central system. 
The central neurones and the motor neurones contain 
a bushy group of relatively short fibrils called dendrites, 
whose function it is to pick up the nerve impulse from 
other neurones. The sensory neurone discharges its 
nerve impulse into the spinal cord by means of its axon, 
which is frayed out like the tasseled end of a cord on 
entering the central system. The dendrites of central 
neurones either.come into contact or into close proximity 
with the endings of the sensory axon from which they 
receive the nerve impulse. The dendrites usually con- 
verge at the cell body out of which the axon leads to the 
dendrites of other neurones. In the case of the motor 
neurones, the dendrites lead to the cell body from which 
the axon conducts the nerve impulse to the organs of 
response. The dendrites, then, receive, whereas the 
axons carry on and discharge the impulses. The sensory 
neurones do not receive from other neurones and conse- 
quently have no dendrites. They consist of the end 
organs in the sensory apparatus, the long axon, and, of 
course, the cell body which is usually near the discharging 
end of the neurone. 
The Synapse.—We must give speéial attention to the 
junction between two neurories, the place where the axon 
endings of one neurone reach the dendrites of another—a 
place called the synapse. The axon endings and the 
dendrites do not actialty unite or fuse; they simply come
-P-A-G-E-64
THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS ~ 49 
into contact or more or less close proximity. Each neu- 
rone is an independent unit, like two trees growing with 
branches close together or intertwined. Each tree-is in- 
dependent, touching but not joined to the other. The 
association of neurones at the synapse is of that charac- 
ter. The synapse, then, is not an organ or thing but 
merely a a place where axons and dendrites come into 0 con 
‘tact or are close together.

when conditions are favorable, always from axon to den-- 
drite, never in the opposite direction. Typically the end- - 
ings of the axon make contacts with the dendrites of 
many different neurones; that is, there are many synap- 
ses, but usually the nerve impulse follows but one or a 
few of the possible pathways. At some synapses great 
resistance is offered to the passage of the impulse; at 
others, relatively little. The impulse crosses only those 
synapses where the resistance is low. Thus the degrees of 
resistance offered at the synapses (or synaptic connec- 
tions) determine the course a particular nerve impulse 
will take and, in effect, what reactions will be made. 
What makes the resistance high at some synapses and

low at others is not known. It may be the spatial prox- 
imity of axon endings and dendrites, the inner composi- 
tion of the fibrils, or some other condition. 
The nerve impulses, because of conditions which must 
at present be described rather vaguely as differences in 
resistance at the synapses, do not become scattered and 
diffused throughout the whole central system and, as a 
consequence, throughout the whole bodily equipment of 
reacting mechanisms. On the contrary, they take par- 
ticular, limited courses and evoke responses by certain 
organs only. There are predetermined routes from par- 
ticular sense organs; routes determined by conditions at 
the synaptic connections. Some of these routes are 
short; some are round-about; some are inherited just as 
bones and eye-color are inherited; some are acquired 
through experience as wrinkles and table manners are 
acquired.

designated by the symbols S-R) consists of a sensory _ 
neurone, a central connection, a motor neurone, and a 
muscle. imulation of the sensory neurone results in a 
response by the muscle. Thus a slight prick of the skin 
on the finger or eyelid would cause a contraction of a 
local muscle. There is always a slight interval between 
stimulus and response, since some time—between 1/10 
and 2/10 of a second—is required for the nerve impulse 
to get under way, to complete the route to and from 
the central system, and finally to arouse the muscle, 
Such a simple and relatively prompt S-R unit is often 
called a reflex arc, the reaction. a reflex act « 
of the first level. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 51 
Usually the response is not so simple, but involves 
several organs of response. Each sensory neurone makes 
connections with many effectors by means of central neu- 
rones in the cord (or mid-brain) ; but of these one, two, or 
some other limited number of effectors, depending on the 
resistances encountered at the synapses, will be activated. 
A great many reflexes or reactions of the first level 
may be observed in an infant very shortly after birth. A 
prick on the infant’s foot elicits a quick jerk of the leg. 
Uncomfortable stimuli such as tickles, pricks, heat, or 
cold applied to other parts of the body provoke prompt 
avoiding reactions. An object striking the cornea causes

the wink reflex. Milk in the mouth causes a gush of 
saliva, a glandular reaction. Food on the back of the 
tongue causes a swallow; food in the stomach, gastric 
secretions and movements. A slight tickling of the nasal 
membrane causes a sneeze; an object on the palm of the 
hand, the grasping reflex. 
All of these reactions are relatively simple, involving 
only the most direct routes (reflex or first level routes) 
through the central system, and activating a relatively 
small number of reacting mechanisms. The reactions 
are very prompt and certain, and for this reason they 
may be fairly safely predicted. They are uniformly 
found in normal infants, and since they can be modified 
or inhibited only with greatest difficulty, they persist
-P-A-G-E-67
52 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
usually throughout life. For these reasons, tests of the 
first level reactions have become an important feature of 
the diagnosis of disorders of the nervous system. 
Routes and Reactions of the Second Level.—In addi- 
tion to traversing one or more of the innumerable path- 
ways of the first level, a nerve impulse started, for ex- 
ample, by a pin prick on the foot, may make its way to 
routes of a higher level which are contained in various 
parts of the central system, located at the base of the 
skull, continuous with the spinal cord, and covered by the 
masses of the brain proper. Much of the mid-brain,* 
which is subdivided into many parts, and the cerebellum Sr 
are devoted to connections of the second level. 
We observed that a painful stimulation of the toe 
causes a jerk of the foot, the simplest reaction. Perhaps 
also movements of the hips, trunk, or arms occur—reac- 
tions which probably involve only connections or routes 
of the first level. In some cases, especially if the stimu- 
lus is a strong one, the subject may turn the head, read- 
just his equilibrium, gasp or shout, and show internal 
changes such as an increased respiration and heart beat. 
These reactions involve more complicated connections— 
connections of the second level—which are located in the 
mid-brain and adjoining portions of the central system 
at the base of the skull. These routes are shown 
diagramatically in Figure 13. 
Reactions of the second level are said by many authori- 
ties to be instinctive or unlearned. Although there is 
some disagreement upon this point, it is certain that 
many of them are unlearned because they may be ob- 
tained in the newly born infant. If you hold the infant’s

nose, he first jerks slightly (first level) but later moves 
up his hands, pushes at the offending object, and later 
kicks, yells, squirms, and grows red with anger. Place 
the infant’s face in the pillow, he will attempt to draw 
the head back (first level probably) and shortly kick, 
move his arm, squirm, and perhaps succeed in turning 
around. Such reactions as turning the head to sounds or

moving arms up to things seen, or such complex reactions 
as the emotions of anger and fear, are usually second 
level reactions. 
Reactions of the second level, as contrasted with those 
of the first level, as a rule take place in a part of the body 
somewhat more distant from the point of stimulation,and 
they are somewhat more complex, and somewhat less 
rigid, less invariable and more readily modified. These 
distinctions are not sharp, however, and only the expert
-P-A-G-E-69
54 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
in neuro-anatomy is able to distinguish the levels in- 
volved in many reactions. 
The mid-brain connections form complex pathways be- 
tween different incoming and outgoing neurones, thus 
providing joint reactions to several stimuli received at 
once. Walking, stooping, running, jumping, and other 
complex bodily activities are responses made to many 
stimuli—from the organs of equilibrium in the skull, 
from the eyes, from the soles of the feet, muscular pres- 
sures in many parts of the body—which are pouring in 
at the same time. The mid-brain section provides for 
. combination and redirection of these numerous impulses 
into motor nerves that provide codrdinated and effective 
adjustment. Instead of many relatively independent 
and unrelated reactions, harmonious joint responses are 
thus secured, 
Routes and Reactions of the Third or Brain Level.— 
The larger portion of the brain consists of the two 
cerebral hemispheres, or the cerebra, which we have 
hitherto spoken of as the brain proper, as contrasted with 
the cerebellum and mid-brain. By means of a chain of 
neurones, a nerve impulse originating at any sense organ 
may finally reach the surface or cortex (literally the 
bark) of the brain, which consists of a tremendously 
complicated network of neurones. The portion first 
reached by the incoming impulses is called the sensory 
area. From the sensory areas connections are made with 
the motor area where exist almost limitless possibilities 
of connections with other central neurones, by means of 
which effectors in any part of the body may be reached. 
Reactions of the brain level may be of any degree of 
complexity, involving few or a great many effectors near 
to, or remote from, the point stimulated. We found the 
immediate withdrawal. of the toe or foot, when it is

jured spot or to examine it deliberately would involve 
neural connections in the cortex. All learned reactions, 
so far as we know, depend upon connections established 
in the brain or cortical level. It has been fairly well 
demonstrated, for example, that the ability to speak or
-P-A-G-E-71
56 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
write words, both of which reactions are clearly acquired, 
can be destroyed by removal or injury of certain portions 
of the cortex of the brain. 
We have illustrated roughly the possible distribution 
of nerve impulses. Just what effectors will be aroused 
depends upon the conditions at the synapses. Certain 
synapses in the course of an impulse from any particular 
receptor, will be found to be “open,” that is, to offer little 
resistance as a result of one’s inherited organization. In 
this way, the unlearned or instinctive reactions, which 
involve mainly, and probably wholly, connections in the 
spinal cord and mid-brain, are accounted for. The rela- 
tive openness of other synapses, particularly of those in 
the brain, is determined by the experience and learning of 
the individual. In fact, all learning consists in the modi- 
fication of synaptic connections by the passage of nerve 
impulses across them. The exact nature of the nerve 
impulse, now supposed to be an electro-chemical process, 
is not known, nor is the character of the changes in the 
synapses brought about by the passage of impulses. A. 
fundamental assumption of physiology, however, is that 
the transmission of nerve impulses does change the con- 
dition of the synapse in a way that makes subsequent 
passage more easy, certain and prompt. This change 
brought about by exercise is sometimes spoken of as 
lowering the resistance, causing greater openness or per- 
meability of the synapse or in other ways, all of which 
imply the same general hypothesis. 
Tue Oprration or THE Nervous System as A WHOLE 
Diffusion of Nerve Impulses.—The nervous system is 
so organized that an impulse, initiated at any receptor, 
may make its way to many, perhaps to all, reactors. If
-P-A-G-E-72
THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 5? 
all switches (synapses) were open, any stimulus might 
produce all the responses of which the body is capable. 
An approximation to such diffuse reaction can be shown 
in a simple experiment. If we prick the foot of a frog 
with a stiff hair or a pin, the usual response is a slight 
jerk of the leg. A second stimulation of the same spot 
will provoke a bigger response of the leg; a third stimu- 
lus may bring the other leg into action, and further 
stimuli will show a spreading of response until the whole 
organism, probably every muscle and gland, is involved. 
The diffusion of response is secured more readily when a 
bit of strychnine, which lowers the resistance of synapses, 
is injected before the experiment is begun. Such diffu- 
sion of nerve impulse is, of course, not usually the case 
and never occurs except under extraordinary conditions, 
but it proves the general statement that from each and 
every receptor, pathways may be made through the nerv- 
ous system to each and every organ of response. 
The Convergence of Nerve Impulses.—The organiza- 
tion of the nervous system which has been sketched pro- 
vides not only for the possibility of the passage of a 
nerve impulse from one receptor to almost all reactors, 
but for the convergence of impulses from many receptors 
upon one effector. That convergence, as well as diffu- 
sion, is provided for may be illustrated by an experiment 
upon a frog. A very gentle prod on the foot with a stiff 
hair may elicit no response, but when a slight sound is 
made simultaneously, the foot may jerk as it would for 
a more intense stimulation with the hair. If these two 
stimuli prove insufficient, a small flash of light added to 
the combination may cause the foot to jerk. The nerve 
impulses aroused in different parts of the body seem to 
have come: together somehow and combined their energy 
on the muscle in the foot. A light, a sound, and a prick
-P-A-G-E-73
58 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
on the foot are about as unrelated as any three stimuli 
could be, and if the impulses from these can be converged 
on the same effectors, it is probable that nerve impulses ~ 
from any or all receptors may find their way to any par- 
  Ficurs 15. Connections of different levels by means of which muscle

ticular effector. Indeed, this would follow as a necessary 
corollary of the fact of diffusion of impulses previously 
illustrated, i.e., the fact that from one receptor impulses 
may reach any given effector. 
The mechanism of convergence is illustrated in Figure 
15. Suppose muscle M to be in the foot. It may be
-P-A-G-E-74
THE CONNECTING MECHANISMS 59 
aroused by a stimulus, such as a pin prick which affects 
sense organ A in the vicinity of the muscle. The reaction 
would be a reflex. Impulses received from C, the ear, 
or D, the eye, by means of connections in the mid-brain- 
level may also discharge into M. In everyday experience 
* this occurs in many of our bodily adjustments brought 
about by things seen, heard, or smelled. When we are 
startled by sudden sounds, when we shift our equilibrium 
on observing an obstacle, or halt at a strong odor, the 
mid-brain level is involved. In most of our complex 
motor adjustments, connections in the cerebellum (il- 
lustrated by E) are also utilized. F represents a neurone 
originating in the motor cortex of the brain, and con- 
nected by motor neurones with the muscle M. Impulses 
from various parts of the brain (indicated by several 
neurones) may reach F and eventually discharge into the 
muscle M. Thus the response of M as part of any learned 
act, such as dancing, putting on a shoe, ete., is accounted 
for as well as what is usually called voluntary control— 
the arousal! of M by an “act of will.” Voluntary action is 
acquired action, not to be sharply distinguished from 
learned reactions in general. A particular muscle, then, 
may be activated by impulses which come from many 
sources directly through connections in the spinal level, 
from other sources through connections of the mid-brain 
level, and from still other sources through the cortical 
level. 
Facilitation.—Since each muscle has fairly close con- 
nections with a number of sense organs, the stimulation 
of two connected receptors will produce a more prompt 
and vigorous response than the stimulation of one; three 
will ‘be more effective than two; and so on. The energy 
from one impulse adds something to the effectiveness of 
the energy of others activated at the same time. This is.
-P-A-G-E-75
60 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
the phenomenon of facilitation. The neurologist is able 
to select at different points on the body the several sen- 
sory endings from which impulses lead rather directly to 
a particular effector; that is, he knows where to apply 
stimulation to secure relatively pronounced facilitation. 
The possibilities of facilitation are shown in Figure 15, — 
and everyday life affords true, even if less precise, ex- 
amples. If one is frightened while walking alone at 
night, one tends to speed up a little on slight stimuli; a 
crackle, the chirp of a night bird, or the sudden percep- 
tion of a dark object may stir us to flight: The sight of 
food on the table, added to the odors and sounds from 
the kitchen, makes our hunger more acute. We shout at 
the horse, in addition to other stimulation, to get the 
greatest action. Thus, when two or more stimuli, each 
having a similar influence on a common effector, are 
given at once, each facilitates the others with the result 
that the response is more certain, prompt, and vigorous. 
Inhibition. —Ordinarily a resting muscle is in a state of 
partial contraction or tonus, as it is called; and so far, we 
have considered only the influence of one or more stimuli 
in producing a greater contraction or a positive response. 
An equally important function of a stimulus is to arouse 
nerve impulses that depress the partial contraction, or 
tonus, or suppress it altogether. _The application of cer-° 
tain chemicals, such as salt, to the cut surface of the 
spinal cord, will cause a relaxation of certain muscles” 
which are then aroused to activity only by very strong 
stimulation, until the salt has been washed away. This 
is the phenomenon of inhibition. The usual jerk of the 
leg when an animal’s toe is pinched may be depressed or 
inhibited by stimulating, at the same time, an appropri- 
ate spot on the other leg. A familiar sample of inhibition 
is the suppression of a sneeze by pressure on the upper

lip. Inhibition in the strict. sense. is more~than “mere 
blocking or prevention of a response; it involves a-pesi- 
_ tive depression or reduction of the activity or tonus’ pre- 
“viously. existing in the effector. There are different de- 
_ Brees of inhibition as there are of contraction, and the 
™ former is as much a reaction as the latter. 
The nature of the nerve mechanisms upon which in- 
hibition depends is not well known. In the case of the 
heart, at least, there are distinct sets of inhibitory neu- - 
rones, but that all muscles and glands possess one set of 
neurones for stimulation and another for inhibition has 
not been demonstrated. Some authorities hold that the 
same neurones may conduct two kinds of impulses, one 
producing contraction, the other inhibition. However 
this may be, it is recognized that practically all effectors 
may be inhibited as well as stimulated. Combination of 
facilitations and inhibitions adds greatly to the flexibility 
of bodily reaction; it provides for a wider variety of 
adjustments. 
Reciprocal Innervation.—Most. bodily reactions in- 
volve both stimulation and inhibition so balanced as to 
yield the smoothest activity. For example, when the 
forearm is raised from the elbow one set of muscles, the 
biceps, contracts, whereas another set, the triceps, whose 
“contraction would straighten out the arm, is inhibited 
and so is relaxed. If the biceps are stimulated arti- 
ficially, by applying an electric current to their motor 
nerves, the triceps are innervated to inhibition. This 
phenomenon is called reciprocal innervation. Every- 
where in the body muscles are arranged in antagonistic 
groups. Bending forward is antagonistic to bending 
backward; turning the head to the right to turning the 
head to the left; opening the hand to closing the hand; 
pulling to pushing; swallowing. to spitting; and in the
-P-A-G-E-77
62 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
case of heart, lungs, stomach and glands, increased ac- 
tivity is antagonistic to decreased activity. All complex 
movements, such as writing, dancing, boxing, involve 
reciprocal innervations in great complexity. When 
thrown into action, each muscle by means of its sensory 
neurones innervates other muscles, some to increased ac- 
tivity, others to diminished activity or complete inhibi- 
tion. The result of such innervations is greater smooth- 
ness, codrdination, and flexibility. 
SumMMaRY 
The nervous system is composed of millions of neu- 
rones which carry nerve impulses from receptors located 
in all parts of the bady to the central system, which com- 
prises the brain, mid-brain and spinal cord, The’ fune- 
tion of the central system is to switch the nerve impulses 
into certain motor neurones, running to reactors which 
are stimulated into greater activity, or depressed into 
less or no activity according to the character of the nerve 
impulse (or possibly of the nerve fibres). Hach receptor 
may send a nerve impulse to many, perhaps to all re- 
actors, and each reactor may be stimulated or inhibited 
by many, perhaps by all receptors. What course the +m 
pulse will take depends upon the resistance offered b: 
synapses. The various pathways may be groupe

CHAPTER IV 
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 
In Chapter III, the muscle was used as typical of the 
reacting mechanisms. So far as the principles of the 
reaction hypothesis—the assumption that all behavior 
may be accounted for in terms of reactions to stimuli—is 
concerned, muscular activity provides the clearest illus- 
tration. But we have emotions, feelings, sensations, 
memories, ideas, and other complex experiences that 
must now be accounted for. These will be better under- 
stood after a survey of the mechanisms of response, which 
will be considered in the following order: 
I. Muscles whose reactions produce movements 
1. Striped or striated muscles 
2. Smooth muscles 
II. Glands, whose reactions produce chemical 
secretions. 
1. Duet glands, such as the salivary gland 
2. Ductless glands, such as the adrenal gland 
III. Cortical neurones whose activity is essential to 
states of consciousness, such as sensations and 
images. 
Muscizes 
Striped Muscles.—The striped or skeletal muscles 
constitute a large part of our body. They vary tre- 
mendously in size, from large ones on the shoulders or in 
the legs to very small ones attached to the eyes or the 
65

vocal organs. Each muscle consists of a large number 
of thread-like cells, the muscle fibres, which lie parallel 
to each other. Each fibre is supplied with the discharg- 
ing end of a motor neurone. It is here that the nerve 
impulse, coming from the spinal cord, starts the contrac- 
tion or relaxation (inhibition). 
The vigor of a muscular reaction depends partly upon 
the strength of the stimulus. A strong pin prick, elec- 
tric shock, or sound will cause a more pronounced reac: 
tion than a less intense stimulus of the same type. The 
single or “simple” muscle contractions vary in speed from 
muscle to muscle and from person to person. Measured 
by a simple test such as tapping with a pencil, voluntary 
contractions may vary from four or five to eight or nine 
per second over a period of fifteen seconds or more. A 
rate less than four per second is abnormally slow and 
sometimes is symptomatic of disease. 
When one holds a pen, stands or sits in one position, 
holds the arms in place as in typing, keeps the eyes on a 
book as in reading, many museles are persistently in con- 
traction while others are persistently in inhibition. The 
continuous contraction or inhibition is produced by a 
series of intermittent nerve impulses, twenty or more per 
second, whose rapidity is too great to permit a return to 
the state of tonus between stimuli. The slowing of the 
rate of discharge in old age causes the familiar shaking 
which occurs when an object is held. 
Smooth Muscles.—The smooth muscles are found 
chiefly in the visceral organs; in the walls of the gullet, 
the stomach, the small and large intestines, in the genital 
and urinary organs, the bronchi and diaphragm, in the 
walls of veins and arteries, attached to hairs, and in 
various glands. In structure the smooth muscles differ 
considerably from the striped: instead of threads the
-P-A-G-E-82
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 67 
elements are tapering spindles which unite to form a 
tissue, such as the wall of the stomach. 
The smooth muscle spindles contain the endings of 
neurones that are somewhat different from those which 
supply the striped muscles. We need not be concerned 
with the minute differences, and need only note that 
certain motor neurones from the spinal cord lead to 
“ganglia” (i.e., groups of 
neural connections out- 
side of the spinal cord) 
‘ where they are connected 
by means of synapses 
with other neurones 
which run on to the ,ciuon 
smooth muscles. The ‘ter ~ ny 
neurones connecting the 
ganglia and the smooth Z STRIPED 
muscles form part of 
what is called the au- 
tonomic nervous system. oo,

namely, to conduct the nerve impulse to the organs of

The activity of the smooth muscles is like that of the 
striated muscles except that it is slower. Smooth muscles 
are sluggish in reaching the maximum of a contraction 
and slow in relaxing. They will maintain different de- 
grees of tonus for very long periods of time. Most SPINAL CORD

smooth muscles are very susceptible to the stimulating 
or inhibiting effect of certain chemicals, many varieties 
of which, developed in the body by glands, reach the 
“ganglia” as well as the muscle through the circulating 
blood. The paralysis of the iris of the eye (a smooth 
muscle) caused by applying atropin to the surface or in- 
jecting it into the circulation is probably the most 
familiar example of such effects. 
Tur GLANDS 
Until recently, study of the glandular mechanisms has 
been pursued almost solely by those interested in the 
digestion and assimilation of food, in storage and growth, 
and in the elimination of waste materials. Recent re- 
search, although not as yet extensive, has shown that 
glandular functions play an important rdle in behavior. 
Especially important is their relation to emotions, such 
as fear, anger, and joy; to temperamental and volitional 
traits, such as energy, vivaciousness, and ambitiousness, 
and even in the field of thinking and reasoning their 
influence is probably considerable. 
The most familiar duct glands are the tear glands, the 
sweat and oil glands of the skin, the salivary glands in 
the mouth, the digestive glands of the stomach, the in- 
testinal canals, the liver and kidneys. Each of these, by 
means of a duct or tube, pours its secretion on the sur- 
face of the body or into some body cavity. So far as is 
known, all of the duct glands are innervated by neurones 
of the autonomic system as are the smooth muscles, 
The ductless glands are sometimes called the endocrine 
glands or the glands of internal secretion. They differ 
from the duct glands in that they have no external out- 
let. They produce complex chemical compounds which 
are absorbed by the blood filtering through them and
-P-A-G-E-84
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 69 
thus are carried throughout the body. The endocrine 
glands, like smooth muscles and duct glands, are inner- 
vated by the autonomic system. We can give but a brief 
and fragmentary description of a few of the internal 
glands and their influences on behavior. 
The Thyroid Gland.—The thyroid gland consists of 
two maroon colored masses connected by a strip of tissue 
on each side of the windpipe, close to the larynx. Every~ 
one knows the position of this gland because of its great 
enlargement in the disease, goitre. The most important 
secretion of the thyroid is thyroxin, of which the most 
potent element is iodine. ~ 
When the thyroid becomes over-active, or when thy- 
roxin is injected into the circulation or taken into the 
stomach, the effects, while slow in appearing, are very 
pronounced, The organism speeds up, is excitable and 
over-reacts. The pulse becomes rapid, the temperature 
goes above normal, and the skin is flushed and moist from 
perspitation. The individual is alert, irritable, unable to 
relax or sleep perfectly. Emotions, as fear, anger, ex- 
citable joy, are easily aroused. If the over-supply of 
thyroxin is continued, the individual loses weight no 
matter how much he eats; certain vital chemical ‘activi- 
ties (metabolism) go on at such a pace that they exhaust 
the reserve stores of the body. 
All of these effects are symptoms of the disease, ez- 
ophthalmic goitre, which is associated with hyper-thy- 
roidism, that is, too much thyroid. Another disease, 
myxoedema, is a chronic condition of hypo-thyroidism, 
that is, insufficient thyroid secretion. In this disorder, 
the symptoms are quite the reverse. All of the vital 
activities slow up; bodily movements are slow and 
clumsy; the temperament becomes sluggish, indifferent, 
insensitive, dull.
-P-A-G-E-85
70 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
The Parathyroid Glands.—The parathyroids are four 
in number, about the size and shape of grains of wheat, 
located two on each side of the windpipe and imbedded in 
the thyroids. The secretion of these glands has not been 
isolated and its specific effect is not very well known. 
When they are removed in experiments upon animals, 
the subject becomes extraordinarily excitable. At the 
slightest sound or touch it will jump or even:be thrown 
into convulsions. Certain human beings suffering from 
extreme depression, nervousness, restlessness, insomnia, 
and tremors, have been found to have defective or dis- 
eased parathyroids. At the present time it is believed 
that these glands have an important réle in the regula- 
tion of the assimilation of lime, which in addition to 
being an essential element of the bones, teeth, arid blood, 
is required for the health of nerves. Removal, disease, 
or insufficiency of the parathyroids, by eliminating or de- 
creasing the intake of lime, and perhaps in other ways, 
produces marked disturbances of behavior. 
The Pituitary Gland.—The pituitary gland, a small 
organ about the size of a pea, is situated in a well ‘pro- 
tected position at the base of the brain. It is really a 
double organ giving two secretions, each bringing about a 
variety of effects. Over-activity of one of the pituitary 
secretions causes an abnormal growth of the skeleton. 
The giants which we see at the circus are probable vic- 
tims of an over-active pituitary function. Insufficient 
secretion of one or both parts of the pituitary is said to be 
the cause of retardation of bodily growth in the case of 
certain types of dwarfs. 
The pituitary secretions influence the tone of smooth 
muscles and the activity of various functions concerned 
in the transformation of materials into form available for 
bodily work. For example, the glycogen in the liver is
-P-A-G-E-86
THE REACTING MECHANISMS ‘71 
more rapidly converted into blood sugar—the material 
burned in muscular action—when the pituitary is active. 
The pituitary functions appear to be influential in de- 
termining fatigability; inability to sustain effort being 
one of the frequent complaints of those whose pituitary 
secretions are insufficient. 
The Adrenal Glands.—Since the réle of the adrenal 
glands will be rather fully described in the chapter on 
emotions, it will not be given here. Descriptions of other 
glands will be found in references given at the end of 
the chapter. 
The Glands in General—Our knowledge of the func- 
tions of the glandular mechanisms is as yet very inade- 
quate. They form a complex system. A change in the 
amount of secretion of one affects many or all of the 
others. The details of the inter-relations have not been 
ascertained, but the system of reciprocal innervations in- 
volving both facilitation and inhibition, which we ob- 
served in the case of muscles, seems to have a parallel 
here. The secretions of the adrenal and the thyroid have 
_ certain common functions, as well as some different, al- 
most antagonistic ones. \The influence of adrenal secre- 
tion on the liver’s control of sugar is quite the reverse of 
the influence of secretions from the pancreas. The whole 
complex of chemical reactions doubtless provides for 
many subtle adjustments, whose influences on human be- 
havior we are just beginning to appreciate. 
Tue CEREBRAL Cortex AND ITs FUNCTIONS 
A description of muscular and glandular activities does 
not exhaust the forms of behavior that constitute our 
everyday experience. Most of us would rate high, in 
terms of importance, our sensations, thoughts and feel-
-P-A-G-E-87
72; PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION - 
ings, that is, our conscious or mental experiences. There 
are two problems before us in seeking an understanding 
of mental activity: (1) upon what bodily organs do our 
states of consciousness, sensations, images, memories, etc., 
depend, and (2) what are the characteristics, varieties 
and functions of these mental states? 
The Physical Basis of Consciousness——We must 
admit at the outset that if we stand by scientific proof, 
we cannot say with certainty that the activity of any 
organ produces a sensation or some other state of con- 
sciousness in the same manner that a muscle produces a 
movement or a gland produces a secretion. All that we 
can say is that the activity of certain organs seems to be 
a necessary condition of conscious experience. These 
organs are certain neurones located mainly or wholly in 
the cortex or outer layer of the brain. The assumption is 
that the nerve impulse, initiated at the sense organ, is 
relayed through the cord and the mid-brain by axons 
_ leading to the sensory area in the cortex of the brain. 
When these cortical neurones are thrown into action by 
the nerve impulse, we have the condition under which 
consciousness occurs. The cortex seems to be the imme- 
diate physical basis, or, if you wish, the organ of 
consciousness. 
Several lines of evidence favor the hypothesis that 
activity of the neurones in the cortex of the brain is the 
basis of conscious experience. The fact that a blow on 
the head or the stoppage of the flow of blood to the brain 
results in loss of consciousness is suggestive but not con- . 
clusive evidence. More convincing proof has been secured 
by observation of the effects of partial loss or destruction 
of the cortex by injuries, operations or disease. The re- 
moval of certain areas of the cortex invariably results in 
the loss of certain kinds of consciousness, The removal
-P-A-G-E-88
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 73 
of one area results in the loss of visual sensations—the 
individual is unable to see even when the eye and the 
sensory nerves are unimpaired. When another area is re- 
moved, the individual is unable to become aware of (con- 
scious of) sounds although the ear and the sensory neu- 
rones are uninjured. The destruction of other areas 
abolishes sensations of pain, cold, hot, pressure, taste or 
smell. Widespread cortical removal results in losses of 
images, memories and other conscious experiences even 
though all other bodily organs—the sense organs, the cord 
and mid-brain, motor nerves, muscles and glands—are 
left intact. 
Science is unable to explain the relation between ac- 
tivity of the cortex and consciousness. The immediate 
stimulus is the nerve impulse. When it traverses certain 
cortical neurones, a sensation or some other conscious 
state occurs, but just how or why is quite unknown. The 
circumstances, to use a rough analogy, are similar to those 
attending the production of light in an electric bulb. 
The electric current flows along the wire with no observ- 
able effect but, when it reaches the filament of the light 
bulb, there results a brilliant glare. No one knows, as a 
matter of fact, what electricity is nor precisely why it 
- should, when circulating through the filament, produce 
light, rather than a sound, an odor or some other result. 
Of course, a certain number of facts are known concerning 
the properties and effects of the electric current, which . 
provides an approximation to the explanation of the oc- 
currence of light, but the explanation is not complete or 
ultimate. Less is known concerning the properties of 
nerve impulses and their effects on the neurones of the 
cortex, but the evidence nevertheless is such, that we must 
assume that nerve impulses flowing through certain neu- 
rones are the necessary conditions of consciousness even if
-P-A-G-E-89
74 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
a complete or ultimate explanation of how or why is not 
available. 
Locatization oF Conscious FuNcTIONs 
To some extent, the particular areas of the brain whose 
neurones are most intimately concerned with definite con- 
scious states are known, and study of them assists some- 
what in classifying and understanding conscious behavior. 
Main Features of the Cortex.—The brain comprises 
the cerebral hemispheres, or the two cerebra (the singular 
term is cerebrum). The cerebra include the whole con- 
tent of the skull except the mid-brain with its append- 
ages. The dividing line between the cerebra is a deep 
central cleft. In general size and appearance, the cerebra 
differ from man to man about as faces do; the main 
features can easily be made out but minor differences are 
always found. Figure 17 gives pictures of the surface. 
The neurologists have the brain surface very carefully - 
divided up, like a map, into various areas, using many of 
the depressions as boundary lines. There are four large 
areas: the Frontal Lobe in the forehead, the Temporal 
Lobe at each temple, the Occipital Lobe at the back and 
the Parietal Lobe on top; and two fissures, the Central 
Fissure which divides the front from the hind part, and 
the Fissure of Sylvius which begins at the temple and, 
running toward the rear, marks off the Temporal Lobe. 
The nerve impulses initiated in the sense organs in 
various parts of the body are relayed by central neurones 
until they arrive at what may be called the primary sen- 
sory areas in the cortex. The primary sensory areas con- 
nected with the important sense organs are fairly defi- 
nitely known. The impulses coming in from the eye are 
relayed to the portion of the cortex in the posterior part

of the brain, i.e., in the Occipital Lobe. This area may be 
called the primary visual area. No other part of the 
cortex receives nerve impulses directly from the visual 
receptors. The impulses from the ear are conducted by 
chains of neurones to the area of the cortex in the Tem- 
poral Lobe. This may be called the primary auditory 
area. The organs of taste are connected with the pri- 
mary gustatory or taste area which is near the bottom of 
the cleft between the two cerebra. In the same region is 
the primary olfactory area which receives the impulses 
from the sense organs of smell. The sense organs of the 
skin and, to some extent, those of the muscles, ligaments 
and joints, send impulses which reach the cortex in a 
narrow area which runs from the top of the brain down 
the posterior side of the Central Fissure, ending at the 
Fissure of Sylvius. This strip may be called the primary 
bodily-sense area. The primary cortical areas of other 
sense organs—such as those of the semi-circular canal 
and of many internal organs—are not known. 
There are two important facts which we should know 
concerning the several primary sensory areas: first, they 
contain the neurones whose activity is primarily and es- 
sentially correlated with the conscious response, the 
sensation; and second, they are profusely connected, by 
neurones both in and under the cortex, with many other 
parts of the brain. 
The Effects of Removal of Parts of the Cortex.— 
The evidence that the primary sensory area of the cortex 
is essential to sensation is twofold. Destruction of this 
area results in the loss of sensations, whereas injury of 
other areas, such as those immediately surrounding the 
primary centers, does not eliminate sensations. Destruc- 
tion of the total primary visual area results in blindness ; 
destruction of part of the area results in partial blindness,
-P-A-G-E-92
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 7 
Whenever this area is wholly or partly removed the re- 
sult is a loss of visual sensations, in whole or part. When 
the primary visual area is uninjured but the area sur- 
rounding it is destroyed, the result is not blindness, but 
inability to recognize or comprehend the object which 
provides the visual stimulus. The subject is aware of 
(conscious of) a patch of color of a certain size but he 
cannot recognize it as an orange; he has no idea what the 
stimulating object is. One patient called a clothes-brush 
a pair of spectacles, an umbrella a plant with flowers, 
an apple a portrait of a lady. Complete destruction of 
the outlying parts would result also in “word blindness,” 
a condition in which the subject really sees (is conscious 
of) the word, but cannot interpret it. The symbol has 
no More meaning than a Chinese character to an Ameri- 
can child. The patient might also be unable to recog- 
nize colors, his friends, his house, and other objects, 
although seeing them. The visual stimulus arouses but 
one conscious response, the sensation. No. other con- 
scious reactions—percepts, images, memories, thoughts— 
occur. 
Removal of the cortex surrounding the primary audi- 
tory area results in similar losses of conscious reactions. 
The subject is aware of sounds but unable to interpret or 
comprehend them, unable to tell whether they are sounds 
of the human voice, a piano or a passing automobile. Re- 
moval of small portions of the surrounding areas may 
result in inability to recognize tunes, or to understand 
spoken words, or in some other limited loss of compre- 
hension without any defect of the primary capacity to 
hear sounds. 
Removal of the regions surrounding other primary 
sensory areas results in similar disturbances. The pa- 
tient may be able to smell, taste, feel with the hand, ‘but
-P-A-G-E-93
78 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
no conscious reactions beyond the bare sensation are 
experienced. 
Sensations.—Sensations consequently must be a par- 
ticular kind of conscious reaction distinguishable from 
other mental activities which constitute recognition or 
perception of objects, recollection of, or ideas about ob- 
jects. Sensations appear to be the first conscious reac- 
tions occasioned by external stimulation, since they have 
as their “seat” the areas first reached by the incoming 
nerve impulse. It is important to realize that they are 
reactions—to see, hear, taste, smell, or experience hot, 
cold, pressure or pain is to react to a stimulus. Sensa- 
tions do not occur spontaneously without a cause. They 
are not things or processes within us which are brought 
into prominence by some type of self-activity or by some 
mysterious power of the “mind.” They are, like move- 
ments, the results of activity occasioned by definite 
stimuli. 
Other Conscious Reactions.—The sensation is the first 
conscious reaction, shortly followed by others. Hach 
primary sensory area is profusely connected with other 
parts of the brain, thus making it possible for nerve im- 
pulses to be switched off in almost any particular direc- 
tion, to reach almost any other region of the cortex, or to 
be distributed at once along many different routes. It is 
probable that removal of the areas surrounding the pri- 
mary sensory centers cuts off all or most of these connec- 
tions with other parts of the brain, thus eliminating all 
reactions, conscious or otherwise, which are dependent on 
more remote brain areas. The cases just mentioned, in 
which removal of the region immediately surrounding the 
primary sensory area resulted in the elimination of recog. 
nition or perception of the stimulating object, do not nee.. 
essarily prove that the area removed was the only one’
-P-A-G-E-94
  THE REACTING MECHANISMS 79 
involved in comprehension. The pathways which run 
through these areas are essential but not necessarily suffi- 
cient. To destroy them may result. merely in cutting 
some of the links in a continuous chain of neurones, all 
of which may be involved in a complex mental response. 
The localizations of the conscious activities that follow 
sensations might be determined by starting at some re- 
  Fiourr 19. Bundles of neurones connecting the various parts of the brain, The part marked Corpus Callosum represents huge bundles of neurones interconnecting the two cerebral hemispheres. (From Woodworth’s Psychology, after Starr.) 
mote area, removing portion after portion, working in the 
direction of the primary sensory areas, determining after 
the removal of each part, what conscious reactions re- 
mained and what ones were abolished. This type of in- 
vestigation, to be of value, would have to utilize human 
subjects, an enterprise which is obviously impossible. 
Such data as are available have been secured by studies 
of individuals who have lost portions of the brain as the
-P-A-G-E-95
80 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
result of surgical operations, accident, or disease. Such 
cases have been too few in number and too varied in kind 
to yield very significant evidence, but they indicate, for 
such conscious reactions as percepts, recognitions, mem- 
ories, imaginations and ideas, dependence not upon 
sharply defined areas but upon: tracts penetrating 
variously all parts of the brain. 
The Complexity of Brain Action during Thinking.— 
The probable complexity and extensity of brain activity 
may be illustrated by an adult’s reactions to the printed 
word apple. The stimulus, a group of light waves, strikes 
the retina of the eye activating a nerve impulse which, on 
reaching the primary visual area, arouses certain neurones 
whose activity is somehow correlated with a sensation. 
The individual then sees a series of little black marks on 
a white ground. The sensation is merely this awareness 
of black and white. But almost instantly, at an interval 
too-brief to be appreciated, the subject comprehends, or 
is aware of, the meaning of the word. He at once thinks 
of appleness, which means probably a fleeting conscious- 
ness of a round, colored, hard, odorous, edible object. 
Probably this really complex consciousness involves cer- 
tain neurones running off toward the olfactory area, 
others toward the gustatory area, others toward the skin 
or body sense area, and others to intermediate regions. 
The perception of the word would thus involve an exten- 
sive, complex pattern of neurones.. Each percept in- 
volves neurones in many brain areas. Different percepts 
depend upon the same general areas, but the patterns of 
particular neurones concerned are as numerous as the 
percepts themselves. 
The act of perception is usually prompt. It is the 
almost instantaneous awareness or recognition of the 
stimulating object or event. In the present illustration,
-P-A-G-E-96
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 81 
on seeing the word “apple,” one at once becomes aware of 
its significance, and the percept may be promptly fol- 
lowed by a series of thoughts or ideas. One may think of 
the kind of tree on which the fruit grows, of the appear- 
ance and number of such trees in an orchard familiar to 
childhood, and then of related childhood events. The 
‘percept leads to an idea, which leads to another idea, and 
so on. The whole series may in one case constitute a 
reverie, in another, imagination, and in another, purpose- 
ful thinking. In any case, the continuity, despite the 
rapidity with which thoughts succeed each other, is the 
significant matter for which a neural basis should be 
suggested. 
Each thought in the series is paralleled by the activity 
of a complex pattern of cortical neurones which is not ~ 
sharply localized, but widespread. The activity of one 
group of neurones, itself a reaction, leads to activity of 
another group, and so on. Thus each brain reaction be- 
comes the stimulus which activates another brain reaction 
in somewhat the same manner as, in writing, the muscular 
acts made in one moment become the stimuli which occa- 
sion the acts of the next moment. And just as the series 
of acts in writing constitute a complex, rapid and ap- 
parently smooth continuity, so a train of associated ideas 
seems more like a flowing stream than like a series of 
distinct reactions. Actually, however, the stream of 
thought corresponds to a series of neural reactions, each 
caused by another preceding reaction, one following 
another with great rapidity. 
One conscious reaction may lead to another associated 
conscious reaction, but this is not all. A conscious re- 
sponse may lead to muscular and glandular reactions as 
well. It is typical of the human individual to act after 
having perceived the situation or after having thought
-P-A-G-E-97
82 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
about the situation perceived. Conscious activity is the 
antecedent of much of human activity, a fact that will 
appear more clearly after a consideration of the motor 
area, of the brain and its relation to the areas primarily 
involved in conscious life. 
Locauization oF Moror Functions 
The Frontal Lobe of the brain, which occupies the 
whole region in front of the Central Fissure and above 
the Fissure of Sylvius, is mainly motor in function, in ‘ 
the sense that therein are the neurones most immediately — 
concerned in directing nerve impulses downward through 
the mid-brain and spinal cord to issue into muscles and 
glands. In a Jong narrow strip of cortex immediately in 
front of the Central Wissure, running from the top down- 
ward to either temple, areé contained the e: the 
es which Jead to the organs of response. 
This ares which we ma the motor area, is compar- 
lead: the kh way out cing neurones issue. Destruction of the primary 
sensory areas eliminates consciousness and all action 
which follows it, whereas destruction of the motor area 
leaves consciousness intact but eliminates the motor re- 
sponse. Thus, destruction of the moter area would 
render the patient incapable of speaking a word which 
he can see and recognize, of running his typewriter, of 
properly handling a knife and fork, of catching a football, 
and of writing, even when he is capable of perceiving and 
thinking about these objects and the situations in which 
they are encountered. Complete destruction of the motor 
area, by cutting off the motor connections between the      
    
     
-P-A-G-E-98
i THE REACTING MECHANISMS 83 
brain and the organs of response, would eliminate ac- 
quired acts and what is usually called voluntary action, 
by which are meant responses whose immediate anteced-_ 
ent is conscious activity. 
Destruction of the motor area does not result in com- 
plete paralysis, since the reactions of the spinal level, the _ 
reflexes, and those of the mid-brain level, the more enm- 
plex unlearned reactions, can still be made w: 
stimuli are provided. The individual can voce 
swallow, walk, jerk away from pricks and bur 
cannot speak English, sing an old song, handl: 
and perform other learned or voluntary acts. 
Localization in the motor area, as in the pr.) _ | | 
sory areas, is fairly exact. The top portion of the brain 
area is connected with the muscles in the lower limbs, the 
bottom portion with muscles of the upper limbs and head 
and throughout, the brain areas and the connected body 
parts are in reverse order. Removal of parts of the motor 
area results in loss of voluntary activity in the 
sponding parts of the body. 
The fact that removal of the motor area result: 
toss of voluntary activity does not prove that all | 
movements are located in this region, any more tl:_. .. - 
fact that removal of the primary sensory area, which 
eliminates all more elaborate consciousness, proves that 
all conscious reactions are located in the primary area. 
Tn both cases, what happens is that the connections with 
other parts of the brain are severed, so that activities de- 
pending on neighboring or remote brain regions are cut 
off, 
' Connections of Motor and Sensory Areas.—The mo- 
tor area occupies but a small part of the Frontal Lobe. 
All of the portion in front is richly connected with the 
sensory areas and the other posterior portions of the
-P-A-G-E-99
84 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
cortex assumed to be involved in conscious life, as well as 
with the motor area. Impulses come in at the primary 
sensory areas, are distributed through the posterior lobes, 
~ then over to the Frontal Lobe, and finally, by way of the 
motor area, are discharged into the organs of response. 
During the transition, conscious states, sensations, per- 
cepts and ideas may arise and, in completing the circuit, 
the brain is engaged much as a whole. All parts are 
essential to successful activity, a fact which may be 
illustrated by the connections involved in human speech. 
Suppose we ask an individual to repeat after us the 
sentence “Where is my hat.” If the primary auditory 
area were destroyed, he could not repeat the sentence be- 
cause he would be unable to hear it. If this area were 
intact, but the surrounding areas removed, he would hear 
the words, but they would be a meaningless jargon of 
sound and consequently it would be impossible to repeat 
the sentence. If all of the sensory and surrounding areas 
were unimpaired, the subject could hear and understand 
the spoken words and also think of them, but still be 
unable to say them when certain parts of the Frontal 
Lobe in front of the final motor area were destroyed. In 
such cases the subject may know well enough what words 
he wants. to say but he is unable to pronounce them. He 
is not incapable of speech and hears what he himself says, 
but it is impossible to get the right words out. The fore 
part of the Frontal Lobe is apparently concerned with 
the combination and codrdination of movements which 
compose our complex learned or voluntary acts. Finally, 
suppose that the whole brain is intact except the final 
motor area. In this case the individual may hear the

addition to this, the impulses may be properly co- 
Srdinated in the fore part of the Frontal Lobe, but he is
-P-A-G-E-100
THE REACTING MECHANISMS 85 
unable to speak voluntarily at all. The connections 
leading from the motor area to the vocal organs have been 
cut, with the result that all learned or voluntary action is 
abolished. The individual’s speech organs are not 
paralysed, inasmuch as the mid-brain and spinal reactions 
may be made. The individual may ery out when fright- 
ened or injured, but the complicated acquired forms of 
speech are eliminated. 
Analogous difficulties in the execution of other types 
of complex reactions may be caused by brain defects. In 
a disorder called “motor apraxia,” the patient, because of 
destruction of the Frontal Lobe in front of the final motor 
area for the hands and arms, may recognize the object and 
think about it, but he cannot get the proper organization 
of movements to handle it. When the final motor area 
itself is injured, he can recognize the object and intend 
the right movements of manipulation, but they do not 
occur. Disturbances earlier in the chain of events, in the 
region surrounding the primary sensory area, make rec- 
ognition and hence proper movement impossible. . De- 
struction of the sensory area results in total inability t to 
see the object. 
Thus there are four steps in the transition of nerve im- 
pulses through the brain: first, sensation,which means _ 
reaction of the primary sensory area; next, perception and 
EauR Wa Tea activity af widel ead. coon 
which compose the greater part.of the-pesteriar cortex; third, the organization of and preparation for a complex

_bulses-in-the-fnalmator_area, where they are discharged

_Sponse.. Defects anywhere along the line will occasion 
disturbances or disability. ,

86 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATIUN 
There is often a very perceptible delay between per- 
ception and final movement, a delay caused by a train of 
thought. For instance, if a subject is asked to “Give the 
best synonym for the word eloquent,” he may promptly 
perceive the words and grasp the meaning of the request, 
but he may need to think some time before deciding what 
motor reaction to make. Having finally decided what to 
respond, the movement pattern is organized and action 
results. Again, one may perceive that a gateway is closed 
and proceed to think things over for a time before de- 
ciding upon and taking a line of action. In these cases 
perception is followed by thinking, for a period long or 
short, out of which action may eventually issue. 
CoNCLUSIONS 
Tn all of these illustrations, both the intimate relation 
of conscious states with movement and the complexity of 
brain activity are apparent. In what appear to be rather 
simple matters, such as reading or repeating a few words, 
all parts of the brain are involved. Such functions, and 
similarly most of thousands of other acquired abilities, 
are not localized in any one small area. We know rather 
definitely where the nerve impulses come into and where 
they leave the cortex, but between entrance and exit, 
where conscious states arise and where the complex -pat- 
terns of discharge are organized, the complexity of neu- 
rones concerned is baffling. 
If there is little likelihood of definite brain localizations 
for percepts, images, memories, ideas, emotions and other 
complex conscious processes, there is still less possibility 
of precise localization of such complex traits as executive, 
selling, or teaching ability, the doctrines of the Phrenol- 
ogists notwithstanding. “ Mental traits such as sagacity,
-P-A-G-E-102
“he - , THE REACTING MECHANISMS 87 
attentiveness, and intuitiveness have no compact localiza- 
tionj nor have temperamental and character traits, such 
as vivacity, cheerfulness, trustworthiness, honesty, sensi- 
tivity, or tendencies to love babies, seek power or enjoy 
musig. Many parts of the brain are engaged in most of 
the single reactions of thought, skill, or sensibility. 
While the evidence, then, that brain action is a neces- 
sary correlate of consciousness is substantial, study of the 
brain, beyond ‘the identification of sensations, contributes 
but little to the task of disentangling our complex con- 
scious responses. Other methods must therefore be 
utilized in the study of conscious experiences. To these 
methods and the results obtained by their use, the next 
chapter will be devoted.

CONSCIOUS STATES AND PROCESSES 
In the preceding chapter, we found that consciousness 
is intimately bound up with activity of the brain, but that 
study of the nervous system yields only a partial analysis 
of mental life. To secure more complete knowledge of 
the various kinds of conscious states, to describe, classify 
and analyse them into elements, psychology has utilized 
mainly the methed of introspection, some of the limita, 
tions of which were mentioned in Chapter 1.“ /\ / 
Consciousness is always a process, it is moving and 
changing, it never stands still for observation. Like the 
scenes on a moving picture screen,some of the background 
may remain fairly constant, but changes of setting, radi- 
cal or slight, may be made at any time and the leading 
characters may appear and depart abruptly. Typically, 
events sweep on in ever changing complexes. If con- 
sciousness could be held up, as one may stop the moving 
picture camera and throw a single picture, a cross section 
of the activity, on the screen for prolonged observations, 
the task of describing and analysing its contents would 
be greatly simplified. This, however, is impossible. One 
must either observe the complex events as they appear, 
that is introspect, or recall and reflect upon them after 
they are gone, a method of observation usually termed 
retrospection, a looking backward, a study from memory. 
Consciousness may perhaps be better compared to an 
orchestra. At each moment the music is a very complex

CONSCIOUS STATES AND PROCESSES 91 
whole, and music exists only when in process. As soon 
as the instruments become inactive, the music ceases. 
Nothing is left to examine. The best one can do, if he is 
interested in studying the details of a particular phase, is 
to have the combination of sounds prolonged or repeated., 
In the laboratory, the introspective psychologist at- 
tempts, by careful arrangement of conditions, to prolong 
a conscious process and to repeat it as often as needed. 
He may attempt to call to mind each of the several steps 
in solving a practical problem, repeatedly holding up 
and working over some of ‘them, while endeavoring 
to observe the whole to sift out the component parts 
and to note their similarities and differences. ™ 08, 
Primary Constious States 
Consciousness is exceedingly complex,made up of many 
elements, like an orchestral selection. To the uninitiated, 
the music is appreciated only as a rather vague whole. 
To the trained musician, the complex consists of units of 
sound from the violin, the cornet, the drum, which enter 
in an intelligible way to make up various patterns that 
form a harmonious whole. The trained musician may go 
further. He may analyse the sound of the cornet or 
violin into a composite of certain fundamental tones and 
overtones. In an analogous manner, the introspective 
psychologist by prolonged experience comes to recognize 
in the stream of conscious processes, a number of units 
which fuse and combine in an infinite variety of ways. 
Having discovered certain types of consciousness, he may 
attempt to analyse them into more minute elements. The 
irreducible elements are termed primary consci utes 
of consciousness.

SENSATIONS 
Among the most readily recognized conscious states are 
those which constitute the awareness of qualities of ob- 
jects or events. We gaze at an orange and become aware 
of its color, sniff and become aware of its odor, apply our 
tongue and experience its sweetness and sourness, touch 
it and realize its coldness and pressure. The orange is an 
object which arouses in us various sorts of conscious reac- 
tions, and such responses are called sensations. 
Sensations are Irreducible—The sensation, as we 
found in the preceding chapter, is the first and simplest 
conscious response to a stimulus, immediately followed in 
all individuals, except the newly born infant perhaps, by 
other more elaborate conscious responses. The adult 
finds it very difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish the 
sensation from other conscious reactions which follow at 
an imperceptible interval of time. Visual sensations, for 
example, are the barren awareness of purple, red, orange, 
yellow, green and blue. It is very difficult to dissociate 
mere awareness of these colors from awareness of the ob- 
jects—the necktie, apple, orange, lemon, leaf or sky— 
which provide the stimulus. Auditory sensations are 
meaningless sounds or noises, without awareness of the 
things or events—the horn, wagon, phonograph, or falling 
board—which produce the stimuli. The introspective 
expert finds it possible to analyse these single conscious 
states from the others which accompany or follow them, 
and he finds it impossible to further dissect them or to 
reduce them to lower units. Sensations, then, are irre-~ 
Gucible conscious elements or primary conscious states. 
Types of Sensations.—Sensations are usually classified 
according to the sense organs in which the nerve impulse 
arises, They are usually further subdivided according to
-P-A-G-E-108

-P-A-G-E-109
94 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
The actual stream of consciousness in the adult, seldom 
if ever, offers a single sensation at once. Even in lifting 
a small weight we may experience sensations not only 
of warmth, cold, and light pressure, but other sensations 
from muscles, ligaments, and joints, from the arm as 
well as from the fingers. Fused with these are floods 
of sensations from other parts of the body, as well as 
odors, sounds, and sights from other external stimulation. 
Compounds.of Sensations.—In everyday experiences, 
we are prone to confuse compounds of sensations with 
the single elementary sensations. Hunger, thirst, nausea, 
aches,.and other. organic and muscular sensations are 
compounds or complexes of hot, cold, pressure,.and pain, 
each in various proportions. What we call the taste of 
~ an onion is a compound of odors, tastes, pressures, and 
pain, and of these. the odor is most prominent. But for 
differences in odor, raw potato and apple, slightly bitter 
water and coffee, roast beef and lamb could scarcely be 
distinguished. 
Tue Content or THOUGHT 
Sensations are conscious reactions which appear when 
a nerve impulse, originating in a sense organ, reaches the 
cortex of the brain. Sensations are never_experienced 
except as reactions to a stimulus which affects some sense 
organ, In ordinary thought, in Teamombering, imagining — _. In ordinary thought, m remembering, imagining, 
day-deaming or reasoning, conscious activities are experi- 
enced that are obviously not sensations. They are con- 
scious states which appear in the absence of direct 
sensory stimulation. 
Images.—If one closes his eyes, while comfortably 
seated, and proceeds to examine his thoughts as they 
flow, it is at once apparent that the content is both com-

plex_and varied. Among other things, most observers 
find that they experience conscious states that are a great 
deal like sensations. They can think of red when the 
objective stimulus is absent, and the color thought of is 
something like the real sensation, although it is usually 
less sharp and clear, less vivid, less definite in shape, less 
stable. It may come and go, shift from one size to 
another, or from one degree of vividness to another; it 
is more slippery, evanescent and difficuk to study, but 
nevertheless unmistakably similar to the genuine sensa- 
tion. Se tale diftecatly acousel ate called

sensations, they are usually classified in the same way.

people, especially educated people, find in the course of 
thinking a great many images of words, or verbal 
wmagery. They notice fleeting images of the visual

appearance, or the sound of the word or the muscular 
feel of saying the word, or sometimes two of these, or 
all three at once. Others report different forms of sym- 
bolic imagery. A certain druggist finds that when he 
thinks of “prescription,” he doesn’t see an image of a 
bottle, of a mixture of liquids, or a piece of paper with 
writing on it or any other concrete thing, nor does he 
mentally see, hear or say the word, but he has a fleeting 
visual image of. B. The student of mathematics may 
think in symbols peculiar to that subject, in sketchy 
impressions that stand for angles, infinity, ete. The 
stenographer may think in images of short- hand symbols. 
Most of usemploy upon occasions symbolic images which 
_ are peculiar to ourselves. 
Some individuals find -that they have a wealth of 
‘kinesthetic’ images, that is, images of the body’s own 
activity as experienced through the senses in the muscles, 
ligaments and joints. Recall of the sensations of apeak- 
ing a word, riodding the head, grasping a pencil or lifting 
the arm, are samples of kinesthetic images. Many seetn 
to find that in recalling “cow” for example, they do not 
see a cow in the mind’s eye or hear a cow “moo” or see 
the word cow, or hear themselves or some one else say 
cow. What they experience are images of the muscle, 
ligament and joint, ie., of the kinesthetic sensations of 
saying on writing cow, or of eye movements in looking 
at-the word or the real cow. 
The kinesthetic, visual and auditory images of symbols 
may be exceedingly brief, fragmentary and obscure, but 
they are always similar to the sensations occasioned by 
seeing, hearing, speaking, and writing the symbol. They 
are somewhat like weak revivals of actual colors, sounds, 
tactile, muscular or other sensory qualities. 
According to some introspective psychologists, all

memories and ideas, all thoughts .are made w images 
combined in various at is, all of the facts 
thought about may be reduced -to complexes of conscious 
of Fred, my watch, my hat, or of men, watches, or hats 
in general, of justice, liberty, aboveness, number, and so 
__on, are, they contend, ‘really combinations of images, 
though these images are often vague and fleeting. 
Non-sensory Ideational Elements——That images are 
irreducible conscious elements and that they are gener- 
ally found during thought is not disputed, but the 
statement that images are the only conscious data is 
denied however, by other introspective workers. There 
are some who believe that thought often includes more 
than sensation-like images. Ideas especially of relations, 
such as bigness, under-ness, around-ness, nearness,. 
similarity; ideas of abstract qualities, such as hardness, 
squareness, faithfulness, five-ness, charity, and other 
complex ideas such as those of energy, The Law of 
Gravitation, the reaction hypothesis, heredity, or 
Democracy, cannot, they believe, be wholly accounted 
for in terms of images. Some assert that in the instant 
that certain ideas occur to mind, there may be no mentai 
imagery which is like any kind of color, sound, pressure, 
or other sensation. The idea comes, as it were, pure and 
simple. It is a conscious reaction, the very eésence of 
thought, but it is not accompanied by sensation-like 
imagery. The 5 ages 
are not the sole ideational elements. There are others, 
although they have not as yet yielded to 
escription by the introspective method. 
Summary.—In summary, we may say that sensations 
are introspectively unanalysable and therefore primary 
conscious data, and that images, being irreducible, are
-P-A-G-E-113
. t . . 
98 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
also primary conscious states, and that it is probable 
that there are important conscious elements of the cogni- 
tive type, that is, important ideational elements that 
have not as yet been fully identified and described. 
Thought is extremely complex and a complete analysis 
awaits future research. Meanwhile, we will use the term 
ideational elements when referring to the content of 
thought, of memory, imagination, ete., including under 
this term both images and non-sensory conscious data 
but excluding, of course, sensations. 
Fre.incs 
Pleasantness and Unpleasantness.—In addition to 
sensations, and ideational elements, many introspective 
psychologists include among the primary mental states, 
the feelings. Not only are we aware of red, blue, salt, 
and,pain, we also feel the agreeableness or disagreeable- 
ness, the pleasantness or unpleasantness of the sensation. 
Just what these feelings are cannot be readily portrayed 
in words. One can understand. them only by examining 
the content of consciousness when one is aware of the 
pleasantness of a sweet taste, or the unpleasantness of 
a bitter taste, or when one finds one voice pleasing, an~ 
other displeasing, or when he finds one color combination 
agreeable and another disagreeable. Ideas, too, may have 
a tinge or background of feeling. The thought of a social 
blunder may be decidedly unpleasant, while the thought 
of the victorious finish of a footrace may be very 
pleasant. 
In everyday life we speak of many varieties of feelings, 
such as feelings of fatigue, feelings of stiffness, feelings 
of anger. We say “I feel good” or hungry, sorry, happy, 
excited, energetic, anxious and so on, as well as pleasant
-P-A-G-E-114
CONSCIOUS STATES AND PROCESSES. - -99 | 
or unpleasant. In these everyday usages of the term, “I 
feel” becomes essentially equivalent to “I am conscious 
of” or “I am aware of” and what we are aware of is 
some bodily or mental condition. Most of ‘these “feel- 
ings” turn out to be groups of sensations. In psychology, 
the term feeling is used in a technical sense. Pleasant- 
ness and unpleasantness are primary feelings. Nothing 
else is a feeling in the sense that if cannot be reduced to 
other elements, such as sensations. At least, this is the 
opinion of many authorities. 
Feelings and Sensations.—Pleasantness and unpleas- 
antness are not identical with sensations although the 
two are readily confused. In particular, unpleasantness 
is easily confused with sensory pain. Pain is a definite 
sensation occasioned by the stimulation of a particular 
kind of sense organ. There is no sense organ, however, 
for either pleasantness or unpleasantness. These feelings 
may accompany any sensory experience. Pain is usually 
unpleasant just as sweet is usually pleasant, but both 
pain and sweet are sensations. When one is satiated or 
nauseated, sweet may be unpleasant, and pain is probably 
not always unpleasant as when a boy gently pokes a 
sore tooth. In pathological cases, extreme sensory pain 
seems to be distinctly pleasant, although it is still pain. 
The taste of salt is sometimes pleasant, sometimes 
unpleasant, and so with pressures, tones, odors, and other 
sensations. While some are generally one or the other, 
few are invariably accompanied by the same feeling and 
these variations make it clear that sensations and feelings 
are not identical. 
Feelings and Emotions.—Feelings are also easily con- 
fused with emotions, such as anger, fear, joy, or sym- 
pathy. Fear, for example, while usually unpleasant, may 
be accompanied at times by_a pleasant feeling, as when 
pe 
l= 4) LY a
-P-A-G-E-115
100 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
one is riding in an airplane, hunting a wild beast, or 
shooting the rapids in a skiff. Anger is usually unpleas- 
ant but sometimes pleasant; dogs are not the only 
animals that seek a quarrel for the pure pleasantness 
of it. At times one may find sympathy for others rather 
unpleasant, and may give alms or relief to save oneself 
the feelings which accompany sympathy, but on other 
occasions, sympathy may be deeply indulged—perhaps 
sympathy for oneself—precisely because it is pleasant. 
The common emotions then are not the same as feelings 
inasmuch as they may be accompanied sometimes by 
one, again by another feeling. 
Theories of Feeling—Some authorities have con- 
tended that pleasantness and unpleasantness are not 
irreducible conscious states but complexes of organic 
sensations. They assume that most reactions, whether 
conscious or motor, are accompanied or followed by 
slight, but probably important internal or organic 
changes. One group of internal changes is experienced 
consciously as pleasantness, another group as unpleasant- 
ness. A sweet taste is usually accompanied by inner 
changes of the first sort, a bitter taste by changes of the 
second sort. The thought of a friendly act arouses 
organic changes which are pleasant, while the thought 
of a stinging rebuke, arouses the unpleasant variety. 
This is an attractive theory, but the difficulty is that 
no one has been able to identify the two groups of internal 
changes. Nearly every experience is accompanied or fol- 
lowed by various types of slight organic changes, but 
those that have been identified do not appear to fall 
neatly into two distinct groups, one to correspond to 
pleasantness, another to unpleasantness. It is, of “course, 
possible that the really significant changes are extremely 
subtle and await discovery. But many think such a
-P-A-G-E-116
CONSCIOUS STATES AND PROCESSES 101 
discovery unlikely for the reason that introspective study 
of the feelings shows very little that is much like familiar 
organic sensations. The feelings, they contend, are 
utterly unlike combinations of known sensations. They 
are a radically different kind of conscious experience that 
cannot be broken up into anything more elemental. 
Search for the physical basis of pleasantness and 
unpleasantness has not been fruitful. No particular area 
of the cortex is known to be associated with the feelings, 
although several by no means convincing bits of evi- 
dence have been presented to the effect that parts of the 
mid-brain, or parts of the Frontal Lobe, or both together 
are primarily concerned. That the feelings are not defi- 
nitely localized in the brain is not evidence against their 
reality inasmuch as other conscious processes, such as 
images, are not known to be dependent upon any precise 
brain area. 
According to several theories, the explanation of feel- 
ings is to be found in the condition of the neurones them- 
selves, It is assumed that activity of the neurones when 
they are in one kind of condition results in pleasantness, 
and when in a: nother kind of condition, in unpleasantness. 
Precisely what¥these inner conditions of neurones may 
be is not known. (According to one theory, that of 
Thorndike, the coridition may be expressed roughly as 
a readiness or unreadiness to act} When neurones are 
ready to act, exercise results in pleasantness, when 
unready to act, activity is unpleasant. When we are 
ready to eat, sleep, talk, to do so is pleasant. When the 
neurones concerned in these activities are unready, forced 
activity results in unpleasantness. It has been further- 
more assumed that when neurones are ready to act, for 
them not to act results in unpleasantness. Thus when 
the neurones concerned in tasting salt are ready to act,
-P-A-G-E-117
102 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
to taste salt is pleasant, to fail to taste salt is unpleasant. 
When one is unready to taste salt, its taste will be 
unpleasant. Although the actual state of affairs’ in 
neurones, when ready and unready, is unknown, this 
theory seems to harmonize very well with introspective 
findings, such as the fact that an experience is sometimes 
pleasant and again unpleasant, the fact that nearly every 
reaction is “toned” to some extent by one feeling or the 
other, and finally, with facts later to be observed con- 
cerning the organism’s tendency to avoid repeating an act 
which is unpleasant and to seek and repeat an act which 
is pleasant. 
Degrees of Pleasantness and Unpleasantness.—Feel- 
ings, finally, are experienced in various degrees, ranging 
from the most extreme unpleasantness through a zero 
or indifference point to the most extreme pleasantness. 
Severe sensory pain, nausea, or the thought of an impend- 
ing business failure would usually be rated as highly 
unpleasant. The taste of dry bread or the idea aroused 
by an old joke might be indifferent, neither pleasant nor 
unpleasant. The taste of fruit when hungry, the sound 
of music, the thrill of flattery, or the thought of a 
holiday might be highly pleasant. 
Summary or Primary Conscrous STATES \ 
The introspective analysis of the content of conscious- 
ness is found to be difficult, so complex is the whole and © 
so evasive the parts. Among the specialists in this field 
there is some disagreement, but on some points all opin- 
ions are in harmony, It is generally agreed that sensations 
are primary, irreducible mental states. There is unani- 
mous agreement also that images are primary mental 
data which may be described as similar im appearance
-P-A-G-E-118
CONSCIOUS STATES AND PROCESSES 108 
to sensations without being identical with them. Some 
believe that images are the sole content of thought 
whereas others believe that there are ideational elements 
of anon-sensory character. That feelings of pleasantness 
and unpleasantness are primary conscious states, differing 
from sensations, images, and ideational data of a non- 
sensory sort, is believed by many but not by all authori- 
ties. On the whole, the preponderance of evidence is 
probably in favor of assuming at least these four types 
of conscious elements—sensations, images, non-sensory 
ideational data and feelings. With sufficiently refined 
methods it is possible that the non-sensory ideational 
data may be analysed into two or more elements. 
Compitex MentaL Processes 
The introspective analysis of consciousness was 
achieved by study of complex streams of conscious 
activity. From a, practical point of view, we are usually 
more interested in the complex processes than in the 
elements. In everyday life we talk of perceiving a thing 
or event, of remembering a fact, of imagining, of dream- 
ing, of reasoning. We speak of emotions, impulses, ideas, 
and memories. In all of these processes, the conscious 
content is complex, made up of the primary mental states 
in innumerable combinations and fusions. In the 
remainder of the chapter, the composition of several com- 
plex mental processes will be suggested, briefly in most 
instances, inasmuch as more complete discussions will

A percept is the outcome of an act of perception; the 
percept is a conscious state. Perception, we learned in
-P-A-G-E-119
i 104. PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
the preceding chapter, follows sensation, but the latter 
is usually prolonged and fused with the former. The 
sensation is the awareness of the bare quality of} an 
object; the percept is immediate recognition of the 
object, a conscious reaction more complex and of a differ- 
ent sort from sensation. Introspective examination of 
the content of consciousness during the act of perceiving 
an object, shows both sensations, images and, according 
to some, ideational elements of the non-sensory sort, all 
combined or fused to appear as one unit. In perception, 
then, no new conscious states are found; only sensations 
and ideational elements. 
Emotions 
Love, hate, fear, jealousy, anger, joy, sorrow, are 
familiar emotions. They are conscious, in fact, most 
vividly constious, and yet diffuse and indefinite in com- 
parison with most sensations, percepts and ideas. They 
have a subjective reference; they are felt as if in us, 
- whereas colors, sounds, and odors are felt as if outside the 
body. According to the now famous James-Lange 
Theory, formulated at about the same time over thirty 
years ago by the American psychologist William James 
and the Danish physiologist Carl Lange, the emotion is 
not a new kind of conscious state but essentially a com- 
plex flood of sensations from disturbed activities of the 
body. The emotion is a blend of sensations from the 
skin, muscles, blood vessels, stomach, heart, intestines, 
lungs, internal glands—from a great many different parts 
of the body. 
Some stimulus, such as a clap of thunder, a provok- 
ing man, a fearful animal, or an idea of these or other 
things, first greatly disturbs the inner workings of the
-P-A-G-E-120
CONSCIOUS STATES AND PROCESSES 105 
body. These disturbances stimulate thousands of the 
sense organs which occasion a torrent of sensations. The 
complex of sensations is the emotion. This view seems 
to be essentially correct, as we shall see in a later chapter 
devoted entirely to the emotions. 
IMPULSES AND STATES OF READINESS 
When one is about to sneeze, yawn or cough, one may 
experience a conscious impulse. If some one makes an 
offensive remark, one may feel an impulse to strike or 
make a cutting retort. When hungry or thirsty, one may 
experience an impulse to eat or drink. If the act of 
sneezing, coughing or striking occurs promptly, following 
its adequate stimulus, the impulse is scarcely observed; 
it is in the event of a delay in the response that it 
becomes vividly conscious. Thus, if it is impolite to 
sneeze, yawn or speak, the impulse becomes clearly 
conscious. 
Impulses are distinctly subjective experiences, some- 
what similar to the sensations of tickle, mild pain or 
the combinations of organic sensations such as those 
comprising strain or ache. The former have, however, 
a peculiar quality which may be described only by saying 
they are impulsive. May this impulsive character be 
reduced to the primary conscious states already observed? 
Most probably impulses introduce no new conscious 
data. Those connected with the acts of sneezing, cough- 
ing, and the like, consist mainly of sensations from partly 
aroused muscles and in some cases, glands. When a 
person is on the verge of a sneeze, there is really a con- 
siderable activity under way, activity which is a 
preparation or a preliminary adjustment for the final 
response. The individual takes in breath, the nostrils
-P-A-G-E-121
106 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
widen, facial muscles contract, glands in the nostrils and 
eyes secrete. The sensations occasioned by all of these 
adjustments is the impulse. The impulse, being a group 
of sensations, is conscious, and the bodily condition which 
occasions the sensations is a state of readiness, or 
preparation for some act. 
Impulses and states of readiness may precede any 
activity, such as eating and drinking, and other instinc- 
tive acts, whether simple, like jerking away the hand 
when it is pricked, or complex, like the impulse to fight 
when angered, to run when afraid, or to seize an attrac- 
tive object. Impulses and states of readiness may pre- 
cede acquired acts such as studying, playing tennis, 
attending the movies, or smoking a cigar. Any reaction 
whatsoever may be preceded by a state of readiness and 
the corresponding conscious impulse. 
There are probably impulses which depend not upon 
the partial activity or state of readiness of muscles and 
glands, but upon a slight arousal of cortical neurones 
concerned in ideas. Thus one may, in mental arithmetic, 
be disposed to add rather than to subtract or divide. 
One has what is sometimes termed a mental set in one 
direction which favors further mental activity cof one 
sort rather than of others. Thus by means of preliminary 
instructions an individual may assume a mental set 
favorable to thinking of the opposites of a series of 
words rather than synonyms or vice versa, or to thinking 
of animals or plants or cities or rivers. The mental set 
is a preparatory reaction, or state of readiness, which is 
sometimes very difficult to analyse consciously, and 
which depends upon a slight arousal of certain neurones 
which constitutes an effective predisposition toward one 
kind of further activity, rather than other kinds. Insofar 
as the impulses may be analysed, they seem to consist
-P-A-G-E-122
CONSCIOUS STATES AND PROCESSES 107 
either of sensations or ideational elements of the sorts 
found in other states of consciousness. 
Memory, Imacination AND OTHER THOUGHT 
PROCESSES 
The contents of thought are images and other forms 
of ideational elements as yet not clearly described. There 
are several types of thought or thinking, but the con- 
scious elements appear to be the same in all. Whether 
we call the type of thinking memory, imagination or 
reasoning, is determined by criteria other than the kind 
of conscious data utilized, as we shall see in later 
chapters. 
Tur CoMpLexity oF Conscious ACTIVITY 
The fact that one’s consciousness at any moment is 
complex has already been emphasized. As the reader 
sees this page, he may be conscious of the temperature 
and of various sights of the room, of sounds from a dis- 
tance, of the weight of the. book, of well-bemg or ill- 
being of the body, of muscular pressure and strain, of 
percepts of words and various ideas recalled thereby, 
of being pleased or displeased or possibly emotionally 
interested or disgusted with it all. Although it is neces- 
sary for scientific purposes to dissect a momentary con- 
sciousness into sensations, ideas and feelings, and to 
consider separately such combinations as percepts, emo- 
tions, impulses and memories, a full cross-section of 
consciousness would usually include all of these in any 
one of innumerable combinations. As Thorndike has 
aptly remarked: “Mental life is not like a series of solos, 
now sensations, now memories, now feelings; but it is
-P-A-G-E-123
108 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
like the performance of the whole orchestra in which 
many sounds fuse into a total. One instrument may pre- 
dominate for a time, but seldom, if ever, is it active 
alone.”

CHAPTER VI 
THE ORIGIN, DEVELOPMENT AND GENERAL 
CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE 
ACTIVITY 
If we had before us several newly-born infants for 
observation, it would soon be apparent that in the 
weight of the body, color of eyes, shape of the nose—in 
fact, in any anatomical feature we might single out— 
marked individual differences occur. In the sensitivity 
of the eye, ear or other sense organs, in the speed and 
force of muscular reaction, in the conductivity and 
modifiability of the nervous system, in the efficiency of 
heart action, in the glandular activities of digestion, and 
in resistance to disease, variations are apparent even at 
birth. How are we to account for these differences? 
Are they due to accidental factors, to differences in nutri- 
tion or in maternal activity? Are they in any way 
acquired before birth, or is there some other explanation 
of their existence? 
What is known about pre-natal influence makes it 
appear improbable that most of the anatomical and 
functional differences which appear at birth are con- 
genitally acquired. While severe illness, emotional dis- 
turbances, malnutrition, alcoholism, and other serious 
misfortunes of the mother may affect the child through 
the mother’s impoverished or poisoned blood, and while 
the child may be directly harmed by infectious disease 
or by injuries before birth, these facts seem to prove 
merely that there is required a pre-natal environment 
110

CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE ACTIVITY 111 
that will permit normal growth to go on. Given favor- 
able conditions up to the time of birth, differences among 
infants will still appear; differences that are not 
congenitally acquired, but inherited. 
Life begins with the fertilization of the ovum, a micro- 
scopic but very complex cell. Contained in the germ 
cell are certain elements or “determiners” out of which 
the various bodily organs and functions develop. Certain 
determiners grow into certain sense organs, others 
become particular bones, others become teeth, and so on. 
Even for the most minute traits, the color of the eyes, 
the shape of the lobe of the ear, a peculiar notch in a 
tooth, there exist determiners in the germ cell. Except 
for the occasional congenital disturbance of the severe 
types mentioned, the differences among infants which 
appear at birth are native, in the sense that they are the 
result of the unfolding, innate growth of determiners 
which existed in the germ cells from the beginning of 
life. 
At the time of birth, however, almost no trait, not 
even the color of the eyes, is fixed in its final form. 
Growth is still going on; the eyes rapidly become a 
deeper blue, the bones lengthen, the face takes on new 
expression, Are these changes which take place after 
birth, like prenatal growth, largely an unfolding of innate 
traits, or are they now more largely determined by the 
influences, training or experiences provided by the much 
more variable and complex environment? As illustra- 
tions, we may consider the growth of the following 
human traits: 
1. Anatomical traits 
2. The capacities or functions of bodily organs 
3. Types of reactions, such as grasping, sneezing, 
crying, fighting

to about 20.5 inches at birth, to about 42 inches at the 
age of five, and from that time growth increases fairly 
uniformly until the maximum height of about 68.5 
inches is reached in his seventeenth year or thereabouts. 
Different individuals show various curves of growth,
-P-A-G-E-128
CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE ACTIVITY 113 
some less regular than others, some maturing later than 
others, and reaching different maximal heights, and 
these variations, as well as the rates and limits of growth 
are, in the main, determined by original nature, by ele- 
ments which existed in the germ cells. Of course, the 
child will not grow as he should without proper food, 
sleep and exercise, and his development may be disturbed 
by disease, poisons and other harmful influences. But\ . 
given a reasonably good environmental opportunity, 
the child matures in accordance with his inherited _, 
predisposition. 
Other anatomical traits such as the color or size of the: 
eye, the profile of the face, or shape of the pelvis are/ 
like height, determined mainly by original nature. The 
growth of weight, while it shows a curve similar to that 
of height, except that it is more irregular, is more sus- 
ceptible to environmental factors than is the develop- 
ment of most anatomical traits. An afternoon of violent 
exercise may reduce weight somewhat, without percepti- 
bly affecting height. Malnutrition and most forms of 
illness have less effect on height than on weight. But 
here again, given a normal life, weight is largely an 
expression of native constitution; that is, if many 
children were given identical amounts and kinds of food, 
~exercise, and sleep, and were free from disease, they 
; would still attain different weights. 
GrowTH oF CAPACITIES AND FUNCTIONS OF 
MECHANISMS 
Sensitivity of the Sense Organs.—The sensitivities of 
the sensory mechanisms are fairly well developed at 
birth, although growth is rapid for two or three years 
thereafter, By the age of three, the organs are very
-P-A-G-E-129
114. PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
nearly as sensitive to stimuli as they will ever be, 
although it is probable that very gradual growth occurs 
until a maximum is reached in the late teens. Much 
the same curve of development is shown by the capa- 
city to discriminate between stimuli; for example, 
between high and low notes, dark and light shades of 
gray, heavy and light pressure. The development of | 
such sensory capacities seems to be determined largely / / 
by inner factors rather than by experience. Diligent’ 
exercise produces at any one stage some improvement, 
but the limit is soon reached. If one’s auditory acuity 
is poor, no amount of special practice will result in a 
high degree of acuity. People blind from birth, despite . 
more extensive auditory experience have, as a group, 
no greater sensitivity than other individuals. ‘ 
In making these statements, two sources of confusion 
should be avoided. The one is the case of defects of the 
accessory apparatus of the sense organ, in the lens or 
muscles of the eye, for example, which may be remedied 
or corrected, thereby improving the function of the organ 
without actually changing the sensitivity of the receiving 
cells. The other is the fact that practice by the blind, 
for example, may result in very great ability to interpret 
sounds which the normal individual would disregard. 
The blind, by attending to the echoes from their foot- 
steps, may detect the presence of obstacles or doorways 
in a room, but this sort of learning does not imply an 
increase in sensitivity of the sense organ. 
Functions of the Reacting Mechanisms.—The func- 
tions of the reacting mechanisms, like those of the 
receiving mechanisms, show typical rates and limits of 
growth. Concerning the development of the glands, very 
little is known. Most of them seem to be functioning 
actively from birth until death; for example, the
-P-A-G-E-130
CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE ACTIVITY 115 
thyroid, the pituitary, the adrenals, the pancreas, the 
salivary, sweat, oil, and lachrymal glands. The pineal 
and thymus appear to function actively in childhood and 
to die with it. The sex glands show various stages of 
growth, with the appearance of new functions at pubes- 
cence, Extraordinary conditions, disease, shock, over’ 
work, may disturb the functioning and growth of any of; 
the glands, but normally the development is determined 
from within. " 
The speed of muscular reaction, as determined by the 
number of taps made in a given time, or by the time, in 
thousandths of a second, required to jerk the hand from 
a telegraph key at a signal; the precision and steadiness 
with which a subject can move a short pointer down a 
continuously narrowing groove, and the strength of 
muscular reaction, represent fairly elementary muscular 
capacities upon which, among other things, the acquisi- 
tion of skill depends. As children become older, their 
efficiency in all of these functions increases. That innate 
growth is responsible in a goodly measure for this 
development can be shown by an experiment. If we take 
a group of adults or children of the same age and give 
them five minutes’ daily practice in tapping, they will 
have reached their limit of improvement in from 12 to 22 
days. But their maximal abilities are very different. 
These differences, since practice up to the limit of the 
_ individuals’ capacities does not obliterate them, must be 
innate. Young children who have reached their practice 
level may, after an interval of time during which growth 
occurs, again improve somewhat by practice. The degree 
of absolute achievement at any stage may be increased 
by special practice or experience but. only within certain 
limits, which are determined by native endowment. 
When practice and other circumstances of life are equal-
-P-A-G-E-131
116 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
ized, differences between individuals will still exist and 
these differences are native. 
Capacities of the Nervous System.—Modifiability and 
retentiveness of the neurones, upon which learning de- 
pends, can be measured at. least roughly by tests of 
general intelligence or general mental ability, or of the 
rate and permanence with which various types of infor- 
mation and skill may be acquired, at different ages. As 
we shall see later, the capacity to learn and retain de- 
velops gradually from birth to maturity in a manner 
which resembles strikingly the growth curve for height.1, 
While we are still in doubt about the earliest and latest. 
stages, and other characteristics of the growth of these 
capacities, the essential fact: that they. do grow in a 
manner determined by native endowment is well estab- 
lished. The capacity to learn and retain, to profit by 
practice and experience, is native. Like other innate 
traits, a favorable environment is required to permit nor- 
mal development; which may be retarded or inhibited by 
extraordinary misfortunes, but so far as we know, no 
special type of exercise or training will greatly increase 
these capacities. To be welt fed, healthy, and normally, 
active, physically and mentally, is sufficient to enable, 
these powers to attain their full fruition. 
Capacity and Achievement.—At this point, a very im- 
portant distinction may be drawn between capacity and 
achievement; between growth and accomplishment. 
Children of the same age will, on the basis of endowment, 
possess different aptitudes. But aptitude does not insure 
achievement. What is done with one’s capacity, whether 
it be high, medium or low, depends on how persistently, 
how vigorously, and in what directions it is applied. With 
the same ability for acquiring skills of finger and hand, 
*See page 431.
-P-A-G-E-132
CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE ACTIVITY 117 
one person may learn to write, typewrite, play the piano, 
draw, repair various machines, and so on, whereas another 
with equal capacity may acquire none of these acts of 
skill. With equal mental capacity, one may learn read- 
ing, spelling, arithmetic, history, and other informational 
subjects, while another may acquire but little in these 
fields. One does acquire various “tricks of the trade” as 
well as information and skill, but native modifiability and 
retentiveness are not changed perceptibly except insofar 
as they grow of themselves. 
GrowTH or BEHAVIOR . 
Native Activities of the Infant—We have spoken of 
the development of certain bodily organs and traits and 
of certain important capacities and functions. We find 
in addition to these traits and capacities, but depending 
upon them, a wide variety of activities going on imme- 
diately after birth. Such complex activities as those inh- 
volved in the regulation of bodily temperature, breathing, 
circulation of blood, digestion, and assimilation, are func- 
tioning. Likewise very complicated emotions, such as 
fear, when a loud noise is made or when the infant is | 
suddenly jerked; anger, when the nose, arms or other 
members are held; or pleasure, when the baby is rocked : 
or rubbed, may appear almost immediately after birth..’ 
The infant may suck, sneeze, hiccough, yawn, cry, grasp 
objects, wave the arms, move, stretch or kick the legs 
within the first hour. In a few-days rather well defined 
defense reactions occur. If you grasp the child’s toes, 
he will attempt to pull loose; grasp his left knee, the right 
foot will be pushed against the hand. Most of these ac-— 
tivities are exceedingly complicated, so complicated as to 
exclude all possibility of learning under the conditions
-P-A-G-E-133
118 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
preceding birth. There is no way to account for these 
activities in the infant except to assume that they era tha 
result of Winer growth. Sieh activities are 
termed native, unlearned, innate or instinctive. 
Native Activities appearing Later—Anaton 
and certain capacities, we found, continued t. _.._.-, 
after birth, and there was reason to believe that such 
growth was largely due to the maturing of innate traits. 
Some of the bodily organs, the teeth, for example, do not 
appear until some time after birth. It is not improbable 
that activities which appear ‘late, as well as the grow 
and changes in the responses present at the time of birth, 
are really native. 
Certain acts, such as walking, cannot function until the 
muscles and bones have reached a certain maturity. But 
neural connections as well as bones and muscles must be 
ready for action before a venture brings success. Appar- 
ently a tremendous number of neural connections develop 
‘innately. As there exist in the germ cells determiners 
of the bodily organs, so there exist determiners for neu- - 
ral connections. The neural organizations, like muscles 
or bones, are not necessarily completely developed at 
birth, but attain working order at various later dates. 
The child may attempt walking before the inner develop- 
ment is entirely adequate to the task with much stagger- 
ing and falling as a result. But where inner growth is 
gradual, as it probably invariably is, imperfection of the 
activities in the early stages is to be expected. «

As the child grows older, he is observed to climb, fight, 
collect objects, join gangs, attempt to dominate others,
-P-A-G-E-134

. and to show an interest in the opposite sex. How are we 
to determine whether these traits are inborn or acquired? 
Activities which appear without Opport 
Learn.—Whether an activity is largely native ; 
learned can be determined finally only by ex, 
If an activity appears when the opportunity for 
is withheld, it is instinctive. Where it is possib! 
duct such an experiment, the results should be conclusive. 
Very few investigations of this sort have been conducted, 
and all of these have been performed on animals. Spald- 
ing took some newly hatched birds, locked up each of 
them in a box so small that they were unable even to 
stretch their wings, and isolated them so that they could 
not observe other birds in flight. Thus they were de- 
prived of all opportunity to learn’ until other birds, 
hatched at the same time, had become competent per- 
formers. Then they were released. They were able to 
fly at once, almost but not quite as well as the birds 
which had not been imprisoned. Their control was not 
quite so good; their alighting for a time was clumsy; but 
a large part of the ability to fly had developed without 
specific practice. 
It seems likely that for the human infant walking is 
native in a similar fashion. The only way to determine 
with certainty is to perform analogous experiments, which 
for obvious reasons has not been done. In two or three 
instances on record, infants, who for one reason or an- 
other were given no practice in walking until well past 
the usual age, were able to walk very well on their first 
attempts. . . 
Universality as a Criterion.—In the absence of crucial 
experimentation we must rely on less valid methods of 
distinguishing native from learned behavior. Observa- 
tions of children whose life history is carefully recorded
-P-A-G-E-135
120 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
have been one source of information. The study of 
primitive people, present or past, whose environment and 
training differ widely, affords an opportunity to inventory 
traits that are common to all and therefore probably na-. 
tive. When a trait is found universally among members of 
the same species, whatever their environment or train- 
ing, the assumption is that it is native unless evidence ta 
the contrary is produced. This is the criterion of univer: 
sality. It must always be used cautiously because of the 
likelihood that some form of universal training may be 
responsible for the trait. All people may eat with some 
utensil but it is a trying task to teach the infant to use 
his spoon. On the other hand some traits, even if in- 
stinctive, may fail to appear universally because no en- 
vironmental incentive is provided, or because the activity 
is generally forbidden. If climbing trees were instinctive, 
it might fail to show itself in city children; if hunting 
and killing animals were instinctive, it might fail to show 
itself universally because it is tabooed by society. The 
criterion of universality, while not always conclusive, is 
usually suggestive affording at least a preliminary test,” 
The Evolution of Behavior from Animals.—The study 
of animal behavior has been fruitful of suggestions con- 
cerning the nature of human behavior. The criterion of 
universality and the experimental method are both ap- 
plied here more effectively than to man, and when once 
native traits are ascertained, it is most profitable to work 
out their evolution.— Just as the human eye has a long 
evolutionary history, going back to the simple pigmented 
célls of the jellyfish, so forms of behavior, such as “with- 
drawing reactions,” have evolved from lower organisms. _ 
Most profitable, of course, is the study of the higher 
forms of animals, our ape-like and other simian ancestry. 
The task of distinguishing native from acquired traits is)
-P-A-G-E-136
CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE ACTIVITY 121 
simplified in the study of animals because their capacit 
to learn is appreciably less; their behavior retains a larger 
proportion of the instinctive, although their inheritance 
of native traits is less extensive than ours. The human 
infant, from the time of birth, begins to learn, and this 
capacity increases so rapidly and is so effectively utilized, 
that shortly most forms of behavior which we can observe 
are a mixture of native and acquired elements that are 
difficult to disentangle. There is, however, pretty fair 
agreement among the experts concerning several native 
tendencies. . 
Tue Varieties or Instinctive ACTIVITIES 
Instinctive activities vary greatly in complexity. At 
the one extreme are relatively simple responses, such as 
winking when a particle strikes the cornea of the eye, the 
jerking of the finger when prickéd, swallowing, sneezing, 
grasping, yawning, coughing, each to the proper stimulus. 
These are usually called reflexes, but they are not to be 
sharply contrasted with feeding, walking, crying, or fight- 
ing, which are usually called instincts. There is a con: 
tinuous gradation from the most simple to the most com- 
plex; the term, reflex, is applied to the activities at the) 
former, instinct, to those at the latter end of the scale. 
Instinctive activities differ also in the firmness of their 
organization; some of them persist throughout life with 
little modification; some of them may be, at least in 
their external form, readily changed. Taken as a whole, 
the simpler ones, the reflexes, are hard to modify and 
almost impossible to eradicate entirely. For example, 
the “knee jerk” and the “pupillary reflex” are so constant 
that their absence is indicative of serious bodily dis- 
orders. Nearly all of the vital activities—heart action or
-P-A-G-E-137
122 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
digestion—cannot be greatly or permanently modified by 
conscious effort. Such activities as smiling, laughing, 
walking, talking, are more readily changed. The various 
speech organs, including the nerve connections, are na- 
tively organized in such a way that various sounds can 
be produced. Out of these elementary sounds, after 
many trials, patterns are acquired which result in spoken 
words. Learning consists in the reorganization of native 
units into new patterns of response, as when one learns 
to speak English, French or Chinese words. In this 
sense, vocalization is modifiable. The same is true of 
manipulation. At birth, or shortly after, a number of 
fairly well established native reactions appear. The 
child grasps a rod placed in his palm in a particular way ; 
in fact, his reaction is so well developed that he can 
sustain his whole weight with his grip. Tickle the palm 
of his hand, pinch his finger at various places, rub his 
thumb, different reactions will occur. What we find is a~ 
large number of specific reactions to specific stimuli that” 
are fairly constant and persistent. But give the child’a 
rattle, a string or a spoon, and shortly he will acquire new 
tricks of manipulation; tricks that represent merely new 
patterns or arrangements of the elementary native re- 
sponses. The minute elements of response are not 
readily changed, but they are readily reorganized into 
new, acquired patterns. 
Tue CHaracteristics or Instinctive ACTIVITIES 
Such units as manipulation and vocalization are often 
called instinctive tendencies to react, the reactions them- 
selves varying with the circumstances and falling into 
new patterns through learning. Most of the complex\ 
native behavior to which the term instinct is applied is
-P-A-G-E-138
‘CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE ACTIVITY 123 
jof this sort. Given the proper stimulus, the instinctive 
“tendency is aroused. Once aroused, the tendency may 
persist for some time, showing itself in an impulse or 
readiness to act, to carry through a reaction which affords 
a satisfying relief. These facts will be clarified by an 
illustration. 
The feeding instinct which has been studied recently 
in animals, infants and adults, portrays several important 
features of complex instinctive behavior. Certain bodily 
conditions, of which one invariable symptom is the vigor- 
ous contraction of the walls of the upper part of the 
stomach, are the usual stimuli which arouse the state 
termed hunger. Hunger is clearly impulsive; it is a state 
of readiness for certain activities, namely, the eating of 
food; it is a preparatory reaction. As soon as the hunger 
contractions come on, the subject becomes restless. In- 
fants begin to squirm in their crib, and shortly to cry. 
Adults, engaged in sedentary work, are likely to arise and 
move about; if asleep, they may twist and turn, some- 
times waking. Muscular strength and mental alertness| 
tested during hunger is found to be somewhat greater | 
than during stomach quiescence. The salivary gland and! 
possibly others show an increased secretion. These are 
preparatory reactions, accompanied by an impulse to get 
at food. If the end reaction, the eating, is long delayed, 
the condition is reported as distinctly unpleasant—wit- 
ness any man’s behavior when dinner is late. Animals 
and infants will become violent under sharp hunger. To 
consummate the ends to which the native impulsion 
leads, is, on the contrary, highly satisfying and in the 
case of adults, we may say also pleasant. 
The Impulsive Character of Instincts.—In this de- 
scription of hunger, an important characteristic of the 
complex instinct is disclosed, namely, its dynamic or im-
-P-A-G-E-139
124 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
pulsive character. At first some stimulus, such as the 
bodily condition antecedent to hunger, activates a state 
of readiness, which, in the case of the food-getting in- 
stinct, embraces contraction of muscles in the stomach, 
tenseness of certain skeletal muscles, activity of the sali- 
vary glands, and probably other preparatory reactions. 
Among human subjects, this state of readiness is experi- 
enced consciously as an impulse; an impulse to secure 
and eat food. If food is not available, the state of readi- 
ness and the impulse (at least in man when awake) may 
persist, disclosing itself consciously in many ways, such 
as in ideas of food or eating, or of how or when food may 
be procured, and objectively by restlessness or moving 
about. If the subject is asleep, we can be less certain 
about the conscious impulses, but the state of readiness is 
shown by devices that record contractions of the stomach, 
and tossing, twisting or other movements of the body. 
The bodily state of readiness and the conscious impulse: 
are typical of all complex instincts. They are directed to-' 
ward some consummatory reaction or series of reactions., 
Instincts Important Factors in Human Dynamics.— 
Stimuli, whether they arise in some external situation or 
in some inner condition of the body, arouse tendencies or 
‘drives to activity simply because original nature is what 
it is. A man wants to rest, to eat, to sleep, to be praised, 
to be looked at approvingly, or to add new items to his 
collection of stamps or pictures, fundamentally because 
he is by nature so organized. Instincts, then, provide a 
large number of the determining or dynamic forces in be- 
havior. They account for forms of readiness to act, or in 
less technical terms, for many particular drives, motives, 
desires, inclinations, urges. To understand the instine- 
tive equipment of man is to comprehend the direction in 
which activity is likely to run, to perceive, in some meas-
-P-A-G-E-140
CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE ACTIVITY 125 
ure, what kinds of activity individuals are likely to seek 
and avoid. : 
Every instinct provides states of readiness for, or drives 
to action; but are all motives and impulsions instinctive? 
Here we find differences of opinion. One authority, Mc- 
Dougall, answers the question as follows: “We may 
say, then, that directly or indirectly the instincts are the 
prime movers of all human activity; by the impulsive 
force of some instinct (or some habit derived from an 
instinet), every train of thought, however cold and pas- 
sionless it may seem, is borne along toward its end and 
every bodily activity is initiated or sustained. . . . Take 
away these instinctive dispositions with their powerful 
impulses, the organism would become incapable of ac- 
tivity of any kind; it would lie inert and motionless like 
a wonderful clockwork. whose mainspring had been 
removed or a steam engine whose fires had been 
drawn.” 
Habits as “Drives” to Action —Other authorities are 
inclined to believe that McDougall’s statement is some- 
what extreme. They believe that habits, that is, ac\ 
quired activities, should be placed with instincts as dy- 
namic factors in determining human conduct. McDougall 
admits that habits derived from instincts are motive fac- 
tors, but others are disposed to believe that there are. 
habits, possessing driving potency, which are really not 
derived from instincts. 
Consider a man who has for many years smoked a 
cigar after dinner. When the meal is over, the organism 
gets into a state of readiness for the smoke. If the supply 
of cigars is exhausted, the state of annoyance is usually 
evident. The impulse may become very strong. The 
victim becomes restless and may jam on his hat to walk 
several blocks to the cigar store in order, as we say, to
-P-A-G-E-141
126 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
“satisfy his habit.” So with other types of acquired ac- 
tivities—the paper at breakfast, the afternoon nap, tea 
or a game of tennis, the Saturday evening trip to the 
movies—once they are habituated, the proper setting 
arouses them to readiness. These activities, of course, 
are not instinctive, although as McDougall says, they 
may be at least indirectly related to native tendencies 
and in a measure derived from them. 
Many habits certainly are formed in the service of, or 
to satisfy, the instinctive tendencies. The important 
thing about the eating instinct, for example, is not that 
one instinctively eats in such and such a way, but the 
fact that the hunger impulses persist throughout life and 
that they are the motives behind untcld number and 
varieties of human activity. Men will go to great ex- 
tremes of activity under the drive of hunger, and the 
lives of all of us are influenced by the food-getting in- 
stinct, subtly effective even when not acute. 
Instinctive Tendencies guide Habit Formation.—The 
sex instincts, self-assertion, collecting and hoarding, and 
many others to be enumerated in the next chapter, 
also act as “drives” like hunger, although differences in 
strength are admitted. Altogether, they form the fun- 
“damental dynamic forces which guide human conduct. 
When we buy a hat, take up dancing, study grammar, 
answer a personal question, decide on an evening of work 
or leisure, choose a friend, vocation, or mate, the subtle 
urges of original nature are effective motives even if they 
are quite concealed and often not intelligible either to 
ourselves or others. When all of the facts are known, it 
‘ is quite probable that native tendencies will be found 
imvolved in some degree in all acquired reactions or 
habits, although frequently the relation may be distant 
and indirect.  
-P-A-G-E-142

Tue PERMANENCE OF INSTINCTIVE TENDENCIES 
It has frequently been urged that instinctive tendencies 
are of unstable character, subject to sudden transforma- 
tion or disappearance. It has been assumed that child- 
hood is divided into sharply defined periods or ages—the 
age-of fear, oftimidity, of physiealactivity, of anger and 
fighting, of collecting and hoarding, of gang activities, of 
mating tendencies. While it is true that certain tenden+ 
cies do vary in strength and insistence from time to time, 
this picture of the transitoriness of instincts is usually 
overdrawn. The main fact about most natiye tendencies 
is their essential permanence and stability.W Each has its 
course of growth, its maturity and eventual decay, but in 
the main, development is gradual and maturity is of long 
duration. 
The efficiency of muscles, the capacities of sense organs, 
the retentiveness of nervous structure we found to be 
present:in some form at birth, to develop gradually, al- 
though at different rates, and to reach, early or late, a 
maturity at which they remained until old age. Tenden- 
cies to manipulate, to fear, to be angry, or to fight, may 
likewise be observed at birth, or shortly thereafter. They 
are subject to growth until a maximum is reached, some- 
times very early as in the case of fighting, or late, as in 
the case of the mating instinct. Pubescence, like the 
sudden boiling of water which has been a long time heat- ° 
ing, is actually the culmination of a long period of 
growth. Just as the sensitivity of the sense organs ma- 
tures early, and the ossification of bones late, different 
instinctive tendencies complete their growth at different. 
times, but few appear or disappear suddenly. 
' While the essential native tendencies are stable, the 
potency of the particular stimulating situations. may-
-P-A-G-E-143
128 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
change. ‘The tendency to become angry and to fight 
appears early and lasts long, but the kinds of things 
which make us angry may vary from year to year. The 
native tendency to collect and hoard appears in infancy 
and persists throughout life, although at five, we may 
collect colored cards or dolls, at ten, stamps and cigar 
tags, at fifteen, marbles, tops and baseball bats, at thirty, 
rugs and furniture, and at fifty, books and paintings. 
The native tendency to seek social approval is perma- 
nent, although the kind of approval sought, the way in 
which we seek it, and the sort of people from whom it 
gives most satisfaction, may change greatly from time 
to time. ‘

sense. Modern biology tells us that the original nature 
of the human race changes very slowly, that the native 
equipment of mankind today is not appreciably differen 
from what it was thousands of years ago. Races living 
long before the birth of Christ are believed to have had 
about the same bodily organs, the same physical capaci- 
ties, the same instincts, emotions, and intellect which 
their descendants now have. This is not a denial of 
evolution in man’s equipment, but a statement of the fact 
that evolution is extremely slow. Our native organiza— 
tion, if the biologists are correct, would seem to consti- 
tute a more effective adaptation to the primitive life of 
the savage than to modern customs, habitations, and con- 
ditions. We would expect to be well fitted to a life of 
abundant physical activity in the search of foods, berries, 
nuts, game, or in conflict with animals and other enemies, 
to the avoidance of such dangers as lightning, animals

prowling in the darkness, winds, floods, falling trees or 
rocks, to rude sorts of implements or houses, to fairly 
simple social groups, rather than to typewriters and 
printed books, to refined foods and confined quarters, to 
indoor vocations and complex social conditions. 
The Imperfections of Original Nature.—To the prob- 
able fact that original nature is imperfectly adapted to 
our environment, special emphasis should be given, be- 
cause in popular belief and in not a few books on peda- 
gogy the doctrine of nature’s infallibility has been up- 
held. It is asserted that all instincts must have some 
utility, perhaps not always perceptible to man. Instincts; 
it is said, exist to perpetuate the individual or the race, 
and in particular they serve to avoid danger, secure food,’ 
andsoon. All of this is true only in a general way. On 
the whole, instinctive capacities do have a utility, par- 
ticularly under more primitive conditions of life, but the 
exceptional instances are many and important. Our na- 
tive equipment provides only a rough adjustment to the 
environment; just good enough, so that with the assist- 
ance of the capacity to learn, the species as a whole man- 
ages to survive. That many species have not survived 
and that those that have, still experience difficulties in 
adjustment, are proof enough of the fallibility of our 
inherited equipment. a

CHAPTER VII 
AN INVENTORY OF INSTINCTIVE IMPULSES 
AND ACTIVITIES 
To many stimuli which the world provides, unlearned 
or instinctive reactions are made. The stimulus may 
originate in the body itself, as in hunger or thirst, or out- 
side the body, as when fear is aroused by a clap of 
thunder. The response may be immediate, as when one 
dodges a flying object or grasps an apple, or it may be 
delayed, as when a hungry individual searches for food or 
chases prey. When the final response is delayed, prepar- 
atory reactions are set up which constitute states of 
readiness for further consummatory reactions. Con- 
sciously, the human adult, at least, is aware of impulses 
directed toward the consummatory responses—of con- 
scious urges to further action. In the descriptions of 
human instincts we should consider then: (1) the 
stimuli or stimulating situations; (2) the preparatory re- 
actions and conscious impulses; and (3) the final or 
consummatory reactions. 
/ The term instinct is applied to various units of native : 
behavior that are singled out for discussion. These units 
are seldom precise; most of them include a number of 
elements which may be found in several instincts. For 
example, if we speak of physical activity as an instinct, 
we would include under it manipulation, walking, vocal- 
ization, and many other reactions. If we speak of the 
smaller unit, manipulation, as an instinct, we would i in- 
132

clude various activities that others might place under 
grasping, food getting, collecting and hoarding; and each 
of these could be subdivided into hundreds of more defi- 
nite impulses and reactions called forth by particular 
objects. The last procedure, stating in detail the stimu- © 
lus, the impulse, and the response, is the ideal, but is 
impossible because of the paucity of information. What 
we must do is to break up instinctive behavior into units 
that can be conveniently handled in the space at our dis- 
posal, These units will be called instinets, and to each a 
name will be given. It is important to remember, how- 
ever, that each so-called instinct—feeding, collecting, or - 
fighting—is not an independent, discrete, invariable 
entity or power, but merely an aggregate of specific im- 
pulses and reactions to specific stimuli, with a ragged and 
changing boundary. 
CLASSIFICATION OF INSTINCTS 
What criteria shall we use to-select the units and 
names? A common method is to give a name to the 
purpose that a group of these specific tendencies to act 
seems to serve, such as the instinct of self-preservation or 
the instinct of reproduction. This is a poor method, not 
only because such instincts are too broad to be useful 
units for thought, but also because, by implication, the 
. constituent activities are assumed to have a definite pur- 
pose or utility. The effort to name instincts by the situ- 
ations which arouse them or the responses which the 
organism makes presents difficulties because of the-com- 
plexity of both situations and responses. Perhaps the 
simplest way is to indicate by some name the impulse 
which arises, but the trouble here is that in the case of 
reactions that are seldom delayed or interfered with—the 
condition which makes the impulse more appreciable—
-P-A-G-E-149

134 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
no terms now in use are available. Hunger is the name 
of the impulse for feeding, thirst for drinking; these are 
commonly experienced. But there is no special term for 
air getting—which is seldom thwarted—unless we call 
it the air getting impulse or the impulse to breathe. 
/ In the inventory which follows the names apply mainly 
to the impulse or the reactions, or both, and the instincts 
will be grouped mainly according to the types of stimuli 
which arouse them, as follows: 
1. Instinctive responses to bodily or organic conditions. 
2. Instinctive responses to objects or events in the 
environment. 
8. Instinctive responses to the presence or activities of 
other human beings. 
The inventory will be followed by discussions of the 
relation of original tendencies to mental activities, and 
to satisfying and annoying states of affairs.

‘In most of these tendencies, the exact nature of the 
organic condition which is the stimulus is only imper- 
fectly known, but the impulses, even if unnamed, are 
understood by every one from personal experience. The 
impulses to secure food, water, air, rest or sleep, left. un- 
satisfied, are tremendously potent determiners of conduct. 
Under acute hunger, thirst; or suffocation, activity for 
relief may become violent. The traveler lost in the snow 
or the unrelieved soldier may give way to the impulse to 
sleep even if death is the probable result. Modern life) 
to secure comfort and uniformity of behavior, makes pro- | 
vision, when it may, for abundant and regular relief of/ 
the organic impulses. We find little of importance for 
our purpose in the forms of native overt reaction which 
characterizes the fulfillment of these impulses. There 
are unlearned ways of picking up, carrying to the mouth, 
sucking, or chewing; ways which vary according to the 
size, shape, or consistency of the food, object, or the 
position of the body; native ways of spitting or letting 
drool out, of expressing satiety, most of which may 
be greatly modified through experience or instruction, 
whereas swallowing, digestion, waste elimination, breath- 
ing, and other activities, along with the impulses, cannot 
be readily or permanently altered by deliberate learning.

Gross Bodily Activity.—An infant, when awake, is 
almost ceaselessly active; arms, legs, head and trunk are 
moved by contraction of the large bodily muscles. The 
stimuli are not easy to discover, but it is probable that the 
bodily position, external pressures, things observed and 
possibly heard are involved. Without doubt, internal 
stimulation, hunger, visceral discomfort, fatigue, and 
other conditions have an influence as well. Though the 
stimuli are too complex to unravel, we can be fairly sure 
that the child is making just the reactions he does, be- 
cause: just such and such stimulations are affecting him. 
A constant stream of stimuli provokes a continuous series 
of reactions. 
The impulses to be physically active are quite as real 
and dynamically of the same order as the impulses to 
secure air, food, or sleep. The demand for bodily action 
* probably increases with the maturing of muscles, bones, 
and nerve connections, It is very pronounced from four 
to six, hence the newer kindergarten and primary school 
practice makes wise provision for it, often without sacri- 
fice of other things, since arithmetic, reading and spelling 
may be introduced, in part, through active games. The 
impulses become no fewer or less intense as the child ma- 
tures. Gross bodily efficiency, however, wanes relatively 
early. The professional boxer or baseball player reaches 
his “peak” in the early twenties, at thirty he is considered 
“old,” and few remain in the first ranks at thirty-five. ° 
Of the important forms of organized bodily activity,

which are native and which are acquired? Walking, we 
found reason to believe, is native, although practice modi- 
fies and perfects it. Other forms of maintaining equilib- 
rium when. standing or moving, as in stooping, turning, 
running and jumping, are largely native, and climbing is 
said by many to be native. In swimming there is much 
to learn; the desire to swim, as well as the ability, seems 
to be acquired. : 
Manipulation—The impulse to manipulate objects) 
appears soon after birth. The hands of the school child 
simply itch to fumble with anything about him. He 
twists and turns it, rubs, thumps, pulls, tears, rattles, 
drops, throws. The impulses, especially when the child 
is seated in school, are irresistible. , 
While the human hand is an extremely adaptable in- 
strument, capable of a multitude of performances, it has 
native limitations both of structure and neural organiza- 
tion. Place the palm flat on the table and compare the 
motility of the first with that of the third finger. The 
superiority of the first is doubtless largely native. In 
determining the optimum method of holding and moving 
a pencil in writing, the innate aptitudes of the various 
members should be the starting point. The difficulty of 
acquiring particular abilities—writing, handling tools, 
playing a piano—depends, mainly, upon the degree to 
which such activities demand the reorganization of na- 
tive reactions. . 
It is often said that manipulation is-one form of curios- 
ity, of exploration and inventiveness. While it is true 
that the hand, like the eye or nose or ear, may be the 
means by which other native impulses seek expression, 
manipulation may be said to exist for its own sake. Just 
to manipulate—witness the infant or the imbecile—is 
instinctively satisfying.
-P-A-G-E-153
138 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
Vocalization.—All that has been said about manipula- 
tion could be repeated for vocalization, with the change 
only of the names of organs and responses. There arg 
native impulses to vocalize, and just to make vocal re-} 
sponses is satisfying. One investigator found that a child 
at the age of six averages more than a thousand articulate 
sounds—words or exclamations—per hour. On entering 
certain schools, vocal expressions are suddenly curtailed 
to about forty per hour. While it is probably seldom 
true that nervousness, stuttering, embarrassment at 
speaking in the midst of a group, and other difficulties, 
are the results of such inhibitions of vocalization, wiser 
practice employs a tapering off form of adjustment to 
school conditions and enlists oral speech, as well as phys- 
ical action and manipulation, in the service of the school 
subjects. 
At birth the infant has a single instinctive cry, to which 
are shortly added several distinct forms characteristic of 
hunger, pain, and anger. Before long, there appear 
various forms of cooing, gurgling and babbling sounds, 
out of which by reorganization and combination, speech, 
song, and other vocal expression appear. 
Imagine a boy reared in isolation by a dumb guardian, 
What would be the character of his vocalization? There 
would be certain changes in power and tone with growth ; 
the breaking voice in adolescence would mark the de- 
velopment of the heavier tones of manhood. There 
would be a number of instinctive cries, the cry of sudden 
pain, of rage, of hunger, of helplessness, of surprise, and 
some form of laughing; but probably everything else 
would be learned and patterned after sounds heard in 
the environment.. The cries of animals and birds, the 
groaning of trees, the moaning of winds, would be taken 
as models of which imitations would be made; some of

them readily, some with difficulty. A bright boy would 
probably develop quite a number of shouts, cries, mut- 
terings or songlike vocalizations, just for the satisfaction 
that developing original combinations of sounds would 
afford. 
/ Two forms of instinctive vocalization, weeping and 
i laughing, deserve special mention; and of these. the 
\former is better understood. Weeping i is a common in- 
‘.stinctive response in helplessness. Its utility, especially 
in infancy, is clear: it may bring relief. It is early dis- 
couraged; at least, the child is told that it is unmanly to 
weep, that is, to admit helplessness. But even adults 
when suffering injury, illness or disappointment concern- 
ing which they can do little or nothing, experience the 
impulse to weep, although they may not actually break 
into tears. 
Many hundreds of pages have been written in efforts 
to explain the function of, and stimulus to, laughing, but 
no single formula is adequate. One thing is certain; 
general well-being predisposes to laughter. Healthy in- 
fants and many adults burst into laughter for almost no 
reason at all. Notable, too, is the fact that we seldom 
laugh when we ourselves are injured, ridiculed, or in any 
way discomfited—when the joke ison us. A suddenly 
discerned evidence of our own power or superiority, as 
by. outwitting a rival, observing another’s chagrin or em- 
barrassment, or by perceiving our own quick wit in 
seeing through a joke, usually provokes laughter.  Thisy 
would link mirth with mastery, a strong native impulse, ) 
as we shall see later. 
Avoiding Reactions.—Under this heading may be ins 
cluded a number of native responses.such.as jerking away ° 
a member of the body which. has been: stung, bitten, 
seratched, burned or otherwise hurt; winking,: spitting, 1
-P-A-G-E-155
140 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
sneezing, coughing and vomiting—responses made to ir- 
ritations of one sort or another. Dodging, throwing up 
the arms, shrinking, cowering, hiding, standing stockstill, 
and fleeing are instinctive responses to certain things seen 
or heard, particularly to large or strange objects or 
events, such as a beast, a rolling stone, thunder and 
lightning. The emotion of fear, which will be discussed 
more fully in the next chapter, is often experienced in 
response to such situations. 
Overcoming Obstruction.—It is characteristic of chil- 
dren and adults to desire to go about their play or work 
without interference. To any kind of obstruction the 
native reaction is the arousal of an impulse, usually 
coupled with vigorous activity, directed toward the re- 
moval of the obstacle. A child’s toy which will not work, 
a door which will not open, a block of wood which will not 
split, a thicket which will not permit passage—all such 
impediments provoke instinctive impulses and acts to 
overcome them. So commands and restrictions, in so far 
as they interfere with activities under way, tend to arouse 
resistance. There is, then, at least one native tendency 
that operates in opposition to the development of “habits 
of obedience.” 
The tendency to overcome obstruction and interference 
was shown in an interesting way in a laboratory experi- 
ment, in which a subject engaged in the task of typewrit- 
ing was subjected to a number of distractions, such ag 
the sounds of buzzers and bells, or sudden changes in il- 
lumination. He was at once aroused to overcome such 
interferences. His pulse ran up, his brow was wrinkled, 
teeth were clenched, the keys were pounded harder than 
usual, and in most instances the typing was kept up to 
the average, although more energy than usual was 
consumed.
-P-A-G-E-156
INVENTORY OF IMPULSES AND ACTIVITIES 141 
Mastery or Self-Assertion—The child attempts to. 
overcome obstruction, interference and domination, but 
this is not all; he seeks positively to dominate people and - 
things, a tendency which is native. He likes his blocks 
to stay put, his horn to blow, his dog to come when called, 
his playmates to follow orders. Adults have the same im- 
pulse to be master of the situation. To climb a tall tree 
or to chop one down, to breast a strong current, to 
“break” a spirited horse, to litt a huge weight, to down 
an opponent in wrestling, to swing a big deal or boss a 
crew of men, are forms of gratification of the impulse to 
mastery. To succeed in any such undertaking is satisfy- 
ing quite apart from prizes, social approval, or any other 
form of reward. : 
Fighting.—The tendency to overcome obstructions to, 
or interference with, an activity under way is a close kin 
of the impulse actively to seek domination, and both are 
related to pugnacity. Think of a boy building a play- 
house. If all goes well, each nail driven and each board 
affixed satisfies his impulse of mastery, and the thought 
of the completed house is a stimulus to his self-assertion. 
Let some of the boards split or some of the nails bend, 
and the boy is aroused to overcome these obstructions to 
progress. If things go from bad to worse, swelling rage 
may lead to a fighting attack in which the structure is 
utterly demolished. Or, with things going well enough, 
if another boy interferes by word or deed, disregarding 
commands to desist, he may be the object of attack. The 
stimulus to fighting is an interference with an activity 
under way. The pugnacious attack is simply the most 
violent form of the effort to overcome an obstruction in 
the path of one’s action, and inasmuch as it is the last 
resort, it is a less frequent reaction. 
Is fighting engaged in for its own sake?’ It would seem
-P-A-G-E-157
142 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
to be among dogs, cats and other animals. An investi- 
gator who followed the activities of boys’ gangs found 
individual “free for all” and inter-gang fights to be almost 
universal. Of course, fighting is generally discouraged 
and punished, although we still need jails for offenders. 
Although instinctive rough and tumble attack is usually 
brought under control, the pugnacious impulse persists. 
Instead of with tooth and nail, we may learn to attack 
with cutting remarks, piercing looks, or with annihilating 
thoughts only, but in these acts the pugnacious tendency 
is revealed even among the most sophisticated adults. - 
Submission.—Submission is the antithesis of the tend 
encies to overcome opposition, to secure mastery and 
to fight. Forced submission to an obstinate obstruction 
or to a superior opponent is common enough, but it is not 
an instinctive satisfier. It is characterized by such be- 
havior as weeping, anger, chagrin, envy, jealousy, shame 
or embarrassment. Frequently, however, there appears 
an impulse to submit when submission seems to be in~ 
stinctively satisfying. The situation which provokes 
submission is one which obviously cannot be mastered. 
Thus the child may be submissive to the adult, the adult 
to a wiser or more influential person, or to society as a 
whole. Admiration, awe, reverence, veneration, “hero 
worship,” are indicative of willing submission. Univer- 
sal tendencies to be awed by, as well as to venerate and 
idolize unusual, unintelligible or powerful natural phe- 
nomena, such as winds, thunder, or the sun, perhaps are 
rooted in submission as well as in fear. 
Collecting and Hoarding—The child tends to ap- 
proach objects which attract his attention, pick them up, 
manipulate them and carry them away. There is more 
here than mere desire for sensory satisfaction and ma- 
nipulation; there is a. native impulse to collect and hoard
-P-A-G-E-158
- INVENTORY OF IMPULSES AND ACTIVITIES 143 
for its own sake. The boy collects cigar bands, stamps, 
picture cards, and other trifles, as may be observed in the 
advertisements of papers or magazines for young people. 
While the type of materials collected changes with age, 
the impulse persists. However useless our collections 
may be, mere possession is satisfying; however huge, we \ 
covet more, because the impulse to collect and store away / 
is rarely satiated. 
Instinctive RESPONSES TO THE PRESENCE AND ACTIVI- 
+ TIEs or OrHER Human BeErncs C 
/ The tendencies to be listed under this heading are often 
éalled social instincts, because of their intimate relation to 
the organization of social institutions. We have just de- 
scribed certain tendencies, such as those to overcome ob- 
struction, to. secure mastery, to fight, and to submit, 
which may have as their stimulus the presence and ac- 
tivities of human beings as wel] as other objects and 
events. The dividing lines between the three groups of 
instincts are obviously not sharp. In mastery, submis- 
sion, fighting, and markedly in mating tendencies, organic 
conditions, as well as percepts of external situations, are 
involved in activating the states of readiness for the 
consummatory reactions. 
‘In this group of more specifically social tendencies, the 
following will be mentioned: 
Parental behavior 
Mating behavior 
‘Gregariousness 
. Desire for social approval; avoidance of scorn 
Parental Behavior.—Most animal species show definite 
forms of parental behavior; among mammals, the mother 
most clearly. The sow with its litter, the hen with its
-P-A-G-E-159
144. PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
brood are familiar examples. In these cases the elaborate 
mothering tendencies are mainly unlearned, and most 
authorities believe that the maternal impulses of humans 
are equally native. 
The normal stimulus is the helpless infant, although 
the organic condition of the mother for a time following 
childbirth doubtless sharpens the instinctive appeal. At 
any time, however, the presence of an infant tends to 
produce smiling, patting, and other kindly behavior. To 
the child’s every act, its coos and gurgles, smiles, cries of 
pain, fear or hunger, ready responses are made. The 
spontaneity of the protective reactions of parents for off- 
spring have been noted and lauded for many species. 
Among human mothers, few impulses are capable of pro- 
ducing equal sacrifices. 
The impulse to protect and comfort the young becomes 
readily attached to other people, animals, or objects, par- 
ticularly the helpless or suffering, and so it becomes a 
motive for general good will. Societies for the preven- 
tion of cruelty to animals, or of child labor, for the relief 
of suffering in foreign lands; public institutions for the 
homeless, crippled, blind, feebleminded, and so on, are 
evidences of the parental impulses. 
The Mating Instinct—The mating instinct reaches 
maturity relatively late, although evidences of its exist- 
ence are apparent soon after birth. Organic conditions 
contribute to the arousal of the mating impulses, a fact 
made obvious by the periodic excitement of animals, 
A great deal has been written of late by certain schools 
of pseudo-psychologists concerning the power of. the 
mating instinct for good and evil. The statements of 
some that the sex instinct is the most powerful motive in 
human behavior is a vast exaggeration. The impulses to 
secure food, air, or water, would certainly be more power-
-P-A-G-E-160

-P-A-G-E-161
146 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
by means of personal appearance, clothes, relatives, social 
connections, wealth, achievement in business, politics, so- 
ciety, athletics, philanthropy, or by wit, generosity, 
humor, aloofness, and in other ways too diverse to 
recount. Lacking superiority in skill or valor, social vir- 
tues, personal appearance or intellectual accomplishment, 
one may resort to fine clothes, fine manners, fine talk, 
extravagance, boasting or arrogance. 
“As approval is a keen satisfier, so social disapproval 
‘may make life intolerable. Our sensitivity to facial 
- blemishes or bodily disfigurement, the misery occasioned 
by a social blunder or a public criticism, are as intense as 
they are irrational. We are disturbed even if a dog or a 
tramp acts disapprovingly. A Zurich psychiatrist has 
developed a conviction that many nervous and mental 
disorders are the results of the continuous disapproval 
which physical defects or deficiencies may bring. Some 
people are much less susceptible than others to social 
scorn or disapproval, and of those who are very sus- 
ceptible, but few are likely to become mentally unbalanced 
on that account. : 
In many instances, the impulses to secure social ap- 
proval and avoid scorn are similar to the impulses to 
secure mastery and avoid domination. Both may, in fact, 
be operating at the same time, but there is a difference 
between them. One may check his self-assertive tendency 
to a point of submission or humility in order to be con- 
sidered “nice,” although here the desire for social ap- 
proval is conceivably the mastering impulse in disguise. 
On the other hand—and here the distinction is clearer—a 
man may dominate his wife and family, or his school 
room, so severely as to bring the disapproval of all who 
observe, yet the hard master may enjoy the réle. In the 
case of bullies on the school ground or elsewhere, the im.-
-P-A-G-E-162

pulse to self-assertion may run counter to the impulse to 
secure social approval. : 
Mentat States AND Activities, Native AND ACQUIRED 
- We are born with the sensory and nervous structures 
which are the organs of conscious states. Sensations such 
as red, cold, and sweet are experienced at birth and are 
therefore native, but the perceptions of things and rela- 
tions—boxes, shoes, fruit, or distance, number, weight— 
are acquired. The bases for-such acquisitions, our re- 
ceiving, connecting and responding mechanisms, are of 
course native, but just what percepts are built up depends 
upon our environment and training. So with memories, 
ideas, beliefs, images; all are, in the same sense, acquired. 
Impulses.—Impulses are both native and acquired} 
Every instinct has its impulses, and in general, the na- 
tive impulses are more stable, less readily modified than 
the motor responses which go with them. The emotions 
of fear, anger, and joyfulness, and similar states, such as 
excitement, are native, since they appear at birth, and. 
all are permanent. Lust develops later, but it is prob- 
ably native. Whether sympathy, envy, jealousy and 
lonesomeness, elation and many others are primary, or 
whether they are fusions or reorganizations of those above 
is not known with certainty. Any emotion may come 
through experience to be aroused by stimuli that did no 
instinctively arouse it. It is native to be afraid, but not 
to fear an electric wire. The act of fearing is unlearned, 
but what we fear in many cases is the result of experience. 
Mental, Activity and Learning—Manipulation, col- 
lecting and hoarding, eating, fighting, and other native 
activities, we found, were satisfying for their own sake, 
without regard to the utility or result which they might
-P-A-G-E-163
148 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
accomplish. Mental activity, just to have sensations, for 
example, is likewise intrinsically satisfying. In additioxi 
to their intrinsic effects, manipulation, collecting, having 
sensations and other activities may be the means by 
which other impulses are satisfied. Among the latter is 
curiosity, without doubt a native trait which shows itself 
in a great many activities. The child likes to manipulate 
in general, but he likes especially to manipulate a new, 
at least a relatively new object. The novel arouses his 
curiosity, and during the course of manipulation, new 
percepts, ideas, and skill may be acquired. He is doing 
more than merely manipulating; he is exploring with his 
eyes, ears or other senses as the object permits. The new 
picture book provides for visual exploration; the music 
box, auditory; the flower, visual and olfactory, and the 
fruit, gustatory. No matter what the object may be, the 
child will probably apply eye, ear, hand, tongue and nose 
to it. In these exploratory activities, we find the be- 
ginning of the instinctive impulse to learn, to acquire in- 
formation and skill. The child seeks the novel thing or 
sitiiation which offers the widest opportunity for learning. 
Having satisfactorily mastered one device, he lays it 
aside for others which offer opportunity for fresh experi- 
ence. To comprehend, see through, adapt oneself to new 
objects and situations, in a word, to learn through experi- | 
ence is a strong and, needless to say, important human/ 
tendency. . 
Curiosity.—While it is correct to say that curiosity is. 
a native trait, the term does not cover the field of learn- , 
ing adequately. The tendency to seek the novel is one; 
instance of the impulse to learn. To acquire skill, new 
percepts, to memorize, to solve problems, to reason, all of 
these are forms of learning and each is by original nature 
satisfying for its own sake. Of course, there are age and
-P-A-G-E-164
INVENTORY OF IMPULSES AND ACTIVITIES 149 
individual preferences and circumstances which influence 
the impulses. The satisfaction in learning is increased by 
successful accomplishment, perhaps by giving play to the 
mastery impulse, and decreased by failure. Too much 
monotony, too long or too difficult tasks, and the com- 
peting impulses to eat, rest, or physical activity may be 
unfavorable to school learning, but it is important to 
realize that interest in learning is never wholly or even 
mainly derived from ulterior motives; it is satisfying for 
its own sake. 
Native SATISFIERS AND ANNOYERS 
Studies of human and animal behavior disclose the fact 
that, even shortly after birth, before the individual has. 
had much opportunity to learn, certain states of affairs. 
are sought, and when attained are maintained, at least 
fora time. Other conditions are avoided, or at least some 
attempt.at avoidance appears. The hungry cow seeks 
grass and having obtained it, proceeds to eat until sati- 
ated, whereas it will disregard bread or meat. The dog, 
on the contrary, seems to be satisfied by meat or bread, 
but usually disregards grass. Ducks and geese seek water 
and revel in it, whereas chickens and eats are disinclined 
to a bath and try to escape when they are introduced to 
water. Dogs take readily to human companions with a 
devotion that cats seldom show. Lambs gambol with 
each other in a way that tigers-seldom do. Each species 
has its own inclinations and disinclinations that seem te) 
be inborn and modifiable only within limits. 
The human species has its set of desires and aversions. 
We like dogs and cats better than snakes and toads. We 
take to foods which taste sweet and avoid those which 
taste bitter. On the whole, we prefer harmonious sounds
-P-A-G-E-165
150 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
to harsh sounds, the odors of fresh fruit to the odors of 
decayed fruit, sunlight to’ darkness, air of moderate tem- 
perature and humidity to air extreme in these respects, 
soft textures next the body to harsh textures. Really, 
there is no very good or ultimate reason why we prefer 
some things or conditions to others. Our choices, in thes 
instances, are not reasoned or intelligent, but instinctive) 
We were born to like some things and dislike others. / 
Different species differ in their attractions and aver-\ 
sions, or likes and dislikes, because their birthright is! 
different. As William James says: “Why does the hen, 
for example, submit herself to the tedium of incubating 
such a fearfully uninteresting set of objects as a nestful of 
eggs? Why do men always lie down, when they can, on 
soft beds rather than on hard floors? Why do they sit 
round the stove on a cold day? Why, in a room, do they 
place themselves, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, with 
their faces toward its middle rather than toward the wall? 
Why do they prefer saddle of mutton and champagne to 
hard-tack and ditch-water? Why does the maiden interest, 
the youth so that everything about her seems more im- 
portant and significant than anything else in the world? 
Nothing more can be said than that these are human 
ways, and that every creature likes its own ways, and 
takes to them as a matter of course ... it is not for the 
sake of their utility that they are followed, but because at 
the moment of following them we feel that that is the 
only appropriate and natural thing todo . . . to the ani- 
mal which obeys it, every impulse and every step of every 
instinct shines with its own sufficient light, and seems at 
the moment the only eternally right and proper thing to 
do. It is done for its own sake exelusively. ... To 
the broody hen the notion would probably seem mon- 
strous that there should be a creature in the world to
-P-A-G-E-166
INVENTORY OF IMPULSES AND ACTIVITIES 151 
whom a nestful of eggs was not the utterly fascinating 
and precious and never-to-be-too-much-sat-upon object 
which it is to her... .” 
The Inner Conditions corresponding to Satisfying 
and Annoying States of Affairs—Animals have their 
likes and dislikes, but whether their experiences during 
attraction or aversion are anything like ours, is a problem 
yet unsolved. In a previous chapter it was pointed out 
that some of the introspective psychologists have assumed 
that the feelings of pleasantness and unpleasantness are 
primary conscious states. Some believe that the con- 
scious state, pleasantness, invariably accompanies the ex- 
periences that are sought and cherished, and that un- 
pleasantness accompanies the states of affairs that the 
individual attempts to avoid. While it is probably true _ 
that pleasantness goes with tendencies to cherish or cling 
to, and unpleasantness with a tendency to turn away or 
avoid, in the case of human adults, there is no certainty 
that the hen, the fly, and other creatures—indeed, there is 
no certainty that human infants—experience the same or 
even similar conscious states. There is a need of tech- 
nical terminology here which will cover the facts without 
implying necessarily what the introspective psychologist 
calls pleasantness or unpleasantness. 
Thorndike has suggested for this purpose the terms 
satisfying and annoying, or satisfying states of affairs and 
annoying states of affairs. “By a satisfying state of af-. 
fairs is meant roughly one which the animal does nothing 
to avoid, often doing such things as attain and preserve it. : 
By an annoying state of affairs is meant roughly one: 
which the animal avoids or changes.” These definitions; 
it will be noted, are given in terms of what a man or 
animal does, not in terms of states of consciousness. They 
are generalizations based upon the objective study of hu-
-P-A-G-E-167
152 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
man and animal behavior, not upon introspections of 
mental states. : 
It is quite probable, however, that the satisfying state 
of affairs is generally, if not always, experienced as con- 
sciously pleasant, and annoying states of affairs as un- 
pleasant, in the case of human subjects. The conscious 
states and the observed behavior of avoiding, on the one 
hand, and attaining and preserving, on the other, are 
probably related to more fundamental, but as yet, un- 
known organic conditions. Annoyingness is probably in- - 
dicative of one kind of subtle condition or change in the 
neurones; satisfyingness is a symptom of another kind of 
condition or change. What these conditions or changes 
are is as yet unknown although there have been many 
speculations. The concept of satisfying and annoying 
states of affairs, while not explicable on the neurological 
side, is.so well justified by study of observable behavior, 
indeed, it is so invariably essential to the explanation of 
observable activity, that it must be accepted as one of our 
fundamental “working hypotheses.” 
Our hypothesis, briefly stated, is as follows. Original 
nature is such that certain conditions satisfy and other 
conditions annoy. The basis of satisfaction and annoy>. 
ance is probably some fundamental organic or neural con- 
dition or change. In the case of human individuals at, 
least, one symptom, although perhaps not an invariablé 
symptom, of one type of inner condition is the conscious 
experience of pleasantness, while a symptom of another 
type of inner condition is unpleasantness. The symptoms 
of the inner conditions which we may observe in another 
person, are, in one case, the tendencies to continue in or 
repeat the activity which produces that inner state, 
whereas in the other ease, there are tendencies to end or 
avoid the activities or conditions which cause that inner
-P-A-G-E-168
INVENTORY OF IMPULSES AND ACTIVITIES, 153 
state. The one condition, we may for convenience ‘speak - w 
of as a satisfying state of affairs, the other as.an annoying ~ 
state of-affairs. . 
The Relation of Instincts to Satisfiers and Annoyers. 
—Study of human instincts throws light upon conditions 
that satisfy and annoy. Instincts, we found, consist of 
mechanisms which are activated by stimuli arising in an 
external situation or in an inner bodily condition. The 
stimulus arouses a state of readiness or an, ‘drge. to a 
further or consummatory response. We have. “observed, 
that to eat when hungry, to rest when tired, to secre so- 
cial approval, or to overcome an obstruction, is satisfying, 
whereas to fail to secure food, rest, social approval, or to : 
remove the obstacle is annoying. We may cover these. 
and other facts of the present and preceding chapter by 
the following generalizations: (1).When an instinct is 
ready to act, for it to act is satisfying. (2) When an in- 
stinet is ready to act, for it not to act is annoying. (3) 
When an instinct is unready to act, for it to act is _ 
annoying. - 
Of the first two generalizations, abundant illustrations 
have already been given; of the last, a few will be suffi- 
cient. Instincts are not always ready to act. When one 
is satiated with food, one is unready to eat, one will at- 
tempt to avoid eating. That is, when unready to eat, to 
be forced to eat is annoying. When one is unready to 
engage in physical activity, to sleep, to rest, to be ap- 
proved, to fight, to be among other humans, or to act in 
some other way, to be forced to do so is annoying. 
These are the fundamental generalizations of dynamic 
psychology, that branch of the science which treats of 
the effects of forces in producing action and the laws of 
action thus produced. Each instinctive tendency has its 
influerice in favoring some lines of activity and opposing
-P-A-G-E-169
154 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
others. It is the relation of an act to states of instinctiv 
readiness and unreadiness which determines in a large’ 
measure whether the act shall be repeated and thus. 
learned, or whether it shall be avoided and thus fail to. 
survive. Thus much of human learning is directed and 
determined by our original equipment of reaction 
tendencies.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE EMOTIONS 
Any of the instinctive responses, described in the last 
chapter, could have been broken up into several com- 
ponents. In addition to the conscious awareness of the 
stimulus, we could identify: (1) movements of skeletal. 
muscles, such as running, striking, defending; (2) facial 
expressions, such as the disgusted, angry, or fearful look; 
(3) activities of smooth muscles in the arteries, stomach, 
and other internal organs; (4) activities of the duct 
glands, such as the sweat, lachrymal, or gastric; and (5) 
activities of the endocrine glands, such as the thyroid or 
adrenal, In the main, the descriptions of instincts were 
limited to the gross bodily acts, but actually nearly every 
situation which aroused outward acts also aroused 
changes in the inner, hidden activities of the smooth 
muscles and glands. 
Derinition or THE Term Emotion 
The body is well supplied with sense organs and sen- 
sory nerves by means of which the inner (or organic) re- 
sponses may be felt. That is to say, sensations may be 
aroused by the activities of the organism; we may feel our 
reactions as well as the stimuli which arouse them. The 
ordinary smooth-running bodily activities, such as respi- 
ration, circulation, digestion, and moderate activities of 
the skeletal or facial muscles are not conspicuously con-

scious. We become adapted to them as we do to the 
pressure of our clothes, the noises of the street, or the odor 
of our dwelling. But a stimulus, such as the sight of a 
snake, may cause a contraction of muscles, an increase in 
heart action, hurried breathing, and other inner changes, 
which become vividly conscious. When the bodily re- 
sponse is rather profound and widespread, involving par- 
ticularly the visceral and glandular mechanisms, the re- 
sulting complex of sensations is called an emotion.* 
Notice that emotion, as a psychological term, refers to 
the state of consciousness; that is, to the complex of sen- 
sations and not to the bodily activities themselves. Al- 
most every stimulus to which we react outwardly arouses 
inner responses to some degree, although the organic 
reverberation may be very slight in many cases. If to a 
subject comfortably seated, slight odors, tastes, tactual 
stimuli, or meaningful words are presented, very delicate 
instruments will record slight changes in respiration, 
blood pressure, and glandular activities. But these inner 
changes are often too slight to become vividly conscious ; 
the subject is unaware of their existence. Only those or- 
ganic changes which are rather vividly felt are called 
‘emotions. 
The term emotion, however, is not applied to the feel- 
ing of relatively simple or readily localized activities such 
as hunger, thirst, the burning or gnawing of indigestion, 
nausea, suffocation, or palpitation of the heart; nor do we 
speak of one kind of bodily sensation, however diffuse, 
such as general muscular fatigue, fever, or chills as an 
emotion, although the latter is an approximation. No, 
the genuine emotions, such as fear and rage, are much 
more diffuse, mixed, unanalyzable groups of sensations 
than any of these. They represent changes which per-

“vade the whole body, and among them the. smooth. muscle 
and glandular changes which are controlled by the auto- - 
-nomic-nervous system are most conspicuous. In fact, un- 
légs‘an experience possesses a-considerable organic rever- 
beration—strained or irregular breathing, palpitations of 
the heart, flushings and palings, quivers, sinking feelings 
in the stomach, tensions of the arteries, and other changes 
. especially in the viscera—we do not speak of the mental 
state as an emotion at all. 
Tue Ovurwarp “Expressions” oF THE EMOTION 
, We recognize general bodily postures that are charac- 
teristic of certain emotions: we speak of being rigid with 
fear, bent with grief, or puffed-up with pride. The ex- 
pressions of the emotions appear more uniformly, in 
patterns of response of the facial. muscles. That many 
of them have an instinctive basis is indicated by the fact 
that they are, so far as may be observed, universal and 
fairly constant reactions. If the reader will observe the 
pilates (Fig. 21) he will be able to identify most. of the 
emotions “expressed,” although the face is unfamiliar, 
d much, such as color and movement, is lacking. 
-The-emotional expressions may serve the purpose of 
influencing the behavior of other organisms. The display 
of teeth, and other angry expressions along with hissing, 
‘growling, barking, etc., may be conceived as instinctive 
‘forms of “bluffing” which may -frighten off smaller or 
less courageous opponents. Notice the transformation in 
size and ferociousness of appearance of a cat when men- 
xfeed-by. a strange dog. Similarly the human expressions 
“derision, scorn, disgust may modify the acts of others, 
ling, or a “sad expression,” although their origin is 
re, invite kindly and sympathetic behavior. The 
         
  plex,
-P-A-G-E-177

erect, puffed-up attitude of pride may beget admiration 
or submission. 
The wide-open eyes in wonder or surprise are an adjust- 
ment which provides a wide range of vision. The nar- 
rowed eyes in anger are a kind of visual concentration on 
the object of attack, while the puckering of brow and 
closing of lids serve to protect these vital organs from in- 
jury. The slowing of breathing, in the first stages of fear, 
provides for more adequate hearing. Sniffing and prick- 
ing up of the ears in animals are sensory adjustments to 
slight stimulation. Much of the expression of an emotion, 
then, is the result of sensory adjustments. 
Gritting and display of the teeth in anger among ani- 
mals are motor adjustments for attack. Humans, under 
primitive conditions, may have used their teeth as 
weapohs; the tenseness of muscles about the jaw is a re- 
sult probably of these adjustments. The widened nostrils 
in fear or anger permit more effective breathing; clenching 
the fists and other muscular tensions have obvious utility. 
The bristling of hair about the neck and other preparatory 
reactions of animals belong here, too. The turning aside 
and wry face in disgust probably originated in the infant’s 
response to undesired food or to noxious odors. The ex- 
pressions under emotion, then, are in part the result of ad- 
justments for motor response to the exciting object. 
Tus Nerve Conrrou or THE INTERNAL 
Emortionat CHANGES 
The internal changes which provide the major portion 
of the sensations that constitute the emotion are under 
the control of the autonomic system. The nerves of thé 
system, connected through synapses with motor 
which issue from the spinal | cord and brain stem, ar 
fal emotior 
Ahers.        
-P-A-G-E-178
THE EMOTIONS 161 
ject to nerve impulses received from the central nervous 
system. By means of inborn connections, the organic ac- 
tivities may be accelerated or retarded by pains, noises, 
odors, or other forms of external stimuli. 
The autonomic system is divided into three groups ét 
nerves: 
1. The cranial division, connected with the upper part 
of the cord and mid-brain.. 
2. The sacral division, connected with the lower part of 
the cord. 
3. The sympathetic division, connected with the inter- 
mediate part of the cord. 
The cranial and sacral divisions, although supplying 
different regions, have a similar function which is always 
antagonistic to the funetion of the sympathetic. The 
cranial division depresses the activity of the heart, where- 
as the sympathetic stimulates it to greater activity. The 
cranial increases the glandular and muscular activities of 
digestion in the upper, and the sacral in the lower part of 
the intestines, whereas the sympathetic diminishes these 
activities in both regions. In general, if the cranial or 
sacral division accelerates, the sympathetic depresses; if 
the former inhibits, the latter stimulates; that is, they 
are antagonistic. 
Since the divisions of the autonomic bring about differ- 
ent internal reactions, the emotional states which go with 
them must be distinctive. This, in fact, is the case: the 
sympathetic is involved in the strong emotions of which 
fear and anger are the best examples; the cranial and 
part of the sacral division go with mild, pleasant states, 
such as general bodily comfort and pleasure; while part 
of the sacral is concerned in lust and sex excitement. 
The sympathetic system, although tremendously com- 
plex, embracing nerves discharging into nearly all of the
-P-A-G-E-179
162 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
smooth muscle and glandular mechanisms, acts very much 
as a unit. The innervations may be slight or profound 
but in either case the effects are widespread. The cranial 
and sacral divisions do not act invariably as units; they 
permit of specific innervations of the different bodily 
organs. 
INTERNAL CHANGES IN THE Stronc EMOTIONS 
Marked changes in the digestive and assimilative func- 
tions are brought about by innervations of the sympa- 
thetic system which oceur in fear and anger. If a cat 
which has been fed a meal of gruel containing bismuth, a 
substance opaque to X-rays, is placed before the screen of 
a fluoroscope, the normal rhythmic, churning movements 
of the stomach can be clearly observed. If the cat is 
angered by a barking dog, these movements (of peristal- 
sis, so-called) may be greatly diminished; in fact, they 
often cease altogether. Fiven in milder vexation, such as 
that produced by tying a small stick to the cat’s leg, the 
stomach movements may be inhibited. The glandular 
activities of digestion are similarly diminished or stopped. 
the flow of saliva may stop, producing the dry mouth 
characteristic of fear, rage, or nervousness. The secre- 
tion of gastric juice is similarly diminished. In a typ- 
ical experiment on an angered dog, instead of the usual 
65 or 70 cubic centimeters of gastric juice, less than 9 
cubic centimeters (and this of poor quality) were secreted. 
Thus the whole digestive process is side-tracked. 
What purpose could all of this serve? None is very 
apparent save this—the elimination of the work of di-. 
gestion liberates a good deal of energy that may be other- 
wise utilized: That such energy is conserved for strenu- 
ous muscular action is probable.
-P-A-G-E-180
THE EMOTIONS 163 
With anger or fear go also pronounced circulatory 
changes due to sympathetic discharge. The heart beats 
more rapidly and with greater amplitude. The arteries 
of the abdomen are constricted, thus driving large 
amounts of blood to other parts of the body, mainly to 
the skin, skeletal muscles, brain, and lungs. The con- 
striction of arteries, together with increased heart action, 
produces a higher blood pressure and more effective cir- 
culation through the organs involved in bodily action. 
The lungs are stimulated to greater activity; breathing 
becomes deeper and more rapid. Sweat breaks out on the 
skin, making an early start toward the elimination of heat 
from the body engaged in strenuous exertion. The sym- 
pathetic fibres also activate the adrenal glands whose se- 
cretion, adrenalin, poured into the rapidly circulating 
blood promptly reaches the various bodily organs and 
profoundly affects many of them. 
As do the impulses of the sympathetic system, adrena- 
lin diminishes the glandular and muscular activities of di- 
gestion, constricts the abdominal arteries, and stimulates 
the heart and lungs. It increases and prolongs the more 
prompt effects of the sympathetic nerves, and produces 
several additional changes. Reaching the lungs, adrenalin 
causes a dilation of small smooth muscles, which permits 
more ready ventilation, thus providing for a more speedy 
assimilation of oxygen and discharge of the products of 
fatigue. Adrenalin has a specific effect on skeletal 
muscles, greatly increasing their sensitivity to nerve im- 
pulses, which results in greater strength and endurance. 
Adrenalin causes the liver to pour into the blood more 
rapidly its store of blood sugar, the fuel which is burned 
in muscular work and also causes the liver to secrete a 
substance which makes blood clot more rapidly on reach- 
ing the air, thus reducing the flow in case of an injury.

Tur Emercency THrEorY oF THE EMOTIONS 
Other organic changes, characteristic of fear and anger, 
could be mentioned; but this, at least, is already appar- 
ent—the body is adjusted during emotion to provide for 
the greatest muscular strength and endurance. On the 
basis of this fact, an American physiologist, W. B. 
Cannon, has framed what he calls The Emergency 
Theory of the Emotions. The sympathetic system is 
conceived as an elaborate check and drive mechanism 
that is thrown into gear by events which demand im- 
mediate and energetic action; that is, by emergencies. 
Under primitive conditions, loud or sudden sounds, the 
perception of wild beasts, unfamiliar men, obstinate 
obstructions, and other objects or conditions which 
arouse fear or anger, represent situations in which physi- 
cal strength and endurance, as in the fight or flight, may 
enable the organism to survive. It matters relatively 
little that digestion is inhibited, the heart or lungs over- 
worked, if the animal successfully meets the emergency. | 
The organic responses, then, are preparatory reactions 
—elaborate mobilizations for violent and prolonged 
physical action. The emotions of fear and anger, as 
conscious states, are, in the main, the sensations occa- 
sioned by these inner changes. 
CLASSIFICATION OF THE EMOTIONS 
The sympathetic system, it was said, is antagonistic to 
the functions of the cranial and sacral autonomic. 
Innervations of the latter tend in general to promote the 
quiet, normal organie processes of digestion, assimilation 
and_excretion—the quiet service of building up bodily 
resources. Stimulation of certain nerves of the cranial
-P-A-G-E-182
  THE EMOTIONS 
division increases the flow of saliva and gastric secretions, 
dilates the blood vessels of the viscera and promotes: the 
action and tone of the stomach and alimentary canal. 
Other nerves of this division slow the heart, thus rest-_ 
ing the cardiac muscles. Certain nerves of the sacral 
division are concerned with the proper regulation of the 
bladder and the lower alimentary canal. 
Innervation of the visceral organs by the cranial and 
sacral nerves tends to arouse quiet, pleasurable emotional 
states for which we have but few names. A comfortable 
state of “well-being” is about all there is to it at times; 
and the mild emotions of mirth, of pleasure in hearing” 
music, of joy in one’s work, in agreeable conversation, 
comradeship . or surroundings, harmonize with the 
upbuilding internal services of the body. Under such 
mild but pleasurable mental states we are best fitted for 
most of the tasks of daily life. 
Aside, then, from the sex emotions and the mild, 
pleasurable states of well-being which go with the action 
’ of nerves in the cranial and sacral autonomic, all other 
genuine emotions, so far as is known, result from 
innervations of the sympathetic system. 
The emotions which are known to go with sympathetic 
action may be listed in several groups: 
1. Anger, and other similar states, such as rage, fury, 
vexation, irritation, revenge, and perhaps jealousy 
- and scorn 
2. Fear, and similar states, such as dread, anxiety, 
worry, melancholy, terror and perhaps grief and 
regret 
3. Excitement, shock, uneasiness, nervousness, 
embarrassment 
4, Extreme pity, sympathy, elation, enthusiasm

Other Components of an Emotional Experience.— 
The organic changes which characterize fear, anger, 
excitement, and other states are very much alike, at 
least in the more obvious features. But most people 
find the experience of “being afraid” very different from 
“being angry” or “being excited”; and these differences 
cannot, at the present time, be accounted for by organic 
changes, although it is possible that very important 
physiological variations await discovery. The total 
experience, however, always includes other components * 
which are not emotions but fuse with emotions in a 
unitary state of consciousness. There is the perception 
of the exciting object: in the one case, a wild animal; 
in another, an aggravating man; in a third, a critical 
audience.(There are also memories or anticipations, ideas 
of all kinds which are fused with the persisting organic 
sensations; and to them may be added differences in 
gross bodily attitudes and facial expressions. But per- 
haps most important are the differences in impulses, 
Fear, while organically similar to anger, is accompanied 
by an impulse to escape; anger, by an impulse to attack. 
The impulse is a definite adjustment toward some end— 
to turn and run, to hide or to strike, kick, seize, and 
choke—whereas the emotion is a diffuse group of inner 
changes which fit one of these ends as well as another. 
If two boys are engaged in wrestling, each is subject 
to a general impulse to down the other, and, in the course 
of the contest, to many particular impulses—to hold an 
arm, to twist the neck, etc. There are percepts and other 
ideas, muscular strains, “feelings of effort”; but these 
are not what we mean by an emotion. Suppose that one 
boy, seeing defeat close at hand, loses his temper. If we 
could examine his organic processes, we would find them 
approaching a state of turmoil, which is the basis of the
-P-A-G-E-184
THE EMOTIONS 167 
emotion. Percepts, ideas, impulses, muscular acts, all 
of these are still present, and they may be much the 
same. The now enraged boy is still determined to down 
the other; he is still perceiving the other’s moves and 
thinking of tricks to apply. The emotion per se is 
merely the sensations arising mainly from the internal 
changes. 
Shock and Excitement—Violent inner shock (which 
is due to. very intense sympathetic innervation) or 
excitement represents the sheer organic changes very 
well, since the impulses are often vague and uncertain. 
xcitement thus resembles both fear and anger organi- 
cally, but differs from. both because of the indefiniténess 
of the impulsion.) For example, a sound heard by a 
primitive man prowling in the woods might have aroused 
the sympathetic activities, experienced as excitement or 
uneasy alertness, until the source is more clearly per- 
ceived. If the stimulating object is found to be a fero- 
cious beast, the percept with the impulse to run, added 
to the organic turmoil, constitutes fear; if the stimulus 
proves to be an old enemy, that percept plus the impulse 
to attack gives us the state of anger. The inner changes 
themselves, devoid of percepts, ideas, ‘impulses and: 
muscular adjustments, are felt as various degrees of 
inner turmoil ranging from terrific shock to slight 
excitement. 
Exciting Joy, Enthusiasm, etc.—The violent or excit- 
ing states of mirth, joy, pity, zeal, enthusiasm, and the 
like are included in the list of emotions which depend 
upon the activity of the sympathetic system. Suppose, 
for example, that you are quietly enjoying a concert. 
If the music becomes very stirring, you may experience 
a glow, a pang in the breast, a fulness of breathing, a 
flutter of the heart, a shudder or darting chills, a sinking
-P-A-G-E-185
168 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
sensation in the region of the stomach—evidences of the 
discharge through the sympathetic. Joy, on other occa- 
sions, may become so violent as to produce weeping, 
labored breathing, high blood pressure, and digestive dis- 
turbances. Enthusiasm, especially in people of the 
emotional or excitable type, may become so exciting 
as to make quiet work or thought impossible. Thus, in 
the intense, exciting, or violent form, joy, enthusiasm, 
pity, and others belong in the sympathetic group. 
What, now, about other emotions, of joy, pity, rever- 
ence, gratitude in milder form? The mild but pleasur- 
able states accompanying effective organic and_visceral 
.processes of the upbuilding type have been mentioned. 
But the language abounds with names of additional 
emotional states: wonder, timidity, gratitude, admira- - 
tion, suspicion, coyness, pride, hope—what of them? Most 
of them are, in scientific literalness, not emotions at all; 
they represent impulses or activities which may or may 
not be accompanied or followed by emotions. Wonder 
and timidity represent conditions of conflicting impulses, 
to approach and to recede, along with various percepts 
and ideas and motor acts without any marked organic 
change. The organic changes in pride, hope, coyness, 
and admiration may be nearly negligible; that is, these 
states are not themselves primarily emotions, although 
when thwarted or exaggerated (as is the case with other 
impulses) the emotion may arise. When these impulses 
are accompanied by sufficient inner disturbances to make 
the term emotion applicable, it usually means the action 
of the sympathetic system. 
The violent emotions, then, represent preparatory 
reactions in the form of mobilizations of organic and 
visceral resources for the maximum physical exertion. 
Under conditions of primitive life in the jungle, their
-P-A-G-E-186

utility in contending with human or animal enemies, 
with storms, floods and natural forces would be apparent. 
In modern life, they might be of service in similar 
exigencies, but ordinarily they begin and end_ without 
the physical exertion for which~they are a preparation. 
We are often angry but seldom fight; often fearful, 
without flight. 
Tus Errecrs or Stronc Emotions 
On Health.—What are the results of emotions, such as 
rage, anxiety or fear, when they are not accompanied 
or followed by physical exertion? Indigestion is one 
result. The angered cat showed stagnation of food in 
the stomach from three to six hours on different occa- 
sions. Among humans anger, excitement, sorrow, and 
extreme joy are often followed by more or less severe 
digestive disturbances. Loss of appetite and weight 
under prolonged sorrow, anxiety, or worry is often 
observed. The blood sugar liberated by the liver when 
not utilized as muscular fuel is partly wasted by excre- 
tion through the kidneys. The general wear and tear 
on the heart and arteries, the adrenal and other organs 
which are driven to excessive action during the strong 
emotions, may in the long run be injurious. | At least, 
it is commonly believed that the excitement, worry, fear, 
anger, and irritations of life hasten the breakdown of 
the visceral functions and it is well known that diseases 
or deficiencies of these functions are greatly aggravated 
by emotional disturbances. 
On Skill, Thought and Ability to Learn.—However 
greatly crude strength may be increased under the strong 
emotions, anger, fear, or excitement, efficiency in acts 
of skill, in judgment and reasoning, and in learning is
-P-A-G-E-187

decreased. The excited or angered baseball player 
fumbles the ball. The frightened youth forgets his 
“piece.”. An inventory of the experiences of skilled 
musicians disclosed an almost universal conviction that 
any exciting emotion aroused by the audience, or even 
an emotion normally aroused by the music itself, is 
detrimental to proficiency. Even in boxing, where 
strength assuredly counts, it is well known that skill is 
disrupted by rage. In golf, tennis, and other sports 
requiring great precision, the disastrous effects of anger, 
chagrin, nervousness, and anxiety are patent. 
Thinking, reasoning, judgment are, like skill, disturbed 
by the strong emotions. In melancholy, ordinary tasks 
or debts look herculean. Frightened by a cry of “Fire!” 
the audience falls into an irrational panic; the drowning 
man strangles the swimmer who attempts a rescue. Even 
for murder, the leniency of the jury is generally assured 
if the act was committed in a passion. Violent emotions 
represent, in effect, internal preparations for violent acts, 
and even the less intense grief, fear, vexation, or excite- 
ment may lead to thoughts, words, or acts that seem 
unwarranted or ridiculous in calmer moments. In 
laboratory studies, although violent emotions are seldom 
secured, the general tendency of the milder ones to dis- 
turb acts of thought or skill appears clearly. Such tasks 
as tracing the outline of a pattern which is observed only 
by reflection from a mirror (mirror-drawing) or perform- 
ing a difficult feat in mental arithmetic are retarded and 
sometimes disrupted by vexation, anger, chagrin, anxiety, 
or even by too exciting enthusiasm. It is characteristic 
of the novice to be subject to frequent emotional upsets. 
As the learning progresses, greater poise is achieved. 
Generally speaking, the highly efficient performance is 
characterized by a quiet alertness and unemotional 
«
-P-A-G-E-188
THE EMOTIONS 171 
zeal rather than by excitement or emotional en- 
thusiasm. / 
On Stimulating Activity—The notion that the strong 
emotions in the routine of life render a tremendous ser- 
vice by providing impulsion to greater accomplishment, 
that they represent the release of hidden springs of 
energy, is likely to be very misleading. That 
they do provide a temporary increase in muscular 
strength we have seen, but this is attained at no small 
cost nor can it be long maintained. The athlete may 
run his quarter mile better if excited (although many 
prefer to be calm), but if he is “on edge” too long before 
the race, he may be half exhausted before it begins. The 
exhausting effects of a public performance by the 
uninitiated, of a frightful or grievous experience, are 
familiar to all. “What,” asks David Belasco, “would be 
the condition of a player who, every night for even one 
week, should really feel all of the emotions of Hamlet 
or Othello or Lear; of Queen Margaret or Lady Macbeth 
or Juliet?” / : 
But is the strong emotion not of great utility as an 
occasional upheaval to arouse us out of complacency 
to fresh resolution and determination, to set the bail 
rolling? If a student feels he is losing his interest in 
his studies—going stale—would not the part of wisdom 
be to arouse somehow in himself profound disgust, ‘or 
anger at his lethargy, or vivid excitement by anticipation 
of the rewards of greater achievement? It would seem 
so; and perhaps the answer would be affirmative if there 
were not better ways. The physician often faces a 
similar situation. The patient reports bodily sluggish- 
ness and loss of grip. While pills or stimulants may be 
prescribed, the physician knows they are but temporary 
expedients which work no permanent cure. The remedy
-P-A-G-E-189
172 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
ies not in drugs but in better hygiene; better habits of 
eating, sleeping, work, and play. The remedy for mental 
inertia is not in emotional stimulation but in improved 
habits of mental hygiene. A strong emotion, acting like 
a drug (for adrenalin and other glandular secretions are 
drugs), has the habit-forming effects of such artificial 
stimulation. If we rely upon coffee to keep us awake, 
shortly coffee is required in increasing doses. If we rely 
this week on emotional outbursts to get us at our tasks, 
we will the more surely require them the next. The 
emotional upheaval is like a drug, strictly an emergency 
measure, to be used only as a last resort, and then 
advisedly. 
Must One Experience aN Emotion IN ORDER 
ro Act Ir? 
Admitting that the strong emotions are not essential 
and usually detrimental to the achievements of modern 
life, are they not essential to certain tasks, such as plead- 
ing in court, preaching, and other public performances? 
Could one make a stirrmg address or, what would seem 
to be more difficult, could one portray an emotion with- 
out really experiencing it himself? The testimony of 
great actors and actresses should furnish an answer to 
this question. 
Many years ago, William James collected the state- 
ments of a number of leading actors and actresses and 
found a division of opinion. Many of the greatest were 
able to portray perfectly the outward appearance of 
emotions in face, posture, gait, and voice without the 
visceral and organic accompaniments on which the emo- 
tion chiefly depends. Others believed they were unable 
to affect the dissociation so completely. The few cases,
-P-A-G-E-190
THE EMOTIONS : 173 
however (if they are correct, observations), are enough to 
show that the inner turmoil is not essential to successful 
dramatization. 
David Belasco, the eminent theatrical producer, has 
a decided opinion on the matter. “To assert that any 
actor must or even can really feel, when acting, all that 
he represents—assuming, of course, that he is represent- 
ing any vital or even vivid emotional experience—is 
merely to maintain what is manifestly nonsensical. In 
acting, there never can be, in the very nature of things, 
any real feeling. . . . Nowhere are complete self-control, 
dominion, poise more absolutely essential to success 
than they are in acting and they cannot exist where 
sensibility is permitted to hold sway.” / 
Mr. Belasco cites a number of anecdotes in support of 
his belief that great actors, even in playing profoundly 
emotional réles, really maintain perfect self-control. For 
example: “One night when playing Othello in America, 
Salvini, as he spoke the final words, ‘no way but this, 
killing myself to die upon a kiss,’ and collapsed in his 
appalling simulation of death, murmured to Miss Viola 
Allen, the player of Desdemona: ‘For the one hundred 
and third and last time this season!’ ” 
Tue Neep or ConrTroL oF THE EMOTIONS 
While it is possible, as actors and actresses testify, to 
portray the facial, bodily, and vocal features of an emo- 
tion without the inner turmoil, the more common 
modification in every-day life is the elimination of the 
outer. expression, while the internal disturbances hold 
sway. We experience anger, fear, or sympathy without 
obvious motor response. Indeed, the emotions may come - 
to be highly satisfying, as in the case of the few who
-P-A-G-E-191
174 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
greedily study the daily paper for fresh incentives to 
grieve idly at the world’s sufferings, rage at its vices, and 
exult at its achievements without contributmg in any 
way to the relief of suffering, to the abolition of vice, or 
to the increase of achievement. The emotions might be 
defended on the ground that they are intensely satisfy- 
ing, that they add to the color and variety of life and 
break up the drab monotony of routine. It would be 
a sorry world for most of us were there no pity, no indig- 
nation, exaltation, or excitement; even fear, anger, and 
grief—under certain circumstances—are satisfying. If 
we can experience, these emotions with little likelihood 
of serious consequences, as we may enjoy fear in a storm- 
tossed ship if assured of safety, or anger and grief from 
scenes on the stage or screen, it is undeniably pleasant, 
as our willingness to pay substantial prices for these 
experiences amply attests. What is needed, of course, 
is temperance and wise control The main dangers lie 
in the possibilities of permitting emotional enjoyment 
to become debauchery or a substitute for action. Not 
only are worthy impulses with less internal turmoil more 
desirable from the standpoint of personal efficiency and 
health, but the world is better served by acts of relieving 
suffering, and resisting oppression than by reactions 
which begin and end wholly in one’s breast. 
GENERAL EMOTIONALITY 
Individuals differ in their general emotional responsive- 
ness. At the one extreme are the calm, stolid, imperturb- 
able individuals; at the other the excitable, sensitive, 
and easily aroused; and from one extreme to the other 
we pass through degrees of emotionality imsensibly 
minute.
-P-A-G-E-192
THE EMOTIONS 175 
The concept of general emotionality is not unlike the 
concept of general athletic ability, general strength, or 
general mental ability. Two people at approximately 
the same stage of emotionality are not necessarily identi- 
cal, but are like two people of about the same general 
athletic ability, who are alike only on the average, while 
different, more or less, in each of many particular forms 
of athletic prowess. Averaging up the emotional 
reactions to many situations, we arrive at a rough central 
tendency and it is to this that the term general emotion- 
ality refers. The cases of great general emotional 
susceptibility, or of great emotional Jethargy, need not 
represent a particular lack or deficiency in one’s equip- 
ment nor some super-added defect, native or acquired, 
but merely the extremes of a group of tendencies 
possessed by all. 
An excess of emotionality is the main characteristic 
of one extreme. All or nearly all emotions may be excited 
by stimuli, numerous and slight, more than is the case 
with average people; joy, fear, sorrow, melancholy, and 
excitement are easily and frequently aroused. Not only 
are emotions easily and often aroused, but they are 
usually intense; joy is for them often explosive and riot- 
ous, anger becomes violent rage, sorrow becomes intense 
grief. 
While there are individuals predominantly sorrowful, 
or mirthful, or easily angered or affrighted, the more 
commonly found case is the individual who is susceptible 
to all or nearly all forms of emotional response. As a 
general rule, the child readily susceptible to one form of 
emotion is readily susceptible to others. The child who 
laughs the heartiest, most readily breaks into tears; 
adults capable of the most enraptured pleasure are sus- 
ceptible to the deepest sorrow or the most exquisite pain.
-P-A-G-E-193
176 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
The most readily enraged may be, in turn, the most com- 
passionate; the most ferocious, the most fearful. The 
sympathetic system, in all of these cases, seems to be 
hyper-sensitive and hyper-active; easily thrown into 
gear and unusually intense in its response to stimuli of 
many sorts. 
Generally, but not invariably, extreme emotional 
sensitivity is characterized not only by emotional excess 
but also by emotional instability. The emotional child 
often shifts abruptly from laughter to tears, from affec- 
tion to anger, from self-confidence to pessimism. In this 
fickleness, the emotional sensitivity and excessiveness of 
response can usually be recognized, despite the fact that 
other types of instability, more mental than emotional in 
character, making up what is called the “psychopathic” 
or the “neurotic” constitution, are frequently found in 
the same individual. Indeed, excessive emotionality and 
nervous and mental instability are often difficult to 
distinguish. Of the latter, something will be said in the 
next chapter. 
The extremely unemotional individual is less easy to 
detect and his behavior is a less serious matter with the 
exception of the infrequent cases caused by actual 
disease. The least emotional individuals are by no 
means unemotional, but are aroused less frequently and 
less intensely. The mechanism of the emotions, designed 
for emergencies, is rather easily aroused even in those 
relatively unresponsive. It is the over-emotional rather 
than the under-emotional who experience difficulties in 
adaptation to modern conditions. 
In the emotional child the sympathetic nervous sys- 
tem, it would appear, is readily innervated, bringing 
about the train of visceral changes previously described. 
How serious these disturbances may be depends, of
-P-A-G-E-194
THE EMOTIONS - . 177 
course, upon the soundness of the organs themselves; 
but indigestion and intestinal disorders, disturbances of 
circulation and of heart action, nervousness, insomnia, 
general weakness, and fatigability are frequently found. 
With the internal activities of the body more than com- 
monly at the mercy of the external conditions, more than 
ordinary care and prudence must be exercised to avoid 
overtaxation of reserves. The emotionally unstable child 
usually cannot indefinitely keep pace with those of 
greater poise but otherwise of equal endowment. 
In the work of the school, the handicap of excessive 
emotionality usually becomes apparent. Pupils of high 
mental abilities who are otherwise sound, except that 
they are very emotional, experience difficulties in holding 
themselves down to continuous, especially monotonous, 
work. .Drill in spelling, arithmetic, phonics, and writing 
is carried on sporadically. In the formal aspects of these 
subjects, the emotional child lags behind his intellectual 
possibilities? He lacks the capacity for steadiness and 
persistence of concentration which such ‘functions 
demand. His attention flags and shifts before the lesson 
is well under way. Special interests, more individual 
attention, shorter periods of practice with frequent 
change, an abundance of physical freedom, and other 
special forms of treatment frequently enable the 
emotional child to make greater achievements.

  CHAPTER IX 
THE DYNAMIC ROLE OF INSTINCTS IN HABIT 
FORMATION 
Original nature provides us with a host of tendencies 
to mental, emotional, and muscular activity. Events in 
the environment or in the body itself are constantly 
providing stimuli which arouse either immediate and 
conclusive responses, typically of the reflex type, or 
impulses and states of readiness for further activity 
which are more characteristic of the complex instincts. 
The same may be said of acquired reaction patterns. 
They, like instincts, are aroused by stimuli from within 
the body or from some feature of the external environment 
and, if delayed, appear as states of readiness or as 
conscious impulses to action. 
Habits once well established operate in every respect 
like instincts. Many habits, however, are really the 
means by which native impulses are expressed, and 
habits, in this sense, are derived from instincts. There 
is a. native impulse to manipulate and specific tendencies 
to make a nuinber of particular hand and finger move- 
ments; but acquired forms of manipulation of toys and 
implements may satisfy the tendency to manipulation 
quite as well. In other cases, the acquired activities may 
be less directly, at least less obviously, akin to the native 
trait and yet activated by it. They are, as it were, native 
tendencies in disguise. :

182 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
How Instinctive TenpEeNctns ARE THWARTED: 
But why the need of indirect expression? Why do we 
not always, if we feel an impulse, carry it through to its 
consummation directly? The answer is that the con- 
ditions of life often thwart the direct expression. The 
child very early finds his natural impulses subject to 
discipline; he may not eat, yell, throw when and what 
he pleases. As he grows up, he finds that the life of the 
school offers other restrictions and each later year may 
add anew to the inhibitions of his conduct. 
The sources of inhibitions of or restrictions upon 
native tendencies may be grouped roughly as follows: 
1. Other antagonistic instinctive trends 
2. Acquired habits, ideals, conventions, taboos 
3. Obstacles in the environment 
One instinctive trend may conflict with another or 
several others so that all cannot be gratified. Thus one’s 
desire to accumulate may conflict with counter desires 
to rest, secure immediate sensory satisfactions, or social 
approval by immediate display. The impulse to mastery 
may conflict with the impulse to avoid injury in physical 
encounter. The impulse to experience the novel may 
conflict with fear of the unknown or with the satisfac- 
tions of familiar surroundings. The impulse to dominate, 
when the objects are our own children, may conflict with 
the parental impulse to treat them tenderly. 
Instincts may be thwarted by acquired habits, ideals, _ 
religious beliefs, or social conventions. In time of war, 
instinctive fears of slaughter may conflict with ideals of 
patriotism. The native impulse to pick up attractive 
objects runs counter to habits and ideals of honesty. 
Beliefs established in childhood, religious and social 
training, or thoughts of consequences, may inhibit many
-P-A-G-E-200
INSTINCTS IN HABIT FORMATION 183 
sex impulses. The strength of the instinctive tendencies 
to collect and hoard, to dominate, to fight, to scorn, to 
indulge sex are reflected by the Ten Commandments, and 
other religious as well as legal, economic, and social 
enactments. Were these impulses more easily and 
generally controlled, there would be little need of laws 
and courts, police and prisons, social taboos and prohibi- 
tions. The existence of these institutions and practices 
is perennial evidence of the conviction that all native 
activities are not socially desirable, and that many of 
them must, therefore, be more or less completely diverted 
or held in check. 
Finally, original tendencies may be thwarted by 
natural obstacles or realities. Barrenness of the soil, 
floods or drought, business depression, or the superiority 
of rivals may thwart many native trends, as may the 
death of parents, partners, or friends. One’s desire to 
secure social approval may be thwarted by a disfigured 
face; to attain mastery, by an unimposing physique or 
inadequate intellect. Injuries, illness, and other mis- 
fortunes are the more annoying because they foretell 
other thwartings. If we have a steady job certain crav- 
ings, such as those for rest, freedom of action, display of 
authority, may need to be foregone; if we lack a steady 
job, others such as the desire to accumulate, to eat 
abundantly, to secure approval, are jeopardized. No 
matter how favorable the conditions of life, the thwart- 
ing of native impulses and wants will be constantly 
experienced. 
Wuat Happens WHen an InsTINCTIVE TENDENCY 
1s THWARTED? 
What happens when an instinctive tendency, being in 
readiness to act, is by some circumstance not permitted
-P-A-G-E-201
184 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
to act? A general answer to this question, given earlier, 
will bear repetition. Whenever an instinct is ready to 
act, for it to act is satisfying; and furthermore, whenever 
an instinct is ready to act, for it not to act is annoying. 
A satisfying state of affairs is defined as one which the 
animal seeks and attempts to maintain; an annoying 
state of affairs is one which the animal attempts to 
avoid—to which it reacts negatively. Both are con- 
ditions which demand activity and if the conditions are 
novel, the result of the activity is learning. 
All of these general statements find concrete illustra- 
tion in experiments upon a cat enclosed in a puzzle box. 
The animal is instinctively annoyed by such confine- 
ment and this provides the motive for efforts to escape. 
If the cat is at the same time hungry, food placed in 
front of the box adds another motive—a readiness to eat. 
If the way out of the box has been previously mastered 
or if the box yields to such activities as cats instinctively 
make in such a situation, the end results—escaping con- 
finement and reaching the food—are at once accom- 
plished. But if the box is unusual, the way out must 
be discovered by a series of trials characterized usually 
by many errors before final success is achieved. Here 
we have a typical form of learning; learning by “trial 
and error,” as it is called. The cat bites, digs, claws, 
pushes, pulls, and makes other native and acquired 
responses to the several features, wires, slats, knobs, 
strings, openings, which the box provides; he tries and 
tries again, until finally the solution is hit upon, usually 
by sheer accident. Ordinarily the whole performance 
must be undergone a number of times before the “way 
out” reactions are thoroughly habituated. 
In all essentials, man’s behavior when thwarted in 
some instinctive tendency or when seeking to satisfy
-P-A-G-E-202
' INSTINCTS IN HABIT FORMATION 185 
some native impulse is like that of the cat in the box. 
He tries in one way or another to secure the satisfying 
and avoid the annoying state of affairs. He differs from 
the cat by learning the “way out” of the latter or the 
“way to” the former more rapidly and with better reten- 
tion. -He differs, furthermore, in his capacity to make 
certain mental adjustments to the perplexing situation; 
adjustments which, although involving ideas to a degree 
quite beyond the capacity of the animal, are achieved 
by the same “trial and error’ process that characterized 
the cat’s escape from the box. 
When the native impulses to collect and hoard, rest, 
dominate others, fight, secure social approval or sex 
satisfaction, or to satisfy other wants are thwarted by 
obstacles, or when they come into conflict with each 
other or with our acquired habits, beliefs or ideals, some 
way out of the dilemma is sought by the try-and-try- 
again process; that is, by means of our capacity to learn. 
The adjustments thus made are obviously acquired 
reactions; habits acquired in the service of the 
instinctive trends. : 
INDivipvAL DIFFERENCES IN ABILITY TO TOLERATE 
THWARTINGS 
Individuals moreover differ greatly in the degree to 
which they are annoyed by the thwarting of their wants 
as well as in the characteristic types of adjustment. 
Some people, we all know from observation, can main- 
tain their poise in the severest storm of deprivation and 
misfortune, while others are disarrayed by the slightest 
swirl. Scattered between the two extremes are the other 
individuals, representing every intermediate degree but 
most thickly clustered in the middle of the group. Those
-P-A-G-E-203
186 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
at the weaker end are often spoken of by students of 
nervous and mental disorders as “neuropathic,” or 
“neurotic,” or “psychopathic,” which means, in a general 
way, easily upset, very sensitive to difficulties in adjust- 
ment, and consequently readily susceptible to nervous 
or mental disorders. The position which an individual 
occupies in the group, ranging from the most to the least 
“unstable,” of which the “neurotics” compose the former 
end, is determined in. the main by original nature, 
although disease, poisons, shocks, or hardships may pull 
one to a level far lower than his original position. 
It is seldom easy to differentiate the neurotic or 
nervously unstable from the extreme case of general 
emotionality. In the purest form, the case of extreme 
emotionality represents merely an excessive organic 
reaction to stimuli. There may be internal disturbances 
of a violent type, momentary or persistent, with rela- 
tively little misinterpretation of the stimulating events, 
The individual may simply become readily embarrassed, 
chagrined, frightened, unnerved, angered, while quite 
aware of the irrational character of such behavior, just 
as many of us become more or less excited over a public 
performance while quite aware both of the irrational 
character and the futility of the perturbation. The emo- 
tionally unstable individual may make entirely rational 
and wholesome adjustments to his difficulties even though 
the difficulties are great, whereas the psychopathic indi- 
vidual is not only intolerant of his thwartings but is 
unfortunate if not irrational in his adjustments. Emo- 
‘ tional susceptibility, however, predisposes to unfortunate 
adjustments and unfortunate adjustments may aggravate 
emotional susceptibility. 
What is meant specifically by the extreme neuropathic 
or psychopathic dispositions can best be explained
-P-A-G-E-204
INSTINCTS IN HABIT FORMATION 187 
by detailed consideration of particular adjustment 
tendencies, of which there are several forms. 
Tue MrecuanisM oF INTROVERSION 
One of the most familiar and certainly one of the most 
convenient ways of securing indirect exercise of a 
thwarted desire or trend lies in the substitution of 
imagination for actuality. Among children, the common 
day dreams of candies, cakes, toys, and fairies are sam- 
ples. The imaginary companions of the lonesome child, 
which occasionally become phantasies, and the “white 
lies” due to confusion, in recollection, between the real 
and the fancied, are the products of similar mental 
mechanisms more extreme in their operation. Among 
adults, the same tendencies are found, working along 
grown-up lines and normally with little confusion with 
actuality. Excessive day dreaming of the realization 
of desires is technically calied introversion (meaning to 
turn inward) and the extreme introvert, at least when 
subject to confusion of fact and fancy, would be 
commonly classified as abnormal or insane. 
The “Conquering Hero” Type.—Among introversions 
there are several tendencies which are alike with respect 
to the mental processes involved and with respect to the 
fact that they are, in some way, clearly satisfying. Per- 
haps most common is the form in which various instine- 
tive tendencies—the desire for social approval, for 
mastery, etc—are gratified by playing one’s self, in 
imagination, as a “conquering hero.” One may picture 
himself as a hero in battle, on the gridiron, in the prize- 
ring; as a great bandit, singer, or preacher; as the 
strongest, most admired—indeed, as the superlative in 
any line, even in benevolence or modesty. By some
-P-A-G-E-205
is8 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
imaginary ability or achievement one becomes an extra- 
ordinary person—a conquering hero—to whom imaginary 
approval and applause are due. 
These are perfectly normal and universal day dreams 
which bring much satisfaction and little harm to most 
people. But in the extreme form they may be disastrous; 
indeed, they resemble the delusions of grandeur found in 
Paranoia, a rather uncommon form of insanity: The vic- 
tim of delusions of grandeur has become an extreme 
introvert or has somehow lost his grip on reality so that 
he believes and tells you at length that he is the strong- 
est, wealthiest, or in some other way the greatest man 
on earth. Of course, these systematic delusions indicate 
neurotic organization to begin with and may be long in 
developing into the extreme form; but fundamentally 
they are achieved by the same kind of mental function- 
ing which results in the harmless self-aggrandizement of 
youth. 
The “Suffering Hero” Type.—Another tendency of 
imagination or introversion is typified by the ideal 
experiences of a suffering hero. While less common than 
the conquering hero variety, this form of imaginary 
experience is equally intelligible and equally satisfying, 
to some people, at least. The fancies may run some- 
thing like this: a boy, ruminating over his hard luck and 
ill treatment (as he sees it) at home or school, pictures 
himself as forced to run away from home. He imagines 
himself joining a group of bandits and going to the bad 
completely, or perhaps overwhelmed by a snowstorm and 
wild beasts, by which he is injured or even killed. Mean- 
while, parents, teachers, some little girl, in fact the whole 
village has become alarmed and repentant, and after 
vigilant search he is brought back a hero, even if a 
wounded one. But perhaps he‘dies, and if so, it is any~

} thing but annoying for him to hear the imaginary 
obituary, in which his virtues, appreciated heretofore by 
none but himself, move the congregation to heartrending 
grief and remorse. 
Introversions of this type are highly gratifying partly 
because the subject is, after all, a hero who achieves 
acclaim and partly because approval coupled with sym- 
pathy and pity are all the more sweet. Self-pity, which 
is typical of many neuroties, probably belongs in this 
general group, ie., it is the outgrowth of introversion of 
the suffering-hero type. 
The suffering hero mechanism is often behind such 
childish behavior as pouting, sullenness, pretended 
injuries or illness, refusals to eat or to play. If the new 
doll or dress is not quite up to expectation, the child is 
angered and will not have it at all. A real or imagined 
slight at the party sends the boy home in indignation 
or grief. As a rule, real actions of the wounded-hero type 
are cured more readily than are thoughts. The boy who 
refuses to eat finds, after all, that no one else is much 
disturbed, whereas he gets dreadfully hungry; he who 
~ leaves the party learns that he misses a great deal of fun 
without being himself missed. But the imagined acts 
. of this sort come out more happily. Imaginary starva- 
tion is more tolerable, and the imagined remorse and 
pity caused by it can always be secured, whereas real 
sympathy from others is not always secured. 
Some forms of delusions of persecution in the insane 
have many features in common with the suffering-hero 
introversion although others are developed in different 
ways. Overt acts of martyrdom, ranging from refusals to 
eat or play to the infliction of injuries, the simulation of 
illness or actual suicide, may be the outcome of prolonged 
or impulsive introversion of the suffering-hero type.

IDENTIFICATION 
A somewhat easier and often more vivid substitution 
for genuine action of the sort instinctively desired may 
be secured by identifying one’s self with the conquering 
or wounded hero or with other characters in fiction or 
on the screen or stage. When the boy reads Treasure 
Island or Robinson Crusoe, he actually becomes the 
adventurer. With Nick Carter he holds up trains, kills 
Indians, overcomes ferocious enemies, drops over 
Niagara, and has other experiences at which his original 
nature thrills but to which it scarcely dares lead overtly. 
Similarly, we may identify ourselves with the righteous 
and heroic sufferer, and weep real tears at our imagined 
hard lot. The heroes and heroines as well as their 
experiences may change constantly or, doubtless less 
frequently, we may persistently identify ourselves with 
a real or represented character, following his achieve- 
ments in great detail. The réle of the finest character 
or the greatest rogue, the most applauded or the most 
chastised, may be imagined with equally great satis- 
faction. / 
Within limits, and properly controlled, the play of 
imagination or identification is productive of little harm, 
while providing much satisfaction. The student, strug- 
gling without time or means for immediate gratification 
of his impulses, is comforted by the vision of wealth, 
power, and approval that he may some day attain. The 
introversions should be of the right sort. Imaginary 
achievements as a rule, if not invariably, are more whole- 
some than imaginary grievances. One may get along 
very well on imaginary power but not very well on 
imaginary food. Fancy must not. disregard fact nor 
become a substitute for action. It is in this possibility
-P-A-G-E-208
INSTINCTS IN HABIT FORMATION 191 
of imagining fine adjustment while achieving none that 
danger lies. a 
RATIONALIZATION 
Mental adjustments may also take the form of 
rationalization although irrationalization would be the 
more descriptive if less commonly used term. Rational- 
ization is a form of thinking or reasoning, that is, of 
sifting data, in which our personal desires are selective 
factors which guarantee an agreeable conclusion. 
Ideally, reasoning is the process of impartial manipula- 
tion of the evidence to achieve the logical conclusion, 
however disastrous the result may be to our own wishes. 
Rationalization means more or less complete blindness 
to all evidence except what furthers our side of the case. 
In every-day life this irrational process is often so subtle 
as to leave us oblivious of its existence. 
A middle-aged man with a wife and family buys a 
handsome automobile. His older and more sagacious 
uncle, paying a visit, questions his motives in this pur- 
chase: “It seems to me,” he says, “that you need furni- 
ture, a new fence, a fund for sending your children 
through college, a nest-egg for emergencies, more than 
you need this machine.” But the buyer has a ready 
defense: “Well, my wife hasn’t been any too well and I 
thought that a little week-end trip now and then would 
do her a lot of good. And a business man must have some 
recreation, you know! Then the children! They caught 
so many colds last winter because they got wet going to 
school”—and so on with other “reasons.” Now, what 
were the real motives? Perhaps the fact that other 
neighbors had cars which were veritable badges of greater 
business success. Perhaps driving a big machine 
appealed to the instinct of self-assertion. Perhaps the
-P-A-G-E-209
192 PSYCHOLOGY FOR, STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
approval of on-lookers was the object sought. Observe 
the motives to which advertisements of high-class cars 
appeal! 
The real motives often lie deeper than those we give, 
and what is equally significant, we often do not ourselves 
appreciate just what they are. Rationalization is a 
subtle process; it provides acceptable reasons while con- 
cealing the fundamental motive. The most effective 
temptations are those which come in disguise. If we are 
inclined to take the afternoon off for golf,. while really 
aware that we should work, we at once obscure the real 
issue by rationalizations, by camouflaging the unworthy 
impulses. The student says to himself, “I have been 
working hard; I deserve a rest; I must be careful of my 
health; a little recreation will double my capacity 
to-morrow.” And the next morning to justify faith in 
himself, the student rationalizes the sore muscles and 
aching back as symptoms of renewed strength and vigor ; 
or the excessive fatigue as evidence that exercise was 
sadly needed. These excuses and explanations are as 
persuasive as they are irrational. L

Failure to secure mastery, social approval, or other 
instinctive needs may be partly averted by a form of 
rationalization called projection. There is a universal 
impulsion to project the trouble to some cause other 
than our own deficiency. If, while groping our way 
across the room in’ the darkness, we thump our shin on 
a footstool (due to our own forgetfulness), our immedi- 
ate impulse and not infrequent act is to reproach the 
footstool rather than ourselves. Missing a stroke in 
tennis, we look inquiringly at the racket, ball, or net.

The clumsy carpenter accuses his tools. If we fail in an 
examination, the questions were unfair. If one is a 
slave to alcohol, the taste was inherited from his father. 
If a man sins, it was because he was irresistibly tempted. 
If he amounts to nothing, it was because he did not. have 
a chance. There was once a man who exclaimed when 
his carelessness resulted in the burning of his home: “It 
was the Lord’s will.” 
By projection we escape the annoyingness consequent 
upon the admission of our failures and deficiencies. The 
chronie alcoholic, notorious for projecting the cause of 
his downfall, affords an example of this mechanism. It 
would be most painful to admit that one is not only a 
worthless drunkard but also the cause of untold suffering 
to one’s wife and family. The chronic drinker, finding 
it impossible to give up the liquor, casts about, like the 
cat in the box, for some means of escaping these unendur- 
able thoughts. Perhaps, some time as he arrives at home 
intoxicated, the wife indignantly drives him out of the 
house. Thinking the matter over at the corner saloon, 
it occurs to him that he would not be drinking now were 
it not for his wife. This affords a crumb of comfort. 
He broods over this and other real or imagined events 
until he has convinced himself that his wife has been, 
even from the beginning, the cause of his downfall. That 
these delusions free him from responsibility not only for 
his own ruin but for the sufferings of his family is motive 
enough for clinging to them tenaciously. 
Tux “Sour Grapes” MecHanism AND Its ConvERSE 
As the fable goes, a fox after many vain efforts to 
secure an attractive bunch of grapes, preserves his pride 
and assuages his appetite by declaring that the grapes
-P-A-G-E-211
194 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
were sour; quite unfit for consumption by one of his 
caliber. This portrays a2 common method of human 
adjustment, a. tendency to minimize or deny the desira- 
bility of the ends sought. If we lose our job through 
inefficiency we convince ourselves that the loss was a 
blessing in disguise. If we find masterfulness difficult to 
attain, we may say that more than anything else we 
despise pretentiousness. Being poor, we assert that 
money is the root of all evil. Unfit for or unsuccessful 
in marriage, we declare wedded life a failure. 
A rather general belief in compensation among human 
abilities has arisen from this tendency—a conviction 
that people extraordinarily competent along one line 
must be deficient in another. If the other fellow learns 
rapidly he will retain poorly. The pretty girl has little 
sense. The highly intelligent are nervous, unstable or 
physically inferior. All of these generalizations are, in 
fact, incorrect and thus disclose the more clearly this 
unique human tendency. 
The Converse of the “Sour Grapes” Mechanism.—A 
fox finding none but sour grapes declares that they are 
just the kind for which he had been searching. And so, 
Pollyanna finds that no matter what the calamity, one 
ought really to be pleased because it might have been 
worse. Living in a hovel, we declare it easier to. keep 
tidy and much more comfortable than a big lonesome 
house. Lacking mastery, we find supreme virtues in 
meekness. . 
The “sour grapes” mechanism and the Pollyanna forms 
of adjustment betray a weakness. To declare that really 
desirable achievements or rewards are futile or deprav- 
ing seldom uproots our wants, at least not. those 
grounded in strong native trends. Furthermore, the 
fruits whose -desirability was. once denied later may fall
-P-A-G-E-212
INSTINCTS IN HABIT FORMATION 195 
within our grasp, whereupon we must either scorn them 
again or else lay ourselves open to the attack of 
inconsistency. 
Both forms of adjustment are negative—let things 
come as they will and make the best of them—rather 
than progressive. It is the adjustment of the inactive; 
the same old sour grapes are good enough.. If they are 
really sour, it would be better to search elsewhere for 
sweeter ones. It is the opposite extreme of adjustment 
tendency from the behavior of one who, finding a high 
wall in the path of his progress, attempts to go under 
it, or over it, or around it, and, all of these failing, goes 
around the world to come up on the other side. 
Locic-TigHT ComPpARTMENTS 
Systems of ideas developed by rationalizations of any 
type, beliefs, superstitions, prejudices, grudges, or habits 
developed in childhood or later often become so firmiy 
established that they can scarcely be dislodged even in 
the face of substantial evidence that they are irrational, 
useless, or even harmful. Such acquired systems of 
response, impenetrable to logical attack, have been 
called logic-tight compartments. 
Among the milder forms of logic-tight compartments 
are our convictions of the superiority of our town or 
county, our college, or ourselves. Several investigations 
have shown a very usual tendency for people, even those 
of high intelligence and broad training, to overestimate 
their abilities and virtues and in particular for those who 
are generally regarded, for example, as decidedly snob- 
bish or vulgar to be blind to the facts. It is easy to see 
that these erroneous beliefs are motivated by our instine- 
tive desires. In various ways we may close our minds
-P-A-G-E-213
196 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
to the arguments which run counter to our desires and 
cherish those which favor them. In the course of time, 
these prejudices become fixed. 
We may have closed minds in various degrees, ranging 
from the slight distortion of facts required to provide a 
comforting explanation of failure in an examination, or 
that of a male clerical worker who may not himself see 
any relation between his fear of competition and his con- 
viction that “woman’s place is in the home” to the 
extreme type of the man, who while scrubbing the floor 
of the asylum stops to tell you that he is a millionaire. 
While we would call the last a case of insanity and the 
first just a “natural feeling,” both are similar mechani- 
cally, differing mainly in the degree to which misinterpre- 
tation is carried. The delusion of being a millionaire 
represents logic-tightness to a degree of absolute 
immunity to which the term dissociation is often applied. 
Dissociation.—The psychologists and psychiatrists 
working with abnormal behavior find a great many types 
of dissociation. ( Persistent irrational ideas; loss of 
memories, of the control of the limbs, of sensitivity of 
skin or eyes or other sensory mechanisms; and “auto- 
matie” functions such as writing, represent dissociations 
of bodily or mental functions from the “main” 
personality. Ordinary associations fail to influence 
them. , 
What interests us in these abnormal conditions is that 
there is a constantly growing tendency to regard them 
as “escape mechanisms”; devices, not understood by 
the patient, but hit upon accidentally, which provide a 
“way out” of an annoying situation or which permit the 
exercise of fundamental trends that otherwise would be 
prohibited. 
A badly pampered young man of a somewhat unstable
-P-A-G-E-214
INSTINCTS IN HABIT FORMATION 197 
type began his career as an accountant. Before many 
weeks he was brought home complaining of severe pains 
in the eyes and in the right arm, which seemed partly 
paralysed. Feeling better after a few days’ rest, he 
returned to his work only to find the attacks recurring. 
The significant thing about these symptoms is that they 
made his work in the office impossible. Actually, the 
young man found the tedious task at the desk, day in 
and day out, extremely boring, and the work deprived 
him of the freedom and comforts which home life had 
previously given. At the same time, he was naturally 
averse to quitting outright—that would offend his self- 
respect and bring the scorn of his friends as well. Per- 
haps, one afternoon the fatigue of eye and hand did 
become severe, providing an excuse for release from labor 
for the day. The next day, the same symptoms occurred 
in more severe form and, half frightened and yet half 
gratified, he was taken home. Not only did he thus 
escape the unpleasant work but the criticism of himself 
and of others as well. In fact, he reaps more sympathy, 
freedom, and general care than ever. 
Susstitute AcTIvITIeEs on CoMPENSATIONS 
The various forms of introversion and most of the 
forms of rationalization were mental adjustments to the 
situations which interfered with or inhibited the direct 
expression of native impulses. In one way or another 
some mental activity was substituted for overt action. 
More active adjustments may also be made even when 
the substituted activity is in most respects quite unlike 
‘the original form. For example, a man who has been 
enraged but who does not dare to give rein to his impulses 
_ to attack because of his fear of injury, or jail, or perhaps
-P-A-G-E-215
198 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
because he doesn’t believe in fighting, may substitute an 
attack with words or looks, or he may control himself for 
a long time but may later vent his rage upon his wife or 
children. In the same way, a man of frail stature, failing 
to secure a feeling of mastery by his physique, substitutes 
(quite unwittingly, perhaps) a dignified gait and manner, 
or develops a loud, “masterful” voice or a hard, even gaze. 
A woman, lacking beauty or wit, may, to secure approval, 
substitute gorgeous apparel or affect the élite in vocal ex- 
pression. The unprepared student in writing his exami- 
nation may compensate in volume for what he lacks in 
facts. A man low in the scale of authority at his place 
of work, submissive to others throughout the day, may 
find a satisfactory compensation in ruling his wife and 
children with a stern and unrelenting will. 
Substituted activities may be good or they may be bad; 
some are very bad indeed. That addiction to alcohol, 
heroin, morphine, or other drugs may be considered as 
compensations for thwarted desires or ways out of annoy- 
ing situations, is a growing belief. Dr. Richard Cabot, 
Professor of Medicine in Harvard University, writes: 
“We hear a great deal of the physical craving for liquor. 
I do not believe there is any such thing except in the 
people who are in the middle of a drunk. A person who 
has slept it off . . . may well enough go back to it and 
of course he often does. But he does not go back from 
merely ‘physical’ craving, but generally because he 
is bored or because he is blue or because he is restless.” 
That Dr. Cabot had in mind thwarted impulses or. an- 
noying conflicts from which alcohol has provided an 
escape, is indicated in this further statement: “The 
alcoholic is helped, so far as he is helped at all, by getting 
at the reason why he started drinking and has continued 
to drink. Then if possible we try to find a stronger mo-
-P-A-G-E-216
INSTINCTS IN HABIT FORMATION. 199 
tive, a motive stronger than the thing that has driven 
him to drink and thus drive him out of drink.” 
A substitute activity, then, may get one into difficulties 
worse than the trouble which the activity aimed to re- 
lieve. But there are good as well as bad forms of com- 
pensation. If the maternal instinct is thwarted, better 
than idle day dreaming, or novel reading, or a pessimistic 
view of life, or “sour grapes” or a cheery indifference of 
the Pollyanna type, better than some silly or harmful 
compensatory activity, would be the substitution of some 
social, religious, or educational work. For the fighting, 
hunting, dominating impulses of youth, vigorous athletic 
games may be substituted. When angered, instead of 
holding a grudge, or inflicting damage on the offender in 
fancy, or working off the impulses by verbal attack upon 
inoffensive persons, we might attack the woodpile. A 
man who had lost his wife and children, in a terrible 
calamity, instead of avoiding the anguish by way of de- 
lusions, or liquor, or giving up to a wounded-hero type of 
self-pity, plunged more deeply than ever into his work 
and so instead of becoming a ne’er-do-well, a drunkard, or 
a pessimist, became a very eminent soldier. Of all the 
methods of adjustment to the thwarting of our funda- 
mental impulsions, the substitution of some wholesome 
but vigorous activity, while not always the easiest to 
arrange, is by far the best. When the lives of men are 
deeply searched, great achievements are found in lines of 
activity which began as substitutes for some other 
interest that was thwarted. 
REPRESSION 
In the writings of Freud and many other exponents of 
the “psycho-analytic” schools, the term “ repression” into
-P-A-G-E-217
200 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
the “unconscious” or “subconscious” appears extensively. 
According to many of these writers, repression is con- 
ceived as a subtle mechanism by which many thwarting 
or painful ideas or “conflicts” or impulses under taboo 
may be temporarily avoided by banishment from con- 
sciousness. Sex impulses (which the Freudians find to 
be most numerous) may arise in forms tabooed by our 
ideals or training. We cannot allow these impulses to 
be expressed directly or even by day-dreaming their real- 
ization. Attempts to rob them of their attractiveness 
by some form of rationalization, by the sour-grapes mech- 
anism, for example, may fail. What we may do, accord- 
ing to the Freudians, is to relegate them actively into the 
sub-conscious; that is, to repress them. Once submerged 
in this lower region, they become unconscious—we be- 
come unaware of their existence—but though buried they 
are really buried alive. Still active, they may express 
themselves in some indirect way, often in most mischiev- 
ous ways. They may come out during dreams—a time 
when our inhibitions are at a low ebb—in some symbolic 
or even direct form. During waking hours, the re- 
pressed ideas or impulses are more closely guarded by the 
“censor,” that is, by our ordinary taboos and inhibitions. 
Their appearance then must be very deceptive; conse- 
quently they take the form of headache, nervousness, 
fears, forgetfulness, pains, paralysis, or stuttering. Even 
slips of speech or writing, difficulties in recalling a name, 
perseveration of a tune, or giggling are ways in which re- 
pressed impulses are satisfied. Many nervous disorders, 
it is said, are occasioned by these unconscious ideas and 
impulses. Such symptoms are unconscious motives in 
disguise. 
When explained in detail, the Freudian concepts are 
fascinating and often convincing. Yet they have not
-P-A-G-E-218
INSTINCTS IN HABIT FORMATION 201 
met with approval in most scientific, especially psycho- 
logical circles. The trouble is, that while they fit in 
well with popular notions, the concepts are really 
scientifically unsound. 
The Unconscious and Subconscious Ideas.—There 
may be, in the body, activities which are unconscious; 
that is, activities which arouse no sensations. Our di- 
gestive processes may be going on, active yet unconscious. 
The seat of consciousness is, of course, the brain and not 
the stomach. Unless the motor and glandular activities, 
through sensory nerves, arouse to activity certain neural 
mechanisms in the brain, the digestive processes arouse 
no sensations, that is, they do not become conscious. The 
trouble. begins when it is assumed that the sensations 
from the stomach, even if not experienced as conscious, 
nevertheless actually exist somewhere, namely, in the 
unconscious. The fact is that unless they are conscious 
they do not exist at all—in the subconscious mind, in the 
brain, or in any other place any more than words exist 
as things in the vocal organs when these organs are in- 
active. “Where,” it is asked, “is a memory or idea when 
it is not conscious? Where is the idea of my birthplace 
when I am not thinking of it? Is it not still a genuine, 
live idea although not in the region which we call con- 
sciousness? Given a chance, will it not leap out of the 
unconscious into full consciousness? Is this not the proc- 
ess of recollection?” Now this doctrine is as perverse as 
it is simple. Memories and ideas are not things, which 
must always exist somewhere. They are merely con- 
scious responses to appropriate stimulation just as move- 
ments are muscular responses to stimuli. We do not say 
that a movement is something actually existing but con- 
cealed in a muscle, from which it emerges when activated 
and to which it returns during inactivity. What we say
-P-A-G-E-219
202 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
is that a mechanism, the muscle, when properly stimu- 
lated by means of a nerve impulse, is thrown into action, 
with a movement as the result. During a period of in- 
activity, the muscle does not contain an actual move- 
ment; all that exisits is the muscle with its nerve con- 
nections modified as they have been by past exercise. 
Likewise, the physical basis of conscious recall is assumed 
to be a group of cortical mechanisms similarly condi- 
tioned by past exercise and thrown into action by stimuli. 
In sum, an idea, memory, or impulse is like a motor re- 
sponse, in the sense that it is a reaction. It is retained 
in the same way that an acquired motor act is retained. 
Neither a movement nor an idea exists as such except 
when it is activated; at other times, neither exists in the 
unconscious—it is simply inactive. 
Unconscious Impulses.—Impulses to eat, sleep, or 
dominate are, like movements or ideas, due to reactions 
of certain mechanisms; and except when the mechanisms 
are active, the impulses do not exist. The impulse to 
eat, for example, is produced on occasions by organic con- 
ditions such as that of insufficient fuel in the system, or 
by outer stimuli such as the sight or smell of food, or 
—best—by both together (summation). Readiness to 
eat does recur, not by popping out of the unconscious but 
as a reaction to organic or external stimuli. Similarly, 
the sex impulses are aroused by certain bodily conditions 
or by an external stimulus or by both together. Im- 
pulses, like memories, are reactions; they exist only when 
active; at other times there is nothing except the mecha- 
nism on which they depend. When not in a state of ac- 
tivity, impulses do not actually exist as entities in the 
unconscious, in the subconscious, or in the mechanisms 
which give rise to them any more than snaps and pops 
exist, as such, in an inactive whip.
-P-A-G-E-220
INSTINCTS IN HABIT FORMATION 203 
These are really not trivial or academic “distinctions 
without a difference.’ The Freudians, having gone astray 
because of the erroneous assumption that every one car- 
ries around with him a host of active entities in his un- 
conscious, next assume that these hidden but uncannily 
active—in fact, intelligent—beings disguise themselves 
and break out, causing slips of the tongue, dreams, fears, 
nervous disorders of the various sorts which they find in 
their patients. There is a tremendous difference between 
the Freudian statement that the accountant’s eye and 
arm disturbances (mentioned above) are due to the 
work of active entities from the unconscious and the ex- 
planation that these troubles were actually learned in 
much the same way that the cat learns, after many 
errors, to pull a string which opens the box in which it is 
confined. 
ConcLuUsIONs e 
The various typical ways by which man escapes the 
annoying situation occasioned by the thwarting of native 
tendencies, by day-dreaming the activity, by “sour- 
graping” it, or by pretending that the annoyingness is 
really satisfying, by rationalizing an excuse for the in- 
dulgence, or by substituting some other activity, good or 
bad—all of these are acquired adjustments. They are 
learned reactions, just as speaking English, fearing the 
plague, or cracking nuts are learned reactions or habits. 
To say that they are learned is by no means to say that 
they are understood. Just why or how, and often when, 
he learned to enjoy stories of travel, to whistle, or to 
count, generally is not understood by the learner, nor 
does he usually know with any definiteness how he now 
whistles or counts. The purpose of this chapter has been 
to présent in general terms a number of acquired adjust-
-P-A-G-E-221
204 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
ments to annoying situations provoked by the hampering 
or thwarting of native tendencies to action; and to illus- 
trate the fact that many habits are formed in the service 
of the instincts. The detailed processes involved ‘in 
learning or habit formation remain for later chapters and 
in none of them will we find it necessary to invoke the 
use of uncanny subconscious or unconscious entities or 
mystie powers of any sort. 
The “moral” of this chapter is contained in a quotation 
from William James’s famous chapter on Habit: ‘he 
hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells, is no 
- worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world 
by habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong 
way.” ... “The great thing, then, in all education, ,is 
to make our nervous systems our ally instead of our 
enemy. ... We must make automatic and habitual, as 
early as possible, as many useful actions as we can, and 
guard against the growing into ways that aredikely to be 
disadvantageous to us, as we should guard against the 
plague.” | 
We have stressed mainly the “disadvantageous ways,” 
but the same human capacities to learn may be made to 
operate in advantageous ways as well. One way to get 
started right is to make sure you are not started wrong. 
We should, then, understand as well as we may the 
tendencies to idle dreaming, self-pity, rationalization, not 
only in general, but our particular susceptibilities and 
the conditions under which undesirable reactions are most 
likely to occur. But mere knowledge of what not to do, 
indeed, knowledge of just what to do, is insufficient. 
Habits of holding our mental adjustments within proper 
limits, of thinking impersonally, of compensating wisely, 
these in numerous particular forms to meet/a multitude 
of specific difficulties must be acquired.\ “4 ~

CHAPTER X 
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 
Acquired activity may be contrasted—with inherited, 
unlearned, native, or instinctive activity, although, as we 
saw in the last chapter, the two are not independent. 
Learning would not go on without instinctive drives to 
activity and, furthermore, learning has its origin in native 
responses. The simplest form of learning consists in 
strengthening or weakening of a ‘native reaction. Other 
forms are merely reorganization of native reactions. All 
of the skills, for example, which the hand may acquire, 
are really reorganizations of the native, muscular reac- 
tions into new patterns. Here it is the Gombination or the 
pattern that is acquired; the elements in the complex are 
native. Finally, learning itself is a native capacity. It 
depends upon the inherited modifiability and retentive- 
ness of nervous structure. So that while learned and 
native, acquired and inherited, habit and instinct, may 
be contrasted, they are at the same time inseparable, 
Learning takes place only during activity; it is never a 
passive process of absorption but on the contrary a very. 
active process of reacting. 
Learning of the observational or informational type, 
such as becoming familiar with a face, tree, or building 
so that we can later recall it, or memorizing names and 
dates, the spelling of a word, of picking up information 
during reading—these and other sorts of mental acquisi- 
tions, like movements and skills, are the results of a 
207 :
-P-A-G-E-225
208 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
process of reacting. The same is true of learning to con- 
trol one’s temper, or to appreciate music, art, or liter- 
ature; all are acquired in the process of reacting. In 
fact, what we learn is a reaction; namely, that reaction 
which, having once been made, is strengthened by use. 
Tre Law or Use 
The simplest form of learning consists in the strength- 
ening of native reactions. Exercise of any reaction— 
walking, grasping, crying, laughing, becoming angry, sad, 
or joyous—other things being equal, tends to make that 
reaction more prompt, more certain, more easy. The use 
or exercise of any situation-response connection 
strengthens it; the stronger the connection the more 
prompt, easy, and certain the response. As we saw 
earlier, the innate capacity to learn is largely a function 
of the nervous system. The use of a connection unit 
(series of neurones) brings about certain changes, mainly 
in the synapses, which makes the passage of the nerye . 
impulse more rapid, easy, and complete? is is what 
ig meant by increasing the strength of the connection be- 
tween a stimulus and a response. Such modifiability of 
nervous structure is a native capacity which may be ex- 
pressed by the Law of Modification’ by Exercise, or,. more 
imply, the Law of Use. It may be stated as follows: 
Whenever a modifiable conneation “between a situation 
and a response is éxercised, other things being equal, the 
strength of that connection is increased. 
The Law of Frequency.—The Law Of Use expresses a 
basal fact, one that is needed to explain learning of every 
kind. A necessary correlate of this law is the fact that 
use up to a certain physiological limit is cumulative in. 
effect. If one response strengthens the connection some- 
>
-P-A-G-E-226
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 209 
what, then two responses have greater effect than one, 
three greater than two, and so on. Consequently, other 
things being equal, the more frequently a connection has 
been exercised the stronger the connection. This is somne- 
times called the Law of Frequency. 
Tue Law or Disuse 
Modifications in thé nervous system produced by use, 
however, are not retained in completeness for unlimited 
time. The nervous changes brought about by disuse are, 
roughly speaking, comparable to those produced: in a 
muscle. One may by exercise strengthen the muscle to 
a high degree of vigor, but the effects gradually disappear 
with disuse. The gradual forgetting of names, dates, or 
poetry, the gradual loss of skill in typewriting, drawing, 
singing, etc., when these functions are not revived by 
exercise, illustrate this fact. The Law of Disuse takes a 
place with the Law of Use as a well established principle. 
It may be stated as follows: When a modifiable connec- 
tion between a situation and a response is not exercised 
during a length of time, the strength of the connection is 
decreased. 
The Law of Recency.—The deteriorations of connec- 
tions through disuse is a gradual process. One day of dis- 
use causes some loss in the strength of a connection, two 
days a little more, and so on. The effect is cumulative, 
a fact often expressed in the correlative Law of Recency, 
which may be stated thus: other things being equal, 
the more recent the exercise, the stronger the connection 
between the situation and response. 
While the strengthening effect of use is involved in all 
leafning (the weakening effects of disuse being really a 
passive process), the acquisition of all complex functions
-P-A-G-E-227
210 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
such as writing, speech, swimming, reading, learning 
poetry, involves a great deal more than mere repetition of 
a number of native reactions. We do not have a feeble 
writing ability at the start, which by general exercise is 
made more easy and secure. We have, rather, a very 
large number of very minute, specific reactions, each to a 
particular stimulus, many of which are already organized, 
loosely or firmly, into acts. In the process of learning, 
some of these are selected and strengthened by use, others 
are disentangled and eliminated, to die out by disuse; 
others, possibly to be killed in some more active way. 
The acquired act of speaking a word, for example, is a 
compact bundle of specific connections between minute 
stimuli and minute reactions, and before the connections 
are selected, strengthened or weakened and properly fitted 
together, a tremendous amount of sorting must have been 
done. In actual learning, then, use and disuse operate 
upon very minute S-R confections. We do not practice 
one big writing or speaking reaction as we learn; we select 
and exercise, with varied vigor and for various lengths 
of time, hundreds of tiny constituent units. 
These facts must be made clear at the outset. So, 
without bothering at present with explanations of how - 
particular connections are selected or eliminated, we will 
present a number of illustrations of the facts; first, that 
learning is decidedly active; second, that it is decidedly 
specific. 
— 
Learn EACTING 
In Motor Acts.—Observe the child learning to say the 
word “kitty.” To begin with, it may be able to make “k” 
sounds and also “i,” “t,” and “é” sounds, but it experi- 
ences difficulty in getting them bound together in the 
way required to say “kitty,” During learning, the child
-P-A-G-E-228
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 211 
may say a good many things that are more or less close 
approximations such as “ki,” “kik,” “kiki,” “tiki,” ete., and 
after many trials “kitty.” In this simple case, what has 
been learned is obviously a reaction—a motor reaction— 
and the process of learning consists in trial after trial, 
until the proper reaction has been hit upon. Even then, 
the articulation is far from what it will be a year later; it 
is merely an approximation. Further improvement fol- 
lows the elimination of inhibiting reactions—too minute 
to be identified without knowledge of just what is hap- 
pening in each and every muscle of the tongue, lips, jaws, 
and lungs—and the chance selection of favorable reac- 
tions, equally minute. The total pattern of the specific 
reactions when the child speaks “kitty” clearly is quite 
different from the pattern which earlier produced an 
approximate “tiki.” 
The same may be said of all other-forms of motor 
learning—swimming, diving, whittling, writing, handling 
tools, catching a ball, and so on. We-léarn during the 
process of reaction; the big reattidmthat we can observe 
is an everchanging complex of smaller reactions. 
In-acquiring motor ‘reactions, of this there can be no 
_ doubt: one learns precisely the reaction that he hits 
upon. To be sure, each new attempt may produce a 
different response—quite different often—and for this 
there are several reasons. A single reaction is insufficient 
to fix the act permanently. Many of the constituent re- 
actions, never having occurred before, may die out from 
disuse before the next attempt. The next trial, more- 
over, introduces new stimuli, as when a boy proceeds to 
another trial at diving he approaches at slightly different 
speed, hits the plank at a different place, with legs or 
arms in a different position, or he may be more timid he- 
cause of the effect of the preceding attempt. Not only
-P-A-G-E-229
212 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
may the stimuli thus be different, and the reaction to 
some extent influenced by disuse, but if the interval be- 
tween trials is long, the complex act as retained in the 
nervous system may be distorted by the interfering effects 
of other reactions acquired in the interval. 
In Emotional Learning—What is true of acquired 
motor activities is true of emotional activities. A child 
learning to swim at first approaches the water, perhaps, 
with some trepidation. When the water reaches his 
knees, he becomes distinctly anxious, showing a tendency 
to cling to his instructor. Encouraged to wade to his 
waist, he is seized by a panic of fear. Now, by various 
devices that good instructors know, he finally goes into 
deep water with little more than anxiety, and in the 
course of time with positive delight. When once a de- 
sired reaction—a feeling of joy to the water-around-the- 
body-situation—is made, it may be stamped in by 
further exercise until well learned, so that later it occurs 
promptly and surely. 
While learning to swim, other reactions have been 
acquired. With reference to water, new impulses or 
tendencies to action have been learned. On seeing water 
the impulses to take off the clothes, jump in, and swim, 
are set up, whereas before, the tendencies were to make a 
cautious approach, dip in the hands, or wade in the 
shallow water. New percepts and ideas are also ac- 
quired. The feelings of being all submerged in a big 
body of water, and the memories of these feelings are, of 
course, learned. 
In Acquiring Information.—The fact that our per- 
cepts, memories, ideas, information, and conscious reac- 
tions of whatever sort are acquired reactions merits 
special emphasis. However clear it may be that our 
muscular reactions of swimming and diving are acquired
-P-A-G-E-230
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 213 
or that our joys, timidities, and fears secure new 
attachments as the result of reaction, our perceptions, 
memories, and ideas are likely to be conceived as the re- 
sult of passive absorption, or as having just come of 
themselves. Perhaps one reason is that, under such cir- -- 
cumstances, we experience little effort; the learning feels 
less active—in fact, it may seem to be an entirely passive 
process. Furthermore, the means by which other people 
go about motor learning and the actual reactions made 
are more .obvious—at least in the rough—to all. But 
just how or what other people observe, how or what they 
can recall, we discover less well. There is something in 
the ease and subjectivity of these mental acquisitions that 
leads us to think of them as passive, receptive, incidental, 
instead of reactions which we make actively. But the 
fact is that here as elsewhere learning is active and what 
we learn are the reactions to which we give birth. 
Suppose we attempt to discover just what we learn in 
a particular case. Get a colored picture of a farm-house 
or any other scene. Invite several others to study it 
with you for 30 seconds, after which each one is asked to 
write out a full account; or, better, to attempt to answer . 
a number of questions asked by an additional person 
holding the picture. It will at once be discovered that 
no one has mentally photographed the picture; no one 
finds that the picture has so impressed itself upon him 
that the details may be seen as if the picture were really 
there. On the contrary, few can give such details as the 
number of windows in the house; the number of clouds in 
the sky, etc. One striking result is that even if all ob- 
servers recall about equal amounts, which is very un- 
likely, they have learned different items. Obviously the 
process of learning, here, is not mere passive impression. 
The individuals learned, ie., remembered, only those
-P-A-G-E-231
214 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
items to which they reacted. Occasionally, a listless ob- 
server stares at such a picture—the full image of it being 
formed on his retina—without consciously, actively re- 
acting to it at all, and he may therefore be unable to re- 
call any details, although he may guess a few correctly if 
the picture is to some extent like pictures he has seen 
before. Different people learned different things be- 
cause they reacted in different ways to different items, 
but without reaction nothing is learned. 
How New Rzactions Are A6Quirep 
“We learn by “hitting upon” a reaction and then exer- 
cising it; but how do we “hit upon” the desired reaction? 
When the child is first given a pencil, he grasps it much 
as he would seize any small stick; but in the course of 
time he will have acquired new muscular reactions to 
this object. How were these new responses achieved? 
How does it happen that the native or initial reactions, 
being well established and easy to make, do not continue 
to occur unerringly? If a child is afraid of thunder, 
how does he ever get rid of this reaction, since, according 
to the Law of Use, the more he makes the fear reaction 
the more firmly it should become fixed. If he does con- 
quer his fear of thunder, what has become of that 
reaction? 
These are important matters that have been deliber- 
ately neglected so far; important but very difficult. 
Nevertheless, we shall have to attempt an explanation, 
for the practical solution of a good many problems to be 
encountered later depends upon the answer to the ques- 
tion: How are new reactions acquired? 
If we consider some of the purely mechanical features 
of learning we find that to a considerable extent what we
-P-A-G-E-232
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 215 
learn is determined by our environment, by the forces 
that act upon us. There are, of course, many traits 
which we acquire that we do not speak of as learned. 
The sun tans our skin, a disease may enlarge our joints, © 
a knife may cut our flesh, leaving a scar; these are ac- 
quired traits but scarcely learned traits. But in a simi- 
lar mechanical way, the situations which. we encounter 
may modify our behavior. Learning is, in fret, often de- 
scribed as adaptation to the environment; and the kind 
of adaptations made will vary with the features of the 
environment. We are, however, not passive in the mat- 
ter; it is by reacting to the environment that new re- 
actions are acquired. 
Most of the situations to which we react are very com- 
plex, including many specific stimuli in ever changing 
combination. These stimuli taken singly, or in small 
units constituting what we shall call elements of the gross 
situation, tend to produce specific effects; that is, each 
element tends to elicit a specific reaction. The reaction 
of the body to many stimuli occurring at once forms a 
complex reaction. Different combinations of stimuli pro- 
duce different complex reactions and to understand the 
total we must understand the working of the parts. To 
be thorough, we should take different stimuli, first one 
at a time, then two at a time, then three at a time, and 
so on, until we approximate the kind of gross situations 
comprising vast numbers of stimuli such as we encounter 
every day. This, however, will be impossible and un- 
necessary inasmuch as the principles can be disclosed by 
taking a simple combination, two stimuli at a time. 
Our equipment for explaining learning now consists of 
the Law of Use (or Frequency), the Law of Distise (or 
Recency), and a complex environment which provides 
specific stimuli in various combinations. We will pro-
-P-A-G-E-233
216 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
ceed to examine representative types of learning, illus- 
trating the way in which these principles operate, going 
as far as possible without introducing additional laws. 
Tf all forms of learning can be explained by use and 
disuse alone, this will be scientifically desirable because 
science prefers the simpler to the more complex assump- 
tions. If thse principles are insufficient it will be neces- 
sary to discover other factors to complete a description of 
learning. 
Most of the illustrations are selected from experiments 
upon. animals, partly because these are more available, 
partly because the behavior of animals, being more 
simple, is easier to describe. Ww 
Tuer AssociaATION oF SIMULTANEOUS REACTIONS 
New connections are established when two (or more) 
stimuli which elicit different but not mutually exclusive 
reactions are repeatedly presented simultaneously. When 
an object moves rapidly toward the eye, the native re- 
action is a wink; when the skin of the finger is stimulated 
with a slight electric shock, the native response is a quick 
withdrawal of the hand. If the two stimuli are given at 
once the result is a simultaneous wink and jerk of the 
hand. If we continue, time after time, to give the two 
stimuli at once and finally give only one—say the electric 
shock—the probable result is that both the jerk of the 
hand and the wink will occur at once. Or, if we move 
the object rapidly toward the eye, both wink and jerk 
will occur. Here, then, is a clear case of acquisition; we 
now have a combination of two responses to a stimulus 
which previously gave us only one. Or, to say the same 
thing in another way, we have acquired new connections: 
one between the eye stimulus and the hand effectors, and
-P-A-G-E-234
) j 
| THE LAWS OF LEARNING 217 
another between the hand stimulus and the wink mech- 
anism. New pathways through the nervous system have 
been opened up and strengthened by use (repetition) so 
that the nerve impulse flows through and Produces effec- 
tively. a new reaction. 
A significant feature of the nervous system is s that it 
provides pathways from each receptor to &% tremendous 
number, very likely, to all effectors (see pp. 56f.). Of 
these innumerable connections but few are strong enough 
to arouse the effectors as the result of ordinary stimula- 
tion; the others are ‘closed’ in the sense of ordinarily 
producing no observable reaction. So that in reality, 
physical connections between the eye stimulus and the 
hand muscles, as well as between the hand stimulus and 
the eyelid muscles must have been in existence to begin 
with. Let us call the stimulus, movement of the object 
toward the eye, S1 and the wink R1; the electric shock S2 
and the withdrawal of the hand R2. The connections 
are pictured in the figure below. The heavy line indicates 
CENTRAL 
STIMULUS CONNECTIONS RESPONSE 
s1 —__—_—_ Se x ———— Ri 
s2 —_——— “SN  y ———— R2 
a strong connection, the dash line a weak connection. 
Although S1 is actually connected with R2 it cannot 
alone arouse R2 because the intervening pathway (mainly 
the synapses at y) offers too much resistance. When S2 is 
stimulated at the same time, the barriers at y are broken 
down so that the impulse from §1 gets through, discharg- 
ing weakly, at first, into R2, according to the principle of 
facilitation (see page 59). By repetition of this com- 
bined stimulation, the impulse from S81, according to the 
Law of Use, would break through more and more readily.
-P-A-G-E-235
218 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF ee A 
In other words, the connection between 81 and R2 is 
gradually strengthened by use until $1 alone is capable of 
producing the response R2 as well as its original, Ri. All 
of this is true of the S2-R1 connection also. 
By the repeated association of two stimuli which 
produce two harmonious (in the sense that both can oc- 
cur at once) geactions, each stimulus becomes connected 
with both responses. To each has been attached a new 
reaction, in addition to the old one. The object- 
approaching-the-eye produces a jerk of the hand; the 
shock produces a wink. Neither of these was made, 
until the “subliminal” connection (a connection too weak 
to elicit an actual response) had been strengthened by the 
combined exercise. Thereafter, either stimulus pro- 
duces both responses; and according to the Law of Use, 
continually to administer one stimulus would further in- 
crease the strength of both connections, so that the com- 
bined response would occur more surely, promptly and 
easily. This raises the question as to whether both com- 
binations are identical. No, they are not; for the reason 
that the connection of each stimulus with its old response 
‘ always remains stronger. The object-approach-eye 
stimulus invariably produces a combination in which the 
wink is more emphatic; the finger shock produces a com- 
bination in which the finger jerk is more pronounced. 
While the reactions in both cases include both wink and 
finger jerk, it is necessary to think of them as a joint 
reaction determined by the strength of the particular 
connections between the specific stimuli and the specific 
responses. The justification for this is seen most clearly 
if you fail to exercise one of the joint reactions for a 
while. Fail to apply the shock stimulus for a time and 
the wink unit of the combination may fail to occur,—it 
has died out from disuse,—whereas the withdrawal of the
-P-A-G-E-236

hand, being more strongly connected with the stimulus, 
still occurs. 
The facts may be shown diagrammatically in the ac- 
companying figure.

In the figure the heavier the line the stronger is the

Association of Motor Reactions.—When a hungry 
kitten sees food it will run toward it. If a child displays 
food, at the same time calling “Kitty, kitty,” a sufficient 
number of times, the kitten will eventually respond to the 
call alone. When we are breaking a horse, it does not, 
of course, respond in any way except by pricking up its 
ears when we say “Whoa.” We stop the horse by pulling 
on the bit and if, at the same time, we shout “Whoa,” 
and repeat sufficiently, the horse will stop eventually at ° 
the word. In both of these cases new connections have 
been acquired. In both cases, the old response to “Kitty, 
kitty” or to “Whoa” was mainly an awareness of the 
sound with but little motor response. These responses 
still persist but occur simultaneously with the new reac- 
tions, iLe., running toward the call or stopping at “Whoa.” 
Association of Emotional Reactions.—Connections 
with glandular reactions, as well as with motor reactions, 
may be acquired in this way. To the stimulus, food in 
the mouth, a dog responds by secretion of saliva. If at 
the time food i is presented a bell is rung, the animal will, 
after sufficient triats, respond by the salivary reaction to
-P-A-G-E-237
220 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
the bell alone. It is in this way that the human mouth 
comes to “water” at the sight or smell of food, the sound 
of the dishes or the dinner bell, or the mere thought of 
food. Very diffuse organic or emotional reactions may 
be attached to new stimuli in this way. A man who 
suffered acute nausea in a room which smelled 
strongly of camphor finds that later the odor of camphor 
tends to reinstate the sickness. After a long voy- 
age, during which one has been seasick, the smell of ship 
or sea or the mere thought of them may turn one’s 
stomach in some degree. Similarly tears, mirth, affec- 
tion, or minor likes and dislikes may secure new attach- 
ments. In these instances, the reaction produced by the 
newly attached stimulus is not identical with the re- 
sponse produced by the original. It is merely a weakly 
aroused reaction of the same sort; weakly aroused since 
it, would require a great deal of exercise to make the new 
connection as strong as the old. 
Association in Informational Learning.—Certain 
types of information are acquired by attachments of this 
sort. When shown a leaf, the child reacts by becoming 
aware of the object. If, while showing the object, one 
says the word “leaf” a number of times, the child will, at 
length, think of the object when he hears the word alone. 
Thus he learns the meaning of the spoken word; for 
the word itself is merely a combination of auditory 
stimuli, of course, not in the least like the visual appear- 
ance of a leaf. Next, we may show the object (or say 
“leaf”) while the child looks at the printed word “leaf.”’ 
With sufficient combined repetition, the child now thinks 
of the object when he sees the printed word. Later the 
object, a picture of the object, the spoken, written or 
printed word, may be coupled with the French word “la 
feuille” and the two together reacted to until he thinks
-P-A-G-E-238
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 221 
of the object pr, at least, something which stands for the 
object, when he sees the French word. 
Association in Perception.——In actual life, the simulta- 
neous stimuli are not invariably limited to two; indeed, 
the usual cage includes many more, but the principle is- 
the same. If is by the combination of many reactions,. 
for example, that percepts are built up. When a child is 
first given al} apple he makes a good many reactions to 
the many stimuli which the fruit provides. He becomes 
aware of its odor, of its evlor, of its shape, its weight, and 
its taste by responding to the several olfactory, visual and 
other stimuli, simultaneously or in immediate succession. 
The several responses become attached to each of the 
several stimuli and with frequent repetition of the ex- 
periences, one stimulus alone may activate simultane- 
ously, to some degree, the several reactions. The apple 
is thus perceived when only seen or smelled or felt. 
We become at once aware of it as a combination of such 
and such tastes, odors, shape, weight, etc. An apple per- 
ceived through the sense of touch is not exactly the same 
as the percept of an apple smelled, tasted or seen. But 
the perceptual reaction is so quick, and our interest in it 
so practical, generally, that we do not observe the fine 
differences. We simply become aware of an apple, 
neglecting the sensory and other minor details. 
The samples of learning so far considered are, of course, 
acquired by use, once the possibility of the exercise of the 
new connection is established. The inter-connections in 
the nervous system make possible limitless additions of 
connection; all that is needed, apparently, is simultaneous 
presentation and exercise. If we can attach the wink 
reaction to a stimulus on the finger or the salivary 
reaction to the sound of a bell, it would appear that ~ 
we can attach any stimulus to any response. So we
-P-A-G-E-239
222 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
may generalize: (ou means of association and exer- 
cise any reaction” which the organism can make may 
be attached to any stimulus to which the organism is 
sensitive. 
This is an important generalization but should it be 
called a law and be put on a par with the Law of Use 
‘or Disuse? If we examine the facts closely it will appear 
that exercise is really doing the work. From the start 
there existed real but weak (subliminal) connections 
which were strengthened when the proper combination 
of the stimuli was provided. We have merely described 
the results of the operation of the Law of Use under cer- 
tain conditions; namely, when two (or more) stimuli 
leading to different but not mutually exclusive reactions 
are repeatedly presented together. 
Tur ELIMINATION or CONNECTIONS BY SIMULTANEOUS 
ASSOCIATION 
Learning does not consist entirely of addition or 
strengthening of connections. Elimination or weakening 
of connections already present is quite as important. A 
reaction may be eliminated by the simultaneous presen- 
tation of two (or more) stimuli which lead to mutually 
exclusive reactions. 
An Experiment with a Perch.—A minnow thrown into 
an aquarium with a hungry perch will be very promptly 
seized, since the former acts as a stimulus to one of the 
strongest of the latter’s native food-getting reactions. If 
a glass partition is placed dividing the aquarium into 
halves, the perch in attempting to seize a minnow thrown 
into the opposite compartment bumps into the trans- 
parent obstruction. On receiving the bump, the big fish 
turns about and swims to the edge of its compartment.
-P-A-G-E-240
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 223 
Shortly, it darts at the minnow again only to be halted 
by the same punishment. It will suffer a good many 
bumps on the first day before giving up entirely, but on 
the next day fewer bumps are effective; and so on, until 
after thirty days, when the minnow is thrown in, instead 
of attacking, the perch swims off to the side or engages 
in other activity. The attack reaction has been, tem- 
porarily at least, eliminated. The bump not only blocked 
the old reaction but set up a turn-about-and-swim-away 
reaction which by simultaneous association became at- 
tached to the old stimulus. When the perch now sees a 
minnow, the nerve impulse is shifted into the turn-away 
reaction. This may be shown in a diagram.

‘An Experiment with an Infant.—An infant while play- 
ing with some pets, which it fondled with pleasure, was 
frightened by a crashing noise. The child, of course, 
could not fondle the pets and at the same time withdraw 
in fear. The fear reaction, getting the right of way, put 
a stop to the caressing of the animal. The interesting 
thing about this case was that later when the child saw 
one of the pets he no longer approached it with pleasure 
but retreated in fear. This was not a combination of two 
reactions, but. a selection of one reaction and elimination 
of the other. The nerve impulse aroused by the sight of 
the animal has been shifted from its old course into an- 
other. The fear has been substituted for the fondling 
reaction. So far as the mechanism of association is con- 
' cerned, this case is quite like the previous one, as shown 
in the accompanying diagram.

The elimination of the attack on the minnow by the 
perch might be explained by the simultaneous introduc- 
tion of a stimulus (the bump from the glass partition) 
which proves an effective block and which also sets up a 
mutually exclusive or “incongruous” reaction—the turn- 
away. In the case of the child who acquired a fear-and- 
retreat reaction on sight of the animals, there is.scarcely 
a blocking of the original response of approach, although 
there is introduced an “incongruous” reaction. That is, 
the child cannot simultaneously approach-to-caress and 
withdraw in fear. The latter reaction wins out conceiv- 
ably because it is stronger and by means of association 
becomes attached to the stimulus which originally led to 
the incompatible response of approaching-to-fondle. 
Elimination without a Blocking.—Responses are elimi- 
nated, however, when no block or obstruction or other 
stimulus is present to set up an incongruous reaction. A 
famous experiment, performed by G. W. and E. G. Peck- 
ham, will serve as an illustration: These observers found 
that a spider dropped hurriedly from its web at the sound 
of a tuning fork. When it had climbed back, a repeti- 
tion of the stimulus produced the same dropping reac- 
tion; but after eight or nine trials the stimulus suddenly 
lost its power; the spider failed to react by dropping from 
the web. Next day, however, the stimulus was effective 
for a time but failed after six or seven repetitions, and 
after about ten days the dropping reaction ceased entirely 
—at least for a time. In this experiment the spider’s re- 
action was in no way blocked; no pain was involved; no
-P-A-G-E-242
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 225 
definite incongruous reaction was set up. “The connec- 
tion between the sound of the tuning fork and the re- 
sponse of dropping, which was at first prompt and cer- 
tain, had been gradually stamped out. 
Limrrations oF THE Laws or Us anp Disuse 
This is really a most curious matter. The dropping- 
to-the-ground reaction had been eliminated in the very 
process of exercise. According to the Law of Use, the 
tendency to drop at the sound of the tuning fork should 
have been strengthened; should have become more 
prompt and certain. Instead of that, it gradually be- 
eame less prompt and certain, finally being eliminated 
entirely. 
This phenomenon might well bring the Law of Use 
under serious suspicion. This experiment, however, does 
not discredit the Law of Use but portrays one of its limi- 
tations. Exercise is a true and faithful servant of learn- 
ing, but it is unable to do all the work alone. In fact, all 
along we have been neglecting another and possibly more 
powerful factor, one which we must shortly bring for- 
ward. Before so doing, it will be advisable to present a 
few more illustrations of the inadequacy of the Laws of 
Use and Disuse, in which the new factors, which con- 
tribute to the control of learning, are more clearly 
portrayed. 
For one investigation, a box was constructed in such a 
way as to offer to a rat placed in a certain compartment 
four different avenues of escape, all of which led to food. 
The box is pictured in Figure 22. One way led through a 
small compartment in which the rat always received a 
slight electric shock as he passed; a second led to a similar 
compartment, in which the rat was confined for twenty
-P-A-G-E-243

seconds before being permitted to proceed; a third led to__ 
a long pathway to be traversed before food was reached ; 
and the fourth compartment provided a short pathway 
directly to the food. The positions of the four little /

  Ficurs 22. The experimental compartment box showing the several 
routes. In the actual experiment the compartments were rearranged 
for different groups of rats, e.g., for one group “confinement” would be 
situated on the left, for another in the second position, as pictured 
above, for another in the third position and for another on the right. 
Thus no type of “effect” was given the conceivable advantage of a 
favorable position. Movable doors were also provided to force the 
rat_in the direction desired after emerging from the compartment. 
(After Kuo. Journal of Comparative Psychology, Feb., 1922.) 
compartments were so arranged that a particular rat, on 
his first trial, was as likely to enter one as another; so, by 
using a number of rats, it was possible to ascertain the 
factors which guided choice. Each of thirteen rats was 
given trials until it had finally selected and thoroughiy 
learned one of the four ways.
-P-A-G-E-244
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 227 
At first, a rat was as likely to take one way as another, 
with the result that in the first four trials each way to 
the food was practised equally often, approximately. But 
soon all had given up the pathway which produced the 
shock. A little later all had refused the way which pro- 
duced the twenty seconds of confinement. The long way 
was eliminated more slowly; but finally all but two went 
by the short route. Now, by the Law of Use alone, an 
equal number should have learned permanently to go by 
each route, since each was chosen and exercised equally 
often at the beginning. But the fact was that the exer- 
cise which brought pain failed to be effective; the rats 
soon gave up that route. Practice of the trip which 
brought confinement was more effective; but finally that 
route was eliminated by the whole group. Use of the 
round-about pathway was likewise insufficiently effective, 
since with the exception of two rats all gave it up, al- 
though they relinquished this pathway less promptly 
than they did the first two routes. 
Another illustration, similar in principle, may be more 
clear. Suppose that after five cats have been taught to 
come to the call of “Kitty, kitty,” each is called singly, 
and No. 1 is given food and later caressed, No. 2 is 
caressed only, No. 3 is totally disregarded, No. 4 is 
sprinkled gently with water, and No. 5 is douched with 
water. Assuming that all have just learned to respond 
to the call and that other conditions such as hunger, fa~ 
tigue, the satisfaction oceasioned by the activity under 
way at the time called, etc., are approximately equal, 
they should all learn to come more promptly and surely 
by virtue of exercise, as they are repeatedly called. But 
will they? Cat No. 1, which was fed and petted, will 
probably come more and more surely and promptly; No. 
2, which was merely petted, will probably continue to
-P-A-G-E-245
228. PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
come but not so promptly as No. 1; No. 3, which was 
entirely disregarded, will probably continue to respond 
for a while, but less promptly and frequently, finally fail- 
ing altogether; No. 4, which was sprinkled, will probably 
give it up more quickly than No. 3; and No. 5, which was 
douched, will probably very promptly show a failure 
to respond. 
The Influence of the Effect of a Reaction,—There is no 
doubt about it: influences other than exercise are at 
work here. Very potent influences they must be to nullify 
and augment the results of exercise as they do in the 
illustrations just given. Apparently there is something 
about the effect which accompanies or follows an act that 
either reinforces or decreases the results of use or causes 
an animal to repeat the act in one case and avoid it in the 
other, or both. Pain, confinement, the holding up of a © 
tendency under way, futile or wasteful work all tend to 
stamp out the reactions which they accompany or follow. 
On the other hand, reactions which bring release from 
confinement or pain, which bring food, kindly treatment, 
or attention, are repeated and stamped in more rapidly 
than when they are exercised with an indifferent result. 
It is the reaction which brings, broadly speaking, a satis- 
fying state of affairs, absolute or relative, that is repeated 
and stamped in quickly during use. The more satisfying 
the resulting state the more surely the reaction will be 
repeated and the more quickly stamped in. On the other 
hand, those reactions which are avoided or are stamped 
out even during the process of exercise, are the ones 
which are accompanied or followed by annoying states 
of affairs or annoying effects. 
It is upon such experiments as these, among others, 
that the concept of the satisfying and annoying states of 
affairs, as dynamic factors in determining behavior is

Tuer Law or Errecr 
We now need a general statement to cover the observed 
facts concerning the influence of the effects of a response 
upon the individual’s future behavior. We need one or 
more generalizations that will embrace the.facts in a 
simple yet faithful way. The following statement seems 
to be satisfactory: The individual tends to repeat and 
learn quickly those reactions which are accompanied or 
followed by a satisfying state of affairs. The individual 
tends not to repeat or Learn quickly | y those reactions which 
or. follow an. annoying _state of 
affairs. These statements constitute the Law of ‘Effect. 
The influence of the satisfying or annoying state of af- 
fairs may be that of a selective agent. When the indi- 
vidual is annoyed by a reaction, he tends to avoid that 
reaction in the future and consequently does not acquire 
the reaction through exercise. When the individual is 
satisfied, he is attracted rather than repelled by the 
stimulus; he tends to repeat the same reaction which is 
consequently stamped in or learned. It.may be that the 
satisfying and annoying states of affairs exert their influ- 
ence entirely by way of the general orientation to 
approach-and-repeat in the one case and to avoid in the 
other. 
Thorndike, in his pioneer work on animal learning, was 
led to ascribe more far-reaching effects to satisfaction and 
annoyance than a mere general orientation or selective 
tendency. He was inclined to believe that “satisfying- 
ness” and “annoyingness” were intimately associated 
with the subtle changes in the neurones themselves, which 
in one case intensify or further the effects of exercise 
and in the other reduce or nullify them. These hy- 
potheses are contained in the following quotation: “When
-P-A-G-E-248
THE LAWS OF LEARNING “931 
a modifiable connection between a situation and a re- 
sponse is made and is accompanied or followed by a 
satisfying state of affairs, its strength is increased: when 
made and accompanied or followed by an annoying state 
of affairs, its strength is decreased.” That is, the effects 
of exercise influence the neurones in the one case in a way 
favorable to strengthening the connections and in the 
other case in a way to weaken the connections. Just 
what the inner results of satisfyingness and annoyingness 
are is not as yet known. This fact cannot be urged 
against the theory, however, since there is similar lack of 
information concerning the neural changes brought about 
by use and disuse, whose efficacy is universally admitted. 
While the precise mode of operation of satisfying and 
annoying states of affairs or effects is not known, there 
can be no doubt about the validity and necessity of the 
first generalization, namely, that individuals tend to re- 
peat and learn quickly those reactions which are accom- 
panied or followed by satisfaction; and they tend not to 
repeat those reactions which are accompanied or followed 
by annoying states of affairs. The effect of a reaction 
thus tends to determine what connections are acquired or 
eliminated. 
APPLICATIONS OF THE Law or Hrrgcr 
A little more attention must be given to the matter of 
elimination of connections, now that we have the Law of 
Effect to apply, because it has some important implica- 
tions for learning, particularly when we are dealing with 
very strong tendencies. Let us recall the experiment 
with the perch. When the perch received the bump on 
the nose he turned about and swam away. The annoy- 
ing effect of the bump weakened the tendency to attack
-P-A-G-E-249
rE 
a 
232 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
until finally, when the perch observed a minnow he 
turned away instead of attacking as before. The turn- 
away reaction has been substituted for attack, as shown 
in the accompanying diagram. 
AT FIRST: LATER: 
: Sight of minnow 
Sight of minnow Vy attack 
Bump on nose 4S turn away turn away 
What happens to the old reaction—that of attacking a 
minnow when it is seen? Since it is no longer being ex- 
ercised, it is of course dying out, according to the Law of 
Disuse. But so strong a tendency as that of a fish to 
seize its food takes a long time to die out from mere 
disuse. Many acquired reactions, which are probably 
less deeply imbedded in our nervous system, will scarcely 
die out from disuse in the course of a lifetime. If you 
could, by some miracle, refrain from saying, thinking, or 
otherwise using your name, how long would it be before 
recall would be impossible? Certainly a very long time, 
probably more than fifty years. So the perch’s tendency 
to seize minnows is still in existence but, for the present, 
another reaction is taking its place, namely, the tendency 
to turn away—a reaction originally made to the bump 
on the nose but now made directly to the presence of the 
minnow. How long will this substitute reaction keep 
up? Just so long as it remains stronger than the other 
tendency. But actually in this experiment the perch 
gradually lost the turning-away reaction and went back 
to his old trick of seizing the minnows. Why? Because 
the substitute reaction, although exercised, produces no 
satisfying effect. On the contrary, it becomes annoying 
and thus its strength is reduced until the old reaction 
gets the upper hand,
-P-A-G-E-250
  
THE LAVAS OF LEARNENG 233 
These facts may be illustrated by observation of human 
behavior. A child is natively self-assertive—so forward 
and boastful that the parent in an attempt to break his 
tendency demands, on each outbreak, that the child sit 
quietly and silently for five minutes. After this has been 
done several times, the situation which previously elicited 
a boastful outbreak now tends to produce cautious re- 
marks, because of the effect of the earlier punishment. 
With no outbreaks, of course, goes no further punishment 
and as time goes on, the holding in of the impulse to 
boasting becomes annoying, which steadily weakens the 
acquired reaction until finally the old reaction breaks out 
again. One cure for it is further punishment; but there 
is another way of dealing with the situation, namely, by 
making the substitute reaction satisfying. 
If the perch, when it turned toward the side of the 
aquarium after the bump, had been given food and 
similarly rewarded on each succeeding instance, it would 
eventually, on seeing a minnow, promptly turn to the side 
where it was fed. If the child had been greatly satisfied 
by praise or some other reward whenever it refrained 
from unseemly self-assertion, the more modest reaction 
would have been gradually built up through exercise and 
effect where exercise alone might have failed. Here then 
is the essence of eliminating undesirable tendencies; start 
the desirable substitute reaction somehow, by punishment 
if necessary, but build it up by making it satisfying. 
Social disapproval, harmless deprivations, and other 
annoyers may do as well as punishment. Any stimulus 
that will elicit the desired substitute reaction is what is 
needed. For example, in attempting to “break” the 
child of fear and crying during thunderstorms, scolding, 
threats, or other punishments only make matters worse. 
Show an interest in the lightning, call attention to its

novelty and beauty and thus substitute for the undesir- 
able reactions curious observation. When you get that, 
or some better substitute, reward it by praise. It is thus 
by the proper manipulation of satisfyers and annoyers as 
well as by practice that the course of learning may be 
most effectively directed. 
Two additional facts should be taken into account in 
utilizing satisfiers and annoyers. The first is that the ef- 
fects of either become greater the more closely it is asso- 
ciated with the reaction in time. To be really effective, 
satisfiers and annoyers. must accompany the reaction or 
at least follow it promptly. - If long delayed they may be 
ineffective or they may become attached to an entirely 
different reaction. The second fact is that satisfiers and 
annoyers differ in degree or intensity and that the greater 
the intensity up to a certain limit, the greater the effect 
on learning. Food for a hungry cat is a more intense sat- 
isfier than petting; a bucket of water dashed on a cat isa 
more intense annoyer than a sprinkling. What states of 
affairs satisfy and what annoy human individuals was 
disclosed in a measure in the studies of the original nature 
of man. 
SuMMARY 
1. Exercise always means reacting. 
2. Other things being equal, when a reaction is made 
to a stimulus the strength of the connection is increased. 
The increased strength is due to modification -of the mech- 
anisms — mainly the neurones involved. Increased 
strength of a connection makes the response more easy, 
prompt, and certain. ~ This is the Law of Use. 
. 8. Other things being equal, a period of disuse results 
in the weakening of the connection between the stimulus 
and the response. This is the Law of Disuse. a

4, Reastians which are accompanied or. followed by a 
satisfying state of affairs are more likely to be repeated 
and, consequently, learned. It is possible also that satis- 
fying exercise strengthens the connection more rapidly 
than exercise alone. Reactions which are accompanied 
or followed by an annoying state of affairs are unlikely to 
be repeated and, consequently, unlikely to be learned. It 
is probable, moreover, that annoyingness tends directly to 
weaken the strength of connections, and thus to eliminate 
reactions. 
5. New S-R connections may be formed when two (or 
more) stimuli which elicit two (or more) compatible re- 
actions are repeatedly given simultaneously. This is 
possible because exercise and effect strengthen connec- 
tions that were already in existence but were too weak to 
operate. Each stimulus may now produce both reac- 
tions, each with a degree of certainty and vigor that 
is dependent upon the strength of the particular con- 
nections, 
6. Annoyingness may result in the elimination of one 
or more existing connections. Thus, a cat which has 
ed to come to the call of “Kitty, kitty,” will even-

least! temporarily) when two stimuli, which lead to mu- 
tually exclusive reactions, are repeatedly given together.

than the original undesirable reaction.

CHAPTER XI 
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING IN 
COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 
Learning, as we observed in the preceding chapter, con- 
sists in the strengthening and weakening of connections 
between situations and responses. When two or more 
stimuli operate at once, new connections may be formed 
in the sense of being strengthened from subliminal to 
functioning strength-by means of exercise and effect, and 
old connections may be eliminated in the sense of being 
weakened until incapable of operation, or in the sense of 
being supplanted by new connections attached to the 
same situation. In general, then, all learning may be 
said to consist in the addition and subtraction of work- 
ing S-R connections. -The acquisition of any new com- 
plex reaction is the result of a great many additions and 
subtractions of connections, and each change is brought 
about in the ways illustrated in the preceding chapter. 
Several conditions are needed to provide a typical n- 
lustration of complex learning. First, there must be 
some stimulus to arouse the organism to activity. The 
stimulus must either produce an annoying situation 
which the animal attempts to avoid (hunger or confine- 
ment would bea sample) or a state of readiness for or 
impulsion toward some consummatory reaction. Thus 
the presence of food might arouse an impulsion to reach 
for it and eat. These conditions are necessary, otherwise 
the animal would settle down comfortably with the result 
238

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING 239 
that nothing is learned. Second, the animal must be 
confronted by a complex situation comprising many fea- 
tures (or stimuli) to which it may react. Third, the suc- 
cessful reactions, in the typical case of complex learning, 
must be not as yet habituated. With these conditions 
fulfilled, the operations of the Laws of Exercise and Effect 
may be observed, resulting, as they may, in the weakening 
or elimination of certain connections, the selection and 
strengthening of others and the combination of responses 
into various types of combined reactions. 
In this chapter, several types of learning will be illus- 
trated with some attention given to their similarities and 
differences; the learning of animals will be compared with 
that of man; and the amount, rate, limit, and permanence 
of learning will be treated in a general way. 
TRIAL AND Error IN LEARNING 
Learning the Way through a Maze.—If an animal 
can learn at all, it can learn its “way about.” A maze, 
consequently, is a useful device for studying learning. By 
using labyrinths of varied difficulty it is possible to get a 
rough measure of the learning capacity of different 
species, 
Ordinarily, mere confinement in a maze is sufficient to 
arouse the animal to activity but usually food is added as 
an incentive; the animal is rewarded by finding food at 
the end of the correct course. 
A worm, a small chick, or a turtle can master a simple 
maze; but a rat, which is able to learn fairly complex 
pathways, is more frequently used in experimental work. 
Placed in a maze, as shown in Figure 23, the rat begins to 
nose about cautiously. He explores here and there, sniff- 
ing at everything as he goes. A human subject would
-P-A-G-E-257
2490 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
study the features encountered, with his eyes rather than 
his nose. After going into a blind alley, the rat explores 
it thoroughly before coming out. If it receives a slight 
electric shock on reaching the terminus of certain blind 
alleys, it scampers out and very likely moves on or pos- 
sibly retraces its steps to the more familiar territory al-

ready covered. After a time, it will venture again, and 
perhaps after many errors eventually finds its way 
through the maze to the food box. During a second trial, 
the rat works its way through the maze cautiously as be- 
fore, but with fewer entrances into blind alleys, especially 
those wherein the shocks were experienced. It takes 
many trials, the number depending in part on the com- 
plexity of the maze, before the rat, by a gradual process
-P-A-G-E-258

of elimination of annoying errors and acquisition of sat- 
isfying correct reactions, is able to follow the proper 
course unerringly. The rat has now acquired a series of 
reactions which with reference to the features of the maze 
situation are new. So far as one can observe, the learning 
process consists of: (1) the making of reactions, native 
or previously acquired, to the features of the situation, 
ie., old reactions which constitute the “trials”; (2) the 
gradual elimination of the annoying errors, i.e., the old or 
trial reactions which bring painful shocks or which end in 
failure to relieve the confinement; (3) the gradual stamp- 
ing in of the reactions which were satisfying because they 
furthered the animal’s progress toward escaping confine- 
ment and reaching food; and (4) the linking together of 
the various successful reactions into what appears to be 
essentially a unit, embracing all of the several steps or 
constituent reactions. 
An outstanding characteristic of such learning is the 
great number of “trial” reactions and the numerous 
“errors” which occur before the animal hits upon the suc- 
cessful responses. The animal at first makes an enormous 
number of reactions, and the process of elimination and 
selection is gradual. Even when the correct series of 
steps have been made, trial and error are still found, 
sometimes of a sort too subtle to be readily observed. 
Tiny errors are still being made and eliminated; very 
minute improvements are constantly being achieved. 
The progress of learning is not steady; the number of 
errors made or the amount of time taken gives a zigzag 
curve of learning as illustrated in Figure 24. This type 
of learning is described as “trial, error and success” or, 
more frequently, “trial and error’ learning. 
How Human Subjects Learn a Maze.—If a college 
student is given a maze to solve which is as difficult for

242 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
his species as the one described is for rats, the general 
process of learning will be the same. Hunger or annoy- 
ance at confinement may not be required to arouse his 
activity and thus make learning possible, but some mo- 
vimuree tive—the desire to accomplish some- 
«Lo thing, to learn something, to display 
ability, to get through with a prescribed 
experiment—must be invoked. Once 
under way, the student proceeds until 
an error is made, whereupon he retraces 
his steps and goes ahead again. If he 
receives an electric shock in some blind 
alley, he, like the rat, is likely to elim- 
inate that error early. When he has 
completed the maze, several more trials 
are required to establish the new, suc-

made has a greater effect; it is “stamped in” or “stamped 
out” more readily. If he notices a sign on the right way 
or gets a shock in the blind alley, these experiences are 
retained better. The human learner also indulges to a 
greater extent in mental activity. By means of memory, 
he can represent or recall some of the situations and the 
responses which he made to them. Arriving at an inter- 
section of paths, some sign—the look of the place—may 
enable him to recall the alley and what he did in it at the 
Jast trial. Man, more than the animal or even the child, 
stands at the crossway and contemplates, and thus often 
saves energy, time, and errors. The animal and the child 
keep on the move and usually make more errors. But 
the “memories” or “ideas” of the man add nothing to the 
general character of the process. They are trials and may 
lead to error or success, just as the animal’s actual move- 
ments do. The “ideas” are merely substitutes for actual 
observation and movement. 
Types of Mental Activities Involved in Learning a 
Maze.—How many and what types of activity are in- 
volved in learning the way through a maze? Does it in- 
volve motor learning? Is it a case of acquiring muscular 
skill? Yes, it certainly involves the formation of motor 
habits. “Skill,” as generally used, is a broad term which 
includes essentially all forms of motor learning; so our 
answer is “yes” to both questions. Could it be said that 
learning a maze involves perception or observation? Are 
percepts built up? ‘Yes, indeed. The good use of visual 
perception, by man at least, is an essential feature. If 
the problem is a “pencil maze” to be learned while blind- 
folded, tactual percepts are important. A blind man, 
more experienced in tactual learning, would have some 
advantage here, whereas in a large maze, lacking’ vision. 
he would be at some disadvantage; but here he would
-P-A-G-E-261
244 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
make good use of auditory perception, detecting walls and 
open and closed alleys, for example, by interpreting the 
echo of his footsteps. A rat would use olfactory percep- 
tion more than humans do, thus detecting traces of his 
previous course, unless the scent has been carefully 
washed out by the experimenter. Does learning a maze 
involve memory? Again, yes. Memory is merely a 
name for one form of retention, namely, the retention 
of things and events observed or perceived. We may 
profit by remembering or recalling the cireumstances at- 
tending previous trials. Does learning a maze involve 
reasoning? Yes, it may. Reasoning, in fact, is trial- 
and-error learning and as the term is ordinarily used it 
refers to the manipulation of or exploration among ideas 
or conscious representations of actual things and events. 
Learning a maze, in fact, may engage all of one’s men- 
tal processes. When a man or animal learns he works 
pretty much asa whole. The mental processes are rather 
artificial abstractions of parts of the total activity. Some- 
times muscular activity and retention of the reactions 
acquired, as in the maze, are prominent; sometimes the 
conscious activities and retention of them, as in memoriz- 
‘ing poetry or solving a problem in mental arithmetic, are 
relatively conspicuous; sometimes emotional acquisitions 
or control, as in learning to drive an airplane, are im- 
portant. But in all of these the mechanics of learning are 
essentially the same,—many reactions, the elimination of 
‘those which annoy and the sélection and strengthening 
of those which satisfy. 
A Comparison of Memorizing and Maze Learning.— 
Let us examine a case of learning in which overt bodily 
movements are but slightly involved; one which is 
mainly observation and recall, but otherwise similar to
-P-A-G-E-262
cmv CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING 245 
the maze experiment. Memorizing a ‘series of “non- 
sense” words is a case in point. The subject is given a 
series of twenty words like the following: 
nup, tib, nult, remp, zuc, ralt, marb, selz, kib, curg, 
tog, sor, dit, quos, viz, pelm, rulb, onk, qat, are 
Such a list is by no means learned through sheer impres- 
sion, absorption, or repetition. While the learner may 
not always realize it, the process comprises false 
starts and stops, errors, confusions, the addition of 
connections, elimination of connections—all of the 
features of learning a maze. 
A typical attack by an efficient learner would be some- 
what like this: First, a reading of the series for purposes 
of general orientation; next, perhaps careful observation 
of the first and second syllables and possibly the last 
two—nearly always these are learned first. Then the 
‘whole series may be broken up into units or “feet.” The 
first foot may contain nup, tib, nult and be read with a 
rhythm such as~’~ ~ followed by similar groupings. The 
first syllable in each of these groups may be observed 
with special care. The learner may notice and try to 
remember that the last word of the first group, nult, 
has four letters, and that it is followed by another, remp, 
with four letters. However, he may discard this when 
he finds that tib-nult may be combined into a word that 
sounds a little like a town he once visited, and this in 
turn may be discarded when he observes that nult almost 
rhymes with ralé, which occupies a similar metrie posi- 
tion. A word like quos is thought of as “such a mouth 
full”; whereas viz is “buzzy” and dit is short and snappy. 
Selz is remembered because. it is short for “seltzer.” 
Learners usually keep an active lookout for meaningful 
reactions and this is trial and error in its clearest form. 
I / cs sriey
-P-A-G-E-263
246 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
Suppose, for example, that you see how many meaningful 
associations you can make with gip? Note how you try, 
one after another, a great many ideas—some satisfactory, 
others unsatisfactory. 
On the whole, memorizing a series of words, far from 
being a mere passive, mechanical process of repeating one 
syllable after another, is highly active—or reactive—and 
presents all of the features of other trial-and-error learn- 
ing. The good learner is actively observing and searching 
for clues. He tries reacting by possible meanings, possi- 
ble sounds, possible combinations with other words, 
possible similarities or contrasts. Many of these are tried 
out only to be discarded; others are selected; and before 
the list is learned the path is strewn with discarded trials. 
What is finally learned may be called roughly a series 
of reactions, just as the way through the maze was a series 
of reactions. 
In memorizing, just as in learning a maze, one attains 
the first successful trip through the series after many 
trials, and even with that achievement much remains 
to be ledrned by further practice. There are recurrences 
of difficulties and errors—the curve of learning is zigzag, 
like that of the rat’s in the maze. 
Is memorizing a series of non-sense syllables exclu- 
sively 2 mental function? By no means. New types of 
eye movements might have been acquired and new 
articulatory reactions—those required to say ralt, for 
example. Even if one memorized silently, some of the 
speech organs were in action. Emotional learning was 
also involved, as it is in mastering any new function. 
One must acquire control of anger, mirth, chagrin, excite- 
ment, and perhaps other emotions which are very prone 
to arise in the early stages of adjusting to a new situa- 
tion, When the learner looks at “selz” and in thinking
-P-A-G-E-264
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING 247 
about it is reminded of “selzer,” or when he discovers 
during thought that tib-nult is something like the name 
of a town once known, the process is similar to reasoning. 
So in memorizing, as in learning a maze, all of one’s 
mental processes and other types of reactions may be 
employed. 
The Limits of Improvement.—Learning the way 
through a maze or memorizing a series of non-sense 
syllables are relatively short processes—at least for 
human subjects—although it would be possible to make 
them so long and difficult that weeks of effort would be 
required for mastery. When the solution of such a task 
has been achieved, moreover, but few reactions, and these 
neither strictly new nor difficult, are required to repeat it. 
We simply walk through the maze or say words, finally; 
both are easy acts. It is the order of doing them that is 
new. When once this has been accomplished the 
remainder of the work is relatively simple and soon a 
performance limit is reached. 
Tue Course or ImpRovEMENT IN LEARNING 
Compiex FUNCTIONS 
Such complex functions as reading, writing, drawing, 
singing, playing the piano, typewriting, playing tennis, 
swimming, manipulating geometrical or algebraic data, 
diagnosing diseases, writing poetry or prose, running a 
bank, ete., require years of learning before a physiological 
limit is reached. In these cases the acquired reactions are 
very complex, relatively new, and ever changing, if one 
keeps on actually learning. 
In Typewriting.—The experimental studies of type- 
writing afford about the best illustrations of the learning 
of such complex functions. If the subject learns by the
-P-A-G-E-265
248 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
touch method, he starts to work as follows: Looking at 
his copy, he finds the first word “what” and thinks of 
““y.” _He now looks at a picture of the keyboard, locates _ 
“sy,” and then, finding a corresponding position on the 
actual keyboard (the letters of which are covered), he 
makes a stroke. The same procedure for “h” and “a” 
and “t.” After a time, the task of looking at the picture 
of the keyboard is eliminated, first for a few and gradu- 
ally for more letters. The process then is: see the word, 
think of the first letter, “w,” think of its position on the 
mental picture or representation of the keyboard, locate 
its position among the keys, and strike. The keyboard 
has been reacted to consciously (by observation) until 
it may be represented mentally; i.e., it has been memor- 
ized. Of course this is a gradual process so that prior 
to complete mastery there is an overlapping; some 
letters may be recalled, while others must be looked up. 
Needless to say, writing at this stage is very slow and 
errors are frequent. Shortly the learner finds that the 
mental image of the position of the keys is unnecessary 
for certain letters; they may be thought of as on the 
board. Later, it becomes unnecessary to think of the 
position of certain letters at all. Merely seeing the letter 
to be writtén acts as a stimulus to carry the hand and 
finger to the right spot. The elimination of the several 
mental steps results in a great saving of time, energy, and 
usually, of errors, While there has been great progress, 
however, in respect to the elimination of many useless 
acts and the perfecting of the finger work in striking the 
keys, the learner is still in the “letter stage,” making a 
particular complex reaction to each letter. 
Further eliminations and selections, almost too subtle 
to be observed by the experimenter or to be appreciated 
by the learner, result in a combined reaction to two
-P-A-G-E-266
i 
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING 249 
letters. For example, when “what” is observed, the 
thought of the “wh” sets off two strokes as if they were a 
unit; the same for the “at” and for other similar units 
that are frequently encountered. While this unification 
is spreading to less familiar combinations, longer units 
such as “are,” “the,” “ter”; and soon “they,” “ough,” 
and later whole words or even phrases are written as 
unified acts. The transitions to broader units are made 
at different stages for different words; the easier or more 
frequently used first, the more difficult or infrequent 
later. 
Meanwhile speed and accuracy have been steadily but 
irregularly increasing. Numberless futile reactions have 
been discarded. At first the learner may grit his teeth, 
press the table with his knees—literally write all over. 
These reactions are gradually eliminated as are more 
subtle irrelevant errors which result fin hitting too hard 
or too easy, in missing the keys, or timing badly so that 
the keys clutter frequently. Periods of emotional upset, 
anger, chagrin, despair, disgust, great elation, and the 
like are very common at first, but are brought under con- 
trol. In learning to typewrite, one must learn to adjust 
his emotional, as well as his motor, mechanisms to the 
situation. The elimination of conscious reactions, actual 
thoughts or images of positions—particular letters, par- 
ticular movements—goes on similarly. In the expert 
stage there are, then, relatively few irrelevant reactions. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CuRVE oF LEARNING 
From these descriptions of representative types of 
learning we may advance to a consideration of character- 
istics common to all, taking up first various features of 
thé curve of learning, which gives a graphic picture of
-P-A-G-E-267
250 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
the amount, rate, and limit of improvement brought 
about by practice. 
Most of the functions learned in school or everyday 
life are very complex, including many particular S-R con- 
nections. During the progress of learning, changes in 
the combination of connections are constantly going on. 
The performance near the limit of improvement is not 
the performance at the beginning done more rapidly; it 
is a different performance. Curves of learning, conse- 
quently, portray the progress of improvement in a chang- 
ing complex of connections. They do not picture the 
influence of exercise and effect upon single, or even upon 
a constant, group of S-R, connections. 
The actual curves of learning, which are available in 
large numbers, are of various shapes, which are deter- 
mired in part by the nature of the function itself and 
in part by the ability, methods of work, and previous 
training of the individual learner and the cireumstances 
under which he works. There is no single or typical 
curve of improvement, but many different varieties of 
which samples are given in Figures 25 to 30 inclusive. 
Study of the various curves will show that a rapid 
initial rise is a frequent but by no means universal 
characteristic. The actual increase in the output rises 
“ rapidly in the earlier stages and usually more slowly at 
the final stages of an extended experiment on the acquisi- 
tion of skill. This is not necessarily an indication that 
one is learning better in the early stages; usually it 
means only that what is learned has greater effect upon 
the score. When one begins to typewrite, for example, 
searching out each individual letter makes the number 
of words written per minute very few. But to memorize 
the positions of a dozen of the most commonly used 
letters, which is not a very difficult task, increases the
-P-A-G-E-268

output greatly. When one has reached a speed of thirty 
words per minute most of the easy tricks have been 
mastered, and to secure an equal increase in the score 
demands the learning of a great many more difficult acts.

Improvement is fairly uniform until the bundredth hour, where the 
curve flattens out. This is probably a “plateau” rather than the 
physiological limit. The highest speed attained is about 30 words a 
minute—not a high rate. (From Thorndike, Educational Psychology, 
Vol. II, p. 139, after Book.) 
Latin words one can learn in a given unit of time, we 
shall probably find that it increases as practice goes on. 
This is due, mainly, to the fact that after one has 
mastered a number of roots, prefixes, rules, ete., it is an 
easy matter to pick up a dozen new words; the “new” 
words being, as a matter of fact, not wholly new but 
frequently composed of one or more parts already more 
or less familiar. This is generally the case in acquiring
-P-A-G-E-269
252 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
information; the more history, psychology, or mathe- 
matics one already knows, the easier it is to learn a new 
lesson. 
The Physiological Limit—In the case of such skills as 
typing, writing, etc., an absolute limit of improvement is 
theoretically possible but practically almost never 
achieved. The physiological limit is that degree of

ability which a particular person cannot surpass because 
of absolute limits in the speed or complexity of motor or 
mental response. In running a hundred yards, jumping, 
tapping with a pencil, or other functions which depend 
upon sheer speed and force of muscular contraction with 
relatively little opportunity for developing new tech- 
nique, the limit may be reached. But in complex per- 
formances such as typing, drawing, playing the piano, 
carpentry, or surgery it is very seldom reached. In 
acquiring information in any field—law, medicine, his- 
tory—there is no physiological limit; there is always

more to learn and the possibility of learning it, although 
there is a limit to the speed with which the items may be 
acquired. But in most functions which have been steadily 
practised for years, such as writing, reading, shaving, 
opening envelopes, tying neckties, sorting cards, memoriz- 
ing or studying, we are performing with a speed and 
efficiency far below our maximum possibilities. Under 
special incentives such as keen competition, typesetters,

telegraph operators, and typists in industry, as well as 
readers, writers, or spellers in school, frequently rise 
abruptly from a dead level which has held them for years. 
When any habit becomes fixed, it is invariably annoy- 
ing to disturb it. The prime condition of improvement is 
that the performance at the time be broken up and 
reorganized in better form, i.e., on a higher level. Most 
of us eased off in our learning of reading, writing, and 
many other school functions as soon as we safely could— 
perhaps in the fifth or sixth grade—and entrenched our- 
selves in a low level performance, from which we have 
never emerged. Few people know how rapidly they read

or write, how efficiently they memorize or solve arith- 
metic problems; few know when their improvement came 
to an end, or whether they have made any improvement 
in the last year or ten years. If you should now suddenly 
undertake to increase your speed of reading it would be 
found disturbing and perhaps unpleasant for a time, the

inevitable result of breaking up an old organization of 
habits to supplant them by new. But this is the 
only way in which more effective habits—perfectly 
comfortable once habituated—are attained. 
Even in learning under experimental conditions, in 
which .the incentives to improve are great, especially 
when each day’s work is recorded, the progress meas- 
ured, rewards offered, and competition provided as 
incentives, the tendency to ease up is quite common. 
Sometimes this shows itself in a level or “plateau” in the

oceasioned. Figure 27 illustrates plateaus out of which 
the curve of learning emerges to reach higher levels, 
Often under ordinary conditions of life or school, where 
actual improvement is Jess emphasized, cherished and 
rewarded, the plateau becomes a permanent level.

Plateaus in the Learning Curve.—Plateaus may, how- 
ever, occur despite an interest in improvement and an 
effort to secure it. Sometimes they are due to uninten- 
tionally but unhappily hitting upon a bad habit or 
method which interferes with further progress until it 
is eliminated. In writing, a pupil may develop an 
unfavorable sitting position or too firm a grip of the 
pencil; in reading, a habit of pausing too frequently in

a line, or of giving too much attention to the minute 
details of words; habits which may inhibit progress until 
they are accidentally or by means of the teacher’s 
instructions corrected. Plateaus may be caused by eye

despite intentions to improve. Sometimes levels in the

couraging to the learner, are encountered when actual 
progress is being made. In reading, the introduction of 
visual analysis of words may temporarily disturb the 
pupil’s facility, When his performance is measured by the 
speed and accuracy of reading, he may appear to have lost 
some ability; but the cause of this apparent loss may be 
simply that the learner is passing through a period of 
transition to a higher level during which no immediate 
improvement is secured. Progress may be real but con- 
cealed, and the learner may emerge with greater ability 
to recognize new and long words. In typewriting such 
plateaus sometimes appear during the transition from
-P-A-G-E-274

letter to word units. The shift from one stage to another 
is seldom abrupt; a good deal of overlapping is the rule, 
and while the one is shading into the other, errors and 
periods of confusion are frequent. The danger is that 
these will so annoy the learner that he will drop back 
to the lower but more familiar level. 
Short Time Fluctuations in the Curve of Learning.— 
The plateau, which is a long time level or depression in 
the curve of learning, lasting for weeks or months, is 
not a universal characteristic of any function or any 
person; but short time, day-to-day ups and downs are 
practically universal. (See Figures 25-30.) These fluc- 
tuations are due to temporary habits, good or bad, differ- 
ing bodily conditions, interests, distractions, incentives, 
or other temporary influences. Individuals will have 
their good and bad days, often for minor reasons that are 
difficult to discover. 
Tue InrLuEnce or DisusE 
Disuse is, of course, a passive state in which the 
mechanisms, trained during practice, are left inactive. 
The effects of practice gradually die out at a rate which 
depends upon the native retentiveness of the particular 
neurones for the particular individual concerned. There 
is no way in which one’s neurones may be trained to 
greater retentiveness, so far as we now know. But with- 
out actual change in the retentiveness of the neural 
structure, better recall may be insured by utilizing the 
most effective methods of practice and the most effective 
methods of organization and presentation, which will be 
discussed in the next chapter. 
No satisfactory information has as yet been secured 
concerning the precise rate at which particular con-
-P-A-G-E-275
258 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
nections strengthened by exercise weaken through disuse, 
or to what limits the effects of disuse may go. The whole 
matter of the change in a particular bond occasioned by 
disuse must be treated hypothetically by deduction from 
the rather crude experiments upon complexes of con- 
nections, constituting functions such as memorizing 
words, learning telegraphy, and the like. 
In the previous chapter, we described 2 case of a child 
who learned to react to the spoken word “leaf” by think- 
ing of the object when the word and object were 
presented together repeatedly. To begin with, the con- 
nection between the word “leaf” and the conscious 
reaction or idea of leaf was very weak. In Figure 31 this 
is represented as above zero but below the “limen” of 
recall; that is, the connection is not strong enough 
actually to produce the response. One simultaneous 
reaction to the word and the object strengthens the con- 
nections somewhat, but not sufficiently to provide the 
response. Further repetitions gradually increase the 
strength of the connections until, perhaps, on the tenth 
repetition it barely exceeds the limen of reaction; that 
is, when we say “leaf” the child is barely able to recall 
the idea of the object. Each additional repetition fur- 
ther increases the strength until, perhaps, after thousands 
of repetitions, it reaches a limit—the physiological limit 
—which represents the strongest and most permanent 
connection possible. There are, then, various degrees of 
strength in a connection, from zero up to the threshold 
(or limen) of reaction and from that point on to a 
theoretical limit. One may learn a poem, for example, 
to a point where he can barely recall it, or overlearn it 
to various degrees. The more thoroughly it is over- 
learned, the more promptly, surely, and easily it can be 
recalled. If the reactions are now given no exercise, dis-
-P-A-G-E-276
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING 259 
use gradually results in a weakening of the strength of 
the connections, which would result in a lessening of the 
promptness, certainty, and ease of recall and, finally, in 
inability to recall, But even when the connection 
becomes so weak as to lie below the limen, there are still 
differences in degrees of strength, or if you please, differ-

Overlearning and Disuse-——From the experimental 
studies, which are unfortunately very few, it appears 
that the rate at which connections lose strength through 
disuse depends mainly on how strong they were at the 
beginning of the period—in other words, on how much 
they were overlearned. Reactions greatly overlearned, 
such as our names, the AB C’s, and many familiar words, 
or motor acts as holding a pencil, or humming “Home 
Sweet Home,” will probably function after thirty, forty,

or more years of disuse, although they will have lost 
more or less of the original promptness and ease of action. 
Names of old friends, the appearance of the scene of a 
summer’s vacation, a poem or song greatly overlearned, 
the act of catching a baseball, and other acts represent- 
ing connections less thoroughly established will remain 
above the threshold of reaction for many years, and thus, 
by various degrees, we may come down to responses that 
were originally exercised sufficiently to place them barely 
above the threshold of reaction. 
Curves of Forgetting —It is upon functions barely 
learned that most of the experimental studies of the 
effects of disuse are based. Ebbinghaus, a pioneer inves- 
tigator in this field, examined the permanence of his own 
learning of non-sense syllables after they had been barely 
learned—that is, learned until he had made just one cor- 
rect recitation. Practice was given up, and after a period 
of disuse he relearned the same series. The loss in the 
strength of the connections—or, as it is more accurately 
expressed in this case, “the amount of forgetting”—is 
measured by the relative amount or percentage of time 
taken to relearn the material to the point of one recall. 
The loss of ability, as thus measured, is very rapid at 
first and then tapers off gradually. Strong has obtained 
about the same results, using different materials and a 
different method of measuring forgetting. Another 
investigator, Radossawljewitsch, found that when non- 
sense syllables were learned’ more thoroughly—namely, 
until they could be recalled twice in succession—the 
effects of disuse were not so great. The first investigator 
found that after twenty-four hours of disuse, two-thirds 
of the original time was required to relearn, whereas the 
last investigator found that when material was over- 
learned slightly (two correct recitations instead of one)
-P-A-G-E-278
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING 261 
only one-third of the original learning time was required 
to relearn after twenty-four hours. 
In Figure 31, the probable curves of disuse which may 
follow various stages of overlearning are represented. 
These relations, however, are merely estimates based 
upon the few facts now available. They are intended 
to present roughly the general facts that the rate of loss 
through disuse depends upon the degree of learning and 
that loss goes on both above and below the threshold of 
response. 
Information is seldom overlearned to the extent that 
skill is. Writing, reading, speaking, typewriting, and 
swimming are complexes of large numbers of connections, 
some of which must be tremendously overlearned before 
even moderate proficiency in the function as a whole is 
possible. Many of the constituent connections, more- 
over, are really not idle during disuse, but are being 
exercised in other skills and thus kept strong. With 
complete disuse, the connections involved in motor func- 
tions do die out and, when originally overlearned to the 
same degree as the bonds involved in acquiring informa- 
tion, the rate of deterioration is probably about the same, 
although it is not impossible that the latter are somewhat 
less stable. 
Practical Problems.—The practical problem for the 
teacher is to determine to what degree pupils should 
overlearn names and dates, multiplication tables, the 
spelling of a word, rules of grammar, courtesy, skill in 
writing, and other school functions. Should a particular 
ability be so learned as to be in working order for one 
day, one week, one year, or thirty years? Having 
decided on how thoroughly to overlearn, what is the 
_ best method of doing it? Should the learning be done 
wholly in one continuous period, in several periods dur-
-P-A-G-E-279
262 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
ing the same day, or a few periods scattered over a week? 
Should the periods be ten minutes, thirty minutes, or an 
hour long? Should the lesson be learned in piecemeal or 
as a whole, at a high rate of repetition or slowly, by 
vigorous articulation or silently? These problems fall 
under a general discussion of economical learning to 
which the next chapter will be devoted. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. In what respects is the learning of animals like that of man? 
In what respects is it different? 
2. An experiment upon improvement in reading. For practice, 
attempt to speed up in all of your daily reading for 30 days. Try 
to bring about an increase in speed by pushing yourself beyond 
your ordinary rate. Give yourself a test, at about the same time 
each day, by getting some one to time you while you read for 10 
minutes as rapidly: as you can comprehend. For test material 
use a book of moderate and uniform difficulty. Record the number 
of lines read on each 10 minute test. Plot a “curve of learning.” 
3. Compare your progress with that of others. At the end of 
30 days, see if you think you have reached your limit. How can 
you be sure whether you are on a plateau or at your physiological 
limit? Test your judgment by continuing the experiment. Was 
the general curve uniform or irregular? Can you account for the 
small variations from day to day? 
4. Just what is meant by the physiological limit? In what 
functions have you reached your physiological limit? See if you 
ean increase your speed of tapping or of saying the ABC’s 
5. Name functions in which a slight improvement can be 
attained only at a great cost of time and effort. Name some where 
the experiment is worth the cost; some in which it is not. 
6. Give samples of functions in which a little improvement may 
be of enormous practical importance. , 
7. How may we determine the optimum development of school 
functions—reading, spelling, writing, typewriting, speed, and 
accuracy of multiplication? Cite opinions or experimental evi- 
dence concerning the degree of efficiency demanded by various 
vocations, :

8. Can you give any illustrations from your own experience in 
which improvement has been blocked by the formation of in- 
appropriate habits, loss of interest, staleness, or fatigue? 
9. What is meant by “overlearning’? What is overlearned 
when one can typewrite 60 words a minute? 
10. Cite a dozen functions which the high school graduate has 
overlearned. In what cases has there been too much, in what too 
little overlearning? 
11. Suggest an effective way of relearning poetry or names in 
order to give special practice to those bonds which generally need 
relearning ? 
12, What does a pupil in school know about his curve of learn- 
ing in various functions? What should he know? How might 
such curves be secured? 
18, Criticise this statement: “We learn to swim in winter, 
and learn to skate in summer.” Account for any appearance of 
improvement as a result of a period of no exercise. 
14. Why is it that certain experiences of childhood are appar- 
ently very well remembered ? 
15. In what functions does it appear that loss is very great from 
disuse? In what ones does it appear to be less great? 
16. James states that “Nothing we ever do is in strict scientific 
literalness wiped out.” Just what is meant by this? Certainly, 
experiences are “forgotten,” that is, cannot be recalled consciously. 
What has become of them and how may they function? What 
evidence can you cite to show that some trace of past experience 
may function years after it is forgotten in the sense that it cannot 
be consciously recalled? 
17. Is there a single typical curve of forgetting for all -func- 
tions? 
18. If one plays tennis only 2 months per year, but plays base- 
ball 3 months and handball 7 months, would you expect the skill 
in tennis to deteriorate during the 10 months as much as if 
baseball and handball were not played at all? Explain.

CHAPTER XII 
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 
When a rat is placed in a maze or when a child is 
allowed to learn to read by the “natural method,” a 
picture of unrestricted trial-and-error learning is secured 
in which native aptitude, previous experience, and, to a 
considerable extent, purely chance influences will deter- 
mine the kind of reactions that will be acquired, and ‘the « 
speed of acquisition. It is the function of the teacher of 
children or animals to determine what should be learned 
and how well it should be learned, and to abridge the 
process by such devices as are effective. The human 
subject should be taught not only what connections to 
form but how to form them. 
The principles of economy in learning to be considered 
in this chapter fall roughly into three groups, although 
the divisions are not sharp. They are as follows: 
1. Principles derived from the general laws of 
learning , 
2. Principles based upon facts known about the 
native capacities of the receiving, connecting 
and reacting systems 
3. Principles based upon experimental studies of 
the organization and control of practice

different methods of learning as there are pupils. Some 
of the methods may be good, but some may be very bad. 
indeed. There is no greater educational fallacy than the 
notion that the methods of learning which a pupil dis- 
covers for himself—the so-called “natural” methods— 
are the best for him. The procedure which the pupil is 
most likely to adopt is the first one stumbled upon which 
enables him to get the lesson. Children can often learn 
the ten words despite the most laborious and wasteful 
methods. How many children left to themselves, for 
example, would have adopted the “touch method” of 
typewriting which is demonstrably superior to the 
innumerable variations of “hunt and hit” that unguided 
learners develop? How many children will learn to 
write, swim, or to play the piano, by an approved method 
without being taught? Very few, certainly. The same 
thing is true of learning to read, multiply, add, or learn 
vocabularies, names, and dates; the only difference is 
that in the latter functions it is very difficult to detect 
precisely even very serious defects or deficiencies. 
In learning of the factual type, part of the trouble is 
due to the notion, often accepted in practice if not in 
thought, that a fact is a fact, and that it will function 
without regard to the way in which it was acquired. It 
is often assumed that if multiplication tables, vocabu- 
laries, or names and dates in history are thoroughly 
learned, it matters little how they are learned. This is 
to completely disregard the fact that what we learn in 
these cases is not subject matter but, as elsewhere, par- 
ticular reactions. We have added to our equipment cer- 
tain responses which can function only in certain ways, 
ways determined by the manner of learning.” 
/ _hearning_as Reacting. .—The first principle of learn- 
ing, already mentioned but in need of further elaboration

PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 267 
and illustration, then, is this: what we learn are the 
reactions that we make. An investigator once asked a 
large number of students whether the four on their 
watches was a IV or a IIII. Of 200 students whose 
watches carried a IIII, 179 declared it was IV. In spite 
of the fact that they had looked at their watch faces hun- 
dreds of times, very few had made the specific kind of 
reaction to the IIII which would enable them to recall it 
assuch. Similarly 192 reported that six o’clock was indi- 
cated by VI, when as a matter of fact there was no nu- 
meral at all at that hour. In another investigation, the 
experimenter told classes of college students that he 
wanted to test their ability to spell a list of words. When 
the six words had been written and the papers collected, 
the students were asked to write again the six words in 
the order given. Of 236 students, only five per cent 
recalled all of the words in the proper order; twenty-five 
per cent could recall the words but not the correct order, 
and five per cent could remember only half of the words 
and then were uncertain of the order. The explanation 
is that, having heard a word, to write its spelling is one 
kind of reaction, while to memorize a list of words in 
their order demands a very different kind of reaction. 
In another case, the facts are illustrated more clearly. 
A student in the course of some statistical work found it 
necessary to use the squares of numbers from 13 to 30. 
Using a table which gave these numbers and their 
squares, the reaction—think of the number, find it on 
the page, look at the square, write it down—was made 
several hundreds of times for each number in the range; 
but afterwards upon test it was found that only five 
squares (those of 13, 15, 20, 25, and 30) could be 
instantly recalled. If a different reaction—roughly, 
think of the number, then think of its square—had been
-P-A-G-E-285
268. PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
exercised specifically all the squares could have been 
memorized in a short time. In the first case, the ability 
to find numbers and their squares had doubtless 
improved greatly by use; but the reactions required for 
recall had not been specifically exercised and con- 
sequently were not acquired. Consider the learning of 
a vocabulary which is given in the book as follows: 
1. Der Mann—the man 
2. Der Knabe—the boy 
3. Der Hund—the dog 
4. Das Haus—the house 
Suppose that the child learns the vocabulary by reading 
the pairs, one after another, in the order given. What 
connections are formed? Bonds between the pairs and 
their position in the series are made, and are especially 
strong in the case of the beginning and end of the list. 
Thus, Der Mann is connected with its firstness, Der 
Knabe with secondness, etc. Bonds between the first 
pair and the second pair, the second and third, ete-— 
that is, serial connections, like those acquired in learning 
a series of non-sense syllables—are also formed. Strong 
connections between the end term of one pair and the 
beginning of the next (“man”—Der Knabe and “boy”— 
Der Hund) and between the various end terms (“man— 
boy—dog”—etc.) are also established. Learned in a list 
a great number of such connections are made, and it is 
upon these that the reaction may largely depend. Now, 
suppose you ask the boy to give the equivalent of 
“house”; or suppose Der Hund is written alone on the 
board. He may fail to make the’ correct responses in 
both cases although he could say the whole list as he 
learned it. It is something like asking an adult to give 
immediately the letter which precedes “q” or “o”; unless
-P-A-G-E-286
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 269 
he has previously practised just such reactions, he must 
get the answer in some round-about way. 
One must learn precisely the reaction that will be 
needed for practical purposes. Ordinarily, we study the 
German-English vocabulary so that later, on seeing the 
German word in isolation or in various contexts we can 
react with the thought of its English equivalent. A good 
method of learning, then, would be to take small cards 
and to write on one side the German word, on the other 
the English. Shuffle several such cards in order to avoid 
forming the serial, position, and other irrelevant bonds. 
Look at the German word and try to recall the English 
equivalent. This demands the reaction that one will 
later be called upon to make. 
Reading vs. Recitation—In oné investigation two 
general methods of reacting were tested in the course 
of memorizing materials. One method consisted of read- 
ing and rereading a list of 16 non-sense syllables (or a 
group of five short biographies totalling about 170 
words) without looking up from the paper. Another 
method consisted in beginning, early or late, to recite— 
that is, to attempt to recall when not looking at the 
material—prompting one’s self speedily by glancing at 
the paper when unable to proceed. The latter kind of 
reaction is just the kind that will be demanded later. 
The question is, does exercising as soon as possible the 
reaction that will eventually be demanded result in more 
economical learning and retention than the method of 
reading and rereading? 
The “recitation” method turned out to be quite 
superior, as shown by the accompanying table. 
A study of the table will disclose several facts: (1) 
The greater the amount, of time devoted to recitation, 
the greater the percentage of the lesson recalled. Of

course, some time must be spent at the start in reading 
the material. After a few readings the process becomes 
partly recitation; that is, one skims over the items that 
are familiar, seeing a bit here and there and filling in 
the gaps by recall. This is true of the ordinary reading 
of most adults. This explains (2) the fact that one does 
better, relatively, in learning sense material by reading 
and rereading than in learning non-sense words, which, 
to begin with, contain fewer meaningful associations 
which make recall during ordinary reading possible. 
(3) The recitation method results in the learning of a 
different group of bonds, the kind that makes for more 
permanent retention, as indicated by the fact that the 
greatest superiority is shown in the columns of the table 
which give the percentages remembered after four hours. 
_ As pointed out previously, one may learn a thing in
-P-A-G-E-288
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 271 
several different ways. The best way is to learn it in 
exactly the form that will be used later. This is pre- 
cisely what the student does when he learns by recitation. 
He forms and practices the reactions just as they must 
be exercised in recall at a later period. Another advan- 
tage of the recitation method is the fact that during 
learning one discovers just what parts are especially 
difficult or easy, and distributes his energy accordingly. 
He finds what kinds of associative aids work and what 
kinds do not. Finally, the learner is aware of hig progress 
during active attempts at recitation. In the rereading 
method, some were uncertain as to whether they were 
mastering the lesson or not; the learning becoming very 
irksome on that account. During recitation the learner 
is stimulated and encouraged by the awareness of making 
progress; and clear evidence of success is a great motive 
in learning. 
The first guiding principle, then, is to consider the 
. situation which life will present and so arrange the 
circumstances of learning that the pupil will be practised 
in making those reactions which life will demand. Do 
not expect the proper response to appear as the result 
of incidental training. 
It is not enough that the instructor realize what 
reactions are to be acquired; the learner must also know 
just what he is supposed to learn. Two general prob- 
lems, then, merit consideration: (1) how may we best 
make clear the reactions that are to be acquired, and (2) 
how may we best determine the reactions which the 
learner is making? 
The Choice and Use of Models.—In attempting to 
portray what is to be learned, teachers usually employ 
some kind of a model. For example, in teaching hand- 
writing there are a number of possible models, among
-P-A-G-E-289
272 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
which are the following: (1) a perfect copybook sample; 
(2) a splendid sample of actual writing; (3) actual 
handwriting, but less perfect; (4) actual writing but 
within the range of the child’s possible achievement in 
a month (or more); (5) the sight of the actual writing 
movements by the teacher; or (6) moving pictures of 
the hand in motion. Which of these are useful? A 
great many elaborate investigations must be performed 
before the facts will be known with certainty. We must 
take our guidance from general principles until the 
crucial experiments are performed. The one general 
principle of which we feel rather sure is this: other 
things being equal, that model which makes the desired 
reactions most clear is best. It does not matter in the 
least whether the model is a living movement, a picture 
of a movement, a lifeless copy, or what. The one 
-eriterion is the faithfulness and clearness with which it 
displays the ends sought. 
A perfect copybook model, because of its perfection, 
portrays the results of reactions that the learner will not 
soon—in fact, never—achieve. To see the teacher in the 
process of writing is of surprisingly little value. Inas- 
much as he does not know what to look for, the learner 
frequently does not see anything that is helpful. Sleight- 
of-hand performances would never have been cultivated 
if this were not true. Of course, the teacher can demon- 
strate a few things about the finger positions in gripping 
the pencil, but the finer details cannot be perceived dur- 
ing the course of the actual movements. A well written 
sample is probably the best guide, when the pupil is 
assisted by certain explanations and demonstrations and 
a great deal of supervision. 
Putting the Learner through the Reaction.— Another 
form of teaching which now and then attains popularity
-P-A-G-E-290
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 273 
is to put the individual mechanically through the 
reaction. Letters may be carved in a board through 
which the pupil pushes his pencil, or the teacher may 
grasp the child’s hand and force the movements. There 
are two ways in which putting the learner through the 
reaction might be of utility: (1) by providing a clear 
idea of what is to be done and (2) by giving the mecha- 
nisms artificial exercise in the way they should function. 
At first thought, this should provide a simple way of 
eliminating the errors from what would otherwise be trial 
~ and error learning. No conclusive experimental tests of 
this device have been made on human subjects, but a 
number of them performed on animals show that they 
fail to profit by being put through a reaction which is for 
them about as new as writing is for a child. Even with 
his superior equipmert for observation, the child does 
not realize very clearly what is happening when he is 
put through a complex act; usually he profits more by 
seeing someone else do the act. Furthermore, it is usually 
impossible to put him through more than the gross move- 
ments, and these at a much slower pace. The feeling of 
the movements—that is, the muscular and related sen- 
sations—are altogether too vague and confused to be 
valuable. Finally, the exercise is, after all, not the exer- 
cise of actually doing the act. You learn precisely what 
you practise; and in being put through, you learn not 
to write, but to be put ‘through movements that are 
vaguely like writing movements. By tracing in a groove, 
one learns to trace in a groove; but actual writing is a 
different matter which must be acquired largely by itself. _ 
The novice who practises swimming while supported with 
an inflated tube, after all usually fails to learn to swim by 
this means alone while learning a number of things— 
such as balancing on the support—which are irrelevant.
-P-A-G-E-291
274 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
Avoiding Irrelevant Connections—Many handwrit- 
ing systems afford good examples of superfluous learning. 
Those which begin with a series of exercises like the 
following are likely to be wasteful. 
What is learned by making these pretty designs i is to 
make such pretty designs; writing is another matter. 
Time spent on these exercises, of course, is not wholly 
wasted. Certain kinds of facility will transfer to actual 
  Ficure 32. Samples of formal exercises sometimes used in teaching andwriting. 
writing, but it will be only a partial transfer. What we 
want is practice that counts a full hundred per cent. One 
should, in fact, begin at once to write, although the 
character of the writing and the details of procedure 
should be the subject of careful instruction and guid- 
ance. Such exercises as were given above sometimes find 
their ‘place in assisting in overcoming certain difficulties 
_ or in remedying defects, but they should not be used 
indiscriminately. 
The theoretical basis of such exercises as the foregoing 
is the mistaken notion that if we learn to do singly all 
of the elemental acts involved in a complex function,
-P-A-G-E-292
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 275 
putting the single acts together will be relatively easy. 
The fact is, that the greatest difficulties are often encoun- 
tered in putting the elements together, and that in a 
straightaway attack the elemental reactions are often 
sufficiently established without the preliminary work. 
Those that are not sufficiently developed may well be 
handled singly; but not until this becomes necessary. 
The foregoing statements are true of very closely 
integrated functions, such as writing, reading, and 
drawing. In a large measure the analytical methods of 
teaching reading-have been discarded. We do not now 
teach first the letters, then the phonetic elements, then 
the syllables and finally the words. We begin with 
words, and later introduce such phonetic or other analyti- 
cal work as may be needed. In arithmetic, however, 
conditions are usually quite different, because we are 
dealing with a host of relatively specific abilities. The 
same rule applies there, however, in the sense that no 
irrelevant or uscless bonds are to be formed. 
The undue use of “crutches” in arithmetic is a case 
in point. Many teachers use temporary devices or 
“crutches” to assist pupils more rapidly over a difficulty, 
and by so doing provide more difficulties than they have 
escaped. Adding and subtracting by counting on the 
fingers, writing the number to be carried, writing the 
sign -+ or — or X to guide the computation of such 
problems as 
568 568 568 
+ 321 — 321 X 321 
      
are common examples. The objection to such usages is 
not that they are childish, but that they represent the 
formation of habits that will sooner or later have to be 
broken. Moreover, their use is often positively detri-
-P-A-G-E-293
276 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
mental in crucial cases. When speed is needed, counting 
on the fingers is too slow. If the + or — sign is omitted 
the pupil may be unable to proceed. Suppose the habit 
of writing the number to be carried is not broken before 
long division or multiplication is reached. We then will 
have computations appearing as shown below in which 
the eye is distracted by irrelevant figures which make 
frequent errors probable.

Concerning all forms of crutches and special devices, 
the general recommendations are to consider carefully: 
(1) what new elements are introduced; (2) in what 
manner they will assist; (3) whether their utility is 
temporary or permanent; (4) how difficult it will be to 
break the habits formed; and (5) what other, if any, 
unfavorable adjustments may be introduced incidentally. 
The main principle of guidance should be: form no 
habits that will later have to be broken unless there is 
very good reason for so doing. 
The Discovery of Errors.—The abridgment of trial- 
and-error learning is greatly facilitated by preventing 
and correcting errors. Errors sometimes may be pre- 
vented, as in the case of learning grammatical forms by 
presenting only the correct model. A list of equal num- 
bers of correct and incorrect grammatical forms is then
-P-A-G-E-294
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 277 
undesirable since it results in the exercise of incorrect 
forms that might otherwise have never been encoun- 
tered at all. The general principle is to give the errone- 
ous reaction the least possible exercise. The usual 
situation is, however, that some of the pupils have 
acquired wrong expressions from various sources, and 
these must be eliminated as promptly as possible. On 
an earlier page was explained the fact that undesirable 
reactions are eliminated by (1) detecting them; (2) 
attaching annoyers to them; (8) providing a desirable 
substitute; and (4) exercising and attaching satisfiers 
to the substitute. 
In the subtle elements of writing, speech, arithmetic. 
and other functions, the teacher should be constantly on 
the alert for errors that are likely to appear. She should 
detect them when possible before they become fixed, 
point them out to the learners, and attempt to introduce 
the correct reaction. When errors recur, they should be 
challenged and the proper response again suggested. 
When the error is once eliminated, it should not be men- 
tioned again. Emphasis should then, in general, be 
placed on the correct reaction; but the incorrect 
response when made should not be ignored. 
The learner himself should be alert to detect errors and 
to discover their cause. In arithmetic, for example, 
habits of verifying results should be established early. 
“These habits of testing an obtained result are of three- 
fold value. They enable the pupil to find his own errors, 
and to maintain a standard of accuracy for himself. 
They give him a sense of the relations of the processes 
and the reasons why the right ways of adding, subtract- 
ing, multiplying and dividing are right, such as only the 
very bright pupils can get from verbal explanations. 
They put his acquisitions of a certain power, say multi-
-P-A-G-E-295
278 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
plication, to a real and intelligible use, in checking the 
results of his practice of a new power, and so instill a 
respect for arithmetical power and skill in general.” + 
In writing, errors in position, in the grasp of the 
pencil, and in finger or forearm control are likely to creep 
in at any time, since these functions are in the process of 
development for several years. In such complex func- 
tions, the detection and elimination of errors is a vital 
feature of economical progress. In learning to read well 
orally, to recite, debate, etc., the recording of one’s per- 
formance by a phonograph by which it may be repro- 
‘duced and studied is a tremendous aid. Similarly 
photographic studies have proved most profitable in the 
analysis of movements in industrial operations for pur- 
poses of guiding the process of learning. It is quite 
possible that moving pictures of one’s motor acts in 
drawing, shopwork, athletics, etc., would afford equally 
profitable study. 
The Directing of Attention.—In connection with these 
suggestions concerning the value of directing attention 
to and discovering errors, an erroneous theory of the 
value of concentration on the sensations which arise from 
the activities of the muscles, tendons, and: joints merits 
a word. This theory assumes that if one is attending 
to the sensations from the organs of response when a 
good reaction happens to be made, he may later rein- 
state the response by calling to mind the complex of 
sensations. As one writer puts it: “A movement idea 
is the revival, through central excitation, of the sensa- 
tions, visual, tactile, kinesthetic originally produced by 
the performance of the movement itself. And when 
such an idea is attended to, when, in popular language, 
we think hard enough of how the movement would “feel” 
*THornvike, The Psychology of Arithmetic. 1922. Page 81 f.
-P-A-G-E-296
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 279 
and look if it were performed, then, so close is: the con- 
nection between sensory and motor processes, the 
movement is instituted afresh.” 
Ask a golfer what ideas he tries to activate before 
making a stroke. No one will say that he tries to recall 
the hundreds of sensations from the body that he pre- 
viously felt during the process of making a good stroke. 
He could not possibly do so if he tried. His ideas may 
be thoughts of cautions such as: “Now, don’t get 
excited,” or “Take your time,” or “Keep your eye on 
the ball.” As for the expert, the less he thinks about 
how he feels or how it felt to make a good stroke, the 
better. He simply makes the preparatory reactions, 
places feet, bends knee, and places the club proper to 
the general situation and goes through with the stroke 
with no thoughts of the movements whatsoever. 
The whole notion that one profits by attending to the 
sensations from the members employed in a complex 
act is erroneous. What one should do is to direct one’s 
attention to (1) features which enable one to secure the 
correct preliminary orientation; (2) features which 
enable one to detect errors or successes in the act; and 
to (3) the general outcome of the act. If one is trying 
to throw a baseball over the plate, he must first observe 
and thereby locate the plate. When the movement is 
under way it is wise to look at the plate, although at 
times—in practice—it pays to give attention to some 
part of the process which is troublesome. Thus, the 
pitcher may be stepping out too far; an error which he 
must detect and remedy. He should know both when 
his moves are incorrectly and when they are properly 
performed. As soon as he gets the act going right it is 
better to think about it no longer. The other feature 
which deserves attention is the outcome of the total act:
-P-A-G-E-297
280 PSYCHOLOGY FOR srupiwrs OF EDUCATION 
the pitcher should try to observe accurately just where 
the ball went, and try to account both for successes and 
errors. 
The same principles hold for other forms of motor 
activities. In writing, one must first get the correct 
position and, second, keep on the lookout for good and 
bad movements by watching the product, trying at the 
same time to detect the causes of errors and successes. 
As one masters the act, the conscious reactions gradually 
drop out because they are unnecessary. Nowhere does 
the attempt to get an idea of how a movement feels 
contribute anything useful to the production of the 
movement. 
PrincipLes Basep upon Facts KNowN ABOUT THE 
Native CAPACITIES OF THE RECEIVING, CONNECTING 
AND Reacting MrcHaNnIsMs 
It has been urged at times that we may learn more 
readily through some sense organ than others, that we 
may learn more readily by one type of imagery than by 
others, that we learn more readily through certain forms 
of motor expression, and that we learn better at certain 
speeds. Each of these problems deserves some attention. 
The Avenue of Presentation.—Are children or adults 
by original nature so constituted that they acquire most 
readily reactions aroused by means of visual, or auditory, 
or tactual, or some other sensory stimulation? So far 
as we know, the primary and higher neural connections 
_of the brain aroused through one sense organ-are just as 
modifiable and retentive as are the centers stimulated by 
others. Other things being equal, we learn quite as 
readily through one sense as another, with the exception, 
of course, of individuals whose receiving, connecting, or 
(
-P-A-G-E-298
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 281 
central mechanisms are defective. Other conditions, 
consequently, determine which avenue of presentation 
is to be preferred. Very young children learn new 
words better, for example, when presented to the ear 
than when presented to the eye, for the reason that their 
" early word experience is auditory and not visual. If they 
have attended school, by the average age of eight or 
thereabouts children learn better by means of reading. 
The reasons, however, are not physiological but mechani- 
eal: the child can regulate the speed of reacting to the 
words to suit his capacity; he can attempt recall when 
and where he pleases; he can stop and repeat the 
especially difficult items, and disregard those already 
mastered. 
The relative values of moving pictures, graphs, dia- 
grams, mechanical instruments, verbal explanations, and 
clay models are similarly determined by past experience 
and mechanical advantages. The main questions are: 
which method makes most clear the thing to be learned 
and which does it most interestingly and most economi- 
cally of time, space, and money. Original nature is not 
so organized that we learn pictures better than, words, or 
graphs better than models. 
Types of Mental Imagery.—The question of the rela- 
tive value of various avenues of presentation is usually 
linked with the problem of mental types. Some of the 
older books on psychology urged the teacher to discover 
the type of imagery used by each pupil and present 
material to harmonize with it. This advice was based 
on the assumption that children fall into definite image 
types, as the “eye-minded” type, the “ear-minded” type, 
the “motor-minded” type, etc.;° and on the further 
assumption that when the imagery is predominantly 
visual, material should be presented through the eye, and
-P-A-G-E-299
282 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
when predominantly auditory, through the ear, and so 
on. 
Both assumptions are wrong. Nearly all children can 
and do employ all of the common types of imagery, 
which may vary from time to time, and from one kind 
of task to another. Furthermore, when one type is 
favored—for example auditory or motor imagery— 
impressions received through the eye may be at once 
converted into it. It is not at all necessary to employ 
vivid visual imagery in recalling or imagining scenes and 
events as in painting or in drawing, or to utilize none 
but auditory imagery in thinking of, playing or com- 
posing music. Of one hundred eminent musicians 
(including performers, teachers and composers) who 
answered the question “In what ways do you memorize?” 
sixty per cent reported that they used more than one type 
of imagery. Sometimes they used one at a time, some- 
times several with visual, auditory, and motor reported 
about equally often; and more than one-third of the 
group were not aware of using any type of concrete 
imagery. They study the piece, as one says, “until it 
gets into the fingers; then it is recalled without 
consciously seeing or thinking notes.” 
Vivid imagery, as many studies have abundantly 
shown, is not essential to effective learning of school 
subjects. The reactions demanded in spelling, reading, 
drawing, or history may be acquired without any one 
variety of imagery. Pupils whose concrete imagery is 
very vivid are in general as likely to be dull as bright, 
and successful as unsuccessful, in particular subjects. 
Experienced mathematicians, scientists, and other men- 
tal workers have, as a rule, much weaker imagery than 
children. This apparently is due to a gradual discard, by 
trial and error, of vivid imagery and by the substitution
-P-A-G-E-300
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 283 
of verbal or other symbolic forms, or, possibly, the direct 
awareness of meanings with no imagery at, all. 
The image type of the pupils is a matter that teachers 
may well disregard, not only because it is very seldom 
of importance, but also because there are at present no 
reliable methods by which the imagery of children can 
be diagnosed. 
What Form of Reaction is Most Readily Acquired? 
—Are children or adults so organized by original nature 
that reactions made by some mechanisms are more 
readily acquired and permanently retained than reactions 
made by others? One may practice the spelling of a 
word by articulating, writing, typewriting, tracing in the 
air with a full-arm movement, moving the eyes or any 
other member; or by reacting by visual, auditory, or 
other types of imagery. Which is the best way? So far 
as evidence now available goes, the neural connections 
concerned in one reaction appear to be as readily modifi- 
able as those concerned’ in others; so the choice of the 
form of reaction should be determined by the now 
familiar principle: Learn the act in the way it is to 
function in actual life. For most of us, learning to spell 
by means of actual writing would, therefore, be pre- 
ferred, although oral spelling might be learned quite as 
easily. 
Speed versus Accuracy.—Speed and accuracy of re- 
acting or of learning generally go together in the sense 
that those who develop one readily usually develop the 
other readily. But if we consider a particular individual, 
emphasis on one may or may not result in improvement 
of the other. The results vary with individuals and with 
functions, 
Tn one series of experiments, it was found that in esti- 
mating lifted weights, in comparing the lengths of lines
-P-A-G-E-301
284 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
or specimens of handwriting, increasing the speed at 
which judgments were made within limits produced but 
little or no decrease in accuracy. In comparing speci- 
mens of writing, trebling the speed actually produced a 
slight (6.3%) increase in accuracy. In thrusting a 
pencil at a point on a target at arm’s length and in trae- 
ing an irregular line with a pencil, decreases in accuracy 
—slight for small increases in speed but considerable for 
great increases—were found. 
In arithmetic and in writing, accuracy or quality is 
likely to suffer if speed is over-emphasized. When proper 
precautions are taken, however, the rate of performance 
can often be appreciably increased without sacrifice of 
quality or precision. 
In certain school functions, notably in reading, great 
increase in speed may often be obtained with no loss— 
indeed, often with a gain—in accuracy. In the accom- 
panying table are given the results of a special “drive” 
extending over 39 school days for the purpose of 
increasing the speed of silent reading.

PrINcIPLES BASED UPON EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF THE 
ORGANIZATION AND ConTROL OF PRACTICE 
In this section such questions as the optimum length 
of a study period, the optimum interval between periods, 
the distribution of reviews, and related problems will be 
considered. With as many different subjects as there 
are, and with as many variations of the length of assign- 
ments, study periods, and intervals as are possible, it is 
apparent that an enormous number of investigations 
must be conducted before all of the facts are known. 
While the number of studies is large, crucial evidence is 
lacking in many instances; and in some subjects no in- 
vestigations have been made. Guidance, however, had 
better rest upon the implication of such experimental re- 
sults as are available than upon mere opinion. The 
statements in the following sections, however, are offered 
subject to revision in the light of results of future 
research rather than as final principles. 
The Length of Practice Periods.—How long should 
one continuously study geography, spelling, or arithmetic 
or continuously practice writing, typewriting, or sewing? 
The results of a large number of investigations are not 
altogether in harmony, but they favor periods of thirty 
minutes or less as compared to longer periods. 
In one investigation of learning in “substitution”—a 
rather difficult function in which the letters of words are 
translated into other symbols by the use of a code—a 
group of subjects practiced for sixteen days, using periods 
of the same length, and then were divided into four 
groups, one practicing 15 minutes a day, another 30, an- 
other 45, and another 60. The improvement in speed in 
the second practice period was then compared with the 
increase in the first period when all were practicing in
-P-A-G-E-303
286 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
periods of equal length. This is shown in the accom- 
panying table.

The thirty-minute practice period yields greater re- 
turns per unit of time than longer or shorter periods. 
The sixty-minute period is especially unproductive. 
Other investigations of memorizing, archery, typewrit- 
ing, and arithmetic have shown, in the main, that periods 
longer than thirty minutes are relatively unproductive, 
as are very short periods of ten minutes or less. The 
facts vary somewhat with the functions and with the 
age of the individuals, but, roughly, periods from twelve 
to thirty. minutes are most desirable. 
The Distribution of Practice—If a learner has at his 
disposal seven hours a week for practice in typewriting, 
playing the piano, singing, etc., how may the time be 
most fruitfully distributed? Should he work continu- 
ously on one day for seven hours, or in half-hour periods 
—which, as we just found, are optimum—with intervals 
of a half hour, an hour, six hours or twenty-four? Ex- 
periments have not yielded entirely conclusive results, 
and but few functions have been tested at all; but there 
has been a rather consistent indication that by breaking 
up the available time into perieds of thirty minutes, or 
somewhat less, with intervals varying from thirty min- 
utes to twenty-four hours between, the best returns are 
secured. Thus it would probably be preferable to make 
use of the seven weekly hours by practicing twice a day
-P-A-G-E-304
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 287 
for thirty-minute periods; or, if but three and a half 
hours were available, half-hour daily periods would be 
advisable. That is, one should make the practice periods 
no longer than thirty minutes and distribute them at 
fairly uniform intervals, of not more than twenty-four 
hours. If only two hours per week are available, one 
should divide the time into daily lessons of seventeen 
minutes each. When this scheme of distribution reduces 
the length of the lesson to twelve minutes or less, it would 
probably be better to increase the intervals to forty-eight 
hours rather than make the practice period too brief. 
The problem is slightly different when the task is to 
learn a speech, a short vocabulary, a particular musical 
selection, or a multiplication table. Should one learn 
such short lessons at one sitting, or at several sittings 
with intervals between? But little experimental work 
has been directed specifically to this problem. In one of 
the best studies, a series of items to be memorized was 
read from start to finish at a constant rate, and then re- 
peated at fixed intervals until mastered. Typical results 
are shown in the accompanying table. 
The time required when repetitions are made at inter- 
vals of twenty minutes or more is very small compared to 
the time required for nearly continuous study, at least in 
the case of memorizing to the point of bare recall. 
The Distribution of Reviews.—When material has 
been learned sufficiently to be recalled, how should fur- 
ther practice be distributed when it is desired to have the 
facts permanently learned, as is often the case with cer- 
tain facts in history, poetic gems, rules of grammar, com- 
binations in arithmetic, and the spelling of words? 
Should the. overlearning be carried out at once or should 
it. be distributed over periods of weeks or months? 
The evidence bearing on this problem is insufficient to

justify a confident statement, but it indicates that one 
should overlearn somewhat at the beginning and leave 
the remainder of the overlearning to reviews at constantly 
increasing intervals. The first review, which should be 
relatively long, may be held after an interval of forty- 
eight hours; the next'review, somewhat shorter, a week 
later; the next, shorter still, three weeks later; the next, 
two months later, followed by other reviews at intervals 
of six months or more. 
In this connection, the distribution of practice and re- 
views provided by school texts of arithmetic, history, 
spelling, and other subjects provide interesting ‘study. 
Figures 33, 34, and 35 show the distribution of practice on 
certain processes in arithmetic in the first two books of 
a three-book series of arithmetics. The diagrams which 
represent nearly four years of school work, from about 
the beginning of Grade 3 to the end of Grade 6, show 
no very consistent nor very good plans of distributing 
practice. Figure 36 shows a closer approximation to an 
ideal arrangement for reviews.

effective method of learning than concentrated repetition 
gives the whole method some advantage, since learning 
a short stanza of poetry, for example, results in very 
brief intervals between the repetition of a given line, 
whereas reading through many stanzas results in longer

stanzas are recalled on the basis of being in first position. 
The part method introduces certain misleading bonds. 
For example, when the first stanza is finished, the learner 
goes back to the beginning of the same verse with the 
result that the end, instead of being connected with the 
beginning of the next stanza is connected with the be- 
ginning of the first. Hence children often get “stuck” at 
the beginning of.a:stanza which they can recite readily

once they can secure a start. The main advantage of the 
whole method, then, lies in the fact that the connections 
are formed in the way they will later need to function. 
This, with the advantages secured by the length of the 
lesson and the better distribution of repetitions, makes 
the whole method, in general, a more economical method 
of study. 
Many investigations, in terms of the amount of time 
required to learn, have borne out the advantage of the 
whole method. A sample result is shown in the accom- 
panying table.

On the whole, the advantage of learning by going 
through the material from beginning to end each time is 
greater for the long than for the short lessons. 
The whole method shows its superiority in recall some 
time after the original learning more conspicuously than 
in the saving of time in the process of fixation. The fol- 
lowing table is illustrative:

The whole method shows to advantage in memorizing 
poetry, prose, vocabularies, lists of words, and non-sense 
syllables—and probably in most materials which are to 
be memorized in serial order. In learning by reading 
(history, ete.), the relative merits of whole and piecemeal 
methods have not as yet been demonstrated, but it is 
probable that reading a lesson through as a whole is 
distinctly advantageous, 
Either in memorizing or reading, the whole procedure
-P-A-G-E-310
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN LEARNING 293 
should not be adhered to slavishly. Difficult and impor- 
tant sections should be given more attention; easy or un- 
important matter “skimmed.” 
Complicated dance steps, musical selections to be 
played or sung, and many industrial operations fall with- 
in the serial type of learning which may be learned as a 
whole or in parts. In an inventory of methods actually 
used by one hundred prominent musicians, fourteen re- 
ported that they employed the whole method exclusively, 
another fourteen combined the whole and the piecemeal 
procedure, while the remaining seventy-two learned 
mainly bit by bit. These data throw little light on the 
merits of the methods inasmuch as highly competent per- 
formers in every field often employ uneconomical 
methods. Crucial investigations in the case of such 
functions are lacking. Theoretically, the whole method 
would seem to possess the same merits here as in the 
case of memorizing poetry or prose. 
Peckstein, however, found that in learning certain 
motor acts, such as tracing the course of a complex pencil 
maze while blindfolded, the whole method was uneco- 
nomical. When the task was extremely difficult, subjects 
were sometimes unable to learn at all by the whole 
method. These findings illustrate the risk involved. in 
widespread applications of facts found in one field to 
situations encountered in others. We must await the re- 
sults of further investigations to determine the relative 
merits of the whole and the part methods in the field of 
motor learning. 
Confusion Resulting from a Change of Method.—In 
the previous chapter, the unwillingness to change well

discomfort frequently occasioned by variations from 
usual procedures were mentioned. To attempt to read or

memorizé more rapidly, to learn by distributed rather 
than by concentrated practice, or by the whole instead 
of the piecemeal method, or to adopt some other new 
device may lead to temporary difficulties. Chagrined by 
the failure of improvement to appear at once, students 
frequently abandon the new method as futile. Tempor- 
ary confusion and often loss of efficiency should be ex- 
pected. The novel procedure must be habituated before 
full returns may be enjoyed.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 
In the two preceding chapters, in which the character- 
istics and economical methods of learning in the case of 
writing, spelling, reading, arithmetic, and other complex 
functions were considered, it was apparent that what may 
superficially appear to involve little more than “drill” or 
memorizing, may and often does enlist the higher mental 
processes of analysis and reasoning as well. Modern 
educational practice especially seeks to utilize, encourage, 
and develop both interest and ability in independent 
thinking, problem solving, reasoning, and imagination. 
It seeks; moreover, to do more than merely develop abil- 
ity to think and reason in arithmetic or grammar; it seeks 
to train capacities more widely applicable, to develop 
abilities to reason in the situations of life whenever en- 
countered and whatever the type. In considering these 
forms of training, three general problems are en- 
countered. The first problem deals with the data, the con- 
tent, the stuff of which thought is composed, and the ways 
in which the substance of thought is acquired. We must 
answer the question: How are ideas and concepts usually 
acquired, and how may they be most economically and 
effectively developed? The second problem is concerned 
with the mechanics or technique of thinking, reasoning, 
and problem solving. Here we shall try to answer the 
questions: How do we think and how may we improve 
our thinking in a particular field? The third problem 
296
-P-A-G-E-314
i 
{ THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 297° 
concerns the general effects of specific training. Here 
will be encountered such questions as: If children are 
taught effectively to study, to reason, to exercise initia- 
tive and originality in grammar or arithmetic, to what 
extent will this training carry over or transfer to other 
fields, such as those of law, medicine, or business affairs? 
By what methods may the greatest transfer of training 
be achieved? 
In thinking, reasoning, and imagination we are dealing 
with recalled facts. How we deal with them will be 
considered in the following chapter. For the present, we 
will be concerned with the various types of recalled facts 
and with the way in which they are acquired. 
Tue ReLation or Percupts ano /Ipzas 
Facts, in the first place, result from sensory percep- 
tion. They are the outcome of visual, auditory, tactual, 
and other sensory experiences with things and events. 
Typically the percept, which as we have previously ob- 
served is a complex conscious reaction, is built up by 
reacting consciously to many stimuli acting at once. For 
example, a child on its second birthday is presented for 
the first time with a puppy. At first the little dog is 
perceived in a variety of ways. It is a small dark thing 
which runs about—sometimes dangerously near—with 
four legs; a thing which barks, whines, scratches the door, 
and sounds “pat, pat, pat, pat” when it runs; a thing 
which likes to eat and frolic. Gradually these various 
conscious reactions become connected with many differ- 
ent stimuli, so that to any one stimulus a joint response, 
the percept, may occur. Thus, when the child sees only 
a head or a tail, hears a bark, a whimper, or “pat, pat, 
pat” on the floor, or feels a moist nose or a shaggy back

against his hand, he promptly becomes aware of the_ 
puppy. 
If we observe the child’s behavior in the absence of the. 
pet, we shall discover good evidence that he is thinking 
about or has an idea of the puppy. A visitor is given a 
detailed description of the visual appearance, the weight, 
bark, and other characteristics of the dog. The child re- 
ports occasionally that he dreamed about his dog or that 
he imagined his pet doing new stunts, such as standing 
on its head or climbing a tree. In these cases, the child 
obviously has an idea of the animal.. He is aware of the 
dog’s characteristics when the dog is really absent. 
The awareness of any thing, event, or fact when it is 
not present to the senses we shall call an idea. We can 
think of a great variety of objects, such as dogs, cats, 
houses, books, men, and other facts which we call objects. 
We can think of musical selections, spoken words, pain, 
accidents, a sore throat, a struggle with an umbrella, an 
act of courtesy—any fact, experience or event may be re- 
called given the proper stimulus, which i is always, either 
another percept or another idea. 
TRIAL AND ErRoR IN THE ACQUISITION 6F PERCEPTS 
AND IpEAs 
The child’s idea of the puppy is a complex conscious 
reaction which is constantly undergoing change by addi- 
tions and subtractions of the elements which constitute 
the whole. In this development of the percept the trial 
and error form of learning is apparent. The child at first 
perceives the animal and proceeds to deal with it much 
as he would with other objects with which he is familiar. 
He observes legs somewhat like those of his toy chair, and 
seizing a leg by which to carry the puppy about, the
-P-A-G-E-316
THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 299 
child’s idea is modified by the painful consequences. If 
the child squeezes the puppy too affectionately, as he 
might .a stuffed animal, the yelp or possibly a snap re- 
sults in the elimination of part of the old way of perceiv- 
ing the pup, and the addition of new factors. The dog, 
in the course of time, is perceived and thought of as an 
object with sharp teeth, a certain weight, great strength 
and agility, a thing that mustn’t be stepped on or im- 
mersed in water, which barks at birds, snaps when dis- 
turbed in feeding, and never talks, but is generally a 
playful companion. The child’s idea of a dog is a chang- 
ing, growing complex of particulars. 
ANALYSIS AND CoMBINATION IN PERCEPTION 
In the development of percepts and ideas, two processes 
are going on simultaneously. The complex object is, on 
the one hand, analysed; the minute and subtle features 
are perceived. Little details of the dog’s appearance and “- 
behavior are noticed. The shape of the pup’s ears, the 
number of toes, the significance of slightly different 
whines and barks, the characteristics of its fears and 
angers are observed more and more specifically. Percep- 
tion, and gonsequently thought, becomes progressively 
more detailed and refined. At the same time, a Process: 
of synthesis or building up is apparent. Perception ands, 
thought become not only more refined, but also more~ 
broad and inclusive. The minute facts become combined 
into percepts and ideas more rich and comprehensive, 
Analysis and synthesis go on simultaneously and cor 
tinuously so long as the child continues to disentangle 
new features of dog-ness, so long as he continues to ob- 
serve new details. If, as a young adult, he undertakes 
the study of anatomy, physiology, or biology, his percepts 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
300 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
and ideas of a dog will become greatly enriched. From 
the childhood idea of just-something-surrounded-by-skin, 
the dog’s body will be'thought of as an amazing complex- 
ity of intricate organs and functions. 
Various Typrs or Perceptual LEARNING 
Perception of the Printed Page.—The vitally impor- 
tant characteristic of human conscious reaction is its 
analytical character, the capacity to become aware of 
very subtle and obscure features of things and events. 
This page of print, to the infant, is merely a vague con- 
fusion of black and white. Some day, after a good deal 
of experience, it will be found to contain words, although 
the words at first will be perceived and consequently 
thought about as vague wholes. Later, the words will 
take more definite form, become associated with objects, 
and be reduced to word units, letters, or phonograms like 
ing, ank, ock. As analysis proceeds, the immediate per- 
ceptions and ideas of words are changed; the word be- 
comes a different total from what it was at the beginning. 
Perception of Spoken Words.—In the perception of 
spoken words, we find the same processes of analysis. 
The child at first hears an unintelligible jargon of sounds 
whose significance is less than that of a foreign tongue to 
an adult, although even the adult is usually unable to 
detect words, or even sentences as such, in an unusual 
language. The child probably first realizes that the 
sounds are either directed to him or elsewhere, that their 
general tenor is friendly or otherwise. Gradually the 
frequently repeated sentences or phrases become associ- 
ated with acts or objects such as play or food; later, 
words become appreciated as such; and eventually, fine 
distinctions, grammatical forms, and usages, the meaning
-P-A-G-E-318
THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 301 
of certain intonations and inflections are understood. The 
perceptions of effective oral speech may, indeed, become 
a fine art, to which a life-time may be devoted, as in the 
case of the teacher of oral expression, the dramatic critic 
or impresario. 
Perception of Facial and Bodily Expressions.—The 
perception of the significance of the facial and bodily 
“expressions” is an important feature of all human learn- 
ing which illustrates again the analytic character of the 
process. Father appears from his day’s labor at the 
office with an expression which mother at once perceives 
and takes into account, modifying her words and deeds 
accordingly. The child fails to notice the rather obscure 
scowl, but when his joyously noisy behavior is met with 
a sudden reproach, he is forced to a more careful survey 
of the situation. After many trials and errors, the child 
learns to perceive a variety of rather subtle features, The 
learning is slow, however; the average child is five or more 
before he can, for example, identify the characteristics 
which distinguish ugly from the pretty faces, and prob- 
ably considerably older before the less conspicuous evi- 
dences of anger, pleasure, annoyance, or sadness are per- 
ceptible. In these forms of social perception, the child 
learns very much more readily than his dog. The latter, 
doubtless, never perceives beauty or ugliness, the facial 
expression of scorn or sorrow, although various bodily 
movements which precede a kick or blow, or the pro- 
vision of food, etc., are singled out. The degree to which 
social perception extends among human individuals ap- 
pears clearly enough in instances which show an unusual 
lack of it. The individual who does not realize that he 
is boring when he means to be interesting, amusing when 
he thinks he is impressive, offensive when he tries to be 
complimentary, or who does not observe that he is un-

welcome in a group, portrays one of the most striking 
failures of perceptual learning. In part, failures in so¢ial 
perception are due to inability to okserve one’s self. It 
was found in an investigation in which each one of a 
group of college girls judged each of her acquaintances as 
well as herself for various traits, that those generally rec- 
ognized by others as the most snobbish, vulgar, or con- 
ceited were very poor judges of themselves in those re- 
spects. They apparently did not perceive, as others did, 
in their own words,, deeds, and expressions the elements 
- of the undesirable traits. Similarly, those who possessed 
the least refinement, intelligence, sociability, humor and 
neatness were rather blind to their deficiencies. They 
possessed, moreover, inferior ability to perceive these 
characteristics in other people. Having never perhaps 
achieved clear ideas of what constitutes sociability, neat- 
ness, refinement, etc., either in themselves or others, the 
process of learning came to an early halt. They were 
like the child learning to write or speak without a distinct 
model to utilize in discovering successful and erroneous 
reactions. 
There are a number of rationalized or commercialized 
methods of character perception, simple lessons by which 
one is able, supposedly, to learn how to perceive various 
fundamental traits, honesty, intelligence, or executive 
ability, by observing features of the face, head, or other 
physical traits. To be saleable, such systems are often 
very simple, too simple in fact to be sound. Usually 
they are useless; often misleading. The really important 
signs by which competent judges of human ability and 
character are guided are far more subtle than the color 
of the eyes, breadth of the forehead, shape of the nose, 
prominence of the chin, and the like. They are, in fact 
usually too subtle to identify readily. Elements of speech

THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 303 
and significant manners, the physique, facial expres- 
sion rather than features, dress with all of its intricacies 
of style, neatness—all of these and many other traits may 
be involved in the perception of character. Very fre- 
quently it happens that the meaning of each of the many 
possible characteristics is not well singled out as such. 
One simply concludes, without analysis—that is, on the 
basis of many factors acting at once—that this man is 
trustworthy or not, or that he will make a good, average, 
or poor clerk. 
“Intuition.”—When the various features upon which 
perception is based are not individually understood as 
the result of conscious analysis, the term intuition is 
sometimes applied. “I know by intuition that that man 
is not altogether trustworthy.” “I dislike that man, but 
just why I do not know.” “I feel as though I were 
catching cold.” “Something tells me that it is going to 
rain.” These are representative statements of common 
situations in which we perceive, but do not know by 
what particulars the percept is occasioned. Sometimes 
it is an obscure feature, such as a curious look about 
the eyes or mouth, which suggests dishonesty; sometimes 
many stimuli acting together—such as various unlocalized 
sensations from the body which result in the impression 
of impending illness, or the unanalysed effects of damp- 
ness, chilliness, and other atmospheric conditions, may 
occasion the idea of rain. 
Perception of Distance.—In a number of instances in 
which practised individuals have been unable to discover 
the factors by which their percepts of objects or condi- 
tions were determined, careful research has resulted in 
an analysis more or less complete. One of the best ex- 
amples is the disentangling of the process of perceiving 
the distance of an object. The child or adult, of course,
-P-A-G-E-321
304. PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
seldom gives a thought to the means employed in ob- 
' serving the relative distance of objects. He simply sees 
that one thing is near, another far. The process is quite 
as “intuitional” as those processes of the less usual char- 
acter just mentioned. The preferable statement is that 
all intuitions are percepts. The fact that perception of 
distance or depth is complex and the factors involved un- 
analysed will illustrate the similarity of the two. 
When the eye is exposed to the light waves reflected 
from a landscape, an image is formed on the retina much 
as it is formed on the plate of a photographic camera. 
It is a flat image, without depth, the third dimension of 
space. The individual, of course, really sees with his 
brain, although the activity of the eye is an essential step 
in the series of events, and he sees things at different dis- 
tances, not as if painted on a flat canvas. The percept of 
some things near and others far, which may be made 
almost instantly, is based on a number of very subtle 
stimuli, acting simultaneously. The more distant the 
object the smaller the image cast on the retina; partly 
cut off from view by intervening objects, the distant ob- 
jects are less clear in outline and detail; they are washed 
out in color, taking on a bluish or purplish hue and lack- 
ing the reds, yellows, and other warm tones of near ob- 
jects; shadows cast by distant objects appear less distinct 
and of different shape from those nearby. The right eye 
gets a somewhat different view of near objects than the 
left, since they view from slightly different angles. The 
effect is greatest for very near objects and becomes less 
until at a distance of three or four hundred feet the differ- 
ences are negligible. These factors, and possibly more, 
operate with the eyes and head motionless, Movements 
of the head yield other data inasmuch as near objects 
seem to move in a direction opposite that of the head,
-P-A-G-E-322
THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 305 
while distant objects follow the head-changes which are 
easily observed during rapid movement, as when one is 
riding in a train. All of these factors may operate to- 
gether to determine one’s ready perception of depth. 
Some of them are very subtle details and their interrela- 
tions are complex. 
A great many human percepts are equally complex and 
equally difficult to dissect. In much the same way that 
we find ourselves able to speak, write, or ride a bicycle 
without knowing very well how we do it—much less how 
we learned—we find ideas with which we may think, 
with little, if any, inkling as to how or when the facts 
were acquired, and we perceive characteristics of objects 
and events without knowing how the percept was ac- 
quired. The same laws of learning and reacting seem to 
hold in the perception of trees, men, songs, beauty, sym- 
metry, distance, weight, honesty, sin, shape, and other 
situations as were found in motor learning. One charac- 
teristic of perceptual learning, its analytical character, 
. Should be followed through in greater detail with special 
reference to the acquisition of abstract notions. 
Tue Acquisition or Asstract Ipnas 
John is a particular boy; but he may be perceived as 
made up of many qualities or characteristics such as 
height, weight, color, flesh, hair, honesty, strength, in- 
telligence, etc. The dime which you see on the table is 
commonly said to be a concrete or particular object; but 
perceptually it may be analysed into brightness, round- 
ness, metal-ness, hardness, solidity, value. We can learn 
to perceive each of the qualities, and what is perceived 
may later be the object of thought. An interesting, and 
certainly a tremendously important, human characteris-
-P-A-G-E-323
306 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
tic is the capacity after sufficient and proper experience 
to learn to think of many of these qualities quite inde- 
pendently of the setting or situation in which they have 
been perceived. We can come to experience an idea of 
roundness, hardness, area, or honesty, without thinking 
of the concrete situations in which the qualities have 
been observed. The character has been torn out, disen- 
tangled, abstracted from the other details among which it 
has been perceived. Such ideas are commonly called 
abstract ideas. 
Illustrations of Abstractions.—Inasmuch as one of the 
important tasks of education is the development of ab- 
stract ideas, and inasmuch as such ideas are most im- 
portant materials of thought, it will be advisable to as- 
certain as fully as possible the principles involved in such 
learning. In arithmetic one, two, and other numbers; 
sum, difference, remainder, product, and average; add, 
subtract, divide, and multiply; percentage, discount, in- 
terest, profit; length, width, height, area, and volume 
are not real objects in the ordinary sense, but elements or 
aspects which may appear in countless different situa- 
tions. In other subjects we encounter such concepts as 
noun, verb, subject, predicate, object; soft, hard, big, 
little; triangle, circle, square; above, beside, without; 
north, south; if, why, how, nevertheless. Honesty, fair- 
ness, right, wrong, sympathy, liberty, justice, government, 
law, order,—these are facts which do not exist in the 
child’s experience until ideas of them are laboriously 
acquired. 
The process of development of many abstract ideas re- 
quires several years. An average child of three or four 
can correctly perceive a large number of objects such as 
a key, knife, watch, pencil, various animals, fruits, and 
so on, but he is usually five before he understands cor-
-P-A-G-E-324
THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 307 
rectly heavy or light. He is six before he has abstract 
notions of right and left. Not until past eight does he 
realize the meaning of, or take much interest in, abstract 
differences, such as the difference between a fly and a 
butterfly, or an egg anda stone. Not until twelve is the 
child able to define such abstract words as pity, charity, 
revenge, justice. Previous to this year, the average child 
may have been taught to express pity and to act chari- 
tably, but the idea has not been thoroughly abstracted. 
He may, too, have been taught verbal definitions of some 
of these terms without really having the idea in abstract 
form. 
The Need of Many Situations Containing the Abstract 
Element.—To provide the proper conditions for ab- 
stracting a character, it is necessary to present a large 
number of different situations which contain the ele- 
ment. When the abstract quality is given in but one - 
situation, or but few situations, the dissociation is seldom 
complete; the element remains imbedded in the larger 
unit. A mother had attempted to teach her child the 
meaning of square by presenting the top of a box which 
was displayed while the word “square” was repeated and 
explained. When the father was told of the lesson, he 
held up a paper, asking “What is this?” “A paper,” 
was the response. “Yes, but what kind of a paper?” 
“A white paper,” etc. No effects of the lesson could be 
secured by the use of cards and other objects, but when 
directly asked “What is a square?” the child ran to the 
box, exclaiming proudly, “That is a square.” The element 
squareness had not been abstracted. It was not known 
as such but only rather vaguely as a feature of the box 
situation. To develop the idea of squareness, one must 
show the child many different gross totals which contain 
it, such as a square card, a square desk, a square block, a
-P-A-G-E-325
308 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
square board, drawing, picture, etc. When many differ- 
ent situations are presented, the squareness element can- 
not be easily or immediately associated with them all, and 
it is unlikely that it will become associated with any one 
since it is so slightly connected with each. As the other 
features, let us say the “boxness,” “paperness,” “rug- 
ness,” etc., become more numerous, each is so weakly con- 
nected with “squareness” that none is likely to be recalled 
—a fact more easily shown by a few diagrams, 
Think of each of these gross totals as including but two 
elements, a “squareness” element and a “thingness,” i.e., 
“box-ness” element. Actually, of course, the learner is 
dealing with many more than two elements. Suppose 
that we repeatedly present but one square object, a box, 
to which the responses are squareness and boxness. Then, 
according to the familiar principle of associating two 
stimuli together, each response becomes more and- more 
strongly attached to each other stimulus, as is shown 
here:

Situation Response 
Boxness ——————» Awareness of boxness 
Sauareness ——~———> Awareness of squareness 
LATER 
Boxness ———> Boxness ==>. boxness 
Squareness  squareness ——> squareness 
What we have done here is to combine the two reac- 
tions rather than isolate them. What we want, however, 
is not combination but dissociation. 
Now, consider the next procedure, in which many 
square objects are presented one after another. On the

The square to square connection, however weak at the 
start, is gradually growing stronger without being at- 
tached consistently to any one other irrelevant response. 
When one hundred objects have been presented, square- 
ness tends to connect slightly and about equally to each 
and every object, but it tends to lead to the idea of 
squareness more ‘strongly since that connection has re- 
ceived one hundred times as much exercise as have the 
other connections. In this practice, however, there is no 
principle actively operating toward dissociation. All that
-P-A-G-E-327
310 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
we are doing is to give the square —> square connection the 
advantage over others by a preponderance of exercise. 
The Use of a Contrasting Abstract Element.—An- 
other form of association of elements provides directly 
for dissociation. It consists in presenting a situation 
which contains the abstract element squareness along 
with a similar gross situation which contains an unlike 
or opposite abstract element. For example, present at 
the same time a square card and a round ecard; a square 
table and a round table; a square tin and a round tin; 
and so on.

sult-is that they tend to nullify each other, leaving the 
ground clear for the square > square and the round 
round connections. 
The square — square and the round— round connec- 
tions would here be far stronger than any others, partly 
because they receive so much more exercise, and partly 
because each object is connected both with round and 
square, contradictory tendencies which tend to neutralize 
each other. The result is that in the course of time the 
child is able to recognize squareness and roundness in al- 
most any situation in which it appears; and furthermore, 
he is able to think of square and round without recalling 
the particular situations in which they were encountered. 
His idea is that of an abstracted feature, quality or 
relation. 
Some Practica SUGGESTIONS 
From the analysis of the process of acquiring abstract 
ideas, several suggestions follow. 
Attention to Details—Direct and encourage the pupil 
to attend to the significant details. This may be done by 
pointing out, illustrating, emphasizing in speech, or other- 
wise calling attention to the element at the start. One 
should try to prevent attention from becoming dispersed 
over the object in a general way or from becoming at- 
tached to some irrelevant detail. 
The Choice of Gross Situations.—Select gross totals 
in which the elements in question are as obtrusive as 
possible and encumbered by as few irrelevant details as 
possible. The circles or squares should be real circles 
and squares, not approximations. If you are trying to 
illustrate justice or honesty, it should not be confused 
with a number of other irrelevant ideas contained in the 
story or illustration.
-P-A-G-E-330
THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 313 
The Avoidance of Irrelevant Details.—Care should be 
taken lest somie other irrelevant element invariably ac- 
company the one in question. For example, squareness 
should not always be presented in the form of solid ob- 
jects, such as boxes, boards, ete.; it should sometimes be 
outlined on a paper or on the board, otherwise squareness 
may always mean a square solid. In teaching the mean- 
ing of noun,. consider these two procedures: 
A, 
The bird sings. 
A dog runs rapidly. 
Her dress is brown. 
B, 
The horse is large. 
Where is my pencil? 
Please get the umbrella. 
A is ineffective because the noun is always the subject 
of a sentence. If the child received only this form of drill 
when presented with the sentence: Who has my book? 
who rather than book would probably be called the noun. 
In B, this error is avoided since the noun occurs as object 
as well as subject, and at the end as well as at the begin- 
ning of a sentence. 
Providing Abundant Experience.—A clean-cut ab- 
stract idea is usually achieved only as the outcome of 
wide experience. Children may learn to act in a 
kindly or honest manner in a number of situations, or to 
add or to use the number two on many occasions, with- 
out really acquiring the abstract idea involved. The fol- 
lowing definitions, given by children of twelve or above, 
illustrate inadequate notions of the real meaning of jus- 
tice. “It means a court”; “It’s the Court House”; “It
-P-A-G-E-331
314 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
means to have peace”; “to be kind”; “to be honest’; “to 
do right”; “to get punished.” When children have such 
ideas as: “to multiply always means to make bigger” ; 
“weight is what is in things to make them fall”; “ad- 
verbs are what end in -ly”; the analysis has obviously 
been incomplete. The idea of a number—2, 3, 4, or 5— 
includes many significant features which must be dis- 
covered before the notion is adequately abstracted. The 
number four means in certain instances a collection of 
four particular items—hats, men, or tops. To know the 
meaning of four in this sense is to have an idea of the 
collective feature, and the ability to perceive the four- 
ness of any collection of this size. Four may also mean 
a stopping place in a series. ‘Thus the child may count 
1, 2, 3, 4, and four-ness in this serial sense may exist 
apart from the collection meaning. Four, again, may 
mean a position; it is the number between three and five. 
It may also mean a relative size; thus if is one 
——_____——_ is four. Four may also mean half of 
eight; twice two; one plus three; seven minus three; the 
square of two; the square root of sixteen; the cube root 
of sixty-four; and soon. The idea of four is thus a grow- 
ing concept built out of experience in which analysis must 
occur before combination into more meaningful units of 
thought may be achieved. Well arranged and rich expe- 
rience is quite essential. Difficulties in thinking experi- 
enced, for example, in solving problems in arithmetic often 
rest upon deficiencies in analysis of many elementary fac- 
tors, upon insufficient experience in some directions, and 
upon total neglect of others. 
The Use of Rules, Definitions, and Other Verbal Ex- 
planations.—A popular method of attempting to abridge 
the process of acquiring ideas has been to make abundant 
use of theories, explanations, rules, reasons, definitions,  
-P-A-G-E-332
THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 315 
and other formule, presented in words, written or spoken. 
Verbal definitions of roundness, acute angles, or honesty; 
explanations of why “honesty is the best policy” or why 
we “carry” in addition; the use of axioms in geometry 
from which particular facts are to be discovered by de- 
ductive reasoning; the rules and definitions in physics and 
grammar—these are instances of this general practice. 
Older text books in spelling, arithmetic, grammar, history, 
geography, and other subjects were packed with such 
verbal formule as: “Gravity is the accelerating tendency 
of bodies toward the center of the earth”; “Justice is the 
rendering of what is due or merited”; “A fraction is a 
quantity less than a unit or one expressed as the sum of 
a number of aliquot parts”; “A preposition is a part of 
speech that denotes the relation of an object to an action 
or thing”; “An angle is that relation of lines which is 
measured by the amount of rotation necessary to make 
one coincide with the other.” 
The Deductive Method.—Most of these formule are 
verbal formulations of an abstract idea. The pupil, sup- 
posedly, having learned the formula, could apply it to 
particular instances by logical deduction. With a mini- 
mum of practice in application, the abstract idea sup- 
posedly would be clarified and henceforth generally appli- 
cable to any particular case. This has often been called 
the deductive method of teaching which has been used 
widely in mathematics, geometry, grammar, and science. 
Several difficulties have been encountered in attempt- 
ing to lead from the verbal formula to the particular facts. 
Often the definition or rule when given at the start is 
meaningless to the pupil. The adult understands the 
formula because it is a summary or general statement of 
the essence of the particular facts with which he is already 
familiar. No less serious, but more easily remedied, are
-P-A-G-E-333
316 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
the difficulties presented by the use of words and lin- 
guistic structures that are beyond the learner’s compre- 
hension. Many of us have had the experience of suddenly 
realizing in our twenties, or later, the meaning of defini- 
tions, rules, or poetic gems about Truth that were learned 
in our teens. A formula which cannot be understood 
because of the pupil’s inexperience with the related facts, 
or because of linguistic difficulties, will, of course, fail to 
function. Even when the verbal principles are clearly 
and intelligibly phrased, it requires skilful teaching to 
make them function. There is a tendency on the part of 
both the teacher and the pupil to test real understanding 
by noting the accuracy with which the rule or definition is 
cited. The teacher may assume that knowledge of the 
axioms in geometry, of the general laws in physics or the 
rules in grammar or spelling is satisfactory evidence of 
the mastery of the facts. The pupil, seeking the line of 
least resistance—as most of us do in learning—finds it 
easier to memorize the definitions and rules than to un- 
derstand the details. The verbal expressions thus become 
ends instead of means and merely form an additional 
burden. 
The Inductive Method.—Perceiving these objections, 
teachers sometimes go to the opposite extreme, utilizing 
what is called a purely inductive method in which the 
principle or the abstract idea is not presented verbally 
until very late, if at all. The pupil is required to abstract 
the rule or general truth by himself, if he can. Thus, 
spelling, arithmetic, grammar, moral habits, and the like 
are taught entirely by means of specific experiences. Such 
a spelling rule as “J before e except after c, or when 
sounded like a as in neighbor or weigh,” or such an arith- 
metical definitions as “Multiplication is the process of 
taking one number as many times as there are units in
-P-A-G-E-334
THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 31? 
another,” or the explanation of “Honesty is the best 
policy,” together with memorization of the sentence, is 
considered essentially futile. 
‘The Combined Method.—Both practices, that of ex- 
treme dependence upon verbal formule and that of com- 
plete or nearly complete disregard of verbal explanations, 
are inadvisable. While concepts stated in words cannot 
replace real experiences, and while they are often clumsily 
framed. and unwisely used, verbal generalizations and 
definitions may be very fruitfully employed. Their use- 
fulness is, of course, the only real test. The reaction 
against rules and definitions has developed from the dis- 
covery that most of the rules in common school use were 
of no real service. But with simplicity of linguistic con- 
struction and accuracy in describing the facts, the proper 
utilization of verbal formule will be of appreciable 
service. 
The time at which a rule or principle should be intro- 
duced 1s a matter of importance. It is impossible to give 
a definite statement in terms of the point in the process, 
beginning, middle, or end, at which the definition should 
be introduced-with best effect. The essential require- 
ment is that verbal generalization and specific experience 
should interpenetrate. Sometimes the definition or prin- 
ciple should be introduced at the very start, as when 
previous experiences afford a partial understanding. 
Usually the generalization must be delayed until experi. 
ence has been sufficient to make the principle partly in- 
telligible. It should come at a time when it will to some 
degree illuminate the particular facts of which it is a 
summary or generalization and when it will be illuminated 
by them. Introduced too early, it is likely to be learned 
by rote independently of the particulars; introduced toc 
late, its explanatory function can be only partly fulfilled.
-P-A-G-E-335
318 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
Generalization and experience must develop together, 
each enriching the other. 
The facts may be illustrated by an experiment by Judd 
and Scholckow, in which verbal explanations of the ab- 
stract theory of refraction were found to assist in clarify- 
ing the idea and in making it practically applicable. The 
practical test was success in learning to hit a target placed 
under water. One group of boys was given practice with 
a target under twelve inches of water, along with expla- 
nations of the theory of refraction; another was given 
practice without the theoretical explanation. For some 
time both groups did about equally well. The theory 
seemed to be of no value in the first series of tests—per- 
haps because it was introduced too early, or because it 
was unintelligible until it became clarified in the light of 
experience. But later theory and practice did fuse, with 
the result that the first group not only “got the idea” of 
refraction to some degree, but also made more rapid 
strides in accuracy in throwing at submerged targets, 
especially when the depth in the water was changed. 
While the effect of verbal explanations alone was not 
tested, it is probable that by this single means, just as 
by experience alone, the idea of refraction would not have 
been developed so effectively as by the two dynamically . 
combined. 
The failure of rules, definitions, explanations, and _| 
other formule to function may be attributed partly to 
the use of the wrong kind of formulation or to use at the 
wrong time. Definitions and explanations must keep 
pace with the growing idea. They must, like the idea, 
develop gradually. We cannot begin with a final tech- 
nical definition of a fact, any more than we can begin with 
full-fledged knowledge of the fact. Early explanations 
must be incomplete if the general ideas—whether of pa-
-P-A-G-E-336
THE ACQUISITION OF PERCEPTS AND IDEAS 319° 
triotism, evolution, gravitation, or multiplication—are 
complex and long in developing. Definitions should be. 
enlarged to fit the experience then occurring or which has 
just occurred. The final and quite comprehensive for- 
mula comes near or at the end, serving to sum up the 
whole experience or to throw in relief its essence. 
Tue Acquisition or IpEALs 
Among other abstract ideas, honesty, trustworthiness, 
justice, fair play, loyalty, mercy, and the like have been 
included. The term ideal is used in several senses, but 
most commonly to embrace the idea of the characteristics 
of honest, loyal, or merciful behavior plus an impulse to 
act in the characteristic way when the appropriate situ- 
ation is provided. The impulse to action is subordinate 
to the perception or idea, in the sense that an individual 
cannot generally act honestly unless he is aware of what 
constitutes the honest course of action. The develop- 
ment of honesty in behavior, then, is in part dependent 
upon the development of the ability to perceive what we 
may call the honesty element in various situations. A 
clear idea of honesty is acquired in the same way that 
ideas of squareness, angles, four-ness are arrived at by 
analysis and eventual abstraction. The learner is assisted 
as before by meeting the “honest” feature of many differ- 
ent situations, by an analytical attitude, by having the 
element pointed out and emphasized, by contrasting it 
with dishonesty, by verbal explanations and formula- 
tions. As in the acquisition of other facts, honesty will 
not be thoroughly understood or dynamically effective by 
verbal instruction or deductive exercises alone, nor will 
the idea be most clearly acquired by experience alone— 
the two are acquired together, each supplementing the
-P-A-G-E-337
320 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
other. Ideals become effective impulses to action, when 
the idea is clearly perceived and followed by action with 
a satisfying effect. In moral training, each of these fea- 
tures must be developed—the perception of the moral 
quality and the doing of the moral act, followed by a 
satisfying state of affairs. When experience has been 
sufficient to enable one to perceive the moral aspect, as 
we perceive blueness or roundness in any situation, and 
when the percept or idea is followed by the impulse to act 
accordingly, we have the ideal in dynamic form, 
Children occasionally act in an inappropriate manner 
because they do not perceive the proper line of action; 
their idea is incomplete and inapplicable to some situa- 
tions. For example, many seven-year-old pupils, in 
answer to the question: “What’s the thing for you to do 
if a playmate hits you without meaning to do it?” give 
such answers as “Get even”; “Tell him to ‘cut it out’ ”; 
“Tell my mama”; “Not play with him” or otherwise 
show a failure to perceive the essential moral feature of 
the situation. To extract the proper moral quality is not 
of itself a guarantee of proper action, but it is a desirable 
antecedent. 
An Experimental Study.—An experimental study by 
Voelker gives an illustration of the simultaneous develop- 
ment of moral ideas and moral conduct. Six groups of 
about a dozen boys each, of ages ten to fourteen, were 
first given a series of ten tests which offered an opportu- 
nity for either trustworthy or untrustworthy behavior. 
Situations were provided offering the boy an opportunity 
to keep over-change, to steal, to cheat in an examination, 
to tell a secret, to make false claims, ete. Each test pro- 
vided a real temptation; dishonesty would be rewarded 
by some immediate personal gain. The boys, of course, 
were unaware that the temptations were pre-arranged.

-P-A-G-E-339
322 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
while others were instances of seeing the right but doing 
the wrong. The greatest improvement, however, was ob- 
tained by the deliberate selection of life situations, which 
afford opportunity to perceive and do the trustworthy 
act, along with verbal explanations and formulations such 
as slogans and mottoes which became meaningful by 
penetrating the experience and in turn made the experi- 
ence more intelligible and fruitful. 
But ideas become effective ideals only when they have 
led promptly to action that is accompanied or followed by 
satisfying effects. When this occurs frequently, the idea 
becomes an impulse to action; the individual is ready to 
act, and, as elsewhere, for him then to act is satisfying, 
for him not to act or to act differently is annoying.

- activity is usually incessant; there is very little evidence 
that the animal thinks the problem over—at least, it does 
not appear to “stop and think.” It continues to try all of 
the forms of manipulation in its equipment, until finally 
the right move is hit upon, apparently by accident. When 
the cat is again placed in the box, it gives evidence of 
little understanding of the solution. It apparently does 
not know just how the previous escape was brought 
about. The task of learning the way out a second time 
is nearly as difficult as before. The solution is gradually 
acquired by a process of trials, elimination of annoying 
errors, and the selection of the successful, and hence satis- 
fying, reactions. 
The duplication of such an experiment with human 
subjects may be approximated by using a latch or some 
sort of mechanical puzzle which will be as new to the man 
as the puzzle box latch was to the cat. The general fea- 
tures of the learning by man are often very simjlar to 
those employed by the animal. The former resorts at 
once to manipulation, turning the parts this way and that, 
twisting, pulling, pushing; sometimes repeating the same 
futile effort time after time—foolishly, one who knew the 
trick might say—sometimes shifting rapidly without ap- 
parent aim, sometimes retracing the old steps. In the 
course of these varied attempts, the solution may be hit 
upon, often so unexpectedly that it is not understood at 
all, The second trial may then be much like the first; 
but at length the useless moves are eliminated, while those 
constituting the solution are retained and perfected. This 
we would be inclined to call a rather stupid human per- 
formance, in which little, if any, reasoning is involved. It 
is, nevertheless, a type of human learning that is not un- 
usual when the problem is both novel and difficult. 
Some learners, however, proceed in a different fashion,
-P-A-G-E-344
REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING 327 
They manipulate less while observing and thinking more. 
Holding the puzzle before them, they carefully study its 
construction, comparing the sizes of different rings and 
hooks, estimating the results of various moves, and keep- 
ing on the lookout for clues or suggestions. They may 
also attempt to recall the solutions of other puzzles, or 
to apply general or particular facts learned from preced- 
ing experiences with door locks, and other mechanical de- 
vices. The learner does more than merely manipulate 
the object; he recalls various facts which careful per- 
ception of the puzzle suggest, and manipulates or explores 
among these ideas. There is an active search to link the 
present problem up with past experiences which utilize 
the same principle. And this tendency to utilize recalled 
facts in addition to those that may be directly perceived 
in the problem-situation is one of the important charac- 
teristics of reasoning. 
In reasoning, we have not sidetracked the familiar trial- 
and-error procedure. We have merely widened the field 
of manipulation. Not only may we explore among facts 
presented to the senses, but we may also explore among 
facts recalled. New facts may be observed not only in 
‘the situations present to the sense but in those present to 
mind. The recall of pertinent facts, general and par- 
ticular, is an effective way of bringing our past experi- 
ences to bear upon our present difficulties. 
The good reasoner not only recalls, but he carefully 
observes the present situation and his own reactions. The 
facts observed may be later recalled, so that he can re- 
hearse the whole problem mentally, thus saving muscular 
work and often leading to a solution. Careful observa- 
tion, too, often enables him to recall the state of affairs 
which attends an accidental discovery of the solution, 
thus avoiding the common waste of effort shown by ani-
-P-A-G-E-345

mals that hit upon the solution without having perceived 
it. The careful observer may recall the circumstances 
and his own reaction and thus “see” how it happened, or, 
at least, observe clues whose usefulness appears during 
the next trial. 
In reasoning, then, the first condition is a novel or 
problem-situation to which previously acquired or native 
reactions are an unsatisfactory solution. There is always 
a delay during which the satisfactory response is discov- 
ered. In working out the solution, the trial-and-error 
form of procedure is apparent. In this respect, reasoning 
is identical with other forms of complex learning. The 
distinguishing characteristics of reasoning embrace (1) an 
attentive, active analysis of the problem-situation by 
means of observation—not only visual observation, ex- 
ploration, and analysis, but similar study through other 
senses such as hearing, as when one shakes a box to get 
an inkling of its contents, or smelling, tasting, feeling 
with the fingers, lifting, turning about, and variously ma- 
nipulating—and (2) a conscious recall of past experiences, 
the utilization of ideas, general and particular, which re- 
cur during the study. 
Insights’ and Hypotheses.—The result of observing 
many details and recalling many past experiences is the 
possibility of reacting to many selected situations operat- 
ing at once. Solutions are discovered and new ideas or 
hypotheses conceived by getting together in a single mo- 
ment of consciousness many aspects of the present ~*’ 
ation and of past situations more or less relevant.

complex group of items together, certain manipulations— 
that is, maneuvers which lead to a certain point of view— 
sometimes result in the sudden realization of a fact not 
previously noticed. Whether this result is called a per- 
cept, hypothesis, inference, deduction, insight, or discov- 
ery matters little. The suddenness with which it ap- 
pears, though a long period of exploration may have 
preceded it, is frequently characteristic. It seems virtu- 
ally to “pop out.” Great discoveries are often finally 
“seen” with equal suddenness. “Hauy drops a bit of erys-

tallized caleium spar, and, looking at one of the broken 
prisms, cries out, ‘All is found!’ and immediately verifies 
his quick intuition in regard to the nature of crystalli- 
zation.” 1 The world is full of facts awaiting some one 
sagacious enough to see them. The one who perceives 
them first makes a discovery and is accredited with 
genius. Others see them readily enough when they know 
what to look for and how to look. This point is well illus- 
trated by a story from the life of Darwin, in which he 
describes his observations of some natural phenomenon 
after Agassiz’s discovery of evidence of a glacial period 
in prehistoric days. “We spent many hours in Cwm 
Idwal, examining all the rocks with supreme care, as

Sedgwick (another eminent scientist) was anxious to find 
fossils in them; but neither of us saw a trace of the 
wonderful glacial phenomena all about us; we did not 
notice the plainly scarred rocks, the perched boulders. 
... Yet the phenomena are so conspicuous that ... a 
house burnt down by fire did not tell its story more 
plainly than did this valley.” ! 
Tue SoLuTion oF VERBAL PROBLEMS 
In any situation, reasoning comprises the analysis of 
the gross total facts into their constituents, the supple- 
mentation of these minute facts with others recalled from 
past experience, and the perception of previously 
unobserved facts in the new combinations of details. 
These characteristics may be illustrated by the solution 
of verbal problems of the type encountered in one form 
or another in everyday life, taking first a relatively simple 
problem which may be solved by an average child of 
seven and «& half years. 
Kate is cleverer than May. 
May is cleverer than Jane. 
Who is cleverest—Jane, Kate, or May? 
The pupil must. first grasp the problem or question, 
namely, “who is cleverest?” To succeed, this question 
must be held in mind during the exploration among the 
other facts. Next, the relevant facts concerning each 
individual must be perceived. To understand that “Kate 
is cleverer than May” requires some analysis in itself. 
One must observe not merely that there are two individ- 
uals, but the way in which they are related. Next, the 
relation of May to Jane must be similarly comprehended. 
But to perceive singly that Kate is cleverer than May

and that May is cleverer than Kate would be insufficient. 
These two facts must be seen together in the light of the 
question “who is cleverest?”, before the solution is 
apparent. Success may not be achieved because the sub- 
ject fails to understand the problem, because he fails to 
grasp the pertinent facts individually, because he fails 
to combine them properly or because, when properly 
combined, the relations are not observed. 
The next problem is somewhat more complex. It is 
too difficult for an average seven- or eight-year-old child 
but may be solved by an average child of nine. It is a 
closer approach to the problems of everyday life, inas- 
much as the facts essential to the solution are mixed with 
others that are quite irrelevant, thus making the task 
of analysis more difficult. 
In cold, damp climates, root crops, like potatoes and turnips grow 
est 5 
In temperate climates, there are abundant pastures, and oats and 
barley flourish: 
In sub-tropical climates, wheat, olives, and vines flourish: 
In tropical climates, date-palms and rice flourish: 
The ancient Greeks lived largely on bread, with oil for butter: 
they had wine to drink and raisins for fruit. 
Which climate do you think they had? 
To solve this problem, the child must first fix upon the 
main question, which requires some analysis. Out of the 
‘last two statements the “What climate did they have” 
statement must be combined with the notion of Greeks, 
so that the question becomes clearly “What climate did 
the Greeks have?” The solution will not be obtained 
unless this question is perceived and remembered. Next, 
information not contained in the problem-situation must 
be available and it must be suggested by getting the 
right facts together. The child must know that bread 
comes from wheat, and not from root crops, potatoes,
-P-A-G-E-350
REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING 333 
turnips, date-palms, etc. He must know also that oil 
comes from olives rather than oats, potatoes, rice, etc., 
and that raisins are to be associated with vines, rather 
than with date-palms, turnips, etc. These facts, assum- 
ing that they are known, must be brought out during 
a process of study in which many irrelevant matters are 
observed and discarded. Several erroneous hypotheses 
may be suggested as various facts are viewed together 
before the correct solution is obtained by narrowing the 
field down to the facts contained in lines 3, 5, and 6, and 
seeing the relations contained therein. 
In the reasoning of the adult, or even of the genius, 
we do not move into a new mental realm or encounter 
abilities utterly different from those found in the efforts 
of the nine-year-old child, but merely ascend to higher 
levels on the same scales of abilities. As the problems 
mastered by the twelve-year-old child would surpass the 
comprehension of the younger children, so the operations 
of the genius in his field are perplexing to the ordinary 
adult. But in making the most profound discoveries, the 
man of genius excels the average man only in utilizing at 
once more facts, which he sees more clearly and in greater 
detail, among which he selects and rejects in more subtle 
fashion, and in which he perceives relations more 
sagaciously. 
Tyres or REASONING 
The mental operations which comprise reasoning are 
essentially the same in the many varieties of problems 
that are encountered. Any situation which is at once 
novel and complex, whether in practical affairs, school 
subjects, religion, aesthetics, music, or any other field, 
provides the occasion for reasoning. In addition to the 
problem-situation, there must be a motive. And the
-P-A-G-E-351
334 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
variety of motives is wide. We may reason just for the 
satisfaction in mastering a problem, although more fre~ 
quently the incentive is the desire to secure some end— 
food, comfort, a fact needed in business—or to avoid 
some annoyance, such as confinement, deprivation, or 
thwarting. No convenient categories seem to include 
all varieties of motives nor of problem-situations, but 
the following groups suggest types that are distinctive 
with respect to the general methods of procedure. 
1. Finding the Key to a Complex Situation —Most of 
the practical problems fall under this head. Typically, 
the individual is confronted by a complex situation, 
which offers a large number of possible reactions. The 
question is to find the one satisfactory response, that is, 
the solution, as when we encounter situations and ask 
such questions as “What is this?” or “What is this for?” 
“How is it used?” “What does this mean?” “Where can 
my umbrella be?” “How did this get here?” or “How 
did you do that trick?” In all of these cases the number 
of interpretations is legion. We must take them up one 
after another, try them out, reject useless clues, follow 
up promising lines, supplement them by recalling past 
experiences and trust to eventually getting together the 
‘combination of details which will suggest the answer to 
our question. The solution of mechanical puzzles, the 
search for the cause of the balking of an automobile, for 
the main point in a poem are of the same type. The 
essential characteristic of this type of reasoning is the 
presence of a large number of facts or details, out of 
which we must find a satisfactory response. 
In the foregoing illustrations the solution was typically 
some concrete line of action or the perception of some 
particular fact which was the key to the situation. The 
so-called inductive reasoning so abundantly utilized in
-P-A-G-E-352
REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING 335 
science is essentially the same, except that the key is 
typically a general rather than a particular fact. Science 
aims to discover laws, or general explanations. Thus , 
Darwin, after observing a large number of variations 
among animals of the same species, and similarities 
among different species which amounted to an essential 
continuity, finally conceived a single explanation for all 
of these facts, namely, the theory of evolution. This 
theory was really a key to the complex situations, in ~ 
much the same sense that after puzzling for a time with 
an arithmetic problem, a child sees that the thing to do 
is first to add certain figures, and then subtract another 
figure from the sum. As a psychological process it makes 
little difference whether the solution is a great law, or 
a particular fact. 
2. Application and Verification.—Reasoning may take 
its start from a general principle and seek for particular 
cases which illustrate it. One may attempt to apply a 
general law, either for the purpose of observing whether 
it holds good or not or for the purpose of understanding 
it better by practice in using it. If one’s interest is in 
testing the validity of a general statement, the process 
is called verification. If one does not question the 
generalization but wishes to find new particulars which 
it covers, the term application is commonly used. In 
either case the general fact becomes one element in the 
situation which must be grasped and held in mind, while 
various conerete situations, perceived or thought of, are 
viewed with it. Getting the general and particular facts 
together, one must perceive their essential similarities or 
differences; one must see whether they fit or are 
unrelated. Of course, there must be a great deal of 
exploration, trial-and-error activity, in recalling particu- 
lar cases and trying them out. This form of thinking,
-P-A-G-E-353
336 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
_of which there are several varieties, is called deductive 
i reasoning in contrast to the inductive method, but both 
are essentially the same psychologically. Both imply a 
oval and complex situation, a search for clues, the recall 
. of facts and experiences, and the ‘thinking of several 
\ things at once. 
In many instances, both the inductive and deductive 
procedures are employed. In trying to figure out the 
_use of a new piece of apparatus, one may be led from the 
study of particular parts to an hypothesis concerning the 
whole and then attempt to verify the hypothesis by 
applying it to the concrete situations which the theory 
suggests. In scientific investigations a general law, such 
as the Law of Effect, which is arrived at after long study 
of particular events, is later tested by trying it out in 
new situations in which it should hold, and is finally 
applied broadly to meet practical needs. On a smaller 
scale, laboratory experiments may involve the same 
steps: discovery of the “key” or general law, verification 
and proof, and application. 
Tue ImMprRovEMENT oF Mernops or REASONING 
With the characteristics of reasoning now before us, 
we may undertake a discussion of the equipment essen- 
tial to good reasoning, the methods by which and the 
extent to which reasoning may be improved. 
The Need of Facts.—Successful reasoning depends 
upon an abundance of ideas, particular and general facts 
and principles. In reasoning, we pick and choose among 
facts; view this and that together. Few people are able 
to reason about the Theory of Relativity, Evolution, 
or Electro-therapy because of a lack of the essential 
stock of facts. And some who could reason well concern-
-P-A-G-E-354
REASONING AND PROBLEM ‘SOLVING 337 
ing the explanation, application, or verification of these _ 
theories, might reason very poorly about a balking auto- 
mobile, investment securities, or pains in the chest, 
because of lack of information concerning mechanics, 
finance, or the diagnosis of disease. Unless the person 
has had previous experience with a situation in some 
degree similar, unless he has dealt with material of the 
same sort before, he may be quite incapable of finding 
a solution except by accident. An eminent thinker once 
compared the situation during reasoning to two cham- 
bers, a main chamber in which manipulation and study 
were going on, or in which the leading ideas were being 
rehearsed, and an antechamber crowded with ideas seek- 
ing an entrance to the main room. Unless the ante- 
chamber were well filled, little could be done. The most 
hopeful sign of probable success was an anteroom teem- 
ing with candidates for a “trial.” If we are to become 
competent thinkers in any line, the first, and by all odds 
the most important, thing is to accumulate experience 
and master the facts in that field. Without the facts and 
experience, the most gifted mind would be helpless. The 
most productive thinkers are not those who disregard the 
knowledge, methods, trials, and errors of others, but 
those who are most familiar with them. Originality is 
not opposed to the amassing of facts or the laws of ordi- 
nary learning, but dependent upon them. 
In a genuine sense, one’s reasoning ability in a par- 
ticular field is increased by an enlargement of knowledge 
and experience, but this is not the same as saying that 
some general power has been improved. We may not 
have improved our machinery; we may have merely 
accumulated raw products with which to increase the 
output. Facts, as we tried to show in the preceding 
chapters, may be acquired, in useful or clumsy form, so
-P-A-G-E-355
338 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
that other things being equal, the person who learns in 
the best way will be more successful in reasoning. To 
learn how to learn, and to learn a great deal, are probably 
the two most important aids to efficient reasoning. 
Mere accumulation of scattered information and 
experience is in itself an insufficient guarantee of ability 
to reason usefully. Minds which accumulate facts after 
the fashion of the newspaper “factogram” column or the 
encyclopedia of knowledge about everything are seldom 
competent thinkers. A Jack-of-all-trades is a master of 
none. Our ability to solve problems in arithmetic 
depends upon mastery of arithmetical facts, in history 
upon historical facts, and in every other line upon 
knowledge or experience in that line. For each new 
problem that we face, reasoning is a process of review 
and reorganization. Much depends on what is present, 
and how it is present, in order that it may be reviewed 
and rearranged. It is therefore not surprising to find 
that individuals capable of productive and valid reason- 
ing along one line are conspicuously lacking in sagacity 
along others. At the most, we can display originality in 
but few fields; reasoning ability is usually specialized in 
accordance with our experience and training. 
The Need of Practice Under Guidance.—Given an 
abundance of information, the task of improving the 
ability to solve problems is much like the task of improv- 
ing other abilities such as reading, spelling, writing, or 
the use of oral English. First of ali, there must be an 
abundance of practice. We learn to think by thinking. 
But just as in typewriting a learner left to himself is 
likely to improve slowly, to develop many ineffective 
devices, and to fail to acquire many elements of effective 
technique, so in reasoning best results are obtained by 
practice under guidance, The teacher may assist
-P-A-G-E-356
REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING 339 
appreciably by suggesting good practices and detecting. 
several rather common forms of ineffective technique. 
Keeping the Problem in Mind.—The first step in the 
process of solving a problem is to understand thoroughly 
and remember the main question. 
In a test which has been widely applied to children 
of various ages, two small boxes weighing three and 
fifteen grams respectively are presented, with these 
instructions: “You see these blocks. They look just 
alike, but one of them is heavy and one is light. Try 
them and tell me which one is heavier (or heaviest).” 
In some cases, five-year-old children fail in this test 
when they understand the directions and are able to 
discriminate easily between the weights, because they 
forget what the problem is. The task furnished by the 
instructions “Try and see which is heavier,” must be held 
firmly enough in mind to control the steps necessary for 
making the comparison. Such distracting impulses as 
to feel the blocks, pile one on the other, roll them 
about, etc., must be inhibited. One must move straight 
toward the goal. Terman, who has studied this test, 
finds that sometimes a very dull child starts off in a most 
promising way but soon appears to have forgotten the 
task. “His mental processes are not consecutive, stable, 
or controlled. He is blown about at the mercy of every 
gust of momentary interest.’ 
The problem held clearly in mind acts as a selective 
agency during the activities of reasoning. It tends to 
favor the perception of the facts appropriate to the 
solution of the problem. If some one speaks a sentence 
of which we hear only the final word scale, there are 
several ideas which may occur: a fish scale, weighing 
scale, music scale, scale of prices, a writing scale, “scale” 
a fence. But when the context of the sentence is known,
-P-A-G-E-357
340 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
the relevant meaning, and it alone, comes to mind. The 
successful thinker finds that out of the variety of possible 
meanings which each detail may yield, only the right 
one pops out. Others find that the right suggestion will 
not come. Tell a subtle joke to any group; some will 
see the point at once, but to others it comes slowly or 
not at all. When the right idea does not come, one is not 
left altogether helpless. One should not passively wait 
for something to come. Success may be achieved by 
instigating certain maneuvers. . 
A Systematic Analysis of Details.—The first maneuver 
is to proceed with the main question in mind and to 
examine actively the problem in piecemeal. Focus 
attention on one detail. Significant matters overlooked 
when the problem is thought of as a whole may be 
detected during an active study of one phase after 
another. In teaching, the habit of analytic scrutiny may 
be encouraged by questions directed to parts of the prob- 
lem. Systematic precedure, in which details are taken 
up in orderly fashion, their relation to the problem 
ascertained and futile leads noted, should be cultivated 
by means of practice under guidance. 
One trait, antagonistic to successful reasoning, is 
inflexibility. In attempting to solve a mechanical puzzle, 
a subject observed by Ruger spent ten hours on one line 
of attack. After having stated his assumption, which 
was an erroneous one, the subject was requested to strike 
out along other lines. After an hour and a quarter, he 
was asked again to tell what he was doing. He was still 
working on the same futile clue! This kind of stub- 
bornness or inflexibility is a fatal obstruction in the path- 
way of reason, and is reminiscent of the logic-tight 
compartments mentioned in Chapter IX. It amounts to 
sticking in a rut, closing the mind to new suggestions,
-P-A-G-E-358
REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING 341 
and results in disregarding very obvious clues. In deal- 
ing with many practical situations as well as political, 
social, and business issues, the same tendency appears as 
a disinclination to change a point of view, or even to 
reeonsider.an old problem.- To attempt to change an 
opinion, to venture a new solution of a problem, 
is usually somewhat disturbing and perplexing in much 
the same way as an attempt to speed up in reading or 
adding or to adopt a new method of typewriting. The 
ease and security which results from standing by old 
habits of thought and action oppose the tendencies to 
break away, to develop and try out new possibilities. 
Extreme conservatism, stubbornness, and inflexibility, 
then, are habits that the good thinker must avoid. 
Originality depends, in some degree, upon habits of open- 
mindedness, of keeping alive to wide variety of stimuli, 
and of remaining sensitive to all of the suggestions that a 
situation may contain, rather than in thinking only along 
the line most readily suggested. 
Some subjects show a tendency to skip about among 
the details of a problem in a superficial fashion, which 
is quite as serious a fault as too great a tenacity in stick- 
ing to a few clues. A promising line is undertaken and 
followed up. for a while, only to be suddenly dropped as 
another suggestion occurs. This kind of learner is too 
readily distracted; he is continually getting very 
“warm,” but by hastiness is robbed of a victory fairly 
within his grasp. In solving problems in arithmetic, 
history, and civics, and in practical affairs, habits of 
careless superficial thought may betray themselves in 
impulsiveness. The child leaps to conclusions with little 
effort to test the results. This is, indeed, a quite com- 
mon form of human fallibility. There seems to be a 
native disposition to accept as reliable any idea that
-P-A-G-E-359
342 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
comes easily. While guessing is to be encouraged and 
while it is in general healthy to entertain suggestions 
that thinking produces, it is quite as desirable to estab- 
lish habits of maintaining a state of doubt, of being 
critical, and of testing suggestions before they are 
accepted. Both “scatter-brain” thinking and inflexi- 
bility may to some extent be remedied by cultivating 
the habit of systematic procedure coupled with efforts to 
formulate articulate hypothesis, or possible forms of 
solution. After a preliminary survey, the subject should 
fix upon what appears to be the most pertinent facts and, 
considering them in connection with the problem, formu- 
late a clear-cut guess or hypothesis concerning the solu- 
tion. Teachers may assist by asking the pupil, “What 
is your problem?” “What facts are you now consider- 
ing?” “What do you think is a possible solution?” The 
learner should work, not aimlessly waiting for things to 
happen, but with a definite question or assumption in 
mind. Each assumption should be tested until its worth 
is determined beyond a reasonable doubt, then dropped 
and another taken up, until one by one the possibilities 
are exhausted. Such a procedure tends, for one thing, to 
narrow the field of operations. If the solution does not 
show itself spontaneously, it may be finally cornered 
and thus captured. Changes in the assumptions widen 
the possibilities for suggestions, since the same details 
may be perceived differently as words may have different 
meanings, when the point of view is changed. Solutions 
coming as the answer to the question, or in the course 
of the testing of a hypothesis, are better understood than 
those which “just come.” If the solution is anticipated, 
and linked with an assumption, it is better observed and 
understood. Usually an assumption grows out of past 
experience which is formulated as a general rule or prin-
-P-A-G-E-360
REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING 343 
ciple. The present solution is then perceived as a case 
which fits into a familiar type. 
Generalization—The subject, then, should study de- 
tails in connection with the main problem, attempt to 
guess the solution as he goes along, give each guess a fair 
try out, and advance systematically. When the problem 
is solved, it is advisable frequently to review some of 
the steps in an effort to generalize, or get the principle 
of the problem. The value of generalization was shown 
very clearly in the studies of mechanical puzzles, as indi- 
cated in the following quotation from Ruger: “A certain 
puzzle was so arranged that it could be presented in 
various forms. The manipulation for these various 
forms could all be comprised under a single formula. 
This general formula could be deduced from any one of 
these special forms. A number of subjects were tried 
with the puzzle. As soon as skill was acquired in dealing 
with one form of the puzzle it was changed to another 
form. The subjects who developed the general formula 
during the solution of the first form were able to use in 
the second form the specialized habits built up in the 
first form. Those who formed merely the special habits 
without developing the principle attempted to carry over 
the habits without modification and were greatly 
embarrassed by the change.” 
The value of the generalization is quite as great in 
the individual acts of problem solution as in the wider 
investigations of science. The development of general 
principles is, as we observed in Chapter I, the outstand- 
ing aim of science. The usefulness of general principles 
lies in the effectiveness with which they may be applied 
and thus explain individual problems. The subject who 
extracted from the complexity of the mechanical puzzle 
the general rule, succeeded in applying it to other
-P-A-G-E-361
344 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
situations, thus achieving the solution at once. The 
good thinker not only solves his problem but explains 
the solution. He seeks an understanding of this particu- 
lar experience in the light of others, especially in the 
light of some general rule or formula, as illustrated in 
an incident recorded by James: 
“T am sitting in a railroad-car, waiting for the train 
to start. It is winter, and the stove fills the car with 
pungent smoke. The brakeman enters, and my neighbor 
asks him to ‘stop that stove smoking.’ He replies that 
it will stop entirely as soon as the car begins to move. 
‘Why so?’ asks the passenger. ‘It always does,’ replies 
the brakeman. It is evident that the connection between 
the car moving and smoke stopping was a purely empiri- 
cal one in the brakeman’s mind, bred of habit. But if 
the passenger had been an acute reasoner, he, with no 
experience of what that stove always did, might have 
anticipated the brakeman’s reply, and spared his own 
question. Had he singled out of all the numerous points 
involved. in a stove’s not smoking the one special point 
of smoke pouring freely out of the stove-pipe’s mouth, 
he would, probably, owing to the few associations of 
that idea, have been immediately reminded of the law 
that a fluid passes more rapidly out of a pipe’s mouth if 
another fluid be at the same time streaming over that 
mouth; and then the rapid draught of air over the 
stove-pipe’s mouth, which is one of the points involved 
in the car’s motion,.would immediately have occurred to 
him.” 
Verification of Results.—In the scientific method, gen- 
eralization is closely related to-verification. The general 
hypothesis is not accepted uncritically but’ put to the 
most rigid test. It is verified by retracing all of the steps 
by which it was achieved, by application to new situa- 
tions which seem logically to be covered by it, and by 
searching for instances which are contradictory. Whether
-P-A-G-E-362
_ REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING 345 
application and criticism is wholly mental or carried out 
in the form of miniature tests and experiments, the out- 
come to’ be sought is a habit of self-criticism, or 
reasonable. doubt, of impersonal verification. 
. Habits of testing an obtained solution are of three- 
fold value. They assist pupils to analyse their own 
difficulties, to detect their own errors, and to understand 
the conditions under which thought goes astray. They 
assist the pupil to maintain a standard of accuracy for 
himself. They lead to a more impersonal attitude 
toward thinking, to a tendency to adopt the scientific 
attitude of distinguishing evidence from prejudice and 
logic from fancy. 
The Study of Scientific Methods.—The methods of 
science, as we observed briefly in Chapter I, are little 
more than an outline of an ideal form of reasoning. 
Indeed, the methods of science were devised precisely 
because individual thinkers and thinking are often prej- 
udiced, untrustworthy, and superficial. As the man of 
science must surround himself at every step with cau- 
tions and checks in order to arrive at the correct con- 
clusion, so the thinker in ordinary matters should exer- 
cise similar precautions. “Scientific thinking” is merely 
careful, critical, safeguarded, systematic thinking. De- 
tailed descriptions of the procedures by which men of 
science have solved their problems and achieved dis- 
coveries, as well as the rules by which their thinking is 
governed, constitute models worthy of emulation. 
The Study of Logic.—Logic is the study of the out- 
lines of representative forms of reasoning. Logic is not 
much concerned with the processes of reasoning, that is, . 
the difficulties of keeping the problem in mind, the 
futile moves, etc. It is concerned with the validity of 
the results reached—whether the solution is justified or
-P-A-G-E-363
346 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
not. Logic is.related to reasoning in somewhat the same 
way that grammar is related to composition. The study 
of grammar will do little to develop skill or style in 
writing, but it will assist in the task of detecting correct 
and incorrect usages and enable the learner to repeat 
the former and avoid the latter. Similarly, logic may 
assist in indicating forms of thought that are valid and 
invalid. 
In logic, samples of reasoning are analysed into their 
elements, which are usually displayed in a simple graph, 
diagram, or short series of sentences. These summaries 
make more apparent various fallacies that were obscure 
when expressed in cumbersome or expansive verbal 
form. The various correct and incorrect forms of reason- 
ing may also be classified in several types. Once an effec- 
tive classification is made, reference and interpretation 
may be facilitated. 
Properly utilized, knowledge of logic—especially of 
the common fallacies in thought—may be of some value 
in developing more valid and rigorous habits. But like 
rules in grammar, rules of logic may be learned quite 
independently of the activities they are supposed to 
assist. One may fail to understand the rules adequately, 
or may forget them, or fail to utilize them, or be unable 
to utilize them. Like other verbal formulations they 
must be introduced during concrete experiences. They 
must be illustrated by and fused with the activities of 
reasoning. . 
Supervised Problem Solving as a Group Activity.— 
The returns for time spent in introducing the facts of 
logic, scientific methods, ilustrations of how eminent 
people solve their problems, and other verbal instruc- 
tions concerning reasoning will at the best be quantita- 
tively small. The slender. improvement thus secured
-P-A-G-E-364
‘ 
REASONING AND PROBLEM SOLVING 347 
will, however, be eminently worth while. Greater 
advances will result from careful supervision, in which 
individual defects and deficiencies. are discovered and 
sagaciously remedied, and in which good habits are 
recognized and rewarded. 
To utilize recitation periods not for the purpose. of 
conducting inquisitions but to stimulate, exercise, and 
improve habits of thinking is one of the most productive 
of modern methods. The social group provides not only 
a situation which brings out certain idiosyncrasies such 
as timidity, extreme caution, hastiness, pugnacity, stub- 
bornness, and tendencies to rationalization or self- 
justification, but it provides the most effective weapon 
—group opinion bluntly or subtly expressed—with 
which to remedy the difficulties found. It is in group 
activity that both the “problem attitude’—that is, the 
tendency to question reasonably, criticise, evaluate, 
explain rather than merely accept — and the “scientific 
attitude’—that is, the tendency to think cautiously, 
thoroughly, systematically and impersonally rather than 
carelessly or with prejudice—may be most adequately 
developed. 
Difficulty vs. Success——The difficulty of problems 
should be carefully adjusted to the capacity of the pupil. 
Problems on the one hand may be too easy to enlist the 
child’s best and livest interests and abilities; on the 
other hand, they may be too difficult, inviting the 
chagiin of failure. There is little interest in the attempt 
to lift a 500-pound weight which means failure, or in 
continuously twiddling one’s thumbs, which is monoto- 
nously easy. Activities that exercise one’s maximum 
abilities, physical or mental, are most useful an 
interesting. 
Of the two defects in the choice of reasoning problems,
-P-A-G-E-365
348 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
the most common is the selection of materials and situa- 
tions that are too difficult. Inventories of achievement 
in problems in arithmetic, geography, civics, and other 
school subjects show too large a percentage of failures. 
In part, this fact has been due to the belief that mere 
difficulty—hard issues, or challenges—are the most 
effective incentives to reason. It has been believed that 
the “problem attitude” is stimulated by great difficul- 
ties, that children enjoy meeting the challenge which a 
hard task presents. What children really like is not 
insurmountable difficulty but the mastery of a real prob- 
lem. They are not so much interested in merely facing a 
difficulty as in successfully overcoming a difficulty. Sue- 
cessful achievement, getting things done, feeling one’s 
power—not annoying lacks and perplexing failures—these 
are the incentives to further accomplishment. 
“As between difficulty and success, success is in the 
long run more productive of thinking. Necessity is not 
the mother of invention. Knowledge of previous inven- 
tions is the mother; original ability is the father. The 
solutions of previous problems are more potent in pro- 
ducing both new problems and their solutions than ‘is 
the mere awareness of problems and desire to have them 
solved.” . “Not getting answers seems as a rule 
to make us stop trying to get them. The annoying lack 
of success with a theoretical problem most often makes 
us desert it for problems to whose solution the existing 
bonds promise to be more adequate.” 1

CHAPTER XV 
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
In the preceding chapters we have considered mainly 
the amount, rate, and limits of improvement and the 
factors which contribute to making the amount great, 
the rate rapid, and the limits high. In this chapter, we 
shall consider the degree to which training in one func- 
tion may contribute to ability in another. This will 
involve several problems which are practically, if not 
theoretically, distinct. Does learning to memorize 
poetry increase one’s ability to memorize prose; or does 
learning to cancel all of the A’s on a page improve one’s 
ability to cancel B’s? In these cases the forms of the 
functions are roughly identical and the data—words in 
one case, letters in the other—are similar. Next, does 
practice in memorizing prose transfer to the ability to 
memorize telephone numbers, names and faces, or musi- 
cal selections? Or does practice in cancelling A’s con- 
tribute to one’s ability to cancel digits, geometrical 
drawings, or other items? In these cases the functions 
are alike in form but the data are quite unlike. These 
questions might be consolidated into a single query, viz., 
Does practice in perceiving, memorizing, or reasoning 
with one type of subject matter improve that mental 
process in general? Can we improve memory, percep- 
tion, imagination, reasoning in all fields by practice in 
one? If the answer to these queries is a positive one, 
it would be proper to ask a still broader question: Can 
353
-P-A-G-E-371
354 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
we improve the mind or intelligence in general by prac- 
tice in memorizing non-sense syllables, perceiving small 
differences in colors, visualizing faces, solving problems 
in arithmetic, or by other forms of practice? Similar 
questions might be asked, such as: Can we improve 
initiative, originality, perseverance, reasonableness, love 
of truth, dependability, or—more broadly—character and 
personality by practice in a specific task? And if so, in 
what tasks, by what kind of practice, and to what 
extent? In considering these questions, we should not 
overlook the possibility of negative transfer. It is pos- 
sible that too much practice in learning prose by rote 
may interfere with learning names and dates, or that 
this practice may have an inhibiting effect on fluent 
reading or on learning “by ideas,” or that it may 
set up habits which impede independent thinking and 
reasoning. 
Tuer Op View or TRANSFER 
The old view, held by specialists in education as well 
as by laymen generally, was that; memory, judgment, dis- 
crimination, observation, reasoning, attention, will, etc., 
were general faculties or powers which operated indis- 
criminately_in all lines or on all kinds of of _material. 
Individuals were said to have good or bad memories, 
judgment, 6 or will; and it was implied that these traits 
were about equally good or bad in all situations~—It-was 
assumed that thesé faculties, powers, or processes could 
be trained as a unit. Indeed, it was the function of the 
school-te-develop memory, reason, judgment, and other 
such desirable traits. It was assumed, furthermore, that 
certain-subj ibjects, such as Greek, Latin, widthematics. and 
formal grammar were especially effective instruments 
for the training of the mind. In the textbooks of twemty- 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 355 
five years ago such quotations as the following were 
frequent: 
The value of studying German “lies in the scientific 
study of the language itself, in the consequent training 
of the reason, of the powers of observation, comparison, 
and synthesis; in short, in the upbuilding and strength- 
ening of the scientific intellect.” : 
“The pursuit of mathematics gives command of atten- 
tion” and results in “the strengthening and training of 
the reasoning powers.” 
“Will-power and attention are educated by physical 
training. When developed by any special act, they are 
developed for all acts.” 
Such views are now considered extravagant—at least 
by those who have followed the experimental studies of 
the transfer of training. The older notions still have an 
appeal, however, a8 is shown by the popularity of the 
widely-advertised systems of training for memory, 
initiative, will, and other traits. 
Tas Errects or Memory TRAINING 
For several decades, including the present one, sys- 
tems of memory training especially have been exten- 
sively utilized. Most of these systems are based on the 
assumption that memory may in general be trained by: 
a period of practice—fifteen minutes or thereabouts a 
‘day for a few weeks—with names, numbers, or other 
types of material. 
In William James’s Principles of Psychology, pub- 
lished in 1890, were given thé results of the first experi- 
mental study conducted to ascertain whether training on 
one kind of material increases ability to memorize 
another kind of material. James memorized in the
-P-A-G-E-373
356 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
course of eight days 158 lines of Victor Hugo’s Satyr, a 
task which required 131.8 minutes. Then, for 38 days 
he spent 20 minutes per day in memorizing passages of 
Milton’s Paradise Lost. Following this practice he again 
memorized 158 lines of the Satyr, finding that it required 
151.5 minutes. Two weeks of practice on one kind of 
poetry had not improved his ability to memorize another 
kind of poetry. A similar experiment was subsequently 
tried by four of James’s students, three of whom were 
slightly more efficient and one slightly less efficient in 
learning material somewhat different from that which 
had been practised. These experiments, while not 
conclusive, are of historical significance since they 
stimulated further experimental study by methods more 
refined. 
Sleight, for example, divided a group of women stu- 
dents, ages 18 and 19, into four subgroups. Group 1, a 
“control” group received no special training; Group 2 
learned from 30 to 60 lines of poetry daily (30 minutes 
a day for 12 days); Group 3 memorized tables, such as 
population data, export and import tables, and foreign 
coinage system 30 minutes a day for 12 days; Group 
4 spent 30 minutes a day for 12 days attempting to learn 
the substance of scientific, historical, or narrative prose 
selections read to them. Just before and just after the 
practice series, the abilities of all four groups were 
measured in the following kinds of learning: 
1. Learning series of names and dates given orally 
2. Learning series of non-sense syllables given 
orally 
3. Memorizing pieces of poetry, read by the experi- 
menter and repeated by the subjects 
4, Memorizing prose, as in (3) verbatim
-P-A-G-E-374

5. Getting the substance of @ prose selection pre- 
sented orally 
6. Memorizing a series of 9 letters read but once 
By comparing the improvement of each of the practice 
groups in each function with that of the control group, 
the transfer of training was measured as shown in the 
accompanying table:

Observe first that each group improved the most in 
learning the material that had been practised. Thus 
Group 2, which practised poetry, exceeds Group 1 (un- 
practised) in improvement in learning poetry by 33; 
Group 3, which practised learning tables, exceeds Group 
1 by 59, and Group 4, which practised prose substance, 
exceeds Group 1 by 52 in that function. 
The influence of training in one type of learning on 
other types is sometimes favorable, sometimes unfavor- 
able. Practice in getting the substance of prose had a 
bad effect upon all other forms of memorizing save the 
“immediate” memory for a series of 9 digits, Practice in

memorizing poetry produces an improvement in learn- 
ing poetry, tables, non-sense, and prose literally, 
but makes it harder to learn prose substance or recall 
letters. Those who practised learning tables were more 
able to learn tables, prose substance, and non-sense, but 
less able to learn poetry, prose verbatim, and recall let- 
ters. Transfer may be positive or it may be negative. 
Practice in one kind of learning may facilitate or it may 
inhibit.other kinds of leatning, within the same general 
field. 
Other investigations of the effects of the training of 
memory for one kind of material have shown a transfer 
of improvement to memorizing other kinds of material 
that is seldom great, usually between five and fifteen 
per cent. Often it is less than five per cent and 
occasionally zero or negative. 
Tur Errmcrs or Trarninc 1n JUDGMENT 
AND PERCEPTION 
One of the earliest experiments on transfer in the 
field of observation and judgment was performed by 
Thorndike and Woodworth in 1903. They found that 
subjects who had practised estimating the areas of 
rectangles of certain sizes (10 to 100 square centimeters) 
until large improvement had been attained, showed only 
about a third as great improvement when slightly larger 
rectangles (150 to 300 sq. cm.) were given, or when the 
areas were kept constant but the shapes changed. These 
investigators also found that a period of training which 
brought about considerable improvement in judging the 
lengths of lines from one-half to one and one-half inches 
in length yielded no increase in ability to estimate lines 
from six to twelve inches long.
-P-A-G-E-376
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 359 
Thorndike and Woodworth found that individuals who 
by practice had markedly increased their ability to pick 
out words containing the letters e and s showed less than 
one-third as much improvement in marking words con- 
taining i and t, s and p, c and a, a and n, or | and o. 
Training in perceiving English verbs gave a reduction 
in time of 21 per cent, but when the same subjects were 
tested in perceiving other parts of speech they showed 
a reduction in time of but 3 per cent and an increase in 
omissions of more than 100 per cent. Another investi- 
gator, Kline, gave nine individuals practice in cancelling 
c's and t’s from 30 to 45 minutes a day for 14 days. 
Before and after the practice, the subjects were tested 
in cancelling nouns, verbs, prepositions, pronouns, and 
adverbs. Eight other individuals, who served as a con- 
trol group, were given the same initial and final tests, 
but received no practice in cancelling c’s and t’s. The 
practice group showed less improvement in cancelling 
nouns, verbs, etc., than the control group. Apparently, 
practice in cancelling letters may cause not an improve- 
ment but a decrease in ability to cancel words of certain 
types. , 
Cenclusiens from Studies of Memory and Perception. 
—In these experiments, the general form of the func- 
tion was kept constant—that is, the subjects were 
trained to judge areas and lengths of lines; or to cancel 
items from the printed page—and the tests were devised 
to see how well the same subjects were able to make the 
same kind or form of response to data, areas, lines, or 
letters which differed slightly or greatly. The signifi- 
cant fact is that when data are used which are but 
slightly different from those on which practice was 
given—as when prose is substituted for poetry, or when 
i and ¢ are substituted for e and s, or when long lines
-P-A-G-E-377
360 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
are substituted for short—the improvement is relatively 
small. When the items are more unlike those used in 
training—as when names and dates are substituted for 
prose, or when verbs and nouns are to be cancelled 
instead of letters—the transfer is very small, often zero 
or negative. : 
One reason for these findings is that memory, observa- 
tion, discrimination, and other processes are not such 
unitary and distinct processes as the use of such terms 
frequently implies. Memorizing, for example, far from 
being a constant process, may involve very diverse ele- 
ments. According to the circumstances, one may 
memorize by merely repeating, mechanically, one item 
after another; by utilizing a number of artificial aids, 
such as positions in the series; or by searching for 
meaningful associations. Memorizing may, in facet, 
range from mechanical articulation of items to an inten- 
sive, analytical attack on the material, which really 
amounts to reasoning. The lines of demarcation be- 
tween the several mental processes are not so obvious 
as they seem. Moreover, there are not, im memory or 
in other processes, convenient and stable units, like 
muscles in the arm, which yield themselves to general 
improvement as the result of exercise of whatever sort. 
These processes are not general faculties or powers which 
may be strengthened as a whole by a specific form of 
exercise. 
The forms of training just reviewed were mainly 
rather narrow in scope. School subjects, such as arith- 
metic, grammar, Latin, or algebra are appreciably wider, 
involving memory in several different forms as well as 
attention, discrimination, judgment, reasoning, and other 
mental processes. It will be practically important to 
ascertain to what degree systematic training in repre-

Tue Errects or TRAINING IN GEOMETRY 
Rugg gave a group of 326 engineers in the freshman 
class at college a series of tests before and after a 
semester’s training in descriptive geometry. The results 
of these tests were compared with those obtained from a 
control group of 87 subjects (72 of whom were in the 
school of education) who did not study descriptive 
geometry, but were given the initial and final tests. 
There were five tests as follows: 
(1) Division; such as “divide eighty-one by seven,” etc. 
(2) Division; such as “divide eight sixty-two by three,” etc. 
(8) Word-building; making as many words as possible from the 
_ letters contained in m-a-t-e-r-i-a-l. 
(4) Painted cube test; a three-inch cube, painted on all sides, is 
cut into one-inch cubes. How many one-inch cubes have 
paint on three sides? On two sides? On one side? On 
no side? 
(5) Test in geometrical thinking: “Form a mental picture of 
each object and count the number of straight lines which 
it would take to construct each one in space.” 1, A 
wedge. 2. Four triangles attached to a square, coincid- 
ing with the sides of the square, etc. 
In test 1 (division) the control group surpassed the 
geometry group in improvement; but by only 1.1 per 
cent. In all other tests, the geometry group exceeded 
the control group, in amounts as follows: in the second 
division test, by 15.8 per cent; in the word building 
test by 19.4; in the cube test by 14 per cent, and in the 
test of geometrical thinking by 48.5 per cent. 
Rugg summarizes the results as follows: “The train- 
ing effect of such study in descriptive geometry operates
-P-A-G-E-379
362 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
more efficiently in those problems whose visual content 
more closely resembles that of the training course itself, 
ie. in those problems whose imagery content is com- 
posed of combinations of points, lines and planes, and 
in which the continuity of the manipulating movements 
approaches the continuity of those in the training 
course.” An important outcome of Rugg’s experiment, 
in harmony with others, was the fact that approximately 
one-third of the engineering group made no improve- 
ment in these tests as a result of the semester’s training 
in geometry. Most of the tests used in this investigation 
were in form or content or both much akin to the fune- 
tions practised in one form or another by engineering 
students. The outcome of the investigation then is a 
demonstration of transfer to functions very similar to 
those directly trained in amounts which vary with the 
degree of similarity between them. 
In an investigation of reasoning in the case of 
mechanical puzzles, Ruger obtained evidence concerning 
the contribution of training in geometry which supple- 
ments Rugg’s investigation in important respects. Ruger 
found, for example, that “geometrical concepts played 
an almost negligible part in the work of solution. This 
was especially true of tri-dimensional puzzles. What was 
needed was ability to construct transformations in three 
dimensions, and the static training in geometry seemed 
at times even to interfere with the dynamic problem. 
The concept of symmetry was of some value, but in the 
main the transfer value of mathematics in so far as 
it appeared seemed to be largely in the form of general 
methods, as that of considering the problem solved and 
working the solution in reverse order. The failure of 
mathematical traming to develop the capacity or 
capacities for dynamic construction was rather striking.”

THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 363 
Tus Errects or Tratninc IN FormaL GRAMMAR 
An experiment by Briggs, on the spread of improve- 
ment from training in formal grammar under school con- 
ditions, affords a good example, because of the variety of 
tests employed, of the degree to which the mind in gen- 
eral is cultivated by systematic education in one line. 
The investigation was planned to test the hypothesis 
that grammar trains children: 
A. With rules and definitions: 
1. To see likenesses and differences. 
2. To critically test a definition. 
3. To thoroughly apply a definition. 
4, To make a rule or definition. 
B. With reasoning: 
5. To test reasons. 
6. a. To take from a mass of data all that are neces- 
sary and to use them in reaching a judgment. 
b. To demand all necessary data before drawing a 
conclusion. 
7. To reason in other fields, e.g., arithmetic. 
8. To reason syllogistically. 
9. To detect “catches.” 
Fifty-four tests were devised to measure, in some form, 
each of these nine abilities, and were given to children in 
each grade from 2 to 7 in the Horace Mann School. Each 
class was then divided into two divisions. Division I, 
three times a week for three months was taught formal 
grammar, while Division II worked on composition and 
language. At the end of the three months’ period, both 
divisions were given a series of tests similar to the first
-P-A-G-E-381
364 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
series, after which Division II was taught grammar for 
three months while Division I studied composition and 
language. At the end of this period the first series of 
tests was again given to all. 
The result may be given in Briggs’ words: “... it 
may safely be asserted that these particular children 
after the amount of formal grammar they had, do not, as 
measured by the means employed, show in any of the 
abilities tested, improvement that ymay be attributed to 
their training in formal grammar.” 
Conclusions.—From these representative experiments, 
there is little evidence that the mind can be greatly 
strengthened by a limited variety of exercises so that it 
becomes much more proficient all around. Not only is 
the mind as a whole not trained as a unit, but a so-called 
mental process, such as memory, attention, perception, 
judgment, diserimination, or reasoning is not evenly or 
generally trained appreciably by a specific form of exer- 
cise on a single kind of data. The training of one form 
of reaction to one class of data frequently does result 
in some improvement in other functions, especially in 
those that are similar in form or content or both, but this 
is not universal, since both zero transfer and negative 
transfer are not uncommonly found in experimental 
studies. 
A Txeory or TRANSFER 
We must now undertake some kind of a general state- 
ment to account for the facts as they have been found. 
What are the factors or conditions that determine the 
kind and amount of transfer? One general formula— 
the theory of identical elements—has been proposed by 
Thorndike,
-P-A-G-E-382
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 365 
“The answer which I shall try to defend is that a 
change in one function alters any other only in so far as 
the two functions have as factors identical elements. The 
change in the second function is in amount that due to 
the change in the elements common to it and the first. 
The change is simply the necessary result upon the sec- 
ond function of the alteration of those of its factors 
which were elements of the first function, and so were 
altered by its training.” 1 
Just what is meant by identical elements? Recall 
that what we learn is a group of minute reactions to a 
complex situation. If a second situation contains ele- 
ments that_activate-some-of-the same reactions, we may 
say that the two situations have identical elements and 
that the amount of transfer from one function to the 
other is proportional fo the amount of identity in the 
reactions produced by them. The acquisition of reac- 
tions to a situation depends, of course, upon the modifi- 
cation of connections in the nervous system, so that 
identical connections in the nervous system are involved 
when, and to the degree that, transfer takes place.

It will be useful to consider in some detail the several 
kinds of identical elements which may appear in two or 
more situations. During practice in memorizing, for ex- 
ample, a subject may learn a variety of methods of attack 
upon the particular subject matter, as lists of 12 non- 
sense syllables. He may learn to use a rhythm such as 
—’~|—’~| which is often a useful device. When he 
changes to the study of lists of words, the general prob- 
lem, 12 items in a list to learn, may call into use the 
2h, L, THornprxe, Educational Psychology, 1903.
-P-A-G-E-383
366 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
rhythmic division of the items. In this case, the use of 
the same rhythm probably would be useful but it might 
be a disadvantage in learning prose or poetry which has 
a different rhythm of its own. Again, the subject may 
hit upon the device of learning by the whole rather than 
the part method, and this may be carried over. He may 
find that searching for peculiar syllables to serve as land- 
marks was profitable and this device may be used on 
other materials, in some cases advantageously, in others 
not. He may find that, in spite of his initial doubts, his 
memory is not so bad, and this feeling of confidence may 
recur whenever any task of memorizing is presented. He 
may actually acquire greater fondness for trying his skill 
in memorizing and this satisfaction may be experienced 
in learning new materials. On the other hand, he may 
acquire habits of using ineffective associations, of dis- 
liking such work, of doubting his capacity to improve, 
and when transferred these habits would interfere with 
achievement on new data. What is carried over, then, 
is not an improved faculty of memory, but new de- 
vices, ideas, attitudes, emotions—in a word, a new tech- 
nique, which may be good or bad in whole or in parts. 
Habits acquired in one type of memorizing, however, 
are by no means invariably carried over. The change 
from non-sense syllables in a list to digits in a row, or 
to isolated names and dates, or to prose and poetry may 
offer so few common elements that the subject starts al- 
most anew to acquire a technique fitting the new 
material. 
Unconscious Transfer of Methods and Movements. 
—Some of the reactions carried over from one function 
to another are not consciously identified or appreciated. 
In memorizing, students are often unaware of just what 
devices they are using, much less of the circumstances
-P-A-G-E-384

| THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 367 
under which they were originally acquired. If one prac- 
tices hand ball for several years before taking up tennis, 
it will probably be found that the ability to follow the 
course of the ball, to estimate bounding, and to make 
many adjustments of the body, carry over advantage- 
ously, while other transferred habits, such as hitting with 
a snap instead of with a swing may be disadvantageous. 
Some of the conditions of the new situation elicit reac- 
tions previously made to identical conditions in old situ- 
ations. In a genuine sense they make the subject react 
as he does without awareness, necessarily, on his part of 
how or why. Similarly, improvement in ability to 
memorize, observe, or reason consists in a large measure 
in the development of a number of little tricks of method 
poorly analysed and poorly understood by the learner, 
but activated by the common elements of the different 
situations. 
The Transfer of Facts or Information.—In the same 
category with specific movements, methods of attack, 
emotional and other attitudes, may be included acquired 
reactions constituting information or subject matter. 
During the study of arithmetic, history, or spelling, one 
may memorize, perceive, and reason; but in addition to 
the training in these processes one acquires informa- 
tion. Facts learned in one situation may transfer like 
other reactions, in the sense that they may be utilized in 
other situations. That knowledge or subject matter is 
subject to transfer in the same way as movements, de- 
vices of learning, and general attitudes, must be made 
clear, since it is frequently assumed that a fact, once 
learned, is of universal application—that it floats freely 
in the mind, ready for use in any situation. 
Suppose, for example, that a child unfamiliar with 
division learns the following tables as they are printed:
-P-A-G-E-385
368 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
2+1= 2 Q9+2=1 8+38=— 1 
A 371= 8 4+2= 6+3= 2 
4+1= 4 6+2= 8 9+ 3= 
5+1= 5 8+2= w2+3= 4 
50 1 = 50 50 - 2 = 25 48 +3 = 16 
  Will the facts of simple division now be available for 
widespread use? No, they certainly will not. Further 
practice must be given in mixed orders, to insure the 
learning of the items independently rather than as lists, 
for example: 
10 
2 
8 
6 
When the pupil has mastered these items, he may be 
unable to solve such problems as the following: B of 
ch 
ee 
whos oO | 
  10 = 5s 
12= 23 
eC 6= 38 
While the same 10-5 = __ete., is involved, the situation 
in general is so different that transfer seldom occurs. 
The child does not recognize these forms as problems in 
division. Specific practice having been given in the 
forms above, will the pupil now be able to compute such 
problems as these? 
D 10 Cents = Nickels. 
25 Cents = Nickels. 
Assuming that he has not previously learned specifi- 
cally to compute with money, many children will not 
make this transfer. Or consider the following: 
E 5 cents pays one car fare. 
15 cents pays car fares, 
45 cents pays car fares, 
F For 5 cents you can buy 1 small loaf of bread. 
For 25 cents you can buy .. small loaves of bread. 
G How many 5¢ balls can you buy with 30¢? 
How many 5¢ balls can you buy with 10¢?
-P-A-G-E-386
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 369 
Experienced teachers know that with the tables per- 
fectly learned, pupils fail to solve such problems as E, F, 
and G. The difficulty is that while the arithmetical 
computations are the same in the several problems, the 
common elements in the situation are so obscured by 
other details that they do not become potent except per- 
haps in the case of a few of the very bright pupils. 
Facts, in arithmetie or other subjects, cannot be ac- 
quired in any one situation in such form as to be gen- 
erally applicable or transferable. A thoroughly “ab- 
stracted” notion of subtraction, or, in other words, 
generally applicable facility, is the outcome of acts of 
identifying and practising subtraction in a wide variety 
of typical situations. To have a general notion of “di- 
vision” means to be able to realize that this, and this, and 
this is a case where one should divide. To have a gen- 
eral appreciation of justice or a triangle is to become 
aware, on facing each relevant situation, that it con- 
tains the abstract element in question. In all of these 
situations we respond to a common, but subtle element. 
Thus the transfer of ideas—particular, general, or ab- 
stract—falls within the concept of identical elements. 
The Transfer of General Attitudes and Ideals—Along 
with movements, methods of attack and information 
which may transfer, are more general adjustments, emo- 
tional, motor, or mental. Tendencies to maintain calm 
or to become nervous, to work rapidly or slowly, to be 
interested or bored, to be self-conscious or absorbed in 
the task—these, acquired in one situation, may be re- 
vived in others by means of common elements. The 
“problem,” “practical,” “scientific,” or “artistic” attitude 
may, indeed, be built up to a very wide applicability. But 
insofar as these tendencies are general, they result from 
widespread experience, from the acquisitions of habits in
-P-A-G-E-387
370 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
each of many fields, and seldom are they, strictly speak- 
ing, universal, as the relative incapacity of most people 
to deal “practically” or “scientifically” with many prob- 
lems outside their own field attests. 
IMPLICATIONS OF THE Facts of TRANSFER 
With the main facts concerning the transfer of training 
before us, how are they to be utilized? What is their 
implication? How are we to secure the most bountiful 
general returns from teaching? Three facts, each sug- 
gesting a line of endeavor, seem to stand out clearly. 
1. Training in methods of memorizing, acquiring 
skills, solving problems, and in maintaining proper 
attitudes is an important task in education, as well 
as the mere accumulation of information and skill. 
2. The mind and character is trained as a whole only 
by being exercised broadly in many representative 
situations. 
3. The fact that transfer is greatest to situations which 
embrace the largest degree of identical elements im- 
plies the need of careful scrutiny of the subject 
matter utilized in education. 
The first two statements have been so frequently illus- 
trated in previous chapters that little remains except 
summary. Great possibilities exist for improving abili- 
ties to learn, to profit by reading, to memorize and to 
solve problems, by definite instruction in effective tech- 
nique. But by instruction more is meant than mere 
verbal directions to attend to details, work systemat- 
ically, use the active “recitation” method, maintain 
calm, verify results, etc. These devices, habits, and 
ideals must not be taught as a special course, but dynam-
-P-A-G-E-388
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 371 
ically fused with the daily work. They should not be 
given as advice, with the hope of widespread application; 
they must be developed into general habits. 
To this end, two requirements must be met. First, 
the methods, habits, and attitudes must be trained not 
in one or a few, but in many situations. It must be rec- 
ognized that each particular task or situation presents its 
particular difficulties and demands specific adjustment, 
and it is only by meeting appropriately many situations 
that general abilities are acquired. Second, in addition 
to providing diversity and wealth of experience, active 
efforts should be made to insure a generalization of the 
desirable methods, facts, ideals and attitudes. They 
should not be allowed to lie imbedded in particular cases. 
They should be identified, emphasized, made conscious, 
and habituated.t 
How much transfer is obtained, then, depends in a 
measure on how we are instructed; on how we are led to 
react and on how well we understand or generalize our 
experience. It depends, in part, also on the character 
of the subject matter with which we work. 
The Choice of Subject Matter.—For two reasons we 
may expect a greater transfer to the activities of daily 
life from subject matter which is itself directly useful in 
situations commonly encountered outside of school. 
First, in order to deal with the situations in life, as we 
saw in the preceding chapter, we need to know the facts 
involved. We cannot solve problems without informa- 
tion any more than we can play a violin or operate a 
typewriter without the specific skills, no matter how in- 
telligent or reasonable we may be. Second, the transfer 
of methods of attack, interest, poise, devices of learning 
or reasoning, habits or ideals of caution, accuracy, thor- 
* By such methods as have been discussed in Chapter XIII.
-P-A-G-E-389
372 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
oughness, or initiative to the situations in life will be 
great to the degree that the subject matter of the class- 
room is identical with that used in the situations which 
life itself offers. We should, then, other things being 
equal, prefer genuine life issues and widely usable facts 
rather than unreal and fantastic problems, or trivial, 
unusual, or academic facts. In arithmetic, for example, 
we should present real problems demanding solutions 
by the most expeditious and generally practicable 
methods—rather than problems such as the following, 
which are preposterous in the facts and misleading in 
the methods of attack upon real issues which they 
suggest. 
“Alice has 3/8 of a dollar, Bertha 11/16, Mary 3/25 and Nan 3/4. 
How much have they together? 
“There aré 9 nuts in a pint. How many pints in a pile of 6,789,- 
582 nuts? 
“Suppose a pie to be exactly round and 10 1/2 miles in diameter. 
If it were cut into 6 equal pieces, how long would the curved edge 
of each piece be? 
“Such problems would occur in real life only in an 
insane asylum. 
“Consider this clever way of finding the thickness of a 
board: 
“A nail 5 inches long is driven through a board so that it pro- 
jects 2.419 inches on one side and 1.706 on the other. How thick 
is the board? 
“Consider the thoroughness of this horse in eating ex- 
actly 16 ounces of hay: | 
“Just after a ton of hay was weighed in market a horse ate 1 Jb. 
of it. What was the ratio of what he ate to what was left? 
“Consider the perfectly fantastic and futile nature of 
these problems for a problem’s sake:
-P-A-G-E-390
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 373 
“A man 6 feet high weighs 175 pounds. How tall is his wife 
who weighs 125 pounds and is of similar build? 
“Four bells toll at intervals of 3, 7, 12, and 14 seconds respec- 
tively, and begin to toll at the same instant. When will they next 
toll together ?” t 
Problems which represent real and worthy situations 
and demand the most sensible and expeditious solutions 
not only increase respect for and interest in arithmetic 
but develop information and skill more adequately and 
make provision for more useful and wider applicability. 
There remains the possibility that certain subjects 
whose contents as such are not widely used in life never- 
theless deserve consideration because the kind of activi- 
ties demanded offer exceptionally effective opportunities 
for training and disciplining mind and character. Thus 
it might be urged that football offers exceptional oppor- 
tunities for the development of courage and sportsman- 
ship, that geometry by the rigidity of its proofs leads to 
better habits of thought, that Latin because of its diffi- 
culty schools concentration and persistence. In each case 
of this type we must be sure that the subject does train 
even specifically the habits alleged; we must also ascertain 
possible outcomes, such as distaste for school work, which 
may also be developed. Finally, we must consider in just 
what degree habits developed in the subject do actually 
transfer to others, and recall that insofar as the content 
is unrelated to life, transfer will be relatively small. 
In conclusion, it should be urged that the facts of 
transfer do not imply that better methods of accomplish- 
ing intellectual tasks, or greater zeal, initiative, trust- 
worthiness, and control cannot be developed. On the 
contrary, they indicate the ways in which desirable ad- 
justments to life may be more surely secured.

QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. Do you remember any doctrines presented in preceding 
chapters which seem to be contradictory to the views of the 
present chapter on transfer? 
2. “Skim” the contents of chapters XII, XIII, and XIV, pick- 
ing out the sections which have a definite relation to transfer. 
3. If one spoke English until 10 years old, then spoke only 
German for 10 years, would the ability to speak English decrease 
more or less than if one had not spoken at all? 
4, A woman aged 80 and her daughter aged 6 came to the 
United States from France. Why, after two years of practice, 
does the daughter speak more perfect English (meaning here 
merely accuracy of articulation) than the mother? If both had 
secured the same training during the two years, which would 
probably have developed the larger English vocabulary (knowl- 
edge of meaning of words)? Explain. 
5. Give other samples of reorganization of bonds, use of old 
bonds in new functions, and the formation of bonds which may 
either facilitate or inhibit the old, during periods of no practice. 
6. Reread the description of Voelker’s experiment on trust- 
worthiness in Chapter XIII. How do the results of that study 
bear on the problem of transfer? 
7, William James, in his chapter on Habit, wrote: “As a final 
practical maxim, relative to these habits of will, we may, then, 
offer something like this: Keep the faculty of effort alive in you 
by a little gratwitous exercise every day. That is, be systemati- 
cally ascetic and heroic in little unnecessary points, do every day 
or two something for no other reason than that you would rather 
not do it, and so, when the hour of dire need draws nigh, it 
may find you not unnerved and untrained to stand the test.” 
Examine this statement critically and determine what the con- 
ditions would have to be for it to agree with the doctrine given 
in the text. : : 
8. Would the Law of Effect have any bearing on James’s state- 
ment? Would the implication of that statement be that subjects 
should be introduced into the curriculum just because they are 
difficult or distasteful ? 
9. Compare the implication of James’s statement with the fol- 
lowing by Thorndike: “To study the distasteful that is known to
-P-A-G-E-392
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 375 
be useful is of much greater disciplinary value than to study the 
merely distasteful. The habit of value is to suffer that good may 
come, not to suffer wastefully. It is in sacrificing for a greater 
good, not in mere sacrificing, that the mind gains. To suffer 
simply so as to stand suffering would be as foolish as to learn 
falsehoods go as to be able to unlearn them.” 
10. How do you suppose Thorndike would justify this state- 
ment: “The greatest disciplinary value of Latin would appear 
in the case, not of those who disliked it and found it hard, but of 
those to whom it was a charming game”? 
11. Can you think of any mental process or trait of character 
which cannot be exercised with any but useless facts or situations? 
12, Collect some statements from books on education, general 
reading, or advertisements which are based on erroneous notions 
of transfer. 
18. Suppose it were found in a certain secondary school that the 
students who had studied geometry were better in reasoning in 
general than those who had not. Would you consider this satis- 
factory evidence that training in geometry was responsible for the 
greater ability in general ? ' 
14. Do you think some teachers secure a greater amount of trans- 
fer among their pupils than others do? How? 
15. Show in detail how the training received in (a) athletic 
games, (b) grammar, and (c) psychology may be made to function 
in everyday life. 
16. What reactions acquired in playing the piano would transfer 
to typewriting? To singing? What negative transfer might take 
place? 
17. On the basis of the general value of studies, what changes 
would you recommend in the curriculum of the high school from 
which you graduated ? 
18. Will reading good literature contribute to your ability to 
write? To get the greatest transfer just how should you read? 
19. How would you train a child to meet emergencies (as in 
cases of fire, accidents, drowning, etc.)? To what degree will 
mere knowledge of what to do function in face of an emergency? 
20. What subjects are especially useful to develop general open- 
mindedness or freedom from prejudice and superstition?

CHAPTER XVI 
THE INFLUENCE OF CONTINUOUS WORK, 
EXTERNAL CONDITIONS, AND DRUGS 
UPON EFFICIENCY 
In this chapter, some of the results of experimental 
studies on the influence of work, external conditions and 
drugs, on efficiency and improvement will be given, with 
little attempt to account in detail for the causes of the 
effects observed. In most instances the detailed ways in 
which the effects are brought about are not known, and 
even when they are known, descriptions of the causations 
are more complex than is necessary for our purposes. 
Tue INFLUENCE oF Work AND ExrernaL ConpITIons 
Continuous Muscular Work.—The effect of continuous 
work in a function upon efficiency in it, as measured by 
the amount and quality of the product (words written, 
facts learned, etc.), varies considerably with the function. 
In the case of hard muscular work the fall in efficiency 
is rather steady and pronounced. Figure 38 shows the 
relative distances through which the middle finger pulls 
a load of about six and a half pounds making a pull 
every two seconds. The muscle soon is incapable of lift- 
ing the load although it is not entirely exhausted as is 
shown by the fact that it can still lift smaller weights. 
A rest of about two hours would be required before the 
muscle could repeat the original performance. If suffi- 
cient rest is given between the contractions, the muscle 
377 |
-P-A-G-E-395
378 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
will lift the load a much greater number of times. If a 
muscle in some other part of the body, the other arm, 
for example, is working at the same time, the finger loses 
its strength more rapidly possibly because of the fatigue 
products circulating in the blood. Loss of sleep or food, 
and doses of alcohol and certain other drugs, decrease the 
  Ficure 38. The vertical lines indicate the relative distances through 
which a weight of 6%4 pounds is pulled by the middle finger of the 
right hand. Contractions were made at intervals of two seconds. 
(From Howell’s, A Textbook of Physiology, 5th Edition, p. 48.) 
efficiency of the muscle, whereas sugar, adrenalin, and 
certain other chemicals increase efficiency. 
Muscular work of this sort uses up definite materials 
such as glycogen and develops by-products such as carbon. 
dioxide, which together reduce the capacity to function. 
Unpleasant sensations, pain, or so-called “feelings of fa- 
tigue” are also produced, along with definite impulsions 
to cease the work.
-P-A-G-E-396
THE INFLUENCE UPON EFFICIENCY 379 
Continuous Work of the Neurones.—The effect of 
continuous work by isolated neurones may be observed 
experimentally. One method employed is to dissect from 
a freshly killed frog a large muscle with a long motor 
nerve (bundle of motor neurones) attached. Such a 
“nerve muscle preparation” can be kept alive for a long 
time. If the stump of the nerve is stimulated by an 
electric shock, the nervous impulse thus occasioned dis- 
charges into the muscle and causes a contraction. If 
contractions are provoked rapidly, the muscle soon fails 
to respond. Whether the loss of capacity is due to fa- 
tigue of the nerve or to fatigue of the muscle may be 
determined by an experiment. If a bit of the drug 
curari is placed on the nerve near the muscle, the nerve 
impulse is blocked at that point so that it fails to activate 
the muscle. It has been found, however, that the im- 
pulse passes along the nerve, as far as the point at which 
the drug is applied, i.e, that the neurones are conducting 
as under ordinary circumstances. Investigators have 
found that even when the nerve is stimulated several 
times per second for ten hours or more, removal of the 
effects of curari results in the renewal of the muscular 
contractions upon stimulation of the nerve, thus demon- 
strating an extraordinary resistance to “fatigue” on the 
part of nerves as compared to the fatigability of 
rmauscles. 
Continuous Mental Work—Mental work usually in- 
volves the activity of muscles as well as neurones of the 
central nervous system. In reading, the muscles of the 
eyes, at least, are engaged; in writing compositions and in 
arithmetic, the muscles of the eyes, hands, and arms are 
active. Even in “mental” arithmetic, spelling, or ordi- 
nary thinking, muscles of the eyes, the vocal organs, and 
probably other parts of the body are involved to some
-P-A-G-E-397
380 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
extent. And in all types of mental work, the mainte- 
nance of the body’s position depends upon muscular ad- 
justments. Thus, what we call “mental fatigue” is in 
part the result of muscular work and identical with 
muscular fatigue. 
When one has been working continuously at spelling, 
arithmetic, reading, composition, or some other mental 
task, he may become aware of a group of sensations 
which technically have been called “feelings of fatigue,” 
usually unpleasant in character. Feelings of fatigue are, 
in a large measure, sensations from muscles, tendons, and 
joints, and include feeling of numbness, aches, and pains 
from the eyes, head, back, and other parts of the body. 
With these are fused other sensations derived from vis- 
ceral, arterial, and other organic conditions. The whole 
constitutes the familiar feeling of fatigue which is ordi- 
narily accompanied by impulses to stop working. If the 
work is continued it becomes tedious, unpleasant, or 
aggravating. 
The progressive course of feelings of fatigue and an- 
noyance produced by continued work is pictured roughly 
in Figure 39, which is based upon the judgments of a 
group of adults obtained during four hours of continuous 
work in grading English composition. Highly interest- 
ing at the beginning, the work became progressively less 
pleasant, until at the end of the fourth hour it was clearly 
distasteful. 
Feelings of fatigue and loss of interest are commonly 
accepted by workers as indicative, at least approxi- 
mately, of a decreased state of efficiency. But that these 
symptoms are extremely misleading has been found re- 
peatedly when the quantity and quality of the output 
has been measured during periods of continuous work. 
In Figure 39, the distastefulness of the work in the case
-P-A-G-E-398
THE INFLUENCE UPON EFFICIENCY 38) 
of grading compositions, for four hours continuously, is 
plotted together with the output. The loss of ability is 
not nearly as great as the loss of satisfaction in the work. 
Many investigations of continuous mental work have 
yielded similar results. Two or three hours of continu- 
ous work at maximum effort produces a temporary de- 
crease in the product of not over ten per cent, and in 
most functions less than that. By a temporary decrease

Hours of Work 
Fiaure_39._ Curve A shows the rapid loss of zeal or interest in 
grading English compositions during a period of 4 hours. The curve 
is an average for 5 subjects. Curve B shows the loss in efficiency, 
represented by a combined score for speed and quality of work, during 
the same time by the same subjects. The greatest loss (near the end) 
is about 7 per cent. (Modified after Thorndike.) 
is meant one which is curable by a rest of an hour or 
less. Of course, the curve of work is marked by all sorts 
of fluctuations, some of them peculiar to particular in- 
dividuals, and efficiency may drop more decidedly if the 
worker eases up. But on the whole, continuous work in 
mental functions shows a small loss in output as com- 
pared to that found in continuous muscular work. If we 
make mental work as difficult as we can, taking for our 
task the mental multiplication of such numbers as 8372
-P-A-G-E-399
382 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
and 3458, for example, we find that, as demonstrated by 
one experimenter, it is possible to keep it up for 12 hours 
atastretch. The result of long continued difficult mental 
work is thus in sharp contrast to the effect of hard phys- 
ical work. While feelings of physical fatigue may be fair 
indices of physical capacity, they yield by no means re- 
liable evidence of mental efficiency. 
So far as mere loss of efficiency is concerned, there is 
little to urge against long continued work of the same 
sort. But what of other effects? Too lengthy applica- 
tion to a task may make the work uninteresting, or posi- 
tively repugnant. When the work becomes distasteful 
or exasperating, it probably indicates an unfavorable 
organic stirring-up somewhat similar to that observed 
under emotional irritation or excitement. This general 
state is indicative of a considerable organic wear and 
tear which may become injurious if long continued. But 
it is the repugnance, exasperation, excitement, or worry 
produced by mental work rather than the work itself 
which is harmful. If one can school himself to maintain 
interest and enjoyment in the task, the ill-effects of long 
and hard mental work may be tremendously reduced. 
There are, of course, limits to the amount of mental work 
one may safely do because of the muscular fatigue and 
the deprivations of recreations, exercise, rest, and sleep 
which too persistent work may bring. Just how long a 
person may safely do mental work depends partly upon 
his general strength and stability, partly upon his sus- 
ceptibility to excitement and worry, and partly upon his 
interest. In school practice, short periods and frequent 
changes of work are advisable, not mainly because they 
are needed to secure improvement, but because they 
make school life more interesting through variety. 
The “feelings of fatigue” are in part, if not mainly,

the results of muscular activity and strain. Much may 
be done to lessen unnecessary and often damaging fa- 
tigue, particularly of eye and hand. For example, the 
task of copying problems to be computed in arithmetic, 
poems to be memorized, ete., is not only harder work, 
minute for minute, than computing or memorizing, but 
much more monotonous. It is, moreover, as unnecessary 
as it is fatiguing. Less worry about the disastrous ef- 
fects of “mental fatigue” and more attention to muscular 
fatigue of eyes, hands and the body is one suggestion 
which the experimental studies of mental work have to 
offer, 
The Course of Efficiency During the School Day.— 
Under the conditions of an ordinary school day, what is 
the relative efficiency in mental and motor performances 
at different hours? In one investigation, the pupils of 
several grades were repeatedly tested in representative 
tasks at different periods until the accumulated results 
gave a fairly accurate measure of achievements resulting 
from maximum effort at different hours of the day. The 
results are given in the table on the following page. 
In the more strictly mental functions such as addition, 
multiplication, visual and auditory memory, recognition 
and completion, efficiency is lowest in the first and high- 
est in the last morning period. A slight drop follows 
the lunch period with a subsequent rise between two and 
three o’clock. Other investigations have shown a very 
similar distribution of efficiency for gross bodily func- 
tions, such as shoveling and lifting. Efficiency in motor 
skills, such as cancellation and tracing, is somewhat 
greater in the afternoon than in the forenqon. 
Similar average results were obtained from a group of 
college students tested at all hours, except noon, from 
eight Am. to five p.m. An interesting feature of this

investigation was the disagreement between the distri- 
bution of actual ability and the distribution of self- 
judged ability. Most students were quite mistaken 
about the hours of their maximum efficiency, doubtless 
because they were misled by feelings of fatigue which 
were often most acute at the periods of highest efficiency. 
One thing is quite certain: the ordinary work of the 
school day is not so severe as to reduce efficiency per- 
ceptibly. In fact, achievement is higher at nearly every 
hour than it is at the beginning of the day. In the main, 
the differences are small. Aside from the suggestion that 
such functions as writing, drawing, or other light work
-P-A-G-E-402
’ THE INFLUENCE UPON EFFICIENCY 385 
requiring speed and accuracy of movement might well 
be given in the first afternoon period, it would appear 
to make little difference when reading, arithmetic, and 
other studies are conducted. 
“Bad Air.”—It is popularly believed that in poorly ven- 
tilated rooms, carbon-dioxide and other toxins from ex- 
pired air result in drowsiness, lassitude, headaches, and 
loss of efficiency. Pure air contains about 21 per cent 
of oxygen, 78 per cent of nitrogen, and 0.03 per cent of 
carbon-dioxide. In a very crowded and ill-ventilated 
school room the carbon-dioxide may be increased to 0.3 
per cent. and the oxygen decreased to 19 per cent., but 
these changes are insufficient to produce the effects or- 
dinarily observed. When the air is cool, of favorable 
humidity, and in movement, the oxygen content must be 
reduced to at least 14 per cent. or the carbon-dioxide in- 
creased to 2.4 per cent. before ill effects are produced. 
When the air is hot and of unfavorable humidity, the ill 
effects are not relieved by breathing pure air through a 
tube from the outside. High temperature or humidity, 
or both, then, rather than low oxygen content and expired 
matter, seem to be the causes of discomfort. 
Temperature and Humidity.—The influence of stale 
air, high and low temperature and humidity in various 
combinations has been studied by Thorndike and several 
psychologists working under the auspices of the New 
York State Commission on Ventilation. 
It was found that adult subjects when urged to do 
their best could perform quite well and improved in effi- 
ciency quite as much when working in hot, humid, stale, 
and stagnant air (temperature 86° Fahrenheit, humidity 
80 per cent, with no fresh air and no movement in the 
air) as when they were working under “optimum” con- 
ditions—namely, a temperature of 68° Fahrenheit, 50
-P-A-G-E-403
386 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
per cent relative humidity and 45 cubic feet of outside 
air each minute for each person. It was furthermore 
found that when the subjects were given very uninter- 
esting work and were given no incentives to do well but 
were, on the contrary, tempted to relax standards, they 
still did as much and as well when working eight hours 
a day in the hot, humid, and stale air as when working 
under optimum conditions. Finally, when individuals 
were given their choice of doing mental work, reading 
stories, resting, talking or sleeping, they did quite as 
much work when the temperature was 75° as when it 
was milder, 68° Fahrenheit. 
The influence of extremely low humidity, with temper- 
ature kept constant at 75° Fahrenheit was found by 
Stecher to have no perceptible effects upon efficiency or 
improvability. A squad practising arithmetic, typewrit- 
ing, and other functions during the regular working day 
with the humidity reduced to 20 per cent. improved as 
rapidly as a squad working under the “ideal” degree of 
humidity, 50 per cent. 
The atmospheric conditions which are encountered in 
ordinary life, then, however uncomfortable some of them 
may be, have no appreciable effect upon efficiency in 
performance, or on improvement in mental and light 
motor work. Whether Jong continued exposure to very 
hot, very moist, or dry air would occasion a good deal of 
wear and tear on the body or injure health, is another 
problem not as yet solved. The results of the psycho- 
logical investigations indicate merely that if one must 
face severe atmospheric conditions, as in mid-summer, 
one had best do so cheerfully, as it is unlikely to be too 
hot to make mental work unprofitable. If one will, one 
can learn as well when it is hot as when it is cool, when it 
is moist or dry, as when the humidity is moderate.
-P-A-G-E-404
THE INFLUENCE UPON EFFICIENCY 387 
The experimental studies have a bearing on the peren- 
nial topic of the effects of weather and climate_upon 
human feelings and efficiency. That human beings do 
become adapted rapidly to the most forbidding climatic 
conditions of the globe is not surprising in the light of 
experimental studies in which adjustments are effectively 
made to abrupt and extreme changes in humidity, tem- 
perature, and staleness. While climate and weather in- 
cludes in addition to these factors others such as density 
of the atmosphere, light, and possibly electrical condi- 
tions, the probability is that adaptation to _ these is 
equally facile. 
Illumination and Color.—The most essential feature 
of favorable illumination is an evenness of distribution 
of light, especially the absence of glare, or contrast, in 
the field of view. Artificial or window light should 
therefore come from above, behind, or at the sides. Con- 
trasts in walls and hangings, glistening paper, or polished 
instruments contribute to eye fatigue. A second desir- 
able feature is illumination of moderate intensity. Lights 
are more often too bright than too dim. Particularly 
unfavorable intensities and brightnesses are often pro- 
duced by the use of high power electric lights. A soft 
even light from indirect or semi-indirect systems is most 
satisfactory. 
There are many opinions concerning the effects of 
colors of lights or surroundings on efficiency, disposition 
and health, but the findings of experimental investiga- 
tions have been mainly negative. The most significant 
difference between light from an uncolored globe and 
light from a colored globe is that the colored light is less 
intense—the colored glass absorbs some of the rays. 
Some have found that the more intense light is more 
stimulating, but the difference is small. What little is
-P-A-G-E-405
388 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
gained by means of the stimulating effect of intense light 
is probably more than compensated for by its fatiguing 
effect upon the eyes. Colored glasses are restful only 
because they reduce light intensity. It makes little dif- 
ference what particular colors are used. 
Auditory Distractions.—Just as the organism becomes 
adapted to wide differences in light or temperature, so it 
becomes adapted to persistent sounds of the street, con- 
versation, rattling of typewriters, or the roar of machin- 
ery. When adults are well adapted to a working condi- 
tion, new distractions are apparently at first disturbing, 
although they have little effects on the output. Experi- 
ments conducted in the laboratory indicate that when a 
subject is well adapted to a working condition, the intro- 
duction of a new disturbance causes but a slight and tem- 
porary decrease in efficiency, although it may be decidedly 
annoying. The subject soon arouses himself to over- 
come or adjust to the noise. His output is then kept up to 
the norm, often actually surpassing it, but in so doing 
more than ordinary energy is consumed. He may pound 
the typewriter keys harder, grit his teeth, articulate, and 
contract various muscles. These superfluous activities 
drop out gradually as adjustment is perfected, just as ir- 
relevant reactions tend to be eliminated in all forms of 
trial-and-error learning. The general rule seems to be 
that when a new disturbance is encountered, the worker 
sets about to acquire by trial and error an adaptive re- 
action to it and succeeds in so doing without appreciable 
deterioration of his output during the process. 
General Conclusions.—Other types. of experimental 
evidence on the remarkable capacity of the organism to 
adapt itself to unusual conditions have been obtained. 
For example, students during periods of from 30 to 48 
hours without sleep, although subject to pronounced
-P-A-G-E-406
THE INFLUENCE UPON EFFICIENCY 389 
“feelings of fatigue” and other uncomfortable symptoms, 
were nevertheless able to perform mentally as efficiently 
and learn as effectively as under ordinary conditions. 
During a fast of 31 days, a man studied by Langfeld 
showed no appreciable loss of mental efficiency and abil- 
ity to learn, although the decrease of bodily weight and 
strength was great. 
Some of these adaptive reactions—to heat, cold, low 
humidity, continuous work, loss of food—appear to be 
directly instinctive; that is, they are carried out as in the 
case of the infant, by adjustments inborn rather than 
learned. The adaptations to new noises, or visual dis- 
tractions, while involving instinctive acts, are neverthe- 
less, in a genuine sense, acquired. The process of over- 
coming an auditory distraction affords, as we have said, 
a beautiful example of the trial-and-error learning in 
which elimination and selection continues until the ad- 
jJustment becomes easy, smooth, and nearly unnoticed. 
That these adaptations are, however, really active ad- 
justments is indicated by the fact that when the stimu- 
lus, to which an individual is adapted so completely 
that it is unnoticed, is removed, he becomes aware of the 
change and must make another adjustment to the re- 
arranged conditions. Thus, when one is adapted to a 
certain rattle or roar in his working environment, re- 
moval of the sound may be temporarily disturbing, al- 
though readjustment is shortly achieved. 
The “emergency mechanism,” innervated by the sym- 
pathetic system described in Chapter VIII, may be and 
doubtless is frequently brought into action under the 
stimulus of high temperature, noise, and other unusual 
conditions. In some cases, these profound internal 
changes may be serviceable; in others, not. It is quite 
characteristic of compensatory reactions to go too far,
-P-A-G-E-407
390 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
The subtle processes of our inner mechanisms in repair- 
ing wounds, enclosing bacteria, etc., frequently so overdo 
the task as to cause greater ills than they remedy, as 
every surgeon knows. Similarly the sympathetic system, 
which doubtless often becomes active, may bring about 
its disruptive effects during adjustment to external condi- 
tions. The sympathetic system is, to some extent, how- 
ever, subject to voluntary control. To develop habits of 
remaining calm even if we must work occasionally under 
trying conditions is plainly a desirable thing todo. Bet- 
ter to work than worry, and to become interested in work 
is one of the best ways of avoiding worry and excitement. 
Tue INFLUENCE or Drucs 
Caffeine.—Caffeine is the active drug in tea, coffee, and 
many soda-fountain drinks. An average cup of hot 
black tea contains 1.5 grains; an after-dinner coffee about 
the same; an average glass of cold green tea about 2.0 
grains; and a large cup of coffee about 2.5 grains. 
Employing a squad of 16 subjects whose food, sleep, 
rest, and work was controlled during an experiment which 
extended over 40 days, Hollingworth measured the influ- 
ence of doses of caffeine ranging from two to six grains 
upon various mental and motor functions. The effects 
of suggestion and anticipation were eliminated by ad- 
ministering the drug in disguise. At uniform intervals 
‘the subjects were given a mixture which sometimes con- 
tained and at other times did not contain the caffeine. 
The effect of a dose of caffeine appears usually within 
an hour and lasts for several hours, depending on the size 
of the dose. This substance usually produces a decrease 
in muscular steadiness with tremors, which appears more 
quickly and lasts longer with larger doses. In typewrit- 
ing, greater accuracy results from using the drug, while
-P-A-G-E-408
i * 
THE INFLUENCE WeOn EFFICEE CY 391 
speed is also increased except by large doses, which re- 
duce the rate of writing. In more purely mental work— 
naming the opposites of words, naming colors, adding, 
etc.—efficiency was increased by doses of all sizes for pe- 
riods varying from three to seven hours. In the task of 
crossing out certain numbers from rows of mixed num- 
bers doses of four grains or more produced improvement 
in ability which sometimes persisted for nearly 24 hours. 
The stimulating effect of the drug was indicated by the 
fact that a dose of six grains disturbed the sleep of most 
subjects, and on some much smaller doses had a similar 
effect. The stimulating influences of caffeine, contrary 
to general opinion, is not followed by a subsequent period 
of depression, at least not within 72 hours. 
It should be understood that tea, coffee, and other 
caffeinic beverages contain other substances which may 
enhance or neutralize the effects of caffeine or produce 
still other effects, good or bad. What influence the long 
continued use of this drug may have on the body 
is not known, but during a period of 40 days, insofar 
as integrity and proficiency in mental work are con- 
cerned, caffeine has distinctly an accelerating effect 
without any observable harmful results. 
Tobacco Smoking.—No unquestionable evidence of 
the influence of tobacco smoking on efficiency in and im- 
provement during work has as yet been published, for 
the reason that a perfect control has not been devised. 
If habitual smokers are used as subjects, the mere dep- 
rivation of the exercise of the habit may disturb their 
attitude toward work. If subjects unaccustomed to 
smoking are used, the effects of tobacco will be obviously 
not typical of the average smoker. Statistics gathered 
concerning groups of smokers and non-smokers are inter- 
esting but worthless, because the groups may differ in
-P-A-G-E-409
392 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
many other habits as well as in the use of the tobacco. 
The facts can be secured only by trying out various 
groups of subjects, who are compared with similar groups 
not exposed to the experimental factor. If we are in- 
terested in the effect of tobacco alone, it is essential that 
the subject should not know when he is really getting 
tobacco and when he is getting something else, since the 
mere idea of smoking, the pleasure of the act, or the 
stimulation provided by the sight, taste, and smell, may 
produce the result rather than the drug itself. 
These conditions have as yet not been faithfully ful- 
filled in the case of tobacco, although a good many less 
adequate investigations have been made. The outcome 
has been fairly consistent, indicating a deleterious effect 
both on mental and motor achievement, in complex 
functions at least. 
A sample result is given in the accompanying table. 
Fifteen smokers were given a test, following which they 
smoked quietly for 15 minutes, and then took the test 
again, Two non-smokers served as controls, taking the 
tests at the same time, one smoking supposedly harmless 
“eubebs,” the other not smoking at all. The gains, in- 
dicated by ++, and losses, indicated by —, are shown in 
percentages in the table.

| THE INFLUENCE UPON EFFICIENCY 393 
If the results are typical, the adult must pay the price 
for indulgence in smoking by some loss in achievement. 
Concerning the effects of tobacco upon general health, 
there are opinions in abundance, but no reliable evidence. 
Alcohol.—The influence of alcohol, administered in its 
pure form diluted with water or beverages, upon efficiency 
in various mental and motor functions has been investi- 
gated on several occasions with results which agree in the 
main. An English psychologist, Rivers, was the first to 
disguise the alcohol properly so that the subject was un- 
able to tell by look, taste, or smell whether the mixture 
contained alcohol or another harmless substance. Rivers 
employed tests mainly of muscular efficiency, strength, 
and endurance, upon which little effect was produced ex- 
cept by large doses of alcohol. Effects found in earlier 
investigations were attributed to sensory stimulation 
. (tastes, odors, sting) or to expectation of improvement 
rather than to the drug itself. 
Dodge and Benedict, during extensive and carefully 
controlled investigations in the Nutrition Laboratory of 
the Carnegie Institute, found that alcohol had not a 
stimulating but a depressing effect upon mental and 
motor efficiency. To this statement there was one ex- 
ception—the pulse was accelerated, which was sympto- 
matic, perhaps, of internal resistance to the drug. In 
the case of several functions, the losses of efficiency which 
resulted from doses of 30 and 45 cubic centimeters of 
alcohol—the results for doses of both sizes combined— 
were as follows: 
Knee-jerk: decrease in extent of muscle contraction.. 46 per cent 
Knee-jerk: increase in time of reaction............. 10 percent 
Protective eye-lid reflex: decrease in extent.......... 19 per cent 
Protective eye-lid reflex: increase in time.......... 7 per cent

  Speed of eye movements: decreased... .....+. 0. eeeee 11 per cent 
Speed of tapping, with hand: decreased 9 per cent 
Speed of reading isolated words: decreased.......... 3 per cent 
In all tests, the effect of alcohol is to reduce functional 
capacity, and this is strikingly true of the simple pro- 
tective reflex activities which become more sluggish in 
rate and less effective in extent. No representative tests 
of mental efficiency were employed by these workers. 
The influence of alcohol on both motor and mental 
functions has been recently investigated by Hollingworth. 
The alcohol dosage was administered in the form of beer 
which was 2.75 per cent. alcohol by weight. Six trials of 
each test were given during the forenoon. At noon the 
beer was given with a small amount of food. On certain 
days beer was given which was identical in all respects 
with the genuine except that the alcohol had been re-~ 
moved, thus providing a control. During the afternoon, 
six trials of each test were again given. In the accom- 
panying table, the gains and losses of efficiency due 
specifically to alcohol are given in terms of percentages.

The loss of efficiency due to alcohol is universal and 
pronounced among the functions tested, with the excep- 
tion of the rise in pulse rate. Co6rdination of motor 
control and speed of tapping are appreciably reduced; 
steadiness is more markedly disturbed. For all of these
-P-A-G-E-412
THE INFLUENCE UPON EFFICIENCY. 395 
motor functions, the effect of the large dose is greater 
than that of the small. On mental efficiency, the drug 
has a similar disastrous effect, similarly proportionate to 
the size of the dose. 
The singular rise in pulse rate, which was also observed 
by Dodge and Benedict, is probably a symptom of the 
arousal of internal mechanisms to combat the damaging 
effects of the drug. In support of this hypothesis was 
the finding that those subjects whose mental and. motor 
control were least influenced by the drug showed the 
greatest increase in pulse rate; those most disturbed 
showed the slightest increase in pulse rate. 
Other Drugs.—Strychnine in fairly large doses (1/15 
to 3/15 grains) seems to lead to a temporary increase in 
ability to run a complex machine (dotting machine) and 
in capacity to memorize, often followed by a decrease to 
less than normal capacity unless the dose is repeated. 
Very small doses, 1/30 to 1/20 grain, according to Pof- 
fenberger, produce negligible results on speed of tapping, 
aiming, and a wide variety of mental functions. Opium 
and morphine appear to cause an initial stimulation 
which appears slowly and rises to a maximum, and then 
efficiency descends below—-sometimes considerably below 
—normal. Cocaine causes a large immediate stimula- 
tion followed by a period of pronounced depression, Be- 
cause of its immediately stimulating effects it has become 
a great favorite among drug addicts. 
Conclusions 
The experiments here given disclose only the immedi- 
ate effects of external conditions and drugs. It would be 
unsafe to conclude that influences showing great imme- 
diate effects upon mental efficiency and skill would have 
@ corresponding serious effect upon general health or
-P-A-G-E-413
396 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
upon particular bodily functions and organs when used 
continuously. It would be likewise unsafe to conclude 
that influences whose immediate effects are slight or zero 
would produce, when continuously used, no general or 
specific ill results. To determine the outcome of the 
habitual use of drugs or of habitual exposure to unusual 
environmental conditions constitutes another and more 
difficult problem. Of no mean importance, however, is 
the finding that not unusual doses of alcohol, caffeine, 
strychnine, and other drugs disturb mental and motor 
efficiency at once and more profoundly than deprivations 
of food or sleep, or exposure to natural extremes of at- 
mospherie conditions, or to visual and auditory distrac- 
tions. These substances richly deserve their name— 
“powerful drugs.”

CHAPTER XVII 
THE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
Individuals of the same age differ greatly in every 
trait that has been measured or estimated. In height, 
weight, and strength; in susceptibility to disease, nervous 
stability and mental balance; in intellect, character, and 
skill; and in aptitudes for special subjects, arithmetic, 
spelling, music, or athletics individual variations are 
found. These facts have been implicitly assumed in the 
discussions of. the preceding sections; in the present 
chapter they will be treated with more precision. 
The differences between members of the human species 
are quantitative. People are qualitatively the same in 
the sense that they have in some degree the same in- 
stincts, emotions, and capacities to learn, to perceive, 
remember, imagine, reason, and to be satisfied and an- 
noyed, The physicists have analysed the “qualities” of 
tones of the human voice, of the violin, and of other in- 
struments, finding that the most subtle variations are 
due to the quantities of many constituent tonal elements 
which have been identified and measured. So with hu- 
man traits, final analysis will probably show all variations 
to be due to quantitative combinations of specific abili- 
ties, which sooner or later, may be discerned and meas- 
ured. A human trait, such as initiative, vivacity, or 
trustworthiness, is, in the case of each individual, a 
composite of many kinds of abilities each present in a 
definite amount.

THE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 401 
THe AMOUNT AND CHARACTER OF INDIVIDUAL 
DIFFERENCES 
In this grade, the differences between the best and 
poorest pupils are considerable, but about one-half of the 
pupils receive scores 5, 6, or 7; that is, the group clusters 
about a mid-point, from which there is a scattering to 
each extreme. With the exception of score 11, which 
would have occurred, without doubt, in a larger group, 
every score between the extremes is represented by one 
or more pupils. In the distribution of these small groups 
we find, then, rough illustrations of the main facts of in- 
dividual differences: (1) that the variations among 
pupils of similar cireumstances (age or grade) are wide; 
(2) that the variations are continuous; and (3) that they 
cluster around a central point or mode. 
An idea of the range of abilities that may be found in 
a single grade in representative school functions is given 
in the accompanying table:

The variations of abilities in school grades may be 
shown more clearly and completely by surfaces of fre- 
quency which. show the status, not merely of the ex- 
tremes, but of all the pupils. In Figure 42 are shown 
the distributions in three grades. In each the distribution 
is wide and rather irregular. The irregularity of the 
curves is due partly to the small size of the groups and 
partly to the incompleteness of the measures. If each 
function were tested with greater thoroughness the range 
of abilities would usually appear somewhat less great. 
Furthermore, the variations in a grade are likely to be 
greater in a particular subject than in a composite rating 
for all subjects, since pupils are classified mainly on the 
basis of general attainments. Many may be admittedly 
above or below the average in writing, arithmetic or 
some other subject. In Figure 43 the results of twenty- 
two tests in several representative subjects are averaged.

By first examining Figures 42 and 48 and later Figures 
44, 45, and 46 it will be noticed that the surface of fre- 
quency is very irregular in the former, in which small 
numbers of individuals are represented, and much more 
smooth in the latter, which embrace larger numbers.

What would be the shape of the frequency surface if an 
infinite or, let us say, 100,000,000 cases were included? 
This, of course, has never been determined but there is 
good reason to believe that such a surface could be pre- 
dicted on the basis of the data now at hand and that it 
would be essentially equivalent to the theoretical distri- 
bution of chance events. If ten pennies, placed in a box, 
are shaken up, dumped out and the number of heads 
counted and recorded, and the same procedure repeated,

we get a table of distribution of the number of heads ap- 
pearing. The results of twenty-four actual throws are 
shown in Figure 47.. This figure affords an interesting 
comparison with Figure 40, based on the records of 
twenty-four pupils in an arithmetic test. Both curves 
show continuous variation, a clustering about the middle 
and about equal irregularities of profile. For ten pennies 
tossed 1000 times, the distributions of heads is shown 
in Figure 48. Compare this curve with those of Figures

45 and 46, which were based upon measurements of about 
1000 people. They are quite similar, and all are more 
smooth and symmetrical than the curves based on the 
smaller number of cases. Mathematicians without ac- 
tually having tossed an infinite number of pennies have 
computed what the distribution would be. It is given in 
Figure 49 and is known by various names, most com- 
monly the theoretical probability curve (or surface), or 
the normal curve of distribution, or the curve of chance. 
Since the surfaces of distribution for human traits paral- 
Ficure 49, The theoretical probability curve. (From Starch, p, 33.) 
lel closely the distributions of chance events in smaller 
numbers, it seems safe to assume that an infinite number 
of measurements of people of a given age selected at ran- 
dom would produce a curve identical with the theoretical 
probability curve, which portrays the outcome of an 
infinite number of tossings of pennies, or other chance 
events. 
By a chance occurrence is meant not a happening with- 
out a cause, but an event determined by a large number 
of independent causes. To account for each penny’s po- 
sition, heads or tails, would require knowledge of a very 
large number of events happening in the box, in the air 
and on the table during the process of shaking and toss- 
ing. The position of each penny, nevertheless, is de- 
termined by definite causes, not by miracles.
-P-A-G-E-426
ee THE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 409 
Tue Causss or Inpivipvat DirrErRENCES 
The implication of the preceding paragraph is that the 
differences among individuals in any given trait are due 
to the large number of causal factors which operate in- 
dependently. To account for the position in the group 
of a particular individual it would be necessary to ascer- 
tain a great many different determining factors, and to 
discover in what way and to what degree each had 
exercised its effect. 
Individual differences spring from causes that may be 
considered under two broad headings: (1) the contribu- 
tions of heredity or native endowment, and (2) the con- 
tributions of environment, that is, of the physical, and 
social surroundings, of education and experience. 
The inherited determiners of a human trait are numer- 
ous. If one’s height, for example, could be measured in 
hundredths of an inch, we would find the total deter- 
mined in part by the thickness of the scalp, the thickness 
. of the top layer of the skull, the vertical length of the 
head, the length of many vertebrz in the neck and back, 
the thickness of cartilages between them and so on 
through a series of anatomical traits until the soles of the 
feet are reached. Each of these traits may be inherited 
more or less completely independently of the others. 
The character of growth, too, may depend upon the in- 
herited capacity of various glands which affect digestion, 
assimilation and distribution of materials, upon inherited 
dispositions to resist disease, fatigue and undernourish- 
ment. The number of inherited traits which may to 
some extent determine an individual's height at any time 
is probably legion. To disentangle and weigh them is a 
task which has been barely begun. Doubtless many fac- 
tors have not as yet been discovered at all and of those
-P-A-G-E-427
410 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
which have been identified the specific effects are but 
roughly known. 
All that is inherited, strictly speaking, is inherent in 
the germ cells from which the individual develops. But 
each character in the germ cell, whose development may 
exercise effects on many traits, is determined in part by 
various influences. In part, it is determined by the in- 
dividual’s sex, in part by race, by particular ancestors 
from the parents back through unnumbered generations, 
In the case of height, men are on the average taller than 
women, some races are taller than others, and for mem- 
bers of the same sex and race, some families are taller 
than others. Each and every one of our ancestors con- 
tributes in some degree to the amount of any traits we 
possess. The eminent Sir Francis Galton found that of 
one’s native endowment, on the average one-half is con- 
tributed by one’s parents, one-fourth by the four grand- 
parents, one-eighth by the eight great-grandparents, 
cne-sixteenth by the sixteen great-great-grandparents 
and so on back. What one’s status in a particular trait 
will be, insofar as it is due to heredity, then, will depend 
upon a large number of independent causes. All of the 
factors which conspired to bring about all of the mar- 
riages in one’s whole ancestral history must be included 
among the causes of one’s status in traits which are to 
some degree inherited. 
The environment also provides a large number of in- 
fluences which may affect human traits favorably or 
unfavorably in various degrees. Accidents, deprivations 
and disease; foods, poisons and stimulants; habits, good 
and bad; home conditions, school conditions, companions, 
teachers, books, religion, social institutions, customs, in- 
centives, punishments, and other conditions insofar as 
they are potent and insofar as they differ from person to
-P-A-G-E-428
THE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 411 
person, may cause, in some measure, the differences 
among individuals. How great the influence of each en- 
vironmental factor is, both absolutely and in proportion 
to the influence of heredity, is an important but complex 
question that must be answered specifically for each hu- 
man trait—height, strength, ability to add, spell, sing or 
judge poetry. Some of these questions will receive con- 
sideration in the following chapters. For the present, 
our interest lies in the fact that the position of an indi- 
vidual in the group depends upon a very large number of 
causal influences, many of which are unrelated. 
The status of an individual, in a group, then, like the 
outcome of the toss of pennies or dice, is the result of 
many independent causes. The distribution of human 
abilities is, as a result, similar to the distribution of the 
arrangements of dice or pennies. In both cases, though 
the distributions are generally spoken of as due to chance, 
they are not without adequate causes, but are the results 
of many independent causes. And to the extent that 
human traits have been measured, the distributions of 
unselected individuals approximates fairly closely the 
curve of chance.’ ” 
PROPERTIES OF THE PRropaBILIty SURFACE 
The fact that the distribution of human abilities ap- 
proximates the probability surface so closely is of great 
importance for the technique of mental measurements. 
The theoretical surface has a number of mathematical 
properties which have been directly or indirectly utilized. 
Most of these are too technical for description here; only 
a few samples will be described. 
If we take the theoretical curve (Figure 49), cut off 
from the tips of each end of the figure a small area such 
that 99.63 per cent. of the whole area remains, and divide

lines are erected, the areas (as shown in Figure 50) will

been divided into five equal parts and vertical lines have been erected

individuals) :

If a thousand children of the same age are measured 
for a mental or physical trait, it would be expected that 
they would fall into five groups each containing approxi- 
mately the percentages of individuals given above. They 
will not do so exactly, for even when ten pennies are 
tossed a thousand times, the result is not exactly the dis- 
tribution theoretically expected, but is a fairly close ap- 
proximation. If the number of tosses, or children tested, 
is less, the divergence will generally be greater, other 
things being equal. But even for smaller groups, the 
tendency of abilities when carefully measured to take the 
form of the probability curve may be utilized in useful 
ways. : 
For example, the probability surface is a useful theo-

retical basis for grading pupils where accurate measures 
of ability are not available. 
. When large numbers of students of similar age and 
training are thoroughly tested by reliable methods, the 
scholastic and academic abilities are generally found to 
correspond rather closely to the normal curve, which sug- 
gests that the various grades should be assigned in at 
least roughly the proportions of 8, 22, 50, 22 and 3 per 
cent of the group. A sample of how grades in various 
subjects are distributed is disclosed in the following table 
which is based on the results of reports from a university:

“A’s” and but 2 per cent “F’s”; of those taking chemis- 
try, 1 per cent received “A’s” and 28 per cent “F's,” while 
the proportions for other courses are distributed between 
these extremes. Recent work in testing more extensively 
the abilities of students in college departments makes it 
quite certain that such assignments of grades are not 
fairly representative of the variations in the abilities of 
students electing the several courses. The real achieve- 
ments within each group approximate more closely the 
distributions found in the normal probability curve 
and consequently the grades should approximate those 
percentages more closely.
-P-A-G-E-431
414. PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
Soon after the irregularities in grading were revealed, 
the University of Missouri adopted a scheme of assign- 
ing marks which embraced the five divisions and per- 
centages as given in Figure 50. The approximations to 
this ideal classification during one semester were as fol- 
lows: Excellent, 3.9 per cent; superior, 19.7 per cent; 
medium, 51.0 per cent; inferior, 16.8 per cent, and 
failure 8.5 per cent. 
The plan of grading adopted by the George Peabody 
College for Teachers gives the essentials of a method - 
which embraces the important facts of individual differ- 
ences without being too rigid in application. 
“Tt is fair to assume that the average student in any 
undergraduate course is equal in ability to the average 
student in any other undergraduate course. Conse- 
quently it is fair to expect that all members of the 
faculty will in the long run (when they have marked 
500 students, say) give approximately the same per- 
centage of students each of five grades. 
“Tt is also fair to assume that the calibre of classes 
does vary and that this is particularly true in the case 
of very small classes. Consequently it is fair to expect 
that the members of the faculty will vary considerably 
in the way they mark the members of particular classes. 
“We expect then in the long run that the members of 
the faculty will all use the same standards. We also 
expect, on the other hand, that there will be noticeable 
variation in the way individual classes will be marked. 
In the light of these assumptions, the following rules. 
are laid down: 
“1, The quality of the student’s work in a course shall 
be reported to the registrar by the use of the following 
grades: A, B, C, D and F. 
“2. The grade of ‘C’ is designed to represent the per-
-P-A-G-E-432
THE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 415 
formance of the middle 50 per cent of the class. The 
grades of ‘B’ and ‘D’ represent work that is superior 
and inferior, respectively, to that of the middle group. 
The grade of ‘A’ is reserved for markedly superior work, 
while the grade of ‘F’ is designed for those who have 
failed and shall receive no credit for their work. Students 
receiving the grade of ‘D’ will receive but 80% of the 
full credit attached to the course. 
“3, It is recognized that the more advanced the stu- 
dent the more selected is the class with which he will 
be grouped and the system of marking will vary pro- 
portionately. 
“4, Experience has shown that in the long run the 
instructor will give approximately 3% of his students an 
‘A,’ 22% of his students a ‘B,’ 50% a ‘C,’ 22% a ‘D’ and 
3% an ‘F?? 
Statistica, MEasures 
With the variations among individuals in a group as 
great as they are, the practical worker at once encounters 
a difficulty in attempting a convenient form of expres- 
sion for the group as a whole. Nothing less than the 
table or surface of distribution gives all the information, 
but these are too complex for mathematical treatment. 
Accordingly, various figures, which represent the group 
more or less adequately, are utilized in statistical work. 
Mean and Median.—First among these are vari- 
ous averages, of which the arithmetical mean and the 
median are most commonly used. The arithmetical 
mean. is obtained by adding the scores of the individuals 
in the group and dividing the sum by the number of 
individuals, a result which is popularly called-the aver- 
age. The median is obtained by counting in from either 
4 From'E. K, Srnone, Introductory Psychology for Teachers, p. 197.
-P-A-G-E-433
416 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
extreme until the middle individual is reached, his score 
being the median. These averages yield rough state- 
ments of the central tendency of the group but give 
no information concerning the form of the distribution, 
whether it is compact or widely spread, whether smooth 
or irrégular, whether symmetrical or skewed. Fre- 
quently, it is quite important to know, at least roughly, 
the variability or spread of the group. For example, 
two fourth grades might have attained, in a test in spell- 
ing, thé same mean (or median) scores and yet be very 
different as groups, as shown in Figure 51. 
In one group the range of ability is very wide, in the 
other narrow. 
Measures of Variability.—There are many methods 
of expressing the variability of a group, and of these 
one of the simplest is the mean deviation from the mean

Ficurn 51. These two distributions have the same average, i.e., 20. 
For the distribution on the left, the mean deviation is 4; for the one 
on the right 6. Vertical lines have been erected above the mean 
deviations above and below the averages. The area included between. 
them, i.¢., the shaded area, includes approximately 57 % of the whole area. 
or the median deviation from the median. Having found 
the mean (or median) of the group, the deviation of 
each score from it is computed, and the mean (or
-P-A-G-E-434
‘THE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 417 
median) of these deviations ascertained in the usual 
manner. Thus a mean of 20 with a mean deviation 
(M. D.) of 4 means a compact group as compared with 
a mean of 20 with an M.D. of 6. In both cases, approxi- 
mately 57 per cent of the individuals will be included 
within the limits of the mean plus and the mean minus 
the mean deviation. In the first case, within the limits 
20+ 4 and 20—4 ie., between scores 24 and 16 will be 
included about 57 per cent of the group; in the second 
case, 57% of the group will be included within 20 + 6 and 
20 ~ 6, ie., between 26 and 74. Between the median de- 
viations would be included half of the individuals. 
The Coefficient of Correlation—In many educational 
and psychological investigations it is desirable to ascer- 
tain the association or correlation of two traits within a 
group of individuals. We may desire, for example, to 
discover how speed of learning and retentiveness are 
associated: Do the pupils who learn rapidly retain 
better, worse, or about the same as those who learn 
slowly? What we want, in this case, is a simple expres- « 
sion of the general association of these two abilities 
within a whole group. The coefficient of correlation, 
whose symbol is r, is a statistical device for securing a 
statement of such an association. 
We shall give here no detailed account of the methods 
by which the coefficient of correlation is computed, but 
merely a simple illustration of its significance. In the 
series of columns below, suppose that the first numbers 
of each pair represent the ranks of ten different pupils, 
A, B, C, ete, in rate of learning. The most rapid 
learner is given rank 1, the next rank 2, and so on to 
the lowest indicated by 10. In the second column of 
the pair, the rank of the same pupil (A or B or C, ete.) 
in retentiveness is given. The coefficient of correlation
-P-A-G-E-435

is a single statement of the central tendency of these 
relations.

between abilities in the two traits, X and Y, which

ecient is + 0.91, a very high positive correlation. which 
allows, however, for some shifting of positions. Pupil A, 
best in trait X, is third in Y; Pupil B, second in X, is 
first in Y, and so on. The third sample, r. = + 0.51, is 
a substantial but not very high positive correlation; its 
meaning will be best understood by examining the data 
of the columns. In IV, the correlation is zero, the result 
that is obtained when the arrangement is left entirely 
to chance, as would be the case, for example, if the posi- 
tions under X and Y were determined by drawing the 
numbers from a hat. From zero to minus 1.00 is a 
range of negative correlations, in which the ranks in 
one trait are the reverse, in various degrees, of those in 
the other. Sample five, in which r= 0. 63, illustrates 
a high. negative correlation. .

CHAPTER XVIII 
INTELLIGENCE 
In the preceding chapter it was stated that all so-called 
human “qu “qualities” _are_really complexes or composites 
of particular abilities existing in definite amounts rang- 
ing from zero up. This applies to the hyman trait. 
intelligence, which will serve as an excellent example of 
both the theoretical value and the practical usefulness 
of the measurement of complex traits. 
The fact that individuals differ in in_abilit ty to learn, 
to adjust to novel situations, and to manage things,” 
people, and ideas has been repeatedly observed through- 
out the course of recorded history. In the early stages 
of experimental psychology, efforts were made to 
measure more precisely some of the aspects of intelli- 
gence. In 1880, Ebbinghaus first succeeded in devising 
tests of ability to memorize various materials with suffi- 
cient accuracy to portray individual variations. Follow- 
ing this notable accomplishment, many types of single 
tests, such as the completion of sentences in which 
certain words were omitted, the completion of pictures, 
the speed of recognizing figures, words, or sentences, the 
cancellation of letters from specified materials, arith- 
metical operations, association tests, etc., were sug- 
gested as possible touchstones of general intelligence. 
The search fora. single test, guided by the belief that 
intelligence was a single unitary power that might dis- 
close itself in clean-cut fashion in a single task or situa- 
tion, inevitably led to but partial success.

422 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
It remained | for Alfred Binet, a distinguished French 
psychologist, “to conceive the idea that intelligence was 
not a single quality or power, but a complex of abilities. 
The effect of this belief was’a radical change in the 
method of approach to the problem. Conceiving intelli- 
gence to be not homogeneous but possessing many 
aspects, Binet began to search for many types of per- 
formances or problems in which intelligent behavior 
should be displayed. Believing also that intelligence was 
largely native, although recognizing the fact that 
previous experience influences the results of most 
psychological tests, Binet began by searching for bits 
of information available to children in all walks of life, 
and for problems, puzzles, questions, mental tasks of 
various types that were not likely to be encountered 
under ordinary home or school conditions. The informa- 
tion sought, then, was of the sort that every child has 
ample opportunity to acquire, and the problems of a 
type that no child was likely to have previously learned 
to solve. _-

Tue Binet-Simon Tzsts -. 
After fifteen years of work, in part of which he was 
assisted by Theodore Simon, Binet published in 1908 the 
series of tests known as the Binet-Simon Scale of Intelli- 
gence. It consists of 54 individual tests which are 
arranged in an order of difficulty. The easiest may be 
passed by an average three-year-old child, the most 
difficult requires the ability of an average adult. 
Stimulated by this successful achievement, a large 
number of extensions and revisions of the seale have been 
made in many countries. In America the work has been 
specially active, and among the several revisions that 
by Terman, known as the Stanford Revision and Exten-
-P-A-G-E-440
INTELLIGENCE 423 
sion of the Binet-Simon Scale, is most thorough. This 
scale consists of 90 tests arranged, like the original, in 
order ‘of difficulty from some that should be passed by 
a three-year-old child to others that demand “superior 
adult” ability. 
What the scale actually measures may be explained 
more readily after an examination of some of the tests. 
In the group for age 3 are the following tasks: 
Points to the nose, eyes, mouth, hair. To pass the test, the child 
must succeed in 3 of the 4 tasks. 
Names familiar objects—key, penny, closed knife, watch, pencil. 
Subject must succeed in 3 of the 5 tests. 
Enumerates at least 3 objects seen in 1 of 8 pictures displayed 
separately. 
Gives sex, i.e. boy or girl. 
Gives last name. 
‘ Repeata sentence containing 6 or 7 syllables; eg., “The dog runs 
after the cat.” 
Repeats 3 digits, one success in 8 trials. 
Age 10: 
Defines satisfactorily at least 80 words of a list of 50, ranged in 
order from easy to difficult. Words at about the 10-year level of 
difficulty are: bewail, priceless, disproportionate, tolerate, artless, 
depredation, lotus, frustrate. The hardest words in the list which 
are mainly too difficult for the average adult are: piscatorial, 
sudorific, parterre, shagreen, and complot. 
Detects the “absurdity” in 4 out of 5 statements such as the 
following: “A man said: ‘I know a road from my house to the 
city which is down hill all the way to the city and down hill all 
the way back home, ” 
Copies from memory a geometrical figure previously studied 
for 10 seconds. : 
Gives satisfactory answers to 2 out of 3 questions such as the 
following: “What ought you to say when someone asks your opin- 
ion about a person you don’t know very well?” 
Must be able to say spontaneously at least 60 words—any words 
of which the subject can think—in a period of 3 minutes,
-P-A-G-E-441
424 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
Among the 90 tests in the Stanford Revision of the 
Scale are many which measure the ability to manipulate 
mentally femiliar facts, such as repeating digits forwards: 
and backwards, counting backwards, visualizing changes 
of the hands of a clock; to reason out the solution of 
problems which utilize the facts of arithmetic, of physical 
relations, and of practical situations. In some tests, the 
knowledge of abstract facts and relations is demanded: 
eg., in defining such words as pity, revenge, charity, 
“envy; in giving the similarities in three things, such 
as wool, cotton, leather; the differences between a 
President and a King or between poverty and misery; 
in grasping the thought contained in a short paragraph; 
or in giving the meaning of pictures or fables. In general, 
the Binet test seems to include a variety of tasks on 
which the mental abilities described in our previous 
chapters on learning, the acquisition of ideas, especially 
abstract ideas and reasoning or problem solving, depend. 
Indeed, these were precisely the aims of Binet and his 
followers. They attempted to secure tests of various 
abilities to learn, especially to learn complicated and 
abstract facts, and also to profit by experience in a gen- 
eral way. __ They tried to secure tests that would indicate 
  the problem, hold it in mind, and reason out the solution. 
In these tasks, it is assumed that mental alertness, keen- 
ness, quickness and breadth of grasp, as well as supple- 
ness, accuracy, and control would be involved. 
PERFORMANCE TESTS ww 
The Stanford-Binet is largely a verbal_test;—mainly. 
the responses are made-orally-to questions.or-problems 
presented orally by the examiner. It cannot, therefore, 
be used successfully with deaf or foreign children or with
-P-A-G-E-442
INTELLIGENCE 425 
children having speech defects. For such cases, and for 
others who are clumsy in handling language, graded 
series of performance tests have been constructed along 
lines similar to those adopted by Binet. Of these, the 
most thoroughly .standardized series is that of Pintner 
and Paterson. It includes fifteen tests, all of which 
require the management of Gonitréte objects. In the 
“form board” test, for example, record is kept of the time

used with children or feebleminded adults. Blocks, to fit the holes shown in the above board, are placed before the subject in a prescribed 
arrangement, The score is based upon time required and number of 
errors made in fitting the blocks into the holes. 
and number of false moves made by a child in placing 
a number of blocks of different shapes in appropriate 
holes in a board. The Knox cube test illustrates another 
type of performance. Four small cubes are placed in a 
row before the child while the examiner holds a fifth 
with which, after securing the subject’s attention, he taps 
the others in a prescribed order, such as 1, 2, 3,4. The 
child, who has been given the cube, attempts to tap the 
other cubes in the same order. Various orders such as 
1-2-4-3, 2-1-4-8, 1-3-2-4, ete. have been carefully

and intelligible. : +

Like the Binet Scale, the Pintner-Paterson series is an 
instrument of precision, carefully standardized, which 
must be given to subjects individually by trained 
examiners. To meet the demands for more extensive 
testing, various forms of group tests which may be 
administered by competent people without special 
training have been devised. 
Group tests may be divided roughly into two types, 
the verbal and the non-verbal, although many include 
both types of material. Of the verbal tests, the most 
familiar is the “Army Alpha,” devised by a group of 
American psychologists and applied to more than a 
million men in the American Army during the Great 
War. 
The Army Alpha test, given to recruits who could read 
and write, consists of 212 separate questions, exercises, 
or problems of eight general types, of which four are 
here illustrated. 
The first group of tests comprised twelve tasks ranging 
from easy to hard, of the following type: 
The examiner says: “Attention. Look at the square 
and triangle at 3. When I say ‘Go,’ make a cross in the 
ot\ space which is in the triangle but not in the square, and 
also make a figure 1 in the space which is in the triangle 
and in the square—‘Go!’ ” (Allow not over ten seconds.).

Test 2 consists of 20 arithmetic problems. 
Test 3 consists of 16 “common sense” problems. The 
subject is to make the best answer. The easiest and most 
difficult are: (1) Cats are useful animals because—they 
catch mice; they are gentle; they are afraid of dogs. 
(16) Why is it colder nearer the poles than at the 
equator? Because—the poles are always farther from 
the sun; the sunshine falls obliquely at the poles; there 
is more ice at the poles. 
Test 4 consists of 40 pairs of words, the two words 
of each pair being either synonyms or antonyms. The 
examineeis to underline same or opposite where appro- 
priate. The first and last pairs are: 
WEI—OrY. eee cee cece ce ee ce cree same—opposite 
encomium—eulogy........... . .same—opposite 
There are many other ‘verbal group tests, some especi- 
ally designed for elementary schools, some for high 
schools, some for colleges, and others for use among 
clerical and other occupational groups. Non-verbal 
group examinations have been devised to test very young 
children, illiterates, and others who cannot read or write 
words. In some of these examinations directions are 
conveyed orally; in others by means of pantomime. A 
variety of tasks are provided, such as to draw a line to 
indicate the shortest path through a maze, to fill in the 
missing part of a picture, to strike out an irrelevant part, 
or to complete a series of marks begun according to a 
fixed plan.” In each type of test, problems ranging from 
easy to hard are provided. 
The various types of tests and scales are not exactly 
equivalent. They do not all measure identical abilities, 
although there doubtless is a good deal in common 
among them. It will be advisable, therefore, to confine 
the discussion mainly to one test, the Stanford-Binet.

Menta AGE AND THE INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT 
The Mental Age.—To make the subject’s score on an 
intelligence test meaningful, a standard of comparison 
must be provided. The method adopted by Binet, and 
by many others later, was to use the average perform- 
ances of individuals of different ages as a standard of 
comparison. Binet ascertained just what the average 
score achieved by a group of three-year-old children, 
. four-year-old, ete., was. Of course, in such a procedure 
care must be exercised to get a sufficient number of 
representative children for each age: not merely a few 
bright ones or dull ones, but all kinds, picked at random, 
giving a distribution of ability approximating the normal 
surface of frequency. When this is done, it becomes 
possible to state a child’s achievement in terms of the 
age at which the child of average ability would secure 
the same score. This score is called the “Mental Age” 
or the “M.A.” for short. Thus, a particular child whose 
achievement in the test is equivalent to the Mental Age 
of ten years has the general mental ability of the average 
ten-year-old; it matters not what the actual chronologi- 
cal age of the particular child may be. 
The Mental Age, then, gives us a statement of the 
general mental ability of a subject at the time of the 
test in comparison with average children of different ages. 
If a ten-year-old child earns an M.A. of 10, he has 
average mental ability. If he earns an M.A. of eleven 
years he is obviously superior to the average; if he earns 
an M.A. of eight years, he is markedly inferior. The 
Mental Age is really a statement of a child’s mental 
maturity at the time, and this implies, of course, that 
general mental ability grows or matures. There is, 
indeed, fairly substantial evidence that general mental
-P-A-G-E-446
| 
: INTELLIGENCE 429 
ability as measured by the Binet tests grows gradually 
and about as uniformly as height to a maximum or 
maturity which is reached about the same time, ie., 
in the late teens. Terman has placed the average age 
of maturity at 16, although others have put the date 
at various points between 13.2 and 16. These are 
approximate statements of the average; particular indi- 
viduals mature mentally at different ages as they do 
physjeally. 
ia Quotient.—For practical purposes, we 
want to know more than merely the amount of general 
mental ability at the moment; we wish to know, if pos- 
sible, how rapidly the child’s mental ability will develop. 
We desire to be able to predict growth in mental ability; 
to tell what it will be one, two, or more years hence. Tho 
device most commonly used for this purpose is the Intel- 
ligence Quotient, or the “I.Q.” The Intelligence 
Muotient_is obtained by dividing by the chronological 
—age the mental age received on a test like the Stanford- 
Binet. For example: Pupil A has an M.A. of 10 years 
and a chronological age of 10 years. Divide M.A. 10 
by C.A. 10, the Intelligence Quotient is 1.00; Pupil B, 
whose chronological age is also_10, has an M.A. of_12; 
12 divided by 10 gives an 1.Q. of 1.20. Pupil C, also 10 
years of age, earns an M.A. of 8, which, divided by 10, 
gives an I.Q. of .80. Usually the decimal is disregarded; 
we say that A has an I.Q. of one hundred, B of one hun- 
dred twenty and C of eighty. The I.Q. is obviously a 
tatio—the ratio of the Mental Age to the Chronological 
Age. 
The_yalue Se wrtalligence Quotient for purposes: of 
prediction “depends upon the fact that It Is found to be 
at least approximately—constant from year to year. 
This fact is ascertained by repeatedly testing, at inter- 
 
-P-A-G-E-447
430 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
vals of a year or more, the same individuals with the 
same tests. Thus far, the Stanford, and to some extent 
other revisions of the Binet Scale, are the only ones 
that have been tried out in this way. A number of 
investigations have shown that the I.Q. on a retest at 
an interval of a year or more varies somewhat in par-

Intelligence of School Children, Copyright 1919, published by Houghton 
Mifflin Company.) 
ticular cases, but on the average the change is 5 points 
or less. (See Figures 53 and 54.) 
The Intelligence Quotient indicates, then—at least 
approximately—the rate of mental growth,An I. Q. of . 
100 means that the child probably has grown, is now 
growing, and will continue to grow in mental ability at 
the average rate. An I.Q. of 120 means a growth 20 per 
cent more rapid; an I.Q. of 75 means growth 25 per 
cent less rapid than the average. Since the 1.Q. remains 
approximately constant from year to year, it expresses 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
INTELLIGENCE 431 
the relative brightness or dullness of an individual. 
Thus, irrespective of age, an I.Q. of 100 means average 
mental alertness, suppleness, breadth of grasp, and capac- 
ity to learn, whereas a higher I.Q. indicates superiority 
in these respects and a lower I.Q. inferiority.

The Binet tests were devised to measure native mental

maturity which was essentially predetermined by 
conditions in the germ cells? 
The approximate constancy of the Intelligence Quo- 
tient is one line of evidence. If intelligence were essen- 
tially modifiable, the variations in experience would, of 
course, cause corresponding variations in I1.Q. But they 
do not. We find, on the one hand, children who have 
enjoyed exceptionally good care at home and school, 
remaining at approximately the same low I.Q. For 
example: “X is the son of unusually intelligent and 
well-educated parents. The home is everything one 
would expect of people of scholarly pursuits and culti- 
vated tastes. . . . When brought for examination X 
was eight years old. He had twice attempted school 
work, but could accomplish nothing and was withdrawn. 
The Binet tests gave an I.Q. of approximately 75, that 
is, the retardation amounted to about two years. The 
child was examined again three years later. At that 
time, after attending school two years, he had recently 
completed the first grade. This time the I.Q. was 73.” 1 
That school or other formal educational training does 
not appreciably increase the I.Q. is shown by such cases 
as the following: 
“Walter and Frank have been under observation for 
several years. Until the ages of five and seven years, they 
lived in an exceptionally poor home. . . . Both of the 
parents died within a year, and the boys were adopted 
by a woman of decidedly more than average ability, who 
treated them as her own sons. At the time of adoption, 
one tested at 73 and the other at 82. Four years later, 
the 1.Q.’s were 70 and 77.”.?

  INTELLIGENCE 433 
The writer secured the results of Binet tests from a 
group of 70 school children (Grades 3 to 6 inclusive) 
whose achievements in all of the representative school 
subjects were also carefully measured. During a period 
embracing nearly two school years, unusually intensive 
work in reading, spelling and arithmetic had been done 
with many of the pupils who were backward in these 
subjects. The improvements in scholastic attainments 
varied greatly among the subjects. who were, near the 
end of the period, retested with the Binet scale. Most 
of the pupils showed some change in I.Q., the greatest 
gain being 18 points, from which the changes varied to 
a loss of 12 points, with an average change of about 6 
points. The important question was whether great 
gains in I.Q. were made by those whose advance in edu+ 
cational achievements had been greatest and whether 
losses in I.Q. occurred mainly among those who had 
made the least amount of scholastic progress. There 
was no association between the two tendencies; the 
correlation was zero. An increase in I.Q. was found as 
frequently among those whose achievements had been 
small or average, as among those whose progress had been 
great. Those whose educational progress had been great 
gained.in I.Q. no more frequently than those whose gains 
were small or average. 
From these instances, it appears that while the tests 
are still imperfect, they disclose quite clearly the fact 
that there are innate mental capacities, the growth of 
which is not greatly accelerated or retarded by intensive. 
school training. The general tendency of the I.Q. to 
remain constant implies that, in the main, individuals 
are born and tend to remain at a level which is relatively 
low, average, or high. This is the rule, although there 
are exceptions.
-P-A-G-E-451
434 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
High, low, and average mental ability tends to run in 
families in much the same way as height, eye color, and 
other physical features. The inheritance of intelligence 
is most vividly illustrated in the lineage of extreme cases, 
of w. é 1 ainily. Js a notorious example. 
Martin Kallikak, a youthful soldier in the American 
revolution, met a feeble-minded girl who bore him a son 
of low mentality. In 1912 there were four hundred and 
eighty known direct descendants of this union. Of these, 
one hundred and forty-three were of such low mentality 
as to be classified as feeble-minded, and most of the 
others were of relatively low mental ability. In addi- 
tion, thirty-three of the latter were sexually immoral, 
thirty-six of illegitimate birth, and twenty-four confirmed 
alcoholics. 
Contrast the dark picture of the Kallikaks with the 
accomplishments of the Edwards family. Of Jonathan 
Edwards, born in 1703, there were, in 1900, 1394 iden- 
tified descendants, of whom thirteen were college presi- 
dents, sixty-five college professors, sixty physicians, one 
hundred clergymen, seventy-five army or navy officers, 
sixty prominent authors, one hundred lawyers, thirty 
judges, eighty prominent public officials, and a great 
many successful bankers, business men, landowners, ete. 
None was known to be of feeble mentality, and none was 
known to have committed a crime, while many achieved 
great eminence in their profession. 
More reliable evidence of the inheritance of 1ce_of mental 
ability is obtained by precise measurements of relatives, 
Thorndike, _Uusing several mental tests which, taken 
together, gave a fair measure of intelligence, found that 
twins are very similar in ability, and that siblings 
(children of the same parents) are also similar, but con- 
siderably less so than twins. If similarity in training
-P-A-G-E-452
CG 
ae 
ee? INTELLIGENCE 435 
is the cause of similarity in intelligence, siblings should 
show nearly as great a resemblance as twins. They 
show, however, only about half as great a resemblance. 
Furthermore, if similar training accounts for similar 
intelligence, those twins subjected to the same home and 
school environment should become more and more alike 
as they grow older. But they do not; the resemblance 
of twins 9 to 11 years old is quite as great as those 12 
to 14 years. 
THe SicgNrFICANCE OF GENERAL INTELLIGENCE 
The implication of the preceding section is that general 
intelligence, provisionally defined as a composite meas- 
ure of abilities to learn, to grasp broad and subtle facts 
with alertness and accuracy, to exercise mental control, 
and display flexibility and sagacity in seeking the solu- 
tion of problem-situations, is native—that is, it develops 
fairly steadily like height, reaches a maturity at some 
time in the teens, and sets for each individual a limit of 
achievement. These implications must be further 
tested. 
We shall first indicate the form of distribution of the 
Intelligence Quotients, and then proceed to study the 
significance of the several levels. Generalizing from the 
measurements of groups of representative children, the 
distribution of intelligence would probably be about as 
given in the following table: 
LLQ. below 70, 1% “LQ. 70-79, 5% Borden ne 0 0 rie. 
          
1.Q. 110-119, 14% ,

INTELLIGENCE AND ScHOLASTIC ACHIEVEMENT 
Inferior Intelligence.—Intelligence Quotients of 20 or 
less are found infrequently. Persons with I.Q.’s in this 
range are “idiots,” essentially incapable of learning. 
Individuals with I.Q.’s from 20 or 25 to 50 or so are 
ordinarily called “imbeciles’ and all within this range 
are capable of but meagre learning and adaptability. In 
the range from 50 to 70 1.Q. are found various degrees 
of “feeble-mindedness,” which grade quite imperceptibly 
into the less, but nevertheless seriously, dull individuals 
above. Throughout this enormous range, from approxi- 
mately 0 to 70 1.Q., there is absolutely no doubt about 
the innate limitations upon the acquisition of complex 
mental functions, and the rate of acquisition where 
learning is possible at all. It-is almost invariably futile 
to attempt to teach children of I.Q.’s less than "50 _te to. 
* yead, spell, _or do_arithmétié” Genuine | comprehension 
in reading or arithmetic can seldom be achieved even by 
those whose I.Q.’s fall between 50 and 60, and the little 
they do learn must be the result of arduous and pro- 
longed application. 
In the average case, an I.Q. of 75 is considered about_ 
ciable achievement, in . 
  fail almost entirely and, at best, progress is slow and soon 
halted. The average case can scarcely succeed beyond 
' the fifth grade. In the schools most of the pupils recog- 
nized by teachers as “very dull” and “very slow” will 
be found to have I.Q.’s between 70 and 85. Most of 
these children are retarded in their school progress. 
Children with 1.Q.’s of 80 to 85 drop out early in con- 
siderable numbers. but. many struggle along to finish the 
eighth gradé’ 1; 2, 3,-4,-or more. years retarded. It is

found that most of those who persist are promoted more 
rapidly than their achievements warrant, mainly because 
they are bigger and older. 
The average child with an 1.Q, of 90. is usually delayed 
a half ora full year-in completing the eight grades. The 
average child with an I.Q. of 95 is quite likely to finish 
on time. Burt found that among London children those 
with I.Q.s from 85 to 95 are the ones from the whole 
range of intelligence with which the school achieves the 
most in proportion to their innate ability. “There is 
discernible an effort, and an effort by no means sterile, 
to coax and coach these milder dullards to a grade more 
closely fitted to their actual age.” But Burt, like many 
others, found that despite coaxing and coaching, these 
children seldom equal the children of average endow- 
ment (ie., with 1.Q. of 100). That they have difficulty 
in keeping up the pace set by the school is here implied, 
and that most of them at the end of Grade 8 have about 
reached their limit is indicated in a study by Proctor, 
who found that in the first year of high school 70 per 
cent of those with I.Q.s of 95 or less failed in more than 
half of their studies. 
Average Intelligence—Children of average intelli- 
gence—those whose I.Q.s cluster closely about 100—set 
the pace in the grades. Examining the records of two 
hundred pupils, whose 1.Q.s range from 95 to 105, 
Terman found that aside from retardations clearly due 
to loss of schooling through illness or other causes, nearly 
all had made regular progress. The range 95 to 108 TQ — 
includes about “thirty-three per cent of the general 
population and probably about forty per cent of the 
population of the grammar schools. 
Superior Intelligence—The total number of children 
above 105 is about the same as that below 95: namely,
-P-A-G-E-455
4388 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
about thirty-three per cent. The former exceed the 
average in-intelligence as rveh_ss the letter fall short of it. Since the I.Q.s are really ratios of mental growth, 
it is held by many that the rate of progress through 
school should show similar ratios. That is, if the child 
with an I.Q. of 100 progresses at a given rate, one with 
an I.Q. of 75 should progress seventy-five per cent as 
fast; one with an I.Q. of 125 should progress twenty- 
five per cent more rapidly than the average; and so on. 
But just as the children between 85 and 95 are coaxed 
and coached along because they need it, and are pro- 
moted undeservedly to keep the age group intact, those 
above 105 are given less attention, because it is seldom 
needed, and are retained in the group with the same 
chronological age. Extra _promotions of children.o£f.100 
to-110 LQ. are therefere-not.numerous. The child of 
113 should be able, some maintain, to complete eight 
grades in seven years; 125 I.Q. in six; 138 in five; and 
150 in four. That these are entirely justifiable expecta- 
tions is not as yet clearly demonstrated, although there 
is no doubt that children of higher I.Q. are scholastically 
more proficient. . 
Of fifty-four children between 120 and 140 LQs 
studied by Terman, 1214 per cent were advanced in the 
* grades two years; 54 per cent were advanced one year; 
28 per cent were making average progress; and 514 per 
cent were actually retarded one year. Of a group of 
forty-seven children with a medium I. Q. of 145, Terman 
found none retarded; 8.5 per cent at the grade corre- 
sponding to their age; 29.8 per cent advanced one year; 
29.8 per cent advanced two years; 19.2 per cent three 
years; and 12.8 per cent four years. This is substantial 
evidence that the children of better than average I. Q. 
do exceed the average rate of learning such subjects as
-P-A-G-E-456
INTELLIGENCE 439 
are taught in school, and that, on the whole, the higher 
the I. Q., the more rapid the progress. 
Intelligence and Success in High School.—With re- 
gard to the limits of progress in high schools, much de- 
pends upon the standards of the school. I.Q.s of 100 do 
complete the high schools, but in just what proportions is 
not known. Among first-year students in Palo Alto High 
School, the relation between achievement and I. Q. is 
shown in these figures collected by Proctor and Terman: 
1 2 8 
SCHOOL MARKS AVERAGE LQ. NUMBER OF PUPILS 
50-59 85 12 
60-69 100 16 
70-79 107 56 
80-89 110 24 
90-99 123 4 
On the average, pupils with higher I.Q.’s earn the higher 
grades. 
Comparison of columns 2 and 3 gives an idea of the 
personnel of the first-year class in a first-class high school. 
Approximately two-thirds of the group are 100 or above, 
half are 105 or above, and a quarter are 117 or above in 
I. Q. At the end of the first year, of thirteen who 
dropped out of school, ten were below the median I. Q. 
(105) and of these, seven had failed in more than half of 
their subjects. , 
Intelligence and Success in College—The minimum 
I. Q. required for successful work in college is not defi- 
nitely known, since none of the Binet revisions contains 
tests sufficiently difficult to measure high adult 
intelligence. 
In college, however, as in the lower schools, the correla- 
tion between intelligence and quality of work is positive 
and fairly high. For example, in Columbia College, the 
higher the rating on the Thorndike Intelligence test, the |
-P-A-G-E-457
440 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
better the achievement in the classroom, on the average. 
In the accompanying table are given, in the first column, 
ranges of scores by tens on the Thorndike test (these are 
not I. Q.s but raw test scores) and in the second column 
the percentages of students who received average class- 
room grades of “B” or better during a semester. To rep- 
resent each range—i.e., 60 to 70, etc.—fifty students were 
selected at random.

Exceptionally High Intelligence—What a child of 
very high I. Q. can do, under favorable educational op- 
portunities, is illustrated by a case reported by L. 8. Hol- 
lingworth: E...., in 1916, was a boy 8 years and 4 
months of age, with an I. Q, of 187, and in Grade 8. 
“In addition to his regular school work the child has 
covered the following special work in language and 
mathematics, either with a tutor or with his mother: 
Geometry, algebra, as far as equations; Latin, partial 
knowledge of the four, declensions, (he has been taught 
by the direct, informal method, and reads easy Latin); 
Greek—worked out the alphabet for himself from an as- 
tronomical chart, between the ages of five and six years; 
French, equal to about two years in the ordinary school; 
German, ordinary conversation; Spanish, attended class 
with his mother,—reads and understands; Italian, read- 
ing knowledge, simple conversation; Portuguese, asked 
his mother to take this language at the Columbia summer 
school because he could not be registered himself; He- 
brew, a beginning; Anglo-Saxon, a beginning. - In‘ as- 
_tronomy he has worked out all the constellations from

MacCready, and displays a very great interest in this 
subject. One evening this winter he noticed a new planet 
near the Twins. He said it was Saturn, but his mother 
thought it was Mars. I... . went home, worked the 
position out from the chart, ‘and found it to be Saturn. 
He has a great interest in nature, wherever found, and is 
already able to use Apgar intelligently. His writing is 
not equal to his other accomplishments. He is very slow 
at it and for this reason dictates most of his ‘home work’ 
to a stenographer. History is his chief and absorbing 
interest among school subjects.” 
At the age of 9 E ... had completed the work of 
Grade 9; at 11 years and 10 months, graduated from high 
school; and at the age of 13 had completed three semes- 
ters of work in Columbia College. In capacity for scho- 
lastic achievement, this boy greatly surpasses - the 
average. 
Tn sum, there is impressive evidence that general in- 
telligence as measured by the Stanford-Binet tests indi- 
cates with a faithfulness that makes it extremely useful 
practically the rate at which children learn most school 
functions. It sets a limit to the kind, difficulty, or com- 
plexity of mental functions that can be acquired, and it 
sets a limit to the rate and permanence with which acqui- 
sition, within these limits, may go on. Algebra and 
geometry as now taught, for example, are beyond the 
mental capacities of many, and among those who find 
these functions within the limits of their capacity, indi- 
vidual differences in the rate, comprehensiveness, and 
permanence of learning will be found, due to differences 
in endowment. 
InTELLiceNnce AND ParticuLar ScHooL SuBsEcTS 
While the results of the Binet tests indicate very well 
the probable achievements in school work as a whole, they
-P-A-G-E-459
442 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
are not equally symptomatic of capacities in the particu- 
lar subjects. The degree to which the tests indicate ca- 
pacity in the several school functions is suggested by the 
coefficients of correlation between test scores and actual 
attainments. Taking as groups children in the same 
grades, Burt found the following average correlations: 
CORRELATION BETWEEN 
  Intelligence and composition 1.1.0... ..se eee cee cee e teen eee 63

Intelligence and spelling ... 52 
Intelligence and writing 21 
Intelligence and handwork ........... sce eee eee ee eee eens 18 
Intelligence and drawing ............ecee cece eect e neces 15 
These correlations show that the Binet tests do not 
measure native capacity in all scholastic lines equally 
well. The tests correspond quite closely to the children’s 
ability in the linguistic and abstract subjects—composi- 
tion, reading, spelling, arithmetic. Children with high 
I. Q.s are generally superior to those of lower I. Q.s in 
these subjects, but they are not markedly superior in 
writing, handwork, and drawing, that is, in mechanical 
and motor abilities. 
It should be noted, however, that the correlations be- 
tween the intelligence tests and the latter functions, 
though low, are nevertheless positive. In the long run, 
individuals with high Binet scores will excel the others 
even in these functions. These facts may be displayed 
more clearly by a comparison of a group of 14-year-old 
children whose I. Q.s average, approximately, 58 with 
- another group of the same age whose I. Q.s average about 
100, as shown in the accompanying table, which gives 
percentages of achievement of the average group attained 
by the duller.

In writing, the children of very low I. Q. do only about 
62 per cent. as well as those of average intelligence of the 
same age; in drawing about 65 per cent., and in handwork 
about 70 per cent. as well. These are average results; 
the overlapping of very dull and average children in 
motor and mechanical skills is considerable. 
INTELLIGENCE AND VocATIONAL Success 
Intelligence, as measured by the Binet tests, shows sub- 
stantial correlations with general scholastic success, espe- 
cially in such subjects which demand linguistic ability 
and the acquisition and manipulation of abstract ideas. 
Whether the same relations hold between intelligence and 
success in vocations under the more complex situations of 
life; is a matter worthy of investigation. 
Unfortunately, the number of adults that have been 
measured by the Stanford test is limited. The test was 
not designed for adults. The Army Alpha, which was 
devised for this purpose, should yield results that are 
suggestive at least. The average scores on the Army 
Alpha test obtained by various occupational groups are 
shown in the table on the following page. LQ. or 58

When comparisons of radically different vocations are 
made, there is at once perceptible a tendency for voca- 
tions which require facility in dealing with words and 
symbols to stand higher than those which require apti- 
tude for manipulating things and mechanisms. The 
clerical workers in general excel those engaged in mechan- 
ical occupations. The tests appear to have a verbal and 
linguistic bias; to favor those skilled in handling words 
and symbolic concepts as contrasted with those proficient 
in motor and mechanical abilities, in vocational life as 
they did in the school. 
Further examination of the data, however, will disclose 
the fact that the intelligence test measures abilities which 
*These are raw scores, not to be confused with IQs.
-P-A-G-E-462
INTELLIGENCE 445 
possess a wider significance. Making comparison within 
a similar type of occupation, the more skilled workers 
appear to stand higher on the intelligence scale than the — 
less expert. The mechanical engineer and draughtsmen 
are above 110, the general electrician and construction 
foreman score about 85, the workers on more specific 
tasks, such as automobile repairman, plumber, tool maker, 
bridge carpenter, auto chauffeur, etc., are below 70, while 
the unskilled laborers are at the bottom of the list. 
Among the several types of clerical workers, a similar 
correlation between intelligence and occupational levels 
exists. The chaplains surpass the Y. M. C. A. secre- 
taries, the accountant the bookkeeper, the medical offi- 
cers the army nurses. Thus within similar occupational 
lines, general intelligence is associated with levels of 
proficiency. 
It is significant that the members of the professional 
classes nearly always rank high in intelligence tests. In 
this connection, the average Army Alpha ratings of the 
students in various departments of a representative state 
university will afford interesting comparison with those 
of the occupational groups, just given.

The medians of the students in most of these profes- 
sional courses are well above all of the army occupational 
groups except the professional classes. A relatively high
-P-A-G-E-463
446 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
degree of general intelligence of this type is probably es- 
sential to success in the ministry, law, editorial work, 
medicine, banking, engineering, and other vocations for _ 
which college training is required. 
A survey of the army occupational groups shows in 
general that those which stand high have probably had, 
on the whole, a greater amount of “schooling” than those 
standing low. The additional fact that college students 
do so well suggests the possibility that success in the 
Alpha test is largely determined by the amount of scho- 
lastic training. While this test probably is influenced 
more than the Binet Scales by education, it measures 
native capacity in the main, as the following sample 
data imply.

The previous education of these groups differed very 
much less than the test scores, High test scores, rather 
than the advantages of previous schooling, seemed to 
foretell most accurately the achievements in the college 
courses. For example, one of the best records was made 
by a man who had the least previous education (5th 
grade) but a high Alpha score. Of four students who 
had previously, done only the work of grade eight, two 
Po

whose Alpha scores were very low failed in all of their 
college subjects; a third whose Alpha score was in the 
second group earned a scholarship rating of 1.00; and the 
fourth, in the highest Alpha group, received a scholar- 
ship rating of 2.13, which was higher than that earned by 
any other student, without regard to previous education, 
whose Alpha score was below 155, ie., below the highest 
Alpha group. Ls 
INTELLIGENCE AND SoctaL ADAPTABILITY AND 
LEADERSHIP 
Between intelligence scores and general school success, 
there is a substantial correlation; between intelligence 
and vocational success a marked, but as yet not thor- 
oughly appraised, association. What is the correlation of 
abstract intelligence with social adaptability and_ 
leadership, with ability to get along with and manage 
people? 
The use of the tests in the Army provided material that 
suggests a fair correlation between fitness for managing 
and leading men and intelligence ratings. The students 
of the Officers Training Schools who succeeded in earning 
commissions were on the average of higher intelligence, 
according to the tests, than those who failed. Among 
non-commissioned recruits in the cantonments, the cor- 
relations of fitness for advancement as judged by officers 
and intelligence score was fairly high (.40 to .60). 
Finally, the average intelligence of seasoned troops corre- 
sponded fairly closely with military rank. In one group, 
which included approximately 30,000 men, the privates 
obtained an average Alpha score of approximately 73, 
corporals 95, sergeants 107, and commissioned officers 139. 
The overlapping of the intelligence scores of one rank 
upon others was great, however.
-P-A-G-E-465
448 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
The relation between intelligence and social sagacity, 
adaptability and leadership has been indicated by studies 
of children. Among 150 first-grade pupils, intelligence 
correlated with various traits judged by teachers as shown 
in the accompanying table:

  These results show much the same general relations as 
those obtained on adults in the army. All lead to the 
conclusion that the intelligence tests correlate in some 
degree, but by no means’ perfectly, with the capacities 
required in understanding, getting ¢ on with, and managing 
other human beings. 
INTELLIGENCE AND Mora ADJUSTMENTS: 
Fine gradations of moral adjustments are diffictilt to 
obtain. We may seek for some evidence in the studies of 
the relation of intelligence to delinquency and crime. Of 
this association, it is impossible to make a precise state- 
ment, so diverse are the findings of different investigators. 
For example, one authority asserts that “probably 80 per 
cent of the children of the Juvenile Courts in Manhattan 
and Bronx are feeble-minded”; another, that of the cases 
in the Newark Detention Home, New J ersey, 66 per cent 
are “distinctly feeble-minded” ; another that “one-third of 
our.delinquent children are feeble-minded”; another that 
about 8 per cent are. For these discrepancies there 
are several explanations of which two are important: (1)
-P-A-G-E-466
INTELLIGENCE 449 
The diagnosis of “feeble-mindedness” has not in all of the 
studies been based on tests of intelligence alone; and 
éven when it has been, the line of demarcation between 
“normal” and “feeble-minded” is drawn at different 
levels; and (2) the studies are usually based on different 
institutions which are devoted to quite diverse types of - 
delinquency or crime. 
Of the many individual studies, one made by Burt will 
be considered because it is probably fairly typical and 
because of the care with which both intelligence and 
other abilities were measured. The group comprises 107 
juvenile delinquents, ages six to fifteen, whose misde- 
meanors include theft, begging, truancy, assault, sexual 
offences, damage to property, and general incorrigibility. 
The average chronological age of the entire group was 
13.2 years, the average mental age 11.3, thus giving an 
average retardation of two years in mental age or an 
average I.Q. of 85.6. Analyzing the distribution fur- 
ther, it is found that 7 per cent might be classified as 
“feeble-minded” ; 20 per cent as very dull; 50 per cent 
as less dull but below average; 25 per cent as about 
average; and only 2 per cent as slightly above average. 
Supernormal intelligence among children is not incompat- 
ible with delinquency; but delinquents of high intelli- 
gence are rare. While the proportion of feeble-minded- 
ness in the delinquent group is not great, it is at least 
five times as great as the proportion of feeble-mindedness 
in the total population. The more significant fact, how- 
ever, is that. the delinquent group, as a whole, is a ‘dull 
group; only 2 per cent are above the average. 
In Burt’s study, the educational attainments of the 
delinquent children were appraised by objective tests 
with results most significant. The retardation in school 
attainments is twice as great as the retardation in men:
-P-A-G-E-467
    450 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
tality; namely, the equivalent of nearly four years. With 
a chronological age of 13.2, the educational achievements 
of. these children were those of average children of 9.5 
years. Not a child was above the average of his life age 
in school attainment; only 5 per cent were approximately 
equal to it; a fifth were slightly below, and three-quarters 
were retarded by 30 per cent or more. 
Typically, then, the delinquent child is a dull child but 
not all dull children are delinquent. Social and moral 
deficiency is explained by dullness plus something else; 
plus other traits which typically result also in relatively 
marked backwardness in scholastic achievement. To a 
considerable extent, the other traits are probably emo- 
tional and temperamental deficiencies or nervous insta- 
bility; traits previously considered in Chapters VIII and 
IX—although irregular school attendance, physical de- 
fects or deficiencies, unfavorable home, school, or street 
influences, disease, and other factors play réles of some 
importance. The compelling drives of dominant in- 
stincts, the incapacity for sustained effort, fickleness of 
interest, or the disrupting effects of unstable. but impul- 
sive emotions when combined with dullness of mind 
provide an organism readily susceptible to misdemeanor 
and crime. DS 
CoNCLUSIONS 
The results of tests, such as the Binet or the Army 
Alpha, together with studies of the inheritance of mental 
traits lead to the assumption of general intelligence. 
By intelligence is meant a group or composite of native 
cabanities for learning alone the lines that require i pacitios for-tearning along the lines that require mental 
operations with verbal, symbolic, and abstract materials. 
In these fields, the more intelligent perso imore 
rapidly, displays greater mental keenness, accuracy, and

control in meeting new problem-situations, and is capable 
of ascending to higher levels of achievement than the less 
intelligent person. 
The intelligence tests do not measure all types of ca- 
pacities to learn, but those which are tested are of great 
importance. Upon such capacities. mainly depends 
achievement in school and colleges and success in many 
vocations. Social adaptability, proficiency in managing 
people, and effectiveness of moral adjustments are also 
associated to an appreciable degree with this type of in- 
telligence. The correlation of intelligence with ability 
to acquire various mechanical and motor skills—writing, 
drawing, painting, athletics, and various mechanical 
trades—is positive but low. 
Bm QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. To what extent are the factors which are involved in reason- 
ing also involved in taking intelligence tests? Do you think the 
reasoning tests given in Chapter 14 would make good tests of 
general intelligence? 
2. A boy of 10 with an 1.Q. of 140, would have what mental age? 
A boy of 14 with an I.Q. of 100? In what respects would these 
two boys resemble each other or an adult with an M.A. of 14? 
In what respects would the three be very unlike? 
3. If you were selecting children to form a homogeneous grade, 
what measure would you use, the M.A. or the I.Q.? Why? 
4, What arguments or evidence can you offer to support the 
contention that intelligence tests measure the results of school 
training mainly? How might the facts be determined experi- 
mentally? 
5. Carefully distinguish between intellectual capacity and 
achievement. 
6. What factors other than intelligence may contribute to suc- 
cess in life? 
7. Do you suppose the methods of teaching which are best for 
1.Q.’s of 180 and over are best for those of 100? For those of 70? 
8. Comment on this statement, “it may be of greater value to
-P-A-G-E-469
452 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
society to discover a single gifted child and aid in his proper 
development than to train a thousand dullards to the limit of their 
educability.” 
9. How would you explain the fact that children of superior 
intelligence when graded with those of the same age occasionally 
become mischievous, lazy or bored with school work ? 
10. Is it conceivable that a person could have too much intelli- 
gence to be successful or happy in certain vocations? Illustrate. 
11. If children were to be grouped according to Mental Age, 
what difficulties of administration would be encountered? What, 
if any, difficulties in social adjustments? 
12. Have you observed any cases of irregular educational de- 
velopment, of spurts or arrests, or of changes in apparent bright- 
ness? Might these irregularities be only apparent? Might they 
appear in scholastic achievement without being occasioned by 
similar variations in mental development? 
18. Is it your experience that the more intelligent people are 
more or less socially adaptable? How would you explain the ex- 
ceptional cases? ; 
14. How might intelligence tests be used in vocational guid- 
ance? 
15. When a child’s I1.Q. becomes higher or lower on a retest, 
does it necessarily mean that his intelligence has changed corre- 
spondingly ?

CHAPTER XIX 
THE MEASUREMENT, ORGANIZATION, AND 
CORRELATION OF TRAITS 
In the preceding chapter we observed various correla- 
tions between native mental capacities and achievement 
in school subjects, vocational success, and social and 
moral adaptations. The correlations were in some cases 
low; in others moderate or high; but none perfect. The 
probability is that even when opportunities to learn and 
the efficiency of instruction are equal, to aecount for 
achievements—both absolute and relative—traits other 
than intelligence must be considered. But first, how are 
various forms of achievement to be measured? 
Tue MrasureMENT or EpucaTionaAL ATTAINMENTS 
The need of objective tests and scales for measuring 
educational achievements is disclosed by the unreliability 
of subjective judgments of scholastic products. For ex- 
ample: In an experiment, two final examination papers 
in first year high school composition were graded by 142 
English teachers in as many high schools; a final exami- 
nation in geometry was graded by 114 teachers of mathe- 
matics and a final examination in American history by 70 
teachers in history—all grading being on a percentage 
~ basis. Representative variations in scores are shown in 
Figure 55. The marks of the first English paper ranged 
from 64 to 98; of the second from 50 to 98; of the geom- 
etry paper from 28 to 92; and of the history papers from 
454

43 to 90. That these variations were not due mainly to 
differences in standards in different schools has been 
shown by similar studies of teachers in the same schools 
and colleges. The deviations are nearly as great. Even

Starch and Elliott.) 
when a teacher after an interval regrades a set of papers, 
the marks differ appreciably from those of the first 
scoring. 
The causes of such conspicuous variations in grading 
are many. Teachers have different general standards, 
lenient or severe, and these may vary considerably: from 
time to time. Different degrees of importance are at- 
tached to the many items—penmanship, spelling, gram- 
mar, terseness, particular facts, general understanding. 
Judgments of the relative difficulty of the questions or 
problems in an examination are often faulty. Among 
twenty sixth-grade teachers, each of whom judged the 
relative difficulty of 23 arithmetic problems, there was 
great disagreement: Problem 1 was placed by some 
teachers in various positions from the easiest to the eighth 
in difficulty; problem 12 from the fourth to the seven- 
teenth; and problem 23 from the first to the twenty-first. 
Familiarity with the work of a group of pupils usually 
reduces the validity of grading products of those pupils,

some of whom: become stamped as generally excellent, 
others as fair or poor; and these general estimates un- 
wittingly pervade the judgments of the particular. tests. 
The good pupils in general are not marked down as much 
as they should be when their showing is relatively poor 
and the poor pupils are not marked up as much as they 
should be for exceptional performance. All told, subjec- 
tive judgments of school products are found to be strik- 
ingly inaccurate. For more reliable, more comprehen- 
sive appraisals of educational attainments there clearly 
has been a need—a need fulfilled in some measure: by 
standardized and scaled tests. 
Any series of questions, exercises or problems consti- 
tutes a ‘‘test.”” When the procedure for giving a test, the 
instructions, the time, and the method of scoring the 
results are prescribed, we have a “standardized test.” For 
many of the standardized tests now in use “scales”. have 
been constructed by the use of which the pupil’s achieve- 
ment may be evaluated. A scale is either a statement of 
a series of test scores ranging from the lowest to the 
highest by steps of known, usually equal magnitude, or a 
representation of a series of products which range from 
very poor to excellent by steps of known, usually equal, 
magnitude. A few illustrations will make this clear. 
Quality Scales—The Thorndike Writing Scale con- 
sists of a series of samples of handwriting ranging from 
very low to very high quality or merit by equal steps 
(see Figure 56). A specimen of a pupil’s writing ob- 
‘tained under prescribed test conditions is compared with 
the samples on the scale and given the scale score which 
it equals in merit. The value of the scale is that it pro- 
vides an objective standard of comparison and furnishes 
a device by means of which teachers’ estimates may be 
improved and expressed in terms of a uniform currency.

Difficulty Scales.—The difficulty of a performance, as

The Burgess Reading Test, which is also a speed test, 
measures the number of paragraphs read and correctly 
interpreted in a given time (see Figure 58). 
The purpose of the standardized test is to enable the 
teacher to do better what already she desires to do but 
can otherwise accomplish only with difficulty, if at all; 
that is, to determine with exactitude—independent of 
subjective bias—the speed, difficulty, or quality of the 
pupil’s achievements. Using the same tests and

standardized methods of giving and scoring, norms: of 
attainments for the various ages and grades may be con- 
structed with which the competence of individual pupils 
or groups may be compared. The instruments may be 
used in school surveys, in classification and grading, in 
definition of standards of achievement, in evaluating the 
methods of instruction, in the encouragement of progress, 
in the diagnosis of individual difficulties, and in the 
solution of other problems which school teachers or. 
administrators encounter. 
Spectra, ApritupEes AND INAPTITUDES 
With the application of standardized tests and scales to 
children of similar general mental ability, it became ap- 
parent that even among functions which gave about 
equal correlations with intelligence tests, considerable 
variations occurred. That is, although reading, compo- 
sition, arithmetic, spelling, history, and other linguistic 
and abstract subjects were on the whole closely and fairly 
uniformly associated with general capacity as measured 
by an intelligence test, most individual children por- 
trayed particular strengths and weaknesses. These 
variations are shown in the fact that the correlations of 
these subjects with each other are far from perfect, as 
disclosed in the following table:

Similar results are found among skills. Thus, among

-pupil’s actual age. The vertical column at the left gives the “norms” 
or average scores for ages 7 to 15. This pupil is as good as the 
average 13-year-old in comprehension in reading, or, we may say he 
has a “reading comprehension age-of 13 years.” He is at age 12 in 
reading rate, a little above 12 in the degree of difficulty of arithmetic 
problems which he can solve, less than 11 in speed and facility in 
arithmetical operations, nearly 13 in composition but barely above 11 
in spelling. This profile shows about an average amount of irregularity 
in achievement.

the studies of the inheritance of individuals eminent in

defects and deficiencies, have shown.

native capacities. In several fields tests for these native 
aptitudes have been or are being constructed, although

advance. 
Tuer Causes or DiscrEPANCIES BETWEEN CAPACITY 
AND ACHIEVEMENT 
The possibilities of achievement, then, depend mainly 
upon native capacities for learning along the particular 
line in question. But between competence and: capac- 
ity, between actual and possible attainments, wide dis- 
crepancies are frequently found. How are they to be 
explained?
-P-A-G-E-481
464 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
First, by imequalities of opportunity and instruction. 
Mere capacity does not insure achievement. Achieve- 
ment is the return on capacity wisely invested in 
education. 
Even when age, opportunities to learn, and the pro- 
ficiency of teaching are rendered as nearly equal as pos- 
sible, gaps between capacity and achievement will still 
be found. To account for them would usually demand 
a complete appraisement of the individual’s equipment. 
It would be necessary to diagnose the efficiency of the 
sensory mechanisms and the organs of response, the regu- 
lative glands, the stage of anatomical and physiological 
maturity, the strengths of numerous instinctive tenden- 
cies, the general and particular emotional propensities, 
the stability of nervous control, the nature of habits pre- 
viously acquired, and various complex traits such as dili- 
gence, trustworthiness, ambition, and sociability. 
The importance of some of these traits has been indi- 
cated in previous chapters. Some of them may now be 
measured with considerable precision; but in the ap- 
praisal of others only a beginning has been made. With- 
in the limits of this book only a brief discussion of the 
efforts to devise measures for a few of the more complex 
traits is all that can be attempted. 
MEASUREMENT OF GENERAL EMoTIONALITY, NERVOUS 
AND MENTAL STABILITY 
What is meant by general emotionality, nervous and 
mental stability, and how they are related to achieve- 
ment and general adjustment to life was described in 
Chapters VIII and 1X. There are theoretical and practi- 
cal distinctions between general emotionality, instability 
of the nervous type and instability of the mental, which 
may be discovered by expert diagnosis; but for prelim-
-P-A-G-E-482

inary appraisement in practical hands tests for general, 
undifferentiated deviations from the average stability are 
alone available. Of these the Woodworth-Mathews 
Psychoneurotic Questionnaire (an outgrowth of Wood- 
worth’s Questionnaire developed for adults during the 
War) is a promising instrument for use with children. It 
consists of two series of questions, one primarily for pre- 
adolescent children and another primarily for adolescents. 
The two lists together comprise 100 questions, of which 
the diagnostic significance has been established experi- 
mentally. The symptoms fall into four groups: (1) 
Those relating to fears, worries, perseverating ideas, or 
acts—for which there are 22 questions; (2) those relating 
‘to physical symptoms, such as pains, weariness and inco- 
ordinations—25 questions; (8) those relating to un- 
happiness, unsocial and anti-social moods—37 questions 
and (4) those relating to dreams, phantasies and sleep 
disturbances—16 questions. Samples of the questions 
are given below.

Among 1034 school children of ages 9 to 19 years, the 
number of unfavorable responses varied from 2 to 67,
-P-A-G-E-483
466 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
with 23 as an average. Children with psychoneurotic 
tendencies usually show a relatively large number of 
unfavorable responses and as a rule the more pronounced 
the instability the larger the number of symptoms. The 
correlation was close enough to make it likely that these 
questionnaires will be of substantial usefulness for a 
preliminary estimate of general emotional, mental and 
nervous instability. 
MrasurEMENT oF Instinctive Dispositions 
Each of the instincts discussed in Chapter VII offers a 
clue to the study of personality. Some children are more 
pugnacious than others; some more obstinate, masterful, 
or self-assertive; some are more acquisitive, curious, 
kindly, gregarious, or more prone to laughter, to crying, 
or to fear; some have stronger sex and parental propensi- 
ties; some are more zealous to secure social approval; 
some are more responsive to rivalry. All told, these na- 
tive dispositions constitute an important stock of dynamic 
factors which in no small measure contribute to the ad- 
justments to school lessons and to other situations in life. 
That the task of measuring these traits of personality is 
not as yet far advanced is substantial evidence not of 
indifference but of the complexity and difficulty of the 
tasks involved. 
For several traits, such as aggressiveness or self-asser- 
tion, perseverance, optimism, stubbornness, and flexibil- 
ity in adjustment and ambition, tests have been devised 
and are now being subjected to trial. Among the most in- 
genious and most promising is the Will-Temperament 
Test devised by Downey, which includes twelve specific 
tests, based mainly on handwriting, for such traits as the 
following: (1) Speed of movement (whether a person 
naturally moves quickly or slowly); (2) freedom from
-P-A-G-E-484
MEASUREMENT AND ORGANIZATION OF TRAITS 467 
load (the tendency to warm up rapidly and work at 
high speed without external pressure); (3) flexibility 
(ease and effectiveness in readjustment or adaptability) ; 
(4) speed of decision; (5) motor impulsion (impetuos- 
ity and energy of reaction); (6) reaction to contradiction 
(the degree of confidence with which one maintains his 
opinion against contradiction); (7) resistance to oppo- 
sition (the tendency to overcome obstruction); (8) 
finality of judgment (whether one wavers or perseveres in 
his opinions); (9) motor inhibition (a test of “motor 
control, imperturbability, and patience”); (10) interest 
in detail; (11) co-ordination of impulses (“capacity to 
handle a complex situation successfully without forget- 
ting any of the factors involved’); and (12) volitional 
perseveration (“willingness to keep plugging away”).- 
Downey’s method is to use the scores for each test in- 
dependently, displaying them for purposes of comparison 
in a graph which portrays the will-temperament “pro- 
file.” Figure 63 gives a sample profile. A balanced pro- 
file running from scores 4 to 6, according to Downey, 
suggests a less speedy, forceful, and accurate individual 
than a profile ranging from 8 to 10. High scores on such 
traits as speed of movement and decision, freedom from 
load, flexibility, and motor impulsion are said to charac- 
terize an individual as mobile or rapid-fire in organiza- 
tion, whereas high scores in motor inhibition, interest in 
detail, co-ordination of impulses and volitional persevera-~ 
tion are characteristic of the controlled, deliberate, pains- 
taking person. Many combinations are possible among 
the twelve tests but they are not so numerous as to 
exaggerate the multiplicity of temperaments found in 
human nature. 
How faithfully the Will-Temperament Tests represent 
the traits they purport to measure has not as yet been
-P-A-G-E-485
468 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
determined with finality, but the tests have opened a 
fruitful field for research, out of which objective measures

finality of judgment, freedom from load, resistance to opposition and 
motor impulsion in conjunction with high motor inhibition. The 
high score for flexibility and the medium one on reaction to contra- 
diction (tactful response) indicate social pliability and suggestibility 
which increase X’s social assets, but are of dubious value in his 
business life. The low score on interest in detail is not a serious 
defect, since X is in a position to turn over to subordinates the execu- 
tion of many of his projects. It goes, however, with a tendency to 
generalize on insufficient grounds. The low score on volitional perseve- 
tation is probably a real weakness.” (Graph and Quotation from

Book Company.) 
result. As the validity of such tests is demonstrated, the 
réle of temperamental and volitional traits in school and 
society will be more perfectly determined.

MEASUREMENT AND ORGANIZATION OF TRAITS 469 
Supsective JupeMents or Human Traits 
-Where tests are not available, resort to judgments 
based on observation is the common alternative. How 
unreliable are judgments of human traits has been dem- 
onstrated in many experiments. For example, near the 
end of the school year, the teachers of a small school 
were asked to judge the “school attitude’—to make a 
general judgment of the interest, diligence, and willing- 
ness to work—of those pupils with whom they were well 
acquainted. Each teacher utilized the same description 
of the trait in question and the same device for recording 
her judgment. Between the judgments made by any 
two teachers, we may compute coefficients of correlation 
which portray the degree to which the two teachers were 
in agreement. For twenty-one such comparisons, the 
correlations are as follows: .04, .10, .16, .19, .27, .31, 31, 
.35, 88, .39, .47, .48, .50, .54, .55, .55, .56, . 58, .62, .70, .75. 
The median of the series is .47. 
These figures show a range from almost no agreement 
to very substantial agreement; the median being but fair 
agreement. Conceivably, judgment is not as bad in the 
extreme cases as these data appear to show since some 
pupils may show a good attitude toward the work of cer- 
tain teachers and a poor attitude toward that of others. 
These differences would perhaps hardly obtain so pro- 
nouncedly in the case of such traits as neatness, sagacity, 
humor, conceit, and refinement which likewise provoke 
disagreements among judges. 
Many investigators have sought to reduce the unrelia- 
bility of judgments of human traits by the use of rating 
scales, of which there are many varieties. During the 
World War, psychologists introduced into the army for 
the use of officers a rating scale which required a “man-
-P-A-G-E-487
470 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
to-man comparison.” This scale was constructed by the 
placing at the upper extreme the name of the man who 
among the officer’s acquaintances ranked highest in the 
trait in question; at the lower extreme the name of the 
man lowest in the trait; at the middle point, an average 
man; half way between top and middle a fourth man and 
a fifth half way between the middle and the bottom. 
Each candidate for judgment was compared with the 
other men constituting the steps of the scale. While this 
device doubtless increased somewhat the validity of judg- 
ment, a high degree of accuracy was not obtained. If 
judgment of human traits is fallible, as it most conspicu- 
ously is, no rating device will make it even approximately 
perfect. According to an army investigation reported by 
Rugg, ratings become practicable only when: (1) the 
rating scales are made comparable and equivalent; (2) 
the judges are thoroughly acquainted with the subjects; 
and (3) the independent ratings of at least three judges 
are averaged. / 
By whatever device ratings may be guided, some traits 
are more accurately judged than others—as shown in 
early experiments by Cattell and Norsworthy, whose re- 
sults are consolidated below in a table which gives the 
relative amount of divergence or disagreement among 
various judges.

Kindliness ............ cee aes 122.9 
The personal and social traits such as kindliness, cheer- 
fulness, and codperativeness are most poorly judged as in- 
dicated by the fact that disagreements are here very 
great. Traits for which objective evidence is more 
readily available are the most reliably judged, eg., effi- 
ciency, originality and quickness, which disclose them- 
selves more obviously in the products of daily work. 
Judgment, will, intensity, and independence fall between 
the extremes, at levels which probably indicate the de- 
gree to which the evidence whereby individuals may be 
judged is impersonal. 
One difficulty common to teachers and others in the 
judgment of traits is the tendency to form a judgment 
of a person as a whole, as very good, average, or poor— 
which often, unintentionally, influences the judgment of 
each particular trait. At some we look through the 
small and at others through the large end of the tele- 
scope, which presents to our eyes an expanded or com- 
pressed personality in whole and in all its parts. Where 
objective measurements are unavailable or inadequate, 
the practical worker and the investigator alike should 
treat subjective estimates with caution.” 
Tue Orcanization or TRarts INTO PERSONALITIES 
What traits constitute a person—as far as his general 
adjustments and activities in the everyday give-and-take 
relations are concerned—we have attempted to disclose in 
some measure; but heretofore many traits have been con- __
-P-A-G-E-489
472, PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
sidered in isolation from others. The practical influence 
of a given trait is often determined not wholly by its 
amount but also by its relation to others. Other things 
being equal, a high degree of intelligence is more produc- 
tive when found in a healthy body. A powerful voice 
alone will not make a successful statesman, nor will a fine 
physique. The race is not always won by mere swift- 
ness. For many forms of adjustment and achievement, 
a certain combination of traits is required. 
Personality Types.—It has been customary to divide 
individuals into “types” of personality. By a “type” we 
should properly refer to the kind of individuals that are 
most numerous, to those that are most typical of the 
whole group. But mainly the customary “types” of per- 
sonality or temperament—such as the sanguine, choleric, 
phlegmatic, and melancholic—refer to the extreme rather 
than to the typical organizations of human traits. This 
is probably due partly to the over-estimation of the fre- 
quency of the extreme cases and to a failure to observe 
that the largest numbers are clustered about the average. 
The exceptional cases attract attention precisely because 
they are exceptions.. And-the tendency to classify people 
sharply into personality types usually distorts the picture 
of distribution by producing large groups at the extremes 
where actually there are few, and few people at the aver- 
age, where really there are many. In comparing the per- 
sonalities of groups, consequently, the emphasis on the — 
extremes usually results in an exaggeration of the differ- 
ences between the groups as a whole. 
Sex Drirrerences

conspicuously different than male and female. In fiction 
and in pseudo-scientific literature, sex differences are de-. 
scribed in number and degree so great as to make man 
and woman appear to be members of nearly distinct 
species. This is doubtless due in part to a tendency to 
‘compare extreme cases of the two groups, and it may be 
said at the outset that while sex differences do exist, they 
are less great than has generally been supposed. Before 
considering male and female personalities as a whole, it 
will be necessary to consider the differences in specific 
traits. In gross physical traits—height, contour, weight, 
strength, and appearance—sex differences are most spec- 
tacular, a fact which doubtless /has had an influence on 
the judgments of mental and temperamental traits. But 
even in physical traits, the overlapping of boys and girls 
of the same age, or of men and women, is considerable. 
At maturity boys excel girls ih height, weight, strength, 
lung capacity, and other physical capacities. Of consid- 
erable educational significance is the fact that girls are 
more precocious in their anatomical and physiological de- 
velopment. The following table gives a rough indication 
of the facts: ‘

Strengthof Boys 27.8 52.5 
Right Arm Girls 34.9 68.4 
At 7 years of age the girls have outstripped the boys in 
their progress toward maturity and they increase their 
lead to a maximum in the vicinity of the twelfth year,
-P-A-G-E-491
474 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
where their advantage amounts to about the equivalent 
of two years, i.e., the eleven-year-old girl has the maturity 
of the thirteen-year-old boy. Beginning at about twelve, 
the girl’s’ growth tapers in comparison with the boy’s, 
whose development is rapid until the seventeenth year, 
when final maturity is‘or has been reached by the ma- 
jority of both sexes. 
These differences in physiological age before maturity 
color the whole personality to some extent. According to 
Baldwin, “The physiologically more mature child has 
different attitudes, different types of emotions, different 
interests, than the child who is physically younger though 
of the same chronological age” . . . “there is a direct 
relationship between social age and physiological ma- 
turity.” “Some at a given chronological age are suffici- 
ently mature to meet the social conditions which may 
arise, while others are not,” + 
In general intelligence sex differences are less conspicu- 
ous at all stages of growth, as is shown in the following 
table based on the Binet Mental Ages of 1000 children 
measured by Terman and '3500 measured by Burt.

MEASUREMENT AND ORGANIZATION OF TRAITS 475 
Both investigations agree that the girls surpass the 
boys on the average by about three-tenths of a year in 
mental age, but the superiority is irregularly distributed. 
It has been customary to see in these figures a more rapid 
mental maturation of girls to harmonize with their more 
precocious physical development, but even if this inter- 
pretation is correct—it is not altogether certain that it is 
—the significant matter is the closeness of the approxima~ 
tion of the two sexes to equality. 
In more specific mental abilities—perception, memory, 
reason, ete.—the difference between the sexes, where they 
exist at all, are so slight and unobtrusive as to appear 
dwarfed and swamped in comparison with the immensity 
of the variation within either sex. 
In special aptitudes for various types of school work, 
sex differences again appear to be slight. Using a bat- 
tery of standardized tests for reading, vocabulary, arith- 
metic, spelling, composition, writing, drawing, and hand- 
work, Burt has measured over 5000 school children in 19 
different schools, yielding for each age approximately 750 
representatives of each sex. The facts are given in the 
accompanying table which displays the relative attain- 
ments of each. On the whole, the differences are essen- 
tially negligible. Girls excel slightly in reading, spelling, 
writing, and composition; boys in arithmetic and hand- 
work; in drawing the sexes are equal. How insignificant 
are the differences in general is disclosed by the data for 
arithmetic. In addition girls are slightly superior, in 
subtraction boys excel, in multiplication attainments are 
equal, and in division boys excel slightly. All through 
the list, the sexes play a veritable leap-frog with each 
_ other and even in handwork the differences are so small 
as to be statistically unreliable. On the whole, with 
equal incentives there is little justification for the as-

Concerning sex differences in instinctive, emotional, 
temperamental, moral, and other traits innumerable 
opinions have been given; but for none is there unques- 
tionable evidence. Indeed, as more precise measurement 
becomes possible the verdict of “no significant difference” 
is more frequently cast, although it may be that in the 
traits as yet unmeasured important differences will be 
disclosed. The most probable differences are certain in- 
stinctive and emotional propensities clustering around the 
differences in reproductive functions on the one hand, and 
the differences in physical prowess on the other. It is 
conceivable, but not proved, that the maternal instinct 
differs in strength and in operation from the paternal, re- 
sulting for the woman in a keener interest, broader sym- 
pathies, and perhaps clearer insight in dealing with 
human expressions and acts. Men may be more self- 
assertive and pugnacious, in keeping with their superior 
physical strength. 
Differences in general achievement and personality be- 
tween the sexes, then, insofar as-environmental influ- 
ences affect them equally, are doubtless exaggerated by
-P-A-G-E-494
MEASUREMENT AND ORGANIZATION OF TRAITS 477 
the tendency to compare the extremes rather than the 
typical cases. The general differences which do obtain 
are to be explained not so much by differences in all 
single traits as by the influence of a few which color the 
whole. Thus, if the parental instinct is stronger in 
women, it may affect widely their activities in and rela- 
tions to life. The superior physical strength’ of men— 
and if genuine, the greater force of the pugnacious instinct 
—would account in part for their greater achievements, 
even if the mental and motor aptitudes of the sexes were 
equal. 
Ractau Dirrerences 
Different races offer another opportunity to study com- 
binations of traits. Among civilized races differences in 
physical traits are demonstrated; differences in tempera- 
mental traits are probable, but not demonstrated; and 
differences in mentality are neither demonstrated nor 
probable. Extensive measures by various forms of the 
Binet test in France, Germany, Sweden, England, and 
America, and less extensive investigation in other coun- 
tries, show inconspicuous variations in general outcome; 
the probability is that the general mental ability of these 
races is approximately equal. In America, little has been 
learned of racial differences, except that on such tests as 
the Army Alpha, negroes and Indians perform relatively 
poorly; but any sweeping statement of the intellectual 
status of these races would be premature. Among other 
races in America, insofar as traits have been measured, 
the overlapping is very great, both in physical and mental 
characteristics. Concerning emotional and temperamen- 
tal traits, there is little to offer except conjecture. It is 
quite likely, however, that the tendency to seize upon 
some one or few peculiarities of a race, magnify them,
-P-A-G-E-495
478 PSYCHOLOGY FOR STUDENTS OF EDUCATION 
and judge the whole personality in the light of them, 
results in an exaggeration of the differences between races 
as a whole. 
Tue Corre.ations or Traits 
If we compare an individual with others of the same 
age, race, and sex we will find variations above and below 
a certain. central tendency for that individual. This fact 
has already been mentioned in the case of the school 
subjects. A pupil who is about average in general is 
likely to be more or less above average in some subjects 
and more or less below in others. Another who in gen- 
eral stands high also shows an irregular profile. The 
same fact obtains in other traits, as may be seen in the 
profiles in Figures 59, 60, 61 and 62. How great these 
variations are, which traits tend to be closely associated 
and which tend: to be inversely related, may be deter- 
mined by computing the correlations between them in the 
case of a group of individuals. 
Studies of the correlations of human traits early dis- 
closed the fallacy of the prevalent belief in compensation 
—the assumption that the possession of certain desirable 
traits implied the presence of compensating undesirable 
characteristics. To illustrate: it was frequently asserted 
that the quick learners retain poorly, that the rapid 
workers were inaccurate, that great knowledge went with 
slow wit, that men of great artistic abilities—as in music, 
painting or literary composition—were usually stupid in 
practical matters, that scholarly minds were encased in 
clumsy bodies, that superior intellects were usually 
coupled with inferior mental stability. To the extent 
that various desirable traits have been measured, the 
facts generally favor the theory of positive correlation 
rather than that of negative correlation or compensation.
-P-A-G-E-496
MEASUREMENT AND ORGANIZATION OF TRAITS 479 
If the reader will glance at the various tables of correla- 
tions in this book, he will find positive correlations almost 
exclusively. A few others will be ‘briefly mentioned, 
taking as samples the correlations of various desirable 
traits with general mental ability. 
Superiority in mental capacities is correlated positively 
but not closely with desirable physical traits. If we take 
a large group of individuals of the same age and divide 
them into two groups on the basis of mental ability, the 
brighter group will surpass the duller in height, strength, 
endurance, manual dexterity, and athletic prowess. The 
brighter group wiil have fewer defects of the sense organs, 
nervous system, reacting mechanisms, and internal or- 
gans. There will be many exceptions to the general rule 
among individuals inasmuch as. the correlations are 
usually low. A similar relation between mental ability 
and physiological efficiency will be found. The indica- 
tions are that the group superior in mentality will sur- 
pass the other in resistance to disease, to drugs such as 
alcohol, to malnutrition, to exposure, ete. 
The correlations of general mental ability with the 
broader volitional, emotional, xsthetic, social, and tem- 
peramental traits are less well known chiefly because 
these traits have not as yet yielded to precise measure- 
ments, The list of correlations in the accompanying 
table, however, suggest a decided tendency toward posi- 
tive correlation:

General mental ability, then, is positively associated 
more or less closely with other desirable traits. If the 
problem had been taken up from another point of view, 
such as the correlations of other traits with morality or 
artistic ability, the same general result would have been 
found; namely, all desirable traits tend to be associated 
with each other. The correlations are not equal, how- 
ever, and they are often low. Even a correlation as high 
as + .90 permits several individuals fairly high in one 
trait to be fairly low in the other, and vice versa. Spe- 
cialization there is; we all have our particular strengths 
and weaknesses. But on the average, weakness in one 
trait implies weakness in others; mediocrity in one im-. 
plies mediocrity in others, and strength in one, strength 
in others. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. What is the difference between a test and a standardized 
test? A test and a scale? When we measure a man under stand- 
ardized conditions such as in stocking feet and with back against 
4 wall, giving the results of the measurement in terms of inches, 
what comprises the test? What the scale? 
2. What are the advantages of standardized tests and scales 
compared to the “essay” examination? How may they be used 
in the daily work of the school? 
3. For Purposes of examination, what advantages can you see 
in using the “Tyye-False” or the “Completion” tests given among
-P-A-G-E-498

the exercises of earlier chapters over the essay examination? What 
disadvantages, if any ? 
4. Which is probably mere accurate, a rating on a quality or a 
tating on a difficulty scale? Why? 
5. What do people usually mean when they speak of a “womanly 
woman,” “a manly man,” “a true Irishman,” “a typical French- 
man”? Do you know any such individuals? 
6. Define exactly what is meant when you describe another indi. 
vidual as having “a good personality,” in terms of specific in- 
stincts, capacities, and acquired traits. 
7. Why do we have less. accurate measures for such traits as 
diligence, ambition, etc, than we have for intelligence? Are 
these traits more complex, intrinsically more difficult to measure, 
Jess important in life, or are there other causes? Draw up a list 
of possible explanations. . 
8. Have women accomplished as much as men in the fields of 
art, literature, or science? How do you account for any discrep- 
ancies found? What biological and environmental as well as 
psychological factors might be important? 
9. Is a judgment concerning an individual’s cheerfulness usually 
as valuable as one concerning his efficiency? Why? 
10. Which will usually tell you most about an individual’s mental 
equipment, a knowledge of his race or a knowledge of the traits 
of -his parents? 
11. Draw a curve of distribution which will show how we dis- 
“tort the facts when we assume that individuals are divided into 
types. 
12. What traits, other than those mentioned in the text, do you 
think may contribute to success in school work or life? What 
ones to desirable moral adjustments? To musical ability? To 
dramatic ability? To executive ability? 
' 18. Among your acquaintances, do desirable traits seem to go 
together? Try this out by rating them in several traits such as 
intelligence, personal appearance, health, popularity, and trust- 
worthiness and compare the results with the distributions shown 
at the end of Chapter XVI. Is the correlation positive or negative? 
14. To what practical uses, in education or elsewhere, may the 
facts of correlation among desirable traits be put? Do they make 
measures of intelligence more or less significant than would be 
the case if the correlations among traits were nearly zero?

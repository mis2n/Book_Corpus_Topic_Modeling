The number of persons who assisted in securing the data 
used in this study is too large for the writer to mention the 
names individually in this brief acknowledgment. The list 
includes the names of many superintendents, supervisors, 
principals, and teachers in the cities in which the problems 
were given. The writer is very grateful to these persons 
for their valuable assistance, without which the study could 
not have been completed. He wishes to express sincere 
gratitude to Dr. Thomas Alexander, formerly of George 
Peabody College for Teachers, but now of Teachers College, 
Columbia University, for valuable inspiration and guidance 
during the early stages of the study; to Dr. S. C. Garrison 
and Dr. Joseph Peterson, of George Peabody College for 
Teachers, for valuable suggestions and criticisms during the 
progress of the undertaking; and particularly to Dr. Shel- 
ton Phelps, of George Peabody College for Teachers, for 
guidance and direction during the course of the study to its

  CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
It is probable that oral testing is the oldest method of 
testing in existence. There can be no doubt that the early 
teachers, who had few books and little materials for writ- 
ing purposes, resorted to the oral test as a means of ascer- 
taining the progress made by their pupils. Oral testing 
continues to. be an important part of the everyday class- 
room procedure in most schools. It happens, however, that 
little or no record is made of the results obtained by the oral 
tests. The records that are made are usually based solely 
on the subjective opinion of the teacher. Little effort has 
been made to standardize any tests for oral use in connection 
with achievement. 
In mental testing the situation is quite different. Most 
individual tests make extensive use of oral procedure, both 
in getting the problems before the subject and in the solu- 
tion by the subject. Binet used oral procedure in most of 
his tests.1. The problems used by Binet were taken from the 
lists used by Vaney, a student of Binet’s, in his studies in 
1905.2. The arithmetical processes comprised a very im- 
portant part of his work. Most of the revisions of the 
Binet-Simon tests have made the same extensive use of oral 
work. Terman followed the example of Binet in most of 
the exercises. Two of his tests are strictly of the arith- 
metical type. In one instance* the subject is allowed to read 
the problems and give the solutions without the use of pencil 
and paper, a time limit of one minute beng imposed for 
each problem. In another instance* the problems are given 
orally, and the subject is required to give the steps in the 
solution orally as he proceeds. Other revisions of the 
Binet-Simon tests follow oral methods. Yerkes and Foster® 
use it in most instances, as does Herring in his revision.® 
Personnel officials in the World War found the oral test 
a convenient and valuable means of ascertaining the fitness 
of individuals for particular positions. Chapman has set 
down the oral trade tests used in determining the extent to 
which individuals had mastered certain trades.7. On the

basis of answers to questions asked by the interviewer, men 
were classified with respect to their status in the trades to 
which the tests applied. 
Studies of fatigue carried out by Thorndike in 1900,° and 
later in 19119, made use of mental multiplication as a means 
of determining the extent to which certain labors affected 
the mental processes. He used such numbers as 762 x 649, 
requiring the subject to perform the entire operation with- 
out the use of pencil and paper. In 1912, Arait® made sim- 
ilar uses of mental multiplication in her study of mental 
fatigue. She employed the multiplication of such numbers 
as 2645x5784. At first she tried the performance with 
the numbers before her, but later the numbers were held 
in mind after a short survey of them and the entire perform- 
ance was carried out without the use of pencil and paper. 
THE PROBLEM 
Since objective testing is the means employed in measur- 
ing most phases of educational achievement where written 
communication is employed, it appears that objective tests 
for oral use have a legitimate place in the category of edu- 
cational tools. This study relates to oral problem solving 
in grades four, five, six, seven, and eight. The term “oral 
problem” as used in this study refers to an arithmetical 
problem which is presented to the class orally and which is 
solved without the use of pencil and paper, the only use of 
these instruments allowed being that required in writing 
down the answer when it is found. The study centers 
around the following problems: (1) The determination of . 
the relative positions of certain arithmetic problems with 
respect to the average problem for the different grades 
when the problems are used for oral solution; (2) the de- 
termination of grade differences in ability to solve oral 
problems; (3) the preparation of certain tests by means of 
which the ability of children to solve oral problems may be 
measured; and (4) the establishment of grade norms for 
the tests. 
EXTENT AND LIMITATIONS 
The study is confined to results obtained from 8,366 chil- 
dren in grades four, five, six, seven, and eight in thirty-two 
cities of nine states. The children were selected in the type 
of school usually found in the states included. The general 
distribution of the schools between city and small towns

Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 9 
leads to the belief that the results found are typical of what 
may ‘be expected in general throughout the country. The 
number of children attempting each problem varies from 
103 to 478. In most cases the number is above 200. In 
all cases it was found that the scorer could predict, after 
checking a comparatively small number of papers, the prob- 
lems which would be most frequently missed. The age- 
grade distribution of the children is very similar to that 
which is usually found in the grades under consideration in 
schools in general. It shows a large number of children of 
normal age, a comparatively large number over age, and a 
comparatively small number under age for the grade in 
which they are classified. 
The extent of the undertaking made it impossible for the 
same children to attempt the entire list of problems. How- 
ever, it has been generally assumed by other investigators 
that the distribution of abilities of children in the same 
grade are, on the average, approximately the same when 
large numbers are involved. Again, it may be said that it 
would have been desirable for one person to dictate all the 
problems in all classes. The plan of having the classroom 
teacher dictate the problems to her class according to direc- 
tions for the procedure and under the supervision of the 
superintendent or principal is in accord with the practice 
followed by other investigators. This plan is the only one 
which can be followed in any extensive use of tests in class- 
room procedure. 
There is no doubt that many failures in the solution of 
the problems were due to defects of hearing on the part 
of certain children in the room, and others were likely 
due to inability to hold the statement of the problems in 
mind long enough to complete the solution. These factors 
would constitute a valuable study. It is left for some future 
investigation to show the relation between ability to solve 
problems when they are presented orally and solved without 
the use of pencil and paper and when they are presented in 
the usual written form and solved without pencil and paper.

CHAPTER II 
SECURING THE DATA 
SOURCES OF PROBLEMS 
A list of problems for use in testing the achievement of 
school children should consist of the general types of prob- 
lems which the children are accustomed to solve in their 
regular school work. In order to secure a list of problems 
of the types generally familiar to children in the elementary 
grades, three series of textbooks* which are in general use 
in elementary schools were used as sources of problems. In 
each case the three-book series was used. These texts gave 
a fairly wide range of problems, varying from the very sim- 
ple to the very difficult. 
Two types of problems were taken from the texts. All 
the problems suggested for oral solution were canvassed in 
order to select those which were so worded that the answers 
could be stated in a single set of figures. In addition to the 
problems selected from the oral lists, certain others were 
taken from those set down for written solution. After the 
canvass of the texts was completed, a few additional prob- 
lems were made up for the list in order to bring the number 
to that which had been decided upon as desirable for the 
experiment. 
SELECTING THE PROBLEMS 
The first book in a series was canvassed in order to select 
from it such problems as might be used. The problems were 
listed in the order in which they appeared in the text. In 
a few instances, where it appeared necessary, the statement 
of the problems was slightly changed in order that the an- 
swers might be simply stated. This first book yielded a list 
of problems, most of which were simple. The second book 
of the series was canvassed in the same manner. And, 
finally, the third book was gone over to select the problems 
which it contained that were suitable for oral solution. 
The other two series of books were subjected to the same 
procedure. 
When the canvass of the texts was completed, the list was 
composed of somewhat fewer than five hundred problems. 
As five hundred had been arbitrarily decided upon as the 
number to use in the experiment, certain additional prob-

Drushel, Noonan, and Withers.
-P-A-G-E-11
  
  Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 11 
lems were added until the list numbered five hundred prob- 
lems. 
ARRANGEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS 
Since the relative difficulty of the problems was not 
known, it was impossible to arrange them according to diffi- 
culty. It was decided that the problems should be ar- 
ranged promiscuously—that is, with the seemingly difficult 
and the simple intermingled freely. Just what effect such 
an arrangement of problems has on the number of correct 
solutions which children are able to make has not been de- 
termined. A carefully controlled experiment to determine 
the effect of the arrangement of difficult and simple prob- 
lems on the scores made by children in the grades should be 
made at some future time. Since the evidence which such 
an experiment will yield was not available, the plan of pro- 
miscuous arrangement was decided upon. 
In order to secure this promiscuous arrangement of prob- 
lems, they were arranged in an entirely different order 
from that in which they had been copied from the texts. 
The first problem in the list was placed first and numbered 
1, the twenty-first was placed next and numbered 2, the 
forty-first was placed next and numbered 38, the sixty-first 
was placed next and numbered 4, and so on in this manner 
until the four hundred and eighty-first problem was reached. 
It was numbered 25. The process was begun over, and the 
second problem from the original list was placed in the 
twenty-sixth place, the twenty-second in the twenty-seventh 
place, and so on through the list until all the problems were 
arranged according to this scheme. The numbers given the 
problems in this arrangement were maintained throughout 
the entire experiment. The problems are referred to by 
number in all later discussions. 
As it was impossible that the entire set of five hundred 
problems be given all groups of children included in the 
experiment, the problems were divided into five sets of one 
hundred problems each. The first set consisted of prob- 
lems numbered from one to one hundred, inclusive; the 
second set, those from one hundred one to two hundred; 
the third set, those from two hundred one to three hun- 
dred; the fourth set, those from three hundred one to 
four hundred; and the fifth set, those from four hundred 
one to five hundred. This procedure is in accord with that 
followed by other investigators. Ayres,! in the prepara- 
tion of the Ayres Spelling Scale, divided the words into sets 
of twenty each. In his work each teacher gave her class 
‘Ayres, L. P.: A Measuring Scale for Ability in Spelling, p. 21.
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 
twenty words to spell; in this experiment each teacher gave 
her class one hundred problems to solve. 
SECURING CO-OPERATION FOR THE EXPERIMENT 
It was desirable that the assistance of a large number of 
people be secured in order that the carrying out of the ex- 
periment might not be too burdensome to those who. aided 
in the undertaking. In order that the problems might be 
administered as nearly uniformly as possible, it was neces- 
sary to secure the codperation of superintendents and prin- 
cipals who were familiar with the administration of stand- 
ardized tests. In order to secure a select list of names of 
superintendents and principals, the members of Psi Chap- 
ter, Phi Delta Kappa,* were requested to furnish the names 
of individuals who they thought would be willing to codéper- 
ate in the undertaking. The importance of securing the 
assistance of people who were familiar with the adminis- 
tration of standardized tests was impressed upon the per- 
sons who furnished the names. The following blank was 
used for listing the names: 
Please list below the names of superintendents or principals among 
your acquaintances who you think will be willing to codperate in an 
experiment with oral arithmetic problems. Where possible, please 
give the names of persons who have had experience in the administra- 
tion of standardized tests. Yours very truly, 
M. S. RoBERTSON. 
Person furnishing names. 
       Name 
A letter requesting his codperation in the experiment was 
sent to each superintendent and principal whose name was 
furnished. In this letter, a copy of which is shown below, 
the person addressed was informed that his name was fur- 
nished by a particular individual. This personal mention 
of the party who furnished a name was used in order to 
secure better codperation on the part of those to whom the 
letters were sent. It was thought that a person would be 
more likely to assist in the undertaking if he knew who was 
responsible for the request being sent to him. An infor- 
mation sheet was included in the letter. This sheet was

necessary in order that the information concerning the 
amount of materials to be sent each codperating superin-

101 4 EES RSENS Sees es suggested you as a person who would codper- 
ate with me in an experiment in oral problem solving in grades four, 
five, six, seven, and eight. 
It is my plan to standardize a list of oral arithmetic problems from 
which a teacher may select a test or exercise for the children and 
measure their ability to solve oral arithmetic problems as compared to 
the ability of other children of the same age and grade throughout the 
country. Briefly stated, the plan is as follows: 
I have prepared a list of five hundred problems. These are 
divided into five sets of one hundred problems each. One or 
more of these sets will be sent to each principal or superin- 
tendent who wishes to codperate with me in the experiment. 
The classroom teachers, acting under the superintendent’s 
direction, will dictate the problems to their pupils, giving 
about twenty problems each day at the regular arithmetic 
period or at some other time set for this work by the superin- 
tendent and the teacher. By giving the problem at the regu- 
lar arithmetic period there is no interference with the regu- 
lar work, as the problems will serve as excellent material for 
problem solving. 
All papers will be collected and sent to me. All checking 
and tabulating will be done directly under my supervision. 
Age and grade norms will be established for the several 
grades mentioned above. 
There is no expense whatever on the part of your office. I pay all 
charges on materials which are sent out and returned to me. A copy 
of the scale will be sent you when it is completed if you desire it. 
If you are willing to codperate with me in this experiment, kindly 
let me know at your earliest convenience, giving the information called 
for on the inclosed sheet.

experiment, I am,

  Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 15 
The superintendents and principals who agreed to coédp- 
erate in the experiment were divided into five groups. The 
basis on which the division was made was the number of 
children in the different grades to whom the problems were 
to be given. Since it: was desirable to have each one hun- 
dred problems given to approximately as many children in 
each grade as each other hundred problems, the groups were 
formed with a view to securing this end. Each group was 
to use one hundred problems for the purpose of the experi- 
ment. 
The following materials were sent to each person who had 
agreed to codperate in the undertaking: 
A sufficient number of copies of one set of the problems 
for each teacher who was to be used in giving the problems 
to have a copy. 
A sufficient number of directions sheets for each teacher 
to have one. 
A sufficient number of answer sheets for each pupil tested 
to have an answer sheet. 
The directions sheet and one copy of the answer sheet are 
shown below. This answer form is for the first one hun- 
dred problems. The other four were exact duplicates of 
this one, except that the numbers used corresponded with the 
numbers for the problems comprising the set with which 
they were to be used. 
DIRECTIONS FOR GIVING PROBLEMS 
1. All members of the class should remove everything from their 
desks except well-sharpened pencils. Each child should have 
one or more pencils. It is well to have a few extra pencils in 
order that they may be supplied to pupils who break their pen- 
cil points during the exercise. 
2. Distribute the answer sheets, being sure that the numbers on the 
answer sheets correspond to the numbers of the problems which 
are to be dictated. 
3. Have children fill the information blanks at the top of the answer 
sheets. The person in charge of the test should see that all 
blanks are properly filled. It is very important that every 
child give his correct age at last birthday and that he give the 
correct date of his next birthday. 
4. The following instructions should be read to the class. Be sure 
that these instructions are understood by all pupils. 
I am going to read you some oral arithmetic prob- 
lems. When I read a problem, you must listen at- 
tentively, because the problem will not be read a sec- 
ond time. Solve the problem—get the answer—as 
quickly as you can without the use of pencil and 
paper. When you have the answer, write it in the 
space marked “Answer.” Put the answer to exam- 
ple 1 in the answer column beside example 1, the 
answer to example 2 in the answer column beside
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 
example 2, and continue in this way for all the exer- 
cises, 
You must not ask questions about any problem. 
Listen closely during the reading; then you may 
think the problem over in your mind in any manner 
that you like in order to solve it; but do not ask 
any questions about it or speak to any person while 
the problems are being dictated. If you cannot get 
the answer to a problem, make an “X” in the space 
for the answer and wait for the teacher to give the 
next one. 
5. When you are sure that all the pupils understand what they are 
to do, read the first problem slowly and distinctly and wait for 
the children to fill in the answer on the answer sheet. If the 
pupils continue to struggle to get the answer to a problem when 
you feel that they cannot solve it, tell them to make an “X” in 
the answer space, and proceed to dictate the next problem. Be- 
fore reading each problem, call the number of the problem to be 
read, as— 
“Number, fis... -25 ,” the reading following; 
then, 
““Numabens 2222 5255 »’ continuing in this way for all the 
exercises. 
6. When you have finished for the day, collect all papers and put 
them away until you are ready to continue the work. 
7. On the following day, have the papers passed back to the pupils, 
being sure that each person gets his own paper. When all have 
their papers, say to them: 
We are going to solve some more oral arithmetic 
problems like the ones we had yesterday. Remember 
that the problems will be read only one time. When 
you get the answer to a problem, write it down in 
the answer column just as you did yesterday. 
8. pcan the exercises from day to day until you have completed 
the list. 
9. In the event a pupil takes part of the problems one day and is 
absent a day, let him omit all problems that were given the 
day he was absent. Be sure that he puts the answers to prob- 
lems that are dictated by the numbers for examples which cor- 
respond to them. 
10. When the work is completed, collect all answer sheets and send 
them to the principal or superintendent, who will forward 
them to

18 Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 
In order to ascertain the general distribution of the chil- 
dren in the experiment as to grade and age, they were 
placed in a table showing the ages and grades. A copy of 
this age-grade table is shown below. It will be noted that 
the general form of the distribution is that which is usually 
found in age-grade tables. There is a comparatively large 
group of children in each grade who are of normal age, a 
comparatively small number who are under age for the 
grade, and a third group of children who are over age for 
their grades. This last group is large when compared to 
the under-age group. It is to be noted that the children 
tested ranged from six to eighteen years of age. There is 
a very wide age range in any one grade. A very valuable 
experiment might be conducted in which only those chil- 
dren would be used whose ages are normal for the grades in 
which they are classified. It would prove valuable to ascer- 
tain the comparative scores of grades when all children are 
included and when only those of normal age are included.

CHAPTER III 
HANDLING THE DATA: SCORING, TABULATING, 
AND STATISTICAL TREATMENT 
SCORING AND TABULATING THE RESULTS 
In order that all the problems might be checked under 
like conditions, the answer sheets were checked by persons 
employed by and directly under the supervision of the 
writer. These persons were all college students who had 
had from one to seven years’ training above that received 
in high school. All were urged to use the greatest care to 
check all answers correctly. No emphasis was placed on 
the speed with which checking was done. This was held 
aside in order that greater accuracy might be obtained. 
To facilitate checking, the correct answers to problems 
were written on sheets of paper in columns that corre- 
sponded exactly to those used by the children for answers. 
The person doing the checking laid the answer sheet beside 
the column of answers to be checked. Every incorrect an- 
swer was checked with a red checking pencil. This mark 
was readily distinguished from those which had been placed 
on the papers by the children. All answers were either 
right or wrong. No credit was given unless the correct 
answer was found. The ages of children were next writ- 
ten in red ink in the upper right-hand corner of the sheets. 
Ages were expressed in periods of six months. Each child 
was considered of a given age until he reached the next age 
interval. For example, a child was considered ten years 
of age until he reached the actual age of ten years and six 
months; he was considered ten years and six months of age 
until he reached the actual age of eleven years. This method 
was followed for each six-months’ period. The papers 
were grouped according to the age and grade of the chil- 
dren. All papers done by children of a given age and grade 
were placed in a pile. This was done for each age-grade 
group. 
Different tabulation sheets were prepared for each age 
group of each grade. This necessitated a large number of 
tabulation sheets. Each sheet was supplied with numbers 
down the left-hand margin, the numbers corresponding to 
the problems which were to be checked on the sheets. At

the top of each sheet the age and grade for which it was 
intended were written. The first line was used for totals 
for the twenty-five problems that followed. Immediately 
following the numbers for the twenty-five problems, an- 
other line was set apart for the totals for the next twenty- 
five problems. The following sample illustrates the type of 
tabulation sheet used: 
GRADE 5, AGE 10-6

In order to show that a problem was correctly solved, a 
short oblique line was drawn in the space to the right of the 
number on the score sheet which represented the problem. 
Every fifth line was drawn across the preceding four. This 
furnished a simple and effective means of counting the to- 
tals by fives when the checking was completed. 
The total correct solutions for each problem were care- 
fully checked to avoid mistakes. The totals for a given 
problem for all the children in a grade were found by find- 
ing the sum of the rights for each age group in the grade. 
This was done by means of a calculating machine. One per- 
son called the numbers and another entered the values on 
the calculating machine. The totals were entered on score 
sheets prepared for the purpose. The number of children 
in each grade attempting each problem and the number of 
correct solutions are shown in Table II. 
Table II is read: Problems 1 to 25 were attempted by 
205 fourth-grade children, 458 fifth-grade children, 466 
sixth-grade children, 473 seventh-grade children, and 417 
eighth-grade children. Of the 205 fourth-grade children 
attempting problem 1, 186 solved it correctly; of the 458 
fifth-grade children attempting problem 1, 441 solved it cor- 
rectly. The other values are read in the same manner.

Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 31 
In order to get a means of measuring the difficulty of 
problems for the different grades, the number of correct 
solutions for each grade for each problem was reduced to 
per cent of the total attempts. This was done on a calcu- 
lating machine, and all values were checked by means of a 
slide rule. Table III shows the per cent of correct solutions 
for each problem by grades. The numbering of problems in 
this table and in all subsequent tables is the same as that 
used in Table II and in the list of problems found in the Ap- 
pendix. 
Table III is read: Problem 1 was correctly solved by 90.7 
per cent of the fourth-grade children, 96.3 per cent of the 
fifth-grade children, 97.6 per cent of the sixth-grade chil- 
dren, 98.9 per cent of the seventh-grade children, and 99.3 
per cent of the eighth-grade children.

Certain fundamental assumptions were necessary before 
proceeding to find the relative difficulty of the problems.   
*Since Table III is derived directly from Table II, only a sample of it is given 
here. The complete table is on file in the original manuscript in the Library at 
George Peabody College for Teachers.

  82 Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 
The assumptions used here are the familiar ones used by 
Buckingham,! Woody,? Van Wagenen,’ Ayres,‘ and others 
who have constructed scales. First, it is assumed that the 
abilities of children of a given age or grade to solve oral 
arithmetic problems are distributed according to the normal 
probability curve. The second assumption is that the abili- 
ties of children in the different grades are distributed in 
approximately the same manner. 
It follows from these assumptions that a problem which 
is correctly solved by 50 per cent of the children in a grade 
is of average difficulty for that grade, one which is cor- 
rectly solved by more than 50 per cent of the children is of 
less than average difficulty for the grade, and one which 
is correctly solved by less than 50 per cent of the chil- 
dren is of more than average difficulty for the grade. The 
per cent of correct solutions for each problem for each 
grade was subtracted from 50 per cent to get the deviation 
from the average for the different grades. The values 
found by this process are given in Table IV. The values 
found for problems of more than average difficulty are 
shown in the table with no sign before them, while the val- 
ues for problems that are of less than average difficulty are 
preceded by the minus sign. 
Table IV is read: Problem 1 varied from the fourth-grade 
average by —40.7 per cent; from the fifth-grade average, 
by —46.3 per cent; from the sixth-grade average, by —47.6 
per cent; from the seventh-grade average, by —48.9 per 
cent ; and from the eighth-grade average, by —49.3 per cent. 
The other values are read in the same manner. 
The per cent value that a problem deviates from the aver- 
age is not a correct measure of the relative difficulty® of that 
problem as compared to others. A specific example will 
clarify this point. Consider the difference between two 
problems which are solved by 58 per cent and 68 per cent of 
the children in a grade as compared with the difference be- 
tween two others which are correctly solved by 88 per cent 
and 98 per cent, respectively. If the difference in per cent 
is taken as a measure, the two differences are equal, each 
being 10. This, however, is not true. The latter difference 
is nearly four times as great as the former. In the first in- 
stance the difference is .2658 sigma, while in the second 
instance the difference is .8787 sigma.

the average in sigma units. This was done by referring 
each per cent variation to the probability table.6 The val- 
ues found were arranged in Table V. This table shows the 
variation of the problems from the mean in sigma units. 
In taking values from the table, only three decimal places 
were retained, as it was thought that this number was suf- 
ficiently accurate for any practical use. 
Table V is read as follows: Problem 1 is 1.323 standard 
deviation units below the average problem in difficulty for 
the fourth grade, 1.787 standard deviation units below the 
average problem in difficulty for the fifth grade, 1.977 stand- 
ard deviation units below the average problem in difficulty 
for the sixth grade, 2.290 standard deviation units below 
the average problem in difficulty for the seventh grade, and 
2.457 standard deviation units below the average problem 
in difficulty for the eighth grade. The deviations for the 
other problems are read in the same manner.   
*Since Table IV is derived directly from Table III, only a sample of it is shown 
here. The complete table is on file in the original manuscript in the Library at 
George Peabody College for Teachers.

SUMMARY 
This chapter shows the methods employed in scoring, 
tabulating, and treating the data used in this study. Table II 
contains two things: (1) the number of children attempting 
each problem, and (2) the number of children solving each 
problem correctly. Table III gives the per cent of the children 
in each grade that solved each problem correctly, and Table 
IV shows the deviation of each problem from the different 
grade averages in per cent. Table V gives the deviations 
from the grade averages in sigma units. Values taken 
from this table may be averaged, since they are composed of 
units which are equal at all points. In Table V the prob- 
lems are scaled for difficulty for the different grades. When 
problems are selected from the list for a test, Table V should 
be used, since problems may be selected here that are of 
equal value or that differ in difficulty by any desired degree.

CHAPTER IV 
GRADE DIFFERENCES IN ACHIEVEMENT 
In order to determine the differences in grade achieve- 
ment, the differences in standard deviation units from the 
means for all problems were found. This method takes into 
consideration the relative difficulty of the problems which 
are used for a test. Woody used this method as the most 
important element in measuring the differences between the 
grades in his study of arithmetic abilities. Table V was 
referred to in order to get the deviations of the respective 
problems from the several grade means. The differences 
between these values for each. grade and the next higher 
grade were found. The values found in this way show the 
number of standard deviation units which a grade exceeds 
the next lower grade in solving each specific problem. Re- 
ferring to Table V, it is seen that problem 1 is 1.323 stand- 
ard deviation units below the fourth-grade mean in difficulty 
and 1.787 standard deviation units below the fifth-grade 
mean in difficulty. The differences between these values is 
.464 standard deviation units. Hence, the fifth grade ex- 
ceeds the fourth grade .464 standard deviation units when 
measured by problem 1 alone. Similar values were found 
for all problems for the different grades. Table VI shows 
the values found for all grade differences. 
Table VI is read: When problem 1 is taken as a measure, 
grade five excels grade four by .464 sigma, grade six excels 
grade five by .190 sigma, grade seven excels grade six by 
.313 sigma, and grade eight excels grade seven by .167 
sigma. The differences when the other problems are taken 
as measures are read in the same manner.

In order to get the average number of standard deviation 
units which each grade excelled the next lower grade, the 
values given in Table VI were thrown into a frequency dis-

tribution. For the purpose of tabulation, intervals of .1 
sigma were used. Since a grade sometimes fell below the 
next lower grade on a particular problem, places for nega- 
tive values as well as positive values were provided. The 
frequencies found for the five hundred problems are shown 
in Table VII. 
Table VII is read: The seventh grade excelled the sixth 
grade by an interval between 2.100 sigma and 2.199 sigma 
in the case of one problem; the eighth grade excelled the sev- 
enth grade by a like amount in the case of one problem. 
The other rows are read in the same manner.

The facts shown in Table VII are shown graphically in 
Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. These figures show the distinct linear- 
ity of the distributions. 
The arithmetic means of the columns shown in Table 
VII were found. These values, together with the probable 
error of the distributions, probable error of the means, and 
the overlapping of the grades, are shown in Table VIII. 
Table VIII is read: On the average, the fifth-grade mean 
exceeds the fourth-grade mean by .397 sigma units, the 
sixth-grade mean exceeds the fifth-grade mean by .464 
sigma, the seventh-grade mean exceeds the sixth-grade 
mean by .442 sigma,.and the eighth-grade mean exceeds the 
seventh-grade mean by .111 sigma. 
INTERPRETATION OF FACTS IN TABLE VIII 
If the entire list of five hundred problems are given to 
groups of children in grades four to eight, the chances are 
one to one that the fifth grade will excel the fourth grade by 
.397 sigma plus and minus .0116; that the sixth grade will 
excel the fifth grade by .464 sigma plus and minus .0116; 
that the seventh grade will excel the sixth grade by .442 
sigma plus and minus .0107; and that the eighth grade will 
excel the seventh grade by .111 sigma plus and minus .0084.

Consider the conditions which may be expected if a single 
problem selected at random from the five hundred is used as 
a test in grades four to eight. In this case it is found that 
the chances are one to one that the fifth grade will excel the 
fourth grade by .3897 sigma plus and minus .261; the sixth 
grade will excel the fifth grade by .464 sigma plus and minus 
.260; the seventh grade will excel the sixth grade by .442 
sigma plus and minus .240; and the eighth grade will excel 
the seventh grade by .111 sigma plus and minus .187. 
Table VIII also shows that, on the average, 346 children 
in every 1,000 in the fourth grade equal or excel the aver- 
age fifth-grade child in oral problem solving; on the aver- 
age, 321 children in every 1,000 in the fifth grade equal or 
excel the average sixth-grade child; on the average, 329 
children in every 1,000 in the sixth grade equal or excel the 
average seventh-grade child; and on the average, 456 chil- 
dren in every 1,000 in the seventh grade equal or excel the 
average eighth-grade child. Looking at it from the angle 
of the children in a higher grade as compared with those in 
the next lower grade, it is seen that, on the average, there are 
654 children in every 1,000 in the fifth grade who equal or 
excel the average fourth-grade child, 679 children in the 
sixth grade who equal or excel the average fifth-grade child, 
671 children in the seventh grade who equal or excel the 
average sixth-grade child, and 544 children in the eighth 
grade who equal or excel the average seventh-grade child. 
The facts in the last two rows of Table VIII may be inter- 
preted in a similar manner to that which has been given for 
the two preceding rows. 
SUMMARY 
This chapter shows two definite facts: 
1. It reveals the differences in achievement in oral prob- 
lem solving that exist between the successive grades in- 
cluded in the study (a) when any particular problem in the 
series is taken as a test and (b) when the entire series of 
problems is taken as the test. 
2. It shows the overlapping which exists between the suc- 
cessive grades in oral problem-solving ability. In other 
words, it shows the per cent of children in each grade that 
equals or excels the average child in the next higher grade 
in oral problem solving, and vice versa.

CHAPTER V 
USE OF THE PROBLEMS FOR TESTING PURPOSES 
SELECTING PROBLEMS FOR A TEST 
If a series of problems for testing a single grade is de- 
sired, it is necessary for one to determine the degree of 
difficulty of the test he wishes to give before selecting the 
problems from the list. The problems can be taken directly 
from Table V. Suppose that one desires to select a test for 
sixth-grade children on which they may be expected to make 
an average score of approximately 50 per cent correct solu- 
tions. Since there are very few problems which were 
solved by exactly 50 per cent of the children, it is desirable 
to take limits of .1 sigma on either side of the score of 50 
per cent. These limits include problems on which sixth- 
grade children score 50 plus and minus 4 per cent, approxi- 
mately. Such problems are found in numbers 9, 15, 36, 59, 
61, 112, etc. These problems are selected by referring to 
Table V and listing all problems that are within .1 sigma of 
the sixth-grade mean. The problems so selected may be 
given to sixth-grade children with the expectation that they 
will make scores of 50 per cent correct solutions on the 
average, provided the scoring is done as explained in a later 
paragraph. 
A series of problems to be given as a test in grades four 
to eight should be selected in such a manner that the norm 
for the fourth grade will not be too low and at the same time 
so that the norm for the eighth grade will not be too high. 
In the first case, the problems would prove so difficult for 
the class that they would not make a valuable test for use 
in it, while in the latter case, they would be so simple that 
they would not give an adequate measure. It appears that 
a problem on which sixth-grade children make an average 
score of 75 per cent is reasonably well chosen, since the sixth 
grade lies midway between the two extreme grades that are 
to be tested. In selecting the list of problems for Test I, 
the assumption given above was used, and only those prob- 
lems were included on which sixth-grade children made a 
score of approximately 75 per cent. 
Since a problem which is correctly solved by 75 per cent 
of sixth-grade children is of 25 per cent of the total distri- 
bution less than average difficulty for this grade, the nor- 
mal probability table! was consulted to determine how much 
‘Kelley, Truman L.: Statistical Method, Appendix C.
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 
such a problem varied from the average for the grade in 
standard deviation units. It was found that such a prob- 
lem was —.674 sigma units from the grade average. One- 
tenth sigma was added to and subtracted from this value. 
This gave the two limits, —.574 sigma and —.774 sigma, 
between which problems might be selected. Problems 
within these limits lie within the per cent limits, 71.7 and 
78.1. It is seen that no problem varies from the actual 
score made by sixth-grade children by more than 3.8 per 
cent. 
Table V was consulted in order to select a list of problems 
whose standard deviation variations were within the limits 
—.574 sigma and —.774 sigma for the sixth-grade mean. 
The problems were listed in the order in which they occurred 
in Table V. The standard deviation from each grade mean 
was copied in columns for the respective grades beside the 
numbers representing the problems. Any problem which 
did not decrease in difficulty for each successive grade was 
omitted from the list. The list of problems selected for

Test I and the deviations from the respective grade means 
are shown in Table IX. 
Table IX is read: Problem 21 varies from the fourth- 
grade mean by .292 sigma units; from the fifth-grade mean, 
by —.319 sigma units; from the sixth-grade mean, by —.706 
sigma units; from the seventh-grade mean, by —1.024 
sigma units; and from the eighth-grade mean, by —1.211 
sigma units. The other rows are read in the same manner. 
The arithmetic mean of each column in Table IX was 
found. This gave the average deviation of the problems 
from the respective grade means. Each of the average 
deviations was referred to the probability table to ascertain 
the deviation from the grade means in per cent. The per- 
cent value thus obtained was algebraically subtracted from 
50 per cent. The value found in the last process was as- 
signed as the norm for the particular grade. A study of 
Table X will give a clear idea of what was done. The arith- 
metic mean for the column headed “IV” in Table IX, the 
fourth-grade column, is —.033. The probability table? 
shows that a problem which varies from the average in 
difficulty by —.033 sigma varies from the average by —01.0 
per cent. When —01.0 per cent is subtracted from 50 per 
cent, the remainder is 51 per cent.. Hence, the fourth-grade 
norm for this series of problems is 51 per cent. 
Table X is read (reading down the fourth-grade column) : 
On the average, the problems in Test I vary from the fourth- 
grade mean by —.033 sigma; on the average, they vary 
from the fourth-grade mean by —01.0 per cent; on the aver- 
age, problems in this test should be correctly solved by 51

per cent of the fourth-grade children. The other columns 
are read in the same manner. 
If Test I is given as an oral problem-solving test to chil- 
dren in grades four, five, six, seven, and eight under condi- 
tions which prevailed when the problems were given in this 
experiment, the classes may be expected to make scores 
which, on the average, approximate those given for norms 
in Table X. 
METHODS OF SCORING 
Two general methods may be used in scoring answers 
when this test is used. In each case all answers are scored 
either right or wrong. Only rights are counted. The sim- 
plest way of scoring is to consider all problems of equal 
weight. In this case the score made by any individual is 
the number of correct answers divided by the number of 
problems in the test, eighteen in Test I. This method of 
scoring is not scientifically accurate. In general, it will 
yield a score that is somewhat higher than the child’s true 
score, since children will in most instances tend to solve the 
easier problems correctly and miss the more difficult ones. 
Scores secured in this way will probably be sufficiently ac- 
curate for most purposes. It will, at least, be worth while 
to ascertain the relationship which exists between scores 
secured in this way and those secured when the more com- 
plicated method given below is employed. 
A method of scoring the problems, to be accurate, must 
make use of the relative difficulty of the problems for the 
particular grade for which they are being scored. In order 
to determine the relative difficulty of the problems in Test 
I, it was assumed that any problem which is three sigma 
below the average in difficulty for the grade in question is 
of zero difficulty for children in the grade. Such an as- 
sumption disregards .143 of 1 per cent of the cases at each 
end of the distribution (this amounts to .286 of 1 per cent 
of the entire distribution). Roughly speaking, it means 
that a little less than three cases in every thousand are dis- 
regarded in the assumption. Putting it another way, it 
means that problems which are solved correctly by 99.714 
per cent of the children in a grade are considered of zero 
difficulty for them. The few cases in which such a problem 
is missed by such children are attributed to chance rather 
than to the inability of the children to solve the problem. 
It must be observed that the assumption of a zero point 
is fraught with grave dangers. The relative difficulty of 
problems may be changed very much by taking different 
points as zero: An illustration will serve to make this clear.
-P-A-G-E-65
  
  Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 65 
Let us take two problems, one of which is 2 sigma above the 
average for a class in difficulty and the other 2 sigma below 
the average for the class. Consider the relative value of 
these two problems when the zero point is located at —2.5 
sigma, —3.0 sigma, and —5.0 sigma. When —2.5 sigma 
is the zero point, the two problems have the values, 4.5 and 
.5, and the ratio is 4.5 divided by .5, or 9. When —3.0 
sigma is the zero point, the values are 5 and 1, and the ratio 
is 5 divided by 1, or 5. However, when —5.0 sigma is the 
zero point, the values are 7 and 8, and the ratio is 2.38. The 
assumption of a zero point at —3.0 sigma avoids the ex- 
tremes and at the same time disregards a very small part of 
the cases involved. 
Making use of the above-mentioned assumption, the de- 
viation of each problem from each grade mean was added 
algebraically to 3.0 sigma. Referring to Table IX, which 
gives the deviation of problems in Test I from the different 
grade means, it is found that problem 21 deviates from the 
fourth-grade mean by .292 sigma; 8 sigma plus .292 sigma 
gives 3.292 sigma. This problem has a value of 3.292 for

the fourth grade, while it has a value of 3 plus —.319, or 
2.681, for the fifth grade, a value of 3 plus —.706, or 2.294, 
for the sixth grade, and so on for the other grades. The 
difficulty values for all problems were found in this way. 
The relative difficulty of the problems in Test I are shown 
in Table XI. 
Table XI is read: Problem 21 has a difficulty value of 
8.292 for the fourth grade, 2.681 for the fifth grade, 2.294 
for the sixth grade, 1.976 for the seventh grade, and 1.789 
for the eighth grade. The other rows are read in the same 
manner. 
Since the grade norms are expressed in per cent, it is 
desirable to determine the per cent values that should be 
assigned to each problem for the different grades. In or- 
der to get the per cent values for the problems, 100 per cent 
was divided into eighteen parts in proportion to the diffi- 
culty values shown in Table XI for each grade. For exam- 
ple, the values in column IV of Table XI were added. One 
hundred per cent was divided by the sum obtained. Each 
difficulty value in column IV was then multiplied by the 
quotient. The values found are the per cent values for the 
different problems for grade four. The per cent values for 
the different problems for the other grades were found in 
the same manner. All values were carried to five decimal 
places. However, the values are shown only to the nearest 
tenth in Table XII, since this gradation is as minute as one 
will likely use in practical work. 
Table XII is read: Problem 21, when correctly solved, 
should be given a value of 6.3 for fourth grade, 5.6 for 
fifth grade, 5.5 for sixth grade, 5.4 for seventh grade, 5.6 
for eighth grade. The other rows are read in the same 
manner. 
To ascertain the score of an individual who is in the 
fourth grade and who has attempted to solve the prob-. 
lems in Test I, it is necessary to check the problems that are 
correctly solved. Look at Table XII and take the per cent 
values that are assigned the problems correctly solved from 
the fourth-grade column. The sum of these values is the 
score for the individual in per cent right. The score for a 
class may be obtained by finding the arithmetic mean of 
the scores made by the individuals who compose the class. 
Scores for pupils in other grades are found in the same 
manner, except that the per cent values assigned the prob- 
lems correctly solved must be taken from the column in 
Table XII for the grade in question.

PREPARATION OF TEST II 
The procedure given in detail for the preparation of 
Test I was followed in the preparation of Test II. The 
only difference was that in this case the limits within which 
problems were selected were —.373 sigma and —.573 sigma 
instead of —.774 and —.574, the values used for Test I. 
In preparing this test the attempt was made to select prob- 
lems which should be correctly solved by 68 per cent of the 
sixth-grade children. It was found that they should be cor-

RELIABILITY OF TESTS I AND II 
In order to get an estimate of the reliability of Tests I 
and II, they were given in grades four, five, and six of Pea- 
body Demonstration School. Scores were secured from 
99 cases about equally divided between the three grades rep- 
resented. The scores were reduced to per cent of class aver- 
age for each class in order that the 99 cases might be corre- 
lated without the use of any correction for grade. The 
scores found for the two tests were correlated by the Pear- 
son formula.? The results found are as follows: 
r= .661, P.E. r=.038, k= .75, N= 99 
The coefficient of reliability of the two tests when this 
number of cases is involved is .661. It may be expected 
that the relation coefficient will be at least as large as that 
found here. Kelley says in his discussion of the reliability 
coefficient : “We may expect in most mental and educational 
test work that the true reliability coefficient will be less 
than the obtained r,, and greater than the obtained r1I.’”’+ 
Since r1I is the value found above, one is justified in the 
conclusion that the reliability coefficient is as great as or 
greater than that found. 
Applying the formula® for determining the length of a 
test necessary to secure a desired reliability coefficient, it 
was found that the length of the tests would have to be mul- 
aoe by 4.62 in order to raise the coefficient of reliability 
‘0 .90.

  CHAPTER VI 
SUMMARY 
This study has attempted to ascertain certain facts about 
oral problem solving in grades four, five, six, seven, and 
eight. A list of 500 problems suitable for oral solution 
was given to 8,366 children in the grades under considera- 
tion. The difficulty of these problems in sigma units for 
the different grades has been determined. Table V shows 
the difficulty of the problems for the different grades in 
terms of deviation from the respective grade means in sigma 
units. This table also shows the comparative difficulty of 
the problems for the different grades. 
Grade differences in achievement are measured in sigma 
units. Table VI shows the differences for the successive 
grades on each problem included in the list. These differ- 
ences vary for different problems. The average of the dif- 
ferences for all the problems is probably the most reliable 
measure of difference between the two grades. Average 
differences are shown in Table VIII. These values for the 
respective grades are: IV-V, .397; V-VI, .464; VI-VII, .442; 
and VII-VIII, .111 sigma. The differences are reasonably 
near the same value in the first three instances. The dif- 
ference between the seventh and eighth grades is only 
about one-fourth as large as the difference between other 
consecutive grades. The small difference here is attrib- 
uted to the fact that arithmetic is not taught as a separate 
subject in the eighth grade in many of the schools included 
in the study. It appears that the increase in oral problem- 
solving ability of the eighth grade over the seventh grade is 
only about one-fourth as large as the increase for other 
grades over the next lower ones. The overlapping of the 
grades is approximately 33 per cent, except in the case of 
the seventh and eighth grades, where it is 45.6 per cent. 
Two illustrative tests have been set up in order to show 
how the problems may be used for testing purposes. Test 
I is composed of problems on which sixth-grade children 
should make an average score of 75 per cent, while Test II 
is composed of problems on which sixth-grade children 
should make an average score of 67.8 per cent. Grade 
norms were determined for the other grades by finding the 
arithmetic means of the sigma deviations from the respec- 
tive grade averages. These means, when referred to the 
probability table, gave the mean deviation of the problems 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  
Oral Problem Solving in the Elementary School 73 
from the grade averages in per cent. The average per cent 
deviation was subtracted from 50 per cent to get the grade 
norm. 
Two methods of scoring have been suggested. The sim- 
ple method of counting all problems in the test of equal 
value yields a somewhat higher score on the average than 
does the method which allows for the variation in difficulty 
of the problems. The weighted score values of the different 
problems were derived by assuming a zero point for each 
grade 8 sigma below the grade mean and adding the sigma 
deviation from the grade mean to this value. One hundred 
per cent was then divided into as many parts as there are 
problems in the respective tests in proportion to the diffi- 
culty values for the problems. The per cent values for the 
problems are used in scoring. 
The coefficient of reliability found by correlating the 
scores made on the two tests by 99 children in grades four, 
five, and six is .661 plus and minus .038.

REPORT. 
This report is not as complete as is desirable, and for the 
same reason given one year ago. 
County Superintendents will not report promptly to this 
Department, and the State Superintendent is powerless in his 
efforts to secure promptness. 
The school-laws give the State Superintendent guthority to 
appoint some one to make reports for the county failing to re- 
port at the time designated, and to allow such appointee such 
pay for his services as he may deem proper, the same to be paid 
by the delinquent County Superintendent. 
But this cannot be done. In many instances the County Su- 
perivtendent does not receive a salary sufficient to justify it, 
and whatever salary is allowed has been drawn for the year be- 
fore the State Superintendent knows of the failure to report. 
Just what should be done is the question. If it were a mis- 
demeanor, or punishable by fine, for a County. Superintendent 
to fail to report, I believe the trouble would end. 
County Superintendents complain, and say District Directors 
will not report, but such an excuse as this will not answer. Be- 
‘cause the District Clerk cannot draw his pay for services ren- 
dered except upon the warrant of the County Superintendent. 
This warrant the County Superintendent can withhold until 
the District Clerk has reported in full. Again, the school-year 
closes June 80, and the County Superintendent has from that 
date until October 1 to make his report to the State Superin- 
tendent, a time sufficient to visit each school-district and gather 
the statistics necessary for making the report.

The following counties have failed to make a report for the 
year ending June 30, 1890, viz.: Carter, Cheatham, Claiborne, 
Cocke, Henderson, Unicoi, and Wilson. 
The scholastic population as given in Table No. 1, is taken 
from the report of 1889. 
The following summaries will show the present condition of 
the public schools of the State, and a comparison of these with 
former years will give the growth of the system.

ScHooL- age.. 
I recommend that the school-law be amended so that the 
school-age shall be from six years to eighteen years of age. As 
it now is, we are carrying on our rolls a large number of per- 
sons between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years who - 
have completed the public school-course; and statistics will 
show that there are very few persons in school between those 
ages; and there is no good reason’ why pupils shall not com- 
plete the public school-course in any county in the State before 
they reach the age of eighteen. We are placed at a disadvan- 
tage when the report sent from this State is compared with that 
of other States, because on our rolls are found a larger number 
of pupils of school-age who are not enrolled in the public 
schools than is found in any other States. Persons comparing 
the statistics will not examine the fact that our school-age is 
from six to twenty-one years, but will look at this matter in 
the same light as that of the report with which it is compared, 
a majority of the States having a maximum limit of eighteen, 
and in some cases even less than that. There is no other State 
in the Union now that extends the school-age over such a long 
period of time.as is given in Tennessee. Many times the Su- 
perintendent is called upon to give the reason why in Tennessee 
so many pupils of school-age are not found in the public schools. 
This is easily answered, because they have completed the com- 
mon school-course and are no longer entitled to its privileges. 
A change in the law will deprive no one of the right of an educa- 
tion, but will put us on an equal footing as compared with other 
States, and enable us to show that we have ample provision for 
all the children of public school-age. - 
ScHooL-DISTRICTS. 
The school-districts and the civil districts should be declared 
by law to be identical. These districts are identical in eighty-one 
counties of the State, and the remaining counties give more 
trouble to this Department on account of the school-district 
and the election of District Directors than the eighty-one coun- 
ties where the districts are uniform. There is no good reason 
why the school-district and the civil district should not be de-
-P-A-G-E-13
—L— 
clared identical. But if the members of the General Assembly 
should think otherwise, then there should be some legislation 
taken as to who shall be authorized to change the lines of school- 
districts. It is very clear to my mind that this is the duty of 
the County Courts of the State, but another view is taken in 
some counties of the State, where it is held that the District Di- 
rectors can change the lines.of the school-districts at will. This 
grew out of the fact that some years ago the District Directors 
were authorized to subdivide their respective school-districts. 
This subdivision simply meant that the Directors should say 
what school-houses the children of their districts should attend — 
so as to prevent the crowding of children into one school-house 
to the detriment of other schools. That was to avoid a damage 
to both schools, the one being overcrowded with pupils, the 
other not having a sufficient number. But by the construction 
placed upon this law by some County Courts, the District Di- 
rectors concurring, the districts have been divided and subdi- 
vided and re-subdivided, the Directors making each school- 
house a school-district and appointing three District Directors 
to govern said school, until they have gone in some cases to 
such extremes that we now find many schools in the State with 
not more than twelve or fifteen pupils enrolled to the house. 
This, should not be, and should be regulated at once. By 
making the school-districts and the civil districts identical, such 
mismanagement as this will cease at once. It is a difficult matter 
in many sections to secure thoroughly competent men to manage 
the schools of the district, and where the school and civil districts 
are identical, it will be much easier to find three good men in 
the district to manage the school than it will be when each dis- 
triet may be narrowed down to the small neighborhood. Be- 
sides, we have a school-system, and each county should conform 
to this system. 
Gravina oF Country ScHoozs. 
We have now adopted a graded course of study, which is 
being put into successful operation in: many of the counties of 
the State. Those counties that have tried this course of study, 
with the grading of the schools under competent supervision,
-P-A-G-E-14
— 18 — 
have found that it works admirably. Oue great advantage that 
it has is in securing better attendance upon the schools. One 
great trouble has been to teach the people the importance of 
sending their children to school each day of the entire session. 
In the schools whert the -pupils are thoroughly graded it is 
much easier to secure attendance than in those schools where 
there is no grading, from the fact that when a pupil remains at 
home from one to three weeks it must fall into a lower class, or 
a lower grade, when it returns to school, because the pupils of 
the grade to which it belonged before it left school have so ad- 
vanced that it cannot take a place in its former class, but must 
go back to another class, which means, in many instances, one 
year. There is no other alternative. The teacher cannot form 
another class in all the studies required to be taught in each 
grade for one pupil, nor for two, nor even three. These pupils 
must drop into a lower class. This the pupils have found out, 
and this the parents know and readily understand; hence the 
increased attendance in all localities where the graded course of 
study has been put into successful operation. Another thing 
it does: Some years ago many pupils could be found attending 
the public schools who desired to take one’ study or two studies. 
Now, when a pupil attends a school that is graded, he must 
take the entire course of study of his grade, and the end can 
be seen from the beginning. The pupils start in at the first, 
and continue to the seventh grade, completing all the subjects 
required to be taught in public schools. When they have fin- 
ished this course of study, a public school-diploma is granted to 
such pupils, furnishing a strong incentive to the students to 
complete the entire course of study. Another advantage that 
is gained by this graded course of study is the uniform series of 
text-books. It is absolutely necessary that the text-books in | 
the schools where the graded course of study is in successful 
operation, shall be uniform, and this has done much to prevent 
the frequent change of books, made by teachers when they 
take charge of a new school, or a school in a neighborhood 
where they have not taught before. There is very little trouble 
now on the text-book question. In fact, there has been no 
trouble reported to the Department on this subject during the 
last twelve months.

HieH-scHoo.s. 
There is a growing demand throughout the State for the 
public school-curriculum to be extended. The only way this 
can be done with any success—yes, without injury to the com- 
mon-schools as they now exist—is by the establishment of county 
high-schools, for if the public school-eurriculum should now be 
extended so that we would have instead of a seven years’ course 
in the primary schools a ten years’ course, the efficiency of the 
primary schools would be seriously retarded. The classes and 
grades would be so multiplied that no man, no matter what his 
qualifications are, could possibly discharge the duties of teacher 
as those duties should be discharged; but this can be met by 
permitting the counties desiring to do so, to establish high- 
schools for the benefit of those pupils who shall have completed 
the public school-course as now required to be taught. This is 
also in keeping with the work of education in other States; 
and where these high-schools have been established they have 
been found to be successful and to pay. The only recommen- 
dation here made is that permission be granted to the counties 
through their respective County Courts to establish such high- 
schools, and levy a tax for the benefit of the same, if they may 
see proper, 
I further recommend that a careful perusal be given to the 
report of the committee adopted at the late convention of pub- 
lie school-officers at Knoxville upon the subject of “High- 
schools, or the Connecting Link between the Public School and 
the College.” This report is found printed in the proceedings 
of the State convention, and in an appendix to this report. 
Poustic Scuooi-orricers’ ASssocraTion. 
Your attention is called to the report, given as an appendix, 
of the Public School-officers’ Association, held in the city of 
Knoxville, December 9 to 11 inclusive. This organization has 
done more to assist the State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion in making the public schools efficient than any other 
agency. The meeting of the County Superintendents in con- 
vention, and the adoption of plans for work, commits all those
-P-A-G-E-16
— 15 — 
present to the faithful consideration of those plans, and is a 
strong incentive for those who are not present to fall into line 
and carry out the plans thus recommended. It brings about 
‘a better-understanding between the State Superintendent and 
County Superintendents; for it is now regarded that the County 
and City Superintendents are absolutely indispensable. There 
is no other officer connected with the public school-system who 
is of such vast importance to that system as is the County Su- 
perintendent. It is through him that the State Superintendent 
must reach the Directors and the teachers. It is through him 
that a graded course of study must be adopted. It is by him 
that the teachers must be improved. The County Courts in 
many counties of the State have been quite liberal with their 
respective County Superintendents in paying their necessary 
traveling expenses in attending the annual meetings of the con- 
vention. It is to be regretted that all the counties do not ap- 
preciate the value of such meetings, and do not pay the expenses 
and even require the Superintendent to attend these annual 
meetings. It is but a matter of time, however, when each and 
every county in the State will come forward and do its duty 
manfully in sustaining the office of County Superintendent, and 
making liberal appropriations for the payment of salaries and 
all necessary expenses pertaining thereto. 
Stare Instrrurus. 
For some years it has been the custom of the Trustees of the 
Peabody Educational Fund, through their general agent, to 
give to the State Superintendent $1,000 annually for the sup- 
port of Institutes. These Institutes have been held in different 
parts of the State, and competent men have been selected, and 
paid a salary, which is $25 a week and all necessary traveling 
expenses, to conduct the same. Through this medium and the 
Public School-officers’ Association an organization has been 
perfected in each county in the State, and Institutes held under 
the supervision of the County Superintendent. Several coun- 
ties of the State are now doing much to improve the quatifica- 
tions of the teachers; but we need further assistance to carry 
on this work, and it is hereby recommended that an appropria- 
tion of $1,000 annually be made by the General Assembly for
-P-A-G-E-17
— 16 — 
Institute purposes. I am assured also that a like amount will 
be given trom the Peabody Educational Fund. With this sum, 
$2,000, the State Superintendent can do a great amount of 
good. <A failure upon the part of the General Assembly to 
make this appropriation may cause the Trustees of the Peabody 
Educational Fund to withhold the amount that has annually 
been given; for it is their policy—and I deem it a very wise one 
—to assist those States that assist themselves. Therefore, it is 
to be hoped that a wise policy will be adopted, one that will 
strengthen the Department of Public Instruction and improve 
the teachers as well. Thus will the healthful growth of the 
public school-system be fostered; for this will return to the 
children in the form of improved instruction. The State Board 
of Education, at a meeting recently held in the oflice of the Su- 
perintendent of Public Instruction, passed a resolution unani- 
mously requesting the Superintendent of Public Instruction to 
go before the Committees on Education of the two Houses of 
the General Assembly and urge the importance of making an 
appropriation for Institute purposes of $1,000. 
The reports of the Institute conductors, together with a cir- 
cular announcing the work for the year just closed, are herewith 
submitted. A careful perusal will give a clear idea of the 
amount of work done. (See Appendix D.) 
Prasopy Normat Coes. 
Your attention is called to the report of Dr. W. H. Payne, of 
the Peabody Normal College, herewith submitted, which will 
give you the condition of that noble institution. It has been 
the custom of the General Assembly for several years past (as 
per contract between a former General Assembly of Tennessee 
and the General Agent of the Peabody Fund), to give to this 
institution $10,000 annually, but the growth of that school has 
been such that it is now absolutely necessary to increase its an- 
nual appropriation. The State Board of Education will join 
in a petition to the General Assembly asking for an increase. 
There are many reasons why this request should be granted. 
First, this school is doing that which no other institution in the 
State can do for the education of the teachers, It is purely a
-P-A-G-E-18
—17 — 
professional school, and those who enter here are trained ex- 
pressly for teaching. There is no division whatever; all the 
instructors, including the president, are seeking to impart such 
knowledge as shall enable those under their care to become 
teachers in fact; and what we need to-day more than all else is 
competent men and-women to enter the school-room and take 
charge of the children. Second, we should have a State pride 
in this school second to none else in the State. The Peabody 
Board came among us several years ago and located in our 
midst this school, which is for all the Southern States, in fact, 
for all the States in the Union; and this should encourage us 
to do our part in sustaining that which was given us. Each 
should strive to see who can be first in extending a helping 
hand to this noble institution. It wil] be well for the members 
of the General Assembly at a convenient season to visit this in- 
stitution and inspect the workings thereof, for [ am sure that all 
will return well repaid for the visit. 
I will ask you to carefully read the report of Dr. Payne. 
(See Appendix E.) 
Sauary or CLerk ror THE DupaRTMENt. 
The Department of Public Instruction has grown to such 
proportions that it is now absolutely impossible for the Super- 
intendent to discharge its duties with such help as can be se- 
eured with the present appropriation of $500 per annum. I 
have been very fortunate during the last two years of my ad- 
ministration in securing the services of Major H. C. Bate. He 
holds another position which does not occupy all his time, and 
by giving him the salary appropriated for the Clerk of this De- 
_ partment, which added to the one he was already receiving, 
gave him a living salary, I was enabled to secure his valuable 
assistance. He has recently secured a permanent position with 
the State Board of Health and thus will be lost to the coming 
Superintendent. The appropriation made for the Clerk of this 
Department should be not less than $1,200 per annum. The 
State Board of Education, will, by petition, ask the General As- 
sembly to make such an appropriation. A man competent to 
discharge the duties of this office cannot be secured for a smaller 
2
-P-A-G-E-19
—18—~— 
amount. I ask an inspection of the work required of the Clerk, 
showing what has been doue within the last twelve months, in 
order that you may be better able to consider this request. 
The State Superintendent should not be required to do office 
work from the fact that his services are needed in the field and 
are much more valuable to the State when thus employed. 
City ScHoots. 
In almost every incorporated town in this State we now have 
a well-organized system of city schools by the election of a 
Board of Education by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen and 
the levy of a corporate tax for school-purposes; and in some 
of these towns we have elegant school-houses ranging in cost 
from $5,000 to $85,000. There are a few incorporated towns 
in the State who, at this time, do not levy an additional tax for 
school-purposes, and have no schools for the corporation ex- 
clusively, but I trust that in a very short time those towns will 
see that they are standing in their own light, by observing the 
work of the public school-system in the towns where it is now 
in successful operation, and will come forward manfully and es- 
tablish a good system of public schools. (See reports of Su- 
perintendents of City Schools herewith submitted.)

An effort has been made to collect important statistics show- 
ing the condition of the colleges and higher educational insti- 
tutions of the State, the number of such institutions, the value 
of school-property, the number of teachers employed, the num- 
ber of pupils enrolled, the seating capacity, degrees conferred, 
ete. The officers of such schools, in some instances, refuse to 
give the information sought, and an estimate in a few instances 
is given. I trust in future this will be absolutely correct.

into this noble institution, and the day is uot far distant when 
we shall tind from one thousand to fifteen hundred young men 
in daily attendance. A “ teachers’ course” has recently been 
established for the purpose of educating teachers for the public 
schools of the State, full particulars of which are given in the 
report of the President, submitted as an appendix to this report. 
I have been elected to take charge of this department, and shall 
enter upon the duties as soon as my term of office shall expire. 
The following circular has been sent to all the teachers of the 
State: , 
“Department of Pusuic Instruction, 
_ “Nasuvitte, Tenn., December 22, 1890. 
“To the Teachers and Young Men of Tennessee: 
“ Hereafter the University of Tennessee will have a regularly 
organized “Teachers’ Department.’ I have been selected to 
take charge of the work, and embrace the present opportunity 
of addressing you. This isa long needed work, and it gives 
me great pleasure to feel that I am privileged to devote to it the 
best energies of my life. 
“As teachers you need special training in your profession. 
Some of you may want to extend your education. You cannot 
all afford to take a full college course, desirable as it may be to 
do so. In the Teachers’ Course we propose to meet your wants. 
“To enter here you should have completed the public school 
studies. Your first year here will be devoted to review work 
and an extension of the practical branches, including Higher 
Arithmetic, Advanced Grammar, Physical Geography, Physiol- 
ogy, Book-keeping, and school management. The second year 
will be devoted to more advanced studies and the science at 
pedagogy. See course of study inclosed. 
“ Those who complete the course will be granted a life certifi- 
cate, good in any county in the State, and exempts the holder 
from all examinations.
-P-A-G-E-22
— 21 — 
“Those taking the Teachers’ Course will be exempt from 
military discipline or drill. Every thing will be arranged for 
doing the most work in the least time. The expenses will be 
put within the reach of those having the smallest means. We 
want to make this a school for the masses. 
“Tt gives me much pleasure to call your attention to the fol- 
lowing resolutions unanimously adopted by the State Board of 
Education, viz.: 
“Recoeyizine the very important fact that the supply of thoroughly competent 
teachers in our public schools is quite inadequate to the popular demands of the 
people, and that in many localities that there are worthy young men and women 
striving to perfect themselves ia the later and moreimproved methods of teaching, 
put for the want of means and facilities are unable to do s», we, the members of 
the State Board of Education, do hail with pleasure and cheerfully indorse the very 
necessary and sensible action of the University of Tennessee in supplying this 
long-felt need by establishing @ department that will give to those desiring to be- 
come professional teachers all of the advantages and privileges of a first-class nor- 
mal; therefore, be it 
“1. Resolved, That the membersof the State Board do heartily and thoroughly 
indorse the establishing of such a department by the University of Tennessee. 
“9. Resolved, That in the course of study adopted we feel that much good judg- 
ment has been displayed, it being along the line of studies especially and pecu- 
liarly fitted for those who would make teaching i in our public schools a profession 
for life. 
“3. Resolved, That in the selection of the Hon. Frank M. Smith to the head of 
this department, we feel that a wise and most excellent choice has been made, from 
the fact that he has made school management a specialty, and is possessed of a 
large experience in teaching and disciplining schools; and, moreover, for the last 
four years, as State Superintendent, has had every opportunity of becoming thor- 
oughly acquainted with the school system and all of its needs, and hence we think 
the very:man to instruct pupils seeking information along this line. 
“4. Resolved, That we cheerfully recommend him to all young men throughout 
the State who are desirous of becoming teachers, being assured that he is thor- 
oughly posted in the work, and will ground them well in the best and later methods 
of school work and discipline. 
"5. Resolved, That it is explicitly understood and agreed that in no way shall 
our indorsement of this department of the University conflict with the Peabody 
Normal, now doing such inestimable work throughout the South, but rather that it 
shall prove a material aid and copious feeder to that institution, which is, and 
ought to be, the pride and glory of the State.

“For turther information, address me in this city until Jan- 
uary 15, 1891, after that date at Knoxville. 
“ Yours truly, 
“Frank M. Smita, 
_ “Superintendent. 
~ “Or Dr. C. W. Dasyey, Jr., 
« President of . University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn.’ 
Many letters have been received asking why young women 
who desire to become teachers cannot be admitted to the teach- 
ers’ department? 
To all such, I answer that before young women can be ad- 
mitted a building for their accommodation must be erected on 
the University grounds and properly equipped; so that advan- 
tages equal to those now enjoyed by the young men shall be 
provided. 
This is a matter that those interested should bring to ‘the at- 
tention of the members of the General Assembly. 
Iam not authorized to speak for the Board of Trustees, but 
it will take but a short time to have the Board pass upon this 
question. : 
For further information you are referred to the report of Dr. 
CO. W. Dabney, Jr., President, which is herewith submitted as 
an appendix to this report. (See Appendix C.) 
CapeEts. 
The following circular was issued from this Department, and 
sent to the County and City Superintendents. Examinations 
were held in all of the counties where there were any appli- 
cants. There are a few vacancies now, and members of the 
General Assembly can make appointments, aud cadets thus ap- 
pointed can enter the classes at the University at the beginning 
of the second term, February 12, 1890: .

“DeparTMENT oF PuBLic INSTRUCTION, 
“ Nasuvitin, May 1, 1890. 
“To County and City Superintendents of Schools: 
“Dear Sirs—l have the honor to call your attention to a 
portion of your official duty as contained in Chapter 3, Article 
IV., Sections 327 to 329 of the Code. 
“In accordance with the law, you are hereby required to give 
public notice thereof and to hold such examination or exami- 
nations of candidates for appointments as State cadets in the 
University of Tennessee as may be necessary in your county or 
city. 
«Since its complete re-organization under President Dabney, 
the University has completed nearly two years of successful 
work. Many improvements have been made. New buildings 
have been erected and. the old ones remodeled. A fine labora- 
tory building and a building for the Y. M. C. A., and gymna- 
sium will be erected this summer. A strong teaching force has 
been organized, and new courses of study have been formulated. 
A Department of Law has been established with ex-Justice 
Freeman at its head. The attendance on the Academic Depart- 
ment has reached about two hundred and sixty, which is a large 
increase on that of recent years. The attendance on all de- 
partments has reached nearly six hundred. The discipline has 
‘been remarkably good. 
“The Agricultural Experiment Station recently established 
by Congress, is connected with the University, and adds much 
to its advantages for study in agricultural chemistry, botany, 
zoology, entomology, and the related sciences. 
“Thus, with the Station, the newly equipped Mechanical 
Building, and other facilities, the University offers to young 
men of Tennessee unsurpassed opportunities for study. 
“Under the laws of the State and of the University, cach 
State Senator and Representative can appoint two young men 
from the list of qualified candidates reported by the county or
-P-A-G-E-25
-- 24 — 
city Superintendents from their counties. The President of 
the University is authorized to appoint the remaining young 
men, recommended by Superintendents to vacancies, as long as 
any exist. Such appointees become State students when reg- 
istered at the University, and are entitled to free registration 
and tuition in the Collegiate Department until graduation. 
Since tuition and registration amonut to $60 per session, an ap- 
pointment is worth $300 to any young man toward his educa- 
tion. With such an appointment, the total necessary expenses 
of a student at the University are only about $186 per session 
of ten months, boarding at the Steward’s Hall, and a great deal 
less at the students’ private mess, which is little more than it 
would cost him to live at home. Opportunities are also offered 
young men at the University to earn something to help them- 
selves. The young men of the State will embrace this excel- 
lent opportunity to get an education, when it is known to them. 
“Publish a notice like the following in your county papers, 
or otherwise: 
“ Examinations for appointments to State scholarships in the 
University of Tennessee will be held, in accordance with law, 
by the undersigned at on the——day of June. Appli- 
cants must be at least fifteen years of age, must be of good 
moral character, and be prepared to pass complete examinations 
in arithmetic, algebra to quadratic equations, English gram- 
mar and composition, geography, and United States history. - 
All who pass can receive an appointment with free tuition, good 
until graduation, if desired, and worth $300 in tuition and fees, 
as compared with other institutions. The necessary expenses 
of a State student at the University are about $186 for a session 
of ten months. There are courses in civil and mechanical en- 
gineering, agriculture, general science, chemistry, and Latin 
science. The University has been thoroughly re-organized and 
enlarged, with new buildings and new professorships. For par- 
ticulars of courses of study and expenses, address the President, 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., Knoxville, Tennessee. This is an 
unsurpassed opportunity for young men to get a thorough edu- 
cation. [Signed]

«“ When the young men present themselves, give them a thor- 
ough examination in the branches named. The regulations of 
the University say that no one shall be admitted to any depart- 
ment of the University who does. not possess a complete and 
thorough knowledge of arithmetic, algebra to quadratic equa- 
tions, English grammar and composition, geography, and United 
States history. 
“The University cannot do any portion of the work that the 
common schools should do. It is especially important that ap- 
plicants should be perfect in arithmetic, and be able to write 
English correctly. It will be a mistaken kindness to send boys 
up to the University to find out there that they cannot enter 
even the lowest classes. 
“You are expected to see to it, also, that the young men you 
recommend are of good moral character, and are earnest and 
intelligent. Itis not enough that you do not know any thing 
against a candidate. He must prove a good character by testi- 
monials from his teachers or other reliable persons. 
“Make out a list of the candidates you find qualified and rec- 
ommend on the inclosed blanks, and forward it to me by July 
1. . By attending to this matter faithfully you will not only per- 
‘form your official duty but confer an everlasting benefit upon the 
young men of your county.

I regret to say that I have not a full report of the proceed- 
ings of this Association for publication. This was, in many 
respects, the most important meeting of the Association ever 
held. I give the programme in full, and the report, as taken 
from the Memphis Appeal, in Appendix F. 
The Association adjourned subject to the call of the Execu- 
tive Committee, which will be early in July on Lookout 
Mountain.

Scuoou-exuisrr, . 
Supt. H. D. Huffaker, of Hamilton County, conceived the 
idea of having an exhibit of the work done by the pupils in 
the country schools, and put this into practical execution. I 
am pleased to make mention of this in my annual report, as 
’ the effort was a grand success, for the encouragement of Mr. 
Huffaker and other County Superintendents. 
I quote from the Chattanooga daily papers as follows, the 
first clipping being from the Chattanooga Daily Press of Decem- 
19, 1890: 
“The educational exposition opened at the court-house this 
morning at 11 o’clock. From every school in the county were 
exhibits from children in the highest and lowest grades. A 
line of tables all around the Circuit Court-room were covered 
with maps, compositions, examples, and penmanship displays. 
The walls were neatly decorated with the same. In all, proba- 
bly 1,200 exhibits are displayed that reflect great credit upon 
the scholars, and gives one an idea of the excellent work being 
done by the schools of the county. 
“The room was crowded with children, interested in each 
other’s. productions, with admiring parents, pleased teachers, 
.and interested friends. 
“Rev. Mr. Stuart, of the Uentenary Church, delivered a stirring address on the education of the youth, and one full of sound, sensible advice to teachers, couched in his strong and effective language. ¥

“The exhibit is entirely from the country district-schools, 
under the charge of Superintendent Huffaker. It is the first 
exposition of the kind ever held in the South, and the happy 
expression on Professor Hutfaker’s countenance assures one 
that the success is as gratifying as he anticipated.” 
The following is taken from the Times of December 19, 1890: 
“Hugh D. Huffaker, Superintendent of the County Schools, 
was making extensive preparations yesterday for the school-ex- 
hibit to be made at the court-house to-day. The colored school- 
exhibits will be'in the Chancery Court-room, and the white 
schools in the Circuit Court-room. These rooms were put in 
shape for the exhibits yesterday, shelves being arranged around 
the inside walls for the reception of the specimens. 
“Tt will be an exhibition of the work in penmanship, draw- 
ing, writing, etc., done by the schools of the county outside of 
the city of Chattanooga. Sixty-nine schools will be repre- 
sented, with exhibits from seventy-five rooms of all grades. 
“The exhibition will be open to the public promptly at 11 
A.M., being introduced by an address by Rev. George R. Stuart. 
Superintendent Huffaker is extremely anxious that every one 
interested in the educational work of Hamilton County shall 
visit the exhibition some time during the day. 
“This is the first. county school-exhibit ever made south of 
the Ohio River. Under the superintendency of Mr. Huftaker, 
Hamilton County was also the first in the South to issue diplo- 
mas to graduates of county schools. 
“This new feature of showing to the public the progress be- 
ing made by the rising generation of school-children, shows * 
Superintendent Huffaker to be an enterprising official, and will 
meet with the hearty approbation of the public generally.” 
I clip the following editorial from the Sunday Times of De- 
cember 21, 1890:

ufacturing products of our county, have done much to stimu- 
late the farmer in the production of higher grades of stock, 
better grain, fruit, and vegetables; the manufacturer in sending 
out finer and more durable goods, Exhibits of farm products, 
the timber and mineral resources of different localities, have 
attracted settlers to the sections from whence these came. In 
our Chamber of Commerce is an exhibit of the timber and 
mineral resources of the Chattanooga district. A capitalist 
coming here for the purpose of investing in timber or mineral 
lands, is invited by some enterprising citizen to the Chamber of 
Commerce, and the specimens carefully explained. It would 
be impossible to estimate the amount of capital this exhibit has 
brought us. : 
“ Exhibitions of school-work now play an important part in 
the educational world, and will do more to improve our schools 
and attract intelligent families as permanent settlers to the sec- 
tions where these exhibits are held than fairs, expositions, and 
timber and mineral exhibits have accomplished in their line, 
“This county, ever to the front in new enterprises, is the first 
in the State to hold a school-exhibition. Last Friday two rooms 
in the court-house presented busy scenes. Walls and tables 
displayed the work of the school-children of Hamilton County. 
Throngs of visitors came and went the entire day, testify- 
ing to the deep interest taken by our people in educational 
matters. The Superintendent and his able corps of teachers 
greeted the visitors and explained the exhibit. Under Super- 
intendent Huftaker’s wise and careful supervision the Hamilton 
County schools take high rank. The exhibition was a decided 
success, a movement that means greater interest in schools by 
each and every citizen, more earnest efforts on the part of 
teachers, and better work by pupils. 
“The County Superintendent and his teachers should receive 
the congratulations of the entire community in the inauguration 
and success of this work. We hope to see a like exhibit of the 
city schools of Chattanooga.”

The Chattanooga Evening News of December 19, speaks as ., follows: : 
“The Hamilton County educational exposition is being held 
in the Cireuit Court-room at the court-house to-day. 
“The exposition is a grand one and the first of the kind ever 
known in this country. It is the original idea of Superintend- 
ent Huffaker, and to glance at the many attractive and 
beautiful displays, it is easy to judge that the exhibition is a 
success. 
“The display is that of actual class-work and map-drawing. 
It shows the various methods of teaching used in the public 
schools, and gives the teachers an opportunity to improve upon | 
each other’s methods and adopt the best. It also gives the par- 
ents of pupils and the public generally an opportunity of per- 
ceiving what the school-teachers are doing. 
“The Circuit Court-room was thronged with people to view 
the displays. Pretty school-marms hovered around the room 
and displayed to the spectators the works of their different pu- 
pils. They appeared proud, too, each one of them, of their dif- 
ferent departments. 
“A few minutes after 11 o’clock, Superintendent Huffaker in- 
troduced Rev. G. R. Stuart, pastor of the Centenary Church, 
who spoke for nearly one hour. 
“The teachers who are present and have exhibitions of work 
are as follows:

I have the distinguished honor of herewith introducing to the 
teachers, and to the people of our State, my successor in office, 
Capt. W. R. Garrett, late of Montgomery Bell Academy, Nash- 
ville, Tenn. He is a native of Virginia, a graduate of William 
and Mary College, having received the degree of Master of 
Arts in that venerable institution. THeis a gentleman of classical 
scholarship, a man whose record in war and in peace is marked 
by courage, probity, and faithfulness; a teacher of ripe experi- 
ence and of notable. success. 
For years Captain Garrett has been identitied with the pro- 
fession in Tennessee, has been connected with all the leading 
educational enterprises and associations of the day, has been 
honored with many important official positions, and is to-day 
the President of the National Educational Association of the 
United States. In making this appointment, His Excellency, 
Governor Buchanan, has thus shown his marked appreciation 
of the dignity and importance of the office to which he has ele- 
vated Captain Garrett, and of the value of experienced profes- 
sional service in the direction of the educational interests of the 
State. 
I bespeak for my successor the enthusiastic and intelligent 
co-operation of the teachers of Tennessee, whose self-sacrificing 
labors have done so much to aid my administration and to ad- 
vance our beloved Commonwealth to its appropriate rank in 
the great sisterhood of States. Frank M. Sura.

This is the only school in which the salaries have been paid 
from the free school funds, hence the report is separate. 
Three years ago the people of Bell’s were having some trouble 
in their school, growing out of the fact that the people of the 
Fifth Civil District, or the people of the country, and the town 
of Bell’s, could not agree as to the manner and time of having 
the free school. This had given trouble for several years; and 
the white schoo! had almost been a failure. It was thought 
best by the Directors to use the free school funds belonging to 
the district in building a separate school-house for the country 
people outside of the corporate limits of Bell’s. This left the peo- 
ple of the town with only one resort for a school, and that was to 
have a pay-school, which proved to be very successful—so much 
so that it was thought the building at Bell’s was inadequate, 
even to accommodate the pupils in a subscription school. ‘the 
free school funds for the past two years have been used in en-

larging and improving the building at Bell’s. Notwithstavding 
this the people are very much interested in the subject of edu- 
cation, and are making strong efforts to build up their school. 
They now boast that, although they have had a pay-school for 
the past three years, they have the best building and double the 
attendance of any other school in the county.

| Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—I have the honor to transmit herewith a report of 
the Chattanooga Public Schools for the school-year ending 
June 30, 1890: 
The enrollment was larger than any previous year, and the 
per cent. of enrollment to enumeration—68.32—was larger than 
a majority of the cities of the United States attain of the same 
size and upwards. 
A new building has been projected and is in process of erec- 
tion for the Second District and high-school, which will be an 
ornament to the city and a valuable aid in school-work. 
The course of study has been re-written and elaborated, and 
more definite directions given to teachers for carrying on the 
work. A teachers’ library has been established, and we have 
purchased books for supplementary reading for use of pupile. 
Thirty-one pupils graduated from the high-schools at the 
close of the scholastic year, May 23, 1890. 
The programmes were as follows: 
Cuatranooga Hicu-scnoon.

REPORTS 
—or— 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON County. . 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit herewith my annual 
report for the scholastic year ending June 80, 1890. While the 
people are not thoraughly aroused on the subject of education, 
and our schools are not perfect, yet it is gratifying to note the 
great and sure progress of Anderson County. I believe we 
have the most liberal County Court, the most competent Board 
of Directors, and the most efficient and earnest corps of teachers 
the county ever had. What we need most is better school- 
houses and fewer; and I am trying, with a good deal of hope, 
to effect a crusade against the little, old, dilapidated school- 
house. Indeed, the crusade has already begun. 
In addition to the main report, allow me to add that we had 
one State Normal Institute, which has been reported; one 
County Normal Institute for white teachers, and one for colored 
teachers. Good work was done in each, and a good effect is 
apparent. I held, besides, three local Teachers’ Institutes and 
one County Teachers’ Institute, which were reasonably success- 
ful. I prepared a graded course of study, and graded all the 
schools by it—the most satisfactory work I have done. I visited 
all the schools, examined the work of each, aud in my talks 
gave such advice as I thought fittest, with such words of en- 
couragement as I could summon. We secured and maintained 
an educational column in our county paper, which has pro- 
duced much interest and great good. In connection with this
-P-A-G-E-101
> — 96 — 
column is a roll of honor, in which, at the end of each month, 
the names of those students in the several grades who are 
adjudged by their teachers to be most worthy, are printed. I 
would modestly recommend this roll of honor to my fellow 
County Superintendents, for it has proven a great incentive to 
study and right action. Respectfully submitted, 
EK. L. Fostsr, 
Superintendent. 
Buprorp County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dzar Sir—I have forwarded my sixth annual statistical re- 
port of the public schools of this county for the scholastic year 
ending June 30,1890. The work of the year was begun and 
finished under the general plan explained.in previous reports. 
With a few exceptions, the schools have been well managed and 
well taught. A strong sentiment favoring free education is 
quite universal; hence, there has been a practical diligence and 
devotion to the cause that have given us an excellent grade of 
results. No effort has been made to “boom” or give undue 
stimulation to the work, but a reasonable degree of enthusiasm 
and energy has prevailed, and the usual advances have been 
made in every department. We could not be satisfied with slow 
progress, but would choose it rather than seasons of retrogres- 
sion or continual conflict with error; hence, we have tried to 
cultivate a cautious diligence, and to acquire a habit of calcu- 
lating before acting, that our growth may be right and per- 
manent. 
As was written in my last annual report, our county is well 
organized. Each organization is still active and doing effective 
work. The Normal Institutes held in Shelbyville this summer 
were the largest and best ever held in the county. The Teach- 
ers’ Reading Circle and the Directors’ Association have done 
good work during the year. At present educational mass- 
meetings are'being held in different portions of the county. 
They have already proved to be worthy of confidence and sup-
-P-A-G-E-102
— 97 — 
port. They are rapidly growing in popularity as a source of 
social enjoyment and intellectual growth, and as a means of 
broadening and intensifying interest and education. 
I have just completed my “annual round of visitations,” and 
am. pleased with what I have seen and heard. I regret to con- 
fess that I have visited a few schools that are about as void of 
real worth as midnight is of sunbeams; yct, it is gratifying to 
know that at least ninety per cent. of our schools are taught by 
conscientious men and women, who are making reasonable 
progress in honest efforts to popularize true education from the 
stand-point of the real teacher. Among improvements that 
merit special mention are improved discipline and methods of 
teaching. In these particulars the majority of our schools have 
been good all the time; but we have certainly attained to a 
greater unity of opinion as to what good discipline and good 
methods are, and have become more unanimous in our determi- 
nation to employ them. 
In the statistical report forwarded a few days ago, no account 
is given of the private school work of the county; but I send 
herewith a statistical report of “institutions of learning other 
than public schools,” which report includes only such schools as 
are wholly private throughout the year. In addition to these, 
about forty “subscription” schools have been taught, in which 
were employed about fifty teachers. These schools were in 
session from three to five months, and reached an enrollment of 
not less than 1,700 pupils. The work done in our private 
schools is of an excellent character. The teachers are not only 
in sympathy with the public school work, but some of them are 
among its most active and enthusiastic supporters, and have 
given us valuable aid. 
In conclusion, please accept my sincere thanks for the en- 
couragement and aid you haye given me, and permit me to 
congratulate you on the substantial growth of the public school- 
system of our State during your administration. 
Respectfully, 
J. A. ALLEN, 
Superintendent.

Benton County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : ‘ 
Dear Srr—I have the honor of transmitting to you my sec- 
ond annual report of the Benton County schools. 
It gives me pleasure to say that the schools in my county are 
being carried on by good, faithful, and competent teachers, who 
are enthused with a love of the work, and are engaged with an 
interest which shines brightly in every neighborhood in my 
county. I think our people are beginning to see the necessity 
of education to their children; that the welfare of the county 
demands a development of the faculties given the many prom- 
ising youths in our county. I visited all the schools of the 
county except a few that closed before I could get around. I 
talked a short while to nearly all the schools on my round of 
visits, and am glad to say the children all seemed anxious to 
profit by any good advice given them. 
In some of the districts the Directors have too many schools, 
consequently the school-term is very short—not long enough to 
be of much benefit to the children. In conclusion, I can and 
am glad to say that our schools are improving, and there is 
more interest being manifested in favor of schools than ever 
before. Respectfully, 
J. H. Harper, 
Superintendent. 
BiEDSoE County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.:- 
Dear Sir—In submitting my annual report I am very glad 
to be able to inform you that the canse of education is steadily 
coming up in Bledsoe County. We have had a great many things 
to encounter and to overcome before we could advance as some 
other counties, but many of. these have given way and we are 
advancing. Our Directors in some districts have been slow to 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
— 99 — 
pay a salary that would justify good teachers, but that is rapidly 
changing, and we have quite a number of young gentlemen and 
young ladies that are taking an interest in teaching. The 
Directors are paying them reasonably fair wages, and they are 
making a success in teaching. Our teachers are taking more 
interest in Teachers’ Institutes.than in former years. The 
Peabody Normal, held in our county last July, conducted by 
yourself, and Captain Douglass, was worth much to our teachers. 
Since then we have held monthly Institutes, lasting one day 
each. We hope to be able to continue them all the year. If 
we can get the School-directors and the people interested in 
these Institutes so that they will attend, we may expect greater 
results from them. 
We have a great trouble and extra cost over a plurality of 
text-books, but we hope to be able to soon get rid of this trouble 
and cost. If the County Court will give us more money, so 
that we can have longer terms, we will soon see our county 
coming to the front. 
If you could hold us another Peabody Norms wexs, spmmery 
commencing abcut the first Monday in Subs, fe dp largely 
attended, and the teachers and people Kotld take’ nk ene 
interest than before. 2 Bespentaly, os

Dear Srr—In compliance with the schvol-law, 1 herewith 
submit my fourth annual report of schools in Blount County 
for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1890. 
The report is in every respect the best I have ever had the 
LIBRARY

-P-A-G-E-105

honor to submit. The Directors made their reports in full, 
only two abstracts wanting out of the eighty-eight. 
Our schools are in @ prosperous condition, and the prospect 
for a continued improvement in the future is very encouraging. 
Our County Court is alive to the importance of having good 
schools, and is appropriating more money than it did in former 
years.- In the majority of school-districts the salaries of 
teachers have been advanced, the school-term lengthened, and 
a better class of teachers put at the head of our schools. 
Our County Institute was held the last week in June, and 
continued six days. It was well attended, and the instruction 
was practical, imparting a knowledge of the work to be done 
in the school-room. 
May the incoming Governor see that it is for the advance- 
ment of popular education to retain you at the head of our 
public school-system. Yours respectfully, 
. J. W. Duaean,

‘Dewr Str—Inclosed fed ‘my sixth annual report for the 
school&of Bradley County. We are still advancing along the 
line of education. Ou? annual Normal for whites was held at 
Charleston, beginning: Monday after the fourth of July. We 
had a good attendance. The onc for colored teachers was held 
at Cleveland, each one week. We are holding Institutes 
throughout the county this fall instead of visiting each school. 
I find this to be the better plan to create interest in the cause. 
Our county is very nearly supplied with good houses, some 
thirty-five having been built in the past few years. 
We are introducing the graded system adopted by the County 
Superintendents’ meeting. The past year we had $2:27 to the
-P-A-G-E-106

student. Our schools will be about five months the present 
year. I find the salaries of the teachers advancing as they im- 
prove in the methods of teaching. Every thing taken into con- 
sideration, I think our county will compare favorably with any 
in the State. Respectfully,

‘Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—I herewith transmit you my second annual! report 
of the schools of Campbell County for the year ending June 30, 
1890. Our schools are in a very good shape. We think they 
are growing better day by day. This results from the fact that 
the teachers are laboring zealously for the emancipation of our 
youth from the bondage of illiteracy, and instilling into their 
minds and hearts lessons of morality, for which they will not 
receive a full reward until their work here is ended, and they 
hear the great Teacher say, “Well done, thou good and faithful 
servant, enter into thy rest.” I have visited the majority of 
the schools, and intend to visit all before they close. I made a 
short talk in all the schools visited, endeavoring to give the 
children words of encouragement. I find them all in good 
working order, and we have much to encourage us to go for- 
ward in the discharge of our duties in educating the minds and 
hearts of the children of our good county. 
Lheld four Institutes and written examinations in different 
parts of the county in the month of June. The great need of 
our public school-system, especially in our county, is more 
money, so we can have longer school-terms and better houses. 
We trust that we shall yet see the day when the opportunity of 
obtaining a practical education shall be placed within the reach 
of every child in Campbell County and the State of Tennessee. 
Yours truly, |”

Superintendent.

Cannon County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—I have the honor of transmitting to you my fourth 
annual report of the schools of Cannon County for the scho- 
lastic year ending June 30, 1890. 
While the educational work in Cannon County for the past 
year has not been crowned with that success so much desired by 
enthusiastic educators, yet it has moved along smoothly and in 
a progressive manner. Our school-fund is not sufficient to sup- 
port our schools as fully as they ought to be. I hope our Hon- 
orable County Court will supply the deficiency by levying an 
additional tax. I think there is a manifestation of a growing 
interest in the public schools of our county, not only on the 
part of the teachers, but the Directors and people generally ate 
being stirred up on the subject of education. 
Our Normal Institute was well attended last summer. Much 
good was done. Too much cannot be said in favor of Teachers’ 
Institutes. They are the very life of the progressive teacher, 
and have done more to educate the masses and mold the public 
mind in favor of a higher education than any other one power. 
We had over 100 teachers in our Institute last summer. I am 
much gratified to note the marked improvement in the manage- 
ment and system of conducting our schools. I called a conven- 
tion of School-directors to meet in the court-house the first 
Monday in June, 1889, the result of which was the adoption 
of a uniform system of text-books for the public schools of this 
county. Our schools this year (1890) with few exceptions, are 
using the adopted series, and are being very well classified, the 
good results of which are clearly visible in a majority of our 
schools. I have done every thing in my power to advance the 
educational interest in my county, and I am proud that many 
changes have been wrought for good. Respectfully, 
: ‘ James H. Knox, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sin—Send report by this mail. Have gathered statis- 
tics best I could. Very hard matter to get Directors to report 
promptly and in full. Have done best I could under the cir- 
cumstances. 
Our schools last year were short for want of means. Few 
schools did not run at all last year, and kept their money over 
for this year. Our financial troubles have been settled. We 
have gotten on foot again, and this year our schools are running 
from five to seven months—the best we have had. 
We have a tolerable class of teachers, who seem to be indus- 
trious and alive to their duty. We cannot expect a better class 
of teachers at the present salaries. 
The average attendance for this year will be better than last 
year. People seem to be taking greater interest in education, 
and new and better school-houses are being erected by them. 
The want of funds has always been a serious obstacle to this 
county, but I hope for an improvement in the near future. 
Respectfully, 
J. H. Jupp,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—Inclosed find my annual report for the scholastic 
year ending June 30, 1890. I think this report very nearly 
correct. : 
The schools of Clay County have been doing good work, and 
have raised the standard of education in our midst. The
-P-A-G-E-109
— 104 — 
patrons of the schools seem to take more interest in the educa- 
tion and prosperity of their children than ever before. Our 
prospects for future education look brighter and better than 
_ ever before. 
Our teachers are of a better grade than we have ever had 
before. I hope our schools will continue to improve in the 
future as they have in the past. If so, it will be but a short 
time until our county schools rank with the foremost in the 
cause of education. I have visited very near all the schools in 
this county, and find most of them doing good work. 
I remain very truly, 
Lewis 8. Brown,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : : 
Duzar Sir—I herewith inclose my second annual report as to 
the condition of the public schools of Crockett County. Since 
my last report our people have manifested greater concern for 
the improvement of educational facilities than was ever known 
in our county before. Our teachers are coming to the front. 
They are reading more school-literature, attending more teach- 
ers’ meetings, discussing advanced and improved methods, and 
teaching better schools than heretofore. During the year that 
has just closed we have had a number of teachers’ meetings, 
both white and colored, at which many subjects of vital im- 
portance to our public school-work have been discussed. These 
meetings are growing in favor among both teachers and patrons. 
You, as our State Superintendent, have placed our people under 
lasting obligations to yourself for securing the services of such 
untiring Institute workers as Dr. Kellogg, of Milan, and Prof. 
T. C. Karns, of the Tennessee University, to conduct the Pea- 
body Normal Institute at Bell’s last June. That Institute was 
well attended by both teachers and citizens, and proved a grand
-P-A-G-E-110
— 105 — 
success in every particular. The people of Bell’s Depot ex- 
tended free entertainment to all teachers and visitors. Crowds 
of people were in attendance both day and night. The exer- 
cises closed on Friday evening at 4 o’clock with a large attend- 
ance and unabated interest. We are satisfied that better Insti- 
tute workers than Dr. Kellogg and Prof. Karns cannot be 
found, and that a freer hospitality cannot be found than that 
extended to the teachers by the good citizens of Bell’s Depot. 
We have had an adopted series of text-books in use in our 
county for ten years or longer, so we have very little trouble 
or expense on that score. 
’ 
Our schools are as yet ungraded, but our teachers are grad- 
ually preparing themselves for more systematic classification 
that will be very likely to result in a perfect grading of our 
schools. Time is required for a work of such vast importance. 
We prefer to make haste slowly and do our work well. The 
great hindering cause to a more rapid improvement in our 
. Schools is the lack of a sutticient school-fund. Give us money 
enough, and we could make our country schools equal to any in 
the State. 
I cannot close this report without saying a few words about 
some of our private schools. Prof. R. 8. Thompson, proprietor 
of “Thompson’s Classical Institute,” at Alamo, is conducting a 
most excellent school of a high grade. The building is a very 
nice little brick structure, fitted up in good style for accommo- 
dating thirty or thirty-five pupils. Professor Thompson is very 
thorough in his instruction, and does all the teaching except in 
the primary department. For this he sometimes calls in the 
assistance of his accomplished daughter, Miss Berta Thompson. 
Few schools offer superior advantages for young ladies and gen- 
tlemen who wish to avail themselves of the most thorough in- 
struction at the minimum cost. 
“Bell Academy,” at Bell’s Depot, is in its fourth year of suc- 
cessful work. The first three years this school was under the 
management of Prof. W. A. Muse, a good teacher and a splendid
-P-A-G-E-111
— 106 — 
disciplinarian. This school numbers in regular-attendance over 
one hundred pupils. Last May I attended the closing exercises 
and witnessed a most thorough examination of a class of young 
ladies in geometry. They simply knew the work up to the 
eighth book. The people of Bell’s Depot and vicinity are very 
proud of their school, and seem determined that it shall not 
wane. 
Gadsden is about to excel all other small towns in its system 
of schools. Ter citizens have voluntarily imposed upon them- 
selves a property and poll-tax sufficient, when added to their 
part of the public school-fund, to run a school for seven months 
in the year. The management of the school ,is in the hands of 
six citizens, who constitute the “Board of Education.” They 
employed three teachers, and the schoo] is now in the fourth 
month of the first term. This school bids fair to become one 
of the best. — . 
With D. C. Broyles at Friendship, J. G. Murdangh at Cairo, 
and Miss Mollie Worrell at Johnson’s Grove, these places are 
- having very good schools. 
Hoping that all our schools may go on prospering and dis- 
pensing knowledge to our children, * 
I remain yours truly;

Superintendent.

Dzar Str—With this I send you my statistical report’ of 
school-work of Davidson County for the scholastic year ending 
June 30,1890. You dislike long letters commenting on such 
reports; Idon’t blame you. The report speaks for itself. How-
-P-A-G-E-112
— 107 — 
ever, I call your attention to two items: First, the average daily 
attendance is not so large as it was last year. The bad, rainy 
weather in March, April, and May, and the prevalence of 
whooping-cough in some portions of the county, caused this. 
Second, last year:our balance was $84,000, while this year it is 
$60,000. I believe I explained how last year’s balance became 
so large. We are doing every thing we can to improve the 
schools. Money is the great need. Give us plenty of money, 
and we can build good school-houses, buy good furniture, have 
good teachers, do any thing necessary to have fine schools. We 
cannot do any thing without money. Our County Court recog- 
nizes this, It is a progressive body of men. They stand by 
the schools nobly. They are liberal. . I am delighted with the 
year just closed. Davidson County is proud of her schools—in 
the city and out of the city. Yours truly, 
W.M. Fueua, 
Superintendent.

Dear Sin—I have the honor and pleasure of transmitting to 
you, this, my second annual report for the school-year ending 
June 30, 1890. 
It gives me great pleasure to say that our county is doing 
every thing in her power to build up good schools within reach 
of her much-needed boys and girls; and as evidence of the same, 
I would say that our teachers graded higher this year than last, 
and as I have visited every school in my county (except three 
very short terms, which closed before I could get to them), and 
seen the actual work of the teachers in the school-room, I will 
say further that there have been taught in our schools this year 
the latest and most approved methods. Our people are more 
interested, and are having private schools taught in a good 
many of the school-districts where they have not money sufficient 
to have a public school.
-P-A-G-E-113
— 108 — 
We have made, and are still making, improvements in our 
school-buildings. We have built at Parsons a neat and well- 
constructed building, known as the Parsons Male and Female 
Institute, and we have now under construction a nice, roomy 
college in Decaturville, our county site, which will give many 
advantages to the young men and young ladies of our county. 
I held one Institute this year at the Academy in Decaturville, 
continuing four days, where we had forty-one teachers in at- 
tendance, and among them I would mention Professors Tucker 
and Moore, who did good work for the cause, especially in the 
eyes of the young teachers. Hoping that “learning may ex- 
pand and elevate the minds” not only in Decatur County, but 
all over the great State of Tennessee, I have the honor to be 
your humble servant, and am .

Dear Srr—I have the pleasure of submitting to you my 
second annual report of the schools of DeKalb County. 
It affords me great pleasure to say that we are improving in 
every respect; better school-houses are being built; the Di- 
rectors are laying aside their pets and giving us a better class 
of teachers. 
Iam proud to say that the “old-time” teachers, this year, 
have faded from our list of teachers, and young men and women 
who have prepared themselves for the work, have taken their 
places, and, asa natural consequence, our teaching force is greatly 
improved, although we are not perfect yet. Wehave a few who 
-are trying to teach who are making failures because they have 
not the ability to teach; however, I am proud to say that only a 
very few of this class have crowded themselves upon us. ,
-P-A-G-E-114

Our County-Institute was well attended this year. We en- 
rolled one hundred, and much good was accomplished. A’ few 
years ago our teachers had an idea that a County Institute was 
a “humbug,” and was for no purpose other than to put a few 
dollars into the pockets of the County Superintendent and the 
examining board. 
But now, if they don’t get a County Institute the County Su- 
perintendent has the benefit of the criticisms of all the teachers 
in the county. 
Taking it “allin all,” I am wonderfully pleased with the work 
in our schools last year. Respectfully, 
M. T. Martin, 
Superintendent.

Dear Sir—Inclosed herewith you will find my report for the 
year ending June 80, 1890. Some guess-work in it on account 
of teachers failing to send in abstracts. 
We have been getting along smoothly, with some few excep- 
tions. 
This is about all I have to tell you. Yours, etc., 
B. ©. Jackson,

-Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Sir—I herewith hand in my annual report, It was 
due sume time ago, and would have been in had I been in the
-P-A-G-E-115
— 110.— 
county. Prior to the first of October I left the' county, and 
took up my residence in Williamson County. I thought I had 
arranged to have the report made when due, and hence felt 
easy about it. But from some cause the report was not made, 
and I didn’t know till a few days ago it had not been made. 
The cause of education goes on in Dyer, and while it moves 
forward as a rule, it sometimes receives temporary checks that 
retard it fora time; but when it flashes up again, after these 
temporary smolderings, it burns with a brighter light. The 
people of the county are wedded to the free school-system, and 
will never consent to see it go down. 
The County Court continues to make liberal appropriations 
for school-purposes, and the means of education are kept within 
the easy reach of every child in the county. The prospects are 
bright for the future; and in leaving the county and severing 
my connection with its schools I am proud to testify that no 
county is more promising of an enlightened and educated 
citizenry than the one I am now leaving—Dyer. As long as 
the work is kept in competent hands all will be well. 
Very respectfully, 
D. E. McCorxtsz, 
Superintendent. 
FRANKLIN’ County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dsar Sin—I herewith submit my reports of Franklin County 
schools. This being election year, I have had some difficulty i in 
getting up the neeessary papers to make my report, owing to 
the neglect and indifference of those clerks who expect to go. 
out of office at the August election and the newly elected clerks 
not understanding their duty in making out reports. 
Owing to a perfect siege of typhoid fever in my family, three
-P-A-G-E-116
— 111 — 
members having the fever right when the schools were in full 
blast, I was prevented from visiting all the schools, and doing 
the official work that I would otherwise have done. But our 
schools are progressing finely. Our teachers are improving 
rapidly; the majority of them are young men and women who 
see that they must be efficient and fully up with all the latest 
methods of teaching in order to get employment at a good 
salary. Old humdrum and inefficient teachers are rapidly re- 
tiring from the profession in our county. With the advantages 
that our young teachers have of attending the colleges and 
normal schools in our county they will become more proficient 
and better qualified for the work of teaching. There is a grow- 
ing demand for better teachers, and-erelong applicants for 
schools must hold a first-class certificate and prove themselves 
fully up to the art in order to secure a situation. 
The colored schools are doing very well. D, A. Townsand, 
a prominent colored teacher, is making an effort, with some 
prospects of success, to build a colored Normal. 
Our educational prospects are very encouraging at this time. 
Respectfully yours,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction,

Dear Sir—I herewith submit my annual report of the public 
schools of Gibson County. 
. The public schools of this county have done more effective 
work during the past year than they have ever done before. 
Teachers who hold first-grade certificates are now generally de- 
manded by our Directors in the country schools. The public
-P-A-G-E-117
—112— 
school-system is now an old. institution in our county. Many 
of the patrons of our schools now have been educated under 
the system. They have availed themselves of the advantages 
offered by the public schools, and they are now found among 
the strongest and most enthusiastic advocates of education. 
They are the best school men in every community. 
Several Institutes have been held throughout the county dur- 
ing the year. A summer Normal Institute was also held at 
Trenton, and a large number of the teachers of the county at- 
tended, and much interest was manifested in the work of the 
Institute by both the teachers and the citizens of the town and 
‘surrounding country. .These summer Normal Institutes could 
be made more effective if the County Court would set apart a 
small fund to defray the expenses of experieneed teachers, who 
could thus be induced to give instruction to the teachers attend- 
ing. Teachers residing in the county ought to be compelled to 
attend these Institutes. Such attendance ought to be made one 
of the prerequisites for a certificate, and a teacher who neglects 
to attend ought to forfeit his certificate. Such a regulation 
should be passed by the Directors at their annual meeting in 
the absence of any other law on the subject. The matter has 
been called to the attention of our Directors, and some action 
will be taken by them at their next meeting. The public school- 
system in this county is a fixed institution. To improve and 
perfect it is the earnest desire of our patrons, our Directors, 
and our teachers. Respectfully, 
A. Kitioves, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Sir—I herewith submit my annual report for the pub- 
lic schools of Giles County for the year ending -June 30, 1890. 
I am gratified to note a considerable improvement in the teach- 
ers of the county since my term of office began, and have en-
-P-A-G-E-118
— 113 — 
deavored to impress upon them the importance of qualifying 
themselves for the business of teaching; and I think that they. 
are now beginning to realize that they must qualify themselves 
thoroughly or be left behind by others who are more am- 
bitious. I think the teachers generally in this county are now 
making greater effort than they have ever done. I have exerted: 
myself to impress upon all the teachers the fact that the grade 
must be raised, and that this can only be done by study and ap- 
plication, and this idea generally prevails among them. 
I have been exceedingly strict in my examinations, and in 
many cases have lowered their grades, believing that they were 
not entitled to the grades formerly held by them; and in many 
cases I have refused to give certificates to parties who had form- 
erly held certilicates. It has been my fixed and determined 
purpose, since the beginning of my administration, to see to it 
that no teacher had a higher grade than he or she was entitled 
to—-for two reasons: The one for the protection of the pa- 
trons of the schools, and the other as a stimulus to the teachers 
to qualify themselves, 
I am also gratified to note the improvement in the Directors 
of the county, in that they have taken more interest in the 
schools than heretofore. I have exerted myself also to impress 
upon them the importance of discharging the duties of their 
office, and have taken a great deal of pains to define their du- 
ties to them, and to get them to execute them. They now man- 
ifest more interest in the schools than they have ever done, and 
are giving more personal attention to the same. Still, I must 
confess that they are yet more negligent than they should be, 
because much depends upon the work of the Directors. 
I have, with great difficulty, succeeded in getting up a com- 
plete report of the financial condition of the schools of the 
county. 
T had to see nearly every District Clerk in person after hav- 
ing written them time and again to send in their reports. I 
also had to take the books of the Trustee to supply a part of 3 :
-P-A-G-E-119
— 114 — 
the Directors’ report. I found these books not balanced so as 
_ to show the balances on hand July, 1889 and 1890, and to get 
the report, I had to make the balances myself. 
When I called upon the District Clerks for their reports, many 
of them did not know that the law required them to make a 
report, and thought that I was making a new departure by re- 
quiring this report. In each case I referred them to the law. 
During the past year I have visited 119 schools out of 188 in 
the county, and am pleased to say that I found most of the 
teachers doing creditable work. Teachers and pupils appeared 
interested in their work, and I‘think the time not far distant 
when we can mark a new era in the public schools of Giles 
County. Very respectfully submitted, 
Mernzirt,Esicx, JR.,

GRAINGER County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—I herewith transmit to you my second annual 
report of the schools of Grainger County for the year ending 
June 80, 1890. The scholastic population for Grainger County 
is 5,226, an increase of 118 over last year. Institute work: Held 
8; they were largely attended; held: one Normal School con- 
vention one week; number of teachers attending, 61; number 
of first-grade certificates, 20; number of second-grade, 88; 
total, 58; a decrease of 3 over last year. The Directors have 
built three new houses this year. Pro rata per scholar, $1.38; 
an increase over last year of 15 cents. The increase is on 
account of 18 miles of railroad being completed last August. 
I think by another year we will have 30 miles more completed. 
I think Grainger County will soon have a five months’ school, 
and the teachers of this county will not be ashamed of their 
profession. Number of schools visited, 58; number of public
-P-A-G-E-120
— 115 — 
addresses, 58. I think the interest of cducation is advancing. 
The Directors of this county meet once a-year, and I think that 
is getting up some new life. We want Directors with more 
energy. I think when the next Legislature meets they should 
pass a law compensating the Directors for their labors. I think 
the advancement of education depends on the efforts of the 
Directors, so I think they should be rewarded for their services. 
The schools of this county have the largest attendance I ever 
knew. Yours respectfully, 
W. T. Sueperp, 
Superintendent. 
GREENE County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—Good news, Our schools are graded, and our 
teachers are doing better work. The people are well pleased 
with the graded course of study. I have visited almost every 
school—some of the schools twice—and gave brief talks to each 
school. 
Ihave held ten Institutes. The people took much interest in 
these educational meetings. They gave me a crowded house at 
every appointment, with one exception. 
Our attendance is much better this year. Last year we en- 
rolled 6,224 pupils. This year we have enrolled 9,174 pupils, 
showing an increase of 2,950. On last year we had an average 
attendance of 3,550. This year we have an average attendance 
of 7,870, showing an increase of 3,820. Our scholastic popula- 
tion numbered last year 10,754, so we have failed to enroll 1,580 
pupils. I am sorry of this. We ought to have enrolled a 
greater number. 
‘The Peabody Normal and Greene County Institute was held 
in Snopp’s Opera-house, Greeneville, Tenn., July 21-26, 1890.
-P-A-G-E-121

The State was represented by Capt. C. 8. Douglass and Prof. 
T. C. Karns, assisted by Supt. John W. Hyden, Profs. D. L. 
Earnest, J. K. P. Sayler, W. A. Ramsey, T. N. Haun, Misses 
Hattie Armitage, Robie Fitzgerald, Mary Trim, Mattie Mitchell, 
and others. ‘ 
The Normal was a grand success in every respect. I am 
grateful to you for said Normal. Your presence added much 
interest to the cause. 
Captain Douglass enshrined himself in the hearts and minds 
of our people. Professor Karns will forever occupy one fresh 
spot in the minds of our teachers. Superintendent Hyden did 
a noble work. His remarks aroused and enthused our people. 
We shall hold him in grateful remembrance. The Normal was 
addressed by such men as Hon. Frank M. Smith, Hon. A. H. 
Pettibone, Maj. R. M. McKee, Capt. James H. Robinson, Prof. 
J.T. Jordan, Hon. J. C. Park, and others. 
We enrolled more than 200 teachers, 6 County Superintend- 
ents, and several distinguished professors. So much for the 
Normal. : 
We need better school-houses, more money, better appliances, 
more intense earnestness, longer school-terms. 
May God speed the day when the people of Greene County 
will view this subject in its true and important light!

Duar Sir—Herewith find inclosed my annual report for the 
scholastic year just ended. I think the attendance’ on the 
schools this year was fuller, and the progress greater, than last,
-P-A-G-E-122
— 117 — 
which I attribute to improvement in teaching. Considerable 
progress has been made in uniformity of text-books. I have 
visited all my schools, and as a rule the discipline is very good. 
The teachers have kept their registers as required by law. 
Directors are more prompt to duty than heretofore, and parents 
are taking greater interest than formerly. So, upon the whole, 
I am proud of our progress, and I doubt whether there is a 
county in the State, away from the cities, excelling us. If there 
is any deficiency now it is in me, and not in the schools, County 
Court, or the people. I cannot close this communication with- _ 
out again speaking of our excellent new school-building at this 
place—the James K. Shook Oollege. This is a building of 
modern architecture, with all modern appliances, capable of 
comfortably seating eight hundred students. This, as you have 
already been informed, was a gift from Ool. A. M. Shook. I 
think that this munificent act of Col. Shook’s has done more to 
stimulate the people in the interest of education in this county 
than all others combined. In conclusion, always enroll my 
county on the side of progress and advancement, so that if I 
have left out any thing which was necessary for me to answer, 
my people may be placed on the right side.

Dear Str—Inclosed you will find my annual report for the 
scholastic year ending June 30, 1890. It is not full and correct 
in every respect, but as nearly so as can be expected under the 
circumstances. Teachers and District Clerks must be taught 
their duty (this I have tried to do) before the County Superin- 
tendent can secure statistics sufficient to have his report to the 
State Superintendent correct. J can safely say, however, that I 
have secured a better report from teachers and District Clerks 
for the year 1889 than has ever been secured heretofore.

Hamblen County greets you this year with the most efficient 
corps of teachers of which it has ever been her lot to boast. 
My first object bas been to make the examinations practical 
though thorough, and then to license only those who are com- 
petent. I consider no one thing a greater injury to our pub- 
lic schools than that of an unqualified person being licensed to 
teach in the same. : 
The patrons are more interested in the work of the schools 
than for many years. This is easily accounted for. Hamblen 
County boasts of live, energetic teachers, who are putting forth 
every effort to make the educational work a success. Hence, 
we are rapidly coming to the front. What we need to make 
our schools second to none are more good buildings well fur- 
nished, a few more first-class teachers. 
Respectfully,

. Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—In submitting my fourth annual report of the 
schools of Hamilton County, it is very gratifying to be able to 
show considerable progress made during the year. 
The .school-fund is gradually increasing, giving us longer 
terms, better buildings and equipments, and a higher grade of 
teachers. During the year eight school-buildings have been 
erected at a cost of $8,100, and a number of schools supplied 
with improved desks, leaving only a few remaining unsupplied. 
* 
The scholastic population has increased 1,425 during the year, 
and the enrollment and average attendance have increased in 
like proportion. Our annual Institutes were both well attended, 
and many of the methods learned therein are now in use in the
-P-A-G-E-124
— 119 — 
various schools of the county. We still hold our monthly 
teachers’ meetings, both white and colored, and the interest in 
them continues to grow. We are preparing to hold a county 
school-exposition in December, wherg the work of all the 
schools will be brought together for comparison.. The work 
will consist, principally, of every-day class-work, hence teachers 
will have an excellent opportunity of comparing methods and 
selecting the best. There will also be a teachers’ professional 
library department, where all books of this kind belonging to 
the county teachers will be placed for examination. 
In closing this report permit me to say that your wise counsel, 
from time to time, has aided me greatly in prosecuting the work, 
and on looking about me I find that public education throughout 
the State has taken new life during your able administration. 
Respectfully submitted,

Dear Sin—I have the pleasure of submitting to you my 
second annual report of the schools of Hancock County. I 
am very much pleased. with the educational strides our public 
schools are making. Our schools are improving steadily. The 
Directors are employing the best of teachers, paying them to 
work, and secing that they do it to an advantage. - The teachers 
of this county are taking more interest in their work and realiz- 
ing their situation as those engaged in one of the noblest callings 
of man. The most of them attended the Normal School and 
took an active part in the work, and are doing all they can to 
gain a thorough knowledge of the profession of school-teaching. 
T have held five Teachers’ Institutes in the county. We have 
seventeen school-districts in the county, and I have divided them
-P-A-G-E-125
— 120 — 
up into five Institute Districts, and hold a two days’ meeting of 
the teachers, patrons, and Directors of each district. I have in- 
troduced a course of study into the schools of this county which 
gives the teachers a basis from which to work. I have not been 
able to visit all the schools, but have made it a point to visit the 
sections where the teachers have had the least experience in’ 
teaching. 
I believe that the County Court is beginning to see the great 
wants of longer schools and to realize the great importance of 
the education of the boys and girls now subject to our public 
schools. I have done all in my power to improve the schools 
and to encourage education,and for a result the prospects for 
the future present themselves more brightly, which gives much 
encouragement to the friends of education in Hancock County. 
Yours respectfully,

Dar §1r—Inclosed herewith please find my annual report 
for the year ending June 380, 1890. « 
I am glad to say that in many respects it shows progress, 
Our schools have been able to run longer, and could have run 
a great deal longer if the Directors had not had 30 many schools. 
In many of the districts they have more schools than are nec- 
essary. 
I have spent much time in visiting the schools, and I find 
- much better and more satisfactory work being done in the 
school-room this year than I did last year, as our teachers are
-P-A-G-E-126
— 121 — 
improving in efficiency and taking more interest in their noble 
work. 
The increase in the school-fund is keeping the best of our 
young teachers in the profession, which is meeting the approba- 
tion of the people, as they are demanding a higher grade of 
teachers, which is a very marked degree of improvement. In 
conclusion, I can proudly say that the schools of the county are 
improving as rapidly and doing as’well as could be expected.

Dear Str—I inclose my second annual report of the schools 
of Hardin County. . 
Iam glad that I can say truthfully that our schools are im- 
proving. . ° 
Our teachers, as a class, are live, energetic, and striving to 
improve. I have succeeded in getting the teachers to form a 
permanent organization known as the Hardin County Teachers’ 
Institute. Regular meetings are held in various parts of the 
county, and are usually well attended by teachers and patrons. 
A number of our teachers have gone to work grading their 
schools. 
In June I held the County Normal Institute for the white 
teachers, and at the close I examined applicants for certificates, 
and complied with your suggestions and examined only those’ 
who attended the Institute three days prior to examination.
-P-A-G-E-127

‘We had the largest number of teachers in attendance that was 
ever had in the county. 
Our County Court, for the first time, made an appropriation 
for an Institute. 
A source of regret was that our State Superintendent could 
not be with us and aid us by his wise counsel. 
Our school in Savannah is on a “boom” under the super- 
vision of Professor Hanna. The Directors, with the trustees 
of Hardin College, have formed «4 consolidated school, which 
gives the town the benefit of a ten months’ free school. 
The high-school at Nixon, the free school at Saltillo and va- 
rious other places, are doing excellent work. 
The first week in July I held the Institute for colored teach- 
ers. The colored teachers are doing creditable work. 
After I made my report last year, it was found, upon inves- 
tigation, that the county was indebted to our school-fund $2,409. 
This has been settled by a note due January, 1891. Nearly all 
the money has been paid, but I am sorry that the court thought 
it necessary¢o decrease the school-tax to do this. Our Directors’ 
Institute is growing and being better attended. 
I have spent the summer in visiting the schools, and usually 
gave a short lecture on some educational topic. I am much 
better pleased with our schools this year, but hope they will be 
better next year. 
‘We have many obstacles to overcome, but the light has been 
turned on, and we are trying to press on in the educational 
work. Respectfully, 
Brssiz Moors,

Hawkins County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—Inclosed herewith please tind my annual report to 
you for the year ending June 30, 1890. I cannot say that it is 
by any means perfect; but as nearly so as I could make it un- 
der the circumstances. I find it very difficult to secure the in- 
formation from the Directors and teachers necessary to make a 
correct report of our public schools in every particular. Ithink 
the report is nearer correct this year than last. I am glad to 
note that all the Directors of my county are taking more inter- 
est in their schools than ever before. One of my first efforts 
after assuming the responsibilities of County Superintendent 
was to organize the School-directors of my county into an Ed- 
ucational Board. This I succeeded in doing April 1, 1889. At 
this meeting the Directors adopted a uniform series of text- 
books for the county for a period of seven years. This being 
oue good day’s work, as I thought, I let them rest until July 1 
following. I then calied them together again for the purpose 
of adopting a course of study for the schools of the county. 
They adopted a course of study consisting of seven grades. 
This, together with our uniform series of books, gave great in- 
terest and enthusiasm to our schools. It worked like a charm 
to all our schools. The patrons and children were all enthused 
and elated over the idea of securing public school diplomas. 
During the. year I had the pleasure of awarding twenty-four 
public school diplomas. I held monthly Teachers’ Institutes in 
various parts of the county during the school-term. After the 
- elose of the school-term‘we held our Institutes every two months. 
These Institutes were well attended, and great interest was taken 
in them by both teachers and patrons. At our last County In- 
stitute we succeeded in dividing the county into six subdivisions, 
to be known as Institute Districts. Each division chose an act- 
ive, wide-awake teacher for president; and we are now having 
as ‘many as six Teachers’ Institutes in Hawkins Couaty all on 
thesameday. These meetingsare monthly. During the month 
of November we hold our annual Institute. This continues 
in session for two days. This Institute is held in or near the
-P-A-G-E-129
-- 124 — 
central part of the county. It is being looked to by all our 
teachers as one of the grandest meetings of the year. 
I have conducted four Normal Schools in my county since 
my superintendency. These Normals have been well at- 
tended—more especially this year. This year our Normal for 
the white teachers continued in session for three weeks. I 
secured the services of Prof. Wm. M. Graybill, of Roanoke, 
Va., as conductor of the Normal. The Normal was the most 
successful, as well as the most largely attended Normal, ever 
held in the county. More than eighty teachers enrolled the 
first day. The enrollment ran up to 103 teachers during the 
session. More enthusiasm has never before been displayed by 
the teachers and people generally of the county in the cause of 
public education. 
At the close of the Normal, I conducted a written examina- 
tion of three days. The result showed great improvement of 
all the teachers attending the Normal. Our teachers were so 
highly pleased with the Normal this year that they decided to 
have a Normal next year without being called by the Superin- 
tendent, as heretofore. This, of itself, is very encouraging to 
the Superintendent, as it betokens interest in the cause of educa- 
tion on the part of the teachers. This idea of having to force 
out the teachers of the county every year is very disheartening. 
The teacher who attends his Normal through force and sheer 
necessity is never a successful teacher. It is much more pleasant 
to have them come out of their own free will and accord than 
to have to drag them out by a compelling power. 
Iam of the opinion that if the Superintendent will take and 
manifest the interest he has, and ought to have, in the improve- 
ment of the teachers of his county, that he will find it au easy 
task to call together all the teachers of his county i in his Normal 
Institutes. 
This year I called another Directors’ meeting for the purpose 
of adopting rules of government for the schools of the county. 
Our Directors adgpted a code of rules aimost identical with the 
rules adopted by our Public School-officers’ Association last
-P-A-G-E-130
— 125 — 
December. The Board adopted the following resolutions, which 
I consider due a place in my report: , 
“1, Resolved, That we request the County Superintendent to 
state on the head of each certificate whether the holder of the 
certificate attended the Normal School or not, and also the reason 
for non-attendance. 
“2. Resolved, That we give preference to those who attend 
the Normal School or Schools (grades being equal), and take 
advantage of the methods now being introduced by our best 
educators. 
“3. Resolved, That we demand the teachers to appear in their 
schools in decent and respectable apparel. 
“4. Resolved, That we will discontinue all schools (except 
special ones) when the average daily attendance falls below 
twelve pupils.” 
I have had our course of study, rules of government, adopted 
books, suggestions, etc., printed and put into good form for 
carrying in the vest pocket. Every teacher is required to be 
governed by the course of study and rules of government. Our 
rules of government have been very beneficial, especially to our 
- young teachers. Our population last year was 8,537; this year 
8,891—an increase of 8354. Our average school-term was eighty- 
four days last year; this year it will be more than one hundred 
days. This is very encouraging to the teachers. Our school- 
term has been so short heretofore that no one competent to 
teach desired a public school. The field is now full of good 
teachers, both men and women, who are active and full of zeal 
in the cause of education. I think I can safely say that the 
schools of Hawkins County are on a better basis than ever here- 
tofore, and that more interest is being taken in them than ever 
before in their history. I visited all the schools of my county 
once, and several of them from two to five times. In every 
school I gave the children and teachers all the encouragement 
‘that I could in my way. I feel that my visitations were not 
- without effect. Iam glad to say that the children do not regard 
“Ine ‘as an austere man, but as one of their best friends, This 
opinion I secured by having the teachers represent me to their
-P-A-G-E-131
— 126 — 
pupils as a friend, not as a man prepared to ask them hard and 
senseless questions. Ihave striven hard to make my teachers 
think that I am interested in their welfare and success as 
teachers. This I believe I have succeeded in doing. Hoping 
that. reports from Hawkins County shall continue to be of a 
character to give impetus to other counties, I am

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—This is my sixth and last report, and I am sorry 
that a more favorable and accurate one cannot be made—favor- 
able as to the standard and prosperity of the schools; accurate 
as to the statistics pertaining to them. Peculiar circumstances 
existing in the county for the past twenty-five years, affecting 
all the best interests of the people, the welfare of the county, 
could not have been favorable to a very high standard of public 
schools. Yet the schools have existed and even improved. 
They are more efficient, better attended, more thorough work 
is done, teachers are more proficient, and, from diminishing 
their number, have longer terms. -I believe that two years ago 
they were really in a state of greater promise, but the misappli- 
cation of the school-funds was a severe blow. Distribution by 
the State would have prevented this. These opposing circum- 
stances have been altered, and a brighter day is dawning; the 
people are beginning to recognize that their interests, and the 
welfare of the county, demand good free schools. This feeling 
will bring about a higher rate of taxation, better salaries for 
teachers as a consequence, and better teachers and better schools. 
We lack good professional white teachers owing to the want of 
good salaries. Most of our white teachers are amateurs; they 
teach for special -purposes, and the duration of their school-days 
as professors is brief, and they do not take the interest in
-P-A-G-E-132
— 127 — 
teachers’ meetings and Institutes, except to stay away. They 
do not wish to be known as, or called, school-teachers. Good 
salaries would encourage many to become professional teachers, 
and be an incentive to them to be diligent in their own improve- 
ment, and enlarge their hearts, increase their love, and develop 
their interest in their work and for their schools, 
Our school-laws need to be changed. A State system we may 
be said to have, but the State should control. Without such 
control there can be no proper and uniform system in all the 
counties alike; some will be, subject to unfortunate circum- 
stances of politics that may exist in the individual county, 
which do not exist in or affect the others. Our schools will im- 
prove, but will never be uniformly so throughout the State under 
the present laws. Educational interests should keep pace with 
the wonderful strides of the material progress of the State, and 
its free schools should be established on an equally prosperous 
footing everywhere. Will send Trustees’ statement when I can 
get it, which I trust will be soon enough.

Dzar Srr—You will please find inclosed the annual report of 
Hickman County. As this report is made from the work of 
two previous County Superintendents, it possibly contains some 
errors. 
A new Superintendent was elected at the January term of 
the court. He resigned at the July term, and I was chosen to 
fill out the unexpired time. I believe, however, that this re- 
port is tolerably correct. 
I believe the schools of this county aré in better condition
-P-A-G-E-133
— 128 — 
than ever before. I am aware that some of my figures are less 
than former reports, yet I think I have evidence that we are 
moving upward. 
We are making an effort to reduce the number of school-dis- 
tricts. We now have sixty-nine, whereas we should have fifteen. 
I believe it would be much better for every one interested to 
have the school-district identical with the civil district. 
The Directors of this county met before the schools began 
this year, and adopted “a uniform system of books” to be used. 
This has accomplished much good, and will very materially aid 
us in grading our schools. 
A Teachers’ Institute was organized early in the summer 
which is yet in good working order. All interested are won- 
dering why this was not accomplished sooner. Quite an inter- 
est is being manifested in these meetings. I will say right here 
that, since June 30, I have held two Institutes for the colored 
teachers. We have some very superior colored teachers, and 
they are much interested in this work. 
I think that a Normal Institute held by State Superintendent 
would improve us wonderfully, Very respectfully, 
W.V. Japratr, 
Superintendent.

Dezaxr Sitr—I inclose report of the common free schools of 
Houston County for the year ending June 30, 1890. I am 
proud to report material progress in the educational affairs of

* the masses in the common schools.
-P-A-G-E-134
— 129 — 
I called a meeting of the School-directors of the county on 
June 20, at which meeting we adopted a uniform series of 
text-books for the county. It has cost much trouble to ac- 
‘ complish this, but the advantages to the teachers, to the schools, 
“and to the people are much greater than most persons suppose. 
We have also adopted rules of government for the schools 
which are giving general satisfaction. We have been trying the 
graded system in the schools, and with some success, too. In 
some the grading is not very close, but, notwithstanding this, 
much good has resulted from the effort.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : : 
Dear Sir—In submitting to you my fourth annual report of 
the public schools of Humphreys County I am very glad to say 
the scholastic population has increased. Our schools were 
shorter on account of money. Back. taxes will come up and 
make up for the lost time. One thing in the public schools— 
non-attendance—is a dead weight. I am not too sure I have 
pursued the wisest course to secure full attendance. I never 
miss an opportunity to insist on this point. The schoollaw 
needs revising on this point surely. To make the tax-payer 
hand in school-tax, and then to say to the pupil that does not 
attend school the law does not say “you shall attend school,” but 
allows it to grow up in ignorance, while this money is extorted 
year by year from the tax-payers is inconsistent. If teachers 
would do.as they believe to be the best for improvement, some 
of our teachers think educational works, papers, aud Institutes 
would teach too much, because they do not take papers on 
educational and Institute work. Well, if you call for a talk 
from such teachers, the reply is, “Excuse, please.” The only 
9 .
-P-A-G-E-135
— 130 — 
wonder is the Directors fail to “excuse” when a teacher -is to 
be employed. Iam not to be understood by this exception that 
all are so. The greater part do admirably. 
This year Professor Karns, of Knoxville, and Professor 
Mynders, of Hartsville, held the Peabody Normal Institute at 
Waverly. We appreciate the work highly these gentlemen did 
while here, yet we looked for you, Superintendent Smith. 
The McAdow Seminary, at Waverly, is a superior school, 
and needs critical judgment and patronage—not praise—to 
make it one of the best schools in Tennessee. 
While in the past four years many changes have been 
wrought, yet so many more should be that it seems as if we 
progress slowly in school-work. ._- Respectfully,

to put the scholastic harness on just right. Daily attendance 
is much better in Jackson County than ever known before. We 
have been very successful in the Jackson County Institute. Our

Dear Str—IL herewith transmit to you my annual report for 
the year ending June 80, 1890. I have held a Normal School 
and two Institutes since my last report; the attendance was 
very good, and the work done was highly commendable. The 
teachers of the county are taking more interest in Institute 
work. When I first took charge of the work I could scarcely 
get a respectable number to attend our teachers’ meetings and 
Institutes; but I find it comparatively easy now to secure a 
‘good attendance. 
I sincerely hope that the next Legislature will revise the 
sciool-law and give us more school-money, and devise some 
plan of distribution that will give all school-districts the same 
number of school-days. Respectfully,

Dear S1r—I have the honor herewith to submit my first an- 
nual report (as I have only occupied this position since October, 
1889) for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1890. The edu- 
eational outlook for Johnson County is very flattering at the 
present time. 
A number of our teachers are rather young, but are making 
quite an effort to be up with the times in the modern modes of 
teaching. 
In July we had. a Normal School of four weeks’. duration, 
taught at Mountain City by Professor Robert Porter, A.M., of

Knoxvilie. Wehad a better attendance than we have ever had 
at a Normal in this county, and the teachers were greatly bene- 
fited by the efficient instruction of Professor Porter. 
On the twenty-fifth of July we organized a Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation at Mountain City to meet on last Saturday in each month. 
We have had two meetings, which have been well attended, 
creating quite an interest for a more thorough knowledge of 
the art of teaching. Respectfully, “

Nashville, Tenn.: 
Duar Srr—I herewith submit my second annual report of 
the publi¢e schools of Knox County for the scholastic year end- 
ing June 30, 1890. 
We have agfive months’ term in every district in the county, 
and in a few districts we have eight months’ term. We have 
revised the “course of study and rules for the government of 
the public schools of the county,” two thousand of which have 
been printed and distr buted : among the teachers, Directors, and 
patrons. The ves of Knox County are in a prosperous condition. 
The Normal Institute for the teachers of Knox County con- 
vened on the fourteenth day of July, 1890, at the public hall in 
the court-house, lasting one week. 
I was assisted in the Institute work by Prof. T. C. Karns, of 
the University of Tennessee. There were in attendance one 
hundred and fifty teachers. A number of lectures were deliv- 
ered during thé Normal by prominent educators, which were 
highly entertaining and iustructive. The forenoon of each day
-P-A-G-E-138
— 133 — 
was devoted to Normal work. The afternoon was devoted to 
the examination of teachers. 
The County Institute for colored teachers convened at the 
same place in connection with the State Normal Institute 
for colored teachers, on the twenty-third day of June, 1890, 
lasting one week. Prof. J. 8. Cobb, of Rogersville, Tenn., and 
W. J. Cansler, of. Knoxville, assisted in the work. There were 
fifty colored teachers present from different counties of East 
Tennessee. 
I have held seven Institutes for the teachers and Directors of 
the county, have visited the schools.once, and quite a number 
twice. 
T have granted sixty common school diplomas to pupils who 
have completed the “course of study.” I have examined and 
recommended for a free scholarship in the University of Ten- 
nessee, fifteen young men, all of whom received an appoint- 
ment, and are making good students. : 
We have organized a library for the teachers ofthe county, 
to be known as the Knox County Teachers’ Cirqilating Li- 
brary. The library is established in the office of ' County 
Superintendent.    
   
We have suitable rules and regulations governing the library. 
The teachers of the county contribute one dollar per year for 
the use of the library. We also get contributions from other 
sources. 
We have now placed in the library seventy-five volumes of 
various educational works. We expect to be ready to open the 
library at the beginning of the next term of school, at which 
time we intend to have at least two hundred books. 
This movement is one which we regard as of great impor- 
tance to the teachers of Knox County. When well established, 
it will give them access to the very best class of literature.

‘What we most need in our public schools is a “reading

Dear Sir—I have the honor of submitting to you, as required 
by law, my statistical report for the year ending June 30, 1890, 
giving the status of our county schools. The falling off in or 
decline in value of our school-property, is owing to Directors 
failing to keep up repairs as I urge them to do. I consider the 
change in the election of Directors a good one, as much con- 
fusion resulted from the old method. I hope you will urge in 
your next report a more advanced curriculum of studies. We 
are behind our sister States in that particular, and I feel assured 
it would secure us a better class of teachers. English, history, 
physiology, and natural philosophy ought to be adopted, and
-P-A-G-E-140

the elements of agriculture and geology of Tennessee ought 
to be expunged, as the last two are not practical. 
Very respectfully,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: : : 
Dear Str—Please find inclosed my annual report, which I 
regret is not only late but incomplete, owing to circumstances 
over which I have no control. I am pleased to report very 
material improvement in the schools during the past scholastic 
‘year. There was an-additional school-tax last year, and there 
was from four to six months’ school throughout the county, 
with one or two exceptions where some of the funds were used 
for building, repairing, ete. I presume the longer school-term 
had, to a great extent, a very beneficial effect upon the schools, 
which I fear will be counteracted the present year, since it was 
left to the people whether there should be a tax or notfor school- 
purposes, and it was voted down. It is my cision desire 
a more useful class of citizens, we must make theif f bre intel- 
ligent by education. We need a tax suflicient for six months’ 
school each year, since the cotton interest here would prevent 
schools of longer duration than three months in summer and 
three in winter. You will see from my report that there is a 
larger per cent. of attendance in proportion to population of 
colored children than whites. In visiting the white schools I 
find them full to overflowing during the first month, and by the 
close of the second I frequently find such small attendance that 
it hardly justifies keeping the schools open, and at times I am 
almost tempted to advocate compulsory education for children 
from eight to fourteen years. My returns are not complete from 
either District Directors or teachers. For the first I would 
recommend better pay, in order to secure greater interest, and 
in some cases more efficient officers. For the latter, better pay
-P-A-G-E-141
— 136 — 
and the éontract requiring that abstracts be handed in before 
receiving an order for their last month’s pay. It is a rare thing 
I ever get an abstract from the consolidated schools. LI still 
repeat that I believe that physiology should be substituted for 
geology in the public schools. Last, though not by any means 
least, I think the school-fund should be better protected. 
Very respectfully, 
Mrs. L. A. Warkrns, 
Superintendent. 
Lawrence County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—Although I made out and sent my statistical re- 
port to you in September, it seems that I am late in sending 
this written report. The reason for this lateness and seeming 
carelessness is this: It has been my custom, until this year, to 
visit the schools very soon after their commencement, while at 
their best as to attendance. This year I have thought best to 
wait until later in the term, so as to see what the attendance 
would vl the close of the school-term. 
Since making out the before-mentioned. report, I have visited 
quite a number of schools, the most of which had commenced 
late in the season; and I find those schools with much better 
attendance at this late time of the year than those that began 
early in July. I also find the pupils full of energy instead 
of “duli and depressed” as they seem to be in summer. This 
is another convincing proof, to my mind, that summer is not 
the proper time to run our public schools in Tennessee, but 
that we should construct good school-buildings, even if we must 
suspend the schools for one year, and use the money to purchase 
material and put up suitable houses to have the schools taught 
during the autumn and winter. I am well convinced that 
a child will learn as much in two months of winter school, pro- 
vided he is comfortably situated, than he will, ordinarily, in
-P-A-G-E-142
— 187 — 
three or four months of asummer term. The greater number 
of our schools in this county are taught in churches, most of 
them of the old pattern—too large and too open for any but 2 
short, mild-weather school. And unless we take the public 
school-funds—as they are beginning to do in some localities— 
and build good school-houses at once, and change the time of 
having our schools taught, we cannot, reasonably, expect much 
improvement. 
The unsuitable and poorly equipped school-houses are not 
confined strictly to Lawrence County. I have been in some of 
our neighboring counties, and I find it just the same there as 
here—old, weather-beaten, decayed shanties, fit for nothing but 
dry-weather stove-wood. This state of things ought not to 
exist. . 
In a finely-timbered country, filled, too, with good building- 
stone, and blessed with every thing else with which to construct 
comfortable and beautiful buildings in which our children 
would take a delight to attend the schools, instead of abhorring 
them as it now is, it is no credit to us to behold so many of these 
old shanties—not fit for cow-sheds. 
I have spoken at some length upon this subject of school- 
houses, because, perhaps, I have given it more careful thought 
than ever before; and because I see the people erecting better 
dwellings for themselves and constracting more commodious 
buildings for their various kinds of stock; but the old storm- 
shattered shanty, in which their children must sit with cold and 
dangling feet from the ancient, backless, “four-pegged slab,” for 
nine long hours a day, trying to obtain an education—that build- 
ing remains the same, except its going surely to decay. 
The question now comes up before us: What must we do?” 
Js it right to take the school-funds and build houses? Many of 
our people think we cannot, and comply with the intent and 
apirit of the law. Our school-people here would most certainly 
take some steps in providing better houses if they were sure 
they would not be violating the law in so appropriating the
-P-A-G-E-143
— 188 — 
money. Please give us some advice on this subject in a short 
circular, or let the next session of the General Assembly make 
the law more specific upon this particular point, and appoint 
some particular time or year for this change to take place in 
localities where it is so much needed. 
I must not close this report without giving the School- 
directors, teachers, and all concerned, that praise which they 
justly deserve. I must say for them that in almost every in- 
stance where and when I have called for any report, or any 
information concerning the schools, they have cheerfully and 
promptly responded. The completeness of my statistical report 
to you, was, in a great measure, due to the promptness of teach- 
ers and Directors. Many of the schools, at the time of making 
the report, had not been visited, on account of bad weather; I 
simply wrote to them for reports, and was answered forthwith 
by a “host” of Directors’ reports and teachers’ abstracts. These, 
with the statistics I already had filed, enabled me to make a 
complete report. Wishing the schools and school-system of 
Tennessee great success, I am, very truly yours, 
W. K. Lackey, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sirr—I herewith transmit to you my annual report for 
the year ending June 30, 1890. I think it is as nearly correct 
as it is possible to make it from the reports and statistics I have 
been able to gather. Ihave Jabored very hard to get our Di- 
rectors and teachers to make out their reports at the proper 
time, but have not fully succeeded in getting all to do this yet. 
Iam glad to say that I think there is considerable improve- 
ment in our schools. Last year, coming in at the time I did, 
I could not-visit all the schools tefore some were out; but this 
year I have visited most of them, and expect, if life and health
-P-A-G-E-144
— 139 — 
permit, to visit the remainder, while I intend to visit some of 
the first visited again. 
You will see, by comparing this report with that of former 
years, that there has been a little improvement al! along the 
line; but I hope for still greater improvement to be seen by the 
time our present work is reported. Respectfully submitted, 
J. R. Browy, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dnar Sir—I have the pleasure to herewith submit my annual 
report as County Superintendent of Public Instruction for Lin- 
coln County, Tennessee, for the year ending June 30, 1890. 
Last year my report was not an encouraging one. It is much 
better this year. We have introduced a graded system with a 
uniform course of study into about three-fourths of our schools 
during the terms just ending. It receives the hearty approval 
of teachers and parents, and will be adopted by our remaining 
schools next year. 
By close economy and reducing the number of schools, we 
have been able to extend the length of our schools over last 
year, although our tax was the same—fifteen cents. 
One feature of our work this year, to which we invite your 
special attention, is our Institutes. Our teachers have held 
regular monthly Institutes or association meetings. This was 
a new feature, and, while not attended with the success desired, 
it has been productive of great good. In June, Capt. ©. 8. 
Douglass’ valuable assistance was secured to conduct a week’s 
Institute. You, of course, know the presence of Captain Doug- 
lass insured us success. About seventy-five teachers were én- 
rolled. They were expressive in their praise of the Captain’s
-P-A-G-E-145
— 140 — 
‘methods. His lectures were real gems, and stimulated our 
teachers greatly. The work was practical, every-day school- 
room business, and, though the first one held in the county for 
years, it was no hard matter to get the teachers to work. I 
suppose Captain Douglass will make a fail report to you of his 
week with us. 
On the whole, our school-interests are looking up in Lincoln. 
Yours truly, 
L. K. Tayzor, 
Superintendent. 
Loupon County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—Our schools have made fair advancement for the 
past year. We had a most excellent Normal Institute this sum- 
mer. It numbered sixty-five, and we were in session five days. 
We have visited every school in the county and addressed each 
of them. All of our schools are graded. Some are not so well 
classified as others, but all are marching to the front. We have 
many good men and women engaged in teaching, but we have 
a few who are only keeping school for the money there is in it. 
Our County Court is liberal and wide awake toward the growth 
and development of our schools. Directors in some districts 
show interest, while in others no interest is manifested. We 
have more money than we had a few years ago. Our schools 
run longer, salaries of teachers are better, schools are graded, 
and, in fact, the school-work is improving as the years go by. 
Very respectfully, 
Joun W. Hypen, 
Superintendent.

Macon County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Publie Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—I herewith submit my annual report for the scho- 
lastic year ending June 80, 1890. While the educational work 
in Macon County for the past year has not been crowned with 
as much success as some of us desired, yet it has moved along 
in. a progressive manner. Our school-fund is not sufficient to 
support our schools as they should be. We have already fifty 
districts in this county, with a scholastic population, this year, 
of 4,287, and still they want more districts. With this great 
number of districts there are several dwarfs among them that 
have eight or ten weeks’ school each year. The condition of 
my health has been such that, to date, I have visited only 
twenty-six of the sixty-one public schools that are running in 
my county this fall. So far, I tind the enrollment and attend- 
ance, until fodder-pulling came along, better than for some 
years. Our schools, with a few exceptions, are using the 
adopted series, and being very well classified, the good results 
of which, it seems, are clearly visible in a great majority of our 
schools. I have done all that it seems is necessary to induce 
the teachers to read educational journals, and have succeeded 
in getting several to subscribe. I find those teachers who read 
journals and works upon theory and practice doing better work 
than the other class. Our schools for the past year did good 
work; but much of their usefulness is impaired, year by year, 
by the ignorance, carelessness, and, in some districts, partiality 
of Directors. 
We had no Normal or Institute this year for the white 
teachers, but a colored Normal of four weeks was conducted by 
Mr. H. TH. DeWitt, of Gallatin, Tennessee. In order to accom- 
modate the greatest uumber of our colored teachers, the Normal 
was held near Echo, in the south-western portion of the county, 
that being the locality in which the great majority of our col- 
ored people live. The Norma] was well atteuded, there being 
an average daily attendance of about twenty. Mr. DeWitt 
seems to be thoroughly up with the times in that line of work, 
and prepared to meet pretty much any emergency.
-P-A-G-E-147
—. 142 — 
While the State Superintendent is striving year after year 
through every known avenue to elevate and improve the teach- 
ers, I am decidedly of the opinion that the standard of County 
Superintendents should be elevated. 
It seems that before a person should be eligible to the office 
of County Superintendent, he or she should first procure from 
the State Board of Education a certificate of qualification of 
the grade of county certificate of the first-grade, which may be 
granted on an examination held before said Board or upon a 
written examination held by certain county officers and some 
competent person selected by them, upon a series of questions 
prepartd and furnished under seal by said State Board of Edu- 
cation to one of said officers, and by him kept under seal until 
the hour of examination, and then opened in the presence of 
the other examiners and the applicants for certificates. 
Let said examinations be held in every county in the State 
on the same day, which should precede the election of County 
Superintendent some two months; and the written answers of 
each examination to be immediately forwarded to said State 
Board, together with some fee to be fixed by law, and the sworn 
statements of the officers and person selected by them that the 
examination had been conducted in their presence and in strict 
accordance with the law, and that no applicant had, directly or 
indirectly, received assistance. 
The State Board of Examiners might, if they deemed the 
answers sufficient, grant a certificate; and, if they refused it, 
should notify the aforesaid county officers, aud no certificate 
should then be granted the said applicant for the election then 
pending. 
I have held two public examinations this summer for the 
white applicants, in which I examined about. sixty. Some six 
or seven teachers were licensed without examination, their quali- 
fications being such as I thought entitled them to certificates 
without examination. My. examinations were written. The 
colored teachers, with the exception of some two or three, were 
examined by written examination at the close of their Normal.

Dear Srr—] forward my ‘annual report. With many new 
and comfortable sthool-buildings furnished with improved 
desks, blackboards, and charts, I may safely say that our educa- 
tional machinery is in better gear than at any previous time. 
Your first suggestion to me on school-matters was that we 
could not have schools without suitable houses in which to con- 
duct them, and that my efforts should be directed immediately 
to this end. As the result of your suggestion and my action 
thereon, I have seen, in the last three years, commodious houses 
built in almost every district in the county, and good furniture 
placed in many of them. This state of things secures better 
teachers and adds to their enthusiasm in school-work. I find 
that good houses and better teachers have corrected many ir- 
regularities and troubles previously existing in divided neighbor- 
hoods. I would suggest to my brother Superintendents who 
visit dilapidated, uninviting school-houses that no work they 
can do will tell more readily and effectively than that directed 
to building good houses,” The public schools have the moral 
support of our best citizens, and will continue to improve and 
bestow their blessings alike on the rich and poor.

very well. During the past two years I have done ail in my 
power to advance the grand cause of education, and to awaken 
an interest among the Directors and patrons of the schools, and | 
I am proud to state that many changes for good have been 
wrought. 
It affords me much pleasure to say that the schools of old 
Marshall are steadily pressing their way to the front, and I hope 
erelong to see them take the lead. 
Our colored schools are improving very faat. At'their Institute 
this year there was an increase of teachers and an increase in 
interest. AIl of them seem to be striving for an education, and 
we have some very bright minds in the colored race. : 
In conclusion, I will say we need longer school-terms and the 
County Superintendent paid a salary that will justify him in 
devoting his entire time to the business.

Dear Sir—I have the honor of submitting herewith my 
statistical report for Maury County for the year ending June 
80, 1890. While the report is not accurately correct in every 
particular, still it is approximately correct, and shows substan- 
tially the condition of the schools of Maury County. It is with 
much pride that I report increased attendance on our public 
schools. Our schools are gradually growing better. Our 
Directors’ meetings and Teachers’ Institutes have accomplished 
very much good. The masses of the people. throughout the 
county are manifésting much more interest than before. Our 
teachers ought to be compelled by law to attend our Institutes,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—I herewith submit my second annual report of the 
public schools of MeMinn County. In accordance with instruc- 
tions received from you, I held, instead of one, two County 
Normal Institutes, which were well attended by teachers and 
some friends of education. Prof. N. B. Goforth, of Riceville 
Institute, rendered valuable service, attending and working 
through both schools. I was assisted by others of experience. 
Quite a number of our teachers read school-journals, and are 
making progress in methods of teaching. The teachers of 
this county now, both white and colored, are nearly all first- 
class in their attainments. Quite a number are graduates 
from high seats of learning. Among the colored teachers 
are several graduates from the colored normal school at Mary- 
ville, Blount County, Tenn. The school facilities for this 
county are very good. A few schools continue ten months in 
the year, the people agreeing to pay tuition when the public 
fund is exhausted. In addition to these, we have the college 
at Athens, with an enrollment, annually, of three hundred or 
more from different States. 
Cog Hill and Chilhowee Institutes, near the line of the Knox- 
ville Southern Railroad, and Mouse Creek and Riceville, on the 
East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad, are doing good 
work. You will see from these facilities that we are not want- 
ing in opportunities. 
We have’a uniform series of text-books for this county. The 
10 ,
-P-A-G-E-151
—146 — 
schools, all things considered, are very well attended. In some 
localities sickness among the pupils has prevented a good at- 
tendance. The people are becoming more and more interested 
in education. The educational outlook is more favorable than 
heretofore, Very truly yours, 
J. R. Lawrence, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—Inclosed you will find my annual report of the 
schools of McNairy County for the year ending June 30, 1890. 
While our schools are not so good as I would like for them 
to be, I think we have made much improvement since my last 
report. The interest is increasing rapidly. Nearly half of the 
districts have decided to have their free schools in the winter. 
In all of’our Institutes we have discussed the subject, When 
is the best time for our free schools? The majority have said 
winter. ’ : 
I have held four Institutes—three for the whites and one for 
the colored. They were all well attended. We had some ex- 
cellent workers at the Normal Institute at Purdy in June. I 
have the colored teachers better organized than the whites. 
On account of sickness, I visited only twenty-seven schools 
this summer, and delivered twenty-five lectures. 
’ There has been only one good school-house erected in this 
county this year. ‘I'here has been but little school-furniture 
bought in this county this year. 
I will make my story short by saying that we are in better 
condition than ever before in this county.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: - 
Dear Str—A, failure on the part of some of the Directors to 
make reports on time has delayed me in making this report, 
which I hope may not give you any great inconvenience. I 
have had some extra trouble in getting reports from teachers 
and Directors; some of the best teachers in the county have 
not returned their abstracts. I have gone over the county, and. 
from my observations and reports made to me, I make my re- 
port to you. My report is as near correct as I can get it with 
the information at hand. 
The past year we have built six good, comfortable, schoo)- 
houses, and the spirit of building continues to grow. I hope 
erelong to see old, dilapidated log-houses torn away and good 
ones built in their stead. We need more and better buildings in 
the county. In last July we held a Normal Institute, in which 
the teachers and people expressed themselves well pleased. We 
were assisted by Prof. 8. W. Gage, of Roane County, and 8. W. 
Tate, of the Decatur High-school, and G. B. Hodge, of Missouri, 
who were untiring in their efforts to lift up the young teachers 
of the county. We had a good attendance from first to last, 
and it is to be hoped that great good was accomplished. We 
were assisted in the examination of teachers by Profs. 8. W. 
Tate and J. L. Buckner, who rendered valuable service. In 
the written examination, which was conducted more rigidly than 
ever before, I found that our teachers are making great improve- 
ments. Our teachers, as a general rule, are giving better satis- 
faction in their daily school-work than ever before. Our greatest 
drawbacks now are a want of money and an irregular attendance 
of pupils. We adopted a uniformity of text-books and a course 
of study for our schools last June. Our teachers are trying to 
grade their schools this year, and are succeeding right well. 
Our District Institutes are doing better work this year than 
last. I believe the quickest way to reach our people, and to 
build up an interest in them, is by these meetings. While our
-P-A-G-E-153
— 148 — 
progress has not been as great as that of more favored counties, 
still I hope erelong to see our schools characterizing a name 
that will unfurl our banner among the loftiest heights of edu- 
cational honors of the grand old State of Tennessee.

Dezar‘Sir—Inclosed you will find my annual report for the 
schools of Monroe County. I thought one year ago that this 
year’s report would show better than my report for last, year, 
put the enrollment is fewer and also the daily attendance is not 
as large as last year. The schools and school-work, however, 
were much better. The First District, in which Sweetwater is 
located, held over their money, as you probably remember, for 
the purpose of having a city high-school. This kept out of the 
public schools about three hundred pupils. However, the pupils 
were generally in the private schools of the town. We have the 
high-school now running in a flourishing condition, with Prof. 
Thos. L. Bryan, principal. There were houses built in two 
other districts in which there were no schools. This, I think, 
fully explains the reason for the falling off in attendance. 
I am confident that the school-work and interest are advanc- 
ing year by year in Monroe County. 
Beginning on the thirtieth day of June, 1890, I held a two 
weeks’ Normal Institute. There was a good attendance from 
first to last. I was assisted by Superintendent John W. Hyden, 
of Loudon. County, also Profs. J. C. Hicks, of Bolivar Acade- 
my, Madisonville; J. C. Miller, of ‘Tulogahler College, Eve 
Mills; J. S. Cline, of Second District, Sweetwater; J. I. Ste- 
phens, of Fourteenth District, Belltown. We had with us

Pres. J. H. Brunner, D.D., of Hiwassee College; Rev. F. M. 
Grace, D.D., of Hiwassee College; Prof. G. W. Huddleston, 
of the same college; Prof. J. L. Bachman, of Sweetwater Male 
College; and ninety or one hundred teachers of greater or less 
distinction. 
On the fifth and sixth of October of this year we had a two 
day’s Institute at Hiwassee College. This was reasonably well 
attended, and the teachers showed considerable interest. 
There was a night exercise, in which Miss Sallie Dyer gave a 
reading exercise to the satisfaction of a large and appreciative 
audience: There was a debate, also, upon an educational sub- 
ject. 
Taking all in all, I feel sure that Monroe County is gaining 
ground in educational interest. We appreciate the labors of our 
worthy State Superintendent, Hon. Frank M. Smith.

on account of getting report from the Trustee and some of 
the Directors. 
We held a Normal School at Wartburg in July for four weeks, 
under the management of Prof. D. R. Case, of Rugby, the last 
week being an Institute, which was largely attended. . 
Nearly all the teachers were licensed on the twenty-fifth of 
July, and commenced schools the-first Monday in August. I

have spent most of my time since then in visiting schools, and

I prepared a course of study, and we are grading our schools 
this year. Our books are uniform. 
“We can run our schools from five to seven months this year. 
There is a school in reach of every child in the county. Our 
houses are not as good as they should be; some log-houses, and 
not well furnished with desks, blackboards, ete. Only two 
houses are furnished with patent desks, but most of them have 
good, home-made desks. If the County Court continues to be 
as liberal in levying school-tax as it has been for the last two 
years, we will soon have good and well-furnished houses all 
over the county. 
There are only forty-seven colored population, and they are. 
promiscuously scattered along the railroads, hence no colored 
schools. Respectfully submitted, 
A. D. Wittams, 
Superintendent.

Dear Srr—I send you herewith my second annual report for 
the year ending June 80, 1890. 
I am glad to be able to report that the schools of my county 
are in a healthy and prosperous condition. When I first came 
into office I was somewhat alarmed over the condition of things, 
but subsequent investigation has relieved me to a very great 
extent. Itfind the people of the county alive and taking a keen 
and intelligent interest in matters pertaining to education. 
They are interested in securing better houses and better facili- 
ties generally. The log school-house will soon be a thing of the

past with us. Let them go. It marks another educational 
epoch, 
With regard to our teachers, I do not think, taking every 
thing into consideration, I can say too much in their praise. 
Nearly all of them have made special preparation for school- 
work, and right well are they doing their part. I have been in 
most of the schools of the county, and I know that earnest and 
intelligent work is being done. 
The people of the county, generally, are wide awake upon 
matters pertaining to education. I am very glad; indeed, that 
such is true. The fact is, Obion County should lead in schools 
and every thing else. The intelligence of her citizenship, their 
energy and public spirit, coupled with the richness and fertility 
of its soil, should enable them to lead the world. I am

Dzar Srr—Inclosed you will find my second annual report 
for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1890. 
Iam proud to say for Overton County that our educational 
interests are advancing. A large number of our teachers are 
well qualified, and are doing good work. 
During June I employed Prof. A. H. Roberts to conduct a 
two weeks’ Normal at Livingston, the connty seat, which was 
a brilliant success. There were sixty-eight teachers in attend- 
ance, and considerable interest was manifested by the people 
throughout the county. —_

In conclusion, permit me to return my sincere thanks to you 
for the aid you have given the cause of education in Overton 
County and the State of Tennessee. Respectfully, 
I. B. Les, 
Superintendent. 
Perry County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: . 
Duar Str—Inclosed herewith please find my annual report 
for the year ending June 30, 1890. 
The school-interest of Perry County is steadily growing. 
You see from the report that the attendance is better than last 
year. Weare gradually getting a better grade of teachers. 
We have forty-nine public schools in this county, taught 
mostly by our own county boys and girls. I find a good num- 
ber of them teaching three months for seventy-five dollars who 
never taught before for less than thirty dollars per. month. 
They say they want our county to have not less than three 
months’ school. 
Linden, our county site, has a good school taught by Prof. 
W. A. Edwards, one of our county boys, who has been off 
teaching in- other States for a number of years. 
‘We need a uniform series of text-books in this county. I 
have held three Institutes; did not have as good attendance as 
I did last year. Some of our Directors are changing their 
schools, where they have two in the same district, into one, 
which has caused some little confusion; but I think the people 
will be all right when they see this is best for their schools. 
Yours, 
W.R. THompson, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—lI herewith transmit to you my annual report for 
Pickett County for the year ending June 380, 1890, which has 
been delayed a few days on account of getting the Directors’ 
reports. 
I am glad that I can make a more favorable report than I 
have made in any of the three years of my work. We have 
tried to strictly adhere to the written method of examining teach- 
ers, and have only given those certificates who actually merited 
them; and I have actually refused to examine men whose char- 
acter was as black -as tar, which has caused a river of clear 
water, and, as a result, better schools, 
We have our school-districts in better condition this year 
than last, having made the school-districts identical with the 
civil districts, and the Directors seem to be doing their duty 
better than usual, and the people and patrons generally seem to 
be more interested in the welfare of he schools than I have 
ever known. Directors have come to better understand their 
duties, and to appreciate the importauce of the trust confided 
to them, and are building new and better school-houses, and are 
arranging for better accommodations for the children. 
The majority of our.teachers are worthy of their vocation, 
and are surely, though slowly, advancing all along the line, and 
our teachers are all doing noble work this year. The average 
daily attendance and number on roll is the largest ever noted 
for this county, which shows that the school-interest is on rising 
ground. 
We have held several teachers’ meetings this year, with great 
success, having a large attendance both of teachers and patrons 
of schools; and we would be pleased to have the help of our 
worthy State Superintendent in our Institute next year. It is 
true that we are located in a mountainous country, but we have 
noble talents here that need cultivation. .
-P-A-G-E-159
— 154 — 
And now, in conclusion, I will say.that this will close my 
fourth year as Superintendent of this county, and during my 
term of office I have had many difficulties to overcome, es- 
pecially in the examination of teachers; but I am glad that I 
can say that in every case I have discharged my duty, and feel 
that I can close my work leaving the county in much better 
condition than I found it. Respectfully,

Superintendent.

Dear Sir—I herewith submit to you my annual report for 
1890. . 
Our Normal was interesting and well attended. Prof. H. H. 
Kellogg and Prof. I. J. Wood did noble work for our teachers. 
We have had regular monthly teachers’ meetings, which have 
been well attended. 
Our people are becoming more interested in school-work. 
‘We have built some good school-houses this year, and expect 
to build more in the near future. 
We lack money to run our schools longer. However, there 
has been a decided improvement in our county.

my second annual report for the scholastic year ending June 
30, 1890.
-P-A-G-E-160
155 — 
This report is not absolutely correct, but approximately so. 
Some of my teachers failed to send in their abstracts. 
I am very much gratified with the schools this year. With 
a few exceptions, the schools are good, and are moving on well. 
Some of the Directors and the people are working hard to im- 
prove and build up their schools. The teachers of this county 
are taking more interest in their work, and acting as befitting 
those engaged in one of the noblest callings of man. 
From year to year we have had great opposition to Institutes 
in Putnam County, but why it isso I am unable to state. Know- 
ing the importance of an Institute, and the advantage the former 
Institutes had been to the teachers of Putnam County, I worked 
assiduously to get one up, and my efforts were crowned with 
success, We employed Professors Gross, Wood, and Thomp- 
son to teach our Normal. They are educators of the first grade. 
They did noble work for the teachers of Putnam County. All 
the teachers that attended were well pleased, and expressed 
themselves as being willing to attend for two weeks next year. 
The Teachers’ Institute is a great power in the Jand for good. 
_ It has done much to arouse intelligent thought in teachers, and 
to awaken public sentiment in favor of education. I have 
visited nearly all the schools in the county, and I found them 
doing well. Our schools are doing good work this year, but 
there is room for improvement. 
The teachers’ monthly meetings, which I held in different 
parts of the county, added greatly to our success. We think 
these educational meetings of the greatest importance in awak- 
ening public sentiment in favor of education. I have done 
every thing in my power to advance the educational interest 
of my county, and I am proud that many changes for good 
have been wrought. Iam glad to say that the schools of Put- 
nam County are steadily pressing forward, and before many 
years I hope to see them in the lead. Respectfully, 
‘W. H. Carr,

Dear Sr—Inclosed you will find my second annual report. 
I take pleasure in saying that the educational interest in our 
county continues to increase slowly. ‘here is more interest in 
this county this year than has been before. We have more 
money than ever before, and will have longer schools. They 
will last from four to six months this year in most of the dis- 
, tticts. In some of the small districts, where the scholastic pop- 
ulation is small, they will not last more than three or four mouths. 
We held no Normal in Rhea. I held written public examina- 
tions; have no text-books adopted here, only recommended 
for adoption. The Directors will not adopt any. The teachers 
are trying to work the same books into the schools. The col- 
ored schools are doing well in this county. The attendance, 
both white and colored, is thirty per cent. greater this year than 
last. I have visited most of the schools in this county, and 
find the teachers in good spirits, with good attendance.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction,

Dear Sir—I regret that this report has been delayed to this 
time, but hope it will arrive in time to prevent any delay in the 
preparation of your report. Owing to serious illness in.our 
Trustee’s family, I could not get his report at the proper time. 
My statistical report is not exact in many respects, but, with 
all papers received, is the best I can give. 
Our Normal Institute was held the second week in July; was 
largely attended, and did a very excellent work. Our Insti-
-P-A-G-E-162
— 157 — 
tutes have been poorly attended, yet, we think, much good has 
been accomplished in them. . 
There bas been nothing miraculous in the progress of schools 
in our county. The best teachers have retired, owing to poor 
inducement in the way of salaries. In.some districts the Di- 
rectors have decided to pay only $25 per month for the services 
of any grade of teachers. This, you know, will drive our best 
teachers from the school-room to other positions; and still the 
people complain at the Superintendent for sending out so many 
young and inexperienced teachers. 
I visited sixty-three schools during the year. 
Our greatest trouble is in securing the proper text-books and 
the best teachers. With all this to overcome, and best wishes 
for the cause, I am, Respectfully, 
J. A. GILREATH, 
Superintendent. 
Ropertson County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—tin this, my fourth annual report, it is my pleasure 
to announce the gradual but constant advance of our public 
schools in efficiency and usefulness, and of our school-system in 
the estimation and appreciation of our people, who now fully 
realize that the public schools are their only dependence for the 
education of their children at home. Private schools are not 
now attempted at all, except in five or six towns of the county 
where academies are conducted by private enterprise. The 
public schools are consolidated with these academies, and the 
principals continue the remainder of the year on their own ac- 
count after the public fund is exhausted. , 
A convention of School-directors and teachers was called for
-P-A-G-E-163
— 158 — 
by the: Superintendent, which met in Springfield, May 81, 
That convention adopted unanimously the graded course of 
study and the rules for the government of schools recommended 
by the last State Convention of Publie School-officers. They 
also adopted a uniform series of text-books for the county, all 
of which I have had published in neat and durable form, and 
have distributed to teachers and Directors. I shall endeavor to 
have this measure fairly tested in all the schools, and I have no 
doubt as to the good results. 
The average number of days taught was 984, an increase of 
154 over the year before. We expect a still greater increase in 
the average this year. My report shows also an increase in en- 
rollment, but a decrease in daily attendance, which latter is ac- 
counted for by the prevalence of measles in every district of the 
county during the term.. The same cause produced a consider- 
able increase in average cost of tuition. The average compen- 
sation of teachers increased from $31 to $33.81, which I regard 
as a favorable indication. 
Our annual Institute for white teachers was held in Spring- 
field, and continued fifteen days. There was a large increase in 
interest and attendance over any previous year. The colored 
Institute was also held in Springtield, continuing eighteen days 
with same results. The examinations show very gratifying re- 
sults as to proticiency of applicants for certificates. Though 
the examinations were comprehensive, all written, and all papers 
were closely graded, only.one of the fifty white applicants failed, 
and a majority secured first grade. These annual Institutes 
have been a great stimulus to our young teachers. Those who 
have attevded the last four years find it easy to secure almost 
perfect certificates, and some of them this year get $50 per month. 
The outlook for our schools is encouraging, and, with the con- 
tinued co-operation of our County Court, they will soon become 
the pride and the boast of our grand old county of Robertson.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—I once more have the pleasure of submitting my 
annual report of the schools of Rutherford County. 
Iam exceedingly glad to be able, from reports gathered, to state 
in my report that we have gained some footing in the progress 
of building our schools. in this county. In this we are proud of 
our success, considering the difficulties that confront us on 
every side. : 
The most of the School-directors are working to build up 
the schools in their respective districts. The work that is being 
' done by the school-officers is having good effect so far as the 
upbuilding of the schools is concerned, having opened new 
schools in localities where there has been no schools, thereby 
accommodating a great many little urchins that have heretofore 
been neglected and gone uncared for and left for many years 
to grow up uneducated, hence they have been left without the 
good and beneficial influences of a school and the valuable in- 
structions of the noble teachers. . We are still improving the 
school-houses and grounds, building new ones, buying good 
furniture, maps, globes, charts, etc. We now have the best 
corps of teachers that the county ever had. Our school-officers 
are hunting for the best and paying for them. In fact, the Di- 
rectors are doing better work than usual. 
The desire for good teachers was so great this year that we 
could not supply the demand at home, but by writing to the 
bureaus of education, Virginia, aud other States, we finally suc- 
ceeded in getting what we wanted. 
We will at an early date have a joint meeting of School- 
directors, Trustees, and teachers of the county for the purpose 
of forming a union between all school-officers, teachers, and 
parties interested in the increase of the schools of. the county. 
At this meeting we will attempt to formulate rules by which we
-P-A-G-E-165
— 160 — 
will be able to organize into a permanent school-working body 
to meet annually hereafter, or oftener if deemed necessary. 
This thought originated in our summer Institutes for teachers, 
which have been a great success in this county. Our Institutes - 
have done more to arouse the teachers to a sense of their duty 
than any thing else. They have come to stay and to continue 
to do good in behalf of the rising generation of our county. 
These Institutes were more than a success, 120 being enrolled 
at the white, a good increase over last year, and more than five 
times as many as attended our first, three years ago, which was 
the first in the county. 
At the colored ninety were enrolled, an increase above last 
year of twenty teachers. Many of the teachers out of our 
county attended these Institutes as visitors and well-wishers. - 
We also had quite a good attendance of interested citizens 
throughout the Institute. We are building up in all the causes 
of education. We have more good schools than ever before. 
In the place of old Union Hill we now have a high-school of 
115 pupils, taught by John E. Dunn as principal. 
We also have some of the best schools of the State in our 
county, viz.: Eagleville High-school, Hermitage. High-school, 
Fosterville High-schoo!, Rutherford College, Cedar Hill High- 
school, Oakland High-school, Porterfield High-school, Milton 
Seminary, Rucker Seminary, Lascassas Seminary, Walter Hill 
High-school, Stewart's Creek Seminary, Seventh District Cen- 
tral High-school, Salem Seminary, King’s Wood High-school, 
Eleventh District Central High-school, Rockvale High-school, 
Murfreesboro High-school for Boys, Murfreesboro Seminary 
for Girls (taught by Miss Anna McKanden), and Soule College, 
under the management of the venerable Dr. Z. C. Graves, 
which is one of the best schools for young ladies in the South. 
These schools all confer high degrees, such as M.E.L., M.A., 
B.P., B.S., and B.A. 
All of which is respectfully submitted, 
Jas. D. Neuson, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Drax Sir—I have the honor to transmit herewith my annual 
report of the public schools of Scott County for the year ending 
June 380, 1890. 
Thé schools of Scott County are making fair progress in 
every respect. I note with pleasure the patrons and school- 
officers manifest considerable interest in the work. A demand 
for efficient teachers comes from every district, which is proof 
that our people will be taught no longer by the old methods. 
I held one County Normal for the white teachers, It was 
conducted by Professor Will A. Cate, of Maryville, Tenn. 
There was a large attendance of both teachers and visitors the 
whole term, which was two weeks. ‘The work done by Profes- 
sor Cate is testimony of his. being one of the best Normal in- 
structors of the State. I desire to thank Superintendent Ford, 
of Knox County, for his assistance in securing the services of 
such an educational worker. Much valuable service was ren- 
dered in the way of addresses and lectures to the teachers by 
Rev. D. A. Clemens, of Lane Seminary; Hon. J. F. Baker, of 
Huntsville; Prof. C. W. Murphy, of Acadia, Ind., and M. L. 
McDonald, of Huntsville—each topic pertaining to the work 
of education. The County Court being in session, by special 
invitation that body, with a good number of Directors, visited 
the Normal, and reported as being favorably impressed with 
the proceedings. 
The Scott County Teachers’ Association, which meets 
monthly, is doing considerable toward the advancement of ed- 
ucation. The work consists in discussing the best methods of 
teaching. So far, they have given general satisfaction. Be- 
sides the public schools, we have Huntsville Academy, with 
Prof. M. M. Rankin principal and two other efficient teachers 
as assistants. This school is kept open nine months in the 
year; also, the Helenwood Private School, established by Miss 
u
-P-A-G-E-167
—162 — 
Anna Ryall, of Cincinnati. Miss Ryall is an experienced” 
teacher, and her school, though young, presents bright pros- 
pects for the future. 
I have used every effort possible to advance the schools of 
Scott County since I was inducted into the office of County 
Superintendent, and while I do not claim a complete success, I 
feel that the schools are in a condition to do better work in the 
future. Respectfully, 
J.J. Newport, 
Superintendent. 
SequatcHig County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—I herewith submit té you my annual report for 
Sequatchie County for the fiscal year ending June 80, 1890. 
The schools of Sequatchie County have been very well at- 
tended during the year. What we most need is better Directors 
and better. County Courts, or at least more active courts in the 
cause of education. It is almost impossible for County Super- 
intendents to arouse such an interest as the public welfare 
demands without they have more assistance from magistrates, 
Directors, and patrons, all of whom are, or should be, inter- 
ested in educating the youths of America. The visit to our 
county by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction gave 
considerable life and vim to our people in the way of education. 
I hope he may come again, and arouse still more vim and en- 
ergy than before. 
I have been trying to serve my people in our little county 
for the past twelve years, and still I hear the same old cry as at. 
first, that “we do not need a County Superintendent.” Yet they 
are compelled to have him, and want him to do a vast amount 
of work for almost nothing. When a man gives his time, I
-P-A-G-E-168
— 163 — 
think he ought to be fed, if nothing else, whileat work. I have 
spent a great deal of time and money for my county in the past 
twelve years, and have got all the schools in good condition; 
still there is room for improvement. _&

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—I have the pleasure of transmitting to you my 
second atnual report of the schools of Sevier County for the 
scholastic year ending June 30, 1890. . 
It affords me great pleasure to say that we are progressing in 
almost every respect. Although we have not yet accomplished 
all that should be done, still we have been awake and moving 
toward the desired end. 
My statistical report shows an increased population, a larger 
enrollment and daily attendance, and better pay to teachers than 
any previous year in the history of Sevier County schools. In 
July I held a Normal Institute at Middle Creek Academy, of 
which Prof. J. W. P. Massey was principal, assisted by Profs. W- 
8. Bryan, D. G. Eruest, and others, which was a decided success. 
It was well attended, there being about seventy-five teachers 
enrolled, and plenty of spectators all the time: A great deal of 
interest was manifested and much good done. Our monthly 
teachers’ meetings have been well attended by the teachers, 
patrons, and pupils, and I am sure much good has been done in 
molding the public mind in favor of a more thorough and 
higher education. 
Since the date of my last report we have built several good 
frame school-houses, and supplied them with wall-maps, black- 
boards, charts, ete. Also, I am proud to say that we have in
-P-A-G-E-169
— 164 — 
course of construction a splendid institution of learning at 
Sevierville, by the name of Murphy College—a splendid brick 
edifice; when completed will be an ornament to the town anda 
prideto the people of the county.. 
We have a uniformity of text-books for the public schools of 
Sevier County, and the schools, with jew exceptions, have con- 
formed to the adopted series. Also a prescribed course of study 
was prepared by which the schools are to be graded, and sent 
to the Directors and teachers. A great many of the schools 
are successfully graded, and the other teachers are slowly but 
steadily falling in line with the course of study, and in the near 
future we hope to report favorable results. I visited nearly all 
the schools of the county. In these visits, after having wit- 
nessed the method of instruction and the government of the 
teachers, I have generally taken charge of the schools, exam- 
ined such classes as I saw fit, and by this means I have obtained 
a knowledge of the fitness, theory, and practice of the teacher. 
I have made about seventy-two such visits, and generally, before 
leaving, have addressed the schvo! in such a way as to give en- 
couragement. 
Among the most encouraging signs of progress and an edu- 
cational interest on the part of the teachers and the people 
generally, is the fact that during last spring we had fourteen 
private and high-schools in Sevier County well attended, enroll- 
ing nine hundred and thirty-seven students, and a daily attend- 
ance of seven hundred and twelve—nearly twice as many stu- 
dents enrolled as any one previous year in the history of Sevier 
County schools. 
By a close examination of my statistical report, you will be 
able to see what advancement we have made in the educational 
work of the public schools of Sevier County.

W.S. Oguz, 
Superintendent.

Duar Srr—Inclosed you will find my scholastic’ report for 
Shelby County for the year ending June 30, 1890. Ihave made 
every effort to give you a complete report, and I feel satisfied 
that this is as. accurate as it could be made. I have visited 
nearly every school in the county, and I am gratified to note 
their rapid improvement. With but few exceptions our schools 
are well graded, the buildings are comfortable, and the rooms 
well furnished and supplied with the necessary school-apparatus. 
The school-term has been lengthened and the salaries of the 
teachers increased. The attendance was far in excess of that of 
any previous year. 
A State Normal Institute was held for the colored teachers 
during the first week of June. Professor Traver, assisted by 
Mrs. Traver, did active and efficient work for the State, and 
contributed much toward making the Normal a success. The 
enrollment was the largest on record. Two hundred and sixty 
applicants presented themselves for examination, and although 
a number failed to merit certificates, and complained loudly 
that the examination was too rigid, I do not hesitate to say 
that the State Normal was asuccess. The examinations for white 
teachers were well attended and the result was very satisfactory. 
We still have our regular monthly meetings, and my office 
has long since grown too small to accommodate those who at- 
tend. We have a very nice little library for our teachers, and 
although we have but few books at present, we hope to add 
many more to the list within the next few weeks. 
Yours respectfully,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—I herewith forward you my second annual report 
of the schools of Smith County. They are steadily improving,
-P-A-G-E-171
— 166 — 
as may be learned by a comparison of the statistical part of 
this report with my report of last year. There is a marked in- 
crease in the scholastic population, in the enrollment, and in 
the average daily attendance, and also in the expenditures for 
repairing buildings, purchasing apparatus, etc. 
About half the schools have been supplied with music charts 
during the year, and it will not be long until vocal music will 
be as successfully taught as any branch of the public school 
curriculum. 
Our Teachers’ Institute held in June, which was honored 
with the presence of yourself, Doctor Kellogg, and Professor 
Mynders, we regard a complete success. The Institute is a 
permanent establishment in this county, and will be held as 
regularly as the years come. 
Our Teachers’ Association meets monthly, and is better at- 
tended than ever before. The good it has accomplished can 
hardly be estimated. No county should be without a well- 
conducted Teachers’ Association: 
The adoption of a uniform system of text-books has been a 
complete success. Everybody realizes its advantages, and are 
determined to continue it. How can a county’s school-system 
be a success without it? 
We have not yet succeeded in grading the schools, but the 
idea is growing in favor, and they will be graded within a short 
time. Respectfully,

Superintendent,

Duan Stn—I have the honor herewith to transmit my report 
for the year ending June 30, 1890. JI am very much gratified
-P-A-G-E-172
— 167 — 
to report that our schools are in a more prosperous condition 
than ever before in the history of Sullivan County, and year by 
year are growing in favor with our people. About one thou- 
sand more children were enrolled in the schools last year than 
during the previous year. Our County Court, in its wisdom, 
has increased the school-tax, and instead of reporting a term of 
eighty-three days, as in our last report, we can boast of an 
average term of 109 days in this report. 
The improvement in school-building has had a rapid growth 
in this county. The majority of the sub-districts now have a 
good, comfortable school-building, and the demand for first- 
class teachers increases year by year. Our teachers, as a general 
rule, are endeavoring to prepare themselves for their work. The 
Institutes the past year were well attended. I held a County 
Normal of ten days during the latter part of July. We had 
sixty-five teachers in attendance. Profs. J. W. Repass and W. 
A. Evans, who assisted me, did some noble work, and the 
teachers attending felt that they had received a feast of good 
things; but I must say that we have still some drawbacks. I 
have tried very hard during my term of office to get the Direct- 
ors all together, for the purpose of organizing them into a 
Board of Education for the county, but so far I have failed, 
and I presume I will until some provision is made in the law to 
compensate them for their time. I believe the school-law 
should be so amended as to allow Directors one dollar per day 
for their services when called together by the County Superin- 
tendent. I think by another year we can have our schools well 
graded, as steps have been taken in this direction. 
Respectfully,

Dear Str—I have the honor to submit herewith, for. the 
fourth time, my report of the schools (both public and private) . 
of Tipton County for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1890.
-P-A-G-E-173
— 168 — 
My report has been delayed much longer than it should have 
been, and much longer than I intended it should be, owing 
solely, however, to the fact that I found it impossible to secure 
statistical reports from the clerks of the various districts through- 
out the county until a few days ago. 
My report of the total scholastic population of the county 
shows a falling off of more than three hundred from that as 
shown by my report of last year. This is due, probably, solely 
to the fact that I have succeeded this year in securing a more 
thorough and accurate report of the scholastic population than 
ever before during my administration as County Superintend- 
ent. I take pleasure, however, in noting the fact that the 
grades of the teachers. of the county have advanced very ma- 
terially, and that there has been much improvement in the 
school-buildings and in the furuiture and fixtures of same dur- 
ing the past few years. 
The Tipton County Summer Normal, held for two weeks 
each year during the month of June, by virtue of an appro- 
priation of the County Court made for that purpose, has proven 
a most popular and beneficial feature of the educational work 
of our county, and our teachers are justly proud of having 
been the first to inaugurate the system of summer Normals 
held by the respective counties of the State, under the direct 
supervision of the teachers, respectively, of the counties that 
hold them. 
There seems nothing, at present, that promises to discourage 
the advancement of the public schools in this county, further 
than that there is a growing disposition on the part of the 
white people of the county, who pay ninety-five one-hundredths 
of the taxes, to discontinue the public education of the “ brother 
in black,” who, notwithstanding the fact that he pays less than 
five one-hundredths of the taxes ‘of our county, receives more 
than fifty per cent. of the public school-moneys. This, the 
white people argue, is wrong, and should be remedied; and I 
heartily agree with them, and join them, also, in the further
-P-A-G-E-174
— 169 — 
opinion that the negro should bear the burden of his own 
education. I remain, yours respectfully, 
8. A. Monreomury, 
Superintendent. 
TROUSDALE CouNrTY. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—I herewith submit my annual report of the schools 
of Trousdale County. I am glad to be able to state that our 
schools have been such as to give satisfaction—better and more 
interest manifested thau heretofore. The schools have run 
about four months, and-I think that in future we will be able 
to continue longer. Respectfully, 
Joun B. Cog.ey, 
Superintendent. 
Wasuineton County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Publie Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—I have the honor to submit to you herewith my 
second annual report of the schools of Washington County. 
Our schools are progressing nicely. A great number of our 
teachers during the past year did good work. Nearly all of our 
schools were graded. There would be no trouble about grading 
our schools if we could keep the same teachers three or four 
years. Our system of gradation is workiug admirably. It 
has a great tendency to make pupils attend school better, and 
also creates an interest among the patrons of the schools. The 
school-population of this county has increased during the past 
year four hundred and one. The enrollment over last year is 
four hundred. The average daily attendance over last year is 
considerably over one thousand. There seems to be more in-
-P-A-G-E-175
— 170 — 
terest manifested among the people generally in regard to our 
public schools than ever before. The Directors are doing more 
than usual to make our schools a success. The Directors really 
have more power to do good than they have been thinking. 
They certainly have a great deal to do in making our Normal 
Schools a success. Six Institutes were held last fall and winter 
to accommodate the teachers all over the county. The attend- 
ance, both by teachers and patrons, was good. Our local Insti- 
tutes are doing a great deal to arouse our teachers, Directors, 
and patrons. You reach the patrons better in an Institute than 
any other way. The school-population of Johnson City has 
increased during the past year four hundred. 
After this year the “ Queen City of the South” will have good 
buildings to accommodate her school-population. During the 
month of August she voted bonds to the amount ‘of twenty-five 
thousand dollars to build school-houses. The colored schools 
did better work last year than ever before from the fact they 
continued longer. The great drawback to our public schools 
is the lack of money. We ought to have seven months instead 
of five. The great wealth of our county is being developed, 
which will give us more money. So we may and must expect 
better schools. Success to you in your grand and noble work! 
Respectfully yours, 
¥F. T. Warts, 
Superintendent. 
Wayne County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to transmit to you my annual 
report of the public schools of my county for the scholastic 
year ending June 30, 1890. My report is nearly correct. In 
some few cases, where Directors have failed to report, I have 
had to approximate, but such cases are few indeed. I can say 
with great pride and pleasure that the educational work in
-P-A-G-E-176
—171 — 
Wayne County ison a boom. Our teachers are taking a greater 
interest than any year before, and they deserve much credit for 
the interest and energy they have displayed in their school- 
work. A goodly number of the young men and women of the 
county, realizing the importance of good schools, have gone to 
work with an earnestness never before manifested in our 
county, to qualify themselves properly for school-work, and in 
a short time—a few years at most—we will have as good schools 
as any other county in the State. 
I find that our Teachers’ Institutes have aroused public senti- 
ment on the subject of popular education. We have about four 
of these meetings every year. I have visited nearly all the 
schools in the county. I found nearly all doing exceedingly 
well. The Directors are taking more interest than heretofore. 
I have done all in my power to advance the school-interests of 
my county, and I feel that my labors have not been in vain; but 
my efforts have been crowned with reasonable success. In every 
department of our school-work we are pleased to note a sure 
and steady progress. The future prospects are bright for the 
children of Wayne County. We are having longer school- 
terms this year than common in nearly all the school-districts 
in the county. Our colored schools are progressing very well, 
too. We have some very good teachers among the colored 
population of our county. They are creating quite an enthusi- 
asm among their race of people for education. We are very 
proud to make this report. Respectfully, 
J. N. Sims, | 
Superintendent. 
Wraktey County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—Inclosed please find my second: annual report for 
the year ending June 30, 1890. The report from the Trustee 
is still incomplete, owing somewhat to the carelessness of Di- 
rectors, they failing to always itemize their warrants:
-P-A-G-E-177
—172— 
Our schools are improving. 
A majority of the Directors have adopted a uniform series of 
text-books, and a system of gradation similar to the one pre- 
sented the convention last: December. 
A few teachers made an effort last year to grade their schools, 
and others promise to do all they can in that direction this 
year. © 
We have held, during the greater part of the year, our 
monthly teachers’ meetings, and they are usually well attended. 
I need not speak of the benefit of these meetings, every teacher 
realizing their importance. 
Our annual Normal was held in June by Mr, 8. A. Mynders. 
Our teachers fully indorsed his instructions and highly appre-. 
ciated his efforts in making our Normal a success. I would 
favor some compulsion to force attendance in our annual meet- 
ings. Our best teachers are demanding such a measure. 
The colored teachers have organized an Institute. They ap- 
pear very grateful for our efforts to assist them. Hoping our 
efforts may be crowned with success, 
I am respectfully, 
Mrs. L. T. Evans, 
Superintendent. 
Waitt County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear S1r—Inclosed please find my fourth annual report of 
the public schools -of White County. In making this report I 
do not wish to make the impression that the schools of White 
County have reached a state of perfection, because such is not 
the case. I am proud, however, to be able to say that we are 
.
-P-A-G-E-178
— 173 — 
. . 
making steady and solid progress. Our progress is no-mush- 
room growth, but has come to stay, and consists in the improve- 
ment of school-property, the building of new and better school- 
houses, the healthy and growing condition of Normal Insti- 
tutes and teachers’ monthly Institutes, the more thorough 
preparation of the teachers for their work, the increase of our 
school-fund, longer school-terms, better salaries to teachers, 
larger enrollments, better attendance, increased interest mani- 
fested by our County Court, School-directors, and patrons gen- : 
erally. During the last four years White County has built 
twenty-two (22) new, neat, and substantial school-buildings, and 
repaired and greatly improved most of the older ones; she has 
raised her school-tax from 20 cents to 85 cents on the hundred 
dollars’ worth of property, and her poll-tax for school-purposes 
from $1 to $1.50; she has increased the average salary of teach- 
ers from $21.85 to $31.25; she has extended her school-term 
from seventy (70) to ninety-two (92) days; she has greatly im- 
proved her teachers by holding State Normal Institutes and 
monthly teachers’ Institutes; she has much more and better 
school-furniture, and mauy other improvements, which I will 
not take time to mention. You will see from my statistical re- 
port that White County has a scholastic population of 5,212, 
an enrollment of 8,919, an average daily attendance of 3,412, 
with 70 schools, 60 white and 10 colored. 
I have held, during the entire year, our monthly teachers’ 
Institutes. More interest has been manifested in these Insti- 
tutes by all concerned than ever before. These Institutes have 
done a vast deal of good for the cause of education in this 
‘county, in ifaproving the teachers and calling the attention of 
Directors and the people generally to the work. 
We held a summer Normal Institute at Doyle College, in this 
county, beginning June 30, and continuing two weeks, includ- 
ing Saturdays. The Normal was well attended, being con- 
ducted entirely by our county teachers. We had one hundred 
and eight teachers in attendance, mostly from this county, but 
some from adjoining counties. A written examination of ap- 
plicants for certificates was held during the last two days, which 
revealed a marked improvement on the part of our teachers 
during the last year. Most of our teachers now are young, en- 
thusiastie, and wide awake. The “old moss-back” has about
-P-A-G-E-179
—174— 
retired from our ranks, the average age of those in attendance 
at the summer Normal this year being 22 years and 8 months. 
Our teachers are much better qualified now than they were four 
years ago. This is due partly to our State Normals, summer 
and monthly Institutes, and partly to our excellent private 
schools, which run ten months in the year. ‘ 
Our Directors are taking more interest in their work than 
formerly, especially in building, repairing, and furnishing 
- school-houses, and employing a better grade of teachers. They 
also seem more willing to visit the schools; and generally, when 
I go into a district to visit the schools, one or more of them will 
go around with me. I have visited all the schools in the county 
this year except three or four, which were stopped for “ fodder” 
or protracted meetings. I found most of the schools doing 
good work, many of them much better than ever before. I 
found generally more system and order, better classification, 
more improved methods of instruction, and more life and en- 
ergy manifested in various ways. 
Our greatest drawbacks now in the way of success are a want 
of money and irregular attendance. I sincerely hope that our 
next Legislature will make our public school-system a State 
instead of a county system, und give us a chance to take a stand 
among the foremost States in the Union in point of education, 
a position which the grand old “Volunteer State” so richly 
deserves, but which I think it extremely doubtful whether she 
can ever occupy under the present county system. 
We also need a county high-school, run by the public fund, 
established in each couaty for the higher education of our boys 
and girls, and preparing students to enter the Tniversity of 
Tennessee. 
Our public schools should run at least six months in the 
year, instead of four months, as they now run on an average. 
The only hope for the education of the masses is in our public 
schools, and this cannot be done with a school of four months 
in the year. 
We have several good private schools in White County, which 
run ten months in the year, and are accomplishing much good, 
being well attended generally. Doyle College, Dibrell Normal 
Institute, Andrew Jackson College, Onward Seminary, Ander-
-P-A-G-E-180
— 175 — 
son Seminary, Walnut Grove, Oak Grove, and Old Zion High- 
school, and others, are in successful operation. 
I gave talks of from twenty to forty minutes at almost every 
school I visited. The children, generally, gave me their undi- 
vided attention, and seemed to be highly interested. I have 
enjoyed the hearty co-operation of teachers, Directors, County 
Court, and the people generally during my four years in office, 
for which they have my sincere thanks. Our people were never 
more deeply interested in schools than now, and although our 
schools are not yet such as we wish to make them, still we are 
making progress in the right direction, and are hopeful that, 
by wise legislation and proper administration, we will yet be 
able to reach the much-desired goal. Wishing you much suc- 
cess in your noble work, I am, most respectfully, 
Your obedient servant, 
W. N. Buurestey, 
Superintendent. 
Witiiamson County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—Some weeks since I had the honor to forward to 
you my fourth annual report for Williamson County. I have 
spent considerable time on the report, and believe that it is 
more correct than any previous report has been. 
The pro rata fell short fifteen cents on each child in the 
county this last scholastic year, and thereby reduced our aver- 
age session two days; also some debts have been incurred 
which must be paid out of the money of present year. This 
ean be done, however, without any material damage to our 
schools. 
There has been quite a marked improvement in our schools 
this year in the way of furniture, fixtures, etc., which have 
been greatly needed. Quite a number of our schools are still 
in need of these improvements, but we are not yet able to sup- 
ply all without taking too much of the money from the teach- 
ers, and thereby materially affecting our average session. 
Four nice, roomy, and comfortable houses have been built by 
the public, school-money since our last report in as many dif-
-P-A-G-E-181
— 176 — 
ferent districts, and the very best furniture and fixtures placed 
in them. These take the places of old, dilapidated ones, and 
supply a long-felt want. : 
The Institute work of my county has been about as last 
year. I held two annual Institutes this year, as I have for the 
last four years, with about the usual success. I find that it is 
hard to induce our teachers to remain in the county and assist 
in the annual teachers’ meeting during vacation, many of them 
preferring to go where the assistance of State is given; hence, 
the attendance is not so good as desired. The colored Insti- 
tute is attended by every colored teacher in the county, and is, 
indeed, in a healthy condition. 
By reference to our last report, it will be seen that there were 
more children in school last year than have ever been enrolled 
before; and it gives me pleasure to say that not only the en- 
rollment, but the average uttendance, is now quite respectable. 
We have only a few boys here who evince any desire to at- 
tend the University of Tennessee, at Knoxville; and, as these 
can, and do, receive appointments without examination by the 
County Superintendent, they present themselves there as often 
without as with it. I fear the school is not fully understood, 
and I know it is not appreciated as it should be. 
I believe that the law changing the time of electing School- 
directors is calculated to do great good by breaking up family 
rule, rings, ete. 
Allow me to say in this my fourth, and may be last, report 
that there is no cause for discouragement in the progress of our 
county; and while our schools are far, very far, from being 
what I and every true friend desires, still there has been a 
marked improvement in every department of our work for the 
last year, and much cause for encouragement. 
Please permit me, ere I close, to offer to you my sincere 
thanks for the many courtesies and kindnesses extended. In 
my humble opinion, there have been many agencies put in oper- 
ation during your term of office that will result in much sub- 
stantial benefit to the public schools of Tennessee for years to 
come, and, as a co-laborer in this work, I wish you godspeed. 
Most respectfully, ° 
Rosert 8. Batiow, 
Superintendent.

10 PROCEEDINGS OF THE - 
  
PROCEEDINGS 
OF THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOL OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION 
OF TENNESSEE. 
KNOXVILLE, DECEMBER 9-12, 1890. 
TUESDAY, DEO. 9—MORNING SESSION. 
The Association was called to order at 10:15 a.m., in the « 
University Agricultural Hall, by the President, J. H. Allen, of 
Bedford County. 
The following prayer was offered by Rev. James Park: 
“Almighty God, our heavenly Father, we thank thee that 
once more in thy good providence these, thy servants, are per- 
mitted to meet in the capacity in which they are here assembled. 
We bless and praise thy holy name for the kind care which has 
preserved from accident and harm by the way those who have 
journeyed hither from other and distant places. Continue thy 
kind providence over them while they tarry in our midst. Let 
thy blessing be upon this convention while they are transacting 
the business that is before them. Indue them with the spirit 
of wisdom and a sound mind. Guide them in all their delib- 
erations and lead them to such conclusions as thou wilt own © 
‘and bless: O thou who art the uncreated and eternal light,
-P-A-G-E-192
ConvENTIoN oF Pusiic Scuoon OFFICERS. 11 
fountain of knowledge, and source of all wisdom, we thank 
thee that thou hast not left thyself without witness among us; 
but that in thy word and works before us, and in our souls and 
consciences within us, and in all thy living creatures about us, 
we have the evidence of thy presence, the manifestation of thy 
power, the indications of thy wisdom, and the tokens of thy 
goodness. We acknowledge thy favor in all the benefits of 
life; in our personal, domestic, social, civil, educational and 
religious privileges, advantages, and enjoyments. We are in- 
debted unto thee, the giver of every good and perfect gift, for 
all our institutions of learning, of every grade, from the highest © 
to the lowest. We pray thy blessing upon them all, and that 
their efficiency and usefulness may continually increase. We 
thank thee, O God, for the high and noble vocation of teaching. 
Let all the teachers in our land, by diligent use of their oppor- 
tunities, patient study, and assiduous application to acquire 
useful knowledge, become workmen that need not be ashamed 
—‘skillful in all wisdom, cunning in knowledge, and under- 
standing science.’ And as they grow in the knowledge of this 
world, and comprehend better the constitution of nature and 
the forces, which, by the ordination of infinite wisdom, operate 
in,it, may they reverence thee more, and seek thy favor in all 
things. And give them, also, understanding in the way of god- 
liness and a spiritual discernment of the things which are 
eternal. Give them the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the 
knowledge of Jesus Christ, whom to know aright is life eternal: 
Command thy blessing upon all their labors and endeavors in 
their calling, and make them successful to promote the tem- 
poral and eternal good of the young and rising generation of 
our land; that our sons may as plants grow up in their youth; 
that our daughters may be as corner-stones polished after the 
similitude of a palace, to the praise of the glory of thy grace 
in Jesus Christ forever. Amen. 
The President then introduced Rev. Carter Helm Jones, 
pastor of the First Baptist Church of Khoxville, who delivered 
the address of welcome. He said: 
“Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“T am somewhat at a loss to know who and what I represent 
this morning. Dr. Dabney or the printer’s devil, one or both,
-P-A-G-E-193

left that off of the programme. His Honor, Mayor Kern, will 
represent Knoxville, and the faculty has already given you a 
hospitable and hearty welcome to the University. I suppose I 
will just have to welcome you on my own account, which I 
shall do most heartily and most earnestly. If the scholars in 
Tennessee are like those I used to know in Old Virginia and 
the country round about, I have no doubt that they have ,al- 
ready visited you, and therefore it becomes needful that you 
should be weleomed as coming from among us. 
“Knoxville, a few months ago, opened’ wide its gates and 
welcomed into its borders the veteran representatives of two 
mighty armies that formerly contended for the mastery of this 
land. Ideas are mightier than armies, and if the veteran soldiers 
and officers were welcomed here, it seems to me that they whose 
duty it is to discipline, marshal, inspire, and lead the ideas, are 
worthy of a more lasting respect than the drill-masters or the 
officers of armies can gain upon the field of battle. 
“T love that old word ‘welcome.’ I emphasize it to-day in 
its two-fold meaning. You are welcome, you are wel-come! I 
believe in you. I welcome you because you are teachers, 
because I look in the faces of earnest men and women—and [love 
that term far better than ‘gentlemen,’ far better than ‘ladigs.’ 
I look in the faces of earnest men and women whose duty it is 
to develope the God-given powers of the youth of this land. 
You are standing, some of ‘you, by the head- waters that are to 
‘become mighty in their after course; some of you by the plastic 
material (and sometimes it is tiresome, isn’t it?), and others are 
standing by the huge unquarried or crudely quarried masses, 
with chisel and mallet in hand, trying to carve out the imprisoned 
giant within. 
“Many great men have stood uncovered in the presence of a 
number of boys because of the mighty potentialities that were 
locked up in their lives, and I would stand uncovered in my 
very soul before you to-day, because you are teachers. You are 
educators, therefore you are the leaders forth of these mighty 
influences which are to sway the mind. God bless you! The 
Lord make you welcome to-day! you mental tacticians, who are 
drilling to- -day forces who shall afterward do battle for right 
or for wrong in this land of ours. “You are wel-come, and, not

only that, you are come well. His Honor, the Mayor, will tell 
you that Knoxville is a good place to come to. I do not know 
how much you know about it. I do not know how many of us 
feel it, but I feel about Knoxville as Dr. Dabney would some- 
times say at home, perhaps, that it is just about as good a place 
as there is in this country. I remember there was an old 
preacher in blue-grass Kentucky, who was preaching a sermon 
once, and he lost every adjective as he began to describe heaven. 
At last, bankrupt of superlatives and impoverished in descript- 
ives, he paused for a moment, and then said: ‘I will tell you, 
brethren, it is a very blue-grass Kentucky of a place.’ I do not 
know about that, but I know that Knoxville is just about as 
near heaven as some of us are ever going to get; that is, if we 
ever get there. Knoxville is a good place, but I have no right 
to welcome you to Knoxville. I welcome you to this University. 
You know how it sits upon a hill here and keeps the city down 
below you. It looks over the lighted city like the grim old 
scholar that Carlyle tells us about in Sartor Resartus. I won’t 
name him; you may know such a man before you leave here. 
“You may go all through this faculty, and you have to search 
far to find nobler men, whether it is the noble professor who is 
acquainted with Greek and roots that the professor of agri- 
culture and the boys on the farm have not yet dug up; ‘or 
whether you come to the learned man who presides over the 
chemical department, who can summon out the spirits from the 
vast deep, and make the light to divulge what the darkness has 
sepulchred ; or whether it is the versatile, graceful, and wonder- 
ful professor of modern languages, who can sleep in three lan- 
guages aud smoke in two more, and then go back and talk East 
‘Fennessee whenever it is necessary. I care not where you go, 
you cannot find better men than here. I want you to know 
them. Dr. Park said in his prayer that it was his desire also 
that ycu come together and that you may know each other bet- 
ter. I remember a simple, humble incident that an old teacher 
of mine told me, coming from Culpepper County, Virginia.’ 
In the old days, before the railroads made their inroads upon 
the country, there was a team of horses that used to draw a” 
wagon from farm to farm, store to station, and such matters, 
that had grown old in the service. Old Sam, the driver, had
-P-A-G-E-195
14 PRocEEDINGS OF THE 
  
plied his whip until they took very kindly to it, and still faith- 
fully they drew along ;\and that farm seemed dependent upon 
these two old horses, who pulled, worked, stalled, and stopped 
together. One morning old Dobbin lay down and died, and 
they took him and dragged him away. The next day Sam came 
jn trouble to his master and said: ‘Jim’s gone, and we can’t find 
him anywhere. Old Jim, who had never strayed, was gone. 
That evening late Sam came back and said: ‘I have found old 
Jim, just bending over old Dobbin.’ He said, as the tears came 
in his eyes, ‘These two old horses had learn to love each other, 
because they had-worked in the same thing so long together.’ 
If dumb brutes, uninspired with reasoning power, can learn to 
love each other, what can it be for men and women engaged in 
the noblest calling to come together. 
“God grant that the prayer so earnestly delivered by one of 
Knoxville’s eloquent preachers shall be an inspiration; that tt 
shall bring blessings upon this meeting, and that we shall re- 
member that ‘the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.’ ’” 
t 
Mayor Kern then delivered the following address : 
“Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“Tt has been said that ‘a Dutchman must have two chances to- 
speak once.’ I confess I am not an exception to this rule. 
Next to my ability to make bread, cakes, and candy, comes my 
inability to make speeches. I desire, however, to assure you 
gentlemen who have the training of the intellect in hand, that 
I am in hearty sympathy with your work, and bid you God- 
speed. I recognize the fact that ‘the wealth of the mind is the 
only true wealth;’ and you who are charged with the duty of 
assisting the young to acquire this much-coveted treasure, de- 
serve and should receive the support and encouragement of all. 
As the representative of the city of Knoxville, I greet you with 
‘a hearty welcome, and extend to you the freedom of our city. 
I regret the fact that my Maker failed to endow me with the. 
accomplishment of being an entertaining talker. I have good 
reason to congratule myself. on account of being favored with 
an. opportunity to meet you. Thanking you for the opportu-
-P-A-G-E-196
Convention oF Pusitic Scuoot OFFICERS. 15 
  
nity of exhibiting my non-speaking qualities, I again greet you 
with a hearty welcome.” 
‘When the applause that greeted the mayor’s speech had sub- 
sided, Miss Mollie Pierce, Superintendent of the Dyer County 
schools, delivered the following graceful response to the ad- 
dresses of welcome: 
“For some reason unknown to me, unless it be that through 
the weakness of the speaker the excellency of the cause might 
appear, I have been called upon to respond to your very warm 
words of welcome. No sweeter word ever fell upon the ear of 
a visitor at palace or cabin ‘door than welcome. A more pre- 
cious return cannot be made than a sincere, heartfelt I thank 
you. Yours has been music to our ears, and we do thrice thank 
you. Weare profoundly grateful because, while your welcome 
includes us as individuals, we look upor it as extending beyond 
us to the merit of that cause which is dearer to us than self— 
public education. We congratulate ourselves upon being the 
guests of Knoxville, and we congratulate Knoxville upon being 
the host of public educators. 
“The many excellencies of your city, beautiful for situation 
and marvelous for its growth, have been elements of delight in 
our anticipations of this convention. Among all the mountains 
of this famous eastern valley it seems God built a grand throne 
and set Knoxville upon it, and crowned her the queen of the 
east. He surrounded her with fertile valleys for cotton and 
bread-stuffs and pastures, rich mines of coal and iron, and 
quarries of marble, and timber, and spread upon every hand 
scenery to rest the weary eye and make glad the despondent ° 
heart. 
“You have, especially in the last decade, improved these ad- 
vantages. That industry, thrift, and enterprise which have 
wrought so marvelously with you are not born of ignorance, 
but are begotten and fostered by enlightenment; hence, your 
rapid strides indicate more than material growth, and become 
peculiarly interesting tous. Your foundries and manufactories ; 
your car-wheels whizzing through many States, and your cars

bearing the products of many climates; your competing lines of 
railroads to every quadrant; your magnificent public buildings; 
your great wholesale business, aggregating its $20,000,000; your 
splendid streets and lines of street railway; the taste displayed 
in the architecture of your superb residences; your public 
schools and other institutions of learning; your benevolent in- 
stitutions, enabling the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak; the 
high tone of your press and its friendly aid to our cause; your 
beautiful temples of worship; your reputation for hospitality 
and homes of refinement; your generous words, sir, in bidding 
us welcome to these happy homes, and yours, sir, opening the 
gates of this proud city of the mountains, and thereby placing 
us at once in communication with the world—all, all these, 
inspire us, and confirm us in the belief that all great enter- 
prises, and discoveries, and inventions will, erelong, be sub- 
ordinate and pay tribute to their mother—education. With 
heaven as a canopy above, and all these object-lessons about us, 
furnishing an objective illustration of every work in the mind 
—a splendid kindergarten temple—we can make our stay 
among you the most pleasant and profitable, and gain incentives 
to higher and nobler efforts in the future. 
“I will not trespass upon your time and patience to speak of 
the origin and progress of our great work in this great State. 
The State of Tennessee has a right to good citizenship. To 
this extent she is at least concerned: There can be no good 
citizenship without at least that education which she gives in 
her public schvols. ‘We must educate or we must perish’ is a 
truth that has brightened with the flight of years since it fell 
from the lips of its illustrious author. The truth lived before 
him. Our aim is to hasten the day when illiteracy will be un- 
known in our State; when a school-house will be in easy access of 
every child, and all the girls and boys in the State in school. 
We rejoice with you and all the State of Tennessee, and con- 
gratulate our State Superintendent and Governor Taylor’s edu- 
cational: administration, upon the good work accomplished 
among the girls and boys of our native State. The old-time 
opposition to free education has passed away with the mists 
that enshrouded it, and to-day the pulpit, the press, and all 
_agencies for good are warmly. indorsing the free education of 
the masses. Again, sir, we heartily say thank you.”

The next on the programme was the roll-call of the counties, 
but before this was done President J. H. Allen spoke as fol- 
lows: 
“Before we begin, I wish to say that Miss Bessie Moore, Su- 
perintendent of Hardin County, sends greeting and Godspeed 
to the Association. She will not be with us, because of the 
serious illness of her mother, and asks that Mr. Henry Walker, 
of that county, be allowed to represent Hardin County in the 
Association.” 
This was agreed to. 
Then the following representatives of the counties indicated 
responded in brief talks, not exceeding in length three minutes 
each: 
E. L. Foster, Superintendent of Anderson: 
“Tam glad that I am permitted to be present on this occa- 
sion; I am glad that I represent Anderson County; and I am 
glad that I can report progress. ‘This has been the most success- 
ful year in the history of the free schools of the county. Our 
County Court has been more liberal than ever before. We have 
more money, our school-term is longer, and we have a better 
grade of teachers than ever before. Our School-directors are 
more faithful, and the people show a livelier interest for educa- 
tion. Now, the work of supervision has not been different 
from what I reported last year, We have methods of grading 
the schools, and, in connection with our educational column in 
the county paper, we have a column in. which the names of 
those students in the different schools and several grades who 
receive the highest grade are published monthly. I find that 
this has proven.a very healthy stimulus, and I will here recom- 
mend it. We have organized a crusade against the old school- 
house, and desire to have fewer school-houses and better ones. 
At the examination for graduation last year in the public 
schools, twenty-five passed and received diplomas. I do not 
know that I can. say any thing else of special interest, or 
that will represent the county. I will say, however, that, not-

withstanding these evidences of progress in the work, that we 
are behind what we ought to be.” 
Prof. W. E. Thompson, principal of the high-school in Bed- 
ford: 
“While I appreciate the honor of representing Bedford 
County, I reluctantly assume the responsibility. I have, how- 
ever been identified with the public schools of the county since 
their organization, and know something of their past history 
and present condition. Bedford County went to work in good 
earnest at the outset, and has since kept pace with the progress 
of the times. Our steady progress is attributable, largely, to the 
efficient county supervision, which we have had from the begin- 
ning. 
“Our growth, of choice, has been slow, but continuous and 
healthful. No effort has been made to boom or unduly stimulate, 
put a vigorous, substantial growth bas been sougKt. Realizing 
the value of united, systematic effort, we have thoroughly, har- 
moniously, and permanently organized our forces. 
~“Our County Court is a body of considerate, liberal-minded 
men, friendly to the cause of free education and ready to give 
substantial aid. 
“Our Directors, in the main, are good men, and devoted to 
the work. Our teaching force has been improved from year to 
year, until the entire body is to-day made up of conscientious 
men and women, who have chosen teaching as a profession, and 
-are devoting themselves to the work. Many of them would be 
here to-day if not engaged in their work. Unanimity of feel- 
ing, thought, and action has been especially marked during the 
past six years. Institutes have been held each year, and have 
been well attended, constantly growing in numbers and in favor 
with the teachers and the people. Our Teachers’ Reading Cir- 
ele has met monthly for five years, having missed but one meet- 
ing. 
“ During this year educational mass-meetings have been held 
at different points in the county. These have proven a prolific 
source of benefit to the schools. Notwithstanding every part

of the work is now enjoying a gradual growth, we are not per- 
fectly satisfied with our condition, but aspire to something even 
better than we have yet known. We are proud of our county 
‘and the progress we are making. We are certainly getting as 
much education to the dollar as the present school-law will al- 
low.” 
J. W. Duggan, Superintendent of Blount: 
“T cannot claim for Blount that she is a fine county in her 
public schools, for the reason that we are short of funds and 
buildings. The building of railroads and the development of 
her rich marble quarries hinder us. 
“We have seventy-cight white and ten colored free schools, 
which are in a healthy state of development. The terms have 
lengthened, and now run five months or more. The teaching 
foree has been improved, and the work is more systematically 
performed. Many of our schools are now graded in accordance 
with the regular course of study. In addition to our public 
schools, we have four academies and two colleges doing good 
work for the higher education of our people.” 
M. R. M. Burke, Superintendent of Bradley: 
“Tam glad to have the honor to represent Bradley County, 
and to speak of her interests in the public schools for the past 
six years. I am glad, this morning, to meet the members of 
this Association in this grand and noble work. Bradley County 
has a population of about 10,000 inhabitants; she has a popu- 
lation of about 5,400 school-children. She has during the past 
six years made rapid advancement along the line of educational 
work. Six years ago the-value of the property given by the 
State was over $7,660; to-day the value of the public school 
property is $35,000. She has, I may say, about seven dollars 
worth of property to every child of school-age, and three and 
one-half dollars worth of property to every inhabitant that 
lives within her bounds. Six years ago the first Normal Insti-
-P-A-G-E-201
20 PROCHEDINGS OF THE 
  
tute was held in Bradley County, and since that time two have 
been held each year. We have fifty schools in the county. We 
have property assessed at $4,300,000, and we expend only 
$12,000 in the interest of public schools. We have not only 
public schools, but we have four academies and two city schools . 
in the city of Cleveland, one for whites and one for colored 
pupils. We have, in addition to these, two excellent female 
colleges, one presided over by that saintly man, Dr. Sullins. 
“The city schools are under the supervision of Prof. D. C. 
Arnold, a man well qualified for the work to which he is called. 
We have fifty public schools, and I believe that I can say con- 
scientiously to-day that our teachers are advanced two hundred 
per cent. of what they were six years ago through the instru- 
mentalities that have been brought about by the normal schools 
and by the Institutes. We are holding Institutes during the fall 
at the end of each month, and I believe that I can safely say 
to-day (if Brother Huffaker will excuse me) that Bradley 
County is among the foremost counties in State education.” 
Miss Mollie Pierce, Superintendent of Dyer: 
“TI am glad to be allowed to speak of the schools of my 
county, as I think it most truly my duty, as Superintendent. 
We have good schools in our county, and the people to a great 
extent are interested. I cannot claim any credit for this state 
of affairs, as I have only had the supervision since October, but 
I can say that I have been an humble teacher in the county, 
and have always loved my work. It is my work, as Superin- 
tendent, to raise the standard by advocating trained teachers. 
One of the first steps that I made was to set up Dyer County 
Teachers’ Institute, which has had a great effect.” 
Wm. T. Shepard, Superintendent of Grainger : 
“T am proud to have the privilese of representing Grainger 
County at this meeting. I had the opportunity to meet with 
you last year at Nashville. I can say that Grainger County’s
-P-A-G-E-202
Convention oF Pustic Scnoon OFFIcERs. 23 
t 
interest in education is gradually increasing. She has a schol- 
astic population of 5,227, and, I think, 61 schools. We are 
trying to abandon teaching in the churches. There have been 
a great many schools taught in churches in that county, but I - 
_ think in two years we will build new school-houses. As I have 
said before, I think the interest in education in that county has 
been increasing gradually cach year for the last six years. We 
have as good teachers as any county in the eastern part of the 
State. Ithink in two years our money will be sutlicient to 
continue our schools longer. The lack of money has been one 
of the great troubles, and the terms have been too short. We 
are having about forty miles of railroad constructed through 
our county, and I think after this is completed we will be able 
to continue our schools several months.”   
John Scruggs, Superintendent of Grundy County: 
“Tam here as the representative of Grundy County. Iam 
like the other speakers who have preceded me. I am glad, as 
Brother Foster remarked, to represent Grundy County ; and, as 
one speaker remarked about Knoxville that it was about as 
near heaven as we can get, I will say that Grundy County is 
very mountainous. I can say for Grundy County that it has 
made rapid progress for the last few years. This is the sixth 
term that I have had the honor to act as Superintendent of that 
county. I was elected Superintendent when our present sys- 
tem was first inaugurated, and since that time there has been 
wonderful progress made. As the time is short that I have to 
speak, I cannot sit down without speaking especially about our 
high-school at Tracy City. Through the generosity of Col. A. 
M. Shook, there has-been built a public school-bouse in Tracy 
City, the cost of which is $85,000. We have a fine school there 
now, with four hundred and fifty pupils in attendance, which is 
free to the citizens of the county. This is called the James K. 
Shook’s school-building. This is a college, and students can 
graduate there. We have had better success with our schools 
the past year than ever experienced before. Our people take a 
great interest, and we have had better teachers than ever before.
-P-A-G-E-203
22 PRoceEepINes OF THE 
  
Upon the whole, I will say. that Grundy County is advancing 
in the great cause of popular education. 
H. G. Huffaker, Superintendent of Hamilton: 
“Last year I began my speech by saying that I was glad to 
represent 'the great city of Chattanooga, but as I am to-day 
enjoying a visit to Chattanooga’s greatest rival, I shall not say 
that. Since 1887, when I was first elected Superintendent, the 
schools have been put into successful operation. I think we have 
one of the best systems of country graded schools in the State. 
We had no. system of gradation in 1887. Now we have all of 
this, and to-day our common schools are very excellent, and 
are doing good work. Since that time we have put up twenty 
new buildings, costing from $400 to $3,000 each. The scholastic 
population has increased from 4,950 to 16,516. ‘The schools 
have been improved very rapidly in the point of facilities. In 
the last two years seventeen schools have put in improved desks. 
‘We have made progress in every line. Our schools are do- 
ing better work, and I want to say that our Directors are ear- 
nest and faithful. They realize the very great importance of 
energetic teachers, and so make an effort to secure this kind of 
teachers. The salary of the humble Superintendent has been 
increased from $50 to $100 per month, which enables me to 
give all of my time to the work.” 
D. A. Green, Superintendent of Hancock: 
“TI am glad to have the honor to represent Hancock County, 
her teachers and pupils. We have about fifty public schools 
in Hancock County, and about fifty-four teachers, if I am right, 
and about 4,500 boys and girts. I think we are doing a good 
work in Hancock County. The work has been slow, and has 
not been elevated, but we are trying to elevate it, and I think 
in the near future that we will see Hancock County and her 
public schools standing side by side with the other counties of 
the State. The County Court has been very liberal toward the

public school-system, and the amount of the school-fund is in- 
creasing. The best work that was done, I think, was to call a 
meeting of the School-directors, and to adopt a course of study 
here, which has been working well. We think we have done 
right in placing a course of study'in the hands of the teachers, 
and I would say that the Directors are more up to their 
work, and doing a better work, at present, and getting along 
better in every respect, and I think in the near future that we 
will see Hancock standing by the side of all the counties of the 
State.” 
Mr. Henry Walker, of Hardin: 
“Jt is quite a surprise for me to have the honor of represent- 
ing Hardin County in this meeting. I am happy to say that 
the educational outlook of our county is more encouraging 
than ever before. Much of the interest manifested in. the im- 
provement of our public schools is due to the earnest efforts of 
our County Superintendent, Miss Moore, who has succeeded in 
permanently organizing the Teachers’ Institute, which now 
holds its meetings in various parts of the county, and is awak- 
ening within the teachers a sense of the importance of pro- 
gressive methods of instruction. 
“ Our Normal Institute last June was quite a success. It was 
largely attended not only by the teachers of our county, but 
also by the citizens, and the discussions of plans and methods of 
instruction showed that the teachers were interested in their 
work and endeavoring to improve themselves. 
“The Directors of our county have an organized Institute, 
and are manifesting much interest in the work of education. 
They are building better school-houses and furnishing them 
with patent desks and other improved appliances. This we 
consider to be a step in the right direction. 
“Hardin College is under the management of an earnest edu- 
cator, and the large attendance and excellent grades of the past 
quarter show that it is in a thriving condition. 
“ Nixon, Saltillo, and Shiloh high-schools are in operation 
throughout the year, and are doing active work.

“On the whole our outlook is very encouraging, and we hope 
next year to make even greater progress than we have this 
year.” 
“Loyd Livesay, Superintendent of Hawkins: 
“Tam glad to represent Hawkins County. During the past 
year I think we have done some very successful work in our 
county. Among the first things which we have accomplished 
was the organization of the Teachers’ Institutes in the various 
parts of the county. We have a great many teachers in our 
county. It is very profitable for them to attend at one of these 
places, so we have divided our county into six Institute districts, 
and we have found a live and wide-awake interest taken ‘in each 
one of these Institute districts. 
“We hold our Institutes monthly during the school-term, and 
we have an Institute in this way for all the teachers in our 
county. We have 105 white schools and 15 colored schools in 
our county. We have several high-schools. We have con- 
nected the public schools of Hawkins County with every single 
one of these schools in some shape or other, except one female 
school, which is not connected. All of our high-schools are 
connected with the public schools. We have held an Institute 
during the year, which was largely attended by both teachers 
and students of the county. Our School-directors attended all 
the Institutes we have held, and we had a most successful In- 
stitute, continuing for three months. Professor Graybill, the 
president of the female college at Rogersville, conducted this 
Institute, and suggested that it was the duty of the County 
Superintendent to call the teachers together in their Normal 
Schools, and of the teachers to go to those in their counties, and 
elect their president for the next year, so that the County 
Superintendent will not be under the necessity of establishing 
Normal Schools. I think that our Institute and the Normal 
School work that we have accomplished has done a great deal 
for the elevation of the public schools. We have a course of 
study and rules similar to those adopted by this Association at 
Nashville last year. SoJ think we are getting along splendidly.

Our school-term will average more than five months in some 
districts, and we have none less than four months.” 
Isaac A. Hunter, Superintendent of Hickman: oe 
“Tt gives me much pleasure to represent Hickman County in 
this body. If I mistake not, this is the first time that Hick- 
man County has ever been represented in one of these meetings, 
and that very fact goes to prove that Hickman County is on 
rising ground. Up to this year the schools of Hickman County 
have used a promiscuous lot of text-books. During the month 
of May the Directors of that county met and agreed to adopt a 
uniform set of text-books. While it does not count in every 
district in the county, it has already accomplished a great 
amount of good, and the Superintendent is urging the other Di- 
rectors to adopt the same text-books that have been adopted by 
the Directors who have met and agreed to adopt these books. 
After that was done the next important thing was to organize 
a Teachers’ Institute—another thing that had. never been done 
in Hickman County—and since that time we have held Insti- 
tutes monthly at the different. points of the county. I want to 
say right here that since I have been Superintendent (which is 
about six months) the teachers of Hickman County have im- 
proved, and are better qualified this year than they have ever 
been heretofore. There is a greater interest manifested in the 
cause of education than has ever been known before; but one 
‘thing is holding us back. In Hickman County we have sixty- 
nine school-districts. In other words, we have a school-district 
for nearly every school-house in the county. That ought not 
to be so. I have urged the people about that through the pub- 
lic press and through the county papers, to try to get the people 
and the County Court to agree that the civil districts and the 
school-districts be identical, and I believe that we will accom- 
plish this. It is a fact admitted by all that some change should 
‘be made. Take one district, for instance: We have one district 
that was organized at the July term of Court, in which there 
are only twenty pupils. I have no power to say that it shall 
not be so. The law does not signify how many pupils there
-P-A-G-E-207
26 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 
  
shall be in a school-district. One cause, I think, is the misap- 
prehension of the law. The law has a right to divide the dis- 
tricts; the Directors have the right to say that the districts shall 
be divided into two, three, or more districts, with separate Di- 
rectors. ” The law simply means that the districts should be so 
divided that there shall be one school for every district.” 
R. P. Donnelly, Superintendent of Johnson : 
“Tam glad to have the honor to represent Johnson County 
for the first time in this Association; but I did not come here 
to say so much about Johnson County and her schools as to 
learn something that, perhaps, I can use to advantage after 
, awhile in the schools. We have thirty-four schools in Johnson, 
thirty teachers, and a scholastic population of 3,436. The 
school-fund is $5,000. This is a great drawback to our schools, 
as we can only run some of them four months and others five 
months. We had a Normal School at Mountain City last year, 
which lasted for a month, and which was of great advantage to 
the teachers. They all attended it. At the close of the school 
we organized a Teachers’ Association, which has been doing 
a great deal of good for the teachers. We hope, by hard work, 
to make the schools of Johnson County a little better than they 
are at the present time.” 
J.C. Ford, Superintendent of Knox: 
“There being so. many representative educators present 
to-day from Knoxville, and from Knox County, it is with 
some degree of embarrassment that I respond. I will say, 
however that the public schools of all kinds are doing very 
well. We have 145 in number, with 165 teachers. We have 
a scholastic population of 21,795, with a school-fund of over 
$100,000, and consequently all the schools last from five to ten 
months. We also have the work fairly well organized in the 
Normal Colleges and regular Institutes in portions of the 
county during the school-term.””

Daniel Vincent, Superintendent of Marion: 
“T must say that I am glad to have the honor of represent- 
ing Marion County, as well as the pleasure of meeting you all 
here. I feel that while Iam here I may be able to enjoy the 
inspiration of this eastern country and this eastern town of 
Knoxville. As the emigration of education and civilization is 
westward, I feel that we in Marion County—which is contigu- 
ous to Hamilton County—are meeting the morning rays of 
light and education. This is the second time that I have had 
the honor to represent Marion County. 
“We have been very earnest in our work, and we feel that 
our county is rapidly advancing in the interest of education. 
‘We have a scholastic population of 5,500, with a public school- 
fund of less than $15,000. Our schools run from three to ten 
months. We have some mountain country in which the people 
are thinly settled, and in some of those districts some of the 
schools continue only about three months, and in some locali- 
ties, where they are thickly settled, they have schools continu- 
ing for ten months. I take a great deal of interest in the work, 
as do also all the teachers and officers who are concerned in 
the public schools. The teachers in Marion County are getting 
better every year, and are taking a deeper interest in education, 
as they have learned that they are not fully qualified to teach 
school unless their souls have been stimulated and elevated to 
it; in other words, unless they have that patriotism that will 
cause them to have a deep interest in the education and devel- 
opment of the rising generation.” 
J. H. Lowry, Superintendent of Monroe: 
“T can say, as the other Superintendents, that I am glad to 
be here. Asmy-friend on the left, I have never done any thing 
in speech-making; but I see what is wanted is something of the 
facts of the history of the county. I think I can give you that 
in the three minutes allowed. The Superintendent of Monroe 
County has never been in this body before. As one speaker 
-has said in his testimony, I can say that we are advancing. We

have made about the same progress as many of the other coun- 
ties have made. In 1887—three years ago—the schools were 
just running along at random. The teachers were employed by 
the Directors, were paid the money, and then went into some- 
thing else until fall came. We have been taking steps to or- 
ganize, and we have organized, our teachers and Directors into a 
Directors’ Association, which meets twice a year. In these we 
take an interest. It is the duty of the Directors to come to- 
gether. Wehave aschool-law, but they do not understand how 
to execute it. Wealso had a Normal meeting, which lasted for 
two weeks. “We had Superintendent Hyden, of Loudon, with 
us for two weeks, and he rendered us very excellent service. 
We have a scholastic population of several thousand. We have 
. divided these into seventy-seven schools—sixty-seven of which 
are white and ten colored; and we also have four civil districts. 
We have seventy white téachers and ten colored. Our schools 
. Tun from three and a half to six months. We have one at 
Sweetwater that will continue a full year. This is the first year 
that we have had public schools in Sweetwater, partly under 
the management of Professor Bryant. The people of the town 
are proud of it, and are glad they have taken this step. We 
think it is going to add much to the general interests of the 
public schools of Monroe County. We have a number of col- 
leges in Monroe County, but they are not run by the State. We 
have Sweetwater College, J. W. Bachman, President, who is 
well known not only in East Tennessee but also in other States.” 
A. D. Williams, Superintendent of Morgan: 
“Tam glad to meet with you at this Association. I cannot 
boast of my county as being one of the best. It is situated on 
the Cumberland plateau, and it is as near heaven as any of the 
other counties. We have a population of 8,000, and a scho- 
lastic population of little less than 3,000. We held a Normal 
School in July, which has done a great deal of good. It was 
largely attended by the teachers, especially the last week of the 
examination. Our schools began the first of July, and will

continue for from five to seven months. We have school-tax 
sufficient to run them three and one-half months.” 
Ensley Fisher, Superintendent of Rhea: 
“Tam glad to say that I represent Rhea County. I cannot 
say, as some of the representatives of my sister counties, that 
she is one of the banner counties. Our work is progressing 
rather slowly. It was in a very. bad condition when I took it, 
and it is bad enough yet. It needs to be improved. I have 
done all that was in my power, and tried to organize an associa- 
tion of teachers and Directors. It is a hard county to do any 
thing with. The scholastic population is about 6,000, I think. 
I have no report from the Trustee of the county. I have tried 
to get it, but have failed to do so. I think that by the help of 
our County Court and our Directors we can probably get her 
out of the mire. She shows up better now than she did two 
years ago.” ,

J.D. Nelson, Superintendent of Rutherford :

“Our friend on the right always gets half of my speech, and 
you must allow me, Mr. Chairman, more .time.. I cannot say 
that I am proud to be in Knoxville, as everybody else has said. 
Iam away up here in the mountains near heaven. When I go 
away I go to that central basin away down yonder within five 
hundred feet of sea-level. I cannot say that I am proud to be 
with you, but Iam glad to see how you are here, and when I 
go away I will tell those good people of Rutherford, ‘They are 
the best people in the world.’ I am glad to have the honor to © 
represent that county of Rutherford, with her beautiful city of 
Murfreesboro in her center, sitting within one mile and a half 
of the geographical center of this grand old State of Tennessee. 
I represent that county and her noble sons, of whom I am one 
‘of which. [Laughter.] Everybody can laugh at me—my friend 
on the right never laughs. Iam here to represent the county 
that produces every year over $500,000 worth of agricultural

implements. The other counties of the State cannot boast of 
that. I am here to represent a county that has not a queen 
city, as Knoxville and Chattanooga and these other great cities, 
but one who has a city at whose depot there lies to-day over 
$10,000 worth of red cedar. In addition to this, we have grand 
schools. Our little town of Murfreesboro has only 8,800 in- 
habitants—noble people!—but our county spreads out and 
enumerates 15,280 school-children. I am here to represent 
. those, the little urchins of that county. I can now say that I 
am proud to be with you.” 
President Allen then spoke as follows: 
“ Mrs. O’Donnell had made all of her arrangements to be here, 
and wrote that she would reach Nashville last Saturday. I 
learned at a very late hour that she was sick, and am satisfied 
that sickness is the cause that keeps her from being with us. I 
am sorry that she is not with us to-day.” 
W.M. Poe, Superintendent of Sullivan: 
“J am proud to have the honor of representing old Sullivan 
County in this intelligent body to-day. While I cannot boast 
that Sullivan is in the lead, I am proud to say that I believe she 
is keeping pace with the balance of the counties of Tennessee 
in education. We have in our county about eighty-three 
schools. Seventy-eight of these are white and five are colored. 
We have about four high-schools, or academies, in the county. 
The public school is, in fact, the most general school. We 
have had also a scholastic population of about 7,500 during my 
administration, which has only been two years. My firat step 
was to get the school-fund increased. Previous to this time the 
public school-term had only been about eighty-three days. 
During the past year we had an average term of about five and 
one-half months. I am also glad to say that my predecessors 
had organized Institutes in the county. During the past year 
I believe we had about four Institutes. We also spent a two

weeks’ term in the Normal Institute, and we had about sixty- 
five teachers who attended that Institute. I am glad to say 
that our teachers are improving gradually, and the cause of 
education in our county is having a gradual and permanent 
growth. I do not know that it is necessary to occupy any 
more of your time. I am glad to have the honor of represent-. . 
ing Sullivan County, and to say that she is keeping pace in the 
educational progress.” ~ 
J. M. D. Nelson, Superintendent of Union: 
“As all the rest of the counties have been represented in this 
honorable body, we have been made to wonder where Union 
County was. Union County is situated between the two great 
central points of interest to the State—Knoxville and the Cum- 
berland Mountains. While Union County is not as far ad- 
vanced as Knox in the point-of education, I am glad to tell you 
that she has beautiful hills and valleys, nice streams, and it is 
one of the finest health-producing countries that we have in 
East Tennessee. And I can say right here that I am not a 
specimen of Union County. But besides her hills and valleys 
we have school-houses on her hills, and we have them also in 
her good valleys. While the schools of Union County are not - 
what we wish that they might be, we are not at all disappointed 
at our school-system. We have fifty-four schools in our county 
for whites and one for colored. _ Not many colored people at- 
tend school in our county. In fact, there are not enough of 
them. There are only about forty colored students in the 
county. While there are 4,751 whites in our high-schools, these 
schools are not what we wish them to ke. All our schools run 
ten months. We believe the schools of Union County in the 
future will be much better than they are now.”

82 ProckEDINGS OF THE 
  
White in a three minutes’ speech; and I cannot begin to tell 
you, but will give you an outline of what we think we have 
done during the last year. We have held Institutes every 
month this year, and we held a summer Institute of two weeks. 
I have visited the schools of my county during the year. We 
have seventy schools in number, sixty white and ten colored; 
we have a scholastic population of 5,212; we have eighty-two 
teachers. In the summer Normal Institute we had one hundred 
and eight teachers, most of them being from White County, 
and some from adjoining counties. I think our teachers are . 
progressing rapidly. Since I have been County Superintendent 
they have improved wondertully. Our teachers are mostly 
young men and young women, are vigorous, active and ener- 
getic, progressive and wide-awake, and much devoted to their 
profession. Very few old teachers are now taking part in our 
work. During the last four years we have built eighteen school- 
buildings in White County, furnished several of them with 
patent desks and some with globes and maps. We have in 
White County two colleges and some high-schools, which are 
doing excellent work. Our State Superintendent gave us, four 
years ago, a State Normal Institute, which added a great deal 
to the progress of education in our county. We had there with 
us Capt. Douglass and Prof. Karns, of the University here, who 
did most excellent work. 
“Our County Court has increased the school-tax from twenty 
to thirty-five cents, and we have increased the salaries of teach- 
ers from $24 and $25 to $32. While I cannot say that the 
schools of White County are what we would like to have them 
by a considerable distance, yet I can report progress, I think, in 
every respect. My record shows a large population. I believe 
that it was mentioned that it was 5,212. It shows an increase 
in attendance, in order, in system, and in better qualified teach- 
ers. Directors are doing their work more satisfactorily. Our 
old school-building is being torn down and a new one erected. I 
believe that the county is putting on a better aspect education- 
ally, and do not think that the county of White was ever more 
thoroughly alive to the public school-interest than she is to- : 
day.” J

’ Prof. Thos. L. Bryan, Superintendent of the Sweetwater City 
Schools, was, at the suggestion of Superintendent Smith, in- 
.Vited to address the meeting. He spoke as follows: 
“Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“T want to say, in regard to Sweetwater, that we have heard 
a great deal this morning about boom towns, our country boom- 
ing, etc., and I wish to include Sweetwater in this. section. 
However, as respects finances, I am like the old lady who at- 
tended a protracted meeting and was a mourner all the way 
through. After the meeting she was asked if she felt any 
change. She put her hand ‘in her pocket and said she did not 
feel a cent. Sweetwater is in a booming country, but when I 
put my hand in my pocket I do not feel a cent financially be- 
cause of it. . 
“Tt was said by a certain man that of all the continents, 
North America was the grandest; that the United States was 
the best part:of North America, and that Tennessee was: the 
3—App.B.
-P-A-G-E-215
34 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 
  
best part of the United States; and the facts show that East 
Tennessee is the best part of the State of Tennessee, and I am 
here to tell what everybody knows—that Sweetwater is the 
best part of East Tennessee. So you can guess what the con- 
- dition of the public schools of Sweetwater is. They are com- 
paratively new. Our honored Superintendent, Frank Smith, 
helped us establish them last summer. They are the first 
Sweetwater has had, and. they have had remarkable success 
during the past year. Sweetwater has three flourishing schools, 
and, as a certain gentleman said this morning, I am one of: the 
teachers. We have a public school, a male school, and a female 
school. The schools of Sweetwater are run by taxation, and 
the people are willing to pay taxes to get a good school, but 
generally we will have to run a current of electricity through 
our County Courts and get more money. We may talk about 
- enthusiasm and better teachers, but money is essential. Teach- 
ers that are any account. will insist on knowing in advance the 
amount that is to be paid them. If we have money we can get 
good teachers, Superintendent Huftaker and the Superintend- 
ent of this county pay good wages; and our best teachers, the 
speaker excepted, have gone to these counties, and we get the 
one-horse fellows back in the counties where the salaries are 
smaller. Lregard money, therefore, as our greatest need. More 
money will bring better teachers, better teachers better times, 
and better times will make everybody happy.” 
Prof. J. A. Rayl, a member of the Board of Education of 
Knoxville, was, at the suggestion of Dr. Dabney, invited to 
speak, which he did, as follows: 
“TI do not think I have been in the Association long enough 
to be initiated into the manner of procedure, and scarcely know 
what you want. We have a Superintendent to represent our 
schools, and he can do it much better than I can. I can simply 
give you a few items of information. We have been running 
public free schools twenty years, during which time I have been 
connected with them, and, as the young man from Sweetwater 
said, the great trouble is the money matter. We started with
-P-A-G-E-216
CoNVENTION oF PusLic ScHoon OFFICERS. 85 
  
$3,000 a year, and the authorities thought that was a great deal 
to spend. We have gone on until we spend $40,000 for teachers 
alone, besides the other expenses; and we get the $40,000 just 
as easily as we got the $3,000; but if we had, at the start, asked 
for $40,000, or even $10,000, we would not have gotten it. We 
have an excellent attendance. We have about sixty teachers, 
and most of them are good teachers. There are some, how- 
ever, rather indifferent. I went the other day into the school- 
room of a man whose reputation upon the books of the Super-— 
intendent is good. Upon examination he answered ninety- 
four questions out of a hundred, and answered them correctly. 
I. visited his room and witnessed a recitation in Holman’s 
Arithmetic. I went to school forty years ago, but I happened 
to know that arithmetic pretty well. The teacher did not put 
@ question in half an hour that was answered correctly. He 
was shooting over the heads of the childfen—using big words 
that college graduates would hardly understand—and expecting 
to get an answer out of the pupils. But that is very unusual. 
Of course he’ was a man, for I have never heard of a woman 
doing that way. he reason I say that is this: we have ladies 
jn our schools who have been there since the schools com- 
menced. They commenced as girls of fifteen or sixteen, and 
have, with few exceptions, taught from the beginning, and 
made admirable teachers. I hope they will be allowed to come 
here to-morrow and witness the proceedings of this Association. 
“When we commenced these schools, if a book-keeper was 
wanted we had to send to New York or Philadelphia or some 
other place than Knoxville, but now the conditions are changed. 
There are young women here who can do that work, and we do 
not have to import women for any such purpose. We brought 
this about through our course of study. Some of the people 
are poor, but not many, for the people are pretty rich up this 
way. Some of them work for a living. They go through a 
part of the course, and to the commercial, school, and they are 
' qualified for their work; and their progress has been, while not 
satisfactory—not. what we would like to see it—remarkably 
good. Here is a young man before us who helped start this 
county when it was in the hollows; when it was doing nothing 
for education; and to-day, while we are not doing what we

years ago. The sun is beginning to. shine in the hollows and 
dark places; and, as General Booth says of England, ‘ Darkest 
England and the way out of it,’ we have learned the way out, 
and it is by the public schools; and I hope we will all join in 
making a grand pull for redeeming the State from the ignorance 
that now enshrouds the young people.” [Applause.] 
Prof. W. M. Graybiil, principal of the Synodical School at 
Rogersville, upon invitation, spoke as follows: 
“Ladies and Gentlemen and Fellow-teachers : 
“Tam very glad indeed to have the privilege of looking into 
the faces of the teachers of the State of my adoption. It has 
been my pleasure for the last five or six years to attend the 
school-gonventions of the educators of my native State, and I 
congratulate myself that, having severed my connection with 
those pleasant friends, the friends of my youth and college days, 
my lines have fallen in such pleasant places; and I congratulate 
you, ladies and gentlemen, upon the outlook that you have here 
for a pleasant and successful convention. I can scarcely help 
but express my regret at the absence of so many teachers, and 
I hope we shal! have an explanation later on of the reason why 
we have not a full meeting. I expected to see three or four 
hundred teachers and Superintendents here, especially in view 
of the fact that the State Superintendent and the president of 
this University made such a strong effort to secure a full attend- 
ance. I must, however, congratulate you on the outlook, the 
earnestness that I see displayed; and I am glad that Providence 
itself seems to smile upon us as the sun this morning broke 
away the clouds of three or four days; and I congratulate you 
on the pleasant reception we had this morning by His Honor, 
the Chief Executive of the city, the other gentleman who made 
. the beautiful address, and the young lady in her response. It 
seems that I have never seen an educational.meeting open under 
more auspicious circumstances. EF thought this morning, as I 
heard those pleasant remarks made, and those cordial regards. 
extended, of an incident of which many of you-have. read, and .

which I will give at the risk of repeating. It is said that 
Jupiter Olympus once offered a crown of immortality to that 
man who would do most good to his fellow-men, and’ itis said 
that when the time came for the reward to be conferred, a great 
crowd of aspirants met on Mount Olympus. The competitors 
presented their claims. The orator was there, and boasted of 
his power over the listening multitudes; the poet was there, 
and claimed that his verse had power to stir the inmost emotions 
of man; the artist showed his power to portray. the lines of life 
and beauty upon the glowing canvas; the sculptor held up his-.. 
almost animated creations to view. After awhile Jupiter saw 
on the outskirts of the crowd an aged man, who was gazing ~ 
with great eagerness upon the assembled throng, and Jupiter 
said: ‘Who art thou?’ The old man, with great diffidence, 
replied: ‘I am not a competitor; I'am only a teacher, and all 
these were once my pupils.’ ‘Crown him,’ said the monarch; 
‘crown the faithful teacher with immortality.” And so the 
good people of this city have manifested their interest in you, 
and in the public education of our State, by coming. out here 
with their smiles and cordial greetings, and crowuing you with 
their favor; and I hope that we, while in their midst, will show 
such zeal and earnestness in the work that lies before us as will 
make us the worthy guests of these truly worthy hosts. 
“As I have only three minutes in which to address this con- 
vention, it is difficult for me to think what would most interest 
you. We have had favorable reports, and they have to me 
been edifying and gratifying, as they must be to all the friends 
of the schools of our State. They have given us a favorable 
impression of the work that is being done throughout the State. 
We have a full programme, and I am glad to see that able men 
will discuss the different subjects. Therefore, I think the in- 
trusion of remarks by a stranger like myself would ‘be out of 
place. I thank you very much for your attention.” [Applause.] 
+ Upon motion of State Superintendent Smith, Mrs. French, 
of Knoxville, was invited to say a few words. 
“T do not know,” said Mrs. French, “why Mr. Smith said he 
would be glad to hear from me, because sometimes he has heard 
\
-P-A-G-E-219
  38 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 
  
things from me that he did not want to hear very much, and 
now, since this circular announcement of the teachers’ course 
at the University of Tennessee has been put into my hand, I 
think I can say something that Mr. Smith will not like to hear. 
The circular says: ‘Male teachers, holding certificates from 
County or City Superintendents, or producing satisfactory evi- 
dence that they have taught at least ten months acceptably in a 
private school, will be admitted to this department and receive 
free instruction. Having no suitable facilities for receiving or 
accommodating women, they cannot be admitted.’ 
“T want to ask why, since women are teaching all over the 
State, and legislation has been made to encourage them in this 
profession, the great University of Tennessee has such a pro- 
vision as that which I have just read? I want to ask why I 
cannot come here and have the advantage of the instruction 
offered in this circular? What are the facilities that are de- 
manded here by the women and not by the men? If it is in 
the matter of recitation- “rooms, do the women require any 
better than you have? If it is the dormitories, let us women 
see if we cannot get a place to shelter us. In that respect we 
may do for ourselves what the University cannot do for us. 
“When I accepted an invitation this morning to address you 
I had not seen this circular. It gives me an opportunity to say 
something for the women, and I will say a word for them, as I 
have never failed to do.” [Applause.] 
- Superintendent Smith said he hoped that other opportunities 
would be given Mrs. French to speak, and that she would feel 
at home and let herself be heard upon every subject that she 
desired to discuss. 
Upon motion of Superintendent Billingsley, W. ‘B. Huffaker, 
of Chattanooga, was invited to speak. 
He accepted the invitation by saying: 
“TJ do not think it will take me three minutes to say what I 
have to say. Iam a teacher in the public schools of Hamilton

County. While we have good schools, I do not wish to brag 
on them so much as to say something of the co-operation which » 
exists among the teachers of that county. We, as teachers, 
work harmoniously together, as much so as the teachers of any ~ 
other county in the State, and I think we are as much interested 
in our work, be it ever so small, as is any set of teachers. We 
meet in our Institutes and discuss methods of teaching, and we. 
have uniformity of work all over the county. Our system of 
co-operation does a great deal along this line. I am glad to 
be here and to be permittéd to address you, but am not an 
orator and cannot make any particular address. I thank you 
for your attention.” 
J. O. Becker, of Knox County, spoke as follows: 
“Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“T do not know why I have been called upon. I feel some- 
what out of my place. I came here to learn. There are all. 
grades of work and different grades of occupation. We have 
in this building men who are overseeing the work; men who, 
working under them, are overseeing others; and we have also 
the man who is doing the work—who is the humble workman ; 
and, as such, I stand before you to-day. I have spent my life 
in school-work, but it has been as a workman in the school- 
room. Across yonder is the house in which I am at present 
endeavoring to teach. Some of the gentlemen here have struck 
the key-note when they said that what we need most is the 
money. ‘You cannot expect men to put forth their best efforts, 
you cannot expect to call into this profession the best talent in 
the country, unless they are paid for it; you cannot expect 
this work to be systematized unless there is sufficient money 
behind the work to carry it on. We to-day have a County 
Superintendent who is doing good work. He is spending his 
time for the welfare of the schools. However, it is not possible 
for him, with the remuneration that he receives, to do the work 
that he should do. It costs something to live here, and to travel 
continuously over the county away from home. It is impossi- 
ble for him to do it. It is impossible for me, as ‘a teacher, to

40 PRocEEDINGS OF THE 
  
work for the money that I am receiving, and if there is any 
way whatever for you gentlemen who are so earnest in this 
matter, and who have a greater influence than we humble 
teachers, to wake up the people of Tennessee and get them in- 
terested in supplying means for carrying on this work, I should 
be glad to see it accomplished. We need efficient work, and 
we need workmen at the wheel to-day that are skilled in this 
art, which is one of the greatest arts, dealing directly with the 
human mind. It is one of the highest callings, and it is bungled 
worse than any other profession that we have beneath the sun. 
Joseph A. Bryan spoke as follows: 
“Mr. President; Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“As Tam only a public school-teacher of Hamilton County, 
I wish to second what our worthy Superintendent has already 
said in regard to that county. While I believe what has been 
said about other counties, I am still inclined to place Hamilton 
at the top, probably because I am from that county. So far as 
Hamilton County’s schools are concerned, they are in a healthy 
condition. I attribute their great success to the untiring efforts 
of our Superintendent. I see before me Mr. M. R. M. Burke, 
another untiring laborer in the public schools; the man who, 
from an educational stand-point, has elevated Bradley County. 
As I have no other remarks to make, the ground as to Hamil- 
ton County having been covered, I express my gratification at 
being with you, and at, visiting the beautiful city of Knoxville.” 
A. F. Richards, of Sparta, spoke, at the suggestion of Super- 
intendent Billingsley, as follows: 
“Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“Tt seems to me that it is useless to call ‘anybody else to the 
floor.. I can only repeat what has already been said. I am 
glad, however, that I am a teacher in White County. I have 
been teaching in the public schools about six years, and have

made a slight success at it. .Our schools were, at the time I 
commenced, in a bad condition, our houses were in bad condi-~ 
tion, and our Superintendents, up to that time, had been in bad 
condition. Since that time we have had a Superintendent who 
has revolutionized the county almost altogether, and our schools 
have.made wonderful progress; and to-day I am proud to be a 
teacher in White County. I can add nothing that will interest 
or instruct you. I can only repeat what other men have said. 
I thank you.” 
Superintendent Nelson suggested that B. O. Duggan, of 
Bedford, be heard from. Mr. Duggan said that Bedford County 
had already been represented, and he himself had nothing to 
says . 
J. ©. Tucker, Superintendent of the City Schools of West 
Knoxville, was called upon, and responded in the following 
words: 
“Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“This is rather unexpected. I came in a few moments ago 
without expecting to be called upon. When I came in you 
were discussing the question of finances and paying teachers, 
and I hoped that that subject would be discussed at length. I 
am glad to be here, and hope that this convention of school- 
teachers and Superintendents will prove profitable to every one 
here, and that the fruits of the work will be shown long after- 
wards.” : 
State Superintendent Smith read a communication from Su- 
perintendent W. M. Fuqua, of Davidson County, expressing 
his regrets at being unable to be present, and stating that the 
schools of his county were in fine shape, especially financially. 
He also read a letter of regret from Capt. C. 8. Douglass, 
Superintendent of the City Schools of Gallatin. 
The Secretary read.a similar letter from Thomas H. Paine, of 
Jackson, : .

“ Seeretary of Convention of Publie School Officers: 
“Dear Sirn—Having received a copy of the excellent pro- 
gramme of your meeting, I cannot forbear to express my regret 
that duties here will prevent my attendance. I should be glad 
to meet with so many educators and persons interested in the 
great work of education. Such meetings augur well for the 
future of schools in our State. I trust and doubt not that the 
meeting will be both pleasant and profitable. I beg through 
yourself to express to the County School Superintendents, © 
especially, my interest in their work, and to remind them anew 
that the Tennessee School for the Blind is a part of the public 
school-system of the State, which is intended to supplement the 
common schools to such extent as to give all children an oppor- 
tunity for an education. Inquiry on the part of Superintend- 
ents of public schools will doubtless develop the fact that there 
are blind and partially blind children in almost every county 
who cannot be educated in the common schools at home. It 
will be an act of humanity to inform the parents and friends of 
such children that the school for the blind is open free of charge 
_ to such between the ages of seven and seventeen. The entrance 
of these into school may be hastened by sending me information 
as to their whereabouts. Again wishing you a pleasant session,

III. The County High-school the Connecting Link between 
the Public School and College: 
The above subject was discussed at the annual meeting held 
in Nashville in December last, when the following resolutions 
were adopted, viz: 
Wuerxas, Through the agency of our State, County, and District Institutes, our 
public schools have become very efficient in their work; and, 
Waeruas, Many of the children of the State, at an early age, are completing 
the public school course, even before they have passed the age that entitles them 
tg the benefits from the public school-fund; and, 
Wsereas, Many of our children are anxious to graduate in the colleges of the 
State; we would recommend, 
1, That this Association of Public School Officers appoint a committee of five 
active school-men to prepare a petition to the General Assembly of the State, to 
be presented at the next regular session of that body; and in said petition that 
committee set forth all the items necessary to secure the enactment of such law 
as will lead to the establishment of a high-school in each of the counties of the 
State; 
2. That the curriculum of said high-school be such as to fully qualify their 
pupils for successful matriculation in any college of the State; 
3. That the tuition in these high-schools be free to all who have completed the 
public school course, and are under twenty-one years of age; 
4, That this committee report to this body at its annual meeting in December, 
1890. 
The Chairman appointed the following gentlemen to prepare, in accordance 
with the report of the committee on “High-schools,” a petition asking the Legis- 
lature to establish a high-school in each county, the petition to be presented for 
approval to the next meeting of the Association: Dr. C. W. Dabney, Knoxville;

The Association was called to order at 10 o’clock. 
George W. Butler, of Roane County, led in prayer, invoking 
divine guidance during the proceedings of this meeting, and a 
final reward when this life’s work shail have been completed. 
\ . 
The following County Superintendents, who had not been 
present on Tuesday, were invited to deliver three-minute ad- 
dresses : 
W.-M. Carey, of Hamblen, said: 
. “Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“While in educational’ work the county of Hamblen is not 
what we would like to see it, we are glad to state to this con- 
vention that it is progressing rapidly; that the scales are falling 
away from our eyes, and our people are awaking to their inter- 
ests. Further, while we do not, as many of you Superintend- 
ents have done, claim that our schools are the best in the State, 
we do claim they are second to none.” 
E. M. Wright, of Greene, said: 
“Mr. Chairman, Ladies and: Gentlemen: 
“It affords me very much pleasure to meet with you. Iam 
sorry indeed that I could not be with you yesterday. I ar-_
-P-A-G-E-226

rived here at some sacrifice: I walked four miles, and came 
very near missing the train; and, in addition to that, I begged. 
my wife for one hour to let me come; but you see I am here; 
and I want to tell you that Greene County has a good reputa- 
tion. We have good publie schools and a good County Court— 
a court thatis alive to the cause of education; and when a call is 
sounded in Greene County for an Institute, mark you, the teachers 
respond. Atourlast Normal we enrolled one hundred and fifty 
or more. Our teachers are thoroughly at work; there is no 
question about that, but our schools are not what they ought to 
be. We need more money, longer school-terms, better teachers, 
and, I believe, that if we had a better County Superintendent 
we might get along better. We need a great many things. 
Our school-houges need better school-appliances, and we would 
be glad to see the gentleman who brought that desk here up in 
my county. Greene County is alive to the cause of education, 
and will do her part in holding up the banner for the cause of 
public schools. So I say, three cheers for Greene County!” 
F. T. Watts, of Washington, said : 
“Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“Tam very proud this morning to be here as the representa- 
tive of the old county of Washington. I can safely say that 
during the last five years the public schools iu the county have 
increased all along the line in the way of improvements at least 
twenty-five or thirty percent. Hight years ago we had no such 
thing as a Normal School or Institute. Now we have good 
Normal Schools every year, and five or six local Institutes held 
over the county to accommodate all the teachers; and I am 
proud to say that when we have a local Institute the teachers 
are there. Whenever we make a call for teachers from all the 
districts we can safely rely upon their coming. I can give you 
the reason why. The School-directors promised me last August 
that they would not employ a teacher who did not attend the 
‘Normal Schools and the local Institutes. The Directors have a 
greater influence to do good than have the Coumty Superintend- 
ents. For instance, suppose a teacher applies for a school in a
-P-A-G-E-227
46 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 
  
certain neighborhood or district, and the Directors say: ‘We 
will employ you if you will attend the Institutes; if you do 
ndt, we do not want you at all.’ You see what a power is here 
exerted to put the teachers in the Normal Schools and Institutes, 
and you see that the Superintendent has not that power. The 
public schools of Washington County are, as a general thing, 
doing fairly well, and our teachers are really doing good work— 
you might say first-class work; while, on the other hand, we 
have some teachers that are hardly teachers. They are school- 
keepers, and are not doing what they ought to do, but at present 
there is no way to avoid it. On the whole I think the public 
schools of Washington County are doing really good work.” 
Secretary Goodman offered the following resolution for ref- 
erence to the proper committee, accompanying its presentation 
with the explanation that the thanks of the Association should 
have been returned to the participants in the- entertainment 
referred to at the conclusion of the exercises, but the officers of 
the Association, as well as the other members, were so charmed 
with the programme rendered that they forgot all about ex- 
pressing their thanks until the crowd had dispersed : 
“Resolved, That the Committee on Resolutions be requested 
to prepare a suitable resolution expressive of the appreciation 
of this Association of the enjoyable and most creditable enter- 
tainment given last night by the Chi Delta and Philomathesiat: 
Societies of the University of Tennessee.” 
The resolution was, by a unanimous vote, referred to the 
Committee on Resolutions. 
Supt. J. W. Duggan, Chairman of the Committee on the 
on the Duties of County Superintendents, reported as follows: 
“Your Committee on the Duties of County Superintendents : 
“beg leave to submit the following report: 
' “We consider the office of County Superintendent the most. 
important’ link in the public school-system. Therefore, his 
duties should be clearly defined and faithfully executed.
-P-A-G-E-228

“First in importance we would place the examination of 
teachers, and recommend the following plan: Have annual 
‘Normal Institutes. Devote the last two days of the Normal 
Institute to a rigid written examination of the teachers. Ex- 
amine no one prior to the date of said Normal except when 
absolutely necessary. Have all certificates bear the same date 
as those issued at the close of said Normal Institute. 
“In gathering statistics, we recommend that the County 
Superintendent impress his Directors with the importance of 
having full and complete reports of the school-work. To this 
end the Directors should be prompt in making their reports to - 
the County Superintendent, and see that every teacher employed 
’ by them returns his register and abstract at the close of service 
or term, said register and abstract having been kept neatly and 
correctly. 
“We would further recommend that the County Superin- 
tendent, in his professional visitations, make a note of the 
various schools in such a manner as to be able to report thereon. 
“For the examination of applicants for scholarship to Uni- 
versity of Tennessee we recommend that the Superintendents 
use the examination questions sent out by the president of the 
university for their first examination, and for any subsequent 
examination use questions of similar grade of their own forma- 
tion or selection. 
“ We further recommend that Superintendents hold uniform 
examinations, at convenient points in their respective counties, 
for the graduation of pupils from the public school-course, and 
in view of the fact that there is a tendency to pass pupils too 
early from the course, we would recommend that:the examina- 
tion be rigid and the standard of gradation high.

The report was discussed as follows: 
Supt. J. C. Ford, of Knox: 
“The only clause of the report that I object to is that relat-
-P-A-G-E-229

‘ing to the final examination at the Normal. I do not think it 
is well to have examinations on only the last two days, because 
the teachers will find an excuse to be present just during the. 
examinations. In this county we have tried the plan of devot- 
ing the forenoons to Normal work and the afternoons to exam- 
inations, and in that manner we have secured the attendance 
of the teachers through the entire session of the Institute: 
That is the only objection that I have to the report, and I move 
that the resolution be so amended as to provide that the fore- 
noons shall be devoted to Normal work and the afternoons to 
. examinations.” 
Supt. E. L. Foster, of Anderson, seconded this: motion, say- 
ing that he had tried Superintendent Ford’s plan the previous 
year, and had found it to work well. 
Supt. H. D. Huffaker, of Hamilton, asked what would be 
done with the instructor, for whom a large sum had been paid, 
during all the afternoons that were devoted to examinations. 
He thought that the end of the week was the time for exami 
nations, and it would be well to let it be understood that no 
one would be examined who did not attend the Institute. 
Supt. W. N. Billingsley, of White, said: 
“My experience differs from that of the gentleman on my 
left (Mr. Ford). We have, about a month before the Institute, 
issued circulars stating that examinations would be held during 
the last days of the Institute, and that no one would be ex- 
amined who had not attended the Institute five days. By that 
means we have had the attendance of nearly every teacher in - 
the county, and I believe, as Mr. Huffaker said, that the ex- 
aminations should be held during the last days of the Institute.” 
Supt. M. R. M. Barke, of Bradley, said: 
«What is the use of having an examination at all for teachers 
whom you have examined for five or six years, and whose qual- 
fications you know as well as your own? I believe our State 
Superintendent, who sends us all our instructions, tells us that 
we shall issue certificates without examination to those who |
-P-A-G-E-230
Convention or Pusnic ScHoon OFFicers. 49 
  
have held first-class certificates for three years. Teachers who 
have graduated at our colleges will be allowed certificates with- 
out an examination, and I ask upon these grounds, Why hold 
the examination at all? . Since the resolution says ‘devoted to 
holding a rigid examination,’ could we not in Normal Institutes 
better appropriate the time that is allotted to holding a rigid 
examination to a consideration of the methods and the theory 
of teaching, which our teachers are more deficient in than in 
other qualifications?” 
Superintendent Ford said: “I want to reply to Professor 
Huffaker’s suggestion as to the instructor who assists in the 
Normal work. We have had good instructors in Knox County 
during the two last years, one of them one of the best Normal 
instructors that we have in the State, but I think the teachers 
would become tired of listening to him all day, and the in- 
structor would get tired himself. We devote an hour and a half 
tothelecture. As faras Mr. Billingsley’s teachers are concerned, 
it works a hardship upon them to be deprived of examination 
unless they attend the Institutes. It is hard for me to apply an 
iron-clad rule, and I have not been able to do it. I have not 
the nerve, if it takes nerve, to apply those rules in this county. 
If teachers come to me and insist on being examined, and are 
dependent upon their schools, I have to relax the rules to a con- 
siderable degree. You might enforce the rule, but I cannot do 
it in Knox County. 
Superintendent Billingsley: “I have done it, and can do it 
again, if necessary. It is no trouble for me to enforce an iron- 
clad rule when I believe it is the best for all concerned.” 
Supt. J. D. Nelson, of Rutherford, said: “Where does Mr. 
Billingsley get. his five-day law? We have no rule for exempt- 
ing any one from examination, except that the State Superin- 
tendent fixed three days’ attendance as necessary, and some of 
our counties have doubted that he had a right to make such a 
ruling. I do not doubt that, and have attempted to carry it 
out as much as possible. The gentleman behind me (Mr. Ford) 
’ takes two days a week for examinations, and if he should carry

Superintendent Ford: “We do not study arithmetic much.”: 
Superintendent Nelson: “I am satisfied of that; also that you 
do not study grammar either. Do not go to shooting me with that 
thing. I believe we ought to have examinations according 
to the report of this committee, and rigid examinations, too. 
No man.can stay out of the Institute and get in on my exam- 
inations. The teachers of my county understand that the ex- _ 
amination treats the hardest questions that come up during the . 
Institute, and, if a man drops in the last day, he will find that: 
he will get left. He will be compelled to come back and take 
another examination. I believe if you will conduct your ex- 
aminations that way, you will. get better results than by any. 
other.” : a 
Superintendent Billingsley: “TI adopted that plan, and the. 
other one too. I got three days from the State Superintendent, — 
and put on the other two myself. The plan works well,.and 1 : 
am going to keep on with it.” . 
  Superintendent Foster: “ During the warm days in J aly, oe

each morning and examinations in the afternoon make it 
easier on both the teachers and Superintendents, and it is as 
pleasant and more satisfactory.” 
Superintendent Nelson: “The gentleman objects to the ses- 
sion on account of the heat. He knows that the hottest time in 
the world is the teachers’ examination time.” 
Superintendent Nelson moved to lay Superintendent Ford’s 
amendment on the table. 
The motion to table was carried. 
Superintendent Huffaker said: “I think it is a short time 
to conduct an Institute—three days—with two days’ examina- 
tions following. It would be a better plan to have a week’s 
Institute work, with one day for examinations.” 
Superintendent Billingsley: “We recommend at least two 
’ weeks for Institute work and two days for examinations.” 
Professor Graybill offered a resolution to the effect that it 
should be the duty of County Superintendents to urge attend- 
ance upon State and County Normal Institutes and upon the 
teachers’ course at the University of Tennessee. 
“J find, “said Professor Graybill, “that from those counties in 
which we have energetic Superintendents, who are in sympathy 
with State Normals and with the other provisions made by the 
State for the training of teachers, we have a good attendance 
of teachers; and I believe it is in the power of the County 
Superintendents to crowd this University, and an indifference 
on their part will make the attendance very small, I fear. 
Moreover, I believe it is our privilege and duty, as County Su- 
perintendents, to urge the attendance of teachers upon the State 
Normals that are set apart for their instruction, and indifference 
on the part of the County Superintendents will make a small 
attendance. I think the matter lies very largely with the 
County Superintendents. Here is a young man who has a 
school to close in December. Tell him that the University of 
Tennessee has provisions to give instruction to him. He owes 
it to himself and his pupils to come to the University and spend 
those five months in training; and perhaps you have other 
schools in the State for the training of teachers.” 
Superintendent Nelson said: ‘That will do very well for 
the gentleman over there. He is at the head of a ladies’ school..
-P-A-G-E-233
  52 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 
  
Icould not go to my young men and. ask them to leave our 
high-schools and come here, and I do not believe it would be 
justice to my county to doso. I do not favor the resolution, and 
shall vote against it. We can build up schools at home. We 
have eighteen high-schools in our county, and some of them 
have as many pupils as this school.” * 
Professor Graybill: “The resolution applies mainly to the 
summer Normals.” . . : 
Superintendent Nelson: “If that is the intention of your 
resolution I will support it. I supposed that you urged us to 
attend the State University.” 
Professor Graybill: “The first clause pertains to our Normals, 
the second to the University. I want to say that I have all re- 
spect for every school: I would encourage the establishment of . 
‘a good high-school in every county. Ilike them. But here is _ 
something that I have observed in my State—south-west Vir- 
ginia. In many counties there we have second and third-class: 
schools that‘ cal] themselves high-schools and academies. The 
young men and young ladies spend there three or four months, - 
and some of their money, though the course does not cost 
much. The Superintendents of our State, at their last con- 
vention, said that they did not think that these schools were the 
best things for our public schools, for this reason: The young 
men went there and spent their time and money. They en- 
deavor to learn something, and in ‘some cases do, when we have 
in the State University a department where they might have 
the benefit of hearing the best teachers of the day—men of 
broad culture. This department is established by the State at 
its own cost, and many of these young, people ignore this de- 
partment and go somewhere else because instruction there is 
convenient. and cheap, and because of county and local pride. ’ 
‘Six, of those young men came to our city not long since from 
one of these schools, where they had spent five months. The 
County Superintendent, upon examination, asked those young 
men t6:prepare a formal application for a school. Only one of » 
the young men had ever been taught how to write a letter, what. 
° its form should-be, and how to fold and address it. The Super- 
‘gaye a practical, sensible examination, and one'o 
received a. third-class certificate, and the other

failed: This incident killed that particular school in the county. 
Tam not personal in my remarks, but I know that we make a 
great mistake when we, as County Superintendents, advise our 
young men to go to some second or third-class institution, when 
the State, in whose service they are engaged, has established 
institutions of the highest order, and supplied them with men 
of broad culture who are familiar with the methods which we 
wish to be carried out. It seems to me that loyalty to our 
State, State pride, and faithfulness to our teachers, should 
prompt us to urge the attendance of our teachers upon the very 
best instruction that we have, especially when it is given them 
by the State.” 
State Superintendent Smith said: “TI rise simply to explain 
this amendment to the report that has been offered as I under- 
stand it. We all agree. Superintendent Nelson is right. I in- 
dorse what he says. His first duty in his official capacity is to 
his county, and to its institutions as established; and if the re- 
port of another committee, of which I am a member, had been 
offered before the report which we are now considering, Super- 
intendent Nelson would not have offered any objection what- 
ever. The department recently established at the University 
is intended to take from Superintendent Nelson’s and other 
counties those teachers who have completed the course at the 
high-schools, and does not bid for those persons who have not 
done so. This department is intended to receive those who are 
seeking a higher education than can be given in the high- 
schools as established, and the report which Dr. Dabney will 
present will show very clearly that we are working for the es- 
tablishment of high-schools in every locality in the: State of 
Tennessee where they can be established; and we shall endeavor 
to give some enlightenment to the Legislature on this subject 
when it shall be presented to that body. There is no conflict 
between us if we understand each other. The resolution should 
be so amended that it will embrace with the State University 
every institution of like grade where normal training is given. 
It ought to mention the Peabody Normal College, which is the 
grandest institution of the kind in all the country, and which 
is doing a work that no other institution in the State, or in the 
South, has done. If the resolution shall be moditied so as. to 
express its real meaning, there will be no conflict betwgen us.”
-P-A-G-E-235
54 Prockeupines OF THE 
  
Superintendent Nelson said: “Ido not favor the resolution 
unless Professor Smith’s explanation is added. I move to lay 
it on the table until the other report comes in. We have stu- 
dents in both the State University and in the Normal College, 
and I will ask the Presidents of those institutions to tell how 
‘they stand on examination. Our schools are not of the kind 
mentioned by Professor Graybill.” 
Secretary Goodman suggested that it would be a better plan 
to refer the report, together with the resolution, back to the 
committee. The report was resubmitted as suggested. 
In a short while the committee again reported, submitting 
the report heretofore given and the following resolution, which 
was adopted without discussion : 
“Resolved, That it is the duty of County Superintendents to 
urge the attendance upon State and County Normal Institutes, 
and further recommend that all teachers who have completed 
the courses at the high-schools and colleges be urged to attend 
the teachers’ course at the University of Tennessee. at Knox- 
ville, or the Peabody Normal College, at Nashville.” 
The report of ‘the Committee on State, County, and District 
Institutes was presented by Chairman Wright, as follows: 
“Wuersas, We the publie school-officers of Tennessee appre- 
ciate the great good that has come to our public schools through’ 
the State Normals held by the aid of the Peabody fund; there- 
fore be it - 
“1. Resolved, That we, the members of the Public School- 
officers’ Association, express our sincere thanks to Dr. J. L. M. 
Curry, General Agent of the Peabody Fund, for the very kind 
and liberal interest manifested in inaugurating and sustaining, 
by his liberal contributions, a system of State Normal Institutes, 
which have revolutionized the public schools of Tennessee.

propriation for the good of our schools. :

“3. Resolved, That we, the public school-officers, in convention 
assembled, respectfully petition the next General. Assembly of 
Tennessee to make an annual appropriation of not less than 
$3,000 for the support of Normal Institutes of this State, and 
that we urge this the more earnestly in view of the fact that 
any sum given by the State will be doubled by an equal amount 
appropriated by the Peabody Trustces. 
“4, Resolved, That we ask the State Superintendent of Pubic 
Instruction to hold annually as many State Normal Institutes 
as the fund will justify in each grand division of the State or 
equal number, oue-third as many for colored teachers as for 
white. 
“5, Resolved, That we ask this body to appoint a competent 
committee, consisting of three members, to present this matter 
to the next General Assembly, to explain its importance and 
urge its passage. 
“Counry Instrrutzs.—A County Institute should be organ- 
jzed in each county, to continue at least two weeks. The Insti- 
tute shall be under the control of the teachers and public school- 
officers of the county. 
“The officers of this Institute shall be President, Vice- -presi- 
dent, Secretary, and Treasurer. 
“There shall be an Executive Committee, of which the Super- 
intendent shall be Chairman. : 
“The public school branches shall constitute the main work 
of the session—competent teachers being secured for the work. 
A programme shall be prepared and sent to each teacher at 
least one month before the session opens.

“We further ask the County Court to make an appropria- 
tion for the support of County Institutes. 
“District Instrrutes.—We recominend the following with 
‘regard to District Institutes: 
“1, That District Institutes be held in the various districts of 
each county. 
“2. That these Institutes be held monthly throughout the 
year.

: 
W. E. Thompson indorses the above resolutions with the ex- 
ception of the one in regard to the appropriation by the County 
Court. 
In reply to Superintendent Huffaker, Superintendent Wright 
stated that the report meant that Institutes should be organized 
and held in the various districts, the meetings changing each 
month from district to district. 
Superintendent Huffaker moved to amend the report by 
making ‘Friday and Saturday,” instead of “Saturday,” the 
- time of meeting of the Institutes. 
W.E, Thompson said it was not customary fora man to be 
paid to prepare himself for work. There should be no trouble 
about the teachers meeting the necessary expenses of attending 
these Institutes, and he could see no reason why there should. 
be appropriations made out of the public fund for the purpose 
of paying teachers to attend them. , He thought it deprived the 
teacher of his independence, and he would oppose that provis- 
ion of the report, though with that exception he had no objec- 
tion to offer.

Superintendent Nelson favored an appropriation from the 
county for the purpose indicated in the report. 
Professor Graybill said he did not understand the gentleman 
when he said that the State should not help a man to prepare 
for his work. “I think the State has the right,” said he, “to 
‘appropriate money for the training of its teachers, and I think 
any County Court could wisely expend $150 in that manner. 
We have passed a resolution to that grand Christian, J. L. M. 
Curry, one of the grandest, ablest, and best men in this country, 
for his sympathy with public school education. That man who 
has done so much for our country and nation, and who has 
represented us so ably at the court of Castile, made a remark 
like this to the Senate Committee ov Education: ‘If I had a 
million dollars to expend for the education of the youth of 
Virginia, I would expend $750,000 in the training of the teach- 
ers of Virginia.’ I think it is a legitimate and wise use of the 
money of a county to expend it in training teachers that they 
may be better servants for the county and the State.” 
Superintendent Burke moved, for the purposes of discussion, 
that the clause providing for appropriation for the training of 
teachers be striken from the report. 
Superintendent Ford stated that the appropriation was to 
pay an instructor or lecturer during the Normal. If Professor 
Huffaker should assist him in his Normal, he should wish to 
pay Mr. Huffaker. 
This statement was assented to by Superintendent Billingsley. 
Superintendent Ford continued by saying that he had,been 
paying a good price for instructors and good work had been 
the result. 
Superintendent Huffaker said that the teachers of his county 
were public servants, and were working for the accommodation 
of the public. “If we have the right to maintain a State Nor- 
_ mal College for the training of teachers, we have the right to 
-maintain a County Normal. If we abandon one we must aban- 
don the other.” In his county this appropriation came out of 
the county funds, and was the best appropriation that was 
made, and he was heartily in favor of the report. 
Superintendent Smith asked to have a word or two. “If 
some of you do not want your County Courts to make an ap-
-P-A-G-E-239
58 “ PROCEEDINGS OF THE 
  
propriation for this purpose, let those who do want it go before 
the County Courts and ask it.” [Applause.] 
Superintendent Nelson continued: “My friend says if the 
State Normal is right, the County Normal is right, and demands 
- it on those grounds. On the same grounds, if a State Asylum 
is right, we must have one in each county.” . 
Superintendent Ford: “We do not need them in East Ten- 
nessee.” . 
Superintendent Nelson: “If my friend is a sample, they 
ought to have two.” The speaker said he would protest against 
the proposed measure, because there was no law for the County 
Court to appropriate money for such a purpose out of the 
school-fund. It had never been done in his county. 
Superintendent Smith said he wanted to go on record on the 
other side of the question ; that all the law was had now that was 
needed. “The County Court,” he said, “elects the County Su- 
perintendent and fixes his salary, and the salary must be paid, 
if legally paid, out of the county funds. He is a county officer, 
and the County Court can make appropriations ” 
At this juneture Superintendent’ Nelson said that he had been 
under the impression that the report proposed to have the ap- 
propriation made from the school-fund, whereas the county 
funds were meant. He was in favor of that. 
Superintendent Burke withdrew his motion to strike out, and 
moved that the report of the committee be adopted. 
The motion was carried.   
‘Superintendent Foster, Chairman of the Committee on the 
Teachers’ Course at the University of Tennessee, submitted the 
report of his committee as follows, prefacing its introduction 
with the remark that it had, in the main, been prepared before. 
the establishment of such a course:

the demand. We, therefore, recommend that a regular teach- 
ers’ course be established at the University of Tennessee which 
will meet this want. : 
“As the greatest call is for teachers in the common schools, 
we suggest that they be first provided for by a course of one - 
year, which shall embrace the following work: 
“A rapid but thorough review of the common-school branches 
with reference to methods of teaching them, also grammatical 
criticism, composition, rhetoric, general history, physical geog- 
raphy, physiology, book-keeping, higher arithmetic, algebra, 
geometry, school-management, and the Tennessee law. To 
those completing the above course of study a certificate to 
teach in any of. the common schools of the State should be 
‘issued. 
_‘ We further recommend a second year’s course, to embrace 
the following: , 
« English literature, trigonometry, land surveying, elementary 
physics, botany, civil government, political economy, psychology, 
pedagogy, parliamentary law, public speaking, and debate. 
For the completion of this course a diploma entitling the 
possessor to teach in the high-schools of the State should be 
granted. . . 
“Furthermore, we recommend that for the Teachers’ Depart- 
ment the doors of the University be opened to male and female

“Pursuant to a call from our worthy State Superintendent, 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, about forty Superintendents and school- 
officers met at Nashville in December, 1887, and, at the close of 
a pleasant and profitable session, presided over by Capt. C. 8: 
Douglass, of Gallatin, the Public School-officers’ Association 
was permanently organized, Supt. W. M. Fuqua, of Davidson 
County, being elected President; Prof. Frank Goodman, Sec- 
retary; and David G. Ray, Nashville, Assistant Secretary. 
Since its organization the Association has met annually in 
Nashville, and the amount of good already accomplished thereby 
is incalculable. In 1888 Supt. W. N. Billingsley, of White. 
County, was elected President, and in 1889 Supt. A. H. Allen, 
of Bedford County, was honored in like manner. We recog- 
nize this organization as being one of the most important edu- 
cational factors in the State, and, if properly conducted in the 
future, we believe it will do even more for the upbuilding of com- 
mon school education in Tennessee than our time-honored State 
Teachers’ Association, of which we are all proud, can hope to 
do. In this body, County Superintendents from all portions of 
the State meet, relate their experience, compare methods, ad- 
vance ideas, and formulate plans for systematic work through- 
out the length and breadth of our commonwealth. The fol- 
lowing are a few of the important features introduced : 
“The adoption of a course of study and system of gradation 
to be used in all the counties, including a system of graduating 
pupils from the State schools. : 
“Systematizing the work of county supervision in exam- 
amining and licensing teachers, conducting Teachers’ Meetings, 
and thereby increasing the qualifications of teachers, and the 
efficiency of school-work generally. 
“We recommend that these meetings be continued, and that 
all Superintendents and school-officers be urged to attend and 
participate in the exercises.

Professor Graybill said: “Ido not’ know the usual proced- 
ure in our convention except from reading the minutes, but it 
seems to me that we might hesitate in some of our legislation, 
since we are putting the Association on record. As to how 
much weight these records carry Iam not sure. Is it the cus- 
tom of our body to meet together each year and pass a set of 
resolutions that go before the world in published form as the 
proceedings of our convention, and no more, or are these enact- 
ments official, semi-oflicial, or suggestive? While I shall not 
take a position on either side of the question, the resolution just 
passed at least puts us on record as having a different opinion 
from the faculty of the State University in the matter of the 
admission of ladies to the teachers’ course. I will not discuss 
that; but are these enactments official or semi-official? What 
is the purport of them? It seems to me that when we come 
together to discuss our Association and its work, we might de- 
fine the status of our organization and lay out our work for the 
future, and then your committees will be able to discuss and 
present these matters with greater intelligence.” Do I under- 
stand that this is a convention called officially by the State 
Superintendent, and that it is a convention of County Superin- 
tendents, in which the law is expounded and explained; and 
are the enactments brought about binding upon the County Su- 
perintendent as a part of the school law?” 
President Allen replied as follows: “TIT will say that the 
word ‘convention’ is misused; ‘association’ is the proper 
word. It is for the improvement of its members and the im- 
provement of the public school-system. Let Superintendent 
Smith give you an explanation.” 
State Superintendent Smith said: “The object of this Asso- 
ciation, primarily, is to call the public school-officers together 
for the purpose of discussing the duties belonging to those of- 
fices, and_ securing, if possible, a uniform method of discharg- 
ing those duties, so that we may improve the schools. The 
grand object is to improve the schools of the State; and I may 
say that the State Superintendent has regarded it as a part of 
his official duty to publish the proceedings of this convention 
out of the State fund. I have published annually ten thousand 
copies of the proceedings of this Association, and my action

has been approved by the Governor and other State officers, 
and by the General Assembly itself; and County Superintend- 
ents are urged to conform to the suggestions that are therein 
contained. That is about the extent of our official work; and, 
as this report says, I know that 1 can safely say that this Asso- 
ciation of Public School-officers has done more to render the 
schools of the State more efficient than any other agency in 
the State of Tennessee. This coming together of County Su- 
perintendents, and their discussion of methods presented to 
them, has broadened the views of each one who has participated 
in them, and in not a single instance have the recommendations. 
of this body failed to be utilized; and now, for instance, in 
almost every county in the State we have County Institutes 
organized and conducted according to the plan suggested by 
this body, and nearly all the schools of the State have been 
graded and have a uniform method of graduation of pupils. 
This graduation is the completion of the public school-course, 
when the pupils are awarded diplomas prepared at the State’s 
expense. Again, the examination and licensing of teachers has 
improved. You will find that, in many counties, the teachers 
are required to be prepared on the subjects which they would. 
teach, and we have, in consequence, a much better corps of teach- 
ers than we have ever had before. There has been an improve- 
ment all along the line. Many County Courts pay the expenses 
of their Superintendents while they are visiting the meetings of 
this Association. Some of the Superintendents have their ex- 
penses paid when they attend any convention of this kind in 
the State. If that action shall reach every county in the State, 
note what the result will be. If the County Courts over the 
State had paid the expenses of their Superintendents to this 
meeting,.the attendance would have been very much larger. 
Many are not here because they cannot pay the expense which 
would attend their coming. Our proceedings are suggestive. 
No. one is bound by law to carry them out, but the desire of 
those Superintendents who are well informed as to their duties 
js to conform to these.suggestions.” 
Professor Graybill said: “<I am very much obliged to Superin- 
tendent Smith for his explanation on this subject. The only . 
thing now surprising to me is that every County Superintend-

ent is not present. It seems to me that no County Superin- 
tendent can afford to.deny himself the privileges of such a 
meeting as this, especially when we are entertained at the State 
University.” 
Mrs. French said: “TI have understood that this was an asso- 
ciation of public school-officers where the talking is supposed 
to be done by public school officers. I have noticed that some 
others are taking part, but, not wishing to assume any right to 
which I am not entitled, I have not spoken.” : 
The Secretary stated that Mrs. French had the preceding 
day been invited to take the floor at pleasure. 
Mrs. French continued: ‘Then I will say than on behalf-of 
the women of Tennessee I thank the committee for recom- 
mending that women be admitted to the teachers’ course at the 
University of Tennessee. That does not mean that they con- 
trol the trustees. They may say that they shall not come, not-. 
withstanding; and, though the trustees may say ‘no,’ the in- 
_dorsement of this committee is something worth having. If 
there had been any discussion of that matter, I should. have 
been glad to say something, but I am pleased that it has been 
unnecessary for me to do so. I am glad to find that whén the 
women of Tennessee have asked for any thing they have gotten 
it.. But why should you wait for them to ask for it? I would 
ask the president of this University and the president of the 
Normal College and the State Superintendent to look into this 
* matter, and see if they cannot give to the women of the State 
of Tennessee something that they want and have not asked for. 
They do not like to have to ask you for fear that you will think 
they are not modest; and seldom can you find them willing to 
go before a body and claim any thing. Their humility is much 
admired by others, and I do not condemn it. At the same time, 
it seems to me that it should have its reward; and you should 
not wait too Jong for them to ask for what they want and 
should have.” 
Professor Jordan, of the State University, said: “I do not 
speak especially with reference to the University—the president 
not being on hand—but our position would be misunderstood 
if the impression were allowed to go out from here ‘that the 
_ faculty are opposed to the admission of women ‘to the teachers’

course. That is not the word we would like to use. We would 
take them with (stretching out his arms in a manner that elic- 
ited considerable laughter). So far‘as I am concerned, and I 
think I speak also for a majority of the members of the faculty, 
if we had the facilities, as I think we ought to have, there 
would be no objection to admitting the ladies. Certainly I 
should like to talk to them; but this is a right embarassing 
business, and I was surprised to see this resolution pass so read- 
ily. It might be well if the Association should couple its 
recommendation to admit ladies with the request that the Leg- 
islature take such steps as will make the thing feasible and 
practicable. We hope to have lecture-rooms of a better qual- 
ity, and the attendance of ladies would go a great way toward _ 
securing better equipment than we now have. If the proper 
facilities could be arranged, there ought to be some place where 
the ladies could have a boarding-hall of theirown. They could 
not board in town and come over here through all sorts of 
weather, and they could not have rooms here on the grounda. . 
The recommendation of the committee ought to be coupled 
with the request that the Legislature should do something—for 
_it has as yet done nothing for us—that will make the carrying 
out of such recommendations practicable.” 
Mrs. French: “TI asked yesterday, and ask again to-day, 
what facilities?” 
The President: “This discussion does not have reference to 
the report under consideration, and that question will probably 
come up again. At least the remarks are not in reference to — 
the question before the house.” 
- Professor Jordan: “I made mine as a personal privilege.” 
The report under consideration was adopted, and, on motion 
of Superintendent Ford, the action of the Association. in 
adopting the report of the Committee on the Teachers’ Course 
at the University was reconsidered in order that Mrs. French 
might have an opportunity to be heard. 
Mrs. French spoke as follows: 
“J read yesterday this clause: ‘Male teachers, holding certifi: 
cates from County or City Superintendents, or producing satis-

factory evidence that they have taught at least ten months 
acceptably in a private school, will be admitted to this depart- 
ment and receive free instruction. Having no suitable facilities 
for receiving or accommodating women, they cannot be ad- 
mitted.’ 
“Virst, we take up the question of a dormitory. The ladies 
would as soon stay over in the city as to board on the hill. The 
day scholars stay there, and so could the young ladies. It seems 
. tome that that question is answered. As to recitation-rooms, I 
do not know where you could find better in the State when your 
new buildings goup. We do not want such superior accommo- 
dations. Before you go away, visit the Female Institute and 
.see where I taught school five years, and where Miss Oliver is 
now teaching. When you see those rooms, you will see no 
necessity for having better for the women than you have at the 
University. You are rolling in the lap of luxury here, while 
there they are almost in pauperism. We come to this meet- 
ing and sit with you, and is there any reason why the. ladies 
should not come here and take their seats in the lecture-rooms 
with a hundred men on the grounds? Ido not see any objec- 
tion, and I am sure that many would avail themselves of the 
opportunity to do so. Every argument that you use here to 
further your views is an argument ten times as strong for the 
women. I do not know what you have in the country, bat in 
Knoxville nearly all the teachers are women. In Memphis, the 
State Superintendent tells me, they are all women, and in Chat- 
tanooga a majority are women; and if these things that are 
necessary for the young of Tennessee are intended for the males 
alone you should so emphasize it. As for accommodations for 
females in the University of Tennessee, I can say that you have 
them, except as to boarding facilities, and I do not care whether 
you have them or not. I do not believe in herding young peo- 
ple up in boarding-houses. If you can get them into families 
it will be better for the girls, and the boys as well.” . 
Professor Jordan said: “I wish to repeat what I said before, 
that the faculty are not opposed to this admission of women. ° 
. As you all see, this question covers a great deal of ground, and 
you can very readily understand that as soon as this question is 
answered with reference to the admission of women to the 
5—App.B.
-P-A-G-E-247
66 : PRrocBEDINGS OF THE 
  
teachers’ course, the question will come up with reference to the 
admission of ladies into ull the departments. . Neither are we 
opposed to that personally, but you understand that while this 
thing has been customary up North, this would be the first 
Southern school of the grade of a university to attempt the in- 
novation of admitting ladies. This is a serious question, and 
one which should not be settled off-hand, because it involves 
the whole matter of opening the University to both sexes. I 
do not know whether it would or not be wise or safe to do it, - 
but I am perfectly willing to try it. As for accommodations, I 
suppose Mrs. French has not been with us long enough to know 
all about that. Some of our recitation-rooms are so crowded 
that some of the boys have to sit in the windows. I have not 
a recitation-room large enough to accommodate a class that runs 
over twenty-five. I have one class that is divided into two see- 
tions now, and there are several divided into three or four see- 
tions, and then it becomes necessary to go over the subject three 
or four times; but we are now making arrangements that will 
give us better facilities. Personally the faculty are not espe- 
cially concerned, and are willing to conform as nearly as possi-, 
ble,to any recommendation you may make. In fact, we are 
_ here to do what we are told, and we are willing to do as nearly 
-as we can what this Association may recommend. So far from 
being opposed to the admission of women, I should like to see 
the experiment made; and because I want to see it made, I want 
to be careful how it is made. Let us not start the thing under 
circumstances that will render it a failure. If we wish to make 
@ success of it-we must start it under favorable circumstances. 
If we are going to go off before we are prepared, we will do 
the whole thing, in public sentiment and practical workings, 
more harm than good.” 
Superintendent Ford said: “In the public schools of this 
county we have about sixty lady teachers, and I am prophesy- 
ing that in ten years from to-day the public schools of Knox 
County will be -taught largely by the young ladies of the 
county. I base that prediction upon the fact that ten years ago 
there were only three or four lady teachers in the public schools 
in the county. I appreciate what Professor Jordan has said, . 
and I believe that if the lady teachers of Knox County can be     
 
-P-A-G-E-248

admitted to the teachers’ course at this University, great good 
to the public schools of the county will result.” 
Prof. T. C. Karns, of the University of Tennessee, said: “I 
wish to add something about the schools. Professor Jordan 
has probably not considered the number of schools in the South 
where women are admitted with the men. The University of 
Texas is one, the University of Kentucky another, and I learn 
that the University of Arkansas is traveling along the same 
line. The Normal College at Nashville and a number of our 
smaller colleges in Hast Tennessee do so. A few years ago 
there was a great prejudice against this movement, but since it 
has been tried, people like the change; and, réally, I think the 
opposition to the change is an old idea that we have not gotten 
out of. If a change is made, there will be no trouble whatever. 
‘Young ladies came here to the summer Norma! and spent a 
month. Both sexes were here and no trouble resulted. In the 
West and North-west all these institutions, almost without ex- 
ception, are open to both sexes. Nearly all the schools in Ili- 
nois, Iowa, and Kansas are so, and there is no trouble.” 
Chancellor W. H. Payne spoke as follows: . “ Whenever 
there is something weighing upon my mind I wish to say a 
word or two. I am very glad indeed, in _the first place, that 
this important step has been taken by the University of Ten- 
nessee. No teacher in the State should fail to avail himself of 
the course here. It will go far to elevate the grade of the 
teaching profession. The simple fact that the University of 
Tennessee has a higher department for giving instruction in 
teaching will cause the teacher to look up and have a feeling 
of self-respect. They would see that the highest institution in 
the State has recognized teaching as a profession, like medicine 
and law. Even though no teacher in the State would avail 
himself of the course, the creation of this department would 
have its beneficial effect. I subseribe to the movement with all 
my heart, and wish it only success. With reference to the ad- 
mission of women, I hope my friends of the University of Ten- 
nessee will pardon me if I say that you are a little tender-footed 
on that subject. I had some experience in a high-grade institu- 
tion a few years ago, when it was proposed to admit women on 
the same conditions as young men. It was thought to be an
-P-A-G-E-249
    
68 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 
  
innovation which would bring down the roof of the institution. 
One of the distinguished professors had two daughters, and he 
left for Chicago, leaving the University to its fate, and believing 
that it would soon collapse. It has not collapsed, but has grown 
more prosperous. So far as accommodations here are con- 
cerned, Mrs. French is right. She asks for no extraordinary 
accommodations. Give her a chair in the lecture-room, and if 
necessary, every boy will give up his seat and take another in 
the window. This is a State institution for the citizens of the 
State. When this question was raised in the University of 
Michigan, the supporters of the movement took the ground 
that the institution was built by the State for the benefit of the 
citizens of the State. Then, how does it happen that young 
women have not the same rights there that young men have? 
On that basis young women were admitted. You will find there 
the most courteous young men. The admission of both sexes 
will make the young men more courteous and manly and the 
young women more womanly. If you wish to find the highest 
type of the student, go where young men and young women 
are found in the same school-room. It will benefit both. The 
moment you admit women into this University these reforms 
which you need will come up. Admit the women and treat 
them with judicial fairness, and it will be best for all concerned. 
You will be helped by it. Mrs. French is right in saying that 
the same accommodations will suffice for young women as for 
young men. As to lodging, many of them would walk a mile; 
but let them take care of that.” 
Supt. J. C. Ford offered the following resolution, which was 
added .as a part of the committee’s report on the teachers’. 
course at the University of Tennessee: 
“Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed to confer 
with the proper authorities as to the practicability of admitting 
women to the teachers’ course upon same conditions as men. 
“Resolved further, That Dr. Charles W. Dabney and Supt. F.

see, and the other three to be appointed from the membership 
of this Association.”

Superintendent Ruth, Chairman of the Committee on City 
Schools, submitted the report of his committee, as follows: 
“The subject—‘ City Schools’—is one of so wide a scope, 
and so extensive a compass, that I can only briéfly touch upon 
some of its most important points. . 
' “By ‘City Schools’ is meant schools maintained in towns or 
cities whose population is 8,000 or upwards. In many essen- 
tials they differ from urban and rural schools. The social 
conditions and surroundings are different. In the country we 
find neither the extremes of wealth nor poverty that meet one 
on every hand within the crowded streets of a large town or 
great city. In the city the financial resources, the very basis of 
the maintenance.of free schools, is a surer and more certain fac- 
tor. In the large towns and cities schools may be maintained 
for ten months, while in the rural districts five and even four 
months is the average limit of the school-year. Pupils in city 
schools look forward to industrial or commercial pursuits, or to 
_. higher education in the colleges of the land, as the goal of the
-P-A-G-E-251
70 : ProckEeDINGs OF THE 
  
public school-race; while the pupils of the country must, per- 
force, consider their training as designed to fit them to become 
intelligent and successful tillers of the soil—often a far more 
independent and useful occupation than many that boast a 
higher-sounding name and origin. A city system of schools is 
in the strictest sense of the term a graded system; that of the 
country is so only by exception. In a graded system, a teacher 
is required to instruct pupils of nearly the same age and ad- 
vancement; the system of the country schools requires the in- 
struction by the same teacher of many pupils, representing 
different ages and grades of advancement. Of necessity, such 
work is difficult, and the results not entirely satisfactory. The 
graded system costs more than the ungraded, but the outlay is 
more than compensated for by the thorough and substantial 
character of the work done. A more convincing proof of this 
+ cannot be found than in the fact that country schools are endeav- 
oring, as rapidly as possible, to adapt their course of instruction 
and their teaching force to the maintenance of a graded system: 
“Our State Superintendent, Frank M. Smith, has truly said: 
‘Better supervision can be had by having three men to super- 
vise an entire district, and graded schools can be established 
where two or three hundred children can be assigned to one 
house, and several teachers employed in the same school-build- 
ing, and thus better work in every respect will be insured.’ 
“City schools, of necessity, can command a higher grade of 
teaching talent, and this being constantly under the direct 
charge of a Superintendent, the results will be more satisfac- 
tory than when, as in the rural districts, the Superintendent 
must necessarily make only infrequent visits of inspection of 
the various schools under his charge. 
. “ Qity schools are controlled and managed by boards of educa- 
tion, whose duty it is to see that every individual connected 
with the same, in his vocation and office, shall so faithfully and 
thoroughly discharge his whole duty that the schools will be 
increased in efficiency and fruitful in good work. In Prussia 
they say, ‘As is the teacher, so is the school;’ in Holland; ‘As 
your inspection is, so is your school.’ In the latter saying | 
there is adepth of meaning. Upon good school-boards and care- « 
ful and intelligent inspection largely depends the welfare of:a
-P-A-G-E-252
ConventTIon oF Pusuire ScHoon OFFICERS. 71 
  
city’s public schools. Let them and it be what they should, 
and, unless circumstances be very unfavorable, your schools will 
be good. The casual visitor, or even the educated man, cannot 
always detect the defects or shortcomings in discipline and in- 
struction that he can whose training has been for years in the 
peculiar work of inspection. .Much depends upon the school- 
board, and the manner in which the members of it discharge 
their duty to the schools. 
“There is a great difference in different cities in the number 
that constitute a board, and the manner of their election. From 
the Boston board of 1876, which numbered 116, they grade all 
‘the way down to that of Denver, Qol., which numbers only six, 
and to. those which, like the board of this city, numbers only 
five. Boards composed of so many are unwieldy, and are less 
capable of satisfactory work than those whose numbers are 
small. Then, too, when boards are so large, polities with its 
baneful and corrupting influences, is apt to creep in, and, by its 
presence, defile that which ought to be free from its con- 
taminating interference. In New York the members of the 
school-board are appointed by the Mayor; in Philadelphia, by 
judges of a superior court; in Chicago, by the city council, 
etc. The latter method seems to be preferable, as under ordi- 
nary circumstances men will thus be chosen who will be char- 
acterizd by ability for the work and devotion to the interests of 
the schools. , 
“Under the direction of the board, as an executive officer, 
is the Superintendent. To him is committed the supervision of 
the instruction, discipline, and general management of the 
schools, In small cities his work is more laborious than in 
large ones. In the former, the Superintendent is man-of-all- 
work. He must not only supervise, inspect, and examine the | 
schools, but he must do a work which, in large cities, is per- 
formed by persons specially appointed for that work. Time that 
ought to be devoted by him to things petaining to instruction, 
discipline, and school-management must be devoted to work the 
performance of which does not require an educational expert. 
There is, too, a great difference in different cities as to. the 
power and authority of such an officer. In some, the Superin- 
tendent concerns himself with instruction and school-manage-
-P-A-G-E-253
72 , PRocHEDINGS OF THE 
  
ment only; in others he is practically intrusted with the entire 
administration—a work which, in other places, is performed by 
the board, or by subcommittees of the same. : 
“The office of Superintendent of Schools in this country is 
not old; it dates back to 1840. The first Superintendent was 
the one who had charge of the schools of Providence, R. I. 
Before this—as it is now in some cities which are behind the 
times—the work of supervising and directing was performed 
by the members of the school-board. But now no city of any 
size is without its Superintendent of Schools. Philadel- 
phia tried to conduct her schools without a Superintendent, but 
was finally compelled to secyre one, and called to that position 
Superintendent McAlister, who has lately resigned to accept a 
position as president of a college at $10,000 a year. 
“Towns and cities everywhere are recognizing the fact that 
it is cheaper to pay for supervision than to be without it, and 
better to pay well for good supervision than poorly for ineffi- 
cient supervision ; and to-day the immense superiority of city 
instruction over country instruction is due to the institution of 
careful and frequent supervision. 
“Of course boards of education ought to be careful whom 
they choose for such a position. Fifty years ago the Dutch 
common schools were the best in Europe; and Cousin, in stat- 
ing that all authorities agree in attributing this superiority 
to the exceptional excellency of the supervision, relates that 
Van der Eude, who had been the chief administrator of the 
system for twenty-seven years, said to him: ‘Take care how 
you choose your inspectors; they are men, whom, Diogenese- 
like, you ought to look for with lanterns in your hands.’ 
“Matthew Arnold, that noblest of noble teachers, said: ‘The 
primary inspectors of France are the very life of its educational 
system ; their inspection is a reality.’ 
“What is greatly needed to-day is a supply of supervising 
agents who have been fitted by special training for the work of 
supervision. Such universities as Johns Hopkins, Ann Arbor, 
and other. institutions of superior instruction, have already: 
taken a step in the right direction by establishing chairs of. 
pedagogy for instruction in the philosophy and science of edu-. 
cation; and this university, determined, by the active exertions

of its wide-awake president, to be behind in nothing that is 
praiseworthy and useful, has lately called to a similar position 
“ in its faculty one who is in every respect well qualified to do the 
work assigned him, and to advance the cause of education 
throughout our State. 
“Tn speaking of supervision, I would refer to the charge so 
often made that city schools have too much‘ red tape;’ ‘that the 
supervision magnifies the importance of the mechanical and 
routine operations of the schools; that its perpetual examina- 
tions are only contrivances for facilitating and enforcing cram; 
that it ignores the pupil per se, aud treats him as part of a 
mass,’ etc. Now, while there may be some ground for such a 
charge, as no human institutions are, or can be, perfect, yet, in 
many cases, it is somewhat unjust to raise this outcry against 
what is nothing more than a means to an end, a perfecting the 
organization to secure good results; for good schools mean 
good organization, or ‘red tape,’ if one will call it such. 
“Not only upon efficient supervision, but upon good teachers, 
depends the thoroughness of the work of city schools. The 
course of study may be all that can be desired, the supervision 
perfect, but unless the teaching element be good, poor results may 
be expected. Of course, one must admit that it is a very diffi- 
cult matter to select a corps of several hundred or even one hun- 
dred teachers and make no mistake in the selection. But when 
in any school teachers are found incapable and inefficient, no 
board should retain such to the injury and detriment of the 
schools. What is needed here to-day in our State is the estab- 
lishment of more normal schools—more training schools. 
There is no denying the fact that meu and women cannot teach 
without special training for the work. Teaching is a science, 
and, as such, it necessitates instruction to fit one for the work, 
In connection with all the public schools of the State, in towns 
and cities, there should be a normal school. Such a school 
would cost something, but would not the benefit obtained by 
placing the instruction of the young in trained hands more 
than compensate for the ecst? 
“Throughout the North and West it is rare that you find a 
. town of any size without its normal schoo! or normal training 
class. It is an important factor in the school-system. The
-P-A-G-E-255
74 ProceEpINes OF THE 
  
Superintendent of Belleville, Il, speaking of his supply: of, 
teachers, says: ‘Not only natural aptitude for teaching, but 
also extensive scholarship, are necessary equipments for the ~ 
teacher who would be successful in his calling. Some of the 
young ladies who graduate from our schools have succeeded 
well as teachers, yet it is very desirable that, after graduating, 
they should acquire greater maturity of judgment, and that 
they should pursue.their studies for several years at some State 
normal school. Young ladies who have thus prepared them- 
selves for their work should be selected in preference to those 
who have neglected this preparation.’ 
“<The Harvard Annex,’ the popular name for the society for 
the collegiate instruction of women, established at Harvard 
College, includes among its students a large number—by far 
the larger portion of them—who are preparing for the teach- 
ing profession. ‘The evidences are abundant,’ says the presi- 
dent, ‘that. their opportunities for remunerative employment, 
their actual power as teachers, and consequent satisfaction in 
the work, are greatly increased by the training.’ 
“Institutes have done much good for the teachers of Tennes- 
see. Held as they have been in nearly all the counties of the 
State, and attended by over 5,000, their influence for good in 
the aggregate during the past year must surely be felt; for no 
teacher.can attend even a gathering of this kind, which lays no 
claim to being an institute in any sense of the term, and not go 
away without inspiration for his work, and a determination to 
do all he can to raise the standard of teaching in his county. 
' “Tnstitutes are good in their way, and should be encouraged, 
but never can, and never were designed, to take the Place of 
normal sehools. ‘ 
“Tn every well-regulated school there must be something to 
mark, the succession or order of the several studies, to assign 
each class its time, etc. This we call a programme. ‘The im- 
portance of a carefully-prepared programme, and a strict ad-.: 
herence to the. same, cannot be overestimated. No study or 
recitation should be allowed to encroach upon the time of an-: 
other. A teacher who, with a programme before him, design- 
.edly or unintentionally neglects it, does. an injury to his pupils 
by teaching them that it isa small matter whether he keeps or” .

breaks a rule, and can in this, as in other things, teach’ them.’ : 
that a rule or instruction—and what is a programme: buti-a 
written instruction ?—is more honored in the breach than.in'the.. 
observance. : 
“City schools do not have to contend so much as do. the 
schools of the rural districts with an evil that effects them both 
alike. Lrefer to the matter of attendance, or rather non-attend- 
ance. In all our cities stringent regulations in regard to tardi- 
ness and absence prevail, and the percentage of attendance 
compared with enrollment is very high. In the country greater 
irregularity is unavoidable, but it is believed that if boards of 
district trustees would adopt, with the advice and counsel of 
the school Superintendents, regulations on the subject, wisely. 
adapted to the different conditions of country schools, they - 
would be productive of good results. Regular attendance is of 
paramount importance, and every influence—social, moral, and 
compulsory—should be brought to bear, that the children of 
the State should not only be brought to school but kept there 
as long as necessary for them to obtain at least the rudiments 
of an education. In this town to-day, and in every town of any 
size, and in the country, too, there are those who never attend 
the public schools, or if they do, the attendance is only for a 
short time. ‘The greater number who do not avail themselves. 
of the opportunity offered by the free schools are the children 
of poor and ignorant parents, who will be allowed to grow up 
in ignorance; and generation after generation will do the same, 
unless the law forces them into school; until the one generation 
is educated, then the greatest difficulty will be overcome. If 
parents are remiss in their duties to their children, and not 
aware of the great responsibility resting upon them, they should 
be made sensible, and should be compelled to discharge a parent’s 
duty.’ If such States as New York, Maine, Vermont, New 
Jersey, and others feel the necessity of a compulsory education ~ 
law, surely Tennessee ought to, and every friend of popular 
education in our State should use his influence to speed the en- 
actment of such alaw. The-sentiment in favor of compulsory 
attendance of all pupils upon either the public or private 
‘schools is becoming stronger each year, and in those States 
above named a compulsory education law has been in force for 
     
-P-A-G-E-257
76 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 
years, and the argument in favor of it are more potent than 
those against it. 
“ School-officers in those States in which compulsory attend- 
ance laws are enforced, encounter difficulties, it is true, in the 
discharge of their duties. The law brings into the school-room 
those whose surroundings at home are not such as to encourage 
pupils to submit to restraint and authority. To manage such 
children is one of the most difficult questions with which school- 
men have to deal. Such pupils ought not to be excluded from’ 
school, they ought not to be put into reformatories, for associa- 
tion with vicious characters can only prove detrimental to them. 
“The most satisfactory solution of the difficulty has been 
found in the establishment of what are called truant schools. 
Into these are gathered the habitual truant, the mischievous 
and ungovernable boy, the newsboy and the boot-black. 
“ Wherever these schools have been tried, they have been emi- 
nently successful. Listen to some of the evidences of this 
success. One Superintendent says: ‘The good effects of the 
truant school established by the board were immediately ap- 
parent. Habitual truants and the incorrigible were speedily 
gathered into this school, and punishment and suspension ceased 
elsewhere. The good influence of this school was not only felt, 
but it became tangible in reports.’ Another says: ‘There can 
be no question as to the wisdom of the board in establishing ‘ 
this school—the truant school—nor as to its restraining and re- 
forming power overall the schools of the city.’ Still another 
says: ‘As much less complaint of truancy has reached me than 
in former years, it would seem probable that the existence of 
the truant school has exercised a salutary influence, and though 
truancy is by no means obsolete in this town, I have no hesi- 
tation in saying that the school is of great value in restraining 
it, and trust that the institution may be kept up.’ And similar 
testimony to the sauccess.of such schools can be obtained from. 
every place where they have been tried. 
“The public schools of Knoxville have, for the first time, tried 
this year the experiment of having such a school. We call ita 
special school. Though in operation only four months, its good 
effects are apparent everywhere throughout the schools. The 
number of cases of truancy has decreased, and where before —

there were continual suspensions for absences, and for miscon- 
duct, now a suspension is a rare thing. At first, parents were — 
opposed to such a school, but when they found that the authori- 
ties, by its establishment, sought only the good of their children 
_ and the welfare of the schools, that opposition ceased; for it 
is wrong to keep in the same room with obedient and well- 
trained children those whose example is vicious and contami- 
nating. The school needs but one thing to make it successful, 
and that is the power to bring to and keep there such as are 
habitual truants. As there is no compulsory education law, the 
city of Knoxville has no right to appoint a truant officer, who 
ean and should render the schools much assistance, and heuce 
- the worst cases of truancy cannot as yet be reached. . 
“The question of examinations and promotions is one that in 
a measure is still unsettled. From time to time it comes to the 
surface and agitates the minds of educators. No one denies the 
fact that there must be some way in which pupils shall be pro- 
moted, but how to promote without doing injustice to any one 
is the question to be settled. Promotions may be made upon 
the daily recitations, a record being kept of the grades of the 
same. They may be made, as they are in many schools, upon 
the quarterly final examinations; or, they may be made upon 
the judgment of the teacher. ; 
“The first of these methods is objectionable in graded sehools, 
as it takes from the efficiency of the work to require a teacher 
to grade large classes. In our own schools we do thus grade, 
put only in the high-school, as there, the standard for promotion 
being ten per cent. higher than in other schools, pupils are un- 
able to obtain promotion on their examinations alone, as it re- 
quires a very good student to make an average of seventy per 
cent. on a written examination alone. 
“The second method, while less objectionable than the first, 
is, nevertheless, open to objection, as it is, to some extent, an 
additional labor imposed upon both teachers and pupils. If 
pupils, in the judgment of the teacher-who ought to know 
best—are qualified, by their standing and good work during the 
year, to do the work of the higher grade, there should be no 
objection to the promotion, without examination, of such 
pupils.
-P-A-G-E-259

“The third’ method is open to objection, because it affords a 
ground for the charge of prejudice, etc., on the part of teachers. 
There are some teachers who are always more intent on seeking 
to tind excuses for the failure of their pupils than earnest and 
diligent in their efforts to excite their interest, inspire them 
with enthusiasm, assist them in their difficulties, and encourage 
them to overcome all obstacles in their way. Such teachers 
would promote blindly and indiscriminately. On the other 
hand, some teachers are so critical and exacting as to be satis- 
fied with nothing short of absolute perfection. Wery few of 
their class would attain, in their judgment, the standard 
prescribed fur promotion. The anomaly would be presented 
that those remaining unpromoted by them would be really bet- . ’ 
ter scholars than those promoted by’ the less thorough and less 
conscientious class of teachers. This would be fatal to all sys- 
tem and uniformity in promotion. oO 
“Another objection to this plan of promotion, is that it 
throws altogether too great a responsibility upon the teacher. 
If all parents were sensible, just, and generous, the force of this 
objection would be greatly weakened. From this it will be ap- 
parent that if this question were to be decided by the teacher 
alone, and if the boy were not promoted, no matter how poor his 
scholarship, nothing could convince the parents that this was 
not owing to the prejudice and hostility of the teacher. 
“In the schools of this place we have sought to avoid, as 
far as possible, all the objections urged against these three meth- 
ods of promotion by adopting a plan which has, so far, worked 
admirably well. No-serious objection has been made to it. It 
has given general satisfaction, and those who have been pro- 
‘moted in accordance with it have shown that no mistake has 
been made in the matter of their promotion. 
“The plan is this:. Teachers were instructed, early in the 
year, to announce to their pupils that all those whose scholar- 
ship, as determined by the three quarterly examinations, was 
good, and whose attendance'during the year had been regular, 
would, upon the recommendation of the teacher and: of the 
principal of. the building, be promoted without examination; 
the rest would be obliged to undergo the final examination. « 
This avoided placing upon the teacher the onerous and unjust —

responsibility of deciding alone the question of the pupil’s pro- 
motion, and removed as far as possible from the parent the op- 
portunity of making, in the case of all those not.so promoted, 
the charge of prejudice or unfair dealing on the part of the — 
officials of the schools. 
“There are many things that I would like to speak of in ‘this 
paper—as, discipline, hygiene, libraries, moral training, text-." 
books, school-age, construction of school-houses, physical cult- 
ure—but as my time for preparing this paper has been very | 
limited, I will, in conclusion, speak of but one more topic that 
properly belongs to my subject, and that is high-schools, 
“Tn all large towns and cities the high-school forms an im- 
portant part of the public school-system. It reflects, so to 
speak, the glory and honor of the faithful work of the primary, 
the intermediate, and the grammar, school. For years the op- 
ponents of liberal provision for public instruction have made 
. assaults upon them. Every effort has been made to discourage 
their continuance. Notwithstanding, they have everywhere 
maintained their ground, and have shown no check in their 
growth and development. A celebrated French educator, speak- 
ing of our system of schools, says: ‘So far as social equality 
can be attained here below, it is attained in the American high- 
school. ‘There all is done that can be done to push as far and 
as high as possible that common instruction which obliterates 
the distinction between the rich and the poor.’ In our smaller 
‘cities the provision for high-school instruction is relatively more 
ample than in the largest and most wealthy cities, and a greater 
percentage of the population is receiving higher education in 
the public school. Albany, Cleveland, O., and Pittsburg are far 
ahead of New York, Philadelphia, and Brooklyn in this respect. 
“But it is a noticeable fact that the number of girls in our 
high-schools is in general quite in excess of the number of boys, 
and that the number of girls who graduate is in still greater 
excess of the number of boys who graduate. 
“The president of this University, some few weeks ago, in a 
‘communication of his published in one of our daily papers, has 
so admirably presented this point, and has shown so conclusively 
_ that something i is wrong somewhere, that I quote his communi- 
eation:

“¢ We are justly proud of our Knoxville schools, both public 
and private. Our public schools are excellently managed, and 
are as good, in most respects, as can be found in any city in the 
South of equal size and wealth. Knoxville people are especially 
proud of their high-school, which is commonly called the “Girls” 
High-school,” on account, I suppose, of the small number of boys 
who attend. Our private academies, both for girls and boys, 
enjoy an excellent reputation, and are certainly as numerous a8 
the attendance on them will justify. The establishment of 
several new private schools, and the success of those alréady in 
existence, is the one encouraging point in the situation which 
we are about to discuss. 
“*The comparatively small number of young men who.are 
prepared to enter college classes, and the startling rarity of the 
boy in the higher grades of the public schools, have attracted 
my attention to this question: What are the people of Knox- — 
ville actually doing to give their boys a good education? I. 
have sought an answer by making a careful study of school-re- 
ports and taking a thorough census of the private schools of 
Knoxville and vicinity. The results obtained are so striking 
that I conceive it my duty to lay them before our people, and 
especially the parents of our boys. I will simply submit the 
facts now, in as brief a form as possible, leaving all comments 
for the future, or for others. 
“*& few explanations and definitions are necessary. The 
question to which we have tried to secure an answer is better 
stated in this form: What was done during the last school- 
session to give our boys “a good education?” By “a good 
education’? we mean something more than the mere rudiments 
or “ three k’s,” a little reading, less writing, and least arithmetic, 
which, as insignificant as they are, still avail to lift a man up 
out of the oblivion of illiteracy. Our census, although we did ~ 
not make a special object of ascertaining this, shows that only 
about. one-half of our boys are getting any systematic education. 
whatever. Surely we cannot count this “ little learning,” which 
a boy gets in a hap-hazard sort of way, as an education inthe — 
true sense of the word. How shall we define “a good educa- 
tion” for our present purpose? Up to the end of the é 
grade of the common schools a child gets little above the. r 
       
  
-P-A-G-E-262

ments referred to. Let us count all the work above the sixth 
grade of the common schools, and the corresponding work of 
the private schools, as a contribution towards “a good educa- 
tion,” and enumerate every boy who last year received in- 
struction either in publie or private schools above this grade. 
The question then is, How many boys received instruction last 
year in the grades above the sixth, in the various public schools 
of Knoxville, North Knoxville, and West Knoxville? and how 
many received corresponding instruction in the private high- 
schools or colleges, either at home or abroad? I have given 
myself great concern to ascertain as accurately as possible how 
many boys we have in our city and suburbs between the ages — 
of fourteen and twenty-one, these ages limiting the period that 
they should spend in high-schools and colleges. An estimate 
based upon the actual enumeration of children reported by the 
Superintendents of schools, gives me a total of 945 boys, in 
Knoxville and its tributary towns, who should attend school, 
and I shall use this figure further on. This enumeration docs 
uot include, however, a number of districts that really belong 
to our city, and it is certainly too low. A calculation based 
upon a total population of 40,000, and using a well-known 
factor to determine the number of boys between these ages, calls 
for several thousand boys. Every one, I am sure, will agree 
with me that we must have in this population at least three or 
four thousand boys between these ages. 
“«¢Tiet me submit a few simple facts before I give the results. 
Professor Ruth informs me that only forty-one boys entered all 
of the grades above the sixth last year in the Knoxville city 
schools, and that only twenty-one remained in school till June. 
These were rather young, averaging only fifteen years and six 
“ months. They were probably allowed to remain in school be- 
cause they were young and brighter than the average for their 
age. The average attendance of boys on the high-school grades 
of the Knoxville city schools was only thirty-one. Professor - 
Rath estimates that he ought to have at least five hundred. 
“«In the North Knoxville schools there were last year only. 
" six boys in the seventh and three in the eighth grade. In the 
West Knoxville schools only fourteen boys entered the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth grades during the year. There were twice as 
6—App.B.
-P-A-G-E-263
82 PRocBEDINGS OF THE 
  
many girls as boys. A large and popular private school for 
boys in the city had, last year, only six boys receiving instruc- 
tion above the sixth grade. 
“<T hasten from these discouraging details to state poorer re- 
sults. We give below the total number of boys who entered 
school and did, during last session, any work whatever, that by 
liberal construction, could be classed as above the sixth grade 
of the common schools: 
“<«TIn Knoxville public schools there were entered 41; in North 
Knoxville public schools there were entered 9; in West Knox- 
ville public schools there were entered 14; in private high- 
schools and academies there were 14; sent off to high-schools | 
and colleges, 21; attended the University of Tennessee from 
Knoxville, 66. Total entered, 165. The average attendance 
was probably not over 120. 
«“¢The school-enumeration for these towns calls for the fol- 
lowing number of boys between fourteen and twenty-one: 
Knoxville, 700; North Knoxville, 110; West Knoxville, 135. 
Total, 945. 
“As explained above, this does not count many districts that 
- should be tributary to Knoxville schools, and this figure must 
be, at least, trebled to come anywhere near the estimates based, 
upon the census. 
“¢Tn conclusion, our investigation shows that, counting every 
boy who entered any of these schools, we are giving only about 
sixteen per cent. of the actual school-enumeration, or, more ac- 
curately, about five and one-third per‘cent. of all our boys in 
Knoxville and vicinity, any chance whatever to get “a good 
education.” : 
“<Do not these facts challenge the attention of all our think- 
ing people, rich or poor, educated or uneducated? Taking. all 
our boys between six and twenty-one into consideration, the,in- 
vestigation, shows that over fifty per cent. of our boys are grow- 
ing up.in.absolute ignorance; forty-five per cent. are getting, in 
one way or another, a very little education in the elementary 
branches, while about five per cent. are making an effort to get 
something better than is given in the grammar schools. .I beg. : 
you to think about this, good people of Knoxville.’ Lone 
“ But this state of things, which Dr. Dabney has so ably ex: 
      
-P-A-G-E-264
Convention oF Pusric Scroot OFFIcERs. 83 
  
posed, is true, not of Knoxville alone; it is true of all the cities 
and towns—yes, and of the country districts, too, throughout 
the length and breadth of this land. 
“In the first place, there is an opposition to high-schools. 
Many people do not favor an education beyond the grammar 
schools. They claim it is time wasted; that it unfits boys for 
business, etc. But this is taking a very narrow view of the -’ 
whole question. ‘A bright young fellow recently asked: 
“ What good will it ever do me to study algebra?” ‘He was 
measuring,’ says the relater of the circumstance, ‘the value of 
knowledge by the little tape-measure whose divisions are the 
symbol for the dollar.’ It was explained to him that the good 
consisted in the mental advancement accruing from disciplining 
the mind to systematic reasoning; that while he might never 
use what he learned in the exact form in which he learned it, 
and while he might apparently forget it, yet the effect of his 
study would remain through life in the ability to think better 
and to grapple more successfully with difficult questions. This 
thought was recently put neatly by one who said that while 
he could not now recollect what particular food he ate for din- 
ner a month ago, yet that food went toward building up the 
wasted physical tissues; and so, while he could not now remem- 
ber the formulas and principles of the higher mathematics: 
which he had studied in college years ago, yet those formulas 
and principles helped to build up his mind, and make him intel- 
lectually the man he had become. 
“Then, too, boys are too anxious, perhaps, to take a short 
cut to active business life. The average boy who has been kept 
in the grammar school until fifteen years of age, looks upon 
the three or four years’ high-school course, which would carry 
him up to nineteen years of age, as too long for his purpose; 
and perhaps he is right. If such is the case, then the high- 
school course should be modified so as to suit his particular 
case. 
“But I am convinced that the chief cause of so small an at- 
tendance by boys upon our high-school is the desire to go into 
active business life—some from choice, many from necessity. 
“Good city schools are a blessing to any community. «Not 
only do they tend to increase the sum-total of the intelligent

character of the places in which they exist, but their influence 
extends far beyond their borders. As good and well-kept farms, 
though few in number, tend to improve the farming interests of 
a district, and to increase the efforts to have better and more 
profitable farms, so good city schools, managed and conducted 
by competent, painstaking, and conscientious teachers, are a 
constant object-lesson, the effect of which is to raise not only 
the standard of education in their own locality, but to improve 
that of all the region; contiguous thereto.” 
On motion of Superintendent J. C. Ford, the following was 
stricken from the report on city schools: 
«Pupils in-city schools look forward to industrial or com- 
mercial pursuits, or to higher education in the colleges of the 
land, as the goal of their public school-race; while the pupil of 
the county must, perforce, consider their training as designed 
to fit them to become intelligent and successful tillers of the 
soil—often a far more independent and useful occupation than 
many that boast a higher-sounding name and origin.” 
. Superintendent Ford, in discussing the point referred to in 
his resolution, said he wished it stricken out because he did not 
believe it was true. “I do not think the efficiency of our 
country schoéls extends only to that grade which fits their 
pupils for tilling the soil. I believe the young men and young 
women who take the public school course in those schools are 
fitted to follow any ordinary commercial course, and are able to 
get a long very well in business in life. 
“Most of our business men come from the country. Our 
legal and medical men were not educated in the city, but in the 
country, and I believe we ought to strike that clause out, for it 
has a tendency to pinch us country people.” - [Applause.] 
Dr. Dabney, Chairman, read the report of the Committee on 
the County High-school as the connecting link’ between the 4 
common schools and the colleges. It was as follows:

“Your Committee on County High-schools respectfully sub- 
mit the following as the basis of an address to the next General 
Assembly of Tennessee upon this subject. Deemingfit very 
important that the subject should be presented in a form that 
will adapt itself easily to our present school-system, and present 
the fewest difficulties to the law-maker, we hope that this paper 
will be fully discussed, and so amended, if need be, as to insure 
the passage of an act for the trial of the plan. To this end, we 
suggest that a committee be appointed to present this address, 
as agreed on, to the General Assembly: 
“To the Honorable the General Assembly of Tennessee: . 
“ GEnTLEMEN— We, the members of the Public School-officers’ 
Association of Tennessee, in convention assembled, at the Uni- 
versity of Tennessee, on the ninth to eleventh of December, 
1890, do most respectfully petition your honorable body to pass at 
your next session an act to empower the counties to establish and 
maintain high-schools, where the children of the rural districts 
may receive opportunities for advanced education, such as is 
already provided for the children in our towns. 
“Tn order to convey our wishes and opinions in better form, 
we respectfully submit this statement of the necessity for the 
establishment of these schools at this time, with suggestions of 
a plan for these high-schools. : 
“1. The Necessity for High- schools and other Schools for Highe: 
Education Our State has not a complete system of public 
education. A complete system must have at least four grades 
of schools, viz.: Common schools, high-schools, normal schools, 
or training schools for teachers, and a State university. Three 
elements of this system exist in an incomplete form. A 
common school-system is organized all over the State, and is 
improving steadily. By contract with the Peabody Educational 
Board, the State has made provision for the training of a certain 
number of professional teachers. The Normal Institutes and 
schools, with a very short session, supply a stimulus for similar 
professional training. Chiefly through the bounty of the United 
States the State has a State University. But.the second and 
_-most important element, the high-school, is almost wholly 
“wanting. As a part of -a system, it is entirely wanting.
-P-A-G-E-267
86 ProckEDINGS OF THE 
    
if Although cities and incorporated towns have been given the 
‘| right to organize high-schools, and to use a portion of the 
school-fund, or to raise additional school-funds for this purpose, 
-we have nothing like a complete system of high-schools. Wé 
request, in effect, that this privilege be extended to the counties - 
as a whole, and that such legislation should be had as may be” 
necessary to mold all of the existing schools into a complete 
system of high-schools alike for country and town. 
“We hold that it is as much the duty of the State to provide. 
high-schools, schools for training teachers, and universities for — . 
higher education, as it is to provide common schools. 
“The excellent high-schools in our cities show what vast 
good a complete system of such schools would do; but their 
existence in the cities only is injurious to education in the rural 
districts, ere ha the chief ieee we hear for luigh-sehools 
    the country aroun to come into thom to educate their children, ~ 
This is going on to an alarming extent all over our State, and is 
working to drive all the more intelligent, industrious, | ambi- 
Lidtis; and successfil peopls Out of the couttiy. “We are heart- 
ily in in favor of city high-schools, but we are wholly dissatisfied. - 
with the present system of laws, which allows incorporated 
towns to levy taxes and raise funds for the support of high-' 
schools for the benefit of people living inside of the corpora- 
tions, but refuses this privilege to the County Courts who may 
wish to organize high-schools for the benefit of the people who 
‘must live in the country. This one-sided, partial law tends, 
like many other national, State, and corporation laws, to build 
up the towns at the expense of the country; to deprive the 
farmer of the privilege of educating his children, which he esteems 
above every thing else, and to reduce him to the position of an 
ignorant peasant. 
“No reason can possibly be given for refusing the counties 
the right to organize or adopt existing high-schools and to raigé 
money for their support, if they are able and anxious to do a0: 
“Tn the system of public education first established in the ' 
State, county academies were provided for, and the endowment 2 
provided for them at that time has been preserved in a few 
cases. But in most of the counties the funds have disappeared.    
-P-A-G-E-268
Convention oF Pustic ScHoot OFFicers. 87 
  
- and we now have no provision for raising any money for their 
re-establishment or maintenance.- We petition for a revival of 
this system on an enlarged scale, which will admit of the adop- 
tion or organization of from two or more high-schools, located 
not at the county seat, necessarily, but with special reference to 
the accommodation of the people of the rural districts. 
“The all-important question in our State to-day is the best 
method of educating the masses of our people. We argue the 
present proposition, the necessity for high-schools, again from 
the stand-point of the common school. Without forgetting 
the claims of the higher education for its own sake, we argue * 
that an efficient system of common schools is not possible with- 
out a system of higher schools. To state the point practically, 1. 
the common school graduate is not a proper teacher for the 
common school; he should have completed a high-school course 
at least. So the high-school graduate is not competent to teach 4 . 
in the high-school; but should first take a good college or uni- 
versity course. : 
*<To take the pupil out of the school and put him at its head 
immediately, without farther education, is working in a ‘vicious 
circle’—a sort of ‘in and in breeding’ which will soon destroy 
any system of schools, 
“ Education is the development of power inthe pupil. To do 
this the teacher must have a large reserved supply of power on 
which to draw; that is, he must have stored or potential energy. 
He must, if he is an efficient teacher, be able always, like a bat- 
tery charged with electricity to impart the vital spark, the 
quickening*force, to the sleeping intellect. Or, like the. guide 
through the wilderness, he should be thoroughly acquainted, 
not merely with the limited horizon in whose center he and his 
pupil stand to-day, but he should know all the features of the 
whole country—east, west, north, and south—the wealth hidden g 
jin the soil under foot, the flora that adorns its surface, the fauna’ 
that burrows in its soil, hides in its brush, or sings in its trees, 
the signs of the sky which portend the blessed sunshine and 
gentle rain or the coming of the blizzard and the cyclone, the 
mysteries of the forests beyond, the courses of the rivers and — 
the dangers of their currents, and the safe resting. place for the 
tight, under the shadow of the trees and near by a fountain of 
_ living waters.

“The true teacher, the frue guide, must have had learning 
and experience both far beyond the sphere of his pupil, or he 
is a mere ‘blind leader of the blind’ through this life’s wilder- 
ness. ; 
“Education seeks to develop not mere erude power, but ¢ e8- 
pecially the ability to direct force to wise purposes and profita- 
ble ends. Power is rampant throughout the world. Education 
would catch, chain, and store it to be used to do the world’s 
work. 
“Another great aim of education is to fill the soul full of high 
aspirations and noble desires, to give the spirit of man wings ~ 
with which to soar. It has been well said that ‘half the bad 
work of the world comes more from want of hope than from 
want of vigor.’ How can the guide who knows nothing be- . 
yond to-day’s horizon, the teacher who has no education beyond 
the school-in which he teaches, supply either direction to the — 
energy or hope to the soul of his pupil? 
“Private reading and study, or extensive experience in the 
world, may, in rare instances, make up for the Jack of a higher 
éducation, but. we cannot depend upon the exceptions or the 
prodigies in building up a system. Inu such a case we have 
to deal with the average man, who must be educated through | 
many grades above the plane of his work if he is to be a gen- 
uine teacher. 
“ Hence, we argué that a good common school- system, with- 
out any higher grade of schools to train its teachers, would be 
an impossibility, just as good high-schools are impossible with- 
out colleges, and good colleges impossible without universities. 
Edueation cannot be diffused upon a ‘dead level.’ Like the 
light of the sun, the rain, or any other form of potential en- 
ergy, it can only be extensively and effectively diffused from 
above downward, from a higher form to a lower.. <As all the 
_ material world lives and works to-day by the stored energy of 
the sun, the result of the combustion of many worlds belong- ~ 
ing to past cycles, so all the world of thought lives by the. 
power of the learning accumulated in ages past. As the rains’ 
which refresh the thirsty plants had first to be lifted tothe. 
- clouds, so must all learning first be extracted from matter, and — 
lifted up in the universities and colleges before it can be dif

fuscd downward through the common schools. The common 
schools, the little streams which irrigate the meadows, all sprang 
from these lakes far back in the histori¢ mountains of educa- 
tion. 
“For this reason’ the friends of the common schools must 
also be the friends of the high-schools, of the colleges, and of 
the universities. The system is one whole, and no ove member 
ean remain in health unless the others are healthy. Pay. no 
heed, we beg you, to the ignorant, narrow demagogue who 
would convince you that the State has no interest in the 
education of the few who can get the direct benefits of the ° 
higher institutions. It was the king of the Jacobins who in- 
vented this argument. A Robespierre said: ‘The republic 
has no need of savants.’ It is the few who make all the ad- 
vances in this world. A true philosophy knows no absolute 
commune, and we will never reach one until the sun ceases to 
shine, and we sink into the community of death. On the con- 
trary, the world needs the highly educated few to be the leaders 
in al] departments of its work. 
“he wisdom of the Egyptians was that of a few priests in 
a very high state of science. The only way our race has made 
avy progress in science, art, industry, or philosophy has been 
through the influence of the few chosen leaders of men, like 
Moses, Luther, and Washington; the few chosen tribes, like 
Judah, Romulus, aud the modern Anglo-Saxon; the few chosen 
_ nations, like the Jews, the Greeks, or the Germans of our day; 
and the few chosen institutions that have served to train the 
masses to a knowledge of better things. In the development 
of education, as of popular government, science, and all the 
other glorious things of which this country boasts, there have 
always been recognized leaders. The few, educated in the 
highest degree, are absolutely uecessary as discoverers, invent- 
ors, as learned men and philosophers, as teachers and guides. 
There can be no education of the masses even without the cult- 
ure that comes only from the higher schools. 
“2, Suggestions as to a Plan.—The ideal system of education 
for the masses, of the people would provide a common school 
within two miles, and a high-school within four, of every citizen’s 
house. The best pupils from the common schools-should be

educated, free of charge, in the high-schools, and the best grad- 
uates of the high-schools should receive scholarships in the_ 
Normal College of the district, or the State University, as they 
might select. While we may not have so complete a system at 
first, let us now begin the organization of high-schools upon a 
plan that will lead to it. : 
“Some provision must be made for the further education of 
those young people who complete the common school course 
at an early age. In the absence of the high-school in the 
country, these bright young minds have now no opportunity for 
* further training. Many of them earnestly desire to, and would 
if they had the opportunity, graduate at our colleges, and would 
then enter the higher professions. Under the present system, 
their only opportunity to become prepared for college is found 
in the paid private school. 
“We need the high-school to fill the great gap now existing - 
between the common schools and the normal colleges or the 
university. The high-school is the missing link that will- bind 
our institutions into a new chain of strength that will prove a 
great protection to every interest of our commonwealth. 
“Provision has already been made for the establishment of 
high-schools in cities and incorporated towns (see Sections 46, 
52, and 53 of Chapter 25 of the Public School Laws of Tennes- 
see). These corporations are fully authorized already to do all 
that we now request that the counties be allowed to do, viz.: 
To raise additional funds by a special tax with which to supple- 
ment the school-fund, and thus provide means for the graded 
schools and high-schools. All we ask uow is that the counties 
be permitted and encouraged to do the same thing where they 
feel able to do it and need such schools. : 
“It should be arranged so that from one to five, or as many 
ag may be necessary, can organize for establishing and conducting 
a high-school. - Every such high-school district should have the 
right to hold property, to sue-and be sued, etc., as other school- 
districts have. In case several school-districts unite to organize - 
a high-school, the chairmen oftheir boards might form the 
board of management. A good school-house should. be pro- 
vided, centrally located, the location being determined by a vote. 
of the District Directors forming the high-school district. «A

least two teachers should be provided, who should be good col- 
lege or normal college graduates. The high-schools should 
run for ten full scholastic months. Allowing one thousand dol- 
lars for teachers and two hundred and fifty dollars for other ex- 
penses, the total cost of twelve hundred dollars per year might 
be divided as follows: If five of the more populous and wealthy 
school-districts, covering a territory of about six miles square, 
would unite in supporting such a high-school, it would only re- - 
quire an average of two hundred and fifty dollars additional 
for each school-district to be raised. The laws should be so 
established as to encourage the people in every way to wUn- 
dertake the high-school, but it should not be mandatory. The 
Directors should have authority to adopt existing private high- - 
‘schools and re-organize them as public high-schools whenever 
“it is-desirable to do so. The State Board of Education and the 
‘Superintendent: of Public Instruction should be especially 
charged with the work of organiziug these schools, giving plans 
for buildings, providing teachers, etc. 
“Only graduates from the common schools, or the students 
‘having equivalent education as shown by examination, should 
be admitted to the high-schools. The high-school should do 
no part of the common school work, and should preferably be 
- kept entirely distinct from it, being located at a different place 
and having a separate building of its own. 
“The course of study should be regulated bylaw. We would 
suggest a three year’s course in the following subjects: 
“1. Higher arithmetic, book-keeping, algebra, and geometry. 
“2, Higher English, composition, rhetoric, general history, 
elements of English literature, and the study of our govern- 
ment. 
«3, Latin (the Directors should decide whether there is a 
sufficient demand for this), grammar, reader, Cesar, Cicero, 
and Virgil, with Latin composition throughout the course. 
“4, The sciences: Physical geography, elementary physics, 
botany, physiology and hygiene, elements of geology and agri- 
culture of Tennessee, as now required to. be taught in the com- 
mon school course. It should be taken out of it and put in the 
high-school course. Free-hand and mechanical drawing, phys- 
- ical culture, and practice in public speaking, should be included.

“What a blessing such a school would be to the thousands of 
young people in all country districts who have no opportunity 
for obtaining a good education. The State owes it to itself 
and owes it to its children to educate them togthe greatest 
extent to which it is possible to do. As President White 
has said, ‘it is the duty of the State to itself, a duty in the 
highest sense, a duty which it cannot throw off, to see that 
the stock of genius and parent of each generation should have 
opportunity for development, that it might increase the world’s 
stock, and aid in the world’s work.’ 
“ We petition you now merely to provide a plan and give the 
County Courts the opportunity or privilege of taxing them- 
selves to organize schools for the better education of their 
children. / 
“All of which is respectfully submitted.” 
Mrs. French discussed the report as follows: “The paper 
which preceded this one stated that the high-school of Knox- 
ville, which is one of the best high-schools in the South, was 
attended by a very small number of boys, I do not remember’ 
how many. I know the year when two boys and seventeen 
-girls graduated. I presume that the number of boys in, the 
country high-schools would be smaller, and I have not been 
perfectly reconciled to asking the Legislature to establish addi- 
tional high-schools when the boys will not take advantage of 
those already established, and when our City Superintendent 
has spoken in favor of a compulsory law to force them into the 
school. We are asking the Legislature to establish schools 
where there are no male scholars to enter. My conclusion is 
that these gentlemen intend the county high-school for the 
girls; therefore I wish to return my thanks to the committee 
for having taken up the subject of the education of the country — 
girls. They want the State of Tennessee to establish high- 
schools in the country for the education of the country girls, 
but why did they not come out and say so? As the advocate and 
the exponent and the defender and the protector, and every 
thing else of the sex, I wish to ask if you will not change that... 
At our last State Teachers’ Association our Superintendent 
presented a resolution, which was carried, that our Legislature.
-P-A-G-E-274
ConvENTION or Pusiic Scoot OFFICERS. - 93 
  
at its next session be petitioned to establish for the girls of: 
Tennessee an industrial school. He was chairman of that com- 
mittee. That subject must come up before the Legislature. 
Shall we go before that body and ask for the establishment both 
of an industrial school for girls and county high-schools for 
girls? I wish that we could have both, but I do not believe 
that the Legislature will let us have either if we ask for both. 
I think if we could concentrate our forces upon the industrial 
school we would do the best for the girls of Tennessee. I have 
quit teaching school to consider the questions affecting women, 
and so I speak after mature deliberation, and not upon impulse; | 
and what we need for the women and girls of the State is in- 
dustrial education. I do not say that we do not need the other, 
and would not be benefited by it, but the prime necessity is for 
industrial education. All of them cannot become teachers. 
We need washers and ironers, and house-servants, and cooks a 
great deal more than we need teachers just now, and we want 
to give them a good, plain, and practical way of making a liv- 
ing. The existence even of crime and poverty makes this edu- 
cation a crying need. Some method should be devised to save 
them from starvation and misery. The reason why many girls, 
as well as boys, do not go to the country schools is because 
they do not fit them for the struggle of life, and they cannot 
afford to waste their energies altogether. They must have this 
industrial education, and I oppose this address simply for the 
reason that I am afraid if we ask for this we will not get the 
other.” 
State Superintendent Smith said: “The question before us 
is the adoption of the report which was read by Dr. Dabney. 
This question has been presented many times in Tennessee, 
both in the State Teachers’ Association and in this Association 
of Public School-officers. One year ago a committee was ap- 
pointed to report to this meeting, and the address that is to be 
adopted here is to be presented to the General Assembly of the 
State. One word as to what was done by the State Teachers’ 
Association and by the committee of which I am chairman. A 
resolution was introduced in that association providing for the 
appointment of a committee that should go before the General 
Assembly and ask that provision. be made to give to the women

of the State education equal to that now given to the boys at 
the University of Tennessee, and it does seem to me that we are 
on the high-road to success along that line. 
“This Association has adopted a resolution asking the board 
of trustees to open its doors and admit young ladies on the 
same terms as young men are now admitted. Two of the pro- 
fessors of this institution have spoken before you and said that 
they were in favor of this movement. One of the teachers was 
so enthusiastic in his advocacy of the move that he opened his 
arms to receive the ladies. There has not been a dissenting 
voice to that feature, and to consider that I understand a com- 
mittee has been appointed. 
_ “This report has been prepared with considerable care. We 
are not wedded to it. Iam not defending it. Almost a ma- 
jority of the counties in the State are represented. If you wish 
to present this question to the Legislature, you can do it by the 
adoption of this or a similar report. I think the General As- 
sembly should grant to the counties what is here asked. It 
simply gives permission to the County Courts and the people 
to tax themselves to establish one, two, or five high-schools, as 
_ they may deem proper. They cannot do that now, and there 
is a demand in those counties where the people wish to educate 
their children for higher education. Some counties will not 
avail themselves, perhaps, of this permission. It is only a per- 
mission, and is not mandatory. It seems to me that the proper 
thing to do is to adopt this report either in its present form or 
with amendments, and let the boys and girls take care of them- 
selves as to whether they will avail themselves of the opporta- 
nities offered. If the boys wish to go to school, and the schools 
are before them, let them go. If they want to go into business, 
let them do so, Let them go on, and let the girls have the ad- 
vantage. It is not intended, as a matter of course, that these 
schools shall be for the benefit solely either of the boys or of 
the girls, but for thd benefit of the young men and young 
women of the State of Tennessee, and I trust that we will look 
at it in that light. If you are prepared to reflect the sentiment 
of your county, and you know that your county is opposed to 
this plan, and you vote for it, that does not in any way affect: 
your county, for thie report only asks that permission be given: 
-
-P-A-G-E-276

to those counties who wish to establish schools of this character 
to do so. Are you willing-to say that we shall ask the Legisla- . , 
ture to give this permission no matter whether you want it. 
or not? You may be abundantly supplied with schools, and 
your schools may be entirely satisfactory ; but are you prepared 
to say that other counties where they do not have and want 
these schools, shall be cut off from this relief? That is the . 
question before us. I know that this will be a grand step for- 
ward, and that the day is not far distant when, should this per- 
mission be extended to each of, the counties, one or niore high- 
schools will be established at public expense in every county. 
“Many of us know that in 1873, when our public school law 
went into effect, it was not mandatory, but it said that the 
County Courts must elect a Superintendent and levy a tax suffi- 
cient to run the schools five months during the year, or submit 
the question to the people. If the people voted it down, that 
was the end of it. It was voted down in many counties, Some 
of the County Courts refused either to levy the tax or to sub- 
mit the question to the people. Finally public sentiment led to 
-the levying of the tax, or the submission of the question, until 
we got an organized public school-system to which there is now 
almost no opposition in the State. Such a thing as going back 
will never be known, and that is what this report contemplates. 
It is a step forward, and the people wish to take advantage 
of it. That is all, and I trust that you will adopt this report or 
something better.” 
Professor Karns said : “I am not prepared to discuss this ques- 
tion. I wish I were, because I feel the great importance of it. 
The purpose is, as I understand it, to supply the missing link 
in our State system of education. We know that the common 
schools and college education are provided for, but there is no 
secondary or intermediate education, except in so far as it may 
be furnished in a hap-hazard way in private schools, and now 
and then a city high-school. The great mass of the people of 
. Tennessee have not the benefits of this high-school education, — 
Tennessee perhaps lacks more; than any other State in that par- 
ticular. Few States have so deficient a system of education. as 
respects intermediate or high-school education... You may take 
_ the new States, like Kansas and those of the north-west, and

you will find that they have regular high-schools. In many.’ 
States they have a high-school in every township. We lack 
that, and there is a missing link in our system of education, and 
one which ought to be provided for; and we cannot have a com- 
plete system until it is provided for. We can see very readily 
what a complete system of education means. You have your. 
common school, which is now being graded, and in which the 
pupil begins at the first grade and goes on through to the. 
seventh. Formerly we did not have that plan, but went along 
with the common school course and never knew when we com- 
pleted it. That plan may now be in force somewhere, but we 
are getting it systematized, and, by the efforts of the State Su- 
perintendent, are getting a regular course of study; and when 
the child gets through with that, he is ready for something else. 
And now comes our missing link, which is the high-school to 
’ prepare the common school pupil for college. Many do not go 
to college, but we want provision for preparing those who do 
goon. Many will complete the common school course ;, many 
will not.. A smaller number will get through the high-school, 
and a still smaller number through the college, but some will . 
do so, and provision ought to be made for them. If we had a 
regular system of education, the university course would follow 
that at college. We can have a complete system of education 
when we supply this missing link in the chain, and not until 
then. 
“Tt has been said here that the proportion of boys in the 
country who would not go to school would be larger than that in 
the city. I know that the conditions are different in the country, 
and that there the boys have more inclination to go to school, for 
the reason that there are not so many business opportunities of= 
fered them. The boys in the city have access to a wider range of 
situations, The boy in the country has more ambition than the 
city boy to go to school and on through to college, and high- 
schools are needed as much, if not more, in the country than. 
they are in the city. A greater per cent. will attend these. 
schools in the country than the city, for the reasons that I have. 
stated.” soe : : 
Chancellor W. H. Payne discussed the question as follows:...

“It is with reluctance that I express a few thoughts regard- - 
ing the topic that is before.us for discussion. It seems to me, 
however, that it is such a very important one that it behooves ~ 
every one of us to express our opinions candidly. It is no 
mean occasion that has called us. together. One of. the most 
hopeful signs for the future of ‘Tennessee is such an assemblage 
as this. I do not know of a better way of expressing public 
-opinion than through such an Association as this.. I have been’ 
acquainted with this body only three years, but I have in that 
‘time seen very marked results growing out of those conferences. 
It has a great deal to do with the formation of a consistent 
body of educational doctrine. 
“Since I have been in the State I have been much concerned 
about what might be called the integrity of the public school- 
system of the State. Older States stand at a comparative dis- 
advantage with the newer States. They are obliged to take 
the fragments of an educational system, and out of those frag- 
ments to construct-a correct educational system. The effort is 
a tremendous one, and the burden is such that it requires all the 
wisdom of ourselves and our State Superintendent to shape our 
system of public instruction in the direction in which it should 
tend. We might as well be candid and express our opinions 
frankly, without fear of results; and, as for myself, I have not 
any fear of the facts. The first thing for us to do is to ac- 
knowledge that, as Tennesseans, we have only the fragments” 
of an educational system. 
“As Dr. Dabney has pointed out, there are legitimately four 
members to this system: The common school, the high-school, 
the university, and the school for the training of teachers. No 
system of public instruction can live without the education of, 
the teachers. So that, at least, there are four members. I said 
that an old State, whose educational system was organized un- 
der disadvantages, stands at.tremendous disadvantages with re- 
spect to a new State. Let me illustrate: About 1883 or 1834 
France sent her most illustrious citizen and philosopher, Victor 
Crusan, to study the Prussian system of education. He made 
his report, which was translated in London in 1884.. The year 
followiug a copy of that report-came into the hands of an am- 
' . pitious young man just graduated from Brown University. He 
1—App.B.
-P-A-G-E-279
  98 ProcrEDInas oF THE 
  
     went into one of the Territories asa missionary. He told mi 
that he was one afternoon sitting in the shade of a spreading. 
oak-tree, where now stands a great and growing city, reading 
his translation of Crusan, when the idea occurred to him, ‘ Why | 
cannot this Territory begin its system of education where 
Prussia left off, and save the cost of numberless experiments?’ 
Next year this Territory was organized as a State, and this 
young man from Brown University was elected Superintendent- 
of Public Instruction. It was in this manner that the Prussian 
system of four members was transplanted to that State at the 
beginning of its career. The State University is the head of 
the State system, and is the source of its strength and inspira+ 
tion, and the high-school, or the missing link, as it has just been’ 
termed, is the ladder passing up from the common school to the | 
university, permitting every boy and every girl to pass by in- 
sensible gradations from ‘the country school, through the high- 
school, to the university. There is the ideal educational system, 
and no State can claim to have a consistent educational system 
unless it is possible for every boy and girl to pass by insensible 
gradations from the common school to the high-school, and 
thence to the university. 
“The north-western States have largely copied the Prussian 
system. The people here say that Tennessee is to take advan- 
tage of years of experience. Let us profit by the experience of 
the most cultured and the foremost state of Europe in the shap- 
ing of our educational system. What we want to labor for in 
. Tennessee to-day is a public school system which shall be a unit, 
and to have such a system we must have these elements—the 
common school, the high-school, the university—and it is impos- 
. sible to conceive of a complete system of public school educa- 
tion without them. It seems to me that the first thing to be 
done by us and by our General Assembly is to provide a whole- 
some high-school in the reach of the great masses of the people. 
I have been struck with the ability which has been showin 
in the preparation of this report. It is one of the finest pre- 
sentations of public school doctrine that I have ever heard, andl. 
have heard many in my life; and the report on this subject is in 
every way ‘worthy of commendation. We cannot have a com: 
plete system of public school education without provision for.

the high-school. It is the connecting link between the common 
schools and the university. I-wish I might emphasize one part 
of the report, which I am afraid members of the General As- 
sembly will overlook: No system of public instruction can 
flourish a year without the State University, which is the source 
which must invigorate the whole. Destroying it is like strik-. -

that the salvation of the country depends more upon that which 
we are discussing than upon any other element of the system. 
I think one of the rankest heresies of the age is that propagated 
by the demagogue that instruction in the ‘three R’s’ is suffi- 
cient qualification for citizenship. It is a shallow fallacy to 
suppose that the mere ability to read and write and figure is 
all that is necessary to citizenship. The Greek proverb has it 
that the voter has no brains. What we want is to put a brain 
in the head of every boy, so that he may be‘ independent of /o

      vice. You must, to do that, carry your instruction at least: 
into the high-school grade, and you cannot do it short of that. 
‘You must put a brain in the head of every voter, so that he can 
come to his own conclusions, and cannot be made to vote in 
blocks of five or blocks of ten. My voice is unmistakably for ih 
this report. Let us rally to its defense. Z 
“T will not take any back seat with reference to industrial edu-

Superintendent Nelson inquired if the tax to support a high-

Superintendent Huffaker said he wanted to go on record as 
in favor of the report that-had been submitted. He said he felt 
that he-could not do otherwise, since the County Court of Ham- 
ilton had indorsed such measures as were suggested by the . 
report, and had instructed him to do every thing in his power , 
to bring them into enactment. He felt that he had little to add 
. after the excellent remarks by Chancellor Payne. 
Professor Karns asked Superintendent Smith if the echodl-

to levy taxes for the support of a high-school within its borders. 
Superintendent Smith replied in the negative. :

The report was unanimously adopted, and, upon motion of the 
Secretary, the committee which had prepared the report was’ 
continued to present the same to the General Assembly, State 
Superintendent Smith and Chancellor Payne being added to the ~ 
committee. 
Chancellor Payne, Chairman, submitted the report of the 
Committee on the Peabody Normal College, as follows: 
“The Committee om the Peabody Normal College would re- 
spectfully present the following report: 
“Since our last report to this Association, cohtinued prosper-

“This is an indication that this professional school is becom- 
ing national in its scope and patronage, and that thus it has be- 
gun to fulfill the purpose of its founders. It is not easy-to 
overestimate the importance to Tennessee of an institution that “ 
draws within its borders, in ever increasing numbers, the select’ 
youth of the South. It gives distinction to Tennessee as a 
State pre-eminent for its educational advantages, and thus forti- ~/ 
fies and justifies the pride which every citizen should feel in the S

commonwealth which he-calls his own; and, from. a material 
point of view, it means a steady and ever-increasing flow of 
money into our channels of trade. The very best moneyed in- 
vestment a State can make is in-an educational institution of a 
character that will attract the attention of the country. It 
means distinction, it means wealth, it means growth and pros- 
perity in all right lines. 
“ We should not forget the happy fortune that has given to 
Tennessee a normal school at a merely nominal cost. It has 
happened but once in the history ofthis country that the efforts 
of a State struggling to organize a system of public instruction 
have been supplemented by a board having millions at its dis- 
posal and determined to found the broadest and best school for 
the professional education of teachers that exists in the country. 
“The Peabody Board of Trustees is composed of the most 
distinguished men now living in this country, and when such a 
body has made deliberate plans for such an institution of learn- 
ing, we need entertain no doubts as to the character of their 
undertaking or as to its final success. 
“That a school for the higher education of teachers, national 
in character and unequaled in all its appointments, will be es- 
tablished in one of the Southern States is as certain as any pre- 
determined human event can be; and it is just as certain that 
the final location of this institution will be determined very 
largely by local public spirit, local sympathy, and local aid. As 
citizens of Tennegsée, we greatly desire that the Peabody Nor- 
mal College shall continue to grow and thrive in its present lo- 
cation, and our faith in the intelligence and generosity of our 
people is such that we entertain no doubt on this point. The 
last General Assembly made its usual appropriation of $10,000 
a year for two years almost without a dissenting voice, and it is 
fair to assume that with our growing prosperity and our brighter 
financial outlook the co-operation of our State with the Pea- 
body Board will be even more generous and quite as hearty. 
~ It must be recollected, however, that a sam which sufficed when 
the membership of the schoo] was one hundred and seventy- 
seven will not suffice now when this number has grown to four 
hundred. 
. “In our report of last year mention was made of the fact that

the Peabody Board, through ‘its special committee, had appros 
priated $12,000 for-a model school, or school of observation 
It now gives us pleasure to report that this building has been ~~ 
completed and that the school thus provided for is in successfu: 
operation. The actual cost of this building was $13,629,:01 
$1,629 in excess of the appropriation of the Peabody Board.     
     This additional sum, together with $1,000 for furnishing, was’ “ 
supplied by the Trustees of the University of Nashville, and. 
we desire to place on-record the generosity shown by this board. ~ 
in contributing to the maintenance of this college. The value. 
of their grounds and buildings, at a low estimate, is $125,000, S 
and they not only contribute the use of all this property asa. 
free gift, but expend annually, in repairs and permanent im: | 
provements, the income from their endowment of $50,000. : It - : 
is an anomalous fact in academic history that a school is thus . 
administered by three independent boards without disagree- 
ment, dissent, or jar. Their entire harmony of action proceeds - 
from a common purpose to promote in every possible way the 
growth and efficiency of this institution of learning. 
“At the last annual meeting the Trustees of the Peabody 
Education Fund reduced the scholarships from $200 to $100, 
and the student’s railroad fare from his home to Nashville and 
return.‘ As the gross amount paid for scholarships will remain 
the same as-heretofore, it follows that under this new arrangé- 
" ment the number of scholarships will be considerably increased. 
For example, Tennessee now has fourteen scholarships, aggre- 
gating $2,800. It has been ascertained that the average rail- > 
road fare of Tennessee students living outside of Nashville is. 
$3.25, 80 that the average value of a scholarship, under this new» 
arrangement, will be $106.50; and $2,800 divided by this’. 
amount yields twenty- -B1X scholarships instead of fourteen, as-at 
present. 
“One obvious effect of this change will be to place all schol- : 
arship ‘students on an equality with respect to financial: aid. 
Under the present arrangement, the net value of a scholarship. _. 
ranges from.$200 to $150, depending on the distance a student, 
has to travel in order to reach Nashville. 
“Tt is probable that hereafter scholarships will be awarded. to 
students who lave maintained themselves in the college for

year or more at their own expense, and have given proof of 
their scholarship, character, and ability. It is obviously. just to 
give precedence to students who have had the ambition and 
pluck to spend a year in the college at their own cost; and it is 
equally obvious that the result of a year’s work in the college 
is a much better proof of fitnéss than any ordinary examina- 
tion can possibly be. Several important consequences will flow 
from this mode of appointment— 
“First.—A higher grade of scholarship and a higher quality 
of teaching ability. A year’s ‘trial will settle both these ques- 
tions conclusively. : 
“Second.—It will insure to the student a three years’ course 
of training instead of two. This is a result whose importance 
cannot easily be overestimated. It means scholarship, profes- 
sional spirit, and professional competence. 
“Third—By supplying an extra motive for attendance, it will 
add to the enrollment. It may be predicted that when this 
mode of appointment is in full force it will increase the attend- 
ance by one hundred and fifty. W. H. Paynes, 
. : J. C. Forp. 
After presenting the report, Chancellor Payne said: “It has 
been said that this school receives most of its Tennessee pupils 
- from Nashville. This is for a time necessarily so, and I would 
be ashamed for the school to be more popular in the extreme 
ends of the State than it is at home. Ifa man builds a hotel 
and expects patronage be must make his hotel worthy of pat- 
ronage. “We must build up the reputation of our school at 
home, and it will then extend to other parts of the country. 
“Tf I may be indulged in some remarks here, I will say that 
one of the most charming features of this meeting is the pro- 
motion of what may be called the solidarity of our educational 
_ interests—that is, the absence of any petty spirit saying, ‘This 
is my institution, that is yours; I will take care of taine, and 
you can take care of yours.’ You are too magnanimous for 
that. We are members of.an educational system which has 
but,one body, and what promotes the interest of one advances 
_ the welfare of another. If I were a Prince Bismarck, clothed 
with power as he used to be, I would do several things ‘for Ten-

neseee, In the first place, I would plant in the University: of 
Tennessee the best department of pedagogy that the country 
could afford. That would not injure my school, but would in- 
crease its attendance. I had an opportunity of establishing 
the first department of pedagogy in an American university. 
My friends of the Normal School said that I was striking a .. 
blow at their prosperity. Isaid ‘Oh no!’ That department. of 
pedagogy in the University of “Michigan had the effect of in- 
creasing the attendance at the Normal School. My department 
grew and increased, and so did the Normal School, which was 
never so prosperous as after the opening of that department. 
So if I were legislating for my own interest I would ask Dr. 
Dabney to establish the best department of pedagogy that he 
could in the University of Tennessee, knowing that such a step 
would help me. Mr. Smith knows very well that I am not only 
not envious of such an institution, but am glad to lend it all 
the help that I can. If I were endowed with this Bismarckian 
power, I would establish in each of the sections of Tennessee 
the best normal school that could be afforded. I would have 
one in each of the three divisions. That would mean increased 
prosperity for my school. One of the best ways of promoting 
the interests of the Peabody Normal School would be the-es- 
tablishment of normals in Tennessee. I would make improve- 
ments in the work of normal institutes, and that is a matter for 
which we should work and pray. A State system of public in- 
struction has a right to live, and it cannot live without the 
education of its teachers. No-system of normal instruction is 
adequate if it makes provision only for the lower grades of 
schools. This institution and that which I have the honor to 
“represent should educate teachers for the higher ranks in the 
profession, and give to the normal institutes the education of 
teachers for the graded schools. You must have these two 
grades of teachers, and there must be perfect harmony of in- 
terests. There need not be a jar between us, and I take pleasure 
in giving the facts in the case. I thank fou for your courtesy 
and attention.” :

CoxvENTION oF Pupiic Scoot Orricers. 109 | 
  
nounced to deliver a lecture to the Association, had expressed 
his inability to be present. : . bee 
Since many members of the Association had already gone 
home, and others had expressed their intention to leave during 
the day, Dr. Dabney requested the members of the Association 
to determine whether they would or not remain over for the 
entertainment proposed to be given at night to the visitors by 
' the Faculty of the State University-and citizens of Knoxville. 
He hoped that the -visitors would remain, but wished an ex- 
pression to that effect. 
After some discussion, in which it was made evident that 
many of the visitors could not remain, Secretary Goodman 
_Mnoved that the Association express its appreciation of the en- 
tertainment proposed, and the arrangements that had been 
made to carry it out, and return its regrets at being unable to 
accept the invitation to attend the same. 
-The motion was carried. 
Professor Graybill moved that a committee be appointed to 
consider and bring before the next meeting of the Association 
the questiou of adding two more studies to the public school 
curriculum. These studies were physiology and civil govern- 
ment. The former was in this age, in which great attention is 
being given to the moral and physical development of the 
human race, an essential study, and one of more importance 
‘than geology, which was already in the course of study. And 
“in view of the fact,” continued Professor Graybill, “that our 
country is growing rapidly in population, and that the increase 
is due largely to immigration from foreign countries of people 
who, come here filled with ideas of monarchies and the other 
governments of Europe, and who are strangers to our forms of 
' government, and know little of the elective franchise and the 
privileges of American citizenship, it is highly important that 
these classes, the importation of which has reached 6,222,000 
. duving the last five years, should be instructed in the funda- 
-=mental principles of our political system.” -I-move that a com- 
a

mittee be appointed to Present this matter to the Association at, 
its next meeting. oe 
_ The Chair decided that the motion was out of order, inasmuch 
as the formation of the programme for the next meeting was, 
under the By-laws .of the Association, delegated to the Execu- 
tive Committee and the President. They would, however, act 
upon any suggestion that might be offered them. : 
Superintendent Billingsley said he indorsed what Professor 
Graybill had said, and moved that a committee be appointed to 
present the matter to the next Legislature. 
Superintendent Huffaker said he thought the public school 
course was long enough. If geology and agriculture were trans- 
ferred to the high-schools, when the high-schools should be es- 
tablished, he would favor the addition of physiology and civil 
government to the common school curriculum, for he believed 
that they were of more importance than were geology and ag- 
riculture. 
. Superintendent Nelson moved in lieu of the motion before 
the House that the questioh be referred to the individual coun- 
ties. “Let the County Superintendent,” said he, “call a mass- 
meeting of school-officers and others to discuss the propriety of 
the step proposed. We are not a law-making body, and expe 
rience has taught us that we ask so much of the Legislature 
that they become disgusted and give us nothing. We are tak- 
ing those steps in our county and have a committee working on 
the subject. We had a mass-meeting and discussed the pro- 
priety. of asking the Legislature these things; and I move that 
this matter be referred to each county for its expression.” .. 
Superintendent Foster said: “If we have several cominit- 
tees to wait on the Legislature none of them will be: heard 
properly. I. am in favor of teaching physiology, but I think we 
had better let the Committee on High-schools wait on the wes : 
islature and defer this question until next year.”   
-P-A-G-E-292
Convention oF Pusiic ScHoot Orricurs. 111 
  
Superintendent Billingsley said he indorsed Superintendent 
Hutfaker’s idea, to remove agriculture and geology to the high- 
school course and to add physiology and civil government to 
the common school-course. “Mr. Nelson says his county has 
declared in favor of physiology, and I think the masses every- 
where are in favor of it; and if we can get geology and agri- 
culture removed to the high-school, we should put in physiology 
and civil government.” 
Superintendent Ford moved that the whole matter be referred 
to the Legislative Committee, with power to act. 
Professor Graybill said he was willing to accept that. “I 
think the teachers and school-officers,”’ said he, “are largely re- 
sponsible for the course of study and the degree of enterprise 
and progress in the educational work of the State; and the 
question might be aked the Legislature why you have not ad- 
vocated these subjects? Suppose the Legislature should say: 
‘The teachers have not asked for this, and do not want it,’ 
Kentucky has adopted civil government within the last twelve 
months, and almost every State in the Union has physiology. 
Suppose the matter should be brought up in Tennessee, and the 
Legislature should say that the teachers have not asked for it? 
‘We shall, in a measure, discharge our duty by this motion, and 
show that we appreciate the importance of this question, and 
desire legislation concerning it. I am willing to accept the 
amendment to my motion.” 
Superintendent Nelson: “I want to go down as supporting 
physiology. In our county we teach algebra and geometry, and 
there is not a countythat cannot do it. In connection with local 
taxation they can be taught, and every school in the State has 
the privilege to teach physiology by taxation, and the Directors 
are to fix the amount of that taxation or tuition. Our county 
fixes such tuition that no one: objects to.it, and we can teach 
any thing that we want to. This being the case, I do not see 
any necessity for asking legislation on this subject. We bore 
. the Legislature, and worry it to death -with school-committees ; 
and I believe that every Superintendent can recommend teach- 
\

   ing physiology, algebra, and geometry by placing in foreéa 
tuition. This is done, tor instance, in Bedford County, at 
Bellbuckle, among other places.” : 
  Superintendent Billingsley said: “I think this should be pre- 
sented by the committee already appointed. While the gentle- 
man from Rutherford may get along all right in his county, our - 
County Court will not levy that tuition, and we want ‘some 
plan to get as good a thing as he has.” : 
Superintendent Ford’s motion was carried. 
On motion of Superintendent Nelson the question of asking 
the Legislature for $3,000 toward carrying on Normal] Insti- 
tutes, the Peabody. Trustees to appropriate an equal amount, : 
was also referred to the Legislative Committee. ~ : 
Chancellor W. H. Payne was added to that committee. 
Chairman Hutfaker submitted the report of the Committee ° , 
on Resolutions, as follows: 
“Your Committee on Resolutions beg leave to submit. the 
following report: 
“Be it Resolved by the Convention of Public School- -officers,

Be it further resolved, 1. That we heartily indorse the able-ad-

the Peabody Normal College had increased rapidly, while the 
appropriation made to that institution bad not increased. The 
committee would therefore recommend that the Legislature be 
asked to increase said appropriation.

  . 114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 
  
Professor Graybill moved that the resolutions be adopted by”. 
a rising vote. He believed that every teacher believed in the. 
sentiments expressed, and believed that the courtesy extended 
by the University to the Association would have a tendency,to. 
elevate the public school-system of the State to a higher plane, 
and give the teachers more professional spirit and more pride 
in their work than they had had before; and he was sure that 
the kind courtesies and attentions, and the words and acts of. 
encouragement that had been received from that source would 
help them in their work. 
Superintendent Billingsley seconded the motion, whereupon - 
the resolutions were adopted unanimously by a rising vote. : 
Superintendent Ford invited the teachers to attend his Nor- 
mal next summer, and Dr. Dabney invited those present to Visit » 
the different departments in the University, and stated that he 
would display a phonograph'in the room after the conclusion 
of, the session. : 
« 
State Superintendent Smith was called upon to speak. He 
did so as follows: , 
“JT would like to say a great deal more, Mr. President, and 
ladies and gentlemen, than time will allow, because it is arranged 
for you to-listen in a few minutes to a talking machine, which, 
grinding out its words, will be able to talk better than I can. 
I feel, of course, that, if it were not a pleasure to me, it would 
be my duty to return my thanks to you for the honor which | 
you have conferred upon me in selecting me as your President 
for the ensuing year. I consider this a very great honor indeed. 
I have served you, in ‘an humble way, to the best of my ability 
as Superintendent of Public Instruction for the last four years. 
T have met with you at all the meetings of the public school- - 
teachers and public school-officers of Tennessee. Calling me 
to the position to which you have just elected me just as I was. 
about retiring from my official capacity, I deem as the greatest . 
honor that has been conferred upon me, and I have been hon: -   
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  Convention or Pusric ScuooL OFricers. 115 
  
ored, it seems to me, above that which I deserve. I have been 
selected as the President of the State Teachers’ Association. 
Without mentioning these things, however, I will pass. them 
by. I promise you to do the best I can, and I ask each of you, 
and also those who are not here, whom I will reach by letter, to. 
give to my successor the same. hearty co-operation that you . 
have given me, and to help him in any worthy object that he 
may undertake. : 
-“T feel that this is the last time I shall appear before you as. 
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and in retiring 
from this position I wish to commend to you some things that 
we have, as a body, inaugurated. I believe that a majority of 
you before me have put into practice and successful operation 
the graded course of study and the rules governing it. I am 
glad to see this. Adoption of text-books was a very trouble- 
some question four years ago, and for several years before that 
time I may say, thanks to our good brethren, the book-agents, 
-who made it so. They were energetic fellows and wanted to 
have their books used, and so when any set of books was 
adopted an agent for another house would come along and con- 
vince those who did the adoption that hie own books were su- 
perior to those which had been adopted and should be given a 
trial. There was, in consequence, a great deal of discarding. 
But I am not making a speech for the book-agents; some of 
them can speak for themselves. Neither am I opposing the 
book-agents. I will say, by way of parenthesis, that. during my 
-administration I have, at all times, extended’ a warm hand of 
congratulation to the book-agent when he visited any of the 
meetings. I find that they are, as a rule, gentlemen, and haye 
conducted themselves in such a way as to contribute to the suc- 
cess of the meetings, and. by and through them, many social 
courtesies have been extended. This, of course, has been a 
matter of business with these houses, for if we look at the ques- 
‘tion a moment we will see that no house could afford to employ 
a man in.this or any other State unless he was a gentleman. 
“On the text-book question we have, in almost every county 
in the State, absolute uniformity, and the graded course of study.

question, for it is now giving us no concern. There is not.a 
county in the State, so far as I know, where there has been any 
appreciable trouble during the last two years, and there has 
been none at all called to my attention during the last twelve 
months. The graded course of study will necessarily take with 
it uniformity of text-books, and in no Teachers’ Meeting in 
Tennessee do we find any discussion on the text-book question 
because it is settled and is satisfactory, but each time when the 
Legislature meets somebody wants to introduce a bill to make 
the text-books of the State uniform and to have-some sort of a 
State publication of text-books. If any thing shall be done by 
the next Legislature which shall have a tendency to demoralize 
the present substantial and good-working order of our schools, 
Iwant you to pay attention to it and let yourself be heard. 
‘You aré not to sit still and say nothing under the idea that you 
have no. influence with your member of the Legislature. If 
you hold to that idea you are mistaken. You can call the di- 
rectors, teachers, and the people together and express your 
opinion. Of course there is frequently some one with an ax 
to grind who is ready to begin to meddle with matters that are 
already doing well. If any thing of the kind shall come up in- 
the Legislature I shall give you warning, for I shall be there 
until the cluse of the year at least, and if you approve of the 
course of your Representative, indorse him; if you do not, let . 
yourself and county be heard from. I ask you to do this much, 
that we may preserve the work in successful good-running or- 
der. I have always been opposed to any sort of legislation, 
touching the text-book question. The text-books to-day are 
selected by the direct representatives of the people. The Dis 
trict Directors select them and they are elected by the people, 
and are responsible to the people and live among them, and I 
believe in home rule. Let them alone, and let the Legislature | 
have nothing to say except what subjects shall be taught. . I 
have taken that view of the matter boldly and have fought :it 
out all along the line and have been indorsed by 95 per cent. of 
‘the educators of the State. So I ask you that if any thing shall 
occur to menace your interests, let us hear from you. - noe 
“TJ could say many things to you, but I will close my retnairkie 
by again returning to you my sincere thanks for the many:

courtesies that you have shown me, and for choosing me. as 
your President for the ensuing year. I promise you to do all 
in my power to assist you in the educational work. I will, how- 
ever, make another statement: If you have any young persons 
in your county—Mrs. French will notice the use of the word 
“ persons ”—who wish to take the teachers’ course at the Univer- 
sity of Tennessee, I will esteem it a favor if you will, when you | 
get home, send me their names, so that I may be placed in cor- 
respondence with them. I-shall be connected with this institu- 
tion, and ask your co- operation in the work that I shall under- 
take. ” 
Mrs. French asked if she might tell the women, on the state- 
ment that had just been made; that they would be admitted to 
the teachers’ course at the University. She wanted to know if 
the committee to which the matter had been referred had al- 
ready acted. « 
Superintendent Smith replied that he had not intended to 
leave that impression, especially since the published statement 
had gone forth that the women could not, on account of inad- 
equate.facilities, be admitted. He could not, however, tell what 
would happen, and would not care if Mrs. French would work 
up a class of a hundred young ladies and see what the result 
would be. He said he could not, however, make any rash 
promises. 
Mrs. French thought that the work suggested would be a 
great deal to do on a rash promise. 
Superintendent Smith replied to the effect that he had never 
seen Mrs. French overloaded. with work. A committee has 
been appointed to look after the question, and he had heard 
nothing concerning it except from Professors Karns and Jor- 
dan, though he could say that Dr. Kent there would be glad to 
see the ladies in the University. 
Mrs. French: “Does the decision of the question depend upon 
the faculty, or upon some one else?” . é

“Prof. Frank Goodman, Nashville, Tenn.:

President Allen closed the meeting in the following words: 
“When I was selected to preside over this Association, I sin-

N REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
—OF THE— 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
To the Honorable Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public 
Instruction for Tennessee: 
" Srr—The Board of Trustees of the University of Tennes- 
see respectfully submit, in accordance with the requirements 
of the law, this report for the two years ending December 20, 
1890. . . / 
We are greatly gratified to be able to report that the Univer- 
sity has continued to prosper in all of its departments, and has 
' grown and extended its influence in a measure never equaled 
before in the same length of time. The evidences of this growth 
and prosperity are too numerous to be enumerated at this place. 
You will tind many of them stated in the reports of the Presi- 
dent, Treasurer, Dean of the College, and other officers of the 
institution, which are submitted herewith. But it will not be 
out of place here to summarize some of the most encouraging 
facts and some of the more important additions made to the 
University during the period since your last session. 
Since our last report was submitted, over twenty thousand 
. dollars have been added to the annual income of the University, 
as will be explained below. 
Before your honorable body has adjourned, the University 
"will have added and paid for sixty-two thousand dollars’ worth 
of substantial and handsome new bnildings,
-P-A-G-E-307
   In the same period about twenty-five thousand dollars has’ 
been expended in repairs to buildings, and in providing bette: 
equipment for the various departments of instruction. | : 
  Two new departments, the Law Department and the Teachers’ : 
Department, have been created, and the older ones have been. 
greatly enlarged and strengthened. - 
Three additional professors have been added to the Academie 
Faculty, and six additional instructors. 
The number of students in attendance upon the Academic | 
Department is almost double what it was three years ago, and- 
all of the departments have experienced a most healthful growth. 
The University of Tennessee is, in accordance with the 
statutes, an integral part of the public educational system. of . 
the State. It.was designed to be the cap-stone of this system, 
and to complete the work begun in the common and carried on 
through the high-schools. .The present organization of the 
University does not appear to be well understood, and needs to 
be explained. . 
The foundation of the University was laid by the State in the* 
establishment of East Tennessee College, and its endowment 
with certain lands given to it by the Congress of the United 
States for the benefit of public education. When the General 
Assembly endowed this college with the proceeds of the land- 
grant donated by the act of Congress of 1862, it was required 
to provide all of the land and buildings for the accommodation | 
of at least two hundred and seventy-five students. East Ten- 
nessee College, which had then become East Tennessee Uni- 
versity, provided, in accordance with this contract, land, build- 
ings, and other property, which are now worth at least one-half 
a million dollars, an amount greater than the entire endowment’ 
resulting from the sale of all the congressional land-grants. 
       The original East Tennessee University was an academic in- 
stitution, pure and simple. When its Trustees received the: 
proceeds of the land-grant of 1862, they entered into a contract |
-P-A-G-E-308
with the State to establish in their: University an Agricultural 
and Mechanical College, and to receive and instruct in it, free 
of tuition, at least two hundred and seventy-five State students, 
or as many as should desire this instruction from year to. year. 
This contract was not designed to entirely obliterate the East 
Tennessee University as an academic institution, but to extend 
and enlarge it in conformity with the United States statutes .on 
this subject. The statute of 1862 says that the funds arising 
from the sale of public lands shall be devoted to “the endow- 
ment, support, and maintenance of at least one college where 
the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific 
and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach 
such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the 
mechanic arts.” 
The present organization is designed to meet all of the re- 
quirements of the statutes of the United States and of Tennes- 
see, as well as of the original charter of the parent institution. 
This organization is as follows: 
Academie Department.—The Collegé of Agriculture, Mechan- 
- ie Arts and Sciences, with the following courses of study: (a) , Literary-scientific Course, (6) Latin-scientifie Course, (c) Course 
in Agriculture, (d) Course in Civil Enginecring, (e) Course in 
Mechanical Engineering, (f) Course in Chemistry, (g) Course 
in Mining Engineering. 
Thus it will be seen that “the sciences pertaining to agricult- 
ure and the mechanic arts,” which are to be made “the leading 
object”’ in these colleges, form five-sevenths of the instruction 
offered, while two-sevenths represent the “other scientific and 
classical studies” which are required to be included. 
The University Department.—(a): With courses for the grad- 
uate degrees of M.A., M:S., and Ph.D.; (6) with professional 
courses, leading to the degrees of C.E., Min.E., and Mech.E., 
and elective courses for special students. — - * 
A Teachers’ Department, with an ;elective course leading ‘to 
a certificate as licentiate of instruction.”
-P-A-G-E-309
  —3— 
A Department of Law, with a course leading to the degree 
of B.L. s: 
A Department of Medicine, with a course leading to the de- 
gree of M.D. LA 
A Department of Dentistry, with a course leading to the: ae. 
gree of D.D.S. 
The public funds are devoted exclusively to the maintenance 
of the College of Agriculture, Mechanic Arts and Sciences, - 
forming the Collegiate Department. 
The requirement of the Code (Section 339), that “the accom- 
modation and instruction of persons of color shall be separate 
from the white,” is met by providing “ corresponding accommo- 
dation and instruction” at Knoxville College, in Knoxville, for 
colored men who pass the required examinations and receive 
appointments. This will be considered further on. 
It will be noted that the work of the University has been ex- 
tended in several directions since our last report. A Law De- 
partment has been established in the University proper, under ° 
the guidance of the Hon. Thomas J. Freeman, ex-Justice of the 
Supreme Court of Tennessee. A Teachers’ Department was 
opened a year ago in connection with the Academic Depart-. 
ment of the University. Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintend- 
ent-of Public Instruction of the State, has been recently elected 
principal. of this department, and will enter upon his duties as 
soon as he is released-from his present official position. The 
other departments of the University have been considerably 
enlarged at the same time. Additional instructors for. agri- 
eulture and horticulture have been added in the Agricultural 
Department, and the Mechanical Department, which had just 
been established when our last report was submitted, has been 
finely equipped for instruction in wood and iron work. “ 
Two handsome buildings are now under construction, and 
rapidly approaching completion, upon the University grounds. 
One—the Science Hall—is being: built with funds derived from. :
-P-A-G-E-310
z —9I— 
he sale of lands, as is explained below, and will contain labora- 
tories for chemistry, metallurgy, mineralogy, geology, and 
physics; drawing-rooms and lecture-rooms for civil engineer- 
ing and mechanical engineering; a large hall for the museum 
of mineralogy and economic geology, and another large audi: 
ence-room for public assemblages. The other building is the - 
Young Men’s Christian Association and Gymnasium Building, 
which is being erected by a society composed of the students 
of the University and their friends. 
The Board of Trustees. of the University have owned for 
many years the following tracts of land in the suburbs of 
~ ‘Knoxville, which were inherited from the old Blount and East 
’ Tennessee College, and not given it by the State: 
First.—A tract of thirty-five acres, generally known as the 
College Hill tract, lying immediately west of, and adjacent to, 
the city of Knoxville, on the Tennessee River, in the town of 
West Knoxville, and containing, now, the University buildings, 
the building of the Agricultural Experiment Station, a consider- 
able campus and drill-ground, and the grounds of the Horticult- 
ural Department. This property has been considerably im- 
proved by grading, setting out trees, building roads and walks, 
and is rapidly becoming a beautiful park. The location is one 
of the most desirable, from every stand-point, that could be 
found anywhere for an institution of learning. We have here 
a complete separate system of sewerage, the purest water, with 
freedom from the dust and noise incident to the city, which can ° 
still be reached, when necessary, by a ten minutes’ walk. This 
beautiful and valuable property is, of course, held intact for the 
future expansion of the University. It is large enough to ac- 
cdmmodate all the buildings and laboratories of the greatest 
university in the world. 
Second.—A tract of one hundred acres of beautifully lying, 
very fertile land in a bend of the river one mile west of the 
. city of Knoxville, and about three-quarters of a mile from the 
University grounds above described, is: reserved for the ex- 
‘perimental farm.- This tract is highly improved, and has fair, 
though small, buildings for a farm-house, barn, cow and horse- 
‘« stables, tool-house, dairy, root-cellar, silos, etc. - There is ample
-P-A-G-E-311
—10— 
_ room here for all of the operations of an experimental: £i 
the location being as suitable for this purpose as can be 
anywhere in this country. This property is being steadil 
proved, and is already the admiration of every visitor. 
Third.—Located one-half a mile north of the experimen al 
farm, and separated from it by two railroads, a turnpike and. 
creek, was a tract. of land consisting of one hundred and forty- 
four acres, which has never been used for any educational pur- 
pose or in any way, except to graze stock, grow forage, or other 
farm crops. It was not desirable for even these purposes. Since 
the opening of streets and railroads through a portion of it, it 
became practically impossible to use it for farming. Having 
frequently applied to the General Assembly for the means with’ 
which to erect the much-needed building, and without success, 
this Board of Trustees decided that the best use they could 
make of a portion of this was to sell it and re-invest the:money 
in a building for scientific laboratories, lecture and drawing- 
rooms, a8 above described, and so much needed by the institu- 
tion. Only so much ofthis land was sold as was required. to 
erect this building. About forty-nine acres in one piece, sep- 
arated from the rest by a railroad, and rendered almost. useless 
for agricultural purposes. by being cut up by streets, was placed 
upon the market, and the price of one thousand dollars per 
acre was received for it. The whole of this fund will be ex- 
pended in the erection of the new building, a cut of which ‘ae- 
companies this report. In this way an investment which yielded 
the University absolutely nothing, and was not likely ever to 
yield it any thing in any other way except by sale, was con- 
verted into another form, in which it will be of incalculable ad- 
vantage in educating the youth of the State in those sciences 
which it is the especial object of the college to foster. Addi- 
tional funds will be needed to furnish this building and equip 
the laboratories it will contain. 
The Young Men’s. Christian Association of the ee of . 
Tennessee.is, we are happy to say, a useful and vigorous organi- 
zation. This Association last year decided that they must have 
a building of their own, similar to those provided for these Asse- 
ciations in the large cities, and took sucl: active steps to secure 
     
   
 
-P-A-G-E-312
—i —_- 
it that in a short time they had raised nearly ten thousand. dol- 
lars for this purpose in good subscriptions. They then peti-~ 
tioned this Board of Trustees:to allow them the use of a lot of 
ground upon which to erectit. This was done under conditions .- 
which secured the Association the. use‘of the building for its _ 
proper purposes, and secured the Trustees at the same time in 
the possession and control of ‘the property. The building will . 
contain parlors, reading-rooms, and assembly-rooms, a large 
gymnasium, with conveniences-for bathing, which will be open 
to all the students of the University desiring to useit. A very 
~ handsome building was planned, which will ultimately cost fif- 
teen thousand dollars. This is now rapidly approaching com- 
pletion. . Additional subscriptions have been raised, and there 
is'no reasonable doubt about its erection and equipment as 
planned. The Association deserves great praise for its enter- 
prise and energy in carrying out this purpose, and the people of 
the entire State have cause to rejoice in the existence of this 
good work, anj the erection of this excellent building for its 
promotion. 
All of the older buildings have been thoroughly overhauled 
and repaired during the last two years, and the property of the 
University is now in better condition than it has been for a long 
. time. : 
Another great source of encouragement is to be found in the 
darge increase of the income of the University. 
Our income, which was about thirty-one thousand dollars in 
1887, will in 1891 reach fifty thousand dollars, not including the 
annual appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars to the Agri- 
cultural Experiment Station. This increase is due entirely to 
the bounty of the United States. Congress has recently. made 
a handsome addition to the funds. provided for the current 
_ expenses of instruction in the land-grant colleges, established 
_ under the well-known act of July 2, 1862, by the act now 
: known as the “New Morrill Act,” approved August 80, 1890. 
- Senator Justin S. Morrill,.of Vermont, deservedly called*the — 
_: father of these colleges, haying introduced the original bill for
-P-A-G-E-313
  —12— 
their establishment into Congress over thirty years. ago: cand - 
secured its passage about twenty-cight years ago, introducéd a. 
new bill for their benefit in the Senate of the United States on 
the twenty-fifth of March, 1890. The general purpose of the 
bill, as expressed. in its title, was “to apply a portion of. the 
proceeds of public lands to the more complete endowment. and 
support of the colleges for the benefit of agriculture andthe ’ 
mechanic arts, established under the provisions of an act of 
Congress, approved July 2, 1862.” It appropriated “the sum 
of fifteen thousand dollars for the year ending June, 30, 1890, 
and an annual increase ef the amount of such appropriation 
thereafter for ten years by an additional sum of one thousand 
dollars over the preceding year, and the annual amount to be 
paid thereafter to each State and Territory to be twenty-five 
thousand dollars.” 
The act further stipulates that this appropriation is “tobe . 
applied only to instruction in agriculture, the mechanic arts, 
the English language, and the various branches of mathemat- 
ical, physical, natural, and economic sciences, with special refer- 
ence to their applications in the industries of life, and to the 
facilities for such instruction.” “The grants of moneys au- 
thorized by this act are made subject to the legislative assent, of 
the several States and Territories to the purpose of said grants; 
Provided, That payments of such installments of the appropri- 
ation herein made as shall become due to any State before the 
adjournment of the regular session of the Legislature meeting 
next after the passage of this act, shall be made upon the assent 
of the Governor thereof, daly certified to the Secretary of the 
Treasury.” 
Like the original land-grant act, this one insists that all of 
the lands and buildings forming the permanent equipment of 
the college must be provided by the State, or from some other 
source, and prohibits the appropriation of any portion’ of ‘this 
fund “under any pretense whatever, to the purchase, erection, 
preservation, or repair of any building or buildings.” Thewhole . 
of these funds derived from the United: States, either directl, oF, 
or indirectly, the income ofthe proceeds of the sale of ‘the P    
  
-P-A-G-E-314
  —i13— 
lie lands, as well as the new direct appropriations, must be de-, 
voted exclusively to defraying the current expenses of instruc- 
tion in the College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, “and 
to the facilities for such instruction.” : 
The Governor of Tennessee having, in accordance with the 
authority granted in the act, given his official assent to the 
‘ purpose of the grants as set, forth in it, the Secretary of the 
Interior of the United States has decided that the University 
- of Tennessee is entitled to them, and the first appropriation of 
fifteen thousand dollars has been paid to the University through 
the State Treasurer. 
Only one clause of this new act:requires special explanation. 
_ The act is carefully guarded, as it should be, to secure to the 
people of the colored race their fair share of the instruction 
provided by it, though this is to be arranged in accordance with 
the general policy of the individual States. The. provisions 
with regard to this matter are as broad and liberal as they could 
well be made, the States being left to solve this problem in 
their own accustomed manner, and the only point insisted upon 
being that colored students prepared to take this instruction 
should have their equitable share of its benefits. A proviso de- 
‘ elares that “no money shall be paid out under this act to any 
State or Territory for the support and maintenance of a col- 
lege where a distinction of race or color is made in the admis- 
sion of students” and no adequate provision is made for the 
instruction of those thus excluded. The act goes on to explain 
that this requirement may be fully met (as it would have to be 
’ done in all the Southern States) in any one of several ways. 
. The first way suggested is by admitting colored students to a 
separate department or college under the management and con- 
trol of the same board. 
-' Various other methods of solving ‘the problem were ‘sug- 
gested in the act, but this first.one meets our case fully, and it 
te is the only one necessary to be considered here. : blerey

  from the privileges of the University by reason of his 
color; but the accommodation of persons of color shall 
arate from the white.” The Board of Trustees of the 
sity have for many years met the requirements of this’: lau en 
by providing similar instruction, modified to suit the require-_- 
ments of the students of this race, in a separate department, A 
contract-was made with the management of Knoxville College, « 
a very excellent institution for colored youth, located in Knox- 
ville, which was in fall accordance with, and similar to; the ar- 
rangement made by the State with the University of Tennessee, 
explained above. Under this contract, Knoxville College pro- 
vides the buildings and grounds, and this Board of Trustees 
provides the teachers, apparatus, tools, machinery, and all other 
equipment necessary for an industrial college, which is a: sep- 
arate department for the education of colored youth in the.sci-- 
ences and practical arts required to be taught by the original 
land-grant act and this act of 1890. ‘The Trustees of the Uni- — 
versity of Tennessee appropriate an equitable share of both the 
funds, being an amount entirely adequate to the education of all 
colored students who obtain scholarships for the current ex- 
penses, elect the teachers, and have the general supervision, 
through: their President and Faculty, of all the work carried on 
in this industrial college. An additional portion of the. new 
appropriation has been set aside by the Board for the purpose ~ 
of perfecting the equipment and enlarging the instruction in 
this college, and. the management of Knoxville College. have 
made arrangements to erect immediately a new building for 
mechanical shops and scientific laboratories. When this is done 
this Board of Trustees. will, in pursuance of the existing ar-~ - 
rangement, equip it fully with machinery, tools, and apparatus, ° 
and provide salaries for the additional teachers. 
     
     .. The ‘instructien and other advantages provided thus fab ol- 
ored students are fully equal to those provided for me 
grade o of white students. 
The “Tennessee: law ‘on the subject and a deseription : ihe:
-P-A-G-E-316
—15.— 
arrangements for the instruction of colored students in this de- | 
partment of the University, were submitted by the Governor to. 
the Secretary of the Interior of the United States, whose'duty' 
it was to examine into these. matters, and he has decided that: 
we were already discharging our duty under the requirements: 
of the new act, and are therefore entitled to the entire and un- 
. divided appropriation. 
We respectfully request that the General Assembly pasé an 
act at its present session expressing its “legislative assent to the 
purpose of the grants” made in this act of Congress of August 
. 80, 1890, and declaring that. the University of Tennessee is en- 
titled to and should receive the full benefit-of the same, as the 
previous General Assemblies have done in the case of the orig- 
inal grant of 1862 and the Experiment Station grant to the 
same institutions in 1887. This Board pledges itself anew to 
use the additional fund in strict accordance with the act, and to 
provide instruction and facilities for instruction in the subjects. 
therein named. Additional instructors have already been se- 
cured for practical agriculture, horticulture, the English lan- 
guage, and economic science, each, and other instructors will 
soon be secured for physics, and for further strengthening the 
instruction in practical mechanics, mineralogy, geology, and in 
the other subjects provided for in the law. 
The enlargement of these departments of instruction and the 
increase in the number of shops, laboratories, and. recitation- 
rooms, render the necessity for new and better buildings all the 
more seriously felt. The University is, in fact, far ahead in 
instruction and equipment of the capacity of its buildings. 
_ The older buildings, containing the recitation-rooms in lan- 
guages, literature, and mathematics, and the dormitories for 
students, are entirely inadequate for the present demands. 
Large classes have often to be huddled together in small rooma, 
and every disadvantage is suffered which results from trying 
to-do modern work in ill-contrived, old-fashioned buildings. 
- These old buildings, although as well repaired as they can be, 
are entirely out of harmony with the progressive work of the 
institution, the substantial city in-which they are’ located,

   and the spirit of progress now everywhere felt in our St 
They should all be removed and replaced by substantial, mjod- 
ern buildings, such as would be for all time an honor tothe - 
great State of Tennessee. 
  We would, therefore, respectfully suggest that this General. 
Assembly should, in view of the handsome addition made:by 
the United States to the income of the University, and the 
necessity for enlargement thereby created, devote a portion of 
the public funds to the erection of permanent, handsome build- ~ 
ings at.its State University. ~ 
‘We, therefore, earnestly petition your honorable body to.ap- 
point a committee from your number to investigate this matter . 
and report to you what ought and can be done to begin this im- 
portant work of rebuilding. 
We would also warmly indorse the petition made in the re- 
port of the President accompanying this, with regard to the en- | 
dowment of the new Teachers’ Department and the establish- 
ment of a number of scholarships therein. This Board has no 
special funds for the support of this department, and can use . 
none of its special appropriations for this purpose. Some . 
assistance of this kind is necessary if the new department does. 
all it ought to do for Tennessee teachers. If you see proper to 
make the appropriation of ten thousand dollars annually there 
asked for, we pledge ourselves, in consideration thereof, to 
establish and maintain the thirty-three scholarships, éach good 
for free tuition and one hundred dollars per annum for two. 
- years in the Teachers’ Department. 
The reports of the President, officers, and professors are ap- 
pended, and will give you complete information regarding the 
details of the management of the institution in its various de- 
partments.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT. 
  
To the Honorable the Board of Trustees: 
I have the honor to submit this report on the present con- 
dition and needs of this University, and to append thereto the 
reports of the heads of the several departments of instruction. 
The University is at present organized in four departments, 
viz.: 
ACADEMIC. DEPARTMENT. . 
The Faculty of the Academic Department, which includes the. 
Agricultural and Mechanical College, consists of a President, 
professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and in- 
structors. It comprises the following schools : 
1. School of Ancient Languages, with one professor and one 
instructor. 
2. School of English and Modern Languages and Literature, 
with two professors and one instructor. 
3: School of Mathematics and Civil Engineering, with two 
professors and one assistant professor. 
4. School of Mechanical Engineering and Physics, with two 
professors and one instructor. 
5. School of General and Analytical Chemistry and Metal- 
lurgy, with one professor. 
6. School of Agricultural and Organic Chemistry, with one 
professor. . 
7. School of Agriculture, with one professor. 
8. School of Botany and Horticulture, with one professor 
and one instructor. 
9. School of Biology and Zoology, with one professor. 
(24)
-P-A-G-E-326
— 25 — 
10. School of Military Science and Tactics, with one pro- 
fessor. 
‘This Faculty consists, thus, of a President, ten professors, 
three associate professors, one assistant professor, and six in- 
structors—twenty-one in all. 
The chief changes made since our last biennial report are: 
The strengthening of the School of Mechanical Engineering 
and Physics by the election of a superintendent of shops in ad- 
dition to a professor of mechanical engineering, the election of 
an assistant professor of pure mathematics, and the addition of 
an instructor in English, practical agriculture and horticulture, 
each. The list of the Faculty of this department and of the 
other departments is appended to this report. 
It will be interesting to notice the institutions represented in 
the present corps of instruction of the Academic Departmen 
and the Agricultural Experiment Station. The following uni- 
versities are represented among its professors, instructors, and 
officers: German universities (Leipzig and Goettingen), two; 
University of Virginia, five; Johns Hopkins University, one; 
Cornell University, two; University of Tennessee, five; Wash- 
ington and Lee University, one; West Point, one; United 
States Naval Academy, one; Maine State College, one; Michi- 
gan Agricultural College, one; Pennsylvania State College, one. 
Law DepartMENT. 
A Department of Law was established in the University on 
the first of January, 1890. It is located in Knoxville, in imme- 
diate connection with the Academic Department. It is to be 
noted that this is a separate department in the University, and 
not a school in the Agricultural and Mechanical College. It 
has a financial basis entirely distinct from this college. Hon. 
Thos. J. Freeman, ex-Justice of the Supreme Court of Tennes- 
see, is Dean and Professor of Law. He haa sole charge of the 
instruction for the present. Other professors and instructors 
will be elected as they are needed. .
-P-A-G-E-327
— 26 — 
Teacuers’ DEPARTMENT, 
The teachers’ course announced for the session of 1889-’90, 
proved a sufficient success to justify the organization of a @is- 
tinct department of instruction for this class of students. The 
Board of ‘Trustees have recently, therefore, elected Prof. Frank 
M. Smith, for two terms Superintendent of Public Instruction 
for Tennessee, Principal of a new department, to be known as 
the Teachers’ Department of the University of Tennessee, and 
which will be opened regularly on the twelfth of February, 
1891. This department is also located at the University, and 
will stand in intimate relation with the Academic Department. 
As the finishing school, and in this sense the head of the 
public educational system of the State, the University has a 
duty to discharge in regard to the public schools. The greatest 
question in the State now is the education of the masses of the 
people. The greatest question connected with the common 
schools is how to obtain an adequate supply of competent 
teachers. All classes of our people are deeply interested in 
these questions, but more especially “the industrial classes,” 
with whose education our college is particularly charged by 
law, as it is chiefly through the public schools that they can 
hope to secure the preparatory education necessary to reach 
the University. 
_ Of the more than six thousand public school-teachers in Ten- 
nessee, at least two-thirds are working earnestly to obtain a 
good education, either by private study or by teaching school, 
and attending school or college, alternately. Many teach in the 
common schools during the’ fall, and go to school themselves 
during the winter and spring, keeping this up until they com- 
plete their education. They form a large, earnest, and industri- 
ous class of students in all our higher schools, and among them 
will be found many leading spirits of the future. The history 
of popular education shows that no disadvantage of birth or 
station, and no measure of penury or destitution, can chain the 
young life down which has developed the aspiration and the’ 
strength to lift itself out of the darkness of ignorance into the 
light of a liberal education. |
-P-A-G-E-328
— 27 — 
- The State University has thus an important duty to perform 
in relation to the schools, and the opportunity to accomplish 
great ends in the better education of these young teachers. 
_ As will be seen from an examination of the course, this is in 
no sense a normal department. Our teachers have already, in 
the various normal schools, colleges, and institutes, sufficient 
opportunity for that kind of training, if they want it. The 
purpose of the University is to advance knowledge, and the 
object of this course is to stimulate its students to seek a com- 
plete, liberal education. It is hoped that many of them will 
take a full college and university course. 
A due proportion of professional training is provided as a 
‘part of their education, but in every thing the thorough de- 
velopment of the man in all his powers will be the object aimed 
at, and not merely his training to perform a few professional 
processes. Even the work on the common school branches has 
for its object the perfection of the teacher-student himself in 
these subjects. The best teacher is, as a general rule, he who 
was best taught. For the “easy ways,” the short courses lead- 
ing to long degrees, the mechanical methods, and the mere 
devices in teaching, we have no place here. We open this new. 
department of instruction in the hope that it may introduce 
many of these earnest students into a course of liberal educa- 
tion, while it makes their labors on the arduous road they travel 
more intelligent and profitable. 
Mepicat anp Dentat Department. 
The Medical and Dental Schools of the University are located 
at Nashville, Tennessee... The Faculty for this department is 
organized with a President, fifteen professors, and three demon- 
strators. The department is giving full courses of instruction 
in medicine and dentistry, leading to the degrees of Doctor of 
“Medicine and Doctor of Dental Surgery. It owns an excellent, 
well-equipped building, and has ample facilitics for class in- 
struction and clinical work.

AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION. 
This is a department of the Agricultural and Mechanical 
College of the University of Tennessee, and is designed to con- 
duct research in the sciences connected with agriculture, while 
the college gives the instruction in the same subjects. It is or- 
ganized with a director and four chiefs of divisions. Prof. F. 
Lamson-Scribner (professor of botany and horticulture in the 
University), was elected director and took charge of the Station 
on the first of July, 1890. The divisions are as follows: 
1. Division of Chemistry, in charge of Dr. C. W. Dabney, 
Jr., with one assistant. 
2. Division of Botany and Hortieultare, in charge of the di- 
rector, with one assistant. 
38. Division of Field and Feeding Experiments, i in charge of 
the professor of agriculture in the college (a position tempo- 
rarily vacant), Mr, P. F. Kefauver, the agriculturist of the 
Station, and instructor in practical agriculture in the college, 
has charge of thig division at present. 
4, Division of Entomology, in charge of Prof. H. E. Sum- 
‘mers, consulting entomologist. 
Under a new arrangement, the Experiment Station has entire 
charge and direction of the experimental farm, the green-house, 
and the horticultural grounds. It has its own laboratories for 
each of the divisions in a separate building on the University 
grounds. It is believed that the Station is now in better condi- 
tion than ever to advance agricultural science and to serve the 
farmers of the State. Its report will be submitted to the Gov- 
ernor separately, but some idea of the important work done 
may be gathered from the following publications made during 
the two years ending January 1, 1891: 
BULLETINS FoR 1889.—voL. 1.

Knoxvintr Counrer. 
Separate accommodation and instruction is provided, in ac- 
cordance with the law, for colored appointees to the Agricultu- 
ral and Mechanical College, at Knoxville College. An equita- 
ble share of the new appropriation under the’Morrell Act, has 
been set aside by the Board of Trustees, for the purpose of
-P-A-G-E-331
— 80 — 
' further improving the facilities for instruction in agriculttre 
and mechanic arts at this college. The instruction given in the: 
past has been in accordance with the law, and equal to all the 
demands of the limited number of students; but this instruc, 
tion will be improved now in the same proportion in which it 
has been improved in the other departments of the University, 
Funds have been secured for the erection of a special building 
for laboratories and shops, which is expected to be ready early . 
in the spring. When this building is ready the Board of Trus- 
tees will equip it with apparatus, instruments, machinery, and 
tools, and will then engage two additional instructors for the 
exclusive benefit of this department. One of these instructors 
will take charge of the work in chemistry and practical agri- 
culture, and the other will give instruction in physics, and have 
charge of the shops and drawing-rooms. 
Buinpines anp EquipMENt. 
A large and handsome building, to be called “ Science Hall,” 
a cat of which accompanies this report, is now being erected on 
the University grounds for the accomodation of the Schools of 
Chemistry, Pliysics, Civil and Mining Engineering, especially. 
It will contain a very complete chemical laboratory, consisting of 
fifteen separate apartments, and comprising distinct laboratories 
for qualitative and quantitative analysis, assaying, and photog- 
raphy. Especial attention is being paid to the ventilation and 
lighting of these laboratories, which will also be handsomely 
furnished and thoroughly equipped with the very best apparatus. . 
The building will contain a physical laboratory of nearly equal 
extent; a laboratory for mineralogy and economic geology, and’ 
@ museum in these subjects; lecture-rooms, drawing-rooms, and 
instrument-rooms for civil engineering; a large public hall; 
halls for the literary societies; offices for the President, and a 
number of lecture-rooms. The first cost of the building will 
exceed $50,000, and its complete equipment will require $20,000 
additional, 
The Young Men’s Christian Association of the University, 
assisted by members of the faculty and their friends in Knox- 
ville and throughout the State, have raised a fund for the erec-
-P-A-G-E-332
— 31 — 
‘tion of a handsome building for the Association. The Board 
of Trustees of the University have given the Association the 
use of a convenient site on College Hill, and made a liberal sub- 
scription toward the gymnasium which will be connected with 
it.’ This building was commenced in July, 1890, and is now 
rapidly approaching completion. It will be a fully equipped 
College Association building, and will contain, in addition to 
a large gymnasium, a room for religious meetings, a reading- 
room, bath-rooms, barber-shop, and large rooms for various. 
other forms of healthful recreation. It will undoubtedly do 
much to promote the work of this excellent Association in the 
religious and moral development of the students. 
As soon as this gymnasium is completed an instructor in 
physical culture will be employed, and a regular course of in- 
struction and exercises provided. The gymnasium and the 
classes for this instruction will be open to all students of the 
University under proper regulations. 
Improvements have gone steadily forward in the Mechanical 
Department. About seven thousand dollars’ worth of ma- 
chinery and tools have been added since our last report. This 
school is now thoroughly well equipped for practical and ex- 
perimental work in wood, iron, and steel. We have now the 
following well-furnished, separate shops: 
Shop for hand-work in wood; shop for turning and model- 
making; shop for wood-working machines; blacksmith shop; 
machine shop for work in iron, steel, and brass, and so on. 
There are two large drawing-rooms, a room for blue-prints, 
one for apparatus, etc., and a separate dry-kiln. The drawing- 
rooms have been recently out-fitted with the Worcester Institute 
pattern of drawing-tables. 
A complete system of electric lighting has been introduced, 
and incandescent lights have been put into all the dormitories 
and public rooms. The dynamos are located in the mechanical 
department, and add considerably to the facilities for instruc-
-P-A-G-E-333
— 32 — 
tion already provided there. A system of electric bells now 
connects all of the buildings, and a system of electric time will 
soon be introduced. . 
The School of Civil Engineering has been still further. 
equipped by the addition of a number of engineering instruments 
and a testing machine. 
Although the funds are still very inadequate for this purpose, 
more money was expended last year in providing books for the 
library than ever before in the history of the institution. We 
very much need a larger fund and a separate fire-proof building 
for the library. 
All of the older buildings have been again completely over- 
hauled and thoroughly repainted and repaired. ‘I'hey are in as 
good a condition as they can be possibly put in. 
, Lhe equipment of the Schools of Botany, of Zoology, and of 
Chemistry has been still further improved. 
The Military Department has received its share of new equip- 
ment, and is now completely furnished with every thing that it 
can use in the way of arms and accoutrements. 
Accrepitep Hieu-scnoots AND ACADEMIES. 
A system of associated or accredited high-schools and 
academies has been inaugurated, under which it is hoped the 
University will get a much better prepared class of students. 
The Faculty of the University are doing every thing in their 
power to establish and encourage high-schools throughout the 
State, and hope through this means to be able to steadily ad- 
vance the standard required for admission. The plan is as fol- 
lows: 
1. Any high-school, academy, or other institution preparing 
young men for university, whose course of study covers the 
branches required for admission to the Freshman Class of the 
Collegiate Department of this University, may be put on an ac-
-P-A-G-E-334
— 33 — 
credited list of such schools, after application, examination 
by some officer of the University, and approval by the Faculty. 
2. The graduates or proficients, duly recommended by the 
principals of such schools, will be received into the Collegiate 
Department of the University without further examination. 
3. One free scholarship in the Collegiate Department is 
given to each of the schools thus accredited, to be awarded by 
its principal to the best graduate or proficient applying and 
qualified for admission. 
The principals of the schools are invited to correspond with 
the President of the University with reference to the accredited 
lists and these scholarships. The list of such schools will be 
published in the Annual Report and Catalogue of the Univer- 
sity. They will be recommended to intending patrons of this 
institution.

It is too early yet to give any facts in regard to the attendance 
for the current year, more than to say that the number jin all 
departments has been increased as compared with the same time | 
the previous session. This is quite gratifying in respect to ‘the 
Academic Department especially, since the standard for admis- 
sion to that department was raised considerably at the opening 
of ‘the present session. The attendance upon the new Law 
Department is already double what it was last term. 
State ScHOLARSHIPS. 
The State has established two hundred and seventy-five 
scholarships in the Collegiate Department of the University, 
the Agricultural and Mechanical College of the State, which 
secure the appointees free tuition. 
The method of appointment to these scholarships is, briefly, 
as follows (the Code, Sections 327 to 329): 
The State Superintendent issues notices to the County and 
City Superintendents in the month of May of each year, requir- 
ing them to hold examinations of candidates for appointments 
in their respective counties or cities, and giving directions as to 
these examinations. 
The County and City Superintendents are required to -give 
public notice and to hold such examinations as may be neces- 
sary during the month of June. From the list of candidates 
. found qualified and numbered in the order of merit, each State 
Senator and Representative can appoint two young men to 
scholarships in the University. State Senators and Representa- - 
tives can appoint other persons not on this list, but in doing so 
they take the responsibility for their preparation. The students 
thus appointed must be at least fifteen years of age, and pre- 
pared to enter regular collegiate classes as described above. 
Senators and Representatives are requested to make their ap- 
pointments subject to these competitive examinations of appli- 
cants by the County or City Superintendents of Public Schools. 
In order that no worthy young men who pass these examina- ©
-P-A-G-E-337
— 36 — 
tions shall fail to get the advantages of the University, the 
President is authorized by law to appoint such qualified candi- 
dates to any vacancies which may remain to be filled in any 
county or district on the tenth of August of each year. There 
has been great irregularity in the appointment of State students 
in the past.

The newly elected Representatives and Senators are. entitled 
to make appointments to fill the vacancies existing. Such 
students can enter-at the opening of the second term, February 
12, 1891." The number seeking these appointments is far éx- 
ceeding those applying for them in previous years, and the’in- 
dications are that they.will be all taken up soon after the open- 
ing of the second term. Representatives and Senators are re- 
spectfully invited to correspond with the President of the 
University upon this subject. 
APPRENTICESHIPS. 
For the purpose of encouraging young men to take the 
industrial courses, and of assisting indigent students in making 
their expenses while attending college, a number of apprentice- 
ships have been established. in connection with the Agricultural 
and the Mechanical Departments. They are awarded to merito- 
rious students who have shown by their work at the University 
that they are worthy, and yield from six to fifteen dollars per 
month, according to the diligence and efficiency of the young 
men holding them. Four of these apprenticeships are awarded 
to students in the Agricultural Course, and four to students in 
the Mechanical Engineering Course. Students in the Agricult- 
ural Course live and board at the farm, and combine class in- 
struction with farm practice. These apprentices are given 
improving work in the line of their studies, for which they are 
paid by the hour. In addition to these regular appointments, a 
great deal of work at the college farm, in the shops, and about 
the buildings and grounds, is given out to students. They are 
encouraged to do every thing possible to aid themselves and to 
acquire practice and skill, Students, or recent graduates, hold 
nearly all of the minor positions—as assistants, instructors, etc. 
There were in all, during the last year, some forty young men 
who aided themselves very materially in paying the expenses 
of their education by work while here. The University and 
connected departments paid out to them about four thousand 
dollars. 
In this connection should be mentioned the students’ private 
messes. Two of. these have been organized, and have proved a
-P-A-G-E-340
— 39 — 
great success. The University supplies the rooms, furniture,” 
and cooking utensils, and the young men organize themselves in 
elubs and elect their manager, who conducts the business on a 
mutual plan. The expenses of an individual, boarding in these 
clubs, has ranged between one dollar and one-half and two dol- 
lars per week. 
We are greatly gratified to be able to say that the advantages 
of the University are now within-the reach of the poorest young 
man in our State, who has the capacity and energy to prepare 
himself for admission, and to work for self-support. The ex- 
penses of a collegiate student, attending the University for a 
full session of nine months, living upon the most economical 
plan, need not exceed $175. What young man cannot earn this 
much? When they have attended one session, we find that 
they are always able to earn more than they did before, and 
so they go on to complete their course by teaching school, or 
following some other pursuit, and going to college each alter- 
nate year. We have a great many students who are doing this. 
In this connection, let me say to those who are benevolently in- 
clined, that we know of no more fruitful means of doing good 
than by establishing a number of scholarships in this institution 
yielding from one to two hundred dollars per year, to be paid to 
worthy young men seeking an education, or to supply means 
for completing a course of instruction, which would. be paid 
back with interest, after the course has been completed. , As. it 
is, no worthy young man, prepared to utilize the opportunities 
offered here, has ever been tarned away from this institution 
for want of the means of support. | 
GovERNMENT. 
The government of the students in the Collegiate Department 
of the University has been carried on according to the military 
plan for fifteen years past-and up to the opening of the present 
session. The students were organized.by companies, each com- 
pany occupying a dormitory... The College was, thus, a military 
garrison, under the command of a commandant and his staff of 
cadet officers. So long as the Preparatory Department wus the 
largest one connected with the University, and the students 
j
-P-A-G-E-341
— 40 — 
were, at least the large majority, young and untrained, this sya — 
tem was found to be the best one for governing them. After 
the abolition of the Preparatory Department and the elevatitn 
of the standard of admission, this system of government be- 
came not merely unnecessary but decidedly obstructive. The 
experience everywhere has been that such a system of govern- 
ment is totally inconsistent with true university life and work. 
It was decided by the Board of Trustees, therefore, that the 
military system of government should be dispensed with at the 
close of the last session, and that the ordinary system of Amer- 
ican college and university government should be substituted 
for it at the opening of the current session in September. - Mil- 
itary instruction and drill is maintained as heretofore, but the 
government of the students was placed in the hands of the 
Dean of the College instead of the Commandment of Cadets. 
The new system went into force without friction or jar, and 
is working smoothly. It is greatly to the credit of our student- 
body that they have passed, almost without a particle of confu- 
sion or disorder, from a system of government by limitations 
and restrictions to a system of government based wholly upon 
the appeal to their honor and good sense. Under the new plan 
every student is made at once to feel that he is expected to be 
a gentleman in all relations and associations, to be diligent in 
study and prompt and regular in attendance on all prescribed 
duties, giving careful attention to whatever is required of him. 
The students who fail to come up to this standard, or who in- 
dulge in gross vices of any kind, or persist in disorder, rude- 
ness, or boisterous conduct, are. promptly excluded from! the 
University. The success already obtained under the new sys- 
tem is highly gratifying. 
Neeps. 
One of the most pressing needs of the University is better 
and more ample farm buildings. We should havea buildingyor - 
buildings, on the farm to accommodate the professor of agricwhts 
ure, the agriculturist of the Station, and all of the agricultiral 
students. As it is, we have only one small cottage and a few 
outlying rooms, A single large building should be erected at
-P-A-G-E-342
_—41— 
" the earliest day possible, to contain apartments for the professor 
of agriculture and family, apartments for the agriculturist, 
offices and work-rooms for these officers, and a number of 
dormitories for the students. The existing farm building is 
always crowded with students. They are very anxious to live 
on the farm, as they can then get more work and perform it 
moreconveniently. We feel certain that we could fillevery room 
you will provide. If it were possible to make room for all of 
our special agricultural students, it would do more than any 
thing else that we can think of to promote the interest in that 
course. 
The farm also needs better barns and out-buildings. We 
should have a single large modern barn, conveniently arranged 
and substantially constructed, so as to be a model for the study 
of farmers. Twelve thousand dollars would be a fair estimate 
of the cost of these buildings, and it is earnestly hoped that the 
General Assembly will feel able at an early day to provide them. 
The new appropriation made to agricultural and mechanical 
colleges makes it. possible for us to expand the course and im- 
prove the facilities for instruction in the sciences pertaining to 
agriculture and the mechanic arts, the English language, and 
the other subjects named in the act, to a considerable extent; 
but we find ourselves hampered very much by the need of aca- 
demic buildings also. The new Science Hall will accommodate 
‘several departments very well, but, as explained above, it is 
already fully occupied by the Schools of Physics, Chemistry,. 
Civil Engineering, Mineralogy, Geology, etc. The University 
needs a new academic building for the instruction in languages, 
literature, mathematics, and for new schools that may be added. 
The old buildings erected between 1830 and 1870 were very 
poorly planned. We are very much cramped for want of large 
rooms in which to hold our lectures and recitations in mathe-° 
matics, modern languages, English, Latin, etc. Instruction in 
these subjects has to be given, at present, in small rooms, 
originally designed for dormitories. Any farther increase im 
numbers, such as we must expect, will render it impossible to 
‘carry on this instruction in such quarters. We already, in
-P-A-G-E-343
  — 42 — 
many cases, have sections of forty or fifty meeting for recitations © 
in rooms not exceeding twenty by twenty feet. . This is ‘alr 
together wrong from the hygienic and every other stand-point, 
and should not be permissible in an institution like ours. Every 
visitor to the University grounds agrees that these old buildings 
are totally out of harmony with the magnificent location, and 
the requirements of such an institution. They should be. re- 
placed by a single grand building, worthy of the noble situation 
and of the great State which it would represent. An appropri- 
ation of fifty thousand dollars a year, for two years, should be 
made at once to begin the erection of a great academic bnilding 
to accommodate these overcrowded departments, and to form the 
central architectural figure in a group of noble buildings, crown- 
ing the top of the superb eminence which forms our College 
Hill. . 
All of the other departments of the University are crowded 
beyond the conditions for good work. The Mechanical Depart- 
ment needs a large addition for machine-shops, testing labora- 
tories, etc. The want of a building to contain it is the only 
thing that prevents us now fromm establishing a School of Vet- 
erinary Medicine. The largé and growing library demands ¢ a 
separate fire-proof building for its preservation. 
The Teachers’ Department should certainly commend itself 
to the people of the State and the General Assembly, since it 
affords free tuition to the teachers of the public and. other 
schools scattered throughout the entire State. These schools 
are the foundation of our entire educational system, including 
all the colleges and private institutions of learning, as well as 
the State University, and are of the greatest interest to.the 
masses of our people. 
This department, which can only receive a very limited; sup- 
port from the fund set apart for the academic courses, should 
have several. additional professors.. Its students deserve to be 
aided, also, by scholarships, in addition to free tuition. It 
would be an exceedingly wise policy to establish a number.of 
scholarships, worth one hundred dollars.each, per annum, for -.

two years, to be awarded to the most meritorious teachers from 
different sections of the State needing assistance. The General 
Assembly should be petitioned to make an annual appropriation 
of $10,000 to be spent in the support of the additional instruct- 
ors, and in maintaining these scholarships in this department. 
Should this appropriation be made, we would, I think, be able 
to award one of these scholarships to each senatorial district in 
the State, making thirty-three in all. 
‘Your attention to these matters is earnestly requested. 
I have the honor to hand you herewith the reports of the 
officers and heads of departments and schools in the University, 
and to ask your careful consideration of them. 
Iam, with great respect, your obedient servant,

REPORT OF THE DEAN.   
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dsar Siz—In submitting my report through you to the 
Board, I beg to refer, for detailed information of the various 
departments of the college, to the reports of the respective pro- 
fessors. 
ConpITIONS FOR ADMISSION. 
As you know, two demands are made upon us almost diamet- 
rically opposite: One, that we shall erect such a standard for 
admission as would practically exclude from the benefits of the 
University the large majority of the students from Tennessee, 
for whom our contract with the State requires us to provide ; 
the other, that we shall admit any student of good character 
who can pass upon the ordinary subjects of the public schools. 
It is clear that it is a great waste for the men and equipment 
of a University to be trammeled by work that might as well be 
done by an academy or training school, and that college profes- 
sors would greatly prefer to accept only such material as their 
work properly calls for. On the other hand, is it just for the 
benefits, primarily, though not exclusively, intended for the 
great agricultural.and other industrial classes, to be placed be- 
yond their reach? It is true that these classes wish, and should 
have, the opportunity for the advanced instruction in the lib- 
‘eral as well as the industrial arts. They would not, and they 
should not, consent to any thing less than the best for their 
sons. But it is not realized that the equipment, including men 
and outfit, for advanced technical instruction is far more expen- 
sive than for ordinary collegiate work; uor is it realized’ that 
the demands for both, and covering too the ground from the 
lowest to the highest in both, is a very difficult one to meet. I 
am very sure that the corps of teachers is anxious, us far as 
possible, to secure the greatest good to the greatest number.
-P-A-G-E-346
— 45.— 
The requirements for admission are: 
In English—A good working knowledge of English gram- _ 
mar and composition, geography, and United States history. 
In Mathematics—Arithmetic, algebra as far as quadratic 
equations, and the first three books of geometry. 
In Latin, if that course is taken—A knowledge of the forms, 
inflections, etc., with the elementary principles of. syntax, and 
ability to read the simpler prose writers. 
If an applicant succeeds in entering on two of the three sub- 
jects, he is admitted and allowed to make the other up under 
an instructor provided, and with no additional expense. 
AccREDITED ScHOOLS. - 
It was determined to select a number of training schools of 
known fitness to be placed upon an accredited list, and the cer- 
tificates of which were to be accepted in lieu of entrance exam- 
inations. The success of the movement in the short time it has 
been on trial has been very gratifying. If the whole system of 
public instruction could be organized so as to have at least one 
such graded or accredited school in each county, with uniform 
or nearly uniform requirements, and appointments were made 
from the county to the University only from young men who 
could meet those requirements, an immense gain would accrue 
to the University, the public’schools, and the whole people. 
Some such correlation of the University to the rest of the pub- 
lic school-system ought to be effected as soon and as rapidly as 
possible. : 
SELECTION or Work. . 
On this subject two general methods, more or less modified, 
are in vogue in this country. The one is to leave the choice of 
subjects to the student, and the other is to require all to follow 
‘a prescribed curriculum. It has seemed to us that the benefits 
of both are secured and the. objections to both obviated in a 
large measure by the plan of one or.two of our leading institu- 
tions, notably the Johns Hopkins University, in their collegiate
-P-A-G-E-347
— 46 — 
department. That plan is to arrange a number of courses of 
about equal educational value, and yet of such variety as to af- 
ford ample scope to individual tastes and aptitudes, leaving the 
student free to choose his course with a view to his avocation in 
life, but determining for him the subjects proper to that course 
and the order in which they shall be taken. This is our method. 
A still further option is allowed the student on many subjects 
of the junior and senior classes of all the courses. 
Courses or Stupy. 
Of these there are seven in the college, viz.: Literary-scien- 
tific, Latin-scientific, Agricultural, Chemical, Mechanical En-. 
gineering, Mining Engineering, and Civil Engineering. Except 
the Latin, the work allotted to the Freshman Class is the same 
for all. . . 
: Spzcra, STUDENTS. 
As a further concession to liberty of choice, young men, not 
under twenty-one years of age, and limited in time, are allowed 
to select their work from different courses subject only to their 
degree of preparation and the schedule for lectures. 
Of the 284 student in the Academic Department, 91 were in 
the Latin-scientific Course; 67 in the Literary-scientific; 33 in, 
the Civil Engineering; 18 in the Mechanical Engineering; 9 in. 
the Agriculttral, and 5 in the Chemical. : Thirteen were special 
and unclassified. Of these 208 were from Tennessee, 26 from 
other States. 
GOVERNMENT. 
The most marked change in the policy, of the University has 
come to this department. As the scope of the University 
widened, it became more and more apparent that it would have 
to release itself from the military forms and routine of. dis- 
cipline. . These and its other work were so often running 
counter to each other, in their demands upon the student’s time 
and attention, that complications, impairing the efficiency of 
both, were unavoidable. A military government, to be effective; 
must touch at every point, and know no compromise. A semi- 
military government is approved nowhere. :
-P-A-G-E-348
— 47 — 
It has been deemed best, therefore, to limit the military 
feature to the requirements of the law and to commit the dis- 
cipline to other hands. The plan of the present government 
is: To insist rigidly upon punctual attendance at every ap- 
pointed exercise; to exact the work assigned; to leave the 
student free from set rules, and substitute in their place an ap- 
peal to his sense of propriety; and to exclude promptly, with 
or without specific charge, those to whom such appeal shall 
prove vain. It is hoped by this method.to secure to the young 
men who come here, that high, if not supreme, end of all train- 
ing and all discipline—self-control. The responsiveness of the 
students to our appeal thus far foretokens a gratifying success. 
_ In closing my report it gives me great pleasure to add that 
entire harmony prevails in the Faculty, and that cordial rela- 
tions are sustained in both personal and official capacity. 
'’ Respectfully submitted, 
. T. W. Jorpan, 
Dean.

REPORTS OF SCHOOLS. 
  
I. SCHOOL OF LATIN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE: 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Sin—I have the honor to submit to you the following 
report of this department: 
Number of students enrolled in the school and the classes to 
which they were assigned— 
Sub-Freshman .. -. -- 2... ee ee 25 
Freshman... . 2 eee ee 20 
Sophomore .-.-.-- 2.2... ee eee 29 
Junior. - ee ee 4 
Senior... ee 5 
Total... - eee ee ee ee 93 
A comparison of this with the report made to you for the 
year ’88, when I took charge, will show a gratifying improve- 
“ment, especially in the more advanced classes. The senior class 
now starting numbers eight. 
I emphasize this point because it shows a breuking away 
from the unfortunate custom of spending only one or two years 
in college, and turning, before graduation, into business or pro- 
fessional pursuits. It is still general enough to be deplorable. 
A thorough and systematic study of the grammar is Continued 
through the whole course, and all the principles and laws. of 
the language are illustrated and emphasized by required written 
translations of Latin into English and English into Latin. 
Sight translations and rapid oral rendering of similar sentences 
in Latin, in order to facilitate the use of the language itself, will 
be continued. 
One term of the senior year will be given to a thorough study
-P-A-G-E-350
—49 — 
of a.limited portion of some one author. This year it will be 
Livy, Book XXI. As far as possible it is proposed to make 
this study exhaustive. The work will be divided among the 
members of the class, and that of each discussed by all in the 
elass-room. In addition to questions of syntax, style, history, 
etc., stress will be laid upon accurate, idiomatic translations, to 
be written, compared, and criticised and then re-written until 
the best attainable has been made. 
Iam glad to report satisfactory progress in all my classes, 
The standard is not yet what I should like to see it, but will be 
steadily raised. Respectfully submitted,

’ II, SCHOOL OF ENGLISH AND MODERN LANGUAGES. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Sir—The study of English is rapidly finding its proper 
place in the colleges and universities, and is gaining the im- 
portance it, for so many years, sought in vain. An institution 
with any pretension, that would fail to provide for a chair of 
English language and literature would now be considered an 
anomaly,-while fifty years ago one that did make such provision 
was a peculiar exception. Further, the recognized importance 
of this branch of learning has called for a.number of thoroughly 
trained and fully equipped instructors, and this demand the uni- 
versities, both at home and abroad, are striving to supply. But 
the demand still exists, and must grow stronger as the infusion 
of enthusiasm by these teachers will incite a responsive ardor 
in our high-schools and academies. As every new conquest in 
the field of learning opens up broader fields, so the work that 
has'been accomplished in the investigation of English reveals 
the still unexplored fields of both language and literature, and 
evinces the utter inability of any man to comprehend the whole 
sphere. Thus the division of labor becomes a matter of neces- 
sity, and soon our English chairs-‘must be divided not only iuto 
those of language and literature, but both of these must be. di- 
vided into periods, and in the latter, prose and poetry will come 
to be taught separately. As the use of English in spoken dis- 
4—App.C. : :
-P-A-G-E-351
—50— 
course will always remain of immeasurable value, and as effect- 
iveness of speech depends upon enunciation, emphasis, and ges- 
tures, as well as upon clearness of thoughts and aptness of ex- 
pression, thorough and rational instruction in voice culture and 
elocution is as necessary as the art of the dialectician or rhetor- 
ician. 
- What may be done, and in time must be done at this insti- 
tution to foster the study of our mother-tongue, is partially 
suggested in the above; what has been done is as follows: ‘ 
My able associate and colleague, Prof. T. C. Karns, who has 
entire charge of the Freshman and Sophomore work, has . 
divided it so as to throw the burden of the class drill and train- 
ing in the correct usage of English in the first year. The 
acquisition of correct and practical knowledge of English being 
the aim, close and minute study of the primary rules of com- 
position and rhetoric is demanded, and is supplemented by con- 
stant exercise in writing. This Jeaves him free in his second 
year to pursue a general course in English literature, which is 
based upon a text-book, but expanded by daily talks on the 
subject in hand, in which students are also directed in the 
selection of books from the library for private reading. Time 
is found, too, in this class for the perusal and discussion of some 
selected books. The junior class follows up this study of the 
history of the literature with a similar study of the history of 
the language, and then devotes the balance of the first term to 
the principles of written and spoken discourse. The second 
term is devoted to the study of poetry, first to an examination 
of the principles of poetical composition and their application, 
and then to special study ‘of selected authors—e. g., during this 
session to Shakespeare and Tennyson. During the entire 
session parallel reading will be assigned and required, and ex- 
ercises in original composition exacted. 
The Senior year, during the first term, is devoted to a general 
study of the lives and works of Chaucer and Shakespeare, and 
special study of selected portions of their writings. Prepara- 
tion is made for an intelligent study of Chaucer by several
-P-A-G-E-352
—51— 
weeks’ drill in Middle English forms, and the period between 
Chaucer and Shakespeare is covered by a series of talks to the 
class. The second term is taken up with a study of English 
prose and prose writers. : 
More elaborate essays are expected in this class, and the 
course of parallel redding is made more systematic. 
In addition to this, two courses are offered post-graduate 
students, one in Old English and one in literature and style. 
If time permit, a course of popular lectures on “The Develop- 
ment of English Literature” will be delivered, and to these the 
general public, including, of course, the whole student body, 
are admitted. : 
The course as mapped out is hampered by the fact, at present © 
unavoidable, but which should be corrected as soon as possible, 
that the professor of English also has charge of modern lan- 
guages, and hence is overburdened with class-work. 
. 2. Mopern Lanevaces. 
At present only two languages are taught in this department, 
French and German. The time will come, and it is hoped at 
no distant day, when there will be two chairs—one of Teutonic 
and another of Romanic languages—and then it will be possible 
to introduce the study of other languages, particularly Ttaltan 
and Spanish. 
GERMAN. 
As only two years are allotted to this branch, the work has 
been divided as follows: In the first year there is a thorough 
‘drill in the forms, a careful study of the grammar, with exer- 
cises in translating German into English, and constant exercises 
in translation, graded according to difficulty. In this year a 
brief sketch of German history is studied. 
In the second year the grammar and exercises are continued, 
but the chief work is the translation and interpretation of some 
of the masterpieces of German literature, and a study of the
-P-A-G-E-353
— 52— 
history of the literature, with particular references to the periods 
illustrated by the selections read. 
It is greatly to be regretted that there cannot be found time 
enough for more practice in speaking the language. As much 
attention is paid to this as is possible under the circumstances. 
FRENCH. 
The same general plan is pursued here as in German; the 
first year being given up to a drill in the forms, grammar, ex- 
ercises in writing and translation, and an introduction to the 
history. The second year is devoted to the translation and in- 
terpretation of masterpieces, and a special study of the Htera- 
ture of the periods selected. 
Special courses for post-graduate students are offered, as fol- 
lows: 
1. Advanced course in the interpretation of German master- 
pieces. 
2. Advanced course in the interpretation of French master... 
pieces. 
3. Advanced course in Gothic.

Dr. Chas. W. Dabneu, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
~ Dear Sir—In regard to my work at the University, I have 
the honor to submit to you the following report: 
The classes allotted to me take elementary rhetoric, general 
history, English history, English literature, psychology, and 
logic: One section in Freshman rhetoric is taught by Instructor 
E. M. Davis, 
The Freshman Class studies rhetoric during the fall term. 
Their work is of a practical character, embracing much in the 
use of capitals, punctuation, letter-writing, composition, and 
the formation of style. The design is to give students a work- 
ing knowledge of the English language. The class will take 
general history during the spring term. In this they will ac- 
quire a comprehensive view of the history of all ages, prepara- 
tory to special work later on. 
. he Sophomores take English history for the fallterm. They 
use Green’s Short History of the English People. The work 
this year is somewhat more advanced than that done by the 
corresponding class last year. After getting a general view 
from the text-book, special work in English history will be un- 
dertaken. The development of civilization, government, and 
literature is carried along with the military history of the 
nation. This study prepares for English literature, which comes 
in the spring term. In literature, the class will take a general
-P-A-G-E-355
— §4 — 
survéy, preparatory to special studies in the Junior and Senior 
years. 
The Senior Class in psychology consists of twelve young 
men. They take psychology three days in the week for five 
months. Their work includes something of the history of 
philosophy, and the views of eminent psychologists of the 
various schools of thought and investigation. The work is 
earried on from a practical stand-point. The bearing of psy- 
chology on education is especially impressed. The same class 
will take logic during the spring term. 
On account of their size, it has been necessary to hear the 
Freshman and Sophomore classes in sections. The Sophomores 
for last year numbered fifty-four, and the Freshmen about one 
hundred and fifteen. 
I have a good recitation-room, but lack suitable maps and 
charts, and a well-selected library of literary and historical 
works. A solar camera is also needed for illustrating history.

Some valuable engineering instruments were added to the 
equipment of the department during the session. This equip- 
ment is new very complete. Some of the instruments are of 
‘unusual excellence. The department stands in great need, 
‘however, of a testing machine. A testing machine has been 
ordered, and will be in place in a short time, for determining 
the strength, elasticity, etc., of wood, stone, iron, steel, etc., 
and of a smaller testing machine for mortars and cements. It 
also greatly needs samples of building materials, models, work- 
ing drawings, etc., of engineering structures and appliances. 
“The quarters assigned to the department in the building now 
“being erected will furnish every facility for instruction, draught- 
ing, the display of materials and models, and for keeping the 
engineering instruments in a manner both safe and accessible.

IV. SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND 
PHYSICS. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit the following report 
on the condition ofthe Mechanical Engineering School of this 
University: 
Since the publication of the last biennial report, the Mechan- 
‘ical Engineering School has’ materially improved. The school 
may be considered as divided into two parts, viz.: (1) That of 
theoretical mechanical engineering; (2): that. of mechanical 
drawing. 
1. Since the publication of the last biennial report, a thorough 
course of theoretical engineering has been established. This 
is conducted at. present principally by the use of text-books, 
and embraces, in the Junior year, kinematics, which treats of 
‘the various combinations which make up machines, together 
with the relative motions of the connected parts, and takes also 
into consideration, in various cases, the amount of work done 
and the energy transmitted by the various parts. Following 
this is the study of materials used in mechanical engineering, 
embracing their physical properties, their preparation, compo- 
sition and strength, together with the effects of modifying con- 
ditions, such as variations of temperature, frequency and period 
of strain, and the method of application of stress. In this con- 
nection I would urgently recommend the purchase by the Uni- 
versity at an early date of a 200,000-pound Olsen testing 
machine with automatic recorder, for use in the mechanical 
laboratory, which would prove not only to be a benefit to the 
students of the University, but would be used for commercial 
purposes in testing the material used in engineering con- 
structions in the neighborhood. In the Senior year the study 
of prime movers is taken up, together with various valve mo- 
tions and steam boilers. 
2. The study of drawing extends throughout the Mechanical 
Engineering Course, beginning in the Freshman Class with free- 
hand drawing, which is taught by means of general exercises
-P-A-G-E-358
—57— 
from the black-board, from blue-print copies, and from models. 
The work embraces a thorough training of the hand and eye in 
outline drawing, elementary perspective, and object drawing. 
This is followed by instruction in the use of drawing instru- 
ments, the construction of geometrical figures, projections, and 
other important details of the draughtman’s work. The me- 
chanical drawing proper is taken up in the Sophomore Class, 
and extends through the upper classes, beginning with making 
drawings from original sheets of the various parts of machin- 
ery, tracings, blue-prints, etc., and will extend through the va- 
rious parts of machinery and engines. Taught in connection 
with this, though a separate class, is a complete course of de- 
scriptive geometry, in the Sophomore year, in which the prob- 
lems are supplemented in each case by practical examples. 
Puysics. 
Instruction in physics is given in the Mechanical Engineering 
School three times a week throughout the year, maiuly by rec- 
itations from text-books, the object of this instruction being to 
familiarize the student with the elements of physics in its vari- 
ous branches. As but insufficient time can be given to this study 
where it is auxiliary to another department, it is earnestly rev- 
ommended that the Department of. Physics be established as a 
school of itself, and further, te embrace a complete physical lab- 
oratory, in which the student should be taught the use of the 
various instruments for the measurement of length, mass, and 
time; the testing of thermometers, the use of calorimeters and 
of the thermopile; to determine by the various methods the 
melting and boiling points, and the specific heat of substances ; 
‘also the use of the microscope .and spectroscope, the measure- 
ment of lenses and prisms, together with the other:experinients 
necessary to familiarize the student with the principles of optics; 
the adjustment and calibration of galvanometers and the verifi- 
‘dation of ‘the principles upon which the measureménts of eur- 
rent ‘electro-motive force and resistance are based, together with 
‘such other experiments as.are necessary for the student‘to famil- 
“tavize ‘Himself with work: ‘in electricity and ‘magnetism. 
“During ‘tthe second term of the present year an elementary
-P-A-G-E-359
— 58 — 
course in physics is to be given to all the Freshmen students of 
the University to enable them the more readily to comprehend 
the various scientific studies in the various courses. 
It is expected that a new laboratory will be provided for phys- 
ies in the new scientific building now being erected. The 
rooms set apart for this purpose are located in the south end of | 
the building and ground floor. These apartments are as fol- 
lows: Lecture-room, general laboratory, private laboratory, 
photometer-room, room for work in heat, and apparatus and 
supply-room. 
The laboratories will be well lighted and ventilated, and fur- 
nished with piers, cases, ete. The general laboratory, for in- 
stance, will have seven windows, and will get direct sunlight 
during the whole day. This laboratory will, it is hoped, be en- 
tirely complete and well furnished by the opening of the next 
session. Respectfully submitted,

_V. REPORT OF THE SCHOOL OF MECHANIC ARTS. 
EQuripMENT. 
+ Upon looking over the equipment of this department. after 
taking charge, the present instructor found that while it was 
far from being complete, all tools, with the exception of a few 
wood-turning lathes, were of the newest and best design and 
construction on the market. Even the machines included in 
the exception, while presenting no lines of beauty in design, 
answer their purpose fully as well. It is evident that much 
careand good judgment have been exercised in this department. 
There are now in the wood-working rooms all tools necessary 
to give instruction to a small number of students; enough 
more are ordered to give equally good opportunities to the 
number that are required to take this work. The power ma- 
chines now on hand are a planer, jointer, shaper, combined rip 
and cross-cut saw, borer, jig saw, roll turner, and fifteen lathes.
-P-A-G-E-360
— 59 —. 
.. In the blacksmith shop are six forges made by the well-known 
Buffalo Forge Company, fitted with blast and exhaust fans for 
furnishing air to the fire and carrying smoke away from it. 
_Each forge has an anvil and tools for the elementary exercises; 
the sets are to be completed by those receiving instruction in 
the more advanced work. 
The machine shop has a planer and drilling machine of Gould 
& Eberhart’s make, an emery grinder for sharpening tools, and 
benches with heavy vises to be used in fitting together the va- 
rious parts of machines under construction. Orders have been 
-placed for lathes, milling machines, and shaper, with their ap- 
pliances; a sensitive drilling machine and small emery grinder, 
both for small, accurate work; also a full line of taps and dies, 
reamers, and the other tools of primary importance for iron 
‘working. These tools will be in position, ready for use, in a 
few weeks. 
In the tool-room is a good stock of such tools as are intended. 
for general use in all the branches of work. 
Both the machinery and dynamos of 250 light capacity are 
run by the same engine and boiler; the latter also furnishes 
steam for heating the building either by exhaust from the en- 
gine or direct communication between boiler and heating pipes. 
Instruction. 
Wood-working.—Beginning with the saw and plane, the stu- 
dent must acquire considerable proficiency in their use at the 
simpler operations before taking up the making of a full set of 
joints and splices such as are used in architectural structures of 
wood; following this are the lathe turning, planing, shaping, 
boring, and sawing on the machines provided for these pur- 
poses, in order to gain skill in the use of power tools under all 
the conditions commonly met with in practice. The hand and 
eye now being trained enough to undertake more difficult work, 
cabinet and pattern-making are in order. In the latter work 
actual patterns are made, from which castings. of iron, brass, 
and.other metals and alloys can be molded for the metal- 
working exercises to follow.
-P-A-G-E-361
— 60 — 
Blacksmithing.—Exercises are given in forging and welding 
iron into various forms, quite difficult ones being made by the 
more skillfal students; forging steel into tools for use in the 
machine shop, tempering steel tools that have been made in the 
machine or blacksmith shop, to the degree of hardness required 
for the special use of each, according to its intended use on 
steel, iron, wood, or other material. 
Tron-working.—In the machine shop all skill previously 
gained in handling tools is put to use; chipping, filing, scrap- 
ing, drilling, turning, planing, ete., are taken up in regular 
order. A thorough training will be given on the universal - 
milling machine, in the making of straight and spiral drills, 
reamers, fluting taps, sawing metals, and as many more of the 
almost innumerable uses to which this machine may be applied, 
as the student’s time will admit. 
Those attaining sufficient skill early in this shop may under- 
take the construction of some standard article, as an engine or 
lathe, from rough castings and forgings either made in the 
shops or obtained from builders of the same; or better still will 
be the building of some machine after the student’s own design. 
It is hoped that a foundry will soon be in operation, so that an 
article may be designed, the patterns, castings, and forgings 
made, and the various parts assembled into a complete, useful 
machine, without the necessity of procuring any material ex- 
cept in the ordinary commercial form. 
The above is included in the Mechanical Engineering Coarse 
in full, while several of the other courses have a portion of it 
as required work. - In all the latter cases as large'a portiau of 
the prescribed course is taken up as is possible in the time 
allowed. 
-When the student has completed the entire course in addi- 
tion to the theoretical work in the Mechanical Engineering 
Course, he is prepared to take charge of work in any or all ef 
the lines included, using his theoretical knowledge in deter-
-P-A-G-E-362
—6bi— 
mining the correct principles and designs, and his practical skill 
for originating methods of construction and inspecting work 
to see that it is properly done. 
The chemical student, by taking the mechanical portion of 
his course, gains a skill in using tools sufficient to enable him 
to make many of the simpler forms of apparatus belonging to 
the chemical laboratory. 
The agricultural student becomes able to construct or repair 
agricultural implements and to direct the construction of the 
simpler buildings, or, at least, to. inspect them with a certainty 
of knowing whether the workmanship is good. 
Those taking not more than one term’s work learn to use the 
ordinary tools of the carpenter and wood turner, and are com- 
petent. to tell whether a workman in wood is doing his work 
correctly. 
Frez-Hanp Drawine. 
Instruction is given from designs on blackboard and paper, 
models, and nature, together with a few necessary lectures. 
’ Phe hand and eye are first trained from the flat copies on board 
and paper; the elements of perspective are then taken up suffi- 
ciently to give an understanding of how an outline drawing 
‘from a model, cast, or nature is made; outlining is then prac- 
ticed for a time; then shading is studied by lectures and prac- 
tice. The latter part of the work consists of making complete, 
‘shaded drawings from objects selected, as far as possible, in ac- 
cordance with the’university course pursued by the student. 
| It is expected that more copies, models, casts, and better 
desks will soon be provided for this work. The necessary in- 
struction can now be given, but it is at the expense of much 
- time and inconvenience. As soon as the new “Science Hall” 
is completed, the mechanical draughting-rooms will be removed 
' tot, leaving the space now occupied for this work to be used 
for free-hand instruction. Respectfully,

VI. SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY AND METALLURGY. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Str—The courses in chemistry, metallurgy, and assay- 
ing are arranged with special reference to the demands of stu- 
dents who wish to complete the courses leading to the degrees. 
in chemistry, civil and mining engineering. 
The work in the school is arranged and prosecuted for. three 
years under the following heads: 
GeENERAL CHEMISTRY. 
Sophomore Class.—In this class chemistry is commenced with 
the first term, and is continued throughout the year. The class 
is taught the elements of the subject, being fully illustrated by 
experiments. . 
Junior Class —The second year is given to a course in chem- 
ieal technology. 
ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. 
_ The instruction in this department begins in the second term 
of the Sophomore and extends throughout the Junior and Senior ~ 
years. 
Sophomore Class——The students in this class spend several 
hours each day at practical work. Each one is provided with a 
working table, apparatus, and chemical re-agents. The course: 
is begun with blow-pipe work. : 
Qualitative analysis is then taken up, and‘is taught by lect- 
ures and experiments, the student being required to repeat at 
his working table the tests for bases and acids which have been 
shown to him. 
He is then required to pass throngh a systematic course of 
qualitative analysis. 
Junior and Senior Classes. — Quantitative analysis constitutes 
the work of these classes.
-P-A-G-E-364
— 68 ~— 
The laboratory instruction is designed to be such as will pre- 
pare the student for the work in the varied chemical industries 
to which his attention may hereafter be directed. Particular 
stress is paid to the analysis and valuation of ores of the com- 
monly occurring metals, as well as to the products of most 
metallurgic operations. : 
Besides the course, there is the usual practice in the fire assay 
of the ores of lead and silver, of argentiferous and auriferous 
native compounds and artificial products, and in the docimastic 
‘valuation of the ores of the most prominent metals. 
A. short course in quantitative blow-pipe analysis will be 
given; also a course in determinative mineralogy. 
Special students may pursue, at their discretion, the study 
and analysis of any class of ores or metallurgic produets. 
‘Young men who have neither the time nor means to spare to 
take the full course, may accomplish much in the way of chem- 
ical analysis by devoting their entire time to it during the course 
of a single year. 
Special arrangements may be made for advanced and original 
work in chemistry. 
METALLURGY. 
Instruction in this subject is given by lectures and text-book 
work supplemented by laboratory practice. The principles of 
the furnace construction and of general metallurgic operations, 
are discussed throughout the course, and special illustrations 
are given of all the methods described. 
Excursions for the Senior Class have been arranged to the 
prominent metallurgic works in this and the adjoining States. 
This new feature promises to be an attractive and profitable one. 
In chemistry and metallurgy, much work has been planned 
which cannot be carried out with the present facilities. The 
present laboratory is so small that the Sophomore Class in an-
-P-A-G-E-365
— 64 — 
alytical chemistry has been divided into three sections. A new 
and. modern laboratory is in immediate and pressing need. 
Tur New Laporatory. 
A new Science Building is now in process of construction. 
In this building will be located the large and commodious chem- 
ical laboratories. On the first floor will be located the metal- 
lurgical and assay laboratories, photographic laboratory, lecture- 
room, preparation and dark-rooms. On the second floor will 
be located the quantitative and qualitative laboratories, balance- 
room and library, store-room, private laboratory and office; also . 
an open porch for the generation of acids and offensive gases. 
These laboratories will be commodious, well lighted, and thor- 
oughly ventilated by large stacks eighty feet in height. These 
very: high stacks will also be,used to carry off from the building 
offensive gases made during the course in chemical analy- 
sis. The laboratories will be supplied with all modern conven- 
iences and the best apparatus, such as will enable students to 
perform their chemical work under the most favorable cireum- 
stances possible. :

VII. SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURAL AND ORGANIC CHEM. 
ISTRY. 
The instruction in these subjects begins in the Junior year in 
the several courses. Students must have had the course in gen- 
eral chemistry before they can take either of the subjects ix in 
this school. 
1. Organic Cuzuterer, 
Junior Year.—Lectures, a systematic course; reference to 
Richter’s Organische Chemic; readings and explanations of the 
literature of the subject. There were six students in this class 
in 1889-90, and: there are three this session. 
2. AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY 
Begins in the 
Junior Year.—An advanced course of lectures’ on agricult- 
ural chemistry ;. chemistry of plants and plant productions; re-
-P-A-G-E-366
— 65 — 
lation of soil and air to plants; nutrition of plants from the 
soil and from the air; inorganic ingredients and ash analysis; 
physics of plants, mechanism of nutrition and movement. of 
sap; chemistry of the germination and development of plants, 
ete. Physics and chemistry of soils, their origin and classifica- 
tion ; movement of water in the soil, soil temperature, chemi- 
eal composition, relation to plant nutrition; soil analysis, meth- 
ods and significations of results; exhaustion of soils, mainte- 
nance and restoration of fertility; manures, kind, composition ; 
green manuring, farm-yard manures, saving, composting, use 
and value; commercial manures, their manufacture, analysis, 
and use. There were six students in this course during 1889-90. * 
Senior Year—A laboratory course in agricultural chemical 
analysis will be given to those who desire to become agrieult- 
ural chemists. The estimation of phosphates, potash, and nitro- 
gen. compounds by the different methods; the analysis of ashés, 
of soils, and feeding stuffs, etc.; experiment station chemical 
methods and calculations; original research. There is one stu- 
dent in this class this year.

VIII. SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Sir—I beg leave to submit the following report on the im- 
provements made in the Agricultural Department of the Uni- 
versity during the two years ending December 20, 1890. Dur- 
ing this period some valuable improvements have been made at 
the college farm. 
Buildings. —A new dairy building was completed July, 1889. 
This is a one-story building of wood, with brick basement 
twelve feet deep. It was constructed with special reference to 
this class of work, and cost a trifle less than $600 for the build- 
ing, exclusive of the labor of digging a dry cellar and cistern. 
The first floor is divided into two rooms, one forthe dairyman’s 
private room, and the other for the purpose of exhibiting dairy 
implements as they accumulate. The general work of the dairy 
5—App.C. 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
— 66 — 
is done in the basement. The cellar floor is grouted and ‘ce- 
mented, and it is so graded that it can be flushed with water 
and drained. The brick wall is eighteen inches thick, with an 
air cavity extending through its entire length and height. The 
wood-work resting upon the brick has four air cavities on all 
sides, there being from the inside, first, ceiling, next, three sep- 
arate partitions of heavy builder’s paper, fastened to inch and 
a half studding, and last and outside, ordinary clapboards or 
weatherboarding. The entire inside first floor, overhead and all, 
is tightly ceiled, there being a small attic with ventilators in each 
end. With these arrangements, by means of draft-spaces in 
" the inside of the cellar wall at the floor, a continuous current 
of air is carried up through the walls of the building. 
This dairy is giving great satisfaction to all concerned. It is 
light, cool, and sweet, and seems to meet all the requirements. 
The barns of the farm have been more or less improved. One 
of the outlying barns that had been used for stabling was shin- 
gled and improved inside, and now serves for a very good tool- 
room for large implements. The basement of the cattle-barn 
has been materially improved. The floors of about twenty stalls 
have been laid with brick-bats in cement; a dozen new stall 
stanchions and ties have been added; about two dozen mangers 
have been remodeled to prevent waste during feeding; a much 
needed grain-bin has been built against one end of the barn, the 
feed being put in overhead and taken out below, and the space 
between the two silos is now used for a feed-room. 
A new piggery has been built capable of holding from twenty- 
four to thirty-two pigs, according to size. The pig-house is 
fifty-six feet long, fourteen feet wide, and ten feet high on back 
side and six feet on front, and has eight separate pens and a 
grain and scale-room. An alley runs the length of the building, 
with each pen connected by a door. Hach pen is connected 
with an outside one six by ten feet in size. 
Live Stock. 
Jerseys.—The herd of Jersey cattle has been increased byt the 
purchase of five very fine and select Jersey cows, and by the
-P-A-G-E-368
— 67 — 
gift from Major Campbell Brown of: one very fine Jersey bull, 
which is hereby gratefully acknowledged. We now have 
twelve registered Jersey cows, and four grades in milk, two 
grade heifers, two bulls, and three bull calves. 
Holsteins.—The herd of Holsteins consists of two registered 
cows, and three grades in milk, one registered bull, eight grade 
heifers, two buli calves, and’ two steers. Total herd, twenty- 
- one cows in dairy, ten grade heifers, three bull calves, and two 
steers. A careful record is kept of the milk yield of each cow, 
each milking being weighed and recorded. : 
Horses.—The farm supports seven horses, two registered 
mares, four grades, and one common horse. 
Hogs.—A uniformly high class of Berkshire hogs are kept 
for experimental uses. 
Fencing—Much new fence has been built on the farm since 
the last report,and the appearance of the place has been greatly 
improved thereby. Much of this has been of barbed wire, 
with a rail on top, which is cheap and satisfactory. 
Crops.—The principal crops grown have been Irish and sweet 
potatoes, ensilage and fodder, corn, grass, clover, oats, rye, 
beets, with strawberries and roasting-ears for market. The 
most of the crops grown have been used for feeding the farm 
stock, and making milk and butter. Experimental work will 
be reported in the bulletins of the Experiment Station, which 
are sent free upon application. 
Implements—A new Deering mower, a horse rake, and two 
plows have been purchased. Also a Keystone hay loader has 
been presented by Mr. J. L. Thomas. The farm is well equipped 
with machinery. : 
- + Income.—The income from the farm is principally from. the 
‘sales of milk, butter, live stock, and potatoes. This has not 
been entirely satisfactory, but with the present arrangement we
-P-A-G-E-369
— 68 — 
confidently expect to publish a flattering balance-sheet with our 
next report. 
Agricultural Instruction —An instractor in practical agricult- 
ure has been added during this year. According to the present 
course of study, instruction in the sciences pertaining to agri- 
culture is provided in every class. AJ} of the students receive 
instruction in some of these sciences, and come under the in- 
fluences of the department to a greater or less degree. The 
number of special agricultural students during the session end- 
ing June, 1889, was forty-one. Besides the work in practical 
agriculture, these students have ample opportunity for study 
and practice in chemistry, botany, entomology, in shop-work, 
in wood, in blacksmithing, and practical horticulture. 
Needs.—The farm needs better buildings very much indeed. 
They would greatly aid the work of the professor of agriculture 
and the agriculturist. All of the students of this department 
could then live on the farm. A large residence building should 
be provided for these purposes. These facilities would aid all 
of these persons very much, but especially the students who 
have to work on the farm. A large model barn and other out- 
buildings are also much needed. Prof. Plumb’s report for the 
first year of this period (1888-89) has been freely used in pre- 
paring this biennial report. Very respecfully yours, 
[Signed] Paut F. Kerauver, 
Instructor in Practical Agriculture, in Charge. 
IX. SCHOOL OF BOTANY AND HORTICULTURE. 
Botany treats of plants, their specitic characteristics, their 
affinities with one another, their relation to soil and climate, 
their geographical distribution, their uses or the uses of their 
products, their influences upon climate and upon health, their 
origin, manner of growth and reproduction, their minute 
structure, chemical composition and processes of nutrition, their 
diseases and the conditions which favor or are unfavorable to 
their development—in fact, any and all questions that have to 
do with plants belong to the science of botany.
-P-A-G-E-370
. — 69 — 
The field for observation and acquisition of knowledge is a 
broad and fertile one, and, even with students of mature’ years, 
the work which can be done in an ordinary collegiate course 
must necessarily be limited in extent and elementary in char- 
acter. The mental training which the systematic prosecution 
of the study affords, however, is of the highest order, and it is 
especially suited to cultivate the powers of observation. If thé 
graduate has learned how to prosecute independent and original 
researches in any of the various branches of the sciences, all 
will have been accomplished that could be possibly expected, 
and the course has been planned with this end in view. Instead 
of adopting without reserve the “new method” of instruction, 
which consists in the exhaustive studyfof a few types, going 
into their minutest structure and physiology, or adhering solely 
to the old method, which is confined to the study of external 
forms, and the gaining of an acquaintance with the systematic 
relationship of the members of the plant kingdom, the two 
methods will be combined; beginning with the old, which is 
unrivaled for awakening an interest’in the subject, and proceed- 
ing to the second, which the student will then be prepared to 
pursue without pressure or discouragement. 
The course begins the second session of the Sophomore year 
with a general study of the structure and classification of cryp- 
togamic plants. The determination of species of phanerogams 
from the local flora, and the collection and preparation of speci- 
mens for the herbarium, are taken up. Text-books: Camp- 
pbell’s Structural and Systematic Botany, Gray’s Lessons and 
Manual. 
Continuing the course in the Junior year, types are selected 
from the chief groups of the vegetable kingdom, beginning 
with the lowest forms, and their development, reproduction, 
and minute anatomy, carefully studied. Some time is given to 
the identification of species of thallophytes, especially in the 
important groups of parasitic fungi. This work will necessi- 
tate the use of the compound microscope, and instruction in 
handling this instrument and in the use of microscopical | re- 
agents will be given.
-P-A-G-E-371
—0— 
Physiological botany is studied during the second half of the 
Junior year, and laboratory work in the investigation of the 
fungus diseases of plants is carried on as time permits. 
Special students and post-graduates are provided with’ facil- 
ities for prosecuting advanced work in systematic botany, in 
the study of grasses, vegetable histology, or plant pathology. 
Those in the agricultural course will be taught to recognize 
the useful plants, and to distinguish these from plants that are 
injurious, and to intelligently care for, in health and disease, 
the various field and garden crops. They will receive special 
instruction in grasses, and in the investigation of field and 
garden seeds. 
The students in mechanical and mining engineering who so 
desire, will be taught how to examine the minute structure of 
various woods, and investigate the decay of timber arising from 
the attack of fungi. 
During the course special subjects for research will be assigned 
to individual students, to be prosecuted under the direction of 
the professor. This will give the student a feeling of responsi- 
bility and an independence of thought and action that will in- 
spire interest and lead to practical methods of original work. 
Lecture-rooms are provided, and a well- lighted room, thirty 
by nineteen feet, supplied with gas and water, is now furnished 
for a working laboratory. 
The large and exceedingly valuable collection of native plants, 
made. during many years by Dr. Gattinger, of Nashville, was 
purchased by the Experiment Station, and is available to stu- 
dents. This collection numbers over 5,000 species, represented 
-by more than 12,000 specimens. These are all mounted and ar- 
ranged in a neatly constructed. case, each genus cover being 
numbered in accordance with Durand’s Index, thus enabling 
one to-find in a moment any species in the collection... Consid- 
erable additions have been made to this collection by donations,
-P-A-G-E-372
—1— 
purchases, exchanges, and by plants collected in various parts 
of the State by the professor. The herbarium also contains a 
named collection of plant seeds, embracing nearly one thousand 
varieties. As this collection contains the majority of our grass 
and weed seed, its educational value to the student of agricult- 
ure is apparent. 
In order to properly study and identify the numerous species 
of fungi—plants familiarly known as rust, smut, blight, mil- 
dew, mold, rot, etc.—it is of great importance to have at 
hand named collections for comparison, and the expenditure of 
a few hundred dollars in the purchase of some of the collections 
of these plants now on sale will be a wise investment. The 
immediate purchase of such fungi as can be obtained from the 
collections of the late Dr. Ravenel, of North Carolina, Prof. J. 
B. Ellis, of Newfield, N. J., and others searcely less valuable, is 
urgently recommended. 
.. The laboratory is equipped with simple dissecting microscopes 
and instruments necessary for the beginning classes, and com- 
pound microscopes and accessories for the more advanced stu- 
dents. 
A small but excellent working botanical laboratory, belong- 
‘ing to the University Experiment Station, in charge of the pro- 
fessor, will be open to consultation by special and advanced stu- 
dents. A number of the leading botanical journals are now 
being received or are on file. 
Horricunture. 
“ Horticulture i is required in the Agricultural Course in the Sen- 
ior year. It is one of the branches of applied botany, and the 
previous work in the course forms a basis for and greatly facil- 
itates an intelligent understanding of this subject. Grafting, 
budding, layering, and other methods of propagation, and stud- 
ies in pollination and hybridizing, enter into the course. Atten- 
tion is given to out-door culture, culture under glass, the man- 
agement of hot-beds, clod-frames, etc., as well .as the manage- 
‘ment of .vines and fruit-trees. An instructor in practical hor- 
ticulture has been recently secured. Respectfully,

X. SCHOOL OF ZOOLOGY. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Str—The following report on the objects, material 
equipment, and course of study of the Zoological Department 
is respectfully submitted : 
Osszcts. 
1. To develop the observing and comparative powers of: the — 
mind, and awaken an interest in living forms. 
2. To give a sufficient knowledge of the main facts in “the 
morphology of the various groups of animals, to enable the 
student to comprehend and discuss intelligently the proofs of 
organic evolution, and the theories that have been advanced to 
account for this evolution. 
3. To give at least an elementary knowledge of human physi- 
ology, and, with this as a basis, a sufficient knowledge of hy- 
giene to enable the student to cope intelligently with the pre- 
ventable causes of disease. 
4. To give those intending to become practical farmers a 
knowledge of the structure, life-habits, and classification of in- 
sects, especially of those beneficial and injurious to agriculture, 
with the best means of preventing the ravages of the latter. 
5. To offer to those intending to study medicine a compara- 
tively full course in the methods of investigation and. subject- 
matter of physiology and histology, and thus to relieve to some 
extent the overcrowded condition of the medical curriculum. 
6. To give those intending to become teachers of and inves- 
tigators in zoology a personal acquaintance with the facts and 
principles of that science, to imbue them with the true spirit of 
scientific research, and to train them in the methods of original 
investigation. 
Cournszs or Stupy. 
1. Physiology and Hygiene.—This course is designed especially 
to give the student that knowledge of his own body and the 
laws of health relating to it that are necessary to enable him 
to care for it: properly, and to cope intelligently with the causes 
of disease. During the latter part of the course the relation of
-P-A-G-E-374
—3— 
bacteria to man will be dealt with as fully as is thought will be 
of profit to the layman. Lectures, demonstrations, and recita- 
tions, Sophomore Class, five hours per week during the fall 
term. This course is a prerequisite to all the following courses: 
It must be preceded by the elementary course in physics. 
2. Elementary Zoology.—Intended to give to such students as 
are not going to pursue zoological studies further a slight 
knowledge of the structure of the great groups of animals and 
of the laws of evolution which are especially well illustrated 
by their development. Sophomore Class, two hours per week 
during the spring term. It is not desirable that students in- 
tending to continue zoological studies should take this course, 
as the same ground is much more fully covered by the follow- 
ing courses. / 
8. Zoological Methods.—This course should follow course 1 
for students who intend to take any of the following courses, 
. for all of which it is a prerequisite. The first half of the term 
will be devoted to histological methods, the second half to the 
collection and classification of insects, as an introduction to the 
methods of systematic zoology. Sophomore Class, two hours 
per week during the spring term. 
4, Systematic Zoology.—Laboratory work, with occasional 
lectures on the structure of the principal groups of animals, 
Juniors, usually three hours per week through the year. Must 
be preceded by courses 1 and 3. : 
5. Entomology.—Practical field and laboratory work, with 
special reference to noxious and beneficial insects. Juniors, 
three hours or more per week, beginning with fall term. Must 
be preceded by courses 1 and 3. 
6. Histology—This course is designed to give to those who 
intend to study medicine a thorough knowledge of histological 
methods, and as much of the subject-matter of histology as the 
time devoted to it will permit. Not less than two hours per 
week for one term. Must be preceded by courses 1 and 3.
-P-A-G-E-375
—14— 
7. Human Physiology.— Advanced course for prospective 
teachers and students of medicine. Laboratory work, not less 
than three hours per week in the spring term. Must be pre- 
ceded by courses 1 and 8, and course 1 in chemistry. 
Courses six and seven will usually be taken by graduate stu- 
dents. In addition to these and the other regular courses, as 
outlined above, individual courses will be laid out for special 
and graduate students who are prepared to pursue their work 
with only occasional guidance and advice from the instructor. 
. The number of students registered in the different courses of 
this department for the year ending June, 1889, was sixty. 
Marertat Equipment. 
The department at present oecupies the following rooms, al 
situated in the Agricultural Building: 
A lecture-room on the second floor. 
A general laboratory for work in entomology, systematic zo- 
ology, and histology. This is supplied with simple and com- 
pound microscopes, with accessories for measuring and drawing 
objects; microtome and other apparatus, and also re-agents for 
preserving and preparing material for microscopic work; appa- 
ratus for collecting and. preserving insects, dissecting instru- 
ments, etc.. Part of the tables in this laboratory do not touch 
the floor, but are attached to the walls, so as to avoid jar as 
much as possible when using microscopes. 
A private laboratory for the use of the professor, opening off 
of the general laboratory. : 
A physiological laboratory, fitted up after the manner of an 
ordinary chemical laboratory, with tables and necessary appa- 
ratus and re-agents for the use of the students taking the ad- 
vanced course in physiology (coarse seven). 
A large museum-room is being fitted up for preserving and 
exhibiting zoological specimens.
-P-A-G-E-376
—% — 
The department is at present fairly well equipped with illus- 
trative material for the different courses, although there are 
some important gaps that should be filled as soon as funds are 
available for the purpose. In addition to a large number of 
specimens obtained from various sources, representing nearly 
all the classes.of the animal kingdom, the following collections ~ 
are deemed worthy of special note: 
(1) A named set of the fishes collected in 1888 by the U. 8. 
Fish Commission, mostly in Western Virginia and North Caro- 
lina. These are probably largely the same especies that will be

XI, REPORT OF THE SCHOOL OF MILITARY SCIENCE AND TACTIOS. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dzar Srr—I have the honor to submit the following report 
of the condition and progress of the Military Department of 
the University of Tennessee: 
In accordance with regulations recently adopted, both practi- 
cal and theoretical instruction in military science and. tactics 
is, at present, conlined to students of the Freshman and Sopho- 
more Classes, and such students of the Junior and Senior Classes 
as may elect it. 
The organization consists of staff, drum-corps, and two com- 
panies, each with the usual.complement of officers. 
Practical instruction (drill) occupies, at present, two hours 
per week; theoretical, one hour per week. The former has, 
since the beginning of the term, been confined to infantry tac- 
~ ties (School of the Soldier) with very fair progress noted, con- 
sidering the limited time. The latter consists in recitation in 
infantry tactics by the members of the Sophomore Class; this 
will be followed by instruction in other branches of military 
- science as prescribed in orders from the War Department. 
There are on hand two hundred and seventy cadet rifles, two 
hundred and seventy sets of accoutrements, sixteen swords of 
regulation pattern, two pieces of field artillery—third rifle— 
with full set of implements, all in serviceable condition. Ammu- 
. nition for small arms and field-pieces is in good condition and 
ample for purposes of instruction. 
_I would recommend the removal of the small arms, accoutre- 
ments, and ammunition from the present armory, and that they 
be stored in a place free from moisture. For this purpose, and 
for drilling in inclement weather, au armory and drill hall is 
very much needed. Very respectfully, 
[Signed] E. E. Gaye, First Lieut. Second Artillery, 
Professor Military Science and Tactics.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN. 2 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear S1r—During the short time that I have had charge of 
the University library I have endeavored to carry out the ex- 
cellent plans of my predecessor, Prof. Cc. 8. Plumb. 
Our catalogue list now foots up 5,719 volumes. We have 
added 254 volumes during my term of office. Thirty volumes 
of periodicals are now at the binder’s. 
The present quarters for the library are very contracted. 
More room for books is much needed. We look forward anx- 
iously to the time when we can secure better accommodations. 
Students manifest a good interest in the library and reading- 
room. We hope to see this still increase as our resources en- 
large. It is the present intention to make the library especially 
helpful to students in their work. Books are bought, in the 
main, from lists furnished by professors at the head of the va- 
rious departments. Students are thus supplied with collateral 
reading and books of reference for all the studies of their va- 
rious courses. We have about $800 a year for purchasing 
books. We need more general literature. Provisions should, 
also, be made to buy the best current publications as they come 
out. : 
The following is a list of the periodicals on file in the reading- 
room which were paid for out of the library fund: 
The Century, Harper’s Monthly, Harper’s Weekly, Scribner’s 
Monthly, Atlantic Monthly, Current Literature, The Forum, 
North American Review, Modern Language Notes, Johns Hop- 
kins University Studies, Outing, American Chemical Journal, 
American Journal of Philology, American Journal of Science, 
American Naturalist, Popular Science Monthly, Nineteenth 
Century, Journal of the Association of Engineering Societies, 
Magazine of American History, The Nation, Public Opinion, 
Photographie Times, Shakespeariana, Science Gossip, Sanitary 
News, Engineering, Engineering and Mining Journal, Railroad

1891, and continues until Commencement, June 17. The com- 
plete course extends over two such terms, the second term be- 
ginning in February, 1892. 
Those who honorably complete the course of study prescribed 
will be granted a certificate, the possession of which will ex- 
empt the holder from examination as a condition precedent to 
employment in the public schools, any such person being eligi- 
ble as a teacher in any county in the State. 
ADMISSION. 
Male teachers, holding certificates from county or city super- 
intendents, or producing satisfactory evidence that they have 
taught at least ten months acceptably in a private school, will 
be admitted to this department, and receive free instruction.

Privinecss, Ec. 
Students in the Teachers’ Department will have all the privi- 
leges of the University, with the use of the reading-room, 
library, literary societies, etc., under the regulations that gov- 
ern them. The other departments of the University afford 
many advantages of which these students can avail themselves. 
For physical exercise, military drill is provided, and is optional. 
- A fine gymnasium, now under construction for the Young 
Men’s Christian Association of the University, will be opened 
during the next term. The regulations for the government of 
students are few and simple. They are such as are necessary to 
secure good order, prompt attendance and attention, and faithful 
performance of duty. 
Expernsss, Lopeine, and Boanp. 
Tuition is free to actual teachers (see Admission), The ma- 
triculation fees in this department amount to $7 per term. 
Small fees are collected in the laboratories to cover cost of ma- 
terial used. 
Students can occupy rooms in the University buildings, or 
board with families in the immediate vicinity. Room-rent at 
the University, including electric light, is $5.50 per term of five 
months, payable at matriculation. Simple room furniture can

REPORT OF THE LAW DEPARTMENT. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dzar Str—This is a distinct department of the University 
proper, and has no connection with the Agricultural and Me- 
chanical College, except as being in connection with the Uni- 
versity. It receives no aid from the funds of that department, 
or from any University fund, but depends solely on the fees for 
tuition for the compensation for the Dean, or any other instruct- 
ors in this branch of knowledge. 
Its objects are: First, to educate and train thoroughly young 
men who propose to practice the law, in a knowledge of the 
elementary learning of the profession; second, it proposes, to 
give them a knowledge of the practice, by moot-courts, prepa- 
ration of pleadings, etc., so that they may be able to enter upon 
the practice of their profession with some experience in these 
essential matters; third, it has attempted and will continue to 
labor to elevate the standard of professional learning. The 
course of study is broader than is generally given in our law 
schools, It is Known and realized by experience that the 
longer course of study is not the popular one; but feeling its 
importance, it will be continued. 
The Senior Class, which will graduate in June, has gone over 
all the following works: Walker’s American Law, Bishop on
-P-A-G-E-386
— 85 — 
Contracts, Cooley on Torts, Stephen on Pleading, History’ of 
Lawsuit, first and second volume of Greenleaf on Evidence, 
Schouler’s Domestic Relations, Harris’ Criminal law, Boone on! 
Real Property, Bispham’s Equity Jurisprudence, Lube’s Equity 
Pleading, and Hicks’ Manual of Chancery Practice, and‘ will, 
before graduation, study Field on Corporations, May on Insur- 
ance, Schouler’s Law of Personal Property (first and second 
volume), Cooley’s Constitutional Law, Cooley on Constitutional 
Limitations, and close with Curtiss’ Lectures on Jurisdiction of 
Federal Courts. 
Part of this has been done by a summer course of reading, 
which will enable this class to graduate in three terms, or fifteen - 
months, instead of the four required by their course. 
This course will be modified for next fall session, so as to en- | 
able students who have read Blackstone and Walker’s Ameri- 
can Law, or equivalent works, to graduate i in fifteen months, or 
three terms. 
That the’ study of law in a law school, under a competent 
teacher, is of infinite advantage to the young man who seeks 
the honors of the profession all must concede. To study in an 
office, unguided by a teacher, is to waste much time with little 
results, as‘ compared with the study in such a school... The stu- 
dent in the school has been tested as to his reading by examina- 
tion, and has had his knowledge verified by the explanations 
and lectures of.an instructor. He has also had pointed out to 
him the modifications in the law as found. in, the text-books, 
madé by statute and decision in his own and other States, so 
that he’ need not be misled by blindly following a different 
text-book, which may have adopted a view of the law from 
what has been established, which has not been followed by 
some one State, or an English rule that-has not been followed 
by courts of the United States, or his own State, as is frequently 
the’ case. 
: The department was organized’ and commenced. work on 
February 18, 1890. The announcement of the organization 
was'short; and only to a limited extent. It opened, however,
-P-A-G-E-387
— 86 — 
with a class of nine students... There are in attendance at its 
present, or second, term fourteen students, with promise of a 
large increase at the opening of the next term. It is capable 
of being made not only a success in itself, but of large advan+ 
tage to the University, as the. students will go out of it with 
kindly feelings toward the institution, and be the means of send- 
ing students to the other departments from the localities where 
they shall make their homes. 
After a careful survey of the field, the Dean, with perfect 
confidence, can say that-he has not the slightest doubt that it 
can be made a successful department of the University. 
It is at present solely under my charge as instructor, but 
other instructors will be added as demanded by the increase of 
students. I devote my entire time to the work, doing an aver- 
age of ten hours’ work every day in preparation of lessons and 
with lectures and recitations in the class-room. . 
The course of study covers the entire field of our elementary 
common law, equity, and criminal jurisprudence, giving prom- 
inence to the civil over criminal law. 
The mode of teaching is by study of standard text-writers, 
explanation and application of principles by the instructor 
with reference to the leading cases, especially in Tennessee, 
when teaching these principles, and such statutory changes as 
have been made in our own State or other States. 
The importance of some knowledge of the laws to the citi- 
zen, even as such, and the: absolute demand for its thorough 
knowledge by the lawyers of the State, will authorize the sug- 
gestion that the Legislature should appropriate a small sum for 
purchasing the books necessary as a nucleus for a law library 
for this department. _ {t certainly might, at least, furnish the 
code of. statutory laws of the State, with a set of the decisions 
of the Supreme Court, and the leading digests of those decis- 
ions. These could probably be purchased for $300, and are 
needed every day by students for reference. Very respectfully, 
Tuos. J. Freeman, 
Dean of the Law Department. .

and for this purpose the County Superintendents should take 
immediate action. 
Full instructions have been given many times to the County 
Superintendents as to a good method to adopt in the manage- 
ment of the County Institutes. 
The course of study for the Peabody Institutes should be 
closely followed by the conductors of County Institutes.

REPORTS OF CONDUCTORS, 
Report or Prov. T. C. Karns, 
  
University or TENNESSEE, 
Kwoxvitiz, Treny., August 16, 1890. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Sir—I have the honor to present the following 4 as a 
report of my work in the Peabody Institutes for Tennessee 
during the summer of 1890: 
My first work began June 16, at Ripley, where I assisted Dr. 
C. T. Kellogg, Superintendent of the Milan schools, in an Insti- 
tute of five days. We really held two Institutes, one for the 
white teachers and another for the colored. We were sent to 
hold the white Institute, but finding the colored people wanting 
instruction, we felt that we should only be carrying out your 
wishes and the wishes of the Peabody Board, if we taught 
them. In the white Institute twenty-two teachers were en- 
rolled. Others came in whose names were not taken. The 
interest was not so great at first, but increased to the end.
-P-A-G-E-396
—T— 
Among the citizens some feeling: was aroused regarding the’ 
establishment of a graded school in town, and the grading of 
the country schools. If the work is followed up, much good can 
be accomplished. The number enrolled in the colored Institute, 
was twenty-nine. We found the colored teachers eager to learn. 
We were assisted in the white Institute by Prof. J. C. Cheek 
and Miss Emily Lewis, of. Ripley; also. by Mrs. W. H. Horton, 
of Memphis; Prof. A. L. Purinton, of the Peabody Normal 
College, at Nashville; and. the County Superintendent, Mrs. 
Watkins, who was zealous in her work. In the colored Insti- 
tute we were assisted by Rev. A. T. Ayers, Mr. ‘George T. 
Halliburton, and others. . 
Our next Institute was held at Bell’s Depot, June 23 to 27 in- 
elusive. The course laid out by yourself was followed in this, as 
well as in others. The number of teachers ‘in attendance here 
was about sixty or seventy. Large crowds of citizens, embrac- - 
ing merchants, bankers, ministers, and. all the leading people of 
the community, were present every day. An exténsive choir, 
composed of young people, furnished music, vocal and instru- 
mental, with solos, quartettes, ete. We were assisted in the 
regular work by Messrs. Muse, Rose, Price, and others. Popular 
lectures in the evening were ‘as follows: “Necessity of Popular 
Education,” by Rev. J. G. Pettigrew ; “The Teacher and His 
Work,” by Rev. E. L. Peay; “Physiology,” by Dr. Sullivan. 
An excellent. essay on “ What to Read” was presented by Miss 
Grey Taylor. Miss Lucile Nelson, of Memphis, assisted with 
fine work in recitation. Dr. Kellogg, my associate, delivered 
two addresses, which attracted much interest. The first was on 
“The Evolution and Philosophy of History.” The second was, 
“Does it Pay to Educate?” The latter came at the close of 
the Institute before a large audience. County Superintendent 
J. R. McDonald was the leading spirit i in making ‘the Institute 
a great success. 
My next Institute came July 7, at Waverly. In this I was 
associated with Prof. S. A. Mynders, of Lexington. Owing to 
‘a protracted meeting, a political convention; a public speaking, 
and other counter-attractions, we had only an informal meet-
-P-A-G-E-397
—8— 
ing on the first day. Forty teachers were enrolled during the 
week. We were assisted by Messrs. Waul, Lewis, and Simp- 
son. The Institute closed on Thursday. 
I was next associated with Capt. C. 8. Douglass, of the Gal- 
latin schools, in holding an Institute at Greeneville. ' It lasted 
from July 21 to July 26. The attendance was very large, em- 
bracing about one hundred and sixty teachers. Many citizens 
also attended constantly. Six or more County Superintendents 
were present, besides numerous prominent educators and friends 
of education. Eight or ten counties were represented. This 
shows what a live worker like County Superintendent E. M. 
Wright can do. Asan organizer, his equal scarcely exists in 
the State. The sessions of the Institute were held in Snapp’s 
Opera-house. Captain Douglass made a very successful and 
popular presiding officer, and, as principal of the Institute and 
chief lecturer, contributed more than any one else toward 
making the exercises a grand success. Messrs. Saylor, Haun, 
Vines, and others, contributed valuable assistance. Supt. J. W. 
Hyden, of Loudon, and Prof. D. L. Earnest, of the Alabama State 
Normal School, had leading parts as Institute workers. Popular 
evening. lectures were delivered by Hon. A. H. Pettibone, ex- 
member of Congress, Hon. J. W. Robinson, and others. The 
first address was on “ History,” the second on “Geology.” Rev. 
J. W. ©. Willoughby, president of the Washington College, 
delivered an address on “Teaching Morals in the Public 
Schools.” T also did some work in a colored Institute which 
was in session at this time and place. It had good attendance 
and good interest. 
This completed my work. In the various Institutes I made 
a specialty of “Primary Methods,” “The Consideration of 
Psychological and Educational Principles,” and “Modeling in 
Sand.” I also made talks on “ Grading the Schools,” “County 
Organization,” and.“ Outline Drawing.” 
I can safely say that decided progress is being made in the 
educational work of the State. At no previous time have there 
been so many good school-houses, so much good furniture and
-P-A-G-E-398
—9g9— 
school-apparatus. Teachers and people everywhere are inter- 
ested, or ready to take interest. All they lack is efficient lead- 
ership. This, in many places, is supplied. Yet I should say 
that the weakest spot in our State educational system isa lack . 
of. proper organization and directing force in the country 
schools. These defects are being remedied under your admin- 
istration, but those in authority should give you more ample 
means to carry on the work more rapidly. Efficient Institute 
conductors, County Superintendents, and superintendents of 
town or graded schools, are much needed. One or more As- 
sistant State Superintendents or Supervisors are needed to 
assist you in establishing graded schools and holding Institutes 
throughout the year. By such means the educational interests 
can be brought up much more rapidly, and at a greater saving. 
to.the people of the State. Normal Schools should be estab- 
lished in the three divisions of the State for the better training 
of teachers in the country schools. In no other direction could 
the State apply money to better purpose. 
With.these suggestions, I beg leave to close my report, all of 
which is respectfully submitted by your obedient servant, 
T. C. Karns, 
State. Institute Lecturer.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Sir—I have the honor to submit the following report 
of my work in the Peabody Normal Institutes for the summer 
of 1890: 
We opened at Carthage, Smith County,.on Monday, June 9, 
and continued one week. At this Institute we enrolled eighty 
teachers, and had a good attendance of Directors and people.
-P-A-G-E-399
—10— 
Superintendent Kellogg, of Milan, was with us, and did some 
valuable-work. His excellent addresses contributed greatly to 
the success of the Institute. Two years ago, under your super- 
. vision, I held a State Institute at the same place, and organized 
a County Teachers’ Association. The good results are shown 
in the interest manifested in the public schools of Smith 
County. The teachers have held regular meetings, and the 
majority of them read educational papers and books. Many of 
the country schools are graded, and the school-term has been 
increased. At the Institute this summer, leaders for each sub- 
ject were selected from ‘the county teachers. Their work 
showed that they were acquainted with the most improved 
methods of teaching. We endeavored to carry out your in- 
structions given in the. Institute. circular. Daily instruction | 
was given in grading the school-course, methods in primary 
grades, methods of other grades, consideration of psychological 
and educational principles, purpose and methods of Institutes, 
general principles of school supervision, organization, manage- 
ment, economy, outline drawing, modeling, singing, calisthen- 
ies, ete. . 
A meeting of County Directors was held, and an excellent 
address on the practical workings of the public school-system 
was delivered by the State Superintendent. 
Popular lectures were delivered by State Superintendent 
Smith, Superintendent C. T. Kellogg, and Prof. J. A. Reubelt. 
Your presence and good advice were appreciated by instructors 
and members. 
The following ‘editorial on our State Institute is taken from 
the Carthage Record, of June 20: 
“The Teachers’ Institute which was held here recently was 
perhaps the best one that has been held. There were about 
seventy teachers present, and the interest manifested through- 
out was the very best. State Superintendent Frank M. Smith, 
Professor Kellogg, and Professor Mynders added very mate- 
rially to the success of the Institute. Much credit is also due
-P-A-G-E-400
—i11 — 
Professor Brown, our valuable County Superintendent, for his 
work in the matter. On Saturday about sixty teachers were 
. examined to teach in the public schools of the county. 
“Tt was the first visit of Superintendent Smith to our county 
to hold an Institute, and he was not only astonished, but. de- 
lighted, at the fine state of affairs respecting the schools in this 
county. He stated as a fact that Smith County is far in ad- 
vance of what he expected, and far ahead of a great many coun- 
ties that are much wealthier than this county. He found us 
with a live set of teachers, and the school-interests here in good 
condition. Our teachers, many of them, do not hesitate, when 
called on, to take charge of the Institute in the presence of 
such men as Superintendent Smith, Doctor Kellogg, and Pro- 
fessor Mynders, and feel and prove that they are capable of 
conducting it with credit to themselves. And what has brought 
about this lively interest in the schools and this active dispo- 
sition of the teachers? It is mainly due to the fact that they 
have for several years kept up the County Institute, and have 
attended it, and been trained and drilled in their calling. It is 
folly to deny the etticacy of these Institutes, for their good effects 
are very visible in Smith County.” 
From Carthage, I went to Dresden, Weakley County, where 
we held a two weeks’ Institute, beginning June 16. Here we 
enrolled fifty teachers. We. found Mrs. L. T. Evans, the County 
Superintendent, an efficient and zealous worker. She is doing 
good work in the interest, of Weakley County schools. The 
samne order of work was done as at Carthage, and I believe 
good results will follow. We held daily sessions, and I lectured 
two evenings on educational topics. At the close of the Insti- 
tute work, we organized a County Teachers’ Association. 
_ During the session excellent addresses were delivered by Ca- 
ruthers Ewing and Rev. J. W. Blackard, of Dresden. 
On Monday, July 7, I went to Waverly to assist Prof. T. C. 
_ Karns in an Institute there. At this Institute we enrolled 
thirty-five teachers, but the attendance was irregular, owing to
-P-A-G-E-401
—12— 
lack of proper local arrangements. We endeavored to present 
about the same subjects as at former Institutes. 
Institutes are now becoming general throughout the State, 
and are doing much to elevate the standard of teaching and 
to advance education. Everywhere we find teachers wide 
awake and becoming well posted on the best methods of teach- 
ing and management. 
In closing this report, I again wish to thank you for the many 
acts of kindness shown me and your valuable instructions. 
Whatever success has been attained in our Institute work is 
due largely to your sound judgment and advice. 
Respectfully submitted, 
8S. A. Mynpers. 
Report or Capt. C. 8. Doverass. 
  
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
_ Dear Srr—In obedience to your instructions, I was present 
in Greeneville, East Tennessee, July 21, with Prof. T.C. Karna, 
to represent the State in a Normal Institute. On our arrival 
we found the little city alive with teachers, County and City. 
Superintendents, professors, and college presidents, all seem- 
ingly very much interested in the anticipated work. 
The active and energetic Superintendent, E. M. Wright, was 
on the grounds with all of his committees well in hand, ready 
to lead, to follow, or to assist, and well did he do his duty. 
The Institute was called to order in the Opera-house by the 
Hon, J. C. Park, Chairman of the Executive Committee, and 
the address of welcome made by the mayor, J. M. Brobson, 
which was interesting, pointed, and so cordial that all visitors
-P-A-G-E-402
—13— 
felt at once at home, and seemed determined to make their stay 
not only pleasant but profitable. The response was made by 
your humble servant,‘ representing the State, who, by unani- 
mous choice had been chosen as the presiding officer of the 
Institute for the week. From the very beginning harmony 
prevailed, and a generous rivalry for the thorough discharge of 
every duty characterized the meeting throughout. 
The public school curriculum was made the text from the 
- very first, and strictly adhered to in all of its features. TEspe- 
cially was the primary, in all its details, well handled, and by 
men of large culture and long experience. Primary reading, 
writing, notation, and enumeration were discussed by able and 
competent teachers, the Institute feeling that at this point there 
was great embarrassment both to teacher and pupil. 
Professor Karns, of the University of Tennessee, was par- 
ticularly happy and forcible in this work, and made himself so 
felt that an impress was made that will not be readily effaced. 
Arithmetic, history, and geography came up for discussion, 
and blackboard delineations every day, and were taught by men 
and women thoroughly posted and well grounded in the science 
of the profession. Geology and physiology also had their share 
of attention, being handled by men of attainments and profes- 
sional experience. School-management was made a specialty 
by C. S. Douglass, he delivering a practical lecture every day 
on this subject: The duties of County Superintendents, as well 
as of School-directors, was made a subject of much importance 
and interest by Superintendent Hyden, who in several lectures 
well and profitably entertained the Institute. 
The Institute was made so thoroughly practical and so full of 
details, both in methods and management, that it could each 
day: have been compared to a model school. So numerous 
were the competent workers on hand that we were enabled to 
-assign four or five teachers to each branch, thereby bringing 
outin detail all of its virtues and essentials, so important for 
the teacher to know to become a success in our profession.
-P-A-G-E-403
—14— 
The State Superintendent, Frank M. Smith, was with us 
several days, and not only lent us valuable assistance in the dis- 
cussion and exemplification of class-work, but by invitation of 
the convention, gave us a sound and practical address upon the 
advance and accomplishments of the public school-system. 
There were present during the meeting 208 teachers, ten 
County Superintendents, and fifteen counties represented—cer- 
tainly one’ of the largest and most successful Institutes ever 
held in the State. 
Every night during the week was oceupied in public ad- 
dresses. The subjects of geology, true English, and history, 
were made specialties in able lectures from three of Greeneville’s 
distinguished citizens—Capt. J. H. Robinson, Maj. R. M. McKee, 
and the Hon. A. H. Pettibone. These lectures brought out 
crowded houses, were full-of thought, rhetoric, and beauty, and 
won for the speakers the admiration and gratitude of the Insti- 
tute. Also at night we had entertaining recitations from Misses’ 
Frazier, Murphy, Collom, Fitzgerald, and the Rev. Oscar Hay- 
wood, and essays from Misses Frazier and Mitchell. To these, . 
for the life and interest of the Institute, we are certainly grateful. 
- One of the most enjoyable features of this Institute was the 
magnificent choir of thirty-five voices, accompanied by asplendid 
organist, under the supervision of Mr. William Armitage. We 
certainly will not forget very soon the joy and pleasure derived 
from the rich and rare music afforded by this excellent choir. 
Friday night was particularly noticeable and enjoyable. In 
the evening the Hon. J. C. Park made one of his characteristic 
speeches on the subject of education and the teachers’ profes- 
sion, besides officiating’ most happily in the teachers “love 
feast,” thereby making all happy and joyous. This was fol- 
lowed by a recitation, splendidly executed, by Rev. Oscar Hay- 
wood, and then the address of C. 8. Douglass, the subject being 
“ Our Boys and Girls of the South.” Thus wound up one of the 
most successful and pleasant Institutes that I have ever had the 
pleastre of attending. Among the many splendid Institute
-P-A-G-E-404
—15— 
workers that were with us, I take pleasure in thanking Profs. 
Earnest, Hyden, Haun, Saylors, White, and Jordan, of the 
University, Willoughby, and many others, for their close, 
accurate, and interesting work. In truth, I have never known’ 
better work done in any Institute. It was a teachers’ meeting 
in “spirit and in truth.” . 
The following extract was taken from the Nashville Ameri- 
can: 
“ GREENEVILLE, Tenn., July 26, 1889. 
“The labors and associations connected with the week just 
closing will be long remembered. Last Monday morning the 
Peabody Institute and Greene County Normal was called to 
order by Hon. J. C. Park, Chairman of the Executive Com- 
mittee. The Greeneville choir, with organ accompaniment, 
rendered a beautiful selection, followed by an invocation by 
Professor Monroe. 
“On motion of Superintendent Wright, Capt. C. 8. Doug- 
lass, of Gallatin, was elected Chairman of the Institute. Prof. 
D.'L. Earnest and Dr. J. 8. Smith were elected Secretaries. 
“The address of welcome was delivered in an eloquent man- 
“ner by Mayor John M. Brobson. The response was made by 
the representative of the State, Capt. C. 8. Douglass, in such 
inspiring words as to cheer the teachers and enthuse the 
audience. : : ‘ 
“The laborers in the Institute were put to work, and kept at 
their respective tasks by day and by night in such a skillful 
manner as to instruct the teachers, interest the citizens, enter- 
tain the visitors, and enrapture the audience. 
“We canuot mention all who labored to make the Institute 
successful, but prominent among them were Superintendent 
Wright, by his untiring labors; Prof. T. C. Karns, by his 
learned, clear, and practical addresses on varied, subjects con- 
nected with the methods of teaching; Superintendent John W. 
Hyden, by most valuable instructions to Superintendents, pa-
-P-A-G-E-405
—16— 
trons, and teachers; Prof, D. L. Earnest, by his concise, logical, 
and psychological methods of teaching. 
“There were over one hundred and twenty-five teachers pres- 
‘ent the first day, and the interest increased until nearly two 
hundred avere enrolled, and one hundred and forty-six tickets 
were. sold to persons who entered and were examined. 
«Entertaining recitations were given by Misses Mattie Fra- 
zier, Bessie Murphy, Belle Collom, and Roby Fitzgerald, and 
the Rev. Oscar Haywood; instructive essays were read by 
Misses Mattie Frazier and Mattie Mitchell; addresses on edu- 
cational subjects were delivered by Maj. R. M. McKee, Capt. 
James H. Robinson, Hon. J. C. Park, Hon. A. H. Pettibone, 
Rey. J. W. C. Willoughby, and Prof. T. W. Jordan; and the 
soul-stirring vocal and instrumental music by the choir gave 
exquisite delight to all. 
“The exercises last night were very interesting. Capt. C. 8. 
Douglass made gn address on “The Girls and Boys of the 
South.” It was filled with food for thought, and delivered in 
his attractive and impressive style. 
“The conductors of the Institute were presented with bou- 
quets, baskets, and wreaths of flowers.” 
,Our second Institute was held at Pikeville, beginning July 
28 and continuing for five days. It was organized with the 
State Superintendent as Chairman, and John T. Price, Sec- 
retary. This was the second Institute that has ever been held 
in that rich and populous valley, and I would remark that you 
could not have made a happier selection. 
The teachers seemed delighted at. the coming of the State 
Superintendent, and made every effort to cultivate any new 
methods that might be suggested. The State Superintendent 
in this Institute became -truly.one of the class-workers, and 
each day gave the convention the benefit of his large experience 
and practical knowledge in the school-work. Here, as in other
-P-A-G-E-406
—17— 
Institutes, the public school curriculum was strictly followed, 
and every effort made to interest the teachers in the.great re- 
form now going on among the educators of the State. 
State Superintendent F. M. Smith exemplified fully primary 
reading and arithmetic day after day; Miss Maggie Hudson 
was in charge of geography, and certainly handled the subject 
with credit to herself and profit to the Institute; Mr. D. 8. 
Hutchison was a success in United States history; Professor 
Billingsley showed a fine experience in the art of teaching En- 
glish grammar; and Capt. C. 8. Douglass, day by day, lectured 
on school-management. 
The exercises were interspersed with good music and recita- 
tions. . 
On Thursday the State Superintendent made a special ad- 
dress to fhe School-directors, who had been invited to be pres- 
ent, and who were out in full force, and manifested much 
interest in the address and seemed much delighted with the In- 
stitute work. 
A Teachers’ County Convention was organized, and meetings 
‘appointed monthly. 
Tam satisfied that our Institute at Pikeville did much good, 
and it is only necessary to follow it up in order to secure happy 
and beneficial results. There were about fifty teachers present, 
and five counties represented. 
We in thanks would remember Misses Spencer, Hudson, 
Furguson, and Blackburn for their entertaining recitations and 
good music; also the Rey. Eugene Blake, Professor Acuff, Pro- 
fessor Billingsley, and others, for the valuable assistance given 
us during the Institute. The County Superintendent was at 
his post and did his duty well, and truly deserves much credit 
for the success of the meeting. 
With this Institute our work closed, and we do still insist 
2—App.D-E
-P-A-G-E-407
—-18— 
that in no other way can a live and energetic interest be built 
up so readily and thoroughly as through the State and County 
Institutes. Your views, permit me to say, upon Normal Insti- 
tutes, as exemplified in the workings of such during your 
administration, undoubtedly prove that it is the best and 
quickest plan by which our State can arise to that high educa- 
tional Position that she 80 justly deserves. : 
We feel that your work along this line has been a noble one, 
and that the future will verify the correctness of your judgment 
and the wisdom of your action.. 
The following resolutions were adopted by the Institute at its 
close : 
«Wuereas, Our worthy State Superintendent,-Capt. Frank 
M. Smith, has, through his great kindness, granted to us this 
‘County Institute; therefore, be it 
“1. Resolved, That we, the teachers of Bledsoe County, highly 
appreciate this distinction, and our heartiest thanks are hereby 
tendered Captain Smith for his presence among us, and for his 
untiring efforts, both by his instruction to us upon methods of 
teaching and by making this a pleasant occasion for all. 
“2. Resolved, That our thanka are due and are extended to 
Capt. C. 8. Douglass, Superintendent of City Schools of Galla- 
tin, for his visit among ‘us, and for his instructions on school- 
management, especially for his public lecture upon ‘Our Boys 
and Girls.’ 
“3, Resolved, That we thank Professor Billingsley and Mr. 
Acuff, of Spencer, for their co-operation with us as teachers. 
“4, Resolved, That our thanks are extended to our worthy 
Secretary, John W. Price, for efficient work. 
“5, Resolved, That we heartily thank Revs. Scoles and Blake 
for music furnished us. 
“6, Resolved, That we, the teachers of Bledsoe County, are 
determined to do more efficient school-work.” 
Respectfully submitted,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sin—We are certainly glad to report to you the result of 
the State Institute which we, by appointment, held at Shelbyville, 
Tenn., for colored teachers. The Institute began June 28, and 
continued through the following week. 
Prof. J. H. Allen, the very proficient and progressive Super- 
intendent of Bedford County, rendered us invaluable service, 
and he emphasized the idea of making the work of the Insti- 
tute practical. 
‘We had an enrollment of seventy-five teachers, and an aver- 
age attendance daily of seventy. 
The subjects provided by yourself, together with many other 
school subjects, were thoroughly discussed, and the most prac- 
tical good possible was gotten out of them. 
* ‘Teachers were in attendance from many of the surrounding 
counties, and all agreed in saying that this was the most fruit- 
ful and successful. State Institute ever held here. The teachers 
entered into the work with a vim unknown in the Institutes 
before. 
People favorable to education attended the sessions of the 
Institute, and showed much interest in the work. In this part 
of the State Institutes are growing more and more in favor 
with the people. - Yours respectfully, 
Cc. V. Roman, 
B. A. J. Nixon.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—By your direction I attended the Peabody Insti- 
tute held at Carthage, and assisted in the work ‘of the week’s 
session. There were in all about seventy teachers present, and 
the degree of interest manifested spoke well for the character 
of school-work in Smith County. Professor Mynders, who 
presided, will doubtless report to you the detailed work of the 
Institute. The Smith County teachers’ organization, which 
has been in existence for three or four years, was very efficient 
in making the Institute a success. My individual work was 
contined to the subjects of United States history, physicial and 
commercial geography, and primary methods in reading.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dzar Sirr—The Peabody Institute held at Ripley, Lauderdale 
County, to which Prof. T. C. Karns and myself were assigned, 
promised at the beginning to be an exceedingly unprofitable 
effort. There seemed to be almost a dearth of interest in public 
school-work. The teachers of the county, though notified, 
failed to put in an appearance at. the first, and at the opening 
session there were present only six individuals, including the 
County Superintendent, Mrs. Watkins. Though the outlook 
was discouraging, we began by stating the purpose of the Insti- 
tute, Professor Karns leading off with a talk on the necessity of 
a knowledge of good methods to a teacher’s success, followed 
by myself with an exhortation to those present to go immedi-

ately to work, by visits and correspondence, at bringing out a

The attendance on this Institute was teachers, and many 
citizens of Ripley showed their interest by daily attendance on 
the last three days of the Institute.   
The work, though not strictly carrying out the programme 
suggested by Dr. Curry, was.such as we deemed adapted to 
arouse the attention of all present to what ought to be done in 
our public schools; and we recommend a visit from the State 
Superintendent at as early a date as he can find convenient, be- 
lieving that a good opening has been made for the establish-_ 
ment of a graded school at Ripley, Tenn. .

‘hus closed the Institute work at Bell’s Depot, and it was 
the unanimous expression that not only had it been a season of 
great interest, but one of profit and educational refreshing to 
all'who had enjoyed participation in its sessions. Seldom has 
it been our privilege to mingle with a more earnest and wide- 
awake class of teachers, and their hearty co-operation with the

efforts of their County Superintendent, J. R. McDonald, is 
worthy of all praise. To this gentleman was very largely due 
the credit for making the Institute a success. 
Though the weather was of the hottest, the audience-room 
of the academy was filled at every session; and we are happy 
to say that the entire list of topics in the outlined course of 
study was treated both by lectures and illustrations. 
The space allotted in this repart will not serve for an inser- 
tion of the resolutions. passed at the closing by the County Su- 
perintendent and teachers. Suffice it to say that they show a 
vivid appreciation of the value of the work done for them, as 
well as a hearty acknowledgment of thanks to the agency by 
whose means the Institute was held.

REPORT OF PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE, 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—I beg leave to present my report of the Peabody 
Normal College for the year 1889-90, together with the present 
faculty list and the course of study now in force. 
The attendance at the College has been steadily increasing 
for the past three years. For the year 1887-88 the entire en- 
rollment was 177; for the year 1888-89 it was 280; for the 
year 1889-90 it was 859; and at this date (January 6, 1891) it 
is 410. In other words, within the past three years our attend- 
ace.has increased 125 per cent. The attendante from Tennes- 
see has increased at a more rapid rate. In 1887~88 there were 
69 students enrolled from Tennessee; in 1888-89 there were 
151; in- 1889-90 there were 203; and at the present time there 
are 204. . 
At the last commencement, in May, 1890, the following Ten- 
nessee students were graduated from the College:

At the last meeting of the Peabody Board of Trust it was 
resolved to reduce the amount of aid given the appointees from 
the several States to $100, and, in addition to this, te pay the 
student’s actual railroad expenses from his home to Nashville 
and return. By this means all scholarship students will be 
placed on a financial equality, and the College will henceforth
-P-A-G-E-424
~7— 
be as. accessible to East Tennessee and West Teunessce as to. 
Middle Tennesee. It is expected that this new arrangement 
will.give to Tennessee twenty-five or twenty-six scholarships 
instead of fourteen, as at present. 
Instruction in the Normal College is free, and all students 
have the free use of text-books. The only College charge is an 
incidental fee of six dollars a year. After the present year this 
fee will be ten dollars. The ordinary cost of board, including 
room, light, and fire, ranges from fifteen to eighteen dollars a 
calendar month for young men, and from seventeen to twenty 
dollars for young women. There are twenty-eight: furnished 
rooms in Lindsley Hall, which are rented to young men at tive 
dollars a month; this includes fuel and the services of a servant 
to bring water and coal. Each room accommodates two stu- 
dents. Young men who occupy these rooms secure good board 
at from nine to eleven dollars a month, so that their actual 
living. expenses are reduced to from thirteen to fifteen dollars a 
month. These rooms will be reserved for non-scholarship stu- 
dents from Tennessee till September 25 in each‘ year. After 
this date vacant rooms will be rented to students in the order 
of application. 
'-The Peabody Board of Trust has continued to foster the 
Normal College with even more than its usual liberality. Its 
contribution to the support of the school during the year 
1889-90 was $26,000. Contrary to all precedents in their be- 
stowal of financial aid, the Trustees appropriated $12,000 for a 
new building for a model school or school of observation, 
which has just been completed, and in-which there is now in 
operation. a primary school of thirty-six children. The purpose 
of this school is to illustrate the most approved modern meth- 
ods of teaching children; and the higher classes in the Normal 
College spend a portion of their time in observing and study- 
ing the work that is done in this primary school. 
  ‘For the current year the appropriation made by the Peabody 
Board for the suppott of the College will exceed $15,000. 
hould be kept in mind that Tennessee is enabled to main- 
ie ® . ‘
-P-A-G-E-425
—3— 
tain, at a nominal cost, an institution of the first class for the 
education of teachers, which, under ordinary circumstances, 
would require an annual outlay from the State treasury of 
$40,000, without taking into account the cost of buildings and 
grounds, which, in this case, are worth at least $125,000, and 
are furnished gratuitously by the Trustees of the University of 
Nashville. 
The best investment a State can make is in an educational 
institution of wide scope, which, by its excellencies, will attract 
public attention, and which will invite within the borders of 
the Commonwealth the intelligence and wealth of the country. 
It is the avowed purpose of the Peabody Board of Trust to 
make this Normal College the most complete institution of its 
kind on this continent. Its ultimate location is by no means 
determined, but when the final decision is made it will turn very 
largely on local sympathy and local support. It is foreseen 
that the State,which secures the Normal College will outrank 
every other State in the advantages to be derived from it, and 
it will be expected that the favored State will co-operate with 
the Peabody Board in its endowment and support. 
During the year 1889-90, the general course of study was re- 
vised, and the’scheme of instruction now stands as follows:

EXPLANATION oF CouRSsES. 
| The instruction given in the college is divided among the different branches of learning in the form of. courses of study. 
  ,: A fall course comprises five exercises a week during a semes- 
ter, whether in recitations, laboratory work, or lectures, It is not. necessary that the exercises constituting a full course be in 
one and the same branch of study. Thus a part (for instance, 
a two-fifths course) may be in mathematics; a part, say two- 
fifths, in Greek; and a part, say one-fifth, in Latin, making a total of five-tifths, or one full course. 
DueRees OFFERED. 
» The college degree proper is that of Licentiate of Instruction, _ and the greater number of students will doubtless be graduated 
  
-P-A-G-E-431
—4— 
from this course; but provision is made for students who take 
advanced standing on entrance, or who prefer to spend a longer 
period in study, by offering courses leading to university degrees. 
In the A.B. course prominence is given to mathematics and the 
ancient languages; in the B.S. course, to the physical sciences ; 
and in the B.L., course, to literature and the modern languages. 
ReQuirEMENTS FOR DuGREEs, 
To obtain the degree of Licentiate of Instruction the student 
must complete eighteen full courses, of which the following are 
prescribed: « 
In Latin—Courses 1 or 8 or 5, 2 or 4 or 6, 7 and 8. 
In philosophy—Course 1 in psychology; courses 1, 2, 3, 4 in 
pedagogy. 
In mathematics—Courses 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. 
In English—Courses 1, 2, 8, 4, 6, 12. 
In history—Courses 1, 2, 6, 8, 9. 
In chemistry—Course 1. 
In physics—Course 1. 
‘In biology—Oourse 1. 
In music—Two hours a week through three years. 
From the other courses offered he must choose and complete 
enough to make in all eighteen full courses. 
To obtain the degree of Bachelor of Arts the student must 
complete twenty-four full courses, of which are prescribed, in 
addition to those required for the Licentiate of Instruction, the 
following: 
In Greek-——Courses 1, 2. 
In Latin—Courses 9, 10. 
In philosophy—Courses 5 and 6 in pedagogy. 
In French—Courses 1, 2, or 
In German—Courses 1, 2. 
In English—Course 13. 
In music—Two hours a week through one year.
-P-A-G-E-432
—15— 
From the other courses offered he must select and complete 
enough to make in all twenty-four fall courses. 
To obtain the degree of Bachelor of Science the student 
must complete twenty-six full courses, of which are prescribed, 
in addition to those required for Licentiate of Instruction, the 
following : : 
In philosophy—Courses 5 and 6 in pedagogy. 
In chemistry—Courses 2, 8, 4, 5, 6. 
Tn physics—Course 2. 
In biology—Courses 2, 3, 4. 
In French—Courses 1, 2, or 
In German—Courses 1, 2. 
From the other courses offered he must choose and complete 
enough to make in all twenty-six full courses. 
To obtajn the degree of Bachelor of Letters, the student must 
complete twenty-six full courses, of which the following are 
prescribed: 
In philosophy—Course 1 in psychology; Courses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6 in pedagogy. 
In mathematics—Courses 1, 2, 8, 5, 6. 
In English—Courses 1, 2, 8, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 18, 14, 16.

In biology—Course 1. 
In music—two hours a week through four years. 
“In addition to these, the student must choose and complete 
. enough from the other courses offered to make in all twenty-six 
full courses. 
~ An examination of the foregoing shows that of the eighteen 
_ eourses required for the degree of Licentiate of Instruction,
-P-A-G-E-433
—16— 
sixteen and four-fifths are prescribed;. of the twenty-four 
courses required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, twenty- 
three and two-fifths are prescribed; and of the twenty-six 
courses required for the degrees of Bachelor of Science and 
Bachelor of Letters, twenty-four and one-fifth and twenty-three 
and three-fifths, respectively, are prescribed. 
In addition to the courses thus left to personal choice, there 
js another margin for elective work. The course of study has 
been so arranged that an average of fifteen hours a week is re- 
quired of those studying for the Licentiate of Instruction and 
the Bachelor of Arts degrees, and a fraction over sixteen hours 
of those studying for the degrees of Bachelor of Science and 
Bachelor of Letters. It is probable that many will find them- 
selves able to take a larger number of hours, and in that case 
they will have entire liberty in the choice of their electives, 
subject only to the natural condition of requisite preparation to 
pursue profitably the particular study. 
ADVANCED STANDING. 
Scholarship students will be credited, on entrance, with five 
full courses; and students in general will have the privilege of 
being examined for advanced standing in any prescribed study 
if application is made within two weeks after entrance. If the 
examination is satisfactory, credit will be given for the study 
thus passed.

  Mempuis, July 1, 1890. 
The Tennessee State Teachers’ Association met in its twenty- 
sixth annual session at Higbee School, at 8:30 p.m. 
Prof. W. 8. Jones called the meeting to order. On the plat- 
form with the acting President sat Judge J. M. Greer, the 
speaker of the evening; Prof. W. M. Baskerville, Secretary ; 
Prof. Frank Goodman, and Prof. M. Davis. 
The Rev. W. M. Baskerville, of Vanderbilt University, opened 
the meeting with prayer. 
Prof. Wharton Jones read a letter from President Z. H. 
Brown, of Nashville, expressing his regrets at his inability to be 
present during the sittings of the Association. A large num- 
ber of new pupils had been added to the Nashville schools, and 
.@ large area of country had been added to the city of Nashville, 
-. all of which demanded more or less of Prof. Brown’s attention. 
     
   Prof. Jones introduced to the Association Judge J. M. Greer, 
“Swho, delivered the address of welcome.- Judge Greer spoke 
‘upon the past, present, and prospective future of the educational 
advantages of Tennessee. He said: 
‘Ladies and Gentlemen— Teachers of Tennessee: 
“That was a beautiful idea which had its birth in the far Kast, 
" vused the peoples of the oldest civilization to always re- 
he stranger who knocked at their gates. They had been
-P-A-G-E-445
“490 
taught by the humanely wise teachers of that time that the 
stranger, unknown to the host, might be an angel of the Most 
High. To-day a great city—great even in its mournful past, 
greater in its vigorous, pushing present, and greatest in its 
shining certain future—feels what the host of the Orient hoped: 
that the angel has knocked at the gates. The Memphis of to- 
day, therefore, with none of the superstition of the Memphis of 
a thousand thousand yesterdays, bids you enter the doors. We 
feel that the honor thus given us may help you, and will cer- 
tainly advance the proud old Commonwealth of Tennessee. 
The papers read here, the discussions following those readings, 
and the social mingling of the men and women who will so 
largely mold the thought of the next generation, must needs 
raise you yet higher in worthy aims, and push our State yet 
further toward the van of progress. Thanks to the wisdom of 
our public men, we have attached the anchor of common sense 
to most of the theories which the learned have caused us to put 
into the forms of laws. Asa State, we have been freed from 
even the discussion of that baleful grief of sectarian attacks 
upon our common schools. With us the only rivalry between 
the public and private school has been the generous and friendly 
one as to which will most liberalize the understanding and 
broaden the minds of our children. In many of the States 
north of us the most vital question for their citizens to deter- 
mine has become whether narrow-minded prejudice, masking 
under the holy name of religion, shall dominate in the teaching 
of their children, or whether broad-minded toleration of all 
creeds. May the day remain distant with us when any conflict 
between any Church and our schools shall arise. 
“Under the recent election statute, which requires the pay- 
ment of the poll-tax before voting, and the old law which re- 
quires this poll-tax to be appropriated to our public schools, 
our revenue for the training of the young will soon become 
munificent. Tennessee can then take not only the first place 
among her sisters in reforming the ballot and pacifying elec- 
tions, but will also-be first in educating her children. 
“Feeling that your meeting here will add much to the good
-P-A-G-E-446
    —i1— 
of. mankind, Memphis, through me as her spokesman, most 
gladly and most cordially bids you welcome.” 
The response to the address of welcome was delivered by 
Prof. Charles W. Kent, of the University of Tennessee, at 
Knoxville. He read an able paper upon education. He advo- 
cated a broad, liberal education. No matter what sphere of life 
a man operated in, a superstructure reared upon a broad foun- 
dation was preferable to one built upon a narrow one. “The 
judgment of aman educated only in one line of thinking is 
not reliable, even in that line.” He spoke an hour and a quar- 
ter. 
~ Prof. Jones said he had expected to hear from a number of 
Memphis gentlemen, but had been disappointed in not,seeing 
them present. But one gentleman was present who had been 
invited to make a speech—Col. Robert Gates, Secretary of the 
Commercial Association. 
He was introduced, and made a good speech. He explained 
that the badges which the teachers will wear during the Asso- 
' ciation will pass them free upon all the street-cars of the city, 
upon the dummy line, and upon the steam-boats plying to and 
from West Side, Prospect Park, and other places on the river. 
Prof. Jones then announced that the forenoon of the next 
day would be occupied by various committees in formulating 
their reports, which would be discussed at the afternoon session. 
The reports of the committees will be published as presented by 
: the committees for discussion. 
After the exercises, the Association was given a reception in 
“the parlors of the Higbee School, where refreshments were 
“tauch enjoyed by all. Ata late hour the happy assembly dis- 
_ persed for the night.

Prof. George D. Holmes, Chairman of the Executive Com- 
mittee, made a partial report, which was adopted, and is as fol- 
lows: 
“Wuereas, The proposition has been made by a number of 
leading teachers in the South looking to the organization of a 
Southern Teachers’ Association; and, 
_“ Wuereas, There was held on the ninth of June, in Mont- 
gomery, Ala., a convention of teachers for the purpose of com- 
pleting such an organization, and that such an organization 
was completed at Montgomery on June 27, 1890; and, 
“ Wuereas, There are certain questions vital to our section of 
country in regard to our educational interests that can be dis- 
cussed more freely and profitably in such an association as is 
proposed; therefore, be it 
“1. Resolved, That the State Teachers’ Assuciation favors such 
an organization and cordially approves of the same, provided 
there is nothing in its aims and purposes to antagonize or in- 
terfere with the National Educational Association. 
“2. Resolved, That we suggest that the meetings of the 
Southern Educational Association, for above reasons, be held 
during the winter, and in some one of the Southern cities. 
“Gzoraz D. Homes, 
“Chairman.” 
Nothing could have been brought before the Association of 
more interest than that embodied in these resolutions. The 
project has a history. There are local objections to leaving all 
suggestions pertaining to educational interests in the South to a 
National Convention which meets almost exclusively in the 
North. 
Some time ago the State Superintendent of Public Instruction 
of North Carolina originated a Provincial Educational Associ- 
ation at Moorehead City, N. C., which antagonized the Na- 
tional Educational Association. Against this went up a strong 
protest from the leading educators in most southern States.
-P-A-G-E-448
—13— 
They organized a Southern Educational Society, at: Mont- 
gomery, Ala., June 27, ult., at which were representative educa- 
tors from each southern State. The Hon. Solomon Palmer, of 
Alabama, was elected President, and Prof. Frank Goodman, of 
Nashville, Secretary. <A large Executive Committee was ap- 
pointed, composed of many of the leading scholastics of the 
South. Its purpose is to take under consideration subjects . 
which do not come within the scope of the National Association, 
and which are more distinctively provincial in their character. 
_ itis for Southern teachers. It will co-operate with and be a 
feeder to the National Association. It will hold its meetings in 
the winter. ‘ 
Miss- Nellie O’Donnell read an interesting paper upon har- 
mony among the different schools of the country. The paper 
was in the nature of a report, and was well written and received. 
“Miss Jennie Higbee, Chairman of the Committee on Har- 
amouy between the Schools, Public, Private, City, and Country, 
‘read a lengthy report formulated by that committee. It was a 
‘well-written report, in which a broad, liberal view was taken of 
‘the provinces of the various schools; but it drew the line. The 
charmony should be such a union as ‘would help each school in 
‘its work, but the work of each is entirely distinct, and, to some 
extent, self-reliant. The committee laid down a high standard

TENURE OF OFFICE. 
rof..J. H. Allen, of Shelbyville, Chairman of the Committee 
‘enure of Office, made a brief talk, after which Miss Mollie 
erce,.of Dyersburg, read an interesting paper upon the ten- 
; Tank, and pay of primary teachers. Her address in full is 
‘follows:

“Friends and Co-workers in the Grand and Noble Cause of the 
New Education : 
“T appear before you to-day in behalf of its merits, with ex- 
tended hands, uplifted energies, ready and willing at any and 
all times to say or do what I can to promote the cause. My 
theme is that of tenure, rank, and pay of primary teachers, the 
efficacy of which lies deeply within the merits of itself, and not 
in the power of the speaker to bring it out. ‘Hence, I feel my 
inability to treat the subject justly. Should I speak too kindly 
of primary work, or laud too highly the efforts of those labor- 
ing conscientiously to bring out effectually the ‘deep meaning 
which is said to lie in childish play,’ you may exclaim with fer- 
vor, She is one who loves her work and feels with proper assur- 
ance that no office should be regarded with greater respect. 
“Before I would speak of tenure I would first consider rank. 
It is natural to suppose that ere we would elect a person for a 
term of office we would first consider well his or her ability to 
fill said place. We admit thatthe profession has in previous 
years been somewhat abused. Others than professional talent 
have not only aspired but entered the field, thereby weakening 
the cause and damaging the mind of the child. It is now we 
would have a true picture, and begin to draw by saying there is 
no higher calling than that of training the plastic mind. To 
the primary teacher is intrusted the care of guiding spiritually, 
directing mentally, and developing physically every organ of 
the child. Hence, it is incumbent upon her to understand 
something of psychology—how the mind works, how knowl- 
edge is best commuinicated to it, and what effect such knowl- 
edge is likely to have upon the mind. Only a true teacher 
can be worthy of this great trust or impending duty which she 
would assume. She realizes the ultimate importance of under- 
standing her profession, and shows that the success or failure of 
work or a part of the school-system must rest with her. Any 
such erroneous idea as primary work being only an A B C class, 
or only. that which could be done bya teacher of ordinary 
ability, has long since passed away. Here the best talent is 
needed, and until it can be secured the best results cannot so 
much as be hoped for. There was in previous years some such
-P-A-G-E-450
— 15 — 
spirit prevailing as rank in this-line—teachers climbing with 
aspiration from the primary department to the first grammar 
grades and upward as fast as circumstances would allow. It 
would still be so if the primary school was considered the low- 
est-round in the professional ladder. We would not see this 
work longer abused, so we had some good people who, in spite 
of. such spirits, or from their love for the little ones, remain in 
the cause, accomplishing results which only teachers of profes- 
sional talent could-‘do. If at any time it should be necessary to 
utilize an untrained teacher, place her in any other department 
rather than here. 
“Public opinion along this line necessitates improvement. 
When brought to bear, trustees will be compelled to secure or 
attempt to secure properly trained teachers. The attempt will 
reveal the.necessity for paying better salaries or dispensing with 
better service. This will increase better respect for the teacher, 
and his vocation will be regarded more and more asa profes- 
sion. For the selection of professional workers there will be a 
more careful selection of trustees, since only those will be ac- 
knowledged competent to serve who have bestowed some pains 
on their own education, and are in a special sense fitted for the 
position. As is the teacher, so is the school. A professional 
teacher chooses the work for life, and is whole-hearted, beget- 
ting success because he is not engaged in the work as a means 
of'a stepping-stone to something else. If he is worthy of the 
cause he is worthy of the office. So, having arrived at a con- 
‘Clusion of trained teachers, we feel prepared to speak of terms. 
- ©The manner of holding the position should be by an: elec- 
‘tion of a competent Board of Directors. This position being 
“of co-ordinate rank with any other department in the school, 
the-election of the teacher should be equal in importance and 
: authority. 
. As to the length of term of holding position, there are two 
-agpects of the subject to be considered. (1) From the stand- 
‘point of the teacher's life-work. (2) How long should an indi- 
vidual be elected to serve without re-election, or what should 
be the term of service?
-P-A-G-E-451
—16— 
“1. No one should engage in the primary work with a 
view of promotion to a higher or more important sphere in the 
work of education. There is none more important, and none 
higher in the sense of promotion. Therefore, the teacher who 
begins primary work with such a view, begins with a false idea 
of the great work of education, and necessarily proceeds on a 
false line, and will inevitably conclude in failure. The individ- 
ual should grasp it as the chief object of life, and should, there- 
fore, begin it and perfect it as his or her life-work. 
“2, Tow long should be the. term of service to which the 
teacher should be elected? 
“The argument in favor of short terms of service by public 
servants or any one dependent upon the selection of others for 
the position he holds, is that the constant sense of dependence 
upon the good opinions of the public serves for maintenance 
and continuance in the practice, stimulates the incumbent to 
greater diligence. Some such motive is not necessary to incite 
one who has set his heart upon the high and sacred work of 
developing mind and forming character. This argument may 
be of force in civil government, but never in the case of a 
teacher consecrated to her work. Again, that very sense of 
dependence, uncertainty, and the consciousness that all her 
efforts must be reviewed and estimated annually by men of 
widely different views, disqualifies the faithful teacher to a great 
degree.- * 
“The argument in favon of a long term of service is that it 
guarantees experience and wisdom. Especially in the school- 
room is this true. The teacher becomes thoroughly familiar 
with her scholars, and learns well the adaptation of the best 
means and methods to the end in view. I do not think the 
term should be indefinite. So long as human natyre remains as 
it is, or has been, it will result in the idea of being indefinitely 
bound to a particular place or parties or person. Therefore, 
the term should be of such a length as to secure stability and 
experience on the one hand and to beget contentment and sat- 
isfaction on the other. I favor a four-year tenure, subject to
-P-A-G-E-452
—17— 
- re-election if desirable. “To be brief and in conclusion, I will 
say that, inasmuch as the primary teacher holds the most im- 
portant position in the school, it is necessary that she be paid a 
sum equal to, if not greater than any other class of teachers.” 
Several speeches followed in the discussion, and, at a late 
hour, the interesting afternoon session was brought to a close 
by an adjournment until.8 p.m. 
Seconp Day—Niaut Session, 
_ A large audience gathered at the Higbee School to listen to 
the exercises of the Association, The people were not tired in 
the least. They came early and engaged in social intercourse. 
_- Professor Bingham, of N. orth Carolina, arrived at noon, and 
was substituted on the programme for one who was absent. 
Betore the session opened Prof. W. 8. Jones’ military com- 
pauy, the Memphis Institute Cadets, entered the chapel in true 
military order, and afterward gave an exhibition drill to the 
delight of the large audience. The boys did admirably. They 
were self-possessed, and, as young warriors who have never yet 
smelt powder, won hearty applause. This drill followed a short 
address of Prof. Wharton Jones upon “The Effect of Military 
Training in Schools.” 
' Professor Baskerville, of Vanderbilt University, read an able 
paper upon “The Relation of Schools and Colleges.” This 
address opened up the discussion of the evening. Like individ- 
“ual competitors, schools and colleges often become jealous of 
one encroachment upon the grounds of the other. 
       Professor Baskerville said: “Education in the United States 
is,divided into four departments—primary, secondary, collegiate, 
and university—including professional. The ground occupied 
‘by each of these is well detined, with the exception of the 
--seeond. Where secondary education begins is well enough 
‘skiown; but where it should end is the question. There is, 
“therefore, a chasm between primary and collegiate instruction      
-P-A-G-E-453
— 18 — 
which has been bridged only here and there at rare intervals by 
our educational engineers. As has been ably pointed out, this 
is the one serious defect in our national system of edugation. 
Only in America does this state of things exist. 
“The public schools—Rugby, Eaton, Harrow, Westminster, 
ete.—in England, the lycees in France, and the gymnasia in 
Germany have perfectly well-defined and distinct courses of 
study, the completion of which is necessary to entrance into 
the great colleges and universities of those countries. This 
method is based on sound common sense and experience, for 
this kind of training is essential to genuine, thorough scholar- 
ship and the formation of true, manly character. The second- 
ary schools should be the nurseries of the colleges. Any one 
who has transplanted trees from the virgin forest knows that 
he is as likely to get hold of a worthless scrub as of a live, vig- 
orous young tree. 
“The true relation, then, between the college and the second- 
ary school is the same as that which exists between the house 
and its foundation. All the usual make-shifts devised to take 
the place of the secondary schools—viz: preparatory depart- 
ments, lowering the standard for admission to college, granting 
degrees on meager. and insufficient courses of study—simply 
bring education into contempt. There is small wonder that 
business men misunderstand and underrate what we call educa- 
tion, since it means such different things in different colleges. 
The secondary school and the college have distinctly different 
ends in view. In the former the government should be pater- 
nal and character for life should be formed. The great head- 
masters, like Arnold, of Rugby, our Binghams.and our Webbs 
in the South, have done more to form character than all the 
professors in our colleges. In this formative period of life, boys 
should be brought into that direct personal contact and pater- 
nal relation which enabled Milton’s, Dryden’s, Burke’s, and 
Thomas Jefferson’s teachers to mold and shape the lives of 
these immortals, as they themselves so gratefully acknowledged. 
This is almost impossible if boys are brought into daily assucia- 
tion with young men, They become not manly but maunish.
-P-A-G-E-454
—i19 — 
On the other hand, if admitted to college when immature in 
mind and in morals, they fall by the wayside, and the fowls of 
irresolution, indecision, intemperance, and despair pluck them 
up and devour them. 
“ How shall we, then, establish this necessary relation of the 
college to the secondary school? 
“1. By establishing more of these schools, and by encourag- 
ing those that exist, and not entering into competition with 
them. 
“9. By the adoption of a uniform standard for admission to 
college, and putting our ban upon all those colleges that do not 
come up to it and stand by it. 
“Tf this course is gradually but steadily and courageously 
pursued, excellent academies will spring up all over our State, 
and it will take the lead in this great and much needed reform.” 
The next paper was read by Prof. W. D. Mooney, of Frank- 
lin. His subject was, “ What Requirements Should be Em- 
braced in the Standard for Entrance to College?” Prof. 
‘Mooney said: 
“Mr. Chairman and Members of the Association: 
“In the beginning, let me say that while part of my remarks 
may seem harsh, I have no bitterness toward any institution to 
‘which I shall allude, and no desire whatever to disparage or 
find fault. In considering the proper requirements for admis- 
sion to college, I shall. confine myself to the requirements for 
the A.B. degree, and more particularly to the preparation in 
-Latin, Greek, and thathematics, as it seems to me that these, 
with a knowledge of our mother-tongue, form the foundation 
of all scholarship. Just how much or how little Greek and 
Latin should be required for graduation does not come within 
the limits of my subject. The only question for consideration 
-is, ‘What preparation ought.a boy to have in order that he may 
énter college?’ At the outset, those of us who have charge of 
training-schools are confronted with the question, ‘For what 
college shall we fit our boys?’ 
o 5—App.D-E-F-G
-P-A-G-E-455
— 20 — 
“Glancing over the catalogues of the various colleges and 
universities, we find a wonderful difference in the requirements 
for admission. For instance, one university requires no Greek 
and only ten months in Latin, while it admits boys at the age of 
fifteen. In a recent catalogue, not the latest, however, the pro- 
fessor of Latin congratulates himself that the Latin preparation 
has been put at only ten months, stating as a reason for this 
self-congratulation, that this enables him to keep the students 
one year longer under his tuition, at an age when they are more 
appreciative. Such requirements and such reasoning seem to 
me to render secondary schools unnecessary. Practically, this 
says to us, ‘Send us two-thirds of your best students. Do one 
year of drudgery for us, and we are content. So shall you re- 
ceive our blessing and depart in peace.’ Yet the same institu- 
tion appeals to high-schools for their support, on the ground 
that it has done away with its preparatory department. True, 
but simply to bring us into sharp competition with the uni- 
versity itself. For one, I object to such unequal competition. 
“You will pardon me for being so blunt, but when a college 
publishes its requirements for admission, those requirements 
become public property, and I take it for granted that we are 
here to ascertain: First, what our colleges do require; second, 
what they ought to exact; and, third, if possible, to bring about 
some uniformity of action on their part. Let them see what 
we who are at the head of fitting-schools are expected to do, 
and we will do it, or give way to men who can. 
“Still another university confers the A.B. degree on those 
who have studied Greek but one year, no preparation being re- 
quired, while scholarship students are simply advised to come 
with one year’s preparation in Latin. 
“Three years ago we had two boys who wére class-mates. One 
graduated from a certain university with the degree of C.E. 
before the other had entered the freshman class in Vanderbilt, 
Yet the latter had lost no time from school and was decidedly 
the superior, both in ability and application. 
“These are simply a few examples. It may be that I am do-
-P-A-G-E-456
—21— 
ing an unwise thing in thus seemingly antagonizing certain in- 
stitutions. I do so not with the view of disparaging any school, 
but simply to show what difficulties are in the way and how lit- 
‘tle uniformity exists among the colleges. Preparation for en- 
trance into one means graduation from another. 
“So far, we have striven to fit our boys for entrance into col- 
lege, giving them in Latin at least four books of Ceesar’s Gallic 
War, four of Cicero’s Orations, and four books of Virgil’s 
Aineid. This is minimum. Generally we read, in addition, 
selections from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, as well as require ex-° 
ercises in sight translation. Proper preparation for college, it 
seems to me, should presuppose familiarity with the declension 
,of nouns and adjectives, a thorough knowledge of the verb, 
syntax, of cases, the ability to explain the uses of subjunctive 
modes and to convert direct discourse into indirect, and vice 
versa. Of course the candidate should be able to readily render 
into Latin any ordinarily difficult English sentence. He should 
also be conversant with the laws of dactylic hexameter verse. 
This course should cover four years. , 
“In Greek he should read four books of the Anabasis and two 
' of the Iliad. Add to this daily drill in the writing of exercises, 
declension of nouns, adjectives, and participles, with due observ- 
ance of the laws of accent, explanation of euphonic changes, 
classification of verbs, the most thorough familiarity with the 
verb in all modes, tenses, numbers, and persons, and the ability 
to classify all subjunctives and optatives, as well as to point out 
dialectic differences, and you have prepared a boy for college in 
Greek. 
“In teaching our mother-tongue, the most important and 
most difficult work we have to do, a boy should learn not only 
grammatical rules, but how to apply them. In other words, no 
boy is ready for college who cannot write a decent letter, or 
correctly and clearly express his views on some subject with 
‘which he is familiar. He should, for example, after reading 
‘Ivanhoe,’ be able to take-any character in the book and write 
a decent essay on it. Spelling, punctuation, grammatical ac-
-P-A-G-E-457
— 22 — 
curacy, aud style should all be considered. He should be 
drilled to logical analysis to give him that mental grip which 
his early work in the classics fails to supply, thus applying 
reason to language. He should also be well read. A good 
library is an essential in a training-school. Map out a judicious 
course of reading for a boy. In this way you broaden the mind 
and cultivate the imagination, frequently giving to the boy his 
future bent. . 
“In mathematics a boy should be ‘up’ on algebra, through 
_ quadratics and the binomial theorem, while he should have 
completed geometry, plain, solid, and spherical. I believe I. 
would not hesitate to add trigonometry. But this work in 
geometry can be done in the training-school in one year, and 
well done, too. I believe that none of our schools require more 
than six books of geometry for entrance, while some are con- 
tent with three, and many demand none. I think an examina- 
tion of the college catalogues will show that the work required 
in mathematics during the freshman year is excessive, and it 
seems to me that this change would give the new student some 
relief, which is much needed. His first year in college should 
be the easiest, not the hardest. 
“Tn German and in science there should be one year of. care- 
ful preparation. 
“ Now, the question is, ‘ Will not the colleges do something to 
bring about uniformity in their requirements for admission?’ 
I mean such colleges as have been mentioned in this paper, for 
there is a class of these colleges whose only business seems to 
be to try to discover what Balaam’s ass said, whose chief recre- 
ation is dubbing some unfortunate fellow D.D., and whose only 
claim to the title of college is that they oceupy a building three 
stories high. Such schools are neither fish, fowl, nor good red 
herring, and do not fall within the scope of this paper. 
“Tt is useless for colleges to raise a clamor about the lack of” 
training-schools; when many of them have but one condition 
or admission—ability to pay the fees. Why dilate on the scarc-
-P-A-G-E-458
— 23 — 
ity of secondary schools when your requirements practically do 
away with them, when your low standard can be reached by 
boys from primary schools? Why not settle on some standard 
which will admit a boy to any college in the State? or, if this 
cannot be done, Jet the colleges that require nothing say so dis- 
tinctly, and let training-schoo] men fit their boys for those col- 
leges that have a high standard of scholarship.” 
Prof. Robert Bingham, of Bingham, N. C., was next intro- 
duced. He comes trom a family of teachers.. The Bingham 
text-books are read in school, and are very popular with the 
people. When he was introduced, the house broke out into a 
storm of applause. He spoke for an hour, and held the closest 
attention of his auditors: every moment. His subject was, 
“Should Colleges Maintain Preparatory Departments?” He 
negatived the proposition. Te made a masterly argument in 
favor of severing the preparatory schools entirely from the col- | 
lege and the university. He contrasted American with Oriental 
institutions. He deplored the paucity of full-fledged colleges in 
this country, and attributed much of the fault to the fact of our 
schools trying to carry “prep” schools with them. He called 
them colleges with “prep” school tails tied tothem. He hit 
several back-handed strokes at the loose and careless manner 
and habits of American schools in conferring degrees upon per- 
sons unworthy of the honor. He deplored the practice of send- 
ing boys to inferior sectarian schools in preference to well- 
equipped State institutions. Prot. Bingham’s speech was deliv- 
ered without manuscript, and was again and again applauded. 
While many held views somewhat at variance with the speak- 
er’s views, still he was applauded for his frankness and candor 
in expressing these views. 
He was followed by Professor Crockett, of Union City, upon 
“The Relation of the Public High-school to the College.” His 
address was pointed and practical, and was read in a clear tone. 
Mr. Crockett evinced a close acquaintance with the issues in- 
volved in his subject. 
The last address of the evening was delivered by Prof. J. B.
-P-A-G-E-459

Williams, of Brunswick. His theme was “ What Shall be Done 
with the Dull Pupils who Cannot Attain the Required Standard 
to Enter College?” He read a strong paper, and made valuable 
suggestions in fall sympathy with those struggling to gain a 
high education. 
Prof. Frank Goodman, Secretary, read the following tele- 
‘grams received by him from St. Paul: 
“The National Educational Association sends warmest greet- 
ings with delightful anticipations of the coming reunion. 
“James H. CANFIELD, 
“President.” 
“St. Paul sends greetings, and invites Tennessee to come to 
the National Educational Association, Will give you a warm 
welcome and cold climate. 8. Suerrn, 
“Secretary Local Hxecutive Committee.” 
“Visitors coming in rapidly. Hope Memphis meeting will 
be a grand success. Arrangements for entertaining the South- 
ern delegation are satisfactory. W. R. Garrert, 
“Secretary.” 
He was instructed by the Association to wire responses to 
these greetings to the senders. Messages were sent as per in- 
structions. 
The'programme set for the night session was not more than 
half completed when the hour of adjournment arrived. 
The convention adjourned to meet in the morning at 9:30 
o’clock. 
Tuarrp Day——-Mornine Sussion. 
The Association met as per adjournment, with Vice-president 
W. J. Grannis in the chair.

‘ ELECTION OF OFFICERS. 
Prof. W.'T. White read a report from the Executive Com- 
mittee, which was unanimously adopted, and was as follows: 
“We recommend that the following named persons be elected 
officers of this Association for the ensuing year, to wit: 
“ President.—W. 8. Jones, Memphis. 
“ First Vice-president.—T. C. Karns, Knoxville. 
“Second Vice-president.—W. M. Baskerville, Nashville. 
“ Third Vice-president—Miss Jenny Higbee, Memphis. 
“ Secretary.—F rank Goodman, Nashville. 
« Hxecutive Committee.— Frank M: Smith, Nashville, Chairman 
H. D. Huffaker, Chattanooga; W.T. White, Knoxville; W. J

“ We recommend that the next meeting of this Association 
be held on Lookout Mountain, with the view of- permanently 
locating there if suitable arrangements can be made.

The subject of National Associations and Institutes was the 
first subject discussed. 
In speaking upon this question, Professor Jones took occasion 
to dwell upon the proud place Tennessee occupies in the 
National Educational Association. Professor Garrett, a Ten- 
nessean, was Secretary, and by the grace of God and a few 
votes will be President next year. Professor Goodman, him- 
self, and others are on the Executive Committee. . He deplored 
the imaginary division of this State into Eastern, Western, and 
Middle Tennessee. He belonged to the whole State. He loved 
‘West Tennessee, his present home. :
-P-A-G-E-461
~~ 26 — 
Prof. W. J. Grannis spoke upon “Special Educational Asso- 
ciations.” He made a specialty of preparing students for a 
broad, liberal, thorough education. 
Prof. T. C. Karns, of Knoxville, read the report of the Com- 
mittee on Teachers’ Associations. Among other things, the 
committee recommended that Lookout Mountain be selected as 
the permanent place of holding the annual meetings of this 
Association. The advisability of this selection was discussed 
at some length. 
Vice-president Grannis introduced Mrs. W. H. Horton, of 
Memphis, who read the report of the Committee on Supervision. 
She supplemented the report with appropriate remarks. Mrs. 
Horton was formerly one of the School Commissioners of 
Shelby County. She made a most favorable mention of Shelby 
County schools. The term is lengthening, the salaries are bet- 
ter, the buildings are being made of a more utilitarian charac- 
ter, and there are no better schools in the State than those of 
Memphis. 
She was followed in short speeches upon the report, made by 
Prof. Grannis, Dr. Johnson, of Collierville, and others. 
THE SUPERINTENDENT AND TEACHER. 
Prof. W. T. White, of Knoxville, read an interesting address 
upon the relation of these two closely-related personages. His 
treatment of this practical subject was able, and his sentiments 
well received. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Prof. W. T. Magruder, of Vanderbilt University, spoke upon 
“Manual Training in Schools and Colleges.’ He is professor 
of this department in Vanderbilt. He had on exhibition spec- 
imens of work made by students in his department. He had 
miniature anvils, chisels, bolts, hammers, and screws made by 
young men training for blacksmithing. He had specimens of 
moldings from plaster of Paris, and all kinds of mechanical 
implements with which to illustrate his progressive ideas of the
-P-A-G-E-462
— 27 — 
workings of a school of manual training. His address con- 
tained many novel ideas, and, though somewhat lengthy, was 
listened to with profound interest. This school designs to pro- 
mote (1) mental training, (2) thinking in a business way, (8) 
thinkers and workers in the most practical method. He ex- 
ploded the idea that his school trained men alone to be mechan- 
ics. Nothing of the kind. When a mother asked her daughter 
to go into the kitchen and learn to cook, she did not always 
intend her daughter to become a cook for life. [Some one 
suggested that it was a good thing for the young husbands 
that the young ladies did not become cooks.| His speech was 
highly appreciated. 
SCHOOL-LIBRARIES. 
Prof. W. T. White, Chairman of the Committee on School- 
libraries, read an interesting report upon the subject. The 
paper is as follows: 
“No teacher, no one interested in the proper education of the 
young, can avoid feelings of alarm as he notes the evil influence 
of pernicious literature, which, ever increasing, is pouring out 
daily so abundantly from so many of the printing presses of 
our land. The question naturally arises, How may this evil in- 
fluence be averted? What incentives or precautions: may be 
taken so that this potent agency, so fraught with good or ill, 
that mighty weapon so essential to every one’s success—the 
habit of reading as a rule what is the highest and best in litera- 
ture—may be secured? The response to this question years ago 
has been given in the eastern and western developed portions of 
our country, where it is almost impossible to go in a school, be . 
it district, township, or what not, and not find at least some- 
thing in the way of a school-library. They before believed that 
one of the most valuable adjuncts of a successful school is a 
carefully selected and well-managed library. The reading habit 
and the taste for good literature are matters of cultivation, and 
the same should be begun in childhood. The teacher has the 
pupil under his charge during his most impressionable age, and 
just as soon as he has ledrned to read no one will gainsay the 
fact that the majority of them will be sure to read other books 
besides text-books. In many, and perhaps in the majority, of
-P-A-G-E-463
— 28 — 
cases, the books will be of a proper character—those selected 
by the home folks or drawn from Sunday-school libraries, etc. 
Again, a number will read books suggested to them by com- 
panions and playmates. A goodly number, too, will not care 
for reading at all unless by some means his interest is developed 
in the matter. The great agency in this most important work 
of directing the reading of the young lies in the hands of the 
teacher, provided he has something in the way of a library at 
his command. No one will doubt the statement that the teacher 
has it in his power to call the attention of. pupils to books in 
which he knows they will become interested, and will be pro- 
ductive of much good. No boy has read “Little Lord Faun- 
tleroy,” or girl read “Little Women” or “Old Fashioned Girl” 
without being a better child at home, a better pupil in school, 
and better playmate on the school-ground. But how often is 
it necessary to furnish the pupil with these books before he will 
read them? “Yet when once a bright boy or girl has been 
found and interested and started in reading, he is almost sure to 
continue under those influences all his life. Never was there a 
truer saying than that many a man dates an era in his life from the 
reading of a good book. The teacher, to accomplish the greatest 
good in this line, must have a library at his disposal ; must have 
the books where he can show them, read extracts from them; 
make the pupils take a personal interest inthem. The State 
or county must recognize libraries as necessary companions to 
the most successful school. 
“Long ago such men as Horace Mann and Henry Barnard 
said that the privileges and encouragement of libraries aid pop- 
ular education. If we are to educate the masses we must put 
into their hands the best reading, and thus say they must come 
through libraries. Has ever a teacher thought seriously how 
much comes from schools, and how much from reading? How 
often isthe best work of the school-room neutralized by the 
vicious literature so abundant on book-stalls. Yet in many an 
instance this reading has come through ignorance of better lit- 
erature or delights. . 
“Tn district schools, above all, should there be an attempt to
-P-A-G-E-464
—29 — 
establish something in the way of libraries. But, then, the 
question arises, How are the means to be obtained? In reply, 
it may be said that for the county or State to appropriate a cer- 
tain amount for this purpose, will only result in increased effi- 
ciency of the schools, and there is no good reason why this ap- 
propriation should not be made. Again, books may be ob- 
tained by donation. Many a person will only be too glad to 
donate books to a school, provided he is sure that they will be 
appreciated and properly taken care of. Again, funds may be 
raised through school-exhibitions, spelling matches, etc. 
“After the funds have been procured, the most difficult matter 
that will then come up will be the selection of books. This 
should be done by a competent personage or a committee. 
‘There is no reason why the State Superintendent, or a commit- 
tee appointed by this body, should not have prepared by the 
next meeting a list of books suitable for the district school li- 
braries. In the. list should be no costly subscription books. 
The books recommended should be purchasable at wholesale 
rates. Those selected might include books that would interest 
the parents. The district libraries should hold a place in the 
social life of the district. It must supply an attraction, must 
be read and talked over by the elder members of the family—in 
other words, must be literature. After the library has been se-. 
lected, the efficiency of it will depend upon the teacher. Upon 
his skillful guidance will depend whether it shall accomplish 
the greatest good or not. ow. T. Waite,

The Association met pursuant to adjournment. 
The report of the Committee on “School-libraries,” submitted 
by Miss E. B. Nance, of Tracy City, was read by Professor 
Grannis. It advocated the establishment of libraries, commen-

The subject of “Gradation of Public Schools” was next 
taken up. The report was read by Prof. H. D. Huffaker, of 
Chattanooga. He set forth the wisdom of the methods employed 
by the school-boards of the State of Tennessee in giving more 
attention to the subject. The safeguard of the public schools 
in our cities lies in the proper grading of her schools. In 
Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and other cities, 
the attention now given to this subject will make our public 
schools admirable adjuncts to the colleges of the country. 
Miss Higbee read a paper on “ Female Education,” which had 
been compiled by the committee on that subject.

REPORT 
OF THE 
Commissioners OF Watkins InstiTure. 
NasuVILiz, January 2, 1891. 
To the Governor and General Assembly of the State of Tennessee: 
The Commissioners of the Watkins Institute respectfully 
report that the purpose of the founder of this institution was 
to provide the means of instruction for the large number of 
young men and young women whose means did not allow en- 
trance into colleges and academies, and who, on account of the 
necessity of daily labor, could not enjoy the advantages of even 
the public schools. How best this end could be accomplished 
he wisely did not attempt to prescribe or define, saying truly 
: that the dead could not act for the living, and he therefore in- 
vested the Commissioners with a large discretion in carrying 
out the general idea set forth in his last will and testament. 
This trust they have tried faithfully to execute. 
The efforts of the Commissioners to administer the charity 
were at first necessarily tentative and experimentat, and, though 
from the completion of the building literary and scientific lect- _ 
ures were delivered by learned gentlemen, to which the public 
was admitted without charge, it was several years before a plan 
of permanent and systematic government was adopted. The 
wants of the deserving people for whom the benefaction was 
mainly intended could not, we thought, be better served than 
by the establishment of night-schools where the most useful 
branches of an English education should be taught; and we. 
are glad to say that, after making the experiment,your hopes 
have been more than realized. Since the date of last report 
the number of pupils has increased, sessions of the school are 
6—App.D-E-F-G
-P-A-G-E-471
—4— 
held every night except Saturday, interest is taken in the work 
both by teachers and pupils, and altogether the condition of 
affairs is most satisfactory and promising. 
The school, in all appointments of discipline and instruction, 
is virtually a public school, where the ‘ordinary branches of 
English education are taught, and taught, too, by men and 
women specially qualified for the task. Instruction is also given 
in stenography, type-writing, and mechanical drawing, the lead- 
ing object being to ‘give such training as will enable the pupils 
to earn an honest and respectable liying. The number of teach- 
ers, including the principal, is five; the average number of pu- 
pils enrolled, 217 ; and the average daily attendance 134. Ample 
notice before the opening in October is given for enrollment, 
and if those who enroll violate the rules or are negligent in at- 
tendance, their names are dropped, and their places supplied by 
other and more diligent pupils. The Commissioners have had 
the good fortune to engage as principal Prof. William R. Gar- 
rett, well known in this and other States for his eminence as an 
- educator and an organizer; and of his report, herewith pre- 
sented, we respectfully ask an attentive perusal. 
The will of Mr. Watkins directed that a large hall should be 
built and fitted up with book-cases, etc., for a library, and the 
use of it given without charge to any library association ac- 
- ceptable to the Commissioners; and he also authorized them in 
their discretion to purchase books from time to time for the en- 
dowment of seid library. Several years ago the late M. H. 
Howard, in his life-time, gave the sum of $15,000 to establish a 
library in Nashville, and the Howard Library now occupies said 
apartments, being in fact, though not in name, a part of the 
Watkins Institute. No books have yet been purchased, but we 
hope that from this year’s receipts we shall be able to add some 
volumes to that most useful institution. It may not be out of 
place to remark that these two men, each one of whom poor in 
youth, accumulated a fortune by honest industry, were bound 
to each other while living in the closest friendship and love, and 
will continue to live after death, their names associated in the 
hearts and memory of the people of Nashville, who are the re-
-P-A-G-E-472
—5— 
cipients of the fruits of their benevolence. The rooms are open 
every day except Sunday, and for most months they are not 
closed till late in the night. The usefulness of the library is 
limited only by the insufficiency of its means. The books have 
been well selected, and the daily attendance affords an unerring---- 
index of the culture of the city. Steps”are being | taken to try, * 
if possible, to engraft the feature of a circulating library. 
Necessary improvements and repairs, and expenses that can- 
not be avoided, form a considerable item of the disbursements ; 
but under the excellent management of the Superintendent, 
Mr. Joseph 8. Carels, no waste is allowed. The cost of light- 
ing and heating the hall—an expense absolutely necessary for 
the schools, as well as for the comfort of the visitors to the 
library—amounted for the last two years, the former to 
$760.20 for gas, $380.10 for electric lights, and $378.68 for coal. 
The service for telephone amounted to $120, and the picture of 
Mr. Watkins cost $310; the salaries of the Superintendent, 
engineer, and janitor amounted to $2,723.82, all.of which, for 
the two years, including some other miscellaneous items, are em- 
braced in the sum of $6,272.04 in the account here appended. 
The insurance is at a very high rate, on account of the prox- 
imity of the property to the Vendome Theater. The Superin- 
tendent also acts as Librarian, and, notwithstanding his inade- 
quate salary, the duties of both offices are most faithfully and 
satisfactorily discharged. The salaries paid for teaching, ex- 
clusive of school-expenses, is $2,657.85.

Respectfully submitted to the Commissioners of Watkins Institute, January 1, 
1891. Jos. 8S. Caries, Secretary. 
The members of the General Assembly are cordially invited 
to visit the library, and also the school-classes in the different 
rooms, so that they may see by personal observation the mode 
and manner in which the Commissioners are laboring to carry 
out the wishes of the founder. Our books and accounts are at 
all times subjeet to legislative inspection.

To the Commissioners of Watkins Institute: 
GENTLEMEN—In accordance with your instructions, I respect- 
fully submit the following report of the night-school of Watkins 
Institute for the period extending from January 1, 1889, to De- 
cember 81, 1890, and embracing two years: . 
January 1, 1889, found the schools in the midst of the session 
of 1888-9. This session began November 14, 1888, and con-
-P-A-G-E-474

tinued until May 4, 1889. As then organized, the schools were 
not a unit. There were six classes, separate from each other 
and continuing for different lengths of time. The classes in 
mathematics, in book-keeping, and in civil government were 
taught during the first half of the session, and were succeeded, 
respectively, by the classes in mechanical drawing, in short- 
hand and type-writing, and in chemistry. wach ay teesice 
a week, the three classes alternating. This" oR, 
rendered necessary by the fact that only on & ae was van de 
to the use of the school; this was a fine, JarBy" hall, sy * a 
gx iy) The instruction, to a great extant asumed ihe oem of? J 
Cifary lectures, and no provision was made for’; prumary or elet 
teaching. In some of the classes no recotds pf attendance were | 
kept. I have been unable to find even a rhode of cnrollasege 
in several of the classes. The attendance of those sagips 
not compulsory, and wasirregular, Fs, 
The class in chemistry was taught by Prof. W. L. Dudley, 
assisted by Professor McGill; the class in civil government by 
Hon. W.B. Reese; the class in mathematics by W. R. Garrett; 
the class in mechanical drawing by W. T. Magruder; the 
classes in book-keeping and penmanship, and in short-hand and 
type-writing by Alexander Fall. 
In October, 1889, the Commissioners decided to re-organize 
the school—to devote more attention to elementary instruction, 
to make the school a unit, and to conduct it as a regular school, 
meeting every night in the week, except Saturday night. In 
accordance with this plan, the school was organized to consist 
of three departments: The primary school, the elementary 
school, and the technical school. The entire system was placed 
under the control of a general superintendent, and continued in 
operation four months, beginning November 4, 1889, and clos- 
ing February 28, 1890. The attendance is shown in the follow- 
ing table:

In the primary and elementary schools were taught the ordi- 
nary English branches. In the technical school were taught 
short-hand, type-writing, penmanship, and mechanical drawing. 
The teachers employed were: W. R. Garrett, Superintendent ; 
Alexander Fall, W. T. Magruder, Mrs. Alexander Fall, and 
Miss Louise McHenry. The work of this session is more par- 
tinal ag forth, in my annual report submitted to your Board 
‘Wade, yb LAquote from this report as follows: 
aa NE . : 
S ee It was intended that each class should be instructed every 
S.F might in ie Wee except Saturday night. The attendance, 
howe er) Wa "80 far iniexcess of what was expected that it was

‘duly two rooms atour command, it became necessary to divide 
“the’school, The plan was adopted to teach the classes on alter- 
nat aight. * 2 * This arrangement had the advantage 
of enabling the teachers to improve the grading.’ I may 
add that, although the best arrangement that could be made 
under the circumstances, it was attended with many bad effects, 
which I have heretofore pointed out. \ ‘ ‘ 
s 
   
In October, 1890, the Commissioners decided upon important 
measures of improvement. In order to provide for more accu- 
rate grading and more efficient instruction, five rooms were 
assigned to the use of the school,’ additional school-furni- 
ture was purchased, and regulations were adopted limiting the 
number of pupils admitted to the number of seats provided, 
and giving preference to those applicants who are unable to at- 
tend a day-school. In accordance with this action of the Com- 
missioners, the school was organized for the session of 1890-91 
on a basis which enables it to do more effective work than it 
has done during any previous session. 
The following circular, issued in October, 1890, will explain 
‘the organization and regulations of the school for the present 
session :

“The fourth year of the night-school of Watkins Institute 
will begin Monday night, November 8, at 7:30 o’clock. 
* ORGANIZATION. 
“The school is divided into four classes or grades, designated 
as Classes ‘A,’ ‘B,’ ‘CO,’ and ‘D/ 
“In Class A will be taught reading, writing, spelling, primary 
arithmetic, and primary grammar. 
“In Class B will be taught practical arithmetic (begun), En- 
glish grammar, spelling, and writing. 
“In Class C, will be taught practical arithmetic (completed 
except commercial arithmetic), natural science, civil govern- 
ment, and writing. 
“In Class D will be taught commercial arithmetic, kook- 
keeping, type-writing, short-hand, and writing. 
“ADMISSION. 
“Tt is the purpose of the Commissioners to offer the benefits 
of the school to all persons of good moral character of either 
sex who desire instruction in the branches taught therein, and 
who are willing to attend regularly and punctually, and to com- 
ply with the regulations of the school, subject to the following 
conditions: 
“First.—The number of pupils admitted is limited to the 
number of seats provided; one hundred and i fifty pupils can be 
accommodated. 
- « Second.—Preference will be given to those who attended 
the school regularly last year, provided the applicant is unable 
to attend a day-school, and provided the application is made on 
Saturday night, November 1. 
“ Third.—Preference will be given, in the order of applica- 
tion, to those unable to attend a day-school. 
*
-P-A-G-E-477

“ Fourth.—A list will be kept of all applicants, who, being 
eligible, fail to be admitted for want of room. If a vacancy 
occurs, the next applicant on the list will be notified of the 
vacancy, and admitted to the seat. 
“For the purpose of issuing certificates of admission and 
arranging classes, the Superintendent will be present at the 
school-room on Saturday night, November 1, at 7:30 o’clock. 
“ REGULATIONS. 
“The school will be organized and conducted as a regular 
school. It will be in session every night in the week except 
Saturday night, and will continue in operation four months. © 
“Tuition is free in all departments. Regular and punctual 
attendance and compliance with the regulations are required as 
conditions of continuance in the schools. Absence for three 
consecutive nights without good excuse, disorderly conduct, or 
habitual inattention will forfeit the scholarship. It is the de- 
sign of the Commissioners to extend the benefits of Mr. 
Watkins’ bequest to as many persons as possible, and to those 
who make the best use of the opportunity. As it is impossible 
to provide for all applicants, persons who fail to make use of 
the opportunities offered them cannot be permitted to retain 
their scholarships to the exclusion of others who would use 
them better. 
“Text-books will be used to a limited extent. Such text- 
books or stationery as may be required must be provided by 
pupils at their own expense. 
«oW. R. Garrett, Superintendent.” 
The school opened ’at the time named ini the above circular— - 
November 3. 1890—and has continued in regular session to the 
close of the second month—December 23. Two months of the 
present session yet remain, which will fall in the year 1891.

An examination of the statistics of the present session, as 
compared with those of the last session, shows the following 
facts: 
First.—The attendance has been more regular and punctual. 
The ratio of the average number of pupils belonging to the 
school to the total number enrolled has increased from 53 per 
cent. last session to 70 per cent. this session; and the ratio of 
the average daily attendance to the average number belonging 
has increased from 61 per cent. last session to 79 per cent. this 
session. 
Second.—The limitation of the admission of pupils to the 
number of seats provided, while it has diminished the enroll- 
ment, has added greatly to the efficiency of the school. Each 
pupil is enabled to attend every night in the week. The teach- 
ers have been able to make a more complete grading of the 
classes, and to do more thorough work. 
Third.—The regulation giving preference to those who have 
no opportunity to attend a day-school has been, also, very bene- 
ficial in its results. It has not only accomplished the benev- 
olent purpose of the Commissioners in providing instruction 
for those who could find no other opportunity for acquiring an 
education, but it has also had a direct effect in improving the 
regularity of attendance and the earnest work of the pupils. 
In former sessions a large element of the school consisted of 
7—App.D-E-F-G
-P-A-G-E-479
—12— 
pupils of the day-schools who sought special training in 
branches of study in which they were deficient. Many of these 
pupils were not regular in attendance, and were not in earnest 
in thé desire to improve. Their restlessness affected the entire 
school. 
Fourth.—The present organization greatly facilitates discipline 
and solid instruction. Each room is placed under the control 
of a teacher, who is held responsible for its management. It is 
a source of much pleasure to me to report that the management 
of the teachers has been so kind and firm, and the deportment 
of the pupils has been so excellent, that no punishment or the 
enforcement of any penalty.has been found necessary in a single 
instance. Only one case has occurred where even a reprimand 
was required from the Superintendent. A cordial and earnest 
spirit of work pervades the school. I cannot speak too highly 
of the earnest and skillful management of all the teachers. The 
pupils seem impressed with an honest purpose to use to the best 
advantage the opportunity afforded them by the munificence of 
Mr. Watkins, which has been so judiciously administered by 
the Commissioners. 
T again feturn my thanks for the marks of continued confi- 
dence and courtesy which the Commissioners have shown me. 
Respectfully submitted, 
W. R. Garrurr, Superintendent.
